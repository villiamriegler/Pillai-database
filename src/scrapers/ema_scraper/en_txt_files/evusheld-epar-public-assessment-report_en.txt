1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant AstraZeneca AB submitted on 14 March 2022 an application for marketing authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Evusheld, through the centralised procedure falling within 
the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to the centralised 
procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 12 October 2020. 
A combination pack request was submitted to the Agency on 3rd December 2020. In accordance with 
Eudralex, Notice to Applicants, Volume 2A, Chapter 1, Section 5.5, "In very exceptional circumstances, 
which must be considered on a case-by-case basis, the marketing of distinct medicinal products in the 
same package may be indispensable for public health reasons. Such reasons cannot be related to 
convenience or commercial purposes". Further to consultation with ETF on 19th December 2020, the 
CHMP endorsed via written procedure, the outcome of the review process that the proposed 
combination pack was considered indispensable for public health, in order to facilitate patient access to 
the medicinal product in the current pandemic situation. The European Commission has been informed 
of this outcome and endorsed the acceptance of the combination pack in the context of the COVID-19 
emergency situation, stressing that the studies to support co-formulation shall be accelerated, and the 
progress of these ongoing studies must be reported to the EMA.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
In December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of cases of 
viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020, the pathogen causing this 
atypical pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 
(SARS-CoV-2) and genome sequence data were published. Since then, the virus has spread globally on 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 11/155 
 
 
 
 
30 January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
and on 11 March 2020 a pandemic.  
According to European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC), histologic findings from the 
lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to lung injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such 
as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular 
damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 
In addition, COVID-19 is a zoonosis and some animals as cats seems to be susceptible to the virus (Shi 
et al., 2020).  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology and risk factors 
As of 18 March 2022, there have been 464,809,377 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally 
with approximately 6,062,536 deaths resulting from infection and subsequent coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) as registered by WHO (https://covid19.who.int/ last accessed  on 20/3/2022), however, 
the majority of infections result in asymptomatic or mild disease with full recovery. By region, 
191,842,819 cases have been confirmed in Europe.  
Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic 
respiratory disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are 
considered risk factors for developing severe COVID-19. Increasing age is another risk factor for 
severe disease and death due to COVID-19. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Coronaviruses (CoV) are enveloped RNA viruses and are important human and animal pathogens. Two 
coronaviruses have previously been identified as zoonotic infections which have adapted to humans 
and caused severe respiratory illnesses with high fatality: Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome 
coronavirus 1 (SARS-CoV-1) and Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS-CoV). 
SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein (S protein) is a class I transmembrane envelope protein that forms a 
homo-trimer and mediates binding, fusion, and viral entry into host cells. The spike protein contains a 
polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase pathogenicity and transmissibility in other 
viruses. As referred the Spike is responsible for allowing the virus to attach to and fuse with the 
membrane of a host cell. The S1 subunit catalyses attachment to the angiotensin converting enzyme 2 
(ACE-2) receptor present on cells of the respiratory tract, while the S2 subunit facilitates fusion with 
the cell membrane. The spike protein is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine development 
because it was shown that antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits an immune 
response that prevents infection in animals. 
It is believed that SARS-CoV-2 has zoonotic origins, and it has close genetic similarity to bat 
coronaviruses. Its gene sequence was published mid-January 2020 and the virus belongs to the beta-
coronaviruses.  
Human-to-human transmission of SARS-CoV-2 was confirmed in January 2020. Transmission occurs 
primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. 
Finally, novel coronavirus can evolve under relatively strict selective pressure (Lv et al,2020). Different 
variants have been identified so far as Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Zeta, Delta, Lambda, Omicron, etc. The 
Delta variant of the virus spreads faster and infects more cells because it catalyzes the fusion process 
between virus particles and human cell membranes, allowing them to enter cells more efficiently 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 12/155 
 
 
 
(Zhang et al., 2021b). The Omicron variant of the virus can escape from human immunity, though 
fortunately this escape is not complete (Wang et al., 2022). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis  
The human disease caused by SARS-CoV-2 has been designated COVID-19. In most (~80%) cases, 
COVID-19 presents as a mild-to-moderately severe, self-limited acute respiratory illness with fever, 
cough, and shortness of breath. Symptoms are thought to appear 2 to 14 days after exposure. COVID-
19 can be severe, resulting in pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, hypercoagulation, 
kidney failure, and death. 
Studies among hospitalised patients have found that high SARS-CoV-2 viral load is associated with 
worse outcomes, including increased mortality rates (Magleby, 2020) (Westblade, 2020). Community-
based studies in non-hospitalised patients show symptomatic patients have higher viral load across 
both adults and children compared to asymptomatic individuals (Chung, 2021).
Patients with severe and critical COVID-19, even prior to the appearance of acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, exhibit lymphocytopenia and suffer from T-cell exhaustion, which may lead to viral sepsis 
and an increased mortality rate. 
The gold standard method of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is the reverse transcription 
polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test 
detects RNA but not infectious virus, its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. 
The test is typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or 
sputum sample. In addition, serological assays measure antibody responses and determine 
seroconversion although they are not well suited to detect acute infections. 
2.1.5.  Management 
The management of COVID-19 cases has developed during 2020, and includes supportive care, which 
may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs.  
Treatment of hospitalised patients encompass anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone, 
targeted immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants as well as antiviral therapy (e.g. Veklury 
(EMEA/H/C/005622)), antibodies administered from convalescent plasma and hyperimmune 
immunoglobulins. Tocilizumab (EMEA/H/C/000955/II/0101) was also approved for its use in adults 
with COVID-19 who are receiving treatment with corticosteroid medicines and require extra oxygen or 
mechanical ventilation as well as Anakinra (EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0086) for the  treatment of 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult patients with pneumonia who are at risk of developing 
severe respiratory failure. Recently, three monoclonal antibodies Ronapreve (casirivimab/imdevimab, 
EMEA/H/C/005814) Xevudy (sotrovimab, EMEA/H/C/005676) and Regkirona (regdanvimab, 
EMEA/H/C/005854) have been authorised for the treatment of COVID-19 disease in adults and, in the 
case of Ronapreve and Xevudy also adolescents (from 12 years of age and weighing at least 40 
kilograms), who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of their disease 
becoming severe are also included. In addition, Veklury (EMEA/H/C/005622/II/0016) also extended its 
indication to include treatment of adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at 
increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. 
Ronapreve is also approved for prevention of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged 12 years and 
older weighing at least 40 kilograms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022

Additionally, there are 5 approved vaccines for active immunisation against SARS-CoV-2 aiming to 
prevent COVID-19 disease, these are Comirnaty (EMEA/H/C/005735), Spikevax (EMEA/H/C/005791), 
Vaxzevria (EMEA/H/C/005675), COVID-19 vaccine Janssen (EMEA/H/C/005737) and Nuvaxovid 
(EMEA/H/C/005808). 
Finally, an oral treatment for adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased 
risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 was approved in January 2022 (Paxlovid, EMEA/H/C/005973) 
While care for individuals with COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, the need for vaccines 
and therapeutics able to prevent, mitigate and treat COVID-19 infections during the ongoing pandemic 
still remains. Especially protection of vulnerable groups and mitigating the effects of the pandemic on a 
population level are desired. In addition, some studies have shown that patients might experience 
potential sequelae, including chronic fatigue, thrombotic events post infection, non-reversible lung 
disease, etc, although these aspects have not been fully determined yet. 
2.2.  About the product 
Evusheld (AZD7442) is a medicinal product consisting of two components: tixagevimab (AZD8895) and 
cilgavimab (AZD1061), i.e., two SARS-CoV-2-specific monoclonal antibodies that bind to non-
overlapping epitopes on the receptor-binding domain of the S protein and block its interaction with the 
hACE2 host cellular receptor, resulting in a blockade of virus entry.  
The applicant is seeking marketing authorisation for the following indication and associated posology 
for Evusheld:  
EVUSHELD is indicated for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adult and pediatric individuals (12 years of 
age and older and weighing at least 40 kg). 
The recommended posology for Evusheld in adult patients and in adolescent patients 12 years of age 
and older weighing at least 40 kg is 300 mg of Evusheld, as 150 mg of tixagevimab and 150 mg of 
cilgavimab administered as separate sequential intramuscular injections. 
2.3.  Quality aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Evusheld (AZD7442) is a combination of two monoclonal antibodies (tixagevimab and cilgavimab, also 
known as AZD8895 and AZD1061, respectively) as active substances, presented as a combination 
pack, which are directed against two distinct, non-overlapping epitopes on the receptor binding domain 
(RBD) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike protein. The 
antibodies were derived from the B cells of individuals who previously recovered from SARS-CoV-2. 
The monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been engineered with YTE and triple mutation (TM) 
substitutions to extend the mAb half-life and reduce effector function through reduced binding to FcγRs 
and C1q. When bound to the SARS-CoV-2 spike RBD, the mAbs prevent its interaction with the human 
angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2) host cellular receptor and neutralise the virus by blocking its 
entry and replication. Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are produced in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells 
by recombinant DNA technology. 
The finished product is presented as solution for injection containing 150 mg of tixagevimab and as 
solution for injection containing 150 mg of cilgavimab as active substance.

Other ingredients are histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sucrose, polysorbate 80, and 
water for injections. 
Both tixagevimab and cilgavimab finished products, contained in Evusheld combination pack, are 
available in separate clear glass vials closed by a chlorobutyl elastomeric stopper sealed with a dark-
grey aluminium flip-off top (1 vial each per carton). 
2.3.2.  Active Substance 
2.3.2.1.  General information 
Cilgavimab and tixagevimab are human IgG1κ mAb composed of two identical heavy chains and two 
identical light chains directed against the receptor binding domain in spike (S) protein of SARS-CoV-2. 
Both mAbs harbour two distinct mutations (TM and YTE) in the Fc part. The TM substitutions include: a 
leucine to a phenylalanine at residue 248 or 240, a leucine to a glutamic acid at residue 249 or 241, 
and a proline to a serine at residue 345 or 337, respectively. The YTE substitutions include: a 
methionine to a tyrosine at residue 266 or 256, a serine to a threonine at residue 268 or 260, and a 
threonine to a glutamic acid at residue 270 or 262, respectively. The modifications are well known for 
other mAbs and are sufficiently described. TM reduces Fc-effector functions, whereas YTE extends 
serum half-life by enhancing affinity to FcRn. The mode of action of cilgavimab is blocking of SARS-
CoV-2 binding to hACE2. The potency of cilgavimab is determined by a binding ELISA. Cilgavimab has 
a molecular mass of approximately 152 kDa (including glycosylation), and tixagevimab has a molecular 
mass of approximately 149 kDa (including glycosylation). 
The biological and physico-chemical properties have been described in detail. 
2.3.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Sufficient GMP documentation is provided for the active substance manufacturing sites Samsung 
Biologics and Lonza biologics, including an acceptable QP declaration. 
The cilgavimab and tixagevimab active substance manufacturing processes have been adequately 
described.  
The upstream manufacturing process of the cilgavimab and tixagevimab active substance includes 
several cell culturing steps. Medium and feed preparation has been described and is sufficiently 
controlled. After thawing of the working cell bank (WCB) the cells are expanded in shake flasks and 
rocker bags. The cells are further expanded in seed bioreactors of increasing size and transferred to 
the final production bioreactor. The in-process controls (IPCs) and other controls of the different steps 
are sufficiently described, and adequate ranges/limits have been defined. The unprocessed bulk (UPB) 
is tested for bioburden, mycoplasma, and adventitious viruses, which is acceptable. The active 
substance is harvested by a continuous flow centrifuge followed by a membrane filtration operation. 
The protein is then purified using a series of packed bed chromatographic and membrane filtration 
techniques. Finally, dilution and excipient solutions are added to prepare the active substances. Finally, 
the formulated bulk is 0.2 micron filtered and filled directly into active substance containers and 
designated active substance.  
The IPCs and other controls of the different steps are sufficiently described and adequate ranges/limits 
have been defined. Protein concentration (titre) is controlled at the production bioreactor, with an 
action limit. Cell viability and viable cell density are controlled process attributes throughout cell

EMA/205600/2022  
Page 15/155 
 
 
 
culture expansion; pH, conductivity, bioburden, endotoxin and step yield are tested at harvest. 
Duration of each step is determined. Limit of duration and condition of hold time at harvest is 
determined. Step yield, bioburden and endotoxin are also tested throughout the purification process. 
Also, acceptable range/acceptance criteria are defined for each operating parameter/IPC for the 
downstream process. Preparation, filtration, and storage conditions for media and feeds are described. 
IPCs, critical process parameters (CPPs), non-CPPs and performance attributes for inoculum and 
production media are determined. Media and feeds are filtered through 0.2 micron filters, their storage 
conditions and acceptable ranges are determined. Overall, the process is considered adequately 
described and the selected operating parameters and in-process/microbial controls are considered 
sufficient to ensure consistent manufacturing and safety of the cilgavimab and tixagevimab active 
substances. 
The cleaning and storage regimen for the columns is provided in the dossier. Resin lifetime will be 
validated according to the provided protocol. Results of laboratory scale studies are also provided.  
Reprocessing is permitted in case of technical, operational, or automation issues for the virus filtration 
and filtration of the formulated bulk. The procedure is limited to re-filtrations and adequately 
described. The batch numbering systems, using unique numerical digits, have been sufficiently 
described. For the filtration operations at several manufacturing steps, in line filters are used. It has 
been stated that different filters might be used, and equivalent alternatives are allowed. 
Control of materials 
An overview of the raw materials used for cell culture, harvest, and purification is provided. 
Compendial materials are tested according to compendial methods. Non-compendial materials are 
tested in accordance with in-house specifications. Water for injections (WFI) that is used in the 
preparation of media and buffers is produced by the manufacturing site and complies with the 
requirements stated in the Ph. Eur. The chromatography resins have been described in sufficient detail 
(specific names of resins). Dialysed foetal bovine serum (FBS) and the CHO cell line have been stated 
as the only animal derived materials used in the manufacturing process. Materials of other biological 
origin used have been sufficiently described.  
The binding sequence for the SARS-CoV-2 spike was obtained from memory B cells from two SARS-
CoV-2 patients. The DNA-sequence of the variable domains were sub-cloned into an expression 
plasmid. The construction of the expression plasmid is sufficiently described. The host cell line for 
cilgavimab and tixagevimab expression is a CHO-K1-derived cell line adapted to serum free expansion 
and designated CAT-S. The development of the cell line and the generation of the cilgavimab 
production cell line is described in sufficient detail. The clonality of the cell line was assured by 
fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS)-based single-cell sorting, which was verified by two 
independent observers.  
A research cell bank (RCB) was established and sufficiently tested and shown to be free of adventitious 
agents. A two-tiered cell banking system has been established for cilgavimab and tixagevimab, 
including Master Cell Banks (MCBs) and Working Cell Banks (WCBs). Currently one MCB and one WCB 
have been produced per mAb; however, during the product lifecycle, further WCB batches can be 
established by expansion of an MCB vial as per protocol provided in the dossier. Furthermore, an End-
of-Production (EOPCB) and Limit-of-In-Vitro-Cell-Age (LIVCA) Cell Bank was manufactured for each 
product. All cell banks were sufficiently tested for identity, safety, and purity including sterility, 
mycoplasma, mycobacteria, adventitious and endogenous viruses, and species identification. In 
addition, the MCB, EOPCB, and LIVCA bank are tested for infectious retroviruses. The cell bank testing 
was performed in line with the relevant guidance (ICH Q5A, Q5B, Q5D, etc.) with all specifications met. 
The cell line stability has been sufficiently demonstrated. The genetic stability was investigated by 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 16/155 
 
 
 
cDNA verification, gene copy number determination and Southern Blotting of the MCB, EOPCB and 
LIVCA. All cell banks showed comparable results.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical steps and intermediates have been defined individually for each manufacturing site (i.e. 
Samsung Biologics and Lonza Biologics). In this section, microbial controls and intermediate hold times 
are defined. CPPs and IPCs have been included and summarised in the dossier, which is considered 
acceptable. The assigned limits for the microbial control are adequate. The hold times are currently 
based on microbial control study results are adequate. 
A comprehensive overview of critical in-process controls and critical in-process tests performed 
throughout the cilgavimab and tixagevimab active substance manufacturing process is given. 
Acceptable information has been provided on the control system in place to monitor and control the 
active substance manufacturing process with regard to critical, as well as non-critical operational 
parameters and in-process tests. Actions taken if limits are exceeded are specified. 
Nonetheless, biochemical hold time stability studies are still on-going at both manufacturing sites for 
the cilgavimab intermediates. In the Rolling Review 2 (RR2) response document, the applicant 
provided a final date by when results will be submitted, and this point is put forward as quality 
recommendation (Quality REC 1).  
Process validation 
Process validation was performed individually at the two proposed active substance manufacturing 
sites. The validation of the cilgavimab and tixagevimab formulated active substance manufacturing 
process included process performance qualification (PPQ) batches, extended hold times validation, limit 
of in vitro cell age, column and filter (lifetime, cleaning and storage) validation, medium, feed and 
buffer validation. Consecutive PPQ batches were manufactured and extended holds were performed for 
all PPQ batches. Process parameters selected for the validation studies are appropriate. All three 
categories of process outputs: IPCs, microbial controls, and performance attributes (PAs), were 
included in process validation. Process control terminology and tested parameters are identical for 
cilgavimab and tixagevimab between the Samsung and Lonza Biologics active substance manufacturing 
sites. All validation criteria were met, with minor deviations not impacting the overall validation. 
Extended hold times during manufacturing steps were validated.  
The same chromatography resins are used for the manufacturing of cilgavimab and tixagevimab, which 
is considered adequate given the co-administration of both mAbs. Due to the reduced timeline required 
by the pandemic, commercial-scale runs were initiated prior to the completion of the small-scale 
studies. Small-scale studies have been stated to be in progress; however, no data are currently 
available. The applicant is recommended to provide respective data as soon as they become available 
to set a preliminary maximum number of cycles. This recommendation applies to both active 
substances. (Quality REC 2). Clearance of process-related impurities is demonstrated. Results confirm 
that the downstream manufacturing process is capable to decrease the impurity levels consistently well 
below the acceptable exposure limits. A number of validation studies are still ongoing. These include 
small scale process intermediate hold validation study based on biochemical stability at both 
manufacturing sites (only for cilgavimab; this study is completed for tixagevimab), small and 
commercial scale resin lifetime and carryover studies at both manufacturing sites (both active 
substances), ultrafiltration membrane lifetime study (both active substances), and small scale 
validation studies for reprocessing (both active substances). For the aforementioned studies, the 
applicant provided a date by when the results could be submitted. Microbial challenge results for the 
resin sanitisation and storage solutions are summarised in the dossier and confirm that the 
recommended exposure time to the solutions ensures robust inactivation. Validation of resin lifetime 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 17/155 
 
 
 
and carryover has been performed in a ”mixed” manner, where both cilgavimab and tixagevimab 
intermediate batches were used. This approach is acceptable due to prior platform knowledge of the 
applicant. The UF/DF membrane lifetime and carryover study is being conducted at commercial-scale; 
the maximum planned number of cycles for the UFDF membrane is not registered in the dossier, and 
the applicant plans to change the filter when acceptance criteria are exceeded. Studies for reprocessed 
virus filtration and final filtration are ongoing at small scale applying the same controls as the routine 
manufacturing process. The currently available data do not show significant effects on resin materials 
and product carryover. Therefore, due to the pandemic situation and given the monitoring programme 
at commercial scale, it is acceptable to use the resins without a defined maximum resin lifetime from 
the small-scale models. The same set of ultrafiltration/diafiltration membranes are used for the 
manufacturing of cilgavimab and tixagevimab, which is considered adequate given the co-
administration of both mAbs. The lifetime studies were performed at commercial scale at Samsung 
Biologics and Lonza Biologics. Sufficiently detailed information/summaries for the shipping validation 
are provided and cover the ground route needed. Reprocessing of the virus filtration and 0.2 micron 
filtration steps are currently evaluated at small-scale. The results of the studies are pending and the 
applicant is recommended to provide them as soon as they become available (Quality REC 3). 
AstraZeneca commits to provide the results of the reprocessing of the virus filtration and 0.2 micron 
filtration studies when they become available. At Samsung Biologics, a batch was reprocessed at the 
viral filtration step. The applicant provided available results from the reprocessed batch which met all 
validation acceptance criteria. 
Manufacturing process development 
The development and characterisation of the active substance manufacturing process is adequately 
described in several sub-sections. For the identification of critical quality attributes (CQA) a Failure 
mode and effects analysis (FMEA) based severity assessment has been performed. The approach 
employs a numerical scoring system based on impact and uncertainty. The system is sufficiently 
described. All Quality attributes (QA) are assessed and the results are provided in a tabular format 
including rationales for each decision. QAs with severity scores ≥9 are defined as critical.  
The cilgavimab and tixagevimab manufacturing process was initially developed at a 500 L scale and 
up-scaled to support preclinical studies and clinical development.  
In order to increase the production capacity for late-stage clinical supply, the formulated active 
substance manufacturing processes for cilgavimab and tixagevimab were transferred and scaled up. 
This process uses the clonal cell line at clinical scale. The manufacturing process follows the same 
overall process flow. A comparison of the formulated active substances manufacturing processes is 
provided in the dossier. The changes implemented are generally considered related to the cell line 
change and is called Process 2. 
For commercial manufacturing Process 2 was transferred and up-scaled to 15 kL at Samsung Biologics, 
Incheon, Republic of Korea and 6kL at Lonza Biologics, Portsmouth, USA. Due to the up-scale, facility-
specific changes were made to the seed train and viral filter but are otherwise the same as the clinical 
process. The changes were sufficiently described in the dossier.  
A comprehensive comparability programme has been performed for both mAbs, which followed the 
recommendations laid down in ICH Q5E. Based on the results of batch release and characterisation 
studies as well as degradation profiles, active substances manufactured using either the clinical or 
commercial process are considered comparable. The applicant is also recommended to provide 
degradation profiles for the ongoing comparability study for the LB Process 2 material as they become 
available. This recommendation applies to both active substances. (Quality REC 4). In summary, the 
development of the manufacturing process is sufficiently described. Despite minor differences affecting 
non-CQAs the materials from the different processes are considered comparable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 18/155 
 
 
 
The process characterisation is based on risk assessments of each step to conclude whether dedicated 
characterisation studies are needed. In the provided risk assessment conclusions to not evaluate 
certain process parameters are mostly based on prior knowledge with other mAbs or experience with 
the cell culturing process. This is in general acceptable. The characterisation studies were performed as 
multivariate or univariate studies. Process parameters (PP) that impact at least one CQA are classified 
as CPPs, while process parameters that do not impact any CQAs are classified as non-CPPs (NCPPs). 
The final conclusion of a PP as critical was done by calculating an Impact Ratio. The Impact Ratio is 
calculated as the Impact (impact on CQA at PP target and upper or lower limit) divided by the 
Tolerable Impact (CQA limits). A parameter is classified as a CPP when the Impact Ratio for at least 
one CQA exceeds a predefined threshold. Process parameters with Impact Ratios below this threshold 
are classified as NCPP. The approach is considered adequate, and the results (defined for most 
CPP/NCPP) are acceptable. The risk of extractables and leachables originating from the manufacturing 
process materials was evaluated using a three-step safety risk assessment strategy. The approach is 
sufficiently described and uses questionnaire-based evaluation of the product contact materials 
followed by a detailed risk assessment (including contact duration, temperature, material surface to 
product volume ratio, and proximity to active substance in the process sequence). Materials with a 
defined medium or high risk are finally assessed taking into consideration the process step where the 
material is used, contact area (relative to the overall process volume), and expected clearance 
capability of leachables in subsequent process steps. If a potential concern remains, the safety risk is 
estimated using relevant in-house, supplier, and toxicological data. As they are used in the upstream 
part of the manufacturing process this is considered adequate as sufficient clearance of small 
molecules during the downstream process is expected. 
Characterisation 
The cilgavimab and tixagevimab active substances have been sufficiently characterised by 
physicochemical and biological state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the 
expected structure of a human IgG1-type antibody. The analytical results are consistent with the 
proposed structure. 
The Reference Standards were used in the characterisation analysis and elucidation of structure tests. 
Characterisation was performed extensively with a broad range of analytical techniques. Primary 
structure was confirmed and post-translational modifications like heavy chain glycosylation, 
galactosylation, C-terminal Lys removal, asparagine deamidation, N-terminal cyclisation, and 
methionine oxidation were analysed. Disulfide bond structure was confirmed by peptide-mapping of 
non-reduced mAbs. The theoretically expected amino acid sequence of both the mAbs was confirmed 
by LC/MS peptide mapping (using trypsin, 100% sequence coverage) and mass analysis of 
deglycosylated samples. The disulfide bridges corresponding to the known IgG1 structure have been 
identified by comparing non-reduced and peptide maps to those obtained upon reduction of the 
proteolysate. In both mAbs, the predominant glycoforms are G0F, G1F and G2F (complex, biantennary 
structures with core fucosylation). High mannose was detected in low amounts. Human IgGs contain 
one conserved N-linked glycosylation site located in the CH2 domain in the heavy chain. For 
cilgavimab, the N-linked glycosylation site is Asn-311. For tixagevimab, the N-linked glycosylation site 
is Asn-303. No other N-glycosylation or O-glycosylation sites were detected. Immunogenic 
carbohydrates, namely NGNA and gal-(α 1-3)-galactose were not identified in either mAb. Charge 
isoforms were analysed by adequate techniques, and the acidic and basic fractions were qualitatively 
correlated with post-translational modifications. Low amounts of high and of low molecular weight 
variants have been detected using HPSEC, analytical ultracentrifugation and capillary SDS-
electrophoresis. Sedimentation analysis confirm the relative amount of HMW component. Disulfide 
bond structure of both mAbs was determined and the disulfide bonds expected for IgG1 type 
immunoglobulins were confirmed. Far- and near UV CD spectra were compatible with the known 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 19/155 
 
 
 
immunoglobulin fold. Regrettably, no experimental data reflecting on the overall molecular size and 
shape (e.g. sedimentation velocity figures, hydrodynamic radius) of the two mAbs was provided; 
nevertheless, assuming that cilgavimab and tixagevimab are similar to the known IgG1 type IgGs, this 
seems reasonable. For both cilgavimab and tixagevimab, the product-related substances not classified 
as CQA by the risk assessment procedure are discussed in the relevant section of the dossier. For 
tixagevimab, methionine oxidation in the variable region was also identified. Assessment of potential 
impact on biological activity, PK, immunogenicity and safety revealed a low risk of these variants. 
Glycation was found in both cilgavimab and tixagevimab batches. Forced glycation studies, however, 
indicated that not even very high degrees of glycation exert a negative influence on potency or FcRn 
binding. Overall, the non-CQA classification of the product-related substances is considered justified for 
both cilgavimab and tixagevimab. 
Furthermore, binding activity to the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein was determined, and the ability of 
cilgavimab and tixagevimab to block SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein from binding to the hACE2 receptor on 
the target cell was measured with a pseudovirus as well as a SARS-CoV-2 neutralisation assay. 
Cilgavimab and tixagevimab are IgG1s and harbor two mutations (TM and YTE) in the Fc-domain. The 
TM mutation was included to reduce Fc-effector functions. Binding of FcγRIIIa showed a reduced 
binding capacity in comparison to a positive control IgG1 mAb. Based on these data and the well-
known TM mutation, it is considered acceptable to omit further Fc-effector function analyses (e.g. 
ADCC, CDC assays, etc.). Furthermore, cilgavimab and tixagevimab harbor the also well-known YTE 
mutation in the Fc-part, to enhance binding to FcRn and, thereby, prolong the serum half-life of the 
mAb. This enhanced binding property was confirmed by an AlphaLISA binding assay. The 
characterisation of the structural aspects and biological activities, including potency, is considered 
‘state of the art’ and does not raise any issues. 
The impurities of cilgavimab and tixagevimab were divided into process- and product-related 
impurities. This is considered acceptable. Process-related impurities with high criticality scores consist 
of Host cell DNA, Host Cell protein, and Protein A. Potential impurities, like small molecules or synthetic 
macromolecules, were assessed for safety. All potential impurities were shown to bear minimal 
acceptable risks for patients with sufficiently high impurity safety factors. 
In summary, the characterisation is considered appropriate for this type of molecule. 
2.3.2.3.  Specification 
Specifications for the cilgavimab and tixagevimab active substances are defined in accordance with ICH 
Q6B. The proposed tests and limits are considered adequate.  
A correlation between target antigen binding and virus neutralisation capacity to examine whether the 
potency test reflects on the therapeutic goal of the product has been adequately shown.  
Where acceptable limits were established in pharmacopoeia, regulatory guidance, or relevant scientific 
publications, these have been adopted. These tests are endotoxin, bioburden, host cell DNA and host 
cell proteins. In the response document, the applicant agreed with revising the limit on the basis of 
batch results (Quality REC 8). 
In the response document the applicant agreed with revising the acceptance limits when results of 
additional batches will be available. This recommendation applies to both active substances (Quality 
REC 5).

Analytical methods 
The analytical procedures for cilgavimab and tixagevimab are identical. All compendial and non-
compendial assay have been adequately described and verified or validated in accordance with ICH, as 
applicable. References to the compendial analytical methods have been included into the specifications 
tables for both active substance and finished product for both mAbs. The analytical methods used have 
been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately validated in accordance with 
ICH guidelines. The potency of active substance and finished product is determined by target binding 
ELISA. The intervals will be recalculated, and the specifications reassessed when additional active 
substance batches are available for each molecule. This point is put forward as Quality REC 6. 
All compendial and non-compendial assay have been adequately described and verified or validated, as 
applicable. References to the compendial analytical methods have been included into the specifications 
tables for both active substance and finished product for both mAbs. However, the reference IDs of the 
in-house method should as well be included in the documents in Sections 3.2.S.4.1 and 3.2.P.5.1. 
(Quality REC 11) The tests were transferred to Lonza Biologics as an alternative testing site for 
release and stability. Transfer validation was demonstrated. As the robustness study was conducted 
during method development and not with the analytical validation, the applicant will not incorporate 
the robustness data into the validation section. This does not stand in contradiction to the guidance of 
ICHQ2. However, robustness study data are recommended to be inserted into an appropriate section 
of the dossier, e.g. S.2.6. This point is put forward as recommendation and applies to both active 
substances (Quality REC 10). 
Batch analysis 
Batch information and release data on multiple lots are provided for both mAbs using the 
manufacturing processes. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process. Batch release data are provided for cilgavimab and tixagevimab active 
substances manufactured by the commercial process P2 and the previous P1 process. The results from 
both sites (Samsung Biologics and Lonza Biologics) are comparable. All test results met the pre-
defined acceptance criteria. 
Reference materials 
A two-tiered system with a primary and working reference standards (RS) has been established for 
cilgavimab and tixagevimab. Qualification data demonstrated their suitability as primary RS. The 
qualification and stability acceptance criteria for future primary and working standards have been 
provided. 
Container closure system 
The container closure system of cilgavimab and tixagevimab active substance is adequately described. 
Stability studies demonstrate consistent active substance product quality over long-term storage, 
including no observed precipitation or adsorption (no change in protein concentration) to date. 
Extractable and leachable studies were performed. No compound was detected above threshold of 
toxicological concern (TTC) of 20 μg/day in line with ICH M7 (R1). 
For the simulated leachables study on the active substance container, results beyond those provided 
for the 2–8°C and 23–27°C conditions are recommended to be submitted as soon as they are 
available. This recommendation applies to both active substances and is put forward as 
recommendation (Quality REC 12).

2.3.2.4.  Stability 
The stability results indicate that the active substances are sufficiently stable and justify the proposed 
shelf life when stored at 2-8°C in the proposed container. 
Overall, the analytical methods used are considered sufficiently sensitive and able to detect the main 
degradation pathways of cilgavimab and tixagevimab active substance. Taken together, it can be 
concluded that the used analytical methods are sufficiently stability-indicating. An adequate post-
approval stability protocol has been provided. 
2.3.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.3.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The cilgavimab and tixagevimab finished products are available as sterile, preservative-free, liquid 
dosage form in a vial. The finished product is a clear to opalescent, colourless to slightly yellow, pH 6.0 
solution. Commonly used and compendial compliant excipients are used. It is formulated at 150 mg of 
cilgavimab or tixagevimab per vial with a 1.5 mL label-claim volume. It is formulated at 100 mg/mL 
cilgavimab or tixagevimab in L-histidine/L-histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, sucrose, and 
polysorbate 80, pH 6.0.  
All excipients used for the manufacture of the finished product are of compendial grade. No excipients 
of human or animal origin or novel excipients are used. 
During development, the formulation of cilgavimab and tixagevimab was changed from an initial 
lyophilised to a liquid formulation. The concentration and excipient formulation did not change during 
the entire development. Minor changes were made to the vial and stopper used. Adequate univariate 
and multivariate formulation characterisation studies have been performed. The data support the use 
of the formulation.  
The finished product does not include overages. An overfill is used to guarantee the withdrawal of the 
required dose. The finished product was initially developed as a lyophilised formulation and 
subsequently changed into a liquid formulation. The process was finally transferred to Samsung 
Biologics and up-scaled to Process 2 Commercial. 
An ICH Q5E compliant comparability study was performed to assess the potential impact of process, 
scale, and site changes on the quality attributes of cilgavimab. Additional characterisation and stress 
stability analyses showed comparable results. Taken together, material manufactured at Samsung 
Biologics Process 2 Commercial is considered comparable to the materials used during development 
and clinical trials.  
Process characterisation studies were performed to evaluate product quality impacts of process 
parameters, resulting in their classification as either CPPs or NCPPs. The impact of process parameters 
on process performance was also determined. A process failure mode evaluation analyses (pFMEA) was 
used and each manufacturing step investigated. Acceptable ranges were defined for NCPPs.  
The finished product cannot be finally sterilised by heat and does not include preservatives. Therefore, 
sterility is ensured by sterile filtration, release testing for sterility and endotoxins and container closure 
integrity (CCI). The control strategy has been sufficiently described. Furthermore, Rabbit Pyrogen 
Tests have been performed demonstrating that cilgavimab and tixagevimab are not pyrogenic. 
Cilgavimab and tixagevimab are intended to be administered by intramuscular injection. Compatibility 
studies were performed using 3 mL polypropylene (PP) syringe as well as a 1 mL polycarbonate (PC) 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022

syringe with a 23G gauge stainless steel needle (syringes provided separately). The in-use 
compatibility study demonstrates the in-use stability of the finished product in the syringe for IM 
injection for up to 4 hours at 2-8°C or 4 hours at room temperatures up to 30°C. 
The container closure system has been sufficiently described. Extractable and leachable studies 
revealed no compounds potentially present in the finished product originating from the container 
closure materials at reasonable concentrations. 
The primary packaging is a clear glass vial closed by a chlorobutyl elastomeric stopper sealed with a 
aluminium flip-off top. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of 
the product. 
2.3.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The cilgavimab and tixagevimab finished product is manufactured at Samsung Biologics, Republic of 
Korea, and subsequently labelled and secondary packaged. Sufficient GMP documentation is provided 
for the finished product manufacturing sites. A QP declaration has been provided for Samsung Biologics 
and Lonza Biologics. The batch size range for the finished product is defined. 
The cilgavimab and tixagevimab manufacturing process at Samsung Biologics is provided in the dossier 
consists of thawing, pooling, bioburden reduction filtration, mixing, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, 
stoppering, capping, and 100% inspection of filled vials. The filled vials are transferred to the 
secondary packaging site where labelling and secondary packaging takes place. Each step has been 
further described in sufficient detail. Time out of refrigeration (TOR) limits for the active substance and 
finished product have been indicated. No reprocessing of a manufacturing step is mentioned. The batch 
numbering systems, using unique numerical digits, have been sufficiently described. CPPs, IPCs, and 
intermediate hold times were determined during process characterisation and validation studies. The 
control elements together with their respective acceptance criteria were adequately included into the 
dossier.  
The finished product manufacturing process was validated at Samsung Biologics, Incheon, Republic of 
Korea. Three process validation runs were conducted for the primary finished product manufacturing 
process. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate. Additional 
auxiliary validations to support the manufacturing process were as follows: aseptic process validation, 
container closure integrity testing, filter validation, and shipping qualification. Information about the 
area of the sterilising filter should be stated in Module 3.2.P.3.3 of the dossier according to the 
Guideline on the sterilisation (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015) (Quality REC 13). This 
recommendation applies to both finished products. Shipping validation was performed as simulated 
transportation study. 
2.3.3.3.  Product specification 
Finished product specifications are set in accordance with ICH Q6B, with acceptably defined acceptance 
criteria. 
Concerning potential finished product impurities reference is made to corresponding AS section, which 
is considered adequate as no new impurities are expected. 
A risk evaluation concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product 
has been performed (as requested) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 23/155 
 
 
 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based 
on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified on the possible presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no additional 
control measures are deemed necessary.  
Furthermore, an elemental impurity analysis in line with ICH Q3D is currently ongoing, and the 
applicant is recommended to provide results of the studies (Quality REC 7). 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. The methods used for finished product 
testing are either compendial test methods which do not require validation or are identical to the 
methods used for cilgavimab and/or tixagevimab active substance testing, with the exception of the 
lateral flow identity and the container closure integrity assay used for identity and sterility (during 
stability) testing of the finished product. The assay was sufficiently validated covering specificity, limit 
of detection, and robustness.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data on several batches of the finished product were provided. The results are within 
the specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
The reference standard used for finished product and the active substance are the same. 
2.3.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life of cilgavimab and tixagevimab finished product is 18 months when stored in a 
refrigerator (2-8°C), in the original package in order to protect from light. The finished product should 
not be frozen nor shaken. Chemical and physical in-use stability has been demonstrated for 4 hours at 
2ºC to 25ºC.  
The stability of cilgavimab and tixagevimab finished product was evaluated based on ICH Q5C: Quality 
of Biotechnological Products: Stability Testing of Biotechnological/Biological Products. Stability studies 
are ongoing. However, given the current COVID-19 pandemic situation, the approach of the applicant 
to define a shelf life for cilgavimab and tixagevimab finished products is considered appropriately 
justified and, thus, accepted for three Process 2 Commercial finished product batches (Process 
Validation batches). These batches are considered production batches, based on the definition provided 
in ICH Q1A(R2). Due to the accelerated development of cilgavimab in response to the COVID-19 
pandemic, the usual volume of stability data that would be provided for the proposed commercial 
finished product are not yet available. In line with ICH Q5C, the batches were tested under long-term 
(2-8°C), accelerated (23-27°C/55-65% RH) and stress (38-42°C/70-80% RH) conditions. Fifteen (up 
to 12 for clinical and up to 9 for commercial batches) months are currently available for the 
development batches under long-term conditions. All acceptance criteria were met. 
The initial set shelf-life is set at 18 months under long-term conditions based on extrapolation of 9 
months stability data. Extrapolation is normally not acceptable for mAbs at MAA. However, due to the 
pandemic situation and given that 15 months are available for clinical/development batches and 
comparability to the commercial batches has been shown, the extrapolation was considered justified. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 24/155 
 
 
 
Any further extension of the shelf-life will be done by submission of a variation and it is expected to be 
based on real-time data of commercial batches. A confirmatory photostability study is planned that will 
be conducted in accordance with ICH guidance Q1B using one batch of cilgavimab and tixagevimab 
finished product to demonstrate that the design of the finished product container/closure in secondary 
packaging (commercial marketing pack) protects the product from potential light exposure during 
product storage and transportation activities. 
2.3.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
TSE compliance 
No animal-derived material is used during the manufacturing process of cilgavimab and tixagevimab. 
The MCBs are free from TSE-risk substances. There are no excipients of animal origin. In summary, 
compliance with the TSE guideline (EMEA/410/01 – rev. 3) has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Virus safety 
For viral agents, the capacity of manufacturing procedure to eliminate viral agents has been shown in a 
satisfactory manner. The viral clearance assessment is considered acceptable. Four purification steps 
were evaluated for their viral clearance capacity, low pH treatment, AEX chromatography, CEX 
chromatography and virus filtration. The choice of model viruses (Xenotropic Murine Leukemia, 
Pseudorabies Virus, Reovirus Type 3 and Minute Virus of Mice) can be approved. Reports from the 
contract laboratory that have performed the virus titre assays are attached. A concise description of 
the virus titre determination has been submitted. For the scale-down model, process parameters were 
compared to those in place at manufacture. In addition, process performance data for the AEX and the 
CEX steps has been submitted. For endogenous viruses, satisfactory safety factors were reported for 
both cilgavimab and tixagevimab. Prior process experience with both anion and cation exchange 
chromatography resins for other AstraZeneca monoclonal antibodies supports effectiveness of virus 
reduction using re-used resins. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of Evusheld, which has been developed as a 
combination pack of two active substances, cilgavimab and tixagevimab, and their respective finished 
products, has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that Evusheld should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
A finished product manufacturing site was included in the dossier although process validation was not 
complete. The absence of completed process validation data was identified as a major objection during 
RR2 stage. The applicant has subsequently removed the site from the dossier, which resolved the 
major objection. At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality 
issues having no impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product. These points have been put forward 
and agreed as recommendations for future quality development (see section 2.3.6). 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of Evusheld is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data have 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety.

2.3.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The applicant is recommended to provide biochemical hold time stability data for cilgavimab 
intermediates once the study is completed. 
2.  The applicant is recommended to provide the results of the chromatography resin lifetime 
studies once they are available. This recommendation applies to both active substances.  
3.  The applicant is recommended to provide the results of the reprocessing of the virus filtration 
and 0.2 micron filtration studies when they become available. This recommendation applies to 
both active substances. 
4.  The applicant is recommended to provide degradation profiles for the ongoing comparability 
study for the LB Process 2 material as they become available. This recommendation applies to 
both active substances.  
5.  Regarding the potency assay, the applicant is recommended to recalculate the tolerance 
intervals used to assess process variability for the Stability Limits Approach and Non-Stability 
Limits Approach once a sufficient number of batches are available. This recommendation 
applies to both active substances.  
6.  The applicant is recommended to recalculate the acceptance criteria for Target Binding Potency 
Assay once a sufficient number of batches are available. This recommendation applies to both 
active substances. 
7.  The applicant is recommended provide the final results of the elemental impurities risk 
assessment as soon as they become available. This recommendation applies to both active 
substances.  
8.  Revision of AS HCP acceptance limits on the basis of batch results is recommended for both 
cilgavimab and tixagevimab.  
9.  The applicant is recommended to provide the updated analysis for the multivariate FP formulation 
characterisation. This recommendation applies to both finished products.  
10. As the robustness study was conducted during method development and not with the analytical 
validation, the applicant will not incorporate the robustness data into the validation section. 
This does not stand in contradiction to the guidance of ICHQ2. However, robustness study data 
are recommended to be inserted into an appropriate section of the dossier, e.g. S.2.6. This 
recommendation applies to both active substances. 
11. The applicant is recommended to list the reference IDs of the in-house method documents in 
Sections 3.2.S.4.1 and 3.2.P.5.1.  
12. For the simulated leachables study on the active substance container, results beyond that 
presented for the 2–8°C and 23–27°C conditions are recommended to be submitted as soon as 
they are available. 
13. Information about the area of the sterilising filter should be stated in Module 3.2.P.3.3 of the 
dossier according to the Guideline on the sterilisation (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015). 
This recommendation applies to both finished products.

2.4.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
2.4.2.  Pharmacology 
AZD7442 (Evusheld) is a combination product of two IgG1 mAbs, (tixagevimab and cilgavimab, also 
known as AZD8895 and AZD1061), targeting the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein. Both antibodies are 
derived from the B cells of individuals who previously recovered from SARS-CoV-2 infection and have 
been engineered with YTE and TM substitutions in the Fc region, to extend mAb half-life and reduce Fc 
effector function. 
2.4.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
AZD8895, AZD1061 and AZD7442 were shown to bind with picomolar affinity to the SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein trimer ectodomain (KD: 2.76 pM, 13.0 pM and 13.7 pM respectively), and with nanomolar 
affinity to the spike-RBD. Importantly, the mAb combination AZD7442 bound with approx. 3000x 
higher affinity (KD: 13.7pM) to the spike trimer than the cellular receptor hACE2 (43 nM).  
Co-crystal structures and cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) analysis confirmed that the two 
antibodies bind simultaneously to the RBD and recognize two unique, non-overlapping epitopes. The 
structures identified key AZD8895 interactions with RBD residue F486 and AZD1061 interactions with 
residues K444 and R346. The structures also support human ACE2 (hACE2) blocking as the mechanism 
of action for AZD8895 and AZD1061, as their epitopes and binding sites overlap with the hACE2 
interface. 
Functionally, AZD8895, AZD1061 and the combination AZD7442 blocked the interaction of the RBD 
and hACE2 with comparable IC50 values of 318 pM, 531 pM and 433 pM, respectively. Consistently, 
AZD8895, AZD1061 and AZD7442 neutralised the USA-WA1/2020 strain of SARS-CoV-2 on Vero E6 
cells, with calculated IC50 values of 9, 32 and 10 ng/mL, respectively. Across different assay formats, 
AZD8895 was slightly more potent than AZD1061, which is in line with its higher affinity for the spike 
RBD.  
In a dose-response neutralisation test using wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and Vero E6 cells the combination 
of AZD8895 and AZD1061 demonstrated synergistic neutralisation. Similarly, in a dose-response 
neutralisation matrix using spike-pseudotyped lentivirus, the majority of combination doses of the two 
mAbs were found to show synergy. In both experiments, synergistic neutralisation was best 
demonstrated at suboptimal mono-mAb concentrations.  
In vivo studies 
The in vivo efficacy of single doses of AZD7442 has been assessed for the treatment and prevention of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in two non-human primate (NHP) studies (MCBS7442-0006 and MCBS7442-
0013) and two Syrian golden hamster studies (MCBS7442-0008 and MCBS7442-0011).  
Monkeys and hamsters are both models for COVID-19 and have also been used for non-clinical 
evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The development of clinical symptoms of infection like loss of body 
weight and pulmonary pathology are more pronounced in hamsters compared to monkeys, possibly 
making the hamster a more suitable model to evaluate the effect of AZD7442.  
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 27/155 
 
 
 
AZD7442 was evaluated in two separate NHP models of SARS-CoV-2 infection; one in rhesus 
macaques and one in cynomolgus macaques. For each study, 3-4 NHPs were administered either an 
isotype control antibody or AZD7442 at a dose ranging from 40 to 0.04 mg/kg by IV infusion 3 days 
prior to virus challenge (prophylaxis analysis) or a 40 mg/kg dose of AZD7442, 24 hours after virus 
challenge (therapeutic analysis). To evaluate contributions of Fc effector function in viral clearance, 
one group from each study received AZD7442-YTE (mAb with YTE but not TM substitution) as either 
prophylaxis (4 mg/kg, rhesus macaque study) or treatment (40 mg/kg, cynomolgus macaque study).  
Rhesus macaques and cynomolgus macaques were challenged with 100,000 pfu or 100,000 TCID50, 
respectively with the total virus inoculum split between IN and IT administrations. The viral strain used 
in the challenges is SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 (GenBank MN985325.1) which is close to the 
strain used to build the antibodies.  
In both studies, AZD7442 serum levels increased rapidly in a dose-dependent manner following 
administration and animals that received AZD7442 in treatment showed near maximal serum 
concentrations within 1 day of dosing. The 4 mg/kg dose resulted in serum AZD7442 concentrations 
comparable to those observed in humans following 300 mg AZD7442 administration. 
Only limited histopathology results are presented. There are no upper respiratory tract slides 
presented. As the infectious dose is low and NHPs only recapitulate mild disease, the protection of 
AZD7442 is not apparent in histopathology. The protection is best seen by a comparison of viral loads 
in the treated vs. control groups and is not very apparent in the treatment setting. The duration of 
protection is not addressed but will be based on clinical data.  
Prophylactic AZD7442 administration demonstrated dose-dependent reduction of SARS-CoV-2 burden 
in BAL and nasal swab samples compared with control antibody. AZD7442 administration post-
exposure resulted in only a modest reduction of SARS-CoV-2 burden. In both experiments AZD7442 
showed a similar efficacy as the TM-less AZD7442-YTE at equivalent dose, indicating that antibody 
effector function is not required for AZD7442 elimination of SARS-CoV-2.  
In hamsters, studies were conducted with AZD7442-TM, which incorporates TM but not YTE 
substitutions. For the prophylaxis study, hamsters were administered 2 mg of an isotype control 
antibody or AZD7442-TM IP at doses ranging from 0.002 to 2 mg one day prior to SARS-CoV-2 
infection. For the treatment study, hamsters were administered 5 mg of the isotype control antibody or 
AZD7442-TM IP at doses ranging from 0.5 to 5 mg at either 24 or 48 hours after virus challenge. 
Hamsters were weighed daily after being challenged IN with 100,000 pfu of the USA-WA1/2020 strain 
of SARS-CoV-2, and euthanised on Day 3 or Day 7 post-infection for virological and histologic 
assessments. 
Prophylactic AZD7442-TM administration protected hamsters against loss of body weight.  
AZD7442-TM additionally decreased the viral load in the lungs in a dose-dependent manner; hamsters 
from the 2 mg dose group showed infectious virus titres below level of detection by Day 3 post-
infection. In the treatment study, hamsters that received isotype control antibody showed 
approximately 5% loss in body weight during the week following SARS-CoV-2 infection.  
In contrast, AZD7442-TM treatment at either 24 or 48 hours post-infection, protected hamsters 
against weight loss and also showed some reduction in viral burden which becomes more apparent at 
day 7 compared to day 3. 
Histologic analyses of hamster lung sections confirmed the viral load results and also showed that 
prophylactic AZD7442-TM administration resulted in dose-dependent reduction of inflammation and 
pathologic lesions in the lungs whereas in the therapeutic setting, the administration of ADZ7442 
showed a more modest efficacy, although a trend for a faster resolution of the infection was noted on 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 28/155 
 
 
 
day 7 post infection compared to the scores at day 3.  In both hamster studies, results on viral loads 
or histopathology in the upper respiratory tracts were not provided and the resulting transmissibility is 
unknown but considered as likely. 
In both NHP and hamster models the in vivo efficacy of AZD7442 appears more clearly in the 
prophylactic setting compared to therapeutic setting even when higher doses are administered shortly 
after infection. The applicant does however not claim for a therapeutic indication at this point. 
Anti-viral resistance studies 
The binding sites of AZD8895 and AZD1061 on the spike receptor binding domain were identified 
based on crystallography data. AZD8895 recognises 17 residues (AA 455-456, 458, 475-480, 483-489, 
493), F486 being identified as a key residue. AZD1061 recognises 19 residues (AA 345-346, 439-441, 
443-447, 449-450, 452, 484, 490, 492-494, 499), with R346 and K444 found to be critical for the 
mAb-RBD interaction. In line with these structural data, pseudovirus expressing spike with the 
substitution F486A was not neutralised by AZD8895, and pseudovirus expressing the substitution 
K444A was not neutralised by AZD1061. Importantly, the mAb combination AZD7442 was able to 
neutralise the variants escaping individual mAbs. 
Different methodologies were used to select for SARS-CoV-2 virus showing reduced susceptibility to 
the individual mAbs (AZD8895 or AZD1061), and/or to the AZD7442 combination in vitro. Virus 
variants that escape mAb neutralisation were isolated following serially passaging of SARS-CoV-2 
strain USA/WA-1/2020 or replication competent recombinant VSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike 
protein in the presence of increasing concentrations of AZD8895, AZD1061 or AZD7442 or the parental 
mAb, respectively. In both experiments, the selected escape variants showed reduced susceptibility to 
AZD1061 alone, but not to AZD8895 alone or to the AZD7442 combination when compared to 
reference virus. This suggest that the combination of two mAbs may provide a higher threshold for 
development of escape variants. 
AZD1061 selected for viruses with amino acid substitutions at spike residues 74, 364, 444 and 686. 
AZD1061 was found to bind with much lower affinity to spike protein with individual amino acid 
substitutions R346I, K444E and K444R; moreover, pseudovirus encoding spike with these amino acid 
substitutions were less susceptible to AZD1061-mediated neutralisation. These data are consistent with 
the structural analysis, which identified residues R346 and K444 as critical residues for the interaction 
with AZD1061. 
In additional studies the applicant assessed how conserved the residues recognised by AZD7442 are in 
circulating SARS-CoV-2 strains. Fourteen of 17 residues bound by AZD8895 and 16 of 19 residues 
bound by AZD1061 were conserved in > 99% of SARS-CoV-2 genome sequences (n= 2,620,237, 
analysis through 02 Sept. 2021). The remaining positions were conserved in 67.17% to 97.85% of the 
sequences. More recent SARS-CoV-2 variant strains harbour characteristic RBD substitutions such as 
E484K (Beta, Gamma, Eta and Mu variants) or T478K (e.g. Delta variant). Nevertheless, in SARS-CoV-
2 viruses circulating from May to August 2021 (n= 586,022) the E484 residue was present to 94.4 %, 
while the T478 variant was present to only 30.4%. 
The applicant has further evaluated to what extent AZD7442 and the individual mAbs are capable of 
neutralising variants with identified modifications in the spike protein. Neutralisation tests with pseudo-
viruses harbouring individual amino acid substitutions in the spike identified the F486S and F486V 
variants with greatly reduced susceptibility to AZD8895 (> 600x and approx. 150x, respectively). The 
R346I, K444E, K444Q, K444R, V445A variants were identified as variants with greatly reduced 
susceptibility to AZD1061 (> 200-fold). Variants with reduced susceptibility to AZD7442 were also 
observed (E484L, Q493R, E990A, T1009I), however, the level of reduction of susceptibility to the 
combination was low (up to 5-fold). 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 29/155 
 
 
 
Importantly, the applicant also evaluated the potency of AZD7442 and the individual mAbs against 
authentic circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants including variants of concern. The combination AZD7442 
was able of neutralising the identified variants of concern circulating up to Sept. 2021, i.e. Alpha 
(B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1) and Delta (B-1-617.2). The so far dominant Delta variant of 
concern was inhibited with a similar IC50 as the initial SARS-CoV-2 variant.  
The evaluation, to what extent AZD1061, AZD8895 and AZD7442 maintain neutralising capacity 
against the newly detected variant of concern Omicron (B.1.1.529) is ongoing and updated information 
was provided by the applicant (Feb. 2022). Based on experiments conducted by different, third-party 
laboratories, AZD7442 maintained neutralising capacity against the Omicron variant, albeit at reduced 
efficacy with IC50 values ranging from 171 to 277 ng/ml. Compared to the inhibition of the original 
strain of SARS-CoV-2, the inhibitory activity of AZD7442 was reduced by 12 to 30-fold in assays using 
authentic virus and by 132 to 183-fold in pseudotype virus neutralisation assays. Additional in vitro 
data submitted by the applicant using pseudovirus neutralisation assays confirmed the reduced 
potency of AZD7442 against Omicron B.1.1.529/BA.1 and Omicron + R346K variants as compared to 
the original strain.  
The in vivo potency of AZD7442 against the Omicron variant was also studied in a K18-hACE2 
transgenic mouse model (data from 3rd party) where the prophylactic efficacy of AZD7442 against 
SARS-CoV-2 strains D614G, B.1.1.529 and B.1.1.529+R346K was compared. AZD7442 reduced viral 
load in lungs for all the strains tested, with a greater effect for the D614G strain, a lower reduction for 
B.1.1.529 and even lower for B.1.1.529+R346K. There is no data provided in the treatment setting in 
that experiment.  
The applicant finally referred to a treatment study in Syrian golden hamster (Uraki et al,) which is not 
peer-reviewed. Animals were treated one day after infection with either D614G or Omicron NC928. 
Despite some limitations, this in vivo data confirms the results in mice and the in vitro findings, i.e. a 
significantly reduced potency of AZD7442 against the Omicron variant.  
The clinical relevance of that reduced neutralising activity of AZD7442 against the Omicron variant 
noted in vitro and in vivo remains unknown. 
2.4.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacology in vitro 
The Fc regions of both AZD8895 and AZD1061 incorporate amino acid residue substitutions to extend 
their half-life (YTE substitutions) and to reduce Fc effector function (TM substitutions). This change in 
Fc functionality (compared to wt IgG1) was adequately confirmed by in vitro studies.  
As shown by surface plasmon resonance binding experiments, incorporation of the YTE substitutions in 
AZD8895 and AZD1061 increased their affinity to FcRn at low pH (by approx. 8.5x for human FcRn; 
approx. 6x for cynomolgus FcRn). According to published literature [Dall'Aqua et al., 2006; Robbie et 
al., 2013] the increase in binding affinity to FcRn at low pH can be expected to translate to a longer 
half-life in vivo in non-human primates and in humans. 
Incorporation of the TM substitutions was shown to reduce binding of AZD8895 and AZD1061 to FcγRs 
and C1q. At concentrations ranging from 50 µg/mL to 450 µg/mL AZD8895, AZD1061 and AZD7442 
demonstrated limited or no binding to FcγRs and complement C1q. These mAb concentrations lie in the 
range of serum concentrations observed in a phase I study in healthy volunteers (study 
D8850C00001). For AZD7442 administered at 300 mg IM, Cmax was 31.8 µg/ml, at the 3000 mg IV 
dose Cmax was up to 971 µg/ml. The functional impact of the TM modification in the Fc part was 
confirmed in cell-based assays. AZD8895 and AZD1061 did not mediate Fc-dependent effector

functions, such as Ab-dependent phagocytosis, cellular cytotoxicity, NK-cell activation and complement 
deposition. Furthermore, AZD8895, AZD1061 and AZD7442 did not mediate uptake of spike-
pseudotyped virus particles by cells that express FcγRs and not ACE2, indicating that the antibodies do 
not support antibody-dependent enhancement of infection (ADEI) of cells that lack ACE2 receptor 
expression. This extensive panel of in vitro functional tests addresses relevant Fc-mediated effector 
functions which could contribute to Ab-dependent enhancement of disease (ADE). Based on the results 
from the in vitro studies, the risk that AZD8895 and AZD1061 mediate ADE can be considered low. 
Secondary pharmacology in vivo 
Additional studies were conducted to evaluate to what extent the presence of AZD7442 would impact 
the development of vaccine-elicited immune responses. AZD7442 was administered prior to 
vaccination to enable maximum circulating concentrations of AZD7442. The vaccine used is AZD122, 
the Chimpanzee Adenovirus encoding the SARS-CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (ChAdOx1-S). Studies were 
performed in mice and NHPs where the vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were 
evaluated after 2 immunisations. 
AZD1222-immunised BALB/c mice demonstrated comparable levels of antibodies to spike or RBD and 
comparable levels of spike-specific T cell responses regardless of whether they were given prior 
administrations of AZD7442-TM or an isotype control antibody. Similarly, AZD1222-immunised 
cynomolgus macaques demonstrated comparable levels of antibodies to spike or RBD and comparable 
levels of spike-specific T cell responses regardless of whether they were given prior administrations of 
AZD7442 or an isotype control antibody.  
The applicant claims that pre-administration of AZD7442 did not alter either the humoral or cellular 
immune responses elicited by AZD1222, and therefore considers that AZD7442 administration is not 
anticipated to interfere with vaccine-mediated immunity in the clinical setting. However, the 
justification regarding the drop in AZD7442 exposures noted as of 14 days after the first immunisation 
compared to the controls is not considered sufficiently robust and the absence of any potential 
interference cannot be ruled out.  
2.4.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology endpoints were assessed as part of the single-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus 
monkeys. This is acceptable in line with ICH S6 (R1). The study revealed no AZD7442-related effects 
on the cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system. 
2.4.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
PD drug interaction studies have not been conducted and this is considered acceptable.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Kinetics of AZD1061 and AZD8895 were evaluated after single IV administration in mice transgenic for 
human FcRn and in cynomolgus monkeys as part of the single-dose toxicity study after IV and IM 
administration. This is in line with the intended clinical administration. 
Methods 
In mice, serum concentrations of AZD8895 and AZD1061 were determined using a qualified ELISA 
which is based on the detection of human IgG. In cynomolgus monkeys, serum concentrations of 
AZD8895 and AZD1061 were determined by a validated LC-MS/MS assay. After immuno-affinity

enrichment of the mAbs and proteolytic digestion, characteristic peptides were quantified as surrogates 
of the individual mAb concentrations. LoQ of the method (9.00 µg/ml) is rather high. However, this is 
accepted, considering the high doses of AZD8895 and AZD1061 administered in the toxicity study.  
Pharmacokinetics in huFcRn transgenic Tg32 mice 
HuFcRn transgenic mice (Tg32) are considered a suitable model to assess target-independent kinetics 
of human IgG molecules since changes to the Fc part affecting the binding to human FcRn will be 
adequately reflected in these animals. YTE substitutions in the Fc enhance mAb half-life in vivo. The TM 
substitution in the Fc is not expected to affect mAb PK which was confirmed in the present study using 
two versions of the control Ab MEDI8897. PK of MEDI8897 with and without TM substitution was 
comparable. 
After single IV administration of AZD8895, AZD1061 or control antibodies at 5 mg/kg, Cmax was 
consistently observed at the first sampling point post-dose (1 hr). Serum concentrations declined in a 
multi-phasic fashion. For AZD1061, mean volume of distribution was 121 ml/kg and t1/2 was 17.7 
days; for AZD8895, mean volume of distribution was 126 ml/kg and t1/2 was 31.7 days. The values 
for AZD8895 need to be interpreted with caution, since approx. 59% of AUC0-inf for AZD8895 was 
extrapolated.  
The applicant considers the PK of AZD1061 and AZD8895 in Tg32 mice as similar to the PK of 
MEDI8897 (nirsevimab, an antibody directed against a viral fusion protein and which contains the YTE 
substitution in the Fc region) and MEDI8897+TM. However, Cmax and AUC0-28 values for AZD8895 
and AZD1061 were lower than the respective values for MEDI8897 and MEDI8897+TM. Also the half-
life of AZD1061 was shorter, than that of MEDI8897 and MEDI8897+TM. Thus, it remains to be seen if 
the half-life of AZD7442 in humans will indeed be around 90 days as anticipated by the applicant based 
on clinical data for MEDI8897. 
Toxicokinetics in cynomolgus monkeys 
Single-dose TK of AZD7442 over an 8-week period were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys after IV 
and IM administration, respectively. Kinetics of the individual mAbs were comparable, regardless of 
gender.  
After IV administration of 600 mg/kg AZD7442 (300 mg/kg for each mAb), Cmax was reached at the 
first sampling time point post-dose (1 hr) and was 7730 µg/ml for AZD8895 and 7700 for AZD1061. 
AUC0-56 was 81,400 day*µg/ml for AZD8895 and 97199 day*µg/ml for AZD1061.  
After IM administration of 150 mg/kg AZD7442 (75 mg/kg for each mAb), Cmax was reached after 2-3 
days and was 948 µg/ml for AZD8895 and 1010 µg/ml for AZD1061. Bioavailability after IM 
administration was high (F = 1.22 for AZD1061, F = 1.13 for AZD1061). AUC0-56 was 24,900 
day*µg/ml for AZD8895 and 27,300 day*µg/ml for AZD1061. 
Human efficacious doses for AZD7442 were projected based on in vitro functional potency data that 
account for the potential synergistic effect of 2-mAb combination. Dose levels for FTIH study were 
selected to ensure exposure in serum and the ELF of the lungs to be above the IC80 of 104 ng/mL for 
a duration of at least 5 months post-dose. PK simulations and viral dynamic modelling predict that 
prophylactic and therapeutic benefit can be achieved in the dose range of 300 mg to 3000 mg. 
Dedicated studies for distribution, metabolism, excretion and PK drug interactions were not conducted, 
which is acceptable for monoclonal antibodies.

2.4.4.  Toxicology 
A limited toxicological programme was conducted for AZD7442, comprising a single-dose toxicity study 
in cynomolgus monkeys, and tissue cross-reactivity studies with normal human and monkey tissues, 
and human fetal tissues. Safety pharmacology and local tolerance was assessed as part of the 
toxicology study. Both the tissue cross-reactivity studies and the single dose toxicology study were 
conducted in accordance with OECD Test Guidelines and Principles of Good Laboratory Practice (GLP), 
and according to relevant International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) guidelines. 
The non-clinical safety programme is in line with ICH S6(R1) and takes into account that AZD7442 
recognises a foreign target, i.e. viral protein, which is not endogenously expressed in healthy 
individuals. This programme is acceptable. 
2.4.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
The safety evaluation consists of a GLP-compliant, single-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys 
with an 8-week treatment-free observation period. Selection of cynomolgus as non-clinical species for 
safety evaluation of AZD7442 is justified, based on the YTE-dependent prolonged half-life of AZD7442 
in cynomolgus (as in humans) and considering that the YTE-modification leads to a reduced half-life in 
rodents. Administration of a single dose is justified based on the intended single-dose treatment in 
humans; the study adequately covers two possible routes of administration, IV and IM. The study 
evaluated standard parameters for general toxicity studies; in line with guideline ICH S6 (R1), the 
study included safety pharmacology endpoints (ECG, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, 
neurological examination) as well as local tolerance endpoints (injection site reactions). 
In this toxicity study, AZD7442 was well tolerated at doses up to 600 mg/kg IV (300 mg/kg for each 
Ab) and 150 mg/kg IM (75 mg/kg for each mAb), respectively. The only treatment-related effect was 
an increase in serum globulins on Day 2, considered non-adverse and related to the administration of 
high-doses of human IgG. There were no AZD7442-related effects on safety pharmacology endpoints. 
Due to the lack of findings a longer recovery period (e.g. 5x half-life) is not considered warranted.  
A comparison of the AZD7442 exposure in cynomolgus achieved in this study and human exposure in 
phase I and phase III studies shows an exposure margin of 47 based on Cmax and of 39 based on 
AUC0-56 days.  
2.4.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
Omission of repeat dose toxicity studies is acceptable, considering that a single-dose administration of 
AZD7442 is planned in humans. 
2.4.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
In line with ICH S6(R1) omission of genotoxicity studies is acceptable for monoclonal antibodies, as 
these proteins are not expected to directly interact with DNA or other chromosomal materials. 
2.4.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted for AZD7442. The acute duration of dosing and mechanism 
of action (binding to viral target) does not suggest any carcinogenic potential. Thus, the lack of studies 
is acceptable, and in accordance with ICH S6 (R1).  
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 33/155 
 
 
 
2.4.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In line with IHC S6(R1), reproductive and developmental toxicity studies were not conducted, which is 
acceptable. IgG1 antibodies cross the placenta and may be transferred via milk. In the repeat-dose 
toxicology study in cynomolgus monkeys there were no drug-related macroscopic or microscopic 
changes in the testes, epididymides, ovaries, uterus, or vagina. In view of exogenous targets and lack 
of cross-reactivity with reproductive or fetal tissues in the tissue cross reactivity studies, effects of 
AZD7442 on developing fetus and breast-fed infants are not expected.  
2.4.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
2.4.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
Assessment of local tolerance to AZD7442 was included in the general toxicity study, this is 
acceptable. A single IV or IM administration of AZD7442 was well tolerated locally. 
2.4.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
The potential for off-target binding of AZD7442 and its individual components was assessed in tissue 
cross-reactivity studies with cynomolgus tissues and human tissues from adult and fetal donors. In 
these studies, the individual mAbs and the combination stained positive control material, but no 
binding to any tissue was observed. Thus, the risk of off-target effects in humans is considered low.  
The applicant claims that the batches used in the single-dose toxicity study and the tissue cross- 
reactivity studies (batch number MS00684-83 for the AZD8895 component and MS00684-82 for 
AZD1061) are representative for the intended marketed products after a comparability assessment 
was performed for each process change. Reference is made to the comparability conclusions from the 
quality assessment to confirm that claim.  
2.4.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Both active substances are natural substances (proteins consisting of natural amino acids) not 
expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In summary, the applicant has provided a comprehensive study programme evaluating the 
pharmacology, kinetics and safety of AZD7442 and its individual components. The dossier is well 
written; however, inconsistencies between individual documents (e.g. study reports vs. summaries) 
sometimes hampered the assessment. Therefore, occasional clarification and up-date of documents 
had been requested.  
Pharmacodynamics 
AZD8895 and AZD1061 incorporate YTE and TM amino acid substitutions to extend half-life and 
abrogate Fc effector function, respectively. Similar to published values for other YTE-modified 
antibodies, in vitro AZD8895 and AZD1061 demonstrated higher affinity to FcRn at low pH as 
compared to antibodies lacking YTE. This is expected to translate to a longer half-life in vivo in non-
human primates and in humans. In vitro, the TM substitutions of AZD8895 and AZD1061 resulted in an 
expected decrease in binding affinities to Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) and C1q complement as 
Assessment report

Page 34/155 
 
 
 
compared to the antibodies lacking the TM substitution. The reduced binding occurred at human 
physiological serum exposure following administration of AZD7442. 
AZD8895, AZD1061, and AZD7442 were confirmed to demonstrate reduced or no antibody effector 
function in assays that measured ADCP, ADCC, ADCD and ADNKA as compared to control antibodies 
with unmodified Fc regions. AZD8895, AZD1061 and AZD7442 did not mediate uptake of spike-
pseudotyped virus particles by cells that express FcγRs and not ACE2, suggesting that the antibodies 
do not support antibody-dependent enhancement of infection. In addition, studies in NHPs suggest that 
Fc effector functions are not required for the efficacy of AZD7442. 
Co-crystal structures and biochemical assays demonstrated that AZD8895 and AZD1061 do not 
compete to each other for binding to the RBD and are individually capable of sterically blocking the 
virus from engaging its cellular receptor ACE2. 
The high affinity for binding to spike translates to potent inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 infection in vitro, as 
assessed by micro-neutralisation assay against USA-WA1/2020 strain with calculated IC50 values of 9 
ng/mL, 32 ng/mL and 10 ng/mL for AZD8895, AZD1061 and AZD7442, respectively. For the FRNT 
assay platform, IC50 values of 32 ng/mL, 114 ng/mL and 26 ng/mL, respectively are reported by the 
applicant. The combination of AZD8895 and AZD1061 further demonstrated synergistic neutralisation 
of authentic SARS-CoV-2 and spike-pseudotyped virus in vitro.  
In vivo efficacy 
The in vivo efficacy of single doses of Evusheld (AZD7442) has been assessed for the treatment and 
prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection in 2 NHP studies (MCBS7442-0006 and MCBS7442-0013) and 2 
Syrian golden hamster studies (MCBS7442-0008 and MCBS7442-0011).  
Monkey and hamster are both models for COVID-19 studies and have also been used for non-clinical 
evaluation of SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. The development of clinical symptoms of infection like loss of body 
weight and pulmonary pathology are more pronounced in hamster compared to monkeys, possibly 
making hamster a more suitable model to evaluate the effect of Evusheld.  
Prophylactic AZD7442 administration demonstrated dose-dependent reduction of SARS-CoV-2 burden 
compared with control antibody in both NHPs and hamsters. AZD7442 administration post-exposure 
resulted in only a modest reduction of SARS-CoV-2 burden, in both species.  In hamsters which are 
considered as a better model of disease, the therapeutic administration seemed to accelerate the 
resolution of the infection.  
In both models the in vivo efficacy of AZD7442 to protect against SARS-CoV-2 infection and virus-
induced lung injury appears more clearly when administered prophylactically.  
Overall, based on the in vitro and in vivo studies currently presented the proof-of-concept appears to 
be established and the data provided support the development of the combinational treatment of 
tixagevimab (AZD8895) and cilgavimab (AZD1061) for prophylaxis against the SARS-CoV-2 strain 
USA-WA1/2020 (GenBank MN985325.1).  
Secondary pharmacodynamics  
Secondary pharmacology studies addressed the impact of the AZD7442 on the immune response 
generated by subsequent vaccination with AZD1222 - the Chimpanzee Adenovirus encoding the SARS-
CoV-2 Spike glycoprotein (ChAdOx1-S) vaccine. Studies were performed in mice and NHPs where the 
vaccine-induced humoral and cellular responses were compared after 2 immunisations. The applicant 
claims that pre-administration of AZD7442 did not alter either the humoral or cellular immune 
responses elicited by AZD1222, therefore AZD7442 administration is not anticipated to interfere with 
Assessment report

vaccine-mediated immunity in the clinical setting. However, a decrease in human IgG exposure seen in 
immunised mice compared to non-vaccinated animals challenges this view.  
Antiviral resistance 
In vitro virus passaging with authentic SARS-CoV-2 viruses in Vero E6 cells has been performed in the 
presence/absence of AZD8895, AZD1061 and AZD7442. Escape variants were isolated in the presence 
of AZD1061 alone but neither in the presence of AZD8895 alone nor in the presence of the 
combination (AZD7442). Three amino acid substitutions of the spike protein: N74K (in the N-terminal 
domain, NTD), R346I (in the receptor-binding domain, RBD) and S686G were identified in those 
escape variants to AZD1061. Similarly passaging of recombinant VSV expressing SARS-CoV-2 spike 
identified escape variants for AZD1061 only, with amino acid substitutions K444R and K444E in the 
RBD of spike. 
AZD1061 did not exhibit neutralisation activity against pseudovirus with R346I, K444E or K444R spike 
at the highest mAb concentrations tested, resulting in increases in calculated IC50 values > 200-fold 
when compared to the reference pseudovirus. 
The frequency of in vitro selected AZD1061 resistance-associated substitutions R346I, K444E, and 
K444R among circulating SARS-CoV-2 variants has been low (<0.01%). However, consistent with the 
emergence and transmission of variants harbouring characteristic RBD substitutions E484K (e.g., Beta, 
Gamma, Eta, and Mu) or T478K (e.g., Delta), the conservation of E484 and T478 among recent 
circulating strains (N=586,022; 16 May 2021 through 16 August 2021, https://www.gisaid.org) has 
been 94.4% and 30.4%, respectively. 
In neutralisation assays using authentic SARS-CoV-2 isolates or pseudoviruses bearing all spike 
substitutions identified in variants, AZD7442 retained full to nearly full neutralisation activity against 
Alpha (B.1.1.7), Beta (B.1.351), Gamma (P.1), and Delta (B.1.617.2) variants of concern, and Eta 
(B.1.525), Iota (B.1.526), Kappa (B.1.617.1), Lambda (C.37) and Mu (B.1.621) variants of interest. 
AZD7442 further retained full to nearly full neutralisation activity against Epsilon (B.1.427 / B.1.429), 
R.1, B.1.1.519, C36.2, B.1.241.2 and B.1.619.1 variants with alerts for further monitoring and P.2, 
B.1.616, A.23.1, A.27 and AV.1 variants de-escalated from further monitoring. AZD7442 shows 
potency in neutralising. 
The applicant has provided up-dated information regarding the efficacy of AZD7442 against the 
Omicron (B.1.1.529) variant of concern, that emerged after finalisation of the non-clinical studies. The 
additional information is based on in vitro and in vivo studies conducted by 3rd parties and details can 
be retrieved from publications only. All the results provided suggest that AZD7442 neutralises Omicron 
(B.1.1.529), but with a clearly reduced efficacy compared to the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. The 
clinical relevance of that reduced neutralising capacity against the Omicron variant in vitro and in vivo 
remains unknown. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Kinetics of AZD7442 were evaluated in two non-clinical species after single IV and IM administration, 
respectively. This is in line with the intended clinical route of administration. PK were assessed in mice 
transgenic for human FcRn. This is endorsed since this model reflects the Fc modifications introduced 
to prolong the antibodies' half-life in vivo. AZD8895 and AZD1061 were administered individually by 
the IV route. TK were evaluated in cynomolgus monkeys where the combination of AZD8895 and 
AZD1061 at a 1:1 ratio was administered either IV or IM. Serum concentrations of the individual mAbs 
were determined based on a LC-MS/MS method; the report demonstrating the validation of the method 
was missing  and therefore requested. The validation report was provided and based on the results 
from this study, the analytical method is considered adequately validated.  
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 36/155 
 
 
 
By and large, kinetics of AZD8895 and AZD1061 were comparable and typical for monoclonal 
antibodies with YTE modification and not recognising an endogenous target. Based on a comparison of 
the AZD7442 kinetics in these two studies with non-clinical kinetics of MEDI8897, a control mAb 
bearing the same YTE modification to prolong the half-life, the applicant expects a half-life for 
AZD7442 in humans of approx. 90 days.  
Toxicology 
The non-clinical safety programme is in line with ICH S6(R1) and takes into account that AZD7442 
recognises a foreign target, i.e. viral protein, which is not endogenously expressed in healthy 
individuals. The overall safety programme is considered adequate.  
The programme consists of a GLP compliant, single-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys and 
tissue cross-reactivity studies evaluating potential off-target binding of AZD8895 and AZD1061 in 
cynomolgus and human tissues. Considering the lack of reproductive and developmental studies, 
cross-reactivity with human fetal tissues was also evaluated. In the toxicity study, AZD7442 was well 
tolerated at doses up to 600 mg/kg IV and 150 mg/kg IM, the study revealed no adverse test article-
related effects. AZD7442 exposure in cynomolgus achieved in this study provides a safety margin of 
39-fold based on AUC(0-56 days) compared to human exposure at the proposed 300 mg dose. The 
tissue cross-reactivity studies revealed no binding to human tissues; thus, the risk of off-target effects 
in humans is considered low.  
Limited information was provided regarding the relevance of the non-clinical batches for the product 
intended for commercial use. This will be confirmed by the quality assessment.  
The active substances of AZD7442 are natural substances which are not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. Thus, the absence of ERA studies is acceptable. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, AZD7442 (tixagevimab (AZD8895) and 
cilgavimab (AZD1061) is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.4.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, AZD7442 (tixagevimab (AZD8895) and cilgavimab (AZD1061) 
together) can be recommended for marketing authorisation.

2.5.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
Data including PK, PD (SARS-CoV-2 nAbs), PK/nAbs correlation, immunogenicity, and antiviral 
resistance of Evusheld are available from 3 clinical studies: 
• 
• 
• 
Study D8850C00001 (Phase I FTIH) 
Study D8850C00002 (PROVENT) 
Study D8850C00003 (STORM CHASER) 
In addition, a population PK analysis of pooled Phase I and III data was performed to characterize the 
PK of Evusheld and to evaluate the impact of covariates such as demographics and renal and liver 
function tests on the PK exposure. PK data in healthy volunteers (Phase I study [IM and IV arm]) and 
in participants in the 2 Phase III studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER, and in the treatment Phase III 
study TACKLE were pooled to develop a population PK model to characterize the PK of Evusheld.

An exposure-response analysis was conducted for PROVENT, and a viral dynamics model was 
developed to support the dose selection for prophylaxis. 
2.5.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
Serum and nasal lining fluid (NLF) PK samples were analysed for AZD8895 and AZD1061 by an LC-
MS/MS method. An immunoaffinity approach using streptavidin magnetic beads coated with 
biotinylated receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein was used to enrich AZD8895 
and AZD1061 (different epitopes) from human serum. Because AZD8895 and AZD1061 are too large 
for practical direct quantitative analysis using LC-MS/MS technology, the bound proteins were 
subjected to “onbead” proteolysis with trypsin, following standard protein denaturation, reduction, and 
alkylation processing steps. As a result of the trypsin digestion, characteristic peptide fragments 
originating from each antibody were produced by this procedure. Characteristic peptides were 
quantified as surrogates of the AZD8895 and AZD1061 concentrations.  
In serum, the method is applicable to quantitation of AZD8895 and AZD1061 within a nominal range of 
0.300 to 30.0 μg/mL. The validations followed the principles laid down in 
EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2** Guideline on bioanalytical method validation.  
For NLF PK assay, calibration curves and quality controls were prepared by fortifying AZD8895 and 
AZD1061 in surrogate matrix due to the limited nature of blank nasal lining fluid. The method is 
applicable to quantitation of AZD8895 and AZD1061 within a nominal range of 5.00 to 1500 ng/mL. 
Assays were qualified but not validated. Concentrations of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in NLF have 
been determined by collecting nasal fluid via a nasosorption device. The dilution of the nasal fluid 
introduced by the extraction step was corrected by a multiplication factor calculated from the serum: 
nasal sample eluate urea concentration ratio. 
The live 80% neutralisation assay (PRNT80) was used to test samples from the phase I and phase III 
studies, which passed validation for all parameters. Study samples were within the validated titer 
range. 
A multi-tiered testing approach, consisting of validated assays for detection (screening assay), 
specificity (confirmation assay), and semi-quantification (titer assay), was used for the assessment of 
anti-drug antibody (ADA) responses to Evusheld (tixagevimab and cilgavimab separately). In this 
assay, samples, positive controls (PCs), and negative control (NC) are pre-incubated with Biotin- 
AZD8895/AZD1061 and Sulfo-Tag- AZD8895/AZD1061. Any ADA present in the human serum will 
form a bridge between the Biotin- AZD8895/AZD1061 and Sulfo-Tag- AZD8895/AZD1061 molecules. 
This complex is bound to a blocked MSD Streptavidin (MSD SA) plate and detected by a 
chemiluminescent signal that is generated when voltage is applied. The resulting 
electrochemiluminescent signal (ECL or relative light units, RLU) is directly proportional to the amount 
of ADA present in the human serum. Validation revealed that the assays met the acceptance criteria of 
the EMA guidance (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 2**) for relevant parameters and may 
be suitable for its intended purpose. 
Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
Non-compartmental analysis (NCA) was conducted to evaluate Phase I and Phase III data, descriptive 
statistical summaries have been provided for PK variables.

Population pharmacokinetics 
A population PK analysis of pooled Phase I and III data was performed to characterize the PK of 
Evusheld and to evaluate the impact of covariates. PK data in healthy volunteers (Phase I study [IM 
and IV arm]), in participants in the 2 Phase III studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER, and in the 
treatment Phase III study TACKLE were pooled to develop a population PK model to characterize the 
PK of Evusheld. 
The final pooled dataset for analysis included 2527 participants with a total of 7375 Evusheld PK 
measurements. An IM dose of 300 mg was used in the 2 prophylaxis studies (PROVENT and STORM 
CHASER), and 600 mg IM in the treatment study (TACKLE). The Phase I study investigated the PK of 
Evusheld in healthy volunteers with doses ranging from 300 mg IV to 3000 mg IV and 300 mg IM. 
The final parameter estimates are presented in the table below. 
Table 2 
Empirical Bayes estimates of Evusheld PK parameters from the final population PK model were used to 
simulate: 
- Evusheld concentration-time profiles over 15 months after a single 300 mg IM dose and to derive 
percentages of participants above minimum protective concentration of 2.2 μg/mL 
- PK model-based simulations to evaluate the influence of fixed dose versus weight-adjusted dosing on 
the exposure of Evusheld

body weight of > 40 kg) in the indication. No pharmacokinetic data in the paediatric population are 
available.

Evaluation and qualification of models 
A 2-compartmental model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination for tixagevimab, 
cilgavimab, and Evusheld PK following IV and IM administration was selected as final model to describe 
the PK data. Weight has been included by fixed allometric scaling exponents (CL: 0.75, V:1.0). 
Covariates have been selection based on the statistical selection criteria p=0.05 for inclusion and 
p=0.001 for the backward elimination step. 
Diagnostic plots indicate overall a good description of PK data. High variability following a fix dose IM 
and in Cmax following IM and IV could be detected. The issue of potential correlation bias in the pop 
PK model regarding weight, sex and diabetes will be followed in updated versions of the popPK model 
and need to be addressed by considering outstanding bioanalytical data. 
Absorption 
After a single 300 mg IM dose (150 mg each mAb) in the Phase I study, the mean (%CV) Cmax was 
16.52 (35.56%) and 15.27 (38.53%) μg/mL for tixagevimab and cilgavimab, respectively, which was 
reached at a median tmax of 14 days.  
The population PK model-based absorption rates (KA; 1/day) were similar for tixagevimab (0.109 
1/day) and cilgavimab (0.106 1/day). Based on PK modeling, the time to achieve the minimum 
protective serum concentration (2.2 μg/mL) of Evusheld is estimated to be 6 hours (IQR of 3.4 to 11.7 
hours) following 300 mg IM administration, while for the Omicron variant (minimum protective serum 
concentration of 3.3 μg/mL) it is estimated to be 10.5 hours (IQR 5 to 21 hours). 
Bioavailability 
In the Phase I study, the estimated absolute bioavailability after a single 150 mg IM dose was 68.54% 
for tixagevimab and 65.79% for cilgavimab. The population PK model-based bioavailability of Evusheld 
was 66.9%. 
Bioequivalence  
The PROVENT and STORM CHASER studies were initiated with cell pools material. Once clonal cell line 
material (the proposed commercial material) became available, this was used in an additional cohort in 
PROVENT to obtain PK and safety data in the prophylaxis setting. A preliminary comparability 
assessment of clonal cell line material was performed. This comparability analysis was not initially 
planned when the study was designed. Based on the measured PK variability in Phase I, it was 
calculated that PK data were required from at least 70 participants dosed with cell pools material and 
70 participants dosed with the clonal cell line material to be able to demonstrate that the 90% CI 
interval of the ratio of the geometric mean AUC0-91 or Cmax is between 80 to 125%. PK data were 
available for 68 participants who were dosed with AZD7442 clonal cell line material and had PK results 
for both AZD8895 and AZD1061 at all sampling time points (Day 8, Day 29, Day 58, and Day 92). 
Corresponding data are available for 67 participants who were dosed with cell pools material. For some 
participants from whom the Day 92 samples were collected early, the parameter AUC0-91 could not be 
calculated by extrapolation and AUClast was used instead.

No differences in the safety profiles were noted for participants who received cell pools material versus 
clonal cell line material (although the proportion of participants who received clonal cell line material 
was relatively small). Due to the small number of events in PROVENT, a specific analysis of efficacy in 
cell pools material versus clonal cell line material was not carried out. The geometric mean serum 
neutralising antibody titre at days 8 and 29 was notably higher in subjects receiving intended

commercial material (779.5 and 881.3) compared to subjects receiving study material (472.4 and 
663.2). However, individual nAb titres in the participants that received clonal cell line material fall 
within the distribution of the overall population and as the cohort receiving commercial material was 
small (70 subjects), chance findings are possible. Testing material (cell pools vs clonal cell line) as a 
covariate for clearance in the population PK model supported that material was not a clinically 
significant covariate and did not reduce the percentage of unidentified inter-subject variability in CL. 
Distribution, metabolism and elimination 
Volume of distribution was 2.72 L for tixagevimab and 2.48 L for cilgavimab for central compartments 
and 2.64 L for tixagevimab and 2.57 L for cilgavimab for peripheral compartments, reflecting the 
limited ability of extravascular distribution. 
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are expected to be degraded into small peptides and component amino 
acids via catabolic pathways in the same manner as endogenous immunoglobulin G antibodies. 
From population PK modelling the estimated typical CL was 0.0405 L/day for tixagevimab and 0.0412 
L/day for cilgavimab with between subject variability of 21.3% and 29.3% respectively. CL is lower 
than known for typical mAbs (ranging between 0.2 – 0.5 L/day) and correlates with the half-life 
extension of the antibodies. 
The estimated population median terminal elimination half-life was 90.6 days for Evusheld, 88.8 days 
for tixagevimab and 84.4 days for cilgavimab; values confirm successful half-life extension of the 
antibodies.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Based on results from FITH study D8850C00001, the pharmacokinetics of both, tixagevimab and 
cilgavimab, are linear and dose-proportional between 300 mg and 3 000 mg following a single 
intravenous administration. Only 1 dose level has been administered via IM route in clinical trials. 
Thus, dose-dependency of absorption cannot be assessed. 
Evusheld is currently planned to be administered as a single dose. No analysis of PK under steady state 
conditions has been performed; the potential for accumulation has not been investigated. 
Variability 
In FITH study D8850C00001, between-participant variability (%CV) in tixagevimab AUCinf and Cmax 
after 300 mg IM administration was 30.22% and 35.56%, respectively, and 31.66% and 38.53%, 
respectively, for cilgavimab. PK variability up to Day 92 was higher in the PROVENT population 
compared with the Phase I population of healthy volunteers, with the geometric CV% ranging from 
71.5% to 90.3% for Evusheld over the 4 time points sampled (Days 8, 29, 58, and 92). 
By popPK modelling, all parameters were estimated with good precision (%RSE for all parameters were 
below 30%) except IIV of V3 with 30.8% RSE. The extent of the shrinkage of the individual parameter 
estimates to the typical values was evaluated. The IIV (%CV) of Evusheld for CL was estimated to 
20.9%, however, was high for V2 (82.3%) and Ka (47.5%). The IIV on bioavailability (F1) did not 
show a significant improvement in the population PK model performance and was not included. The IIV 
for V3 was not included for the cilgavimab population PK model due to no change in OFV. 
No intra-individual comparison has been performed in the clinical trials with single dose administration.

Complete 1-year PK data for AZD7442 in healthy volunteers are available from the FITH study 
D8850C00001. This was a Phase I, FTIH, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose 
escalation study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and PK of Evusheld in healthy adult participants 18 
to 55 years of age. Participants were randomised 10:2 to receive either Evusheld or placebo 
administered IV or IM, across 5 fixed dose cohorts as follows:  
•  Cohort 1a (Evusheld 300 mg or placebo IM),  
•  Cohort 1b (Evusheld 300 mg or placebo IV),  
•  Cohort 2 (Evusheld 1000 mg or placebo IV),  
•  Cohort 3 (Evusheld 3000 mg or placebo IV), and  
•  Cohort 4 (Evusheld 3000 mg with the 2 mAbs co-administered, or placebo IV).  
In Cohorts 1a, 1b, 2, and 3, the 2 constituent mAbs of Evusheld were administered as separate 
injections or infusions; in Cohort 4, the 2 mAbs were co-administered within the same IV infusion. 
Overall, 60 participants were enrolled in this study. A total of 10 participants were enrolled and 
randomised to Evusheld in each cohort, and 10 participants were randomised to pooled placebo. The 
mean age of Evusheld participants was 39.4 years. Most Evusheld participants were male (32 [64.0%]) 
and White (34 [68.0%]). 
Blood samples for serum PK analysis were collected at predose (baseline), mid-infusion (IV), end of 
dosing (IV), 8 hours post-dose, Day 2 (discharge), and Post-dose Follow-up Days 4, 6, 8, 15, 31 61,

Paediatric target population  
Simulations using the population PK model were performed to support dosing of Evusheld for the 
prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adolescents aged ≥ 12 years weighing at least 40 kg. The median and 
90% percentiles of AUC ratio (adolescents 40 to 95 kg /all weight 36 to 177 kg) at 3 months is 1.09 
(1.04 to 1.15) and at 9 months it is 1.08 (1.04 to 1.16), which falls within the boundary of 0.8 to 1.25 
equivalence criteria. This predicted minimal increase in exposure in the average adolescent population 
compared with the average adult population in combination with the favourable safety profile of 
Evusheld at the 300 mg IM dose with exposures that are ~12-fold lower than the exposures associated 
with the highest IV dose tested in Phase I, justifies the use of Evusheld in the untested adolescent 
population.

Special populations 
Sex and age were statistically significant covariates on KA, sex and diabetes on V2, and diabetes on 
CL. These covariates were not considered clinically significant as these covariates reduced the IIV of 
KA by only 7.0%, V2 by 15.7%, V3 by 0.3% and CL by just 1% relative to the base population PK 
model with fixed allometric exponents on clearance and volume of distribution. Vaccination status is 
not indicated to have a relevant impact on PK. 
The issue of potential correlation bias in the pop PK model regarding weight, sex and diabetes will be 
followed in updated versions of the popPK model. 
In general, monoclonal antibodies are not expected to be eliminated via renal excretion due to their 
high molecular weight of about 150 kDa. Thus, no formal studies have been conducted to investigate 
the effect of renal impairment on Evusheld. Based on population PK analysis, there is no difference in 
the clearance of tixagevimab and cilgavimab in participants with mild (n = 978) or moderate (n = 174) 
renal function compared with participants with normal renal function. In the population PK model, 
there were insufficient participants with severe impairment or complete renal failure (0.8%; n = 21) to 
draw conclusions regarding the impact of severe renal impairment on the PK of tixagevimab and 
cilgavimab. Evusheld is predominantly cleared via catalysis by cells of the reticulo-endothelial system. 
Therefore, dialysis is not expected to impact the clearance of Evusheld as supported by the limited PK 
data available in participants on dialysis (n = 11). 
Tixagevimab and cilgavimab are expected to be primarily metabolised via proteolysis at the cellular 
level, so that impairment of hepatic clearance is not expected to lead to increased drug exposure. 
Thus, no specific studies have been conducted to examine the effects of hepatic impairment on the PK

of Evusheld. In the population PK model, the effect of hepatic function on CL using either aspartate 
aminotransferase, alanine aminotransferase, or bilirubin baseline concentrations as a covariate was not 
statistically significant. This exploratory analysis was limited by the fact that there were only 56 
hepatically impaired participants (2.2%) in the Phase III PK analysis data set.  
PK data on 1220 (47.7%) female participants included in the population PK analysis suggest that sex is 
not a clinically significant covariate for Evusheld PK with comparable weight-adjusted CL in females 
and males. The population PK covariate model suggests that male participants have a faster absorption 
rate (45%) and lower central volume of distribution (37%) and thus slightly lower exposure of 
Evusheld compared with female participants. 
Based on the population PK analysis, race and ethnicity did not have a statistically significant effect on 
CL of Evusheld based on data from Hispanic/Latino (n = 531) vs non- Hispanic/non-Latino participants 
(n = 1875) and based on Black (n = 269) vs White (1939), vs other participants (n = 352). 
Body mass index as a categorical covariate (< 30 vs ≥ 30 kg/m2) on KA in the population PK model 
did not test as statistically significant and therefore the dose of Evusheld does not need to be adjusted 
for BMI based on the BMI range of 21 to 41 kg/m² in Phase III studies. PK model simulations were 
conducted with the final population PK model to compare exposure for fixed dose versus weight-
adjusted dose in the studied population with body weight ranging from 36 to 177 kg. Allometric 
exponents for scaling CL and V were set to 0.75 and 1 in the base and final model. The results showed 
that the predicted AUC over the first 6 months after dosing mostly overlapped between the 2 
regimens.  
All clearance or blood flow parameters (CL, Q) were scaled by body weight to the 0.75 power, and all 
distribution/tissue size parameters (V2 and V3) were scaled linearly by body weight with a power 
exponent of 1. Mean body weight in the population PK analysis dataset was 83.5 kg (90% percentiles: 
56 to 120 kg). Body weight on CL reduced the CL % IIV from 32.1% to 21.9%, body weight on V2 
reduced the V2 % IIV from 107% to 98%, and body weight on V3 reduced the V3 % IIV from 24% to 
10.6%. Assuming no other covariate effect, the CL of Evusheld is predicted to be 50% higher for a 
participant with body weight of 120 kg (95th percentile), while CL is predicted to be 15% lower for a 
participant with body weight of 56 kg (5th percentile). 
PK data on 790 (30.9%) participants with cardiovascular disease were included in the population PK 
covariate analysis to evaluate its effect on CL and V2. Results suggest that cardiovascular disease is 
not a statistically significant covariate for Evusheld PK. 
Population PK analysis in which age is included as a categorical covariate (< 65 years or ≥ 65 years of 
age) suggest that Evusheld PK is not clinically affected by age and does not warrant dose adjustment. 
There were no observed differences in safety and/or effectiveness in older participants compared with 
younger adult participants. Participants aged ≥ 65 years showed slightly lower absorption.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No interaction studies have been conducted. Evusheld is not renally excreted or metabolised by 
cytochrome P450 enzymes; therefore, interactions with concomitant medications that are renally 
excreted or that are substrates, inducers, or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes are unlikely. 
Based on PK modelling, vaccination following Evusheld administration had no clinically relevant impact 
on the clearance of Evusheld. 
2.5.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
AZD8895 and AZD1061 simultaneously bind to non-overlapping regions of the RBD of SARS-CoV-2 
spike protein. AZD8895 and AZD1061 and AZD7442 as combination product bind to spike protein with 
equilibrium dissociation constants of KD = 2.76 pM, 13.0 pM and 13.7 pM, respectively, blocking its 
interaction with the human ACE2 receptor, resulting in a blockade of virus entry and neutralisation of 
the SARS-CoV-2 virus. AZD8895 and AZD1061 and AZD7442 as combination product blocked RBD 
binding to the human ACE2 receptor with IC50 values of 47.7 ng/mL, 79.6 ng/mL, and 65.0 ng/mL, 
respectively. The virus-neutralising activity of AZD7442 and the two mAbs that comprise it were 
assessed against SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020. AZD7442 had a calculated IC50 value of 
10 ng/mL. Data demonstrate that AZD8895 and AZD1061 can independently, or in combination 
(AZD7442), potently neutralize SARS-CoV-2 in vitro. 
Primary pharmacology: Analysis of neutralising antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 
In FITH study D8850C00001, 80% neutralising antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 were measured at 
baseline (Day 1), 7 days (Day 8), 30 days (Day 31), 60 days (Day 61), 90 days (Day 91), 150 days 
(Day 151), 210 days (Day 211), and 270 days (Day 271) after administration of Evusheld in a 
validated live neutralisation assay (PRNT80). No participants had detectable nAbs prior to receiving 
Evusheld. Values below LLOQ were assigned a value half of LLOQ (ie, 10) for the purposes of 
calculating fold-change values post-treatment. At all post-dose time points evaluated after single dose 
administration of Evusheld, the geometric mean titres (GMTs) in participants receiving placebo were 
below the LLOQ of the assay. All 50 participants receiving Evusheld exhibited > 4-fold increases in nAb 
titre compared with baseline at Day 8 and maintained this increase out to Day 211. Participants in the 
300 mg cohorts further maintained this > 4-fold increase from baseline in nAb titre out to Day 271.

In study PROVENT, neutralising antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 were measured after 
administration of Evusheld in the same validated live 80% neutralisation assay used to test samples 
from the Phase I study. Neutralising antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated predose 
(baseline), and at Days 8, 29, 58, 92, 183, 366, and 457 and at illness visits. Up to the DCO, data 
were available from Day 1 through Day 92 after administration of IMP. For participants who developed 
COVID-19, nAb data are available on Day 1 (IL-D1), Day 14 (IL-D14), Day 21 (IL-D21), and Day 28 
(IL-D28) after symptom onset. Results indicate that SARS-CoV2 nAb titres in participants in the 
PROVENT population are similar to those observed in participants from the Phase I study at similar 
post-treatment timepoints. At all timepoints evaluated, the GMT in participants who received Evusheld 
in PROVENT exhibited > 4-fold increases in titre compared with baseline.

At IL-D1, IL-D14, IL-D21, and IL-D28 after symptom onset, participants who developed a case of 
COVID-19 after receiving Evusheld (n = 5) had 12.8, 6.7, 4.4, and 4.8-fold higher GMT than the GMT 
in samples from patients recovering from a SARS-CoV-2 infection, which are similar to the fold 
changes observed in participants receiving Evusheld who did not develop COVID-19. 
In study STORM CHASER, neutralising antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 were evaluated at 7 days 
(Day 8), 28 days (Day 29), 57 days (Day 58), and 91 days (Day 92) after administration of Evusheld 
or placebo. For participants that developed COVID-19, nAb data were also available on Day 1 (IL-D1), 
Day 14 (IL-D14), and Day 28 (IL-D28) after symptom onset. The GMT of participants in this study who 
received Evusheld increased > 4-fold compared with baseline, at all timepoints evaluated. At IL-D1, IL-
D14, and IL-D28 after symptom onset, participants who developed a case of COVID-19 after receiving 
Evusheld (n = 14) had 16.6, 22.4, and 28.4-fold higher GMT than the GMT in plasma samples from 
convalescing COVID-19 patients, which are similar to the fold changes observed in participants 
receiving Evusheld who did not develop COVID-19. 
Pharmacodynamic interactions  
No human interaction studies have been conducted. There is a theoretical risk for PD interaction with 
COVID-19 vaccines (impaired cellular or humoral immune response).

Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The correlation between PK and Neutralising Antibodies was investigated with data from FITH study 
D8850C00001. 
Linear regression model (“Im” function after adjusting the intercept to 1) was used in R studio to fit 
the correlation between 80% neutralisation titre and serum concentration. The correlation line was 
best described as “Regressor”, as opposed to linear regression line. To accommodate the large 
dynamic range of the data with a constant coefficient of variation across the data from low to high 
dose, the regression was performed on log-transformed nAb titre and Evusheld concentration data. 
The analyses show that there is a strong linear relationship between drug concentration and nAb titre 
that is maintained over time. For each Study Day, the upper bound of the 95% CI of the estimated 
IC80 is below the IC80 derived in the in vitro SARSCoV- 2 microneutralisation assay for Evusheld (4 × 
IC50 of 10 ng/mL is 40 ng/mL, assuming a Hill coefficient of 1). The mean IC80 estimates are 35.3 
ng/mL, 27.7 ng/mL, 30.6 ng/mL, 34.6 ng/mL and 36.5 ng/mL, 26.0 ng/mL, and 43.0 ng/mL (based on 
partial data) on Days 8, 31, 61, 91, 151, 211, and 271, respectively. The consistency of the IC80 
estimates over time support that the potency of Evusheld is not compromised over time.

In PROVENT samples were scheduled to be collected on Days 8, 29, 58, 92,169, 366, and 457. Data 
are available so far mostly on Day 8 and Day 29. Similar to the Phase I data, the Evusheld 
concentration is strongly correlated to the nAb titre and is maintained over the first month. The inverse 
of the slope, which reflects the IC80 of Evusheld, was estimated as 33.8 ng/mL and 31.0 ng/mL on 
Days 8 and 29, respectively, and in the same range as those derived in Phase I.

The exposure response relationship of Evusheld for the efficacy endpoint of incidence of SARS-CoV-2 
RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness that occurs within 150 days after a 300 mg IM dose of Evusheld 
(ie, by Day 151) was evaluated for PROVENT. The data used for this exposure-response analysis 
consisted of 663 actively treated participants out of 1637 participants (active and placebo) in the of the 
time-to-event dataset that met both criteria of having available COVID-19 status records and PK data 
over time. In this time-to-event data set, there were 7 COVID-19 positive participants for the 
treatment arm (out of 663 actively treated participants), while there was a total of 18 COVID-19

positive cases in the 1637 active plus placebo participants. For the exposure-response analysis, the 
population PK model individual predicted AUC(0-150) parameter divided in 4 quartiles was correlated 
to the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR- positive symptomatic illness that occurs by Day 151 after a 
300 mg IM dose of Evusheld. Based on the 5-month exposure-response data set, there was no 
exposure-response relationship. 
No exposure-response analysis for safety has been conducted 
Dose justification 
The justification of the Evusheld dose of 300 mg IM for prophylaxis was based on integrating the 
following information: 
1.  The in vitro IC50 of Evusheld for neutralisation of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain measured in 
the microneutralisation SARS-CoV-2 assay at 10 ng/mL.  
2.  Using the upper respiratory tract as the site of interest to prevent any viral load increase and 
therefore any symptoms. 
3.  A VDM-derived minimal required inhibition of viral cell entry of 80% required for prophylaxis 
efficacy.  
4.  The ex vivo derived IC80 of Evusheld by correlating PK and nAb titres measured in the live 
virus SARS-CoV-2 assay in Phase I and Phase III in support of the authentic 
microneutralisation SARSCoV-2 assay results. 
5.  The calculated median serum to NLF partition ratio of 1.81% in the 300 mg IM cohort in the 
Phase I study.  
6.  The Evusheld PK in Phase I and in Phase III that were well characterised by a population PK 
model and supported an extended half-life of ~ 90 days. 
Integrating the information in components 1 to 5 allowed for the derivation of a predicted minimum 
protective serum Evusheld concentration of 2.2 μg/mL. Considering the predictable linear PK of 
Evusheld, the development of a population PK model allowed for long-term prediction of the serum 
Evusheld concentration. This allowed the derivation of the duration of protection by assessing how 
many months the serum Evusheld concentration would remain above the minimum protective 
concentration of 2.2 μg/mL. The PK predictions support that a dose of 300 mg IM will provide 
protection for at least 6 months and that the target serum concentration of 2.2 μg/mL was reached 
within 6 hours in the typical participant and by 28 hours in 90% of participants in the PROVENT and 
STORM CHASER population. In addition, a 2.2 μg/mL concentration was predicted to be exceeded in 
50% of the PROVENT and STORM CHASER participants 12 months after the single 300 mg IM dose.

Data of Phase I and Phase III Studies

To assess the impact of the lower potency or higher IC50 on the duration of protection by Evusheld 
against the Omicron variant, the geometric mean IC50 of 209 ng/mL across 4 available different IC50 
values (FNIH 2022, Dejnirattisai et al 2021, VanBlargan et al 2021) was used. The potency loss of 
Evusheld against the Omicron variant (ie, the duration of protection against Omicron to prevent 
symptomatic COVID-19 or upper respiratory tract infections) is likely to be shorter compared with that 
against the original SARS-CoV-2 strain. However, the duration of protection against Omicron is still 
expected to be maintained if the target site is the lower respiratory tract and the clinical endpoint is 
prevention of severe COVID-19 or death. This prediction is based on the assumption based on 
available data with other biologics that the serum to lower respiratory tract transfer is ~25% and VDM 
modelling. 
Using the IC50 of 209 ng/mL, a required minimal inhibition of 80%, and a partition into lung of 25%, 
an updated target minimum protective serum concentration value was derived to be 3.3 μg/mL. The 
3.3 μg/mL concentration is predicted to be reached in 50% of the participants within 10.5 hours (IQR 5 
to 21 hours) and in 80% of the participants within 24 hours. The viral dynamic model prediction using 
the 25% partition ratio into the lower respiratory tract and the IC50 of 209 ng/mL confirms the PK 
prediction in that a single 300 mg IM dose would still result in protection from severe symptoms if the 
exposure to the Omicron variant occurs 6 months post-dose.

There were few TE ADA+ participants through Day 183 in PROVENT. As such, it was not possible to 
formally assess the potential impact of ADA on PK. AZD8895 and AZD1061 serum concentration time 
profiles of TE ADA+ participants were within the range of ADA
negative participants. Overall, there was 
no apparent effect of ADA on the PK of Evusheld.

Genotypic analyses of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences were derived from a validated GenoSure 
SARS-CoV-2 spike NGS assay (Monogram Biosciences, South San Francisco, CA). For participants that 
developed SARS-CoV-2RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness, SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences are 
available on Illness Visit Day 1 (IL-D1). Variant frequency tables are generated to depict spike-based 
Pango lineages and amino acid substitutions that differ from the Wuhan-Hu-1/2019 reference strain. 
The phenotypic impact of SARS-CoV-2 spike protein sequences changes, including Evusheld binding 
site substitutions, are evaluated in validated pseudovirus neutralisation susceptibility assays. Key 
variants of concern/interest circulating at the time of the studies are further evaluated in research-
grade authentic live virus neutralisation susceptibility assays. 
For activity against variants of concern/interest in research-grade neutralisation assays, see section

Evusheld and 4 placebo) and 3 participants with Epsilon (B.1.427/B.1.429) (2 Evusheld and 1 
placebo). Seven additional participants were infected with B.1.1.519 (1 Evusheld) or the A_1 set of 
lineages containing a constellation of spike protein substitutions including D614G and D138H, Q675H, 
Q677H, or V1176F (4 Evusheld and 2 placebo). 
None of the variants detected under AZD7442 treatment was associated with susceptibility reduction 
>10fold in nonclinical pseudovirus assays. 
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic data are available from 3 clinical studies that evaluated Evusheld for the prophylaxis 
of COVID-19 in adults (18 years of age and older), namely study D8850C00001 (Phase I FTIH) and the 
phase 3 studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER. In addition, a population PK analysis of pooled Phase I 
and III data was performed to characterize the PK of Evusheld and to evaluate the impact of covariates 
such as demographics and renal and liver function tests on the PK exposure.  
Analytical methods 
An affinity purification extraction followed by LC-MS/MS detection was developed and used for the 
quantification of both, AZD8895 and AZD1061, concentrations. Method validation revealed that both 
assays perform with adequate accuracy and precision. The impact of endogenous anti-spike antibodies 
on method performance is considered to be low. Bioanalytical reports for both methods are 
outstanding; Summary information on sample storage, dilutions, performance of analytical runs and 
incurred sample re-analysis for PROVENT and STORM CHASER should be provided when available. 
(REC) For additional detection of AZD8895 and AZD1061 in nasal lining fluid (NLF), the same LC-
MS/MS method was applied as used for serum concentrations. Urea was additionally quantified in NLF 
and serum in order to calculate an extraction efficiency factor for each NLF sample. The method for 
Assessment report

AZD8895 and AZD1061 detection in NLF is qualified but not validated. The use of a fit-for-purpose 
qualified assay can be agreed, as NLF PK was mainly used to determine AZD8895 and AZD1061 
partition rate in the upper respiratory tract (exploratory endpoint). The method passed acceptance 
criteria for within-run accuracy and precision. Experiments on elution from the nasosorption device 
showed adequate recovery.  
For determination of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) of AZD8895 and AZD1061, a 3-tiered approach 
comprising a screening assay followed by a confirmatory assay and the analysis of anti-AZD8895 and 
anti-AZD1061 antibody titre was developed and validated. A bridging ECL assay was applied; relevant 
assay performance parameters including assay cut point, precision, sensitivity, drug tolerance, 
selectivity and sample stability were investigated. Method validation revealed that both assays perform 
with adequate accuracy and precision. Overall, the methods may be suitable for its intended purpose. 
The use of pAb and anti-YTE Ab in addition to anti-ID mAb as positive controls is endorsed. Using 
PROVENT clinical samples, it was demonstrated that both AZD8895 and AZD1061 ADA assays could 
detect low-titre ADA in the presence of drug concentrations as high as 29.740 μg/mL, indicating that 
these assays have sufficient drug tolerance performance for their intended use. The poor drug 
tolerance seen with polyclonal anti-AZD8895 and anti-AZD1061 Abs seems to have little or no 
relevance for detection of ADAs. Confirmed ADA-positive samples are planned to be analysed in a 
separate ligand-binding assay. As neutralising ADAs have not been investigated so far, the method is 
not discussed here. 
Population PK model 
PK data in healthy volunteers (Phase I study [IM and IV arm]) and in participants in the 2 Phase III 
studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER, and in the treatment Phase III study TACKLE were pooled to 
develop a population PK model to characterize the PK of Evusheld. 
The final pooled dataset for analysis included 2527 participants with a total of 7375 Evusheld PK 
measurements. An IM dose of 300 mg was used in the 2 prophylaxis studies (PROVENT and STORM 
CHASER), and 600 mg IM in the treatment study (TACKLE). The Phase I study investigated the PK of 
Evusheld in healthy volunteers with doses ranging from 300 mg IV to 3000 mg IV and 300 mg IM. 
Derivation of the final pop PK dataset is agreed, but deviation from the analysis plan (Appendix D) 
could be detected. There, it was stated that if more than 10% of all concentrations are below LLOQ, 
likelihood methods for imputing the missing data may be considered. The number of samples classified 
as LLOQ that were flagged was N=75, which is less than 10% of total samples, thus the deviation is 
not deemed to be of concern.  
A 2-compartmental model with first-order absorption and first-order elimination for tixagevimab, 
cilgavimab, and Evusheld PK following IV and IM administration was selected as final model to describe 
the PK data. Weight has been included by fixed allometric scaling exponents (CL: 0.75, V:1). Upon 
request, model predictive performances were shown to be comparable using fixed versus estimated 
allometric exponents for the bodyweight covariate. 
Again, deviations in the pre-specified covariates and covariate selection process were detected. 
Vaccination status was added as potential covariate, which is endorsed. Upon request, a comparison of 
PK profiles along with number of participants in vaccinated vs unvaccinated group per study were 
provided, but no comparison of PK metrics. It is agreed from the visual representation, that the 
vaccination status is not indicated to have a relevant impact on PK. No further exploratory analyses 
have been provided by the applicant. The numbers per status was overall balanced in PROVENT (Not 
vaccinated: N=1040, vaccinated: N=813) and would not preclude “vaccination status” to be tested by 
pop PK analysis.

During the covariate model building, covariates that could be clinically relevant, but for which the 
applicant considered number of participants to be insufficient to investigate covariate-PK parameter 
relationship (< 10% of total participants) were not tested. This is not acceptable and should be 
adequately addressed. It is noted that for some of these covariate the absolute number was sufficiently 
high for the covariate effect to be detectable using nonlinear mixed effect approach. The applicant was 
asked to provide the results of covariate testing for CLD, CKD, COPD, 
Immunocompromised/immunosuppressants, COVID-19 status, CVS, and Study. Only the relevant 
subset of the dataset can be used for this purpose. From the data provided, CLD, CKD, COPD, 
Immunocompromised/immunosuppressants, COVID-19 status, CVS, and Study were tested as 
covariate during model development. None of these covariates were retained in the popPK model since 
they did not meet both clinically significant effect size (ie, >20%) and meaningful drop in the OFV 
value (3.84).  
With respect to statistical selection criteria, the level of significance criteria set deviated from the 
analysis plan. Different statistical significance criteria were stated (p=0.01 (or 6.63 of change in OFV 
with df=1, Appendix) and p=0.05 (or 3.84 of change in OFV) pop PK report). The applicant was asked 
to clarify and justify the changes in the significance criteria. The applicant admitted that there was a 
deviation from the analysis plan with respect to the setting of p-values in the covariate selection 
(change from p=0.01 to p=0.05). This has been justified based on the study population (PROVENT) 
that included mostly (75%) subjects with high risk for severe COVID-19 with various co-morbidities. 
Thus, a more lenient p-value was set to more likely identify clinically plausible covariates. The 
stringent one for the backward elimination step was kept (p=0.001) which is agreed. Nevertheless, 
overall the selection (including weight) and correlation between covariates are still of concern. 
During the covariate exploratory analysis, scatter plots highlighting possible relationships between 
continuous covariates was shown as well as some box plots displaying possible relationships between 
selected categorical and continuous covariates. However, the latter was detected to be incomplete. Of 
particular interest is the correlation between diabetes and bodyweight because the two covariates are 
retained on the same PK parameter in the final model. The applicant was asked to provide these plots. 
The box plot provided shows a correlation between diabetes and body weight with higher body weight 
in diabetes patients compared to non-diabetes. Both, body weight and diabetes, were statistically 
significant covariates on CL. However no dose adaptations were proposed for diabetes and the 
allometric exponent was fixed for bodyweight effect on CL. Hence, the inclusion of both body weight 
and diabetes as covariates on CL is not an issue for the current popPK model. ) 
In the same line, a correlation between bodyweight, that was incorporated using fix allometry in the 
base model, and sex was identified. Given this, the applicant was asked to discuss the appropriateness 
of retaining both sex and bodyweight as covariates on the CL and V in the final model. However, no 
dose adaptations was proposed for sex and the allometric exponent were fixed for bodyweight effect 
on CL.  Hence, the inclusion of both body weight and sex as covariates on CL and V is not an issue for 
the current popPK model. The issue will be followed in updated versions of the popPK model. (REC) 
The goodness of fit was assessed by means of diagnostic plots. It would have been of interest to see 
the effect on parameter estimation when TACKLE data were neglected. It seems that these data from 
the treatment study were necessary to stabilize the model structure development and parameter 
estimation.  
The shrinkage and the IIV estimates were very high for V3 and V2, respectively. The applicant thus 
was asked to discuss the impact on the reliability of these parameters. The applicant argued that this 
can be contributed to the addition of sparse Phase III PK data that increased the shrinkage towards 
moderate to high. As expected, sample size has very limited impact on shrinkage of the PK parameters 
of the two-compartment model. Moreover, the applicant did not use Empirical Bayes Estimates based 
diagnostics during popPK model decision making process and thus the impact of high shrinkage will be 
Assessment report

Page 62/155 
 
 
 
minimal and will not influence the reliability of estimated PK parameters (V2 and V3), which can be 
followed. 
Overall, plots indicates the high variability in PK following a fix dose IM. The absorption constant Ka is 
showing a two-peaked distribution and predicted vs observed plots indicate a trend of overprediction of 
observed values for both antibodies. 
From the VPC plots, it is apparent that low PK samples (5th percentile) from PROVENT (300 mg IM) 
are not captures be the model-predicted exposure range, whereas most observation from TACKLE are 
captured (600 mg IM). In light of the VPC plots, the applicant was asked to discuss potential sources 
and characteristics of patients in PROVENT that show low exposure, not captured and explained by the 
covariates included. Data following 300 mg IM from Phase I and comparison should also be taken into 
account. The applicant’s elaboration on low PK samples  following 300 mg IM can be endorsed. 
However, as no bioanalytical reports were provided so far, any bioanalytical reasons for that finding 
cannot be assessed for the time being. Upon request, the applicant provided a sensitivity analysis to 
further elucidate the impact of subjects that showed unexplained “up and down PK profiles” (low 
concentrations followed by an increase at later time points) from the PROVENT study (n = 107, out of 
1870  subjects). As an expected result, the additive error parameter reduced by 2.4-fold (ie, 3.39 to 
1.40 μg/mL). On the other hand, IIV of CL, V2, V3 and Ka is increased (model with excluded subjects) 
compared with the final pop PK model accompanied with some changes in covariate effect parameters. 
As there are remaining issues to be addressed with updated versions of pop PK modelling, and the 
bioanalytical final reports from PROVENT are still pending, this issue should also be readdressed with 
respect to PK data inclusion and final conclusions on covariates, in particular weight effects. (REC) 
From the plots initially provided, it was not apparent how well Cmax after IM treatment and End-of-
infusion is captured. Upon request, the applicant provided VPC plots again but focussing on the very 
early time span relevant for Cmax following IV and IM treatment. However, the plots still were 
presented in a truncated way (Phase I data). Although it is agreed that Cmax following 300 mg IM 
(PROVENT, Phase III) is overall adequately captured and comparable with Cmax following 300 mg IM 
in Phase I, the presented time course shows no absorption Phase. High variability in PK becomes 
apparent in both, Cmax following IV and IM mode of administration, regardless of dose.  
ADME 
In the Phase I study, the estimated absolute bioavailability after a single 150 mg IM dose was 68.54% 
for tixagevimab and 65.79% for cilgavimab. Due to the chosen route of administration Cmax is 
reached with lag time (approximately at day 14), which is considered acceptable for a pre-exposure 
prophylaxis setting. Furthermore, values far lower than Cmax are suggested to suffice for treatment 
effects. These “minimum protective serum concentrations” are estimated to be reached within few 
hours. Volume of distribution was 2.72 L for tixagevimab and 2.48 L for cilgavimab for central 
compartments and 2.64 L for tixagevimab and 2.57 L for cilgavimab for peripheral compartments, 
reflecting the limited ability of extravascular distribution. Estimated values for population median 
terminal elimination half-life (90.6 days for Evusheld, 88.8 days for tixagevimab and 84.4 days for 
cilgavimab) confirm successful half-life extension of the antibodies. Clearance (0.0405 L/day for 
tixagevimab and 0.0412 L/day for cilgavimab) is lower than known for typical mAbs (ranging between 
0.2 – 0.5 L/day) and correlates with the half-life extension of the antibodies. 
PK comparability testing 
The PROVENT and STORM CHASER studies were initiated with cell pools material. Once clonal cell line 
material (the proposed commercial material) became available, this was used in an additional cohort in 
PROVENT to obtain PK and safety data in the prophylaxis setting. A preliminary comparability 
assessment of clonal cell line material was performed. Bioequivalence criteria were met for Cmax and 
Assessment report

AUC0-58d (post hoc provided upon request) for both mAbs, but not for AUC0-91d. PK differences seen 
with AUC0-91d may be at least partly attributed to wide extrapolations conducted for this endpoint. 
Furthermore, subject characteristics of this partial population from study PROVENT were not that 
comparable between both treatment groups as it would have been expected for a classical 
bioequivalence study investigating inter-subject PK comparability. Thus, interpretation of PK 
comparability is somewhat impeded by differences in baseline characteristics. The inter-subject 
variability was high in these subgroups of study PROVENT, with geometric CV% ranging from 71.5% to 
90.3% over the 4 time points sampled (Days 8, 29, 58, and 92). Of note, analytical comparability was 
sufficiently demonstrated, with no difference seen in potency and FcRn-binding assays. Thus, overall it 
can be assumed that the study was not adequately designed to detect potential differences in 
material’s PK performance. Results on PK comparability for Cmax and AUCd0-58 as well as analytical 
comparability indicate that actual differences in material performance should be minor (if any). Final 
comparability analysis is planned to be performed for the final CSR when additional data will be 
available with serum concentrations data through Day 366. 
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
Based on results from FITH study D8850C00001, the pharmacokinetics of both, tixagevimab and 
cilgavimab, are linear and dose-proportional between 300 mg and 3 000 mg following a single 
intravenous administration. Only 1 dose level has been administered via IM route in clinical trials. 
Thus, dose-dependency of absorption cannot be assessed. Evusheld is currently planned to be 
administered as a single dose. No analysis of PK under steady state conditions has been performed; 
the potential for accumulation has not been investigated. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Moderate inter-individual variability for AUC and Cmax was determined in healthy volunteers, while in 
the target population variability was remarkably higher. In the popPK analysis, IIV for CL was 
estimated to 20.9%, however was high for V2 (82.3%) and Ka (47.5%). No intra-individual 
comparison has been performed in the clinical trials with single dose administration.  
PK in nasal lining fluid 
PK data for nasal-lining fluid (NLF) from study D8850C00001 (Phase I FTIH) are so far only available 
for pre-dose, Day 8 and Day 31. The NLF concentration data show that both AZD8895 and AZD1061 
distribute significantly into the upper respiratory tract.  NLF concentration data were used to determine 
the partition ratio. It was shown that partition ratio is dose-independent, mAb-independent, and time-
independent with regard to the time points investigated (Day 8 and Day 31). For the intended 
prophylactic dose of 300 mg IM, the median partition from serum to NLF was calculated as 1.81% for 
AZD7442. The median value for the %partition ratio for AZD7442 from serum to NLF was considered in 
calculations for targeted minimum protective level (2.2 μg/mL in serum for original strain). Based on 
results provided, this approach is deemed appropriate. 
PK in target population 
Preliminary PK data derived from the PROVENT and STORM CHASER trials were provided as data 
summary only. Based on results obtained, concentrations remained above the target serum level of 
2.2 µg/mL for up to Day 183. As PK sampling was not completed at the time of the data cut-off, the PK 
profile is not complete. The development of a popPK model allowed for long-term prediction of the 
serum Evusheld concentration. Furthermore, complete 1-year PK data are available from FITH study 
D8850C00001 and support reliability of long-term PK predictions made based on popPK model.

PK in paediatric target population 
No adolescent PK data are available from AZD7442 clinical trial programme so far. Exposure 
predictions for adolescents weighing at least 40 kg have been based on pop PK modelling. In general, 
paediatric dosing of adolescent patients aged 12 years or older and weighing at least 40 kg based on 
exposure matching with adult exposure can be agreed, as the mode of action and exposure-response 
is not expected to be different between adolescents and the adult population. Due to the lower body 
weight, and the fix dose regimen, slightly higher exposure is expected and was predicted for the 
adolescent subpopulation. Considering the broad safety margins of the 300 mg dose based on 
preclinical and phase 1 human studies, a slightly higher exposure is assumed not to result in safety 
problems. Furthermore, the lower weight limit of subjects that provided data for pop PK modelling was 
40.8 kg. Overall, the administration of 300 mg AZD7442 IM in adolescents weighing ≥40 kg can be 
acceptable. 
PK in special populations 
PK data were obtained for some subjects that became COVID-19 vaccinated in studies PROVENT and 
STORM CHASER. The PK profiles of subjects who were vaccinated post Evusheld dose overlaps with 
those for unvaccinated subjects. Thus, it may be assumed that vaccination status is not indicated to 
have a relevant impact on PK. No further exploratory analyses have been provided by the applicant.  
In general, monoclonal antibodies are not expected to be eliminated via renal excretion due to their 
high molecular weight of about 150 kDa. is expected to be primarily metabolised via proteolysis at the 
cellular level, so that impairment of hepatic clearance is not expected to lead to increased drug 
exposure. It is acceptable that no specific PK studies on renal or hepatic impairment are planned. 
Based on a population PK analyses, the PK profiles were not found to be affected by intrinsic factors 
including sex, race, or ethnicity. PK data from male and female were balanced; most PK data were 
collected from non- Hispanic/non-Latino participants and White. Weight was included in the base and 
final pop PK models assuming fix allometric exponents (0.75 on CL and Q; and 1 on V2 and V3). Mean 
age in the Evusheld PK analysis dataset was 52 years (5th and 95th percentiles: 24 -73). Age (< 65 
years or ≥ 65 years of age) was not found to be a clinically significant covariate. Only very few subjects 
aged 85 years and older were included in trials (N=2 in PROVENT, N=1 in STORM CHASER) and 
became part of the popPK data file for analysis. 
As it was indicated that the applicant did some update from the submitted pop PK model, the 
applicantwas requested to provide the results of PTA analysis using the latest updated POPPK model. 
This model should be based on the most actual PK data considered appropriate in terms of data 
integrity. In addition, as covariate selection was concerned e.g. with respect to inclusion of weight 
effect, a sensitivity analysis should be provided assuming fix allometry and estimated allometric 
exponents. It was clarified that the final model provided for rolling review was used for PTA 
calculations. Nevertheless, the remaining issues need to be addressed using an updated version of the 
pop PK model, when outstanding data become available (REC) 
Pharmacodynamics 
Data including PD (SARS-CoV-2 nAbs), PK/nAbs correlation, immunogenicity, and antiviral resistance 
of Evusheld are available from 3 clinical studies (study D8850C00001 (Phase I FTIH), phase 3 studies 
PROVENT and STORM CHASER). 
The virus-neutralising activity of AZD7442 and the two mAbs that comprise it were assessed against 
SARS-CoV-2 strain USA-WA1/2020 in vitro. AZD7442 had a calculated IC50 value of 10 ng/mL. 
SARS-CoV-2 nAbs 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 65/155 
 
 
 
In the FITH study D8850C00001, the increase in neutralising antibody titres against SARS-CoV-2 
(Strain: BavPat1/2020) was demonstrated to be dose-dependent. Participants receiving AZD7442 at 
the 300 mg IM dose exhibited > 4-fold increases in nAb titre compared to baseline at Day 8 and 
maintained this increase out to Day 271. Importantly, across all doses and timepoints evaluated, the 
levels of nAbs exceeded the mean nAb titres measured in the same assay in SARS-CoV-2 convalescent 
plasma samples. In the PROVENT and STORM CHASER trials, neutralising antibody titres against SARS-
CoV-2 were measured up to Day 92 after administration of AZD7442. Results of phase 3 trials were 
incomplete with the presented data cut-off, with the majority of subjects not yet analysed (not part of 
the “nAbs evaluable analysis set”) and only very few samples analysed for later time points (days 58 
and 92 p.a). At all time points investigated, the geometric mean titre exhibited > 4-fold increases 
compared with baseline. Samples from some participants who developed a case of COVID-19 after 
receiving AZD7442 were analysed with the presented data cut-off. With symptom onset, results were 
similar to the fold changes observed in participants receiving AZD7442 who did not develop COVID-19. 
Considering this data, the relevance of specific SARS-CoV-2 nAb titre values for development of 
COVID-19 is questionable. Results from PRNT50 pseudovirus assays development and validation 
against specific Omicron variants are expected by Q2 2022. In this line, evaluation of relevant clinical 
trial samples (ex vivo neutralisation capacity) should be provided as well. (REC) 
Pharmacodynamic interactions 
As for other mAbs with external target, no PD interaction with concomitant mediation is expected. 
However, there is a theoretical risk for PD interaction with COVID-19 vaccines (impaired cellular or 
humoral immune response). No subjects previously vaccinated against COVID-19 were included in the 
clinical trials. Subjects in phase 3 trials were allowed to receive COVID-19 vaccination after Evusheld 
administration with study progress. Separate presentation of safety results available so far from these 
subjects do not raise concern. Recommendations for time intervals between Evusheld administration 
and subsequent COVID-19 vaccination and vice versa cannot be based on clinical data obtained with 
Evusheld. Thus, decision will need to be based on local/national guidelines. The applicant states that 
no PD interaction with SARS-CoV-2 vaccines is expected based on animal studies. However, as 
discussed in non-clinical assessment report, the performed experiments showed some shortcomings 
and thus, results should be interpreted with caution. Therefore, the lack of clinical information on PD 
interactions with COVID-19 vaccines is communicated in the statement “No human interaction studies 
have been performed” in Section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Exposure-response analysis was performed for 80% SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody titres from FITH 
study D8850C00001 and study PROVENT. A good correlation between plasma concentration and 80% 
SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody titres was expected (as kind of concept proof) and is seen with data 
from both studies. The derived median ex vivo IC80 was close to the in vitro IC80 value measured in 
the SARS-CoV-2 original strain. Noteworthy, based on PD results obtained in subjects with 
symptomatic COVID-19, high neutralising antibody titres are presumed not to be predictive for 
beneficial clinical outcome. 
Exposure-response analysis for the primary endpoint of study PROVENT was conducted, with Evusheld 
AUC0-150 split into quartiles. With the very low number of events under Evusheld treatment (N=7), no 
exposure-response was seen. 
No exposure-response analysis for safety has been conducted. As Evusheld aims at an exogenous 
target, no target-related AEs are expected. For safety parameters investigated (e.g. systemic 
hypersensitivity, SEAs, deaths), incidence was low and exposure-safety analyses are not expected to 
be robust. Thus, it is deemed acceptable not to perform exposure-safety analyses for safety endpoints.

Dose justification 
A viral dynamics model (VDM) has been built in order to describe viral loads during infection. However, 
the model is only based on viral load data published in literature from a limited number of patients. 
Upon request, the VDM has been validated by comparing the predicted mean viral load through the 
VDM to the observed viral dynamics in a human challenge study (Killingly et al 2022). There was a 
reasonably good concordance between the shape and magnitude of the predicted and observed viral 
load in the rising and declining phase of the curve. The peak viral load in the challenge study was 
higher than predicted, because, according to the applicant, the longitudinal samples (used to fit the 
VDMs) indicated the patients were already in the downward phase of the viral load curve. However, 
updated VDM with viral load data gathered throughout their clinical programme and correlation of viral 
dynamics with clinical outcomes, and the effect of Evusheld on viral dynamics/outcomes are pending. 
The updated VDM and outcomes will be available by June 2022. (REC) 
The totality of available in vitro (microneutralisation SARS-CoV-2 assay with original virus strain) and 
clinical information (serum and nasal fluid PK, neutralising antibody titres from phase 1 and 3 trials) as 
well as modelling/simulation (viral dynamic model, popPK) was applied for dose justification. The use 
of a model-based approach to approximate the target exposure attainment is endorsed in principle. 
The herby predicted minimum protective serum Evusheld concentration is 2.2 μg/mL. As Evusheld 
serum concentration decline was considered linear, the popPK model allowed long-term prediction of 
Evusheld concentrations. The minimum serum protective concentration threshold of 2.2 μg/mL was 
predicted to be reached for at least 6 months in 100% of participants, 9 months in 96% of 
participants, and for 12 months in 46% of participants.  
After administration of a 300 mg dose IM, maximal concentrations obtained in clinical trials are greatly 
exceeding (up to approximately 10-fold) predicted minimum serum protective concentration. However, 
presumably due to the exogenous target, they were not associated with safety problems. 
Hypersensitivities and application-related reactions are presumed to potentially occur independent of 
dose. Thus, this kind of “excess dosing” can be acceptable from a safety perspective. Furthermore, a 
comparable “excess dosing” approach was utilised for other mAbs with exogenous target, including 
those approved for prophylaxis of COVID-19, however, requiring more frequent dosing. The long-term 
effect achieved by Evusheld after a single IM dose is considered beneficial in the envisaged pre-
exposure prophylaxis indication. The chosen dose of 300 mg IM is deemed appropriate in the 
prophylaxis setting considering data generated with information from original virus strain. However, 
dose and dosing interval might need to be re-considered with recent/ potentially upcoming viral 
variants showing reduced susceptibility in vitro (see below), that affects the duration over a minimum 
protective serum concentration. 
Dose justification for omicron variant 
External data on in vitro IC50 (pseudovirus and authentic virus) were applied to predict protection 
against the omicron variant. As a geometric mean from results of 4 independent laboratories, an IC50 
of 209 ng/mL was applied for variant BA.1; this is approximately 20-fold higher than IC50 seen with 
original strain (10 ng/mL). Presuming a required minimal inhibition of 80%, and a partition into lung of 
25%, an updated target minimum protective serum concentration value was derived to be 3.3 μg/mL. 
The minimum serum protective concentration threshold of 3.3 μg/mL was predicted to be maintained 
for at least 6 months in 100% of participants, for 9 months in 72% of participants, and for 12 months 
in 13% of participants. It has to be noted that, in contrast to modelling for original strain that was 
basis for dose justification, the low partition rate in the upper respiratory tract (1.81% based on PK 
results in nasal lining fluid) was not considered for predictions on omicron variant, and there is 
uncertainty in the lung partition ratio of 25% as there are data supporting even lower ratios (6.5%,

12%) to be equally justified. No data with Evusheld are available in this regard. Thus, the applicant 
claims prevention of severe COVID-19 or death but not prevention of symptomatic illness (as this 
would require virus neutralisation also in the upper respiratory tract). However, as in a prophylaxis 
setting prevention of COVID-19 (of any severity) is claimed, additional simulation was requested. 
Furthermore, kind of a “worst case scenarios” covering variability in partition rate and IC50 values 
observed across different in vitro experiments (including omicron sub-variants) as well as weight effect 
on PK were asked to be simulated to elucidate how sensitive the duration over minimum protective 
serum concentration would change dependent on the assumptions used for model simulations. IC80 
and the more stringent IC90 should be considered as in vivo PD target for calculation of probability of 
target attainment (PTA) and simulations of (worst case) scenarios for Omicron variants. Additionally, 
simulations should cover IC50 values observed across different in vitro experiments on Omicron sub 
variants.   
In response, the upper respiratory tract was not taken into account for dose justification facing 
Omicron variants. The applicant provided sensitivity analyses assuming lung partition coefficients 
(6,5% and 12%) and mean IC50 (209 ng/mL) and max IC50 (273 ng/mL) of variant BA.1.  
Table 8: 
No further in vitro results were considered for BA.1. In vivo anti-viral activity in terms if IC90 PD target 
was also not considered, although the predictability from the VDM, that was used to derive the IC80 
level, has been questioned. Thus, while the proposed limits for LPR and IC50 values are supported, 
predictions considering a 90% in vivo effect should still be considered unless the viral dynamic model 
is appropriately updated. However, even assuming a PD target of 80%, the simulations indicate that 
duration over an estimated minimum protective level in serum is highly dependent on the assumptions 
used for simulations. No such simulations have been provided for Omicron strain BA.1.1 and BA.2. Of 
note, for BA.1.1 IC50 ranged from 466 (pseudo virus) to 1147 (authentic virus) ng/mL with an up to 
424 fold reduction. In turn, duration of protection is expected to be even more reduced for the 
Omicron variant BA.1.1 compared to BA.1. For variant BA.2, which is increasingly becoming the most 
important strain in Europe, IC50 from in vitro neutralising data for both, pseudovirus (9.8 ng/mL) and 
authentic virus (35 ng/mL), are indicated to be comparable with those for original strains (10 ng/mL), 
neutralising activity is expected to be more comparable as well. However no further 
simulations/predictions including IC90 and assumptions regarding the upper and lower respiratory

tract, have been calculated. No additional data have been provided. Thus, and in absence of 
confirmatory clinical trial data with BA.1.1 and BA.2 variants, probability of target attainment (PTA) 
analyses for all three variants were asked to be provided with special focus on subjects at high weight. 
By considering the results from (worst case) scenarios, the applicant was asked to simulate optimised 
posology for each of the Omicron strains (BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2) that would predict at least 70% of 
the subjects over the minimum protective serum concentration needed for protection over the duration 
of 6 months (300 mg IM and 600 mg IM with respective dosing intervals should be opposed). In this 
line, data from interim analysis on the first 50 participants from a PROVENT sub-study (multiple 
dosing) available in Q2 2022 should be provided (REC). Simulations provided following the latest 
request and including IC90 calculations indicate, that alternative dosing in terms of 600 mg IM – as the 
only additional dose at higher strength with sparse safety data – would not be feasible as a single dose 
or multiple dose treatment option to ensure an acceptable duration of protection against BA.1 and 
BA.1.1. Simulations focusing on bodyweight quartiles have not been conducted with the highest MPC 
(4.8 µg/ml) for the BA.2 strain. Thus, it could not be precluded that the duration of protection patients 
at high weight (>95 kg) is reduced to a clinically relevant level (also for original strains) (REC).  
Immunogenicity 
As per data cut-off June 2021, no patients in the FITH were tested positive for ADAs. However, due to 
limitations seen in the assay, ADA samples may be inconclusive and ADA response might be 
underestimated for high doses in the phase 1 trial. In the target population (studies PROVENT and 
STORM CHASER), ADA results from 989 Evusheld ADA-evaluable participants were available. Overall, 
ADA incidence was low. The majority of ADA-positive participants were classified as non-TE ADA 
positive. Mean ADA titres were rather low (80-320).  
Individual AZD serum concentrations were presented for ADA positive subjects. Concentration vs time 
curves of ADA positives were within the range seen in overall population. The presence of TE-ADAs was 
not associated with hypersensitivities or anaphylaxis. However, most TE-ADAs were detected at later 
timepoints and not in temporal proximity with dosing (were hypersensitivity would be expected). Data 
for ADA positive subjects prior to treatment (non TE-ADAs) were not presented. Overall, it is agreed 
that ADA results from 989 Evusheld ADA-evaluable participants may be sufficient in sample size for a 
statement in the SmPC. The current presentation of ADA results in the SmPC is acceptable. 
Viral Resistance 
Due to the small number of overall events, post-treatment sequencing data from the prophylaxis 
studies are very limited. Preliminary data from patients with breakthrough infections under Evusheld 
treatment do not raise concern. Overall, no conclusion on clinical efficacy in prophylaxis against certain 
variants can be drawn based on available information. Completed results on PROVENT and STORM 
CHASER viral resistance analysis are expected with final CSRs. The current presentation of clinical viral 
resistance data in the SmPC is acceptable. 
The applicant’s plan to conduct continuous reviews of genomic databases such as GISAID for emerging 
Variants of Interest and Variants of Concern (and subsequent phenotypic evaluation by use of in vitro 
assays, if appropriate) is supported. Beyond that, the applicant plans to monitor data on breakthrough 
infections due to emerging variants from all available data sources, including but not limited to: 
Spontaneous cases reported during emergency/post-authorisation use; Clinical trial data from the 
applicant; Studies conducted by public health authorities; Literature. As this is part of the RMP under 
“other forms of routine pharmacovigilance activities for lack of efficacy”, timely information of the 
Authorities will be ensured.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Data package on pharmacokinetics is overall deemed sufficient to characterize the PK of AZD8895, 
AZD1061, and Evusheld (combination of both mAbs).  
PK data and pop PK data analysis indicate linear and dose proportional PK over the dose ranges 
studied with regard to both monoclonal antibodies AZD8895 and AZD1061, respectively (300 mg to 
3000 mg IV, 300 mg IM). Sampling was sufficient to characterize the time course following a single 
dose of each mAb administered IM. Obtained PK parameters are in line with what would have been 
expected for mAbs with exogenous target and half-life extension. 
Long-term PK predictions made based on popPK model were confirmed by 1-year PK data from Phase 
1 study D8850C00001. 
Paediatric dosing of adolescent patients aged 12 years or older and weighing at least 40 kg based on 
exposure matching with adult exposure can be agreed. 
Final PK results from study PROVENT and STORM CHASER are not yet available. Issues identified 
regarding covariate selection and correlation among covariates should be followed in updated versions 
of the popPK model based on the most recent PK data set including currently outstanding PK data.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Clinical data on neutralising SARS-CoV-2 antibody titre indicate that sufficiently high values for a 
treatment effect against original virus strain will be obtained for up to 6 months. A good correlation 
between Evusheld plasma concentration and ex vivo 80% SARS-CoV-2 neutralising antibody titres was 
expected (as kind of concept proof) and is seen with clinical data. 
The viral dynamics model (VDM) was validated by use of observed viral dynamics in a human 
challenge study. However, confirmation of the model with own viral load data generated during illness 
visits in phase 3 studies is still outstanding and so far it has not been established how viral load 
correlates with clinical outcome. 
The totality of available in vitro (microneutralisation SARS-CoV-2 assay for original virus strain) and 
clinical information (serum and nasal fluid PK, neutralising antibody titres from phase 1 and 3 trials) as 
well as modelling/simulation (viral dynamic model, popPK) was applied for initial dose justification. By 
that, the minimum serum protective concentration threshold of 2.2 μg/mL against original virus strain 
was predicted to be maintained for at least 6 months in 100% of participants. However, in order to 
account for reduced susceptibility seen in vitro, additional simulations for omicron and sub-variants 
should be provided. 
Viral sequencing data from the prophylaxis studies are too limited to allow conclusion on clinical 
efficacy in prophylaxis against certain VOC/VOI. Based on provided simulations regarding the duration 
over expected protective serum concentrations against Omicron strains, and provided clinical and PK 
data, however, Evusheld 300 mg IM can be regarded as the appropriate dose to protect the majority of 
patients against multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants including BA.2, with BA.2 becoming the most dominant 
strain across Europe. Alternative dosing regimen of Evusheld are considered not feasible for the 
prevention of COVID-19 resulting from emerging variants including BA.1 and BA.1.1. as there are no 
safety data to support such high doses or multiple dosing, with potential accumulation due to long half-
life, that would be needed to ensure acceptable duration of prevention against these strains. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 70/155 
 
 
 
 
Whether alternative dosing regimen of Evusheld could be appropriate for the prevention of COVID-19 
resulting from emerging variants remains to be determined. 
The risk of viral resistance will be addressed post approval by “other forms of routine 
pharmacovigilance activities for lack of efficacy”. 
There is a theoretical risk for PD interaction of Evusheld with COVID-19 vaccines (impaired cellular or 
humoral immune response) that has not been addressed in clinical trials. 
Data base for ADA analysis is sufficient for a statement in the SmPC. There was a low number of TE-
ADA positive subjects in phase 3 prophylaxis trials.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
Please see list of the recommendations in the appendix at the end of this document.  
2.5.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The efficacy of Evusheld for the prevention of was evaluated in the following studies: 
Two Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, prophylaxis studies: 
o  Study D8850C00002 (PROVENT) 
o  Study D8850C00003 (STORM CHASER) 
The applicant’s clinical development programme was subject to a Scientific Advice procedure with the 
CHMP. 
Key aspects of the pre-Phase III advice and the impact on the PROVENT study: 
• 
The comparability of clinical trial material derived from the cell pools material and material 
derived from a single clonal cell line should be demonstrated. In addition, clonal cell line 
material should be utilised in the clinical programme. Analytical comparability of the clonal cell 
line material versus cell pools material has been demonstrated in vitro. A comparison of the PK 
and safety of drug product derived from clonal cell line material versus cell pools material in 
PROVENT have been provided by the applicant. 
•  Details on concomitant COVID-19 vaccination and subsequent monitoring should be provided 
•  CHMP requested primary endpoint definition in PROVENT to be amended to include all clinically 
apparent and laboratory-proven cases from the time of administration onwards. 
•  CHMP recommended ‘region’ as stratification factor; included as a subgroup analysis. 
Recruitment was not stratified by region to reduce the risk of the Poisson model failing to 
converge. 
Key aspects of the pre-Phase I advise on Study D8850C00001: 
• 
PEI suggested to identify the epitopes and look at circulating strains and track mutations. 
Evusheld binding sites have been identified and SARS-CoV-2 variants and binding site 
substitutions observed in clinical studies are being actively tracked. SARS-CoV-2 spike protein 
sequences from open-source genomic databases are being monitored.  
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022

•  US FDA recommended modifying the inclusion criteria to specify a WHO Clinical Progression 
Scale score > 1, rather than > 0, to avoid confusion. This change was incorporated into the 
protocol. 
2.5.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The phase I study D8850C00001 was designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
pharmacokinetics of AZD7442 in healthy adult participants between 18 and 55 years of age. Dose 
levels were selected based on available in vitro functional potency data and PK data. 
At the time of data cut-off for the interim analysis, 60 participants have been randomised, received the 
investigational medicinal product (IMP) and 59 are ongoing in the Follow-up Period.  
The first participant received their first dose on 21 August 2020. All participants were enrolled at one 
study center and randomised 10:2 to either AZD7442 or placebo administered intravenous (IV) or 
intramuscular (IM), across 5 fixed-dose cohorts: 
•  Cohort 1a: 300 mg of AZD7442 or PBO IM injection: 2 sequential starting with 150 mg 
tixagevimab (AZD8895) / PBO followed by 150 mg cilgavimab (AZD1061) / PBO 
•  Cohort 1b: 300 mg of AZD7442 or PBO IV injection: 2 sequential starting with 150 mg 
tixagevimab (AZD8895) / PBO followed by 150 mg cilgavimab (AZD1061) / PBO  
•  Cohort 2: 1000 mg of AZD7442 or PBO IV injection: 2 sequential starting with 500 mg 
tixagevimab (AZD8895) / PBO followed by 500 mg cilgavimab (AZD1061) / PBO  
•  Cohort 3: 3000 mg of AZD7442 or PBO IV injection: 2 sequential starting with 1500 mg 
tixagevimab (AZD8895) / PBO followed by 1500 mg cilgavimab (AZD1061) / PBO 
•  Cohort 4: 3000 mg of AZD7442 or PBO IV injection: Co-administered IV infusion of 
tixagevimab and cilgavimab / PBO 
Monitoring for TEAEs, SAEs, ADAs is planned up to day 361. 
2.5.5.2.  Main studies 
PROVENT (study code D8850C00002) 
Methods 
PROVENT is an ongoing Phase III, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, study 
assessing the safety and efficacy of a single dose of Evusheld compared to placebo for the prevention 
of COVID-19. This ongoing study is being conducted in 87 study centers across the United States (US), 
United Kingdom (UK), Belgium, France, and Spain. Participants were recruited from Europe (including 
UK) (28.4% of participants in PROVENT and 8.7% of participants in STORM CHASER), and US (71.6% 
PROVENT, 91.3% STORM CHASER).

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
All participants were planned to be centrally assigned to a randomised IMP using an IRT. Before the 
study was initiated, user guides, the log-in information, and directions for the IRT were planned to be 
provided to each study site. Randomisation was planned to be stratified within each of the 2 cohorts: 
•  Cohort 1: Adults ≥ 60 years of age. All participants were considered as being at increased risk 
for inadequate response to active immunisation on the basis of age (presumed 
immunosenescence). Cohort 1 was capped, not to exceed 80% of total participants 
randomised. Within this cohort, randomisation was stratified by residence in a long-term care 
facility or not. 
•  Cohort 2: Adults < 60 years of age. Cohort 2 was capped, not to exceed 80% of total 
participants randomised. Within this cohort, randomisation was stratified by risk of exposure to 
infection with SARS-CoV-2. 
In the initial version of the study protocol, the cohorts 1 and 2 were planned to be capped at 65% and 
50%, respectively. These caps were changed in protocol version 4 (21 December 2020), in order to 
allow more flexible recruitment. 
Neither the participant nor any of the investigators or sponsor staff who were involved in the treatment 
or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the participants were aware of the IMP received. Because 
AZD7442 and placebo were visually distinct prior to dose preparation (due to differences in container 
closure), IMP was handled by an unblinded pharmacist (or designee, in accordance with local and 
institutional regulations) at the study site. Syringe masking was required in order to maintain the 
blind. The IRT provided the investigator(s) or pharmacists a dose tracking number to be allocated 
to the participant at the dispensing visit. Routines for this were described in the IRT user manual that 
was provided to each study site. 
The randomisation code was not to be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the participant required knowledge of the treatment randomisation. The investigator 
documented and reported the action to the sponsor, without revealing the treatment given to the 
participant to the sponsor staff.  
The sponsor retained the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be 
causally related to the IMP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. 
Randomisation codes were not to be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions on the 
evaluability of the data from each individual participant had been made and documented. 
Statistical methods 
The primary efficacy endpoint in PROVENT is a binary response, whereby a participant was defined as a 
COVID-19 case if their first case of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness occurs post-dose 
of IMP and prior to Day 183. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 76/155 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary analysis was planned after approximately 24 primary endpoint events had been confirmed 
across the active and control groups or 30% of study participants had become unblinded (at which 
point the ability to observe primary endpoint events was expected to have diminished), whichever 
occurred earlier. All primary endpoint events accrued up until the data cut-off were included in the 
primary analysis. Thirty percent of study participants had become unblinded by 05 May 2021 (primarily 
due to the participants wanting to be vaccinated against SARSCoV-2) (ie, the DCO for the primary 
analysis). 
The primary efficacy estimate was planned to be calculated as RRR = 100% × (1-relative risk), which 
is the incidence of infection in the AZD7442 arm relative to the incidence of infection in the control 
arm, expressed as a percentage. Efficacy summaries were planned to be presented with a 2-sided 95% 
CI. Statistical significance was planned to be achieved if the two-sided p-value < 0.05. 
A Poisson regression model with robust variance (Zou 2004) adjusting for follow-up time, was planned 
to be used as the primary efficacy analysis model to estimate the risk reduction on the incidence of 
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness occurring post dose of IMP between the AZD7442 
and the placebo groups (see Section 16.1.4 of the SAP). The model was planned to contain the 
planned treatment group and age group at the time of informed consent (ie, ≥ 60 years and < 60 
years) as a covariate. The logarithm of the participant’s corresponding follow-up time at risk starting 
from dose up to the study Day 183 visit was planned to be used as an offset variable in the model to 
adjust for participants having different exposure times during which the events occurred. 
The primary estimand was planned to be used for the analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint. It was 
planned to be based on participants in the full pre-exposure analysis set, defined as all randomised 
participants who received at least one dose of IMP without having had a prior SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-
positive confirmed COVID-19 infection, analyzed according to their randomised treatment. For 
participants with multiple events, only the first occurrence was planned to be used for the primary 
efficacy endpoint analysis. The set of intercurrent events for this estimand was planned to consist of 
participants who became unblinded to treatment assignment and/or took a COVID-19 vaccine or other 
COVID-19 preventive product, in both cases prior to having met the primary efficacy endpoint. The 
intercurrent events were planned to be handled using a while on treatment strategy, where 
participants who experienced an intercurrent event were planned to be censored at the date of 
unblinding/receipt of first dose of COVID-19 product, whichever was earlier, within the primary 
estimand. Absence of data following participants’ withdrawal prior to having met the primary efficacy 
endpoint was planned to be treated as missing and participants were considered as not having the 
event through the time of last observation. Deaths that were caused by COVID-19 and all 
hospitalisations due to COVID-19 were planned to be also considered as primary efficacy endpoints. 
An estimand using the treatment policy strategy, which included all endpoint events, irrespective of 
unblinding and/or vaccination, was planned to be used as the first of two key supportive analyses of 
the primary endpoint and was planned to be included in the multiple testing hierarchy. A second key 
supportive analysis, in which the endpoint was defined as first case of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive 
symptomatic illness or death from any cause post dose of IMP and prior to Day 183, was planned to be 
performed and included in the multiple testing hierarchy. 
The hierarchical approach was planned to include the below analyses as ordered:  
1. 
 the primary estimand, after approximately 24 primary endpoint events have been confirmed 
or 30% of study participants have become unblinded, whichever occurs earlier.  
2.  the first key supportive estimand (treatment policy strategy) 
3.  the second key supportive estimand (including death due to any cause) 
4.  the key secondary efficacy endpoint (incidence of participants who have a post-treatment 
response (negative at baseline to positive at any time post-baseline) for SARS-CoV-2 
nucleocapsid antibodies)

Estimand 
The primary estimand is not a treatment policy estimand, but a “while-not-vaccinated-or-unblinded” 
estimand, excluding events that occur after vaccination. It is understood and acknowledged that the 
applicant made considerations how to best account for unblinding and vaccination. However, a “while-
not-vaccinated” estimand is not necessarily the most relevant estimand for a regulatory decision. It is 
acknowledged that a supportive treatment policy estimand (regardless of vaccination) is provided, and 
this is endorsed. Consistency of the two estimands is expected to provide some reassurance on the 
extent that unblinding and vaccination may have affected results. 
Analysis set 
The primary analysis was done on the so-called full pre-exposure set, comprising all subjects 
randomised and treated who were not infected with SARS-CoV-2 prior to baseline. 
Excluding subjects with evidence of prior infection may be somewhat selective, and does not seem to 
fully reflect a treatment policy, as these subjects were included and treated in the study. However, 
they can be considered a subgroup, and accordingly, no bias is expected in the estimation. Still, the 
selection warrants further discussion: 
Initially it was planned to conduct the primary analysis on the full analysis set (FAS) comprising all 
randomised subjects who were treated at least once, but this was changed in an amendment to the 
Full Pre-Exposure Analysis Set. Upon request, the applicant provided primary and key secondary 
results in the FAS and separately in those FAS subjects who were excluded from the Full pre-exposure 
analysis set. 
Variable and analysis model 
A binary endpoint is considered adequate, the analysis model using a poisson regression is in principle 
acceptable, but adjustment of the model may need further discussion. 
The primary analysis was planned to be adjusted for age and observation time. It is understood that 
due to small incidences the possibilities for adjustment or stratification are limited, but it seems that 
adjustment for the strata of randomisation (residence in a long-term care facility, risk of exposure to 
infection with SARS-CoV-2) was not discussed. Upon request, the applicant provided further analyses 
to assess the impact of those variables on results. Results from these analyses did not raise any 
concern. 
Significance level and multiplicity 
A two-sided significance level of α =0.05 is acceptable. Whether the level of statistical significance is 
considered persuasive for a regulatory decision may also depend on the results of supportive studies, 
as this is currently the only pivotal study. 
The hierarchical testing approach is acceptable. The key-secondray endpoint incidence of participants 
who have a post-treatment response (negative at baseline to positive at any time post-baseline) for 
SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies was added rather late, in protocol version 8. 
Success criterion 
A stricter success criterion was initially planned, but discarded in an early amendment. Prior to version 
3 of the study protocol (13 November 2020), success of the study was planned as follows: 
“Statistical significance will be achieved if the 2-sided 95% CI is > 30%. The success criterion for the 
study will be statistical significance with an observed efficacy point estimate of greater than or equal to 
50%.” 
Such a criterion would not be formally required and it was deleted based on health authority feedback. 
Still, fulfilment could provide reassurance of positive results. 
Missing values and censoring 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 78/155 
 
 
 
Participants who were unblinded to IMP assignment or who were vaccinated prior to experiencing a 
primary endpoint event, were censored at the earlier time of unblinding/vaccination. This is 
appropriate for a while-not-vaccinated estimand under plausible assumptions, but as stated above a 
treatment policy strategy without censoring might be preferred. Both analyses were provided. 
It seems that missing values were not imputed, and in particular missing data on symptomatic 
infection was interpreted as absence of symptomatic infection. This is acceptable and may even be 
conservative in some scenarios. Despite some uncertainty on the potential impact on results there is 
currently no reason to assume that this might have artificially increased the effect estimate. 
Interim analyses and timing of analyses 
There were no interim analysis. During the conduct of the study an unblinded interim analysis was 
added and then removed again (before it was actually conducted). Again, this reflects some 
uncertainty in planning and conduct. 
The planned timing of the primary analysis was adapted during the conduct of the study to be after “24 
primary endpoint events have been confirmed or 30% of study participants have become unblinded, 
whichever occurs first”. It is not fully understood why 30% of unblinded subjects should trigger the 
analysis, as this criterion does not reflect the information accrued. Eventually, unblinding triggered the 
analysis, but the two criteria coincided (there were 25 events), and no concern is raised on this issue.

At the June 2021 DCO, 5031 (95.8%) participants were ongoing in the study, 223 (4.2%) participants 
had discontinued the study, 1933 (36.8%) had been unblinded, and 1475 (28.1%) had received a 
COVID-19 vaccination. Other than COVID-19 vaccination, which was more frequent in the placebo 
group than the AZD7442 group (734 [41.8%] participants versus 741 [21.2%] participants, 
respectively), there were no notable differences between the treatment groups. 
At the August 2021 DCO, 4991 (95.0%) participants were ongoing in the study, 263 (5.0%) 
participants had discontinued the study, 2162 (41.1%) had been unblinded, and 2014 (38.3%) had 
received a COVID-19 vaccination. Other than COVID-19 vaccination, which was more frequent in the 
placebo group than the AZD7442 group (853 [48.6%] participants versus 1161 [33.2%] participants, 
respectively), there were no notable differences between the treatment groups.

Key Supportive Analyses 
Two key supportive analyses were pre-specified in the study protocol within a formal hierarchical 
multiple testing framework to control the Type I error rate. If the primary analysis of the primary 
endpoint demonstrated statistical significance, then the key supportive analyses could sequentially be 
tested at a 2-sided significance level of 0.05. In the first key supportive estimand, participants who 
were unblinded to IMP assignment/took vaccine prior to experiencing a primary endpoint event were 
included and analyzed regardless of their unblinding or vaccine status, ie, all participants were 
included. For the second key supportive estimand, the analysis included first case of SARS-CoV-2 RT-
PCR-positive symptomatic illness or death from any cause post dose of IMP. The 3 analyses of the 
primary endpoint (primary estimand and 2 key supportive estimands) all demonstrated statistical 
significance within the pre-defined testing strategy.

SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid Antibodies 
The incidence of a post-treatment response (negative at baseline to positive at any time post-baseline) 
for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies was lower for participants who had received AZD7442 
compared to placebo, with an RRR of 51.07 (95% CI: 10.57, 73.23); p-value 0.020.

Subgroup Analyses: Key Secondary Endpoint 
Subgroup analyses for the key secondary endpoint were conducted in pre-specified subgroups that 
included age, sex, race, ethnicity, COVID-19 co-morbidities at baseline, SARS-CoV-2 status at 
baseline, high risk for severe COVID-19 at baseline, and various individual risk factors for COVID-19. 
For the key secondary endpoint, the efficacy of AZD7442 versus placebo was consistent across pre-
defined subgroups. 
Ancillary analyses 
Region as a covariate 
The primary analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint was repeated including region as an additional 
covariate to assess the robustness of the efficacy results. The results were consistent with the primary 
analysis and indicated that there was no impact of region on the primary analysis: RRR 76.60 (95% 
CI: 45.81, 89.89); nominal p < 0.001.

STORM CHASER (study code D8850C00003) 
Methods 
STORM CHASER is an ongoing Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 
study assessing the safety and efficacy of a single dose of AZD7442 (2 sequential IM injections) 
compared to placebo for the prevention of COVID-19.  
Participants were adults ≥ 18 years of age with potential exposure, within 8 days, to a specific 
identified individual with laboratory-confirmed symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
and who were therefore at appreciable risk of imminently developing COVID-19. 
Figure 20: STORM CHASER flow chart of study design 
Primary analysis was conducted 30 days after the 25th primary endpoint event was observed. 
a 
An independent DSMB reviewed available safety and efficacy data after the first 100 participants had been dosed, or 
after 4 weeks from first participant dosed, whichever comes first. Enrollment was not paused pending the DSMB’s 
review. DSMB was to meet monthly throughout the study. 
DSMB, Data Safety Monitoring Board. 
Data Cut-off Dates (DCO) for STORM CHASER efficacy analysis: 
Primary DCO (07 April 2021) – is the cut of data that aligns with the primary efficacy analysis. For 
STORM CHASER this was 30 days after the 25th primary efficacy event had been reported across the 
active and placebo groups. At the time of conducting the primary analysis, enrollment was complete 
(last participant in 19 March 2021), and 53 sites in the US and 6 sites in the UK had randomised 1131 
participants of which 1121 received IMP. 
August 2021 DCO (19 August 2021) – is a cut of data to provide longer-term safety and efficacy 
data, providing a median duration of follow-up of approximately 6 months where all ongoing 
participants have a minimum of 5 months’ safety and efficacy data; this was not pre-specified. Only 
key safety and efficacy data are available and included in the primary Phase III CSR. 
Study Participants 
Inclusion criteria: 
Age 
1.  Participants were ≥ 18 years of age at the time of signing the informed consent. 
Type of Participant and Exposure Characteristics 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 93/155 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  Participants were adults with potential exposure, within 8 days, to a specific identified  
individual with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, who 
are therefore at appreciable risk of imminently developing COVID-19, based on available risk 
assessment at time of enrolment, within any of the following settings: 
• 
• 
Long-term care facilities, including skilled nursing homes, assisted living homes, 
facilities, and other staff of such facilities are eligible under this criterion. For 
participants entering the study from these settings, “potential exposure to a specific 
identified individual with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection” is defined to 
mean the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in 
another resident of the facility or in a staff member of the facility. 
Industrial settings shown to have been at high risk for SARS-CoV-2 transmission, 
including but not limited to meatpacking plants. Workers in such facilities were eligible 
under this criterion. 
•  Military settings including but not limited to barracks, ships, or other close-quarters 
working environments. Military and civilian personnel exposed in such settings were 
eligible. 
•  Health care facilities. Health care workers and other staff exposed in such setting were 
eligible under this criterion. 
•  University or college dormitories. Students exposed in such setting were eligible. 
•  Household contacts. Any adult living in the same household as an index case was 
eligible under this criterion. 
•  Other settings of similar close or high-density inter-personal proximity. The potential 
for exposure in such settings may be assessed on a case-by-case basis by 
Investigators. Individuals exposed in such settings are eligible under this criterion. 
3.  Prior to enrolment, participants must not have had COVID-19 symptoms, within 10 days of 
dosing. 
4.  Negative result from point of care SARS-CoV-2 serology testing at screening. 
Exclusion criteria: 
Medical Conditions 
1.  History of laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection or SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity at 
screening. 
2.  History of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome or Middle East respiratory 
syndrome. 
3.  Known history of allergy or reaction to any component of the study drug formulation. 
4.  Previous hypersensitivity, infusion-related reaction, or severe adverse reaction following 
administration of a mAb. 
5.  Any prior receipt of investigational or licensed vaccine or other mAb/biologic indicated for the 
prevention of SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 or expected receipt during the period of study follow-
up. 
6.  Clinically significant bleeding disorder (eg, factor deficiency, coagulopathy, or platelet 
disorder), or prior history of significant bleeding or bruising following IM injections or 
venepuncture. 
7.  Any other significant disease, disorder, or finding that, in the judgment of the Investigator, 
may significantly increase the risk to the participant because of participation in the study, 
affect the ability of the participant to participate in the study, or impair interpretation of the 
study data. 
Prior/Concurrent Clinical Study Experience 
8.  Receipt of any IMP in the preceding 90 days or expected receipt of IMP during the period of 
study follow-up, or concurrent participation in another interventional study. 
Participants were enrolled into one of 2 cohorts: 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 94/155 
 
 
 
 
•  Cohort 1: Adults, ≥ 60 years of age, living in LTCFs. In this context, LTCFs included skilled 
nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and independent living facilities for senior adults. In 
this cohort, “potential exposure to a specific identified individual with laboratory-confirmed 
SARS-CoV-2 infection” was defined to mean the occurrence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, 
symptomatic or asymptomatic, in another resident of the facility or in a staff member of the 
facility. 
•  Cohort 2: Other adults, ≥ 18 years of age with potential exposure to a specific identified 
individual with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such individuals could include but 
were not limited to those living in institutional residences (military lodging, dormitories, etc), 
household contacts, health care workers, long-term care facility workers, and workers in 
occupational or industrial settings in which close contact was common. 
Additional information on exposure to SARS-CoV-2: 
Exposure within 8 days should be confirmed, and investigator attestation that they were able to 
confirm the details of the potential exposure is required. Confirmation should be made either directly 
through the participant’s medical record or via official documentation from another source attesting to 
exposure (eg, letter from employer, notification from local health department, etc). A verbal/written 
statement from the participant, without independent substantiation, is not acceptable. 
Treatments 
A single dose (2 sequential IM injections) of either 300 mg of AZD7442 (n = 756) or saline placebo 
(n = 375), given as two sequential IM injections of AZD8895 and AZD1061, (one in each gluteal 
region), or corresponding placebo. Study staff administered the single dose.

Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
All participants were planned to be centrally assigned to a randomised IMP using an IRT. Before the 
study was initiated, user guides, the log-in information, and directions for the IRT were planned to be 
provided to each study site. Randomization was planned to be maintained in a 2:1 ratio within each of 
the 2 cohorts: 
•  Cohort 1: Adults ≥ 60 years of age, living in long-term care facilities. In this context, long-term 
care facilities included skilled nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, and independent living 
facilities for senior adults. In this cohort, “potential exposure to a specific identified individual 
with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection" was defined to mean the occurrence of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection, symptomatic or asymptomatic, in another resident of the facility or in a 
staff member of the facility.  
•  Cohort 2: Other adults ≥ 18 years of age with potential exposure to a specific identified 
individual with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection. Such individuals could include, but 
were not limited to, those living in institutional residences (military lodging, dormitories, etc.), 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 96/155 
 
 
 
household contacts, health care workers, long-term care facility workers, and workers in 
occupational or industrial settings in which close contact is common.  
Where a participant did not meet all the eligibility criteria but incorrectly received IMP, the investigator 
should inform the Study Physician immediately, and a discussion should occur between the Study 
Physician and the investigator regarding whether to continue or discontinue the participant. 
Neither the participant nor any of the investigators or Sponsor staff who are involved in the treatment 
or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the participants were planned to be aware of the IMP received. 
Since AZD7442 and placebo are visually distinct prior to dose preparation (due to differences in 
container closure), IMP was planned to be handled by an unblinded pharmacist (or designee, in 
accordance with local and institutional regulations) at the study site. Syringe masking was planned to 
be required in order to maintain the blind. 
The IRT was planned to provide the investigator(s) or pharmacists with a dose tracking number to be 
allocated to the participant at the dispensing visit. Routines for this were planned to be described in 
the IRT user manual that will be provided to each study site. 
The randomization code should not be broken except in medical emergencies when the appropriate 
management of the participant requires knowledge of the treatment randomization. The investigator 
was planned to document and report the action to the Sponsor, without revealing the treatment given 
to the participant to the Sponsor staff. 
The Sponsor retained the right to break the code for SAEs that are unexpected and are suspected to be 
causally related to the IMP and that potentially require expedited reporting to regulatory authorities. 
Randomization codes were not planned to be broken for the planned analyses of data until all decisions 
on the evaluability of the data from each individual participant have been made and documented. 
COVID-19 Vaccine 
For prospective participants for STORM CHASER who have not yet been dosed: 
• 
In LTCFs in which an outbreak has been identified, and in which the residents have not been 
vaccinated, STORM CHASER could still be executed because a vaccine will not evoke immunity 
fast enough to protect participants in the post-exposure setting. 
For STORM CHASER participants who have been dosed with investigational product, when an individual 
becomes eligible for the nationally deployed COVID-19 vaccine and the vaccine is locally available: 
Participants will be able to be unblinded if they request this, after a fully informed, objective discussion 
based on all available up-to-date information, and remain in the study. 
•  Unblinded participants who received placebo should be advised that no study-associated 
contraindication to receiving a vaccine exists. 
•  Unblinded participants who received AZD7442 should be advised that the 300 mg dose may 
provide 6 to 9 months of protection, but that this has not been demonstrated. In these 
participants, there would be little or no urgency for receiving a vaccine. In addition, in the 
presence of adequate neutralising antibody titres, an appropriate and effective response to the 
vaccine might be impaired. Such participants should be advised to consider waiting an 
appropriate length of time (6 to 9 months) before receiving an anti-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine. For 
AZD7442, 6 to 9 months will represent 2 or 3 elimination half-lives of the mAbs, after which 
the potential for the mAbs to protect against COVID-19 should be reduced, and after which 
their potential interference with a vaccine may be reduced. 
For participants who have received investigational product (blinded) and develop COVID-19, and are 
sick with it at some point in the study:

• 
There is no reason to believe that administration of a vaccine during acute COVID-19 will 
ameliorate the illness. 
In almost all placebo recipients, and in most mAb recipients, an infection-induced immune 
response will occur, and this response should be protective. At this time, there is no reason to 
believe that the protection afforded by natural infection is less frequent or less robust than the 
protection provided by any vaccine, so the benefit of vaccination may be limited. 
The risk of receiving a vaccine after resolution of the illness should be low. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analysis 
The primary endpoint was planned to be the first case of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic 
illness occurring post dose of IMP and prior to Day 183. The primary endpoint (variable) was a binary 
response, whereby a participant was defined as a COVID-19 case if their first case of SARSCoV-2 RT-
PCR-positive symptomatic illness occurred post dose of IMP prior to Day 183. If a participant’s first 
case of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness occurred on or after Day 183, the participant 
was not planned to meet the primary endpoint 
The primary estimand was planned to be based on participants in the full analysis set, defined as all 
randomised participants who received at least one dose of IMP, analyzed according to their randomised 
treatment. For participants with multiple events, only the first occurrence was planned to be used for 
the primary efficacy endpoint analysis. The set of intercurrent events for this estimand was planned to 
consist of participants who become unblinded to properly consider vaccination for COVID-19, take a 
COVID-19 vaccine or other COVID-19 preventive product prior to having met the primary efficacy 
endpoint. The intercurrent events were planned to be handled using the treatment policy strategy. 
The primary efficacy was planned to be calculated as relative risk reduction (RRR) which was planned 
to be 100% x (1- relative risk). Efficacy summaries were planned to be presented with a 2-sided 95% 
CI. Statistical significance was planned to be achieved if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI was > 
0. 
Absence of data following participants’ withdrawal prior to having met the primary efficacy endpoint 
was planned to be treated as missing. Participants were planned to be considered as not having the 
event through the time of last observation. Deaths that are caused by COVID-19 and hospitalizations 
that are characterised to be severe COVID-19 were also planned to be considered as primary efficacy 
endpoints. 
A hierarchical approach was planned to control for multiplicity of the primary, key supportive, and key 
secondary analyses. The primary efficacy endpoint was planned to be assessed at the primary analysis, 
using the primary estimand. If the statistical significance of the primary efficacy endpoint was 
demonstrated at 2-sided alpha of 0.05, a formal assessment of the primary endpoint using the key 
supportive estimand (treatment policy strategy) was to be conducted also at the primary analysis. If 
the statistical significance of the key supportive analysis of the primary endpoint was demonstrated at 
2-sided alpha of 0.05, a formal assessment of the key secondary efficacy endpoint (incidence of the 
first case of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness occurring after dosing through Day 457) 
was planned to be conducted at the final analysis when all participants have completed the study. 
An interim analysis included in the original protocol was removed in accordance with protocol 
amendment 5 (12 March 2021).

Baseline data 
A total of 548 (48.9%) participants had potential COVID-19 comorbidities identified from their medical 
history at baseline. In addition to COVID-19 comorbidities, the study population was further 
categorised using CDC criteria (CDC 2020). The CDC criteria provide an indicator of individuals thought 
to be at high-risk for severe COVID-19. A combination of data from medical history, concomitant 
medications, and a predefined list collected via the CRF were used.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint was not met. At the primary analysis, the RRR in incidence of SARS-CoV-2 
RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness was 33.31 [95% CI: -25.92, 64.68] with AZD7442 compared to 
placebo, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.212). There were 23/79 (3.1%) participants with 
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness in the AZD7442 arm compared to 17/372 (4.6%) 
participants in the placebo arm.  
The median (min, max) duration from dose of IMP to primary analysis was 49.0 (5, 115) days for the 
AZD7442 group and 48.0 (20, 113) days for the placebo group

Secondary endpoints 
Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive severe or critical symptomatic illness occurring after dosing 
with IMP and prior to Day 183 (Key secondary endpoint) 
During the study the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive severe or critical illness, was low, with 
one event occurring in the placebo arm. 
With updated results for the August 2021 DCO, no additional case had occurred. 
The incidence of participants who have a post-treatment response (negative at baseline to positive at 
any time post-baseline) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies. 
The incidence of a post-treatment response (negative at baseline and positive at any time 
postbaseline) for SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies (produced in response to a natural infection and 
therefore a measure of symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection) was similar in both 
treatment arms, consistent with the primary result.

Table 29: Incidence of Participants who have a Post-Treatment Response for SARS-CoV-2

The incidence of COVID-19-related death occurring after dosing with IMP. 
There were no COVID-19-related deaths occurring after dosing in the AZD7442 arm or placebo arm. 
The incidence of all-cause mortality occurring after dosing with IMP. 
There were no all-cause mortality events in the AZD7442 or placebo arms. 
As apparent from participant flow of the August 2021 DCO, 1 additional all-cause mortality event 
occurred in each treatment group with this data cut-off. 
Ancillary analyses 
The findings from the supplementary analyses for ARR and hazard ratio confirmed the primary analysis 
and also found no statistical difference between AZD7442 and placebo in the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 
RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness. 
Table 30: First SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-Positive Symptomatic Illness: Supplementary Analysis 
on Absolute Risk Reduction, FAS, Primary Analysis 
The hazard ratio for the incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness in the AZD7442 
group was 0.67 (95% CI 0.36, 1.28); p-value = 0.215. The Kaplan-Meier plot shows that there were 
no cases of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illnesses in the AZD7442 group after Day 11 
compared with the placebo group where there were 5 cases. The median incubation period of COVID-
19, from exposure to occurrence of symptoms, is estimated to be 5.1 days (95% CI: 4.5 to 5.8 days), 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022

and 97.5% of those who develop symptoms do so within 11.5 days (95% CI: 8.2 to 15.6 days) of 
infection (Lauer et al 2020). Therefore, the cases occurring in the first 11 days are likely to reflect 
those participants who were probably infected prior to IMP but were SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR- negative at 
baseline as they were still in the incubation period following exposure to the index cases. Cases 
occurring after 11 days are likely to reflect a new exposure to COVID-19 that occurred after IMP 
administration.

Predefined subgroup analysis at the time of primary DCO (07 April 2021) 
Although the study was not designed to detect treatment differences with high statistical power within 
subgroups, analyses were conducted in pre-specified subgroups for the incidence of first SARS-CoV-2 
RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness. 
No statistically significant difference in relative risk was observed for AZD7442 compared with placebo 
for most subgroups, which was consistent with the primary endpoint result. However, a nominally 
significant RRR was observed for the subgroup of SARS-CoV-2 RTPCR status negative or missing at 
baseline. For this subgroup, RRR was 73.17 (95% CI: 27.10, 90.13); there were 6/715 (0.84%) 
participants with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness in the AZD7442 group compared to 
11/358 (3.07%) participants in the placebo group. By comparison, the RRR in participants who were 
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive at baseline was -49.17 (95% CI: -373.27, 52.98).

Full analysis set (FAS; all participants who were randomised and received at 
least one of the planned injections of IMP, irrespective of their protocol 
adherence and continued participation in the study). 
The primary analysis was conducted 30 days after the 25th primary efficacy 
event had been reported across the active and placebo groups. 
The August 2021 DCO was 5 months after last participant dosed, with a 
median follow-up of 6 months. This DCO was not pre-specified; it was 
requested by health authorities after unblinding and all p-values are nominal.

2.5.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The phase 3 studies PROVENT (pre-exposure setting) and STORM CHASER (post-exposure setting) are 
considered as basis for the evaluation of efficacy of the monoclonal antibody combination tixagevimab 
and cilgavimab (Evusheld) for a broad prophylaxis indication. Both studies investigate a single dose of 
300 mg Evusheld IM, i.e. 2 sequential 150 mg IM doses of tixagevimab and cilgavimab, respectively.  
The submitted date on efficacy are based on 2 data cut-offs: The first cut-off (primary DCO) is the 
time point of the primary efficacy analyses at which 30% of all study participants had become 
unblinded (PROVENT) or 25 subjects had a primary endpoint event (STORM CHASER). The following 
cut-off (August 2021 DCO) provides a minimum of 5 months efficacy follow-up data; It was not pre-
specified and adapted based on Evulsheld’s level of development in the context of other emerging 
therapies. Longer follow up of subjects is still ongoing at the time of the present assessment. 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
PROVENT is an ongoing Phase III, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, 
multinational study assessing the efficacy of a single dose of Evusheld compared to placebo for the 
prevention of COVID-19 in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting. The use of placebo as comparator is 
endorsed in the studied population, as the study started the recruitment in November 2020 where no 
approved prophylaxis treatment was available. Overall, the study design is considered adequate 
regarding the evaluation of Evusheld in the pre-exposure prophylaxis setting.  
The inclusion criteria were chosen to represent a population on higher risk for inadequate response to 
active immunization (included ≥ 60 years old, BMI ≥ 30, congestive heart failure, COPD, GFR < 30  
mL/min/1.73 m2, chronic liver disease, immunocompromised state, intolerant of vaccine) or 
appreciable risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. Subjects were to be unvaccinated and 
seronegative for SARS-CoV-2, adult and non-pregnant/not breast-feeding. The eligibility criteria are 
considered adequate to define a representative study population that could benefit from a passive 
immunization with Evusheld in a time where active immunization was not yet available. 
The objectives and endpoints are clearly defined and appropriate to investigate the efficacy of a single 
dose of Evusheld relative to placebo. The primary endpoint was a binary response, whereby a 
participant is defined as a COVID-19 case if their first case of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive 
symptomatic illness occurs post dose of IMP prior to Day 183. The presented definition of qualifying 
symptoms for the primary endpoint is acceptable; symptoms are rather unspecific but will be counted 
as primary endpoint event only in combination with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR result. The key 
secondary endpoint aimed at detection of a host immune response to SARS-CoV-2 after administration 
of the study drug and was introduced in the multiple testing hierarchy with protocol amendment 7 in 
June 2021. With the same amendment, longer observation of COVID-19 prevention (until day 366) 
was removed from the multiple testing hierarchy and became an exploratory endpoint only. By that, 
the time point for participants’ unblinding became more flexible which is comprehensible in light of the 
fact that alternative treatment options, e.g. vaccines became available. Further secondary endpoints 
presented with the present data cut-offs are considered adequate to support the efficacy analyses by 
investigation of progress to severe disease (e.g. incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive severe or 
critical symptomatic illness/COVID-19-related Emergency Department visits).  
Overall, 5150 participants were planned to be randomised (Evusheld: n = approximately 3433; 
placebo: n = approximately 1717). The planned sample size appears reasonable. The sample size and 
power considerations, as well as considerations around the timing of analysis were amended several 
times during the conduct of the study. This indicates that the study was planned and conducted with 
relevant uncertainty. It was planned to conduct a blinded sample size re-estimation, in order to 
mitigate uncertainty around the assumptions. The protocol contained considerations on potential risks 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 118/155 
 
 
 
to the study integrity, and these are generally endorsed and agreed. It is acknowledged that 
considerations were made on expected unblinding and vaccination and it was clarified upon request 
that only blinded information on outcomes (overall rates) and extent of unblinding were used in the 
revisions of the planned analysis time. While the extent of participant unblinding and the substantial 
reduction in information are not optimal, it is considered unlikely that any opportunistic choices could 
have been made and only small uncertainty remains. The overall sample size was only little affected by 
the changes (initial estimation: n=5000; re-estimation and final choice: n=5150). 
A 2:1 (verum:placebo) randomization ratio may not be optimal in terms of power and precision, but 
does not per se raise any concerns. Randomization was stratified within 2 cohorts that were based on 
patient’s age at baseline (<60/≥60 years). The number of strata seems feasible with the overall 
sample size and stratified recruitment (i.e. a sample size cap at 80%) for the 2 cohorts is reasonable. 
However, randomization was not stratified for region or study site. The applicant acknowledged that 
rapid emergence and spread of variants was not anticipated at the planning stage, but that it was 
expected that the pandemic would be similar in the study regions as these are all on the northern 
hemisphere. Study results (baseline characteristics, subgroup analysis on primary endpoint) do not 
indicate any major impact of geographic region. Nonetheless, some uncertainty remains, as incidences 
and governmental measures could have been different across regions throughout the course of the 
study and it is not fully clear how that might have affected the estimation. Irrespective, it is agreed 
that this does not change the overall interpretation. 
Blinding procedures were appropriately defined. However, participants were unblinded during the 
ongoing study, to allow for an individual decision for the best timing of COVID-19 vaccination. For the 
primary analysis, participants who were unblinded to IMP assignment or who were vaccinated prior to 
experiencing a primary endpoint event, were censored at the earlier time of unblinding or vaccination. 
Thus, the primary estimand is not a treatment policy estimand, but a “while-not-vaccinated-or-
unblinded” estimand, excluding events that occur after vaccination. A supportive treatment policy 
estimand (regardless of vaccination) is provided and consistency of the two estimands provides some 
reassurance on the extent that unblinding and vaccination may have affected results.  
The statistical analyses are in principle supported. Initially it was planned to conduct the primary 
analysis on the full analysis set (FAS), but this was changed in an amendment to the “Full Pre-
Exposure Analysis Set”, comprising all subjects randomised and treated who were not infected with 
SARS-CoV-2 prior to baseline. Initially, the applicant  aimed at a broad prevention indication statement 
including all asymptomatic subjects (irrespective of SARS-CoV-2 PCR status. Thus, results of SARS-
CoV-2 PCR positive subjects were of interest and were provided upon request. The analysis model 
using a poisson regression is in principle acceptable. Uncertainty due to stratification factors not being 
accounted for in the analysis could be largely resolved by additional analyses. A two-sided significance 
level of α =0.05 is acceptable. However, whether the level of statistical significance is considered 
persuasive for a regulatory decision may also depend on the results of supportive studies or analyses, 
as PROVENT was the only study in a pre-exposure setting. A stricter success criterion (point estimate 
>50% and lower bound of 95% confidence interval >30%) was initially planned, but discarded in an 
early amendment based on Health Authority Feedback. Such a stricter criterion would not be formally 
required; the final choice (null hypothesis testing no difference between Evusheld and placebo) is 
deemed acceptable. Still, this may reflect uncertainty at planning and conduct of the study. It seems 
that missing values were not imputed, and in particular, missing data on symptomatic infection was 
interpreted as absence of symptomatic infection. This is acceptable and may even be conservative in 
some scenarios. Despite some uncertainty on the potential impact on results, there is currently no 
reason to assume that this might have artificially increased the effect estimate. The planned timing of 
the primary analysis was adapted during the conduct of the study to be after “24 primary endpoint 
events have been confirmed or 30% of study participants have become unblinded, whichever occurs 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 119/155 
 
 
 
first”. It is not fully understood why 30% of unblinded subjects should trigger the analysis, as this 
criterion does not reflect the information accrued. Eventually, unblinding triggered the analysis, but the 
two criteria coincided (there were 25 events), and no concern is raised on this issue. 
STORM CHASER is an ongoing Phase III, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter 
study assessing the efficacy of a single dose of Evusheld (2 sequential IM injections) compared to 
placebo for the prevention of COVID-19 in post-exposure prophylaxis setting. 
The chosen population seems overall adequate for investigation of a post- exposure prophylaxis setting 
in adults. Participants were to be at risk of imminently developing COVID-19, as they were in contact 
with a subject with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection within 8 days. Risk may vary between subjects as 
contact persons could have been both, symptomatic or asymptomatic and included household contacts, 
as well as other residents of a long-term care facility, staff members of a long-term care facility, other 
workers in industrial setting, and university or college dormitories. As index cases were not part of the 
study, it cannot further be retraced how differences in risk of exposure might be reflected by study 
results. No criterion was chosen to exclude subjects with a positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test at 
screening. Thus, the chosen population was allowed to include subjects that were already infected, but 
asymptomatic. Otherwise, eligibility criteria were similar to the ones in study PROVENT. 
The same primary endpoint as in study PROVENT was applied and is considered adequate. It should be 
notated that due to the relatively long investigation period (183 days) also potentially unknown cases 
of exposure resulting in symptomatic COVID-19 at a later time points (i.e. in a pre-exposure setting) 
will be counted for the primary endpoint. The key secondary endpoint investigates whether Evusheld 
may inhibit severe or critical COVID-19 until day 183 p.a.. The chosen definition for severe/critical 
illness is acceptable: patients need to be hospitalised, with pneumonia or hypoxia and under 
respiratory support (at least oxygen by mask or nasal prongs) to be counted as event. The 
investigation of deaths (all-cause or COVID-19 related) as well as occurrence of asymptomatic disease 
(by nucleocapsid antibodies) as secondary endpoints is deemed appropriate in the chosen population. 
Up to 1125 participants were planned to be randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single IM dose of 
Evusheld (n = approximately 750) or placebo (n = approximately 375). The sample size calculations 
were based on the primary efficacy endpoint and were derived following a modified Poisson regression 
approach. The sample size considerations appear reasonable and are overall acceptable. The need to 
plan a sample size re-estimation reflects uncertainty at the planning stage. 
Also here, a 2:1 (verum:placebo) randomization ratio was planned. A randomization in 2 cohorts 
(“adults ≥ 60 years of age, living in long-term care facilities” and “all other adults”) was planned. With 
initial planning, the percentage of subjects ≥ 60 years of age living in long term care facilities had to 
be between 50 and 80% of overall population. This requirement was removed in 2 steps (with protocol 
amendments 3 and 5) due to availability of an efficacious vaccine for this vulnerable population and 
finally, the large majority (1114 [99.4%]) of participants included in the study were enrolled under 
Cohort 2 (“all other adults”). Again, randomisation was not stratified for region or study site; 
discussions provided for PROVENT study above also apply here. 
Blinding procedures are acceptable. In order to receive a COVID-19 vaccine, participants were able to 
be unblinded if they request this. In contrast to study PROVENT, unblinded subjects were not censored 
in the primary analysis. However, at the primary DCO, there were no participants with primary events 
occurring post unblinding and 2 participants, both on placebo arm, who discontinued trial early after 
unblinding Thus, based on these results the impact of unblinding on primary endpoint analysis is 
expected to be marginal. 
The statistical methods seem overall reasonable. The analysis population, comprising all participants 
who were randomised and treated is supported. This is considered close to a treatment policy 
Assessment report

Page 120/155 
 
 
 
estimand. The primary analysis model is in principle acceptable. However, it is not adjusted for any 
baseline covariates. This is not optimal, provided that regional or study site heterogeneity could be 
expected. The significance level of α=0.05 is acceptable, but was not met. Thus, any findings should 
be interpreted in a descriptive manner and with care. Of note, initially a stricter criterion (lower bound 
of 2-sided 95% CI > 30%, plus point estimate >50%) was defined, but this was removed in a protocol 
amendment. While this criterion would not be required for approval, the changes may reflect some 
uncertainty in the planning and conduct of the study. The analysis was initially planned after 90 
events. This was reduced 2 times with ongoing study and in the end, an analysis 30 days after 
observing 25 events was planned in protocol version 6.0. Considerations around the timing of the 
analysis may also reflect uncertainty and may indicate that the trial faced difficulties in accruing the 
necessary cases. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The PROVENT study is still running. 5973 participants were screened, 5254 thereof were randomised. 
Most screen-failures had not met the eligibility criteria. A minority of 1.1% were randomised, but not 
treated and 2.8% discontinued their participation, mainly due to participant’s withdrawal or lost to 
follow-up. At the August 2021 DCO, 2162 (41.1%) had been unblinded but the majority was still 
ongoing in the study (95.0%). With the presented data cut-off, 5109 (97.2%) study subjects are 
ongoing in the study, and no patient completed.  
The full analysis set (FAS) includes 3460 participants randomised to the Evusheld group and 1737 
randomised to the PBO group; numbers were only slightly different for the “Full Pre-Exposure Analysis 
Set” (including non-infected subjects only) used for the primary analysis (3441 and 1731 subjects).  
Almost 30% of the participants in each treatment group had one major protocol violation. An additional 
estimand was provided upon request, in which participants who had any important protocol deviation 
at any time were excluded from the analysis. As results are consistent with the results of the primary 
analysis the impact of protocol deviations on data integrity is considered insignificant. 
The patient population was balanced as to age (<60 years 56.6%, >60 years 43.4%), gender (female 
46.1%, male 53.9%) and the remainder of baseline characteristics. The majority was White (73%) and 
obese (72.9%) with a mean BMI of 30 kg/m2. Overall, the majority of subjects (77.5%) was 
considered to be at increased risk for progression to severe COVID-19 due to underlying medical 
conditions. The definition of this high-risk population based on CDC criteria is endorsed. Patients with 
immunosuppressive disease or treatment, as a population that is presumed to benefit from a passive 
immunization, were underrepresented (0.5% and 3.3%). 
At the primary analysis, there was a statistically significant reduction in incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RT-
PCR-positive symptomatic illness for participants who had received Evusheld compared to placebo, 
RRR 76.73 (95% CI: 46.05, 89.96; p < 0.001). Overall numbers were low: 8/3441 (0.2%) participants 
assigned to the Evusheld group and 17/1731 (1.0%) subjects in the placebo group experienced an 
event. Of note, the 95% confidence interval excludes 30% and the point estimate is greater than 50%. 
These criteria were initially defined as success criteria and dropped in an amendment. Although 
fulfilment of the criteria is not required, this supports the conclusion of a prophylactic treatment effect. 
The results of the primary analysis results are in some ways substantiated by those obtained at the 
second data cut-off (August 2021 DCO) and the key supportive analyses, respectively. Data collected 
and analysed at the August 2021 DCO (median duration of follow-up of 196 days in both treatment 
arms) provide evidence that the treatment effect of Evusheld was sustainable, i.e. RRR was 82.80 (CI 
46.79, 91.35). As the primary analysis population excluded subjects tested PCR-positive at baseline, 
but PCR testing is not foreseen in clinical practice, the applicant provided upon request results all

treated subjects, irrespective of PCR-status, at the August 2021 DCO. Results did not raise concern, 
but suggest a somewhat smaller benefit, i.e. RRR= 78.16 (58.96, 88.38). These results are considered 
more relevant and have been included in the SmPC. As shown by Kaplan-Meier-plots, the time to first 
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positive symptomatic illness is delayed in the Evusheld group compared to 
placebo with consistent results over time (until August 2021 DCO) (HR 0.23 (95% CI: 0.10, 0.53); p-
value < 0.001). Furthermore, results of the primary analysis are substantiated by the primary analysis 
adjusted by region as well as the findings from the supplementary analysis for the absolute risk 
reduction. It is not fully clear how the large extent of unblinding might have affected results. In the 
primary analysis, participants were censored at the time of (voluntary) unblinding or vaccination 
(whichever occurred earlier). Additional analyses without censoring lead to similar results, only minor 
uncertainty remains. Subgroup analyses do not raise concerns on potential heterogeneity of the 
treatment effect across subgroups. However, this should be interpreted with caution, as the overall 
number of events is small. As subjects with immunosuppressive disease or treatment were 
underrepresented, results do not allow data-based conclusion for these subjects.  
The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid antibodies (as a measure of symptomatic and 
asymptomatic infections) was lower for participants who had received AZD7442 compared to placebo, 
with an RRR of 51.07% (95% CI: 10.57, 73.23; p-value 0.020). This key secondary endpoint was 
included in hierarchy in a late amendment (protocol version 8) and can be considered confirmatory. As 
evident from Kaplan-Meier-plots, the incidence was comparable between both treatment groups until 
day 60. Afterwards, the Evusheld group reached a plateau whereas in the placebo group more positive 
tests were reported.  
The effect of Evusheld on disease progression is currently unknown, as results of other secondary and 
exploratory endpoints “Incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-Positive Severe or Critical Symptomatic 
Illness After Dosing With IMP” and “Incidence of COVID-19-related Emergency Department Visits 
Occurring After Dosing With IMP” are not interpretable due to very few events in both treatment 
groups. At least no negative signals were detected with the presented DCO that would raise any 
concern.  
Data on SARS-CoV-2 viral loads in infected subjects are currently sparse. At all timepoints, viral load 
(determined as viral genome copies in NP swabs) was numerically lower in patients treated with 
Evusheld compared to placebo. However, sample size is extremely low and chance findings are likely. 
Currently it is not established how viral load correlates with clinical outcomes and thus, relevance of 
this endpoint is deemed low.   
In study STORM CHASER, less than 1% of the subjects were randomised but not dosed. As number of 
early discontinuations was overall moderate and slightly lower in the Evusheld group compared to the 
placebo group, these results do not raise concerns. At the timing of the primary analysis, the number 
of unblinded subjects (in order to receive COVID-19 vaccination or for other unknown reasons) was 
higher in the placebo group (14.1%) compared to the Evusheld group (8.2%). As discussed above, as 
a result of unblinding, an effect on patient behavior (and thus potential exposure) cannot be excluded. 
The full analysis set (for primary efficacy analysis) and safety analysis set are identical. The large 
majority of randomised subjects (>99%) was dosed and became part of the 2 analysis sets (SAS, 
FAS). Treatment arms together included 1121 subjects (Evusheld N=749, placebo N=372). 
According to the data provided, demographics were balanced across Evusheld treatment group and 
placebo group. Approximately half of the subjects were female and approximately 20% were ≥ 60 
years old. Overall, only 10 subjects living in a long-term care facility were included, which is far away 
from initial study planning (i.e. 50-80% of subjects living in a long-term care facility). The majority of 
subjects had a negative SARS-CoV-2 PCR test at baseline (86.9%), with a comparable percentage in 
both treatment groups (86.2% for Evusheld group vs 88.2% for PBO group). Thus, no impact on 
Assessment report

investigated treatment effect is expected. Approximately 65% of the subjects were considered to be at 
an increased risk due to underlying medical condition, with a comparable percentage in both treatment 
groups. Obesity, hypertension, smoking and diabetes were the most prominent risk factors in the 
enrolled population. Overall, only 9 subjects under immunosuppressive treatment and no subjects with 
immunosuppressive disease were included. When compared to the study PROVENT, the STORM 
CHASER population was younger (median 48 vs 57 years), less at risk for disease progression due to 
underlying medical conditions (65.7 vs 77.5%), had a lower proportion of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR 
negatives (86.9 vs 96.3%) and a higher proportion of Hispanic/Latino subjects (57.5 vs 14.5%). 
The primary endpoint was not met: At the primary analysis, the RRR in incidence of SARS-CoV-2 RT-
PCR-positive symptomatic illness was 33.31 [95% CI: -25.92, 64.68] with Evusheld compared to 
placebo, which was not statistically significant (p = 0.212). There were 23/79 (3.1%) participants with 
SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness in the Evusheld arm compared to 17/372 (4.6%) 
participants in the placebo arm. The median (min, max) duration from dose of IMP to primary event 
was comparable: 49.0 (5, 115) days for the Evusheld arm and 48.0 (20, 113) days for the placebo 
arm. Thus, efficacy of Evusheld in the post-exposure prophylaxis setting could not be demonstrated in 
the chosen population and the broad indication statement cannot be agreed. 
Furthermore, Evusheld was not able to prevent symptomatic or asymptomatic infection detected as 
post-baseline nucleocapsid antibodies until day 183 in the post-exposure prophylaxis setting. 
Approximately 5% of subjects were positive for nucleocapsid antibodies in both, the Evusheld and the 
placebo group. 
No statement on Evusheld’s effect on incidence of severe or critical symptomatic illness (key secondary 
endpoint) or deaths (COVID-19-related and all cases, other secondary endpoints) is possible, as almost 
no such cases occurred. With an overall number of 25 events of symptomatic illness (primary DCO), 
the sample size was too small for investigation of disease progression/death. 
A similar impression as by the primary analysis was given by the supplementary analysis on absolute 
risk reduction and the updated August 2021 DCO data. Kaplan-Meier plot of the time to first SARS-
CoV-2 RT-PCR positive symptomatic illness illustrates that Evusheld was not able to prevent 
symptomatic infections when administered post-exposure: There is no obvious difference in the 
Evusheld curve compared to the PBO curve considering the 4 weeks after treatment. The applicant 
highlights that with the primary DCO there were no cases of SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive 
symptomatic illnesses in the AZD7442 group after Day 11 compared with the placebo group where 
there were 5 cases and these should reflect cases with exposure after IMP administration (pre-
exposure setting). Although this is agreed for this data snapshot, it does not hold true for the longer 
observation period presented with August 2021 DCO, where 4 additional cases occurred in the 
Evusheld group. However, as slightly less new cases occurred in the Evusheld group (4/749) compared 
to the placebo group (6/372) since timing of the primary analysis, these results might tend to show a 
beneficial treatment effect of Evusheld in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting. Nevertheless, due to the 
overall very low number of cases and the post-hoc nature of these analyses, findings are highly 
uncertain, and results should be perceived with great care. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier plot of the 
August 2021 DCO indicates that all new cases in the Evusheld group occurred later than d120 p.a., 
questioning somewhat the claimed long-term protective effect of Evusheld. 
A predefined subgroup analysis at the timing of the primary analysis excluded subjects with SARS-
CoV-2 RT-PCR status positive at baseline and showed a nominally statistically significant difference for 
Evusheld compared to placebo. In the subgroup SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR status negative or missing at 
baseline there were 6/715 (0.84%) participants with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR-positive symptomatic illness 
in the Evusheld arm compared to 11/358 (3.07%) participants in the placebo arm. As these subjects 
share SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR status with the PROVENT population (96.3% SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 123/155 
 
 
 
negatives), these subgroup results do not raise concern for the Evusheld prevention indication and 
might be considered as supportive. However, results should be interpreted with great caution. As this 
was a subgroup analysis only, the explorative character of such an analysis needs to be emphasised. 
In contrast, half of the subjects with positive SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test prior to treatment had a 
primary event in the Evusheld group (17/34; 50.00%) while 42.86% (6/14) had an event in the 
placebo group. Furthermore, no positive tendency was seen for subjects not at risk for progression to 
severe COVID-19 and there was a tendency of less treatment effect in the younger population.  
Thus, based on these data and in absence of relevant data from study PROVENT (SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR 
positive subjects excluded from primary analysis), subjects with SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR status positive 
were requested to be excluded from an indication statement for the planned prevention indication. In 
response, the applicant restricted the indication to pre-exposure prophylaxis. However, he also 
proposed to waive the request for a mandatory SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR test with regard to results of the 
TACKLE study and circumstances in a real-world setting, i.e. timely availability of this test, and thus, a 
potential delay of an administration. This rationale can be followed. 
2.5.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Evidence for efficacy of Evusheld in the prophylaxis setting has been generated in 2 pivotal studies 
investigating treatment effect on prevention of COVID-19 (any severity). Even though various design 
changes were performed in the running study, they did not have the potential to impact study results 
to an extent that would make the entire conclusion on efficacy questionable.  
In study PROVENT, investigating pre-exposure prophylaxis setting, Evusheld demonstrated a 
statistically significant effect for the primary endpoint (RRR% (95%CI): 76.73 (52.01, 89.25)) as well 
as signs of efficacy across all secondary/exploratory endpoints studied and supportive/ancillary 
analysis performed. In contrast, study STORM CHASER, investigating the post-exposure prophylaxis 
setting, failed to meet its primary endpoint ((RRR% (95%CI): 33.31 (-25.92, 64.68)). This is mainly 
attributed to the small subgroup of already infected but asymptomatic subjects (positive SARS-CoV-2 
RT-PCR test prior to treatment), from whom half (17/34; 50%) developed COVID-19 despite Evusheld 
treatment. Hence, the lack of efficacy seen in post-exposure setting and the negative signals seen in 
PCR positive subjects had raised concern against the proposed broad indication including individuals 
irrespective of exposure or PCR test result. However, the major objection was solved as the applicant 
accepted the indication proposed by the Committee (see discussion above).  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
Please see the list of recommendations in the appendix at the end of this document  
2.5.8.  Clinical safety 
2.5.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Due to the nature of the drug product, exposure for all participants included in the safety analysis set 
in each study was 100%. 
Two data cut-offs (DCO) are used regarding the analysis of safety data: 
• 
PROVENT: 1st DCO: 29 June 2021, 2nd DCO: 29 August 2021 
•  STORM CHASER: 1st DCO: 19 June 2021, 2nd DCO: 19 August 2021. 
Participants in both studies received a single dose of either 300 mg of Evusheld or saline placebo. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022

During PROVENT up to 1st DCO, 5172 participants had been dosed with IMP. At the time of 1st DCO 
used for the primary STORM CHASER CSR (19 June 2021), 1121 participants had been dosed with IMP. 
In total, pooled safety data is available from 6318 patients. Further safety data is available at 2nd DCO 
providing a minimum of 5 months safety follow-up for all ongoing participants (see Table below). 
Table 35: Extent of Exposure and Follow-Up (DCO June 2021) 
Demographics: Phase III Studies 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics of the participants are summarised in Table above for 
PROVENT and STORM CHASER, respectively (please see Clinical efficacy). 
Across both studies, 4742 (75.1%) participants were recruited from the US (PROVENT 3719 [71.6%], 
STORM CHASER 1023 [91.3%]), and 1576 (24.9%) were recruited from Europe (including United 
Kingdom) (PROVENT 1478 [28.4%], STORM CHASER 98 [8.7%]). Overall, the median (min, max) age 
of participants was 55 (18, 99) years. Most participants were male (53.3%) and white (75.0%).

The study population in PROVENT, when compared to STORM CHASER, comprised participants with a 
higher median age (57 vs 48 years), a higher proportion who were Black or African American (17.3% 
vs 10.0%), a lower proportion who were Hispanic or Latino (14.5% vs 57.5%), a higher proportion 
who had COVID-19 co-morbidities at baseline (67.7% vs 55.8%), a higher proportion who were high 
risk for developing severe COVID-19 (77.5% vs 64.8%), and a higher proportion who were SARS-CoV-
2 RT-PCR negative at baseline (96.3% vs 87.1%). 
Demographics: Study D8850C00001 
The mean age of Evusheld-treated participants was 39.4 years. Most Evusheld-treated participants 
were male (32 [64.0%]) and White (34 [68.0%]). The demographic characteristics of the participants 
were generally balanced between treatment groups and placebo. 
Co-morbidities: Phase III Studies 
The COVID-19 co-morbidities of study participants in PROVENT and STORM CHASER are presented in 
the Table 36. For each study, the COVID-19 co-morbidities of the study populations were balanced 
between treatment groups. Overall, the most frequently reported co-morbidities were history of 
obesity (42.0%) and history of high blood pressure (33.8%).

Phase 3 Studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER 
Common Adverse Events (AE) of both Phase 3 studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER are presented 
below in the Table below. 
A total of 1646 (39.1%) subjects assigned to Evusheld group and 848 (40.2%) participants in the 
placebo group reported treatment-emergent AEs. 468 participants, i.e. 327 (7.8%) and 141 (6.7%) in 
the Evusheld and placebo group, had AEs assessed as possibly related to IMP by the Investigator. 
The majority of participants had AEs that were mild to moderate in intensity, with no major differences 
between PROVENT and STORM CHASER.

Study D8850C00001 
At the time of DCO, there were no deaths, SAEs, or AEs resulting in discontinuation of IMP in any 
participant. One participant in the Evusheld 3000 mg IV group had one AE leading to dose interruption

due to arthralgia and headache. The AEs resolved after stopping the infusion which could be continued 
after the pause. 
TEAE by relationship to IMP 
The most frequently reported PTs considered possibly related to IMP by the Investigator were 
headache (1.6% AZD7442, 1.5% PBO), fatigue (1.1% AZD7442, 1.0% PBO), and injection site pain 
(0.7% AZD7442, 0.8% for placebo). 
TEAE by severity  
Small percentages of the overall AEs (2.7%) and SAEs (1.4%) were considered severe without 
significant differences between the treatment groups. 
2.5.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious Adverse Events 
Phase 3 Studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER 
Overall, the incidence of SAEs was similar between treatment groups (2.4% AZD7442, 2.3% PBO). 
One participant reported a SAE of mesenteric artery thrombosis during PROVENT that was assessed 
possibly related to AZD7442.  
In PROVENT, there was a numerical imbalance in SAEs in the Cardiac disorders SOC between the 
treatment groups. 0.4% in the AZD7442 group and 0.2% in the placebo group experienced events 
including 11 different PTs. All reported SAEs were considered unrelated to IMP by the Investigator, 
each 0.1% were considered severe and potentially life threatening, and 0.1% were fatal. Based on 
medical history at baseline, all participants who experienced cardiac disorder SAEs had cardiac risk 
factors and/or a prior history of cardiovascular disease at baseline. There was no clear temporal 
pattern, and a causal relationship between AZD7442 and these events has not been established. 
Study D8850C00001. 
No SAEs or deaths were reported during Study D8850C00001. 
Deaths 
Phase 3 studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER (June 2021 DCO) 
In PROVENT, a total of 12/6318 (0.2% in each treatment group) participants had an AE leading to 
death (see table below). In STORM CHASER, there were no AEs with outcome death. In the placebo 
arm, 2 (0.1%) participants died due to COVID-19 (PTs COVID-19 pneumonia and Acute respiratory 
distress syndrome), and the causes of death were adjudicated to be related to COVID-19 by an 
independent committee. None of the AEs leading to death were assessed as possibly related to IMP by 
the investigator.

2.5.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Phase 3 studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER 
Haematology 
None of the studies showed apparent differences between treatment groups in mean hematology or 
coagulation parameters over time, or in shifts from normal to high/low in individual parameters. In 
addition, there were no individual clinically important abnormalities.  
Clinical Chemistry 
Clinical chemistry parameters (sodium, potassium, urea, creatinine, albumin, calcium, phosphate, 
glucose, and C-reactive Protein) were measured. None of the studies showed apparent differences 
between treatment groups in mean clinical chemistry parameters over time, or in shifts from normal to 
high/low in individual parameters. 
Urinalysis 
Urinalysis (glucose, protein, and blood) was conducted. None of the studies showed apparent 
differences between treatment groups in mean urinal analysis parameters over time, or in shifts from 
normal to high/low in individual parameters. 
Other safety findings 
Vital signs (BP, pulse rate, oral temperature, and respiratory rate) were measured at different time 
points. There were no treatment-related effects on vital signs or ECGs observed following 
administration of Evusheld.

2.5.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
The difference between simulated PK profiles (10 trials of 2029 participants) and AUC (0 to 91 days or 
3 months and 0 to 270 days or 9 months) for 2 groups, “All weight (36 to 177 kg)” and “Adolescents 
40 to 95 kg” have been studied. Overall, derived AUCs are comparable between these 2 groups at 3 
and 9 months; hence, a 300 mg IM fixed dose can be considered for a body weight > 40 kg and age ≥ 
12 years. Any marginal increase in exposure in these adolescents compared to adults is considered as 
safe since the exposure safety margin was ~ 33-fold and ~ 62-fold for AUC(0-60) and Cmax, 
respectively, based on PK data from the Phase I study. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Based on the mechanism of action, PK/PD results, and AEs presented in the tables, there is no reason 
to believe that the safety profile of Evusheld will be affected by diet, concomitant medication use or 
other extrinsic factors.  
There are limited data from the use of Evusheld in pregnant women. In line with ICH S6 (addendum), 
nonclinical reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with tixagevimab and cilgavimab. In 
a tissue cross-reactivity study with tixagevimab and cilgavimab using human fetal tissues, no binding 
was detected. There are no available data on the presence of Evusheld in human milk or animal milk, 
the effects on the breastfed infant.

2.5.8.7.  Immunological events 
Immunogenicity data relevant for clinical safety was provided with the responses (See Q 132). 
The applicant presents immunogenicity data until the latest DCO (August 2021) from 28 participants 
with cardiac SAEs (23 received AZD7442, 5 PBO) and from 2 subjects with elevated troponin; all were 
enrolled in PROVENT study. 6/30 subjects were ADA-positive, however, all but one were considered 
non-treatment-emergent. One patient had an isolated positive low ADA titre at Day 183 after the onset 
of the cardiac event.  
Additionally, non-cardiac thrombotic SAEs were analysed as to increased ADA titres, however, no 
patient that had been treated with AZD7442 was positive. 
Considering the dosing schedule of Evusheld, ADA formation is unlikely and thus, the immunogenic 
potential is considered low which is in some ways confirmed by the provided, though limited data. 
There are currently no additional safety issues that would require further analyses related to 
immunogenicity. 
2.5.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No interaction studies have been conducted. There is a theoretical risk that Evusheld may interfere 
with COVID-19 vaccines by neutralising antibodies to SARSCoV-2 that are produced in response to 
vaccination. 
Evusheld Interaction with COVID-19 Vaccination 
It is expected that a COVID-19 vaccination may be given either before or after administration of 
Evusheld. Data from animal studies reported that prior Evusheld administration did not alter the 
cellular or the humoral immune responses elicited by subsequent COVID-19 vaccinations. The available 
clinical safety data did not reveal any additional safety concerns for the participants who were exposed 
to Evusheld in PROVENT and STORM CHASER and then subsequently received COVID-19 vaccines. 
Based on these results, Evusheld is not anticipated to interfere with vaccine safety or efficacy. 
Although there is no clinical data available on the use of Evusheld following COVID-19 vaccination, 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 136/155 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
there is no evidence that prior vaccination for other diseases (eg, rabies, hepatitis) impacts the safety 
or efficacy of subsequent immunoglobulin treatment (Veronese et al 2021). 
2.5.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase 3 studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER 
During PROVENT, 5 (0.1%) participants were recorded as having discontinued the study, 3 of these 
participants died and were incorrectly reported as discontinued. A total of 2 participants discontinued 
the study due to the AEs of Cerebrovascular accident (AZD7442 group) and Alcoholism (placebo 
group). None of the AEs leading to study discontinuation were assessed as possibly related to IMP by 
the Investigator.  
There were no AEs leading to study discontinuation in STORM CHASER. 
Table 45: Number of Participants with Adverse Events Leading to Discontinuation of Study, 
by System Organ Class and Preferred Term – Safety Analysis Set, PROVENT, STORM CHASER, 
and POOLED (June 2021 DCO) 
2.5.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
Evusheld was authorised for emergency use in the United States on 08 December 2021, and has since 
received multiple early access authorizations globally. The first 2 monthly safety reports on Evusheld 
are available which contain an evaluation of the cumulative safety data from post-
authorization/marketing use available up to 31 January 2022.No new safety concerns have been 
identified and no significant actions relating to safety were taken. Additional data-cuts for the 
PROVENT and STORM CHASER studies have not been conducted beyond the August data-cut provided 
in the MAA.  Most commonly reported events were headache, fatigue, and COVID-19. Three of the 92 
reported events were hypersensitivity, rash, and injection site pain. 21 serious events and 1 fatal 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 137/155 
 
 
 
 
 
outcome (subarachnoid haemorrhage and brain death in a 25-35-year-old subject 2 days after 
administration of Evusheld) were reported, moreover 6 serious events of hypersensitivity. Detailed 
information on the death case are lacking. So far, little post-marketing data is available. Regarding 
both safety reports, no unexpected safety findings are present apart from the fatal case, however, 
exact circumstances of the fatal case are too vague to establish a causal relationship. Currently, 
monitoring within the framework of routine surveillance for Adverse Events is proposed, which is 
acceptable.  
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The applicant provides pooled safety data from both phase 3 studies PROVENT and STORM CHASER up 
to August 2021 (second data cut-off). Enrolment was completed at the time of the data cut-offs, 
however, safety follow-up is currently ongoing. During PROVENT, 5172 patients received IMP (3441 
Evusheld and 1731 placebo); the median safety follow-up is 137 days. During STORM CHASER, 1121 
patients were dosed (749 Evusheld, 372 placebo) with a median safety follow-up of 121 days. Thus, 
overall 4210 adult participants received Evusheld 300 mg i.m. in both Phase 3 studies. The pooling 
strategy is adequate. 
Additional safety data from 50 patients dosed during study D8850C00001 are available; the median 
safety follow-up depending on the cohort is 211-271 days. In total, 4240 study subjects have been 
exposed to Evusheld.  
Evusheld (AZD7442, components: AZD8895/tixagevimab and AZD1061/cilgavimab) is a monoclonal 
antibody with a non-host target. Considering the half-life of Evusheld, drug exposure is presumed to be 
sufficiently in all treated subjects after a single administration up to the time of the second data cut-off 
(see above). As to the size of safety database, there is currently no formal requirement existing with 
respect to the pandemic situation. The treated patient numbers are however, considered sufficient and 
further safety data are expected. 
Overall, 39.1% participants assigned to the AZD7442 group and 40.2% of those assigned to the 
placebo (PBO) group experienced at least one treatment-emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) after a single 
intramuscular administration of both Evusheld components tixagevimab and cilgavimab. A small 
percentage of study participants, i.e. 2.4% (AZD7442) vs. 2.3% (PBO) reported Serious Adverse 
Events (SAEs). Few patients discontinued the PROVENT study due to TEAEs. 2.3% (AZD7442) and 
2.0% (PBO) of the patients reported Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI). Approximately every 
tenth study subject of each group had a medically attended TEAE.  
Most frequently reported TEAEs were headache, fatigue and cough with similar percentages regarding 
the different treatment groups. In both Phase 3 studies, the majority of participants had TEAEs that 
were mild to moderate in intensity. As to the exposure adjusted TEAE rate, frequencies were 
comparable between verum and placebo group. As participants were allowed to take concomitant 
medications for the management of chronic medical conditions and/or for health maintenance, and 
investigators could prescribe drugs for the management of underlying medical conditions during study 
participation, it is difficult to disentangle adverse effects.  
Subgroup analysis on the intrinsic factors gender, age, race, ethnicity, and specific risk factors as body 
mass index, renal function or hepatic function were provided with the responses to the LOQ, and do 
not give rise to specific safety concerns so far; however, overall numbers the analysed categories are 
limited and should be interpreted with caution. No subgroup analysis based on concomitant 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 138/155 
 
 
 
medications was performed. As a variety of concomitant medication for the treatment of prior diseases 
were used, this may be acceptable.  
Serious adverse events (SAE) occurred with a slightly higher frequency during PROVENT (2.7% 
AZD7442 vs. 2.4% PBO) compared with STORM CHASER (1.2% AZD7442 vs. 1.9% PBO), however, 
were similar between the treatment groups and no major differences were observed in most SOCs. 
Within the SOC ‘Cardiac disorders’, a slight imbalance was observed. Up to the latest DCO (August 
2021) in PROVENT, 0.5% of the participants assigned to the AZD7442 group versus 0.2% in the 
placebo group experienced embolic or thrombotic events; the exposure-adjusted adverse event rate of 
cardiac disorder SAEs was 1.2 % in the AZD7442 group vs. 0.5% in the placebo group. Most common 
events in the AZD7442 group were myocardial infarction (n = 5) and acute myocardial infarction (n = 
4); one of the myocardial infarction SAEs was fatal and assessed unrelated to the IMP. Additionally, 
cases with mesenteric artery thrombosis (n=1) and pulmonary embolism (n=1) were reported; in the 
placebo group, acute myocardial infarction were reported in 2 subjects. In SOC Nervous system 
disorders, no PTs associated with embolic and thrombotic dominated in either treatment group. During 
STORM CHASER, 3 participants had embolic and thrombotic events, 2 thereof in the Evusheld group 
(cerebral ischaemia and deep vein thrombosis), 1 in the placebo group (renal infarct). The study 
populations of both Phase 3 studies were relatively similar regarding baseline disease characteristics, 
i.e. 77.5% and 64.8% had any high risk for severe COVID-19 at baseline in PROVENT and STORM 
CHASER, respectively. The frequencies as to history of obesity (>30 kg/m2), current obesity (>30 
kg/m2), diabetes, and smoking were similar. Differences were present regarding pre-existing 
cardiovascular diseases (8.1% vs. 2.9%), Hypertension (35.9% vs. 23.9%), Asthma (11.1% vs. 
6.9%), COPD (5.3% vs. 1.7%), chronic liver disease (4.6% vs. 0.9%), and immunosuppressive 
treatment (3.2% vs. 0.7%), suggesting that the PROVENT study population might have been more 
susceptible to adverse events. As requested, the applicant provided a time-to-onset analysis of all 
cardiac serious adverse events. Here, periods between Evusheld administration and the diverse events 
varied between 6 and 215 days, 21/23 cases occurred beyond day 45, 16/23 cases had resolved, 4/23 
were ongoing, and 3/23 were fatal at data DCO. None of the reported cardiac events were considered 
related to the study drug. Due to the pre-existing conditions and multiple risk factors, patients had a 
variety of concomitant medications that render the assessment of treatment effects more difficult. 
Currently, no further safety data available at this time beyond the second DCO in August 2021. The 
presented narratives suggest that the reported serious adverse events were most likely associated with 
the pre-existent medical conditions and multiple risk factors, respectively. Based on the provided 
clinical data, the mechanism of action, the preclinical findings without observed tissue cross-reactivity, 
and missing true imbalances between treatment groups, no specific safety concern as to cardiac events 
are present that would require further regulatory action. Currently, it seems reasonable that cardiac 
events are monitored as potential risk via routine pharmacovigilance activities. This is reflected in the 
RMP. However, to address the observations made during PROVENT, a corresponding warning was 
included in the SmPC. 
Potential concerns associated with protein-based infusion therapies include anaphylaxis, 
hypersensitivity reactions, and infusion-related reactions. Antibody-dependent enhancement of disease 
is a theoretical risk.  Most frequently reported Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) were Injection

site reactions (ISR) (2.0% AZD7442 vs. 1.9% PBO). During PROVENT, ISR were more frequent 
compared with STORM CHASER, however, their occurrence was balanced between verum and placebo 
within each of the Phase 3 studies. Medically attended adverse events were rarely judged to be IMP-
related (0.4% in both AZD7442 and PBO group) and overall balanced across SOCs and PTs, 
respectively.  
Adverse events that were classified as Adverse Drug Reactions (ADR) were Hypersensitivity (1.0% 
AZD7442 vs. 0.9% PBO) and injection site reactions (1.3% AZD7442 vs. 1.2% PBO) in line with 
available safety data and the mode of action; their inclusion in the product information is endorsed. 
Incidences were overall low suggesting a good tolerability.  
In PROVENT at 1st DCO, overall 13/5172 (0.3%) patients died; 7/3461 (0.2%) subjects in the 
AZD7442 and 5/1736 (0.3%) participants in the placebo group died following TEAEs. In the verum 
group, reasons for death were myocardial infarction, arrhythmia, septic shock, overdose due to illicit 
drug use, overdose of an unknown substance, end renal stage disease, and unknown but most likely 
cause kidney failure. In the placebo group, patients died due to COVID-19 (2), dementia, hepatic 
cirrhosis, cancer of unknown primary site. At 2nd DCO, 4 more cases with fatal outcome were recorded, 
thereof 2 in the AZD7442 group (congestive heart failure and cardiopulmonary arrest) and 2 in the 
placebo group (cancer and alcoholism). Additionally, 3 more patients deceased during STORM CHASER, 
2 (0.3%) in the AZD7442 group (cerebral ischaemia, lung cancer) and 1 (0.3%) in the placebo group 
(unknown, report pending). No deaths occurred during Study D8850C00001. None of the deaths were 
considered related to the study drug. Based on the provided narratives, it seems that the deaths were 
most likely associated with the underlying health conditions as severe primary diseases and co-
morbidities were present in these patients at baseline or the temporal relationship appears implausible.  
Immunogenicity data that are relevant for clinical safety were provided with the responses to the LOQ. 
The applicant presents immunogenicity data until the latest DCO (August 2021) from 28 participants 
with cardiac SAEs (23 received AZD7442, 5 PBO) and from 2 subjects with elevated troponin; all were 
enrolled in PROVENT study. 6/30 subjects were ADA-positive, however, all but one were considered 
non-treatment-emergent. One patient had an isolated positive low ADA titre at Day 183 after the onset 
of the cardiac event. Additionally, non-cardiac thrombotic SAEs were analysed as to increased ADA 
titres, however, no patient that had been treated with AZD7442 was positive. Considering the dosing 
schedule of Evusheld, ADA formation is unlikely and thus, the immunogenic potential is considered low 
which is in some ways confirmed by the provided, though limited data. There are currently no 
additional safety issues that would require further analyses related to immunogenicity. 
So far, the safety data suggest a tolerable safety profile. The majority of recorded TEAEs may be 
regarded as symptoms without causal relationship to ATZ7442. However, further long-term data are 
needed to fully characterize the safety profile. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

2.5.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the presented safety data suggest that Evusheld is well tolerated in the target population. The 
safety profile appears favourable and is in accordance with what is expected from a monoclonal 
antibody directed against an external target.

2.6.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 1.0 is acceptable. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.7.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.7.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 14 November 2021. The new EURD list entry 
will therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
An updated “Package leaflet User testing” summary report, dated 17 March 2022 was provided by the 
applicant.  
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meet the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.  
2.8.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Evusheld (tixagevimab / cilgavimab) is 
included in the additional monitoring list as:  
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 142/155 
 
 
 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant is seeking approval for the use of Evusheld for the prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adult 
and adolescent patients ≥12 years and weighing ≥40 kg. 
SARS-CoV-2 is the coronavirus responsible for the current COVID-19 global pandemic. Coronavirus 
entry into host cells is mediated by the transmembrane S glycoprotein that binds to the cellular 
receptor hACE2 allowing the viral genome to enter and replicate in the cell (Tortorici and Veesler 
2019). As the S protein is surface-exposed and mediates the entry into host cells, it is the main target 
of neutralising antibodies and is the primary target for mAbs and vaccines. 
Unlike the majority of coronaviruses that mainly cause mild disease in humans and animals, SARS-
CoV-2 can replicate in the lower respiratory tract to cause acute respiratory distress syndrome and 
fatal pneumonia. The uncontrolled pulmonary inflammation and increased secretion of pro-
inflammatory cytokines associated with severe disease is suggestive of a cytokine storm, especially in 
patients who are critically ill (Huang et al 2020, CDC 2020, Guan et al 2020).  
As of 18 March 2022, there have been 464,809,377 confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection globally 
with approximately 6,062,536 deaths resulting from infection and subsequent coronavirus disease 
(COVID-19) as registered by WHO (https://covid19.who.int/ last accessed  on 20/3/2022).By region, 
191.842.819 cases have been confirmed in Europe.  
With a basic reproduction number R0 value at the start of the pandemic estimated between 2.43 to 
3.10 without medical intervention, SARS-CoV-2 is highly transmissible from person to person, which 
has contributed to its exponential dissemination worldwide (D’Arienzo and Coniglio 2020). The 
emergence of more virulent variants (eg, Delta with an R0 of 3.2 to 8 [Liu and Rocklöv 2021] and 
Omicron [R0 unknown at the time of writing]) is further increasing the rate of spread globally. The 
Omicron variant is currently the most prevalent variant globally, comprising 71% of all cases 
sequenced (as of 19 January 2022; GISAID 2022). 
The estimated incubation period for COVID-19 is up to 14 days, with a median of 4 to 5 days from 
exposure to initial onset of symptoms (reviewed in Zhou et al 2020b). The symptoms of COVID-19, if 
present, differ with severity of disease. The symptoms most frequently associated with symptomatic 
mild to moderate illness include fever, cough, fatigue, muscle or body aches, headache, sore throat, 
nasal congestion, shortness of breath or difficulty breathing, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and a loss in 
sense of taste or smell. COVID-19 is a systemic disease affecting not just the respiratory tract but also 
in myocardial, renal, neurologic, gastrointestinal, and pharyngeal tissues and where hACE2 receptors 
have been identified (Gupta et al 2020). Patients may progress to severe pneumonia or develop acute 
respiratory distress syndrome, which is the primary cause for respiratory failure, and direct organ 
damage by the virus likely contributes to multiorgan failure. Some people who recover from COVID-19 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 143/155 
 
 
 
go on to suffer from symptoms long-term. Signs and symptoms of COVID-19 in children are similar to 
adults but are typically milder. Some paediatric patients who are infected with SARS-CoV-2 never 
develop symptoms (asymptomatic), with 2 studies (Toba et al 2021) reporting that as many as 19% of 
PCR-confirmed cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection in children are asymptomatic (Lu et al 2020). Mortality 
risk factors associated with COVID-19 include age > 60 years (significantly greater for those 80 years 
and older), male sex, and chronic medical conditions including hypertension, diabetes, obesity, and 
cardiovascular disease (Zhou et al 2020a). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Globally, a number of vaccines are authorised for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by 
SARS-CoV-2. Despite the rollout of these effective vaccines, there remains a clear unmet medical need 
to provide effective prophylaxis to neutralize SARS-CoV-2 and ensure protection against emerging 
variants, particularly in those individuals not expected to mount an adequate response to active 
immunization (CDC 2021a), and those for whom vaccination is not suitable. 
As recorded in section 2, several therapeutic options have been approved since the beginning of the 
pandemic including other monoclonals ( please see Management,  section 2).  
While vaccines remain the primary prophylactic approach to COVID-19 the immunogenicity, or the type 
and magnitude of immune response a vaccine generates over time, is expected to be limited in those 
who have a weakened immune system compared to the general population. Breakthrough infections of 
fully vaccinated individuals continue to emerge both in the general population (Hacisuleyman et al 
2021) and in high-risk populations such as those patients on immunosuppressants (Geisen et al 2021), 
patients with hematological malignancy (Agha et al 2021, ACIP 2021), patients who have received a 
solid organ transplant (Boyarsky et al 2021a, Boyarsky et al 2021b), and dialysis patients (Broseta et 
al 2021).  
Although the recent introduction of a third vaccine dose aims to better protect the 
immunocompromised, recent data shows that some populations still fail to mount an adequate 
response, among these, in solid organ transplant patients (Benotmane et al 2021, Schrezenmeier et al 
2021), patients with hematological malignancies (Re et al 2021) and those individuals treated with 
rituximab (Bonelli et al 2021). 
An additional unmet need continues for those contraindicated for vaccination, ie, those who have had a 
severe or immediate allergic reaction after a previous dose or component of the vaccine (CDC 
2021b).As an example, anaphylaxis to the first dose is a contraindication to subsequent vaccination. 
Currently there is no option for some individuals to be fully protected against SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
The recent emergence of the Omicron variant (B.1.1.529) in November 2021, which has a larger 
number of mutations (~30 substitutions, deletions, or insertions) in the spike protein (Torjesen 2021), 
raises concerns that this variant will escape the protection offered by both vaccines and anti-SARS-
CoV-2 mAbs. Thus, an additional mAb product with neutralising activity against Omicron variant 
wouldbe needed and welcome. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Studies supporting the efficacy, safety, PK, and PD of Evusheld in this Application include Phase III 
Study D8850C00002 (PROVENT), Phase III Study D8850C00003 (STORM CHASER) as well as Phase I 
FTIH study (Study D8850C00001). 
See also Section 2.3 for tabular overview. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 144/155 
 
 
 
Evidence of efficacy was investigated in 2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trials 
PROVENT and STORM CHASER for the prevention of COVID-19 in pre- and post-exposure prophylaxis 
setting. 
In PROVENT, included participants had a negative SARS-CoV-2 serology test at screening and were: 
1.  adults ≥ 18 years of age who were candidates expected to benefit from passive immunization with 
antibodies, defined as having an increased risk for inadequate response to active immunization 
(predicted poor responders to vaccines OR intolerant of vaccine), OR 
2.  having an increased risk for SARS-CoV-2 infection, defined as those whose locations or 
circumstances put them at appreciable risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19, based 
on available risk assessment at time of enrollment. 
STORM CHASER included participants who were SARS-CoV-2 PCR negative or positive at baseline, had 
a negative SARS-CoV-2 serology test at screening and were: 
1.  adults ≥ 18 years of age with potential exposure, within 8 days, to a specific identified individual 
with laboratory-confirmed symptomatic or asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection, and who were 
therefore at appreciable risk of imminently developing COVID-19. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The percentage of participants who experienced COVID-19 prior to Day 183 was reduced by Evusheld 
treatment compared to placebo in the pivotal study PROVENT: 
1.  Evusheld vs concurrent PBO: 0.2% vs 1.0%;  
RRR (95% CI): 76.73 (46.05, 89.96); p<0.001. 
Results from the August 2021 DCO with longer follow-up were consistent with the primary estimand: 
2.  Evusheld vs concurrent PBO: 0.3% vs 1.8%;  
RRR (95% CI): 82.80 (65.79, 91.35); p<0.001. 
The percentage of participants who had a Post-Treatment Response for SARS-CoV-2 Nucleocapsid 
Antibodies was reduced by Evusheld treatment compared to placebo in the pivotal study PROVENT: 
3.  Evusheld vs concurrent PBO: 0.7% vs 1.3% 
RRR (95% CI): 51.07 (10.57, 73.23); p=0.020 
No cases of severe/critical COVID-19 or COVID-19 related deaths occurred under Evusheld treatment. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
As study STORM CHASER failed to meet its primary endpoint, efficacy of Evusheld in the post-exposure 
prophylaxis setting could not be demonstrated in the chosen population. No treatment effect could be 
demonstrated in already infected but asymptomatic subjects: SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positives at 
baseline were excluded from the analysis set of the primary endpoint in study PROVENT. No tendency 
of positive treatment effect in SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR positives at baseline was seen in the formally failed 
study STORM CHASER. 
The presented results are based on data snapshots from ongoing studies. With the chosen event-
driven timing of the primary analysis in both studies, the number of overall COVID-19 cases was too 
low to allow any conclusion on Evusheld’s effect on prevention of disease progression (severe/critical 
illness or death).  
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 145/155 
 
 
 
Efficacy result were obtained in non-pregnant, non-breast-feeding, unvaccinated and seronegative 
adults only. Participants with immunosuppressive disease/treatment were underrepresented. 
Various design changes were conducted in the ongoing studies. Some of the participants were 
unblinded prior to primary endpoint analysis (1933 (36.8%) and 115 (10.2%) had been unblinded in 
PROVENT and STORM CHASER, respectively at the primary data cut-off).  
As for these half-life extended antibodies long-term efficacy data are outstanding, considerations on 
duration of protection and potential re-dosing are based on modelling and simulations only. In 
addition, the extent/duration of protection against circulating and newly emerging strains of SARS-
CoV-2 is not known. Viral sequencing from phase 3 studies is still ongoing, however, clinical trial data 
on viral variants are hampered by temporal and geographical limitations of an evolving viral landscape. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the pooled safety analysis set, the proportion of subjects with 1 or more TEAE was similar in both 
treatment groups (39.1% AZD7442 vs. 40.2% PBO). Most frequently reported TEAEs were headache, 
fatigue and cough; these were overall balanced. 
More patients assigned to the verum group had AEs assessed possibly related to IMP by the 
investigator (7.8% AZD7442 vs. 6.7% PBO). The most frequently reported PTs considered possibly 
related to IMP by the Investigator were headache (1.6% AZD7442, 1.5% PBO), fatigue (1.1% 
AZD7442, 1.0% PBO), and injection site pain (0.7% AZD7442, 0.8% PBO). 
A slightly higher SAE frequency was observed in the Evusheld group compared with the placebo group 
during PROVENT (2.7% vs. 2.4%). One related SAE was reported in the Evusheld group (Palpitations). 
Within the SOC ‘Cardiac disorders’, a slight imbalance was observed. Up to the latest DCO (August 
2021) in PROVENT, 0.5% of the participants assigned to the AZD7442 group versus 0.2% in the 
placebo group experienced embolic or thrombotic events; the exposure-adjusted adverse event rate of 
cardiac disorder SAEs was 1.2 % in the AZD7442 group vs. 0.5% in the placebo group. 
In PROVENT, a total of 12/6318 (0.2% in each treatment group) participants had an AE leading to 
death, none of the deaths were considered related to study drug. Death related to COVID-19 only 
occurred in the placebo group. In the verum group, reasons for death were myocardial infarction (1), 
arrhythmia (1), septic shock (1), overdose due to illicit drug use (1), overdose of an unknown 
substance (1), end renal stage disease (1), and unknown but most likely cause kidney failure (1). In 
the placebo group, patients died due to COVID-19 (2), dementia (1), hepatic cirrhosis (1), cancer of 
unknown primary site (1). In PROVENT at 2nd DCO 4 more cases with fatal outcome were recorded, 
thereof 2 in the AZD7442 group (congestive heart failure and cardiopulmonary arrest) and 2 in the 
placebo group (cancer and alcoholism). Additionally, 3 more patients deceased during STORM CHASER, 
2 (0.3%) in the AZD7442 group (cerebral ischaemia, lung cancer) and 1 (0.3%) in the placebo group 
(unknown, report pending). No deaths occurred during Phase 1 study D8850C00001.  
On PROVENT, AESI (anaphylaxis/ other serious hypersensitivity reactions and injection site reactions) 
occurred with a higher frequency in the Evusheld group compared to the placebo group (2.7% 
AZD7442 vs. 2.1% PBO) mainly due to injection site reactions. This phenomenon was not observed in 
the STORM CHASER study population. 
More AEs leading to study discontinuation were reported in the Evusheld group of the PROVENT study 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The overall frequency of treatment-emergent adverse events was balanced between the treatment 
groups of PROVENT study, lower in the verum group of STORM CHASER when compared with placebo 
Assessment report  
EMA/205600/2022  
Page 146/155 
 
 
 
 
and balanced regarding the pooled safety data. The majority of participants had AEs that were mild to 
moderate in intensity, with no major differences between PROVENT and STORM CHASER. 
The most frequently reported PTs considered possibly related to IMP by the investigator were balanced 
between the treatment groups of the pooled safety data. 
The majority of participants (77.5%) had pre-existing medical conditions and multiple comorbidities 
such as hypertension, cardiac diseases, obesity, diabetes etc. Since participants were allowed to take 
concomitant medications for the management of chronic medical conditions and/or for health 
maintenance, treatment effects are difficult to disentangle. 
AESI were balanced between both studies (2.0% AZD7442 vs. 1.9% PBO). Medically attended adverse 
events were also balanced between treatment groups and studies (13% each). 
Very few AEs resulted in study discontinuation. 
The available data (in vitro, non-clinical, clinical) do not raise a concern regarding antibody-dependent 
disease enhancement for the time being. Available clinical data on anti-drug antibody formation after 
Evusheld administration is currently limited. 
No clinical data is available for adolescent participants.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The chosen primary and secondary endpoints are considered appropriate to investigate the efficacy of 
Evusheld in the intended target population that is in a need of passive immunization with antibodies. 
Thus, obtained results are deemed clinically relevant in relation to the target disease.  
Concerning the primary endpoint of PROVENT, Evusheld demonstrated a statistically significant effect 
with relevant effect size in a pre-exposure prophylaxis setting. The key supportive analyses confirmed 
the significance of the results related to the primary endpoint. The results of the key secondary 
endpoint, as a measure of prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection (symptomatic and asymptomatic), can 
be considered confirmatory. In the analysed subgroups, including age, sex, race, ethnicity, COVID-19 
co-morbidities at baseline, high risk for severe COVID-19 at baseline, and various individual risk 
factors for COVID-19, subjects assigned to the Evusheld group tended to experience fewer events 
compared to the PBO group.  
Potential bias resulting from inadequate planning and partial unblinding could not all entirely be ruled 
out but did not have the potential to impact study results to an extent that would make the entire 
conclusion on efficacy questionable.  
As STORM CHASER study did not meet its primary endpoint, efficacy of Evusheld in the post-exposure 
prophylaxis setting could not be demonstrated in the chosen population. Results do not support the 
general prophylactic administration of Evusheld irrespective of exposure. Furthermore, due to 
inconclusive data obtained in the small amount of PCR positive subjects in studies PROVENT and 
STORM CHASER there remains a minor residual risk for already SARS-CoV-2 infected asymptomatic 
patients. Considering results of both confirmatory studies, no databased statement can be made on 
Evusheld’s effect on prevention of disease progression, as the number of overall COVID-19 cases was 
too low to allow any conclusion. Otherwise, considering the totality of available information that might 
support efficacy results of the confirmatory studies, it is acknowledged that a broad indication 
statement might also be appropriate in the given context. Such considerations might consider the 
theoretical assumption that viral load reduction may be beneficial for both, clinical outcome and 
transmission rates, as well as knowledge gained with other anti-SARS-CoV-2 mAbs. 
Lacking efficacy data in adolescents ≥40 kg may be compensated by available popPK modelling: based 
on PK extrapolation, a dose of 300 mg Evusheld IM is expected to achieve similar exposure (AUC) as in 
adults. Based on theoretical considerations, adolescents are expected to profit from prophylactic 
treatment in a similar way like adult patients. Currently available data and theoretical considerations 
did not identify specific safety issues.  
As clinical trial data for previously SARS-CoV-2 vaccinated and/or seropositive individuals are lacking, 
treatment decisions or timing of such decisions will need to be based on local/national guidelines. No 
specific safety issues are expected in the groups of vaccinated and/or seropositive patients. 
Although immunosuppressed participants (by disease or treatment) were underrepresented in the 
study population, a safety profile comparable to overall population is expected. 
Treatment of pregnant women was currently not investigated in the clinical trial setting. Lack of cross-
reactivity in human foetal tissues suggests low risk to developing foetuses in pregnant women 
administered Evusheld. Nevertheless, currently available information without any clinical data is too 
limited to make a general treatment recommendation. Use in pregnancy is subject to Additional 
Pharmacovigilance Activities.

Based on biological plausibility no risk for the breastfed infant is anticipated. Treatment in breast 
feeding women may be considered when clinically indicated. 
A single dose of Evusheld was well tolerated, with a safety profile mainly comparable to placebo. The 
risk of hypersensitivity is adequately addressed in the product information and is supposed to be 
manageable with the given precautionary measures. Although the knowledge about ADA formation and 
potentially associated risks is limited at present, the safety risk due to clinically relevant ADA response 
is assumed to be low based on the mechanism of action and dosing schedule. The data of in vitro and 
in vivo studies pose minimal theoretical risk for mediating ADE.  
Overall, the safety profile of Evusheld appears favourable and in line with what is expected from a 
monoclonal antibody with an exogenous target i.e. viral target and thus without intrinsic activity. 
An overall suitable popPK model was used to predict long-term PK. Predictions were confirmed by 1-
year PK data available from the phase I study. However, dose justification and predicted duration of 
protection were based on SARS-CoV-2 original strain. As no clinical efficacy data will be obtained for 
recent/upcoming viral variants, estimates on efficacy will need to rely on in vitro information and 
modelling/simulations. Post authorisation, the applicant will gain latest information on Evusheld 
antiviral activity against circulating virus strains in the EU by monitoring of viral sequence data bases 
followed by prompt testing of variants of interest in established in vitro systems. As part of Routine 
Pharmacovigilance Activities, the applicant will be evaluating available data on breakthrough infections 
due to emerging variants from spontaneous cases, clinical trial data, and literature. Thus, potential loss 
of efficacy due to emerging spike variants will be manageable post authorisation. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The demonstrated effect of a single Evusheld dose in the prevention of COVID-19 in a pre-exposure 
prophylaxis setting is considered clinically relevant.  
A single dose administration of Evusheld demonstrated a good safety profile with a manageable risk of 
hypersensitivity that does not raise a specific concern.  
Although most of the pregnant women with COVID -19 infection will recover without complications, 
some studies have shown an increased risk of severe COVID-19 in pregnant women when compared 
with nonpregnant women (Zambrano et al, 2020). However, the overall data presented are not 
sufficient to make a general recommendation for use of Evusheld in this population. An individual 
benefit-risk appraisal appears appropriate. 
Overall, the favourable effects outweigh the unfavourable effects. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Evusheld is positive, post authorisation measures are defined as 
recommendations 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Evusheld is favourable in the following indication(s): 
EVUSHELD is indicated for the pre-exposure prophylaxis of COVID-19 in adults and adolescents aged

12 years and older weighing at least 40 kg (see sections 4.2, 5.1 and 5.2). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new 
information being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or 
as the result of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being 
reached.  
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
to be implemented by the Member States 
Not applicable. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that tixagevimab and cilgavimab 
are to be qualified as new active substances in themselves as they are not constituents of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).  
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan P/0235/2021 and P/0236/2021 and the results of these studies are 
reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
development and not with the analytical validation, the applicant 
will not incorporate the robustness data into the validation section. 
This does not stand in contradiction to the guidance of ICHQ2.

into an appropriate section of the dossier, e.g. S.2.6 by Q3 2022. 
This recommendation applies to both active substances.  
11. The applicant is recommended to list the reference IDs of the in-
EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
house method documents in Sections 3.2.S.4.1 and 3.2.P.5.1. .  
12. For the simulated leachables study on the active substance 
EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
container, results beyond 6 months for the 2–8°C and 23–27°C 
conditions are recommended to be submitted as soon as they are 
available, This recommendation applies to both active substances. 
13. Information about the area of the sterilising filter should be stated 
EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
in Module 3.2.P.3.3 of the dossier according to the Guideline on the 
sterilisation (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015). This 
recommendation applies to both finished products  
14. From the data provided it is concluded that the method seems 
EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
suitable to quantify AZD8895 and AZD1061 in human serum. 
Summary information on sample storage, dilutions, performance of 
analytical runs and incurred sample re-analysis for PROVENT and 
STORM CHASER should be provided when available. . 
15. During the covariate exploratory analysis, scatter plots highlighting 
EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
possible relationships between continuous covariates is shown as 
well as some box plots displaying possible relationships between 
selected categorical and continuous covariates. However, the latter 
is incomplete. Of particular interest is the correlation between 
diabetes and bodyweight because the 2 covariates are retained on 
the same PK parameter in the final model. The box plot shows a 
correlation between diabetes and body weight with higher body 
weight in diabetes patients compared to non-diabetes. Both body 
weight and diabetes were statistically significant covariates on CL. 
However, no dose adaptations was proposed for diabetes and the 
allometric exponent were fixed for bodyweight effect on CL. Hence, 
the inclusion of both body weight and diabetes as covariates on CL 
is not an issue for the current popPK model. Issue will be followed 
in updated versions of the popPK model. . 
16. In some figure provided it has been shown a correlation between 
EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
bodyweight and sex. Given this the applicant should discuss the 
appropriateness of retaining both sex and bodyweight as covariates 
on the CL and V in the final model. However, no dose adaptations 
was proposed for sex and the allometric exponent were fixed for 
bodyweight effect on CL.  Hence, the inclusion of both body weight 
and sex as covariates on CL and V is not an issue for the current 
popPK model. However, the issue will be followed in updated 
versions of the popPK model that should be provided. . 
17. The applicant was asked to provide a sensitivity analysis excluding 
EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
these subjects from study PROVENT that are showing so far 
unexplained “up and down PK profiles” low concentrations followed 
by an increase at later time points) from popPK model. As there 
are remaining issues to be addressed with updated versions of pop 
PK modelling, and the bioanalytical final reports from PROVENT are

still pending, this issue should also be readdressed with respect to 
PK data inclusion and final conclusions on covariates, in particular 
weight effects.  
18. Viral load/viral shedding results from infected subjects in PROVENT 
EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
are pending and once available, AstraZeneca will update the VDM 
with these viral load data and try to correlate viral dynamics with 
clinical outcomes. The updated VDM and outcomes should be 
provided. 
19. The applicant is asked to provide results from PRNT50 pseudovirus 
EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
assays development and validation (expected Q2 2022), when 
available. In this line, evaluation of relevant clinical trial samples 
should be provided as well. . 
20. Due to the indicated reduced time of protection regarding Omicron 
EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
BA.1, BA.1.1 and BA.2, a need to adapt the posology either in 
terms of dose strength or more frequent dosing might be 
necessary. The applicant is asked to still provide results of 
probability of target attainment (PTA) and simulations of the 
following (worst case) scenarios for all three Omicron variants: 
a.  Target serum concentration needed to reach IC80 and IC90 should 
be documented, together with % of subjects above MPC following a 
single dose 300 mg and 600 mg Evusheld IM at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 
months post dose. IC90 should be used as PD target, unless an 
updated version of the viral dynamic model is provided with 
acceptable fitting performances on data from the PROVENT and 
STORM CHASER studies. This should be simulated based on the 
following assumptions for sensitivity considerations: Lung partition 
coefficients: 6.5% and 12%; mean and highest IC50 value per 
strain, reflecting inter-experiment variability. Of note, similar 
simulations may become relevant in case new VOCs needs to be 
considered. In this case, this should be provided. Data to be 
provided once this situation applies. 
b.  The results of PTA should be provided separately for the different 
quartiles of body weights, with clear indication of % of persons 
remaining above the minimum protective concentrations (IC90 and 
6.5% partition coefficient should be used. Simulations focussing on 
bodyweight quartiles have not been conducted with the highest 
MPC (4.8 µg/ml) for the BA.2 strain. Thus, it could not be 
precluded that the duration of protection patients at high weight 
(>95 kg) is reduced to a clinically relevant level (also for original 
strains). This issue thus remains to be addressed (with potential 
consequences for SmPC statement, Section 5.2).  
21. The updated Version of the popPK model together with the 
EMEA/H/C/5788/RR/001 
outstanding issues on PK modelling and data inclusion are expected 
in Q3 2022 (REC15-REC17). Depending on the data and re-analysis 
of covariates, the inclusion of weight effect on PK might be relevant 
to be re-addressed.

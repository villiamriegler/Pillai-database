3.  Scientific discussion 
Avastin, bevacizumab, is a recombinant humanised monoclonal antibody that inhibits angiogenesis by 
neutralising all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF-A), and blocking their 
binding to VEGF receptors. 
Avastin was approved in the European Union (EU) on 12 January 2005 for the first-line treatment of 
patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC), in combination with 5- fluorouracil/folinic acid or 5-
fluorouracil/folinic acid/irinotecan. Afterwards, Avastin was approved for the treatment of locally 
recurrent and metastatic breast cancer (mBC), non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), metastatic renal 
cell cancer (RCC) and in combination with platinum containing regimens for mCRC.  
This variation concerns an application for extension of the approved indications for Avastin. The 
indication initially claimed by the MAH was: 
‘‘Avastin, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is indicated for the front-line treatment of 
epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer”. 
The final indication approved by the CHMP is as follows: 
“Avastin, in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel is indicated for the front-line treatment of 
advanced (FIGO stages III B, III C and IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal 
cancer”. 
Consequently, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated to reflect the change in 
the indication accordingly. The PL has been updated accordingly. In addition, ''Batch'' has been 
replaced by ''lot'' in Annex IIIA. Finally, Annex II has been updated in order to include the new version 
number of the Risk Management Plan and the list of conditions.

3.3.  Clinical aspects 
3.3.1.  Introduction 
Ovarian cancer is one of the most common gynaecological tumours in Europe and the United States. 
The incidence of ovarian cancer varies by geographic region, with the highest rates observed in North 
 
 
America, Europe, and other developed countries. Ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer 
death in women. 
The most common group of ovarian cancers that arise in the epithelium are epithelial ovarian cancer 
(EOC), fallopian tube cancer (FTC) and/or primary peritoneal cancer (PPC). The recommendation of the 
International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) is that treatment for PPC and FTC 
follows the guidance for EOC. Throughout this document the term ovarian cancer is used to refer to all 
three diseases. 
The definitive diagnosis and staging of ovarian cancer is by surgery, and cytological or histological 
examination of tissue samples. The FIGO surgical staging system is used for epithelial ovarian cancer 
and primary peritoneal adenocarcinoma . Because the disease tends to be asymptomatic in early 
stages, or associated with vague, non-specific symptoms, the majority of patients are diagnosed with 
advanced stage disease.  
Since patients usually present with advanced disease, cure is difficult to achieve in the majority of 
cases, but prolongation of survival is possible and delay in first recurrence is considered clinically 
meaningful.  
After initial surgical diagnosis, staging and cytoreductive surgery, the standard primary systemic 
chemotherapy for women with advanced ovarian cancer is a platinum and taxane combination  usually 
carboplatin and paclitaxel. While there is a high response rate to this combination, the majority of 
women ultimately experience disease recurrence and die of their disease, which underlines the need to 
improve front line therapy.  
Median progression free survival (PFS) for ovarian cancer patients with advanced disease including 
populations with mixed FIGO stages with no surgery restrictions  or those with suboptimally debulked 
stage III/IV disease ranges between 11.2 and 18 months while the median overall survival (OS) lies 
between 25.8 and 38 months.  
Intravenous (IV) paclitaxel plus carboplatin every three weeks is the standard of care globally (and the 
preferred comparator for front-line therapy studies). There is also reported evidence for improved 
outcomes with two modified regimens, weekly paclitaxel and intraperitoneal paclitaxel, and both are 
listed in treatment guidelines as options for standard of care. 
The current application is mainly based on data from two international, randomised, phase III studies 
of bevacizumab in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy for front line treatment of 
ovarian cancer, studies GOG-0218 and BO17707. An overview of the complete and ongoing studies of 
bevacizumab in ovarian cancer is presented in Table 1.

GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
3.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A comprehensive population PK analysis was submitted with this application which was conducted 
using a first-order (FO) estimation method in NONMEM from eight clinical trials (Phase I, Phase II, and 
Phase III) in which several dosing regimens, patient populations, and concomitant anti-neoplastic 
regimens were used. Patients with mBC, NSCLC, CRC, and other solid tumours were included in this 
analysis. The analysis included a total of 491 patients who received IV doses of bevacizumab ranging 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
from 1 to 20 mg/kg at a dosing frequency of every 1 week, every 2 weeks, or every 3 weeks. Of the 
491 patients included in the population PK model, 276 patients were female and 215 were male. 
The population PK model also included covariates that account for inter-individual variability in the PK 
of bevacizumab, such as different chemotherapeutic agents used in combination with bevacizumab in 
these studies. This allowed for the assessment of the impact of co-administered chemotherapy 
evaluated to date on the PK of bevacizumab. Chemotherapy drugs in these studies were doxorubicin, 
carboplatin/paclitaxel, 5-FU/leucovorin, capecitabine, and bolus- irinotecan+5-fluorouracil+ leucovorin 
(IFL). The clearance (CL) of bevacizumab when bevacizumab was given in combination with bolus-IFL 
was not different than the CL with single-agent bevacizumab. In all other bevacizumab combinations, 
CL of bevacizumab was 17% slower. Because different combination therapies were given to patients 
with different tumour types, possible drug interactions (other than with the bolus-IFL regimen) were 
not distinguishable from tumour type effects on bevacizumab CL. 
In addition, the MAH has submitted the results of a population PK analysis in patients with renal cell 
carcinoma. Using first-order conditional estimation (FOCE) in NONMEM to optimize the Reference 
Population PK Model, followed by a Bayesian feedback population PK analysis of bevacizumab PK data, 
the PK of bevacizumab in 102 patients with mRCC in Study BO17705 were compared with the 
previously investigated population pharmacokinetics of patients with mBC, NSCLC, CRC, and other 
solid tumours.  
The observed bevacizumab trough levels in mRCC showed an increase in concentration from Week 3 to 
Week 11, consistent with a bevacizumab t1/2 of 20 days and a time to achieve steady state of 
approximately 14 weeks. In addition, the following evaluations were made for comparability of mRCC 
observations to bevacizumab observations described earlier by the Reference Population PK Model: 
• The median simulated bevacizumab trough levels were in agreement with the median observed 
trough levels. A comparison of the 90% prediction interval indicates that 90.7% of the observed data 
were within this interval. 
• Overall, median observed data in typical male and female patients for troughs and full concentration 
profiles were contained in the 95% confidence interval (CI) during the period with controlled dosing. 
• There were no clinically relevant differences found in the individual PK parameter estimates for CL, 
central (Vc), and peripheral volume of distribution in the mRCC population on the basis of empirical 
Bayes estimates using a population PK approach. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
The MAH has not submitted any new drug-drug interactions studies. Instead available PK-DDI results 
for carboplatin and paclitaxel from Study AVF0757g have been presented. In Study AVF0757g, the PK 
of carboplatin and paclitaxel were evaluated in combination with bevacizumab in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic NSCLC. Carboplatin and paclitaxel plasma concentration data were collected at 
Day 0 and Day 63 and were available for 6 patients in the control arm. In the bevacizumab treated 
arm, 8 and 9 patients had concentration data for paclitaxel and carboplatin, respectively.  
Based on these limited data, there did not appear to be a difference in the exposure of either 
carboplatin or paclitaxel when each was administered alone or in combination with bevacizumab, 
suggesting a lack of PK-DDI when these chemotherapy agents were administered in combination with 
bevacizumab. Patients in the control arm had slightly higher paclitaxel exposure at Day 63 compared 
to Day 0, however, 3 of 8 patients in the bevacizumab treated arm had lower paclitaxel exposure at 
Day 63 compared to Day 0. 
 
 
3.3.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall and across different solid tumours, population pharmacokinetic studies, although not including 
ovarian cancer patients, suggest that PK parameters were similar for bevacizumab across all doses and 
studies, whether administered as a single agent or in combination with chemotherapy, suggesting that 
the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab are not markedly affected by administration of concomitant 
chemotherapy drugs evaluated to date.  
Furthermore, cumulative PK-DDI data to date for bevacizumab given in combination with various 
chemotherapy agents across tumour types, including data in combination with carboplatin or paclitaxel 
mentioned above, do not suggest a potential for a PK-DDI between bevacizumab and chemotherapy 
agents. In addition, the lack of PK-DDI of sufficient magnitude does not necessitate dose modifications 
for the chemotherapeutics and anti-cancer agents used in combination with bevacizumab.  
3.3.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab in ovarian cancer patients are expected to be consistent with the 
well-known PK profile for bevacizumab. 
No further drug-drug interaction studies are considered necessary for the combination of bevacizumab 
with carboplatin and paclitaxel. 
3.4.  Clinical efficacy  
3.4.1.  Dose response studies 
No dose-response studies were submitted (see discussion on clinical efficacy). 
3.4.2.  Main studies  
  Study GOG-0218 
Study GOG-0218 is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre Phase III comparative 
study in women with newly diagnosed, previously untreated, stage III or IV EOC, PPC, or FTC, 
designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel in front-line therapy of ovarian cancer. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
Main inclusion criteria 
The target population for this study comprised patients with a histologic diagnosis of EOC, PPC or FTC; 
FIGO stage III with any gross (macroscopic or palpable) residual disease or FIGO stage IV defined 
surgically at the completion of initial abdominal surgery and with appropriate tissue available for 
histologic evaluation. 
Patients with the following histologic epithelial cell types were eligible: Serous adenocarcinoma, 
endometrioid adenocarcinoma, mucinous adenocarcinoma, undifferentiated carcinoma, clear cell 
adenocarcinoma, mixed epithelial carcinoma, transitional cell carcinoma, malignant Brenner’s tumour, 
or adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (N.O.S.).  
 
 
 
 
To be eligible for enrolment in the study, patients had to be age ≥ 18 years with adequate renal, 
hepatic, haematologic, and coagulation function, and to have a Gynaecology Oncology Group (GOG) 
performance status of 0 - 2 at baseline.  
Main exclusion criteria 
Patients who had received prior therapy with bevacizumab or prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for 
ovarian cancer (chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, or 
hormonal therapy) or previous radiotherapy to the abdomen or pelvis were excluded from the study. 
Patients with malignancies other than ovarian cancer (with certain exceptions for cancers that had a 
very low likelihood of recurrence, as outlined in the study protocols) within 5 years prior to 
randomisation were also excluded. 
Treatments 
The study consisted of three arms (Figure 1): 
  CPP arm: Placebo (5 cycles) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy (6 
cycles), followed by placebo alone (16 cycles) for a total of up to 15 months (22 cycles) of therapy. 
  CPB15 arm: Bevacizumab (5 cycles) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy 
(6 cycles), followed by placebo alone (16 cycles) for a total of up to 15 months (22 cycles) of 
therapy. 
  CPB15+ arm: Bevacizumab (5 cycles) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy 
(6 cycles), followed by bevacizumab alone (16 cycles) for a total of up to 15 months (22 cycles) of 
therapy. 
Figure 1. Design of Study GOG-0218 
Placebo/bevacizumab commenced with Cycle 2. The dose of carboplatin given was based on the 
Calvert formula, with target AUC 6. The dose of paclitaxel of 175 mg/m2 (over 3 hours) could be 
 
 
 
 
 
substituted by docetaxel 75 mg/m2 (over one hour).  If paclitaxel was discontinued for toxicity 
reasons, patients could receive treatment with docetaxel. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives were as follows: 
 
To determine if the addition of 5 concurrent cycles of bevacizumab to 6 cycles of standard therapy 
(carboplatin and paclitaxel [CPB15]) increases PFS when compared to 6 cycles of standard therapy 
alone (CPP) in women with newly diagnosed Stage III (with any gross residual disease) and Stage 
IV, epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. 
 
To determine if the addition of 5 concurrent cycles of bevacizumab plus extended bevacizumab for 
16 cycles beyond the 6 cycles of standard therapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel [CPB15+]) increases 
PFS when compared to 6 cycles of standard therapy (CPP) in women with newly diagnosed Stage 
III (with any gross residual disease) and Stage IV, epithelial ovarian, primary peritoneal, or 
 
 
fallopian tube cancer. 
The secondary objectives were as follows: 
In the event that both CPB15 and CPB15+ regimens were superior to the CPP regimen with respect 
to PFS, to determine whether the CPB15+ regimen prolonged PFS when compared to the CPB15 
regimen. 
 
To determine whether the CPB15 or CPB15+ regimen increased the duration of OS when compared 
with the CPP regimen. 
 
To determine whether the CPB15 or CPB15+ regimen increased the ORR when compared with the 
CPP regimen. 
 
To evaluate the safety profile, as measured by the incidence of adverse events and adverse events 
of special interest, of standard chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) with or without 
bevacizumab. 
 
To determine the impact on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) as measured by the Functional 
Assessment of Cancer Therapy–Ovarian Trial Outcome Index (FACT-O TOI) following treatment 
with the study regimens. 
 
To assess the relationship between angiogenic markers and clinical outcomes, including tumour 
response, PFS, and OS in patients randomised to standard cytotoxic chemotherapy with and 
without bevacizumab. 
 
 
To evaluate genetic signatures as predictors of OS in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. 
To determine whether specific genetic variations are predictive of development of hypertension in 
patients treated with bevacizumab. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was PFS defined as the time from randomisation to disease progression or death 
from any cause, based on investigator assessment. Tumour response and progression were evaluated 
in this study using RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours, see statistical methods).  
The secondary efficacy endpoints were OS and ORR. Overall survival was defined as the time from 
randomisation to death. All reported deaths were included in this analysis. OS for patients who had not 
died (or were not known to have died or were lost to follow-up) at the time of analysis was censored at 
the date the patient was last known to be alive. 
 
 
Objective response was defined as the occurrence of a complete or partial best overall response (CR or 
PR; according to the  RECIST) confirmed by repeat assessment performed by the investigator ≥ 4 
weeks after the criteria for response were first met. Randomised patients who did not meet this 
criterion, including patients for whom post-baseline tumour assessments were not performed, were 
considered non-responders in the analysis of ORR. 
The principal measure used in this study to assess the HRQoL was the self-administered FACT-O TOI 
for ovarian cancer patients. This HRQoL instrument had three subscales: physical well-being (PWB, 7 
items), functional well-being (FWB, 7 items) and the ovarian cancer subscale (OCS, first 12 items 
indicated as “Additional Concerns” on the HRQoL case report form). The principal outcome measure 
was the TOI which consists of PWB + FWB + OCS. The minimum important difference for the TOI score 
is 5 points. A higher score means better HRQoL. 
Sample size 
Planned enrolment specified 1800 patients. The final analysis for the initial primary efficacy endpoint of 
PFS was to take place after the 375th event was observed among patients randomised to the CPP arm. 
If experimental regimen decreased the rate of progression or death by 23%, the study provided 
approximately 90% power to correctly identify that regimen as superior to standard therapy.  
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of the three treatment arms: CPP, CPB15, or 
CPB15+. The two stratification factors for randomisation were the initial GOG performance status (0 
vs. 1 or 2) and the disease stage (macroscopic optimally debulked FIGO Stage III, suboptimally 
debulked FIGO Stage III and FIGO Stage IV). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was double-blind. To maintain the study blind, patients in the CPP received placebo 
throughout the study, and patients in the CPB15 arms received placebo following their bevacizumab 
treatment period. 
Statistical methods 
PFS was formally compared between each experimental arm and the control arm using a one-sided 
p-value from a stratified log-rank test. In the event that both the CPB15 and CPB15  arms were 
statistically superior to the CPP arm with respect to PFS, a formal comparison of PFS between the two 
bevacizumab containing regimens was planned to be performed. 
The overall type I error rate for the primary endpoint of PFS was controlled at a one-sided =0.025. 
This was accomplished by hierarchically ordering the initial and late primary analyses. Specifically, the 
two hypotheses constituting the initial primary analysis were simultaneously tested at a one-sided 
=0.025 level. Only if both hypotheses were rejected (i.e., both CPB15 and CPB15+were statistically 
superior to CPP), would the two experimental arms be formally compared. In this case, the late 
primary analysis would be tested at a one-sided =0.025. Based on the SAP, a total one-sided 
  0.0135 was allocated to each primary analysis of PFS comparing the experimental arm with the 
control arm. Based on this total one-sided , the final p-value boundary for each comparison was 
0.0116 which was calculated based on the following additional factors: (1) a one-sided   0.0043 
spent at the interim analysis that occurred in July 2009, (2) a non-binding futility boundary of HR  1 
at the interim analysis, and (3) the actual ratio of approximately 64% of interim total number of 
events to final total number of events as reported by the GOG in February 2010. A p-value  0.0116 
was considered to have crossed the p-value boundary and was statistically significant. 
 
 
Primary endpoint and sensitivity analysis 
Based on the SAP, the primary analysis was Investigator (INV)-assessed PFS. Patients who progressed 
solely based on rising Cancer Antigen 125 (CA-125) levels were censored at the last tumour 
assessment for which the patient was known to be progression-free. Progression can be based upon 
serum CA-125, only during the period following completion of cytotoxic chemotherapy, if one of the 
three conditions is met: 1. Patients with elevated CA-125 pre-treatment and normalization of CA-125 
must show evidence of CA-125 greater than or equal to two times the upper normal limit on two 
occasions at least one week apart or 2. Patients with elevated CA-125 pre-treatment, which never 
normalizes must show evidence of CA-125 greater than or equal to two times the nadir value on two 
occasions at least one week apart or 3. Patients with CA-125 in the normal range pre-treatment must 
show evidence of CA-125 greater than or equal to two times the upper normal limit on two occasions 
at least one week apart. 
Likewise, patients who received non-protocol- specified cancer therapy (NPT) for ovarian cancer prior 
to disease progression were censored at the last tumour assessment prior to the therapy initiation 
(SAP specified primary analysis). However, these censoring rules did not apply to the GOG protocol 
analysis: in this sensitivity analysis, CA-125 progressions were considered as events and patients were 
not censored for NPT given prior to disease progression.  
Furthermore, PFS was assessed separately by an independent review of radiology studies. Two 
sensitivity analyses were performed for the independent review committee (IRC) assessed PFS. 
Overall, the following sensitivity analyses of PFS were performed: 
  A sensitivity analysis of PFS based on an IRC with censoring for NPT (+ censoring for CA-125 as 
IRC did not receive CA-125 measurements). 
  An analysis of IRC-assessed PFS without NPT censoring. 
  An analysis of INV-assessed PFS without NPT censoring. 
  An analysis of INV-assessed PFS with neither NPT censoring nor CA-125 censoring (GOG protocol 
analysis). Because the CPB15 and CPB15+ arms had identical regimens until Cycle 7 (Week 19), 
PFS events that occurred prior to Cycle 7 were informative for both efficacy comparisons. Thus, in 
the formal PFS comparison of CPB15 versus CPP, PFS data from patients randomized to both 
experimental arms was combined. For this comparison, the PFS event times for patients 
randomized to CPB15+ were censored at the date of Cycle 7 treatment. An analogous use of PFS 
data from the CPB15 arm was made in the comparison of CPB15+ versus CPP. This pooling of PFS 
events was used for the Kaplan-Meier analysis as well as for the log-rank tests and the Cox model. 
Log-rank tests and Kaplan-Meier curves for a standard intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis (without the 
pooling of PFS events occurring prior to Cycle 7 in the active arms) were also reported. 
  An analysis of the impact of discontinuation due to toxicity on INV-assessed PFS. In this analysis, 
PFS time for patients who discontinued study treatment due to toxicity prior to disease progression 
was censored at the time of the last tumour assessment prior to the discontinuation of study 
treatment. 
  Worst-case INV-assessed PFS analyses accounting for missing scheduled assessments. Two 
sensitivity analyses were performed to evaluate the potential impact of missing scheduled tumour 
assessments on each initial primary analysis of PFS (comparison between an experimental arm and 
the control arm) using a PFS event imputation rule. Specifically, if a patient missed two or more 
assessments scheduled immediately prior to the date of the data cut-off, they were counted as 
having progressed on the date of the first of these missing assessments.  
 
 
  A worst-case INV-assessed PFS analysis accounting for early discontinuation. A sensitivity analysis 
was performed to evaluate the potential impact of early discontinuation. In this analysis, 
progressive disease (PD) events were imputed for patients without documented disease 
progression who discontinued protocol treatment for reasons other than disease progression, or 
death or adverse event and who did not complete 22 cycles of study treatment. The date of 
progression for these patients was the date of the last tumour assessment. 
The primary analysis efficacy population was the ITT population, defined as all patients randomised to 
study treatment, irrespective of whether the assigned treatment was actually received. 
The primary safety population (safety-evaluable population) consisted of patients who had received at 
least Cycle 2 of study treatment or beyond.  
A separate exploratory-safety population consisted of patients who received at least one cycle of any 
study treatment.

Recruitment 
The study period was from 14 October 2005 to 22 February 2010. A total of 1873 patients were 
enrolled at 336 centres in Canada, Japan, South Korea, and the United States. 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol for the study originally dated 14 June 2005 was amended eight times as follows: 
  Administrative changes (Amendments 1 and 2). 
  Revision of the entry criteria to include Stage III optimally debulked patients with macroscopic 
residual disease (Amendment 3). 
  Change of the primary endpoint from OS to investigator-assessed PFS and decrease of the sample 
size from 2000 to 1800 patients (Amendment 4). 
  Addition of an exploratory endpoint of PFS as determined by the IRC (Amendment 4). 
  Expanded enrolment to include patients with FTC (Amendment 4). 
  Allowance of unblinding at disease progression (Amendment 4). 
  Addition of a translational research objective to assess whether specific genetic variations predict 
hypertension associated with bevacizumab (Amendment 5). 
  Administrative changes (Amendment 6). 
  Amendments 7 and 8 were instituted subsequent to the unblinding of the study data. These 
amendments consisted of instructions for patients who were continuing to receive open-label 
treatment (Amendment 7) and changes to clinical supplies (Amendment 8). 
Overall, 60 patients (3.2%) in the three treatment arms had a protocol violation involving incorrect 
study drug administration. Additionally, 106 patients (5.7% overall; 27 patients in the CPP arm, 40 in 
the CPB15 arm, and 39 in the CPB15+ arm) had no macroscopic residual disease at study entry.

The percentage of patients who received NPT prior to disease progression was comparable across the 
treatment arms (CPP: 7.2%; CPB15: 8.2%; CPB15+: 6.9%).  
More patients in the CPP (43.8%) and CPB15 (40.8%) arms received post-progression antineoplastic 
therapy than in the CPB15+ arm (33.4%).  
The most common post-progression antineoplastic therapy was chemotherapy; commercially available 
Avastin was prescribed to 4.8% of patients in the CPP arm, 4.0% of patients in the CPB15 arm and 
2.9% of patients in the CPB15+ arm.

Note: CA-125 marker data were not sent to the IRC to determine progression status. Thus, the analysis is similar to 
the INV-assessed PFS analysis which was censored for both NPT and CA-125. 
In the analysis which did not pool events from the CPB15 arm prior to Cycle 7, the stratified HR was 
0.62  (95%  CI  0.50;  0.77:  p<0.0001)  and  the  unstratified  HR  was  0.63  (95%  CI  0.51;  0.78:

Objective response was defined as a complete or partial best overall confirmed response per modified RECIST. The 
95% CIs for response rate and for the difference in response rates were computed using the normal approximation 
to the binomial distribution. The p-value for the unstratified analysis was from the Pearson’s χ2 test. The p-value for 
the stratified analysis was from the Cochran–Mantel–Haenszel test. 
Compared to the investigator analysis, the ORR as determined by the IRC was higher in all three 
treatment arms (CPP: 68.8%; CPB15: 75.4%; CPB15+: 77.4%) as were the differences between the 
CPP arm versus the CPB15 (6.7%) and CPB15+ (8.6%) arms.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) 
A mixed effect model for the TOI scores was built using all scores post-baseline as dependent 
variables, and treatment group, time and interaction between treatment group and time as fixed 
effects and baseline score and age as covariates. Three pre-specified interaction contrasts were tested 
and showed that:  
 
The contrast examining change in HRQoL in the second half of the chemotherapy phase (between 
Cycles 4 and 7) indicated a slightly stronger improvement in TOI scores over this period for 
patients in the CPB15 and CPB15+ arms compared to those for patients in the CPP arm, but this 
was not statistically significant (p=0.0864). 
 
The contrast examining change in HRQoL between the second half of the chemotherapy phase 
(Cycles 4 and 7) and the latter portion of the extended treatment phase (Cycles 13 and 21) 
indicated a statistically significant improvement in TOI scores over time for patients in the CPB15+ 
arm compared to those for patients in the CPP arm (p=0.0008). This change (2.6 points) did not 
exceed the minimally important difference of 5 points. 
 
The contrast examining change in TOI scores during the latter portion of the extended treatment 
phase (Cycles 13 and 21) found no statistically significant difference between the CPB15 and 
CPB15+ arms (p=0.8236). 
Figure 7 displays the changes from baseline in TOI scores in each treatment arms.

Subgroup analysis of OS 
Overall, the subgroup analyses of OS were generally consistent (data not shown).  
  Study BO17707 
Study BO17707 is a multicentre, randomised, open-label, controlled phase III study designed to 
investigate the efficacy and safety of bevacizumab in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel in 
front-line therapy of ovarian cancer.  
METHODS 
Study Participants 
Main inclusion criteria 
The target population for this study comprised patients with histologically confirmed EOC, FTC or PPC 
and  high-risk  early  stage  (FIGO  Stage  I  +  IIA:  Grade  3  -  poorly  differentiated)  or  advanced  stage 
(FIGO Stage IIB – IV: Grade 1 - well differentiated, Grade 2 - moderately differentiated, or Grade 3).  
Enrolment was limited in any individual country or group to a maximum of 10% of FIGO Stage I + IIA 
patients. Patients with clear cell carcinoma (defined as either ≥ 50% clear cell elements present or 
reported as clear cell carcinoma by the local pathologist) of any stage were eligible due to the poorer 
prognosis associated with this subtype. Patients with previous early stage EOC or FTC treated with 
surgery alone were eligible at the time of diagnosis of abdominopelvic recurrence as long as no further 
interval cytoreductive therapy was planned prior to disease progression. Patients should have already 
 
 
 
 
 
undergone surgical debulking, by a surgeon experienced in the management of ovarian cancer, with 
the aim of maximal surgical cytoreduction. Patients with Stage III and IV disease in whom initial 
surgical debulking was not appropriate were still eligible provided that the patient had a histological 
diagnosis and debulking surgery prior to disease progression was not foreseen. There must have been 
no planned surgical debulking prior to disease progression. To be eligible for enrolment, patients also 
had to be age  18 years with adequate renal, hepatic, haematologic, and coagulation function, and to 
have a ECOG performance status of 0 - 2 at baseline.  
Main exclusion criteria 
Patients who had received prior therapy with bevacizumab or prior systemic anti-cancer therapy for 
ovarian cancer (e.g., chemotherapy, monoclonal antibody therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, or 
hormonal therapy) or previous radiotherapy to the abdomen or pelvis were excluded from the study. 
Patients with malignancies other than ovarian cancer (with certain exceptions for cancers that had a 
very low likelihood of recurrence, as outlined in the study protocols) within 5 years prior to 
randomisation were also excluded. 
Treatments 
The study consisted of two arms (Figure 9): 
  CP arm: Carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy for 6 cycles. 
  CPB7.5+ arm: Bevacizumab (7.5 mg/kg q3w) in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
chemotherapy for 6 cycles, followed by therapy with bevacizumab alone for a total of up to 12 
months (18 cycles) of treatment. 
Figure 9. Design of Study BO17707 
Bevacizumab started with Cycle 2 if treatment was initiated within 4 weeks of surgery or with Cycle 1 if 
treatment was initiated more than 4 weeks after surgery.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatment in the CPB7.5+ arm continued for a total of 12 months of therapy, or until disease 
progression/unacceptable toxicity. 
The recommended dose of carboplatin to be given was AUC6, however, the initial carboplatin dose 
(between AUC5 and AUC7.5) could be selected according to the standard practice of the individual 
GCIG groups. The dose of paclitaxel was 175 mg/m2 administered over 3 hours. Patients who 
discontinued paclitaxel treatment could continue treatment with carboplatin (with or without 
bevacizumab according to randomisation). If carboplatin therapy was discontinued, patients could 
continue to receive paclitaxel and cisplatin could be substituted for carboplatin, at the discretion of the 
treating physician. Paclitaxel could not be substituted with docetaxel. 
Following completion of 6 cycles of carboplatin and paclitaxel treatment, patients in the CP arm were 
followed up every 6 weeks for a further 36 weeks. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint for this study was PFS defined as the time from randomisation to the time of first 
documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first. Progression (based on RECIST) 
was only considered on radiological or clinical grounds, and progression based on CA-125 had to be 
confirmed by CT scan. If the scan was negative, the patient remained on study.  
Secondary endpoints were OS (defined as the time from randomisation to death), ORR (Patients were 
classified as responders if their best overall response was either confirmed CR or PR patients without 
any assessments were regarded as non-responders), duration of tumour response, biological 
progression-free interval (PFIBIO) defined as time to CA-125 progression, and quality of life.  
Sample size 
The planned sample size was 1444 patients randomised at a steady rate over a period of 24 months 
with an additional 12 months follow-up after the last patient was randomised (36 months after the first 
patient was enrolled). Based on this sample size, the trial had 93% power (two-sided test, significance 
level of 5%) to show a 28% change in PFS from a median value of 18 months in the control arm to 23 
months in the bevacizumab arm i.e. a HR of 0.78. It was expected that 788 PFS events would have 
occurred at this point. To achieve 90% power (two-sided test, significance level of 5%) required 684 
events. 
The trial was also powered to detect an improvement in OS. A total of 715 deaths needed to be 
observed in the two treatment arms in order to be able to demonstrate a 19% improvement in OS 
from a median value of 43 months in the control arm to 53 months in the bevacizumab arm i.e. a HR 
of 0.81 with 80% power at a significance level of 5% (two-sided test). Given a total sample size of 
1444 patients and assuming linear recruitment over a period of 24 months, it was expected that 715 
deaths would have occurred 36 months after the last patient was randomised, approximately 24 
months after the final analysis of the PFS endpoint. To allow for non-compliance of the order of 5%, 
1520 patients were to be enrolled, 760 in each treatment arm. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomised to receive either chemotherapy (carboplatin and paclitaxel) alone (control 
arm) or chemotherapy plus bevacizumab (research arm) in a 1:1 ratio through a central randomisation 
process, using the following stratification factors: 
 
FIGO stage (category 1: stage I-III with residual disease ≤ 1 cm, category 2: Stage IIII with 
residual disease > 1 cm, category 3: FIGO stage IV and inoperable FIGO stage III). 
 
Intent to start chemotherapy ≤ 4 weeks following surgery versus intent to start chemotherapy 
> 4 weeks after surgery. 
 
 
  GCIG group (only included for logistical reasons and not included in stratified analysis). 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was unblinded.  
Statistical Methods 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
For the primary endpoint PFS, the log-rank test (non-stratified) at an α-level of 5% was used to test 
the difference between the CP arm and the CPB7.5+ arm. The following sensitivity analyses of PFS 
were performed: 
 
Time to censoring analysis. A Kaplan-Meier plot of the time to censoring in the different 
treatment arms was generated to investigate differences in follow-up time. In this analysis, 
patients who had an event were censored at the date of their event and patients without an 
event were regarded as having had an event at the censoring date. 
  Missing assessments analysis. A sensitivity analysis was performed investigating the effect of 
missing assessments followed by an assessment of PD/recurrence. In this analysis the missing 
assessment was considered to be PD/recurrence. 
  Worst case analysis was used to assess the effect of incomplete tumour assessment follow-up 
information (in this type of analysis, all patients with incomplete tumour assessment follow-up 
were considered as having an event). For the PFS endpoint, patients with incomplete tumour 
assessment follow-up were patients who had not progressed or died and who did not have a 
follow-up for progression within 3 months prior to clinical cut-off for the first year following 
randomisation and 6 months during years 2 and 3 after randomisation. There was no 
scheduled tumour assessment after year 3. These patients were counted as having an event at 
the last time they were known to be progression free by radiographical imaging. 
  Before start of non-study anti-neoplastic treatment analysis. PFS before start of non-study 
anti-neoplastic treatment was defined as the time between randomisation and the date of first 
documented disease progression or death, whichever occurred first and only if it occurred 
before the start of non-study antineoplastic treatment (including surgery for ovarian cancer). 
Multiple Cox regression analyses were performed in order to assess the robustness of the conclusions 
drawn from the primary analysis of PFS.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
Overall survival: Kaplan-Meier curves and estimates are provided. The final analysis of OS would take 
place when 715 deaths had occurred.  
Objective Response Rates: Summary tables with the number and proportion of responders and non-
responders in each of the treatment groups, together with the two-sided 95% Pearson-Clopper 
confidence intervals for response rates were provided. The rates and the corresponding 95% Pearson-
Clopper confidence intervals for each of the response categories (CR, PR, SD, PD, Missing) by 
treatment group were also presented. A Chi-square test with Schouten correction was used to test for 
treatment differences between the bevacizumab and the control arm.  
Duration of Tumour Response:  Kaplan-Meier curves and estimates were provided of the “Responders”, 
“RECIST Responders” and “CA-125 Responders” but no formal hypothesis testing was performed as 
this analysis was based on a non-randomised subset of patients. Hazard ratios and confidence intervals 
 
 
 
were displayed. RECIST Response outputs were produced for the sub-population of patients with 
measurable disease at baseline, which was considered the primary population for this analysis.  
Quality of Life Analysis: Summary statistics for the assessment scores from the three QoL 
questionnaires EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-OV28 and EuroQol EQ-5D were presented for the two 
treatment groups at each scheduled visit, together with the change from baseline. Plots of mean 
values and standard error of the mean values by treatment group over time and the change from 
baseline were depicted for each scale or item from the three QoL questionnaires up to cycle 18, or on 
day 1 of cycle 1 of second-line therapy for those patients who progress. 
For the secondary efficacy parameters, all tests were performed at a two-sided 5% alpha level. No 
adjustment for the multiplicity of testing was performed. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Overall 1528 patients were enrolled in the study and randomised into one of the two study arms; 764 
patients  were  randomised  to  the  CP  arm  and  764  patients  were  randomised  to  the  CPB7.5+  arm.  
Disposition of study patients is illustrated in Figure 10. 
 
 
 
Figure 10. Disposition of Patients: Study BO17707 
Recruitment 
The study period was from 18 December 2006 to 28 February 2010. A total of 1528 patients were 
enrolled at 263 centres in 8 European countries (Denmark, Finland, Germany, U.K., France, Norway, 
Sweden and Spain) and 3 non-European countries (Canada, Australia and New Zealand). 
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was finalized in June 2006 and amended four times. The major changes were the 
modification of the inclusion criteria to allow enrolment of inoperable stage III patients, for whom de-
bulking surgery was not foreseen prior to disease progression, and the increase of the maximum time 
allowed between surgery and study treatment start from 6 to 8 weeks.

A greater proportion of patients in the CP arm (7%) were started on NPT prior to disease progression 
than in the CPB7.5+ arm (3%). The most common of these were surgical and medical procedures (CP: 
2%;  CPB7.5+:  1%).  Antineoplastic  therapy  given  following  disease  progression  (i.e.,  second-line 
treatment) was reported in more patients in the CP arm (41%) than in the CPB7.5+ arm (33%). The 
most  common  therapies  in  both  treatment  arms  were  cytotoxic  antibiotics  and  platinum  compounds. 
Non-Protocol-Specified  bevacizumab  administration  at  any  time  prior  to  or  post  progressive  disease 
was given to 11 (1%) of the patients in the CP arm and 3 (<1%) of the patients in the CPB7.5+ arm.

  Cox Regression Analysis of PFS  
An exploratory multiple Cox regression analysis was performed in Study BO17707 with various pre-
defined prognostic factors, i.e. treatment and all prognostic factors were included in one model. The 
stratification factors were also added to the model in the unstratified analysis.  
The results showed a statistically significant treatment effect with respect to PFS in favour of the 
CPB7.5+ arm (HR 0.70; p < 0.0001). Significant prognostic factors for PFS were ECOG performance 
status at baseline (ECOG 1 vs. 0: p=0.0006, ECOG 2 vs. 0: p=0.0001), degree of differentiation 
(Grade 2 vs. 1: p=0.0079, Grade 3 vs. 1: p=0.0113), FIGO stage and outcome of surgery (FIGO Stage 
I-III suboptimally debulked vs. Stage I-III optimally debulked: p < 0.0001, FIGO Stage IV and 
inoperable Stage III vs. Stage I-III optimally debulked: p < 0.0001), origin of cancer (PPC vs. EOC: 
p=0.0012), histological sub-type (mucinous vs. serous: p < 0.0001) and CA-125 at baseline ( 2 x

3.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study GOG-0218 
Overall  the  demographic  characteristics  were  well  balanced  between  the  three  treatment  arms.  The 
majority of the patients in all study arms were White (app. 87%), mean age was 65.9-71.6 years, and 
median body weight was 66.8-68.0 kg. 
Baseline disease characteristics were well balanced across the three treatment arms. Study GOG-0218 
enrolled patients with optimal (macroscopic) or sub-optimal FIGO stage III or IV EOC, FTC or PPC. The 
majority  of  the  patients  in  all  arms  had  Stage  III  suboptimal  debulked  disease.  The  primary  site  of 
cancer was the ovary. The majority of patients in all arms had serous adenocarcinoma histologic type. 
Most patients (73.6% - 75.6%) had poorly differentiated tumours (Grade 3). 
Protocol violations were overall equally distributed among treatment arms at relative low numbers. It 
is considered unlikely that these protocol violations should have threatened the overall integrity of the 
study.   
The CHMP acknowledged that the reliability of CA-125 to determine progression is controversial. 
Although widely used in clinical practice, there is evidence that initiation of therapy solely based on CA-
125 elevations has not resulted in improved OS benefits. This may indicate that frequent controls of 
CA-125 are not deemed necessary in this palliative setting. However, CA-125 is still considered the 
most reliable tumour marker with a sensitivity of 85% (all stages) and CA-125 measurements continue 
to  play an important role in the monitoring of patients with ovarian cancer, although limitations exist 
which should be kept in mind. In GOG-0218 study, criteria for progression based on rising serum CA-
125 levels in the absence of clinical or radiographic evidence of progression were given.  
Based on the SAP-specified primary analysis of INV-based PFS, patients who progressed solely based 
on rising CA-125 levels were censored at the last tumour assessment. 
Likewise, patients who received NPT for ovarian cancer prior to documented disease progression were 
censored at the last tumour assessment. These censoring rules may lead to some degree of bias as 
these biochemical CA-125-progressions will often precede clinical/radiographic progressions (“informed 
censorings”).  
Therefore, the GOG-specified sensitivity analysis of INV-based PFS in which CA-125 progressions were 
also counted as events is considered a more conservative and reliable estimate of the true treatment 
effect of bevacizumab in the first-line setting of ovarian cancer. It is possible that this analysis may 
slightly underestimate the true treatment effect of bevacizumab as some of these CA-125 elevations 
may not precede true disease progressions but rather represent the result of an unclear interaction 
between CA-125 and bevacizumab. Therefore, the CHMP recommended that the MAH investigates this 
potential interaction. This analysis is not expected to change the observed benefits as conservative 
efficacy estimates already were calculated on this basis.  
In the updated analysis not censored for CA-125 elevations or NPT, a total of 1252 PFS events had 
been recorded at the time of data cut-off: 440 (70.4%) in the CPP arm, 435 (69.6%) in the CPB15 arm 
and 377 (60.5%) in the CPB15+ arm. In the CPB15+ arm, the HR indicated a reduction of 30% in the 
risk of progression or death compared to the CPP arm (stratified HR 0.70, p-value <0.0001). The 
median time to progression or death was longer in the CPB15+ arm (14.7 months) compared with the 
CPP arm (10.6 months). The gain in PFS observed in the updated analysis gives indications of a 
clinically relevant benefit of the front-line therapy with bevacizumab.  
Overall, subgroup analyses of the SAP-defined INV-based PFS assessment demonstrated consistent 
results, also in patients with poor prognostic factors such as poorer PS, old age, clear cell tumours, 
poorly differentiated tumours and stage IV disease.  
 
 
In addition, the results of the PFS analysis for patients with optimally debulked disease for study GOG-
0218 (protocol-specified analysis without censoring for CA-125 or NPT) provided reassurance that the 
results  seen  in  this  subgroup  analysis  are  consistent  with  the  PFS  analysis  in  the  overall  patient 
population in study GOG-218. 
The MAH has submitted exploratory analyses of relapse patterns and of the time between treatment 
discontinuation due to an AE and disease progression. The median duration of time between 
discontinuation and progressive disease was the same (8.3 months) in all treatment arms so there was 
no indication of a rebound effect in the bevacizumab arms. Therefore there is no indication that 
bevacizumab impacts the pattern of relapse or the timing of disease progression in patients who 
discontinued treatment due to an adverse event.  
The updated OS data set was still not completely mature, with 36% deaths observed. The HR for OS 
was consistent with previous estimates [0.90 (95% CI: 0.74 – 1.08; p= 0.1253)]. The median OS was 
43.4 months in the CPB15+ arm vs. 39.4 months in the CPP. Based on these results, it was possible to 
conclude that no detrimental effect on OS in patients treated with the CPB15+ regimen was expected, 
in  line  with  the  recommendations  provided  in  the  CHMP  Guideline  on  the  Evaluation  of  Anticancer 
Medicinal Products for Human Use about supportive data on OS when PFS is the primary endpoint.  
Furthermore,  the  MAH  has  submitted  an  update  of  later  lines  of  therapies  in  both  studies.  Based  on 
these results, the majority of patients received chemotherapies as secondary or tertiary treatments. In 
GOG-0218, 67.7% of patients in the CPP arm received chemotherapy vs. 60.5% in the CPB15+ arm. 
Commercially available Avastin was given to 20.2% in the CPP arm and bevacizumab was continued in 
12.2% of patients in the CPB15+ after disease progression. This may confound OS results and limit the 
interpretability of further follow-up data. Nevertheless, further follow-up is needed to further clarify the 
benefit-risk of the product and the MAH will be requested to provide this analysis by 31/03/2012 (see 
Annex II of the PI).   
Regarding QoL, although small improvements were observed in favour of the CPB15+ arm, no clinically 
meaningful differences were observed between treatment arms.  
Based on the overview of the ongoing activities in the search of a predictive biomarker for 
bevacizumab the CHMP requested the MAH to submit the results from the GOG-218 study on the 
correlation of plasma markers for VEGF-A with PFS and OS analyses in order to be identified whether 
VEGF-A is of predictive value for the activity of bevacizumab, and refine the understanding on the 
benefit-risk balance of the product in different subpopulations.  
In reply to the CHMP request the MAH committed to submit the plasma biomarker results for VEGF-A 
from study GOG-218 with PFS and OS analyses by 31/06/2012 (see Annex II of the PI).  
Study BO17707 
The key demographic characteristics were similar between the treatment arms. The majority of 
patients were White (96%) and the median age was app. 57.0 years; median body weight was app. 65 
kg. 
Disease characteristics were equally distributed across the two treatment arms. Approximately 18% of 
patients enrolled in each study arm in BO17707 had an early Stage of disease at baseline (FIGO stage 
IA-IIC).  However,  the  majority  of  patients  had  Stage  IIIC  disease  (57%)  whereas  the  proportion  of 
patients  with  stage  IV  disease  only  represented  14%.  This  number  was  higher  in  study  GOG-0218 
(approximately  25%).  The  primary  site  of  cancer  was  the  ovary  (87-88%)  and  most  tumours  were 
serous adenocarcinomas (69%) with poor differentiation (Grade 3: 71-74%). 
 
 
 
In  general,  patients  should  already  have  undergone  surgical  debulking  with  the  aim  of  maximal 
surgical  cytoreduction  before  enrolment.  With  amendment  3,  inclusion  of  patients  with  inoperable 
disease  in  whom  initial  surgical  debulking  was  not  appropriate  was  allowed  provided  that  the  patient 
had  a  histological  diagnosis  and  debulking  surgery  prior  to  disease  progression  was  not  foreseen. 
These amendments are considered acceptable.  
In the updated analysis of PFS, the hazard ratio indicated a 14% reduction in the risk of progression or 
death in the CPB7.5+ arm compared with the CP arm. Median time to progression or death was longer 
in the CPB7.5+ arm (19.3 months) compared with the CP arm (16.9 months), translating into a gain in 
median PFS of 2.4 months. 
Furthermore, the results of the PFS analysis for patients with optimally debulked disease in study 
Study BO17707 demonstrated robustness of the primary analysis of PFS. In response to the concerns 
expressed by the CHMP, the MAH has furthermore, provided information on the proportion of patients 
with progression or death at three month intervals for the original PFS analysis, and described the 
Kaplan-Meier curves in more detail. From the data provided, event rates decreased in both treatment 
arms over time which does not support the idea of accelerated disease progression upon treatment 
discontinuation.  
In addition, the MAH submitted a worst-case sensitivity analysis in study BO17707 in which all patients 
with early discontinuations were counted as having an event. This confirmed the result of the primary 
analysis although the outcome was slightly less favourable as expected from this very conservative 
estimate.      
The MAH has submitted the results of exploratory analyses of relapse patterns and of the time between 
treatment discontinuation due to an AE and disease progression. In an updated analysis the median 
time between discontinuation of chemotherapy due to AEs and disease progression was 9.8 months in 
the CP arm vs. 9.7 months in the CPB7.5+ arm. 
In conclusion, these data do not indicate a negative impact of bevacizumab on the pattern of relapse 
or the timing of disease progression in the subset of patients who discontinued treatment due to AEs. 
At the time of the updated OS analysis, only 24% of patients had died. A consistent OS result was 
observed compared to the original analysis: HR for OS was 0.85 (p= 0.1167). The updated OS analysis 
allows excluding a detrimental effect of bevacizumab on OS in line with the recommendations provided 
in the CHMP Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products for Human Use about 
supportive data on OS when PFS is the primary endpoint. Study BO17707 has a prespecified final 
analysis for overall survival to be conducted when 715 deaths will have occurred in the study according 
to the protocol. Further follow-up is needed to further clarify the benefit-risk of the product and the 
MAH is requested to provide this analysis by  31/12/2013 (see Annex II of the PI).   
Overall, there were no documented differences in QoL between treatment arms apart from the results 
in one EORTC QLQ-OV28 subscale indicating that patients in the CPB7.5+ arm experienced a greater 
extent of “chemotherapy side effects”.  
The CHMP expressed their concern regarding the limited evidence of a clinically relevant benefit at an 
acceptable toxicity level for patients with early high risk stages of EOC at the proposed dosage. As a 
result, the CHMP excluded this patient population from the indication and included patients with 
advanced (FIGO stages III B, III C and IV) ovarian cancer. The recommendation on dose and duration 
of treatment for patients with advanced disease remained the same.  
The MAH has submitted an overview of the ongoing activities in the search of a predictive biomarker 
for bevacizumab. The MAH is expected to submit the plasma biomarker results for VEGF-A from study 
BO17707 with PFS analysis by 31/06/2012 (see Annex II).  
 
 
3.4 Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP considered that both studies GOG-0218 and BO17707  provide robust evidence for clinically 
significant effects of front-line bevacizumab treatment either only concurrently with carboplatin and 
paclitaxel  or concurrently with carboplatin and paclitaxel  followed by extended bevacizumab 
treatment, in women with newly diagnosed previously untreated, Stage IIIB, IIIC and IV ovarian 
cancer. 
The CHMP has requested  the following obligations to be included as conditions in Annex II:  
- To submit results from the pre-specified final analysis for Overall Survival from study BO17707 by 
31/12/2013. 
- To submit final OS data from study GOG-0218 by 31/03/2012. 
- To submit results from the plasma biomarker for VEGF-A from study BO17707 with PFS analysis as 
well as the results from the GOG-218 study on the correlation of plasma markers for VEGF-A with PFS 
and OS analyses by 31/06/2012.  
3.5.  Clinical safety 
The cut-off date for safety data in study GOG-0218 was February 5, 2010. The primary safety analysis 
in study GOG-0218 was performed on the safety-evaluable population (N = 1816), which comprised all 
randomised patients who received at least one full or partial dose of any study treatment during 
Cycle 2 or later. The cut-off date for safety data in study BO17707 was February 28, 2010. The safety 
analysis population in study BO17707 comprised all patients exposed to study drug (N = 1509).  
Patient exposure 
The extent of exposure to chemotherapy and bevacizumab/placebo in studies GOG-0218 and BO17707 
is summarized in Table 27.

The most common adverse events in both studies occurred in the system organ classes gastrointestinal 
disorders (abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting), nervous system disorders 
(headache, peripheral sensory neuropathy), general disorders and administration site conditions 
(fatigue), skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (alopecia), and musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders (myalgia). 
The majority of patients in study GOG-0218 reported Grade 4 events (range 60.9%–66.0% across 
treatment groups) whereas the majority of patients in study BO17707 reported Grade 3 events (range 
45.2–54.6% across treatment groups). The number of patients who experienced an adverse event 
leading to death (Grade 5 AEs) was 27 patients in GOG-0218 and 11 patients in study BO17707.

The proportion of patients with any AE of special interest was similar across the three treatment arms 
of GOG-0218, but in BO17707 was higher in the CPB7.5+ arm than in the CP arm.  
The proportion of patients with AESIs in GOG-0218 CPB15+ arm was higher than in the BO17707 
CPB7.5+ arm (97.2% vs. 74.0%); the difference is mainly accounted for by neutropenia (95.4% vs. 
28.3%) and is due to the differences in the collection of laboratory parameters and hence reporting of 
AEs between the studies. There were also small differences between the studies in the proportion of 
patients in the bevacizumab arms with hypertension.  
Arterial Thromboembolic Events 
The incidence of arterial thromboembolic events was higher in the bevacizumab-containing treatment 
arms than in the respective control arms across both studies. The incidence of events was higher after 
the chemotherapy treatment than during chemotherapy. The majority of events were Grade  3 in 
severity. In GOG-0218 the two grade 5 events were in the bevacizumab treatment arms. In BO17707, 
one grade 5 event occurred in the control arm and two in the bevacizumab arm. 
In both studies, adverse events with a MedDRA preferred term of “embolism” without further 
qualification or characterization by the investigator were categorized as arterial thromboembolic events 
according to the standard coding practices of the sponsors. Medical review found that 35 of the 52 
arterial thromboembolic events in study GOG-0218, and 13 of the 38 arterial thromboembolic events in 
study BO17707 reported as “embolism” were venous thromboembolic events. 
Bleeding (CNS and Non CNS) 
The incidence of all bleeding events in both studies was higher in all bevacizumab arms compared with 
the respective control arms. The majority of bleeding events in both studies were non-CNS bleeding 
events (in particular, epistaxis), and the majority of those events were Grade 1 or 2 in severity. CNS 
bleeding events were reported for three patients in each study. Most events were reported during the 
chemotherapy treatment phase. 
Congestive Heart Failure (CHF) 
In study GOG-0218, CHF events were reported only in the CPB15+ arm (3 patients, 0.5%), all of 
whom experienced Grade 3 left ventricular systolic dysfunction during the period from Cycle 2 to the 
start of Cycle 7. One of these patients also reported Grade 3 cardiomyopathy. In study BO17707, three 
patients in each arm experienced CHF events.  
Febrile Neutropenia 
In study GOG-0218, the incidence of febrile neutropenia in the two bevacizumab-containing treatment 
arms was higher than that in the CPP arm. All events of febrile neutropenia were either Grade 3 or 4 in 
severity. All events were reported prior to Cycle 7. In study BO17707, the incidence of febrile 
neutropenia was higher in the CPB7.5+ arm than the CP arm. Most febrile neutropenia events were 
Grade 3 or 4 in severity.  
Fistula/Abscess 
Overall incidence rates of fistulae and abscesses were similar across both studies, with a higher 
incidence of events recorded in both extended bevacizumab treatment arms. There were no Grade 5 
fistulae or abscesses in either study. 
Gastrointestinal Perforation 
The incidence rates of gastrointestinal (GI) perforations were higher in all bevacizumab-containing 
treatment arms compared to the control arms across both studies. Only patients in the bevacizumab-
containing treatment arms had GI perforations leading to death. 
 
 
The majority of GI perforations (any grade) reported in study GOG-0218 occurred prior to Cycle 7, 
with the exception of two patients in the CPB15+ arm who experienced large-intestine perforations 
after Cycle 7. The longer course of bevacizumab treatment did not appear to lead to an increased 
incidence of GI perforations compared to the shorter course of bevacizumab treatment. The majority of 
GI perforations were Grade  3 events. Six patients experienced large-intestine perforations leading to 
death: 4 patients in the CPB15 arm, and 2 patients in the CPB15+ arm. No Grade 4 or 5 GI 
perforations were reported for patients in the CPP arm. All fatal events occurred prior to Cycle 7.  
In study BO17707, all GI perforations were Grade  3 events and most occurred after the 
chemotherapy phase. One patient in the CPB7.5+ arm had an intestinal perforation that resulted in 
death. An additional patient in the CPB7.5+ arm experienced a serious adverse event of “abdominal 
pain” which led to death, but the cause of death was recorded as “gastrointestinal perforation”. This 
patient does not appear under GI perforations in any summary tables of adverse events. There were 
no Grade 5 GI perforations reported for patients in the control arm. In BO17707, there were no GI 
perforation events in patients with early stage (FIGO I and FIGO II) disease. 
Overall the incidence rates of GI perforation were within the known safety profile of the drug: up to 2% 
across all labelled indication within the current product information. 
Hypertension 
In study GOG-0218, a higher incidence of hypertension was observed in the bevacizumab-containing 
treatment arms compared with the CPP arm. During the period from Cycle 2 to the start of Cycle 7, the 
proportions of patients reporting hypertension events was comparable in the two bevacizumab 
treatment arms and higher than the control arm. During the period from Cycle 7 onwards, patients in 
the CPB15+ arm had a higher incidence of hypertension. The majority of events were Grade 1 or 2 
events.  
In study BO17707, more patients in the CPB7.5+ arm experienced hypertension events compared with 
the CP arm. The numbers of patients reporting hypertension events was similar during and after the 
chemotherapy phase. The majority of hypertension events were Grade 1 or 2. 
There were no Grade 5 hypertension events in either study. 
Neutropenia 
The rate of neutropenia was higher in the GOG-0218 study compared to the BO17707 study due to the 
methods of data. In GOG grade  3 laboratory values were recorded as AEs regardless of whether the 
investigator considered them clinically relevant.  
In study GOG-0218, the majority of patients experienced an adverse event of decreased neutrophil 
count, the incidence rate of which was similar across all three treatment groups. More patients 
reported neutropenia during the chemotherapy phase than in the period from Cycle 7 onwards. The 
majority of events were Grade  3 events.  
The incidence of adverse events reported as “neutropenia” in GOG-0218 separate from the grading of 
laboratory values was higher in the bevacizumab-containing treatment arms (CPB15: 8.6%; CPB15+: 
8.4%) than in the control arm (CPP: 6.7%). One patient in the CPB15 arm and three patients in the 
CPB15+ arm had adverse events of neutropenia leading to death which occurred during the period 
from Cycle 2 to the start of Cycle 7. There were no Grade 5 neutropenia events in the CPP arm. 
In study BO17707, the overall incidence of adverse events reported as neutropenia was essentially the 
same in both arms (CP 28.7% and CPB7.5+ 28.3%) consistent with that seen in other studies with 
bevacizumab across indications. Most events occurred during the chemotherapy phase and there were 
no Grade 5 neutropenia events in either study arm.  
 
 
The incidence of adverse events reported as neutropenia cannot be compared between the GOG-0218 
and BO17707 studies because of the differences in data collections.  
Proteinuria 
In study GOG-0218, the highest incidence of proteinuria was observed in the CPB15+ treatment arm 
and the lowest incidence was observed in the CPB15 arm (CPP 6.5%, CPB15 5.3%, CPB15+ 8.4%). 
Most events were either Grade 1 or 2. There was no Grade 5 proteinuria events reported. 
In study BO17707, the incidence of proteinuria was higher in the CPB7.5+ arm than in the CP arm 
(CPB7.5+: 4.4%; vs. CP: 2.2%). The majority of events of proteinuria in the two treatment arms were 
Grade 1 or 2 in severity.  
Reversible Posterior Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome (RPLS) 
In study GOG-02018, there was one case of RPLS reported. There were no reports in study BO17707 
of any patients experiencing RPLS.  
Venous Thromboembolic Events 
In study GOG-0218, the incidence of venous thromboembolic events was similar across the three 
treatment arms (around 4%). Most events occurred during the chemotherapy period. The majority of 
these events were Grade 3.  
In study BO17707, 6.8% of patients in the CPB7.5+ arm experienced a venous thromboembolic event 
compared with 4.5% in the CP arm. The majority of events occurred during the chemotherapy phase. 
Grade  3 venous thromboembolic events were reported in 12 patients (1.6%) in the CP arm and 
30 patients (4.0%) in the CPB7.5+ arm. Eleven patients (1.5%) in the CPB7.5+ arm had a Grade 4 
event compared with two patients (0.3%) in the CP arm. 
There were no Grade 5 venous thromboembolic events in either study. 
Adverse events with a preferred term of “embolism” unqualified were categorized as arterial 
thromboembolic events. However, medical review revealed that 35/52 arterial thromboembolic events 
across treatment groups in study GOG-0218 and 13/38 arterial thromboembolic events across 
treatment groups in study BO17707 reported as “embolism” were venous thromboembolic events. 
Wound Healing Complications 
In study GOG-0218, the incidence of wound-healing complications/dehiscence events was similar 
across the treatment arms (around 4%). One patient in the CPB15 arm and one patient in the CPB15+ 
arm experienced Grade 4 wound complications. There were no wound-healing complications leading to 
death. 
In study BO17707, wound-healing complications were reported in 4.6% of patients in the CPB7.5+ arm 
compared with 1.6% in the CP arm. The majority of wound-healing complications in the two treatment 
arms were Grade 1 or 2 events. Grade 3 wound-healing complications were recorded for one patient 
(0.1%) in the CP arm and nine patients (1.2%) in the CPB7.5+ arm. No Grade 4 or 5 wound-healing 
complications were reported in either treatment arm. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Study GOG-0218 
 
 
The primary cause of death was categorized by the investigator on the study GOG-0218 follow-up form 
as due to “this disease”, “protocol treatment”, “other cause”, or “unknown”.  
At the time of the safety data cut-off for study GOG-0218, a total of 424 patients (23.3%) from the 
safety-evaluable population had died. Overall fewer patients in the CPB15+ arm died compared with 
the CPB15 and CPP arms (21.5% vs. 24.4% and 24.1%, respectively), and this is specifically due to 
the lower number of deaths classified as due to this disease (19.4% vs. 22.9% and 22.5%, 
respectively). Ovarian cancer/ progressive disease (i.e. death due to this disease) was the most 
common cause of death. The number of deaths due to protocol treatment was lowest in the 
chemotherapy-alone arm (CPP: 0.5%) and highest in the extended bevacizumab arm (CPB15+: 
1.3%). The number of deaths due to other causes was lower in the two bevacizumab-containing 
treatment arms (CPB15: 0.7%; CPB15+ 1.0%) compared with the CPP arm (1.2%), and the number 
of deaths with unknown cause was equal across all three treatment arms (0.5%). Ten patients had 
multiple primary causes of death. 
Study BO17707 
At the time of the safety data cut-off for study BO17707, a total of 238 patients (15.8%) from the 
safety population had died (131 patients in the CP arm, and 107 patients in the CPB7.5+ arm). Table 
924 summarizes all causes of death, with deaths due to disease progression and those deaths with no 
obvious association to ovarian cancer progression presented separately. The number of deaths was 
lower in the CPB7.5+ arm than in the control arm (14.3% vs. 17.2%), reflecting the lower number of 
patients who died as a result of disease progression in the bevacizumab-containing treatment arm 
(11.8% in the CPB7.5+ arm vs. 15.1% in the CP arm; classification based on the primary cause of 
death reported). 
Adverse Events Leading to Death (Grade 5 AEs) 
Study GOG-0218 
In study GOG-0218, 27 patients were reported either on the toxicity form or in NCI Adverse Event 
Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS) as having an adverse event leading to death. Note that deaths 
due to disease progression, when reported as an adverse event by the investigator, were included in 
this analysis. 
The number of patients with adverse events leading to death was higher in the two bevacizumab-
containing treatment arms than in the control arm (9 and 14 patients in the CPB15 and CPB15+ arms, 
respectively, vs. 4 patients in the CPP arm). These adverse events include neutropenic infections and 
gastrointestinal perforations observed during the period that bevacizumab was combined with 
chemotherapy. With the exception of two patients in the CPB15+ arm who died after Cycle 7 of 
treatment (patient nos. 023-0218-012 [sudden death] and 023-0218-022 [disease progression]), all 
other deaths from adverse events occurred during the first six cycles of therapy. 
Study BO17707 
In study BO17707, seven patients in the CP arm and four patients in the CPB7.5+ arm were reported 
on the AE CRF page as having an AE leading to death. Two patients in each treatment arm died 
following a gastrointestinal disorder, three patients died from nervous system disorders (CP: 
2 patients; CPB7.5+: 1 patient), and two patients in the CP arm had a cardiac disorder leading to 
death. 
One patient in the CP arm had an adverse event of disease progression leading to death, and one 
patient in the CPB7.5+ arm had an adverse event of malignant neoplasm leading to death; both 
patients were classified as death due to disease progression following clinical review. One patient was 
 
 
reported to have had a Grade 5 adverse event of abdominal pain but the cause of death was recorded 
as gastrointestinal perforation on the study completion form. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in GOG-0218 were defined as those requiring expedited reporting to 
AdEERS, and SAEs in BO17707 were defined according to standard SAE criteria defined by the protocol 
and based on the ICH GCP.  
The incidence of all-grade adverse events reported to AdEERS or as SAEs was slightly higher in all 
bevacizumab-containing treatment arms compared with the corresponding control arms. System organ 
classes comprising common adverse events associated with laboratory parameters (i.e., investigations, 
metabolism and nutrition disorders, and blood and lymphatic system disorders) cannot be compared 
across studies due to differences in data collection and AE reporting. The most common types of AEs 
reported to AdEERS or as SAEs in the two studies by body system were gastrointestinal disorders, 
infections and infestations, and vascular disorders. 
In study GOG-0218, the only adverse event that was reported to AdEERS with  1% higher incidence 
in a bevacizumab-containing treatment arm relative to the control arm was large intestine perforation 
(CPP: 0 patients, 0.0%; CPB15: 7 patients, 1.2%; CPB15+: 6 patients, 1.0%). In study BO17707, the 
following adverse events reported as SAEs occurred with  1% higher incidence in the CPB7.5+ arm 
relative to the CP arm: abdominal pain, hypertension, vomiting, constipation, embolism, pulmonary 
embolism, and wound complication. 
Laboratory findings 
In summary, the majority of patients in both study arms showed no change in NCI-CTC grade for any 
laboratory test parameter during the treatment phase. The most common Grade 3/4 haematologic 
laboratory abnormalities during the study were low neutrophil count and low white blood cell count, 
whereas the incidence of Grade 3/4 abnormalities in clinical chemistry laboratory parameters was low 
and not markedly different between the study arms. 
Safety in special populations 
  Safety in special populations 
The effects of age (< 65,  65 years) and race (white, non-white) on adverse events of special interest 
and primary cause of death were evaluated for patients treated in studies GOG-0218 and BO17707. A 
breakdown of the patient populations in the two studies by age and race is provided in Table 30. The 
majority of patients across both studies were under 65 years old (range 66.7%–75.7%), and the 
majority of patients were white (range 86.7%–96.5%).

Safety by Age Group 
Overall, a slightly higher proportion of patients in the  65 year age group experienced a Grade  3 
AESI compared with the under-65 year age group across both studies.  
In study GOG-0218, the generally higher incidence of Grade  3 AESIs among bevacizumab-treated 
patients compared with patients in the CPP arm did not appear to be more pronounced for one age 
subgroup than the other, with the possible exception of congestive heart failure and hypertension: the 
three patients in the CPB15+ arm who reported Grade  3 CHF were all aged  65 years old, and the 
incidence of Grade  3 hypertension was higher in patients aged  65 years compared with patients 
under 65 years old. 
In study BO17707, the higher incidence of Grade  3 hypertension in the bevacizumab arm relative to 
the control arm was more pronounced in the  65 year age group than the < 65 year age group. In the 
older age group, a higher proportion of patients in the CP arm reported neutropenia than the 
bevacizumab treatment arm. A higher proportion of patients in the  65 year age group experienced 
AEs reported to NCI AdEERS in study GOG-0218 or serious adverse events in study BO17707.  
In study GOG-0218, the proportion of patients who died in the  65 year age group was higher than 
that in the < 65 age group. In study BO17707, the proportion of patients who died in the  65 year 
age group was higher than that in the < 65 year group. 
Safety by Race 
A comparison of the adverse events of special interest to bevacizumab in white and non-white 
subgroups has been presented. The percentages of white and non-white patients who reported at least 
one Grade  3 AESI were similar across treatment arms within the two studies.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study GOG-0218 a higher proportion of patients in the bevacizumab-containing treatment arms 
discontinued study treatment because of an AE, side effect, or complication than in the CPP arm (CPP: 
58 patients, 9.7%; CPB15: 83 patients, 13.7%; CPB15+: 100 patients, 16.4%).  
In study BO17707, more patients in the bevacizumab-containing treatment arm than in the 
chemotherapy-alone arm discontinued any component of treatment due to adverse events (CP: 
68 patients, 8.9%; CPB7.5+: 164 patients, 22.0%).ae11disca_s001 This difference between the two 
 
                                                                                                  
                                                                                                  
                                                                                                  
                                                                                                  
                                                                                                  
 
 
treatment arms reflects patients who discontinued bevacizumab (CPB7.5+: 118 patients, 15.8%) and 
also reflects to some extent the longer treatment duration in the CPB7.5+ arm compared with the CP 
arm (up to 18 cycles versus 6 cycles, respectively). Around half of all patients who discontinued 
bevacizumab did so during the six cycles when bevacizumab was administered concurrently with 
chemotherapy, and the remainder discontinued bevacizumab during the 12 additional cycles when 
bevacizumab was administered alone. The most common AE leading to discontinuation of bevacizumab 
treatment in the CPB7.5+ arm was hypertension (22 patients, 2.9%). Discontinuation of either 
carboplatin or paclitaxel due to AEs during the six cycles of chemotherapy was similar between the two 
treatment arms. 
Post marketing experience 
The total number of patients exposed to bevacizumab in the post-marketing setting or in clinical trials 
over the six-year period covered by the  Periodic Safety Update Reports (from February 26, 2004 to 
February 25, 2010) is estimated to be approximately 812 640. 
During the six-year period from February 26, 2004 to February 25, 2010, a total of 32 266 adverse 
events, of which 27 222 were serious, were reported in 18 103 (2.2%) patients. In 1950 (0.2%) cases, 
the outcome was fatal.  
3.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the review of AEs in the light of bevacizumab known safety profile did not reveal any 
unexpected findings. 
Safety data have not been pooled due to differences in study design, populations and collection of 
safety information. In particular, the number of all-grade events laboratory events was significantly 
higher in all treatment arms in study GOG-0218 in which events associated with abnormal 
haemoglobin, neutrophil count, platelet count, and white blood cell count were routinely collected on 
the toxicity form, compared with study BO17707 that had stricter criteria for reporting laboratory 
abnormalities as AEs.  
The exposure to carboplatin/paclitaxel was similar across treatment arms and studies (median of 6 
cycles). In GOG-0218, patients in the CPB15+ arm received a median of 13 cycles of bevacizumab. In 
BO17707, patients in the CPB7.5+ arm received a median of 17 cycles of bevacizumab. The overall 
exposure and the extent of the safety database are considered satisfactory for the safety evaluation. 
The most common AEs observed were gastrointestinal disorders, general disorders (fatigue), 
musculoskeletal disorders (myalgia/ arthralgia), nervous disorders (peripheral neuropathy) and skin 
and subcutaneous disorders (alopecia).  
Common AEs associated with carboplatin are myelosuppression (particularly thrombocytopenia), 
nausea/vomiting and peripheral neuropathia. Common adverse events associated with paclitaxel are 
nausea/vomiting, myelosuppression, arthralgia/myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia and 
infections. As expected, these chemo-related toxicities were most frequently observed during the first 
6 cycles of therapy. 
Common AEs associated with bevacizumab are epistaxis, stomatitis, nausea/diarrhoea, hypertension, 
dyspnoea, headache, arthralgia, fatigue. In GOG-0218, dysarthria was more common than previously 
observed (11.8% in the CPB15+ arm), but it was Grade 1 in 90% of patients. In BO17707, the 
incidence of diarrhoea was higher than expected (35% in the CPB7.5 arm). 
At the time of data cut-off in study GOG-0218, the number of deaths was relatively low, and most 
deaths were due to progressive disease with the highest incidence in the control arm. Also, in study 
 
 
BO17707 the number of deaths was relatively low at the time of data cut-off and most deaths were 
attributed to disease progression. Since the distinction between AEs leading to death and deaths due 
to progressions was not very clear in all cases presented, the CHMP reviewed all the cases of deaths 
from causes other than progressive disease as well as the timing and causality (most plausible agent 
responsible).  In some cases the most plausible causes of death were uncertain which is often the case 
in patients with advanced cancer. Most deaths occurred during the concomitant treatment phase which 
makes it difficult to attribute the causality to an individual element of the treatment. No definite 
pattern can be seen regarding timing. In terms of causes, intestinal perforation was considered a 
possible treatment-related cause in 6 out of 17 deaths. In study BO17707, 2 out of 5 cases of grade 5 
events were caused by intestinal perforation in the CPB7.5 arm. Intestinal perforation was also the 
only AE that was reported to AdEERS (SAE) with  1% higher incidence in a bevacizumab-containing 
treatment arm relative to the control arm in study GOG-0218 (CPP: 0 patients, 0.0%; CPB15: 
7 patients, 1.2%; CPB15+: 6 patients, 1.0%). Intestinal perforation is a well-known risk associated 
with treatment with bevacizumab. In the review of events of special interest, the incidence of 
gastrointestinal perforations was not higher in this population of ovarian cancer patients than the 
incidence observed in patients with CRC. The CHMP concluded that based on the observations above, 
more focus should be put on this risk in patients with ovarian cancer in the RMP and in upcoming 
PSURs. In reply to CHMP concern, the MAH has updated the RMP in order to include intestinal 
perforation in the setting of ovarian cancer for bevacizumab and to have additional focus on this risk in 
future PSURs. Furthermore, the MAH is requested to submit a cumulative analysis of GIP cases by 
grade with the upcoming PSURs. 
In study GOG-0218, SAEs were reported in 25.8% of patients in the CPB15+ arm compared to 23.7% 
in the CPB15 arm and 21.3% in the CPP arm. Only large intestine perforation was reported with  1% 
higher incidence in a bevacizumab-containing arm compared to the control arm. In study BO17707, 
SAEs were reported in 37.7% of patients in the CPB7.5+ arm and in 23.5% of patients in the control 
arm. SAEs occurred with  1% higher incidence in the CPB7.5+ arm relative to the CP arm included 
abdominal pain, hypertension, vomiting, constipation, embolism, pulmonary embolism, and wound 
complication. 
More patients in the bevacizumab-containing arms discontinued treatment because of AEs, particularly 
in study BO17707 (22%). Half of the patients discontinued treatment during the concomitant 
chemotherapy/bevacizumab phase. The most common cause of discontinuation was hypertension 
(2.9%). 
The CHMP concluded that the safety profile in study BO17707 does not support a reduction of the 
bevacizumab dosage to 7.5 mg/kg q3w as more toxicity was observed with the lower bevacizumab 
dose; however these results should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations in the design of 
this study that mentioned above. 
3.5.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In conclusion, safety results and adverse drug reactions encountered with the combination of 
carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab from pivotal studies GOG-0218 and BO17707 are as it can be 
expected from the present knowledge of the safety profile of the three drugs. No new safety concerns 
have been identified.   
The following pharmacovigilance activity has been included in RMP:  
The MAH should submit a cumulative analysis of GIP cases by grade with the upcoming PSURs.

Haemorrhage 
Patients treated with Avastin 
have an increased risk of 
haemorrhage, especially tumour-
associated haemorrhage. Avastin 
should be discontinued 
permanently in patients who 
experience Grade 3 or 4 bleeding 
during Avastin therapy. Patients 
with untreated CNS metastases 
were routinely excluded from 
clinical trials with Avastin, based 
on imaging procedures or signs 
and symptoms. Therefore, the 
risk of CNS haemorrhage in such 
patients has not been 
prospectively evaluated in 
randomised clinical studies. 
Patients should be monitored for 
signs and symptoms of CNS 
bleeding, and Avastin treatment 
discontinued in case of 
intracranial bleeding. There is no 
information on the safety profile 
of Avastin in patients with 
congenital bleeding diathesis, 
acquired coagulopathy or in 
patients receiving full dose of 
anticoagulants for the treatment 
of thromboembolism prior to 
starting Avastin treatment, as 
such patients were excluded 
from clinical trials. Therefore, 
caution should be exercised 
before initiating therapy in these 
patients. However, patients who 
developed venous thrombosis 
while receiving therapy did not 
appear to have an increased rate 
of grade 3 or above bleeding 
when treated with a full dose of 
warfarin and Avastin

Cases of ONJ have been reported 
in cancer patients treated with 
Avastin, the majority of whom 
had received prior or 
concomitant treatment with IV 
bisphosphonates, for which ONJ 
is an identified risk. Caution 
should be exercised when 
Avastin and IV bisphosphonates 
are administered simultaneously 
or sequentially. 
Invasive dental procedures are 
also an identified risk factor. A 
dental examination and 
appropriate preventive dentistry 
should be considered prior to 
starting the treatment with 
Avastin. In patients who have 
previously received or are 
receiving IV bisphosphonates 
invasive dental procedures 
should be avoided, if possible.

The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the below pharmacovigilance 
activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance are needed to investigate further some of 
the safety concerns: 
Description 
Due date 
The MAH should perform a cumulative analysis of GIP cases by grade with the

3.8 Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed to update sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to reflect the change in the 
indication.  The  PL  has  been  updated  accordingly.  In  addition,  ''Batch''  has  been  replaced  by  ''lot''  in 
Annex IIIA. Finally, Annex II has been updated in order to include the new version number of the Risk 
Management Plan and the list of conditions. 
The CHMP agreed with the proposed changes. 
3.9  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
  Beneficial effects 
Both  pivotal  studies  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  carboplatin  and  paclitaxel  in  the  front-line 
treatment  of  ovarian  cancer  (study  GOG-0218  and  study  BO17707)  showed  a  statistically  significant 
increase  in  PFS  in  patients  receiving  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  followed  by 
extended  bevacizumab  compared  to  patients  in  the  control  arms.  The  absolute  difference  in  PFS  was 
between  2-4    months  and  the  reduction  in  risk  of progression  or  death  was  about  30%.Furthermore, 
the  observed  PFS  benefit  (4.1  months)  in  study  GOG-218  has  proven  to  be  very  robust  in  sensitivity 
analyses and consistent in subgroup analyses. 
No detrimental effect was shown for OS in any of the studies.  Nevertheless, further follow-up is 
needed to further clarify the benefit-risk of the product and the MAH is requested to provide this 
analysis by 31/03/2012 for study GOG-0218 and by 31/12/2013 for study BO17707 (see Annex II of 
the PI).   
There were no detrimental effects on quality of life according to the results on patient reported 
outcomes.  
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
There were uncertainties regarding the limited evidence of a clinically relevant benefit at an acceptable 
toxicity level for patients with early high risk stages of EOC at the proposed dosage. Therefore this 
patient population has been excluded from the indication and the updated applied indication includes 
patients with advanced (FIGO stages III B, III C and IV) ovarian cancer. The recommendation on dose 
and duration of treatment for patients with advanced disease remained the same.  
 
 
 
 
Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the review of AEs in the light of bevacizumab known safety profile did not reveal any 
unexpected findings. Safety results and adverse drug reactions encountered with the combination of 
carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab from pivotal studies GOG-0218 and BO17707 are as it can be 
expected from the present knowledge of the safety profile of the three drugs. No new safety concerns 
have been identified. 
The most common adverse events observed were gastrointestinal disorders (83-87% across treatment 
arms), general disorders (fatigue), musculoskeletal disorders (myalgia/ arthralgia), nervous disorders 
(peripheral neuropathy) and skin and subcutaneous disorders (alopecia). Of note, common adverse 
events associated with carboplatin are myelosuppression (particularly thrombocytopenia), 
nausea/vomiting and peripheral neuropathia. Common adverse events associated with paclitaxel are 
nausea/vomiting, myelosuppression, arthralgia/myalgia, peripheral neuropathy, alopecia and 
infections. As expected, these chemo-related toxicities were most frequently observed during the first 
6 cycles of therapy. Common AEs associated with bevacizumab are epistaxis, stomatitis, 
nausea/diarrhoea, hypertension, dyspnoea, headache, arthralgia and fatigue. 
In study BO17707, 2 out of 5 cases of grade 5 events were caused by intestinal perforation in the 
CPB7.5 arm. Intestinal perforation was also the only AE that was reported to AdEERS (SAE) with  1% 
higher incidence in a bevacizumab-containing treatment arm relative to the control arm in study GOG-
0218 (CPP: 0 patients, 0.0%; CPB15: 7 patients, 1.2%; CPB15+: 6 patients, 1.0%). Intestinal 
perforation is a well-known risk associated with treatment with bevacizumab. 
Benefit-risk balance 
 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A  reduction  in  the  risk  of  disease  progression  or  death  of  30%  and  an  improvement  between  2-4 
months in median PFS represents an important benefit to patients. In addition, the 4.1 months benefit 
of  PFS  in  study  GOG-218  has  proven  to  be  very  robust  in  sensitivity  analyses  and  consistent  in 
subgroup analyses. 
When adding bevacizumab to a chemotherapy regimen more adverse events and serious adverse 
events were reported for the combination arm than for the chemotherapy alone as expected.  
However, the safety profile for bevacizumab was largely consistent with observations in previous 
bevacizumab studies. No new safety concerns have been identified.   
In conclusion, the AEs encountered with the combination of carboplatin, paclitaxel and bevacizumab 
are as would be expected from the present knowledge of the safety profile of the three drugs. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Efficacy in terms of progression free survival was demonstrated in both GOG-0218 and BO17707 trials. 
The  adverse  events  reported  were  considered  acceptable  for  a  patient  population  with  advanced 
ovarian cancer. The safety profile for bevacizumab is known and generally manageable.  
Therefore the CHMP concluded that the benefit-risk balance of Avastin in combination with carboplatin 
and paclitaxel for the front-line treatment of advanced (FIGO stages III B, III C and IV) epithelial 
ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer is considered as positive, as the demonstrated 
statistically significant improvement of PFS outweighs the added toxicity of bevacizumab. 
 
 
3.10 Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Avastin is not similar to Yondelis within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 1. 
4.  Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends by consensus the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, 
concerning the following change: 
Variation(s) accepted 
Type 
C.I.6.a 
Change(s) to therapeutic indication(s) - Addition of a new 
II 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Extension of indication to add the treatment of Avastin in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
for the front-line treatment of advanced (FIGO stages III B, III C and IV) epithelial ovarian, fallopian 
tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC have been updated to 
reflect the change in the indication. The Risk Management Plan, Annex II and the Package Leaflet have 
been updated accordingly. In addition, a minor change was made to the Labelling.  
The requested variation proposed amendments to the SmPC, Annex II, Labelling and Package Leaflet.

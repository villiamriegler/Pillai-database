2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Clostridioides difficile, is an anaerobic, spore-forming gram-positive bacillus. Strains that cause 
disease in humans produce toxins, in particular C. difficile toxins A and B. CDI occurs when toxigenic 
strains proliferate in the lower gastrointestinal tract after disruption of the normal bacterial colonic 
flora, typically after exposure to antibiotics. 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
Bezlotoxumab is indicated to prevent the recurrence of CDI in adult patients who are receiving 
antibacterial drug treatment for CDI and are at a high risk for CDI recurrence. This application 
provides data to support expanding the use of bezlotoxumab to include paediatric patients one year of 
age and older. The approved dosage regimen of bezlotoxumab in adult patients is 10 mg/kg 
administered as a single IV infusion. The proposed dosage regimen for paediatric patients is the same 
as for adults. 
The proposed amended indication statement reads: 
ZINPLAVA is indicated for the prevention of recurrence of Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) 
in adult and paediatric patients 1 year of age and older at high risk for recurrence of CDI 
(see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Epidemiology and risk factors 
The incidence, severity, rate of complications (e.g., ileus, toxic megacolon), and mortality of CDI in 
adults have increased dramatically in the US, Canada, and Europe over the last 10-15 years 
[Goorhuis, Abraham, et al 2008] [Gravel, Denise, et al 2009] [Loo, Vivian G., et al 2005] [Loo, Vivian 
G., et al 2006][McDonald, L. Clifford, et al 2005] [Pepin, Jacques, et al 2005]. Similarly, CDI incidence 
rates in paediatric patients have increased over time [Kim, Jason, et al 2008] [Zilberberg, M. D., et al 
The risk factors for CDI in paediatric patients appear similar to those for adults (e.g., antibiotic use, 
multiple antibiotics use, and longer duration of hospital stay). In paediatric patients, CDI is also 
strongly associated with additional factors, namely malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), 
and immune suppression [Pant, Chaitanya, et al 2013] [Hojsak, I., et al 2012] [Banaszkiewicz, 
Aleksandra, et al 2012] [Enoch, D. A., et al 2011]. The CDI risk appears to be highest in paediatric 
patients with malignancy [Enoch, D. A., et al 2011] [de Blank, P., et al 2013] [Price, Victoria, et al 
2013] [Tai, E., et al 2011]. A case control study identified additional risk factors for paediatric CDI 
that include solid organ transplant, presence of gastrostomy or jejunostomy tube, receipt of 
fluoroquinolones, and lack of prior hospitalization; however, the last of these may be a result of 
control subjects who were hospitalized [Sandora, T. J., et al 2011]. In children, the majority of cases 
of CDI are community-onset or community-acquired [McFarland, L. V., et al 2016] [Lo Vecchio, A., et 
al 2016]. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 10/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
CDI occurs when toxigenic strains of C. difficile, either endogenous to the colon or exogenously 
acquired, flourish after disruption of the normal bacterial colonic flora, typically following exposure to 
antibiotics that alter the endogenous micro-ecology of the gut, and thus lead to clinically significant 
disease. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Symptoms of paediatric CDI include fever, profuse diarrhoea, abdominal tenderness, abdominal 
distension, leucocytosis, volume depletion, electrolyte imbalance, and occasionally, 
pseudomembranous colitis. Most cases of paediatric CDI are typically mild in severity and self-limiting 
in nature. However, moderate to severe CDI does occur in paediatric patients and accumulating 
evidence indicates that hospital-onset paediatric CDI is associated with increased risk of death, longer 
length of stay, and higher costs as compared to community-onset CDI in children. 
Similar to adults, rCDI occurs in paediatric patients. This is typically due to further acquisition of 
another strain of C. difficile or persistence of the same pathogenic strain in the gut despite treatment, 
in particular in the form of highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial spores. RCDI within 8 weeks of a 
previously successfully treated CDI has been reported in 10.8 to 34.4% of paediatric cases. 
The laboratory diagnosis of CDI requires the demonstration of toxigenic C. difficile or its toxins in 
stool. A number of different tests are used, including enzyme-linked immunoassays (EIAs) for toxins A 
and B; cell culture cytotoxicity assay; anaerobic culture followed by toxin detection; nucleic acid 
amplification tests using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which detects the gene for toxin B; and EIA 
for the C. difficile common antigen glutamate dehydrogenase, which is typically followed by either a 
toxin test or a PCR test [Crobach, M. J., et al 2016]. 
Management 
Treatment of paediatric patients with moderate to severe CDI typically involves discontinuation of 
predisposing antibiotics, supportive measures, and initiating antimicrobial therapy directed against C. 
difficile [Cooperstock, M. S., et al 2012]. Both metronidazole and oral vancomycin have been used as 
standard-of-care regimens to treat paediatric CDI [McFarland, L. V., et al 2016] [American Academy 
of Paediatrics 2015]. Fidaxomicin is a newer antibiotic, which received approval in 2011 in the US and 
other countries for treatment of CDI in adults; however, its safety and efficacy have not yet been 
established in paediatric patients. 
One of the key challenges in the clinical management of CDIs in adults and children is to reduce the 
incidence of recurrent CDI; such recurrences in paediatric patients have been treated with 
tapered/pulsed administration of oral vancomycin, vancomycin followed by rifaximin, intravenous (IV) 
immunoglobulin, and therapy with other microorganisms, including fecal microbiota transplantation 
(FMT) [Kelly, Ciaran P. and LaMont, J. Thomas 2008]. The available limited data for paediatric CDI 
recurrence rates ranges from 7.5% to 38%, which is similar to that seen in adults [Lo Vecchio, A., et 
al 2016] [Kelsen, J. R., et al 2011] [Mezoff, E., et al 2011]. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Bezlotoxumab (MK-6072) is a fully human monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to and 
neutralizes C. difficile toxin B. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 11/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Bezlotoxumab is currently approved for use in adults for the reduction (United States) or prevention 
(European Union) of CDI recurrence in patients who are receiving antibacterial drug treatment for 
CDI and are at a high risk for CDI recurrence. 
Bezlotoxumab does not have antimicrobial activity and does not take the place of antibiotic therapy 
for CDI. Moreover, bezlotoxumab does not impact the initial efficacy of the antibiotics that are used 
to treat CDI because it is administered after the toxins have already caused damage to the gut lining 
and after antibiotics have already significantly reduced the amount of toxin present in the colon. 
When administered concurrently with antibacterial drug treatments for CDI (metronidazole, oral 
vancomycin, or fidaxomicin in adults), bezlotoxumab prevents recurrent infections by providing 
passive immunity against C. difficile toxin B produced by the outgrowth of persistent or newly 
acquired spores, thereby preventing new or further damage to the gut epithelium. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
According to the PIP requirement, the applicant developed a vial of 25ml of 25mg/ml concentrate for 
solution. A summary was provided in Module 2.3.P. This new vial is not authorized yet and therefore 
a separate type II variation is expected. 
Regulatory agency advice was obtained at key points throughout the paediatric development program 
for bezlotoxumab. 
The CHMP notes that the clinical development plan was widely discussed with the FDA. Interactions 
with EMA were limited to the PIP. No CHMP scientific advice was sought. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH provided a statement that clinical trials carried out outside of the European Union meet the 
ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The paediatric clinical development program included a single study (MK-6072-001, also referred to 
as P001). The rationale for the paediatric clinical study was to obtain PK and safety information to 
support the selection of a dose for paediatric patients that would achieve bezlotoxumab exposures 
similar to those obtained in adults at the recommended dose (as a single IV infusion at 10 mg/kg). 
This dose in adults  was shown to be efficacious and generally well tolerated in 2 pivotal Phase 3 
studies. A paediatric dosing regimen that would provide bezlotoxumab exposures (AUC0-inf) within 
the clinical comparability bounds (0.6, 1.6) established in adults would, therefore, support 
extrapolation of adult efficacy to paediatric patients 1 year of age and older based on similarities in 
disease pathogenesis, the pharmacology of bezlotoxumab, and response to bezlotoxumab infusion

across these age groups. 
P001 was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, multisite study 
evaluating the PK, safety, tolerability, and efficacy to prevent CDI recurrence after a single infusion of 
bezlotoxumab or placebo in paediatric participants from 1 to <18 years of age, who were receiving 
antibacterial drug treatment for CDI. 
Primary and key secondary endpoints include complete PK, immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety 
results, which were provided. 
GCP 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Bioanalytics 
The IV formulation proposed for use in paediatric patients 1 to <18 years of age and used in P001 is 
identical to that commercially available for use in adults. The bioanalytical method used to assess 
bezlotoxumab concentrations in P001 was the same as that submitted in the original marketing 
application. Anti-bezlotoxumab antibodies and NAb were assessed in P001 using validated

bioanalytical methods. 
Study P001 
Data relevant for this II-procedure informing PK resulted from one Phase 3, randomized, placebo- 
controlled, parallel group, multisite, double-blind study (P001) evaluating the PK, safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy in preventing CDI recurrence after a single infusion of bezlotoxumab or placebo in 
paediatric patients from 1 to <18 years of age who were receiving antibacterial drug treatment for 
CDI. 
The primary PK objective was to characterize the PK of bezlotoxumab in 2 age cohorts of paediatric 
participants to support dosing recommendations in the paediatric population. 
Eligible participants were assigned randomly in a 3:1 ratio to bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg (N=107) or 
placebo (N=36), respectively, and were stratified by 2 age cohorts according to the participant’s age 
at the time of randomization (Age Cohort 1: 12 to <18 years of age, Age Cohort 2: 1 to <12 years of 
age). 
The recommended adult dose of 10 mg/kg was evaluated in a two-step procedure. Initially, the dose 
was evaluated for both age cohorts in Panel A of P001. Secondly, an interim PK analysis was 
performed to confirm the dose for Panel B. Consequently, all paediatric participants in P001 received 
a single infusion of bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg. 
A summary of participants included in the per protocol population by panel and age cohort for the 
prespecified interim PK analyses (Panel A) and final analysis (Panels A and B) and the number of 
participants in subsets of Age Cohort 2 are provided in the Table 2 below. 
Table 2: Summary of P001 Study Participants Included in Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The CHMP noted that the paediatric study P001 included overall N=108 participants who received 
bezlotoxumab, of whom N=91 were available for PK analysis (4 PK samples per subject). Most of the 
participants in age cohort 2 (N=63) were aged below 7 years of age (N=40) at a comparable sample 
size to age cohort 1 (N=45).  This imbalance is agreed by the CHMP as most uncertainty in PK is in 
the youngest age cohort. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 14/80 
 
 
 
 
 
Rationale for dose selection and recommendation for the paediatric population 
The dose of 10 mg/kg bezlotoxumab applied IV approved for adults was supported by evidence of 
efficacy and a favourable safety profile demonstrated in 2 Phase 3 studies in adults and was 
assessed in the context of the original marketing application. 
Since bezlotoxumab is acting on an exogeneous target only, it was expected that the exposure range 
identified as safe and efficacious in adults will result in a similar clinical response in paediatric age 
groups. The dosing rationale further relied on the assumption that the pathogenesis of CDI, namely 
overgrowth of toxin-producing C. difficile bacteria, is the same in both adult and paediatric patients. 
Exposure bridging was focussing on comparison of AUC0-inf (to be in comparability bounds) as the 
exposure-response relationship between bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf and CDI recurrence in adults was 
characterized by an Emax relationship, in which exposures achieved following the 10 mg/kg dose are 
on the maximal response plateau of the exposure-response curve (see Section 5.3.4 for 
information). 
The comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6) for bezlotoxumab are based on the 10th and 90th  percentiles 
of observed bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf values following administration of a single 10 mg/kg IV infusion 
of bezlotoxumab alone or as actoxumab + bezlotoxumab in the adult Phase 3 studies. This lower 
bound is derived from the ratio of MK-6072 AUC0-inf values at the 10th percentile (31,700 μg.h/mL) 
relative to the median (54,700 μg.h/mL) in a pooled population of CDI patients from the Phase 3 
trials. The upper bound is similarly derived from the ratio of MK-6072 AUC0-inf values at the 90th 
percentile (85,600 μg.h/mL) of the same population relative to the median AUC0-inf. 
10 mg/kg dose was anticipated to be appropriate for children and to result in exposures similar to 
those observed in adults, as being weight adapted and no major additional effects due to age affects 
or differences in mode of action and pathogenesis of CDI were anticipated. 
The rationale for the MAH’s chosen extrapolation concept based on exposure bridging is agreed by 
the CHMP. The pre-specified boundaries of the chosen PK measure (AUC0-inf) were previously 
agreed. 
Exposure bridging was focussing on comparison of AUC0-inf (to be in comparability bounds) as the 
exposure-response relationship between bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf and CDI recurrence in adults was 
characterized by an Emax relationship, in which exposures achieved following the 10 mg/kg dose are 
on the maximal response plateau of the exposure-response curve. 
10 mg/kg dose was anticipated to be appropriate for children and to result in exposures similar to 
those observed in adults, as being weight adapted and no major additional effects due to age affects 
or differences in mode of action and pathogenesis of CDI were anticipated. This was partly agreed by 
the CHMP. Since authorization is planned for paediatric subjects down to one year of age, maturation 
effects might affect the PK of very young patients in addition to weight. This is also indicated in the 
data and PK analyses conducted and reported. Mean and median exposure including Week 12 
observations are below the adult value for all paediatric age/weight groups except for adolescents, 
with lowest observed exposure for the age group 4 to <7 (47.2% of adult median value) and for the 
weight group 30 to < 40 kg (52.5% of adult median value). Of note, the age group 4 to <7 would 
more fit to the weight group 20 to <30 kg. These results and non-linear relationship indicate that 
weight alone (and per kg dosing) is not predictive of exposure following 10 mg/kg of bezlotoxumab, 
but there might other factors impacting PK. This is also reflected in the high CV% characterizing 
adult and paediatric PK metrics. In order to reflect the amount and information content of paediatric 
PK data, that would serve as confirmation of the extrapolation concept (exposure bridging), Section 
5.2 of the SmPC was amended.

Page 15/80 
 
 
Non-compartmental PK Analysis (NCA) 
NCA was based on the per protocol population defined as randomized participants who received a 
dose of bezlotoxumab and who had ≥4 post-dose evaluable PK samples and who complied with the 
protocol sufficiently to ensure their data show the effects of study intervention. 
The mean concentration-time profiles per age cohort are provided in the figures below. Mean 
bezlotoxumab serum concentration time profiles following a single IV infusion of 10 mg/kg indicate 
no apparent differences between age cohorts of paediatric participants, stratified by two age cohorts, 
from the maximum serum concentration following the infusion on Day 1 through the last serum 
sample on Day 84. 
  Figure 1 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 16/80 
 
 
 
Based on the NCA, mean AUC0-inf, Cmax, and t1/2 were generally comparable for each age cohort, 
as presented in the Table 3 below. 
Table 3: Summary Statistics for Serum Bezlotoxumab Pharmacokinetic Parameter Values Following 
Administration of a Single Infusion of 10 mg/kg Bezlotoxumab in Each Age Cohort of Pediatric 
Participants 
Mean CL and Vd across age groups increased with increasing age, consistent with expectations based 
on allometric scaling concepts. These differences are reduced with values overlapping when CL and 
Vd are normalized by bodyweight. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 17/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Figure 2 
The CHMP noted that Bezlotoxumab pharmacokinetics following a single 10 mg/kg IV infusion in both 
adult and paediatric populations exhibit characteristics typical for a monoclonal antibody including 
low clearance and a limited volume of distribution resulting in a predominant elimination phase with 
terminal half-life of approximately three weeks. The concentration time-profiles for both paediatric 
age cohorts are considered comparable by the CHMP, with lower exposure indicated for the younger 
age cohort. 
As expected, mean CL and Vd across age groups increased with increasing age, with a remaining 
trend in higher weight-normalized CL with decreasing age. The CHMP considers that this may be 
attributed to maturation effects, in particular for the youngest age cohort (1-7 years of age). NCA 
indicated thus an increasing exposure with age over the paediatric age range. 
Population PK Analyses 
A population modelling approach was used to evaluate the PK of bezlotoxumab in the paediatric 
patient population, based on a population PK model used previously to support registration of 
bezlotoxumab in adults. The objective was to characterize bezlotoxumab PK across adult and 
paediatric CDI patients and support confirmation of paediatric doses that result in PK exposures 
similar to adults across the range of age and body weight in the intended paediatric population (1 to 
<18 years). 
In the previous analysis, adult data (from N=1622 HV and CDI participants) were described by a 2- 
compartment model with linear elimination. Weight was included on clearance (CL, Q) and volume 
(Vc, Vp) terms following an allometric relationship with an estimated exponent of 0.447 for both. 
Baseline albumin level, sex, and Japanese origin were included as covariates on both CL and Vc. An 
additional effect of race was identified on CL only. 
For the intended analysis, 641 bezlotoxumab serum concentration observations from 107 paediatric 
participants in P001 following 10 mg/kg were available (see figure below), with no observed 
bezlotoxumab concentrations from P001 excluded from the analysis.

In total, 641 bezlotoxumab serum concentration observations from 107 paediatric participants in 
P001 following 10 mg/kg were available for model-based PK analyses, with no observed 
bezlotoxumab concentrations from P001 excluded from the analysis. The CHMP noted that the 
collected PK data from P001 to confirm the paediatric dose equal to the adult dose are overall highly 
overlapping with adult observed data regarding both paediatric age cohorts, while observations from 
the younger age cohort are approaching the lower adult range. 
Besides age- and size-related covariates, the paediatric population is regarded overall comparable to 
the adult subjects in terms of continuous and categorical covariates investigated, however sample 
sizes are partly low. Gender was balanced also among the different paediatric age cohorts.

Parameter re-estimation 
As external validation indicated a tendency towards under-prediction in the youngest paediatric 
group (in particular age group 1 to <7 years), PK parameter were re-estimated (see table below), as 
prespecified in the Modelling and Simulation Analysis Plan.

Goodness-of-fit plots and VPC plots indicate that after re-estimating the model parameters based on 
the combined adult and paediatric data set under-prediction remained. In consequence, model 
refinements were conducted on the updated model. First, fixed allometry with standard coefficients 
of 0.75 for clearance (CL, Q) and 1 for volume (Vc, Vp) parameters was assessed instead of the 
estimated exponents. Applying these standard allometric exponents resulted in a decline in the fit of 
the data (dOFV = 890 points increase from the re-estimated model). 
Additionally, several maturation functions were assessed on CL (see table below). 
Table 7: Summary of Pivotal Runs for Bezlotoxumab Base Model Development  
The CHMP noted that external validation indicated that the previous model (based on adult data only) 
was capable to capture the median trend and variability of the paediatric data but there was clear 
trend towards under-prediction in the youngest paediatric group (i.e., 1 to <7 years). 
This finding required further model refinement in order to potentially result in an adequate 
model-based description of paediatric PK over the entire age range. 
In this regard, as a next step, the MAH re-estimated all pop PK parameters based on the extended 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 27/80 
 
 
 
 
 
PK data set, indicating that the largest difference is that related to the allometric exponent for body 
weight. The estimates of allometric exponents for scaling CLs and Vs based on the overall weight 
distribution were both equally increased from 0.477 to 0.59 with an comparable 95% CI for weight 
effects on CL, Q and V1, V2 (0.54-0.65), being both below the fix allometric exponents (0.75, 1). 
These updated estimates are based on a very wide adult body weight range (32 kg -194 kg), partly 
overlapping with the weight range for paediatric patients (7.8-108 kg). 
No additional significant covariates were identified for inclusion in the updated model. The relevance 
of race effects (in particular Japanese effect) for the description of (paediatric) PK in CDI patients is 
questioned. Median values following bootstrapping with or without the inclusion of the terminated 
runs were very similar to the parameter estimates of the updated model, the 95% CIs overlapped. 
For the model fit based on the combined adult and paediatric dataset, all parameters were overall 
estimated with acceptable precision (relative standard error [%RSE] < 50%) and condition number 
(22.3).  The η-shrinkage for the re-estimated model was < 30% for all parameters, the ε-shrinkage 
was low (4%). Goodness-of-fit plots by age category and overall indicate no strong biases or trends. 
ETA and CWRES distributions indicate some deviation from the horizontal line over all considered 
paediatric age cohort. 
However, still, goodness-of-fit plots and VPC plots indicate that after re-estimating the model 
parameters based on the combined adult and paediatric data set under-prediction of the median 
exposure remained in the youngest age cohort. As this may be attributed to age-related effects 
(maturation). In addition to weight, age-related maturation effects are expected to impact PK below 
a certain age (as detailed in the M&S Q&A on paediatrics, https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-
regulatory/research- development/scientific-guidelines/clinical-pharmacology-
pharmacokinetics/modelling-simulation-  questions-answers). 
Fix allometry and several maturation functions were tested on CL. Those tested by the MAH did not 
lead to a significant improvement of the model fit in the youngest age group according to the MAH. 
This may also be attributed to the fact that the relevant young age group has limited representation 
in the dataset, preventing to reliably estimate a maturation function for CL but also to exclude this 
possibility. While some but not all plausible combination of weight exponents accounting for weight-
related effects and maturation function were tested for model refinement (e.g. fix allometry (0.75, 1) 
in combination with additional maturation was not considered), maturation was ultimately not 
retained by the MAH in the final model used for exposure predictions for all age groups. The updated 
pop PK model assuming equal  weight effects on CL and V (0.59) is indicated to underpredict the 
median exposure (AUC0_inf) especially for the youngest age group below 7 years of age and 
considered as the appropriate final pop PK model by the MAH. No paediatric pop PK model has been 
established, that would include maturation effects, while exclude some adult PK data e.g. at extreme 
body weight levels. 
Thus, model-based conclusions regarding ADME, the CHMP is of the view that PK parameters and 
exposure predictions for all paediatric age and weight groups should be considered with caution, as 
indicated in the assessment. Section 5.2 of the SmPC was amended to reflect PK data and non- 
compartmental PK results, accordingly. 
Comparison of bezlotoxumab exposure between paediatrics and adult populations 
Adult population 
In adult patients with CDI, bezlotoxumab PK following a single 10 mg/kg IV infusion of bezlotoxumab 
exhibited characteristics typical for a monoclonal antibody including low CL and a limited Vd resulting 
in a predominant elimination phase with a long terminal t1/2. No evidence of TMDD was observed.

Table 11: Summaries of Posthoc and NCA Results Stratified by Age Group 
The CHMP notices that PK estimates based on NCA and following model-based methods are overall in 
line but diverge with decreasing age. As the pop PK exhibits a clear under-estimation of median 
exposure in particular for the age cohort 1-7, simulations results are considered inconclusive and are 
not further discussed in detail. The CHMP considers that exposure predictions based on the updated 
pop PK model should be considered with caution due to the lack of maturation effects, inclusion of 
weight effects, and observed divergence to NCA based estimates, in particular for the age group 
younger than 7 years of age. 
While statistical comparisons of bezlotoxumab PK parameters (NCA) following the administration of 
single infusion of 10 mg/kg indicate that the 90% CIs of paediatric/adult GMRs for serum 
bezlotoxumab AUC0- inf are within the prespecified clinical comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6) for 
each of the two paediatric age cohorts (Cohort 1 and 2), the trend is towards the lower comparability 
boundary for the youngest patients. 
Thus, the MAH was requested by the CHMP to provide a more granular exposure comparison (in 
terms of paediatric/adult GMRs for serum bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf) by splitting the age groups for 
comparison, e.g. into the following subcategories 1-3, 4-6, 7-12 years of age. The MAH was further 
requested to discuss these results in line with the efficacy findings taking the justification of the 
extrapolation concept (exposure bridging) for the youngest paediatric age cohorts into account. Even 
a more granular consideration and comparison did not clearly detect consistent and relevant impact 
of age or weight related impact on PK. Overall, PK results from the paediatric population did not 
exceed the adult range, however with the outlined limitations and uncertainty in generalizability. It 
was thus concluded by the CHMP that the information on PK available for the paediatric population, 
also to support the exposure comparison and extrapolation concept, is best reflected by adequate 
update of Section 5.2 of the SmPC. Thus, the CHMP is of the view that AUC and concentration on 
week 12 (non-compartmental analysis) compared between relevant age and weight groups with the 
adult population were to be reflected in Section 5.2. The MAH updated the section accordingly. 
(Please cf. also sections Discussion and Conclusions on clinical efficacy in this regard.) 
Absorption 
Bezlotoxumab is administered intravenously and is 100% bioavailable. Based on NCA, geometric 
mean (%CV) Cmax following 10 mg/kg was reached after 3 hours (geometric mean) for both 
paediatric cohorts to 129 (32.9) µg/mL (age cohort 2, 1 to < 12 years of age) and 155 (28.2) µg/mL 
(age cohort 1, 12 to <18 years of age). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 34/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
For the paediatric population, the volume of distribution (Vd) increased with age. For age cohort 1 to 
< 12 years of age, the geometric mean (%CV) Vd was derived by NCA to 2.93 (54.6) L. For age 
cohort 12 to <18 years of age, the geometric mean (%CV) Vd was derived by NCA to 7.50 (33.3) L. 
Elimination 
For the paediatric population, the mean Clearance (CL) increased with age. For age cohort 1 to < 12 
years of age, the geometric mean (%CV) CL was derived by NCA to 4.66 (59.6) mL/hr. For age 
cohort 12 to <18 years of age, the geometric mean (%CV) CL was derived by NCA to 9.99 (33.7) 
mL/hr. 
Bezlotoxumab is catabolized through protein degradation processes; thus, metabolism does not 
contribute to its clearance, and it is not eliminated by renal or biliary excretion. Consequently, the 
clearance of bezlotoxumab was not expected to be different in paediatric patients compared with 
adults, except based on weight, which is accounted for by weight-based dosing. 
In addition to weight, age-related maturation effects are expected to impact PK below a certain age 
(as detailed in the M&S Q&A on paediatrics, https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-
regulatory/research- development/scientific-guidelines/clinical-pharmacology-
pharmacokinetics/modelling-simulation-  questions-answers). While some but not all plausible 
combination of weight exponents accounting for weight-related effects and maturation function were 
tested for model refinement (e.g. fix allometry (0.75, 1) in combination with additional maturation 
was not considered), maturation was not retained by the MAH in the final model used for exposure 
predictions for all age groups. This updated pop PK model assumes equal weight effects on CL and V 
(0.59) is indicated to underpredict the exposure (AUC0_inf) especial for the youngest age group 
below 7 years of age. Thus, even after a more granular consideration in terms of age and weight 
ranges, the CHMP considers that model-based conclusions regarding ADME and PK parameters 
should be considered with caution. PK results from non-compartmental analysis  should be the basis 
to inform on paediatric PK. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
As bezlotoxumab is administered via a single IV dose infusion, and no dose ranging studies have 
been conducted in the target population (paediatric subjects), no conclusions on dose proportionality 
and accumulation effects can be drawn. 
Special populations 
In the context of the original MAA, the effects of various covariates on the PK of bezlotoxumab in 
adults were assessed by population PK analysis. Results indicated that the clearance of bezlotoxumab 
increased with increasing body weight, which is to some degree accounted for by weight-based 
dosing. Other than weight, the following factors had no clinically meaningful effect on the exposure of 
bezlotoxumab in adults and no dose adjustment is required: age (range 18 to 100 years), sex, race, 
ethnicity, renal impairment, nor hepatic impairment. 
Regarding updated pop PK model and covariate selection, no correlations were observed between η- 
estimates and tested covariates therefore no additional covariates were taken forward in a formal 
analysis. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 35/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is agreed by the CHMP that no additional covariate in comparison to the adult population may be 
expected besides maturation effects, that may have a clinically relevant impact on PK. Nevertheless, 
the predictability and of covariate effects including weight effects from the model is questioned by 
the CHMP (compare assessment of model performance and model refinement, maturation functions).

Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Not relevant. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Bezlotoxumab is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to and neutralizes C. difficile toxin B. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
The characterization of bezlotoxumab primary and secondary pharmacology in paediatrics compared 
to adults is assumed unchanged. Primary pharmacology is not expected to be different between 
paediatric and adult subjects. 
Immunogenicity 
Serum samples for ADA and NAb analysis were collected in P001 to characterize the immune 
response to bezlotoxumab. Bioanalysis of ADA was conducted using the standard 3- tiered assay 
approach. For participants with confirmed ADA positive samples, the ADA titer was determined to 
characterize the magnitude of the immune response and the presence of NAb was assessed to 
determine if the antibodies neutralized or blocked binding of bezlotoxumab to C. difficile toxin B. 
An immunogenicity analysis was conducted for participants who received a dose of bezlotoxumab and 
who had at least 1 ADA result available post-dose of study intervention. 
Following treatment with bezlotoxumab in P001, 2 of the 100 evaluable paediatric participants tested 
positive for anti-bezlotoxumab antibodies; neither had NAb (see Table 11 below).

Page 36/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 12 
The immunogenic potential is indicated to be low (2%) based on the analysis from data resulting von 
P001. Following bezlotoxumab treatment, 2 of the 100 evaluable paediatric participants were tested 
positive for ADA without Nab development. This is in line with the low immunogenicity previously 
assessed for the adult population, based on adult studies MK-3415A P001, MK-3415A P002. From 
1515 evaluable participants, 9 (0.6%) were classified nontreatment-emergent positive, with a titre 
range from 4 to 512. Of these 9 positive nontreatment emergent participants, only one was 
subsequently shown to be positive for Nab. In light of the above, the CHMP considers the 
immunogenicity risk, despite the low sample size, is considered low.

2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
As an exposure-response relationship was established based on bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf in adult 
patients a PK bridging strategy based upon prespecified criteria for AUC0-inf was designed to support 
extrapolation of efficacy. 
Exposure bridging was focussing on comparison of AUC0-inf (to be in comparability bounds) as the 
exposure-response relationship between bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf and CDI recurrence in adults was 
characterized by an Emax relationship, in which exposures achieved following the 10 mg/kg dose are 
on the maximal response plateau of the exposure-response curve. 
The comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6) for bezlotoxumab are based on the 10th  and 90th  percentile of 
observed AUC0-inf values following administration of a single 10 mg/kg IV infusion in the Phase 3 
trials. This lower bound is derived from the ratio of bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf values at the 10th 
percentile (31,700 μg.h/mL) relative to the median (54,700 μg.h/mL) in a pooled population of CDI 
patients from the Phase 3 trials. The upper bound is similarly derived from the ratio of bezlotoxumab 
AUC0-inf values at the 90th percentile (85,600 μg.h/mL) of the same population relative to the 
median AUC0-inf. These bounds correspond to mean bezlotoxumab exposures anticipated at doses of 
6 mg/kg and 16 mg/kg based on dose proportionality observed over the 0.3 – 20 mg/kg dose range. 
Results on exposure response with respect to efficacy from the original MAA in adults are provided in 
the following. 
Explorative analysis of exposure effects on CDI recurrence rate (original MAA) 
Exposure-response relationships for CDI recurrence in adult patients were explored with quantile 
plots of binned bezlotoxumab exposure values following administration of bezlotoxumab alone or on 
combination. The number of bins was set to 4, with the number of observations equally divided over 
the bins.

treatment 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 38/80 
 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, to explore potential covariate effects, similar plots were generated stratified by 
treatment and by covariates that were to be evaluated for impact on the E-R relationship. CDI 
recurrence rates by MK-6072 exposure bins are also presented in the Table 13 below. 
Table 13: CDI Recurrence Rates  
Exposure-response model (original MAA) 
Table 14: Parameter estimates for the final E-R model for CDI recurrence 
The predicted rate of CDI recurrence in patients receiving placebo is 26.2% and upon treatment with 
bezlotoxumab, the rate of recurrence decreases to 15.9%. Albumin, age, history of CDI in the past 6 
months, and the Charlson Comorbidity Index impact the rate of CDI recurrence in patients on 
placebo. 
The CHMP noted that exposure bridging was focussing on comparison of AUC0-inf (to be in 
comparability bounds) as the exposure-response relationship between bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf and 
CDI recurrence in adults was characterized by an Emax relationship, in which exposures achieved

following the 10 mg/kg dose are on the maximal response plateau of the exposure-response curve. 
While there is an overall trend in decrease in CDI recurrence upon treatment with bezlotoxumab and 
actoxumab, a counterintuitive upward trend in CDI recurrence rate with increasing bezlotoxumab 
exposure was detected (exploratory analysis). As exposure is correlated to other factors, in particular 
albumin, it was argued that these factors may be driving this apparent effect. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
Data relevant for this II-procedure informing PK resulted from one Phase 3, randomized, placebo- 
controlled, parallel group, multisite, double-blind study (P001) evaluating the PK, safety, tolerability, 
and efficacy in preventing CDI recurrence after a single infusion of bezlotoxumab or placebo in 
paediatric patients from 1 to <18 years of age who were receiving antibacterial drug treatment for 
CDI. 
No further relevant data on pharmacodynamics or PK/PD have been provided with this application. 
The primary PK objective was to characterize the PK of bezlotoxumab in two age cohorts of paediatric 
participants to support dosing recommendations in the paediatric population. 
Paediatric study P001 included overall N=108 participants who received bezlotoxumab, of whom 
N=91 were available for PK analysis (4 PK samples per subject). Most of the participants in age cohort 
2 (N=63) were aged below 7 years of age (N=40) at a comparable sample size to age cohort 1 
(N=45).  This imbalance is agreed as most uncertainty in PK is in the youngest age cohort. 
Bezlotoxumab pharmacokinetics following a single 10 mg/kg IV infusion in both adult and paediatric 
populations exhibit characteristics typical for a monoclonal antibody including low clearance and a 
limited volume of distribution resulting in a predominant elimination phase with terminal half-life of 
approximately three weeks. The concentration time-profiles for both paediatric age cohorts are 
considered comparable, with lower exposure indicated for the younger age cohort. 
As expected, mean CL and Vd across age groups increased with increasing age, with a remaining 
trend in higher weight-normalized CL with decreasing age. This may be attributed to maturation 
effects, in particular for the youngest age cohort (1-7 years of age). NCA indicated thus an increasing 
exposure with age over the paediatric age range. 
In total, 641 bezlotoxumab serum concentration observations from 107 paediatric participants in 
P001 following 10 mg/kg were available for (model-based) PK analyses, with no observed 
bezlotoxumab concentrations from P001 excluded from the analysis. The collected PK data from P001 
to confirm the paediatric dose equal to the adult dose are overall highly overlapping with adult 
observed data regarding both paediatric age cohorts, while observations from the younger age cohort 
are approaching the lower adult range. 
Besides age- and size-related covariates, the paediatric population is regarded overall comparable to 
the adult subjects in terms of continuous and categorical covariates investigated, however sample 
sizes are partly low. Gender was balanced also among the different paediatric age cohorts. 
External validation indicated that the previous pop PK model (based on adult data only) was capable 
to capture the median trend and variability of the paediatric data but there was clear trend towards 
under- prediction in the youngest paediatric group (i.e., 1 to <7 years). 
This finding required further model refinement in order to potentially result in an adequate model-
based description of paediatric PK over the entire age range. In this regard, as a next step, the MAH 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 40/80 
 
 
 
 
 
re- estimated all pop PK parameters based on the extended PK data set, indicating that the largest 
difference is that related to the allometric exponent for body weight. The estimates of allometric 
exponents for scaling CLs and Vs based on the overall weight distribution were both equally increased 
from 0.477 to 0.59 with a comparable 95% CI for weight effects on CL, Q and V1, V2 (0.54-0.65), 
being both below the fix allometric exponents (0.75, 1). These updated estimates are based on a very 
wide adult body weight range (32 kg -194 kg), partly overlapping with the weight range for paediatric 
patients (7.8-108 kg). 
No additional significant covariates were identified for inclusion in the updated model. It is agreed 
that no additional covariate in comparison to the adult population may be expected besides 
maturation effects, that may have a clinically relevant impact on PK. Nevertheless, the predictability 
and of covariate effects including weight effects from the model is questioned. 
Still, goodness-of-fit plots and VPC plots indicate that after re-estimating the model parameters 
based on the combined adult and paediatric data set under-prediction of the median exposure 
remained in the youngest age cohort. This may be attributed to age-related effects (maturation). In 
addition to weight, age-related maturation effects are expected to impact PK below a certain age (as 
detailed in the M&S Q&A on paediatrics, https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/human-regulatory/research-
development/scientific- guidelines/clinical-pharmacology-pharmacokinetics/modelling-simulation-
questions-answers). 
Fix allometry and several maturation functions were tested on CL. Those tested by the MAH did not 
lead to a significant improvement of the model fit in the youngest age group according to the MAH. 
This may also be attributed to the fact that the relevant young age group has limited representation 
in the dataset, preventing to reliably estimate a maturation function for CL but also to exclude this 
possibility. 
While some but not all plausible combination of weight exponents accounting for weight-related 
effects and maturation function were tested for model refinement (e.g. fix allometry (0.75, 1) in 
combination with additional maturation was not considered), maturation was ultimately not retained 
by the MAH in the final model used for exposure predictions for all age groups. The updated pop PK 
model assuming equal weight effects on CL and V (0.59) is indicated to underpredict the median 
exposure (AUC0_inf) especially for the youngest age group below 7 years of age and considered as 
the appropriate final pop PK model by the MAH. No paediatric pop PK model has been established, 
that would include maturation effects, while exclude some adult PK data e.g. at extreme body weight 
levels. 
Thus, model-based conclusions (updated pop PK model) regarding paediatric ADME, PK parameters 
and exposure predictions should be considered with caution. In addition, a more granular 
consideration of the age range from 1 to <12 years of age is deemed necessary. 
Dose recommendation 
10 mg/kg dose was anticipated to be appropriate for children and to result in exposures similar to 
those observed in adults, as being weight adapted and no major additional effects due to age affects 
or differences in mode of action and pathogenesis of CDI were anticipated. This is partly agreed. 
Since authorization is planned for paediatric subjects down to one year of age, maturation effects 
might affect the PK of very young patients in addition to weight. This is also indicated in the data and 
PK analyses conducted and reported. Thus, while age range from 12 to 18 years of age for the older 
paediatric age cohort is regarded appropriate, the range for the younger cohort from 1 to 12 years of 
age is considered too wide to serve for meaningful comparison of exposure resulting from older age 
groups. Exposure comparability over all age groups following one 10 mg/kg IV is the core of the 
extrapolation concept towards the paediatric indication. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 41/80 
 
 
PK estimates based on noncompartmental analysis (NCA) and following model-based methods are 
overall in line but diverge with decreasing age. The updated population PK model exhibits a clear 
under- estimation of median exposure in particular for the age cohort 1-7. Exposure predictions 
based on the updated pop PK model should be considered with caution for dose justification due to 
the lack of maturation effects, questioned inclusion of weight effects, and observed divergence to 
NCA based estimates, in particular for the age group younger than 7 years of age. 
While statistical comparisons of bezlotoxumab PK parameters (NCA) following the administration of 
single infusion of 10 mg/kg indicate that the 90% CIs of paediatric/adult GMRs for serum 
bezlotoxumab AUC0- inf are within the prespecified and previously agreed clinical comparability 
bounds of (0.6, 1.6) for each of the two paediatric age cohorts (Cohort 1 and 2), the trend is towards 
the lower comparability boundary for the youngest patients. 
Thus, the MAH was asked to provide a more granular exposure comparison (in terms of 
paediatric/adult GMRs for serum bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf) by splitting the age groups for comparison, 
e.g. into the following subcategories 1-3, 4-6, 7-12 years of age. The MAH was further asked to 
discuss these results  in line with the efficacy findings taking the justification of the extrapolation 
concept (exposure bridging) for the youngest paediatric age cohorts into account. Even after a more 
granular consideration in terms of age and weight ranges, the CHMP considers that model-based 
conclusions regarding ADME and PK parameters should be considered with caution. The provided 
final population PK model is not deemed adequate to serve for simulation of exposure in children, 
and thus in particular to support dose finding and approval in children <12 years, who are indicated 
to require a higher mg/kg-dose to reach similar exposures to adults. PK results from non-
compartmental analysis should be the basis to inform on paediatric PK and to support the 
extrapolation concept (exposure bridging). 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The data on clinical pharmacology derived from paediatric Study P001 aimed at confirmation of 
appropriateness of the selected dose (10 mg/kg) administered as a single IV dose, and description of 
the PK of bezlotoxumab in the paediatric population from 1 to 18 years of age. 
Collected PK and conducted PK analyses indicate low immunogenicity risk of bezlotoxumab in 
paediatrics patients. Observed concentration time-profiles are overall comparable between both 
paediatric age cohorts and in line with what is expected from a monoclonal antibody and previously 
observed in the adult population. 
Dose confirmation needed a critical consideration and discussion regarding the lowest age range as 
expected exposure is at the lower limit of previously agreed exposure boundaries resulting from the 
original MAA in adults.  Overall, PK results from the paediatric population did not exceed the adult 
range, however with the outlined limitations and uncertainty in generalizability. It was thus 
concluded by the CHMP that the information on PK available for the paediatric population, also to 
support the exposure comparison and extrapolation concept, is best reflected by adequate update of 
Section 5.2 of the SmPC. Thus, upon the request of the CHMP, AUC and concentration on week 12 
(non-compartmental analysis) compared between relevant age and weight groups with the adult 
population are now reflected in Section 5.2 of the SmPC. (Please cf. also sections Discussion and 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy in this regard.)

2.4.1.  Dose response study 
No dose response study was performed. 
2.4.2.  Main study 
Study P001: A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Clinical Trial to Evaluate the Safety, 
Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics, and Efficacy of a Single Infusion of Bezlotoxumab (MK-6072, Human 
Monoclonal Antibody to C. difficile Toxin B) in Children Aged 1 to <18 Years Receiving Antibacterial 
Drug Treatment for C. difficile Infection (MODIFY III). 
Methods 
Study participants 
Male and female participants aged 1 to <18 years with C. difficile infection (CDI) (confirmed presence 
of 
C. difficile toxin in stool) and receiving antibacterial drug treatment were eligible to participate. 
The most salient inclusion criteria were: 
At the time of randomization/study infusion, participant: 
•  Had a diagnosis of CDI confirmed by a diagnostic assay, which detected the presence of C. 
difficile toxin in stool, and 
•  Was still receiving antibacterial drug treatment for CDI (a 10- to 21-day course of 
antibacterial drug treatment for CDI, which is defined as oral vancomycin, oral 
metronidazole, or oral fidaxomicin). Additionally, IV metronidazole may be given concurrently 
with oral vancomycin or oral fidaxomicin 
Participant for whom, at the time of randomization, the planned course of antibacterial drug 
treatment for CDI was longer than 21 days were excluded from the study.

Sample size 
Originally, the study aimed to randomise 144 paediatric participants in the bezlotoxumab group and 
48 in the placebo group, for a total of 192 participants. Although the primary endpoint of the study 
was for PK, the sample size was chosen also considering safety and efficacy: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 46/80 
 
 
• 
PK: 9 paediatric participants per age and treatment group were considered sufficient for the 
PK endpoints (supported by formal calculations and using available data from 1400 adults as 
reference). 
•  Safety: under the assumption of an incidence of SAE of 1%, there is a 76% chance of 
observing at least one serious adverse event among 144 subjects in the bezlotoxumab 
group. This probability was updated to > 99% after eDMC3 (and also taking into 
consideration the enrolment challenges encountered during the CODIV-19 pandemic) 
•  Efficacy: “The planned sample size for this study will have limited power to confirm 
superiority of bezlotoxumab over placebo”. No formal power or sample size calculation was 
provided, but possible scenarios that could be observed in the data: 
Table 15: Variability around various possible treatment differences  
During the trial, the sample size was reduced to a minimum of 140 participants based on a review of 
blinded safety data. The review showed that the observed serious adverse event (SAE) rate was 
within the range expected given the comorbidities of the study population. 202 subjects were screen 
for inclusion in the trial, 148 were randomized, 143 received study intervention, and 138 completed 
the study. 
Consideration of the sample size regarding safety are acceptable to the CHMP. 
Consideration of the sample size regarding efficacy are acknowledged by the CHMP but not 
considered optimal by the Committee. The presented calculations assume that 100% of the study 
participants (in either group) reaches initial clinical response (a prerequisite in order to be included in 
the mITT for efficacy analysis), which was not to be expected in the trial. 132 subjects were 
eventually analysed for efficacy in the final analysis (98 from bezlotoxumab group and 34 from 
placebo group). However, since efficacy was not the primary objective of the study, and efficacy data 
are only to be considered supportive for the scope of this assessment, the sample size is thereof 
acceptable to the Committee. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 47/80 
 
 
 
 
 
Randomisation 
Treatment allocation/randomization was planned to occur centrally using an interactive voice 
response system / integrated web response system (IVRS/IWRS). The randomisation ratio was 3:1 
to bezlotoxumab or placebo, respectively. Randomisation was stratified by age cohort (age cohort 1: 
12 to <18 years of age; age cohort 2: 1 to <12 years of age). This was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was planned as double blind. Bezlotoxumab and placebo were planned to be prepared 
and/or dispensed in a blinded fashion by an unblinded pharmacist or qualified trial site personnel. 
Standard procedures in case of unblinding due to welfare of the participant were described in the 
protocol. 
This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations/Sets 
Per-Protocol (PP) population: used for PK analyses. Treated participants who complete PK sampling 
with at least 4 post-dose evaluable samples and comply with the protocol sufficiently to ensure that 
these data will be likely to exhibit the effects of treatment. 
All Participants as Treated (APaT): used for safety analyses. All randomized participants who receive 
infusion of study medication, corresponding to the study treatment they actually received. 
Participants in Panel A to be analysed separately in case of dose modification. 
Modified intention to treat (mITT): used for efficacy analyses. All randomized participants with 
participants excluded for the following reasons:(a) Did not receive any amount of study medication; 
(b) Did not have a positive local stool test for C. difficile toxin to confirm CDI diagnosis of the 
baseline episode (c) Was not taking a protocol-defined antibacterial drug treatment for CDI on the 
day of the infusion. Participants in Panel A to be analysed separately in case of dose modification. 
Efficacy evaluable (EE) population: used for efficacy analysis. Subset of mITT excluding participants 
because of (a) important deviations from the protocol that may affect the efficacy results (b) prior or 
concomitant usage of IV immune globulin (IVIG) (c)Participants who become unblinded for any 
reason. 
Primary Endpoint(s) / Primary Estimand(s) 
No primary endpoints for efficacy. 
Secondary Endpoints / Secondary Estimand(s) 
Three secondary objectives for efficacy: 
1.  Proportion of participants with CDI recurrence: Proportion of participants who have a CDI 
recurrence within 12 weeks of study medication infusion. CDI recurrence is assessed by the 
investigator. 
2.  Proportion of participants with sustained clinical response: Proportion of participants with 
sustained clinical response over a period of 12 weeks. Sustained clinical response is defined 
as initial clinical response of the baseline CDI episode (assessed by the investigator) AND no

CDI recurrence through Week 12. 
3.  Estimation of efficacy (CDI recurrence and sustained clinical response) in the subset of 
participants at high risk of CDI recurrence within 12 weeks following administration of a 
single infusion of bezlotoxumab or placebo. 
Data were planned to be analysed using Miettinen and Nurminen’s method for stratified data and 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel weights. The 95% CI for the differences in proportions were planned to be 
presented along with nominal 2-sided p-values (not for inferential purposes). 
As a supportive analysis, time to CDI recurrence was planned to be assessed using Kaplan-Meier 
method and compared between groups using stratified log-rank test. 
While not explicitly stated in the methods section, efficacy results were presented in absolute 
differences. 
Missing data 
Not described in the protocol or SAP. No missing data for efficacy outcomes were reported in the CSR. 
Multiplicity 
No multiplicity control. 
Interim Analyses 
Two planned reviews of safety and tolerability data by the DMC. No interim analyses for efficacy 
planned. 
The CHMP noted that efficacy was only planned as secondary, supportive objective. No formal 
hypotheses were tested. The methodology is considered appropriate by the CHMP.

Conduct of the study 
There was one amendment of the protocol. 
Table 17: Protocol amendments for MK-6072-001 
The planned sample size was 192 participants which was reduced to a minimum of 140 participants 
based on a review of blinded safety data. The review showed that the observed SAE rate was within 
the range expected given the comorbidities of the study population and supported the determination 
that enrolment of additional participants was not needed to characterize the safety and tolerability of 
MK-6072 in paediatric patients.

Baseline data 
Table 18: Participant characteristics, All participants treated 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 51/80 
 
 
 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between study intervention 
groups in both the APaT and mITT populations: 
• 
The median age of participants in the APaT population was 10.0 years in the bezlotoxumab 
group, and 8.0 years in the placebo group. Overall, 52.4% of participants were male and 
80.4% of participants were White (race). 
•  Six participants 1 to <2 years of age were enrolled; 4 received a single IV infusion of 
bezlotoxumab. 
Medical history and concurrent illnesses 
The medical history conditions most frequently reported (>20% of participants in either intervention 
group in the APaT population) were: thrombocytopenia (bezlotoxumab group: 28.0%; placebo 
group: 44.4%), febrile neutropenia (23.4%; 41.7%), anaemia (35.5%; 58.3%), neutropenia 
(29.9%; 38.9%), vomiting (19.6%; 27.8%), central venous catheterization (22.4%; 27.8%), 
abdominal pain (7.5%; 25.0%), nausea (15.9%; 25.0%), mucosal inflammation (12.1%; 22.2%), 
pyrexia (17.8%; 22.2%), and acute lymphocytic leukaemia (11.2%; 22.2%). 
CDI-related medical conditions were generally comparable between intervention groups in the mITT 
population. The most frequently reported CDI-related medical conditions were: neutropenia 
(bezlotoxumab group: 52.9%; placebo group: 60.0%), active hematologic malignancy (38.5%; 
48.6%), and malignant solid tumour (30.8%; 37.1%). 
The CHMP noted that demographic and baseline characteristics as well as medical history conditions 
were in general between the wo treatment groups. 
The MAA reported CDI-related conditions. Among these conditions were active haematologic 
malignancy (38.5%; 48.6%), and malignant solid tumour (30.8%; 37.1%). This was not 
comprehensible; the reported conditions seemed rather concurrent illness than CDI-related 
conditions. Upon CHMP request, the MAH clarified that CDI-related conditions represent conditions 
that result in significant immunosuppression (due to either the condition itself, its treatment, or both) 
and therefore increase the risk of CDI and recurrent CDI. This response is acceptable to the CHMP.

Severity of CDI baseline episode 
Overall, 18.0% of participants in the mITT population met the criteria for severe CDI (19.2% in the 
bezlotoxumab group, 14.3% in the placebo group) [Table 14.1-28]. The most frequently reported 
criteria for severe CDI at baseline episode were bloody diarrhoea (10.1%), fever (7.2%) and 
diarrhoea accompanied by dehydration. 
Severe complicated baseline episode 
Three (2.2%) participants in the mITT population presented with severe complicated cases of CDI at 
the baseline episode. The 3 participants were in the bezlotoxumab group and met the criteria for 
intensive care unit admission. 
CDI antibiotic treatment for baseline episode 
All participants in the mITT population were receiving a protocol-defined SOC CDI antibiotic 
treatment for the baseline CDI episode on the day of intervention. 
Specific CDI antibiotic treatment for baseline episode was comparable between the study interventions 
groups. The most frequently administered concomitant antibiotic treatments for baseline episode were 
vancomycin (40.3% of participants) and metronidazole (53.2%). 
• 
• 
The mean number of total days on SOC antibiotic treatment for the baseline CDI episode was 
14.4 days and was comparable between intervention groups. 
The mean number of days on CDI antibiotic treatment for the baseline episode prior to study 
intervention was 7.6 days and was comparable between intervention groups. 
CDI antibiotic treatment for baseline episode in the mITT population with initial clinical response was 
consistent with the overall mITT population. The most frequently administered concomitant antibiotic 
treatments for baseline episode were vancomycin (40.2% of participants in the mITT population with 
initial clinical response) and metronidazole (51.5%). 
Prognostic risk factors 
Most participants (94.2%) had 1 or more risk factor for CDI recurrence. The most common risk 
factors were being immunocompromised (72.7%) and having received treatment with 1 or more 
systemic antibacterials during treatment for CDI during the baseline episode (62.6%). Approximately 
one-third of participants in each intervention group had 1 or more episodes of CDI at any point prior 
to the baseline episode. 
The percentage of participants with a prior history of CDI diagnosis and other prognostic risk factors 
for CDI recurrence (number of prior CDI episodes, etc.) were comparable between intervention 
groups in both the APaT and mITT populations, respectively. In the mITT population the mean 
number of prior CDI episodes was 2.7 in the bezlotoxumab group and 3.4 in the placebo group.

Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy outcomes were secondary endpoints in P001 and the study was not powered for formal 
hypothesis testing of between-intervention group comparisons. The efficacy analyses for this study 
were conducted using the mITT population. The main analysis for CDI recurrence was based on a 
subset of the mITT population consisting of participants who achieved an initial clinical response.

Summary of main study 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical efficacy as 
well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

A Phase 3, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multisite, double-blind 
study evaluating the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, tolerability, and efficacy of a 
single infusion of bezlotoxumab in pediatric participants 1 to <18 years of age with 
a suspected or confirmed diagnosis of Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) who 
were receiving a 10- to 21-day course of antibacterial treatment for CDI. 
Participants were randomized 3:1 to bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg or placebo and were 
stratified by age at randomization (Age Cohort 1: 12 to <18 years of age, Age 
Cohort 2: 1 to <12 years of age). After receiving a single dose of study 
intervention, participants were followed up for 12 weeks (ie, 85 ± 5 days) for PK 
and immunogenicity collections, monitoring of safety and tolerability parameters, 
and efficacy outcomes.

Hypothesis 
Pharmacokinetic (Primary): 
The area under the concentration-time curve from 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf) of 
bezlotoxumab after treatment of 2 age cohorts of pediatric participants (Age Cohort 
1: 12 to <18 years; Age Cohort 2: 1 to <12 years) with a single infusion of 
bezlotoxumab is similar when compared with the AUC0-inf of bezlotoxumab after 
treatment of adult participants with a single infusion of 10 mg/kg bezlotoxumab, a 
dose demonstrated to be safe and efficacious in adults. That is, the true geometric 
mean ratios (GMRs, pediatric participants/adults) for AUC0-inf of bezlotoxumab 
are contained in the clinical comparability bounds of (0.6, 1.6) in each of the age 
cohorts. 
Efficacy (Secondary):

Objectives 
Primary objective: To characterize bezlotoxumab PK in 2 age cohorts (Age Cohort 
1: 12 to <18 years; Age Cohort 2: 1 to <12 years) of pediatric participants to 
support dose selection in this population. 
Secondary Objectives: 
Efficacy outcomes were secondary endpoints. The study was not powered for 
formal hypothesis testing for efficacy. 
To estimate the proportion of participants who have a CDI recurrence within 12 
weeks following administration of a single infusion of bezlotoxumab or placebo. 
To estimate the proportion of participants with sustained clinical response over a 
period of 12 weeks in participants who received a single infusion of bezlotoxumab 
or placebo. 
To estimate efficacy (CDI recurrence and sustained clinical response) in the subset 
of participants at high risk of CDI recurrence within 12 weeks following 
administration of a single infusion of bezlotoxumab or placebo.

Results and Analysis 
14-JUL-2022 
The AUC0-inf of bezlotoxumab following a single IV infusion of 10 mg/kg in paediatric patients (1 to <18 years of age) is 
similar to the historical PK data for AUC0-inf in adult patients with CDI. The PK data support the selection of the adult dose of 
10 mg/kg dose for paediatric patients 1 year of age and older and the extrapolation of efficacy and safety established in adults for 
the prevention of CDI recurrence to the paediatric population. 
In paediatric participants (1 to <18 years of age) with CDI who received a single IV dose of bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo, 
the percentage of participants with CDI recurrence was low and comparable between the bezlotoxumab and placebo groups. 
Results for the 3 main efficacy objectives (CDI recurrence, sustained clinical response, and efficacy in participants at high risk of 
recurrence) were comparable between intervention groups. Despite most participants having protocol-defined risk factors for 
recurrence, the percentage of participants with CDI recurrence was low in the modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population, with 
17 participants experiencing a recurrence. 
In sensitivity analyses, the percentage of participants who had a CDI recurrence in the mITT population with initial clinical 
response and were at high risk for CDI recurrence or who received systemic antibacterials during the 12-week follow-up was 
comparable between intervention groups and generally consistent with results reported for participants at high risk for CDI 
recurrence. 
In sensitivity analyses, the percentage of participants in the mITT population who had sustained clinical response and were at high 
risk for CDI recurrence or who received systemic antibacterials during the 12-week follow-up period was comparable between 
intervention groups and generally consistent with results reported for participants at high risk for CDI recurrence. 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study P001 was randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the safety, 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of a single Infusion of bezlotoxumab human monoclonal 
antibody to C. difficile Toxin B) in children aged 1 to <18 years receiving antibacterial drug treatment 
for C. difficile infection. 
Male and female participants aged 1 to <18 years with C. difficile infection (CDI) (confirmed presence 
of C. difficile toxin in stool) and receiving a 10- to 21-day course of antibacterial drug treatment for

CDI were eligible to participate. 
Patients were treated with a single dose of 10mg/kg single dose of bezlotoxumab or placebo on top 
of adequate CDI treatment. The dose is the same dose as for treatment of adults. 
Efficacy outcomes were secondary endpoints and the study was not powered for formal hypothesis 
testing of between treatment group comparisons. Efficacy endpoints were analysed from the day 
study intervention was administered through the 12-week follow-up period and point estimates are 
provided for the efficacy of bezlotoxumab versus placebo. The duration of follow up is adequate. 
The efficacy endpoints were: 
•  CDI recurrence within 12 weeks of study medication infusion. 
•  Sustained clinical response over 12 weeks; defined as initial clinical response of the baseline 
CDI episode AND no CDI recurrence through Week 12. 
•  CDI recurrence and proportion of participants who achieve sustained clinical response within 
12 weeks of study infusion in the subset of participants at high risk of CDI recurrence. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The efficacy analyses for this study were conducted using the mITT population and subsets of the 
mITT population. The main analysis for CDI recurrence was conducted using a subset of the mITT 
population, which included participants who achieved an initial clinical response of baseline CDI. The 
analysis population is acceptable by the CHMP. Of not bezlotoxuab is not expected to have an effect 
on the current episode, it its aimed to reverent further episodes within 3 months of treatment. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were generally comparable between study intervention 
groups in both the APaT and mITT populations. The MAA reported CDI-related conditions. Among 
these conditions were active haematologic malignancy (38.5%; 48.6%), and malignant solid tumour 
(30.8%; 37.1%). This was not comprehensible; the reported conditions seemed rather concurrent 
illness than CDI-related conditions. Upon CHMP request, the MAH clarified that CDI-related 
conditions represent conditions that result in significant immunosuppression (due to either the 
condition itself, its treatment, or both) and therefore increase the risk of CDI and recurrent CDI. This 
response is acceptable to the CHMP. 
CDI antibiotic treatment for baseline episode in the mITT population with initial clinical response was 
consistent with the overall mITT population. The most frequently administered concomitant antibiotic 
treatments for baseline episode were vancomycin (40.2% of participants in the mITT population with 
initial clinical response) and metronidazole (51.5%). 
Most participants (94.2%) had 1 or more risk factor for CDI recurrence. The most common risk 
factors were being immunocompromised (72.7%) and having received treatment with 1 or more 
systemic antibacterials during treatment for CDI during the baseline episode (62.6%). Approximately 
one-third of participants in each intervention group had 1 or more episodes of CDI at any point prior 
to the baseline episode. 
The percentage of participants in the mITT population with initial clinical response who had CDI 
recurrence was low and comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab: 11,2%; placebo: 
14,7%). 
The percentage of participants in the mITT population with sustained clinical response was 
comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab: 83.7%; placebo: 82.9%). There were no 
clinically meaningful differences observed between intervention groups in sustained clinical response 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 61/80 
 
 
 
 
 
across the subgroups analysed (i.e., age cohort, sex, race, primary treatment for baseline CDI 
episode, or adjunctive treatment for baseline CDI episode) compared with the overall population. 
The percentage of participants in the mITT population with initial clinical response who had CDI 
recurrence and were at high risk for CDI recurrence was comparable between intervention groups 
(bezlotoxumab: 12.1%; placebo: 15.2%). 
The percentage of participants in the mITT population with sustained clinical response and at high 
risk for CDI recurrence was comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab: 82.5%, 
placebo: 82.4%). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In paediatric participants (1 to <18 years of age) with CDI who received a single IV dose of 
bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo, the CHMP noted that the percentage of participants with CDI 
recurrence was low and comparable between the bezlotoxumab and placebo groups. Although the 
pharmacokinetic evaluation showed comparable exposure between the adult and paediatric 
population, these results are not reflected in the efficacy data. The treatment group showed 
comparable results with the placebo group. These cannot be explained in a different pathophysiology 
in paediatric and adult population. The MAH stated  that a lower background incidence of CDI was 
observed during the study period than in the period prior to MODIFY III. Since study enrolment partly 
occurred during the COVID-19 era the strict hygiene and cleaning practices were in place in hospitals 
and communities; this may have contributed to decreased recurrence rates. The simulation exercise 
presented by the MAH supports the MAH’s statement that the efficacy results of the MODIFY III 
trials, while not compelling, are not unexpected for the given scenario. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
A primary objective of the study was the evaluation of safety and tolerability of bezlotoxumab 
compared with placebo following a single dose of infusion through 12 weeks. 
Safety and tolerability in P001 were evaluated by collection of AE data, clinical laboratory 
evaluations, and vital sign measurements. Safety analyses were performed on the APaT population. 
These analyses were performed using the M&N asymptotic method (1985) and 95% CIs were 
provided. 
All participants who received study intervention completed a single infusion of either 10 mg/kg 
bezlotoxumab or placebo, therefore the extent of exposure was the same for all participants. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 107 paediatric participants received bezlotoxumab and 36 received placebo.

Table 24
The disposition of participants was generally comparable between study intervention groups (APaT 
population). 
Adverse events 
A higher observed incidence of AEs considered related to study intervention by the investigator was 
reported for the participants in the bezlotoxumab group (15.9%) compared with the placebo group 
(8.3%), with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that included zero. 
There was a lower incidence of SAEs in the bezlotoxumab group (53.3%) compared with the placebo 
group (80.6%), with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that excluded zero. Most SAEs were 
considered not related to study intervention by the investigator. 
Six deaths occurred due to AEs that began during the 12-week follow-up period (5 in the 
bezlotoxumab group, 1 in the placebo group). None the deaths were considered related to study 
intervention by the investigator. 
No participant discontinued study intervention due to an AE.

The most frequently reported AEs (reported for ≥20% participants in either intervention group) were: 
febrile neutropenia (bezlotoxumab: 21.5%, placebo: 30.6%), pyrexia (17.8%, 30.6%), headache 
(14.0%, 22.2%), and vomiting (13.1%, 22.2%).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There was a lower incidence of SAEs in the bezlotoxumab group (53.3%) compared with the placebo 
group (80.6%) with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that excluded zero. Most SAEs were 
considered not related to study intervention by the investigator. 
The most frequently reported SAEs (reported for ≥5% participants in either intervention group) were 
febrile neutropenia (bezlotoxumab: 20.6%; placebo: 30.6%), pyrexia (3.7%; 8.3%), C. difficile 
colitis (0.9%; 5.6%), and urinary tract infection (2.9%; 5.6%). 
SAEs  considered  related  to  study  intervention  by  the  investigator  were  reported  for  2  participants 
(intussusception  and  nausea,  1  participant  each),  both  in  the  bezlotoxumab  group)  and  both  AEs 
resolved.

Table 31 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 70/80 
 
The percentage of participants with intervention-related SAEs was low (2 [1.9%] participants, both in 
the bezlotoxumab group). 
The intervention-related SAEs in the bezlotoxumab group were intussusception and nausea (each 
for 1 participant) and both AEs resolved. 
After the 12-week follow-up period, an additional participant (in the bezlotoxumab group) was 
reported by the investigator to be an intervention-related SAE of large intestinal obstruction (onset 
Day 294), which was severe in intensity and resolved after 5 days. 
Six participant deaths occurred due to AEs that began during the 12-week follow-up period (5 in the 
bezlotoxumab group, 1 in the placebo group). None were considered related to study intervention. 
One additional participant (in the bezlotoxumab group) died of an SAE that began after the12-week 
follow-up period. The participant had an SAE of septic shock (onset Day 94) whichwas not 
considered related to study intervention. 
Table 32 
Adverse events of special interest 
No protocol-specified AEs of special interest were identified for this study. 
Cardiac AEs 
Cardiac AEs were reported for 4 participants (1 in bezlotoxumab group, 3 in placebo group). None 
were considered related to study intervention by the investigator or serious.

Predefined laboratory criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury 
No participants had laboratory values that met the predefined ECI criteria for hepatic test 
abnormalities requiring additional evaluation of an underlying aetiology. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Two participants experienced a protocol-defined infusion-related reaction. Of these, 1 occurred in the 
bezlotoxumab group (blood pressure systolic decreased) and 1 in the placebo group (blood pressure 
decreased); both events were of mild intensity and resolved. 
Laboratory findings 
The percentage of participants who had chemistry and hematologic laboratory findings that met 
predetermined criteria was generally comparable between intervention groups. 
Vital signs, and other observations related to safety 
There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital sign measurements for either intervention group. 
Safety in special populations 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed between intervention groups in the percentages of 
participants with AEs, intervention-related AEs, or all SAEs by age groups in. 
No intrinsic factors other than age were evaluated for this study. No extrinsic factors were evaluated 
for this study. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Bezlotoxumab-mediated drug-drug interactions are unlikely, as the target of bezlotoxumab is an 
exogenous toxin and hence is not likely to directly modulate inflammatory cytokines that affect P450 
expression. Because bezlotoxumab is eliminated by catabolism, no metabolic drug-drug interactions 
are expected. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No participant discontinued study intervention due to an AE. 
Post marketing experience 
Bezlotoxumab was first approved in the United States on 21-OCT-2016 and has been approved in 
adults in 36 countries as of 31-MAY-2022. 
A total of 399 reports (242 reports, 60.6% considered serious) containing 985 events (494 events, 
50.1% serious) were reported as of 31-MAY-2022 Of the 399 reports, 193 (48.3%) were 
spontaneous and 206 (51.6%) were non-interventional study reports. 
Of the 376 (94.2%) reports that included gender information, 169 (44.9%) were for males and 207 
(55%) were for females. The median age was 73 years (range 15 to 98 years).

Table 33 
For the 985 AEs reported, the SOCs with the most commonly reported AEs were General disorders 
and administration site conditions (259 events), Infections and infestations (170 events), and Injury, 
poisoning and procedural complications (142 events). 
The 5 most commonly reported preferred terms in the General disorders and administration site 
conditions SOC were drug ineffective (54), no adverse event (53), adverse event (38), treatment 
failure (22), and death (22). Of the 259 events in this SOC, 94 were considered serious and 165 non 
serious. The outcomes provided were as follows: fatal (30), not recovered/not resolved (20), 
recovered or recovering (17), recovered with sequelae and 191 had unknown outcome. Review of 
the reports did not identify any new safety concerns. The reports coded as “death” had limited 
information or were confounded by the underlying medical conditions in the context of critically ill

patients. 
The most commonly reported PTs in the Infections and infestations SOC were C. difficile infection 
(77), Pneumonia (7), Pneumonia aspiration (6), Septic shock (6), and C. difficile colitis (6). Of the 
170 events in this SOC, 166 were considered serious and 4 non-serious. The outcomes provided 
were as follows: unknown outcome (69), recovered or recovering (62), fatal (26), and not 
recovered/not resolved (13). The fatal reports had limited information or were confounded by the 
underlying medical conditions in the context of critically ill patients. 
The most commonly reported PTs in the Injury, poisoning and procedural complications SOC were 
overdose (45) under dose (25) and product use in unapproved indication (15). Of the 142 events of 
the SOC, 5 were serious and 137 non-serious. The outcomes provided were as follows: unknown 
outcome (138), recovered (3), and fatal (1). The fatal case was a patient with multiple conditions 
who died due to chronic dysfunction of a renal graft. 
Of the 399 reports identified in the safety database, 1 report (0.09%) described the use of 
bezlotoxumab in a 15-year-old patient (off-label use) with no other co-reported adverse events. The 
case did not provide additional details. A complete medical assessment cannot be performed with the 
limited information provided. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
A primary objective of study P001 was the evaluation of safety and tolerability of bezlotoxumab 
compared with placebo following a single dose of infusion through 12 weeks. 
Safety and tolerability were evaluated by collection of AE data, clinical laboratory evaluations, and 
vital sign measurements. Safety analyses were performed on the APaT population. These analyses 
were performed using the M&N asymptotic method (1985) and 95% CIs were provided. 
All participants who received study intervention completed a single infusion of either 10 mg/kg 
bezlotoxumab or placebo, therefore the extent of exposure was the same for all participants. A toatal 
of 143 patients were evaluated for safety, 107 in the bezlotoxumab group and 36 in the placebo 
group. 
The CHMP noted that a higher observed incidence of AEs considered related to study intervention by 
the investigator was reported for the participants in the bezlotoxumab group (15.9%) compared with 
the placebo group (8.3%), with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that included zero. The most 
frequently reported AEs (reported for ≥20% participants in either intervention group) were: febrile 
neutropenia (bezlotoxumab: 21.5%, placebo: 30.6%), pyrexia (17.8%, 30.6%), headache (14.0%, 
22.2%), and vomiting (13.1%, 22.2%). 
The most frequently reported AEs considered related to study intervention in the bezlotoxumab 
group were ALT increased, AST increased, and headache (each for 3 [2.8% participants). The most 
frequently reported AE related to study intervention in the placebo group was headache (2 [5.6%] 
participants). 
There was a lower incidence of SAEs in the bezlotoxumab group (53.3%) compared with the placebo 
group (80.6%) with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that excluded zero. Most SAEs were 
considered not related to study intervention by the investigator. 
The percentage of participants with intervention-related SAEs was low (2 [1.9%] participants, both in 
the bezlotoxumab group). 
The intervention-related SAEs in the bezlotoxumab group were intussusception and nausea (each for 
1 participant) and both AEs resolved. After the 12-week follow-up period, an additional participant (in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 74/80 
 
 
 
 
the bezlotoxumab group) was reported by the investigator to be an intervention-related SAE of large 
intestinal obstruction (onset Day 294), which was severe in intensity and resolved after 5 days. 
Six participant deaths occurred due to AEs that began during the 12-week follow-up period (5 in the 
bezlotoxumab group, 1 in the placebo group). None were considered related to study intervention. 
One additional participant (in the bezlotoxumab group) died of an SAE that began after the12-week 
follow-up period. The participant had an SAE of septic shock (onset Day 94) which was not 
considered related to study intervention. The relatively large number of deaths in this small study 
sheds some doubts that the selected population i.e. paediatric patients with severe underlying 
disease adequate population for performing a PK study. 
No protocol-specified AEs of special interest were identified for this study. 
Cardiac AEs were reported for 4 participants (1 in bezlotoxumab group, 3 in placebo group). None 
were considered related to study intervention by the investigator or serious. 
No participants had laboratory values that met the predefined ECI criteria for hepatic test 
abnormalities requiring additional evaluation of an underlying aetiology. 
Two participants experienced a protocol-defined infusion-related reaction. Of these, 1 occurred in the 
bezlotoxumab group (blood pressure systolic decreased) and 1 in the placebo group (blood pressure 
decreased), both events were of mild intensity and resolved. 
The percentage of participants who had chemistry and hematologic laboratory findings that met 
predetermined criteria was generally comparable between intervention groups. 
There were no clinically meaningful findings in vital sign measurements for either intervention group. 
No clinically meaningful differences were observed between intervention groups in the percentages of 
participants with AEs, intervention-related AEs, or all SAEs by age groups in. 
No participant discontinued study intervention due to an AE. 
The CHMP also noted that a review of cumulative post-marketing adverse events was conducted from 
market introduction (21-OCT-2016) through 31-MAY-2022 and did not identify any new safety issues. 
The available post-marketing data in adult patients (and a single case of off-label use in a paediatric 
patient), are consistent with the known safety profile of bezlotoxumab. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the overall incidence of AEs in the bezlotoxumab group was generally 
comparable with the placebo group regardless of age cohort, demographics, or other risk factors. The 
incidence of study drug related events is low. 
The observed AEs and SAEs and death are rather related to the significant comorbidities of the 
selected patient population than to the study drug. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal.

2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated version 2.3 of the RMP within this application; version 3.0 was 
endorsed by the Committee. 
The main proposed RMP changes were the following (text copied without references in the RMP): 
• 
PART II: MODULE SI - EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) AND TARGET POPULATION(S) 
Epidemiology of the indications and target population CDI epidemiology among adults was updated 
up to date. 
CDI epidemiology among paediatric populations was added: 
“Incidence of CDI: 
Incidence of CDI among paediatric patients increased in the US from 1991 to 2009, rising from 2.6 to 
32.6 infections per 100,000 person-years. In the US hospital setting specifically, incidence increased 
from 
4.4 per 10,000 patient-days in 2001 to 6.5 per 10,000 patient-days in 2006, with a similar incidence 
rate in 2013 (7.1 cases per 10,000 patient-days) as in 2006. CDI incidence among paediatric 
inpatients in the Netherlands was also stable over approximately the same time period of 2009-
2015. Incidence among paediatric inpatients in the US declined to 4.9 cases per 10,000 patient-days 
by 2019. 
Prevalence of CDI and CDI recurrence: 
In the US, there are approximately 16,900 paediatric CDI cases annually. Approximately 10-30% of 
paediatric patients with a case of CDI are expected to have a recurrent episode. Among all paediatric 
CDI cases, approximately three-quarters are community-acquired, while the remainder are acquired 
in a healthcare setting. Globally, asymptomatic colonization of C. difficile is common among infants, 
occurring in 41% of those aged 6 months to 1 year, compared with 12% in those aged 5-18 years. 
Despite relatively high prevalence of C. difficile colonization, clinically relevant CDI is rare in infants 
aged <1 year. 
Severe outcomes of CDI are uncommon among paediatric cases and include toxic megacolon (0.1%), 
colectomy (0.3%), gastrointestinal perforation (0.4%), and pseudomembranous colitis (1.1%). Global 
estimates of all-cause mortality among paediatric patients with CDI range from 2-5%. 
Risk factors for CDI and CDI recurrence: 
Paediatric patients are at higher risk of CDI if they have prior antibiotic exposure, prolonged 
hospitalization, a history of hospitalization, current use of gastric acid suppressants, or have 
comorbidities, including neoplastic disease, immunodeficiency, solid organ transplantation, and 
enteral feeding. Among paediatric patients with CDI, 67%-91% are estimated to have comorbidities. 
Risk factors for CDI recurrence include malignancy, tracheostomy tube dependence, recent surgery, 
and antibiotic use in the 30 days before symptom onset. As with initial cases of CDI, comorbidities 
are common among paediatric patients with recurrent CDI. Among paediatric patients with recurrent 
CDI in a Swedish hospital, 97% had an underlying comorbidity. 
Demographics of the population in the authorized indication: 
The target population is paediatric patients 1 year of age and older with an acute episode of primary 
or recurrent CDI and who are at high risk for recurrence of CDI. 
Main existing treatment options: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 76/80 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Vancomycin and metronidazole are commonly used for treatment of paediatric CDI. Limited 
observational data suggest that vancomycin may result in higher rates of clinical improvement than 
metronidazole and that recurrence is more likely following metronidazole than vancomycin treatment. 
Fidaxomicin is an oral, narrow-spectrum antibiotic that has activity against both C. difficile and its 
spores, thereby treating both initial episodes of CDI and reducing recurrence [Ref. 5.4: 080Z6N]. In 
a randomized controlled clinical trial among paediatric patients aged <18 years with CDI, fidaxomicin 
was non- inferior to vancomycin for treatment of CDI and also resulted in higher rates of global cure 
(68% vs. 50%) and longer time to recurrence.” 
• 
PART II: MODULE SII - NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
Changes regarding paediatric population was introduced. The following text was added: 
“The acceptable safety profile of bezlotoxumab alone and in combination with actoxumab defined in 
nonclinical studies has been confirmed in clinical trials in adult and paediatric patients. Therefore, 
additional nonclinical toxicity studies for the express purpose of evaluating effects in juvenile animals 
were not considered of value for establishing safety in the paediatric population and in accordance 
with ICH M3(R2) and ICH S11 recommendations, no studies in juvenile animals were conducted.” 
“Overall, the non-clinical profile supports the use of bezlotoxumab for the prevention of CDI 
recurrence in adult and paediatric patients 1 year of age and older.” 
• 
PART II: MODULE SIII - CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
Changes regarding paediatric population was introduced. The following text was added: 
“The paediatric clinical development program included a single Phase 3 clinical trial (MK- 6072 -001). 
The rationale for the paediatric clinical trial was to obtain PK and safety information to support the 
selection of a dose for paediatric patients over 1 year of age that would achieve bezlotoxumab 
exposures similar to those obtained in adults at the recommended dose (as a single IV infusion at 10 
mg/kg). Safety and PK data of a single IV infusion of bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg) in paediatric 
participants were consistent with data in adults. Given these findings, bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg) has 
a favorable benefit/risk profile in paediatric patients over 1 year of age.” 
“In addition to the adult clinical trials, MK-6072 P001 was a Phase 3, randomized, placebo- 
controlled, parallel group, multisite, double-blind study evaluating the PK, safety, tolerability, and 
efficacy of a single infusion of bezlotoxumab or placebo in paediatric participants 1 to <18 years of 
age receiving antibacterial drug treatment for CDI. Participants were randomized 3:1 to 
bezlotoxumab 10 mg/kg or placebo and were stratified by age at randomization (Age Cohort 1: 12 to 
<18 years of age, Age Cohort 2: 1 to <12 years of age). Participants were followed up for 12 weeks 
(ie, 85 ± 5 days) for PK and immunogenicity collections, monitoring of safety and tolerability 
parameters, and efficacy outcomes. The final sample size was 143 participants (107 treated with 
bezlotoxumab; 36 placebo). Although efficacy was a secondary objective, the study was not powered 
for the analysis of efficacy and an extrapolation approach incorporating the adult data was used.”

Potential Risks: 
„Based upon EMA GVP Module V (Rev 2) guidance, ‘Immunogenicity’ previously classified as an 
important 
potential risk, is removed from the list of RMP risks. This risk was maintained as the study MK-6072 
001 was considered an additional pharmacovigilance activity for bezlotoxumab. As study MK-6072 
001 is now completed, no new safety concerns were identified, no additional pharmacovigilance 
activities are planned to further characterize it, and immunogenicity following administration of 
bezlotoxumab is described in the label, this risk was removed from the list of Important Potential 
Risks. Routine risk minimization measures remain adequate for maintaining the positive benefit risk 
profile for the product use in the targeted indications.” 
The missing information: 
“Exposure in paediatric patients, previously identified as missing information, is removed from the list 
of safety concerns. The paediatric clinical trial MK-6072-001 (MK-6072 P001) demonstrated that the

Conclusion 
Overall, the changes regarding the list of safety concerns and Pharmacovigilance Plan in the RMP 
(version 3.0) are acceptable to the Committee, and in line with EMA GVP Module V (Rev 2) guidance. 
The MAH should take the following point into consideration at the next RMP update: 
1. The sentence in section II PART VI, “If important information that may affect the safe use of 
bezlotoxumab is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.”, should be erased as 
there are no missing information. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated to 
reflect the paediatric indication. The Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reason: 
In this submission, applying for the modification of the approved therapeutic indication for ZINPLAVA 
25 mg/mL concentrate for solution for infusion to include paediatric patients, the changes to the 
package leaflet for ZINPLAVA are limited. The only changes in the patient leaflet text are revisions of 
the paragraphs concerning the paediatric indication, i.e. section “1. What ZINPLAVA is and what it is 
used for” and “2. What you need to know before you take ZINPLAVA”, subsection “Children and 
adolescents”. There are no other proposed changes to the content of the package leaflet; in 
particular, the key messages for the safe use of the medicinal product are not impacted. 
Furthermore, the design, layout and format of the package leaflet will not be affected by the 
proposed revisions. 
Therefore, neither a consultation with target patient groups nor a focus test should be performed. 
The justification submitted by the company is acceptable by the CHMP.

Clostridioides difficile, is an anaerobic, spore-forming gram-positive bacillus. Strains that cause 
disease in humans produce toxins, in particular C. difficile toxins A and B. CDI occurs when toxigenic 
strains proliferate in the lower gastrointestinal tract after disruption of the normal bacterial colonic 
flora, typically after exposure to antibiotics. CDI results in a wide spectrum of clinical disease ranging 
from mild diarrhoea to severe illness with complications (e.g., ileus, toxic megacolon, or death). 
Although CDI more frequently affects adults and is strongly associated with advanced age, a minority 
of cases occur in susceptible paediatric patients. 
Many of the risk factors for CDI in paediatric patients are similar to those in adults (e.g., use of 
broad- spectrum antibiotics, or longer duration of hospital stay). In paediatric patients, CDI is also 
strongly associated with additional factors, including malignancy, inflammatory bowel disease, and 
immune suppression. 
Similar to adults, rCDI occurs in paediatric patients. This is typically due to further acquisition of 
another strain of C. difficile or persistence of the same pathogenic strain in the gut despite treatment, 
in particular in the form of highly antibiotic-resistant bacterial spores. RCDI within 8 weeks of a 
previously successfully treated CDI has been reported in 10.8 to 34.4% of paediatric cases [Ref. 5.4: 
082D8R, 080Z6L, 055T9Z] [Ref. 5.4: 082XYP, 05CYZL]. 
Risk factors for rCDI in paediatric patients are less well established compared with adults, but 
considered broadly similar to adults and include malignancy, recent surgery, exposure to multiple 
antibiotic classes, immunosuppressive medications, continued systemic antibacterial exposure during 
initial CDI illness, severe initial CDI, and infection with ribotype 027. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
A key component of the clinical management of CDI is to reduce the risk of recurrent CDI, especially 
in patients who have already experienced one or more recurrent episodes. RCDI is challenging and 
associated with a higher risk of further recurrence; various clinical management strategies may be 
used including tapered/pulsed administration of oral vancomycin, vancomycin followed by rifaximin, 
fidaxomicin, IV immunoglobulin, or therapy with other microorganisms, including faecal microbiota 
transplant [Ref. 5.4: 03QVFH]. The intention of these therapies is two-fold: treatment of the 
recurrent CDI episode and prevention of further recurrence. 
Bezlotoxumab is currently the only approved therapy specifically for the prevention of recurrent CDI 
in adults. Bezlotoxumab does not have antimicrobial activity and is administered concurrently with 
antibacterial drug treatments for CDI. Bezlotoxumab prevents recurrence by providing passive 
immunity against C. difficile toxin B produced by the outgrowth of persistent or newly acquired 
spores. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The paediatric clinical development program included a single study (P001). The rationale for the 
paediatric clinical study was to obtain PK and safety information to support the selection of a dose for 
paediatric patients that would achieve bezlotoxumab exposures similar to those obtained in adults at 
the recommended dose (as a single IV infusion at 10 mg/kg). The efficacy data are considered 
supportive by the CHMP. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Statistical analyses indicate that the 90% CIs of paediatric/adult GMR of serum bezlotoxumab AUC0-inf

(but not Cmax) are overall within the prespecified bounds for each age or weight cohort examined, 
supporting the extrapolation concept based on exposure bridging. 
In paediatric participants (1 to <18 years of age) with CDI who received a single IV dose of 
bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg) or placebo, the percentage of participants with CDI recurrence was low 
and comparable between the bezlotoxumab and placebo groups. 
The percentage of participants in the mITT population with initial clinical response who had CDI 
recurrence was low and comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab: 11,2%; placebo: 
14,7%). The percentage of participants in the mITT population with sustained clinical response was 
comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab: 83.7%; placebo: 82.9%).  
The percentage of participants in the mITT population with initial clinical response who had CDI 
recurrence and were at high risk for CDI recurrence was comparable between intervention groups 
(bezlotoxumab: 12.1%; placebo: 15.2%) [Table 14.2.3-18]. 
The percentage of participants in the mITT population with sustained clinical response and at high 
risk for CDI recurrence was comparable between intervention groups (bezlotoxumab: 82.5%, 
placebo: 82.4%) 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
There remains some uncertainty in the underlying assumption of PK similarity between paediatric 
subjects at all age or weight cohorts/bins and the adult population. 
For monoclonal antibodies, Ctrough  is often considered the most appropriate PK metric to correlate 
with efficacy. Treatment with Zinplava is intended as a single dose treatment, i.e., there is no Ctrough 
to correlate with efficacy. No data are available to date which indicate that the drug concentration in 
paediatric patients doesn’t decrease to potentially inefficacious levels earlier than in adults. While it is 
formally agreed that bezlotoxumab AUC and Week 12 serum concentration are within the adult 
range, sample sizes for the paediatric age/weight groups are low and a one-to-one comparison 
between paediatrics and adult patient population is seen critical (e.g. in terms of accompanying 
diseases). Mean and median exposure including Week 12 observations are below the adult value for 
all paediatric age/weight groups - except for adolescents (at or above 40 kg) - with lowest observed 
exposure for the age group 4 to <7 years of age (47.2% of adult median value) and for the weight 
group 30 to < 40 kg (52.5% of adult median value). Of note, the age group 4 to <7 would more fit to 
the weight group 20 to <30 kg. These results and non-linear relationship indicate that weight alone is 
not predictive of exposure following 10 mg/kg of bezlotoxumab, but there might other factors 
impacting PK. This is also reflected in the high CV% characterizing adult and paediatric PK metrics. 
As the amount and information content of paediatric PK data is critical to support the extrapolation 
concept (exposure bridging).  
The percentage of participants with CDI recurrence was low and comparable between the 
bezlotoxumab and placebo groups. RCDI within 8 weeks of a previously successfully treated CDI has 
been reported in 10.8 to 34.4% of paediatric cases. In the current study the incidence of RCDI was in 
the placebo group at the lower end the expected cases. Thus, a difference between the two groups 
could not be established in the small study. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
A higher observed incidence of AEs considered related to study intervention by the investigator was 
reported for the participants in the bezlotoxumab group (15.9%) compared with the placebo group 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
Page 81/80 
 
 
 
 
 
(8.3%), with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that included zero. The most frequently reported 
AEs considered related to study intervention in the bezlotoxumab group were ALT increased, AST 
increased, and headache (each for 3 [2.8% participants). The most frequently reported AE related to 
study intervention in the placebo group was headache (2 [5.6%] participants). 
There was a lower incidence of SAEs in the bezlotoxumab group (53.3%) compared with the placebo 
group (80.6%), with a 95% CI for the treatment difference that excluded zero. Most SAEs were 
considered not related to study intervention by the investigator. 
The most frequently reported SAEs (reported for ≥5% participants in either intervention group) were 
febrile neutropenia (bezlotoxumab: 20.6%; placebo: 30.6%), pyrexia (3.7%; 8.3%), C. difficile 
colitis (0.9%; 5.6%), and urinary tract infection (2.9%; 5.6%). 
SAEs considered related to study intervention by the investigator were reported for 2 participants 
(intussusception and nausea, 1 participant each), both in the bezlotoxumab group). 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Serious and non-serious AEs were common however the study was performed in a population with 
significant comorbidities consistent with a paediatric population with CDI. The data rather reflect the 
comorbidities in the trial population than the safety profile of bezlotoxumab.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
PK data of a single IV infusion of bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg) in paediatric participants are consistent 
with data in adults. 
The clinical efficacy demonstrated following a single IV infusion of 10 mg/kg, in paediatric CDI 
patients a comparable response in both intervention groups. The incidence of CDI recurrence was low 
in both groups. 
The safety data confirmed the favourable safety profile of bezlotoxumab observed in adult patients. 
No new safety concerns were identified based on findings from P001. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Safety and PK data of a single IV infusion of bezlotoxumab (10 mg/kg) in paediatric participants are 
consistent with data in adults. 
A clinical benefit over placebo could not be demonstrated. This might be attributed to the small 
sample size and low CDI in the study population. A lower background incidence of CDI was observed 
during the study period than in the period prior to MODIFY III. Since study enrolment partly occurred 
during the COVID-19 era, strict hygiene and cleaning practices were in place in hospitals and 
communities; this may have contributed to decreased recurrence rates. The MAH provided upon 
request comparison of observed bezlotoxumab concentration at week 12 in adults and paediatrics – 
statistics were stratified by age and weight groups, which is acknowledged. 
Results indicate that observed concentrations are within the range of those observed in adult patients. 
While it is formally agreed that bezlotoxumab AUC and Week 12 serum concentration are within the 
adult range, it is pointed out that sample size for the paediatric age/weight groups are low and a 
one-to-one comparison between paediatrics and adult patient population is seen as critical (e.g. in 
terms of accompanying diseases). Mean and median exposure including Week 12 observations are 
below the adult value for all paediatric age/weight groups except for adolescents, with lowest 
observed exposure for the age group 4 to <7 (47.2% of adult median value) and for the weight 
group 30 to < 40 kg (52.5% of adult median value). Of note, the age group 4 to <7 would more fit 
to the weight group 20 to <30 kg. 
These results and non-linear relationship indicate that weight alone (and per kg dosing) is not 
predictive of exposure following 10 mg/kg of bezlotoxumab, but there might other factors impacting 
PK. This is also reflected in the high CV% characterizing adult and paediatric PK metrics. In order to 
reflect the amount and information content of paediatric PK data, that would serve as confirmation of 
the extrapolation concept (exposure bridging), Section 5.2 of the SmPC was amended accordingly.

years of age).

Extension of indication to include treatment of the paediatric population (1 to 18 years of age) for 
ZINPLAVA, based on final results from study MK-6072-001 (MODIFY III) listed as a category 3 study 
in the RMP; this is a phase 3, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, multi-site, double-blind 
trial evaluating the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of a single infusion of 
bezlotoxumab in paediatric participants from 1 to <18 years of age receiving antibacterial drug 
treatment for Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI). As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 
5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. A revised RMP version 
3.0 has been approved. In addition, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity 
to introduce minor editorial changes to the PI. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet 
and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

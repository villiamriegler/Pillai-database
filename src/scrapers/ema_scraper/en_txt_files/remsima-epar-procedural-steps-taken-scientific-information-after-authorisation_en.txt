1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Therefore, the posology for the rheumatoid arthritis

subcutaneous formulation has been amended to reflect that 
treatment initiations can done with intravenous or 
subcutaneous loading doses. When subcutaneous loading is 
used, Remsima 120 mg should be given as a subcutaneous 
injection followed by additional subcutaneous injections at 
1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after the first injection, then every 2 
weeks thereafter. If intravenous loading doses of infliximab 
are given to initiate treatment, 2 intravenous infusions of 
infliximab 3 mg/kg should be given 2 weeks apart. The first 
treatment with Remsima administered subcutaneously 
should be initiated as maintenance therapy 4 weeks after 
the second intravenous administration. The recommended 
maintenance dose for Remsima subcutaneous formulation 
is 120 mg once every 2 weeks. 
Treatment of patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative 
colitis, ankylosing spondylitis, psoriatic arthritis and 
psoriasis should be initiated with IV infusions of infliximab

study designed to evaluate real life drug persistence

CT-P13 or those switched to CT-P13 from stable 
treatment with Remicade (reference medicinal

long-term safety and Important identified risks: serious 
infections including sepsis (initially including tuberculosis),

small sample size resulting from early study termination. 
The most frequent treatment related adverse drug

This study had been used as a data source to investigate 
submitted results were limited, however, cconsidering the 
totality of the safety data available for CT-P13 and the

that could have been gathered if this study would have 
been conducted for the full time period planned, would 
likely have been limited.

obligations and conditions of a marketing 
authorisation, including the RMP - Implementation of 
change(s) which require to be further substantiated 
by new additional data to be submitted by the MAH 
where significant assessment is required 
products.  The MAHs for these two products will share the 
safety database and from 2016 will submit a single PSUR 
covering both products.  Accordingly the MAHs have 
integrated the RMPs into a single RMP covering both 
products.   
The proposed post-authorisation pharmacovigilance 
development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise 
the risks of the product. There are no changes to the 
routine and additional risk minimisation measures as a 
consequence of the integration of the separate RMPs to 
form the Remsima/Inflectra RMP version 7.0.

pharmacodynamic profile that is similar to Remicade. The 
trial is too small to draw any conclusions on the efficacy 
and safety of CT-P13 relative to the reference product. The 
results with respect to efficacy and safety variables in this 
study do not, however, provide grounds to reconsider the 
conclusions drawn to date on the therapeutic similarity of 
CT-P13 and the reference product.

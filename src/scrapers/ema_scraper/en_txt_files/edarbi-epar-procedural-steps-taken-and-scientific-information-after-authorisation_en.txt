In the current Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) 
the following statement is included below the adverse drug 
reactions (ADR) table in section 4.8: ‘Angioedema, 
including circumoral oedema and periorbital oedema, was 
rarely seen in patients during open label treatment with 
Edarbi/Ipreziv’. Based on the fact that angioedema is a 
well-known class effect of Angiotensin II Receptor Blockers 
(ARBs), angioedema has been reported for azilsartan and 
has been assessed as being related to azilsartan medoxomil 
the PRAC considers that the adverse drug reaction 
‘angioedema’ should be included in the ADR table (SmPC 
section 4.8) under the system organ class (SOC) ‘Skin and 
subcutaneous disorders’. In addition the frequency ‘rare’ 
should be assigned based on a single case observed in a 
subject exposed to azilsartan medoxomil during the clinical 
trial program.

SmPC, as per the PRAC/CHMP request set out in the 
PRAC PSUR Assessment Report dated 7 March 2013, 
in order to:  
- include relevant contraindications and warnings 
regarding concomitant use of azilsartan medoxomil 
and aliskiren (section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5); 
- include the adverse drug reactions ‘rash’, ‘pruritus’, 
‘nausea’ and ‘muscle spasm’ with the frequency 
‘uncommon’ (section 4.8). 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
warnings regarding concomitant use of azilsartan 
medoxomil and aliskiren. A few published studies building 
upon the preliminary results of the ALTITUDE study which 
raised safety concerns regarding dual renin-angiotensin 
system (RAAS) blockade when aliskiren was co-
administered with angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) in 
patients with Type II diabetes mellitus and renal 
impairment, was the evidence that supported the PRAC 
request. To be noted that azilsartan medoxomil is an 
angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB), indicated for the 
treatment of essential hypertension in adults. 
The preliminary results of ALTITUDE study were assessed 
by the CHMP as part of an Article 20 of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004Article referral procedure (EMEA/H/C/000780/A-
20/0063) initiated by the EC covering all aliskiren 
containing products.  The CHMP opinion was issued in 
February 2012. At that time, based on the available data, 
the CHMP decided that the contra-indication for 
concomitant use of the ARBs and aliskiren should be 
extended to patients with moderate renal impairment 
(defined as patients with GFR < 60 mL/min/1.73m2) in 
addition to diabetic patients. 
No other direct evidence of such interactions (with 
aslikiren) in patients exposed to azilsartan medoxomil is 
available in the MAH’s safety database. Therefore the CHMP 
considered that based on the available evidence it is 
appropriate to include contraindications and warnings 
regarding concomitant use of azilsartan medoxomil and 
aliskiren. Conseqeuntly the SmPC section 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 
were updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, based on the conclusions of the PRAC AR on 
Page 9/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the responses to the request for additional information set 
out in the above mentioned PSUR procedures (LEG 003.1), 
the MAH proposed to include the side effects ‘rash’, 
‘pruritus’, ‘nausea’ and ‘muscle spasm’ in section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. The PL was proposed to be updated accordingly. 
Based on the submitted data and according to the PRAC 
assessment and conclusions, which indicated that a 
causality relationship was established between the 
mentioned side effects and the use of azilsartan 
medoxomil, the CHMP endorsed the MAH proposal to 
include the side effects ‘rash’, ‘pruritus’ under ‘Skin and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders’ system organ class (SOC), 
‘nausea’ under ‘Gastrointestinal disorders’ SOC and ‘muscle 
spasm’ under ‘Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders’ SOC in section 4.8 of the SmPC. It was 
considered that the proposed frequency,’ uncommon’, 
appropriately reflects the reported frequency.  
The Package Leaflet was updated accordingly.

Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Brintellix, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
During the reporting period, 9 cases of serotonin syndrome were received.  
An analysis of these cases led to the conclusion that in a number of cases a causal role of vortioxetine 
could not be excluded (plausible temporal relationship, recovery upon discontinuation of vortioxetine).  
Moreover, in a number of reported cases, the diagnosis of serotonin syndrome has been established by a 
physician and the event has been considered as possibly related by the reporter. 
Furthermore, based on a “class effect”, serotonin syndrome is currently considered as a potential risk in 
the RMP and based on this Serotonin Syndrome is mentioned in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Considering, the possibly related cases, the pharmacologic properties of vortioxetine and the SmPC 
guideline that states that any adverse reactions described in section 4.4 or known to result from 
conditions mentioned here should also be included in section 4.8, it the PRAC concluded that Serotonin 
Syndrome should be listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC with an unknown frequency. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding serotonin syndrome, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Brintellix, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance vortioxetine is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation(s) should be varied.

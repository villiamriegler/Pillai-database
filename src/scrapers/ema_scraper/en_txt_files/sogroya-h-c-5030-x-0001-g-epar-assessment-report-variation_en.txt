2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Growth hormone (GH)  deficiency is a rare disorder which  affects both  children and adults. It  is 
characterised by inadequate systemic availability of GH  due to  inadequate secretion from the anterior 
pituitary gland or destruction of the gland.  
The diagnosis of adult growth  hormone deficiency (AGHD) is defined according to  the consensus 
guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of AGHD. 1 
Clinical studies using biosynthetic GH have confirmed that  GH continues to play a vital role in 
optimising health  even after attainment  of final adult height  and has demonstrated that adults  with 
long-standing  GH deficiency derive substantial benefit from GH  replacement. 
Somapacitan growth  hormone product Sogroya is proposed for the replacement of endogenous GH in 
AGHD. 
2.2.  About the product 
Somapacitan is a long-acting recombinant human GH derivative with  a single substitution  in  the 
peptide backbone (leucine [L] at position 101  substituted  with  cysteine [C]) to which  an albumin 
binding moiety has been attached (see Figure 1). The albumin binding moiety (side-chain) consists of a 
C16 fatty acid moiety and a hydrophilic spacer attached to position 101  of the  protein by chemical 
conjugation. The non-covalent, reversible binding to endogenous albumin delays the elimination of 
somapacitan and thereby prolongs the in vivo half-life (t½  and duration of action). Similar techniques 
have previously been used to prolong the half-life of insulin and GLP-1 molecules, such as Levemir, 
Victoza and Ozempic.

and Endocrine  Society of Australia. Eur J Endocrinol.  2007;157(6):695-700.

Figure 1. Somapacitan bound to albumin 
The pharmacological effects of somapacitan are like those of human GH.  These include stimulation of 
somatic growth, especially skeletal and muscle growth and maintenance. In addition,  human GH has 
many other effects on the body including  increasing lipolysis, protein synthesis, muscle mass, and 
gluconeogenesis in the liver, and reducing glucose uptake in the  liver. As for human GH, the 
mechanism of action of somapacitan is either direct via the GH  receptor or indirect via stimulation of 
IGF-I expression and release. 
The approved product is a ready-to-use liquid formulation of 10 mg in a 1.5  ml cartridge (somapacitan 
10 mg/1.5  ml strength). Novo Nordisk applies for an additional  strength of a ready-to-use liquid 
formulation of 5 mg in a 1.5 ml cartridge (somapacitan 5 mg/1.5 ml strength). 
As indicated by the applicant,  the clinical development programme for somapacitan in  AGHD was 
conducted with  the somapacitan 10  mg/1.5 ml strength in  the PDS290 pen-injector. The in-use time 
for somapacitan is 6 weeks. As the maintenance/treatment dose of somapacitan is individualised, 
patients with  low somapacitan dose would not use the total  amount of the 10 mg/1.5  ml product within 
6 weeks. In clinical practice, somapacitan will be individually titrated to  the individual patient needs, 
according to  clinical response, IGF-I SDS and tolerability. No additional dosing adjustments are 
proposed to support the safe and effective use of somapacitan 5 mg/1.5  ml. Therefore, there will  be no 
need to  differentiate in  the prescriptions for the somapacitan 5 mg/1.5  ml and 10 mg/1.5 ml strengths. 
A somapacitan product strength of 5 mg/1.5  ml would enable the patients/physicians to  choose an 
appropriate somapacitan formulation depending on required dose of somapacitan and hence, the 
somapacitan 5 mg/1.5  ml strength offers an additional valuable choice with  a similar safety profile in 
the armamentarium for patients and physicians in  treatment of patients with  AGHD. 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted  a bioequivalence study (study number 
NN86409-4491)  in  healthy volunteers. 
The primary objective of the study was to confirm bioequivalence of two different strengths of 
somapacitan (5  mg/1.5 ml and 10 mg/1.5 ml)  administered subcutaneously in equimolar doses by 
assessing the total  somapacitan exposure (AUC0-t) and Cmax. 
The secondary objectives was to investigate other pharmacokinetic properties of somapacitan in 
subjects dosed with  two different strengths (5 mg/1.5  ml and 10 mg/1.5 ml) at  equimolar doses, and 
to investigate the pharmacodynamic properties of somapacitan in subjects dosed with  the two  different 
strengths at equimolar doses. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
This line extension concerns one strength  for which a bioequivalence study is submitted. A biowaiver is 
not applicable.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The  finished product  is  presented as  a  pre-filled pen  (solution  for  injection)  containing  10  mg/  1.5  ml 
(already marketed) or 5  mg/1.5ml (subject of this line extension) of somapacitan as active substance.  
Other ingredients are  
Histidine   
Mannitol   
Poloxamer 188  
Phenol  
Water for injections  
Hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment)  
Sodium hydroxide (for pH  adjustment).  
These are the  same for both  strengths  and were  also listed  in  the  application  for the  10  mg  strength. 
The new strength  is presented in its  own pen injector that  is distinguishable  from but  equivalent to the 
injector used for the already marketed 10 mg strength. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General  Information 
No changes are made to the active substance, which means it remains identical to the already approved 
active substance for Sogroya (somapacitan). 
However, CTD 3.2.S.4. Control of Drug Substance has been updated to include the validation of analytical 
methods common to  active substance and finished product for the 5 mg strength.   
2.4.2.2.  Manufacture,  process controls and characterisation 
Updated method validation reports have been provided. The following is noted:  
AIE-HPLC  (M 118) The validation of this method for the 5 mg strength is accepted.  
RP-UHPLC  (M120)  For  Related  Impurities  and  Hydrophilic  forms  2,  specificity  and  precision  of  the 
method has been confirmed with  somapacitan 5 mg and aged somapacitan 5 mg drug product samples.  
SE-HPLC  (M122)  For determination  of HMWP  and Content of somapacitan, specificity and precision of 
this method are sufficiently validated for somapacitan 5 mg drug product.

All  excipients  are  well  known  pharmaceutical  ingredients  and  their  quality  is  compliant  with  Ph.  Eur 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list  of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in the  table above. 
No overage or overfill is mentioned in the  CTD. 
This line extension concerns 1 strength for which a bioequivalence study is submitted (number NN8640—
4491).  A biowaiver is  not  applicable. Based on  the  presented bioequivalence  study  NN8640-4491,  the 
somapacitan 5 mg/1.5 ml is considered bioequivalent with the somapacitan 10 mg/1.5 ml, based on the 
IGF-I levels. 
Container closure system 
The primary packaging as stated in the SmPC is: 
“1.5 mL solution in a glass cartridge (Type I colourless glass) with a plunger made of chlorobutyl rubber 
and a stopper made of bromobutyl/isoprene rubber sealed with an aluminium cap.  
The  cartridge  is  contained  in  a  multidose  disposable  pen  made  of  polypropylene,  polyacetal, 
polycarbonate and acrylonitrile butadiene styrene and in addition two  metal springs.  
The cartridge is permanently sealed in  a pen-injector.  
Pack sizes of 1 pre-filled pen and multipack of 5 (5 packs of 1) pre-filled pen.” 
The introduction of a new silicone oil emulsion for siliconisation of the  cartridges is described. No other 
changes are reported in the container closure system. 
Assessment report  
EMA/153951/2022  
Page 10/31 
 
 
 
 
 
The MAH’s  approach to  the safety evaluation of the  new  silicone oil emulsion is  confirmed to be  in line 
with  the ICH M7,  and acceptable. 
The new silicone oil emulsion is compliant to Ph.Eur., and no other changes are reported. A new leachable 
study is  initiated.  The MAH  has made a commitment  to  provide the  results of this  study  once available 
(Recommendation). 
The product  is available in  a pre-filled pen.  The PDS290 pen-injectors with  integrated 1.5  ml  cartridge 
for somapacitan 10 mg or 5 mg are compliant to ISO 13485:2016.  The description of the device and its 
mechanistic aspects have been provided in sufficient detail. Dose accuracy has been verified for various 
dose settings and at various environmental conditions as per ISO 11608-1.  ISO certificates and a notified 
body report are provided and do not  raise any issues. The NB opinion report is sufficiently detailed and 
conformity  to  general  safety  and  performance requirements as  intended  in  Annex  1  of  EU  regulation 
2017/745  is  systematically reported. The choice of the  container closure system has been validated by 
stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Pharmaceutical development 
This section has been updated to encompass the 5 mg strength. In fact the only adaptation is the 5 mg 
strength  is  mentioned in  the  documents  next  to  the  already approved 10  mg  strength.  Also  a clinical 
bioequivalence study of the  5 mg strength has been added to the table of formulations tested in P.2.2.   
The  MAH  has  formulated the  5  mg  product  with  exactly  the  same composition  as the  10  mg  product 
except for the  lower  content  of somapacitan based on “formulation  development work performed with 
somapacitan drug product in a matrix covering drug product  strengths from 5 mg to  15 mg in  a 1.5 ml 
cartridge”, as mentioned with  this  same phrase in  the application  for the  10  mg strength.  However, no 
further  description  of  this  matrix  and  its  development  are  provided,  and  the  optimisation  studies 
described are  all  performed with  6.7  mg/mL  (corresponding to  the  10  mg  product).  As  no  significant 
detectable changes are expected by the lower somapacitan concentration there is no need for additional 
optimisation studies. 
The critical quality attributes identified were defined in eCTD section 3.2.P.5.6. Control Strategy for Drug 
Product. 
The manufacturing development have been evaluated through the use of risk assessment to identify the 
critical  product  quality attributes  and critical  process parameters. A  risk analysis was  performed using 
the  failure  mode  effect  analysis  (FMEA  method  in  order  to  define  critical  process  steps  and  process 
parameters that may have an influence on the finished product quality attributes.  The risk identification 
was based on the prior knowledge of products with  similar formulations and manufacturing processes as 
well  as  on  the  experience from  formulation  development,  process  design  and  scale-up  studies.  The 
critical process parameters have been adequately identified. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture  of the  product and process controls 
The  line  extension submission  also  included  a  type  II variation  to  transfer  the  formulation,  filling  and 
inspection  activities for  the  finished product  (cartridges) from Novo  Nordisk A/S, Hagedornsvej 1,  DK-
2820 Gentofte, Hovedstaden, Denmark to Novo Nordisk A/S, Hallas Allé, DK-4400 Kalundborg, Denmark. 
The  activities  at  the  Kalundborg  site  will  also  include  finished  product  QC  testing  (microbiological; 
sterility).  The  site  in  Gentofte  will  also  be  maintained  as  a  finished  product  QC  testing  site 
(microbiological; sterility). The changes apply to the approved Sogroya 10 mg strength  as well as to the 
Sogroya 5  mg  strength  currently  applied for  via  line  extension. In  connection  with  the  manufacturing 
site  transfer,  some  changes  were  introduced  in  the  manufacturing  process,  i.e.  an  optimized 
Assessment report

manufacturing  process  as  well  as  an  upscaled  batch  size  range  and  a  new  silicone  emulsion  for 
siliconization of the glass cartridges.  
The manufacturing process has been validated. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process 
is  capable of  producing the  finished  product  of intended  quality  in a  reproducible manner. Information 
on in-process controls has been provided. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification, analytical  procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product release and shelf specifications are considered acceptable, and include relevant 
tests to control general parameters, identity, specific bioactivity, content,  product-related impurities, 
process-related impurities, microbial controls and device functionality.  
The content of the 5 mg strength  is added to the specifications.  
Further, the specification for Bacterial endotoxins has been amended (i.e. now based on volume instead 
of protein  mass). The  new specification  is slightly  tighter  for the  10  mg  product and  clearly tighter  for 
the 5 mg product. This amended specification is acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) validated. 
The respective summaries have been provided for the verification of the  analytical procedures for the 5 
mg strength of the finished product in accordance with  ICH guidelines. 
Batch analyses 
For  the  5  mg  (new)  strength,  data  for  commercial scale  batches  and  laboratory scale  batches  were 
provided. Some of  the  batches are manufactured at  the new  site  and commercial scale. These are the 
batches that have been used to validate the  process at the new site.  
For the 10 mg (existing) strength,  and for the 15 mg strength (subject to a future application) data from 
commercial scale batches are added to  the dossier.  
The  acceptance  criteria  for  each  batch  are  presented  with  the  corresponding  test  results.  All  of  the 
batches  listed,  comply  to  the  acceptance  criteria,  confirming  the  consistency  of  the  manufacturing 
process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Reference standard 
The reference materials used  for testing  and  release of  the  finished product  are the  same as the  ones 
used  for  the  active  substance.  No  change  to  the  reference  materials  is  proposed  as  part  of  this 
application.

A picture of the  somapacitan 5 mg PDS290 pen-injector is added. As shown in Figure 2 and Figure 3 
below, it is distinguishable  from the 10  mg product by its colour and the numbering of the dose 
increments, which are half of those of the  10 mg product.

The summary of human factors validation has been updated to encompass the 5 mg strengths. The MAH 
has experience with  several similar pens that  are on the  market and has evaluated the  Somapacitan 5 
mg pen in comparison with  these. Clinical experience also confirms its adequate handling by patients in 
practice. No concerns are raised from this information. 
The  somapacitan  PDS290  pen-injector  used  in  clinical  trial  (see  Figure  4)  have  two  features  that 
differentiate it from the to-be-marketed device : 
• 
coloured components: 
o  green or brown cartridge holder (with  markings but no imprints) 
o  green cap 
o  brown dose button 
• 
dose indicator: 
o 
o 
sequential numbers shown on the  scale drum instead of ‘mg’ values 
“mg” imprint  next to the pointer is absent 
Figure 4. Somapacitan PDS290  pen-injector used in clinical trials 
The  mechanism  responsible  for  dialling  and  dosing  are  identical  in  the  clinical  and  to-be-marketed 
PDS290 pen-injectors. The difference between them have no influence on the dose delivery mechanism. 
It is noted that  the pens used in clinical trials differ from the pens to be marketed or already marketed. 
This  makes  the  experience in  pen  handling  by  patients  reported  in  clinical  trials  less  convincing  as 
evidence  for  the  commercial  pen  injector.  However,  the  differences  are  small  and  not  expected  to 
complicate handling by patients. 
The description of  the device and its  mechanistic aspects have been provided in  sufficient  detail and is 
acceptable. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed storage and shelf  life for somapacitan 5  and 10  mg  is 24  months  at  2-8  °C including  an 
in-use period of 6 weeks at 2-8  ºC and 72 hours (3 days) at or below 30 ºC.  
Stability  studies  for the  5  mg  strength  and finished  product  manufactured  at  the  Kalundborg  site  are 
added.

Based on the  data, the MAH’s  proposal of a shelf life of 24  months at 2-8  °C for somapacitan 5 mg and 
somapacitan  10  mg  drug  product  and  in-use  period  of  6  weeks at  2-8  ºC  including  the  possibility  of 
storage at or below 30 ºC for a maximum of 72  hours (3  days)  are justified and acceptable.  
Real  time/real  condition  stability  data  of    somapacitan  5  mg  and    somapacitan  10  mg  full  scale 
manufacturing  validation batches of finished  product from the  Gentofte site for 24  months  at  5 °C  ± 3 
°C/ambient  humidity/protected  from light  and  for  up  to  6  months  under accelerated conditions  at  25 
ºC±  2  °C/ambient  humidity/protected  from  light  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The 
batches of medicinal product are representative to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the 
primary packaging proposed for marketing. The parameters tested are the same as for release. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are 
acceptable. 
In  addition,  somapacitan  5  mg  and  somapacitan  10  mg  were  exposed to  light  as  defined  in  the  ICH 
Guideline  on  Photostability  Testing  of  New  Drug Substances  and  Products.  It  is  also agreed  that  data 
from  the  photostability  study  show  that  both  strengths  of  somapacitan  drug  product  are photostable 
when stored in the PDS290 pen-injector.  
Real  time/real  condition  stability  data  of  somapacitan  5  mg  and  somapacitan  10  mg  full  scale 
manufacturing validation batches of finished product from the Kalundborg site for up to 18  months at 5 
°C ±  3  °C/ambient humidity/protected  from light  and  for up  to 6  months  under accelerated conditions 
at  25  ºC±  2  °C/ambient humidity/protected  from  light  according to  the  ICH  guidelines were provided. 
The batches of medicinal product  are representative to  those proposed for marketing and  were packed 
in the primary packaging proposed for marketing. The parameters tested are the  same as for release. 
The  long-term  stability  study  of  the  process  validation  batches  for  full-scale  manufacturing  at  the 
Kalundborg site  is still  ongoing,  and data are provided for up to  18  months.  The study  will be  finalised 
according to  design and  provide the  final  report once available (Recommendation). The data  for up  to 
18 months  do not  give rise to  concerns.  
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Not  applicable (no changes reported with this  line extension). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
The active substance is identical to the approved presentation.  
The finished  product intended  for the  market is a line  extension to  the currently marketed Sogroya 10 
mg  (somapacitan  6,6  mg/ml).  Compared  to  Sogroya  10  mg  only  the  concentration  of  the  active 
substance  is  decreased to  3,3  mg/ml.  Overall, sufficient  quality  of the  new  5  mg  strength  of  Sogroya 
(somapacitan) is reasonably justified and comparable to the 10 mg strength. 
In  combination  with  the  introduction  of  the  new  strength,  the  MAH  proposes  a  transfer  of  the 
manufacture of Sogroya to a site in Kalundborg, a change in  the manufacturing process and an upscale 
of the  maximum batch size. The information  provided supports  the MAH’s  claim that  these  changes do 
not negatively impact the quality of the product.   
In  general, the  Quality  related documentation  on  development, manufacture  and control  of  the  active 
substance and finished product has been sufficiently presented. The results of tests  carried out indicate 
satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important  product quality characteristics.

No Major Objections were identified during the procedure. The Applicant has made commitments to keep 
the  Agency updated about  the data from ongoing  studies (leachable and  stability studies),  please refer 
to the section on recommendations for future quality development below. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality  of this  product is considered to be  acceptable when  used in accordance with  the  conditions 
defined in the SmPC. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
• 
• 
To  provide  the  results  of  the  new  leachable  study,  initiated  to  qualify  the  new  silicone  oil 
emulsion, once available.  
To provide the stability data covering the process validation batches for full-scale manufacturing 
at the Kalundborg site when the results are available. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of Somapacitan are known. As the 
current application is a line-extension for a new strength  of the  same pharmaceutical form, the 
applicant has not provided additional studies and further studies are not  required. No overview based 
on literature review is considered necessary. 
2.5.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction  of the  Line extension of an additional strength, Sogroya 5 mg, and transfer to  the new 
facility in Kalundborg (FF),  no increase in environmental exposure in the use of the  product is expected 
as the changes do not affect the maximum daily dose or the predicted forecast of amount of 
somapacitan API to be placed on the market. Thus, the  ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Application is a line-extension, from a non-clinical point  of view, the  pharmacology, safety 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicological properties are considered known. 
The active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will  not alter the concentration or 
distribution  of the substance in  the environment. Therefore, somapacitan is not  expected to pose a risk 
to the environment. 
2.5.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval of Sogroya 5 mg/1.5  ml from a non-clinical point of view.

2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the  effect that  clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out  in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.   
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted  1 bioequivalence study, number NN8640—
4491.    
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
This line extension concerns 1  strength for which a bioequivalence study is submitted  (see below). A 
biowaiver is not applicable. 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Study NN8640-4491:  A randomised, double-blind, single dose, three period, complete cross 
over trial in healthy  subjects investigating  the pharmacokinetics of subcutaneous injections 
of somapacitan 5 mg/1.5 ml and  10 mg/1.5 ml. 
Methods 
•  Study design  
This was a randomised, three-treatment, three-period, single dose, crossover bioequivalence study. 
Thirty-three healthy subjects were dosed in this  study. Each subject received after an overnight fast, 
subcutaneously a single dose in  equimolar doses of 0.04 mg/kg body weight  using the PDS290 pen-
injector of the  Test (5  mg/1.5 ml strength)  or the Reference somapacitan formulations (10 mg/1.5  ml 
strength).  The Reference was administered twice (semi-replicate study design).  
According to the  SmPC, the starting  dose in adults is 1.5  mg/week. The administered dose of 0.04 
mg/kg in this bioequivalence study is approximately in the range of this  starting dose. Moreover, linear 
pharmacokinetics was shown in the clinically relevant dose range. 
The washout period was 3 weeks. Blood samples were taken for pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamic assessment were taken up to 504 h after injection. It is indicated in the study  report 
that  the procedures for sampling, handling of samples, labelling, storage and shipment  will be carried 
out in accordance with  the laboratory manual. This manual has been provided on request. 
•  Test and reference products  
Somapacitan 5 mg/1.5ml,  solution for injection has been compared to Somapacitan 10 mg/1.5  ml, 
solution for injection. Both solutions were administered using the PDS290 pen injector. 
Assessment report  
EMA/153951/2022  
Page 16/31 
 
 
 
The composition of the Test 5 mg/1.5  ml solution for injection and 10 mg/1.5 ml solution  for injection 
are identical, except for the content  of the active ingredient.  
The Reference product is the companies own innovator product.  
The potency of the used Test and Reference formulation has been provided on request. The difference 
in somapacitan potency between the 5 mg/1.5  ml. Test batch and the 10 mg/1.5 ml Reference batch is 
7.8% based upon biological activity. For BE studies no correction needs to be applied in case the 
potency difference is within  5%.  However, considering that  somapacitan Test/Reference ratio’s in the 
BE study were lower (see below), i.e. 0.95  for AUC and 0.77 for Cmax, in case of potency correction 
based upon the  biological activity would be in favour of the Test (i.e. being more comparable). 
Moreover, 95% CI for the  pharmacodynamic parameters IGF-I AUC and Cmax were applied to support 
comparability between Test and Reference, showing comparability of both  products. 
The batch size of the Test formulation has been provided on request, and were within  the commercial 
batch size range. 
•  Population(s) studied 
Thirty-three healthy subjects were randomised in this study.  One subject in the treatment  sequence 
Reference/Test/Reference withdrew from the trial before receiving the third  treatment resulting in a 
total of 32 completers in the trial. In accordance with the  protocol, the  32 subjects completing the  trial 
were included in the  statistical analysis.   
•  Analytical methods  
For the analysis of somapacitan in human serum a specific LOCI assay was applied. The method 
proved to be sensitive and robust for analysis of somapacitan. Validation results showed acceptable 
performance within the  normal standard criteria. In addition,  somapacitan is stable in plasma during a 
sufficient long period. The method is similar to the method applied previous for the  original application 
of the 10mg/1.5  ml solution for injection. Incurred sample reanalysis showed good performance of the 
method during study sample analysis. 
The analytical method of IGF-I in serum showed acceptable performance of the method.  It was 
indicated that  the method has been validated. The applicant has confirmed on request, that  the 
method is similar to  the method applied previous for the original application of the 10mg/1.5  ml 
solution for injection. 
Incurred sample reanalysis showed good performance of the method during study sample analysis.   
•  Pharmacokinetic Variables 
Somapacitan AUC0-t and Cmax were considered the primary pharmacokinetic endpoints.  AUC0-168h, AUC0-
inf, tmax and t½ were considered secondary pharmacokinetic endpoints. 
Supportive secondary PD endpoints, i.e. AUC0-168h, Cmax and tmax, will be derived from the serum 
insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) concentration time curve. 
Assessment report  
EMA/153951/2022  
Page 17/31 
 
 
 
•  Statistical methods 
The primary endpoints AUC0-t and Cmax will be log-transformed prior to  analysis using an analysis of 
covariance model (ANOVA). The model will include product, period, sequence and subject within 
sequence as fixed effects. The variance will be allowed to depend on product. From this  model, the 
product difference will be estimated and the estimate will be back-transformed to original scale and 
presented as ratios with corresponding 90%  CIs. The estimated within-subject  deviation s(Cmax, 
Reference) for the Reference product from this model will be used when determining the width  of the 
acceptance range for Cmax. 
If within-subject  CV (Cmax, Reference) >30% then  for the EMA  guideline-based method: [U, L]  = exp 
[±k·s (Cmax, Reference)], where U is the  upper limit  of the  acceptance range, L is the lower limit  of the 
acceptance range, k is the regulatory constant  set to 0.760.  The two  products will be confirmed as 
bioequivalent (EMA-based method) if the  90% CI of Cmax lies completely within  [U,L]  as defined above, 
the point  estimate of the ratio lies within  [0.8;1.25]  and the 90%  CI of AUC0-t lies completely within 
the standard acceptance range [0.8;1.25].  If the within-subject  CV (Cmax, Reference) ≤30% then the 
90% CI for Cmax also needs to  lie completely within  the standard acceptance range [0.8;1.25].  The [U, 
L] cannot be extended beyond the range determined by a within-subject  standard deviation 
corresponding to a within-subject  CV of 50%.

•  Safety  data 
A total of 17 subjects had 34 AEs during the trial. The majority of the AEs (30 AEs in 16 subjects) were 
mild in severity and a few AEs (4 AEs in 4 subjects) were moderate in  severity. No subject had severe 
AEs. A total  of 22 AEs in  9 subjects were reported to be either possibly or probably related to 
somapacitan and 12 AEs in 10  subjects were unlikely to be related to  somapacitan according to the 
investigator. No action with  somapacitan was taken upon development of the AEs. At  the end of trial, 
all but 2  subjects recovered from their AEs, however later during the  reporting of the trial, it  was 
confirmed by the site that  the 2 subjects had recovered from their AEs. 
The most frequently reported AEs (≥5%  of the  subjects) by PTs were headache (8 AEs in 5 subjects 
[15.2%]),  back pain (3 AEs in 3 subjects [9.1%])  and vomiting (2 AEs in 2 subjects [6.1%]).  There 
was no apparent pattern of difference in the distribution  of AEs between the  two strengths of 
somapacitan. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacokinetic Conclusion   
Based on the primary pharmacokinetic endpoints of somapacitan, the  new 5mg/1.5 ml solution for 
injection is not bioequivalent to the Reference 10mg/1.5 ml solution  for injection. Bioequivalence is 
shown for AUC0-t, as the 90%  CI was within  the normal 80 – 125%  criteria. Although  the observed 
within-subject  variability for Cmax was 54.30% and in accordance with  EMA’s Guideline on the 
investigation of bioequivalence, the 90% CI could be widened to 0.70 – 1.43,  bioequivalence was not 
shown for Cmax, as the 90% CI was 0.68  – 0.89 and thus  outside the widened CI. 
Based on the secondary IGF-I endpoint  AUC0-168h, the new 5mg/1.5 ml solution  for injection is 
comparable to the Reference 10mg/1.5 ml solution for injection. However, as IGF-I can be considered 
a pharmacodynamic endpoint, 95% CI should be applied, instead of 90%  CI. In addition,  to further 
support the comparability in  IGF-I levels, the applicant was requested to provide data on Cmax levels, 
including a statistical  analysis and providing the  95% CI. This has been raised as a major objection. 
2.6.2.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this 
application. However, IGF-I was evaluated in the  bioequivalence study NN8640-4491.   
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Based on the submitted  bioequivalence study NN8640—4491  with a semi-replicate design, the new 
5mg/1.5  ml solution for injection is not  bioequivalent to the  Reference 10mg/1.5 ml solution for 
injection.  
Assessment report  
EMA/153951/2022  
Page 21/31 
 
 
 
 
Bioequivalence is shown for the somapacitan primary endpoint AUC0-t, as the  90% CI was within  the 
normal 80  – 125% criteria. Although the  observed within-subject variability for Cmax was 54.30%  and 
in accordance with EMA’s  Guideline on the investigation of bioequivalence, the 90%  CI could be 
widened to 0.70  – 1.43, bioequivalence was not shown for the somapacitan primary endpoint Cmax, as 
the 90%  CI was 0.68 –  0.89 and thus outside the  widened CI. From these pharmacokinetic results of 
somapacitan it  can be concluded that the  performance of the two formulations differ. It should 
therefore be justified that the  difference in somapacitan concentration levels for these formulations is 
not affecting the safety and efficacy of somapacitan itself.  Based on the applicant’s response it can be 
considered that  in the BE study, comparable somapacitan AUC values were observed. Cmax levels 
were lower, however, these are considered not relevant for the efficacy. This is confirmed by the 
pharmacodynamic/efficacy parameters AUC0-504h, IGF-I and Cmax, IGF-I, being comparable between 
Test and Reference.  
Safety concerns due to lower Cmax levels are not  anticipated. In study NN86409-4491,  no new safety 
issues were identified, although it  should be taken into  account that the number of subjects in the 
bioequivalence study is limited (n=32). 
Although the  observed difference in somapacitan pharmacokinetics, IGF-1  levels were used to further 
support the safety and efficacy of the new somapacitan formulation. Based on the  IGF-I endpoint 
AUC0-168h, the new 5mg/1.5  ml solution for injection is comparable to the Reference 10mg/1.5 ml 
solution for injection, as the 90% CI was within  80 – 125%, i.e. 0.98  – 1.02.  However, as IGF-I can be 
considered a pharmacodynamic endpoint, 95%  CI should be applied, instead of 90%  CI. In addition, 
no statistical  data on Cmax were provided. To further support the comparability in IGF-I levels, on 
request, data on Cmax levels were provided, including  a statistical  analysis and the 95%  CI. The 95% 
CI for IGF-I AUC and Cmax, i.e. 0.98 - 1.03  and 0.97  - 1.04,  respectively, show that  the 95% CI are 
within  the normal acceptance criteria for bioequivalence (i.e. 80  – 125%),  but also within  the narrowed 
90% CI for narrow therapeutic index drugs (i.e. 90 –  111%), indicating  that  the profiles are very 
similar. Furthermore, the  relevance of the applied bioequivalence criteria, i.e. 95% CI 80 – 125%,  has 
been further justified with  regard to  the support of the  safety and efficacy.  
In clinical practise, and as can be observed from the SmPC, initiation  of somapacitan treatment and 
subsequent monitoring will  be carried out by experienced specialist qualified in diagnosing and 
treatment of patients with  growth  hormone deficiency (e.g. endocrinologists). Of importance, IGF-I 
levels are used as a guidance for the  dose titration  apart from an evaluation of the clinical response 
and adverse events. The target range of the IGF-I standard deviation score (SDS) should not exceed 
+2 SDS.  Dosing and titration  (in small steps) will be done per individual patient. IGF-I SDS scores as 
biomarker will be used for dose titration.  After reaching the desired IGF-I SDS level, the  efficacy and 
safety of treatment will  be continuously evaluated; IGF-I levels is one of the control 
parameters/biomarkers. Considering this and  
-  Considering the  fact that the  dosing recommendation for proposed Sogroya 5 mg/1.5 ml 
solution for injection is similar to  that of the reference Sogroya 10 mg/1.5  ml solution for 
injection 
- 
- 
and considering that  the IGF-I AUC and Cmax for the new formulation is very similar to the 
reference,  
and considering that  IGF-I levels concern one of the  control parameters/biomarkers,  
a difference in safety and efficacy is not foreseen. Moreover, as indicated in the SmPCs for both 
products, after reaching the desired IGF-I SDS level, the  efficacy and safety of treatment  need to be 
continuously evaluated, which  will limit,  although not  expected, possible differences between both 
products.

EMA/153951/2022  
Page 22/31 
 
 
 
Therefore it is considered that  the lower somapacitan Cmax can be waived by the comparability in IGF-I 
exposure.  
All outstanding  issues are considered resolved.

2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with  target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH  and has been found acceptable for the  following reasons: This 
patient leaflet is similar to the already approved patient leaflet for the Sogroya 10 mg/1.5  mL. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU)  726/2004,  Sogroya (somapacitan) is included in the 
additional monitoring list  as it  is a biological product.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that  this will  allow quick identification  of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
This application concerns a line extension of somapacitan 10  mg/1.5 ml solution for injection, i.e. 
somapacitan 5 mg/1.5  ml solution for injection. 
The reference product somapacitan 10  mg/1.5 ml solution for injection, is indicated for the 
replacement of endogenous GH in adults  with growth  hormone deficiency. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this  application but an adequate summary of the 
available non-clinical information for the  active substance was presented and considered sufficient.  
From a clinical perspective, this application does not  contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the  active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature is considered 
sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study NN8640-4491  forms the pivotal basis with  a randomised, three-treatment, 
three-period, single dose, crossover design, in which the 10  mg/5 ml reference formulation was 
administered twice.  The study design is considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of the 5 
mg/1.5 ml solution  for injection and was in line with  the respective European requirements. Choice of 
dose, sampling points,  overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical 
method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical  methods applied are adequate. 
The 5 mg/1.5 ml test  formulation of somapacitan met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence 
when compared with  the 10 mg/1.5  ml reference formulation, with  regard to somapacitan AUC0-t. The 
point estimate and the 90%  confidence interval, i.e. 0.95 and 0.89 – 1.01,  respectively, were 
contained within  the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%.  With  regard to 
somapacitan Cmax, the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence were not met,  as the point  estimate 
and the 90% confidence interval, i.e. 0.77  and 0.68 – 0.89,  respectively, were not contained within  the 
protocol-defined widened acceptance range of 70.00  to 143.00%.  This widened acceptance criteria was 
based upon the  proven high within-subject  variability in this  study and in accordance with EMA’s 
Guideline on the  investigation of bioequivalence.

However, although  this observed difference in somapacitan pharmacokinetics, based on the  IGF-I 
endpoint AUC0-168h (and Cmax), the new 5mg/1.5 ml solution for injection is comparable to the 
Reference 10mg/1.5 ml solution for injection, as the 90% CI was within  the protocol-defined criteria 
for bioequivalence of 80.00  – 125.00%,  i.e. 0.98 – 1.02.  Moreover, as IGF-I can be considered a 
pharmacodynamic endpoint, by applying the 95%  CI, the  CI was still within  normal criteria for AUC0-
168h and Cmax, i.e. 0.98 - 1.03  and 0.97 - 1.04,  respectively. 
In clinical practise, initiation  of somapacitan treatment  and subsequent monitoring  will be carried out 
by experienced specialist qualified in  diagnosing and treatment  of patients  with growth  hormone 
deficiency. Dosing and titration  (in  small steps) will  be done per individual patient.  IGF-I SDS scores as 
biomarker will be used for dose titration.  After reaching the desired IGF-I SDS level, the  efficacy and 
safety of treatment will  be continuously evaluated; IGF-I levels is one of the control 
parameters/biomarkers. Considering this and the fact that  after administration of the somapacitan 5 
mg/1.5 ml and 10 mg/1.5  ml solution for injection a comparable IGF-I exposure (AUC0-168h) and IGF-I 
concentration-time curve is observed, a difference in safety and efficacy is not  expected. Therefore it is 
considered that  the lower somapacitan Cmax can be waived by the comparability in IGF-I exposure.  
There are no outstanding  issues. 
3.1.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Sogroya is positive, subject to the conditions  stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that  Sogroya is not similar to Lonapegsomatropin Ascendis 
Pharma and Ngenla within  the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC)  No. 847/2000.  See 
appendix 1.  on similarity. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP  review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that  the benefit-risk balance of, Sogroya new strength is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Sogroya is indicated for the replacement of endogenous growth  hormone (GH) in adults  with growth 
hormone deficiency (AGHD). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the  marketing authorisation for Sogroya subject 
to the following  conditions:

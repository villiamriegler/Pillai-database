1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Mylan IRE Healthcare Limited 
submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 20 December 2022 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update frequency information of several adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) as well as to update clinical efficacy information based on final results from study 
ZeNix (NC007) listed as a specific obligation (SOB/001) in the Annex II. This is a Phase III Partially 
Blinded, Randomized Trial Assessing the Safety and Efficacy of Various Doses and Treatment Durations of 
Linezolid plus Bedaquiline and Pretomanid in Participants with Pulmonary Infection of Either Extensively 
Drug Resistant Tuberculosis (XDRTB), pre-XDR-TB or Treatment Intolerant or Non-Responsive Multi-Drug 
Resistant Tuberculosis (MDRTB) - ZeNix study. The Annex II and Package Leaflet are updated 
accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement editorial changes in the SmPC and to 
update the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and 
Package Leaflet. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Dovprela (pretomanid) is indicated in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, in adults, for the 
treatment of pulmonary XDRTB, or treatment-intolerant or non-responsive MDRTB. Tuberculosis (TB) is 
rare in the EU, and this product was designated an orphan medicine on 29-Nov-2007.  
The MAH proposed to update sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC to include frequency information of 
several ADRs as well as to update clinical efficacy information based on results from ZeNix study listed as 
a specific obligation (SOB/001) in Annex II of the product information (PI). Moreover, the applicant 
proposed to change the recommended starting dose for linezolid in the pretomanid-based regimen, from 
1200 mg to 600 mg daily. Finally, the applicant provided confirmatory and comprehensive data in the 
context of the Conditional Marketing Authorisation (CMA) that was issued on 31-Jul-2020. 
Prior to the approval of pretomanid in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid (B-Pa-L), the treatment 
of extensively resistant TB required between 6 and 9 medicinal products used for 9-24 months. 
Predictably, outcomes were not satisfactory, with about half of treated patients failing to be cured. 
Dovprela received a CMA based on NixTB study, showing cure rates of approximately 90% with 6 months 
of treatment. Based on this, B-Pa-L is currently the standard therapy for XDR-TB. A SOB including a 
randomised clinical trial versus previous therapy was not considered feasible as part of the CMA. The 
applicant was rather asked to replicate the findings for NixTB, and to further explore the optimal linezolid 
dosing. 
ZeNix trial was conducted to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various doses and treatment durations of 
linezolid, in combination with bedaquiline and pretomanid for 26 weeks in participants with pulmonary 
infection of either XDR-TB, pre-XDR-TB, or treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive MDR-TB.  
ZeNix trial was designed based on Nix-TB trial, in which the B-Pa-L regimen employing a 1200 mg 
linezolid dose was highly efficacious but not well tolerated. Recruitment, however, was extended 
Assessment report  
Page 4/29 
 
 
 
 
 
somewhat compared to Nix-TB study, with regards to resistance status, including also patients classified 
as pre-XDR. Participants in ZeNix study were treated with bedaquiline (200 mg daily for 8 weeks followed 
by 100 mg daily for 18 weeks), pretomanid (200 mg daily for 26 weeks), and linezolid (randomised to 
either 1200 mg or 600 mg daily for 26 weeks or 9 weeks in a double-blinded design).  
The efficacy of the B-Pa-L regimen, which was demonstrated in NixTB study, from pivotal to approval, 
was replicated in ZeNix study. Numerically, the 1200 mg linezolid 26-week group had the highest 
percentage of participants with a favourable outcome at 26 weeks after the end of treatment (93.2%); 
the 600 mg linezolid 26-week and 1200 mg linezolid 9-week treatment groups followed with 91.1% and 
88.9%, respectively. The 600 mg linezolid 9-week group had the numerically lowest percentage of 
participants with a favourable outcome (84.1%). Overall, ZeNix study confirmed the benefit of the B-Pa-L 
regimen observed in Nix-TB study for improving outcomes in highly drug-resistant TB. 
The efficacy of a linezolid starting dose of 600 mg was similar to that of 1200 mg. However, the 
uncertainty around the estimate is larger for 600 mg, with only 45 patients receiving this dose. Moreover, 
the time to culture conversion was somewhat longer when the starting dose was 600 mg rather than 
1200 mg. On the other hand, it is notable that also with 600 mg for only 9 weeks, the rate of favourable 
outcomes was high and meaningful (n=45). 
The B-Pa-L regimen is associated with hepatotoxicity (pretomanid, bedaquiline), QT-prolongation 
(bedaquiline), myelosuppression and peripheral neuropathy (linezolid). Overall, ZeNix study confirmed 
the known safety profile of the B-Pa-L regimen, with no new emerging safety concerns. The presented 
data confirmed the benefits assumed at the time of the Conditional Marketing Authorisation.  
The 1200 mg 26-week treatment group had the highest percentage of participants with at least 1 
treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) associated with peripheral neuropathy (17 participants 
[37.8%]), followed by the 600 mg linezolid 26-week and 1200 mg 9-week groups (11 participants each 
[24.4% and 23.9%, respectively]).   
The 600 mg linezolid 9-week treatment group had the lowest percentage of participants with at least 1 
TEAE associated with peripheral neuropathy (6 participants [13.3%]). Remaining symptoms of 
neuropathy at 26 weeks post therapy was seen in 7% of participants in the 1200 mg 26 weeks arm, and 
in none of the patients in the other treatment arms. 
The 600 mg dose of linezolid was associated with fewer required dose modifications, no optic neuropathy 
cases, and fewer peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression events. The 1200 mg linezolid dose 
showed a less favourable safety profile in the 26-week group than in the 9-week group. However, the 600 
mg linezolid 26-week and 9-week groups showed less difference in safety outcomes. Hematologic toxicity 
was uncommon in both 600 mg linezolid arms. 
In summary, the 600 mg 26-weeks regimen is clearly superior safety-wise than the 1200 mg 26-week 
treatment arm. The lower dose arm is numerically similarly efficacious. However, the uncertainty around 
this estimate is greater than that for 1200 mg.  
The MAH claimed that the 600 mg dose has the most favourable benefit/risk balance. The safety profile is 
clearly better than 1200 mg. Numerically, it yielded similar cure rates as the 1200 mg dose in ZeNix study. 
Moreover, cure rates remained high although numerically lower when a regimen with a starting dose of 600 
mg was given for only 9 weeks. Altogether, if there would be an edge for the higher dose regarding efficacy, 
this is likely to be no more than minor. It is agreed that this uncertainty is acceptable, given the clearly 
better safety profile of the lower starting dose.  
Balance of benefits and risks 
Based  on  the  review  of  all  available  data,  the  CHMP  considers  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  Dovprela 
outweigh remains positive.

Scientific grounds for recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation not subject to 
specific obligations 
The MAH provided within this variation their position that comprehensive data are available about the safety 
and efficacy of Dovprela and supporting the favourable benefit/risk profile of in all approved populations, 
as the submission of this variation application contains the data outstanding from the last remaining specific 
obligation (SOB) as follows: 
Description 
In order to further evaluate the safety, efficacy and tolerability of linezolid plus 
bedaquiline and pretomanid after 26 weeks of treatment in participants with either 
pulmonary XDR-TB, pre-XDR TB, or treatment intolerant or non-responsive MDR-TB, 
the marketing authorisation holder should complete and submit results from the 
ongoing study ZeNix – A Phase 3 Partially-blinded, Randomized Trial Assessing the 
Safety and Efficacy of Various Doses and Treatment Durations of Linezolid Plus 
Bedaquiline and Pretomanid in Participants With Pulmonary Infection of Either 
Extensively Drug-resistant Tuberculosis (XDR-TB), Pre-XDR-TB or Treatment Intolerant 
or Non-responsive Multi-drug Resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB) 
Due date 
Final report by  
Q4 2022 
The MAH therefore requested to take the opportunity of the present type II variation to remove the 
submission of the ZeNix study from the list of specific obligations and to adopt an opinion recommending 
the granting of a marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 (‘marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations’).  
The clinical safety profile, as well as the efficacy of this product is considered comprehensively 
characterised and supportive of a positive benefit-risk balance. In conclusion, having reviewed the data 
submitted by the MAH including the evidence concerning compliance with specific obligations, the CHMP 
is of the opinion that the risk-benefit balance of Dovprela remains favourable, that all specific obligations 
laid down in Annex II have been fulfilled and that comprehensive data supports a favourable benefit-risk 
balance of the above-mentioned medicinal product. 
Therefore, following fulfilment of the specific obligations in accordance with Article 14-a(8) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004 and considering that comprehensive data have now been provided, the CHMP is of 
the view that the granting of a standard marketing authorisation not subject to specific obligations and 
valid for five years can be recommended in accordance with Article 14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
The benefit-risk balance of Dovprela remains positive. The proposed changes to the product information 
are accepted.

5.  Introduction 
Dovprela (pretomanid) is indicated in combination with bedaquiline and linezolid, in adults, for the 
treatment of pulmonary XDRTB, or treatment-intolerant or non-responsive MDRTB. Tuberculosis (TB) is 
rare in the EU, and this product was designated an orphan medicine on 29-Nov-2007. On 31-Jul-2020, 
the European Commission granted a CMA for Dovprela, including one SOB (i.e., ZeNix study) to fulfil.  
This is a Type II variation aiming to update sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC of Dovprela in order to 
update frequency information of several ADRs as well as to update clinical efficacy information based on 
final results from ZeNix (NC007) study listed as a specific obligation (SOB/001) in the Annex II of the 
product information.  
This study was built upon the Nix-TB trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of two doses of linezolid 
and at different treatment durations (600 mg and 1200 mg for 9 weeks and 26 weeks) along with 
bedaquiline and pretomanid for 26 weeks in participants with pulmonary infection of either XDR-TB, pre-
XDR-TB, or treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive MDR-TB.  
No new non-clinical data was provided.  
The product information is updated to reflect these new data, including a change in the starting dose of 
linezolid from 1200 mg/day to 600 mg/day.  
6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
6.1.  Analysis of data submitted and results 
ZeNix study was based on the learnings from the pivotal Nix-TB study presently reflected in the SmPC. It 
was designed to optimise linezolid dosing with the aim of potentially limiting toxicity while preserving 
efficacy.  
Methods 
In this trial, pretomanid was evaluated in phase III partially-blinded, randomised trial assessing the 
safety and efficacy of various doses and treatment durations of linezolid plus bedaquiline and pretomanid 
(B-Pa-L) in participants with pulmonary infection of either extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis (XDR-
TB), pre-XDR-TB or treatment intolerant or non-responsive multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB).  
XDR-TB is defined as tuberculosis with resistance to both rifampicin and isoniazid and to at least one 
fluoroquinolone and a second-line injectable agent (amikacin, capreomycin or kanamycin). Pre-XDR is 
defined as tuberculosis resistant to rifampicin and isoniazid together with resistance to either a 
fluoroquinolone or a second-line injectable agent. MDR-TB is defined as tuberculosis resistant to 
rifampicin and isoniazid. 
This 4-arm study randomised subjects to varying linezolid doses (1200 or 600 mg once daily and varying 
lengths of linezolid treatment (9 or 26 weeks). 
Assessment report  
Page 9/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 1. Treatment groups 
The trial was performed at multiple centres located in South Africa, Eastern Europe, and Russia. 
Eligible individuals were males and females aged 14 years or older (18 years for sites in Moldova and 
Russia) with XDR-TB, pre-XDR-TB, or treatment-intolerant or nonresponsive MDR-TB. Key exclusion 
criteria included any unstable condition likely to impact survival over the study period, including 
extrapulmonary TB requiring extended treatment, as well as likely resistance to the test drugs. There 
were also exclusion criteria relating to the risk of QT-prolongation and hepatotoxicity. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of treatment failure (unfavourable outcome) defined as 
bacteriologic failure or relapse or clinical failure at 6 months (26 weeks) after the end of therapy. 
Participants were classified as having a favourable, unfavourable, or un-assessable status at 6 months 
(26 weeks) after the end of treatment. 
No formal statistical pairwise comparisons between the arms were performed. The proportions of 
assessable participants with a favourable and unfavourable outcome, with 95% and 97.5% confidence 
intervals (CIs), were presented. For success, the lower bound of the 95% CI (or 97.5% if the Bonferroni 
adjustment was used) for a favourable outcome was to be above 50%. A 50% treatment success rate 
was chosen as the target, because it is above the entire range of the historical control for cure of XDR-TB. 
The analysis of the primary endpoint using the modified intent-to-treat (MITT) population was considered 
primary. This excluded subjects on the following grounds: 
1. Patients who, having completed treatment, are lost to follow-up or withdrawn from the study, 
their last status being culture negative and their last positive culture result (“isolated positive 
culture”) followed by at least two negative culture results at different visits (at least 7 days apart, 
without an intervening positive culture) 
2. Women who become pregnant during treatment and stop their allocated treatment.  
3. Patients who die during treatment from violent or accidental cause (e.g., road traffic accident). 
N.B.: This does not include death from suicide, which will be considered an unfavourable 
outcome.  
4. Patients who die during follow-up (after the end of treatment) with no evidence of failure or 
relapse of their TB, their last status being culture negative and their last positive culture result 
(“isolated positive culture”) followed by at least two negative culture results at different visits (at 
least 7 days apart), and who have not already been classified as unfavourable. 
Assessment report  
Page 10/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
5. Patients who, after being classified as having culture negative status, are re-infected with a 
new strain different from that with which they were originally infected. Reinfection will be defined 
specifically as a patients infected with a strain that is genetically different from the initial strain.  
6. Patients who are able to produce sputum at their primary endpoint visit, whose sputum 
samples are all contaminated or missing, who cannot be brought back for repeat cultures, 
provided they have not already been classified as unfavourable and provided their last positive 
culture was followed by at least two negative cultures. N.B.: This does not apply to patients who 
are unable to produce sputum at 6 months after end of treatment, or to patients who are able to 
be brought back subsequently and produce negative cultures.  
Patients in categories 1-6 above who had already been classified as having unfavourable outcome 
will not be excluded.   
The primary analysis was for the linezolid 1200 mg taken for 26 weeks arm (L1200 26 weeks), with the 
L1200 9 weeks and L600 26 weeks analysis only being tested if L1200 26 weeks was a success.   
A Bonferroni adjustment was made to compare the L1200 9 weeks and L600 26 weeks arms 
simultaneously, using p<0.025, i.e., used the 97.5% CI.  Similarly, the L600 9 weeks arm was only 
tested if the L600 26 weeks arm was successful.  
Secondary endpoints included the proportion of participants classified as favourable at 18 months (78 
weeks) after the end of treatment (intent-to-treat (ITT), MITT, and per protocol (PP) populations). 
Study subject disposition 
A total of 181 subjects were randomised.

Figure 1. Disposition of participants 
The ITT population consisted of 181 participants randomised to trial treatment.   
The MITT population was a subset of the ITT population, consisting of 178 participants who did not have 
any late screening failures or any predefined withdrawals/exclusions during the trial. The reasons for 
exclusion from the MITT population (i.e., categorised as un-assessable) were lost to follow-up during the 
follow-up period and culture negative when last seen (1 participant in the 1200 mg linezolid 26-week 
group), withdrawal during the follow-up period and culture negative when last seen (1 participant in the 
600 mg linezolid 9-week group), and death (violent or accidental, not including suicide) during the 
treatment period (1 participant in the 1200 mg linezolid 9-week group).

Baseline disease and demographic characteristics 
Males represented 67.4% of the subjects included in the trial and the median age of all subjects was 36.0 
years. 63.5% of subjects were white. The treatment groups were comparable with respect to 
demographic characteristics. Seventy-one participants (39.2%) were from Russia, 66 (36.5%) were from 
South Africa, 34 (18.8%) were from Georgia, and 10 (5.5%) were from Moldova. The proportion of 
participants from Georgia, Moldova, and Russia was numerically larger in the 1200 mg linezolid 26-week 
group than in the other 3 treatment groups: 75.6% versus 60.9%, 53.3%, and 64.4% for the 1200 mg 
linezolid 9-week, 600 mg linezolid 26-week, and 600 mg linezolid 9-week groups, respectively.  
The median body mass index (BMI) of all participants was 20.8 kg/m2 (range 17.1 to 31.0 kg/m2), which 
was similar across treatment groups. At Screening, 36 participants (19.9%) were HIV positive (a 
stratification factor); 9 HIV-positive participants were randomised to each treatment group.

Results 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of treatment failure (unfavourable outcome) defined as 
bacteriologic failure or relapse or clinical failure at 6 months (26 weeks) after the end of therapy. 
Participants were classified as having a favourable, unfavourable, or un-assessable status at 6 months 
(26 weeks) after the end of treatment.  
Numerically, the 1200 mg linezolid 26-week group had the highest percentage of participants with a 
favourable outcome at 26 weeks after the end of treatment (93.2%); the 600 mg linezolid 26-week and 
1200 mg linezolid 9-week treatment groups followed with 91.1% and 88.9%, respectively.  
The 600 mg linezolid 9-week group had the numerically lowest percentage of participants with a 
favourable outcome (84.1%). The incidences of unfavourable outcomes by both dose and duration was 
6.8% for the 1200 mg linezolid 26-week group. The outcome of primary efficacy analysis is presented in 
the table below.

Of the 130 participants who were culture positive at baseline, 125 (96.2%) were culture converted. All 
participants in the 1200 mg linezolid 26-week treatment group who were positive at baseline were culture 
converted. Of the 5 participants who did not convert, 1 participant was in the 1200 mg linezolid 9-week 
group, 2 participants were in the 600 mg linezolid 26-week group, and 2 participants were in the 600 mg 
linezolid 9-week group. The median time to culture negative status was 4 weeks (interquartile range 
[IQR] = 2 to 8 weeks) for both, 1200 mg linezolid treatment groups regardless of total duration of 
linezolid. The 600 mg linezolid 26-week group had a longer median time to culture conversion of 6 weeks 
(IQR = 3 to 8 weeks). The 600 mg linezolid 9-week group had a median time to culture conversion of 6 
weeks. Time to culture conversion in the different treatment groups are presented in the figure below.

6.2.  Discussion on efficacy 
In ZeNix study, the participants with pulmonary infection of either XDR-TB, pre-XDR-TB, or treatment-
intolerant or non-responsive MDR-TB, treatment with various doses and durations of linezolid plus 
bedaquiline and pretomanid for 26 weeks resulted in all treatment groups meeting the pre-specified

threshold for success of the treatment regimen (the lower bound of the 95% CI, or 97.5% CI as 
appropriate, for a favourable response being greater than 50%), as measured by the percentage of 
participants with a favourable outcome at 26 weeks after the end of treatment.  
Although the statistical power is limited, the 1200 mg linezolid 26-week group had the numerically 
highest percentage of participants with a favourable outcome at 26 weeks after the end of treatment 
(93.2%); the 600 mg linezolid 26-week and 1200 mg linezolid 9-week treatment groups followed with 
91.1% and 88.9%, respectively (MITT population). The 600 mg linezolid 9-week group had the lowest 
percentage of participants with a favourable outcome (84.1%).  
The positive outcomes at 26 weeks after the end of treatment were largely maintained at 78 weeks after 
the end of treatment.  
Overall, this study confirms the efficacy of the 26-week B-Pa-L regimen, assumed at the time of the CMA. 
While the efficacy of a 600 mg linezolid starting dose appears similar to the labelled 1200 mg dose, the 
evidence for the former dose is limited to 45 patients treated for 26 weeks, supported by another 45 
patients treated for 9 weeks. Moreover, time to sputum conversion is somewhat longer with the lower 
starting dose. It is notable, however, that also for 600 mg/9 weeks, the proportion of patients with a 
favourable outcome was high and clinically meaningful. Overall, if there is a true advantage of a 1200 mg 
starting dose, it is anticipated to be minor.  
The 9-week treatment duration for linezolid may be associated with a higher failure rate, particularly with 
the lower starting dose. 
7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
7.1.  Analysis of data submitted and results 
Extent of exposure 
The total safety population of ZeNix comprised 181 patients. Bedaquiline and pretomanid exposure was 
as follows: 
Table 12. Bedaquiline and pretomanid exposure (safety population) 
Assessment report  
Page 18/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table below summarizes the linezolid exposure for the safety population:  
Table 13. Linezolid exposure (safety population) 
Regarding linezolid dose interruption, the percentage of participants with at least 1 linezolid pause was 
greater (by a factor of >2) with increased linezolid dose: 22.2% and 26.1% for the 1200 mg linezolid 26-
week and 9-week groups, respectively, versus 6.7% and 8.9% for the 600 mg linezolid 26-week and 9-
week groups, respectively. The mean pause duration was also nominally longer in the two 1200 mg 
groups (15.1 days and 14.1 days for the 26-week and 9-week groups, respectively) than in the 600 mg 
dose groups (10.7 and 12.0 days for the 26-week and 9-week groups, respectively). 
Discontinuations of linezolid (excluding those due to withdrawal of the participant from the trial or death) 
were only reported in the 26-week treatment groups: 4 participants (8.9%) and 1 participant (2.2%) in 
the 1200 mg and 600 mg linezolid 26-week groups, respectively. 
Adverse effects 
Of the 181 participants in ZeNix safety population, 156 participants (86.2%) experienced at least 1 TEAE. 
Percentages were similar across treatment groups. Any study drug related TEAE was reported from 116 
participants (64,1%).  
The 1200 mg linezolid 26-week group had the highest percentage of participants who experienced a 
study drug related TEAE (75.6%). The percentages of drug-related TEAEs in the 1200 mg linezolid 9-
week, 600 mg linezolid 26-week, and 600mg linezolid 9-week treatment groups were 63.0%, 60.0%, and 
57.8%, respectively.  
The 1200 mg linezolid 26-week group had the numerically greatest number of participants with at least 1 
TEAE leading to linezolid reduction (9 participants [20.0%]), followed by the 1200 mg linezolid 9-week 
treatment group (6 participants [13.0%]), the 600 mg linezolid 9-week group (4 participants [8.9%]), 
and the 600 mg linezolid 26-week group (3 participants [6.7%]) (Table below).

Table 14. Overview of treatment-emergent Adverse Events in study ZeNix (safety population) 
The most common TEAEs (preferred terms) related to linezolid overall were peripheral sensory 
neuropathy (11.0%), neutropenia (7.7%), hepatic enzyme increased (7.2%), hypoesthesia (7.2%), 
anaemia (6.6%), paraesthesia (5.5%), and nausea (5.0%). The TEAEs were consistent with the known 
safety profile of linezolid (Table below).

Eleven participants (6.1%) overall experienced a total of 15 serious TEAEs. 
Table 17. Incidence of serious TEAEs, including death (Safety population) 
Deaths 
Overall, 1 participant (0.6%) experienced a total of 2 TEAEs leading to death. On Day 95 of trial 
treatment, the participant experienced the grade 4 serious TEAEs of toxicity to various agents (reported 
term: exogenous intoxication with methadone) and brain oedema. He was found unconscious in the 
bathroom by medical staff, and after prolonged resuscitation measures, he expired the same day with 
multiple organ failure. The investigator reported this death as “Acute heart failure” following an overdose 
of methadone. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESIs) 
Hepatotoxicity is a known risk with pretomanid and bedaquiline. Overall, 3 participants (1.7%) 
experienced a total of 3 serious liver related TEAEs. The 1200 mg linezolid 9-week, 600 mg linezolid 26-
week, and 600 mg linezolid 9-week treatment groups each had 1 participant with a serious liver-related 
TEAE. The serious TEAE of drug-induced liver injury was experienced by 2 participants (1.1%) overall, 
with 1 participant (2.2%) each in the 1200 mg and 600 mg linezolid 9-week treatment groups. The 
serious TEAE of hepatitis B was experienced by 1 participant (2.2%) in the 600 mg linezolid 26-week 
treatment group. this event met the laboratory criteria for a potential Hy’s law case. 
Peripheral neuropathy is a known adverse effect of long-term use of linezolid. The 1200 mg 26-week 
treatment group had the highest percentage of participants with at least 1 TEAE associated with 
peripheral neuropathy (17 participants [37.8%]), followed by the 600 mg linezolid 26-week and 1200 mg 
9-week groups (11 participants each [24.4% and 23.9%, respectively]).  The 600 mg linezolid 9-week 
treatment group had the lowest percentage of participants with at least 1 TEAE associated with peripheral 
neuropathy (6 participants [13.3%]).

Figure 3. Kaplan-Meier curve of time (Days) to first peripheral neuropathy TEAE (Safety 
population) 
All the reported TEAEs were mild (majority of events) or moderate. No grade 3 or grade 4 peripheral 
neuropathy TEAEs were reported. Longer linezolid treatment duration or higher dose appeared to result in 
higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy. 
With respect to reversibility, it was only in patients allocated to 1200 mg linezolid for 26 weeks that 
remaining symptoms were reported 26 weeks post therapy. 
Table 18. Peripheral neuropathy: Interference with walking or sleeping for participants with a 
zero score at baseline (Safety population) 
Myelosuppression is also a known adverse effect of long-term use of linezolid. The 1200 mg linezolid 26-
week group had the highest incidence of TEAEs related to myelosuppression, as identified using the 
Standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQ) for hematopoietic cytopenias: 28.9% for 1200 mg linezolid 26-week 
versus 15.6%, 15.2%, and 13.3% for 600 mg linezolid 9-week, 1200 mg linezolid 9-week, and 600 mg 
linezolid 26-week groups, respectively. The majority (82.4%) of myelosuppression TEAEs were mild or 
moderate. Overall, myelosuppression appeared to be associated with higher linezolid doses and, for the 
1200 mg dose, with longer duration of linezolid treatment. 
Four participants (2.2%) had optic neuropathy (another linezolid associated side effect) that reversed; all 
were in the 1200 mg linezolid 26-week group.

Prolongation of QT interval is a known adverse reaction for bedaquiline. A total of 14 participants (7,7%) 
reported a TEAE potentially indicative of cardiac rhythm disturbance. The maximum event severity was 
grade 1(mild). No grade 4 (life-threatening) TEAE potentially indicative of cardiac rhythm disturbance 
were reported. Integrated analyses of TEAEs, electrocardiogram parameters and pretomanid exposure 
showed no evidence that pretomanid causes clinically significant changes in QT duration. 
7.2.  Discussion on safety 
The safety outcomes of ZeNix study largely confirmed the safety profile of the B-Pa-L regimen as 
assessed at the time of CMA. No new safety concerns emerged. 
Overall, the B-Pa-L regimen with lower doses and/or shorter durations of linezolid improved safety 
profiles compared to the 1200 mg 26-week regimen.  
The 1200 mg 26-week treatment group had the highest percentage of participants with at least 1 TEAE 
associated with peripheral neuropathy (17 participants [37.8%]), followed by the 600 mg linezolid 26-
week and 1200 mg 9-week groups (11 participants each [24.4% and 23.9%, respectively]). The 600 mg 
linezolid 9-week treatment group had the lowest percentage of participants with at least 1 TEAE 
associated with peripheral neuropathy (6 participants [13.3%]). Remaining symptoms of neuropathy at 
26 weeks post therapy was seen in 7% of patients in the 1200 mg 26 weeks arm, and in none of the 
patients in the other treatment arms. 
Comparing the 1200 mg and 600 mg linezolid treatment groups matched for duration, the 600 mg groups 
experienced consistently less peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression for both durations (26 weeks 
and 9 weeks).  
Comparing the 26-week and 9-week treatment groups matched for dose, the 9-week duration was 
consistently associated with less peripheral neuropathy and myelosuppression at the 1200 mg linezolid 
dose, but there was relatively little difference in incidence of myelosuppression at the 600 mg dose. With 
respect to considering the lower dose 600 mg linezolid 26-week group versus the lower duration 1200 mg 
linezolid 9-week group, the former appeared to show advantages with respect to lower incidences of 
linezolid dose modifications, serious TEAEs, TEAEs leading to linezolid interruption, TEAEs leading to 
linezolid reduction, and laboratory results indicative of myelosuppression. Overall, a lower dose and 
cumulative exposure to linezolid is associated with a more favourable safety profile.

The Applicant acknowledges the Agency’s query on 600 mg and 1200 mg doses of linezolid. The Applicant 
proposes starting dose of linezolid to be 600 mg and not 1200 mg based on the ZeNix trial results. 
In  the  Nix-TB  trial,  90%  of  the  patients  with  highly  drug-resistance  tuberculosis  (TB)  who  received 
bedaquiline, pretomanid, and linezolid (1200 mg) for 26 weeks had a favorable outcome. However, the use 
of linezolid 1200 mg daily was associated with a high incidence of adverse events.  
The ZeNix trial was built upon the Nix-TB trial to investigate the safety and efficacy of two doses of linezolid 
and  at  different  treatment  durations  (600  mg  and  1200  mg  for  9  weeks  and  26 weeks)  along  with 
bedaquiline  and  pretomanid  for  26  weeks  in  participants  with  pulmonary  infection  of  either  extensively 
drug-resistant  (XDR)-TB,  pre-XDR-TB,  or  treatment-intolerant  or  nonresponsive  multi-drug  resistant 
(MDR)-TB. Participants in the ZeNix trial were treated with BPaL regimen [bedaquiline (200 mg daily for 
8 weeks followed by 100 mg daily for 18 weeks), pretomanid (200 mg daily for 26 weeks), and linezolid 
(600 mg daily for 26 weeks/9 weeks or 1200 mg for 26 weeks/9 weeks, in a blinded design)].  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the incidence of an unfavourable outcome, defined as treatment failure 
or disease relapse (clinical or bacteriologic) at 26 weeks after completion of treatment.  
The ZeNix trial results confirm the benefit of the BPaL regimen observed in the Nix-TB trial for improving 
outcomes in highly drug-resistant TB and expand this observation to the pre-XDR population. Overall, the 
efficacy results between 1200 mg and 600 mg 26-week linezolid regimen were similar including the primary 
and secondary efficacy results. Especially for the primary endpoint favourable outcome, the results were 
similar between the 600-mg 26-week linezolid regimen [91% (41 of 45) participants] and the 1200-mg 26-
week linezolid regimen [93% (41 of 44) participants] (table below) with minor numerical difference. The 
secondary  analyses  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  in  the  intend-to-treat  (ITT)  and  per-protocol  (PP) 
populations and sensitivity analyses (sensitivity analysis treating all deaths as unfavorable and sensitivity 
analysis treating all reinfections as unfavourable) were consistent with the primary efficacy analysis.

Safety:  
Overall, the 600 mg linezolid 26-week group, showed a more favourable safety profile than in the 1200 mg 
linezolid 26-week group. The 600-mg 26-week linezolid regimen showed lower percentage of drug-related 
TEAEs  (60.0%)  compared  with  the  1200-mg  26-week  regimen  (75.6%).  The  600-mg  26-week  linezolid 
regimen  had  a  numerically  lower  percentage  of  participants  with  at  least  one  grade  3  or  grade  4  TEAE 
(20.0%) compared with the 1200-mg 26-week linezolid regimen (31.1%). One (2.2%) participant in the 
600-mg 26-week linezolid regimen and 3 (6.7%) participants in the 1200-mg 26-week linezolid regimen,

reported  serious  TEAEs.  A  lower  percentage  of  participants  in  the  600  mg  26-week  linezolid  regimen 
required  dose  modification  (reduction,  interruption,  or  discontinuation)  of  linezolid  as  compared  to 
participants in 1200-mg 26-week linezolid regimen (13.3% versus 51.1%). 
Analyses of TEAEs Related to Peripheral Neuropathy, Myelosuppression and Optic Neuropathy 
Prolonged use of linezolid is associated with peripheral neuropathy, myelosuppression and optic neuropathy 
(WHO consolidate TB guidance 2022 - enclosed in m1- additional data folder). The ZeNix trial revealed that 
the incidence of these events were all lower/nil in the 600-mg 26-week regimen compared to the 1200-mg 
26-week  regimen  (Conradie  F  et  al,  2022-enclosed  in  m1  additional  data  folder).  Further,  a  comparison 
between 600 mg and 1200 mg linezolid regimens, on the incidences of these events are discussed below. 
Peripheral Neuropathy 
A search of the database using the standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) of peripheral neuropathy revealed 
that the 600-mg 26-week linezolid regimen had the lowest percentage of participants (11 of 45 participants 
[24.4%]) with at least one TEAE associated with peripheral neuropathy as compared to participants with 
1200-mg 26-week linezolid regimen (17 of 45 participants [37.8%]) (Table below).  
Myelosuppression 
A search of the database using the SMQ of myelosuppression revealed that the 600-mg 26-week linezolid 
regimen had the lowest percentage of participants (6 of 45 participants [13.3%]) with at least one TEAE 
associated with myelosuppression as compared to participants with 1200-mg 26-week regimen (13 of 45 
participants [28.9%]) (Table below).  
Optic Neuropathy 
A search of the database using the SMQ of optic neuropathy revealed that the 600-mg 26-week regimen 
had no participants with at least one TEAE associated with optic neuropathy as compared to participants 
with 1200-mg 26-week regimen (4 of 45 participants [8.9%]) (Table below).

WHO Recommendation (WHO consolidated guidelines on TB, 2022) 
Assessment report  
Page 27/29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  current  World  Health  Organisation  (WHO)  consolidated  guidelines  on  TB,  were  developed  based  on 
data from several studies including the ZeNix trial and recommend the use of 600 mg linezolid over 1200 
mg  linezolid,  for  26  weeks  as  part  of  the  BPaL  regimen  with  or  without  moxifloxacin  in  adults  with 
MDR/(Rifampicin resistant) RR-TB or pre-XDR-TB. 
Conclusion 
Given the similar efficacy across the two doses, 600 mg and 1200 mg of linezolid 26 weeks, the risk-benefit 
ratio which is largely driven by safety and tolerability, favours the 600 mg linezolid dose. In particular, the 
600  mg  dose  was  associated  with  fewer  linezolid  dose  modifications,  fewer  incidences  of  peripheral 
neuropathy and myelosuppression, with no incidence of optic neuropathy. The 600 mg linezolid regimen 
also showed to have lesser incidences of TEAEs and SAEs as compared with 1200 mg linezolid. 
Based on the above points, the 600 mg linezolid 26-week regimen with most favourable risk-benefit ratio 
among  the  dosing  regimens  studied,  concurs  with  the  WHO  Guideline  Development  Group  (GDG)  panel 
recommendation of 600-mg 26-week linezolid regimen of linezolid in adult patients with MDR-TB or pre-
XDR-TB. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH proposal to use 600 mg linezolid as a starting dose, is agreed. Data are compatible with similar 
efficacy as with a starting dose of 1200 mg. The uncertainty about any difference in efficacy is agreed to 
be  acceptable,  and  the  safety  profile  is  clearly  more  favourable  with  the  600  mg  dose  compared  to  the 
1200 mg dose.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved. 
Question  2.    Please  provide  further  justification  for  shifting  the  following  AEs  from  Very  Common  to 
Common  in  the  4.8  Tabulated  list  of  adverse  reactions:  pruritus,  musculoskeletal  pain,  increased 
gammaglutamyl transferase and increased amylase. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The updated ADR table submitted in Dec 2022 includes all patients from Nix and ZeNix dosed for 26 weeks 
with  linezolid  1200mg.  An  increasing  denominator  decreased  the  frequency  of  the  following  events 
{pruritus,  musculoskeletal  pain,  increased  gamma-glutamyl  transferase  and  increased  amylase  with 
observed frequency of ≤ 2%} from very common to common. The current updated ADR table includes all 
participants from Nix and ZeNix dosed for 26 weeks with linezolid (600 and 1200 mg). Hence in comparison 
to the revision in December 2022, a few additional preferred terms {headache, abdominal pain, rash} are 
shifted  from  “Very  Common”  to  “Common”  during  the  current  update.  In  addition,  few  preferred  terms 
shifted from “Uncommon” to “Common”: oral candidiasis, hypomagnesaemia, dry eye and blood creatinine 
increase (all new PT`s in the “common” category were observed with a frequency equal or inferior to 2%). 
Assessment of the MAH’s response  
The  MAH  has  provided  a  justification  for  the  changes  in  frequencies  for  pruritus,  musculoskeletal  pain, 
increased gammaglutamyl transferase and increased amylase. In addition, the MAH has also moved other 
reactions, as a result of adding the group receiving 600 mg linezolid to the denominator.  
Conclusion: Issue resolved. 
Question 3. Please include headings and numerations for the tables under 5.1.

Summary of the MAH’s response 
The  tables  under  5.1  have  been  updated  with  headings  and  numerations.  For  consistency  within  the 
document, also a table header was included for the ADR table in 4.8. 
Additional revisions in the combined product information were made to address the assessor’s comments 
in the labelling document: 
- Section 4.2: Change of the appropriate starting dose of linezolid from 1200 mg to 600 mg 
-  Section  4.8:  Update  of  the  ADR  table,  taking  into  account  also  the  45  patients  treated  with 
pretomanid in the group with 600 mg linezolid/26 weeks. Due to the revised starting dose, the MAH 
is of the opinion that this patient group should be included also in the ADR table. 
-  Section  5.1:  Description  of  the  proportions  with  XDR,  pre-XDR  and  MDR  TB,  as  well  as  the 
demographics for the patients in the ZeNix trial. 
The additional revisions are included in track changes and were in addition highlighted. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The proposed changes are substantially agreed. However, there are some remaining formalities with respect 
to the clarity of the SmPC.  
Conclusion: Issue partially resolved.

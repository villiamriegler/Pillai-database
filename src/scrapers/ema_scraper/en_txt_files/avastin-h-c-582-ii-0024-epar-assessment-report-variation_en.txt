1. 
Introduction 
Avastin (bevacizumab) is a recombinant humanized monoclonal antibody that selectively binds to all 
isoforms of and neutralizes the biologic activity of human vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 
Bevacizumab contains human framework regions with the complementarity determining regions of a 
humanized murine antibody that binds to VEGF. Bevacizumab consists of 214 amino acids and has a 
molecular weight of approximately 149 kD. 
Bevacizumab binds to vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and thereby inhibits the binding of 
VEGF  to  its  receptors,  Flt-1  (VEGFR-1)  and  KDR  (VEGFR-2),  on  the  surface  of  endothelial  cells. 
Neutralising the biological activity of VEGF reduces the vascularisation of tumours, thereby inhibiting 
tumour growth. Avastin is currently authorised among other indications for the treatment of metastatic 
breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel containing chemotherapy. 
Paclitaxel  and  docetaxel  share  similar  chemical  structures  and  anti-tumour  activities  but  differ  in 
haematological toxicity profiles. The present consensus is that both taxanes are active in treating mBC 
when used as either single agents or in combination therapy and the toxicities associated with each are 
clinically manageable. The use of bevacizumab with paclitaxel is approved for first-line treatment of 
mBC.  This  combination  resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  benefit  for  patients  with  a  significant 
improvement over paclitaxel alone in progression-free survival and objective response rate and with 
an acceptable safety profile, although some doubts with regard to the methodology of the pivotal trial 
E2100 were raised. As docetaxel is widely used as first-line treatment in mBC, there is a rationale for 
combining  bevacizumab  with  docetaxel.  Furthermore,  there  is  evidence  from  preclinical  studies  that 
bevacizumab  together  with  docetaxel  exhibit  synergistic  antiangiogenic  activity,  as  assessed  by 
endothelial cell proliferation and tubule formation.

Clinical aspects 
The evaluation of the efficacy of bevacizumab at doses of 7.5 and 15 mg/kg q3w in combination with 
docetaxel  in  patients  with  locally  recurrent  or  mBC  is  based  on  the  results  of  one  pivotal  Phase  III, 
double-blind,  placebo-controlled  study  (BO17708).  The  submission  of  the  results  from  study 
BO17708 fulfils post-approval commitments following the review of the initial application to register 
bevacizumab as first-line treatment of mBC in combination with paclitaxel based on the E2100 study.  
The design of the pivotal phase III study, BO17708, is consistent with established standards, carried 
out in accordance with the EMEA Guideline on the Evaluation of Anticancer Medicinal Products in 
Man  (CPMP/EWP/205/95/Rev.3/Corr)  and  conforming  with  the  principles  outlined  in  the  Guideline 
for  Good  Clinical  Practice  ICH  Tripartite  Guideline  (January  1997)  or  with  local  law  if  it  afforded 
greater protection to the subject. The study was approved by the institutional review board or ethics 
committee of each participating centre. The full package of data provided in this application is given

2. 1.  Pharmacokinetics 
No  new  studies  have  been  performed  in  support  of  this  application.  The  clinical  pharmacology  of 
bevacizumab  has  been  extensively  investigated  in  previous  studies.  However,  pharmacokinetic 
parameters have not been evaluated with concomitant docetaxel.  
2. 2.  Pharmacodynamics 
The  mechanism  of  action  of  bevacizumab  is  well  known.  No  new  data  on  pharmacodynamics  are 
presented. 
2. 3.  Clinical efficacy 
Dose-response studies  
No new dose-response studies are presented for the present study. 
Two  doses  of  bevacizumab  were  selected  in  the  pivotal  study  BO17708;  each  dose  in  combination 
with  docetaxel  was  tested  against  placebo  with  docetaxel  for  efficacy.  The  higher  dose  of 
bevacizumab was chosen to be 15 mg/kg q3w, the same dose as that used in study E2100, the pivotal 
study  which  tested  paclitaxel  alone  vs.  paclitaxel  plus  bevacizumab  (10 mg/kg  q2w,  i.e.,  5 mg/kg 
weekly equivalent), and which was subsequently approved for the treatment of mBC.  
The  applicant  considered  it  prudent  to  investigate  whether  a  lower  dose  would  also  be  effective  in 
mBC; 7.5 mg/kg q3w (i.e., 2.5 mg/kg weekly equivalent) was chosen as this dose had already proven 
to be efficacious in other indications (mCRC and advanced NSCLC).  
No  consistent  dose-response  relationship  has  been  found  in  the  range  2.5  mg/kg/week  –  10 
mg/kg/week. It is reasonable to test also the lower dose, as is done in the pivotal study. Although two 
doses of bevacizumab were tested in the study, no formal statistical comparisons of efficacy between 
the two doses were planned; however, an exploratory analysis was conducted.  The dosing schedule 
for both doses used in study BO17708 (q3w) was chosen to be in alignment with the frequency of the 
chemotherapy regimen (docetaxel).

The dose of docetaxel used in this study (100 mg/m2) is that currently approved in the EU for use as 
monotherapy  in  the  treatment  of  mBC.  Because  there  are  no  other  extensive  studies  exploring 
bevacizumab  in  combination  with  docetaxel,  the  full  safety  profile,  including  the  potential  for 
overlapping toxicities, has not been established previously. The same starting dose of docetaxel in all 
arms was therefore used to help maintain homogeneity between groups and facilitate the interpretation 
of the study. It is also noted that docetaxel as monotherapy is not indicated for first line treatment of 
breast cancer (EPAR Taxotere). 
Main clinical study 
The  pivotal  study  BO17708  is  a  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicentre  study  to 
evaluate  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  docetaxel  in  comparison  with 
docetaxel plus placebo as first line treatment for patients with HER2-negative metastatic and locally 
recurrent breast cancer. It is a multicenter study sponsored and conducted by F. Hoffmann-La Roche 
Ltd  in  106  centers  in  24  countries  (Western  Europe/Australia/Canada;  Eastern  Europe;  East  Asia; 
Central and South America). The study was randomized and double-blind. Patients and investigators 
were blinded to the nature of treatment but not to the dose level each patient received. The same vial 
sizes and volumes of infusate were used for bevacizumab and placebo.  
Overall,  study  BO17708  enrolled  a  typical  mBC  population,  suitable  for  first-line  therapy with  full-
dose  docetaxel.  Pre-  and  post-menopausal  female  patients  who  were  at  least  18 years  of  age  with 
histologically  or  cytologically  confirmed  HER2-negative, 
recurrent  or  metastatic 
adenocarcinoma  of  the  breast  were  enrolled.  Measurable  or  non-measurable  disease  was  allowed. 
Patients  were  candidates  for  chemotherapy  with  an  ECOG  performance  status  (PS) of  0  or  1.  Three 
patients  were  HER2-positive,  and  although  being  protocol  violators,  were  included  in  the  primary 
analysis of the ITT population. 
locally 
Prior  non-taxane  adjuvant / neo-adjuvant  chemotherapy  was  allowed  as  long  as  the  last  dose  of 
chemotherapy  was  not  within  six  months  of  randomization.  Patients  receiving  taxane-containing 
adjuvant chemotherapy were eligible only if they received their last chemotherapy ≥ 12 months prior 
to  randomization.  If  chemotherapy  was  anthracycline-based,  the  maximum  cumulative  dose  of  prior 
anthracycline therapy could not exceed 360 mg/m2 for doxorubicin and 720 mg/m2 for epirubicin.  
Patients were excluded if they had other primary tumours within the last five years, had evidence of 
spinal cord compression or brain metastases, had undergone a major surgical procedure within 28 days 
of randomization, had pre-existing peripheral neuropathy (NCI-CTC Grade > 2), a history or evidence 
of  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  disease,  cerebrovascular  accident/stroke  (≤ 6  months  prior  to 
randomization),  bleeding  diathesis,  or  clinically  significant  cardiovascular  disease,  including 
myocardial  infarction  within  6 months  of  randomization,  unstable  angina,  congestive  heart  failure 
(NYHA grade II), or uncontrolled hypertension. 
A total of 736 patients were enrolled into study BO17708. The first patient was randomized on March 
20, 2006 and the last on April 12, 2007. At the time of the clinical cut-off date (October 31, 2007), 
185/241 patients (77%) in the Pl + Doc arm, 192/248 (77%) in the Bv 7.5 + Doc arm, and 203/247 
(82%) in the Bv 15 + Doc arm were alive (in treatment or in follow-up). 
The demographic and baseline characteristics of patients were comparable across the treatment arms. 
All patients were female (as per the inclusion criteria), the majority were white (~84% in each arm), 
and the mean age was ~53 years in all three arms. Most patients (73%) were aged between 40 and 64 
years of age; 16% - 19% were older than 65 years.  
The  three  treatment  arms  were  well  balanced  with  regard  to  breast  cancer  history  and  previous 
therapies for breast cancer:  
•  96% - 99% of patients had a history of metastatic disease; 1% – 4% of patients had a history 
of local disease only. 
•  81% - 86% had measurable disease at baseline.  
•  47% - 48% had well differentiated or moderately differentiated primary tumour at baseline. 
•  99% had undergone previous surgery for breast cancer.  
4 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  53% - 55% of patients were previously treated with anthracyclines; 37% - 39% with 
aromatase inhibitors; 15% - 17% with taxanes.  
The  treatment  arms  were  reasonably  well  balanced  with  respect  to  the  incidence  of  target  and  non-
target  lesions  at  baseline,  the  most  frequent  of  which  were  in  the  bone  (55%  -  60%),  liver  (40%  - 
50%), and lung (38% - 42%); lymph node metastases were reported in 45% - 53% of patients. Target 
lesions were in line with this observation. The mean number of lesions and number of sites per patient 
were also balanced across the three treatment arms. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the duration of PFS defined as the time from randomization to first 
documented disease progression or death from any cause, whichever occurred first.  
Secondary endpoints were: 
•  Best  overall  response  (OR)  defined  as  either  a  confirmed  complete  response  (CR)  or  a 
confirmed partial response (PR) analyzed in patients with measurable disease at baseline. 
•  Duration of response (DR) defined as the time interval between when a response (CR or PR) 
was first documented and disease progression or death occurred. 
•  Time  to  treatment  failure  (TTF)  defined  as  the  time  between  randomization  and  the  date  of 
either disease progression, death or withdrawal of treatment due to adverse events, withdrawn 
informed consent, insufficient therapeutic response, refusal of treatment / failure to co-operate, 
or failure to return, whichever occurred first.  
•  Overall survival (OS) defined as the time between randomization and death due to any cause; 
the study was not powered for OS but an initial analysis of OS was performed at the time of 
the final analysis for PFS.  
•  Change  in  patients’  quality  of  life  scores  measured  with  the  FACT-G  and  FACT-B 
questionnaires. 
Tumour assessments (by the investigators based on RECIST criteria) using CT / MRI / bone scans and 
X-rays were performed at baseline and every nine weeks until week 36 and thereafter every 12 weeks 
until disease progression, always within seven days of the scheduled visits. The assessment schedule 
was  identical  across  the  treatment  arms.  Based  on  the  robust  nature  of  the  study  design,  including 
blinding,  independent  radiological  review  of  disease  assessment  was  not  mandated.  This  is  in 
agreement  with  the  EMEA  Guideline  on  the  Evaluation  of  Anticancer  Medicinal  Products  in  Man 
(CPMP/EWP/205/95/Rev.3/Corr)  regarding  absence  of  independent  review  in  properly  randomized, 
blinded  trials  where  investigator  evaluation  may  be  sufficiently  reliable  as  a  basis  for  treatment 
comparisons.  However,  as  trialists  may  have  guessed  by  the  side  effects  of  the  treatment  which 
treatment group a given patient was in, bias with regard to tumour assessment cannot be completely 
ruled out. Clinical examinations were performed before each cycle. Quality of life was assessed on the 
basis of a change from screening in the scores of the FACT questionnaires at cycles 3, 5, and 11. 
The primary population for efficacy analysis was the intent-to-treat (ITT) population which included 
all patients randomized into the study. Data were analyzed using standard statistical methods including 
log-rank tests for the comparison of survival distributions, Cox regression models to determine hazard 
ratios, and Kaplan-Meier curves with median survival estimates and confidence limits. 
The primary analysis of PFS was based on an unstratified analysis and included all progression events. 
A  closed  test  procedure  was  employed  to  adjust  for  the  multiplicity  of  testing  (comparing  the  two 
bevacizumab-containing arms against the placebo arm). Sensitivity analyses (PFS on treatment, PFS 
before  the  start  of  non-study  anti-neoplastic  treatment)  were  performed  to  test  the  robustness  of  the 
results.  The  analysis  censored  for  non-study  anti-neoplastic  treatment  (the  primary  analysis  in  study 
E2100)  allows  for  an  assessment  of  the  treatment  benefit  that  is  not  confounded  by  the  effect  of 
additional cancer treatments started prior to disease progression. In addition, ‘worst case’ analyses (to 
investigate the effect of incomplete follow-up information; to investigate the effect of missing tumour 
assessments)  were  performed  to  assess  the  consistency  of  the  results  and  the  impact  of  different 
censoring rules on the analysis of PFS. All key analyses of PFS were performed in an unstratified and 
a stratified manner, with the stratification factors used for randomization. A stratified analysis gives a 
more  accurate  estimate  of  the  treatment  effect  if  the  prognostic  factors  are  truly  prognostic,  as 
variability between patients is reduced in this type of analysis.

Primary Endpoint  - Progression-Free Survival 
Updated  results  as  of  15  September  2008  have  been  presented.  They  show  a  somewhat  larger  and 
more sustained effect on PFS of the higher dose of bevacizumab, with a median prolongation of PFS 
of nearly 2 months, which is due to the fact that the two curves no longer accidentally come very close 
to each other at the median survival. It is reassuring that the difference seems to be sustained between 
12 and 24 months, but the actual difference in PFS is still a maximum of about two months. 
The  applicant  has  elected  to  present  only  data  for  the  higher  dose  of  bevacizumab,  since  this  is  the 
dose being carried forward as the recommended dose. This is reasonable since the higher dose seems 
to consistently give better results. The PFS curves for placebo vs. the higher dose of bevacizumab are 
seen  below,  demonstrating  the  fact  stated  above  that  the  maximum  difference  is  still  about  two 
months.

(ITT Population – Updated Unstratified Analysis) 
Secondary Endpoints 
Best Overall Response and Duration of Response 
In  patients  with  measurable  disease,  both  Bv  +  Doc  arms  showed  a  higher  OR  (CR  +  PR)  rate 
compared with Pl + Doc (55,2% in Bv 7.5 + Doc and 64,1% in Bv 15 + Doc vs 45,9% in Pl + Doc). 
The  absolute  difference  in  OR  rates  between  each  of  the  Bv  +  Doc  arms  compared  with  Pl  +  Doc 
(9.1%  and  18.2%,  respectively)  was  statistically  significant.  However,  virtually  all  responses  were 
only partial. This was partly correlated with a higher percentage of progressive disease in the control 
arm,  but  also  with  a  higher  percentage  of  stable  disease.  The  overall  benefit  of  the  higher  partial 
response rate in this scenario must be regarded as very modest.  
The  median duration of response was  slightly longer  in the Bv + Doc arms compared with the Pl + 
Doc arm (8.5 months in Bv 7.5 + Doc and 8.5 months in Bv 15 + Doc vs 6.9 months in Pl + Doc). The 
difference in duration of response is even smaller than the difference in PFS. 
Overall Survival 
The initial data package contained immature overall survival data, and more overall survival data was 
asked for continuously in the 1st and 2nd assessment. The trial was not powered for OS, nevertheless, a 
more  mature  analysis  of  OS  will  be  performed  when  all  patients  enrolled  in  the  study  have  been 
followed for a minimum of 24 months.

Below  is  shown  the  updated  survival  curves  as  of  September  2008,  demonstrating  no  significant 
difference  between  the  placebo  arm  and  the  higher  dose  bevacizumab  arm.  At  about  18  months  the 
curves converge and they cross over at 24 months. It is clear, as the applicant states, that there is a lot 
of censoring after 18 months, and it is true, as the applicant states, that at this point the curves become 
fairly  unreliable.  However,  it  is  a  cause  for  concern  that  the  trend  goes  in  that  direction,  and  more 
certain data on overall survival in the second year after treatment will be important before deciding if 
this treatment is safe.

The applicant argues strongly in the response to the previous questions that the survival curves should 
only  be  analysed  up  to  about  15  months.  A  summary of  the  results  up  to  that  point  is  shown  in  the 
table below.

## including censored observations 
The  applicant  goes  on  to  present  overall  survival  analyses  on  subgroups  of  patients,  depending  on 
whether or not they got post-study bevacizumab. These analyses all point in a better direction than the 
overall  analysis  presented  above,  but  these  analyses  must  be  regarded  with  scepticism  as  they 
represent non-planned subgroup analyses.  
Time to Treatment Failure 
In the previous submissions the data showed that more patients in the Pl + Doc arm (78%) experienced 
treatment  failure  than  in  either  of  the  Bv  +  Doc  arms  (75%).  Updated  analysis  shows  that  time  to 
treatment  failure  in  the  Bv  15  +  Doc  arm  was  statistically  significantly  longer  than  in  the  Pl  +  Doc 
arm. In the Bv 7.5 + Doc arm the difference was not statistically significant (0.86).

Median time to treatment failure was 6.3 months in the Pl + Doc arm and 7.7 and 7.9 months in the Bv 
7.5 + Doc and Bv 15 + Doc arms, respectively. The modest difference in TTF is similar to the modest 
difference in PFS. In the updated analysis the difference with regard to TTF is still modest, although 
the difference in PFS has become somewhat larger.

(ITT Analysis Population) 
Quality of Life 
The addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel did not lead to an overall deterioration in the mean quality 
of life scores (total FACT-B and FACT-G scores) compared to the addition of placebo to docetaxel. 
Where improvements from screening in mean quality of life scores were seen in the Bv + Doc arms, 
this was mainly driven by an improvement in emotional well-being. For the FACT-B score, which is 
specific for breast cancer, improvements were generally seen in both Bv + Doc arms compared with 
the Pl + Doc arm at all time points after screening, and were particularly noticeable at cycle 11. The 
additional toxicity of combining bevacizumab with docetaxel did not appear to impact negatively on 
patients’ quality of life. However, the differences reported in the QoL scores are small, and results are 
conflicting. It is stated by the applicant that the addition of bevacizumab does not lead to an overall 
deterioration  in  QoL  scores,  which  is  in  accordance  with  the  findings  in  many  other  studies  of  this 
kind.  QoL  scores  are  notoriously  insensitive,  so  the  information  value  from  this  analysis  is  limited. 
Further analyses of the QoL data did not reveal any difference between the treatment groups. 
Efficacy in Subgroups 
The results of each of the subgroup analyses for PFS were generally consistent with those seen for all 
patients,  indicating  that  the  results  of  this  trial  are  robust  and  not  driven  by  a  particular  subgroup. 
These  analyses  do  not  give  cause  for  suspicion  that  there  were  any  subgroups  with  a  qualitatively 
different  effect  of  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  docetaxel.  However,  because  of  the  very  modest 
overall  effect  on  PFS  the  confidence  intervals  for  most  subgroups  cross  the  equivalence  line, 
especially for the lower dose of bevacizumab. 
Analysis of Clinical Information Relevant to the Dosing Recommendations 
Doses of bevacizumab of 7.5 mg/kg and 15 mg/kg given every three weeks in combination with 100 
mg/m2  docetaxel  as  first-line  treatment  for  locally  recurrent  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  in  study 
BO17708, both doses in the original analyses showed a statistically significant reduction in the risk of 
progression or death by 21% and 28%, respectively, compared with the control arm of placebo plus 
docetaxel.  Although  the  risk  reduction  seen  with  the  higher  dose  of  bevacizumab  was  numerically 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
greater  than  that  seen  with  the  lower  dose,  an  exploratory  comparison  did  not  reveal  a  statistically 
significant difference in PFS between the two bevacizumab doses. 
However,  while  both  doses  of  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  docetaxel  were  efficacious  in  this 
trial  and  showed  increases  in  PFS  which  were  statistically  significant  compared  to  the  control,  the 
higher dose of  bevacizumab  (15  mg/kg  q3w  -  5mg/kg/wk  weekly  equivalent)  consistently showed  a 
numerical  advantage  across  a  range  of  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  compared  to  the  lower  dose  of 
bevacizumab  (7.5  mg/kg  q3w  -  2.5  mg/kg/wk  equivalent).  In  addition  in  the  updated  analysis,  the 
lower dose; 7.5 mg/kg was not superior to control for PFS, OR rate and 1-year survival.  It must be 
stressed that the BO17708 study was not dimensioned to show any difference between the two doses. 
The  evidence  presented  points  in  the  direction  of  a  larger  effect  of  the  15  mg/kg  dose,  but  no 
significant difference between the two dose levels has been documented. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
There are no clinical studies in special populations presented. 
Efficacy Results across Studies 
In the previous submissions key efficacy results from the current study of bevacizumab in combination 
with docetaxel (BO17708) and the previously submitted study with bevacizumab in combination with 
paclitaxel (E2100) were presented. Both studies showed a statistically significant improvement in the 
primary  endpoint  of  PFS.  The  main  statistical  analyses  of  PFS  were  slightly  different  in  the  two 
studies.

In  study  BO17708,  an  unstratified  analysis  was  performed  and  included  all  progression  and  death 
events that occurred up to the clinical cut-off date. In study E2100, a stratified analysis was performed 
and included only progression events that occurred  prior to start of non-protocol therapy and deaths 
only if they occurred up to 84 days after last dose of study treatment. When an analysis similar to the 
primary  analysis  as  used  in  study  E2100  was  performed  on  data  from  study  BO17708,  the  risk  of 
progression or death was further reduced to 31% (HR 0.69) and 39% (HR 0.61) in the Bv 7.5 +Doc 
and Bv 15 + Doc arms, respectively in the original analysis and 23% (HR 0.77) and 33% (HR 0.67) in 
the updated analysis.  
Supportive studies  
Efficacy data from two small phase II studies of bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel reported 
as full publications are presented:  
•  The Phase II trial (sponsored by the Cancer and Treatment Evaluation Program of the National 
Cancer Institute) of bevacizumab (10 mg/kg q2w) and docetaxel (35 mg/m2 qw) in 27 patients 
with mBC showed 52% of patients responding (all PR) for a median time of 6 months with 
median PFS of 7.5 months [Ramaswamy et al] 
•  The  pilot  study  of  bevacizumab  (15 mg/kg  q3w)  with  doxorubicin  (50 mg/m2  q3w)  and 
docetaxel  (75 mg/m2  q3w)  in  21  patients  with  inflammatory  and  locally  advanced  breast 
cancer showed 67% of patients responding (all PR) [Wedam et al]  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
These studies are uncontrolled and very small, and they do not add any significant information with 
regard to efficacy. 
1. 2. 5.  Clinical safety 
The  evaluation  of  safety  information  for  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  docetaxel  as  first-line 
treatment  for  patients  with  locally  recurrent  or  metastatic  breast  cancer  is  derived  from  the 
randomized,  double-blind,  placebo  controlled,  Phase  III  study,  BO17708.  Safety  was  assessed  by 
recording all adverse events (with intensity graded according to NCI-CTCAE version 3.0), including 
adverse events of special interest (attributed to bevacizumab or docetaxel treatment), serious adverse 
events, vital signs, electrocardiograms (ECGs), and safety laboratory tests. 
In  addition,  safety  information  from  two  publications  of  Phase  II  studies  is  included,  one  of 
bevacizumab  in  combination  with  docetaxel  in  metastatic  breast  cancer  patients,  another  of 
bevacizumab in combination with doxorubicin and docetaxel in patients with inflammatory and locally 
advanced breast cancer. 
Patient exposure 
In  study  BO17708,  497  patients  with  mBC  have  been  exposed  to  bevacizumab  either  at  7.5  or 
15 mg/kg q3w in combination with docetaxel. From the two full publications, an additional 27 patients 
with mBC have received bevacizumab 10 mg/kg q2w in combination with docetaxel; and 21 patients 
with  inflammatory  and  locally  advanced  breast  cancer  have  received  bevacizumab  15 mg/kg  q3w  in 
combination with  doxorubicin  and  docetaxel.  Thus, the  data  are  adequate  to  assess  the  safety  of  the 
combination of bevacizumab and docetaxel. Follow-up has been sufficiently long in the pivotal study 
to allow a reasonable assessment of safety of this combination in this indication. 
In  study  BO17708,  exposure  to  bevacizumab/placebo  and  docetaxel  based  on  dose  intensity  (actual 
dose received divided by planned dose) was high and similar across the treatment arms (96%-98%). 
The median duration of bevacizumab/placebo treatment was greater in the Bv 7.5 + Doc (218 days) 
and  Bv  15  +  Doc  (232  days)  arms  than  in  the  Pl  +  Doc  arm  (203  days).  The  median  duration  of 
docetaxel treatment was also longer in the Bv 7.5 + Doc (154 days) and Bv 15 + Doc (167 days) arms 
than in the Pl + Doc arm (148 days). 
In the publication by Ramaswamy et al, 48% of patients completed the planned six cycles (q2w). In 
the publication by Wedam et al, 76% of patients completed the planned seven cycles of therapy (q3w). 
The number of patients and data collected for safety evaluation are summarized in Table 3. The two 
small phase II trials contribute very little information. In effect, the BO17708 study is the only study 
contributing data on the safety of the combination of bevacizumab and docetaxel. 
Adverse Event Experience 
An overview of the adverse event experience reported in study BO17708 is shown in the table below. 
The tolerability profile of the combination of bevacizumab with docetaxel was not markedly different 
from that of placebo and docetaxel. An increase in overall Grade 3-5 toxicities was seen in the Bv + 
Doc  arms,  as  expected  from  the  addition  of  a  second  drug  agent;  however,  this  increase  did  not 
translate into a greater number of discontinuations from study treatment. The number of deaths due to 
progressive disease was lower in the Bv + Doc arms, especially in the Bv 15 + Doc arm (14% vs. 21% 
in  the  Pl  +  Doc  arm).  The  overall  incidence  of  adverse  events  of  special  interest  (all  grades)  was 
higher in the Bv +Doc arms, mainly driven by increases in bleeding (mainly epistaxis, all grades) and 
hypertension (all grades) in these arms. Despite the numerically higher incidence of all grade epistaxis, 
hypertension, febrile neutropenia, and proteinuria in the Bv 15 + Doc arm compared with the Bv 7.5 + 
Doc  arm,  there  was  no  clinically  meaningful  difference  in  the  safety  profile  between  the  two 
bevacizumab-containing arms.

In study BO17708, virtually all patients experienced at least one adverse event of any grade between 
the time of first drug administration and 21 days after the last drug administration; (232 [99.6%] in the 
Pl + Doc arm, 250 [100%] in the Bv 7.5 + Doc arm and 246 [99.6%] in the Bv 15 + Doc arm). 
The conclusion of the analyses of adverse events of all grades was: 
•  Bevacizumab did not have a major impact on the safety profile of docetaxel 
•  The safety profile of the combination docetaxel plus bevacizumab was as predicted based on 
the known toxicities of the two agents administered separately 
•  Adding bevacizumab to docetaxel as first-line therapy resulted in no unexpected toxicities 
•  Adding bevacizumab to docetaxel did not increase the rate of withdrawals from treatment due 
to toxicity 
•  Deaths were mainly due to progressive disease 
•  Treatment-related deaths were uncommon in all three treatment arms 
Grade 3-5 Adverse Events 
More patients in the Bv + Doc arms (74% and 75%) than in the Pl + Doc arm (67%) reported Grade 3-
5  adverse  evens  (table  2  just  above  +  table  3  below),  the  most  common  of  which  were  established 
docetaxel  toxicities.  The  most  frequently  reported  Grade  3-5  adverse  events  that  occurred  with  a 
higher incidence in either of the Bv + Doc arms compared with the Pl + Doc arm were neutropenia 
and febrile neutropenia (table 3). Other events that occurred more frequently (≥ 2%) in either of the Bv 
+  Doc  arms  compared  with  the  Pl  +  Doc  arm  were  fatigue,  mucosal  inflammation,  palmar-plantar 
erythrodysesthesia  syndrome,  diarrhoea,  stomatitis,  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy,  skin  exfoliation 
and myalgia (table 3).

___________________________________________________________________________________ 
Percentages are based on N. 
Multiple occurrences of the same adverse event in one individual counted only once. 
Deaths not due to Progressive Disease 
The majority of deaths during the study were directly attributed to progressive disease (table 2 above). 
Deaths not due to progressive disease were infrequent and occurred with a similar incidence across the 
treatment arms (6/233 [2.6%] in Pl + Doc, 9/250 [3.6%] in Bv 7.5 + Doc, 5/247 [2.0%] in Bv 15 + 
Doc  arms).  No  particular  pattern  or  cluster  of  adverse  events  could  be  identified  that  led  to  these 
deaths and most deaths were due to single causes; two patients each died due to febrile neutropenia, 
respiratory failure, and septic shock. There was only one death due to gastrointestinal perforation. 
Other Serious Adverse Events 
More patients in the Bv + Doc arms (37% and 42%) had serious adverse events compared with those 
in the Pl + Doc arm (33%), the difference being mainly due to a higher incidence of events considered 
to be primarily docetaxel related in these arms (table 2). The individual events with the most notable 
increase in incidence in the Bv + Doc arms included febrile neutropenia (11.6% in Bv 7.5 + Doc and 
14.6% in Bv 15 + Doc vs 9.4% in Pl + Doc), neutropenia (4.8% and 6.5% vs. 2.1%, respectively), and 
asthenia (2.0% and 1.2% vs 0%, respectively). Conversely, there were more cases of serious infection 
in the Pl + Doc arm (2.6%) compared with the Bv + Doc arms (0.8% and 0.4%) 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
As expected, more patients treated with either dose of bevacizumab experienced one or more adverse 
events of special interest (all grades) (75% in Bv 7.5 + Doc and 78% in Bv 15 + Doc vs 60% in Pl + 
Doc) (table 2). This was mainly due to more patients in these two arms experiencing bleeding events, 
in particular mucocutaneous bleeding (epistaxis), and hypertension. 
13 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall,  Grade  3-5  adverse  events  of  special  interest  were  more  common  in  the  Bv  +  Doc  arms 
compared  with  Pl  +  Doc  (table  4).  Of  these  events,  only  neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia,  and 
hypertension were more frequent in at least one of the Bv + Doc arms compared with the Pl + Doc 
arm.  There were no differences in the incidence of Grade 3-5 events between the two bevacizumab-
containing  arms,  except  for  hypertension  which  was  increased  in  the  Bv 15 +  Doc  arm.  Grade  3-5 
thromboembolic events occurred more frequently in the Pl + Doc arm than in either of the two Bv + 
Doc arms.

Laboratory Parameters 
No new safety signals associated with bevacizumab treatment were identified from the laboratory test 
results  in  study  BO17708.  Most  of  the  post-baseline  abnormalities  for  laboratory  parameters  were 
Grade 1-2. As expected from the adverse events reported in the study, the only remarkable laboratory 
abnormality  was  Grade  3-4  low  neutrophil  count,  reported  with  a  similar  frequency  across  the 
treatment arms. 
Vital Signs 
Mean diastolic blood pressure values did not change markedly from baseline in patients in Pl + Doc 
and Bv 7.5 + Doc arms.  A slight decrease in  mean systolic blood pressure was reported in the Pl + 
Doc arm (- 4 mmHg), and slight increases in both mean systolic (+ 4 mmHg) and mean diastolic (+ 4 
mmHg) blood pressure were seen in the Bv 15 + Doc arm.  
No clinically relevant changes from pre-treatment baseline values were observed in any treatment arm 
for body temperature, pulse, weight or ECG parameters. 
The  analyses  of  laboratory  findings  and  vital  signs  did  not  show  any  unexpected  safety  signals  in 
patients treated with bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel. The treatment is associated with a 
known degree of toxicity which is to a large extent manageable. With the measures available it would 
not seem to have and adverse effect of the QoL of patients compared to patients treated with docetaxel 
alone, but it does not seem to improve QoL either.

Safety in special populations 
No new information on safety of bevacizumab in special populations was presented. Considering the 
large amount of data available on bevacizumab for other indications this is acceptable. 
Immunological events 
No  information  is  provided.  According  to  the  large  database  of  post-marketing  adverse  events, 
immune  system  disorders  are  rare.  It  is  therefore  acceptable  that  immunological  events  were  not 
reported in the present application.

Risk Management Plan  
The applicant has submitted a Risk Management Plan in the initial application. The RMP Version 5.0 
is  written  in  accordance  with  the  current  guidelines,  and  replaces  RMP  Version  4.0  dated  16  July 
2007.  This  RMP  summarizes  the  important  identified  and  potential  risks  of  the  clinical  use  of 
bevacizumab  in  Genentech-  and  Roche-sponsored  studies  and  experience  from  the  post-marketing 
setting after initial approval in the US (26 February 2004) and the EU (12 January 2005).  
No  new  safety  concerns  specific  for  the  applied  combination  (Avastin  in  combination  with  taxane-
based  chemotherapy)  have  been  identified.  However,  the  RMP  has  been  updated  with  safety 
information  for  bevacizumab  in  general,  with  pulmonary  hypertension  and  microangiopathic 
haemolytic anaemia (MAHA) as newly identified safety concerns. Long-term effects of bevacizumab 
when used in the paediatric population are also included as missing information.  
The  RMP  has  been  updated  with  new  information  from  study  BO17708,  and  additional  updates 
include these major changes: 
• 
Implement recommendations of the PDCO during their review of the paediatric investigation 
plan 
•  A report on CNS metastases 
•  Availability  of  new  drug  safety  reports  on  cardiac  arrhythmia,  intravitreal  use,  renal  failure 
and proteinuria, MAHA, termination of BO17934 (AVASQ). 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall position is that the RMP is considered adequate provided some issues are further discussed 
and updated. A RMP rev. 6.0 is currently ongoing for evaluation in variation II/28. 
Annex II of the product information has been updated to reflect the new version number of 5.0.

Discussion 
In  general,  the  patient  population  in  this  study  was  similar  to  that  enrolled  in  study  E2100 
(bevacizumab and paclitaxel); the only slight differences in the inclusion / exclusion criteria between 
the  two  studies  were  the  time  allowed  since  completion  of  last  previous  neo-adjuvant / adjuvant 
chemotherapy  prior  to  randomization  (6  months  in  study  BO17708  vs.  3  weeks  in  study  E2100),  in 
liver function tests (within normal ranges in study BO17708 vs. up to 1.5 x ULN in study E2100), and 
in  levels  of  haemoglobin  (lower  limit  of  9 g/dL  in  study  BO17708  whereas  severe  anaemic  patients 
were allowed in E2100). Although HER2-positive patients were allowed to enter study E2100 if they 
had  failed  trastuzumab,  these  were  excluded  from  study  BO17708.  However,  those  patients  only 
comprised 2.2 % of patients in E2100, so the populations of the two studies would seem to be largely 
comparable.  
As is evident from the results with regard to the primary endpoint PFS there are marked differences in 
the results of the two studies, even when they are analysed in exactly the same  manner. The hazard 
ratio  in  the  E2100  study  is  significantly  lower  than  the  hazard  ratio  in  the  BO17708  study,  and  the 
difference in median PFS is markedly larger in the E2100 study. One cannot help suspecting that the 
lack  of  blinding  in  the  E2100  study  may  have  resulted  in  bias  and  a  spuriously  large  difference  in 
favour  of  the  bevacizumab  arm  of  the  study.  However,  some  of  the  differences  between  the  E2100 
study and the BO17708 study may be attributed to docetaxel being more active than paclitaxel, and to 
docetaxel having in itself more powerful antiangiogenic properties than paclitaxel. Thus, the effect of 
bevacizumab in patients treated with docetaxel may be more modest that than in patients treated with 
paclitaxel.  
More patients were withdrawn from placebo/bevacizumab in the Pl + Doc arm (76%) than in the Bv 
7.5  +  Doc  and  Bv  15  +  Doc  arms  (71%  and  70%,  respectively).  This  was  mainly  due  to  a  greater 
number of patients in the Pl + Doc arm being withdrawn because of insufficient therapeutic response. 
Similarly, more patients in the Pl + Doc arm (55%) than in the Bv 7.5 + Doc and Bv 15 + Doc arms 
(53%  and  48%,  respectively)  were  withdrawn  from  docetaxel  treatment,  mainly  due  to  insufficient 
therapeutic response. About 20 % of patients in all three arms stopped treatment prematurely due to 
violation of selection criteria at entry, adverse events, withdrawal of consent, or administrative/other 
reasons.  This  is  a  fairly  high  percentage,  although  it  seems  to  be  equally  distributed  between  the 
treatment arms. About 50 % of patients were withdrawn from treatment before completion because of 
insufficient  therapeutic  response.  These  50%  of  patients  were  considered  as  treatment  failures.  This 
again is a high percentage. All patients are sufficiently accounted for. 
PFS was the primary endpoint in trial BO17708, the study was not powered for overall survival. The 
focus of the discussion will be on the bevacizumab 15 mg/kg q3w does which was consistently 
associated with better primary and secondary efficacy outcomes with similar safety compared to the 
7.5 mg/kg q3w. This is in line with the posology approved for the treatment of first line metastatic 
breast cancer in combination with paclitaxel. 
In the updated analysis (cut-off September 2008) a statistically significant improvement of two months 
in PFS is observed. The major concern of the CHMP was lack of evidence to prove that the 
prolongation in PFS with the addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel for the first-line treatment of 
patients with metastatic and/or locally recurrent breast cancer is of significant clinical benefit for the 
patients as it was not unambiguously supported by OS data. The CHMP recommended that the above 
question should be discussed at a SAG-oncology meeting. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
3. 1 SAG-Oncology meeting on 7 May 2009 
CHMP  question:  Does  the  SAG  believe  that  the  modest  prolongation  in  PFS  in  the  absence  of  any 
trend for Overall Survival improvement observed with the addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel for 
the  first-line  treatment  of  patients  with  metastatic  and/or  locally  recurrent  breast  cancer  is  of 
significant clinical benefit for the patients? 
The  SAG  agreed  that  the  effect  observed  in  terms  of  PFS  could  be  considered  to  be  clinically 
significant, provided that sufficient supportive data are available from important secondary endpoints, 
particularly  overall  survival.  The  SAG  had  different  views  as  to  whether  the  supportive  data  were 
sufficient or not.  
1.  According to some experts, it is important to weigh the urgency to license this indication, taking 
into account the availability of other agents and regimens, against ensuring that overall survival is 
ultimately not compromised. The overall survival analyses presented were based on less than 40% 
of the events. The data were too immature to rule out an important detriment in overall survival 
with  adequate  power.  Although  the  hazard  ratio  was  close  to  1,  a  high  number  of  censored 
observations  and  possibly  crossing  hazards  towards  the  end  of  the  observation  period  raised 
concerns. In conclusion, more mature overall survival data (for example with 50% or more events 
and  adequate  duration  of  follow-up)  must  be  available  before  granting  the  extension  of  the 
indication to this combination. 
2.  According to an opposing view, although acknowledging that the data were immature, the overall 
survival did not pose particular concerns. The objective response rate was considered to be very 
high  reflecting  a  high  level  of  antitumour  activity.  Although  it  was  difficult  to  conclude  on  the 
results about quality of life due to the missing data, there were no signs that the combination was 
associated with important worsening in quality of life. According to this view, the available data 
were  considered  sufficient  to  support  the  extension  of  the  indication  provided  that  more  mature 
data for overall survival would be submitted as follow-up measure. 
The SAG discussed the design and results of the trial in terms of dose selection. The rationale for a 
three-arm trial with two doses of bevacizumab remains unclear. Apart from visual exploration, there is 
no conclusive evidence of a difference between the two doses in terms of important clinical endpoints. 
Thus, discarding the lower dose based on the available data does not seem justified. 
The  holder  of  the  marketing  authorisation  indicated  that  there  are  a  number  of  biomarker  analyses, 
including  genotyping  that  are  to  be  conducted  in  the  near  future.  The  SAG  commented  that  such 
analyses  are  valuable  and the  results  of  these  analyses  should be submitted  and  assessed  in  order  to 
better define the target population in the approved indications. 
The SAG discussed the apparent differences observed  with paclitaxel and docetaxel, in combination 
with  bevacizumab.  It  has  been  reported  that  different  cytotoxic  agents  may  interact  differently  with 
antiangiogenic drugs (Shaked et al., 2008). The proposed indication that is currently for combination 
with taxanes should be limited reflect the taxanes actually studied because the results observed with 
one taxane cannot be easily extrapolated to other agents in this class.  
3. 2.   CHMP discussion and Oral Explanation 
The Oral Explanation with the MAH focused on the following issues: 
1) 
Is the modest PFS prolongation observed in Study BO17708 of clinical relevance to patients? 
Following the unanimous agreement at the SAG meeting and extensive discussion among the CHMP, 
the effect observed in terms of PFS could be considered to be clinically significant.  
2)  The OS Kaplan Meier plot: the curves seem to cross at 24 months which remains a concern. 
A possible detrimental effect of bevacizumab can not be excluded. Please give your view and 
elaborate. 
It can be agreed that no dentrimental effect on overall survival is suspected, based on HR of 0.94. The 
1-year survival is slightly superior in the bevacizumab arm and for the first 15 months (the time period 
when data can be considered robust) the HR for survival is 0.75. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
     The overall survival analyses are and will always be confounded by the following factors: 
patients are receiving bevacizumab additionally in the second line setting 
- 
-  placebo patients crossing over to bevacizumab before disease progression (allowed after the 
primary study results were made public) 
-  use of subsequent lines of therapy at discretion of investigator and uncontrolled by protocol 
These issues validate the choice of PFS as primary endpoint in this study. 
3)  Preclinical data published earlier this year, although on other classes of antiangiogenetic 
treatment, indicate that long term treatment with inhibitors of the angiogenesis may in fact 
stimulate tumour growth. The CHMP would therefore like to have more information on the 
proportion of patients that progressed due to progression of the primary tumour versus 
progression due to new metastases and time to new lesions in the different treatment arms. 
Two publications, Paez-Ribez et al. and Ebos et al. report in Cancer Cell that experimental models 
of transgenic or immunosuppressed mice transplanted with various tumour cell lines demonstrate 
increased invasiveness and metastatic spread when exposed to anti-angiogenic therapy with a 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor, sunitinib or VEGF receptor antibody. The studies were carried out using 
single agent treatment. In study BO17708 there were fewer patients with disease progression due 
to new lesions in the bevacizumab arms. There has been no evidence of accelerated progression or 
excess mortality following bevacizumab discontinuation as demonstrated in clinical data from 5 
placebo controlled phase III trials comprising more than 4200 patients. 
Following this discussion the CHMP requested the MAH to provide updated survival results since 
the latest cut-off (September 2008 – April 2009) without censoring for cross-over  
3. 3.  Updated Survival results 
The trial was not powered for OS, but a more mature analysis of OS was pre-planned when all patients 
enrolled in the study had been followed for at minimum of 24 months. 
At the time of the data cut-off in April 2009, 342 patients (46.5%) had died:  
108 (44.8%) in the placebo+doxetaxel arm,  
118 (47.6%) in the Bv7.5+docetaxel arm and  
116 (47.0%) in the Bv15+docetaxel arm, respectively. 
The median OS is now >30 months in every treatment group, but the estimates are still unreliable due 
to a lot of censoring after month 24. 
In the unstratified analysis, the HR was: 
1.03 (95% CI: 0.79; 1.33) in the bv15-docetaxel group compared to placebo-docetaxel  
 1.05 (95% CI: 0.81; 1.36) in the bv7.5-docetaxel group compared to placebo-docetaxel. 
In a stratified analysis (by region, prior adjuvant/neo-adjuvant taxane/time to relapse since last dose of 
adjuvant/ neo-adjuvant chemotherapy, measurable disease, hormone receptor status), the HR was: 
1.00 (95% CI: 0.76; 1.32) in the bv15-docetaxel group compared to placebo-docetaxel  
1.10 (95% CI: 0.84; 1.45) in the bv7.5-docetaxel group compared to placebo-docetaxel. 
The results indicate that there’s no significant difference in OS between the treatment groups.  
In  the  updated  analysis,  the  available  results  are  reliable  and  mature  for  the  time  period  up  to  24 
months. At the time of the data cut-off in April 2009, 342 patients (46.5%) had died.  
The  Kaplan  Meier  curves  now  seem  to  meet  around  22-24  months  after  which  the  curves  are 
unreliable due to a large amount of censoring.   
No  significant  difference  in  OS  was  observed  between  the  high-dose  bevacizumab  arm  and  the 
placebo-arm (in both unstratified and stratified analyses), and specifically no detrimental effect on OS 
was noted after the addition of bevacizumab to docetaxel. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Presumably, it  will  be  impossible  to  demonstrate  a  potential  benefit  of  bevacizumab  in  combination 
with  docetaxel  on  OS  in  mBC  due  to  confounding  effect  of  cross-over  from  the  placebo  group  to 
bevacizumab  upon  progression  and  plus  the  availability  of  several  2nd  and  3rd  line  therapies.  (102 
patients in the placebo arm received bevacizumab post progression) 
4.  
Overall Conclusion and Benefit – Risk assessment  
The present application is for an extension of the previously approved indication for the combination 
of  bevacizumab  and  paclitaxel  to  an  indication  for  the  combination  of  bevacizumab  and  taxanes  in 
general. The present application must therefore be seen in the context of the evidence from both the 
previous and the present applications. As stated above, there are differences between the results of the 
pivotal study for the approved indication (E2100) and for the present application (BO17708). Some of 
the differences have been plausibly explained by differences in methodology and possible differences 
in the performance of the two taxanes. The consultation with the SAG-O revealed that docetaxel and 
paclitaxel  are  considered  to  behave  differently  and  they  are  not  “inter-changeable”:  The  synergy  is 
probably  largest  with  the  combination  of  paclitaxel  and  bevacizumab,  whereas  docetaxel  is  more 
active than paclitaxel as single-agent. It should be up to the treating physician to choose which taxane 
to  use  according  to  knowledge  of  previous  therapies,  the  related  toxicities  and  the  most  optimal 
schedule for the patient.  
Benefits 
The primary endpoint was PFS. Regarding PFS there are some data that could affect the interpretation 
of  the  results:  Only  80  %  of  the  patients  had  measurable  disease,  the  study  was  blinded  but  the 
investigators  had  knowledge  on  the  doses  which  maybe  could  lead  to  bias.  Furthermore,  after  the 
study  became  public,  patients  in  the  placebo  arm  were  given  the  opportunity  to  cross  over  to 
bevacizumab. 
The  pivotal  study  BO17708  showed  a  statistically  significant  advantage  for  the  combination  of 
bevacizumab  (at  both  dose  levels)  and  docetaxel  with  regard  to  PFS.  With  the  updated  analyses 
presented, the difference was modest, with a median prolongation of PFS of 2 months for the patients 
in  the  high  dose  bevacizumab  arm  compared  to  the  control  arm.  With  the  updated  analyses,  the 
improvement in PFS was seen at a follow-up for up to 18 months. This increased improvement in PFS 
with the updated analyses can be regarded as clinically relevant.  
The  benefits  in  terms  of  secondary  endpoints  were  as  follows:  The  OR  was  64%  in  the  high-dose 
bevacizumab  arm  compared  to  46%  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  median  duration  of  response  was  only 
slightly longer in the high-dose bevacizumab arm (8.5 months) than in the placebo arm (6.9 months). 
A modest difference in Time to Treatment Failure (7.9 months versus 6.3 months) was noted.  
No  significant  difference  in  OS  was  found.  In  the  updated  analysis  as  of  June  2009,  the  available 
results are reliable and mature for the time period up to 24 months. At the time of the data cut-off in 
April 2009, 342 patients (46.5%) had died. The Kaplan Meier curves now seem to meet around 22-24 
months  after  which  the  curves  are  unreliable  due  to  a  large  amount  of  censoring.  No  significant 
difference in OS was observed between the high-dose bevacizumab arm and the placebo-arm (in both 
unstratified and stratified analyses), and no detrimental effect on OS was noted after the addition of 
bevacizumab  to  docetaxel.  But  taking  into  consideration  the  cross  over  from  the  placebo  group  to 
bevacizumab  upon  progression  +  the  availability  of  other  2nd  and  3rd  line  therapies  demonstrating  a 
benefit in overall survival is no expected.    
The SAG-O considered a median increase in PFS of 2 months to be of clinical benefit to the patients, 
but  concern  over  the  (immature)  OS  data  were  raised  as  the  tail  of  the  survival  curves  is  still 
unreliable. All members of the SAG-O considered more follow-up regarding OS necessary. 
QoL data are presented, but the only conclusion drawn is that the addition of bevacizumab does not 
lead  to  an  overall  deterioration  in  QoL  scores.  QoL  scores  are  notoriously  insensitive,  so  the 
information value from this analysis is limited.

Risks 
The presented safety profile of the combination of docetaxel and bevacizumab does not add any new 
or unexpected toxicities. The AEs encountered with the combination are as would be expected from 
the  present  knowledge  of  the  safety  profile  of  the  two  drugs.  Neutropenia,  febrile  neutropenia, 
hypertension, proteinuria, haemorrhage, congestive  heart failure, gastrointestinal perforation, abscess 
and fistula, and wound healing problems are seen at an increased rate or severity with the combination. 
The individual incidence rates of these complications are not high and the incidence of grade 3-5 AEs 
for proteinuria, haemorrhage, congestive heart failure, gastrointestinal perforation, abscess and fistula 
and  wound-healing  complication,  arterial  or  venous  thromboembolic  events  are  similar  (defined  as 
less  than  1%  difference  or  more  frequent  in  the  control  arm)  between  bevacizumab  15 mg  and  the 
control arm. Nevertheless, they are significant, causing morbidity and serious risks, even of death.  
Balance 
The  benefit  of  adding  the  high  dose  bevacizumab  to  docetaxel  in  patients  with  metastatic  and/or 
locally  recurrent  breast  cancer  is  very  modest,  amounting  to  a  median  prolongation  of  PFS  of  2 
months and with no effect on overall survival so far. Overall, PFS is considered a valid endpoint, and 
it is acknowledged that it is difficult to show an effect on OS at this stage as several 2nd and 3rd line 
therapies  are  available.  However,  it  has  been  established  that  the  proposed  therapy  does  not  have  a 
harmful effect on OS. Taking into account that no patients with metastatic breast cancer are cured with 
the present treatment, an improvement in PFS but no difference in OS may be attractive if the quality 
of life is taken into consideration so that it outweighs the increased risk of adverse events. The quality 
of life data presented shows no deterioration in QoL. 
As docetaxel and paclitaxel behave differently they are not considered “inter-changeable”. It is up to 
the treating physician to choose which taxane to use according to knowledge of previous therapies, the 
related  toxicities  and  the  most  optimal  schedule  for  the  patient.  Thus  the  proposed  indication  is 
restricted to paclitaxel or docetaxel specifically, instead of “taxane-based therapy” in general.  
The increase in the incidence of adverse events with the combination compared to docetaxel alone is 
as expected from previous studies with other combinations of bevacizumab and cytotoxic drugs. The 
increase  is  fairly  moderate,  but  nevertheless  significant,  causing  morbidity  and,  in  rare  cases,  even 
death. 
HER2 status is not expected to impact the response of patients to bevacizumab treatment; therefore, 
the proposed indication is not restricted to HER2-negative patients only.  
The overall B/R of bevacizumab in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of metastatic breast 
cancer is positive given that a clinical significant benefit in PFS has been observed and an acceptable 
safety  profile  was  seen  in  these  patients  with  incurable  disease  and  consequentially  this  variation  is 
recommended by a majority vote for a positive opinion for the following indication; 
Avastin in combination with paclitaxel or docetaxel is indicated for first-line treatment of 
patients with metastatic breast cancer. For further information as to HER2 status, please 
refer to section 5.1. 
The  full  and  final  OS  data  should  be  submitted  post  authorisation  (expected  to  be  available  in  Q4 
2009)  
Divergent opinions expressed by some CHMP members supported that: 
• 
In study BO17708 Avastin in combination with docetaxel was compared with docetaxel plus 
placebo, as first-line treatment for patients with HER2-negative metastatic or locally recurrent 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
breast cancer who have not received prior chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. The 
estimated increase in median progression free survival of only 2 months when adding Avastin 
15 mg/kg to docetaxel is considered to be of marginal clinical relevance. 
•  The marginal increase in progression free survival is not supported by any increase in overall 
survival.  
• 
In light of the adverse events related to combination treatment a median increase in PFS alone 
of 2 months or less, without support from overall survival data, is seen as insufficient. 
II.  CONCLUSION 
On  25  June  2009  the  CHMP  considered  this  Type  II  variation  to  be  acceptable  and  agreed  on  the 
amendments  to  be  introduced  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics,  Annex  II  and  Package 
Leaflet.

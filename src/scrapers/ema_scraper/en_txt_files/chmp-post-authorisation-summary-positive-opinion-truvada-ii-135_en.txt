Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Truvada 
emtricitabine / tenofovir disoproxil 
On 14 December 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Truvada. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences International 
Limited. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to an existing indication as follows2: 
“Treatment of HIV-1 infection: 
Truvada is indicated in antiretroviral combination therapy for the treatment of HIV-1 infected 
adults (see section 5.1). 
Truvada is also indicated for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adolescents, with NRTI resistance or 
toxicities precluding the use of first line agents, aged 12 to < 18 years (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 
5.1). 
Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP): 
Truvada is indicated in combination with safer sex practices for pre-exposure prophylaxis to 
reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 infection in adults and adolescents at high risk (see 
sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

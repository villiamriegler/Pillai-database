and patients with moderate to severe cognitive impairment 
were excluded. A total of 350 patients were randomized

lixisenatide). Overall, 37% of the patients were ≥75 years

31% had moderate renal impairment (N=107). Patients 
received stable dose(s) of oral antidiabetic drug(s) (OAD) 
and/or basal insulin as background therapy. Sulfonylureas 
or glinides were not used with basal insulin as background 
therapy. 
Lixisenatide provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-
0.64% change compared to placebo; 95% CI: -0.810% to -
0.464%; p<0.0001), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.0%. 
In addition, a double-blind, placebo-controlled 
cardiovascular outcome study (ELIXA) enrolled 6,068 type 
2 diabetes patients with previous acute coronary syndrome 
(3,034 randomised to lixisenatide, including 198 patients 
≥75 years of age and 655 patients with moderate renal 
impairment).  
Data from the GetGoal-O and ELIXA study indicate that the 
risks associated with lixisenatide treatment in the geriatric 
population (including patients>75 years) and the 
population with moderately increased renal function are not 
considerably increased compared with the risk associated 
with this treatment in the overall diabetic population.

was 22.4 months in the lixisenatide group and 23.3 months 
in the placebo group, and the median duration of study 
follow-up was 25.8 and 25.7 months, respectively. Mean 
HbA1c (±SD) in the lixisenatide and placebo groups was

As a whole, the ELIXA study seems well conducted and the 
main goal of Study EFC11319, to exclude that lixisenatide 
treatment confers an unacceptable increase (>30%) in 
cardiovascular risk, was achieved. Moreover, no other 
unexpected safety issues emerged from this study.

lixisenatide in comparison to that of insulin glulisine 
once daily and insulin glulisine three times daily in

data derives from study EFC12626, object of MEA

label randomised study for insulin intensification. After 12-
week of optimal insulin glargine titration with or without 
metformin, inadequately controlled patients were 
randomised to add single dose of lixisenatide or a single 
dose (QD) of insulin glulisine (both before the largest meal) 
or insulin glulisine administered three times a day (TID) for 
26 weeks. The level of HbA1c reduction was comparable 
between groups. As opposed to both insulin glulisine 
treatment regimens, lixisenatide reduced body weight. The 
rate of symptomatic hypoglycaemic events was lower with 
lixisenatide (36%) compared to insulin glulisine QD and TID 
(47% and 52%, respectively).

before the main meal of the day was non inferior to 
lixisenatide administered before breakfast in terms of 
HbA1c reduction (LS mean change from baseline: -0.65% 
versus -0.74%). Similar HbA1c decreases were observed 
regardless of which meal was the main meal (breakfast, 
lunch or dinner). At the end of the study, 43.6% (main 
meal group) and 42.8% (breakfast group) of patients 
achieved an HbA1c less than 7%. Nausea was reported in 
14.7% and 15.5% of patients, and symptomatic 
hypoglycaemia in 5.8% and 2.2% of patients, main meal 
group and breakfast group, respectively. 
Therefore, the product information has been revised to 
reflect that Lyxumia can be administered once daily, within 
the hour prior to ANY meal of the day. It is preferable that 
the prandial injection of Lyxumia is performed before the 
same meal every day, when the most convenient meal has 
been chosen. If a dose of Lyxumia is missed, it should be 
injected within the hour prior to the next meal.

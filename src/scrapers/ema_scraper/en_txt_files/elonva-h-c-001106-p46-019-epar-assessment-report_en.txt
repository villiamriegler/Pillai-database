1.  Introduction 
On 30 October 2020, the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) submitted a completed paediatric 
study for corifollitropin alfa (Elonva, EMEA/H/C/001106), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation 
(EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Elonva has been approved in females, for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) by centralised 
procedure since 2010 (EMEA/H/C/001106). 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Study P043:MK8962,  
“A Phase III, Multi-Center, Open Label, Single-Group Trial to Investigate the Efficacy and Safety of MK-
8962 (corifollitropin alfa) in Combination with human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) for Initiation or 
Restoration of Puberty as Assessed by Increased Testicular Volume in Adolescent Males 14 to <18 
Years Old with Hypogonadotropic Hypogonadism (MK-8962-043)”,  
is part of an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) in the European Union (EU); EMEA-
000306PIP01-08-M04 (decision P/0143/2019) and that the study is part of a clinical development 
program. This study was planned and executed as part of a PIP for corifollitropin alfa (CFA) per EU 
regulations.  
The original PIP was issued in December 2008 and a PIP modification was agreed upon by the 
Paediatric Committee (PDCO) in AUG 2011 to extend the timelines for the planned clinical study. The 
PIP was modified in December 2013 to include two sequential, open-label, noncomparative studies in 
adult men with HH and in adolescent males with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH), instead of 
one, two-staged study, primarily to facilitate better execution of the studies. This modified PIP was 
approved by PDCO in May 2014. 
The part of the modified study studying adults was Study 031, an “open-label, non-comparative, multi-
centre safety and efficacy study of corifollitropin alfa (CFA) in association with hCG in male adults with 
hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism (HH)” and included 18 adult males. CFA use resulted in doubling of 
the mean testicular volume and induction of spermatogenesis in 77% of adult males who remained 
azoospermic after treatment with hCG. The dose used in Study P031 was based on the results from 
Study 022, a “Phase 1, open-label, repeated single dose, multicenter PK study in adult males with HH”.  
In this assessment report, the study in adolescents (P043) is reviewed. 
The MAH states in their cover letter that they are planning to submit a type II variation to update the 
product information to include the outcome of the PIP after finalization of this Article 46 application.

2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
No paediatric formulation for corifollitropin alfa was necessary. The pharmaceutical formulation used in 
the study were the currently registered formulations for Elonva in fertile women: 100 micrograms and 
150 micrograms solution for injection in prefilled syringe.  
For human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) the commercially available formulations for Pregnyl were 
used: 1500 IU in 2 mL vial and 5000 IU in 2 mL vial.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The disease 
Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is lack of, or inadequate, production of gonadotropins, follicle 
stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinising hormone (LH), from the pituitary gland and can be caused 
by a primary defect in gonadotropin secretion by the pituitary gonadotrophs, or from absent or 
inadequate gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) secretion by the hypothalamus. When 
gonadotropin deficiency occurs before puberty (prepubertal), puberty is delayed or absent. 
Paediatric hypogonadotropic hypogonadism 
Clinical presentation of hypogonadism at birth is rare, with abnormal genitalia occurring in ~1 in 4,500 
live births. Hypogonadism established after birth, throughout childhood, is usually inapparent until 
pubertal age; at this point, the hypogonadal condition manifests as delayed puberty. The prevalence of 
delayed puberty in the general population has not been thoroughly assessed. In this context, it is 
important to note that the current definition of delayed puberty is based on an arbitrary cut-off of 14 
years. Using this definition, early studies have found a prevalence of delayed puberty of <2% among 
boys in the United States (Salonia et al, Nat Rev Dis Primers. 2019).  
Treatment of adolescents 
The primary goal in the treatment of male HH is to increase testosterone (T) levels (either through the 
administration of exogenous T, or by using hCG to stimulate LH receptors on Leydig cells of the testes 
and induce the production of endogenous T from Leydig cells). This leads to a pubertal growth spurt 
and the development of male secondary sexual characteristics. Another important goal is to stimulate 
spermatogenesis to support fertility; this requires treatment with FSH to stimulate the proliferation and 
maturation of Sertoli cells in the testes, initiated before hCG treatment.  
Historically, boys with HH were given exogenous testosterone to induce the development of male 
secondary sexual characteristics. However, boys that are not exposed to FSH may miss a critical state 
of testicular development with regard to spermatogenesis.  
Currently, modern treatment protocols for adolescent males with HH use a 3-staged approach:  
- 
- 
- 
a short period of treatment with FSH-only to promote Sertoli cell proliferation and maturation, 
followed by treatment with a combination of FSH and hCG to stimulate Leydig cell function and 
increase T production until testicular volumes attain adult size,  
after which gonadotropin therapy can be stopped and T supplementation can be used to 
maintain male secondary sexual characteristics until fertility is desired.  
This approach allows for both the induction of puberty and maturation of Sertoli cells in early onset HH 
so that spermatogenesis and future fertility are not compromised.

of regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

Inhibin B has been shown to be a useful surrogate for monitoring spermatogenic activity in boys 
treated with hCG when semen analysis is not feasible.  
The product 
Elonva, corifollitropin alfa [CFA] is a recombinant gonadotropin, consisting of the α-subunit of human 
FSH and a hybrid subunit composed of the sequence of the α-subunit of human FSH and the carboxy-
terminal peptide (CTP) part of the α-subunit of the hCG. It has the same mechanism of action as FSH, 
but different pharmacokinetic (PK) properties. A single injection of corifollitropin alfa replaces 7 days of 
daily recombinant FSH. Since treatment of HH in males usually requires long-term treatment, the use 
of CFA may result in fewer medication errors and improved compliance. Both CFA and recFSH act at 
the same FSH receptor in the ovary or testes, therefore either can be used for gonadal stimulation. 
CFA has been approved in females, for controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) in 69 countries since 2010. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical study number and title:  
(P043:MK8962): A Phase III, Multi-Center, Open Label, Single-Group Trial to Investigate the Efficacy 
and Safety of MK-8962 (corifollitropin alfa) in combination with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) 
for initiation or restoration of puberty as assessed by increased testicular volume in adolescent males 
14 to <18 years old with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. 
Description 
This was a multicenter, open-label, single-group study evaluating the treatment of corifollitropin alfa 
(MK-8962) in combination with hCG to induce and/or restore puberty and induce and/or restore 
spermatogenesis in adolescent males with HH. 
The rationale for the pretreatment with CFA instead of hCG in HH adolescents is to mimic the 
gonadotropin pattern of normal puberty, ie, to stimulate FSH receptors on Sertoli cells with CFA prior 
to the stimulation of LH receptors on Leydig cells with hCG to induce testicular growth, masculinization, 
and preservation of future fertility in male adolescents.

Study design 
Figure 1 Study Design Diagram
Duration of treatment  
The total duration of the study was 73 weeks, the active treatment period was 64 weeks. 
Study population /Sample size 
This was an estimation study. Approximately 15 subjects were to be enrolled. 
Assuming a screen failure rate of approximately 50-60%, approximately 30-40 subjects were to be 
screened to enrol approximately 15 subjects. Assuming a discontinuation rate of 30%, it was estimated 
that 10 subjects will complete. If the discontinuation rate exceeded 30%, enrolment was to be 
reopened to assure the target number of completers. The total number of enrolled subjects was not to 
exceed 35. 
A total of 17 male adolescents were allocated to CFA (priming period) for 12 weeks and combined 
treatment with CFA and hCG for 52 weeks. 
Adolescent male participants who met the following key criteria were eligible to participate in the 
study:

Inclusion Criteria 
1.  14 to <18 years of age at the time when consent/assent was signed, with treatment to begin 
before the subject’s 18th birthday. 
2.  Diagnosis of HH (either isolated or associated with panhypopituitarism), either congenital or 
acquired with onset before puberty.  
Note: Subjects with drug-induced HH (e.g., misuse of anabolic steroids, chronic use of 
glucocorticoids or narcotic analgesics, etc.) are excluded. 
3.  Bilateral pre-gonadarche testes as defined by testicular volume <4.0 mL for each testicle, as 
determined by ultrasound and assessed by a qualified investigator (if qualified) or local 
radiologist with appropriate training and expertise in reading testicular ultrasound.  
Note: subjects with a volume of <4.0 mL in one testicle and a volume of 4-8 mL in the other 
testicle are considered to be pre-gonadarche and may participate, if there is no history or 
evidence of a primary testicular disorder (see exclusion criteria 1 and 2). 
4.  Circulating levels of Total T less than the LLN of 8.3 nmol/L as specified by the central 
laboratory for a young healthy adult male. 
5.  FSH ≤2 IU/L and LH ≤2 IU/L. 
6.  Inhibin B levels ≤35 pg/mL. Note: if the subject has inhibin B levels >35 pg/mL and meets all 
of the other inclusion/exclusion criteria, either a GnRH agonist (GnRHa) stimulation test or 
GnRH IV infusion test may be performed. The subject may be enrolled if either of the following 
is met: 
1)  GnRH agonist (GnRHa) stimulation test: LH level of <3 IU/L at all of the following time 
points: 0, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after subcutaneous administration of a GnRH agonist, 
eg., 500 μg of leuprolide acetate. 
2)  GnRH IV infusion test: LH peak <5.8 IU/L and FSH peak <4.6 IU/L at all of the following 
time points: 0, 15, 30, 45, 60 and 120 minutes during intravenous infusion of GnRH 100 
micrograms over 120 minutes. 
Exclusion Criteria 
1.  History of bilateral cryptorchidism (maldescended testes) or unilateral cryptorchidism treated 
after the age of 2 years. 
2.  History or presence of clinically significant testicular problems (e.g., epididymitis, orchitis, 
testicular torsion, varicocele Grade III, testicular atrophy, occlusive azoospermia, etc) that in 
the opinion of the investigator would impair the subject’s response to treatment or has had 
known damage or injury to the vas deferens. 
3.  Previous treatment with GnRH, gonadotropins (e.g., hCG, FSH) or androgens (e.g., T, etc.).  
Note: Use of GnRH and gonadotropins for diagnostic testing purposes only was allowed. 
Subjects with use of hCG and androgen therapy before 2 years old could have been included in 
the study. Subjects with transient use of androgens (i.e., for less than 2 weeks) that was 
stopped at least 6 months before signing informed consent could have also been included in 
the trial. 
4.  Untreated or inadequately treated pituitary or hypothalamic tumour. 
5.  Uncontrolled endocrinopathies, including thyroid, adrenal, and pituitary disorders not on stable 
replacement therapies (i.e., subject has not been on stable doses for at least 3 months).

Note: The subject with a free T4 level outside the normal laboratory range at the time of 
screening was excluded but may have been rescreened once he had been on a stable dose of 
replacement therapies for at least 3 months. 
6.  History of active pituitary hypersecretion as evidenced by hyperprolactinemia or Cushing’s 
disease, or acromegaly, or any other active pituitary hypersecretion syndrome. Note: Subjects 
were treated and are clinically stable, with no evidence of hypersecretion for at least 12 
months before screening, may have participated. 
7.  Hypophysectomy within a period of 12 months before the start of screening. 
8.  Had an allergy/sensitivity to gonadotropins or its/their excipients. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The inclusion criteria are acceptable and reflect the pre-puberty HH population with pre-gonadarche 
testes.  
The exclusion criteria are appropriate. Subjects were to be naïve for earlier treatment with 
testosterone, hCG, FSH or GnRH. The currently listed contraindication for FSH use in adult males with 
HH is primary testicular insufficiency, which is considered covered by these exclusion criteria aiming to 
exclude non-endocrine disorders.

Assessor’s comment 
This was an open label, single-group study where all participants received the same treatment and no 
comparison was made with placebo or other FSH treatment. 
The dose in relation to weight is the same as the current posology for women.

Statistical Methods 
The primary analysis for testicular volume was based on the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population. The 
primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change from Day 1 (Baseline) in log-transformed testicular 
volume was analysed using a mixed model with a fixed effect for baseline and time point and a random 
effect for each participant. The geometric mean increase in testicular volume and its 95% confidence 
intervals (CI) were obtained by exponentiation.  
The mean change from the first day of combined treatment (Week 12) to Week 64 in log-transformed 
testicular volume was also analysed using a mixed model with a fixed effect for time point. For each 
time point, the mean change from Week 12 to that time point and the associated 95% CI were 
calculated. The geometric mean increase in testicular volume and its 95% CI were obtained by 
exponentiation.  
The analyses for all secondary efficacy endpoints were conducted on the FAS population.  
The change in serum inhibin B concentrations after Weeks 12, 36, and 64 were summarized. Growth 
velocity over the 36- and 64-week treatment periods was extracted using the slopes estimated from an 
overall mixed random intercept and random slope model of height (cm) and time (in years) and age as 
covariates. Tanner Staging was recorded for both testicular volume and pubic hair at baseline, Weeks 
12, 36, and 64. Serum concentrations of hormones (LH, total T, E2, SHBG, and AMH) were 
summarized by assessment. Sonographic testicular patterns were listed and any changes over time 
were described.  
The PK analysis was conducted in the All-Subjects-Pharmacokinetically-Evaluable group. Serum CFA 
concentrations were obtained using a solid phase enzyme-immunoassay specific for CFA. Descriptive 
statistics for the serum concentrations by time-point were calculated.  
Safety analyses were performed in the ASaT population, which consisted of all participants who 
received at least 1 dose of study medication. Safety and tolerability were assessed by clinical review of 
relevant endpoints including AEs, presence of MK-8962 antibodies, predefined limits of change 
(PDLCs), laboratory tests, and vital signs. 
Assessor’s comment 
The primary analysis will be performed in the full analysis set using a mixed model. Secondary 
endpoints will be analysed with similar models. This is considered acceptable. 
Note (last paragraph): participants were not randomized as this was a one-arm uncontrolled study.

Compliance 
All participants were 100% compliant (ie, no missed injections) with CFA during the priming period and 
combined treatment period. Although hCG compliance was not specifically collected, an increase in 
hCG levels was observed after Week 12 and maintained throughout the rest of the study. 
Extent of exposure 
All participants received 6 or 7 doses of CFA before starting hCG. During the combined treatment 
period, participants received CFA with 500 to 5000 IU of hCG. In 2 participants, the dose of CFA was 
increased per protocol from 100 to 150 µg. The majority of participants received CFA for ≥52 weeks 
(n=16), 1 participant received CFA for ‘>36 weeks to 48 weeks’. 
Efficacy results 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint – Testicular Volume Change 
Testicular volume was measured as the sum of volumes of left and right testes by ultrasound. 
Priming period 
In the priming period, the mean testicular volume changed from a geometric mean of 1.4 mL to 2.5 
mL (mean fold increase of 1.83 (95% CI of 1.58, 2.13)): 
Table 6 Analysis of Testicular Volume (mL) Change from Baseline to Week 12 
Assessor’s comment 
In the priming period on CFA alone, to stimulate FSH receptors on Sertoli cells, the mean testicular 
volume (measured as the sum of volumes of left and right testes by ultrasound) at week 12 was 
almost doubled from a geometric mean of 1.4 mL to 2.5 mL. 
Overall treatment period 
During the overall treatment period, the increase noted in testicular volume at Week 64 changed from 
a geometric mean of 1.4 mL to 12.9 mL, mean fold increase of 9.43 mL (95% CI of 7.44, 11.97).

Table 7 Analysis of Testicular Volume (mL) Change from Baseline to Week 64 
Figure 2 Analysis of Testicular Volume Change Over Time 
Note: The geometric mean of testicular volume at baseline was 1.4 mL. 
During the overall treatment period, mean testicular volume (measured by ultrasound) increased, with 
the largest increase noted at Week 64.  
The mean testicular volume achieved at the end of Week 64 was less than the testicular volume 
observed at the end of normally-timed puberty. This reflected the exposure to gonadotropins for 64 
weeks, while normal puberty lasts for 2 to 3 years. At Week 64, 3 participants had a change of 
testicular volume of ≥20 mL from baseline. 
Assessor’s comment 
During the combined CFA/hCG treatment, the testicular volume continued to increase until end of 
study (Week 64) to 12.9 mL, mean fold increase of 9.43 mL (95% CI of 7.44, 11.97) compared to 
baseline.  
The applicant noted that the mean testicular volume achieved at the end of Week 64 (geometric mean 
12.9 mL) was less than the testicular volume observed at the end of normally-timed puberty, but that 
this is as expected considering the exposure to gonadotropins for 64 weeks, while normal puberty lasts

for 2 to 3 years. This explanation can be accepted (according to Rohany et al (2017) testicular volume 
observed at the end of normally-timed puberty is ≥24 mL). 
Symmetry in testes growth 
The increase in mean testicular volume during the overall treatment period was symmetric in both 
testes: 
Table 8 Analysis of Testicular Volume (mL) Change from Week 12 by Time Point and 
Laterality 
Assessor’s comment 
The testes growth was symmetrical.  
Body weight and dose 
Participants who began the study weighing ≤60 kg (and received 100 μg CFA), and participants who 
began the study weighing >60 kg (and received 150 μg CFA), had similar increases in mean testicular 
volume: 
Table 9 Summary of Testicular Volume (mL) Change by Weight 
Assessor’s comment 
Weight (and consequent dose of CFA) did not affect testicular growth in these patients: similar 
increases in mean testicular volume were seen, regardless of body weight at baseline.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Tanner Stage of Development 
At the start of the study, 12 participants (92.3%) in the FAS were prepubertal (Tanner I) and 1 
participant was in early puberty (Tanner II) for genital growth. At Week 64, 1 participant was in early 
puberty (Tanner II), 5 participants were in mid puberty (Tanner III), and 6 participants were in late 
puberty (Tanner IV/V): 
Figure 3 Summary of Tanner Stage Over Time (Genital Growth)  
At Week 64, all participants had pubic hair development ranging from Tanner III to V indicating 
pubertal progress. 
Testosterone 
Total T levels increased in response to hCG administered starting from Week 12. Mean total T levels at 
Week 64 (5.42 μg/L) were within the normal range (1 – 12 μg/L) observed in adolescent boys 
undergoing normally timed puberty:

Growth velocity 
Participants demonstrated increased linear growth in response to hCG, indicative of pubertal changes:

Table 11 Summary of Growth Velocity (cm/year) at Week 64 
Growth velocity at Week 64 (7.4 cm/year) was as expected in HH boys who were responding to 
therapy. 
The participants started at a mean pretreatment height of 160.1 cm ±10.5 cm. At the end of the 
study, mean height was 169.3 cm ±8.4 cm.  
The applicant noted that boys undergoing normally-timed puberty have been reported to have a mean 
prepubertal height of 156 cm at age 13, with increases from 5 cm/year to 7 cm/year during the first 
year of puberty. For participants in this study, mean baseline height was greater than 156 cm, 
reflecting the fact that they were older than 13 at the beginning of the study.  
Estradiol and Sex Hormone-Binding Globulin 
The increased estradiol observed in response to treatment was consistent with the changes in total T 
levels and reflect peripheral aromatization of T. No participant reported an AE of gynecomastia. 
Table 12 Summary of Estradiol (ng/L) Change from Baseline by Time Point 
The production of SHBG in the liver is regulated by the ratio of T and E2 levels (among other). During 
male puberty, a change in the T/E2 ratio in favour of T leads to a decrease in SHBG levels as observed 
in the participants in this study in response to administration of hCG:

Inhibin B Concentration  
Increased serum inhibin B is a surrogate marker of spermatogenesis. Increase in inhibin B levels shows 
proliferation of Sertoli cells, which are associated with sperm-producing capacity, by CFA treatment. 
The inhibin B response suggests that the testicles had matured and that the transition from 
Antimullerian Hormone (AMH) to inhibin B production in the testicles associated with puberty had 
occurred.  
There was a mean increase in inhibin B levels at Week 12 that was maintained through Week 64: 
Figure 5 Summary of Inhibin B Over Time 
Antimullerian Hormone 
There was an initial increase in AMH during the priming period, which is consistent with stimulation by 
CFA alone. After Week 12, when CFA was combined with hCG, mean AMH levels decreased, with the 
lowest AMH value at Week 64.

Figure 6 Summary of Antimullerian Hormone Over Time 
Assessor’s comment 
The results from the secondary objectives were supportive of the primary endpoint and suggestive 
of induced puberty:  
• 
 All subjects went to higher Tanner stages (III, IV and V) during the course of the study.  
•  Growth velocity from baseline to Week 64 was 7.4 cm/year.  
• 
Testosterone levels increased from Week 12 in response to hCG: mean total T level at Week 
64 was 5.42 μg/L. Variations in testosterone levels were within the normal range (1 – 12 
μg/L) observed in adolescent boys.   
•  Changes in E2 (increase) and SHBG levels (decrease) were consistent with increased 
testosterone production. 
•  Serum inhibin B levels, a surrogate marker of spermatogenesis, increased on CFA alone. The 
decreased Anti Mullerian Hormone (AMH) levels increased on CFA alone and decreased after 
hCG was added, suggesting a transition from AMH to inhibin B production in the testicles, in 
line with normal puberty.

Assessor’s comment 
Mean pre-dose (trough) CFA serum concentrations ranged from 301 ng/L to 864 ng/L and were 
generally similar, after repeated dosing with CFA alone and co-administered with hCG, i.e. mean and 
median concentrations at visit 8 and 9 (CFA alone) were similar to concentrations at visits 11-13 (CFA 
+ hCG). CFA serum concentrations appeared comparable in participants with body weights ≤60 kg

receiving 100 µg doses of CFA and participants with body weights >60 kg receiving 150 μg doses of 
CFA, as far as can be concluded based on limited data without available statistical analyses on the 
comparison between the groups receiving 100 µg and 150 µg. 
Overall conclusion on efficacy (applicant) 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
• In the FAS population (N=13), treatment with CFA for 64 weeks (administered alone for 12 weeks 
and then in combination with hCG from Weeks 12 to 64) induced testicular growth and development in 
adolescent males with HH. 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
•  Increased T levels, increased growth velocity, and progression of secondary sexual characteristics 
(Tanner III, IV, and V) indicated appropriate responses to hCG by the Leydig cells of the 
participants’ testes. Changes in E2 and SHBG were consistent with increased T production. 
•  Increased serum inhibin B levels, a surrogate marker of spermatogenesis, and decreased AMH 
levels were consistent with pubertal progression and indicate that future fertility may be 
preserved. 
•  Mean predose (trough) CFA serum concentrations ranged from 301 ng/mL to 864 ng/mL and were 
generally similar, after repeated dosing with CFA alone and coadministered with hCG. CFA serum 
concentrations were comparable in participants with body weights ≤60 kg receiving 100 μg doses 
of CFA and participants with body weights >60 kg receiving 150 μg doses of CFA. 
Overall conclusion on efficacy (Rapporteur) 
The applied regimen of 12 weeks of pretreatment with Elonva and subsequently 52 weeks of 
Elonva/hCG combined was seen to induce puberty in the efficacy analysis population, based on 
increase in testicular volume. The results from the secondary objectives were supportive of an 
induction of pubertal development and induction of spermatogenesis.

•  Both acne and vomiting were considered possibly related to study medication.  
• 
There were no AEs with severe intensity reported. 
Serious adverse events 
There were no deaths reported in this study. 
There was one SAE in the study. One participant had an SAE of a recurrent disease. This participant 
had a medical history of this condition. This SAE led to discontinuation of study medication and was 
considered by the investigator not related to study medication. The SAE was treated, and the 
participant completed the study off study medication. 
Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events 
One participant discontinued study medication due to an SAE (see above). 
Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Prespecified AEs of special interest included anti-MK-8962 antibodies (ie, anti-drug antibodies; ADA), 
and hypersensitivity reactions. 
•  Anti-MK-8962 Antibodies 
There were no cases of confirmed anti-MK-8962 antibodies. 
•  Hypersensitivity Reactions 
There were 3 participants with hypersensitivity AEs: gingival oedema and rhinitis allergic (n=1), 
Dermatitis contact (n=1) and Pruritus (n=1).  
All AEs were mild in intensity, except for allergic rhinitis (moderate), considered not related to study 
medication by the investigator, and resolved while the participant was still on study medication. 
Events of Clinical Interest 
•  Overdose 
One participant overdosed with hCG. The investigator provided instructions to up titrate the 
participant’s hCG from 1500 IU to 2000 IU, and parent mistakenly gave the participant a dose of 
5000 IU hCG (the entire contents of the 5000 IU vial) instead of 2000 IU for 6 doses (2 weeks). 
The participant had an AE of increased estradiol during this period. 
•  Hepatic Safety 
No participants met the biochemical criteria for drug-induced livery injury. 
•  Cerebrovascular disorder 
One participant underwent a routine endocrine evaluation and was discovered to have elevated 
prolactin levels and a minimal disorder of cerebral blood flow. The AE was ongoing and stable at 
the final visit. The investigator assessed the AE as not related to study medication and it was 
mapped to the PT of cerebrovascular disorder.

Participant Narratives 
A narrative was written for 2 participants: 1 participant who discontinued study medication due to 
a SAE, and 1 participant who was accidently overdosed with hCG (administered by legal guardian). 
Assessor’s comments 
Sixteen of the 17 participants experienced at least one AE. Overall, the most common AEs (>20%) 
were spermatocele (n=5), increased E2 (n=5), increased blood T (n=4), and headache (n=4). One 
participant had an AE of increased E2 related to an accidental hCG overdose. In the priming period, the 
most frequently reported AEs (>10%) were headache (n=3) and rhinorrhoea (n=2). 
Nine participants had drug-related AEs. Seven participants had AEs related to hCG that included 
increased blood T and increased E2; 2 participants had AEs related to CFA that included vomiting, 
injection site pain, and hot flush; and 1 participant had an AE related to both CFA and hCG (acne). 
It was stated that laboratory AEs for increased T and E2 levels were reported at the investigator’s 
discretion. However, changes over time for endocrine laboratory values (T, E2, and SHBG) were 
expected to change while participants underwent puberty. Beside the case of hCG overdose, it is not 
clear why the investigators reported some of these changes as adverse events. The applicant is asked 
to clarify (see section 4 “Additional clarification requested”). 
All AEs were mild to moderate in intensity. 
One participant had an SAE of a recurrent disease. He discontinued study medication but remained in 
the study. 
There were no deaths reported in this study.  
Safety results showed that the treatment was safe and well-tolerated. 
Clinical laboratory 
The changes over time for blood chemistry (ALP and creatinine), haematology and prespecified 
endocrine laboratory values (T, E2, and SHBG) were expected to change while participants underwent 
puberty.  
Safety ranges for each parameter were used to identify markedly abnormal chemistry or haematology 
values during the study: 
•  5 participants had 1 value >1.5 x ULN for ALP 
• 
The last serum creatinine values for 3 participants met the PDLC criterion of increase in 
creatinine of ≥0.3 mg/dL from baseline; however, all 3 values were below the ULN (1.2 mg/dL). 
•  No participants met the PDLC criteria for ALT, AST, bilirubin, or drug-induced liver injury. 
•  One participant met the PDLC criterion of last haemoglobin value (12.2 g/dL) (baseline 13.7 
g/dL; NR: 12.7 g/dL–18.1 g/dL) at Week 36. Haematocrit had decreased by 5% from baseline 
(to 38%) and was slightly below the LLN (39.5%). The MCV was unchanged and was within the 
NR at all measurements. A subsequent CBC sample obtained at Week 64 was clotted and no 
repeat samples were obtained.

• 
Elevated prolactin levels (NR: 130-600 mIU/L) were noted for 1 participant during a routine 
clinical evaluation scheduled in accordance with local clinical practice guidelines for the 
management of patients with hypopituitarism. On Day 295, an AE of ‘blood prolactin increased’ 
was first noted (2445 mIU/L). A pituitary MRI revealed no changes from previous scans. This 
participant had an associated AE of cerebrovascular disorder. Repeat prolactin levels were 
stable (Day 301; 2301 mIU/L, Day 307; 2506 mIU/L, Day 352; 2092 mIU/L). The AE of 
elevated prolactin was considered not related to study medication. 
Assessor’s comments 
Clinical laboratory data did not show unexpected values or changes due to study medication. 
Overall conclusion on safety (applicant) 
•  Antibodies to CFA were not detected. 
•  Nine participants reported AEs that were considered by the investigator to be drug-related. 
Most of these were considered related to hCG. 
• 
The most frequently reported AEs were spermatocele, increased E2, increased blood T, and 
headache. 
•  One participant had a SAE that was considered not related to study medication by the 
investigator. 
• 
The incidence of hypersensitivity AEs was low and resolved while on study medication. 
Overall conclusion on safety Rapporteur 
The results showed that the treatment was safe, and no unexpected drug-related adverse events 
occurred, although one issue needs clarification: 
It was stated that laboratory AEs for increased T and E2 levels were reported at the investigator’s 
discretion. However, changes over time for endocrine laboratory values (T, E2, and SHBG) were 
expected to change in participants who were treated to induce development of puberty. Beside the 
case of hCG overdose, it is not clear why the investigators reported some of these changes as adverse 
events. The applicant is asked to clarify (see section 4 “Additional clarification requested”). 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Elonva, corifollitropin alfa [CFA] is a recombinant gonadotropin, which has the same mechanism of 
action as FSH, but different PK properties. A single injection of corifollitropin alfa replaces 7 days of 
daily recFSH. It can be agreed that is an advantage to the patient as the use of corifollitropin alfa may 
result in fewer medication errors and improved compliance in the long-term HH treatment.  
In the clinical development plan, based on the results from Study 022 (Phase 1, open-label, repeated 
single dose, multicenter PK study in adult males with HH), the CFA dose in Study 031 was determined. 
In Study 031, an open-label, non-comparative, multi-centre safety and efficacy study of corifollitropin 
in association with hCG in male adults with hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism, CFA was evaluated in 
18 adult males with HH. CFA use more than doubled the mean testicular volume and induced 
spermatogenesis in 77% of adult males who remained azoospermic after treatment with hCG. Study

P031 has been published (Nieschlag et al. Reproductive Biology and Endocrinology (2017)) but has not 
been submitted as yet to the Rapporteur. 
Currently, Elonva (corifollitropin alfa) is not approved for use in men. However, recFSH preparations 
(follitropin) are approved for use in adult men: <RecFSH> is indicated for the stimulation of 
spermatogenesis in men who have congenital or acquired hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism with 
concomitant human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG) therapy. 
The rationale for the pre-treatment with CFA instead of hCG in HH adolescents was to mimic the 
gonadotropin pattern of normal puberty, i.e. to stimulate FSH receptors on Sertoli cells with CFA prior 
to the stimulation of LH receptors on Leydig cells with hCG to induce testicular growth, masculinization, 
and adequate spermatogenesis. In the current study, 17 adolescent boys (14 to 17 years old) with HH 
were treated 12 weeks with CFA alone and then combined with hCG 52 weeks).  
Seventeen subjects were recruited from the following countries: Mexico (n=1), Brazil (n=4), Russia 
(n=11) and Italy (n=1). All subjects (100.0%) were treated, 16 (94.1%), completed the study on 
study medication, and 1 (5.9%) completed the study off study medication. A total of 13 of 17 
participants met the criteria for the efficacy population.  
The subjects were all pre-pubertal, with a mean testicular volume of 2.2 mL, measured by ultrasound. 
Currently, the mean testicular volume before the onset of puberty in boys with normally-timed puberty 
has been determined to be 0.6 mL (i.e., testicular volume of ~1.2 mL), which is smaller. The applicant 
explained that testes grow throughout childhood, and as treatment in adolescent males with HH is 
typically delayed beyond onset of normally-timed puberty, the baseline testicular volume in these 
males with HH prior to therapy is likely to be larger than 1.2 mL reflecting continued prepubertal 
growth prior to the start of treatment. This explanation can be accepted. 
Efficacy 
The primary endpoint for efficacy was shown by increase in testicular volume, measured as the sum of 
volumes of left and right testes by ultrasound. In the priming period, the mean testicular volume 
changed from a geometric mean of 1.4 mL to 2.5 mL (mean fold increase of 1.83 (95% CI of 1.58, 
2.13)). During the overall treatment period, the increase noted in testicular volume at Week 64 
changed from a geometric mean of 1.4 mL to 12.9 mL, mean fold increase of 9.43 (95% CI of 7.44, 
11.97). The applicant noted that the mean testicular volume achieved at the end of Week 64 
(geometric mean 12.9 mL) was less than the testicular volume observed at the end of normally-timed 
puberty but that this is as expected considering the exposure to gonadotropins for 64 weeks, while 
normal puberty lasts for 2 to 3 years. This explanation can be accepted (according to Rohany et al 
(2017) testicular volume observed at the end of normally-timed puberty is ≥24 mL).  
The results from the secondary objectives were supportive of the primary endpoint.  All subjects went 
to higher Tanner stages (III, IV and V) during the course of the study. Growth velocity from baseline to 
Week 64 was 7.4 cm/year. Testosterone levels increased from Week 12 in response to hCG: mean 
total T level at Week 64 was 5.42 μg/L. Variations in testosterone levels were within the normal range 
(1 – 12 μg/L) observed in adolescent boys. Changes in E2 (increase) and SHBG levels (decrease) were 
consistent with increased testosterone production. Serum inhibin B levels, a surrogate marker of 
spermatogenesis, increased on CFA alone. The decreased Antimullerian Hormone (AMH) levels 
increased on CFA alone and decreased after hCG was added, suggesting a transition from AMH to 
inhibin B production in the testicles, in line with normal puberty 
Safety 
Safety was also a primary endpoint. The treatment was well tolerated. There were no severe AEs and 
no SAEs, except one SAE of recurrence of pre-existing condition leading to discontinuation. Sixteen of

the 17 participants experienced at least one AE. Overall, the most common AEs (>20%) were 
spermatocele (n=5), increased E2 (n=5), increased blood T (n=4), and headache (n=4). Laboratory 
AEs for increased T and E2 levels were reported at the investigator’s discretion. One participant had an 
AE of increased E2 related to an accidental hCG overdose. In the priming period, the most frequently

Beside the case of hCG overdose, it is not clear why the investigators reported some of these changes 
as adverse events. The applicant is asked to clarify (see section 4 “Additional clarification requested”). 
Antibodies to CFA were not detected. 
Pharmacokinetics 
After repeated dosing of CFA alone and co-administered with hCG, predose (trough) CFA serum 
concentrations are generally similar. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study P043 was a one-armed open-label study conducted to assess safety and efficacy of Elonva 
(corifollitropin) in association with hCG in 17 male adolescents (14 to 18 years of age) with 
hypogonadotrophic hypogonadism.  
Regarding efficacy, the applied regimen of 12 weeks of pre-treatment with Elonva and subsequently 52 
weeks of Elonva/hCG combined showed to induce puberty (measured by increase in testicular volume) 
in all 13 patients included in the efficacy population. The results from the secondary objectives were 
supportive of an induction of pubertal development and induction of spermatogenesis.  
As to safety, the results showed that the treatment was safe and no unexpected drug-related adverse 
events occurred in the 17 included participants, although one issue with regard to changes over time 
for endocrine laboratory values needs clarification (see section 4 “Additional clarification requested”). 
The results from PIP study P043 do not impact the benefit-risk profile of Elonva.  
The Rapporteur welcomes the subsequent submission of the type II variation to update the Product 
Information with the results of the Art 46 study as proposed by the company.  
However, as part of this Art 46 procedure the MAH should provide the requested additional 
clarification, see section 4 “Additional clarification requested”.

4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following question as part of this procedure: 
1.  It was stated that laboratory AEs for increased T and E2 levels were reported at the 
investigator’s discretion. However, changes over time for endocrine laboratory values (T, E2, 
and SHBG) were expected to change in participants who are treated to induce development of 
puberty. Beside the case of hCG overdose, it is not clear why the investigators reported some 
of these changes as adverse events. The applicant is asked to clarify. 
The timetable is a 30-day response timetable with clock stop. 
5.  MAH responses to Request for supplementary information  
Question 1 
It was stated that laboratory AEs for increased T and E2 levels were reported at the investigator’s 
discretion. However, changes over time for endocrine laboratory values (T, E2, and SHBG) were 
expected to change in participants who are treated to induce development of puberty. Beside the case 
of hCG overdose, it is not clear why the investigators reported some of these changes as adverse 
events. The applicant is asked to clarify. 
Applicant’s response 
Based on the information provided in the protocol and presentations at Investigators’ meetings, 
Investigators were aware that treatment with corifollitropin alfa and human chorionic gonadotropin 
(hCG) will induce normal pubertal changes including increases in testosterone and estradiol levels, and 
reductions in sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) levels, in adolescent males with hypogonadotropic 
hypogonadism. 
Investigators were allowed to titrate the dose of hCG based on testosterone and estradiol levels. The 
protocol defined acceptable levels of total testosterone and estradiol in response to treatment with hCG 
based on the assays from the central laboratory used (Section 5.2.1.2: ≤950 ng/dL for total 
testosterone, and <56 pg/mL for estradiol). Investigators used their discretion to report total 
testosterone and/or estradiol measurements that were above these cut-offs as AEs. Investigators 
reported AEs of increased testosterone and/or estradiol if the values were above the cut-offs; with the 
exception of one participant, each of these reports was followed by a reduction in the dose of hCG in 
response. There were no AEs reported for changes in SHBG. 
One participant had total testosterone and estradiol levels that were above the cut-offs defined above, 
and his dose of hCG was decreased; however, no AEs of increased testosterone or estradiol were 
reported for this participant.

Assessment of the applicant’s response 
The applicant explained that in the protocol total testosterone and estradiol levels in response to 
treatment were given and that investigators were free to report reported changes beyond these cut-off 
levels as adverse events if they considered this of interest. This explanation is acceptable. 
Conclusion 
Issue solved.

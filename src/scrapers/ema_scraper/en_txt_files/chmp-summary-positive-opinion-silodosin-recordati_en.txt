Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Silodosin Recordati 
silodosin 
On 15 November 2018, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Silodosin 
Recordati, intended for the treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia. The 
applicant for this medicinal product is Recordati Ireland Ltd. 
Silodosin Recordati will be available as 4-mg and 8-mg capsules. The active substance of Silodosin Recordati 
is silodosin, a α1A-adrenoreceptor antagonist (ATC code: G04CA04) that decreases the bladder outlet 
resistance and improves storage (irritative) and voiding (obstructive) lower urinary tract symptoms. 
Silodosin Recordati is a generic of Urorec which has been authorised in the EU since 29 January 2010. 
Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Silodosin Recordati. Since Silodosin Recordati is 
identical to the reference medicinal product, a bioequivalence study versus the reference medicinal product 
Urorec was not required. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be found here. 
The full indication is: "Treatment of the signs and symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) in adult 
men".  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and made 
available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been granted by the 
European Commission.

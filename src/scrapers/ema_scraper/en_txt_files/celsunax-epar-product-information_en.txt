CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
This medicinal product is for diagnostic use only. 
Celsunax is indicated for detecting loss of functional dopaminergic neuron terminals in the striatum: 
- 
- 
In adult patients with clinically uncertain parkinsonian syndromes, for example those with early 
symptoms, in order to help differentiate essential tremor from parkinsonian syndromes related to 
idiopathic Parkinson’s disease, multiple system atrophy and progressive supranuclear palsy. 
Celsunax is unable to discriminate between Parkinson's disease, multiple system atrophy and 
progressive supranuclear palsy. 
In adult patients, to help differentiate probable dementia with Lewy bodies from Alzheimer’s 
disease. 
Celsunax is unable to discriminate between dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson’s disease 
dementia. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Prior to administration appropriate resuscitation equipment should be available. 
Celsunax should only be used in adult patients referred by physicians experienced in the management of 
movement disorders and/or dementia. Celsunax should only be used by qualified personnel with the 
appropriate government authorisation for the use and manipulation of radionuclides within a designated 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical setting. 
Posology 
Clinical efficacy has been demonstrated across the range 110 to 185 MBq. Do not exceed 185 MBq and 
do not use when the activity is below 110 MBq. 
Patients must undergo appropriate thyroid blocking treatment prior to injection to minimise thyroid 
uptake of radioactive iodine, for example by oral administration of approximately 120 mg potassium 
iodide 1 to 4 hours prior to injection of Celsunax. 
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Formal studies have not been carried out in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment. No 
data are available (see section 4.4). 
Careful consideration of the activity to be administered is required since an increased radiation 
exposure is possible in these patients. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Celsunax in children aged 0 to 18 years has not been established. No data are 
available. 
Method of administration 
For intravenous use. 
Vial for single use. 
For patient preparation, see section 4.4. 
Precautions to be taken before handling or administering the medicinal product 
Celsunax should be used without dilution. To minimise the potential for pain at the injection site during 
administration, a slow intravenous injection (not less than 15 to 20 seconds) via an arm vein is 
recommended. 
Image acquisition 
SPECT imaging should take place between three and six hours post-injection. Images should be 
acquired using a gamma camera fitted with a high-resolution collimator and calibrated using the 
159 keV photopeak and a ± 10% energy window. Angular sampling should preferably be not less than 
120 views over 360 degrees. For high resolution collimators the radius of rotation should be consistent 
and set as small as possible (typically 11-15 cm). Experimental studies with a striatal phantom, suggest 
that optimal images are obtained with matrix size and zoom factors selected to give a pixel size of 
3.5-4.5 mm for those systems currently in use. A minimum of 500k counts should be collected for 
optimal images. Normal images are characterised by two symmetrical crescent-shaped areas of equal 
intensity. Abnormal images are either asymmetric or symmetric with unequal intensity and/or loss of 
crescent. 
4.3  Contraindications 
- 
- 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy (see section 4.6).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Potential for hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions 
If hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions occur, the administration of the medicinal product must be 
discontinued immediately and, if necessary, intravenous treatment initiated. The necessary resuscitative 
medicinal products and equipment (e.g. endotracheal tube and ventilator) have to be readily available, 
to enable immediate action in emergencies. 
This radiopharmaceutical may be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in 
designated clinical settings. Its receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the regulations 
and the appropriate licences of the local competent official organisations. 
Individual benefit/risk justification 
For each patient, exposure to ionising radiation must be justifiable on the basis of likely benefit. The 
activity administered must be such that the resulting dose is as low as reasonably achievable bearing in 
mind the need to obtain the intended diagnostic result. 
Renal impairment/hepatic impairment 
Formal studies have not been carried out in patients with significant renal or hepatic impairment. In the 
absence of data, Celsunax is not recommended in cases of moderate to severe renal or hepatic 
impairment. 
Careful consideration of the benefit risk ratio in these patients is required since an increased radiation 
exposure is possible. 
Patient preparation  
The patient should be well hydrated before the start of the examination and urged to void as often as 
possible during the first hours after the examination in order to reduce radiation. 
Specific warnings 
This medicinal product contains up to 197 mg of alcohol (ethanol) in each dose which is equivalent to 
39.5 mg/mL (5% by volume). The amount in 5 mL of this medicinal product is equivalent to 5 mL beer 
or 2 mL wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicinal product will not have any noticeable 
effects. 
Precautions with respect to environmental hazard see section 6.6. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No interaction studies have been performed in humans. 
Ioflupane binds to the dopamine transporter. Active substances that bind to the dopamine transporter 
with high affinity may therefore interfere with Celsunax diagnosis. These include:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
amfetamine,  
benzatropine,  
buproprion,  
cocaine,  
mazindol,  
methylphenidate,  
phentermine, 
sertraline. 
Active substances shown during clinical studies not to interfere with Celsunax imaging include:  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
amantadine,  
trihexyphenidyl,  
budipine,  
levodopa,  
metoprolol,  
primidone,  
propranolol, 
selegiline.  
Dopamine agonists and antagonists acting on the postsynaptic dopamine receptors are not expected to 
interfere with Celsunax imaging and can therefore be continued if desired. Medicinal products shown in 
animal studies not to interfere with Celsunax imaging include pergolide. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
Where it is necessary to administer radioactive medicinal products to women of childbearing potential, 
information should always be sought about pregnancy. Any woman who has missed a period should be 
assumed to be pregnant, until proven otherwise. Where uncertainty exists, it is important that radiation 
exposure should be the minimum consistent with achieving satisfactory imaging. Alternative techniques 
which do not involve ionising radiation should be considered. 
Pregnancy 
Animal reproductive toxicity studies have not been performed with this product. Radionuclide 
procedures carried out on pregnant women also involve radiation doses to the foetus. Administration of 
185 MBq of ioflupane (123I) results in an absorbed dose to the uterus of 3.0 mGy. Celsunax is 
contraindicated in pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether ioflupane (123I) is excreted in human milk. Before administering a radioactive 
medicinal product to a breast-feeding mother, consideration should be given as to whether the 
investigation could be reasonably delayed until the mother has ceased breast-feeding and as to whether 
the most appropriate choice of radiopharmaceutical has been made, bearing in mind the secretion of 
radioactivity in breast milk. If administration is considered necessary, breast-feeding should be 
interrupted for 3 days and substituted by formula feeding. During this time, breast milk should be 
expressed at regular intervals and the expressed feeds should be discarded. 
Fertility 
No fertility studies have been performed. No data are available. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Celsunax has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

Exposure to ionising radiation is linked with cancer induction and a potential for development of 
hereditary defects. As the effective dose is 4.63 mSv when the maximal recommended activity of 
185 MBq is administered these adverse events are expected to occur with a low probability. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
In cases of administration of a radiation overdose, frequent micturition and defaecation should be 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
encouraged in order to minimise radiation dose to the patient. Care should be taken to avoid 
contamination from the radioactivity eliminated by the patient using such methods. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Diagnostic radiopharmaceuticals, central nervous system, 
ATC code: V09AB03 
At the chemical concentrations used for diagnostic examinations, Celsunax does not appear to have any 
pharmacodynamic activity. 
Mechanism of action 
Ioflupane is a cocaine analogue. Studies in animals have shown that ioflupane binds with high affinity to 
the presynaptic dopamine transporter and so radiolabelled ioflupane (123I) can be used as a surrogate 
marker to examine the integrity of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal neurons. Ioflupane also binds to the 
serotonin transporter on 5-HT neurons but with lower (approximately 10-fold) binding affinity. 
There is no experience in types of tremor other than essential tremor. 
Clinical efficacy 
Clinical studies in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies 
In a pivotal clinical study including evaluation of 288 subjects with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) 
(144 subjects), Alzheimer’s disease (124 subjects), vascular dementia (9 subjects) or other (11 subjects), 
the results of an independent, blinded visual assessment of the ioflupane (123I) images were compared to 
the clinical diagnosis as determined by physicians experienced in the management and diagnosis of 
dementias. Clinical categorisation into the respective dementia group was based on a standardised and 
comprehensive clinical and neuropsychiatric evaluation. The values for the sensitivity of 
ioflupane (123I) in determining probable DLB from non-DLB ranged from 75.0% to 80.2% and 
specificity from 88.6% to 91.4%. The positive predictive value ranged from 78.9% to 84.4% and the 
negative predictive value from 86.1% to 88.7%. Analyses in which both possible and probable DLB 
patients were compared with non-DLB dementia patients demonstrated values for the sensitivity of 
ioflupane (123I) ranging from 75.0% to 80.2% and specificity from 81.3% to 83.9% when the possible 
DLB patients were included as non-DLB patients. The sensitivity ranged from 60.6% to 63.4% and 
specificity from 88.6% to 91.4% when the possible DLB patients were included as DLB patients. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Distribution 
Ioflupane (123I) is cleared rapidly from the blood after intravenous injection; only 5% of the 
administered activity remains in whole blood at 5 minutes post-injection. 
Organ uptake 
Uptake in the brain is rapid, reaching about 7% of injected activity at 10 minutes post-injection and 
decreasing to 3% after 5 hours. About 30% of the whole brain activity is attributed to striatal uptake. 
Elimination 
At 48 hours post-injection, approximately 60% of the injected radioactivity is excreted in the urine, with 
faecal excretion calculated at approximately 14%.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data for ioflupane reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of 
safety pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity and genotoxicity. 
Studies on reproductive toxicity and to assess the carcinogenic potential of ioflupane have not been 
performed. 
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA)  
After use, all materials associated with the preparation and administration of radiopharmaceuticals, 
including any unused medicinal product and its container, should be decontaminated or treated as 
radioactive waste and disposed of in accordance with the conditions specified by the local competent 
authority. Contaminated material must be disposed of as radioactive waste via an authorised route.

Radiopharmaceuticals should be received, used and administered only by authorised persons in 
designated clinical settings. Their receipt, storage, use, transfer and disposal are subject to the 
regulations and/or appropriate licences of the competent official organisation.  
Radiopharmaceuticals should be prepared in a manner which satisfies both radiation safety and 
pharmaceutical quality requirements. Appropriate aseptic precautions should be taken. 
If at any time in the preparation of this product the integrity of this vial is compromised it should not be 
used. 
Administration procedures should be carried out in a way to minimise risk of contamination of the 
medicinal product and irradiation of the operators. Adequate shielding is mandatory. 
The administration of radiopharmaceuticals creates risks for other persons from external radiation or 
contamination from spill of urine, vomiting etc. Radiation protection precautions in accordance with 
national regulations must therefore be taken.

11.  DOSIMETRY 
The estimated absorbed radiation doses to an average adult patient (70 kg) from intravenous injection of 
ioflupane (123I) are listed in the table below. The values are calculated assuming urinary bladder 
emptying at 4.8-hour intervals and appropriate thyroid blocking (Iodine-123 is a known Auger electron 
emitter). Frequent bladder emptying should be encouraged after dosing to minimise radiation exposure. 
The biokinetic model for ioflupane (123I) adopted by the International Commission on Radiological 
Protection (ICRP) publication 128 (2015) assumes initial uptake of 31% of the administered activity in 
the liver, 11% in the lungs, and 4% in the brain. The rest is assumed to be distributed uniformly in the 
remaining organs and tissues. For all organs and tissues, 80% is assumed to be excreted with a 
biological half-time of 58 h, and 20% with a half-time of 1.6 h. It is further assumed that 60% of the 
injected activity is excreted to the urine, and 40% is excreted to the gastrointestinal tract for all organs 
and tissues. Activity in the liver is excreted according to the ICRP publication 53 gallbladder model 
(1987), where 30% is eliminated via the gallbladder and the remainder passes directly into the small

Ref.: Publication 128 of the annals of ICRP (Radiation dose to patients from radiopharmaceuticals: a compendium of 
current information related to frequently used substances), 2015. 
The effective dose (E) resulting from administration of 185 MBq of Celsunax injection is 4.63 mSv 
(per 70 kg individual). The above data are valid in normal pharmacokinetic behaviour. When renal or 
hepatic function is impaired, the effective dose and the radiation dose delivered to organs might be 
increased. 
10 
 
 
 
 
For an administered activity of 185 MBq the typical radiation dose to the target organ (brain) is 3 mGy 
and the typical radiation doses to the critical organs: liver and colon wall are 16 mGy and 11 mGy, 
respectively.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Celsunax is and what it is used for 
This medicine is a radiopharmaceutical product for diagnostic use only. It is used only to identify 
illness. 
Celsunax contains the active substance ioflupane (123I) which is used to help identify (diagnose) 
conditions in the brain. It belongs to a group of medicines called “radiopharmaceuticals”, which contain 
a small amount of radioactivity. 
- 
- 
- 
When a radiopharmaceutical is injected, it collects in a specific organ or area of the body for a 
short time. 
Because it contains a small amount of radioactivity it can be detected from outside the body using 
special cameras. 
A picture, known as a scan, can be taken. This scan will show exactly where the radioactivity is 
inside the organ and the body. This can give the doctor valuable information about how that organ 
is working. 
When Celsunax is injected into an adult, it is carried around the body in the blood. It collects in a small 
area of your brain. Changes in this area of the brain occur in: 
parkinsonism (including Parkinson’s disease) and 
- 
dementia with Lewy bodies. 
- 
A scan will give your doctor information about any changes in this area of your brain. Your doctor may 
feel that the scan would help in finding out more about your condition and deciding on possible 
treatment. 
When Celsunax is used, you are exposed to small amounts of radioactivity. This exposure is less than in 
some types of X-ray investigation. Your doctor and the nuclear medicine doctor have considered that the 
clinical benefit of this procedure with the radiopharmaceutical outweighs the risk of being exposed to 
these small amounts of radiation. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.  What you need to know before Celsunax is used 
Celsunax must not be used 
- 
if you are allergic to ioflupane or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are pregnant. 
- 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your nuclear medicine doctor before using this medicine if you have a moderate or severe 
problem with your kidneys or liver. 
Before you are given Celsunax you should drink plenty of water before the start of the examination 
in order to urinate as often as possible during the first hours after the study. 
Children and adolescents 
Celsunax is not recommended for children and adolescents below 18 years. 
Other medicines and Celsunax 
Tell your nuclear medicine doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines.  
Some medicines or substances can affect the way that this medicine works. 
These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
buproprion (used to treat depression (sadness)), 
benzatropine (used to treat Parkinson’s disease), 
mazindol (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity), 
sertraline (used to treat depression (sadness)), 
methylphenidate (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness)), 
phentermine (reduces appetite, as a means to treat obesity), 
amfetamine (used to treat hyperactivity in children and narcolepsy (excessive sleepiness); also a 
substance of abuse), 
cocaine (sometimes used as an anaesthetic for nose surgery; also a substance of abuse). 
- 
Some medicines may reduce the quality of the picture obtained. The doctor may ask you to stop taking 
them for a short time before you receive Celsunax. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your nuclear medicine doctor for advice before you are given this medicine. 
Do not use Celsunax if you are pregnant or think you may possibly be pregnant. This is because the 
child may receive some of the radioactivity. Alternative techniques which do not involve radioactivity 
should be considered. 
If you are breast-feeding, your nuclear medicine doctor may delay the use of Celsunax, or ask you to 
stop breast-feeding. It is not known whether ioflupane (123I) is passed into breast milk. 
- 
- 
- 
You should not breast-feed your child for 3 days after Celsunax is given. 
Instead use formula feed for your child. Express your breast milk regularly and throw away any 
breast milk you have expressed. 
You will need to continue to do this for 3 days, until the radioactivity is no longer in your body. 
Driving and using machines 
Celsunax has no known influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
Celsunax contains alcohol (ethanol): up to 197 mg of alcohol in each dose which is equivalent to 
39.5 mg/mL (5% by volume). The amount in 5 mL of this medicine is equivalent to 5 mL beer or 2 mL 
wine. The small amount of alcohol in this medicine will not have any noticeable effects.

3. 
How Celsunax is used 
There are strict laws on the use, handling and disposal of radiopharmaceutical medicines. Celsunax will 
always be used in a hospital or a similar place. It will only be handled and given to you by people who 
are trained and qualified to use it safely. They should tell you anything you need to do for the safe use of 
this medicine. 
Your nuclear medicine doctor will decide which dose of Celsunax is best for you. It will be the smallest 
quantity necessary to get the desired information. 
Before you receive Celsunax, your nuclear medicine doctor will ask you to take some tablets or liquid 
that contain iodine. These stop the radioactivity building-up in your thyroid gland. It is important that 
you take the tablets or liquid as the doctor tells you. 
Administration of Celsunax and conduct of the procedure  
Celsunax is given to you as an injection, usually into a vein in your arm. The recommended 
radioactivity given by injection is between 110 to 185 MBq (megabequerel or MBq is a unit used to 
measure radioactivity). A single injection is enough. 
Duration of the procedure 
The camera pictures are usually taken 3 to 6 hours after the injection of this medicine. Your nuclear 
medicine doctor will inform you about the usual duration of the procedure. 
After administration of Celsunax, you should urinate frequently in order to eliminate the medicine 
from your body. 
The nuclear medicine doctor will inform you if you need to take any special precautions after receiving 
this medicine. Contact your nuclear medicine doctor, if you have any questions. 
If you are given more Celsunax than you should 
Since Celsunax is given by a doctor under controlled conditions, it is unlikely that you will get an 
overdose. Your nuclear medicine doctor will suggest that you drink plenty of fluids to help the body get 
rid of the medicine. You will need to be careful with the water (urine) that you pass - your doctor will tell 
you what to do. This is normal practice with medicines like Celsunax. Any ioflupane (123I) which 
remains in your body will naturally lose its radioactivity. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your nuclear medicine doctor who 
supervises the procedure.

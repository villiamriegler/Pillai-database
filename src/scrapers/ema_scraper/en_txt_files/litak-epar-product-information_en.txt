CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
LITAK is indicated for the treatment of hairy cell leukaemia. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Therapy with LITAK should be initiated by a qualified physician with experience in cancer 
chemotherapy. 
Posology 
The recommended posology for hairy cell leukaemia is a single course of LITAK given by 
subcutaneous bolus injection at a daily dose of 0.14 mg/kg body weight for 5 consecutive days. 
Deviations from the posology indicated above are not advised.  
Elderly 
Experience with patients older than 65 years is limited. Elderly patients should be treated by individual 
assessment and careful monitoring of the blood counts and of the renal and hepatic function. The risk 
requires assessment on a case-by-case basis (see section 4.4). 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
There are no data on the use of LITAK in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. LITAK is 
contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
≤ 50 ml/min) or with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh score > 6) (see sections 4.3, 
4.4 and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
LITAK is contraindicated in patients less than 18 years of age (see section 4.3). 
Method of administration 
LITAK is supplied as a ready-to-use solution for injection. The recommended dose is directly 
withdrawn by a syringe and injected as a subcutaneous bolus injection without dilution. LITAK should 
be inspected visually for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration. LITAK should 
warm up to room temperature prior to administration.

appropriately. Detailed instructions are contained in the Package Leaflet. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy and lactation. 
Patients less than 18 years of age. 
Moderate to severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance ≤ 50 ml/min) or moderate to severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh score > 6) (see also section 4.4). 
Concomitant use of other myelosuppressive medicinal products. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Cladribine is an antineoplastic and immunosuppressive substance that can induce considerable toxic 
adverse reactions, such as myelo- and immunosuppression, long-lasting lymphocytopenia, and 
opportunistic infections. Patients undergoing treatment with cladribine should be closely monitored for 
signs of haematologic and non-haematologic toxicities. 
Particular caution is advised and risks/benefits should be carefully evaluated if administration of 
cladribine is considered in patients with increased infection risk, manifested bone marrow failure or 
infiltration, myelosuppressive pre-treatments, as well as in patients with suspected or manifested renal 
and hepatic insufficiency. Patients with active infection should be treated for the underlying condition 
prior to receiving therapy with cladribine. Although anti-infective prophylaxis is not generally 
recommended, it may be beneficial for patients immunocompromised prior to therapy with cladribine or 
for patients with a pre-existing agranulocytosis.  
If severe toxicity occurs, the physician should consider delaying or discontinuing the therapy with the 
medicinal product until serious complications resolve. In case of infections, antibiotic treatment should 
be initiated as required. 
It is recommended that patients receiving cladribine should receive irradiated cellular blood 
components/products to prevent transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease (Ta-GVHD). 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
Cases of PML, including fatal cases, have been reported with cladribine. PML was reported 6 months 
to several years after treatment with cladribine. An association with prolonged lymphopenia has been 
reported in several of these cases. Physicians should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in 
patients with new or worsening neurological, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. 
Suggested evaluation for PML includes neurology consultation, magnetic resonance imaging of the 
brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JC virus (JCV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or 
a brain biopsy with testing for JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional follow-
up and evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established. Patients with 
suspected PML should not receive further treatment with cladribine.

Secondary malignancies 
Like other nucleoside analogues, treatment with cladribine is associated with myelosuppression and 
profound and prolonged immunosuppression. Treatment with these agents is associated with the 
occurrence of second malignancies. Secondary malignancies are expected to occur in patients with 
hairy cell leukaemia. Their frequency varies widely, ranging from 2% to 21%. The peak risk is at 2 
years after diagnosis with a median between 40 and 66 months. The cumulative frequencies of second 
malignancy are 5%, 10-12% and 13-14% following 5, 10 and 15 years respectively after diagnosis of 
hairy cell leukaemia. Following cladribine, the incidence of second malignancies ranges from 0% to 
9.5% after a median observation period of 2.8 to 8.5 years. The frequency of second malignancy 
following treatment with LITAK was 3.4% in all 232 hairy cell leukaemia patients treated, during a 
10-year period. The highest incidence of second malignancy with LITAK was 6.5% after a median 
follow-up of 8.4 years. Therefore, patients treated with cladribine should be regularly monitored. 
Haematologic toxicity 
During the first month following treatment, myelosuppression is most notable and red blood cell or 
platelet transfusions may be required. Patients with symptoms of bone marrow depression should be 
treated with caution, since further suppression of bone marrow function should be anticipated. 
Therapeutic risks and benefits should be carefully evaluated in patients with active or suspected 
infections. The risk of severe myelotoxicity and long-lasting immunosuppression is increased in 
patients with a disease-related bone marrow infiltration or a previous myelosuppressive treatment. 
Dose reduction and regular monitoring of the patient is required in such cases. Pancytopenia is 
normally reversible and the intensity of bone marrow aplasia is dose-dependent. An increased 
incidence of opportunistic infections is expected during, and for 6 months following, therapy with 
cladribine. Careful and regular monitoring of peripheral blood counts is essential during, and for 2 to 4 
months following, treatment with cladribine to detect potential adverse reactions and consequent 
complications (anaemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, infections, haemolysis or bleedings), and to 
survey haematologic recovery. Fever of unknown origin frequently occurs in patients treated for hairy 
cell leukaemia and is manifested predominantly during the first 4 weeks of therapy. The origin of 
febrile events should be investigated by appropriate laboratory and radiologic tests. Less than a third 
of febrile events are associated with a documented infection. In case of fever related to infections or 
agranulocytosis, an antibiotic treatment is indicated. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
There are no data on the use of LITAK in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. Clinical experience 
is very limited and safety of LITAK in these patients is not well established (see sections 4.3 and 5.2).  
Careful treatment is required in patients with known or suspected renal or hepatic impairment. For all 
patients treated with LITAK, periodic assessment of renal and hepatic function is advised as clinically 
indicated. 
Elderly 
Elderly patients should be treated by individual assessment and careful monitoring of the blood counts 
and of the renal and hepatic function. The risk requires assessment on a case-by-case basis (see section 
4.2). 
Prevention of tumour lysis syndrome 
In patients with a high tumour burden, prophylactic allopurinol therapy to control serum levels of uric 
acid, together with adequate or increased hydration, should be commenced 24 hours before the start of 
chemotherapy. A daily oral dose of 100 mg of allopurinol is recommended for a period of 2 weeks. In 
case of an accumulation of the serum uric acid above the normal range, the dose of allopurinol may be 
increased to 300 mg/day.  
Fertility 
Men being treated with cladribine should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after 
treatment and to seek advice of cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility 
of infertility due to therapy with cladribine (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Due to a potential increase of haematological toxicity and bone marrow suppression, cladribine must 
not be used concomitantly with other myelosuppressive medicinal products. An influence of cladribine 
on the activity of other antineoplastic agents has not been observed in vitro (e.g. doxorubicin, vincristine, 
cytarabine, cyclophosphamide) and in vivo. However, an in vitro study revealed cross-resistance 
between cladribine and nitrogen mustard (chlormethine); for cytarabine, one author has described an 
in vivo cross-reaction without loss of activity.  
Due to the similar intracellular metabolism, cross-resistance with other nucleoside analogues, such as 
fludarabine or 2’-deoxycoformycin may occur. Therefore, simultaneous administration of nucleoside 
analogues with cladribine is not advisable. 
Corticosteroids have been shown to enhance the risk for severe infections when used in combination 
with cladribine and should not be given concomitantly with cladribine.  
Since interactions with medicinal products undergoing intracellular phosphorylation, such as antiviral 
agents, or with inhibitors of adenosine uptake may be expected, their concomitant use with cladribine 
is not recommended. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Cladribine causes serious birth defects when administered during pregnancy. Animal studies and in vitro 
studies with human cell lines demonstrated the teratogenicity and mutagenicity of cladribine. Cladribine 
is contraindicated in pregnancy.  
Women of childbearing potential must use effective contraception during treatment with cladribine and 
for 6 months after the last cladribine dose. In case of pregnancy during therapy with cladribine, the 
woman should be informed about the potential hazard to the foetus. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether cladribine is excreted in human milk. Because of the potential for serious 
adverse reactions in nursing infants, lactation is contraindicated during treatment with cladribine and 
for 6 months after the last cladribine dose. 
Fertility 
The effects of cladribine on fertility have not been studied in animals. However, a toxicity study 
conducted with cynomolgus monkeys has shown that cladribine suppresses maturation of rapidly 
generating cells, including testicular cells. The effect on human fertility is unknown. Antineoplastic 
agents, such as cladribine, which interfere with DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, might be expected 
to have adverse effects on human gametogenesis (see section 5.3). 
Men being treated with cladribine should be advised not to father a child up to 6 months after 
treatment and to seek advice of cryoconservation of sperm prior to treatment because of the possibility 
of infertility due to therapy with cladribine (see section 4.4). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
LITAK has a major influence on the ability to drive and use machines. In case certain adverse reactions 
with a potential impact on performance occur (e.g. dizziness, very common, or drowsiness, which may 
occur due to anaemia, which is very common), patients should be advised not to drive or use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Very common adverse reactions observed during the three most relevant clinical trials with cladribine 
in 279 patients treated for various indications and in 62 patients with hairy cell leukaemia (HCL) were 
myelosuppression, especially severe neutropenia (41% (113/279), HCL 98% (61/62)), severe 
thrombocytopenia (21% (58/279), HCL 50% (31/62)) and severe anaemia (14% (21/150), HCL 55% 
(34/62)), as well as severe immunosuppression/lymphopenia (63% (176/279), HCL 95% (59/62)), 
infections (39% (110/279), HCL 58% (36/62)) and fever (up to 64%). 
Culture-negative fever following treatment with cladribine occurs in 10-40% of patients with hairy 
cell leukaemia and is rarely observed in patients with other neoplastic disorders. Skin rashes (2-31%) 
are mainly described in patients with other concomitantly administered medicinal products known to 
cause rash (antibiotics and/or allopurinol). Gastrointestinal adverse reactions like nausea (5-28%), 
vomiting (1-13%), and diarrhoea (3-12%) as well as fatigue (2-48%), headache (1-23%), and 
decreased appetite (1-22%) have been reported during treatment with cladribine. Cladribine is unlikely 
to cause alopecia; mild and transient alopecia for a few days was observed in 4/523 patients during the 
treatment, but could not clearly be associated with cladribine.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Adverse reactions that have been reported are listed in the table below by frequency category and 
system organ class. The frequencies are defined as follows: Very common (≥1/10), common (≥1/100

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Non-haematological adverse reactions 
Non-haematological adverse reactions are generally mild to moderate in severity. Treatment of nausea 
with antiemetics is usually not necessary. Adverse reactions related to skin and subcutaneous tissue 
are mostly mild or moderate and transient, usually resolving within a cycle interval of 30 days. 
Blood counts 
Since patients with an active hairy cell leukaemia mostly present with low blood counts, especially 
low neutrophil counts, more than 90% of the cases have transient severe neutropenias (< 1.0 x 109/l). 
The use of haematopoietic growth factors neither improves the recovery of neutrophil counts nor 
decreases the incidence of fever. Severe thrombocytopenias (< 50 x 109/l) are observed in about 20% 
to 30% of all patients. Lymphocytopenia lasting for several months and immunosuppression with an 
increased risk of infections are expected. The recovery of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes and natural killer 
cells occurs within 3 to 12 months. A complete recovery of T-helper cells and B-lymphocytes is 
delayed for up to 2 years. Cladribine induces a severe and prolonged reduction of CD4+ and CD8+ 
T-lymphocytes. At present there exists no experience on possible long-term consequences of this 
immunosuppression. 
Infections 
Severe long-term lymphocytopenias have been reported rarely which, however, could not be 
associated with late infectious complications. Very common severe complications, in some cases with 
fatal outcome, are opportunistic infections (e.g. Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii, listeria, 
candida, herpes viruses, cytomegalovirus and atypical mycobacteria). Forty percent of the patients 
who were treated with LITAK at a dose of 0.7 mg/kg body weight per cycle suffered from infections. 
These were on average more severe than the infections manifested in 27% of all patients receiving a 
reduced dose of 0.5 mg/kg body weight per cycle. Forty-three percent of patients with hairy cell 
leukaemia experienced infectious complications at standard dose regimen. One third of these 
infections have to be considered as severe (e.g. septicaemia, pneumonia). At least 10 cases with acute 
autoimmune haemolytic anaemia have been reported. All patients were successfully treated with 
corticosteroids. 
Rare serious adverse reactions 
Serious adverse reactions like ileus, severe hepatic failure, renal failure, cardiac failure, atrial 
fibrillation, cardiac decompensation, apoplexy, neurological disturbances in speech and swallowing, 
tumour lysis syndrome with acute renal failure, transfusion-related graft-versus-host disease, 
Stevens-Johnson syndrome/Lyell syndrome (toxic epidermal necrolysis), haemolytic anaemia, 
hypereosinophilia (with erythematous skin rash, pruritus, and facial oedema) are rare. 
Fatal outcome 
The majority of deaths related to the medicinal product are due to infectious complications. Further 
rare cases with fatal outcome, reported in association with LITAK chemotherapy, were second 
malignancy, cerebro- and cardiovascular infarctions, graft-versus-host disease caused by multiple 
transfusions of non-irradiated blood, as well as tumour lysis syndrome with hyperuricaemia, metabolic 
acidosis, and acute renal failure. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It allows 
continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare professionals are 
asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

4.9  Overdose 
Frequently observed symptoms of overdose are nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, severe bone marrow 
depression (including anaemia, thrombocytopenia, leukopenia, and agranulocytosis), acute renal 
insufficiency, as well as irreversible neurologic toxicity (paraparesis/quadriparesis), Guillain-Barré 
syndrome, and Brown-Séquard syndrome. Acute, irreversible neuro- and nephrotoxicity have been 
described in individual patients treated at a dose which was ≥ 4 times higher than the recommended 
regimen for hairy cell leukaemia. 
No specific antidote exists. Immediate discontinuation of therapy, careful observation, and initiation of 
appropriate supportive measures (blood transfusions, dialysis, haemofiltration, anti-infectious therapy, 
etc.) are the indicated treatment of overdose of cladribine. Patients who have received an overdose of 
cladribine should be monitored haematologically for at least four weeks. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1    Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Purine analogues, ATC code: L01BB04 
Cladribine is a purine nucleoside analogue acting as an antimetabolite. The single substitution of 
hydrogen for chlorine at position 2 distinguishes cladribine from its natural counterpart 
2'-deoxyadenosine and renders the molecule resistant to deamination by adenosine deaminase. 
Mechanism of action 
Cladribine is a prodrug which is taken up rapidly in cells after parenteral administration, and is 
phosphorylated intracellularly to the active nucleotide 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate 
(CdATP) by deoxycytidine kinase (dCK). An accumulation of active CdATP is observed 
predominantly in cells with a high dCK activity and a low deoxynucleotidase activity, particularly in 
lymphocytes and in other haematopoietic cells. The cytotoxicity of cladribine is dose-dependent. 
Non-haematologic tissues seem to be unaffected, explaining the low incidence of non-haematopoietic 
toxicity of cladribine 
Unlike other nucleoside analogues, cladribine is toxic in rapidly proliferating cells as well as in resting 
cells. No cytotoxic effect of cladribine could be observed in cell lines of solid tumours. The 
mechanism of action of cladribine is attributed to the incorporation of CdATP into DNA strands: the 
synthesis of new DNA in dividing cells is blocked and the DNA repair mechanism is inhibited, 
resulting in an accumulation of DNA strand breaks and a decrease of NAD (nicotinamide adenine 
dinucleotide) and ATP concentration, even in resting cells. Furthermore, CdATP inhibits 
ribonucleotide reductase, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of ribonucleotides into 
deoxyribonucleotides. Cell death occurs from energy depletion and apoptosis. 
Clinical efficacy 
In the clinical trial using LITAK subcutaneously, 63 patients with hairy cell leukaemia (33 newly 
diagnosed patients and 30 patients with relapsed or progressive disease) were treated. The overall 
response rate was 97% with long-lasting remission, with 73% of patients staying in complete remission 
after four years follow-up time. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Cladribine shows complete bioavailability after parenteral administration; the mean area under the 
plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) is comparable after continuous or intermittent 2-hour 
intravenous infusion and after subcutaneous injection.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
After subcutaneous bolus injection of a 0.14 mg/kg cladribine dose, a Cmax of 91 ng/ml is reached on 
average after 20 minutes only. In another study using a dose of 0.10 mg/kg body weight/day, the 
maximum plasma concentration Cmax after continuous intravenous infusion was 5.1 ng/ml (tmax: 12 
hours) compared to 51 ng/ml after subcutaneous bolus injection (tmax: 25 minutes). 
Intracellular concentration of cladribine exceeds its plasma concentration by 128 to 375 times. 
The mean volume of distribution of cladribine is 9.2 l/kg. Plasma protein binding of cladribine is 25% 
on average, with a wide interindividual variation (5-50%). 
Biotransformation 
The prodrug cladribine is metabolised intracellularly, predominantly by deoxycytidine kinase, to 
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-5'-monophosphate, that is further phosphorylated to the diphosphate by 
nucleoside monophosphate kinase and to the active metabolite 
2-chlorodeoxyadenosine-5'-triphosphate (CdATP) by nucleoside diphosphate kinase. 
Elimination 
Pharmacokinetic studies in humans showed that the plasma concentration curve of cladribine fits a 2- 
or 3-compartment model with - and β-half-lives of on average 35 minutes and 6.7 hours, 
respectively. The biexponential decline of the serum concentration of cladribine after subcutaneous 
bolus injection is comparable to elimination parameters after 2-hour intravenous infusion with an 
initial and terminal half-life of approximately 2 hours and 11 hours, respectively. The intracellular 
retention time of cladribine nucleotides in vivo is clearly prolonged as compared to the retention time 
in the plasma: Half-lives t1/2 of initially 15 hours and subsequently more than 30 hours were measured 
in leukaemic cells. 
Cladribine is eliminated mainly by the kidneys. The renal excretion of unmetabolised cladribine 
occurs within 24 hours and accounts for 15% and 18% of the dose after 2-hour intravenous and 
subcutaneous administration, respectively. The fate of the remainder is unknown. The mean plasma 
clearance amounts to 794 ml/min after intravenous infusion and to 814 ml/min after subcutaneous 
bolus injection at a dose of 0.10 mg/kg body weight/day.  
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
There are no studies available using cladribine in patients with renal or hepatic impairment (see also 
section 4.2 and section 4.4). Clinical experience is very limited and safety of LITAK in these patients is 
not well established. LITAK is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal impairment or 
with moderate to severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Paediatric use 
The use of LITAK in children has not been investigated (see section 4.2).  
Elderly 
Experience with patients older than 65 years is limited. Elderly patients should be treated by individual 
assessment and careful monitoring of the blood counts and of the renal and hepatic function. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Cladribine is moderately acutely toxic to mice, with an LD50 of 150 mg/kg by intraperitoneal 
administration. 
In 7- to 14-day continuous intravenous infusion studies in cynomolgus monkeys, the target organs 
were the immune system ( 0.3 mg/kg/day), bone marrow, skin, mucous membranes, nervous system 
and testes ( 0.6 mg/kg/day) and kidneys ( 1 mg/kg/day). Unless fatal, indications were that most or 
all of these effects would be slowly reversible upon cessation of exposure. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Cladribine is teratogenic in mice (at doses of 1.5-3.0 mg/kg/day, given on gestation days 6-15). Effects 
on sternal ossification were seen at 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/day. Increased resorptions, reduced live litter 
sizes, reduced foetal weights and increased foetal malformations of the head, trunk and appendages 
were seen at 3.0 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, cladribine is teratogenic at doses of 3.0 mg/kg/day (given on 
gestation days 7-19). At this dose, severe limb anomalies were seen as well as a significant decrease in 
the mean foetal weight. Reduced ossification was observed at 1.0 mg/kg/day. 
Carcinogenesis/mutagenesis 
Long-term studies in animals to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of cladribine have not been 
conducted. On the basis of available data, no evaluation can be made of the carcinogenic risk of 
cladribine to humans. 
Cladribine is a cytotoxic medicinal product, which is mutagenic to cultured mammalian cells. 
Cladribine is incorporated into DNA strands and inhibits DNA synthesis and repair. Exposure to 
cladribine induces DNA fragmentation and cell death in various normal and leukaemic cells and cell 
lines at concentrations of 5 nM to 20 µM. 
Fertility 
The effects of cladribine on fertility have not been studied in animals. However, a toxicity study 
conducted with cynomolgus monkeys has shown that cladribine suppresses maturation of rapidly 
generating cells, including testicular cells. The effect on human fertility is unknown. Antineoplastic 
agents, such as cladribine, which interfere with DNA, RNA and protein synthesis, might be expected 
to have adverse effects on human gametogenesis (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What LITAK is and what it is used for 
LITAK contains the active substance cladribine. Cladribine is a cytostatic agent. It affects the growth 
of malignant (cancerous) white blood cells which play a role in hairy cell leukaemia. LITAK is used to 
treat this disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you use LITAK

if you are pregnant or breast-feeding 
if you are less than 18 years of age 
if you have moderate to severe kidney or liver impairment 
if you are using other medicines which affect the production of blood cells in the bone marrow 
(myelosuppression). 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before using LITAK. 
At any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you: 
experience blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a change 
in the way you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased sensation or loss 
of sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a serious and potentially 
fatal brain condition known as progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). 
If you had these symptoms prior to treatment with cladribine, tell your doctor about any change in 
these symptoms. 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your doctor if you have or have had: 
- 
- 
liver or kidney problems 
infections  
 
 
if you suffer from an infection, this will be treated before you start using LITAK.  
if you notice any signs of infections (such as flu-like symptoms or fever) during or after 
treatment with LITAK, inform your doctor immediately.  
- 
fever 
Before and during treatment with LITAK, you will have regular blood tests to check whether it is safe 
for you to continue with your treatment. Your doctor may decide that you should receive blood 
transfusions to improve your level of blood cells. In addition, the proper function of your liver and 
your kidneys will be checked.  
If you want to father a child, please tell your doctor before treatment with LITAK is started. You 
should not father a child during treatment and up to 6 months after treatment with LITAK. Your 
doctor may advise you about the possibility to store deep-frozen sperm (cryoconservation). 
Other medicines and LITAK 
Please tell your doctor if you are taking or have recently taken any other medicines, including 
medicines obtained without a prescription. In particular, tell your doctor if you are using any 
medicines containing:  
- 
- 
corticosteroids, commonly used to treat inflammation 
antiviral agents, used to treat viral infections 
You must not use LITAK with other medicines that affect the production of blood cells in the bone 
marrow (myelosuppression). 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Your must not use LITAK if you are pregnant. You must take adequate contraceptive precautions 
during therapy and for at least six months after your last LITAK dose. If pregnancy occurs during your 
treatment, you must immediately inform your doctor. 
You must not breast-feed while you are treated with LITAK and for at least six months after your last 
LITAK dose. 
Driving and using machines 
LITAK has a major effect on the ability to drive and use machines. If you feel drowsy, which may 
occur due to a low number of red blood cells caused by LITAK treatment, or dizzy, you should not 
drive or use machines. 
3. 
How to use LITAK 
Always use LITAK as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure.  
Your doctor will calculate your dose according to your body weight and explain the treatment 
schedule in detail. The recommended daily dose is 0.14 mg per kg body weight for five consecutive 
days (single treatment course). 
LITAK has to be injected under your skin (subcutaneous injection), at about the same time each day. 
If you are injecting LITAK yourself, first you must receive adequate training by your doctor or nurse. 
You will find detailed instructions for injection at the end of this leaflet. 
You may also receive an additional medicine containing the active substance allopurinol in order to 
reduce excess of uric acid.

tell your doctor immediately. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this product, ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, LITAK can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Tell your doctor immediately if you have any of the following during or after treatment with LITAK: 
- 
- 
any signs of infections (such as flu-like symptoms)  
fever 
Repeated occurrence of malignant (cancerous) disease cannot be excluded. This means that the risk 
that you develop a malignant disease in the future is slightly higher than for healthy people. This 
slightly increased risk can be due to hairy cell leukaemia or to therapies used to treat the disease 
including LITAK.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR INJECTION 
This section contains information on how to give an injection of LITAK. It is important that you do 
not try to give yourself the injection unless you have been instructed by your doctor or nurse. Your 
doctor will tell you how much LITAK you need and how often and when you have to inject yourself. 
LITAK should be injected into the tissue just under the skin (subcutaneous injection). If you have any 
question with regard to giving the injection, please ask your doctor or nurse for help. 
LITAK is a cytotoxic and should therefore be handled with caution. When LITAK is not 
self-administered by the patient, the use of disposable gloves and protective garments is recommended 
when handling and administering LITAK. If LITAK contacts the skin or eyes, rinse the involved 
surface immediately with copious amounts of water. Pregnant women must avoid contact with 
LITAK. 
What do I need for the injection? 
To give yourself a subcutaneous injection, you will need: 
one vial of LITAK (or two vials if you need to inject more than 5 ml). 
- 
Do not use vials which are damaged, or if the solution is not clear or if it contains any particles. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
one sterile syringe (e.g. 10 ml LUER syringe), 
one sterile injection needle (e.g. 0.5 x 19 mm, 25 G x ¾’’), 
alcohol wipes, 
a puncture-proof container for safe disposal of the used syringe. 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
What should I do before I give myself a subcutaneous injection of LITAK? 
1. 
Before injection, allow LITAK to warm up to room temperature. 
2.  Wash your hands thoroughly. 
3. 
Find a comfortable, well-lit place and put everything you need where you can reach it. 
How do I prepare the injection? 
Before you inject LITAK, you must do the following: 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Remove the red protective cap from the LITAK vial. Do not remove the rubber stopper of the 
vial. Clean the rubber top of the vial with an alcohol wipe. Remove the syringe from the 
wrapping without touching the tip of the syringe. Remove the injection needle from the 
wrapping and place it firmly on the tip of the syringe. Remove the needle guard without 
touching the needle. 
Push the needle through the rubber stopper of the vial and turn the vial and the syringe upside 
down. Be sure that the tip of the needle is in the solution. 
Draw the correct volume of LITAK into the syringe by pulling back the plunger (your doctor 
will inform you how many ml of LITAK you need to inject). 
4. 
Pull the needle out of the vial. 
5.  Make sure there is no air left in the syringe: point the needle upwards and push the air out. 
6. 
7. 
Check you have the right volume. 
Inject straight away. 
Where should I give my injection? 
  The most suitable places to inject yourself are 
shown here: the top of your thighs and the 
abdomen, except for the area around the navel. 
If someone else is injecting you, they can also 
use the outer surface of the upper arms or the 
buttocks. 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How do I give my injection? 
1. 
Disinfect your skin by using an alcohol wipe, 
wait for the area to dry and pinch the skin 
between your thumb and forefinger, without 
squeezing it. 
2. 
Put the needle fully into the skin at an angle 
of about 45°, as shown in the picture. 
3. 
4. 
5. 
6. 
Pull slightly on the plunger to check that no blood vessel has been punctured. If you see blood 
in the syringe, remove the needle and re-insert it in another place. 
Inject the liquid slowly and evenly for approximately one minute, always keeping the skin 
pinched. 
After injecting the liquid, remove the needle. 
Put the used syringe in the puncture-proof container. Use a new syringe and injection needle for 
each injection. The vials are for single use only. Return any portion of the contents remaining 
after use to your doctor or pharmacist for proper disposal. 
Disposing of used syringes 
Put used syringes into a puncture-proof container and keep it out of the reach and sight of children. 
Dispose the puncture-proof container as instructed by your doctor, nurse or pharmacist. 
Do not put used syringes into the normal household garbage bin.

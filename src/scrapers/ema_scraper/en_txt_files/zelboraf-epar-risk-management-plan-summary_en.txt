SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR ZELBORAF 
(VEMURAFENIB) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Zelboraf.  The RMP details 
important risks of Zelboraf, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Zelboraf’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Zelboraf’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Zelboraf should be 
used.  
This summary of the RMP for Zelboraf should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Zelboraf’s RMP. 
I. THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR 
Zelboraf is authorized for the treatment of adult patients with BRAFV600 mutation-positive 
unresectable or metastatic melanoma.  It contains vemurafenib as the active substance 
and it is given by oral administration. 
Further information about the evaluation of Zelboraf’s benefits can be found in Zelboraf’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage. 
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE 
OR FURTHER CHARACTERISE THE RISKS 
Important risks of Zelboraf, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Zelboraf’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
• 
• 
• 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., with 
or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.  
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) 
assessment, so that immediate action can be taken as necessary.  These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
II.A  LIST OF IMPORTANT RISKS AND MISSING INFORMATION 
Important risks of Zelboraf are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are concerns 
for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Zelboraf.  Potential risks are 
concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on 
available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs further 
evaluation.  Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal 
product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-term use of 
the medicine).

Clinical trial data and DSR 1058568. 
There are no identified risk factors for the occurrence of “liver injury” 
AEs in vemurafenib-treated patients.  Baseline values of liver function 
tests were not a significant covariate in the population pharmacokinetic 
analysis for predicting elevated liver function values on treatment.

Section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) 
Routine risk minimization activities recommending specific 
clinical measures to address the risk: 
Liver enzymes (transaminases and alkaline phosphatase) and bilirubin 
should be measured before initiation of treatment and monitored 
monthly during treatment, or as clinically indicated. Laboratory 
abnormalities should be managed with dose reduction, treatment 
interruption or with treatment discontinuation (see sections 4.2 and 
4.8). This has been adequately captured in Section 4.4of EU SmPC.

Important identified risk: QTc Prolongation 
Evidence for linking

Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Clinical trial data. 
In the general population, QTc prolongation appears to occur more 
frequently in females.  Inherited genetic polymorphisms or mutations 
with low penetrance, involving the same gene loci associated with 
phenotypically expressed long-QT syndrome, may underlie individual 
idiosyncrasies to the acquired form in many, if not most, cases.  Some 
individuals have QT prolongation throughout life without any manifest 
arrhythmias, while others are highly susceptible to symptomatic 
arrhythmias, particularly torsades de pointes (Braunwald's heart 
disease: a textbook of cardiovascular medicine). There were no other 
risk factors or risk groups identified with vemurafenib use.

Routine risk minimization activities recommending specific 
clinical measures to address the risk: 
Electrocardiogram (ECG) and electrolytes (including magnesium) must 
be monitored Initiation of treatment with vemurafenib is not 
recommended in patients with QTc>500 milliseconds (ms). Re-
initiation of treatment should occur once the QTc decreases below 500 
ms and at a lower dose. Permanent discontinuation of vemurafenib 
treatment is recommended if the QTc increase meets values of both 
>500 ms and >60 ms change from pre-treatment values. This has been 
adequately captured in Section 4.4 of EU SmPC.

Important potential risk: Non-cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine 
Several cases of non-cutaneous SCC were reported in the clinical 
trials, while no disproportionality was observed in the randomized 
clinical trial.  
Risk factors and 
risk groups 
Individuals with one malignancy have an increased risk of developing a 
second malignancy. Since cuSCC has been observed in melanoma 
patients receiving vemurafenib, it was considered appropriate to 
monitor for the occurrence of such carcinomas in other sites.

Patients should undergo a head and neck examination prior to initiation 
of treatment and every 3 months during treatment. In addition, patients 
should undergo a chest Computerised Tomography (CT) scan, prior to 
treatment and every 6 months during treatment. Anal examinations and 
pelvic examinations (for women) are recommended before and at the 
end of treatment or when considered clinically indicated. This has been 
adequately captured in Section 4.4of EU SmPC.

Important potential risk: Drug-drug Interaction 
Evidence for linking

Because there is a lack of information regarding DDIs the following 
clinical studies will be the evidence source in addition to the DDI study 
NP22676 and in vitro study of potential effect of vemurafenib on 
CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8 and CYP2E1 activity: GO29475: Steady-
state interaction study with itraconazole (CYP3A4 inhibitor) GO28052: 
Interaction study with rifampicin. This study evaluated the effect of 
rifampicin on the PK of a single oral 960 mg dose of vemurafenib. Co-
administration of rifampicin (CYP3A4 inducer and of glucuronidation) 
decreased plasma exposure of a single 960 mg vemurafenib by 
approximately 40%. Interaction study (GO28396) with tizanidine 
(CYP1A2), multiple oral doses of vemurafenib increased single-dose 
tizanidine exposure approximately 4.2-, 4.7-, and 2.2-fold in AUClast, 
AUCinf, and Cmax, respectively. An in vitro study to evaluate the 
potential effect of vemurafenib to inhibit CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, 
and CYP2E1 was performed. Neither CYP2A6, CYP2B6 nor CYP2E1-
selective activities of human liver microsomes tested were strongly 
inhibited by vemurafenib. In each case, IC50 values were >100 μM. 
Vemurafenib was shown to inhibit CYP2C8 with an IC50 value of 
approximately 12μM. Based on these observations, vemurafenib is 
unlikely to cause clinically relevant inhibition of cytochrome CYP450s 
CYP2A6, CYP2B6 nor CYP2E1 in vivo. In contrast, vemurafenib was 
found to inhibit microsomal CYP2C8 activity which could potentially 
impact exposure of concomitant drugs whose major clearance route 
relies on this enzymatic pathway. Clinical drug interaction Study 
GO28394 using a P-gp substrate drug (digoxin) demonstrated that 
multiple oral doses of vemurafenib (960 mg twice daily) increased the 
exposure of a single oral dose of digoxin, with an approximately 1.8 
and 1.5 fold increase in digoxin AUClast and Cmax, respectively. 
Additionally, in vitro inhibition and substrate properties of vemurafenib 
for human in breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), bile salt export 
pump (BSEP), and multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP2) 
transport proteins were investigated. Results confirm that vemurafenib 
is an inhibitor of human BCRP and BSEP in vitro. The substrate 
potential of vemurafenib for BCRP was tested using a cellbased 
monolayer assay system. The results showed that vemurafenib was 
actively effluxed by MDCKII-BCRP cells, confirming that it is a 
substrate of human BCRP in vitro (Report 1052335). The substrate 
potential for MRP2 and BSEP was not assessed using this assay due 
to the lack of availability of MRP2 and BSEP expressing cell lines. It 
was concluded that, vemurafenib may have the potential for BCRP 
mediated DDI when co-administered with other BCRP substrates or 
Important potential risk: Drug-drug Interaction 
inhibitors. An in vitro assessment of the substrate potential for human 
MRP2 transport protein was also performed. Experiments with MRP2 
single and MRP2 / OATP1B1 double transfected cells revealed that 
vemurafenib is not a substrate of human MRP2 in vitro. Therefore, in 
vivo DDIs are not expected when co-medicating vemurafenib with 
inhibitors of MRP2 (Report 1054797). 
Risk factors and

measures 
Routine risk communication: 
SmPC: 
Section 4.4 (Special warnings and precautions for use) 
Section 4.5 (Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms 
of interaction) 
Routine risk minimization activities recommending specific 
clinical measures to address the risk: 
Exercise caution and consider additional INR (International Normalised 
Ratio) monitoring when vemurafenib is used concomitantly with 
warfarin. Caution should be exercised, dose reduction and/or additional 
drug level monitoring for P-gp substrate medicinal products with narrow 
therapeutic index (NTI) (e.g. digoxin, dabigatran etexilate, aliskiren) 
may be considered if these medicinal products are used concomitantly 
with vemurafenib. This has been adequately captured in Section 4.4 
and 4.5 of EU SmPC.

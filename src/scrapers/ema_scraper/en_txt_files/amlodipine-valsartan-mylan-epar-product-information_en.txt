The recommended dose of Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan is one tablet per day. 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 5 mg/80 mg film-coated tablets 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 5 mg/80 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is not 
adequately controlled with amlodipine 5 mg or valsartan 80 mg alone. 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 5 mg/160 mg film-coated tablets 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 5 mg/160 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is 
not adequately controlled with amlodipine 5 mg or valsartan 160 mg alone. 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 10 mg/160 mg film-coated tablets 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 10 mg/160 mg may be administered in patients whose blood pressure is 
not adequately controlled with amlodipine 10 mg or valsartan 160 mg alone or with 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 5 mg/160 mg. 
Individual dose titration with the components (i.e. amlodipine and valsartan) is recommended before 
changing to the fixed dose combination. When clinically appropriate, direct change from monotherapy 
to the fixed-dose combination may be considered. 
For convenience, patients receiving valsartan and amlodipine from separate tablets/capsules may be 
switched to Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan containing the same component doses. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment  
There are no available clinical data in severely renally impaired patients.  
No dose adjustment is required for patients with mild to moderate renal impairment. Monitoring of 
potassium levels and creatinine is advised in moderate renal impairment.  
Hepatic impairment  
Amlodipine/valsartan is contraindicated in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see section 4.3). 
Caution should be exercised when administering amlodipine/valsartan to patients with hepatic impairment 
or biliary obstructive disorders (see section 4.4). In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment 
without cholestasis, the maximum recommended dose is 80 mg valsartan. Amlodipine dosage 
recommendations have not been established in patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment. When 
switching eligible hypertensive patients (see section 4.1) with hepatic impairment to amlodipine or 
amlodipine/valsartan, the lowest available dose of amlodipine monotherapy or of the amlodipine 
component, respectively, should be used. 
Elderly (age 65 years or over)  
In elderly patients, caution is required when increasing the dosage. When switching eligible elderly 
hypertensive patients (see section 4.1) to amlodipine or amlodipine/valsartan, the lowest available 
dose of amlodipine monotherapy or of the amlodipine component, respectively, should be used. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of amlodipine/valsartan in children aged below 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
Oral use. 
It is recommended to take Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan with some water. The medicinal product can 
be used with or without food.

Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to dihydropyridine derivatives, or to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Severe hepatic impairment, biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis.  
Concomitant use of Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan with aliskiren-containing medicinal products 
in patients with diabetes mellitus or renal impairment (GFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2) (see sections 
4.5 and 5.1).  
Second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 4.6).  
Severe hypotension.  
Shock (including cardiogenic shock).  
Obstruction of the outflow tract of the left ventricle (e.g. hypertrophic obstructive 
cardiomyopathy and high grade aortic stenosis).  
Haemodynamically unstable heart failure after acute myocardial infarction.  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
The safety and efficacy of amlodipine in hypertensive crisis have not been established.  
Pregnancy  
Angiotensin II Receptor Antagonists (AIIRAs) should not be initiated during pregnancy. Unless 
continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, patients planning pregnancy should be changed to 
alternative antihypertensive treatments which have an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. 
When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if 
appropriate, alternative therapy should be started (see sections 4.3 and 4.6).  
Sodium- and/or volume-depleted patients  
Excessive hypotension was seen in 0.4 % of patients with uncomplicated hypertension treated with 
amlodipine/valsartan in placebo-controlled studies. In patients with an activated renin-angiotensin 
system (such as volume- and/or salt-depleted patients receiving high doses of diuretics) who are 
receiving angiotensin receptor blockers, symptomatic hypotension may occur. Correction of this 
condition prior to administration of amlodipine/valsartan or close medical supervision at the start of 
treatment is recommended.  
If hypotension occurs with amlodipine/valsartan, the patient should be placed in the supine position 
and, if necessary, given an intravenous infusion of normal sodium chloride solution. Treatment can be 
continued once blood pressure has been stabilised.  
Hyperkalaemia 
Concomitant use with potassium supplements, potassium-sparing diuretics, salt substitutes containing 
potassium, or other medicinal products that may increase potassium levels (heparin, etc.) should be 
undertaken with caution and with frequent monitoring of potassium levels.  
Renal artery stenosis  
Amlodipine/valsartan should be used with caution to treat hypertension in patients with unilateral or 
bilateral renal artery stenosis or stenosis to a solitary kidney since blood urea and serum creatinine 
may increase in such patients.  
Kidney transplantation  
To date there is no experience of the safe use of amlodipine/valsartan in patients who have had a 
recent kidney transplantation.  
Hepatic impairment  
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Valsartan is mostly eliminated unchanged via the bile. The half-life of amlodipine is prolonged and 
AUC values are higher in patients with impaired liver function; dosage recommendations have not 
been established. Particular caution should be exercised when administering amlodipine/valsartan to 
patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment or biliary obstructive disorders.  
In patients with mild to moderate hepatic impairment without cholestasis, the maximum recommended 
dose is 80 mg valsartan.  
Renal impairment  
No dosage adjustment of amlodipine/valsartan is required for patients with mild to moderate renal 
impairment (GFR >30 ml/min/1.73 m2). Monitoring of potassium levels and creatinine is advised in 
moderate renal impairment.  
Primary hyperaldosteronism  
Patients with primary hyperaldosteronism should not be treated with the angiotensin II antagonist 
valsartan as their renin-angiotensin system is affected by the primary disease.  
Angioedema  
Angioedema, including swelling of the larynx and glottis, causing airway obstruction and/or swelling 
of the face, lips, pharynx and/or tongue, has been reported in patients treated with valsartan. Some of 
these patients previously experienced angioedema with other medicinal products, including 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Amlodipine/valsartan should be discontinued 
immediately in patients who develop angioedema and should not be re-administered.  
Heart failure/post-myocardial infarction  
As a consequence of the inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, changes in renal 
function may be anticipated in susceptible individuals. In patients with severe heart failure whose 
renal function may depend on the activity of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, treatment with 
ACE inhibitors and angiotensin receptor antagonists has been associated with oliguria and/or 
progressive azotaemia and (rarely) with acute renal failure and/or death. Similar outcomes have been 
reported with valsartan. Evaluation of patients with heart failure or post-myocardial infarction should 
always include assessment of renal function.  
In a long-term, placebo-controlled study (PRAISE-2) of amlodipine in patients with NYHA (New 
York Heart Association Classification) III and IV heart failure of non-ischaemic aetiology, amlodipine 
was associated with increased reports of pulmonary oedema despite no significant difference in the 
incidence of worsening heart failure as compared to placebo.  
Calcium channel blockers, including amlodipine, should be used with caution in patients with 
congestive heart failure, as they may increase the risk of future cardiovascular events and mortality.  
Aortic and mitral valve stenosis 
As with all other vasodilators, special caution is indicated in patients suffering from mitral stenosis or 
significant aortic stenosis that is not high grade.  
Dual blockade of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)  
There is evidence that the concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) 
or aliskiren increases the risk of hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including 
acute renal failure). Dual blockade of RAAS through the combined use of ACE inhibitors, ARBs or 
aliskiren is therefore not recommended (see sections 4.5 and 5.1).  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If dual blockade therapy is considered absolutely necessary, this should only occur under specialist 
supervision and subject to frequent close monitoring of renal function, electrolytes and blood pressure. 
ACE inhibitors and ARBs should not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic nephropathy.  
Amlodipine/valsartan has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interactions common to the combination  
No interaction studies have been performed. 
To be taken into account with concomitant use  
Other antihypertensive agents  
Commonly used antihypertensive agents (e.g. alpha blockers, diuretics) and other medicinal products 
which may cause hypotensive adverse reaction (e.g. tricyclic antidepressants, alpha blockers for 
treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia) may increase the antihypertensive effect of the combination.  
Interactions linked to amlodipine  
Concomitant use not recommended  
Grapefruit or grapefruit juice  
Administration of amlodipine with grapefruit or grapefruit juice is not recommended as bioavailability 
may be increased in some patients, resulting in increased blood pressure lowering effects.  
Caution required with concomitant use  
CYP3A4 inhibitors  
Concomitant use of amlodipine with strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (protease inhibitors, azole 
antifungals, macrolides like erythromycin or clarithromycin, verapamil or diltiazem) may give rise to 
significant increase in amlodipine exposure. The clinical translation of these pharmacokinetic 
variations may be more pronounced in the elderly. Clinical monitoring and dose adjustment may thus 
be required.  
CYP3A4 inducers (anticonvulsant agents [e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
fosphenytoin, primidone], rifampicin, Hypericum perforatum)  
Upon co-administration of known inducers of the CYP3A4, the plasma concentration of amlodipine 
may vary. Therefore, blood pressure should be monitored and dose regulation considered both during 
and after concomitant medicinal product particularly with strong CYP3A4 inducers (e.g. rifampicin, 
hypericum perforatum). 
Simvastatin  
Co-administration of multiple doses of 10 mg amlodipine with 80 mg simvastatin resulted in a 77 % 
increase in exposure to simvastatin compared to simvastatin alone. It is recommended to limit the dose 
of simvastatin to 20 mg daily in patients on amlodipine.  
Dantrolene (infusion)  
In animals, lethal ventricular fibrillation and cardiovascular collapse are observed in association with 
hyperkalaemia after administration of verapamil and intravenous dantrolene. Due to risk of 
hyperkalaemia, it is recommended that the co-administration of calcium channel blockers such as 
amlodipine be avoided in patients susceptible to malignant hyperthermia and in the management of 
malignant hyperthermia.

To be taken into account with concomitant use  
Others  
In clinical interaction studies, amlodipine did not affect the pharmacokinetics of atorvastatin, digoxin, 
warfarin or ciclosporin.  
Interactions linked to valsartan  
Concomitant use not recommended  
Lithium  
Reversible increases in serum lithium concentrations and toxicity have been reported during 
concomitant administration of lithium with angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II 
receptor antagonists, including valsartan. Therefore, careful monitoring of serum lithium levels is 
recommended during concomitant use. If a diurectic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may 
presumably be increased further with amlodipine/valsartan.  
Potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and other 
substances that may increase potassium levels  
If a medicinal product that affects potassium levels is to be prescribed in combination with valsartan, 
monitoring of potassium plasma levels is advised.  
Caution required with concomitant use  
Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAIDs), including selective COX-2 inhibitors, acetylsalicylic 
acid (>3 g/day), and non-selective NSAIDs  
When angiotensin II antagonists are administered simultaneously with NSAIDs attenuation of the 
antihypertensive effect may occur. Furthermore, concomitant use of angiotensin II antagonists and 
NSAIDs may lead to an increased risk of worsening of renal function and an increase in serum 
potassium. Therefore, monitoring of renal function at the beginning of the treatment is recommended, 
as well as adequate hydration of the patient.  
Inhibitors of the uptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter (ritonavir)  
The results of an in vitro study with human liver tissue indicate that valsartan is a substrate of the 
hepatic uptake transporter OATP1B1 and of the hepatic efflux transporter MRP2. Co-administration 
of inhibitors of the uptake transporter (rifampicin, ciclosporin) or efflux transporter (ritonavir) may 
increase the systemic exposure to valsartan.  
Dual blockade of the RAAS with ARBs, ACE inhibitors or aliskiren  
Clinical trial data have shown that dual blockade of the RAAS through the combined use of ACE 
inhibitors, ARBs or aliskiren is associated with a higher frequency of adverse events such as 
hypotension, hyperkalaemia and decreased renal function (including acute renal failure) compared to 
the use of a single RAAS-acting agent (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1).  
Others  
In monotherapy with valsartan, no interactions of clinical significance have been found with the 
following substances: cimetidine, warfarin, furosemide, digoxin, atenolol, indometacin, 
hydrochlorothiazide, amlodipine, glibenclamide. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
Amlodipine 
The safety of amlodipine in human pregnancy has not been established. In animal studies, 
reproductive toxicity was observed at high doses (see section 5.3). Use in pregnancy is only 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recommended when there is no safer alternative and when the disease itself carries greater risk for the 
mother and foetus.  
Valsartan  
The use of AIIRAs is not recommended during the first trimester of pregnancy (see section 4.4). The 
use of AIIRAs is contraindicated during the second and third trimesters of pregnancy (see sections 4.3 
and 4.4).  
Epidemiological evidence regarding the risk of teratogenicity following exposure to ACE inhibitors 
during the first trimester of pregnancy has not been conclusive; however a small increase in risk 
cannot be excluded. Whilst there is no controlled epidemiological data on the risk with AIIRAs, 
similar risks may exist for this class of drugs. Unless continued AIIRA therapy is considered essential, 
patients planning pregnancy should be changed to alternative antihypertensive treatments which have 
an established safety profile for use in pregnancy. When pregnancy is diagnosed, treatment with 
AIIRAs should be stopped immediately, and, if appropriate, alternative therapy should be started.  
Exposure to AIIRA therapy during the second and third trimesters is known to induce human 
foetotoxicity (decreased renal function, oligohydramnios, skull ossification retardation) and neonatal 
toxicity (renal failure, hypotension, hyperkalaemia) (see section 5.3).  
Should exposure to AIIRAs have occurred from the second trimester of pregnancy, ultrasound check 
of renal function and skull is recommended.  
Infants whose mothers have taken AIIRAs should be closely observed for hypotension (see sections 
4.3 and 4.4). 
Breast-feeding 
Amlodipine is excreted in human milk. The proportion of the maternal dose received by the infant has 
been estimated with an interquartile range of 3 – 7%, with a maximum of 15%. The effect of 
amlodipine/valsartan on infants is unknown. No information is available regarding the use of 
amlodipine/valsartan during breast-feeding. Therefore Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan is not 
recommended and alternative treatments with better established safety profiles during breast-feeding 
are preferable, especially while nursing a newborn or preterm infant. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical studies on fertility with amlodipine/valsartan.  
Valsartan  
Valsartan had no adverse effects on the reproductive performance of male or female rats at oral doses 
up to 200 mg/kg/day. This dose is 6 times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis 
(calculations assume an oral dose of 320 mg/day and a 60 kg patient).  
Amlodipine  
Reversible biochemical changes in the head of spermatozoa have been reported in some patients 
treated by calcium channel blockers. Clinical data are insufficient regarding the potential effect of 
amlodipine on fertility. In one rat study, adverse effects were found on male fertility (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Patients taking amlodipine/valsartan and driving vehicles or using machines should take into account 
that dizziness or weariness may occasionally occur.  
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Amlodipine can have mild or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. If patients 
taking amlodipine suffer from dizziness, headache, fatigue or nausea the ability to react may be 
impaired. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
The safety of amlodipine/valsartan has been evaluated in five controlled clinical studies with 5,175 
patients, 2,613 of whom received valsartan in combination with amlodipine. The following adverse 
reactions were found to be the most frequently occurring or the most significant or severe: 
nasopharyngitis, influenza, hypersensitivity, headache, syncope, orthostatic hypotension, oedema, 
pitting oedema, facial oedema, oedema peripheral, fatigue, flushing, asthenia and hot flush.  
Tabulated list of adverse reactions  
Adverse reactions have been ranked under headings of frequency using the following convention: very 
common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Additional information on the combination  
Peripheral oedema, a recognised adverse reaction of amlodipine, was generally observed at a lower 
incidence in patients who received the amlodipine/valsartan combination than in those who received 
amlodipine alone. In double-blind, controlled clinical trials, the incidence of peripheral oedema by

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare

professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms  
There is no experience of overdose with amlodipine/valsartan. The major symptom of overdose with 
valsartan is possibly pronounced hypotension with dizziness. Overdose with amlodipine may result in 
excessive peripheral vasodilation and, possibly, reflex tachycardia. Marked and potentially prolonged 
systemic hypotension up to and including shock with fatal outcome have been reported.  
Non-cardiogenic pulmonary oedema has rarely been reported as a consequence of amlodipine 
overdose that may manifest with a delayed onset (24-48 hours post-ingestion) and require ventilatory 
support. Early resuscitative measures (including fluid overload) to maintain perfusion and cardiac 
output may be precipitating factors. 
Treatment  
If ingestion is recent, induction of vomiting or gastric lavage may be considered. Administration of 
activated charcoal to healthy volunteers immediately or up to two hours after ingestion of amlodipine 
has been shown to significantly decrease amlodipine absorption. Clinically significant hypotension 
due to amlodipine/valsartan overdose calls for active cardiovascular support, including frequent 
monitoring of cardiac and respiratory function, elevation of extremities, and attention to circulating 
fluid volume and urine output. A vasoconstrictor may be helpful in restoring vascular tone and blood 
pressure, provided that there is no contraindication to its use. Intravenous calcium gluconate may be 
beneficial in reversing the effects of calcium channel blockade.  
Both valsartan and amlodipine are unlikely to be removed by haemodialysis. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Agents acting on the renin-angiotensin system; angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARBs), combinations; angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) and calcium channel 
blockers, ATC code: C09DB01  
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan combines two antihypertensive compounds with complementary 
mechanisms to control blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension: amlodipine belongs to 
the calcium antagonist class and valsartan to the angiotensin II antagonist class of medicinal products. 
The combination of these substances has an additive antihypertensive effect, reducing blood pressure 
to a greater degree than either component alone.  
Amlodipine/Valsartan  
The combination of amlodipine and valsartan produces dose-related additive reduction in blood 
pressure across its therapeutic dose range. The antihypertensive effect of a single dose of the 
combination persisted for 24 hours.  
Placebo-controlled trials  
Over 1,400 hypertensive patients received amlodipine/valsartan once daily in two placebo-controlled 
trials. Adults with mild to moderate uncomplicated essential hypertension (mean sitting diastolic blood 
pressure ≥95 and <110 mmHg) were enrolled. Patients with high cardiovascular risks – heart failure, 
type I and poorly controlled type II diabetes and history of myocardial infarction or stroke within one 
year – were excluded.  
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Active-controlled trials in patients who were non-responders to monotherapy  
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation 
of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients 
not adequately controlled on valsartan 160 mg in 75 % of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan 
10 mg/160 mg and 62 % of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan 5 mg/160 mg, compared to 
53 % of patients remaining on valsartan 160 mg. The addition of amlodipine 10 mg and 5 mg 
produced an additional reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 6.0/4.8 mmHg and 
3.9/2.9 mmHg, respectively, compared to patients who remained on valsartan 160 mg only.  
A multicentre, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled, parallel-group trial showed normalisation 
of blood pressure (trough sitting diastolic blood pressure <90 mmHg at the end of the trial) in patients 
not adequately controlled on amlodipine 10 mg in 78 % of patients treated with amlodipine/valsartan 
10 mg/160 mg, compared to 67 % of patients remaining on amlodipine 10 mg. The addition of 
valsartan 160 mg produced an additional reduction in systolic/diastolic blood pressure of 
2.9/2.1 mmHg compared to patients who remained on amlodipine 10 mg only.  
Amlodipine/valsartan was also studied in an active-controlled study of 130 hypertensive patients with 
mean sitting diastolic blood pressure ≥110 mmHg and <120 mmHg. In this study (baseline blood 
pressure 171/113 mmHg), an amlodipine/valsartan regimen of 5 mg/160 mg titrated to 10 mg/160 mg 
reduced sitting blood pressure by 36/29 mmHg as compared to 32/28 mmHg with a regimen of 
lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide 10 mg/12.5 mg titrated to 20 mg/12.5 mg.  
In two long-term follow-up studies the effect of amlodipine/valsartan was maintained for over one 
year. Abrupt withdrawal of amlodipine/valsartan has not been associated with a rapid increase in 
blood pressure.  
Age, gender, race or body mass index (≥30 kg/m2, <30 kg/m2) did not influence the response to 
amlodipine/valsartan.  
Amlodipine/valsartan has not been studied in any patient population other than hypertension. 
Valsartan has been studied in patients with post myocardial infarction and heart failure. Amlodipine 
has been studied in patients with chronic stable angina, vasospastic angina and angiographically 
documented coronary artery disease.  
Amlodipine  
The amlodipine component of Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan inhibits the transmembrane entry of 
calcium ions into cardiac and vascular smooth muscle. The mechanism of the antihypertensive action 
of amlodipine is due to a direct relaxant effect on vascular smooth muscle, causing reductions in 
peripheral vascular resistance and in blood pressure. Experimental data suggest that amlodipine binds 
to both dihydropyridine and non-dihydropyridine binding sites. The contractile processes of cardiac 
muscle and vascular smooth muscle are dependent upon the movement of extracellular calcium ions 
into these cells through specific ion channels.  
Following administration of therapeutic doses to patients with hypertension, amlodipine produces 
vasodilation, resulting in a reduction of supine and standing blood pressures. These decreases in blood 
pressure are not accompanied by a significant change in heart rate or plasma catecholamine levels with 
chronic dosing.  
Plasma concentrations correlate with effect in both young and elderly patients.  
In hypertensive patients with normal renal function, therapeutic doses of amlodipine resulted in a 
decrease in renal vascular resistance and an increase in glomerular filtration rate and effective renal 
plasma flow, without change in filtration fraction or proteinuria.  
As with other calcium channel blockers, haemodynamic measurements of cardiac function at rest and 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
during exercise (or pacing) in patients with normal ventricular function treated with amlodipine have 
generally demonstrated a small increase in cardiac index without significant influence on dP/dt or on 
left ventricular end diastolic pressure or volume. In haemodynamic studies, amlodipine has not been 
associated with a negative inotropic effect when administered in the therapeutic dose range to intact 
animals and humans, even when co-administered with beta blockers to humans.  
Amlodipine does not change sinoatrial nodal function or atrioventricular conduction in intact animals 
or humans. In clinical studies in which amlodipine was administered in combination with beta 
blockers to patients with either hypertension or angina, no adverse effects on electrocardiographic 
parameters were observed.  
Use in patients with hypertension  
A randomised double-blind morbidity-mortality study called the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering 
treatment to prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) was performed to compare newer therapies: 
amlodipine 2.5-10 mg/day (calcium channel blocker) or lisinopril 10-40 mg/day (ACE-inhibitor) as 
first-line therapies to that of the thiazide-diuretic, chlorthalidone 12.5-25 mg/day in mild to moderate 
hypertension.  
A total of 33,357 hypertensive patients aged 55 or older were randomised and followed for a mean of 
4.9  years. The patients had at least one additional coronary heart disease risk factor, including: 
previous myocardial infarction or stroke (>6 months prior to enrollment) or documentation of other 
atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (overall 51.5 %), type 2 diabetes (36.1 %), high density 
lipoprotein - cholesterol <35 mg/dl or <0.906 mmol/l (11.6 %), left ventricular hypertrophy diagnosed 
by electrocardiogram or echocardiography (20.9 %), current cigarette smoking (21.9 %).  
The primary endpoint was a composite of fatal coronary heart disease or non-fatal myocardial 
infarction. There was no significant difference in the primary endpoint between amlodipine-based 
therapy and chlorthalidone-based therapy: risk ratio (RR) 0.98 95 % CI (0.90-1.07) p=0.65. Among 
secondary endpoints, the incidence of heart failure (component of a composite combined 
cardiovascular endpoint) was significantly higher in the amlodipine group as compared to the 
chlorthalidone group (10.2 % versus 7.7 %, RR 1.38, 95 % CI [1.25-1.52] p<0.001). However, there 
was no significant difference in all-cause mortality between amlodipine-based therapy and 
chlorthalidone-based therapy RR 0.96 95 % CI [0.89-1.02] p=0.20.  
Valsartan  
Valsartan is an orally active, potent and specific angiotensin II receptor antagonist. It acts selectively 
on the receptor subtype AT1, which is responsible for the known actions of angiotensin II. The 
increased plasma levels of angiotensin II following AT1 receptor blockade with valsartan may 
stimulate the unblocked receptor subtype AT2, which appears to counterbalance the effect of the AT1 
receptor. Valsartan does not exhibit any partial agonist activity at the AT1 receptor and has much 
(about 20,000-fold) greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than for the AT2 receptor.  
Valsartan does not inhibit ACE, also known as kininase II, which converts angiotensin I to angiotensin 
II and degrades bradykinin. Since there is no effect on ACE and no potentiation of bradykinin or 
substance P, angiotensin II antagonists are unlikely to be associated with coughing. In clinical trials 
where valsartan was compared with an ACE inhibitor, the incidence of dry cough was significantly (p 
<0.05) lower in patients treated with valsartan than in those treated with an ACE inhibitor (2.6 % 
versus 7.9 %, respectively). In a clinical trial of patients with a history of dry cough during ACE 
inhibitor therapy, 19.5 % of trial subjects receiving valsartan and 19.0 % of those receiving a thiazide 
diuretic experienced coughing, compared to 68.5 % of those treated with an ACE inhibitor (p <0.05). 
Valsartan does not bind to or block other hormone receptors or ion channels known to be important in 
cardiovascular regulation.  
Administration of valsartan to patients with hypertension results in a drop in blood pressure without 
affecting pulse rate.  
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In most patients, after administration of a single oral dose, onset of antihypertensive activity occurs 
within 2 hours, and the peak drop in blood pressure is achieved within 4–6 hours. The antihypertensive 
effect persists over 24 hours after administration. During repeated administration, the maximum 
reduction in blood pressure with any dose is generally attained within 2–4 weeks and is sustained 
during long-term therapy. Abrupt withdrawal of valsartan has not been associated with rebound 
hypertension or other adverse clinical events.  
Other: dual blockade of the RAAS 
Two large randomised, controlled trials (ONTARGET [ONgoing Telmisartan Alone and in 
combination with Ramipril Global Endpoint Trial] and VA NEPHRON-D [The Veterans Affairs 
Nephropathy in Diabetes]) have examined the use of the combination of an ACE inhibitor with an 
ARB.  
ONTARGET was a study conducted in patients with a history of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular 
disease, or type 2 diabetes mellitus accompanied by evidence of end-organ damage. VA 
NEPHRON-D was a study in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and diabetic nephropathy.  
These studies have shown no significant beneficial effect on renal and/or cardiovascular outcomes and 
mortality, while an increased risk of hyperkalaemia, acute kidney injury and/or hypotension as 
compared to monotherapy was observed. Given their similar pharmacodynamic properties, these 
results are also relevant for other ACE inhibitors and ARBs.  
ACE inhibitors and ARBs should therefore not be used concomitantly in patients with diabetic 
nephropathy (see section 4.4).  
ALTITUDE (Aliskiren Trial in Type 2 Diabetes Using Cardiovascular and Renal Disease Endpoints) 
was a study designed to test the benefit of adding aliskiren to a standard therapy of an ACE inhibitor 
or an ARB in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and chronic kidney disease, cardiovascular 
disease, or both. The study was terminated early because of an increased risk of adverse outcomes. 
Cardiovascular death and stroke were both numerically more frequent in the aliskiren group than in 
the placebo group and adverse events and serious adverse events of interest (hyperkalaemia, 
hypotension and renal dysfunction) were more frequently reported in the aliskiren group than in the 
placebo group. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Linearity  
Amlodipine and valsartan exhibit linear pharmacokinetics.  
Amlodipine/Valsartan  
Following oral administration of amlodipine/valsartan, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan and 
amlodipine are reached in 3 and 6–8 hours, respectively. The rate and extent of absorption of 
amlodipine/valsartan are equivalent to the bioavailability of valsartan and amlodipine when 
administered as individual tablets.  
Amlodipine  
Absorption 
After oral administration of therapeutic doses of amlodipine alone, peak plasma concentrations of 
amlodipine are reached in 6–12 hours. Absolute bioavailability has been calculated as between 64 % 
and 80 %. Amlodipine bioavailability is unaffected by food ingestion.  
Distribution 
Volume of distribution is approximately 21 L/kg. In vitro studies with amlodipine have shown that 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
approximately 97.5 % of circulating drug is bound to plasma proteins.  
Biotransformation 
Amlodipine is extensively (approximately 90 %) metabolised in the liver to inactive metabolites.  
Elimination 
Amlodipine elimination from plasma is biphasic, with a terminal elimination half-life of 
approximately 30 to 50 hours. Steady-state plasma levels are reached after continuous administration 
for 7–8  days. Ten per cent of original amlodipine and 60 % of amlodipine metabolites are excreted in 
urine.  
Valsartan  
Absorption 
Following oral administration of valsartan alone, peak plasma concentrations of valsartan are reached 
in 2–4 hours. Mean absolute bioavailability is 23 %. Food decreases exposure (as measured by AUC) 
to valsartan by about 40 % and peak plasma concentration (Cmax) by about 50 %, although from about 
8 h post dosing plasma valsartan concentrations are similar for the fed and fasted groups. This 
reduction in AUC is not, however, accompanied by a clinically significant reduction in the therapeutic 
effect, and valsartan can therefore be given either with or without food.  
Distribution 
The steady-state volume of distribution of valsartan after intravenous administration is about 17 litres, 
indicating that valsartan does not distribute into tissues extensively. Valsartan is highly bound to 
serum proteins (94–97 %), mainly serum albumin. 
Biotransformation 
Valsartan is not transformed to a high extent as only about 20 % of dose is recovered as metabolites. A 
hydroxy metabolite has been identified in plasma at low concentrations (less than 10 % of the 
valsartan AUC). This metabolite is pharmacologically inactive.  
Elimination 
Valsartan shows multiexponential decay kinetics (t½α <1 h and t½ß about 9 h). Valsartan is primarily 
eliminated in faeces (about 83 % of dose) and urine (about 13 % of dose), mainly as unchanged drug. 
Following intravenous administration, plasma clearance of valsartan is about 2 L/h and its renal 
clearance is 0.62 L/h (about 30 % of total clearance). The half-life of valsartan is 6 hours.  
Special populations  
Paediatric population (age below 18 years)  
No pharmacokinetic data are available in the paediatric population.  
Elderly (age 65 years or over)  
Time to peak plasma amlodipine concentrations is similar in young and elderly patients. In elderly 
patients, amlodipine clearance tends to decline, causing increases in the area under the curve (AUC) 
and elimination half-life. Mean systemic AUC of valsartan is higher by 70 % in the elderly than in the 
young, therefore caution is required when increasing the dosage.  
Renal impairment  
The pharmacokinetics of amlodipine are not significantly influenced by renal impairment. As expected 
for a compound where renal clearance accounts for only 30 % of total plasma clearance, no correlation 
was seen between renal function and systemic exposure to valsartan.  
Hepatic impairment  
Very limited clinical data are available regarding amlodipine administration in patients with hepatic 
impairment. Patients with hepatic impairment have decreased clearance of amlodipine with resulting 
increase of approximately 40–60 % in AUC. On average, in patients with mild to moderate chronic 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
liver disease exposure (measured by AUC values) to valsartan is twice that found in healthy volunteers 
(matched by age, sex and weight). Caution should be exercised in patients with liver disease (see 
section 4.2). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Amlodipine/Valsartan  
Adverse reactions observed in animal studies with possible clinical relevance were as follows:  
Histopathological signs of inflammation of the glandular stomach was seen in male rats at an exposure 
of about 1.9 (valsartan) and 2.6 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 
10 mg amlodipine. At higher exposures, there were ulceration and erosion of the stomach mucosa in 
both females and males. Similar changes were also seen in the valsartan alone group (exposure 
8.5-11.0 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).  
An increased incidence and severity of renal tubular basophilia/hyalinisation, dilation and casts, as 
well as interstitial lymphocyte inflammation and arteriolar medial hypertrophy were found at an 
exposure of 8–13 (valsartan) and 7–8 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 
10 mg amlodipine. Similar changes were found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 8.5–11.0 times 
the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan).  
In an embryo-foetal development study in the rat, increased incidences of dilated ureters, malformed 
sternebrae, and unossified forepaw phalanges were noticed at exposures of about 12 (valsartan) and 
10 (amlodipine) times the clinical doses of 160 mg valsartan and 10 mg amlodipine. Dilated ureters 
were also found in the valsartan alone group (exposure 12 times the clinical dose of 160 mg valsartan). 
There were only modest signs of maternal toxicity (moderate reduction of body weight) in this study. 
The no-observed-effect-level for developmental effects was observed at 3- (valsartan) and 4- 
(amlodipine) fold the clinical exposure (based on AUC).  
For the single compounds there was no evidence of mutagenicity, clastogenicity or carcinogenicity.  
Amlodipine  
Reproductive toxicology  
Reproductive studies in rats and mice have shown delayed date of delivery, prolonged duration of 
labour and decreased pup survival at dosages approximately 50 times greater than the maximum 
recommended dosage for humans based on mg/kg.  
Impairment of fertility  
There was no effect on the fertility of rats treated with amlodipine (males for 64 days and females 14 
days prior to mating) at doses up to 10 mg/kg/day (8 times* the maximum recommended human dose 
of 10 mg on a mg/m2 basis). In another rat study in which male rats were treated with amlodipine 
besilate for 30 days at a dose comparable with the human dose based on mg/kg, decreased plasma 
follicle-stimulating hormone and testosterone were found as well as decreases in sperm density and in 
the number of mature spermatids and Sertoli cells. 
Carcinogenesis, mutagenesis  
Rats and mice treated with amlodipine in the diet for two years, at concentrations calculated to provide 
daily dosage levels of 0.5, 1.25, and 2.5 mg/kg/day showed no evidence of carcinogenicity. The 
highest dose (for mice, similar to, and for rats twice* the maximum recommended clinical dose of 
10 mg on a mg/m2 basis) was close to the maximum tolerated dose for mice but not for rats.  
Mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at either the gene or chromosome levels.  
* Based on patient weight of 50 kg  
Valsartan  
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction 
and development.  
In rats, maternally toxic doses (600 mg/kg/day) during the last days of gestation and lactation led to 
lower survival, lower weight gain and delayed development (pinna detachment and ear-canal opening) 
in the offspring (see section 4.6). These doses in rats (600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 18 times the 
maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 
320 mg/day and a 60 kg patient).  
In non-clinical safety studies, high doses of valsartan (200 to 600 mg/kg body weight) caused in rats a 
reduction of red blood cell parameters (erythrocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit) and evidence of 
changes in renal haemodynamics (slightly raised blood urea nitrogen, and renal tubular hyperplasia 
and basophilia in males). These doses in rats (200 and 600 mg/kg/day) are approximately 6 and 18 
times the maximum recommended human dose on a mg/m2 basis (calculations assume an oral dose of 
320 mg/day and a 60 kg patient).  
In marmosets at comparable doses, the changes were similar though more severe, particularly in the 
kidney where the changes developed to a nephropathy including raised blood urea nitrogen and 
creatinine.  
Hypertrophy of the renal juxtaglomerular cells was also seen in both species. All changes were 
considered to be caused by the pharmacological action of valsartan which produces prolonged 
hypotension, particularly in marmosets. For therapeutic doses of valsartan in humans, the hypertrophy 
of the renal juxtaglomerular cells does not seem to have any relevance.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan is and what it is used for 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan tablets contain two active substances called amlodipine and valsartan. 
Both of these substances help to control high blood pressure.  
− 
Amlodipine belongs to a group of substances called “calcium channel blockers”. Amlodipine 
stops calcium from moving into the blood vessel wall which stops the blood vessels from 
tightening.  
Valsartan belongs to a group of substances called “angiotensin-II receptor antagonists”. 
Angiotensin II is produced by the body and makes the blood vessels tighten, thus increasing the 
blood pressure. Valsartan works by blocking the effect of angiotensin II.  
− 
This means that both of these substances help to stop the blood vessels tightening. As a result, the 
blood vessels relax and blood pressure is lowered.  
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan is used to treat high blood pressure in adults whose blood pressure is not 
controlled enough with either amlodipine or valsartan on its own. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan  
Do not take Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan: 
− 
if you are allergic to amlodipine or to any other calcium channel blockers. This may involve 
itching, reddening of the skin or difficulty in breathing.  
if you are allergic to valsartan or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section  
6). If you think you may be allergic, talk to your doctor before taking Amlodipine/Valsartan 
Mylan.  
if you have severe liver problems or bile problems such as biliary cirrhosis or cholestasis.  
if you are more than 3 months pregnant (It is also better to avoid Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 
in early pregnancy, see Pregnancy section).  
if you have severe low blood pressure (hypotension).  
if you have narrowing of the aortic valve (aortic stenosis) or cardiogenic shock (a condition 
where your heart is unable to supply enough blood to the body). 
if you suffer from heart failure after a heart attack.  
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
− 
if you have diabetes or impaired kidney function and you are treated with a blood pressure 
lowering medicine containing aliskiren.  
If any of the above applies to you, do not take Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan and talk to your 
doctor. 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor before taking Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan:

if you have had heart failure or have experienced a heart attack. Follow your doctor’s 
instructions for the starting dose carefully. Your doctor may also check your kidney function.  
if your doctor has told you that you have a narrowing of the valves in your heart (called “aortic 
or mitral stenosis”) or that the thickness of your heart muscle is abnormally increased (called 
“obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy”).  
if you have experienced swelling, particularly of the face and throat, while taking other 
medicines (including angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors). If you get these symptoms, 
stop taking Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan and contact your doctor straight away. You should 
never take Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan again.  
if you have kidney problems where the blood supply to your kidneys is reduced (renal artery 
stenosis) 
if you are taking any of the following medicines used to treat high blood pressure:  
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
− 
an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (for example enalapril, lisinopril, 
ramipril), in particular if you have diabetes-related kidney problems.  
aliskiren.  
Your doctor may check your kidney function, blood pressure, and the amount of electrolytes (e.g. 
potassium) in your blood at regular intervals.  
If any of these apply to you, tell your doctor before taking Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan. 
Children and adolescents 
Do not give this medicine to children and adolescents below 18 years old. 
Other medicines and Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Your doctor may need to change your dose and/or to take other precautions. In some cases 
you may have to stop taking one of the medicines. This applies especially to the medicines listed 
below:  
− 
ACE inhibitors or aliskiren (see also information under the headings “Do not take 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan” and “Warnings and precautions”);  
diuretics (a type of medicine also called “water tablets” which increases the amount of urine you 
produce);  
lithium (a medicine used to treat some types of depression);  
potassium-sparing diuretics, potassium supplements, salt substitutes containing potassium and 
other substances that may increase potassium levels;  
certain types of painkillers called non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (NSAIDs) or 
selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors (COX-2 inhibitors). Your doctor may also check your 
kidney function;  
anticonvulsant agents (e.g. carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, fosphenytoin, primidone);  
St. John’s wort;  
nitroglycerin and other nitrates, or other substances called “vasodilators”;  
medicines used for HIV/AIDS (e.g. ritonavir, indinavir, nelfinavir);

Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan with food and drink 
Grapefruit and grapefruit juice should not be consumed by people who are taking 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan. This is because grapefruit and grapefruit juice can lead to an increase in 
the blood levels of the active substance amlodipine, which can cause an unpredictable increase in the 
blood pressure lowering effect of Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
Pregnancy  
You must tell your doctor if you think you are (or might become) pregnant. Your doctor will normally 
advise you to stop taking Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan before you become pregnant or as soon as you 
know you are pregnant and will advise you to take another medicine instead of Amlodipine/Valsartan 
Mylan. Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan is not recommended in early pregnancy (first 3 months), and 
must not be taken when more than 3 months pregnant, as it may cause serious harm to your baby if 
used after the third month of pregnancy.  
Breast-feeding  
Tell your doctor if you are breast-feeding or about to start breast-feeding.  
Amlodipine has been shown to pass into breast milk in small amounts. 
Amlodipine/Valsartan Mylan is not recommended for mothers who are breast-feeding, and your 
doctor may choose another treatment for you if you wish to breast-feed, especially if your baby is 
newborn, or was born prematurely.  
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Driving and using machines 
This medicine may make you feel dizzy. This can affect how well you can concentrate. So, if you are 
not sure how this medicine will affect you, do not drive, use machinery, or do other activities that you 
need to concentrate on.

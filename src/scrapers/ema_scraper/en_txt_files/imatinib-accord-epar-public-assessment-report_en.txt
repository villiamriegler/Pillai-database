1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Accord Healthcare Ltd. submitted on 3 May 2012 an application for Marketing 
Authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for imatinib Accord, through the centralised 
procedure under Article 3 (3) of Regulation (EC) No. 726/2004– ‘Generic of a centrally authorised 
product’. The eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on  
27 January 2012. 
The application concerns a generic medicinal product as defined in Article 10(2)(b) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and refers to a reference product for which a Marketing Authorisation is or has been 
granted in the Union on the basis of a complete dossier in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 
2001/83/EC. 
The applicant applied for the following for the treatment of:  
- paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) chronic 
myeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as the first line of 
treatment. 
- paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or in 
accelerated phase or blast crisis. 
- adult patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis. 
- adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
(Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy. 
- adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy. 
- adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated with platelet-
derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements. 
- adult patients with advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic 
leukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFRα rearrangement. 
- adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and adult patients with 
recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery. 
The effect of imatinib on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined. 
In adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and 
cytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogenetic 
response rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and on objective 
response rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic DFSP. The experience with 
imatinib in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements is very limited. There 
are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased survival for these diseases. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Generic application (Article 10(1) of Directive No 2001/83/EC). 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data and a 
bioequivalence study with the reference medicinal product Glivec instead of non-clinical and clinical 
data unless justified otherwise.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Imatinib Accord 100 mg and 400 mg film-coated tablets is a generic medicinal product of Glivec, which 
has been authorised in the EU since 7 November 2001. 
The active substance of Imatinib Accord is imatinib, a protein-tyrosine kinase inhibitor which potently 
inhibits the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase at the in vitro, cellular and in vivo levels. The compound selectively 
inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in Bcr-Abl positive cell lines as well as fresh leukaemic cells 
from Philadelphia chromosome positive CML and acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL) patients. 
The safety and efficacy profile of imatinib has been demonstrated in several clinical trials details of 
which can be found in the EPAR for Glivec. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience 
Imatinib Accord 
Assessment report

contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic 
application referring to the reference medicinal product Glivec, summary of the clinical data of imatinib 
is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and 
safety have been conducted. 
A comparative bioequivalence study was performed between the test product Imatinib Mesylate 
Tablets 400 mg and Glivec 400 mg Tablets. Imatinib Accord was found to be bioequivalent to the 
reference product Glivec.  
The approved indication is:  
Imatinib Accord is indicated for the treatment of : 
- paediatric patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome (bcr-abl) positive (Ph+) chronic 
myeloid leukaemia (CML) for whom bone marrow transplantation is not considered as the first line of 
treatment. 
- paediatric patients with Ph+ CML in chronic phase after failure of interferon-alpha therapy, or in 
accelerated phase or blast crisis. 
-  adults patients with Ph+ CML in blast crisis. 
- adult patients with newly diagnosed Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukaemia 
(Ph+ ALL) integrated with chemotherapy. 
- adult patients with relapsed or refractory Ph+ ALL as monotherapy. 
- adult patients with myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative diseases (MDS/MPD) associated with platelet-
derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR) gene re-arrangements. 
- adult patients with advanced hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic 
leukaemia (CEL) with FIP1L1-PDGFRα rearrangement. 
- adult patients with unresectable dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) and adult patients with 
recurrent and/or metastatic DFSP who are not eligible for surgery. 
The effect of imatinib on the outcome of bone marrow transplantation has not been determined. 
In adult and paediatric patients, the effectiveness of imatinib is based on overall haematological and 
cytogenetic response rates and progression-free survival in CML, on haematological and cytogenetic 
response rates in Ph+ ALL, MDS/MPD, on haematological response rates in HES/CEL and on objective 
response rates in adult patients with unresectable and/or metastatic DFSP. The experience with 
imatinib in patients with MDS/MPD associated with PDGFR gene re-arrangements is very limited. There 
are no controlled trials demonstrating a clinical benefit or increased survival for these diseases.

2.2.2.  Active  substance 
The active substance imatinib (INN) presented as the mesilate or 4-[(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl) methyl]–
N–[4-methyl-3-[[4-(3-pyridinyl)-2-pyrimidinyl]amino]-phenyl]-benzamide methanesulfonic acid is a 
white to slightly yellow powder. The main physico-chemical properties have been well described. It is 
freely soluble in water and sparingly soluble in methanol and practically insoluble in n-hexane.  
Imatinib is non-hygroscopic. Based on the literature survey imatinib exhibits polymorphism but the 
proposed manufacturer produces consistently a single crystalline form. 
Manufacture 
The active substance imatinib (as mesilate) is manufactured in 4 synthetic steps including using well-
defined starting materials.  
The structure elucidation of imatinib as mesilate was confirmed by Infrared, Ultra Violet, 1H NMR, 13C 
NMR and Mass spectroscopy. Experimental results of elemental analysis were comparable to theoretical 
values. XRD and DSC data showed that imatinib was consistently produced as a single polymorphic 
form.  
The manufacturing process was critically evaluated as well as the carry-over of impurities, reagents, 
solvents and catalysts from the starting material into the final active substance. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specification and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and were based on the 
appropriate studies 
Specification 
The specification of the active substance included tests for: description, solubility (Ph.Eur.), 
identification (IR, HPLC, XRD- Ph.Eur 2.2.24 and 2.2.37 and in-house methods) loss on drying (Ph.Eur 
2.2.32), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur. 2.4.14), methanesulfonic acid content (potentiometric titration), 
heavy metals (Ph.Eur. 2.4.8), related substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), limits 
of sulphonate esters (GC), microbial limits (Ph.Eur. 2.6.12 and 2.6.13), particle size (laser diffraction).  
The specification has been correctly discussed and the limits proposed for each test have been 
established taking into account the relevant ICH Guidelines (Q6A, Q3C (R3) and Q3A(R2)) and based 
on analytical data generated for imatinib mesilate batches. The limits were found to be acceptable from 
a safety point of view. The proposed specification is suitable to control the quality of the drug 
substance manufactured using the current process.  
The analytical methods were described and the non-compendial methods validated in accordance with 
ICH guideline Q2 (R1). All parameters were correctly determined and comply with their acceptance 
criteria 
Batch analysis data on three commercial- scale batches of imatinib mesilate are provided. The results 
are within specification and consistent from batch to batch. 
For the primary packaging in contact with the active substance (polyethylene bags) IR spectrum and 
certificate of compliance have been provided as well as a description of the analytical methods. 
Stability 
Three commercial-scale batches kept in simulated commercial packaging (transparent PE bag in a 
polyethylene bag, further placed in a black polyethylene bag put into HDPE drum) were put under long 
Imatinib Accord

term (18 months at 25ºC/60%RH), intermediate (12 months at 30ºC/65%RH), and accelerated (3 
months at 40ºC/75%RH) ICH conditions.  
The parameters studied were: description, identification, loss on drying, related substances, Assay, 
Sulphonate esters and Microbial contamination. The parameters tested were considered stability 
indicating. 
Stability results under long-term and intermediate conditions showed no significant degradation and 
confirmed the suitability of the analytical methods. Under accelerated conditions, some changes were 
observed with regard to polymorphism. 
Stability  studies  were  performed  under  forced  conditions  and  degradation  was  observed  under  Acid, 
basic and Oxidation conditions.  
The  stability  results  support  the  proposed  re-test  period  for  the  active  substance  stored  in  the 
proposed packaging materials.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The aim of this product development was to formulate Imatinib 100 mg and 400 mg Film-coated 
Tablets which are robust, stable and bioequivalent to the reference product i.e. Glivec Tablets 
manufactured by Novartis Pharma GmbH.  
Relevant physico-chemical characteristics such as solubility at different pH, density (impact on flow 
properties), particle size (affecting solubility and bioavailability), polymorphism (only one single 
crystalline form is produced), of the active substance were identified to optimise the product 
performance. 
The excipients namely cellulose microcrystalline (diluent), crospovidone (disintegrant), hypromellose 
(binder), colloidal anhydrous silica (glidant), magnesium stearate (lubricant) used in this formulation 
are commonly used for solid oral dosage forms. All the excipients used are complying with the current 
version of Ph. Eur. except Opadry yellow (but each ingredient- hypromellose, talc, polyethylene glycol 
8000, iron oxide red, iron oxide yellow complies with the Ph.Eur. or European directives). 
A compatibility study between imatinib mesylate with different excipients was carried out and results 
indicate that the selected excipients were compatible with the active substance. 
The primary aim of this development was to develop a stable formulation and to carry out the 
dissolution profile matching with the reference product. 
The product development work was initiated with a composition similar to the qualitative composition 
of the reference product and the formulation was further improved to obtain a formulation with a 
similar dissolution profile. The pH solubility profile indicates that imatinib has sufficient solubility in pH 
range of 1.2 – 7.4 to achieve sink condition. The dissolution studies were carried out in in 0.01N HCl, 
pH 4.5 Acetate buffer and pH 6.8 Phosphate buffer. The discriminatory power of the dissolution 
method was confirmed. The dissolution profiles were found similar in the three media used. 
A comparative bioequivalence study was performed between the test product Imatinib Mesylate 
Tablets 400 mg (Batch No.:PM0189) and Glivec 400 mg Tablets (Batch No. S0185).  Imatinib Accord 
was found to be bioequivalent to the reference product Glivec. For further information please see the 
Clinical section of this report.  
Imatinib Accord 
Assessment report  
Page 9/19 
 
 
 
Comparative studies on impurities profiles showed that the impurity profile of Imatinib 100 mg & 400 
mg Film-coated Tablets was found to be similar with the one from the reference product Glivec Tablets. 
No additional impurities could be observed in the test product. 
The manufacturing process has been optimised by modifying the blending time, the lubrication time, 
the concentration of binder, lubricant and disintegrant. Studies were conducted on the common blend, 
the uncoated tablets, the coated tablets and coating solution, and satisfactory holding times and 
conditions were calculated before further processing.  
The container closure system proposed is PVC/PVdC-Alu blisters, Alu- Alu blisters as described in the 
SmPC. There is also PPCP container intended to be used as a transportation pack. The packaging 
complies with the relevant EC directive 2002/72/EC and Ph. Eur. 3.1.11 and is adequate to support the 
stability and use of the Imatinib 100 mg and 400 mg film-coated tablets. 
Adventitious agents 
None of the ingredient used for Imatinib Accord was from animal or human origin and therefore no TSE 
risk could be foreseen. This is in line with the TSE CHMP guideline revision 3. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process is well detailed and comprises of the main steps as follow: co-sifting of the 
ingredients, granulation, dry mixing and binding, drying, sizing (milling), blending, compression, film-
coating and packaging.  
The process is considered as a standard process and the formulation of Imatinib Film-coated Tablets 
100 mg & 400 mg is quantitatively proportional. Both strengths are prepared from the same common 
granule. 
Appropriate in-process controls of critical steps and intermediates (granules) have been conducted and 
include tests such as loss on drying and assay. In-process controls on tablets and during the packaging 
comprise tests such as appearance, average weight of tablets, hardness, and disintegration time, 
blister seal. The in-process controls were found adequate for this pharmaceutical form. 
The process validation has been carried out on three consecutive batches of each strength of Imatinib 
Film coated Tablets 100 mg & 400 mg. The manufacturing process was found to be able to produce 
reproducibly a finished product of the intended quality.  
Product specification 
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include the following tests: appearance (in-
house), average weight (in-house), identification (in-house HPLC, TLC Ph.Eur 2.2.27 and colour 
identification of iron oxide), loss on drying (halogen moisture method), hardness (Ph.Eur. 2.9.8), 
dissolution (in-house), related substances (HPLC), uniformity of dosage unit (Ph.Eur. 2.9.40), assay 
(in-house HPLC), residual solvents (in-house GC), microbial quality (Ph.Eur. 2.6.12 and 2.6.13).  
The specifications were adequately justified and considered suitable to control this type of oral solid 
dosage form. No safety concern could be foreseen with the related substances and residual solvents, 
the limits were in line with ICH guidelines. 
All the analytical methods were described satisfactorily and non-compendial analytical methods were 
validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.   
Three validation commercial–scale batches of Imatinib 100 mg & 400 mg Film-coated Tablets were 
manufactured at the proposed manufacturing site using imatinib active substance sourced from the 
Imatinib Accord 
Assessment report  
Page 10/19 
 
 
 
proposed active substance manufacturer. The results confirmed that the tablets can be manufactured 
consistently according to the finished product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability of three commercial-scale batches for each strength of Imatinib Accord 100 mg and 400 mg 
stored under ICH long term (up to 17 months at 25°C / 60% RH), intermediate (12 months at 30°C / 
65% RH) and accelerated conditions (3 months at 40°C / 75% RH) were presented.  
The batches were identical to those proposed for marketing and kept in the commercial packaging 
PVC/PVdC-Alu blisters, Alu-Alu blister (used for long term and accelerated conditions only) and/or PPCP 
(polypropylene co-polymer) container to be used as transportation pack. 
Samples were tested for appearance, dissolution, loss on drying, assay, related substances and 
microbial contamination. The shelf life specification and test methods used were identical to those 
described in the control of the finished product. The tests methods were stability indicating. 
During the accelerated studies, some results were found outside the specifications therefore 
intermediate studies were initiated. All results complied with the specifications and well within the 
acceptance criteria during the long-term and intermediate studies.  
Additionally stability study was also carried out on PPCP container (transportation pack) under long 
term conditions up to 6 months at 25°C / 60% RH). Results were in compliance with the specification 
therefore coated tablets are to be repackaged in to blisters within 6 months from the date of bulk 
packing in to PPCP containers. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
can be accepted.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of imatinib and Imatinib Accord 100 mg and 
400 mg have been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the 
clinic.   
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of Imatinib Accord 100 mg and 400 mg tablets is considered to be acceptable when used in 
accordance with the conditions defined in the SmPC. Physico-chemical and biological aspects relevant 
to the uniform clinical performance of the product have been investigated and controlled in a 
satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation for future quality development

2.3.  Non- clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, 
which is based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no 
need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The 
non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity 
profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/Environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Imatinib Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare Ltd. is considered unlikely to result 
in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all imatinib containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not 
increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of imatinib are well known.  No non-
clinical data are submitted with this application. Published literature has been reviewed and is 
considered of suitable quality. 
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), justification for not providing ERA is acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing imatinib. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted one bioequivalence study with cross-over design 
under fed conditions. This study was the pivotal study for the assessment. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as efficacy and safety of imatinib based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC 
of the reference product with the exception of the information related to the indications protected by 
market exclusivity at the time of the Marketing authorisation application. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical 
assessment Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) in its 
current version is of particular relevance. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Exemption  
A  biowaiver  for  Imatinib  Accord  100  mg  was  requested  based  on  dissolution  profiles.  The  two  film-
coated  tablets  strengths  are  manufactured  with  the  same  process  and  manufacturer.  They  have  the 
same qualitative composition and proportional quantitative composition.  
Dissolution tests have been performed for Imatinib 400 mg strength (bio-batch) and for 100 mg 
strength (three batches) at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 in paddle apparatus, 50 rpm, in 1000 mL of dissolution 
media. The values at 15 minutes are higher than 85% with the exception of Imatinib 400 mg (batch 
No.PM0189) at pH 6.8, Imatinib 100 mg (batch No. Pm0196) at pH 6.8 and Imatinib 100 mg (batch 
PM0242) at pHs 4.5 and 6.8, therefore f2 similarity factor has been calculated. The f2 values were 
within the acceptance values of 50-100 with the exception of Imatinib 400 mg vs. Imatinib 100 mg 
(batch PM0188). The same applies with the reference product. Therefore it was considered that 
Imatinib 400 mg and 100 mg have the same dissolution profile.

Methods 
Study design  
The  study  was  an  open  label,  balanced,  randomised  two-treatment,  two-period,  two-sequence, 
crossover,  single  oral  dose,  bioequivalence  study  of  two  formulations  of  imatinib  tablets  400  mg  in 
healthy, adult male subjects under fed conditions. 
The treatment sequence is described in the table below.

The  subjects  were  administered  the  study  drug  in  each  period.  The  sequence  of  administration  was 
determined by the randomisation schedule. Randomisation was generated after the finalisation of the 
protocol using SAS (version 9.2). A washout period of 11 days was considered sufficient between the 
successive dosing days. 
Test and reference products  
Population(s) studied   
As per the protocol, 44 subjects were dosed in Period-I of the trial and all the dosed 44 subjects 
completed the clinical phase of the study successfully. Subjects were non-smoker, healthy, adult, male 
volunteers between 18 to 45 years of age (both inclusive), having a BMI between 18.5 to 30.0 kg/m2 
(both inclusive). 
Analytical methods   
The plasma samples of subjects were analysed using a validated LC-MS/MS method for imatinib at the 
bioanalytical facility of Lambda Therapeutic Research Ltd. The method validation report was provided

by the Applicant. Calibration curves using a 9-point calibration curve standards for imatinib, with 
concentrations ranging from 5.022 ng/mL to 3515.861 ng/mL, were used to determine the 
concentrations of imatinib in the samples of various subjects. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
Efficacy  of  the  formulations,  based  on  the  following  primary  and  secondary  pharmacokinetic 
parameters were assessed. 
Primary efficacy variables 
•  Maximum measured plasma concentration (Cmax) 
•  Area  under  the  plasma  concentration-time  curve  from  concentration  at  0h  to  the  time  of  last 
measurable concentration (AUC0-l) 
•  Area under the plasma concentration-time curve from concentration at 0h to infinity (AUC0-∞) 
Secondary efficacy variables 
• 
• 
Time-point of maximum measured plasma concentration (Tmax) 
Elimination rate constant (λz) 
•  Half-life of drug elimination during the terminal phase (t1/2) 
•  Residual Area (AUC_%Extrap_obs) 
These parameters were derived individually for each analysed subject from the concentration vs. time 
profiles of imatinib in plasma. Actual time-points were used for all the samples collected.  
The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  were  calculated  by  non-compartmental  model  using  WinNonlin 
Professional Software Version 5.3 (Pharsight Corporation, USA). 
Statistical methods   
Dataset for the estimation of pharmacokinetic parameters was prepared using WinNonlin Professional 
Software (Version 5.3) for imatinib. 
Descriptive statistics was computed and reported for all pharmacokinetic parameters of imatinib.  
The comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters was carried out using PROC GLM of SAS Version 
9.2 (SAS Institute Inc., USA). The same program was used to carry out the analysis of variance for un-
transformed and ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-l and AUC0-∞ for imatinib. 
ANOVA model included Sequence, Formulation and Period as fixed effects. 
An F-test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the effects involved in the model at 
a significance level of 5% (alpha=0.05). 
Two one sided test for bioequivalence and 90 % confidence interval for both the un-transformed and 
In-transformed ratios of the least squares means between the formulations were calculated for 
imatinib.  
Criteria for conclusion of bioequivalence were as follows: 
Bioequivalence of Test Product-A vs. Reference Product-B was concluded if the 90 % confidence 
interval fell within the acceptance range as defined below for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic 
parameters Cmax, AUC0-l and AUC0-∞ for imatinib.

Table 3.  Geometric least squares mean, ratios and 90 % confidence interval for imatinib (n= 44) 
Based  on  the  submitted  bioequivalence  study,  the  test  product  is  equivalent  to  the  reference  with 
respect  to  the  extent  and  rate  of  absorption  /  exposure.  The  90%  confidence  intervals  calculated  for 
AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax of imatinib were inside the normal range of acceptability (0.80 – 1.25). 
Safety data 
Four adverse events (AEs) (1 case of upper respiratory tract infection, 1 case of urinary tract infection, 
1 case of diarrhoea and 1 case of increased total white blood cell) were reported by 4 subjects during 
the conduct of the study. Three AEs were reported in Period-I and one AE in the post-study. Three AEs 
were reported after the receipt of Reference Product-B and one adverse event was reported after the 
receipt of Test Product-A. All the 4 AEs were mild in nature and were followed-up until resolution.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of Imatinib film-coated tablets. The reference product is 
Glivec  
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. 
From a clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects based on information from published literature was considered 
sufficient. 
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open label, balanced, randomised, two-
treatment, two-period, two-sequence, crossover, single oral dose, bioequivalence study of two 
formulations of imatinib tablets 400 mg  in healthy, adult male subjects under fed conditions. The 
study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in 
line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time 
as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and 
statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Imatinib Accord 400 mg film-coated tablets met the protocol-defined criteria for 
bioequivalence when compared with Glivec 400 mg film-coated tablets. The point estimates and their 
90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t,, AUC0-,  a n d   Cm a x  w e r e  a ll c o n t a in e d  w it h in  
the protocol-defined acceptance range of 80.00 to 125.00%. Bioequivalence of the two formulations 
was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation

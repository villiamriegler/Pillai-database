2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
The application for marketing authorisation of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN 850 mg/50 mg film-
coated tablets and Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN 1000 mg/50 mg film-coated tablets is submitted 
under Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended (i.e. a generic MA application). The reference 
product is Janumet, film-coated tablet, 50 mg/850 mg and 50 mg/1000 mg marketed by Merck Sharp and 
Dohme B.V., that was first approved in the European Union on 16 July 2008 via the centralised procedure 
(EMEA/H/C/000861).  
The product Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN 850 mg/50 mg and 1000 mg/50 mg film-coated tablets 
film-coated tablets contain Metformin and Sitagliptin as active substances. Sitagliptin/Metformin 
hydrochloride SUN contains the same active substances in the same pharmaceutical form as the reference 
product, except for sitagliptin which is conjugated to a different salt (fumarate) compared to the reference 
product (phosphate monohydrate). According to Article 10(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended), “The 
different salts, esters, isomers, mixtures of isomers, complexes or derivatives of an active substance shall be 
considered to be the same active substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to safety 
and /or efficacy.” The rationale provided by the applicant for the alternate salt formulation of Sitagliptin is 
accepted. In conclusion, sitagliptin fumarate and sitagliptin phosphate monohydrate do not significantly differ 
with regard to safety and efficacy and as such, can be considered to be the same active substance. 
Sitagliptin belongs to a class of oral anti-diabetic agents known as inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-
4), which improve glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus by increasing incretin levels of 
active hormones. Incretin hormones, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent 
insulinotropic peptide (GIP), are released by the gut throughout the day and their levels increase in response 
to a meal. The incretins are part of an endogenous system involved in the physiological regulation of glucose 
homeostasis. When blood glucose concentrations are normal or elevated, GLP-1 and GIP increase the 
synthesis and release of insulin by pancreatic β-cells by intracellular signalling pathways involving cyclic AMP. 
As sitagliptin is the first of the DPP-4 inhibitors, it has been extensively evaluated in clinical trials in patients 
with type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin has efficacy in decreasing glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasma 
glucose (FPG), and 2-h post-prandial glucose (PPG) levels when used as monotherapy, and in combination 
with other drugs in type 2 diabetes. Sitagliptin generally has a low risk of hypoglycaemia and has a neutral 
effect on body weight. 
Sitagliptin improves glycaemic control when used as monotherapy or in combination treatment (with 
metformin, with both metformin and a sulphonylurea, with both metformin and a PPARγ agonist, with both 
metformin and insulin) in adult patients with type 2 diabetes.  
Metformin is an antidiabetic drug in the biguanide class. It is an antidiabetic agent used in type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. Metformin is the preferred first-line agent in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus. Metformin 
reduces blood glucose levels by decreasing the production of glucose in the liver, decreasing intestinal 
absorption, and increasing insulin sensitivity. Metformin decreases both the basal and postprandial blood 
glucose. Efficacy of metformin as an anti-hyperglycaemic agent has been well established in published clinical 
studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/290005/2023 
Page 8/41 
 
 
 
Safety and efficacy of combination of metformin and sitagliptin in type 2 diabetes mellitus has been 
demonstrated in various clinical trials. Metformin and sitagliptin combination therapy has an acceptable 
safety profile as is evident from published clinical literature. 
The pharmacotherapeutic group of the sitagliptin/metformin combination is “Drugs used in diabetes, 
Combinations of oral blood glucose lowering drugs” and the ATC code is A10BD07. 
The indications applied for Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN are the same as those of the reference 
product Janumet: 
For adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycaemic control in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin 
alone or those already being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin. 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN is indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple 
combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their 
maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN is indicated as triple combination therapy with a peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an adjunct to diet 
and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a 
PPARγ agonist. 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN is also indicated as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple combination 
therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients when stable dose 
of insulin and metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General Information 
Sitagliptin fumarate 
The quality information for the active substance sitagliptin fumarate is mainly the same as the information 
provided in the previously approved monocomponent manufacturing authorisation (MA). Therefore, the active 
substance information includes resubmission of data from the sitagliptin fumarate (Sitagliptin SUN 
(EU/1/21/1598)) marketing authorisation. 
General information 
The chemical name of sitagliptin fumarate is 7-[(3R)-3-Amino-1-oxo-4-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butyl]-5,6,7,8-
tetrahydro-3-(trifluoromethyl)-1,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazine fumarate corresponding to the molecular formula 
C20H19F6N5O5. It has a relative molecular weight of 523.38 and the following structure: 
Figure 1: sitagliptin fumarate structure 
The chemical structure of sitagliptin fumarate was elucidated by a combination of IR, UV, 1H-NMR, 13CNMR 
spectrum and MS. The solid state properties of the active substance were measured by XRD. 
sitagliptin fumarate is a non-hygroscopic, white to off white powder, soluble in water and dimethylformamide 
(DMF), and practically insoluble in isopropanol and isopropyl acetate. 
sitagliptin fumarate exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of one chiral centre. The manufactured 
active substance is R-isomer and its S-isomer (enantiomer) is already controlled routinely in the 
specifications. 
The sitagliptin fumarate commercially manufactured is in crystalline form. X-Ray diffraction pattern of 
sitagliptin fumarate batches and that of its working standard are comparable. Hence, it is confirmed that the 
manufacturing process of sitagliptin fumarate produces a consistent polymorphic form.

Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory 
Sitagliptin fumarate is synthesised in 7 main steps using commercially available well defined starting 
materials with acceptable specifications.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
The  active  substance  is  packaged  in  a  triple  polybag  bags  which  is  placed  in  a  HDPE  drum/container  which 
complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
Sitagliptin fumarate specification includes tests for: description (visual), solubility (Ph. Eur.), identification 
(HPLC, IR), water content (Ph. Eur.), residue on ignition (weight), related substances (HPLC), chiral purity 
(HPLC), assay (HPLC), content of fumaric acid (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), tapped density (Ph. Eur.), and 
particle size (Malvern). 
The finished product manufacturer applies specifications which are in line with the active substance supplier’s 
specifications, ICH Q6A guideline, ICH Q3A guideline, ICH Q3C guideline, ICH Q3D guideline and available 
batch data. The limits for particle size in the final AS specification have been established by the FP 
manufacturer. The proposed specification is acceptable. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (4 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from 5 commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 18 months under long term conditions (5 ± 3°C) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (25 ± 2°C/60 ± 5% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided.  
The following parameters were tested: description, identification, water content, related substances, chiral 
purity and assay. All tested parameters were within the specifications. All the results meet in-house 
requirements for sitagliptin fumarate indicating that it is a stable product. 
Photostability  was  investigated  in  line  with  ICH  Q1B.  All  the  photostability  study  results  remain  within  the 
acceptance limits at all conditions tested.  The active substance is not sensitive to light.

EMA/290005/2023 
Page 11/41 
 
 
 
 
 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months stored in well closed containers 
between 2°C to 8°C in the proposed container. 
Metformin hydrochloride 
General information 
The chemical name of metformin hydrochloride  is N, N-Dimethylimidodicarbonimidic corresponding to the 
molecular formula C4H11 N5.HCl. It has a relative molecular mass of 165.62 and the following structure: 
Figure 2: Metformin hydrochloride structure 
The chemical structure of metformin hydrochloride was elucidated by a combination of UV, IR, 1H NMR, 13C 
NMR absorption spectrum, MS and elemental analysis 
Metformin hydrochloride is a hygroscopic white or almost white crystals freely soluble in water, slightly 
soluble in ethanol (96%), practically insoluble in acetone and in methylene chloride  
Based on the structure of the metformin hydrochloride and current knowledge of the synthetic route, there is 
no potential for the optical isomers being present, as there is no asymmetric carbon atom in the molecule of 
metformin hydrochloride.  
Metformin hydrochloride exists in two polymorphic form as reported in the literature. Form-1 exhibits a 
fibrous habit while Form-2 is a flaky aggregate. Inter-conversion from Form-1 to Form-2 occurs by heating 
the crystals. The polymorphic form of the commercial metformin hydrochloride matches with working 
standard metformin hydrochloride. This has been confirmed by the analytical evidence like FTIR, XRD and 
differential scanning calorimeter. 
As there is a monograph of metformin hydrochloride in the European Pharmacopoeia, the manufacturer of 
the active substance has been granted a Certificate of Suitability of the European Pharmacopoeia (CEP) for 
metformin hydrochloride (RO-CEP 2016-223-Rev 01) which has been provided within the current marketing 
authorisation application.

The relevant information has been assessed by the EDQM before issuing the Certificate of Suitability. 
The active substance is packaged in low density transparent polyethylene bag followed by outer black coloured 
low density polyethylene bag under nitrogen atmosphere. This is then finally placed in fibre board drum. Each 
bag is fastened separately with plastic fastener; bags comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 
as amended. 
Specification 
Metformin hydrochloride is fully tested for its conformance with current Ph.Eur. and in-house requirements. 
Metformin hydrochloride specification includes tests for appearance (Ph. Eur.), solubility (Ph. Eur.), 
identification (Ph. Eur.), appearance of solution (Ph. Eur), impurities (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), loss 
of drying (Ph. Eur.), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), and residual solvents (GC). 
The active substance is tested by both the active manufacturer and the finished manufacturer according to 
Ph. Eur. current monograph of metformin hydrochloride. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data (3 commercial scale batches) of the active substance are provided. The results are within 
the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
The Certificate of Suitability (R0-CEP 2016-223-Rev01) submitted includes a retest period of 5 years for the 
substance stored in double polyethylene bags (outer black), placed in a fibreboard drum sufficiently stable.  
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The 50 mg of sitagliptin and 850 mg of metformin is presented as pink, capsule-shaped film-coated tablets, 
dimensions approximately 20 mm x 10 mm x 6 mm, debossed with “SC1” on one side. 
The 50 mg of sitagliptin and 1000 mg of metformin is presented as brown to reddish brown, capsule-shaped 
film-coated tablets, dimensions approximately 22 mm x 11 mm x 7 mm, debossed with “SC7” on one side. 
The finished product is a generic version of the reference product, Janumet, indicated for adult patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus. The strategy was to develop a product essentially similar to the reference product 
and with similar in vivo performance to reference medicinal product. 
The finished product has been developed as oral tablet fixed dose combination (FDC) of sitagliptin and 
metformin. Sitagliptin in the FDC comprises a new alternative salt of sitagliptin, i.e. sitagliptin fumarate is 
used as active substance of the generic medicinal product instead of the approved sitagliptin phosphate salt 
used in the reference medicinal product. Fumaric acid is a weak organic acid with pKa value of 3.032; while 
Assessment report  
EMA/290005/2023

phosphoric acid is a strong inorganic acid with pKa value of 2.15. The active moiety of the new salt form 
(sitagliptin) is expected to have the same pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and toxicity characteristics 
as the original. Therefore, the proposed product is expected to have an efficacy and safety profile similar to 
that already established for the reference medicinal product.  
Taking into account the high solubility of both active substances in water, extensive discussion of 
functionality characteristics such as particle size and polymorphism of the active substances with reference to 
their effects on dissolution and bioavailability and the pH-solubility profile is not required. 
Compatibility of the two active substances and compatibility of the excipients with the two active substances 
was evaluated. The formation of sitagliptin fumarate adduct (process and degradation impurity) by the 
interaction of crospovidone and magnesium stearate with the active has been studied; the observed level is 
well within the qualified limit.  
A quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined based on the properties of the active substances, 
information of the reference medicinal product, consideration of the reference product’s label and intended 
patient population. The generic medicinal product was designed to achieve all of the attributes in the QTPP. 
The investigation during pharmaceutical development focused on those critical quality attributes (CQAs) that 
could be impacted by a realistic change to the finished product formulation or manufacturing process. Assay, 
water, uniformity of dosage units, residual solvents, dissolution and related substances were considered as 
CQAs of the finished product. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards (except for iron oxide red and iron oxide yellow which comply with in house standards). There are 
no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC. 
The tablets have been developed as solid dosage form for oral administration. The proposed formulation was 
developed using wet granulation technique comprising granulation of metformin HCl and blending of 
sitagliptin premix part followed by mixing with extragranular materials, compression and coating. 
During formulation development, a risk assessment was carried out to identify potentially high risk critical 
material attributes (CMAs) and critical process parameters (CPPs). For formulation optimisation, the impact of 
level of crospovidone, hydrogenated castor oil and glycerol dibehenate on finished product CQAs were studied 
by using design of experiments (DOE). The impact of the level of hydroxypropyl cellulose and magnesium 
stearate on the finished product CQAs was also studied by one-factor-at-a-time (OFAT) method. The 
formulation composition was finalised based on knowledge gained from these formulation optimisation 
studies. 
The proposed generic medicinal product is found to be bioequivalent to the reference medicinal product. The 
test product formula used in bioequivalence study is same as proposed for marketing. 
Dissolution profile results conclude that the drug release from the generic medicinal product is similar to the 
reference medicinal product.  
As mentioned earlier, a wet granulation of metformin HCl part followed by blending with sitagliptin fumarate 
and extragranular materials was chosen as an appropriate manufacturing process during the manufacturing 
development. The material attributes of the input materials and the process parameters used at the very first 
process step determine the CQAs of final product. Process parameters of the subsequent process step in the 
manufacturing process determine quality attributes of the next intermediate and, eventually, those of the 
finished product. This cycle repeats until the final process step where finished product is manufactured and

the product quality attributes are evaluated. This map was used to guide the risk assessments performed 
during process development. 
A process development design of experiments (DOE) was conducted to study the impact of granulation 
parameters on the finished product CQAs. Other granulation process parameters such as drying and milling of 
metformin HCl granules and blending process parameters such as blender speed, blending time and 
lubrication time were optimised during development. The impact of critical compression process parameters 
that are machine speed, feeder speed, pre-compression force and main compression force on the finished 
product CQAs were also studied. However, no design space was claimed. 
The primary packaging is HDPE bottle with silica gel/carbon desiccant. The material complies with Ph.Eur. and 
EC  requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of 8 main steps: manufacturing of the metformin blend, manufacturing of 
the sitagliptin blend, final blend, compression, coating, inspection of tablets, finished product analysis and 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has  been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality 
in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
The finished product release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage 
form, description (visual), identification for sitagliptin and metformin HCl (HPLC and IR), identification for 
colours (colorimetry), average weight, uniformity of dosage units (weight variation for metformin HCl and by 
content uniformity for sitagliptin, HPLC), water content (KF), dissolution (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), 
assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), microbial enumeration test & tests for specified micro-organisms (Ph. 
Eur.) and content of N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) (GC-MS/MS). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity 
controls.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has 
been performed (as requested as MO) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 
5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” 
(EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 
726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or 
the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary.  
Assessment report

The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for testing has been 
presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches per strength confirming the consistency of 
the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability  data from  9 commercial  scale batches per  strength  of  finished product  stored  for  up to 12  months 
under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% 
RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The stability batches of  are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for description, water, dissolution, assay, related substances, microbial enumeration test 
and  tests  for  specified  micro-organisms  and  content  of  N-nitrosodimethylamine  (NDMA).  The  analytical 
procedures used are stability indicating.  
No significant changes have been observed under long term and accelerated conditions. 
In addition, 3 batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. No change was observed in the fully exposed product, the finished product was 
considered  to  be  adequately  protected  from  exposure  to  light.  Thus,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  finished 
product is photo stable. 
In-use stability has been performed for 28, 56 and 200 film-coated tablets count bottle at initial station and at 
11th,  10th  month  and  initial  station  respectively  at  25±2°C/60±5%  RH  in  HDPE  bottle  pack.  In-use  stability 
results indicate that the product complies with the proposed shelf life specifications; it is thus acceptable that 
no in-use shelf life has been introduced in the SmPC. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years and storage conditions “do not store 
above 25 °C” as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 and 6.4) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
One MO has been raised during assessment concerning the risk assessment concerning the potential 
presence of nitrosamine. The applicant’s response was considered satisfactory.

The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its manufacturing 
process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process for the finished product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pharmacodynamic, pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of sitagliptin and metformin are well known. 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to 
generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN is a generic version of Janumet. The applicant has developed oral 
tablet formulations of sitagliptin and metformin comprising of a new alternative salt of sitagliptin fumarate 
against the approved sitagliptin phosphate salt in the reference product. In the non-clinical overview, it is 
justified that the different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards 
to safety and efficacy of the salt form contained in the reference product. This is considered acceptable by 
the CHMP.  
This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non clinical studies are not considered 
necessary.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic drug 
interactions of sitagliptin and metformin has been provided. As sitagliptin and metformin are widely used, 
well-known active substances, the applicant has not provided additional studies on pharmacology and further 
studies are not required. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacokinetics (Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism and Excretion) of 
sitagliptin and metformin has been provided. As sitagliptin and metformin are widely used, well-known active 
Assessment report  
EMA/290005/2023 
Page 17/41 
 
 
 
substances, the applicant has not provided additional studies on pharmacokinetics and further studies are not 
required. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
A non-clinical overview on the toxicology (Single dose toxicity, Repeat dose toxicity, Genotoxicity, 
Carcinogenicity, Reproductive and developmental toxicity, Local tolerance, Other toxicity studies) of 
sitagliptin and metformin has been provided. Qualification studies on one degradation impurity of sitagliptin 
has also been provided by the applicant. Since sitagliptin and metformin are widely used, well-known active 
substances, further studies are not required. 
All degradation impurities are monitored in the drug product specifications at release and shelf life. 
The applicant has conducted qualification studies (systemic toxicity study and in-vitro genotoxicity studies) to 
establish the biological safety of one degradation impurity of Sitagliptin viz. Sitagliptin fumarate adduct (EP 
impurity FP-A). The qualification studies provided by the applicant support that the impurity ‘Sitagliptin 
fumarate adduct’ is considered well qualified with adequate safety margin for use in patients. 
Limit for degradation or process/degradation impurities (EP impurity FP-E, FP-B, FP-C and FP-D) at release 
and shelf life are in line with the qualification threshold as per ICH Q3B guideline. 
The impurities discussed and present in the formulation of sitagliptin and metformin tablets are well 
characterised. The comparative impurity profile between the test product and reference product is provided. 
The applicant has not conducted any other toxicological or pharmacological studies on sitagliptin and 
metformin tablets. Instead, appropriate data from published literature on sitagliptin and metformin has been 
summarised in this report. 
The series of toxicology studies have demonstrated the toxicologic and safety profile of fumarate in a variety 
of animal species. Fumarate was found to be non-genotoxic, non-carcinogenic in animal and human, and did 
not cause reproductive toxicity. Available non-clinical data provides evidence to support the safety of 
fumarate in human. As maximum daily dose of sitagliptin in human is 100 mg, the maximum intake of 
fumarate through sitagliptin fumarate tablets would be only approximately 28.5 mg/day which is within the 
acceptable intake. In conclusion, fumarate is unlikely to raise any new safety concern. 
According to Article 10(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended), the different salts, esters, isomers, 
mixtures of isomers, complexes or derivatives of an active substance shall be considered to be the same 
active substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy. There are 
no specific concerns identified with regard to the new salt form used in the finished product.  
The excipients used in the formulation of sitagliptin and metformin tablets are well characterised and safe. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment (ERA) studies were submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN manufactured by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries 
Europe B.V. is considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all 
sitagliptin / metformin hydrochloride containing products and the exposure of the environment to the active 
substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar.

2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant presented a non-clinical discussion, including a non–clinical overview and a toxicological 
qualification of a degradation impurity (sitagliptin fumarate adduct) of sitagliptin, which is acceptable.  The 
non-clinical data is reflected in the appropriate sections of the SmPC (Sections 4.6 and 5.3). The relevant 
part of the SmPC of the proposed drug product is identical to the reference product. In line with the 
requirements for generic products, no new non–clinical data was provided by the applicant.  
In single dose toxicity studies conducted with sitagliptin, in rats the highest non-lethal dose was 271 and 182 
times the human exposure based on AUC respectively. The LD50 values for metformin in mice, rats, rabbits, 
and dogs are 2400, 1770, 552, and 375 mg/kg, respectively. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies with sitagliptin, the maximum non-lethal dose was 750 mg/kg/day for mice 
(approximately 80 times the human exposure based on AUC), 500 mg/kg/day for rats (48 times the human 
exposure based on AUC), and ≥ 50 mg/kg/day for dogs (≥ 22 times the human exposure based on AUC). 
Liver toxicity was seen in both mice and rats. Metformin administration to dogs at 50 mg/kg/day showed 
increased mortality, increased serum lactate levels and emesis. The toxicity and toxicokinetics of metformin 
was evaluated in a 13-week repeat dose oral gavage study in rats. Based on the mortality and body weight 
effects, the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 200 mg/kg/day. The mean day 89 AUC0–24 and 
Cmax (gender averaged) at this dose was 41.1 μg h/mL and 10.3 μg/mL, respectively, which corresponds to 
approximately 2-fold and 8-fold the human AUC and Cmax following a 2000-mg total daily dose. Three 
repeated-dose toxicity studies were conducted in dogs to rule out unexpected toxicologic effects of the 
combination; two studies with the combination sitagliptin + metformin, and one study with metformin alone 
to establish the effects of metformin alone in the dog strain used. The combination studies with sitagliptin 
and metformin in dogs indicated no evidence of toxicokinetic or toxicologic interactions. 
Sitagliptin showed no genotoxic effects in in vitro or in vivo assays on mutagenicity (Ames test), direct DNA 
damage, or clastogenicity. Metformin is not mutagenic or clastogenic in the Ames bacterial mutagenicity 
assay, chromosomal aberration assay, cytogenetic assay, or in vivo micronucleus assay. 
In the two-year mouse carcinogenicity study with sitagliptin, there were no treatment-related increases in 
tumour incidence in any organ at all tested doses (50, 125, 250, 500 mg/kg/day). In the two-year rat 
carcinogenicity study, there was a treatment-related increase in hepatic tumours at systemic exposure levels 
58-times the human exposure levels. Since hepatotoxicity has been shown to correlate with induction of 
hepatic neoplasia in rats, this increased incidence of hepatic tumours in rats was likely secondary to chronic 
hepatic toxicity at this high dose. Because of the high safety margin (19-fold at this no-effect level), these 
neoplastic changes are not considered relevant for the situation in humans. No increased tumour incidence is 
observed in a 2-year study in mice with metformin. No tumourigenic potential is observed in rats except for 
an increase in benign stromal uterine polyps in females. Extensive clinical experience does not indicate an 
increased tumourigenic potential. 
Sitagliptin did not affect male or female fertility in rats at the limit dose of 1000 mg/kg/day. In rabbits, 
maternal toxicity was seen at 500 mg/kg/day (decreased food consumption, no faeces). Sitagliptin was 
shown to cross the placental barrier with fetal exposure values 45 to 80% those in the dam and was also 
concentrated in milk about 4-fold compared to plasma in rats. Metformin did not affect fertility and is not 
teratogenic in rats and rabbits. Metformin is excreted in rat milk. 
The series of toxicology studies have demonstrated the toxicologic and safety profile of fumarate in a variety 
of animal species. Fumarate was found to be non-genotoxic, non-carcinogenic in animal and human, and did 
Assessment report  
EMA/290005/2023

not cause reproductive toxicity. Available non-clinical data provides evidence to support the safety of 
fumarate in human. As maximum daily dose of sitagliptin in human is 100 mg, the maximum intake of 
fumarate through sitagliptin fumarate tablets would be only approximately 28.5 mg/day, which is within the 
acceptable intake.  
According to Article 10(2) of Directive 2001/83/EC (as amended), The different salts, esters, isomers, 
mixtures of isomers, complexes or derivatives of an active substance shall be considered to be the same 
active substance, unless they differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy. There are 
no specific concerns identified with regard to the new salt form used in the finished product. A summary of 
the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Sitagliptin fumarate/Metformin hydrochloride SUN and 
justifications that the different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with 
regards to safety and efficacy of the salt form contained in the reference product is provided. 
The Qualification studies provided by the applicant support that the impurity ‘Sitagliptin fumarate adduct’ is 
considered well qualified with adequate safety margin for use in patients.  
In conclusion, the non-clinical overview and new non-clinical data provided by the applicant seem adequate. 
From a non-clinical point of view Sitagliptin fumarate /Metformin hydrochloride SUN tablets are expected to 
be safe and well tolerated. 
Experimental data for the derivation of the n-octanol/water partition coefficient (logKow) for Sitagliptin 
fumarate /Metformin hydrochloride below the trigger of 4.5 has been provided, indicating a low potential for 
bioaccumulation, comparable to the reference product Janumet.  
Prevalence data of the disease in EU countries during years 2020 and 2022 has been provided. Consumption 
data through IQVIA of the active substances as monotherapy or combination therapy has also been provided 
supporting a mild decreasing trend over the last 3 years. Therefore, in line with the current guideline 
EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 2 and Question 1 of the Questions and Answers on 'Guideline on the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use’ (EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev. 1, 
05.2016), introduction of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN Tablets 50/850 mg and 50/1000 mg is 
considered unlikely to result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all 
sitagliptin/metformin containing products.  
Based on the above, an adequate justification for the absence of a complete Environmental Risk Assessment 
has been provided and substantiated with the additional data. It is endorsed that with the introduction of the 
proposed generic product to the market, an increase in environmental exposure of the active substances is 
not expected. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to non-clinical data of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN was 
considered adequate. In addition, the presented non-clinical data and justifications that the different salt of 
the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the 
reference product were provided and accepted by the CHMP. 
An adequate justification for the absence of a complete ERA was provided and substantiated with the additional 
data. It is endorsed that an increase in environmental exposure of the active substances is not expected with 
the introduction of the proposed generic product to the market. 
This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional non-clinical studies were considered

necessary. 
From a non-clinical point of view, Sitagliptin fumarate/Metformin hydrochloride SUN tablets are expected to 
be safe and well tolerated and the product is considered approvable.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for film-coated tablets containing sitagliptin and metformin hydrochloride. To support 
the marketing authorisation application the applicant conducted two bioequivalence studies with cross-over

The 90% confidence interval for the ratio of test (T) and reference (R) product averages (least squares 
means) for pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and AUC0-t) were between 80% and 125% for the log-
transformed data for both sitagliptin and metformin. 
Therefore, this study has proven that the test product is bioequivalent to the reference product. 
No subject reached Cmax at the first sampling time point, indicating that sampling time schedule was 
adequate. The duration of sampling was sufficient for IR product reaching up to 72 hours. Nevertheless, the 
residual area was evaluated, and AUC0-t was found to cover more than 80% of AUC0-∞ for all subjects and 
treatments. 
•  Safety data 
Total of three (03) adverse events were reported in the study involving three (03) subjects. One (01) adverse 
event was experienced by one subject after dosing with the reference product (R). Two (02) adverse events 
were experienced by two subjects after dosing with the test product (T). 
The adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and non-serious in nature.  
There was no serious adverse event in the study.

analysis. 
Analytical methods 
Analytical Method and Data 
Sample preparation process was performed by Protein precipitation technique. 
The applicant has provided the pre-study validation report of the test method.  
Pharmacokinetic and Statistical evaluation were performed on datasets from 44 completed subjects. 
Study samples were analyzed for Sitagliptin & Metformin using validated bio-analytical method. The method 
was based on Protein Precipitation technique followed by UHPLC-MS/MS analysis.Minor protocol and SOP 
deviations were reported with no impact on the study results. 
•  The applicant also provided the bioanalytical method validation report of the test method. 
Pharmacokinetic variables 
The primary pharmacokinetic parameters for this study were AUC0-t, AUC0-∞ and Cmax, and the secondary 
pharmacokinetic parameters were AUC% Extrap, Tmax, Kel and T1/2 for both sitagliptin and metformin, 
respectively.  
Plasma samples were assayed for Sitagliptin and Metformin using a validated analytical method. The 
pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using standard methods and a non-compartmental approach. 
The PK analysis software used was Phoenix WinNonlin Software Version 8.1. 
•  Statistical methods 
Statistical analysis of the PK of the two formulations was performed using GLM SAS® procedure(s) Version 
9.4 to assess the bioequivalence between test and reference formulations.  
PK parameters for each individual were tabulated and graphically presented. Actual time-points of the sample 
collection are used for the calculation of PK parameters. All concentration values below the lower limit of 
quantification are set to zero for the pharmacokinetic and statistical calculations. Individual AUC parameters 
were calculated using the linear trapezoidal rule. 
ANOVA was performed on ln transformed pharmacokinetic parameters for Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞.  
Bioequivalence acceptance criteria: 
For Sitagliptin and Metformin: The 90% confidence interval for the ratio of test (T) and reference (R) product 
averages (least squares means) for pharmacokinetic parameters (Cmax and AUC0-t) should be between 80% 
and 125% for the log-transformed data.

Therefore, this study has proven that the test product is bioequivalent to the reference product (R1). 
No subject reached Cmax at the first sampling time point indicating that sampling time schedule was 
adequate. The duration of sampling was sufficient for IR product reaching up to 72 hours. However, still the 
residual area was evaluated, but AUC0-t was found to cover more than 80% of AUC0-∞ for all subjects and 
treatments. 
•  Safety data 
The test product (T) and the reference product (R1) were well tolerated by the study subjects. Total of three 
(03) adverse events were reported in the study involving three (03) subjects. Two (02) adverse events were 
experienced by two subjects after dosing with the Test product (T) and one (01) adverse event was 
experienced by one subject after dosing with the Reference product (R1). Out of three (03) adverse events, 
two (02) adverse events were associated with clinical laboratory tests at the end of study. 
The adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity and non-serious in nature. 
There was no serious adverse event reported in the study. 
2.4.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.3.  Additional data 
To demonstrate the essential similarity between Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN tablets and the 
reference product Janumet, the applicant also performed comparative dissolution testing between the test 
and reference product bio-batches.  
The dissolution profile results confirm that the drug release from the test product is similar to reference 
product. However, the justification of the applicant for selecting 75 rpm as speed for the dissolution tests was 
not considered adequate, thus, the applicant also provided the dissolution tests between test product and 
reference formulation in pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 buffers in agitation of 50 rpm.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
To support this application, the applicant submitted two single-dose bioequivalence (BE) studies under fed 
conditions, study SIM26 with Sitagliptin and Metformin HCl Tablets 50 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets and 
study SIM76 with Sitagliptin and Metformin HCl Tablets 50 mg/1000 mg film-coated tablets.  
The clinical facility where the two BE studies were conducted was inspected by two European competent 
authorities, the MHRA (before Brexit) and ANSM in 2013. No critical findings were identified during these 
inspections, and there was one major finding identified during this inspection relating to ethics committee 
approvals. However, the clinical facility was also inspected by FDA in 206-2017 and 2019 according to a list 
of inspections provided by the applicant. An FDA-483 form was not issued for either of the inspections, i.e. 
there were no objectionable conditions, and for the 2019 inspection only two items were observed for which 
corrections were promised by the management. The clinical facility has also been inspected in 2018 by WHO, 
the inspection of which didn’t reveal any critical findings.

The applicant confirmed that all clinical work was conducted in accordance with the ICG-GCP of both 
bioequivalence studies “Study SIM26” and “Study SIM76”. The applicant also stated for the two BE studies 
that, to the best of their knowledge and understanding, the clinical trials carried out outside the European 
Union meet the ethical requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC. Furthermore, the applicant confirmed for both 
BE studies that the research was carried out in accordance with the principles enunciated in the International 
conference on Harmonization good clinical practices (ICH GCP), Declaration of Helsinki (Ethical Principles for 
Medical Research Involving Human Subjects, revised by the WMA current version) and applicable rules and 
regulations of New Drugs and Clinical Trials Rules, 2019.    
The BE studies for the 50 mg/850 mg and 50 mg/1000 mg in fed state were performed following the EMA 
guidance “Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/ QWP/1401/98)”. According to this 
guideline, for drugs with a less than proportional increase in AUC with increasing dose over the therapeutic 
dose range (such as metformin), bioequivalence should in most cases be established both at the highest 
strength and at the lowest strength (or a strength in the linear range), and for products where the SmPC 
recommends intake of the reference medicinal product only in fed state, the bioequivalence study should 
generally be conducted under fed conditions. The fixed-dose combination of Sitagliptin/ Metformin HCl should 
be given twice daily with meals to reduce the gastrointestinal (GI) adverse reactions associated with 
metformin. Therefore, bioequivalence studies have been performed with both strengths and under fed 
conditions in accordance with guidelines. 
Study SIM26 with Sitagliptin and Metformin HCl Tablets 50 mg/850 mg film-coated tablets was conducted as 
an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two sequence, two-period, single dose crossover, 
bioequivalence study in healthy adult human subjects under fed condition. Forty-four (44) healthy, adult, 
human male subjects were enrolled in the study and thirty-eight (38) subjects completed the study. 
Overall study design is acceptable and in line with pharmacokinetic properties of sitagliptin and metformin. 
The bioequivalence study was conducted under standardised conditions. The sampling period was sufficient, 
the sampling time schedule and wash-out period were adequate taking into account the tmax and elimination 
half-life of sitagliptin and metformin. The sampling schedule reached up to 72 hours. The residual AUC was 
evaluated and found to be lower than 20% for all subjects indicating that the duration of sampling was 
sufficient. 
The population was chosen according to the guidelines.  
The monitoring reports of bioequivalence study “Study SIM26” are considered adequate.  
The bioanalytical method had satisfactory performance and was adequately validated. The pharmacokinetic 
and statistical methods applied were appropriate for a single dose study. The 90% confidence intervals for ln-
transformed pharmacokinetic variables Cmax and AUC0-t were within the conventional bioequivalence range 
of 80.00% to 125.00%. 
The pharmacokinetic variables for sitagliptin and metformin were comparable between test and reference 
product.  
The test (T) and reference (R) products were well tolerated by the study subjects. There was no serious 
adverse event in the study. 
Study SIM76 with Sitagliptin and Metformin HCl Tablets 50 mg/1000 mg film-coated tablets was conducted 
as an open label, randomised, three-treatment, three period, six sequence, single oral dose, three-way 
crossover bioequivalence study in healthy, adult, human subjects under fed condition.

adverse events were reported in the study. The adverse events reported were mild to moderate in severity 
and non-serious in nature. There was no serious adverse event reported in the study. 
The reported withdrawals/dropouts of both studies’ subjects were not major and had no impact on the 
outcome of the BE studies. 
Minor protocol and SOP deviations were reported with no impact on both studies’ results. 
Analytical and statistical methods were in line with the BE guideline and pre-specified in both studies’ 
protocol. 
Bioequivalence criteria proposed were in line with the EMA Bioequivalence guideline for the investigation of 
bioequivalence. As Sitagliptin and Metformin are not highly variable drugs according to the literature, the 
acceptance range of 80.00% – 125.00% for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters of Cmax and AUC0-t 
are accepted. 
The test products Sitagliptin fumarate/Metformin Hydrochloride film-coated tablets 50 mg/1000 mg and 
50mg/850mg (manufactured by Sun Pharmaceutical Ind. Ltd., Punjab, India) when compared with the 
Reference Products Janumet (Sitagliptin/Metformin Hydrochloride) film-coated tablets 50 mg/1000mg and 
50mg/850mg  (manufactured by Merck Sharp & Dohme) meets the bioequivalence criteria in terms of rate 
and extent of absorption after administration of single doses as set in the protocols of the two BE studies. 
With regards to the dissolution tests accompanying the BE studies, as required by paragraph 4.2.1 of the 
EMA Bioequivalence guidance, the results were not fully adequate.  
For the 75rpm, the dissolution profiles from those tests demonstrate similarity between test product and 
reference formulation in all media, as more than 85% of drug is released within 15 minutes, without the need 
for further mathematical calculations. 
However, at 50 rpm less than 85% of sitagliptin and metformin of the test product was dissolved within 85 
minutes in all other media of both formulations (50+850)mg and (50+1000)mg. Thus, the applicant

calculated the similarity factor, f2, of the comparative dissolution data between the test and reference 
product in agitation of 50 rpm, in all cases where 85% of dissolution is not achieved during the first 15 min, 
using dissolution data up to 20 min (85% of dissolution plus one time point as required in the Guideline for 
investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/ 98 Rev. 1/Corr**). 
In the submitted data, the value of the similarity factor f2 for (50+850)mg formulation: Metformin in 6.8 
phosphate buffer was off the appropriate limits. 
Additionally, as the condition set in the Guideline for investigation of Bioequivalence for calculation of f2 
factor is not fulfilled for comparison of dissolution profile of Sitagliptin+Metformin HCl Tablets 50+1000 mg 
versus Janumet Tablets 50+1000 mg in phosphate buffer pH 6.80, in acetate buffer pH 4.5 and in 0.025M 
sodium chloride at 50rpm, and the RSD in the second point of measurement exceeds the limit set in the 
guideline, the applicant submitted the evaluation of similarity by using the model independent approach 
“bootstrapping ƒ2 method” for comparison of dissolution profile between the test and reference product in 
agitation of 50 rpm in these media. 
In the submitted data, two values of the “bootstrapping ƒ2 method” ((for (50+850)mg formulation: 
Metformin in 0.025M NaCl & for (50+1000)mg formulation: Metformin in 6.8 phosphate buffer) were oustide 
the appropriate limits.   
According to the BE guideline, the dissolution studies are complementary to the BE studies and in the event 
that the results of the dissolution studies do not reflect bioequivalence as demonstrated in vivo, then the 
latter prevails. Therefore, the justification given by the applicant for these off-limit data is considered 
adequate.  
Furthermore, the applicant has committed to not market any batches until comparative dissolution profile 
testing has been completed and found similar, and to provide the results to EMA/CHMP/Rapporteur should 
the dissolution profiles not be similar, along with the proposed action to be taken.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the presented bioequivalence studies Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN is considered 
bioequivalent with Janumet. 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN and 
justifications that the different salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with 
regards to safety and efficacy of the reference product was  provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is  
in accordance with the relevant guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.  
Thus, the application is approvable from a clinical perspective.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of the combination of the two active substances 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride film-coated tablets.  
The reference product Janumet is indicated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus, for adult patients:  
- 
as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients inadequately 
controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin alone or those already being treated with 
the combination of sitagliptin and metformin.  
- 
In combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and 
exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a 
sulphonylurea.  
- 
as triple combination therapy with a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) 
agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately 
controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a PPARγ agonist.  
- 
as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to 
improve glycaemic control in patients when stable dose of insulin and metformin alone do not 
provide adequate glycaemic control. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
Two bioequivalence studies, one for each strength of the applied sitagliptin/metformin fixed dose combination 
product (50mg/850 mg and 50mg/1000mg), were submitted. The bioequivalence study SIM26 in strength of 
50 mg/850 mg forms the pivotal basis with an open label, balanced, randomised, two-treatment, two 
sequence, two-period, single dose crossover, bioequivalence study in healthy adult human subjects under fed 
condition. The bioequivalence study SIM76 in strength of 50 mg/1000 mg forms the pivotal basis with an 
open label, randomised, three-treatment, three period, six sequence, single oral dose, three-way crossover 
bioequivalence study in healthy, adult, human subjects under fed condition. 
The study design for both studies was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation 
and was in line with the respective European requirements. Bioequivalence studies have been performed with 
both strengths and under fed conditions in accordance with guidelines. Choice of dose, sampling points, 
overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Sitagliptin/Metformin Hydrochloride SUN in both strengths of 50 mg/850 mg and 50 
mg/1000 mg met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with the Janumet. The 
point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax were all 
contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of 
the two formulations in both strengths of 50 mg/850 mg and 50 mg/1000 mg was demonstrated. 
This application contains a different salt of the active substance. A summary of the literature with regard to 
non-clinical and clinical data of Sitagliptin/Metformin Hydrochloride SUN and justifications that the different 
salt of the active substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the 
reference product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant 
Assessment report  
EMA/290005/2023 
Page 39/41 
 
 
 
guideline and additional (non)-clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN is favourable in the following indication: 
For adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus: 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN is indicated as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve 
glycaemic control in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin 
alone or those already being treated with the combination of sitagliptin and metformin. 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN is indicated in combination with a sulphonylurea (i.e., triple 
combination therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their 
maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a sulphonylurea. 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN is indicated as triple combination therapy with a peroxisome 
proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) agonist (i.e., a thiazolidinedione) as an adjunct to diet 
and exercise in patients inadequately controlled on their maximal tolerated dose of metformin and a 
PPARγ agonist. 
Sitagliptin/Metformin hydrochloride SUN is also indicated as add-on to insulin (i.e., triple combination 
therapy) as an adjunct to diet and exercise to improve glycaemic control in patients when stable dose 
of insulin and metformin alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control.

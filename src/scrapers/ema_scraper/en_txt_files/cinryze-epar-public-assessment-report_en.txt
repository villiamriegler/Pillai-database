2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Angioedema attacks are the clinical symptom of a rare autosomal dominant disease caused by a 
deficiency of functional endogenous C1 inhibitor (C1 INH) activity. C1 INH is a serine protease inhibitor 
and acts as a regulator of the complement and contact pathways by the formation of pathway-specific 
complexes. Activation of these complexes, e.g. through trauma or serious infection, leads to 
consumption of C1 INH. C1 INH deficiency may result in a Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) attack. 
Attacks present as non-itching swellings of the skin or mucosa, which may affect extremities, face, 
trunk, gastrointestinal tract, genitourinary system, or larynx. Laryngeal swelling can be life-threatening 
and these attacks account for the mortality risk described for HAE.  
Different therapies are available for HAE disease including Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP), attenuated 
androgens, antifibrinolytics, the bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Icatibant, and C1 INH preparations. 
Attenuated androgens increase hepatic production of C1 INH protein but are associated with safety and 
tolerability issues. They are not suitable for the treatment of acute attacks and should be avoided in 
women of child-bearing potential and children. Antifibrinolytic agents inhibit plasminogen activation 
with consequent “sparing” of C1 INH consumption but are recognized as less effective for the control of 
HAE than the attenuated androgens. All antifibrinolytics bear the risk of thromboembolic events. The 
synthetic bradykinin B2 receptor antagonist Icatibant is suitable for treatment of acute attacks, not for 
prophylactic therapy. It acts by competitive interference at the level of the bradykinin B2 receptor, 
while C1 INH raises the functional C1 INH level. The mechanisms of action are thus different between 
Icatibant and C1 INH. C1 INH concentrate products increase serum levels of C1 INH activity and 
temporarily restore the natural regulation of the contact, complement, and fibrinolytic systems, 
thereby controlling the swelling or the propensity to swell. A recombinant C1 INH product has recently 
been granted marketing authorisation in the indication treatment of HAE-attacks. The indication 
routine prevention of angioedema attacks is not approved within the EU.  
Cinryze belongs to human plasma derived C1 INH products. The applicant applied for the following 
indication: 
 
Treatment and prevention of angioedema attacks in adults, adolescents and children with C1 
inhibitor deficiency.  
As a result of evaluation of available data the agreed indication for Cinryze is: 
 
 
Treatment and pre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents with 
hereditary angioedema (HAE). 
Routine prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents with severe and recurrent 
attacks of hereditary angioedema (HAE), who are intolerant to or insufficiently protected by oral 
prevention treatments, or patients who are inadequately managed with repeated acute 
treatment. 
Marketing authorisation dossier is an application according to Article 8.3 (new active substance) of 
Directive 2001/83/EC, as amended - complete and independent application.  
Cinryze was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/09/668 on 08-10-2009 in the following 
indication:  Treatment of angioedema caused by C1-inhibitor deficiency. The calculated prevalence of 
this condition was estimated as 2.1 per 10,000 EU population. Following ViroPharma’s request, Cinryze 
was removed from the Community register of orphan medicinal products in April 2011.

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Cinryze is a heat-treated, nanofiltered C1 inhibitor product, purified from human plasma for 
fractionation. It is presented as lyophilized powder and solvent for solution for injection for the 
proposed indication. The product is reconstituted with Water for Injections (5 ml) resulting in 100 U/ml 
C1-inhibitor, with one unit (U) of C1-inhibitor corresponding to the C1-inhibitor activity in one millilitre 
of normal human plasma. Cinryze is marketed in secondary packaging containing 2 vials of drug 
product (500 IU) and 2 vials of solvent WFI.  A transfer device and administration set are part of the 
secondary packaging. Accordance of the devices with the Council Directive 93/42/EEC, as well as 
compatibility of the devices with Cinryze finished product is demonstrated 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Manufacture 
Starting material 
The starting material for the manufacturing process of Cinryze active drug substance is "plasma for 
fractionation" according to Ph. Eur. monograph 07/2008:0853. Plasma is provided in the Netherlands 
by Sanquin, and in Belgium by CAF-DCF cvba-scrl (CAF-DCF, a subsidiary of Sanquin) and in Finland 
by the Finnish Red Cross Blood Service (FRC). Information on the source, collection, separation and 
control of the human plasma used as the starting material of Cinryze is provided in the relevant Plasma 
Master Files of Sanquin and CAF-DCF, respectively. 
The purified and concentrated C1 INHC1 INH after pasteurization and nanofiltration is considered as 
the active substance. All other raw materials are of Ph. Eur. quality or they are qualified according to in 
house specifications. 
In 2008 Cinryze was approved by the FDA and is also produced for the US market. Several studies in 
this dossier were conducted with American plasma, although US plasma is not covered by this licence 
application.  
Manufacture 
The manufacture starts from individual donations that are pooled to make a plasma pool for 
fractionation. The batch formula is specified to indicate the validated number of donations that can be 
pooled for further processing.  
The manufacturing process for the drug substance is described in sufficient detail. The manufacturing 
process of Cinryze is basically identical to Cetor including an additional nanofiltration step to improve 
viral safety. With the introduction of the nanofiltration step the addition of HepB-IgG to the CM eluate 
before pasteurisation was discontinued.  
After separation of the cryo-precipitate and adsorption of the Vit K dependent coagulation factors, the 
cryo- and 4F-depleted plasma serves as intermediate for further purification of the C1 INHC1 INH. The 
first homogenous pool (cryo-poor plasma) is subject to viral marker testing in compliance with Ph. Eur. 
requirements of plasma for fractionation. Acceptable limits for total viable counts of PB19 are specified.  
The cryo and 4F-depleted plasma is particle-filtered, followed by diafiltration/ultrafiltration to 
concentrate the solution. The material is loaded on an ion exchange column to capture C1 INHC1 INH.  
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 8/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
The eluted material (eluate) is further processed or stored. After pH adjustment of the eluate, the C1 
INHC1 INH containing filtrate is collected. Upon dilution with WFI the material is loaded on an ion 
exchange column via serial filtration units. After washing the column, the eluate is eluted and pH 
adjusted. The eluate may be processed or stored. The eluate is stabilized with appropriate stabilisers 
and concentrated. Trisodium citrate and sucrose is added and the solution is heat-treated 
(pasteurization).  
The pasteurized material is diafiltered and concentrated via haemodialysis filter, filtered and stored 
overnight. Finally the product is serially filtered and nanofiltrated. The nanofiltrate is concentrated via 
haemodialysis cartridge and is filtered (“C1 INHC1 INH pasteurized filtrate” representing the bulk drug 
substance). At this step, the product is immediately processed or can be stored for up to two years.  
The ion exchange columns are regenerated for repeated use by a validated process, column re-use 
cycle numbers have been specified.  
Process validation 
Validation studies were performed on three conformance lots manufactured from American plasma, 
manufactured according to the manufacturing process for Cinryze as reported in this dossier.  
The set of in process controls established -mostly on the column eluates and the nanofiltrate- indicates 
that the manufacturing process is sufficiently robust to generate a bulk product of acceptable 
consistent quality. The equipment used in the manufacture of Cinryze has been subject to validation 
and regular re-validation, and a consistent equipment performance is demonstrated. The re-use of the 
ion exchange columns runs has been validated. The freeze-drier is fully validated.  
During manufacture several intermediates can be combined for further processing without detectable 
effect on the process or product quality. The entire set of pooling options has been specified.  
Impurities 
During the manufacturing of C1-inhibitor the coagulation factors are removed by adsorption. Any 
residual activity was removed during further processing and no activity is detectable in the drug 
substance pasteurised nanofiltrate. About 20 % of total protein in Cinryze finished product appear to 
be impurities and a specification limit for newly identified impurities has still to be set (condition). As a 
consequence, a purity specification for C1 inhibitor protein should be set as well (condition).  Validity of 
test assays for impurites is shown. 
Process-related impurities are reduced to very low level and are of no toxicological concern. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical test methods are compendial methods for which no further information is presented or 
these are validated in house tests.  
Batch analysis 
The test parameters on the bulk drug substance meet requirements and are supportive of a bulk 
substance of consistent quality. Microbial load is measured before the final sterile filtration step, and 
endotoxin testing is conducted on the pasteurized filtrate (bulk drug substance prior to 1st sterile 
filtration) in order to assure low bioburden during the manufacture of the bulk drug substance.  
Reference Standards or Materials 
Sanquin uses an in-house reference standard for determination of the C1-inhibitor activity because no 
international standard was available at the start of the procedure. The C1 inhibitor reference standard 
is considered acceptable and sufficiently qualified as an activity standard. A written procedure is in 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 9/64
 
 
 
 
place explaining how the C1-esterase inhibitor concentrate control has to be prepared, handled and 
stored. This batch of purified C1 INH is used as an in-house reference control sample.  The applicant 
will fulfil the condition to calibrate an in-house concentrate standard against the WHO 1st International 
Standard for C1-inhibitor, concentrate NIBSC code: 08/256 not later than Q4 2011. A control sample 
representative of the commercial Cinryze finished product has to be established in conjunction with the 
implementation of the WHO 1st International C1 esterase inhibitor concentrate standard. A retest 
period has to be be defined once the reference material is calibrated against the international 
standard.  
Container/closure 
The container used for the storage of the eluates and the Pasteurised filtrate (Drug Substance) is a 
polyethylene container. Further information regarding the qualification of the plastic material for long-
term storage of intermediate, in particular with respect to leachables entering the product is 
recommended by CHMP. 
Stability 
The applicant has presented data for three conformance lots of drug substance according to the final 
manufacturing process stored over 36 months. Stability of the drug substance under these conditions 
has been demonstrated satisfactorily, however the initial claim is for 24 months and this should 
remain.  Stability data were originally presented for key intermediates.  
Sufficient stability data have been presented for cryo- and 4F depleted plasma; eluates (without HepB 
IgG) manufactured at Sanquin to support the claimed 24 month shelf-life for intermediate eluate  
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
Cinryze is supplied as a sterile, pyrogen-free single-use freeze-dried powder. The nominal fill size is 
500 U per vial to be reconstituted with 5 ml solvent WFI provided in a separate vial. Each secondary 
package of Cinryze contains 2 drug product vials of 500 IU and 2 vials of WFI. The freeze-dried powder 
is white to light blue, yielding a colourless to light blue solution upon reconstitution. The formulation 
buffer of Cinryze includes only components of non-animal origin, added to achieve isotonic conditions 
and to stabilize the product during the lyophilisation process.   
For marketing, Cinryze is presented as two 500 U vials instead one 1000 U vial. In all clinical studies 
always 1000 U are administered at a time, requiring prior pooling of two vials. This unnecessarily 
complicates the reconstitution process and the patient treatment and may increase the risk of 
microbial contamination during pooling. The applicant proposes to replace the 2 vials of 500 U by 1 vial 
of 1000 U once the product has received approval.  
The transfer and administration devices are in accordance with Council Directive 93/42/EEC, as 
amended by Directive 2007/47/EC. Compatiblilty of the devices with Cinryze finished product is 
demonstrated.  
The composition of the final product contains trisodium citrate, sodium chloride, L-valine, L-alanine, L-
threonine and sucrose. 
Cinryze is provided in colourless glass vials (type I glass, Ph.Eur.) of 8 ml. Water for Injections is 
provided in colourless glass vials (type I glass, Ph.Eur.) of 11 ml. Vials of product and Water for 
Injections are closed with bromobutyl stoppers (Ph.Eur.) and sealed with aluminium cap.

Manufacture of the product 
The finished product is produced from bulk drug substance lots. After a second sterilisation step in a 
grade A area the solution is filled into vials and immediately loosely stoppered. Next, the content of the 
vials is frozen, freeze-dried and the vials are closed. The vials are visually inspected, vacuum 
controlled and subjected to quality control testing. Finally, labelling and packaging is performed.  
Process validation 
The buffer production and vial depyrogenisation is sufficiently validated, aseptic conditions during the 
filling process are confirmed by regular media fill runs. Complete validation data for the freeze-drier 
used in the manufacture of Cinryze are presented to demonstrate that this step is consistent and 
robust. All excipients used in the preparation of the finished product are stated to be of Ph. Eur. quality. 
Product specification 
The finished product specifications after reconstitution describe an isotonic product with a pH and 
osmolality in the physiologic range. Although there is no specific monograph for C1 inhibitor from 
human plasma, the specifications of critical parameters are in the range of comparable blood products 
for intravenous administration 
The parameters used in the release testing of the finished product are sufficient to ensure a well-
controlled drug product, although some limits need to be tightened post-approval. Test methods are 
mostly compendial and details are provided. Non-compendial methods are described in sufficient detail 
and are fully validated.  
The level of plasma-derived impurities in the final product has mostly been clarified. There are no 
purity/identity specifications and in some cases these may be required, depending on the levels of 
impurities present and the implications for product safety. As a consequence, the applicant has to set 
specifications for the impurities.  
To ensure the consistency of the potency and the purity of the finished product, the applicant should 
fulfill the following conditions: 
 
to tighten the finished product specifications for C1 inhibitor activity, for specific activity, and for 
pH. The adjustment should be based on a statistically significant number of historical and 
commercial Cinryze batches representative of the current manufacturing process. The 
specifications have to be implemented by Q4 2011. 
 
to add a release specification to the finished product for purity of C1 inhibitor protein, 
determined by a validated, quantitative assay. The specification has to be implemented by Q4 
2011. 
 
to add specifications for the recently identified impurities. The new specifications should be 
implemented in conjunction with the introduction of the 1st I. S. for C1 inhibitor by Q4 2011.  
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life of the drug product is 36 month at 2-25°C. The shelf life claim is based on data 
from 9 full scale lots. An in-use stability of 24 h at 20°C is supported by data; an in-use shelf life of 3 h 
at room temperature (15-25°C) is stated in the SPC. Respective studies were conducted in compliance 
to ICH recommendations and support the shelf life claim.

Adventitious agents 
Cinryze (C1-inhibitor) is produced from human source plasma. Three steps of the production process 
precipitation, pasteurisation and filtration were validated for their virus inactivating/removing capacity 
including robustness studies. Enveloped viruses are effectively inactivated during precipitation, 
pasteurisation and the filtration step. In addition, the filtration step is essential for the safety of 
Cinryze especially with respect to non enveloped viruses, including both Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and 
Canine Parvovirus (CPV) an animal model virus for human parvovirus B19. HAV and CPV removal 
capacity was demonstrated during filtration. As expected, HAV was only moderately inactivated during 
the pasteurisation step. The animal model parvovirus CPV was not inactivated during this step. An 
effective removal of CPV was observed using precipitation. In summary, the virus safety of Cinryze has 
been adequately demonstrated. 
No animal-derived TSE risk material added at production was identified. Therefore, the TSE safety of 
Cinryze seems to be adequately demonstrated. 
In addition, the production process of Cinryze has been investigated for its capacity to remove prions. 
According to guideline CPMP/BWP/CPMP/5136/03 investigational study reports for TSE removal steps 
during the production process of Cinryze have been provided. 
Drug Product (WFI)  
Potable city water is the source for the production of purified water according monograph 0008 of Ph.

satisfactory consistency and uniformity of important quality characteristics. Although the quality of the 
drug product is controlled by adequate test methods and specifications, the applicant should include 
additional specifications for purity and for the recently identified impurities and should calibrate in-
house reference material against the WHO 1st international standard in order to ensure the continuous 
consistency of the potency and purity of the product. The viral safety and the safety concerning other 
adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently assured. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The overall quality of the product has been demonstrated. Based on the review of the data on quality, 
the application for Cinryze is approvable.  
In order to ensure the continuous consistency of the potency and purity of the finished product, the 
applicant should fulfill the conditions in section 2.2.3. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The nonclinical testing strategy for Cinryze took into consideration the applicable guidelines for plasma 
derived products as well as the data from successive development of C1 INH products.  
Cinryze is a further development of the C1 INH product Cetor, which is approved via Mutual 
Recognition procedure. The Note for Guidance on Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology-derived 
Pharmaceuticals CPMP/ICH/302/95, which is applicable to plasma derived products, does not require a 
conventional non-clinical programme for the investigation of human proteins. Thus, the extent of 
additional nonclinical studies with Cinryze was limited.  
Overall, the non-clinical development program was conducted to establish the safety of Cinryze for 
short-term use. No additional pharmacodynamic data was generated for this plasma-derived C1 INH. 
The in vivo pharmacokinetics of C1 INH were assessed within the toxicity studies. The nonclinical 
toxicology programme included one acute and two repeated-dose toxicity studies in rats. Local 
tolerability was investigated histophathologically within toxicity studies at the site of tail vein 
administration. Further toxicity studies were performed to address potential reproductive and 
developmental toxicity: embryo-fetal development and maternal toxicity were studied in dose-range 
finding and full embryo-fetal development studies in rats. Additionally, results from studies testing the 
thrombogenic or immunogenic potential were presented, however within these studies predecessor 
products have been used.  
According to the applicant the toxicology studies were GLP compliant. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
No specific studies were performed with Cinryze. However, the Applicant summarised the extensive 
knowledge of the pharmacodynamic properties of other C1 INH preparations, which is also applicable 
to Cinryze. Therefore lack of such studies is regarded as justified. 
C1 INH inhibits the complement system and of the contact system (intrinsic clotting). The effect on the 
complement system is achieved via binding of C1 INH to C1r and C1s – two of the active subunits of 
the first component of the complement system. Binding of C1 INH to factor XIIa and to kallikrein leads 
to the inhibition of the contact system.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies were performed, which was regarded acceptable in view of the 
existing knowledge about C1 INH. 
Safety pharmacology programme  
No specific safety pharmacology studies were conducted, which was regarded acceptable in view of the 
existing knowledge about C1 INH. 
Studies on thrombogenicity are presented and discussed in the toxicology part. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No specific studies on pharmacodynamic drug interactions were performed, which was regarded 
acceptable in view of the existing knowledge about C1 INH and the fact that Cinryze is a plasma 
derived human protein product. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The in vivo pharmacokinetic of C1 INH was assessed as part of the toxicity studies in rats treated with 
Cinryze at dose levels of 20, 100 and 400 U/kg. The assay of functional C1 INH concentrations was 
performed using a validated ELISA based on a commercially available C1 INH kit. 
Following single-dose IV administration, the exposure as reflected by area under the plasma 
concentration-time (AUClast) values, increased dose-proportionally. The highest AUClast values were 
achieved after administration of 400 U/kg, resulting in values of 83452 and 75378 mU·h/mL in males 
and female rats, respectively. The terminal half-life of C1 INH ranged between 6.5 and 8.5 hours (see 
Table 1). No major gender-related differences in systemic C1 INH exposure, accumulation, plasma 
clearance and volume of distribution of C1 INH were noted.

In general, a similar kinetic profile was observed after single and repeated IV administration of Cinryze 
for 2 weeks (Study No. DD0002). As shown in Table 2, exposure, as reflected by AUClast values 
generally increased slightly more than dose-proportionally between the lowest and highest dose. 
Exposure was generally comparable for both sexes.

a accurate determination not possible 
As an endogenous human plasma protein, C1 INH is not subject to metabolism by Cytochrome P450 
isoenzymes, excretion, or pharmacokinetic interactions exhibited by many low molecular weight 
compounds. No in vitro or in vivo metabolism or excretion studies were conducted as the expected 
consequence of metabolism of a glycoprotein is via degradation to small peptides and individual amino 
acids. No specific studies assessing tissue distribution or protein binding were performed. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity  
The acute toxicity of C1 INH was studied in Sprague-Dawley rats (Study No. DD0004). Animals 
(4/sex/group) were dosed intravenously with C1 INH via the tail vein at dosages of 20, 100, and 400 
U/kg in sterile water to provide a physiologic solution from reconstituted lyophilized product. A control 
group (4/sex) received isotonic phosphate buffered saline (PBS) via the same route. Animals were 
frequently observed until 24 hours after dosing. 
There were neither clinical signs nor effects on body weight, body weight gain, hematology, or clinical 
chemistry. No necropsy findings or effects on organ weight were attributed to the administration of C1 
INH. The histopathological examination of tissues revealed a number of common background changes 
in several tissues but these were expected for rats of this age and strain. 
Repeat dose toxicity  
7 days repeat dose toxicity study 
A 7-day repeat dose toxicity study (4 rats/sex/group) was conducted using a control group and only 
one dose level of 400 U/kg (Study No. DD0004). No effects were observed on body weights, food 
consumption, hematology, and clinical chemistry. There were no macroscopic findings at necropsy 
attributed to administration of C1 INH. No histopathological evaluation was performed. The NOEL for 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 15/64
 
 
 
this study was set at 400 U/kg since a maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not established in this 7-
day toxicology evaluation in rats. 
14 days repeat dose toxicity study 
In a definite repeat dose toxicity study (study no. DD0002) 10 rats/sex/group were dosed once daily 
for 14 days with 0, 20, 100, or 400 U/kg of C1 INH. Parameters evaluated included clinical signs, 
mortality, body weight, food consumption, hematology, clinical chemistry, urine analysis, 
ophthalmoscopy, immune response, organ weight, and anatomic pathology. Satellite animals were 
incorporated for toxicokinetic evaluation. In addition, blood was drawn for the evaluation of 
neutralizing antibodies to product and endogenous C1 INH; baseline anti-C1 INH was established prior 
to dosing and then on Day 14 of dosing.  
One vehicle control group male died on Day 9 immediately after dosing; however this was thought to 
be due to an air bubble present in the syringe and not related to the vehicle control (PBS). No clinical 
signs were observed during the 14-day dosing period. Several animals showed signs of scabbing, hair 
loss and/or lesion at the place where the transponder for identification of the animal was implanted, 
but these signs were attributed to implantation of the transponder and not related to treatment. There 
was no treatment-related mortality, alterations in body weight gain, food consumption, 
ophthalmoscopy, or urinalysis. 
Hematology parameters (Hb, RBC, HCT, MCH, MCHC, platelets, reticulocytes, neutrophils, eosinophils, 
basophils, fibrinogen, PT, and APTT) were not influenced by doses up to 400 U/kg following acute or 
repeated dosing. White blood cell count, particularly lymphocytes and monocytes were statistically 
increased compared to vehicle control animals at Day 15 in female animals at all doses. This finding 
was not observed in males and was not dose-dependent. 
There were no toxicologically significant changes in any clinical chemistry parameters (including Na, K, 
Cl, urea, total protein, albumin, globulins, albumin/globulin ratio, ALP, AST, ALT, cholesterol, 
creatinine, Ca, total bilirubin, inorganic phosphate and triglycerides) following acute or repeat dosing. 
A significant increase in relative spleen weight was noted in both sexes at 400 U/kg. A slight increase 
in relative lung weight was noted at the same dosage. Notable inflammatory changes in the lungs and 
spleen germinal center hypertrophy were noted at 400 U/kg. 
A dose-dependent positive IgG and anti-C1 INH response was observed in most animals. There was a 
positive trend in anti-C1 INH response as a function of dose. These results were not unexpected based 
on the species dissimilarity of a human protein administered to a rat. 
Although histopathology findings were noted in the lungs and spleen following repeated daily 
administration of C1 INH in rats for 14 days, these effects were minor and the toxicological significance 
of these was equivocal, therefore the NOEL was considered to be 400 U/kg. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were performed, which was regarded acceptable since plasma derived human 
proteins are unlikely to interact directly with DNA or other chromosomal material. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were performed, which was regarded acceptable for plasma derived human 
protein triggering development of antibodies in animals.

Reproduction Toxicity 
In dose-range finding study No. DD0001 rats (6/group) were dosed with 20, 100 or 400 U/kg from 
Gestation Day (GD) 6 through GD 17 and euthanized on GD 20, no clinical or necropsy findings were 
attributed to C1 INH. Intergroup differences in body weight gain and food consumption were 
considered too small to be attributed to treatment and values for pregnancy performance and fetal 
weights were similar in all groups. 
Exposure to C1 INH in pregnant animals (at dose levels of 20, 100 and 400 U/kg) was comparable to 
that observed in non-pregnant animals (Study No. DD0002).  
In study No. DD0003 20 rats/group were dosed with 20, 100, or 400 U/kg from GD 6 until GD 17 and 
euthanized on GD 20. No clinical observations or necropsy findings were considered to be treatment-
related. Mean body weight gains, food consumption, pregnancy performance values were similar in all 
groups. A slightly lower number of live implants observed at 400 U/kg reflected the lower number of 
corpora lutea at this level. Marginal differences in mean fetal weight and sex ratio were considered to 
be incidental and the type and distribution of the fetal abnormalities and variants, including those 
indicating the state of skeletal ossification, were similar in all groups and did not indicate any effect of 
treatment. 
Under the conditions of this study, 400 U/kg was identified as the NOEL and NOAEL for both maternal 
and fetal effects. 
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic data has been generated in study DD002 and is summarised above. 
Local Tolerance 
No special local tolerance studies were conducted, however, local tolerability was evaluated in toxicity 
studies, which is acceptable and in line with Note for Guidance CPMP/ICH/302/95. Within studies 
DD0002 and DD0004, vascular effects of Cinryze application were evaluated histophathologically at the 
site of tail vein administration and revealed no limited tolerability. Some irritant effects have been 
observed, but can be explained with application of human proteins in rats. Furthermore, clinical data is 
available and show low incidence of local reactions. No further investigations on local tolerance are 
deemed necessary. 
Other toxicity studies 
In-vitro thrombogenicity testing of the Cinryze predecessor C1 INH-HP implicate that activated vitamin 
K-dependent coagulation factors, which are thought to be responsible for thrombogenic side effects, 
are not present in C1 INH-HP. Within the in-vivo thrombogenicity testing (Wessler test), using also C1 
INH-HP, a thrombogenic threshold was defined at doses greater than 200 U/kg. 
An immunotoxicity study was carried out to determine if the pasteurization step (10 h at 60°C) in the 
manufacture of C1 INH-HP, an earlier generation product of C1 INH, causes the formation of neo-
epitopes on the C1 esterase inhibitor protein (Study No. DD0005). Rabbits received intramuscular (IM; 
12 weeks) or IV (6 weeks) immunizations with C1 INH-HP, and sera of these rabbits were examined 
for the presence of antibodies. As expected, rabbits have no natural cross-reacting antibodies that can 
recognize human C1 INH-HP. In both groups of immunized rabbits, strong anti-C1 INH responses were 
found at 1 week after a single immunisation. Subsequent detailed analyses comparing nonpasteurized 
C1 INH intermediate product and pasteurized C1 INH final product were performed using enzyme 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 17/64
 
 
 
linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), competitive ELISA, crossimmunoelectrophoresis, and double 
immunodiffusion. These techniques did not detect any antibodies that were specifically directed against 
pasteurized C1 INH and not to nonpasteurized C1 INH. Therefore there are no indications that the 
pasteurization step in the manufacture of C1 INH causes formation of neo-epitopes on the C1 INH 
protein. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Guideline on the Environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) states that “aminoacids and proteins […] are exempted [of environmental 
risk assessment] because they are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment”, therefore, 
an environmental risk assessment is not required. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Concerning the primary and secondary pharmacodynamics no specific studies were performed with 
Cinryze, but the applicant refers to extensive knowledge of the pharmacodynamic properties of other 
C1 INH products. This approach is considered acceptable. 
In pharmacokinetic studies, after single dosing exposure, as reflected by AUClast values, increased 
dose-proportionally between the lowest and the highest dose with exposure in females comparable to 
or somewhat lower than those in males. Other pharmacokinetic parameters (e.g., t½, Cl, and Vd) were 
comparable in males and females. The terminal half-life of functional C1 INH ranged between 6.5 and 
8.5 hours. In general, a similar kinetic profile was observed after single and repeated IV administration 
of Cinryze for 2 weeks. AUClast values generally increased slightly more than dose-proportionally 
between the lowest and highest dose. Exposure was generally comparable for both sexes. The 
administration of C1 INH was associated with an expected antibody response due to administration of 
a human protein to rats therefore negating the value of dosing longer than about two weeks. 
Overall, the provided PK data are considered sufficient. Though data as obtained within one species 
only are considered sparse, further animal pharmacokinetic data are not considered necessary for the 
particular type of product and also in view of the available clinical data. 
In general the number and design of toxicology studies are considered acceptable. The omission of a 
second relevant species has been justified by the Applicant and is based on the fact that pharmacology 
of the human C1 INH protein is well characterised and clinical experience has been obtained. 
Results of single dose and repeat dose toxicity studies in rats revealed no safety signals over the dose 
range tested. In the repeat dose toxicity study histopathology findings were noted in the lungs and 
spleen, but as these effects were minor and the toxicological significance was considered equivocal, the 
NOEL was considered to be 400 U/kg. 
C1 INH was tested for reproductive toxicity, local tolerance and thrombogenicity, and was found to be 
without notable toxicity. Immunotoxicity study revealed no additional immunogenicity as compared to 
nonpasteurized C1 INH. 
The results of toxicity testing revealed no safety signals up to doses corresponding to maximum 28-
fold the recommended human dose (which is 1000 IU), based on an average adult body weight of 70 
kg. Thus, from the presented data no safety concerns arise against the use of Cinryze in the intended 
dose range.  
Cinryze

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The preclinical testing strategy is regarded as appropriate in view of the facts that the product is a 
preparation of a human protein, clinical experience has already been obtained and data for other C1 
INH products is available. The applicable regulatory guidelines were taken into consideration 
adequately. From the presented data no safety concerns arise against the use in the intended dose 
range. The presented preclinical data is considered appropriate and sufficient. The wording of the 
SmPC reflecting non-clinical aspects is considered appropriate.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of antigenic and functional C1 INH were primarily evaluated from results of 
study LEVP2006-5, a randomized open-label, parallel group clinical pharmacology study designed to 
evaluate PK and PD in non-symptomatic HAE subjects given one or two 1000 U doses of Cinryze. Study 
included subjects 18 years or older who were currently or previously enrolled in LEVP 2005-1 Subjects 
in single dose group received a single dose of 1000 U, while subjects in double dose group received a 
first dose of 1000 U followed by a second dose of 1000 U after 1 hour. Serial blood samples, taken 
over a 7-day period, were assayed for antigenic and functional C1 INHC1 INH and complement C4. 
Antigenic C1 INH and Complement C4 levels were determined by validated immunoturbidimetric 
assays. Quantification of functional C1 INH protein was performed with a validated commercially 
available enzyme inhibition immunoassay. 
For the antigenic C1 INH the applicant’s assays were presented as mg/dl and the defined normal range 
was 21-39 mg/dl (1.23 U/L - 2.29 U/L according to the conversion factor provided by the Applicant). 
The assay used for functional C1 INH states that the reference “normal range” is >68% (corresponding 
to 0.68 U/ml according to the conversion factor provided by the Applicant). 
A total of 27 subjects were randomized and treated. Of these, 13 received a single dose (1000 U dose) 
and 14 received a single 1000 U dose followed by a second dose of 1000 U administered 1 hour after 
completion of the first dose. Baseline concentrations of antigenic and functional C1 INHC1 INH were 
approximately 0.8 and 0.3 U/mL, respectively. These low baseline concentrations (<1 U/mL) confirmed 
that these HAE subjects were deficient in C1 INHC1 INH levels. 
The mean pharmacokinetic parameters for antigenic and functional C1 INH obtained in this study are 
displayed in the following tables.

Table 5.  Mean (+/-SD) pharmacokinetic parameters for functional C1 INH in HAE subjects following 
administration of Cinryze in Study LEVP 2006-5  
According to the baseline levels of antigenic C1 INH, all subjects were below the “normal range”. 
Following administration of C1 INH, the mean Cmax level was within the “normal range” with a very 
wide SD (1.44 U/ml) meaning that many subjects did not reach the normal range even at Cmax post-
infusion.   
Cmax for functional C1 INH together with the antigenic C1 INH data suggest that the single 1000U 
dose may be on the borderline for achieving levels within the defined normal range. 
Additional PK data were obtained in placebo-controlled studies LEVP 2005-1/A and LEVP 2005-1/B; the 
data is presented in the below tables. For details on the study design see section “Clinical efficacy”.

The applicant was requested by CHMP to provide PK data analysed also by U/Kg dose received for both 
antigenic C1 INH and functional C1 INH.  
For study LEVP 2006-5 body weight was not collected, which precluded formal evaluation of PK 
parameters on a U/kg basis. However, body weight data were available for 7 patients who had also 
participated in study LEVP 2005-1/A, which allowed such calculation. Please see below table for the 
results.

Table 8.  Baseline-corrected Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-inf Parameters Normalized by Dose and Body 
Weight for Selected Subjects in Study LEVP 2006-5 
No correlation was found between the dose normalized by body weight and the observed increase from 
baseline with respect to Cmax for C1 INH antigen or functional C1 INH activity.  
Additional PK data adjusted by body weight was derived from main pivotal study for treatment of acute 
attacks (LEVP 2005-1/B), where no correlation was found between the dose normalized by body weight 
and the pre-to post-infusion changes of C1 INH antigen or functional C1 INH activity. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In study LEVP2006-5 2-fold increase in dose led to increase in maximum plasma concentrations 
(Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), but not in a dose proportional 
manner. The reason for this lower-than-expected PK response is unknown. 
Increases in functional C1 INH activity were independent of duration of study participation indicating 
consistent pharmacokinetics over repeated Cinryze administrations. 
Special populations 
Supportive PK data were provided from open-label studies LEVP 2006-1 and LEVP 2006-4, which 
allowed for inclusion of children above the age of 1 year. 
In general, children and adults received a fixed dose of 1000 U of Cinryze. The age group of the 2-5 
year old was only represented by in total 3 subjects. It is of note that the single child in this age group 
in study LEVP 2006-1 (2 years old) as well as one 3 year-old in LEVP 2006-4 received only 500 Units, 
but presented very high functional responses.

Age in Study LEVP 2006-1           
Maximal levels could even be higher, since tmax has not been determined for children. Based on these 
results, dose recommendations for the use in children cannot be established. It is noted that the dose 
for children initially proposed by the Applicant (1000 U plus optional second 1000 U) could especially 
for small children be too high and that safety risks e.g. thrombogenicity cannot be excluded. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies have not been performed, which was regarded acceptable in view 
of the existing knowledge about C1 INH and the fact that Cinryze is a plasma derived human protein 
product. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
Pharmacokinetic studies using human biomaterials have not been performed , which was regarded 
acceptable in view of the existing knowledge about C1 INH. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Since C1 INH is an endogenous protein, the pharmacodynamics and mechanism of action are well 
known and no pharmacodynamic studies were performed in healthy subjects. 
Mechanism of action 
The primary function of C1 INH is to regulate activation of the complement and contact pathways. This 
is accomplished through the formation of pathway-specific complexes that result in inactivation of the 
target protease and consumption of C1 INH. C1 inhibitor inhibits the complement system by binding 
C1r and C1s, two of the active enzyme subunits of the first component of the complement system (C1) 
in the classical pathway. The primary substrate of the activated C1 enzyme is C4; uninhibited C1 
results in diminished C4 levels. An increase in C4 levels is therefore a surrogate measure of the 
biological effect of Cinryze. 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 25/64
 
 
 
 
C1 inhibitor regulates the contact system and the intrinsic coagulation (kallikrein-kinin) pathway by 
binding to and inactivating kallikrein and factor XIIa. Because these pathways are part of enzyme 
amplification cascades, without C1 INH, spontaneous or trigger-induced activation of these pathways 
can lead to unopposed activation and swelling. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamic effect of Cinryze on C4 levels was primarily evaluated in Study LEVP 2006-5. 
Figure 2.  Mean Concentrations of Complement C4 in HAE Subjects Following Administration of 
Cinryze in Study LEVP 2006-5 
The applicant was requested by CHMP to provide PD data analysed also by U/Kg dose received. Such 
data were available for 7 patients (see PK section).

2005-1/A 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 26/64
 
 
 
 
 
 
Administration of 1000 U or 2000 U of Cinryze to non-symptomatic HAE subjects resulted in increase in 
complement C4 levels, which for most subjects were the highest one to two days post-infusion. This 
increase was not dose-proportional but in similar relation to the dose as observed with functional C1 
INH levels. 
No correlation was found between the dose normalized by body weight and obtained complement C4 
levels. 
Additional PD data was derived from Study LEVP 2005-1/A. Pre-infusion, the mean values of C4 
antigenic activity were below normal and similar in both the Cinryze group (8.1 mg/dL) and the 
placebo group (6.7 mg/dL). There was a statistically significant (p=0.0017) difference in the changes 
in mean values from baseline between the treatment groups at 12 hours, demonstrating the 
association of Cinryze therapy with an increase in C4 activity (Cinryze +2.9 mg/dL vs. placebo 
+0.1 mg/dL). 
The normal range for C4 (using the immunoturbidimetric assay) is 16-70mg/dl and was not achieved 
with a single dose in either study. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK data provided show that the half-life (56 ± 35 hrs for C1 INHC1 INH function) and volume of 
distribution (2.9 ± 3.12L) are as expected for a C1 INH.  Although the half-life of Cinryze was shown to 
be relatively long, twice weekly administrations of 1000 U did not significantly increase the steady 
state (pre-infusion) levels of C1 INH, thus giving no evidence of accumulation. Cmax and AUC increased 
from single to double dose, but not in a dose-proportional way. Placebo-controlled studies LEVP 2005-
1/A and LEVP 2005-1/B revealed statistically significant increases from baseline in antigenic and 
functional C1 INH levels in the Cinryze treatment group compared to the placebo group. 
PK data from the pivotal trial LEVP 2005-1/Part A show that for the patients (n=35) who were tested 1 
hour after 1000 U the C1 INHC1 INH function was 67.7% (SD 21.9) meaning that many subjects do 
not reach the normal C1 INH level of >68%.  The CHMP questioned the proposed fixed dose regardless 
of weight in view of the lack of dose finding studies, the low achieved levels of antigenic and functional 
C1 INH, and PD parameter C4 after dosing with 1000 U . The Applicant argued that levels of C1 INH 
have not been shown to be associated with the severity of the disease, although all patients have low 
C1 INH or a nonfunctioning protein (Frank et al., 1976). Patients who have a mildly decreased C1 INH 
level may have severe clinical symptoms and patients who have severely depressed levels may have 
mild manifestations of the disease. The reasons for this are unclear but are likely to be multifactorial 
and not simply related to plasma levels. Keleman et al (Clinical Immunology 2010; 134; 354-358) 
have recently demonstrated that baseline levels of functional C1 INH correlate with disease severity 
scores in HAE.  However, there is a high variability of C1 INH functional levels within all severity 
groups – mean C1 INH functional levels as low as 47% of normal were associated with no symptoms 
and mean levels of 39% with only minimal symptoms. This supports the position that disease 
management does not require an increase of C1 INH functional levels into normal range (>68%). 
Therefore it was concluded that there is no convincing data that C1 INH levels need to be increased to 
“normal range” in order to effectively prevent or treat acute HAE attacks. The CHMP agreed with this 
position and accepted a fixed dose instead of a dose adjusted to body weight.  
The lack of adequate PK data in children for the age group of 12 years and younger does not allow for 
dose recommendations in this population. The CHMP therefore requested the restriction of the 
indication to the use in adults and adolescents. It was noted that the Applicant is conducting a 
paediatric trial (Study No. 0624-203) to evaluate the dose response and PK/PD of Cinryze for the 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 27/64
 
 
 
 
treatment of acute HAE attacks and determine the safety and tolerability following IV administration of 
Cinryze in children less than 12 years of age. Results from this study are requested to be reported. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK and PD data demonstrated that Cinryze has the expected effect of raising levels C1 INHC1 INH 
and C4. It is noted that in the study many subjects did not achieve a level of C1 INH (antigenic or 
functional) above the lower limit of normal. The consideration whether full physiologic levels are 
actually necessary to stop a HAE attack was discussed. In a subset of patients for whom PK data and 
weight were available, no correlation was found between the administered dose per kg bodyweight and 
the achieved changes to baseline or the maximal levels of C1 INH antigen, functional C1 INH or C4. It 
is therefore concluded that it is acceptable to use a fixed dose as proposed by the Applicant. The 
available PK data is however supportive for granting Marketing Authorisation only in age groups of 
adults and adolescents. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
No formal dose response studies have been performed, which was justified by the Applicant based on 
available clinical experience with other C1 INH products. Please refer to discussions on clinical 
pharmacology and clinical efficacy for more information about the choice of dosage. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study LEVP 2005-1/Part A  
Methods 
Study LEVP 2005-1/Part A was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre 
study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cinryze for the treatment of acute HAE attacks. 
Study Participants 
Subjects could be eligible, if they had a confirmed diagnosis of HAE with evidence of a low C4 level and 
either a low C1 INHC1 INH antigenic level, low C1 INHC1 INH functional level, or a known HAE causing 
C1 INHC1 INH mutation and age ≥ 6 years. The exclusion criteria included: low C1q level; history of a 
B-cell malignancy; presence of an anti-C1 INHC1 INH antibody; history of allergic reaction to C1 INHC1 
INH or other blood/plasma products; pregnancy: narcotic addiction, narcotic pain medication within 7 
days prior to the attack. Within four hours of experiencing an “defining symptom” – acute moderate or 
severe HAE attack of the abdomen (with abdominal pain), face (without airway involvement), or 
external genitalia (with swelling of scrotum or vulva) the subject was to be further evaluated for 
eligibility to be randomized. 
Treatments 
Subjects were treated for a single HAE attack by intravenous infusion over 10 minutes with blinded 
study agent, either 1000 U Cinryze (n=36) or placebo (n=35). A second dose of the same treatment 
(i.e. either 1000 U Cinryze or placebo) was to be provided at 60 minutes if the initial treatment had no 
effect. Rescue treatment with open label Cinryze could be given 4 hours after initial treatment if 
subjects still had not reported onset of significant relief. 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 28/64
 
 
 
Subjects were not to have received narcotic pain medication within 7 days prior to the attack. 
Objectives 
To evaluate safety and efficacy of Cinryze for the treatment of acute HAE attacks. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
After infusion with study drug, subjects evaluated the severity of their “defining symptom” every 15 
minutes for 4 hours or until substantial relief of symptoms occurred by using the following scale: 
“Absent now and before”, “Absent now but present before”, “Present, symptoms new”, “Present, 
symptoms worse or the same” and “Present, symptoms better”. These assessments were used to 
identify the time to the beginning of unequivocal relief (primary efficacy endpoint), defined as the first 
of 3 consecutive reports of either “present, symptoms better” or “absent now but present before” or 
“absent now and before” verifying substantial relief. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
 
 
 
percentage of subjects with beginning of unequivocal relief of the defining symptom within 4 
hours following initial randomized treatment; 
time to complete resolution of the attack (recorded at the 3-day telephone follow-up); 
effects of treatment on C1 INH and complement C4 levels (see PK part of AR). 
Additional analyses were performed on: 
 
 
 
rating of symptom pain intensity using a visual analog scale (VAS); 
hospitalization following treatment with Cinryze for laryngeal attacks; 
use of rescue treatment (i.e., Cinryze and narcotics). 
Sample size 
Based on an estimate of 0.83 hours for the primary efficacy endpoint, 34 subjects per treatment group 
were required to give a total of 65 observed events (providing 80% power at the 5% level of 
significance (2-sided test) to detect a 50% reduction in primary efficacy endpoint). 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either Cinryze or placebo. Randomisation was 
stratified by study centre. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was blinded to the investigators and the subjects. At each centre there was an unblinded 
study pharmacist. 
Statistical methods 
Time-to-event data were compared between treatment groups by means of a Proportional Hazards 
Regression (PHR) model including factors ‘treatment’ and ‘centre’. Treatment effects were described by 
means of the hazard ratio, including the corresponding 95%-confidence interval. Median time to event 
and its 95% confidence interval were calculated by means of the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The Kaplan-
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 29/64
 
 
 
Meier estimates were displayed graphically. Continuous or ordinal variables were compared between 
treatments either using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) including treatment and centre or a Wilcoxon-
rank sum test. The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) test, stratified by centre was used to compare 
treatment groups for categorical variables. 
In addition to the ITT dataset an Efficacy dataset was defined excluding three patients who were 
retrospectively assessed as not having had a “true” HAE attack. Primary endpoint was analysed in both 
ITT and Efficacy datasets, while most secondary analyses were not performed on the ITT dataset but 
on the ‘Efficacy dataset’. 
For primary efficacy endpoint analysis, subjects who withdrew from the study or received rescue 
treatment were censored at the time of withdrawal/rescue treatment, and subjects who did not 
achieve unequivocal relief within 4 hours were censored at 4 hours.

Conduct of the study 
There were 3 amendments to the initial protocol, including change of randomized subjects from 62 to 
70, and change of time-point for rescue with open-label Cinryze and symptom assessment from 8 to 4 
hours. 
Baseline data 
With respect to age, gender and height, both treatment groups were balanced. With respect to weight 
subjects randomized to Cinryze were slightly heavier than those randomised to placebo (median 
weights: Cinryze – 78.5 kg, Placebo – 69.6 kg). 
Table 9.  Demographic characteristics (ITT Dataset Study LEVP 2005-1/Part A) 
With respect to symptom severity at baseline, ‘severe’ HAE attacks were more often reported for 
patients randomized to placebo.

Outcomes and estimation 
For the primary efficacy endpoint ‘Time to start of unequivocal relief’, in approximately 33% of 
subjects in the Cinryze treatment group relief started by 1 hour, and over 50% of the subjects had 
relief by 2 hours. Approximately 60% of subjects had relief as measured at 3 hours and 4 hours. In the 
placebo treatment group, the percentage of subjects with relief was lower at each time point (1 hour, 2 
hour, 3 hour and 4 hour, approximately 15%, 33%, 37% and 44%, respectively).  
The result is statistically borderline for the ITT dataset (p=0.048) while more pronounced for the 
Efficacy dataset (p=0.017).

Ancillary analyses 
While the difference in subject visual analogue scale (VAS) ratings was not statistically significant 
(p=0.085), the mean values showed improvement in the Cinryze treatment group and deterioration in 
the placebo treatment group, which suggests a possible pain improvement in the Cinryze treatment 
group as compared to placebo treatment group.

Fifteen subjects had a total of 18 laryngeal attacks and were treated with open-label Cinryze. Of these 
subjects, none required hospitalization or intubation. 
About 40 % of subjects needed rescue treatment despite having received the full dose of 1000 U plus 
additional 1000 U of Cinryze.

Study LEVP 2005-1/Part B  
Methods 
Study LEVP 2005-1/Part B was a Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicentre, 
crossover study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Cinryze for the prevention of HAE attacks. 
Study Participants 
All subjects enrolled in Part B had been enrolled in Part A or met the inclusion criteria of Part A. The 
subjects selected for enrollment in Part B were those with relatively frequent angioedema attacks (at 
least 2/month on average), age ≥ 6 years, normal C1q level, documented HAE (low C4 level and one 
of the following criteria: low C1NH antigenic level or, normal C1 INH antigenic level and a low C1 
INHC1 INH functional level or, a known HAE-causing C1 INHC1 INH mutation). Before inclusion in part 
B, the subjects were again assessed for the inclusion and exclusion criteria of Part A. 
Treatments 
Subjects could be randomized to a sequence Cinryze/Placebo (Cinryze 1000 U intravenously every 3 to 
4 days for 12 weeks, followed by placebo intravenously every 3 to 4 days for 12 weeks) or 
Placebo/Cinryze (the opposite sequence). Prior to surgical interventions 1000 Units of Cinryze were 
administered. Acute laryngeal attacks were treated with open-label Cinryze (1000 Units initially and 
after 60 minutes, if necessary, another 1000 Units), which could be also administered in other attacks 
at Investigator’s discretion. 
Dose of 17-alpha-alkylated androgens or epsilon-aminocaproic acid had to be stable during Part B, but 
could be decreased before entry in Part B of the study, in which case the entry was postponed for a 
month. 
Objectives 
To evaluate safety and efficacy of Cinryze for the prevention of HAE attacks. 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 37/64
 
 
 
 
 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Subjects were given diary cards and instructed to evaluate symptoms over the prior 24 hours. 
Primary efficacy endpoint was number of HAE attacks during each therapy period (Cinryze vs. placebo) 
. Number of attacks was determined based on entries in diary cards by subjects and additionally by at 
least weakly evaluation by study personnel. 
Secondary efficacy endpoints included: 
  Average severity of attacks during each therapy period 
  Average duration of attacks during each therapy period 
  Number of open-label Cinryze infusions during each therapy period 
  Number of days of swelling 
Sample size 
Based on the assumption of an angioedema attack rate of 1 every 2 weeks during placebo treatment 
vs 1 every 12 weeks in the prophylactic Cinryze phase, it was calculated that 10 subjects per sequence 
would provide more than 90% power to detect the treatment effect (Type I error: 0.05, 2-sided). 
Therefore, a total of 20 subjects was planned to be included. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomized in a 1:1 allocation ratio to one of the two treatment sequences ‘C1 
INHC1 INH/placebo’ and ‘placebo/C1 INHC1 INH’. 
Blinding (masking) 
Study was double-blinded for the sequence of treatments. 
Statistical methods 
A generalized linear model was planned to compare the number of attacks of angioedema during each 
treatment period, normalized for the number of days the subject participated in that period. 
Anticipating Poisson distributed data the GEE method as implemented in the SAS statistical procedure 
PROC GENMOD was used.  
Secondary parameters were compared by means of Fisher’s exact test (number of subjects dropping 
out at each treatment period) or a Wilcoson Signed Rank test in case of continuous or ordinal variables 
(e.g. average severity of attacks, average duration of attacks). 
The Efficacy Dataset consisted of all subjects randomized into one of two therapy sequences, who 
completed dosing in Period 1 and received at least one dose of study drug in the crossover phase, 
Period 2.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Upon request from CHMP, the Applicant provided data on pre-procedure administration of open-label 
Cinryze from studies LEVP 2005-1/A and LEVP 2006-1. Cinryze was administered prior to a total of 91 
procedures across the clinical program (40 procedures in children and 51 procedures in adults). The 
majority of procedures (~55%) were associated with dental work and ~37% were associated with a 
wide variety of surgeries or interventional diagnostic procedures. Pre-procedure administration of 
Cinryze led to 98% rate of no HAE attacks within 72 hours after the dose. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No dedicated studies were performed in special populations. 
A total of 46 unique subjects below the age of 18 years (2-5 years: n=3; 6-11 years: n=17; 12-17 
years: n=26) were included in the clinical study program, mainly in the open-label studies. In Study 
LEVP2006-1 the proportion of HAE attacks achieving unequivocal relief of the defining symptom within 
4 hours after Cinryze treatment was comparable between the 22 children in the ITT-E Dataset (age 
range 2-17 years) and adults, with 89% and 86% of attacks achieving relief, respectively. In Study 
LEVP2006-4, the 23 children in the ITT-E Dataset (age range 3-17 years) reported a median monthly 
HAE attack rate of 3.0 (range 0.5-28.0) prior to enrolment, which was reduced to <0.7 (range 0-3.4) 
while on Cinryze prophylaxis. 87% of children reported an average of ≤1 attack per month, 
comparable to the benefit observed in adults in this study.

Supportive studies 
Study LEVP 2006-1 
Study LEVP 2006-1 was an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study to evaluate the safety and 
efficacy of repeat use of Cinryze for the treatment of HAE attacks. Subjects were treated with open-
label Cinryze for multiple HAE attacks (including all laryngeal attacks and gastrointestinal, facial, 
genitourinary, or extremity attacks) for the duration of the study. Dosing regimen was Cinryze 1000 U, 
which could be repeated after 60 minutes if there was no symptom relief. If a surgical or dental 
procedure was required short-term prophylaxis against HAE attacks could be performed at a dose of 
1000 U within 24 hours of the surgical or dental procedure.  
Of 609 attacks in 101 subjects, 68 % achieved unequivocal beginning of relief of the defining symptom 
(defined as 3 consecutive reports of improvement) within 1 hour after start of the first dose of Cinryze 
with a median time to beginning of relief of 0.75 hours. Within 4 hours, 87 % of patients achieved 
beginning of relief. Among 84 laryngeal attacks treated during this study, none required intubation 
following treatment with Cinryze.  
Table 19.  Proportion of attacks achieving unequivocal relief of the defining symptom within 1and 4 
hours after start of the 1st dose of Cinryze (ITT dataset LEVP 2006-1) 
Using a less conservative definition of clinical relief of the defining symptom (either three consecutive 
assessments of improvement of the defining symptom or improvement of the defining symptom 
followed by cessation of symptom assessments), the proportion of HAE attacks with relief of the 
defining symptom within 4 hours was 95%. 
Fifteen subjects were treated for at least 10 HAE attacks during the study with a maximum of 57 
attacks. The median time to beginning of unequivocal relief was comparable among subjects who had 
up to 30 attacks during the study, ranging from 0.25 to 0.75 hours. Data demonstrate that the efficacy 
of Cinryze did not diminish with subsequent repeat administration. 
A subgroup analysis of data from Study LEVP 2006-1 was performed upon request from the CHMP for 
subjects who received Cinryze treatment ≤4 hours (78 subjects with 366 attacks) or >4 hours 
(70 subjects with 237 attacks) after the onset of an attack.  
  Subjects who received Cinryze treatment ≤4 hours after the onset of an HAE attack had a higher 
proportion of attacks achieving unequivocal relief of the defining symptom within 1 hour after start 
of the first dose of Cinryze compared to subjects who received treatment >4 hours after the onset 
of an attack (77% vs. 56%, respectively).

 
The proportion of attacks achieving unequivocal relief within 4 hours was comparable regardless of 
the timing of treatment initiation (89% vs. 86%). 
Study LEVP 2006-4  
Study LEVP 2006-4 was an open-label, single-arm, multicentre study to evaluate safety and efficacy of 
repeat use of Cinryze for the prevention of HAE attacks. Subjects had to have a history of at least 1 
HAE attack per month or a history of laryngeal oedema to be enrolled in the Study. Subjects could 
receive Cinryze in a dose of 1000 U every 3 to 7 days continuously for the entire duration of the study. 
Acute attacks could be treated with open-label Cinryze. 
A median number of 3.0 attacks per month (range 0.08 – 28.0) was reported at screening. During 
prophylactic therapy with Cinryze, the median monthly attack rate per subject was reduced to 0.21 
(range 0 – 4.56). Variability in the frequency of attacks over time is seen in HAE.   
Overall, 12,019 Cinryze infusions were administered to a total of 146 study participants. In 46 subjects 
exposed to Cinryze for at least 1 year, the median monthly attack rate remained relatively constant.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In general design and conduct of main clinical studies fulfil the minimum requirements.  
Existing potential comparator products either have well-established safety and tolerability issues, are 
unsuitable for significant proportions of the patient population (women and children), and/or are not 
approved widely across all EU member states at the time of conduct of pivotal trials. Therefore it is 
acceptable that in both pivotal trials placebo was used as a control. 
The use of cross over design in the prophylaxis trial is deemed acceptable and the length of each 
treatment period suitable. Even though there is no wash-out period between the two therapies, this is 
not considered to be of major importance since subjects received open-label Cinryze for treatment of 
attacks and therefore potential bias is more likely to be in favour of placebo. 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 47/64
 
 
 
 
 
The use of open label Cinryze treatment and other rescue treatments in trials is acceptable for the 
concerned condition. 
The endpoints chosen in both pivotal trials are considered satisfactory for HAE. 
The decision to exclude from Efficacy dataset in study LEVP 2005-1/A patients based on whether they 
have low levels of C4 and is this not a ‘true’ episode is not supported, however, for the primary efficacy 
endpoint analysis the ITT dataset is provided. 
Patients included in pivotal trials are deemed to in general represent the patients likely to receive the 
product within the agreed indication. 
It was noted that the statistical model in study LEVP 2005-1/A for the submitted primary efficacy 
analysis deviated from the initial analysis model. While it is acknowledged that the recent analysis 
model is appropriate, it has to be kept in mind that this model was only used following unblinding of 
the data. 
Overall, there are some limitations in the clinical study programme regarding representation of some 
age groups (particularly children) and the demonstration of the optimal doses, which will be addressed 
by the applicant in future studies. A PK/PD, safety and efficacy study in children less than 12 years of 
age is ongoing (Study No. 0624-203). Regarding optimal dosing in long-term prophylaxis further 
information is expected from an ongoing study with escalating doses in patients who are insufficiently 
protected by the currently recommended dosing (VP0624-400). 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The single pivotal study LEVP 2005-1/A supporting the indication for the treatment of acute HAE 
attacks showed result which are statistically borderline for the ITT dataset (p=0.048) while more 
pronounced for the Efficacy dataset (p=0.017). In this study a fixed dose regimen of 1000 U 
(irrespective of body weight) was applied. Based on these statistically weak results together with the 
need for a second dose at 60 minutes and for further rescue Cinryze treatment at 4 hours in 67% and 
42% of subjects, respectively, the CHMP questioned the appropriateness of the proposed dosing 
regimen, particularly for patients with severe attacks. 
Evaluation of additional PK data showed no correlation between PK parameters and applied dose 
normalized to body weight. No correlation between dose/kg and time to unequivocal relief of HAE 
attack was found in data from study LEVP 2005-1/Part A thus suggesting, that the amount of C1 INH 
administered does not directly influence the start of resolution from an attack. It has to be noted that 
for relief times more than one hour, the data represent mixed subjects having received a single or two 
separate doses and are therefore difficult to interpret. However, the lack of correlation supports the 
strategy of a simple, fixed dose regimen independent from body weight.  
Therefore, taking into account also that clinical efficacy is shown for proposed dosage, a fixed dose 
regimen was considered acceptable by the CHMP. This is further substantiated by evidence that 
reaching certain concentration of C1 INH is not always necessary in order to prevent or treat HAE 
attacks. 
In the open label study LEVP 2006-1 a higher efficacy was seen as compared to the pivotal study, 
however this can in part be explained by the inclusion of all kind of attacks of all locations and 
severities including milder attacks and the lack of censoring patients who received opiates. At the same 
time, this open label study results show that the proportion of attacks achieving unequivocal relief 
within 1 hour is lower for those with facial and laryngeal attacks, the latter being potentially life 
threatening. However, this effect had also been noted for other C1 INH products and may be caused by 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 48/64
 
 
 
the nature of the attack.  Subgroup analysis of data from study LEVP 2006-1 also revealed that 
proportion of subjects who achieved unequivocal relief after 1 hour was lower, but after 4 hours similar 
in subjects who received Cinryze treatment > 4 hours after the onset of an HAE attack as compared to 
other subjects.  This observation has been addressed in the SmPC with the recommendation to 
consider an earlier administration of a second 1000 U dose for patients experiencing severe attacks, 
particularly laryngeal attacks or if initiation of treatment is delayed. It is noted that recommending a 
higher single dose than 1000 U in such situations would not be substantiated by clinical efficacy data, 
but administering the second 1000 U dose earlier than 60 minutes apart from the first dose is 
reasonable, if required so by the clinical situation. 
Regarding the prevention of HAE attacks, the results from the single pivotal study LEVP 2005-1/B 
supporting this claim demonstrated that during 12 weeks of prophylactic therapy with Cinryze the 
number, severity and duration of HAE attacks, the number of open label C1 INH infusions and the days 
of swelling were statistically significantly decreased in comparison to treatment with placebo. 
The CHMP expressed its view that a more pronounced reduction of HAE attacks might have been 
achieved with a more optimized dosing regimen. In general, despite the results being statistically 
significant, from a clinical perspective the achieved halving of HAE attack frequency is not considered 
an optimal outcome. However, it should also be noted that this reduction of attack frequency was 
reached on top of the standard anti-angioedema therapy, which was continued concomitantly. 
Consequently, the CHMP requested the indication for long-term prophylaxis to be restricted to the 
most severely affected patients who have been unresponsive or intolerant to other prophylactic 
medication. Prophylaxis ideally should be of a limited duration with regular review by the prescribing 
doctor, therefore the proposed dose for routine prevention of 1000 Units of Cinryze every 3 or 4 days 
is approved as the recommended starting dose for routine prevention and the dosing interval may 
need to be adjusted according to individual response.  
Short-term prophylaxis with C1 INH prior to a planned procedure is a more commonly used type of 
prophylaxis in HAE.  Pre-procedural use of Cinryze has been applied in a total of 91 procedures across 
the clinical program. Cinryze was effective in preventing HAE attacks following 98% of medical, 
surgical, or dental procedures. Therefore the efficacy in short-term prophylaxis has been 
demonstrated.  
Data from children below 12 years of age is scarce and is not sufficient to demonstrate appropriate 
efficacy. Therefore, the CHMP did not agree to the proposed use in the entire paediatric population.  
Considering that hormonal changes occurring during adolescence are triggers for HAE attacks and at 
this time patients can experience an increase in the intensity and severity of the disease, the CHMP 
agreed that a strict cut-off below the age of 12 years may not be appropriate when adolescence can 
start before 12 years of age hence accepting the use “in adults and adolescents”. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
 Available efficacy data for the indication of treatment of HAE attacks from the pivotal trial is of 
borderline significance. Taking into account also the additional support by further analyses there is 
however sufficient evidence of efficacy. It is noted that the overall dose finding is not optimal, however 
the CHMP considers based on the totality of the data that a fixed dose independent from body weight is 
acceptable, since efficacy is shown and there is no evidence that other dosing would be more efficient. 
For long-term prophylaxis efficacy has been demonstrated to be statistically significant in all endpoints. 
In view of the limitation of the data, the indication was restricted to the most severely affected 
patients, who are intolerant to or insufficiently protected by other, less invasive prophylactic 
treatments, or patients who are unsuitable for on-demand therapy. Additional data from an ongoing 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 49/64
 
 
 
dose-escalating study in long-term prevention will become available and are requested to be provided 
post-licensure to further explore the optimal dose regimen. 
Based on analysis of provided data, pre-procedure administration of Cinryze was effective in 
preventing HAE attacks. 
Clinical data is currently only sufficient to support the use in adults and adolescents, but not a wider 
paediatric population. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety of Cinryze was monitored and assessed in all clinical trials of the development program. Open-
label studies LEVP 2006-5 (PK), LEVP 2006-1 (treatment), and LEVP 2006-4 (prevention) were 
uncontrolled. Studies LEVP 2005-1/A (treatment) and LEVP 2005-1/B (prevention) were placebo-
controlled. However, in Study LEVP 2005-1/B all subjects received open-label Cinryze at some point in 
time; therefore all AEs were attributed to Cinryze treatment.

In total, approximately 14,500 doses of Cinryze have been administered to 262 unique subjects. 
Adverse events  
Most frequently reported AEs were infections/infestations, mostly considered to be unrelated to 
Cinryze. 
Gastrointestinal disorders were the second most commonly reported types of TEAEs overall, in 90% of 
events considered to be unrelated to Cinryze. The only TEAEs in this SOC considered possibly, 
probably, or definitely related to Cinryze were uncommon events of nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, or 
abdominal pain.  
Within skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders a total of 26 subjects reported rash at one or more 
times during the studies. However, determination of attribution to Cinryze is complicated since rash 
can be part of a prodrome or can occur during an HAE attack. In fact, 5 subjects had rash considered 
possibly, probably, or definitely related to Cinryze. None of these rashes were serious, and no rash led 
to discontinuation of study drug. Rash is the only Adverse Reaction occurring with common frequency; 
all other Adverse Reactions are uncommon. A review of all TEAEs describing pain, bruising, or rash at 
the injection/catheter site, or venous burning/phlebitis, etc., revealed an uncommon occurrence of

Adverse events of special interest  
Thrombosis 
From clinical development five SAEs of thrombotic events have been reported, none of which was 
deemed causally related to study drug administration. Three further, non-serious, thromboembolic 
TEAEs occurred with one of them, a moderate thrombosis at port site, assessed as possibly related to 
the use of Cinryze. Further data on thromboembolic events derive from post-marketing exposure in the 
US. A total of 419 patients were treated for prevention of HAE attacks up to January 2010. During this 
reporting period, eight cases of thromboembolic events have been reported, thereof five as catheter-
related venous thromboses. The Applicant assumes that approximately 25% of these patients had an

indwelling peripheral or central venous catheter. An estimated incidence for thrombotic events is 5/100 
patients (5%). 
Risk of transmission of infectious diseases 
Data provide no evidence for viral transmission associated with Cinryze administration. 
Potential risk of Adverse Events with self- or home-administration 
The Applicant proposes that Cinryze could be used for self- or home-administration by selected 
patients. Appropriate selection and training of patients or caregivers by trained healthcare 
professionals should minimize the potential risk associated with this kind of use. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Three deaths have been reported from open-labelled studies, none of which were considered by the 
investigator to be related to study drug. Further 40 subjects treated with Cinryze reported a SAE. Two 
of these SAEs (exacerbation of major chronic depression and musculoskeletal chest pain) were 
considered to have an unknown relationship to study drug. All other SAEs were considered unrelated to 
study drug. 
Laboratory findings 
There were no adverse trends in clinical laboratory results or vital signs following Cinryze infusions in 
the clinical studies. 
Safety in special populations 
Among the children adverse reactions with suspected relationship to treatment with Cinryze included 
headache, nausea, pyrexia, and infusion site erythema. None of these adverse reactions were severe, 
and none led to discontinuation of study drug. Overall, the safety and tolerability of Cinryze were 
similar in children and adults. However, the age group of 2-5 years old children represented by only 3 
subjects is too small to establish safety in this paediatric subset.  
Immunological events 
Based on provided data from clinical studies, there is no evidence of clinically relevant anti-C1 INH 
antibody development. Nevertheless, Cinryze is a protein of human plasmatic origin and as such has 
an inherent immunogenic risk. Moreover, it is intended for repeated use or even a long-term 
prevention therapy. With increasing duration of the treatment the risk to develop neutralising anti-C1 
INH antibodies may increase. Further data are expected from the ongoing Phase 4 study in the US.  
Hypersensitivity reactions occurred in clinical studies with Cinryze: rash occurred commonly; contact 
dermatitis, erythema, and pruritus occurred uncommonly. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Due to the human plasmatic origin, studies on metabolism or drug-drug interactions were not deemed 
necessary.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
No subjects were discontinued from study drug due to an AE in any of the clinical studies. 
Post marketing experience 
As of 27-Jan-2010, there were 300 post-marketing AE reports for Cinryze. The vast majority of reports 
(76%) described patients’ underlying HAE (e.g., breakthrough HAE attacks with or without known 
trigger, or associated with non-labelled dosing regimens). Among the remaining reports not pertaining 
to HAE, the most common (>2 events) included headache, localized infusion site reaction (of any 
type), dizziness, fatigue, thrombotic events (of any type), nausea, peripheral oedema, abdominal pain, 
arthralgia, chest pain, vomiting, asthenia, back pain, blood glucose increased, liver function test 
abnormal, oropharyngeal pain, pain, pain in extremity, rash, and urticaria. 
The updated post-marketing safety has provided reports which mainly relate to breakthrough attacks. 
The other main problems reported relate to thrombosis (DVT, catheter thrombosis, embolic stroke, 
jugular vein thrombosis and TIA).  According to the Applicant the incidence of thrombotic events is 5 
cases out of estimated 100 patients with indwelling cannulas in total. Additional reports such as central 
line infection highlight the problems associated with long-term intravenous catheters. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Initially safety data was not presented as a function of length of time on treatment, which was 
corrected upon request from the CHMP. The main concern derives from post-marketing reports from 
the US, where thromboses and infection of intravenous catheters used in long-term prophylaxis have 
been reported. 
A potential safety concern arises from the post-marketing data: risk of thrombosis within indwelling 
catheters in situ for long-term prophylaxis. It was observed at the incidence of 5 out of 100, which 
corresponds to the normal thrombotic risk of indwelling cannulae and therefore the risk is not likely to 
be increased by the administration of Cinryze. 
Safety data about self-administration is scarce and only available from post-marketing reports in the 
US, where Cinryze is approved for long-term prevention therapy. However self-administration is likely 
to be used in actual clinical practice, therefore appropriate selection and training of patients or 
caregivers by trained healthcare professionals should be performed in order to minimize the potential 
risk associated with this kind of use. The most likely risks are related to the administration process 
itself (e.g. aseptic technique, venous access, needle disposal) as well as the handling of adverse drug 
reactions, particularly hypersensitivity. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have 
been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
C1 INH when given as replacement therapy is not expected to have an adverse safety profile other 
than the known potential problems associated with any blood-derived product and possible AEs specific 
to any C1 INH, namely immunogenicity and thrombogenicity. 
Off-label use of C1 INH at high doses had been associated with thrombosis, but this has not been 
observed in the presented clinical programme.  
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 55/64
 
 
 
Risk of thrombosis within indwelling catheters in situ for long-term prophylaxis corresponds to the 
normal risk of indwelling cannulae. The Applicant will monitor thrombotic/thromboembolic events in 
clinical studies and post-marketing and report them regularly. In any case, the decision to start long-
term prophylaxis has to be balanced very carefully in each individual case and should be restricted to 
severely affected patients who are intolerant to or insufficiently protected by oral prevention 
treatments or patients who are inadequately managed with repeated acute treatment. 
An educational programme should be put in place for minimisation of risks associated with self-
administration, which is likely to take place in actual clinical practice especially for long-term 
prophylaxis.

2.8.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
  Beneficial effects 
Treatment with Cinryze resulted in increases in antigenic and functional C1 INH levels. The elimination 
was slow with a half-life of 56 hours, but no accumulation was observed with repetitive dosing in 
intervals of 3 to 4 days. Reproducible increases in functional C1 INH activity indicated consistent 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 59/64
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
pharmacokinetics over repeated Cinryze administrations. Biological activity of Cinryze was 
demonstrated by an increase of C4 levels in 12 hours after infusion of Cinryze which was statistically 
significant compared to treatment with placebo. These PK and PD data show that Cinryze is a 
functional C1 INH product. 
Indication: treatment of angioedema attacks 
In the submitted double-blind study the median time to beginning of unequivocal relief of defining 
symptom was shorter for subjects treated with Cinryze as compared to placebo (2 vs. >4 hours, 
p=0.048 in ITT dataset, p=0.017 in Efficacy dataset). Cinryze group had higher percentage of subjects 
with beginning of relief within 4 hours (60% vs. 42.4 % for placebo, difference not statistically 
significant) and shorter time to complete resolution of the attack (12 hours vs. ≥ 25 hours for placebo, 
difference statistically significant). These results are weaker than expected for a C1 INH product (e.g. 
expected median time to start of unequivocal relief of defining symptoms 0.83 hours), which may have 
been influenced by selection of study participants, characteristics of attacks included in the study, 
definition of primary endpoint and the use of a fixed dose without relation to body weight although an 
effect of body-weight adjusted dose on time to relief was not detected. 
In the submitted open-label study a greater variety of subjects was enrolled presenting with HAE 
attacks of all locations and severities including laryngeal and extremities attacks, which had been 
excluded from the preceding double-blind trial. Of 609 attacks in 101 subjects, 68 % achieved 
unequivocal beginning of relief of the defining symptom within 1 hour and 87 % within 4 hours. The 
observed median time to beginning of relief of 0.75 hours is in line with the time to relief expected 
from literature data. Following treatment with Cinryze none of the 84 laryngeal attacks required 
intubation. Data in subjects with repeated attacks (up to 57 attacks) demonstrate that the efficacy of 
Cinryze does not diminish with repeated administration. 
Indication: routine prevention of angioedema attacks 
The results of a placebo-controlled cross-over study showed statistically significant reduction by 50% 
in the number of HAE attacks and reduced severity and duration of attacks as effects of a prophylactic 
therapy with Cinryze. Another, open-label study had a larger database (12,019 Cinryze infusions, 146 
subjects in total, 46 subjects exposed to Cinryze for more than a year) and showed reduction of 
median monthly HAE attack rate from 3.0 to 0.21 attacks per month, which led to 86% of subjects on 
long-term prevention experiencing ≤1 HAE attack per month on average. The protective effect did not 
diminish over time. 
Indication: pre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks 
Data from a total of 91 procedures show that pre-procedure administration of Cinryze was effective in 
preventing HAE attacks for 72 hours following 98% of medical, surgical, or dental procedures. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Based on the available data it is not known, whether a higher initial dose would have improved the 
efficacy in treating HAE attacks. In the pivotal trial in acute treatment 66% of patients received a 
second 1000 U dose due to insufficient response. The administration of a sufficient initial dose is 
essential for the treatment of attacks, especially when the attack is severe. The subjects who required 
a second 1000 U dose more often had a severe, especially a laryngeal attack or had a lag time of more 
than 4 hours between onset of attack and Cinryze administration. It was therefore agreed to amend 
the dose recommendation for patients experiencing severe attacks, particularly laryngeal attacks, or if 
initiation of treatment is delayed, that consideration should be given to an earlier administration of a 
second 1000 U dose for these cases. A post-marketing registry will specifically monitor cases of 
laryngeal attacks and initiation of treatment more than 4 hours after the onset of the attack. 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 60/64
 
 
 
It is also unknown, whether a permanently higher C1 INH levels resulting from an intensified 
replacement therapy with exogenous C1 INH could outweigh the influence of the attack triggering 
factors in HAE patients. The impact of such higher doses of exogenous C1 INH on the complement and 
contact activation system cannot be anticipated. Breakthrough attacks occurred despite routine 
prevention therapy, making on-demand treatment necessary, which indicated a risk of insufficient 
efficacy of long-term prophylaxis. The dose regimen for the long-term prophylaxis was discussed. 
While the SmPC proposes 1000 U every 3 to 4 days, a schedule of 1000 U every 3 to 7 days was in 
general used in the long-term study. It was agreed that the dosing interval may need to be adjusted 
according to the individual response. The Applicant will report results from Study VP 0624-400, a dose 
escalating study in the prophylactic therapy with Cinryze, as soon as available. 
There is insufficient data on pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy in children below the age of 12 years 
hence the CHMP did restrict the indication to the use in adults and adolescents. 
Risks 
  Unfavourable effects 
Adverse events reported from clinical studies were mostly considered to be unrelated to treatment with 
Cinryze. A commonly reported adverse reaction was rash. All other adverse reactions were reported 
with uncommon frequency: hyperglycemia, dizziness, headache, venous thrombosis, phlebitis, venous 
burning, hot flush, cough, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, abdominal pain, contact dermatitis, erythema, 
pruritus, joint swelling, arthralgia, myalgia, injection site rash/erythema, infusion site pain, chest 
discomfort, and pyrexia. 
Localized reactions to Cinryze occurred uncommonly with a frequency of 0.2 % of administrations. 
Based on provided data from clinical studies, there is no evidence of clinically relevant anti-C1 INH 
antibody development.  
For the long-term prophylaxis indication, additional risks relate to frequent venous access and the use 
of intravenous catheters with the risks of thrombosis and infection. A venous thrombosis of the port 
was reported and assessed as possibly related to administration of Cinryze. Post-marketing data from 
prophylactic therapy in 419 patients have eight cases of thromboembolic events reported, thereof five 
as catheter-related venous thromboses. This corresponds to the normal thrombotic risk of indwelling 
cannulas and is not increased by the administration of Cinryze. The potential risk of thrombosis in 
patients with thrombogenic risk factors has been addressed in the Risk Management Plan. The 
Applicant is currently performing a Phase 4 study, where thrombogenic and immunogenic risk are 
further investigated. 
  Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects. 
In clinical studies with other C1 INH products time to relief had to be awaited without the option of an 
additional dose after one hour. Due to the double-blind design with the comparator treatment placebo 
and possibility to administer second dose, there is a risk that investigators may have tended not to 
await the relief of the attack but rather administer a second dose. It is uncertain whether the patients 
who received a second 1000 U dose in the treatment of acute attacks really needed this dose, or 
whether the attack would have resolved without this additional dosing. 
Cinryze 
Asessment report

Benefit-Risk Balance 
 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Hereditary angioedema is a serious, debilitating, and potentially fatal disease caused by a rare 
autosomal dominant mutation on chromosome 11 that leads to a decrease in C1 INH activity. Attacks 
range in severity from mild to severe, with GI involvement causing nausea, vomiting, and diarrhoea, or 
may even mimic an acute surgical emergency. Laryngeal swelling can be life threatening and these 
attacks account for the mortality risk described for HAE. Hence, HAE attacks require prompt treatment, 
often in an emergency room. Optimal management of C1 INH deficiency should include treatment of 
acute attacks, short-term prophylaxis and long-term prophylaxis in order to minimise the frequency 
and severity of recurrent attacks. 
The benefits from the therapy with Cinryze have been demonstrated in treatment and prevention of 
HAE attacks and assure that Cinryze in general is effective in the agreed indications. 
The identified unfavourable effects and risks are in general in line with those of other C1 INH products 
and therefore do not raise any major concerns in the agreed indications.  
The lack of data in paediatric population below 12 years of age remains an important source of concern 
for safe and efficient use of Cinryze in this patient population, therefore it has to be addressed before 
extending the indication to children below 12 years of age. 
From the available data it is not known, whether a higher initial dose would have improved the efficacy 
in treating HAE attacks and whether a permanently higher C1 INH levels resulting from an intensified 
replacement therapy could prevent more HAE attacks. Further research for determination of the 
optimal dose is recommended, but it has to be noted that the efficacy is shown also at the proposed 
doses. 
  Benefit-risk balance 
The overall benefit risk balance of Cinryze is considered positive in the agreed indications in adults and 
adolescents. 
2.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Initially, the applicant proposed the therapeutic indication “Treatment and prevention of angioedema 
attacks in adults, adolescents and children with C1 inhibitor deficiency” for Cinryze. The proposed dose 
regimen was a fixed dose of 1000 U. 
The overall quality of the drug product has been demonstrated. Although the product is controlled by 
adequate test methods and specifications, the applicant should tighten some finished products 
specifications and should include additional specifications for purity and for the recently identified 
impurities and should calibrate in-house reference material against the WHO international standard in 
order to ensure the continuous consistency of the potency and purity of the product. 
Available efficacy data for the indication of treatment of HAE attacks from the pivotal trial is of 
borderline statistical significance. Taking into ac count also the additional support by further statistical 
analyses there is however sufficient evidence of efficacy in this study. The efficacy was better in the 
open-label trial, where milder cases were also included and subjects who received opiates for pain 
were not censored. The discussion whether a faster onset of relief could be attained with an adjusted 
dose regimen together with a review of all available data with Cinryze and other plasma derived C1 
INH products led to the view that mainly subjects who presented with severe, especially with laryngeal 
attacks, and those who started Cinryze treatment after a more than 4 hours delay after attack onset, 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 62/64
 
 
 
were more likely to be in need of a second 1000 U dose one hour after the first dose. It is therefore 
suggested to consider an earlier administration of the second 1000 U dose (not having to wait for 60 
minutes between both doses) in this subgroup of attacks. This approach of a situation-adapted 
administration of the second 1000 U dose is considered appropriate to ensure adequate and rapid 
treatment for those with severe attacks or those who have a delayed presentation and is justified on 
the basis of the available data. Further experience will be generated through a post-marketing registry, 
which will monitor available information on severe and laryngeal attacks as well as cases where 
treatment started later than 4 hours after onset of attack. Supportive of a beneficial effect in the 
treatment of acute attacks are the consistency of the favourable effects in all, the primary and 
secondary endpoints together with the absence of relevant safety concerns in the pivotal and open-
label studies with Cinryze and the longstanding experience with the use of a preceding C1 INH 
preparation.  
When used as pre-procedural prevention, the available data from a dedicated analysis confirms the 
efficacy and safety of Cinryze. 
For the use of Cinryze in long-term prophylaxis, a clear evidence of efficacy was found in terms of the 
frequency, severity and duration of attacks and the number of days of swelling, all of which were 
significantly reduced. However, during evaluation it has been questioned, whether a higher than ~50% 
reduction of the number of attacks, as shown in the presented pivotal trial, could be reached with an 
intensified dose regimen. Based on available data the potential effects of higher doses cannot be fully 
assessed. The problems of frequent IV access, the treatment burden of twice weekly infusions and the 
need for additional on demand therapy need to be weighed individually against the efficacy as 
demonstrated. This lies within the responsibility of the treating physician, who has to carefully balance 
the individual patient’s quality of life, taking into consideration both the benefits and the burden of 
long-term therapy. The SmPC states that for routine prevention of attacks the dosing of 1000 Units 
every 3 to 4 days may need to be adjusted according to the individual response. Results from the 
ongoing dose escalation study in long-term prevention therapy in insufficiently controlled HAE patients 
are to be reported as soon as available. The risk of thrombosis at the injection site, especially when 
administered via an indwelling catheter, has to be further monitored. The indication for a long-term 
prophylactic therapy should, in the light of currently available data on efficacy and safety, will be 
restricted to the patients that are most likely to benefit from such prophylactic therapy – severely 
affected patients, who are intolerant to or insufficiently protected by oral prevention treatments or 
patients who are inadequately managed with repeated acute treatment. Regular review of the 
individual patients’ benefit:risk balance will be performed by the prescribing physician, thereby 
ensuring that only those who have a positive B/R for long-term prophylaxis are maintained on therapy. 
Available data are insufficient to recommend a safe and effective dose for the treatment of children 
aged below 12 years, therefore the use of Cinryze is restricted to adults and adolescents. 
At present no C1 INH product is approved in Europe for long-term prevention of HAE attacks. In 
addition, no C1 INH product is approved for pre-procedure prophylaxis throughout the EU. A marketing 
authorisation for Cinryze in the agreed indication would therefore add treatment options for HAE 
patients. 
2.8.2.  Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were 
needed to investigate further some of the safety concern as reflected in section 3.7. 
Additional risk minimisation activities were also required and are reflected in section 2.3. 
Cinryze 
Asessment report  
Page 63/64
 
 
 
2.8.3.  Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Cinryze is not similar to Icatibant (Firazyr) within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.  
2.9.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Cinryze in: 
-treatment and pre-procedure prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents with 
hereditary angioedema (HAE), and  
-routine prevention of angioedema attacks in adults and adolescents with severe and recurrent attacks 
of hereditary angioedema (HAE), who are intolerant to or insufficiently protected by oral prevention 
treatments, or patients who are inadequately managed with repeated acute treatment. 
was favourable.  
However, the CHMP notes that pursuant to the Commission Communication on the Community 
marketing authorisation procedures for medicinal products (98/C 229/03), ViroPharma is to be 
considered as the same applicant/marketing authorisation holder as Sanquin, which holds marketing 
authorisations in a number of Member States for a medicinal product containing the same qualitative 
and quantitative composition in active substance(s), having the same pharmaceutical form and 
overlapping indication(s) as the above mentioned medicinal product. These particulars may preclude 
the granting of a marketing authorisation for the above mentioned medicinal product. 
In addition, the CHMP, with reference to Article 8 of Regulation EC No 141/2000, considers Cinryze not 
to be similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation EC No. 847/2000) to Firazyr for the 
same therapeutic indication.

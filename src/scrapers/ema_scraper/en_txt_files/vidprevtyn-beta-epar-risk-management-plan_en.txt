Brief description of the product 
Chemical class: 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) is a recombinant adjuvanted 
vaccine further also referred as COVID-19 Vaccine (Recombinant, 
Adjuvanted). 
Summary of mode action: 
The mechanism of action consists of the induction of immune 
responses against the antigens contained in the vaccine. 
Following administration, the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV-2 
associated with AS03 adjuvant is stimulating neutralizing and other 
functional S-specific antibodies, as well as cellular immune 
responses directed against the S antigen, which may contribute to 
protection against COVID-19. 
Important information about its composition: 
Recombinant CoV-2 Spike Protein (B.1.351) antigen is produced in 
a continuous insect cell line and by recombinant DNA technology. 
AS03 adjuvant is an oil-in-water emulsion composed of squalene, 
DL-α-tocopherol and polysorbate 80. 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) contains no egg proteins, 
antibiotics, or preservatives. 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) may contain octylphenol ethoxylate, 
a trace residual from the manufacturing process.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SI: EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE 
INDICATION(S) AND TARGET POPULATION(S)  
A novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, first detected in Wuhan city, Hubei province, China, in 
December 2019 caused an initial outbreak of severe respiratory illness in the local population. 
This outbreak rapidly escalated until on 20 January 2020 the World Health Organization (WHO) 
first declared the outbreak as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern 
until 11 March 2020, when the status was changed and a pandemic was declared. Globally, as of 
30 September 2022, there have been 614 385 693 confirmed cases of COVID-19, 
including 6 522 600 deaths, reported to WHO. 1 Although all regions have reported substantive 
numbers of cases, the greatest cumulative numbers of confirmed cases to date (as of the 
30 September 2022) have been in Europe (254 million cases), the Americas (178 million cases), 
and the Western Pacific (89 million cases). 1 Geographical variations have been observed in the 
burden of disease at the country level, mostly due to differences in timing and stringency of 
non-pharmaceutical interventions implemented. Differences of practices in testing/reporting of 
cases and healthcare management for severe cases may have had an impact on the number of 
reported cases globally. 2 
Clinical features and natural history of the disease 
Coronavirus disease-2019 symptoms may vary from mild to severe, with approximately 
33% to 55% 3 of known cases to be asymptomatic (varies by variant). 4 The risk of transmission 
from an asymptomatic appears to be less than that from an individual with symptoms. 
Nevertheless, asymptomatic or pre-symptomatic individuals are less likely to isolate themselves 
from other people, and the extent to which transmission from such individuals contributes to the 
pandemic is uncertain. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) modelling study 
estimated that 59% of transmission could be attributed to individuals without symptoms: 
35% from pre-symptomatic individuals, and 24% from those who remained asymptomatic. 5 
Symptoms appear on average 4 to 5 days after infection, though the usual range is between 
2 to 14 days. Preliminary data shows the incubation period for Omicron to be 2.9 to 3.2 days. 6 
Most reported symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle ache, cough, and shortness of breath, 
which can progress to pneumonia. 7 Mild acute disease tends to resolve within approximately 
2 weeks, whereas severe cases can last 36 weeks. Longer term sequalae in some cases, otherwise 
known as “long-COVID” or “post-acute COVID syndrome”, in which symptoms such as 
headaches, fatigue, myocarditis, and dyspnea can last for weeks or even months after the acute 
phase. 8,9 Older adults and people who have severe underlying medical conditions (eg, Heart/Lung 
disease, Diabetes, or conditions affecting the immune system, such as immunosuppression) have 
been observed to be at higher risk for developing more serious complications from COVID-19. 10 
The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical, though most infections are 
not severe. A report published by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention 
concluded that out of approximately 44 500 confirmed infections, 81% of patients suffered from 
mild symptoms (no/mild pneumonia). 14% of patients suffered from severe disease (including 
dyspnea, hypoxia, or over 50% lung involvement on imaging within 24/48 hours). 
Five percent (5%) of patients suffered from critical disease, defined as respiratory failure, shock

or multiorgan dysfunction. 8 Overall, as of 30 September 2022, there is an estimated global 
fatality rate of 1% (March 2020 to September 2022) with variations between countries and over 
the time period. 1 
Transmissibility and spectrum of severity have been reported to evolve according to the various 
variants currently circulating. 
Variants of Concern (VOC) 
Identification as a VOC is based on the following criteria: an increase in transmissibility or 
detrimental change in COVID-19 epidemiology; or an increase in virulence or change in clinical 
disease presentation; or a decrease in effectiveness of public health and social measures or 
available diagnostics, vaccines, therapeutics. 9 
New and emerging variants are also playing an important role in local and global epidemiology. 
Starting from 18 December 2020, five VOCs have been identified by the WHO, namely Alpha, 
Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron.  
The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) also regularly assesses the 
evidence on the variants and designated VOCs based on the situation in EU/EEA region. 
As of September 2022, the only VOC defined by WHO and ECDC is Omicron, with ECDC 
specifying four sub-lineages of Omicron; BA.1, BA.2, BA.4 and BA.5. 9,10,11 
There continues to be increased diversity within Omicron and within its descendent lineages. 
A number of these Omicron descendent lineages are under monitoring. Globally, and as of the 
epidemiological week 36 (05 September 2022 to 11 September 2022), BA.5 descendent lineages 
continue to be dominant accounting for 81.2% of sequences, followed by BA.4 descendent 
lineages (including BA.4.6) which account for 8.1%, and BA.2 descendent lineages (including 
BA.2.75) which account for 2.9% of sequences. The Omicron variant has a substantial growth 
advantage, due in part to a combination of immune escape and intrinsic high transmissibility, and 
rapidly became the predominant strain worldwide. 12 
The Omicron variant showed up to 70 times faster multiplication in the bronchus than Delta and 
the evidence from both the United Kingdom (UK) and Denmark showed an increased secondary 
attack rate compared to Delta. 13,14 In terms of severity, several studies suggested less severe 
outcomes compared to Delta including hospitalization, intensive care unit (ICU) admission, and 
mechanical ventilation. 15,16,17

EU/EEA variant distribution 
In the EU/EEA region, Omicron has been first reported in November 2021 and became 
predominant strain rapidly from the second half of December 2021 onwards.  
Among the 13 countries with an adequate volume of sequencing or genotyping for 
weeks 36-37 (05 September to 18 September 2022), the estimated distribution of VOC or of 
variants of interest (VOI) was 98.8% (98.2-100.0% from 13 countries) for BA.4/BA.5, 
0.9% (0.2 1.8%, 369 detections from 11 countries) for BA.2 and 0.8% (0.6-1.2%, 164 detections 
from 6 countries) for BA.2.75.  
An analysis by the UK Health Security Agency estimates BA.2 to have 75% increased 
transmissibility when compared to BA.1, and BA.5 is reported to be 35% more transmissible than 
BA.2. 19 Currently available evidence does not suggest a difference in disease severity between 
the sublineages. 20 
Despite a characterized reduction in neutralizing activity of Omicron VOC as compared to 
previous VOCs, and between Omicron sublineages eg, BA.5 compared to BA.1, 21,22,23 vaccine 
effectiveness (VE) against severe disease of the primary series showed some decline over 
six months (10-20%) 20 suggesting protective effect of primo vaccination against Omicron VOC

severe infections. The first booster dose vaccination improved VE against severe disease: ≥70% in 
34 (94%) of 36 estimates evaluating VE between 14 days and three months of receipt of a booster 
dose. 20 
Demographics of the population indicated and risk factors for the disease 
Epidemiological data collected since the beginning of the pandemic have shown that individuals 
of any age can acquire infection of SARS-CoV-2, however there is an uneven distribution of 
infections per defined age group. According to data published by the WHO, people aged 
30 to 39 years have the highest amount of confirmed and probable cases, followed 
by 20 to 29, 40 to 49 and 50 to 59 years age groups respectively. This age-based distribution 
however does not correlate across gender-based distribution, with infections occurring at similar 
rates between males and females. 
When it comes to severity of disease there is also an uneven distribution, with a higher impact on 
the elderly population. Results published by the ECDC show a similar pattern of infection 
distribution amongst age groups and sexes as the WHO. The distribution for mild cases also 
correlates relatively closely to total number of cases. A definition of a mild case in this instance is 
one that does not require hospitalization or result in death. Pooled data from EU/EEA countries 
show positive correlation with age, showing that as age increases, so does the risk of 
hospitalization. Infection with SARS-CoV-2 leading to a fatal outcome also very strongly 
correlates with age, with adults over 60 years of age primarily dying as a result of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to younger age groups. 
Risk factors for severe disease and death 
The estimated case fatality rate varies widely between countries, influenced by a variety of factors 
including testing and screening approaches, demographics, healthcare availability and others. 
Although the global case fatality ratio (CFR) has changed overtime due to various waves of 
infection, variants, non-pharmaceutical intervention (NPIs) and vaccination strategies, the CFR 
has remained highest amongst 60 year or older groups population. 
Studies have observed that the risk of COVID-19 severity is higher with the increasing age, male 
sex, and presence of comorbidities, especially cardiovascular disease (CVD). 1,24 Smoking was 
also found to be associated with increased risk of severity 5,8,25 and mortality. 26 Residents of 
long-term care facilities (LTCFs) have been regarded as a medically and socially vulnerable group 
and 72% of all COVID-19 related deaths in Europe were attributed to residents at LTCFs. 27 
Important comorbidities 
The results of the systematic reviews, below in Table 6, showed the higher relative risks of both 
severity and mortality amongst patients with certain comorbidities upon infection with 
SARS-CoV-2.

Therapeutic Treatment options 
There is currently no cure for COVID-19. Multiple antivirals and therapeutic treatments that 
target severe COVID-19 have been authorized, however most therapeutic options are still in early 
stages of research (over 670 drug development programs are in planning stages and over 470 trials 
are being reviewed by the Food and Drug Administration [FDA]).  
Antiviral treatment 
Antivirals for COVID-19 are indicated for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults and paediatric 
patients (at least 4 weeks of age and weighing at least 3 kg) with pneumonia requiring 
supplemental oxygen and in adults and paediatric patients (weighing at least 40 kg) who do not 
require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk of progressing to severe COVID-19. 
The antiviral, remdesivir, has been approved by the FDA. 62 The European Commission (EC) 
have authorized two antiviral treatments for the use in the EU: remdesivir and

PF-07321332/ritonavir (Paxlovid). A third antiviral (molnupiravir) has been submitted for 
marketing authorization in the EU. 63 
Therapeutic treatment  
Multiple therapeutic treatments for COVID-19 have been authorized. The FDA have authorized 
14 treatments for emergency use. 62 The EC has authorized six treatments for the use in the EU 
with several monoclonal antibodies (regdanvimab, tocilizumab, casirivimab/imdevimab, 
tixagevimab/cilgavimab and sotrovimab) and an anti-inflammatory molecule (anakinra). 63 
A tyrosine kinase inhibitor currently approved for the treatment of polyarthritis rheumatoid 
(Baricitinib) has been submitted for marketing authorization in the EU. 
The recommended use of each therapeutic is based on the medical status of the patient. The 
WHO’s guideline development group considered benefits of remdesivir to be modest and of 
moderate certainty for key outcomes such as mortality and mechanical ventilation, resulting in a 
conditional recommendation. 
Recently, WHO indicated that (sotrovimab) and (casirivimab-imdevimab) initially recommended 
in patients who do not require supplemental oxygen but are at an increased risk of developing 
severe disease, have “meaningfully reduced neutralization activity of the currently circulating 
variants of SARS-CoV-2 and their subvariants”. 
World Health Organization also said that other therapies such as tocilizumab or sarilumab 
interleukin (IL-6 receptor blockers) and baricitinib (the Janus Kinase [JAK] inhibitor) may now 
be combined, in addition to corticosteroids, in patients with severe or critical COVID-19 and 
requiring supplemental oxygen or mechanical ventilation. 
Prophylactic Treatment options 
Following the introduction of the first SARS-CoV-2 vaccines in December 2020, vaccination is 
reducing burden of disease, but the full effect won’t be realized until adequate vaccine coverages 
rates are achieved. Vaccine supply and access remain far short of the global need, with additional 
confounders such as waning immunity and emerging variants posing a challenge to establishing 
and maintaining herd immunity within vaccinated populations. 
This challenge is still under debate in the scientific and medical community to establish the best 
way to tackle current and emerging variants. Dozens of non-profits, government agencies and 
vaccine makers have made a top research priority to propose in a near future booster vaccines 
susceptible to provide protection among a large panel of variant of concern. 64 Meanwhile, health 
agencies (FDA and EMA) recently approved several mRNA booster vaccine containing Omicron 
(Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.1 and Comirnaty Original/Omicron BA.4-5 [BioNTech and 
Pfizer]; Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 [Moderna]). 
World Health Organization issued emergency use listing (EUL) for 11 COVID-19 vaccines 
developed by Pfizer/BioNTech, AstraZeneca/SK Bioscience, Janssen-Cilag, Moderna Biotech, 
Beijing Institute of Biological Products, Sinovac Life Sciences, Bharat Biotech, Serum Institute of 
India Pvt. Ltd, Novavax and, CanSino Biologics. 62,63 In Europe, the EC has so far granted 
6 marketing authorizations, following the positive assessment of the EMA regarding their safety 
and their effectiveness: 65 two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, one developed by BioNTech and 
Pfizer, (BNT162b2) and another by Moderna, (mRNA 1273), two viral vector vaccines,

one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca (ChAdOx1 nCOV 19) and one developed 
by Janssen (Ad26 COV2.S), one recombinant protein vaccine developed by Novavax and 
one inactivated, adjuvanted vaccine manufactured by Valneva. Several other vaccines are at 
different stages of their evaluation by the EMA: Inactivated Vaccine (Vero Cell) by 
Sinovac Life Sciences Co. Ltd, COVID-19 vaccine HIPRA (PHH-IV) by HIPRA Human Health 
S.L.U., VidPrevtyn Beta by Sanofi Pasteur, Sputnik V (Gam-COVID-Vac) by Russia’s Gamaleya 
National Centre of Epidemiology and Microbiology and Skycovion (SK Chemicals GmbH). 66 
The United States (US) FDA currently only recommend three COVID-19 vaccines for general 
use, BioNTech and Pfizer (BNT162b2), 67,68 Moderna (mRNA 1273) 69,70 and 
Janssen vaccine (Ad26 COV2.S). 71  
With the introduction of vaccines starting in December 2020, the impact of vaccination programs 
is continuing to play a role in local trends. As of 23 June 2022, a total of 12.1 billion doses of 
vaccines have been administered worldwide, and the highest coverage countries have achieved 
over 95% of the population fully vaccinated with a primary series, with the UK at 73% and the 
US at 67% coverage; however, most countries are still much lower than this. Europe as a 
continent has an average coverage rate of 66%, however the range within Europe extends from 
86% (Portugal) to 30% (Bulgaria). Vaccine coverage in particularly affected European countries 
varies considerably, with high and upper middle-income countries at >75%, lower middle-income 
countries at 55%, and many low-income countries at 15% of the population receiving 
two doses. 72

Waning of SARS-CoV-2 immunity  
One of the remaining unknowns of COVID-19 is the durability of immunity including the time 
taken to be susceptible to reinfection. Research is being conducted on this subject, and 
preliminary data has been published, however due to the relatively short time since the beginning 
of the pandemic, longer-term data is not yet available. This is further confounded by the 
emergence of new VOCs and VOIs, especially with Omicron, with observed reductions in VE 
either being attributed to waning immunity, or reduced effectiveness against variants due to 
immune escape, or both. 
Natural infection 
Direct data remain limited for the durability of immunity after natural infection with 
SARS-CoV-2, although a recent comparative evolutionary study examining durability of 
immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and related viruses (SARS-CoV, middle east respiratory syndrome 
coronavirus [MERS-CoV], human coronavirus [HCoV]-229E, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-NL63) 
concluded that there is a phylogenetic relationship between human-infecting coronaviruses, and 
that reinfection by SARS-CoV-2 specifically under endemic conditions can occur between 3 and 
63 months after peak antibody response, with a median time of 16 months. 74 Another study 
looked into immunological memory to SARS-CoV-2 up to 8 months after infection and found that 
each component of immune memory in convalescent patients exhibited distinct kinetics, with 
spike-specific memory B cells becoming more abundant at 6 months compared to 1 month. 
Immunoglobulin G to spike protein was also relatively stable over a 6-month period and cluster of 
differentiation 4 (CD4)+ and CD8+ T cells declined with a half-life of 3 to 5 months. 75 
Vaccine induced protection 
When directly comparing the magnitude of responses to either vaccination or natural infection, 
currently licensed vaccines have been shown to produce peak neutralizing antibody responses up 
to four-times those seen in convalescent patients. 76 It has also been observed that the decay of a 
neutralizing titre of antibodies in vaccinated subjects over the first 3 to 4 months after vaccination 
was at least as rapid as the decay observed in convalescent patients. 77 
There is also a growing body of evidence that indicates a reduction in VE over time. Several 
studies, across a range of approved COVID-19 vaccines, have shown that although VE against 
symptomatic disease peaks in the early weeks after the second dose, it gradually declines from as 
little as 3 months after the second dose. 78 This waning is also more pronounced in the over 
65-year-olds, as well as those in a clinically extremely vulnerable group, and 40 to 64-year-olds 
with underlying conditions compared to healthy adults. 79 This gradual declining of VE was also 
observed with respect to specific variants, including Beta, Delta, and Mu previously. 80 
Emergence of Omicron has made waning immunity more prominent with the improved ability to 
escape both natural as well as vaccine induced protection. 81 
Booster Dose 
Considering the evidence on waning immunity, most EU countries are offering additional doses of 
vaccine with priority for all adults (18+). The EMA has published guidance on the populations 
requiring a booster, as well as the recommended time interval for each group. 81 The minimal 
interval after the primary vaccination schedule is between 1 to 8 months and is dependent on the

target population and by country. Both homologous (same vaccine) and heterologous (different 
vaccines/platforms) booster doses are being provided. The heterologous booster vaccinations are 
recommended by multiple health agencies globally, with some initial evidence of higher 
effectiveness of heterologous primary + booster series against severe and symptomatic disease. 
82,83 Real world effectiveness studies have shown both homologous and heterologous boosters 
reinforce significant protection against severe disease and hospitalization following waning of 
primo-vaccination. 82  
It is important to note that waning immunity against the currently dominant Omicron variant has 
also been observed after administration of a parental booster dose. 17,84,85

Active immunization to prevent COVID-19 (Booster dose)  
As of 30-Sep-2022, there have been more than 614 million confirmed cases of 
COVID-19 and over 6.5 million deaths reported. 1 
Daily new confirmed incident cases peaked at 2196 confirmed cases per million 
population in Europe (01/22), 2445/million in North America (01/22), 1025/million in 
South America (01/22), 188/million in Asia (01/22), 44/million in Africa (12/21) and 
4074/million in Oceania (01/22). However, regional-level estimates conceal the 
substantive variation experienced by country, with daily incidence rates reaching 
>6000/million population per day in Denmark and France at their highest peaks. 
Daily incidence rates have varied over time since the emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in 
Dec-2019, with most countries having experienced either four or five pandemic waves. 
In Jun-2022, regional incidence rates ranged 0 to 24 000/million population, with 
incidence trends varying across regions due to a rise in circulation of BA.4 and BA.5. 
Given the acute nature of COVID-19 disease and the rapidly changing pandemic 
epidemiology, prevalence estimates have not been the key measure for tracking 
COVID-19. However, seroprevalence surveys have provided valuable insights into the 
cumulative proportion of the population infected. 86 Seroreversion has been 
documented, so data are mostly reflective of infection within the previous 4-6 months. 
Modeled estimates by regions based on the available studies showed a range 
of 17% in Europe in Jul-2021 to 68% in Southeast Asia in May-2021. 87 Substantive 
regional variation has been documented within countries, for example in the UK 
seroprevalence estimates varied from 2.8% to 23.3% in regional household and 
community regional surveillance between Sep-2020 to May-2021. 
The proposed indication is broad, including: 
•  individuals 18 years of age and older previously vaccinated against COVID-19. 
Epidemiological data collected since the beginning of the pandemic have shown that 
individuals of any age can acquire infection of SARS-CoV-2, however there is an 
uneven distribution of infections per defined age group. This age-based distribution 
however does not correlate acrsoss gender-based distribution, with infections occurring 
at similar rates between males and females. 
Curative options: 
There is currently no cure for COVID-19. The antiviral treatment, remdesivir, has been 
approved by both the FDA and EC. The EC has also authorized other treatments: 
anakinra, regdanvimab, tocilizumab, casirivimab/imdevimab, tixagevimab/cilgavimab, 
sotrovimab and PF-07321332/ritonavir. Scientists are also studying a wide range of 
other potential treatments. Most therapeutic options however are still in early stages of 
research. 
Prophylaxis options in addition to social distancing and masking: 
The EC has so far granted 6 marketing authorizations, following the positive 
assessment of the EMA regarding their safety and their effectiveness:  
•  Two COVID-19 mRNA vaccines, one developed by BioNTech and Pfizer, 
(BNT162b2) and another by Moderna, (mRNA-1273).  
•  Two viral vector vaccines: one developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca 
(ChAdOx1-nCOV19) and one developed by Janssen (Ad26.COV2.S).  
•  One recombinant protein vaccine developed by Novavax. 
•  One inactivated vaccine developed by Valneva.

Dozens of non-profits, government agencies and vaccine makers have made a top 
research priority to propose in a near future booster vaccines susceptible to provide

(FDA and EMA) recently approved several mRNA booster vaccines containing Omicron

and Pfizer]; Spikevax bivalent Original/Omicron BA.1 [Moderna]). 
The spectrum of symptomatic infection ranges from mild to critical, though most 
infections are not severe. Symptoms may vary from mild to severe, and many 
infections are known to be asymptomatic. Of those with laboratory confirmed 
symptomatic disease, approximately 80% experience mild-to-moderate symptoms. 
Symptoms appear on average 4-5 days after infection, though the usual range is 
between 2 to 14 days. Most reported symptoms include fever, fatigue, muscle ache, 
cough, and shortness of breath, which can progress to pneumonia, ARDS, 
cardiovascular sequalae and other severe symptoms. 7 Mild acute disease tends to 
resolve within approximately 2 weeks, whereas severe cases may last 3-6 weeks. 
However, data are emerging indicative of long-term sequalae in some cases, otherwise 
known as “long-COVID” or “post-acute COVID syndrome”, in which symptoms such as 
headaches, fatigue, myocarditis, and dyspnea can last for weeks or even months after 
the acute phase. 8,9 The estimated CFR varies widely between countries, ranging from 
0.04% in Greenland and 0.08% in Iceland and Bhutan, to 6.93% and 6.5% in Peru and 
Mexico respectively with differences influenced by demographics, testing/reporting and 
health care availability. 88 
When it comes to severity of disease there is also an uneven distribution, with the 
elderly suffering much more than the younger population. Results published by the 
ECDC show a similar pattern of infection distribution amongst age groups and sexes as 
the WHO. 
Transmissibility and spectrum of severity have been reported to evolve according to the 
various variants currently circulating. 
Studies have observed that the risk of COVID-19 severity is higher with the increasing 
age, male sex, and presence of comorbidities, especially CVD. 1,24 Smoking was also 
found to be associated with increased risk of severity 5,8,25 and mortality. 26 
Residents of LTCFs have been regarded as a medically and socially vulnerable group 
and 72% of all COVID-19 related deaths in Europe were attributed to residents at 
LTCFs. 27 
Race and ethnicity also affect COVID-19 mortality rates. Native American and African 
American community members have higher mortality rates when compared to the 
White community in the US. 89 Public Health England reported that the mortality rate in 
BAME groups were higher than those in White ethnic groups. 90 
Key risk factors for severe COVID-19 disease include but not limited to CVD, diabetes, 
chronic respiratory disease, COPD, hypertension, malignancies, obesity, chronic 
kidney disease, cerebrovascular disease and stroke, with higher risk of severity and 
mortality ranging 1.14 to 7.1 times higher in these risk groups (Table 6). Older age 
(particularly ≥65 years) is a recognized risk factor for more severe COVID-19 disease 
and death, with populations aged 65-74 years at 5 times higher risk of hospitalization 
and 90 times higher risk of death than population aged 18-29 years old in the US. 87

vulnerability resulting from aging-associated decline in reserve and function across 
multiple physiologic systems such that the ability to cope with everyday activities or 
acute stressors. In the absence of a gold standard, frailty has been operationally 
defined as meeting three out of five phenotypic criteria indicating compromised 
energetics: low grip strength, low energy, slowed waking speed, low physical activity, 
and/or unintentional weight loss. 25,91 
Alternatively, frailty has been operationalized as a risk index by counting the number of 
deficits accumulated over time (termed “FI”) including disability, diseases, physical and 
cognitive impairments, psychosocial risk factors, and geriatric syndromes (eg, falls, 
delirium, and urinary incontinence). 92 It was argued that, compared to Fried’s frailty 
phenotype, the FI is a more sensitive predictor of adverse health outcomes due to its 
finer graded risk scale, and its robustness in clinical inferences with regard to the 
number and actual composition of the items in the FI. 93 
However, all ages and those without pre-existing co-morbidities are still at risk of 
severe COVID-19 disease and death.  
Additionally, “long-COVID” or “post-acute COVID syndrome” has been documented in 
younger and older adults. 
Therefore, it is possible that vaccines may be prioritized to risk groups given the higher 
risk of severe disease, but there is a clear medical need for vaccination of all age 
groups and regardless of the existence of co-morbidities.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SII: NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
The SARS-CoV-2 vaccine consists of preS-dTM antigen adjuvanted with 
AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline’s Adjuvant System composed of alpha-tocopherol, squalene and 
polysorbate 80 in an oil-in-water emulsion). 
The majority of non-clinical data was generated using the monovalent, original strain (D614), 
CoV2 preS dTM AS03 (D614) vaccine.  
The non-clinical assessment of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 original strain vaccine was based on 
immunogenicity, efficacy, and safety evaluation in laboratory animals.  
The variant vaccine (CoV2 preS dTM AS03 [B.1.351 or Beta strain]) is manufactured using the 
same technology and production process as parental vaccine (D614). The only change is the new 
immunogen B.1.351 while the rest of the vaccine formulation remains unaltered. This new 
component represents the same prefusion Spike protein antigen target as the parental (D614), with 
a drift in the amino acid sequence to match the B.1.351 variant strain. Therefore, no new 
toxicological findings are expected. Thus, a new toxicology study was not deemed necessary to 
support progression to registration. This approach is aligned with the conclusions from emergency 
use authorization for vaccines to prevent COVID-19 Guidance for Industry (October 2020, 
revised in 2022), the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA) 
COVID-19 Virus variants workshop (February 2021) together with the Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory Agency Guidance on strain changes in authorized COVID-19 vaccines 
(March 2021).  
The prototype (D614) vaccine immunogenicity was evaluated in naive mice, hamsters and 
macaques as well as in previously vaccinated macaques to document the benefit of a late booster. 
The Monovalent (B.1.351) vaccine immunogenicity was evaluated in naive and primed macaques, 
and the efficacy in hamsters. In naive animals, the different studies established the need for a 
second dose and the use of AS03 adjuvant to induce a potent neutralizing antibody response and 
efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 infection (in hamsters and macaques). 94 In previously vaccinated 
macaques, the results demonstrated a strong increase of the responses against the original 
virus (D614) and robust broadening of the neutralizing antibody responses to the VOCs Alpha, 
Beta, Gamma and Delta, as well as against Omicron. The studies also showed higher 
cross-neutralization of VOCs when the Monovalent (B.1.351) vaccine booster was formulated 
with AS03. 95 
The neutralizing antibody persistence and Spike-specific memory B cells were evaluated over 
6 months after the booster immunization. Six months post-booster, the neutralizing antibody titers 
against Omicron were more than 20-fold greater than baseline titers (pre-booster), and the 
memory B cells responses were increased to robust levels, especially in animals with low 
responses at baseline. 
For the non-clinical safety evaluation, the local tolerance and potential systemic toxicity of the 
(D614) vaccine was assessed in two repeated dose toxicity studies as well as in a developmental 
and reproductive toxicity (DART) study in rabbits, and the potential of vaccine-associated 
enhanced respiratory disease (VAERD) was evaluated in immunogenicity and efficacy studies 
conducted in Non-Human Primates (NHP) and Golden Syrian Hamsters.

This (D614) vaccine has been assessed in two repeated dose toxicity studies in New Zealand 
White (NZW) rabbits, which are known to develop an immune response to CoV2 preS dTM 
antigen. These studies were conducted by the intramuscular (IM) route, which is the clinical route, 
and each injection consisted of one 0.5 mL dose of the CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) vaccine. 
A total of 2 or 3 IM injections were given every 2 weeks to the animals. The key safety findings 
from these studies are reported in the summary table below. 
In the first repeated dose toxicity study (Study No. 5003471), following a single dose 
administration, S-specific Immunoglobulin G (IgG) response was detected on Day 15 in four out 
of ten animals injected with the CoV2 preS dTM (D614) antigen alone and in all animals injected 
with the CoV2 preS dTM (D614) antigen in combination with AS03. After three injections, 
S-specific IgG titers were detected in 14 out of 20 animals dosed with CoV2 preS dTM (D614) 
antigen alone, and in all animals dosed with CoV2 preS dTM (D614) adjuvanted with AS03. 
In comparison to animals dosed with CoV2 preS dTM (D614) alone, an overall increase in 
S-specific titers was observed on Day 15, Day 31, and Day 45 in all animals dosed with the 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) adjuvanted vaccine. 
In this study (Study No. 5003471), a single or repeated (three times) IM injection(s) of 
CoV2 preS dTM (D614) at a dose level of 15 µg/dose (targeted dose; representing an effective 
dose of 3.9 μg of the CoV2 preS dTM (D614) protein after recalculation) either alone or with 
AS03 adjuvant were well tolerated in rabbits. Administration of CoV2 preS dTM (D614) with 
AS03 resulted in transient and non-adverse changes in hematology, coagulation and clinical 
chemistry parameters indicative of a transient acute phase response/inflammation. These changes 
correlated with non-adverse histopathology findings of increased severity of acute/subacute to 
subacute/chronic mixed cell inflammation at the injection site and in the overlying skin of animals 
administered CoV2 preS dTM (D614) with AS03. Animals injected on three occasions, also 
showed increased lymphoid cellularity in the spleen (correlating with increased spleen weights) 
and lymph nodes. After the 2 weeks recovery period (single or repeated doses), only changes in 
laboratory parameters related to immunization were noted, and the inflammation at the injection 
site was less pronounced (ie, partial reversibility) but still observed, as expected with the ongoing 
healing process. These results are expected for an adjuvanted vaccine and suggested that it does 
not represent any special hazard for humans. 
In the second repeated dose toxicity study (Study No. 5003591), two IM injections of 
CoV2 preS dTM (D614) at a dose level of 5 µg/dose (targeted dose; representing an effective dose 
of 2.4 µg of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein content after recalculation) adjuvanted with AS03 
was well tolerated in rabbits. It induced very slight erythema and/or edema observed at the 
injection sites. In addition, non-adverse minimal to mild increases in absolute neutrophil count, 
fibrinogen, globulin, mild to marked increases in C-reactive protein and minimal decreases in 
albumin/globulin (A/G) ratio in males and females were noted. These changes correlated with 
microscopic changes as evidenced by an increase in severity of mixed cell inflammation 
(subacute/chronic) at the injection sites accompanied by multifocal aggregates of vacuolated 
macrophages. In addition, an increase in incidence and severity of fibrosis/fibroplasia was also 
observed in treated rabbits. Increased lymphoid cellularity in various lymph nodes and/or mixed 
inflammatory cell infiltration were also seen as well as an increase in adrenal gland and spleen 
weights that was noted in treated males but did not correlate with any macroscopic or microscopic 
change different from controls. Overall, this second toxicology study did not elicit any new

findings on top of those already seen with the CoV2 preS dTM (D614) adjuvanted with AS03. 
The key non-clinical findings are presented in Table 8. 
In the DART study (Study No. 20288238), IM administration of CoV2 preS dTM (D614) 
adjuvanted with AS03 at 10 and 15 µg preS dTM/dose before and during gestation (total of 
five administrations) to female NZW rabbits was associated with non-adverse dose-related 
transient lower body weight gain during the pre-mating period after the second injection only. 
Vaccine-related local reactions at the injection site, such as oedema and induration of increasing 
severity after repeated administration, and microscopic inflammation, hemorrhage, muscular 
degeneration/necrosis, vacuolation of macrophages, and/or fibroplasia, were observed in both 
vaccine groups. There were no vaccine-related effects on mating performance or fertility in 
female rabbits, or on embryo-fetal (including teratogenicity) and early post-natal development of 
the offspring. 
The potential risk for VAERD or Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease (VAED) was assessed 
indirectly through the documentation of the immune responses, specifically the CD4 T-helper 
(Th) cell responses: type I (Th1) versus type 2 (Th2) and directly through challenges with 
SARS-CoV-2 in susceptible animal species that had been vaccinated prior to viral exposure. 
The CD4 Th1/Th2 responses were evaluated in naive Rhesus macaques after immunization with 
2 doses of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614). Two weeks post-immunization (D35), the peripheral 
blood mononuclear cells containing the CD4 T cells were sampled, stimulated with the Spike 
antigen and the Th1 and Th2 cytokines secreted by the activated CD4 T cells were measured 
using intracellular cytokine staining (ICS). The results indicated a mixed population of Th1 and 
Th2 CD4 T cells, with mainly a “Th0” population secreting tumor necrosis factor alpha and IL-2. 
There was no evidence of a Th2 dominant responses which was previously associated to VAERD 
with inactivated SARS-CoV vaccines. 96 Similar T-cell response profile is expected for the variant 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351), as the B.1.351 spike showed no impact on CD4 or CD8 
responses in previously infected or vaccinated individuals. 
The absence of VAERD was then confirmed by directly looking at the pathology caused by 
SARS-CoV-2 infection in vaccinated animals. Two species, namely Rhesus macaques 
(CoV2-04_NHP study) and Golden Syrian Hamsters (CoV2-03_Hm study) were utilized for 
assessment of VAERD and vaccine efficacy. In macaques, animals were vaccinated with 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (D614) (down to lowest antigen doses of 4 µg) and exposed to a 
non-attenuated, qualified stock of SARS-CoV-2, Wuhan strain. In hamsters, animals were 
vaccinated with the parental Monovalent D614 or Monovalent B.1.351 CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
vaccine formulations, with 1 µg or 2 µg and exposed to D614 strain, Alpha variant or Beta 
(B.1.351) variant strains. The assessment of VAERD was based on viral replication in upper and 
lower respiratory tract, lung histopathology evaluation (Hematoxylin and Eosin [H and E] staining 
and Viral N protein immunochemistry) and any clinical signs (body weight and general behavior) 
in the vaccine groups as compared to an unvaccinated control group. The results showed that the 
viral loads in lungs and nares measured using quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain 
reaction (qRT-PCR) were reduced or below the level of detection in all immunized animals, 
confirming no enhancement of viral replication in vaccinated animals. In NHPs, the histological 
and immunohistochemical staining of the lung samples collected at D7 or D8 and D14 or D15 
post-challenge showed reduction of inflammation and eosinophil infiltration in the lungs of the 
AS03-adjuvanted vaccine groups compared to the non-vaccinated control group. In addition, the

lung samples of the vaccinated animals had a marked reduction of the infected cells at D7/8, 
consistent with the finding of reduced viral loads by qRT-PCR. These findings suggested a 
consistent correlation between viral infection and histopathology, and there was no enhancement 
of viral replication nor lung pathology due to vaccination. Importantly, no increase of the 
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines levels in the lungs was detected post-challenge in the 
vaccinated Rhesus, except for a transient slight increase of IL-5 on D2 that resolved on D4 and 
was not associated to eosinophilia as evidenced by histopathology. Altogether, the various 
analyses combined provided direct confirmation that no signs of enhanced inflammation due to 
vaccination were observed as compared to the controls after challenge with a virulent viral stock 
in rhesus macaques, a species with an immune system highly analogous to human. Similar 
reduction of viral replication and lung pathology was observed in hamsters using the Monovalent 
B.1.351vaccine, whatever the viral strain used for the challenge. Altogether the non-clinical 
studies showed no signs of disease enhancement in vaccinated animals.

one in vivo test (micronucleus test in the rat after intravenous 
administration). No indication of genotoxicity was evident. The vaccine 
was not tested. 
•  No carcinogenicity study requested for vaccines according to WHO 
guidelines (WHO, 2005) (WHO, 2013). CoV-2 preS dTM-AS03 is not 
expected to be carcinogenic in humans. 
•  Consistent with usual vaccine development programs, no safety 
pharmacology studies will be conducted, unless there are significant 
findings in the toxicology studies that would require further investigation

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SIII: CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE  
SIII.1.  BRIEF OVERVIEW OF DEVELOPMENT  
The clinical development of the CoV2 preS dTM AS03-adjuvanted vaccine 
(SARS-CoV2 preS dTM, the SARS-CoV-2 recombinant protein vaccine) has been the following: 
The first Phase I/II Clinical Study (VAT00001) has been conducted in adults and elderly to 
document the safety and the immunogenicity of vaccine formulations as primary series using 
CoV2 preS dTM AS03 (D614).  
The lower-than-expected immunogenicity in combination with the higher-than-expected 
reactogenicity observed in the Phase I/II study indicated that assessment of optimized antigen 
formulations (with higher antigen dose and lower host cell protein content) was necessary to 
select a formulation to progress to Phase III evaluation, 97 which was then evaluated in the 
VAT00002 Phase II Original Cohort primary series.  
VAT00001 Phase I/II exposure data has not been included in clinical trial exposure due to the 
suboptimal formulation. The interim data are considered as not relevant for safety assessment. 
A Phase II (VAT00002 - Original Cohort, primary series) randomized, modified double-blind, 
multicenter, dose finding study has been conducted in adults 18 years of age and older to evaluate 
the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 2 injections of 5 µg, 10 μg, or 15 µg of the 
CoV2 preS dTM (D614) vaccine, adjuvanted with AS03. Interim data from this Phase II study 
was used to decide on progression to Phase III and to select an antigen dose formulation for 
further clinical development evaluating the vaccines when used as a late booster. 98 
Supplemental cohorts were tested as part of VAT00002 Phase II/III study to address various 
prime boost options (the Monovalent B.1.351 [Beta variant] formulation was used in the 
Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2).  
•  Supplemental Phase III Cohort 1 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster 
dose of the parental strain (Monovalent D614) vaccine among adults previously 
vaccinated with a primary series of mRNA (Pfizer/BioNTech or Moderna) or 
adenovirus-vectored vaccines (Janssen or AstraZeneca).  
•  Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of a booster 
dose of a variant vaccine (Monovalent B.1.351 [Beta variant] or Bivalent [D614/B.1.351]) 
in adults previously primed with mRNA or adenovirus-vectored vaccines.  
• 
In addition, available and willing individuals previously primed with the adjuvanted 
recombinant protein vaccine (different formulations) as part of the Phase II Original 
Cohort were enrolled into the Supplemental Phase III Cohort 2 and randomized to a 
booster dose of the parental strain booster vaccine or Monovalent variant booster vaccine. 
•  Selection of the 5 µg dose was based on the immunogenicity results in non-naive 
participants of the original cohort of VAT00002. 
A Phase III Clinical Study (VAT00008) randomized, modified double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multi-stage, multi-center, multi-country study is being conducted to assess the efficacy, safety, 
and immunogenicity of 2 CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 vaccines (Monovalent [original variant

first identified in Wuhan; D614] and Bivalent; D614/B.1.351) in adults 18 years of age and older 
with 2 stages as a primary series and open-label extension to assess immunogenicity, safety, 
efficacy of a Monovalent (B.1.351) booster dose of SARS-CoV-2 adjuvanted recombinant protein 
vaccine. 
•  For stage 1, 10 µg antigen Monovalent D614 adjuvanted vaccine is evaluated against 
placebo. This selection mitigates the risk of having lower antibody titers against variants 
that would be circulating at the time of the efficacy study with potential to result in lower 
observed vaccine efficacy for the Monovalent D614 vaccine. 
•  For stage 2, 5 µg (D614 component) + 5 µg (B.1.351 component) antigen dose (Bivalent 
[D614/B.1.351] adjuvanted vaccine) is evaluated against placebo. It is reasonable to 
expect that similar homologous responses would be elicited by the B.1.351 component of 
the bivalent vaccine. Thus, by design, the inclusion of the B.1.351 antigen with the 
D614 antigen in the bivalent vaccine mitigates the risk of lower antibody responses against 
circulating variants anticipated with the Monovalent D614 vaccine. 
•  A booster extension: all participants enrolled in Stages 1 and 2 are offered a Monovalent 
(B.1.351) booster dose if they are eligible and if they consent to receive it. A safety 
follow-up of 12 months after booster administration is implemented (unsolicited adverse 
events (AE), medically attended adverse event [MAAEs], serious adverse event [SAEs] 
and adverse event of special interests [AESIs]).  
An Investigator Sponsored Study (VAT00013/COVIBOOST), randomized, single-blinded 
multicenter clinical trial has been conducted to assess the immunogenicity and safety following a 
booster dose of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccine original formulation (Pfizer/BioNTech) and 
two adjuvanted sub-unit vaccines (Monovalent D614 or Monovalent B.1.351) administered in 
adults who received 2 doses of Pfizer/BioNTech mRNA original formulation vaccine as a primary 
vaccination. The safety data are considered as supportive data owing to the differences in safety 
data collection methods with VAT00002 Phase II/III and VAT00008 Phase III Clinical Studies 
(type of safety data, duration of collection and the coding were different, which precludes their 
integration in the tables).  
A Phase III Clinical Study in pregnant women (VAT00006) to assess the safety and 
immunogenicity of the B.1.351 vaccine in pregnant women during pregnancy and safety in 
post-partum including breast-feeding period, if applicable is also planned.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SIV: POPULATIONS NOT STUDIED 
IN CLINICAL TRIALS  
SIV.1  EXCLUSION CRITERIA IN PIVOTAL CLINICAL STUDIES WITHIN THE 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMME  
In below table important exclusion criteria for the phase III Clinical Study (VAT00002) 
Supplemental Cohort 2 are described. 
Table 21 - Important exclusion criteria in pivotal studies in the development program  
Exclusion criteria 
Reason for 
exclusion 
Rationale 
Is it considered 
to be included 
as missing 
information? 
Known systemic 
hypersensitivity to any of the 
vaccine components, or 
history of a life-threatening 
reaction to a vaccine 
containing any of the same 
substances 
Dementia or any other 
cognitive condition at a stage 
that could interfere with 
following the study 
procedures based on 
Investigator’s judgment 
Self-reported 
thrombocytopenia, 
contraindicating IM 
vaccination based on 
Investigator’s judgment 
Bleeding disorder, or receipt 
of anticoagulants in the past 
21 days preceding inclusion, 
contraindicating IM 
vaccination based on 
Investigator’s judgment 
No 
To avoid potentially 
severe and 
life-threatening 
allergic reactions. 
No 
No 
No 
These conditions 
could interfere with 
the participant’s 
ability to follow study 
procedures (potential 
non-compliance 
consequences). 
On the basis of 
underlying 
thrombocytopenia IM 
vaccination may lead 
to hematoma. 
On the basis of 
underlying bleeding 
disorder or receipt of 
anticoagulants in the 
past 21 days, IM 
vaccination may lead 
to an increased risk 
of bleeding. 
Anaphylactic reaction is considered as 
a potential risk. 
Severe hypersensitivity to any of the 
vaccine components constitutes a 
contraindication for the vaccine.  
This is described in the EU-SmPC 
section 4.3 Contraindications 
and 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions for use. 
Exclusion criterion is related to study 
procedures compliance and not to the 
vaccine itself as safety profile of the 
vaccine is not expected to be different 
in this population when properly 
administered. 
It is common medical practice not to 
administer a product by the IM route in 
patients with underlying severe 
thrombocytopenia. This is described in 
EU-SmPC section 4.4 Special warnings 
and precautions for use. 
It is common medical practice not to 
administer a product by the IM route in 
patients with underlying bleeding 
disorder/receipt of anticoagulants in the 
past 21 days.  
This is described in the EU-SmPC 
section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions for use.

Participants with unstable acute or 
chronic illness were excluded from 
clinical trials as these conditions could 
be considered as an additional risk for 
the participant as a result of clinical trial 
participation.  
Use in frail subjects with unstable health 
conditions and co-morbidities (eg, 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 
[COPD], diabetes, chronic neurological 
disease, cardiovascular disorders) is 
considered as missing information. 
Participants with moderate or severe 
acute illness/infection are usually 
excluded from clinical trials. 
This is only a temporary exclusion 
resulting in postponement of 
vaccination until recovery. 
This is described in the EU-SmPC 
section 4.4 Special warnings and 
precautions for use. 
Interactions with other vaccines is 
considered as missing information. 
This is described in the EU-SmPC 
section 4.5 Interaction with other 
medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction. 
Pregnant and breast-feeding 
women

SIV.2  LIMITATIONS TO DETECT ADVERSE REACTIONS IN CLINICAL TRIAL 
DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES  
Clinical studies are limited in size and in time, therefore, unlikely to detect very rare adverse 
reactions, or adverse reactions with a long-latency. 
B.1.351 Monovalent vaccine data, Booster immunization: 
Mean follow-up after booster vaccination was 144 days at the time of the primary analysis of 
Phase III Clinical Study (VAT00002, Supplemental Cohort 2, Monovalent B.1.351 booster 
group). 
Of note, all subjects completed their visit at Day 28 from VAT00013/COVIBOOST Investigator 
Sponsored Randomized Booster study (Monovalent B.1.351). 
One year follow-up after last vaccination is ongoing.

Limitations to detect uncommon adverse reactions: 
It is acknowledged that Monovalent B.1.351 Booster safety database is limited in size (N = 705), 
however the safety profile observed with the Monovalent B.1.351 Booster is not different from 
the safety profile observed in the larger safety dataset of participants having received Beta-variant 
containing formulations (Monovalent B.1.351 Booster, Bivalent B.1.351/D614 Priming and 
Booster) of the vaccine (N = 7093, also including participants of VAT00008 stage 2). 
Adverse reactions section of the SmPC accurately reflect the totality of safety data available on 
Beta-variant containing vaccines (N = 7093). The safety profile of Monovalent B.1.351 Booster 
was established based on safety data from 705 participants vaccinated with 5 μg Monovalent 
B.1.351 booster formulation (VAT00002 Booster Cohort 2). It was confirmed with the pooled 
dataset, including data from 7798 participants having received vaccine formulations containing 
the same Beta antigen (VAT00008 stage 2; reactogenicity data collected in 3759 participants). 
The lists of adverse reactions were identical regardless of the dataset used (705 or 
3759 participants).  
Monovalent B.1.351 safety database (N = 705) did allow a complete characterization of common 
(≥1/100 to <1/10) and very common (≥1/10) adverse reactions. In particular, all solicited events 
are included in the list of adverse reactions of the SmPC, all of them being common or very 
common. For uncommon (≥1/1000 to <1/100) adverse reactions, Monovalent B.1.351 Booster 
vaccine safety database (N = 705) did not allow a robust characterization. Extended safety 
database analysis including clinical studies with vaccine formulation containing the same Beta 
antigen, resulting in a total of 3759 participants (Monovalent B.1.351 Booster, Bivalent 
B.1.351/D614 Priming and Booster) was thus considered to support the characterization of 
uncommon adverse reactions. Extended safety database of 3759 participants is sufficient to define 
the list of Monovalent B.1.351 uncommon adverse reactions while their frequency needs to be 
confirmed. Based on the extended safety database analysis, no significant impact on Monovalent 
B.1.351 Booster benefit/risk is expected when further characterizing uncommon adverse 
reactions. 
The safety database of Monovalent (B.1.351) vaccine is expended with Monovalent (B.1.351) 
vaccine used as a booster dose as part of the VAT00008 Clinical Study (Open Label Extension): 
all participants will be offered the opportunity to be part of this phase of the study and can 
therefore receive the Monovalent (B.1.351) booster vaccine. This extension will allow a more 
robust estimation of the frequency estimates. 
Supportive data with other formulations 
Mean follow-up after booster vaccination was:  
•  One hundred fifty-two (152) days at the time of the primary analysis of Phase III Clinical 
Study (VAT00002, Supplemental Cohort 1). 
Mean follow-up after primary vaccination was: 
•  Forty-four (44) days at the time of the primary analysis of Phase II Clinical Study 
(VAT00002, Original Cohort). In addition, 365 days at the time of the analysis to support 
initial submission (partially cleaned data).

•  Two hundred twenty-eight (228) days at the time of the primary analysis of 
Phase III Clinical Study (VAT00002, Supplemental Comparator Cohort). 
•  One hundred sixty-five (165) days in both vaccine and placebo groups at the time of the 
primary analysis of Phase III Clinical Study (VAT00008) stage 1. 
•  Eighty-five (85) days in both vaccine and placebo groups at the time of the primary 
analysis of Phase III Clinical Study (VAT00008) stage 2. 
For the Phase III efficacy Clinical Study (VAT00008), the assumed incidence rate of 
COVID-19 cases was based on available epidemiological data in the public domain in Clinical 
Study participating countries (2.25%). This resulted in a planned enrollment number of 
5080 participants in the vaccine group (Monovalent D614 vaccine) in stage 1 which would 
provide 92.1% probability to detect at least one AE with 0.05% rate. In stage 2 a planned 
enrollment number of 6783 participants in vaccine group (Bivalent D614/B.1.351 vaccine), would 
provide 96.6% probability to detect at least one AE with 0.05% rate. A total of 23 141 participants 
in the two different stages were enrolled and randomized with allocation ratio (1:1) into vaccine 
group and placebo group. Owing to the ongoing war in Ukraine, data completeness could not be 
confirmed for the four Ukrainian sites in VAT00008; it was agreed with the Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research that none of the participants from these sites were included in the main 
analyses.1 
One year follow-up after last vaccination is ongoing.

Pregnant and breast-feeding 
women 
Exposure 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 has not yet been studied in pregnant or breast-feeding 
women (this population was excluded from Phase II/III and Phase III Clinical 
Studies). 
Pregnant and breast-feeding women are part of the target population. A Phase III 
Clinical Study in pregnant and breast-feeding women (VAT00006) as well as 
observational studies are planned. 
Animal studies do not indicate any finding that could raise suspicion of a safety 
concern in human. There were no vaccine-related effects on mating performance or 
fertility in female rabbits, or on embryo-fetal (including teratogenicity) and early 
post-natal development of the offspring. 
Few pregnancy exposures were reported in ongoing Clinical Studies. Based on 
these data, no safety concern has been observed in this population. 
1 Due to exclusion of Ukrainian participants, the enrollment number decreased since the last RMP version 
(1.1).

demonstrate that potential benefits outweigh any potential risks for the mother and 
fetus. 
Elderly participants were included in Clinical Studies from Phase II/III to Phase III: 
Refer to [Part II SIII.2] for more detailed exposure data. 
Elderly patients are part of the target population.  
To date, there is no information to suggest that elderly patients are adversely 
affected by CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351), no increased risk of adverse reactions 
has been observed. 
Populations with relevant different ethnic origin are included in Clinical Studies from 
Phase II/III to Phase III: Refer to [Part II SIII.2] for more detailed exposure data. 
Race or ethnic origin did not show any impact on the safety profile. 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 has not been evaluated in participants carrying known and

CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 has not been studied in participants with hepatic impairment, 
renal impairment, cardiovascular impairment, and immunocompromised status or 
with a disease severity different from inclusion criteria in clinical trials. Since 
vaccines are not metabolized by the liver, not eliminated by the kidney, no specific 
safety issue is expected in these populations.  
Participants with stable medical conditions/co-morbidities increasing the risk of 
severe COVID-19 were included in Phase II/III and Phase III Clinical Studies 
(high-risk medical conditions include eg, hepatic disease, chronic kidney disease, 
heart conditions such as heart failure and immunocompromised status). 
B.1.351 Monovalent vaccine data, Booster immunization: 58.9% in 
Cohort 2 Monovalent (B.1.351) belonged to the high-risk medical condition group. 
Supportive data with other formulations:

to demonstrate that potential benefits outweigh any potential risks in this population. 
Frailty has been defined as a physiological syndrome characterized by decreased 
reserve and diminished resistance to stressors, resulting from cumulative decline 
across multiple physiological systems, and causing vulnerability to adverse 
outcomes. 100 Frailty is more common in women than in men, more common with 
age 101 is related to disability and to co-morbidity and self-rated health. 
Frail subjects are part of the target population. 
Elderly subjects and subjects with comorbidities including those at increased risk of 
severe COVID-19 were enrolled in Clinical Studies. Individuals with unstable acute 
or chronic illness were excluded from phase II/III (VAT00002, Original Cohort and 
Supplemental Cohorts) and phase III Clinical Studies (VAT00008). 
Immune function could be impaired in frail subjects. To date, there is no information 
to suggest that these subjects are adversely affected by CoV2 preS dTM-AS03, no 
increased risk of adverse reactions has been observed. 
The use of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) in frail subjects with unstable health 
conditions and co-morbidities (eg, COPD, diabetes, chronic neurological disease, 
cardiovascular disorders) is considered as missing information until sufficient 
evidence, notably in individuals with unstable acute or chronic illness, is available to 
demonstrate that potential benefits outweigh any potential risks in this population. 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 was not studied in subjects with known or suspected 
immunodeficiency, including organ transplant subjects.  
In VAT00002 phase II/III Clinical Study, participants with receipt of solid-organ or 
bone marrow transplants in the past 180 days or receipt of anti-cancer 
chemotherapy in the last 90 days were excluded (only persons living with HIV, stable 
HIV infection determined by participant currently on antiretrovirals with CD4 count 
>200/mm3 could be included).  
In VAT00008 phase III Clinical Study, immunocompromised participants were 
eligible for enrollment (participants with immunocompromised state from solid organ 
transplant or from other causes [blood or bone marrow transplant, immune 
deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of immunosuppressors]). 
In Phase III VAT00008 stage 1 and 2, immunocompromised state was one of the 
high-risk medical conditions as defined in the study protocol. B.1.351 Monovalent

POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES  
Potential for misuse of VidPrevtyn Beta for illegal purposes is considered low as this product is 
not known to have attributes that make it a candidate for intentional overdose, abuse, or illegal 
use, such as known pharmacological addictive effects. There is no evidence that vaccines would 
have the potential to induce drug abuse behaviors. Furthermore, it is a product available only 
through prescription and administered by healthcare professionals (HCPs) and not by 
self-administration.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SVII: IDENTIFIED AND POTENTIAL 
RISKS  
In accordance with EMA’s “([Consideration on core requirements for RMPs of 
COVID-19 vaccines v3.1 {dated 01 September 2022}])” guidance, the below factors were taken 
into consideration for the generation of the safety specifications and are not determined to be 
identified or potential risks. 
The vaccine construct and the formulation: As with most vaccines for active immunization, the 
mechanism of action consists of the induction of immune responses against the antigens contained 
in the vaccine. The antigen of the CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) vaccine is a stabilized prefusion 
trimer of the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein (B.1.351 strain). The coronavirus spike protein is the 
major viral surface glycoprotein and mediates attachment and entry into host cells. The 
spike protein precursor is cleaved to form non-covalently associated subunits, S1 and S2. 102 In 
the case of SARS-CoV-2, the receptor is angiotensin-converting enzyme 2, 103 a membrane-bound 
carboxypeptidase localized to vascular endothelial as well as epithelial surfaces. The magnitude 
and quality of the immune response to the antigen is enhanced through the inclusion 
of AS03 (GlaxoSmithKline’s adjuvant system containing alpha-tocopherol and squalene in an 
oil-in-water emulsion). The adjuvant is anticipated to further enhance the magnitude of 
neutralizing antibody responses and to further induce balanced Th1/Th2 cell responses.

SVII.1.1  Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP  
Not all potential or identified risks for the vaccine met the criteria of important risks for inclusion 
in the list of safety concerns in the RMP. 
Reason(s) for not including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP 
•  Anaphylactic reactions: 
Anaphylactic reactions are considered as a potential risk, not important in alignment with 
Guideline on Good pharmacovigilance practices (GVP) Module V - Risk management systems 
(Rev. 2) (28 March 2017 EMA/838713/2011 Rev 2) and removed from the list of safety concerns. 
•  Potential harm from overdose: 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) will be available in a multidose vial (MDV) presentation for 
10 times 0.5 ml dose. 
Multidose presentation implies the possibility of overdose. As the vaccine is injected by qualified 
medical personnel, situations of overdose should be exceptional. Furthermore, as 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) is a vaccine there is no narrow therapeutic margin or major 
dose-related toxicity expected. 
This specific situation of overdose is mitigated through the information available in particular in 
Instruction for use section (EU-SmPC section 6.6 where Instructions of use are described) and on 
vaccine packaging (vial and carton).  
Overdose will be monitored via routine activities and will be presented in each periodic 
benefit-risk evaluation report (PBRER)/periodic safety update report (PSUR).

•  Potential for medication errors: 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) will be available as two vials: one MDV containing the 
(B.1.351) antigen and second MDV containing adjuvant AS03 to be mixed at time of vaccination. 
This presentation implies the potential for medication errors via mixing error, ie, possibility to 
inject only the antigen or only the adjuvant or using a diluent rather than the supplied adjuvant. 
This would result in insufficient immunogenicity of the vaccine(s) in case of “failure to vaccinate” 
(due to immunization error) leading to lack of anticipated clinical benefit (related to efficacy). 
As the vaccine is injected by qualified medical personnel, medication errors following preparation 
error should be exceptional. Presentation as liquid-liquid product for mixing is well-established 
for vaccines. 
This specific situation of medication errors is mitigated through the information available in 
particular in instruction for use section (EU-SmPC section 6.6 where Instructions of use are 
described) and on packaging (warning on a need to mix the contents of 2 vials is presented on 
each packaging element, including the vials).  
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) will be available with 1 unique posology: 5 μg for booster 
immunization. 
Medication errors will be monitored via routine activities and will be presented in each 
PBRER/PSUR. 
•  Potential for transmission of infectious agents: 
No potential for transmission of infectious agents is anticipated (sterility-controlled manufacturing 
process and strict recommendations regarding the use once the vial is opened). 
•  Potential for off-label use: 
This potential for off-label use is mainly concerning the potential use of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
(B.1.351) in another age group (eg, children) that is not indicated or use in special populations. 
This specific situation of off-label use mitigated through the information available in EU-SmPC 
(section 4.1 for age indication). 
Off-label use will be monitored via routine activities and will be presented in each PBRER/PSUR. 
•  Effect on fertility: 
Developmental and reproductive toxicity study conducted in rabbits do not indicate direct or 
indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. Available information is provided in 
EU-SmPC (section 4.6 fertility, pregnancy and lactation). 
•  Pediatric safety issues: 
The safety of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 has not been yet established in pediatric population. 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) is indicated for 18 years and above (Please refer to off-label 
use).  
Based on interim analysis results from Phase III Clinical Study (VAT00008) stage 1 and 
stage 2 and from Phase II/III Clinical Study (VAT00002) Supplemental Cohorts, a Clinical Study 
in pediatric population is being planned. A PIP has been agreed with the EMA and FDA. 99

•  Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the 
disease prevented):  
Syncope (fainting) and other anxiety-related reactions can occur following, or even before, any 
vaccination as a psychogenic or vasovagal response to the needle injection.  
Injection site reactions may include injection site pain, injection site erythema, injection site 
swelling, injection site pruritus, injection site bruising, injection site warmth, upper limb edema, 
and, possibly, the extensive swelling of the vaccinated limb. 
Systemic reactions may include fever, headache, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, chills, fatigue, 
nausea, diarrhea and lymphadenopathy as separate events or a combination of events. 
Aligned with EMA’s “([Consideration on core requirements for RMPs of 
COVID-19 vaccines v3.1 {dated 01 September 2022}])”, 104 CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) 
reactogenicity profile is presented below. The reactogenicity profile does not impact the overall 
safety profile of the vaccine, has minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of 
the disease prevented) and is not proposed to be included in the list of safety concerns. 
Reactogenicity: Clinical impact on the safety profile is assessed as minimal in relation to the 
severity of the disease prevented. 
B.1.351 Monovalent vaccine data, Booster immunization: 
•  VAT00002 Phase III Supplemental Cohort 2:  
The majority of solicited reactions were of short duration (1 to 3 days after study vaccination), 
were of mild to moderate intensity and did not require medical intervention. Solicited reactions 
were reported less frequently in the ≥60 years of age group compared to the 18-59 years of age 
group. Overall, a low frequency of grade 3 solicited injection site or systemic reactions (less than 
10% of participants experienced any grade 3 solicited reaction for both booster groups, blinded 
data) was observed. Injection site pain was the most frequently reported injection site reaction 
overall and the most frequently reported grade 3 intensity injection site reaction. Headache, 
myalgia, and malaise were the most frequently reported solicited systemic reactions of any grade. 
Malaise was the most frequently reported grade 3 solicited systemic reaction. 
•  Supportive data from VAT00013: 
The reactogenicity profiles of the three booster vaccines utilized in the study 
(D614G + AS03 formulation, B.1.351 + AS03 formulation, and Pfizer–BioNTech BTN162b2) 105 
was similar as the one observed in VAT00002 Cohort 2 Clinical Study.  
Supportive data with other formulations: 
Overall, a similar reactogenicity was seen between the Monovalent and Bivalent groups. 
•  Primary immunization 
-  VAT00002 Phase II (Original Cohort, primary series): 
From VAT00002 Phase II D1-D43 interim clinical study report (CSR), most of the solicited 
reactions were of grade 1 and grade 2 intensity. A higher frequency of solicited reactions was 
reported after the second injection than after the first injection, with comparable values across 
dose groups (5, 10 and 15 µg). The majority of solicited reactions occurred between D01 and D04

and resolved without intervention. Grade 3 solicited reactions occurred in 20.4% of all 
participants, with comparable values across dose groups. The proportion of participants reporting 
at least one Grade 3 solicited reaction was higher in the 18 to 59 years age group (27.3%) 
compared to the ≥60 years age group (13.6%). No grade 3 solicited reactions were considered as a 
SAE or a MAAE and all resolved. 
Injection site pain was the most frequently reported injection site reaction of any intensity and of 
grade 3 intensity in all treatment groups. Grade 3 injection site reactions were overall reported 
with a low frequency and increased following the second injection. The proportion of participants 
reporting solicited systemic reactions of any grade were highest for malaise, myalgia, and 
headache in all treatment groups. 98 
Increase of the active substance quantity did not impact the reactogenicity as the reactogenicity 
was similar across treatment groups. 
-  VAT00002 Phase III Supplemental Comparator Group: 
In the Comparator Group (aged 18 to 55 years only), solicited reactions were frequent with similar 
frequency following first injection and second injection, but tended to be transient and 
self-limited. The frequency of grade 3 solicited reactions increased between first injection (13.9%) 
and second injection (22.6%). 
Solicited injection site reactions were reported with similar frequency following first injection and 
second injection. For solicited systemic reactions, frequency increased between first injection and 
second injection. The frequency of grade 3 reactions increased between first injection and second 
injection for both solicited injection site reactions (Post-dose 1: 3.9%, Post-dose 2: 10.7%) and 
solicited systemic reactions (Post-dose 1: 12.3%, Post-dose 2: 20.2%). 
Injection site pain was the most frequently reported injection site reaction overall and the most 
frequently reported grade 3 intensity injection site. Headache, myalgia, and malaise were the most 
frequently reported solicited systemic reactions of any grade. Headache was the most frequently 
reported grade 3 solicited systemic reaction. 
The safety data was consistent with and further supports the safety profile established with the 
primary series formulation seen in the VAT00002 Original Phase II Cohort. 
-  VAT00008 Phase III Stage 1:  
Overall, lower frequencies of solicited reactions were observed after the second injection 
compared to after the first injection, and similar frequencies were observed in the older age group 
(≥60 years) compared to the younger age group (18 to 59 years of age). Intensities of solicited 
reactions were similar after both injections and in both age groups (18 to 59 years of age and 
≥60 years). Reactogenicity was higher in the vaccine group than in the placebo group, as observed 
with other vaccines. Grade 3 solicited reactions occurred in 6.1% in the vaccine group and 
2.9% in the placebo group. With regards to the age groups, grade 3 solicited reactions occurred in 
a similar proportion in the younger age group (18 to 59 years: 6.2% in the vaccine group) 
compared to the older age group (≥60 years: 5.4% in the vaccine group). The majority of solicited 
reactions were of short duration (1 to 3 days after study vaccination), were of mild to moderate 
intensity and did not require medical intervention. 
Injection site pain was the most frequently reported solicited injection site reaction, in both age 
groups and after the first as well as after the second injection. Headache was the most frequently

reported solicited systemic reaction overall and in the younger age group (18 to 59 years of age), 
myalgia is most frequently reported in the older age group (≥60 years). In the overall population 
(irrespective of age group) and after any injection, headache, myalgia and malaise were the most 
frequently reported solicited systemic reactions. Overall, a low frequency of grade 3 solicited 
injection site or systemic reactions (below 10% in the vaccine group) was observed, applicable to 
both the 18 to 59 years of age and the ≥60 years age group. Grade 3 fever was reported in a low 
percentage of the participants, below 2% in the vaccine group (applicable to both the 
18 to 59 years of age and the ≥60 years age group). The majority of reactions was short-lasting 
(up to 3 days). 
Frequencies and intensities of solicited reactions (injection site and systemic reactions) were 
lower in both stage 1 and stage 2 of VAT00008 phase III study compared to the VAT00002 
phase II (Original Cohort, primary Series) and Phase III (Supplemental Comparator Cohort). This 
can likely be explained by the difference in study design (phase III study is placebo-controlled, 
whereas in the phase II/III study all participants received an antigen dose), by difference in 
participating countries, enrollment at different time periods during the pandemic and by an 
influence of serostatus at baseline: In VAT00008 stage 1 and also in stage 2, a higher 
reactogenicity was observed in participants naive (with regard to SARS-CoV-2 infection) at 
baseline compared to non-naive participants at baseline. As more non-naive participants were 
enrolled into VAT000008 phase III study than in the previous VAT00002 phase II study, this 
contributed also to the difference in reactogenicity observed. 
-  VAT00008 Phase III Stage 2:  
Overall, an acceptable reactogenicity profile was observed in Stage 2 (Bivalent D614 + B.1.351 
versus Placebo). Slightly lower frequencies of solicited reactions were observed after the second 
injection compared to after the first injection. The frequencies of solicited reactions (injection site 
and systemic) were similar in both age groups (18-59 years and ≥60 years) and after both 
injections. When looking at the reactogenicity by age group and comparing the 2 injections, a 
comparable reactogenicity after the first and second injection was observed in the younger age 
group (18-59 years), whereas in the older age group ≥60 years a slightly lower systemic 
reactogenicity was seen after the second injection. 
The majority of solicited reactions were of short duration (1 to 3 days after study vaccination), 
were of mild to moderate intensity and did not require medical intervention. 
Injection site pain was the most frequently reported solicited injection site reaction, in both age 
groups and after the first as well as after the second injection. Headache was the most frequently 
reported solicited systemic reaction overall, after both injections and in both age groups. Overall, 
a low frequency of grade 3 solicited injection site or systemic reactions (below 10%) was 
observed, applicable to both the 18 to 59 years of age group and the ≥60 years age group. 
Grade 3 fever was reported in a low percentage of the participants (below 2%). 
•  Booster immunization 
-  VAT00002 Phase III Supplemental Cohort 1 (Protein primed group): 
Overall, solicited reactions were frequent, but transient and mainly mild to moderate. The 
percentage of participants who experienced at least one solicited reaction was comparable across 
all priming groups. Participants aged ≥60 years reported solicited reactions less frequently than 
participants aged 18 to 59 years. Grade 3 solicited reactions were reported in 8.0% of booster

reactions occurred less frequently in the older age group (≥60 years: 5.3% across all booster 
groups) compared to the younger age group (18 to 59 years: 9.2% across all booster groups). 
Injection site pain is the most frequently reported solicited injection site reaction across all 
priming groups and in both age groups. Headache was the most frequently reported solicited 
systemic reaction overall and in the younger age group (18 to 59 years of age), myalgia is the 
most frequently reported in the older age group (≥60 years). Overall, a low frequency of 
grade 3 solicited injection site or systemic reactions (2.5% for injection site and 6.6% for systemic 
reactions across all priming groups) was observed, applicable to both the 18 to 59 years of age and 
the ≥60 years age groups. 
Adverse Event of Special Interests (AESIs) 
For clinical development, AESIs were considered for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) according 
to Brighton Collaboration (Safety Platform for Emergency Vaccines [SPEAC]), 106 vACCine 
covid-19 monitoring readinESS (ACCESS) protocol, 107 US CDC (preliminary list of AESI for 
Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System [VAERS] surveillance), 108 WHO and FDA 
Guidance’s. 109,110 and also safety data from other manufacturers including from 
COVID-19 vaccine platforms and selected as appropriate. 111,112,113,114 
No safety concern was raised from Clinical Development including on AESIs.  
For postmarketing surveillance, list of AESIs is adapted from ACCESS project list 107 available in 
[Annex 7.2], Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC), 106 US CDC (preliminary list of AESI for VAERS

Studies and also safety data from other manufacturers including from COVID-19 vaccine 
platforms and selected as appropriate. 111,112,113,114 
These AESIs are taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities. 
Observed/Expected analysis will be conducted as feasible. The list is considered dynamic and 
may be incremented following the evolving safety profile of the vaccine. 
SVII.1.2  Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the

There are no important identified risks for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) at EU-RMP DLP 
based on the B.1.351 Monovalent vaccine Clinical Study interim results (VAT00002 Phase III 
Supplemental Cohort 2 and VAT00013), Supportive data from other CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
formulations Clinical Study interim results extensive postmarketing experience with the 
manufacturing platform 115 and with the use of AS03 adjuvant. 116  
The important potential risks for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) are the following:

Respiratory Disease (VAERD)  
Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease (VAED) including Vaccine-Associated Enhanced 
Respiratory Disease (VAERD) 
Scientific evidence that has led 
to the inclusion 
Risk-benefit impact 
A theoretical concern with coronavirus vaccines is VAED. 117,118,119,120 This is 
the potential (hypothetical) increased disease severity in naïve vaccinees upon 
exposure to wild-type virus. 120,121 
This disease enhancement of viral infection is also not fully understood. Mostly in 
the context of non-clinical beta coronavirus infections, various factors have been 
suggested as potentially contributing to the phenomenon. These include the 
epitope targeted, the method of delivery of the antigen, the magnitude of the 
immune responses, the balance between binding and functional antibodies, the 
elicitation of antibodies with functional characteristics such as binding to particular 
Fc receptors, and the nature of the Th cell response. 96,122,123 Animal models of 
SARS-CoV-2 infection have not shown evidence of VAED disease after 
immunization. 94 Available data for other COVID-19 vaccines from different 
platforms do not indicate a risk of vaccine enhanced disease. 94,124,125,126 
However, considering limited long-term safety data and in the absence of 
effectiveness data, the available evidence is not yet sufficient to fully rule out VAED 
including VAERD as a safety concern. Thus, it remains an important potential risk. 
At this time, VAED including VAERD is a theoretical (hypothetical) concern without 
any evidence in humans. Therefore, there is currently no impact on the risk-benefit 
balance. 
Participants of ongoing Clinical Studies are followed up on any COVID-19 outcome 
(active and passive surveillances). 
No evidence of VAED including VAERD was found based on review of available 
data from Clinical Studies. 
Of note, in D614 containing vaccines (Monovalent) formulation and specifically in 
VAT00008 stage 1, an increased number of Omicron symptomatic 
COVID-19 cases in the naive vaccine group compared to the naive placebo group 
was observed. When scrutinizing this observation, there was no increase in severe 
outcomes, hospitalization, or mortality in the naive vaccinees. The clinical 
presentation (intensity of symptoms as measured in 3 intensity grades, number of 
symptoms per Omicron case and the duration of symptoms) was similar in the 
naive vaccine and placebo groups. No evidence of an increased viral load (naive 
vaccinees versus naive placebo recipients) was found. Most likely explanation for 
the observation is a lack of efficacy of the Monovalent D614 formulation against 
Omicron (lower level of neutralizing antibodies for this variant, additionally a long 
period between administration of the 2 doses of the study vaccine in 
VAT00008 stage 1 and the start of the Omicron wave (approximately 5 months 
after study start). In VAT00008 stage 2, no increased number of Omicron cases in 
the vaccine group were reported as compared to the placebo group. This was not 
seen neither in Booster formulations. 
In addition, VAED including VAERD might not apply to booster vaccine if referring 
to Brighton definition (VAED including VAERD risk would concern only 
SARS-CoV-2 seronegative individuals or individuals with unknown serostatus and 
no previous COVID-19 infection). 120 
Any change in the available evidence (risk re-evaluation as per incidence and 
severity), could negatively impact the benefit/risk assessment for the concerned 
population.

Myocarditis and Pericarditis  
Myocarditis and Pericarditis  
Scientific evidence that has 
led to the inclusion 
Risk-benefit impact 
Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following vaccination with mRNA 
COVID-19 vaccines, mainly in males under the age of 40 years within 14 days after a 
second dose. However, cases have also been reported in older males, in females, 
and following other doses. There are limited data on the risk of myocarditis following 
third and subsequent booster doses. However, the risk after the third dose seems to 
be lower than following the second dose. 127 
The observed risk is highest in males 12 to 17 years of age. While some cases 
required intensive care support, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that 
symptoms resolve in most individuals with conservative management. Information is 
not yet available about potential long-term sequelae. 128,129 
The risk of myocarditis is greater after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after COVID-19 
vaccination and remains modest after sequential doses including a booster dose of 
Pfizer BioNTech mRNA vaccine. An increased risk of myocarditis is observed at 
1-7 days (IRR 21.08, 95% CI 15.34, 28.96), 8-14 days (IRR 11.29, 95% CI 7.70, 
16.57), 15-21 days (IRR 5.36, 95% CI 3.24, 8.89) and 21-28 days (IRR 3.08, 
95% CI 1.65, 5.75) following a positive test. 130 
Myocarditis and pericarditis events have also been detected in clinical studies and 
post-authorization surveillance of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, which is manufactured 
using a protein/adjuvant platform and a different adjuvant system than the 
CoV2 preS dTM vaccine. 131 
Considering limited safety data, the available evidence is not yet fully sufficient to rule 
out myocarditis and pericarditis as a safety concern. Thus, it is added as an important 
potential risk. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis are events which may be serious or non-serious and are 
generally mild but may be potentially life-threatening. Most vaccine-associated 
myocarditis events have been mild and self-limiting. 130 Balanced with the risk of 
death and illness (including myocarditis) seen with COVID-19 itself, the impact on the 
risk-benefit balance of the vaccine is considered as minimal. 132

Developmental and reproductive toxicology results do not indicate any findings 
that could raise suspicion of a safety concern in human. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on mating performance or fertility in female rabbits, or on 
embryo-fetal (including teratogenicity) and early post-natal development of the 
offspring. 
Few pregnancy exposures were reported in ongoing Clinical Studies. Based on 
these data, no safety concern has been observed in this population. 
A Phase III study in pregnant and breast-feeding women (VAT00006) as well as 
observational studies are planned. 
In general, it is recognized that the anticipated risk and consequence of missing 
information in pregnant and breast-feeding women is low and only considered for 
some live attenuated vaccines. 133

Important potential risk 
Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease (VAED) including 
Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Respiratory Disease (VAERD) 
Potential mechanism 
This potential risk has not been described with any SARS-CoV-2 vaccine from any 
other late phase Clinical Studies nor in animal models with SARS-CoV-2 infection. 
Historically, cellular immunopathology associated to either Th2 or inflammatory T cell 
responses has been observed after viral challenge in some animal models 
administered SARS-CoV-1 (murine, ferret and non-human primate models) or 
MERS-CoV (mice model) early-stage vaccine candidates. 117,118 No similar 
observations were reported for any of the SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, in animal models 
or in humans.  
This potential risk has been included based on these animal data with these related 
beta coronaviruses. Historically, disease enhancement in vaccinated children 
following infection with natural virus has been observed with an inactivated 
respiratory syncytial virus vaccine. 135 Vaccine-associated disease enhancement in 
humans has been described for two investigational formalin inactivated vaccines; 
against Respiratory Syncytial Virus and measles, and one licensed vaccine, the 
tetravalent live attenuated dengue vaccine. 106,117  
Two different mechanisms have been identified to trigger disease enhancement. 
•  Antibody Dependent Enhancement is the result of vaccine-elicited antibodies that 
do not effectively neutralize the virus because of low affinity, wrong specificity, or 
inadequate concentration. Virus-antibody complexes can gain entry to cells via 
Fc-receptor-mediated uptake and lead to a more severe disease.

Characterization of the risk 
•  A second mechanism involves triggering of allergic inflammation, characterized 
by Th2 biased immune response over Th1. 117,119 
The molecular mechanism for this phenomenon, sometimes termed ADE, VAERD, 
or Immune Enhancement of viral infection, is also not fully understood. In the context 
of coronavirus infections, various factors have been suggested as potentially 
contributing to the phenomenon. These include the epitope targeted, the method of 
delivery of the antigen, the magnitude of the immune responses, the balance 
between binding and functional antibodies, the elicitation of antibodies with functional 
characteristics such as binding to particular Fc receptors, and the nature of the 
Th cell response. 96,122,123,117 
A theoretical concern with coronavirus vaccines is VAED. 117,118,119,120 This is the 
potential (hypothetical) increased disease severity in naive vaccinees 120 upon 
exposure to wild-type virus. 121  
This disease enhancement of viral infection is also not fully understood. Mostly in the 
context of non-clinical beta coronavirus infections, various factors have been 
suggested as potentially contributing to the phenomenon. These include the epitope 
targeted, the method of delivery of the antigen, the magnitude of the immune 
responses, the balance between binding and functional antibodies, the elicitation of 
antibodies with functional characteristics such as binding to particular Fc receptors, 
and the nature of the Th cell response. 96,122,123 Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 
infection have not shown evidence of VAED disease after immunization. 94 Available 
data for other COVID-19 vaccines from different platforms do not indicate a risk of 
vaccine enhanced disease. 94,124,125,126 
However, considering limited long-term safety data and in the absence of 
effectiveness data, the available evidence is not yet fully sufficient to rule out VAED 
including VAERD as a safety concern. Thus, it remains an important potential risk.  
Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease including VAERD is a theoretical safety 
concern based on the currently available information for COVID-19 vaccines.  
Within the Clinical Studies for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351), active surveillance 
(phone calls with the study participants) and passive surveillance (study participants 
instructed to contact the site if the experience COVID-19-like illness symptoms or 
have a positive COVID-19 test from any other source) for COVID-19-like illness was 
implemented. 
For the VAT00008 phase III stage 1 and stage 2 efficacy study, a harm monitoring 
with regards to symptomatic and severe COVID-19 cases was implemented.  
These provisions within the Clinical Studies allow detection of any evidence of VAED 
including VAERD caused by CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351). 
No evidence of VAED including VAERD was found based on review of available data 
from clinical studies. 
•  Of note, in D614 containing vaccines (Monovalent) formulation and specifically in 
VAT00008 stage 1, an increased number of Omicron symptomatic COVID-19 
cases in the naive vaccine group compared to the naive placebo group was 
observed. When scrutinizing this observation, there was no increase in severe 
outcomes, hospitalization, or mortality in the naive vaccinees. The clinical 
presentation (intensity of symptoms as measured in 3 intensity grades, number of 
symptoms per omicron case and the duration of symptoms) was similar in the 
naive vaccine and placebo groups. No evidence of an increased viral load (naive 
vaccinees versus naive placebo recipients) was found. Most likely explanation for

Important potential risk 
Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Disease (VAED) including 
Vaccine-Associated Enhanced Respiratory Disease (VAERD) 
the observation is a lack of efficacy of the Monovalent D614 formulation against 
Omicron (lower level of neutralizing antibodies for this variant, additionally a long 
period between administration of the 2 doses of the study vaccine in VAT00008 
stage 1 and the start of the Omicron wave (approximately 5 months after study 
start). In VAT00008 stage 2, no increased number of Omicron cases in the 
vaccine group were reported as compared to the placebo group. This was not 
seen neither in Booster formulations. 
In addition, VAED including VAERD might not apply to booster vaccine if referring to 
Brighton definition (VAED including VAERD risk would concern only SARS-CoV-2 
seronegative individuals or individuals with unknown serostatus and no previous 
COVID-19 infection). 120 
Individuals with lower neutralizing antibodies titers or those with waning immunity. 
119,120,134 
This risk remains unpredictable and may depend on the immune response of the 
patient. 117,136 Potential risk may be decreased with an efficacious vaccine 
generating an adequate immune response is expected to mitigate this theoretical 
risk. 
Clinical study participants are informed of this theoretical risk during the informed 
consent process. Occurrence of COVID-19 cases and especially severe 
COVID-19 cases are monitored in the Clinical Studies and in postmarketing setting. 
This will allow early detection of any evidence of VAED including VAERD. 
Available data for mRNA COVID-19 vaccines (Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, 
124,125 for an adenovirus-vectored vaccine (Janssen) 126 as well as for a protein 
adjuvanted vaccine 137 do not indicate a risk of vaccine enhanced disease. 
As VAED including VAERD is a theoretical (hypothetical) safety concern there is no 
deleterious impact on the benefit-risk balance anticipated for this product.

Important potential risk  Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
Potential mechanism 
Myocarditis is a rare disease with an estimated annual incidence prior to COVID-19 
vaccine pandemic of 16 per 100 000 persons in the general population. The true 
incidence may be higher, as signs and symptoms vary, and it therefore can be 
challenging to make the diagnosis. Viruses are the primary cause of myocarditis, 
including amongst others adeno- and enteroviruses. Severe acute respiratory 
syndrome coronavirus 2 has been associated with myocarditis as well, and multiple 
cases have been described since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic. 132 
The majority of patients are young, healthy males. 138 Based on systematic review, 
males are notably more likely to develop myocarditis and pericarditis following 
COVID-19 vaccination than females (85% versus 15%). The higher prevalence of this 
condition among males can be explained based on the role played by variations in

Characterization of the risk 
hormone signaling. Testosterone has the ability to suppress anti-inflammatory 
immune cells while promoting a more aggressive Th 1 cell immunological response. 
Estrogen, on the other hand, inhibits pro-inflammatory T cells, resulting in a reduction 
in cell-mediated immune responses. However, further research is required to explore 
the exact phenomenon. 139 
Several mechanisms have been hypothesised to account for COVID-19 mRNA 
vaccine associated myocarditis including autoimmunity triggered by molecular 
mimicry, 138,139 immune-mediated pathology, 130 pro-inflammatory cascade. 140 
Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following vaccination with mRNA 
COVID-19 vaccines, mainly in males under the age of 40 years within 14 days after a 
second dose. However, cases have also been reported in older males, in females, 
and following other doses. There are limited data on the risk of myocarditis following 
third and subsequent booster doses. However, the risk after the third dose seems to 
be lower than following the second dose. 127 
The observed risk is highest in males 12 to 17 years of age. While some cases 
required intensive care support, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that 
symptoms resolve in most individuals with conservative management. Information is 
not yet available about potential long-term sequelae. 128,129 
The risk of myocarditis is greater after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after 
COVID-19 vaccination and remains modest after sequential doses including a 
booster dose of Pfizer BioNTech mRNA vaccine. An increased risk of myocarditis is 
observed at 1-7 days (IRR 21.08, 95% CI 15.34, 28.96), 8-14 days (IRR 11.29, 
95% CI 7.70, 16.57), 15-21 days (IRR 5.36, 95% CI 3.24, 8.89) and 21-28 days 
(IRR 3.08, 95% CI 1.65, 5.75) following a positive test. 130 
Myocarditis and pericarditis events have also been detected in clinical studies and 
post-authorization surveillance of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, which is 
manufactured using a protein/adjuvant platform and a different adjuvant system than 
the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine. 131 
Considering limited safety data, the available evidence is not yet fully sufficient to rule 
out myocarditis and pericarditis as a safety concern. Thus, it is added as an important 
potential risk. 
No case of myocarditis and pericarditis has been observed in ongoing clinical studies 
with CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) vaccine. However, based on potential risk from other 
COVID-19 vaccines, participants of ongoing clinical studies with CoV2 preS dTM 
(B.1.351) vaccine are advised to seek immediate medical attention and notify study 
site staff if symptoms compatible with myocarditis and pericarditis occur following 
vaccination. Participants with events of myocarditis and pericarditis will be 
discontinued from further vaccination and followed for subsequent visits as per the 
protocol for safety, immunogenicity, and efficacy endpoints. 
No postmarketing data are yet available with CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351) vaccine. 
The most important published cohort studies to date demonstrate that myocarditis is 
a very rare side effect after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination, with an incidence of 
approximately 1-4 cases per 100 000 vaccinated persons. 132 
The risk of myocarditis is greater after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after COVID-19 
vaccination and remains modest after sequential doses including a booster dose of 
Pfizer BioNTech mRNA vaccine. An increased risk of myocarditis is observed at 
1-7 days (IRR 21.08, 95% CI 15.34, 28.96), 8-14 days (IRR 11.29, 95% CI 7.70,

required intensive care support, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that 
symptoms resolve in most individuals with conservative management. Information is 
not yet available about potential long-term sequelae. 128,129 
Myocarditis and pericarditis events have also been detected in clinical studies and 
post-authorization surveillance of the Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, which is 
manufactured using a protein/adjuvant platform and a different adjuvant system than 
the CoV2 preS dTM vaccine. 131 
In the placebo-controlled safety dataset of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine (participants 
12 years of age and older) with 30 058 subjects receiving active vaccine and 
19 892 subjects receiving placebo, two cases of myocarditis were reported following 
exposure to Novavax COVID-19 vaccine and one case was reported following 
exposure to placebo. In the post-crossover phase of studies, three cases of 
myocarditis were reported. The Sponsor assessed the causality as not related for the 
five cases occurring after exposure to COVID-19 vaccine with all cases attributed to 
alternative etiologies, including reasonable infectious and/or non-infectious causes. 
There were no cases of myocarditis and pericarditis assessed as related by the 
Sponsor. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Adolescent and young adult males following the second dose of vaccine may be at 
higher risk. 138,139 
Preventability 
As the mechanism is not fully understood, preventative measures cannot be defined 
at this time. 
Impact on the benefit-risk 
balance of the product 
Balanced with the risk of death and illness seen with COVID-19 itself, the vaccine 
has a favorable risk-benefit balance. 
Public health impact 
Myocarditis and pericarditis are events which may be serious or non-serious and are 
generally mild but may be potentially life-threatening. Most vaccine-associated 
myocarditis events have been mild and self-limiting. 130 Balanced with the risk of 
death and illness (including myocarditis) seen with COVID-19 itself, the impact on the 
risk-benefit balance of the vaccine is considered as minimal. 132

A DART study has been conducted in rabbits. Results do not indicate any findings 
that could raise suspicion of a safety concern in human. There were no 
vaccine-related effects on mating performance or fertility in female rabbits, or on 
embryo-fetal (including teratogenicity) and early post-natal development of the 
offspring. 
From ongoing Clinical Studies (VAT00002 and VAT00008) and due to exclusion 
criteria, only limited number of pregnancy exposures were reported. No safety 
concern was identified. 
It is not yet known whether CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) could cause any fetal 
harm when administered to a pregnant woman or if any detrimental effects could 
occur when administered in breast-feeding women. 
Pregnant women are part of the clinical development plan (VAT00006 safety and 
immunogenicity Clinical Study in pregnant women during pregnancy and safety in 
post-partum including breast-feeding period, if applicable). 
In general, it is recognized that the anticipated risk and consequence of 
vaccination in pregnant and breast-feeding women is low and only considered for 
some live attenuated vaccines. 133 
Preliminary findings in pregnant persons who received mRNA COVID-19 vaccines

Individuals with co-morbidities 134 or high risk conditions are considered to be 
associated with an increased risk of severe COVID-19 (cancer, chronic kidney 
disease, COPD, obesity (body mass index of 30 or higher), heart conditions such 
as heart failure, coronary artery disease or cardiomyopathies, sickle cell disease, 
thalassemia, type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus, moderate-to-severe asthma, 
cerebrovascular disease, cystic fibrosis, hypertension/high blood pressure, 
neurologic conditions, hepatic disease, pulmonary fibrosis and smoking). In 
addition, individuals with immunocompromised state from solid organ transplant, 
immunocompromised state from other causes (blood or bone marrow transplant, 
immune deficiencies, HIV, use of corticosteroids, or use of immunosuppressors) 
are planned to be enrolled in phase III Clinical Study (VAT00008). From 
VAT00008 and VAT00002, no safety concern for the study vaccine was identified 
when comparing the safety profile in participants with high-risk medical condition 
(as defined in the study protocol) with participants without high-risk medical 
condition group. 
Individuals with unstable acute or chronic illness are part of the exclusion criteria 
in the Clinical Studies. 
The vaccine has been studied in participants with stable chronic diseases (eg, 
patients with hepatic impairment and patients with cardiovascular impairment), 
however it has not been studied in frail participants with severe co-morbidities that 
may compromise immune function due to the condition or treatment of the 
condition. This is not a safety risk per se outside of a potential decrease of efficacy 
in case of severe impairment of immune function.

POST-AUTHORIZATION SAFETY STUDIES)  
III.1 
ROUTINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES  
The safety profile of CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) will be further characterized in real clinical 
conditions of use through postmarketing safety surveillance, encompassing analysis of 
spontaneous reporting of ADRs in periodic safety reports (PSRs), product technical complaints 
(PTCs) relating to AEs, and signal detection. 
Routine pharmacovigilance activities: Standard pharmacovigilance processes in place will be 
followed. Due to special circumstances of COVID-19 pandemic and according to 
“([Consideration on core requirements for RMPs of COVID-19 vaccines v3.1 
{dated 01 September 2022}])”, 104 routine pharmacovigilance activities are enhanced through 
different means. 
The applicant maintains systems and standard practices for routine pharmacovigilance activities to 
collect reports of suspected adverse reactions (including spontaneous reports, reports from 
Clinical Studies, reports of pregnancy/lactation exposures, overdoses and medication errors); 
prepares reports for regulatory authorities (eg, individual case safety reports [ICSRs], PBRER, 
etc,), and maintains continuous reporting of the safety profile of approved products (including 
signal detection, issue evaluation, updating of labeling, and liaison with regulatory authorities). 
The marketing authorization holder (MAH) maintains a pharmacovigilance system master file 
which contains further details of these systems and standard practices. 
Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) Processing: Individual case safety reports will be 
submitted in accordance to GVP Module VI, GVP Product or Population Specific 
Considerations I: Vaccines for prophylaxis against infectious diseases, and the detailed guidance 
on ICSRs in the context of COVID-19 (EMA 2020c). 144 
Adverse Event of Special Interest: 
Adverse Event of Special Interest from Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC), 106 ACCESS, 107 
US CDC, 108 US Guidance for Adjuvanted vaccines (preliminary list of AESI for VAERS 
surveillance, WHO and FDA Guidance’s) 109,110,145 and also safety data from other manufacturers 
including from COVID-19 vaccine platforms 111,112,113,114,146,147 have been considered and selected 
as appropriate. 
The ongoing clinical trial program (from phase I to phase III) includes safety assessment with 
collection of AESIs, defined as AEs, serious or nonserious, that needed to be monitored, 
documented, and managed in a pre-specified manner. 
No specific safety concerns have been identified from the clinical trial program including AESIs. 
For postmarketing surveillance, the list of AESIs has been adapted from ACCESS project list 107 
available in [Annex 7.2], Brighton Collaboration (SPEAC), 106 US CDC, 108 US Guidance for 
Adjuvanted vaccines (preliminary list of AESI for VAERS surveillance, WHO and FDA 
Guidance’s) 109,110,145 safety data from COVID-19 vaccine Clinical Studies and also safety data

from other manufacturers including from COVID-19 vaccine platforms 111,112,113,114,146,147 and 
selected as appropriate. Observed-to-Expected (O/E) analysis will be conducted as feasible. 148 
These AESIs are taken in consideration for routine and additional pharmacovigilance activities as 
appropriate. The list is considered dynamic and may be incremented following the evolving safety 
profile of the vaccine. 
In addition to the Sponsor, an external data and safety monitoring board (DSMB) is responsible 
for monitoring the safety of participants enrolled in the phase III Clinical Study (VAT00008). 
Follow-up (including Targeted Follow-up Questionnaires): Individual Case Safety Reports are 
followed-up to obtain the necessary information for a complete description of the AE and an 
adequate assessment following Standard Operational Procedures. Planned follow-up attempts to 
document ICSRs involving COVID-19 vaccine will follow a risk-based approach with priority 
given to serious unlisted and AESIs cases: for non-valid cases, two attempts will be made for 
serious unlisted cases, and one attempt for the others. For valid cases, two attempts will be made 
for serious unlisted and serious cases with a specific follow-up questionnaire, one attempt will be 
made for serious listed cases, non-serious unlisted cases and non-serious listed cases with a 
specific follow-up questionnaire or considered as medication errors with no AE, and no attempt 
will be made for non-serious listed cases unless neither patient age or age group was collected or 
if case batch number is missing (in these situations, one attempt will be made). Targeted 
Follow-up Questionnaires will be used to document COVID-19 Like illness (in the context of 
vaccination failure/lack of efficacy including occurrence of VAED and VAERD) and to document 
Myocarditis and Pericarditis. [Annex 4] 
For AESIs, additional request for information to the standard follow-up may be conducted on a 
case-by-case basis. 
“Vaccine Associated Enhanced Disease (VAED) including Vaccine Associated Enhanced 
Respiratory Disease (VAERD)”, is a theoretical (hypothetical) safety concern for 
CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 based on available evidence in naive vaccinees 120. A targeted follow-up 
questionnaire of COVID-19 Like illness will be implemented for postmarketing surveillance in 
the context of vaccination failure/lack of efficacy including VAED and VAERD. 
“Myocarditis and Pericarditis”, is a theoretical safety concern for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 based on 
available evidence in Clinical studies with other COVID-19 vaccines. It is thus recommended to 
be included as important potential risk as Myocarditis and pericarditis event were discovered only 
in the widespread use of other COVID-19 vaccines. A targeted follow-up questionnaire of 
Myocarditis and Pericarditis will be implemented for postmarketing surveillance. 
Periodic review of aggregated safety data: According to “([Consideration on core requirements 
for RMPs of COVID-19 vaccines v3.1 {dated 01 September 2022}])” 104 and in addition to 
routine PBRERs/PSURs, the applicant aims to submit Summary Safety Reports containing a 
review of interval safety information during the reporting period, as well as cumulative data. 
Summary Safety Reports will include: 
•  Exposure data stratified by regions, age groups, gender, by dose number (when 
applicable). Exposure data based on administered doses rather than distributed doses will 
be used whenever possible (eg, ECDC Vaccine Tracker). 104,145,149

relevant cases, including O/E analyses as applicable. Observed-to-Expected analyses will 
be performed cumulatively using appropriate background rates (eg, European background 
rates provided by ACCESS available from and 150 US background rates), 151,152 an 
appropriate risk window and when appropriate, should be stratified by age groups, or 
presented per region (eg, if background rates vary), and complemented with a sensitivity 
analysis. If an increased O/E ratio is detected, a further evaluation of the concern should 
be presented. 
•  Fatal reports if any unusual pattern is observed during initial postmarketing use.  
•  Data on medication errors should be included only if a pattern of errors leading to harm is 
identified and/or risk minimization activities are considered warranted (eg, changes to 
the Product Information; DHCP); otherwise, this data should be included with the 
(six monthly) PSURs; 
•  Ongoing and closed signals in the interval including a summary of their evaluation. 
Reviews of signals identified during the period or of safety topics identified by EMA and 
requested to be addressed in the summary safety report. 
•  Changes to reference safety information and actions taken in the interval for safety 
reasons. 
•  Risk/Benefit considerations. 
The submission of summary safety reports complements the submission of 6-monthly 
PBRERs/PSURs. Given the current COVID-19 vaccination patterns, the initiation of summary 
safety reports submission requirement for new vaccines should only be triggered by the start of 
mass vaccination using the product in any EU Member State. The need and periodicity of 
continuing the submission of the summary safety reports will be initiated by the rapporteur and 
re-evaluated based on the available postmarketing evidence for each vaccine, and at the request of 
the MAH, as soon as the safety data enables a decision to be made. 
Literature review: 
Literature monitoring for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) will allow the identification of any 
new potential, safety findings at least on a weekly basis (eg, class AEs or class effects,

epidemiological published studies, publications with Clinical Study data suggesting significant 
changes in incidences of AEs or severity of outcome, or non-clinical data that may correlate to 
risk in humans). 
Global pre-configured and validated product searches are performed on a regular basis against 
two international literature databases (Embase and Medline) within embase.com. 
Literature monitoring for CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 (B.1.351) includes an automated twice a week 
search for published and pre-publication/online first references in 2 commercial database products 
(Embase and Medline). Search criteria include any COVID-19 vaccine product, irrespective of 
manufacturer or vaccine technology, and a report of AE(s) without restriction by seriousness or 
severity. Patient demographics are unrestricted by age group, ethnicity, and pregnancy status. 
Level of evidence (eg, clinical trials, longitudinal observational data, case reports/case series) is 
likewise unrestricted. References retrieved by the above search strategies are reviewed and 
escalated based on reporting of either new safety observations or new aspects of known risks that 
require further assessment. As knowledge of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, COVID-19, and vaccines 
evolves, it is expected that the above search strategies will likewise evolve. Monitoring of other 
sources including non-clinical studies, quality or manufacturing reports is performed through 
periodic reviews part of signal detection processes in place. 
Signal detection and investigations 
Given the specific requirements of COVID-19 vaccines and the need to early identify any 
potential safety issues, routine signal detection activities are supplemented as described below:

Rationale and study objectives: 
COVID-19 vaccines will be used in pregnant populations. Scientific evidence regarding their safety for pregnant women 
and the developing fetus is lacking. 
The objective of C-VIPER is to evaluate the occurrence of obstetric, neonatal, and infant outcomes among women 
vaccinated during pregnancy with VidPrevtyn Beta. Specifically, the C-VIPER will estimate the risk of common obstetric 
outcomes, neonatal outcomes, and infant outcomes among pregnant women exposed to VidPrevtyn Beta from 30 days 
prior to the first day of the LMP to end of pregnancy and their offspring from birth and up to the first 12 months of life 
relative to a matched reference group who received no COVID-19 vaccines during pregnancy. 
Study design: 
International, non-interventional, postmarketing cohort study designed to collect prospective safety data among women 
vaccinated with VidPrevtyn Betaduring pregnancy or within 30 days prior to the first day of the LMP. 
Size: 
At least 200 pregnancies exposed to each branded COVID-19 vaccine during the first trimester and 300 exposed 
thereafter during pregnancy are projected. For each exposed pregnancy, 2 unexposed pregnancies enrolled in the

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT 
PLAN  
Summary of risk management plan for VidPrevtyn Beta (CoV2 preS dTM-AS03 
[B.1.351]) 
This is a summary of the RMP for VidPrevtyn Beta. The RMP details important risks of 
VidPrevtyn Beta, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will be obtained 
about VidPrevtyn Beta’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
VidPrevtyn Beta SmPC and its PL give essential information to HCPs and patients on how 
VidPrevtyn Beta should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for VidPrevtyn Beta should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all 
which is part of the EPAR.  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
VidPrevtyn Beta’s RMP. 
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
I. 
VidPrevtyn Beta is authorized as a booster for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 in 
adults who have previously received an mRNA or adenoviral vector COVID-19 vaccine. 
It contains CoV2 preS dTM (B.1.351 strain) as the active substance and it is given by IM route. 
Further information about the evaluation of VidPrevtyn Beta’s benefits can be found in 
VidPrevtyn Beta’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/vidprevtyn-beta 
II.
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS
Important risks of VidPrevtyn Beta, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about VidPrevtyn Beta’s risks, are outlined in the next 
sections. 
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL
and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;

•  The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or 
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of VidPrevtyn Beta is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing information” outlined in the next section. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information  
Important risks of VidPrevtyn Beta are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of VidPrevtyn Beta. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers 
to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be 
collected (eg, on the long-term use of the vaccine).

Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
A theoretical concern with coronavirus vaccines is VAED. 117,118,119,120 This is the 
potential (hypothetical) increased disease severity in naive vaccinees 120 upon exposure 
to wild-type virus. 121 This disease enhancement of viral infection is also not fully 
understood. Mostly in the context of non-clinical beta coronavirus infections, various 
factors have been suggested as potentially contributing to the phenomenon. These 
include the epitope targeted, the method of delivery of the antigen, the magnitude of the 
immune responses, the balance between binding and functional antibodies, the elicitation 
of antibodies with functional characteristics such as binding to particular Fc receptors, and 
the nature of the Th cell response. 96,122,123 Animal models of SARS-CoV-2 infection 
have not shown evidence of VAED disease after immunization. 94 Available data for other 
COVID-19 vaccines from different platforms do not indicate a risk of vaccine enhanced 
disease. 94,124,125,126 
However, considering limited long-term safety data and in the absence of effectiveness 
data, the available evidence is not yet fully sufficient to rule out VAED including VAERD 
as a safety concern. Thus, it remains an important potential risk.

Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
Myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported following vaccination with mRNA 
COVID-19 vaccines, mainly in males under the age of 40 years within 14 days after a 
second dose. However, cases have also been reported in older males, in females, and 
following other doses. There are limited data on the risk of myocarditis following third and 
subsequent booster doses. However, the risk after the third dose seems to be lower than 
following the second dose. 127

Myocarditis and Pericarditis 
The observed risk is highest in males 12 to 17 years of age. While some cases required 
intensive care support, available data from short-term follow-up suggest that symptoms 
resolve in most individuals with conservative management. Information is not yet 
available about potential long-term sequelae. 128,129 
The risk of myocarditis is greater after SARS-CoV-2 infection than after COVID-19 
vaccination and remains modest after sequential doses including a booster dose of Pfizer 
BioNTech mRNA vaccine. An increased risk of myocarditis is observed at 1-7 days 
(IRR 21.08, 95% CI 15.34, 28.96), 8-14 days (IRR 11.29, 95% CI 7.70, 16.57), 
15-21 days (IRR 5.36, 95% CI 3.24, 8.89) and 21-28 days (IRR 3.08, 95% CI 1.65, 5.75) 
following a positive test. 130 
Myocarditis and pericarditis events have also been detected in clinical studies and 
post-authorization surveillance of Novavax COVID-19 vaccine, which is manufactured 
using a protein/adjuvant platform and a different adjuvant system than the 
CoV2 preS dTM vaccine. 131 
Considering limited safety data, the available evidence is not yet fully sufficient to rule out 
myocarditis and pericarditis as a safety concern. Thus, it is added as an important 
potential risk. 
Risk factors and risk

Adolescent and young adult males following the second dose of vaccine may be at higher 
risk. 138,139

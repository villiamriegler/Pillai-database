SmPC, 
The SmPC is updated based on results of the completed 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 of the SmPC 
based on results of the trial 1199-0337 (InPedILD) in 
paediatric patients with clinically significant 
interstitial lung disease (ILD) and results of a food 
compatibility study conducted during paediatric 
development. The Package leaflet is updated 
accordingly. Consequently, the RMP is updated. 
Minor QRD changes are also introduced in the 
labelling. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary 
of Product Characteristics, labelling and Package 
Labelling and 
paediatric trial InPedILD and results from a food 
PL 
compatibility study performed in paediatric patients. 
A total of 39 patients aged 6 to 17 years were treated in a 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 24 
weeks duration (InPEdILD), followed by open label 
treatment with nintedanib of variable duration. The 
InPedILD trial enrolled children and adolescents aged 6 to 
17 years with clinically significant fibrosing ILD and FVC of 
at least 25% predicted. The most frequent single 
underlying ILD diagnoses were ‘surfactant protein 
deficiency’ (nintedanib: 26.9%, placebo: 38.5%), ‘systemic 
sclerosis’ (nintedanib: 15.4%, placebo: 23.1%), and

Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
The CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of 
studies subject to the agreed Paediatric Investigation 
Plan P/0438/2021 and the results of these studies 
are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the 
Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
‘toxic/radiation/drug-induced pneumonitis’ (nintedanib: 
11.5%, placebo 7.7%). Chronic hypersensitivity 
pneumonitis was reported for 2 patients (nintedanib: 
7.7%).  
The use of standard of care as deemed clinically indicated 
by the treating physician was allowed. There was no 
primary efficacy endpoints in the study. Secondary 
endpoint for lung function was the change in Forced Vital 
Capacity (FVC) % predicted from baseline at week 24 and 
week 52. The adjusted mean change from baseline at week 
24 in FVC % predicted was 0.31 (95% CI  2.36, 2.98) in 
the nintedanib group, and  0.89 (95% CI  4.61, 2.82) in 
the placebo group, with an adjusted mean (95% CI) 
difference in FVC % predicted of 1.21 (95% CI  3.40, 5.81) 
in favour of nintedanib. At week 52, the adjusted mean of 
the difference in change from baseline in FVC % predicted 
between treatment groups was 1.77 (95% CI  4.70, 8.25). 
For the FVC % predicted endpoint and a number of other 
exploratory efficacy endpoints, high variability in response 
to treatment with nintedanib was observed amongst 
paediatric patients. 
Consistent with the safety profile seen in adult patients 
with IPF, other chronic fibrosing ILDs with progressive 
phenotype and SSc-ILD, the most frequently reported 
adverse reactions with nintedanib during placebo-controlled 
period were diarrhoea (38.5%), vomiting (26.9%), nausea 
(19.2%), abdominal pain (19.2%), and headache (11.5%). 
Hepatobiliary disorders reported with nintedanib during 
placebo-controlled period were liver injury (3.8 %) and 
increased liver function test (3.8 %). Due to limited data, it 
is uncertain if the risk for drug-induced liver injury is 
similar in children as compared to adults.

Based on preclinical findings, bone, growth and teeth 
development were monitored as potential risks in the 
paediatric clinical trial. The potential impact on growth and 
tooth development is unknown, thus, an update of the RMP 
was introduced accordingly. 
Long term safety data in paediatric patients are not 
available. There are uncertainties on the potential impact 
on growth, tooth development, puberty, and the risk of 
liver injury.

doses of nintedanib on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 
a combination of ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel 
(Microgynon). Results demonstrated that co-administration 
of nintedanib with oral hormonal contraceptives did not 
alter the pharmacokinetics of oral hormonal contraceptives 
to a relevant extent. In addition, women of childbearing 
potential should be advised to avoid becoming pregnant 
while receiving treatment with Ofev and to use highly 
effective contraceptive methods at initiation of, during and 
at least 3 months after the last dose of Ofev. Nintedanib 
did not relevantly affect the plasma exposure of 
ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. It was also found that 
the efficacy of oral hormonal contraceptives may be 
compromised by vomiting and/or diarrhoea or other 
conditions where the absorption may be affected. Women 
taking oral hormonal contraceptives experiencing these 
conditions should be advised to use an alternative highly 
effective contraceptive measure. Findings on the 
concomitant treatment with oral hormonal contraceptives 
indicated that co-administration of nintedanib had no 
relevant effect on the plasma exposure of ethinylestradiol 
and levonorgestrel.

treatment of nintedanib with pirfenidone was investigated 
in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF). Based 
on these results, there is no evidence of a relevant 
pharmacokinetic drug-drug interaction between nintedanib 
and pirfenidone when administered in combination. 
Additional data from the phase IV INJOURNEY trial with 
Ofev 150 mg twice daily and add-on pirfenidone for 12 
weeks were provided. In view of the limited number of 
patients, this study detected only the most frequent 
adverse events and showed an increase in gastrointestinal 
adverse events and a trend toward increased hepatic 
adverse events. Given the similarity in safety profiles for 
both medicinal products, additive adverse events, including 
gastrointestinal and hepatic adverse events, may be 
expected. The benefit-risk balance of concomitant 
treatment with pirfenidone has not been established.

Cases of drug-induced liver injury have been observed with

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC for Ofev and 
Vargatef to amend the current warning on drug 
induced liver injury based one case of sever liver 
injury with fatal outcome reported for Ofev during 
the post-marketing phase. In addition section 4.4 of 
the Ofev SmPC is updated to include when the 
majority of the hepatic events occurred and on the 
need for hepatic transaminases and bilirubin levels to 
be measured at regular intervals during the first 3 
months of treatment. Section 4.8 of the Vargatef 
SmPC is also updated to include in the summary of 
the safety profile that the safety data is also based 
on post-marketing data. The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the Worksharing 
applicant (WSA) took the opportunity to update the 
contact details of the Maltese local representative 
and to make some corrections to the Bulgarian, 
Estonian, Icelandic, Latvian and Maltese translations 
for Ofev and Bulgarian, Estonian, Latvian and 
Maltese translations for Vargatef.

nintedanib treatment, including severe liver injury with 
fatal outcome. The majority of hepatic events occur within 
the first three months of treatment. Therefore, hepatic 
transaminase and bilirubin levels should be investigated 
before treatment initiation and during the first month of 
treatment with Ofev. Patients should then be monitored at 
regular intervals during the subsequent two months of 
treatment and periodically thereafter, e.g. at each patient 
visit or as clinically indicated. Elevations of liver enzymes 
(ALT, AST, ALKP, gamma-glutamyl-transferase (GGT)) and 
bilirubin were reversible upon dose reduction or 
interruption in the majority of cases.  
If transaminase (AST or ALT) elevations > 3x ULN are 
measured, dose reduction or interruption of the therapy 
with Ofev is recommended and the patient should be 
monitored closely. Once transaminases have returned to 
baseline values, treatment with Ofev may be resumed at 
the full dose (150 mg twice daily) or reintroduced at a 
reduced dose (100 mg twice daily) which subsequently may 
be increased to the full dose. If any liver test elevations are 
associated with clinical signs or symptoms of liver injury, 
e.g. jaundice, treatment with Ofev should be permanently 
discontinued. Alternative causes of the liver enzyme 
elevations should be investigated.

on drug liver injury (DILI) and on the exposure safety 
relationship between nintedanib plasma exposure and liver 
enzyme elevations, the frequency of the adverse drug 
reaction ‘DILI’ was update from ‘not known’ to ‘uncommon’. 
Patients with low body weight (< 65 kg), Asian and female 
patients have a higher risk of elevations of liver enzymes. 
Nintedanib exposure increased linearly with patient age, 
which may also result in a higher risk of developing liver 
enzyme elevations. Close monitoring is recommended in 
patients with these risk factors. The population mean 
exposure to nintedanib was 33 - 50% higher in Chinese, 
Taiwanese, and Indian patients and 16% higher in 
Japanese patients while it was 16 - 22% lower in Koreans 
compared to Caucasians (body weight corrected). Data 
from Black individuals were very limited but in the same 
range as for Caucasians.

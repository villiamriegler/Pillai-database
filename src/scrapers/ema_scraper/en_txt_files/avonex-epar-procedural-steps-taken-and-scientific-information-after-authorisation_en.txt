contraindication ‘initiation of treatment in pregnancy’ 
The SmPC section 4.6 has been updated as follows:  
Pregnancy 
A large amount of data (more than 1000 pregnancy 
outcomes) from registries and post-marketing experience 
indicates no increased risk of major congenital anomalies 
after pre-conception exposure to interferon beta or such 
exposure during the first trimester of pregnancy. However,

Labelling and 
the duration of exposure during the first trimester is 
uncertain, because data were collected when interferon 
beta use was contraindicated during pregnancy, and 
treatment likely interrupted when pregnancy was detected 
and/or confirmed. Experience with exposure during the 
second and third trimester is very limited.  
Based on animal data (see section 5.3), there is a possibly 
increased risk for spontaneous abortion.  The risk of 
spontaneous abortions in pregnant women exposed to 
interferon beta cannot adequately be evaluated based on 
the currently available data, but the data do not suggest an 
increased risk so far. 
If clinically needed, the use of Avonex may be considered 
during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding  
Limited information available on the transfer of interferon 
beta-1a into breast milk, together with the chemical / 
physiological characteristics of interferon beta, suggests 
that levels of interferon beta-1a excreted in human milk are 
negligible. No harmful effects on the breastfed 
newborn/infant are anticipated.  
Avonex can be used during breast-feeding.  
The PL has been updated accordingly.

details of a titration schedule to limit the occurrence of flu-
like symptoms at the initiation of therapy. The titration 
schedule is based on data from a controlled study in 234 
healthy volunteers and a retrospective analysis of a study 
in 47 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS).  The clinical 
data from the study in healthy volunteers show that 
titration of Avonex to full dose in ¼-dose increments over 3 
weeks produces a statistically significant reduction in the 
incidence and severity of flu-like symptoms over 8 weeks 
compared with the no dose titration regimen. The results of

SmPC 
Paediatric Regulation 1901/2006, as amended, the 
CHMP recommended an update of the Product 
Information to reflect results from one completed 
paediatric study for Avonex (Pakdaman et al 2006), 
that was a trial treating 16 Multiple Sclerosis (MS) 
patients under the age of 16, with 15 micrograms IM 
Avonex once per week. In line with the CHMP 
conclusions, the MAH amended the Product 
Information in section 5.1 and further updated 
sections 4.2 and 4.8 in relation to paediatric 
information to be in accordance with the SPC 
guideline. The following was introduced in relevant 
sections of the SPC: 
- The safety and efficacy of Avonex in adolescents 
aged 12 to 16 years have not yet been established. 
Currently available data are described in section 4.8 
and 5.1 but no recommendation on a posology can 
be made. 
Page 27/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- The safety and efficacy of  Avonex in children below 
12 years of age have not yet been established. No 
data are available. 
- Limited published data suggest that the safety 
profile in adolescents from 12 to 16 years of age 
receiving AVONEX 30 micrograms IM once per week 
is similar to that seen in adults. 
- Limited data of the efficacy/safety of AVONEX 
15micrograms IM once per week (n=8) as compared 
to no treatment (n=8) with follow up for 4 years 
showed results in line to those seen in 
adults,although the EDSS scores increased in the 
treated group over the 4 year follow-up thus 
indicating disease progression. No direct comparison 
with the dose currently recommended in adults is 
available.

Labelling and 
the dose of Avonex at the beginning of treatment before 
reaching and maintaining the full dose (30 micrograms) 
was essentially based on literature data, as no new clinical 
data were submitted. Published data available do not 
provide direct comparison on the incidence of flu-like 
symptoms between patients receiving Avonex 30 mcg and 
those receiving titrated doses of other interferon beta at 
the beginning of treatment. However, the review of safety 
data from previously conducted trials with Avonex and 
other interferons beta show a clear trend towards the 
reduction in the incidence of flu-like symptoms when dose 
titration is applied. Beside, titration is common practice 
with interferon beta containing medicinal products indicated 
in the treatment of multiple sclerosis.

the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit/risk balance, the 
and PL 
CHMP was of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy continue to be adequately and sufficiently 
demonstrated. Therefore, the benefit/risk profile of Avonex 
continues to be favourable. The CHMP recommended the 
renewal of the Marketing Authorisation for Avonex with 
unlimited validity.

The MAH submitted a review of published literature 
revised wording to section 4.2 of the SPC and 
sections 2 and 3 of the Package Leaflet regarding the 
use of Avonex in paediatrics, as recommended by 
the CHMP. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
regarding the use of Avonex in paediatric patients aged 12 
to 18, as well as an assessment of the available post 
marketing database for children. No specific studies or data 
collection have been conducted so far by the MAH in the 
paediatric multiple sclerosis population. A few dozens of 
patients, mainly around 12 years old, have been treated 
and followed by their physicians. The treating physicians 
used recommended adult doses and observed a decrease of 
relapse rate with the treatment. Supporting MRI is not 
available. It is not possible to discriminate between the 
possible efficacy in decreasing the relapse rate and

regression to the mean and other factors influencing the 
observed effect. Therefore, efficacy cannot be considered 
specifically demonstrated in children. From a safety point of 
view, there are no signals of specific safety issues in 
paediatric patients although available data are scarce. The 
CHMP recommended that the available information is 
reflected in the product information.

Further to the request of the CHMP, the CHMP 
4.3, 4.4 and 4.6 in order to implement the interferon 
beta class review SPC wording on contraindications 
adopted by the CHMP in April 2006. The Package 
Leaflet has been amended accordingly. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
Pharmacovigilance Working Party (PhVWP) performed a 
class review of all interferons beta authorised in the 
treatment of multiple sclerosis to provide recommendations 
on the need for and the nature of changes to the current 
contraindications in pregnancy, patients with a history of 
severe depressive disorders and/or suicidal ideation and 
patients with epilepsy not adequately controlled by 
treatment. Based on the data submitted by the MAH 
(clinical trial, post-marketing data and literature) and the 
PhVWP recommendations, the CHMP agreed on the 
following changes: 
- 
Removal of the absolute contraindication (section 
4.3) in patients with epilepsy not adequately controlled 
with treatment and revision of section 4.4 of the SPC to 
Page 33/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
indicate that interferon beta should be used with caution in 
patients with epilepsy, particularly if their epilepsy is not 
adequately controlled 
- 
Revision of the contraindication (section 4.3) in 
pregnancy to indicate that initiation of treatment in 
pregnancy is contraindicated but leave some room for 
clinical judgement as to whether a patient who becomes 
pregnant while taking interferon beta should continue or 
stop treatment. Consequential changes were made to 
section 4.6 of the SPC. 
- 
Revision of the contraindication (section 4.3) in 
patients with a history of severe depressive disorders 
and/or suicidal ideation, to indicate that treatment of 
patients with current severe depression and/or suicidal 
ideation is contraindicated. Consequential changes were 
made to section 4.4 of the SPC. 
The Package Leaflet was amended accordingly.

Following the assessment of the 13th PSUR, the MAH 
Package Leaflet 
applied to update sections 4.4 "Special warnings and 
special precautions for use" and 4.8 "Undesirable effects" of 
the SPC.  
In section 4.4, the sentence "In some patients a recurrence 
of elevated serum levels of hepatic enzymes has occurred 
upon Avonex rechallenge.", was considered misleading 
since it might be interpreted that only elevated hepatic 
enzymes recur upon rechallenge, and no other laboratory 
tests (e.g. platelet counts, white blood cells counts). 
In section 4.8, the following ADRs were included: 
"angioneurotic oedema", "injection site bleeding" and a 
description of the most common hypersensitivity reactions 
reported ("angioedema", "dyspnoea", "urticaria", "rash" 
and "pruritic rash"). 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

order to reflect the current safety knowledge about Avonex 
and to reorganise it according to the current SPC guideline.  
The main changes approved in section 4.8 (adverse 
reactions) were the following: 
The section 4.8 was reorganised according to the current 
SPC guideline and its content updated in order to reflect 
the current safety knowledge. Frequencies in the first sub 
section (experience from studies) were recalculated and, as 
recommended by the CHMP, open label studies were used 
for frequencies of ADRs not detected in clinical trials.  
The MAH has reviewed the time of occurrence of hypertonia 
during treatment in studies C94-801, C94-805, C94-812 
and phase III Study NS26321. At the request of the CHMP, 
the information given in the section 4.8 of the SPC was 
modified in order to mention that hypertonia could occur at 
any time in the course of therapy.  
Following assessment of previous PSURs, "rash vesicular", 
"aggravation of psoriasis", "sweating" and "injection site 
necrosis" have been added in the table of adverse reactions 
identified through spontaneous reporting in section 4.8 of 
the revised SPC. Injection site reactions have been further 
detailed as follows: "Injection site reaction, including pain, 
inflammation and very rare cases of abscess or cellulitis 
that may require surgical intervention have been reported"  
The special warnings in the section 4.4 were modified as 
follows: 
Warning on depression:  
The results from study 801 provided information on the 
frequency of symptoms of depression when patients 
Page 38/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
treated with Avonex were followed over a long period (up 
to 5.5 years). This study shows a frequency probably 
higher than expected. The specific warning in section 4.4 
was modified in order to reflect that depression has been 
reported in association with Avonex use and that it may 
occur at any time during treatment.

Since the last annual reassessment, the final report of the 
II and PL 
open label study (C94-801) in patients with MS receiving 
30 mg of AVONEX im to determine safety, antigenicity and 
the effect of neutralising antibody (NAB) on 
pharmacodynamics had been submitted on 30 January 
2003.  
Regarding the immunogenicity of Avonex (antigenicity and 
effect of neutralising antibodies), the data provided was 
considered in line with previous reports, although the 
development of neutralising antibodies was slightly lower 
than stated in the SPC. No changes in the SPC were 
considered needed with regard to the data on the 
appearance of neutralising antibodies as a result of the 
evaluation of final report of study 801.  
Page 40/45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP concluded that this specific obligation was 
considered fulfilled.  
The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
with the specific obligations submitted by the Marketing 
Authorisation Holder and having re-assessed the 
benefit/risk profile of the medicinal product in the approved 
indications, recommended that the marketing authorisation 
should remain under exceptional circumstances since the 
long-term follow-up of the patients entered study C94-805 
(CHAMPS), a 5-year MRI report from this add-on study 
(CHAMPION), had still to be submitted as a Specific Clinical 
Obligation. 
During this annual reassessment and following the 
assessment of the safety data submitted in the C94-801 
study and in the 9th and 10th PSURs, the CHMP considered 
that the MAH should update the SPC and PL and reorganise 
it according to the current SPC guideline.  
It was considered that the MAH should continue to closely 
monitor and review a number of identified safety signals in 
the next PSURs.

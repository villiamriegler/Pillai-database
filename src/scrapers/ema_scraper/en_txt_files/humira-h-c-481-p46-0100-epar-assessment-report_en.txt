2.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Study P10-446 Long term Documentation of the Safety and Efficacy as well as the Effects on 
Work Productivity in Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis treated with HUMIRA® 
(Adalimumab) in Routine Clinical Practice (LOTOS). 
2.2.2.  Clinical study 
The submitted study P10-446 is a non-interventional study (NIS). It was a single-arm, multicenter, 
prospective cohort study.  The goal of this NIS was designed to document long-term data on the 
efficacy and tolerability of HUMIRA® in the treatment of adult patients with moderate to severe 
chronic plaque Ps under conditions of routine care, including data of patient groups that are usually 
excluded from clinical trials (e.g., due to comorbidities, varied concomitant medication). 
Clinical study number and title -please refer to section 2.2.1 
Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
In this NIS, a long-term documentation of treatment with HUMIRA® over 60 months with 12 data 
collection points (visits) or as per amendment over 24 months with 6 visits was performed as planned. 
The documentation was performed by the physician as well as by patients' self-assessment. The 
primary objectives of the NIS were: 
● to explore changes in health-related care utilization data by the evaluation of 
- the number of missed working days 
- the number of visits to doctor's office 
- the number and duration of hospitalizations 
- the self-assessed work ability 
● to explore efficacy for different subgroups by the analysis of 
- changes in the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) 
- the number of patients achieving a PASI 75 response 
● to evaluate safety by 
- the documentation and analysis of serious adverse events and adverse events 
Secondary objectives included: 
● the exploration of changes in quality of life measurements (Dermatology Life Quality Index [DLQI], 
EuroQol-5D [EQ-5D]) 
● the exploration of the influence of the BMI and body weight on efficacy measurements (PASI) 
● the evaluation of physician's assessment of the antipsoriatic treatment with HUMIRA® 
● the evaluation of patients' assessments of the antipsoriatic treatment with HUMIRA® 
● the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of the HUMIRA® treatment for subgroups of patients 
with common concomitant diseases, especially diabetes type I and II, cardiovascular, liver and renal 
insufficiencies, and related concomitant medications. 
The following secondary objectives were additionally included through the amendment of the study 
protocol: 
● Itch Visual Analogue Scale (Itch VAS) 
● Palmoplantar Psoriasis Area Severity Index (pPASI) 
● Reasons for and duration of dose escalation 
● Median drug survival rates of different dosing regimes 
● PASI (mean, min, max) at start of the dose escalation 
● Assessment of Psoriasis Scalp Severity Index (PSSI) 
● Target Nail Psoriasis Severity Index (target-NAPSI) 
In addition, a substudy was conducted: "Long-term Documentation of Risk Factors of Metabolic 
Syndrome and Cardiovascular Disease in Patients with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis Treated 
with HUMIRA® in Routine Clinical Practice (LOTOS Metabolism)": The research question explored in 
this substudy was whether treatment with HUMIRA® altered lipid and glucose metabolism or 
cardiovascular risk factors in patients with psoriasis. The primary objectives were: 
● To explore the effects of HUMIRA® therapy on the parameters of metabolic and cardiovascular risk 
● To explore whether there exists a correlation between therapeutic effectiveness on skin disease and 
changes in the parameters of metabolic and cardiovascular risk 
Study design  
This was a non-interventional single-armed, multicenter, prospective cohort study The observational 
study documentation started with the first application of HUMIRA® and was repeated at Month 3, 6, 
12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 42, 48, 54 and 60.The patients had to be at least 18 years old at the start of the 
investigation and provided written informed consent.  Per the original protocol, the study was ended 
after the overall target size of 850 patients was reached.  Dose escalations that were documented for 
the LOTOS Amendment patients turned out to be less common than anticipated in daily routine care.  
For the LOTOS patients, the first patient was included into the study on 12 November 2007 and the 
last contact/last visit of the last patient was on 28 June 2019; for the LOTOS Amendment patients, 
these were 16 January 2017 and 30 June 2019, respectively. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Overall, 5,205 patients (LOTOS patients:  n = 4,793; LOTOS Amendment patients n = 412) were 
analyzed in the safety analysis set (SAF) and 3,684 patients (LOTOS patients:  n = 3,390; LOTOS 
Amendment patients:  n = 294) in the full analysis set (FAS). All patients were adults >18 years of age 
except one LOTOS Amendment patient who was < 18 years of age.  This single paediatric patient was 
included in the SAF; however, as the start date of treatment with HUMIRA® was prior to baseline date, 
the patient was excluded from the FAS and included as a deviation from the study protocol. 
Baseline data 
In the SAF, the LOTOS patient population was composed of slightly more male patients (62%); the 
LOTOS Amendment patient population was more or less equally distributed (male 52%, female 48%).  
The mean ± standard deviation (SD) age of the LOTOS and LOTOS Amendment patient population was 
47.5 ± 13.11 and 47.1 ± 14.70 years, respectively.  The characteristics of Ps were chronic-stationary 
for most of the patients (LOTOS patients:  86.8%; LOTOS Amendment patients:  81.3%).  The 
duration of disease was > 10 to ≤ 20 years for 31.4% of the LOTOS patients and ≤ 10 years or > 10 to 
≤ 20 years for 31.8% and 31.3% of the LOTOS Amendment patients, respectively. 
Paediatric patient 
Only baseline visit data were documented for this single patient (refer to Table 1 below).

Effectiveness results 
Long-term treatment with HUMIRA® during routine clinical care had a favorable impact on health-
related care utilization and employment-related and clinical outcomes in adult patients with Ps.  
HUMIRA® was shown to be highly effective by both the physician as well as patient measures of 
disease activity in Ps patients remaining on therapy.   
Safety results 
No new safety signals or unexpected trends of treated adults were detected during the 60 (LOTOS 
patients) and 24 (LOTOS Amendment patients) months. 
2.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Only one of the included patients of the LOTOS study and LOTOS Amendment study patients was < 18 
years of age.  As only baseline visit data were documented for this patient and the patient excluded 
from the FAS and included as a deviation from the study protocol, no further conclusion can be drawn 
relating to paediatric effectiveness and safety from this study(ies). 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
No meaningful conclusions of the paediatric population can be made based on these data of the final 
study report for P10-446 as only baseline visit data were documented for one single paediatric patient. 
 Fulfilled:  
No regulatory action required.

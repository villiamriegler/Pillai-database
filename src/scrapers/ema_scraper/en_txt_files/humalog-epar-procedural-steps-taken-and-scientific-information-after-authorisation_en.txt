worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions are 
issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The CD 
is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

of medication error associated with withdrawing insulin from 
B.II.e.5.b: To delete the BASAL presentations: 
EU/1/96/007/010, 029, 037 and 038 for Humalog 
Basal and EU/1/01/195/022, 023, 026 and 027 for 
Liprolog Basal. 
C.I.4: Update of sections 4.2 and 6.6 of the SmPC of 
Humalog/Liprolog in pre-filled pens and cartridges to 
address the PRAC recommendation regarding the 
potential increased risk of medication error associated 
with withdrawing insulin from pre-filled pens and 
cartridges, leading to dysglycaemia. 
In addition, the Worksharing applicant (WSA) took the 
opportunity to combine all SmPCs resulting in four 
SmPCs: 100 units/ml presentations, Mix 25 100 
units/ml presentations, Mix50 100 units/ml 
presentations and 200 units/ml presentations. The 
pre-filled pens and cartridges, leading to dysglycaemia and 
to add the recommendation to only use Lilly insulin cartridges 
in with Lilly reusable pens. 
 In addition, the MAH has included in section 6.6 of the SmPC 
the recommendation that Humalog cartridges are to be used 
with a Lilly reusable insulin pen and should not be used with 
any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has not been 
established with other pens and that Liprolog cartridges are 
to be used with a Lilly reusable insulin pen and should not be 
used with any other reusable pen as the dose accuracy has 
not been established with other pen.  
The Basal presentation has also been deleted from the 
marketing authorisation. 
As a consequence of this application the labelling and 
package leaflet have been updated.

included the recommendation to only use Lilly insulin 
cartridges with Lilly reusable pens. Minor editorial 
changes have been included.  
The Package Leaflet and Labelling are updated 
accordingly.

Review of the safety information from Lilly Safety System 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Further to a review of safety information pertaining to 
the risk of fluid retention and congestive heart failure 
with the use of insulin lispro, section 4.8 of the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) is 
and literature data sources pertaining to the risk of fluid 
retention (including oedema and peripheral oedema) with 
the use of insulin lispro suggests a causal association 
between insulin lispro and the adverse event of oedema. 
Therefore it was proposed to provide information regarding 
oedema in the adverse event sections of the product 
information. Analysis of the patients exposed to insulin lispro

the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-clinical, 
clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
between 1 January 1983 through 31 August 2010 confirmed 
causal association between insulin lispro and the adverse 
event of oedema. Consequently Summary of Product 
Characteristics section 4.8 is updated by adding a warning on 
an increased incidence of oedema. It was agreed not to 
mention frequency as the majority of the reports occur within 
the first weeks of treatment. The Package Leaflet section 4 is

The PhVWP was requested to consider whether the increased

Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Further to a CHMP request based on the 
recommendations from PhVWP, the Product 
Information (Summary of Product Characteristics 
section 4.4 and Package Leaflet section 2) is updated 
by adding a warning on an increased incidence of heart 
failure when pioglitazone is used in combination with 
insulin, especially in patients with predisposing 
factors.  
In addition to the above the MAH took the opportunity 
to update annex IIB "Other conditions" for Liprolog 
with the latest wording as per October 2010 CHMP 
announcment regarding the Pharmacovigilance 
system. 
This application was submitted for a group of 
risk of fluid retention and exacerbation of heart failure with 
the concomitant use of pioglitazone and insulin should apply 
to all centrally authorised insulin products. After the review 
of the available evidence, during its October 2010 meeting 
the PhVWP has concluded this review with a recommendation 
to the CHMP on the need to harmonise the SmPC and PL for 
all insulin products by including appropriate warning. The 
CHMP endorsed this recommendation, and in this context the 
Committee agreed that all centrally authorised insulin 
containing products should include warning on increased 
cardiac failure when pioglitazone is used in combination with 
insulin, especially in patients with predisposing factors in the 
in the section 4.4 of the SmPC and section 2 of the PL.

of the Package Leaflet to add angiotensin II receptor 
blockers in the list of medicinal products that may 
reduce insulin requirements. Details of local 
representatives were updated in the PL. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
January 1983 - 28 February 2005.  
No suspected interaction with an angiotensin II receptor 
blockers (ARB) was reported. However, the review of the 
safety database showed a slight increased frequency of 
hypoglycaemic events in patients receiving an Angiotensin 
Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an ARB as concomitant 
medication, which supports a possible interaction with 
insulin. Although the overall number of reports is lower with 
ARBs than with ACE inhibitors, the reporting rate appears to 
be the same. Although the mechanism of the interaction is 
not well understood, both types of medicinal products share 
the similar endpoint to decrease the effect of angiotensin II 
and thus, both have the potential to increase insulin 
sensitivity. A published clinical study comparing the effects of 
an ACEI and an ARB showed more pronounced effects of the 
ACE inhibitors on endothelial function but similar effects on 
insulin sensitivity (Am J Hypertens. 2005 Feb;18(2 Pt 
1):178-82) and thus support the data from the MAH safety 
database. Therefore section 4.5 of the SPC was updated to 
include ARBs in the list of medicinal products that may 
reduce insulin requirements.

The review of the results of three paediatric studies with 
assessment of the FUM 011 to reinforce dosage 
instructions when using both fast-acting insulins and 
basal insulins for optimal glucose control, in particular 
nocturnal/fasting glucose control. In addition, contact 
details of Bulgarian and Romanian local 
representatives were also included. 
insulin lispro showed that there were no major differences in 
overall safety and efficacy between insulin lispro and human 
regular insulin. However, in two of the studies there were 
differences concerning fasting and nocturnal blood glucose 
concentrations with higher concentrations in patients treated 
with insulin lispro. Therefore, and as recommended by the

CHMP, sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SPC are revised so that all 
information regarding adjustment of insulin doses can be 
found in the same section, and to strengthen that a patient 
also on basal insulin must optimise dosage of both insulins to 
obtain glucose control across the whole day, particularly 
nocturnal/fasting glucose control.

The MAH provided the results of two randomized, open-label, 
Summary of Product Characteristics to add clinical 
efficacy information based on the results of two phase 
IV clinical studies. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics 
crossover studies investigating the efficacy and safety of the 
combination of twice-daily insulin lispro LM plus metformin 
and once-daily insulin glargine plus metformin on overall 
glycaemic control, as measured by % HbA1c. Patients who 
participated in these studies had type 2 diabetes with 
inadequately controlled blood glucose, either on one or more 
oral anti-hyperglycaemic medications only (study IOND, 
N=74), or on one or more oral anti-hyperglycaemic plus one 
daily injection of insulin or a conventional insulin regimen 
consisting of once- or twice-daily NPH insulin (study IOMX, 
N=93). Results showed that twice-daily insulin lispro LM in 
combination with metformin has a greater HbA1c-lowering 
effect than once-daily insulin glargine with metformin, as 
expressed in mean % HbA1c thereafter. The new data were 
reflected in section 5.1 of the SPC, including those obtained

Study population and dosages administered 
In order to collect the data on safety and efficacy of Tasigna for pediatric patients with CML in Japan, a 
central  registration  system  was  adopted  and  all  patients  who  received  Tasigna  from  the  start  of  the 
study (22-Jan-2018) were registered. 
Both  of  the  safety  analysis  population  and  the  efficacy  analysis  population  consist  of  10  patients  (6 
males and 4 females), registered from 8 sites.  By age, 2 patients were < 12 years old, and 8 patients 
were ≥ 12 years old and < 18 years old (age range: 9-17 years). The body weights were 114.9-168.2 
cm and the body weights were 21.5-60.6 kg. 
The data on treatment in the safety analysis population (n = 10) at the end of 1-year observation after 
the start of treatment showed 10, of which 7 patients who had no interruption and the other 3 patients 
in  whom  Tasigna  was  resumed  after  temporary  interruption  due  to  AEs.  In  no  patient  was  treatment

discontinued.  The  doses  of  Tasigna  were  calculated  based  on  body  surface  area  (230  mg/m2  of 
Tasigna bid). 
Summary of safety results 
Of the 10 pediatric patients in this study, six patients (60 %) experienced AEs including: 
myelosuppression,  nausea,  hepatic  function  abnormal,  hyperbilirubinaemia,  liver  disorder,  eczema, 
rash,  myalgia,  alanine  aminotransferase  (ALT) increased,  blood bilirubin  increased  and blood bilirubin 
unconjugated  increased.  All  the  reported  AEs  were  assessed  to  be  causally  related  to  Tasigna  except 
for  nausea  and  rash.  All  reported  AEs  were  grade  1  or  2.  No  grade  3  or  higher  AE  occurred  of 
translated CSR). One AE was reported as serious.  
The single serious case concerned a 14-year-old female who has been hospitalized after experiencing 
hyperbilirubinaemia on day 11 of treatment. T-Bil and D-Bil increased from baseline value of 0.6 mg/dL 
to 3.0 mg/dL and 0.2 mg/dL to 1.0 mg/dL, respectively. Upon URSO treatment values reached T-Bil: 
1.3  mg/dL,  D-Bil:  0.6  mg/dL  at  Day  16  and  Tasigna  was  resumed  at  a  lower  dose  of  300  mg  (BSA-
based  daily  dose  was  600  mg).  On  Day  18,  GLYCYRON  was  started  for  treatment  and  Tasigna  dose 
was  increased  to  450  mg.  On  Day  38,  hyperbilirubinaemia  recurred  (T-Bil:  2.4  mg/dL,  D-Bil:  0.8 
mg/dL).  On  Day  39,  the  daily  dose  of  Tasigna  was  reduced  back  to  300  mg  and  the  event  was 
resolving  at  Day  42  (T-Bil:  1.2  mg/dL,  D-Bil:  not  reported).  The  2  episodes  of  hyperbilirubinaemia

were  both  assessed  to  be  serious  (criteria  ‘hospitalization  [initial  or  prolonged]’,  and  ‘other  serious 
[Important Medical Events)’]. URSO and GLYCYRON, were continued. Details have been provided in the 
submitted dataset.  
No deaths were reported. 
Adverse  Drug  Reactions  (ADRs)  occurred  in  5  patients  (50.00%)  and  included  myelosuppression, 
hepatic 
function  abnormal,  hyperbilirubinaemia, 
liver  disorder,  eczema,  myalgia,  alanine 
aminotransferase  increased,  blood  bilirubin  increased  and  blood  bilirubin  unconjugated  increased.  All 
ADRs occurred in single cases, except blood bilirubin increased in two cases. 
Three other studies with Tasigna included pediatric patients; study CAMN107A2120 (hereafter referred 
to  as  A2120),  study  CAMN107A2203  (hereafter  referred  to  as  A2203),  and  study  CAMN107A1401 
(hereafter  referred  to  as  1401).  Study  A2120  is  a  Phase  I  PK  study  investigating  the  safety,  efficacy 
and PK study of nilotinib in pediatric patients Study A2203 is phase II study in pediatric patients which 
included  a  small  number  of  Japanese  pediatric  patients  (9  patients)  at  the  time  of  approval  in  Japan 
(25-Dec-2017). Thus, a special drug use investigational surveillance was initiated in order to evaluate 
the safety and efficacy of Tasigna administered to Japanese pediatric patients with CML. Study A1401 
is a drug use investigational surveillance in CML and was conducted in Japan from 16 February 2009 to 
18  January  2019.  It  was  initiated  after  approval  of  adult  indication  in  Japan  and  7  pediatric  patients 
with CML-CP (< 18 years) were registered in this study. 
In  Study  A2120,  ADRs  occurred  in  12  patients  (80.0%)  of  the  15  patients  enrolled.  Common  ADRs 
included  ALT  increased  and  rash  (4  patients  each,  26.7%),  followed  by  aspartate  aminotransferase 
(AST)  increased,  blood  bilirubin  increased,  and  hyperbilirubinemia  (3  patients  each,  20%).  In  Study 
A2203,  ADRs  occurred  in  50  patients  (86.2%)  of  the  58  patients  enrolled  (including  9  Japanese 
patients).  Common  ADRs  included  blood  bilirubin  increased  in  18  patients  (31.0%),  ALT  increased  in 
17  patients  (29.3%),  headache  in  16  patients  (27.6%),  AST  increased  in  14  patients  (24.1%), 
hyperbilirubinaemia and rash in 12 patients (20.7%) each, nausea in 9 patients (15.5%), rash maculo-
papular in 8 patients (13.8%), vomiting in 7 patients (12.1%) and alopecia in 6 patients (10.3%). In 
Study  A1401,  7  pediatric  patients  with  CML-CP  (<  18  years)  were  registered,  of  whom  5  patients 
(71.43%)  had  ADRs,  including  rash  in  2  patients  (28.57%),  acne  pustular,  headache,  strabismus, 
hepatic  function  abnormal,  jaundice,  liver  disorder,  dry  skin,  bone  pain,  chest  pain,  blood  creatinine 
phosphokinase increased, electrocardiogram QT prolonged and hepatic enzyme increased in 1 patient 
each (14.29%). 
The AEs that occurred in the present study are in line with the known safety profile of Tasigna. They 
were  observed  also  in  the  global  phase  I  and  II  studies  of  Tasigna  in  pediatric  patients  (A2120  and 
A2203) and in pediatric patients of the Japanese drug use investigational surveillance (A1401). 
In  study  A2203  hyperbilirubinaemia/blood  bilirubin  increase  and  transaminase  elevation  (AST,  ALT) 
were  reported  at  a  higher  frequency  than  in  adult  patients.  The  higher  risk  of  hepatotoxicity  in  the 
pediatric  population  is  already  reflected  in  current  approved  SmPC  and  monitoring  recommendations 
for the liver function (bilirubin and hepatic transaminases levels) are included in sections 4.2 and 4.4 of 
the EU SmPC. 
Summary of efficacy results 
In  study  CAMN107A1402  statuses  of  complete  hematologic  response  (CHR),  complete  cytogenetic 
response (CCyR) and major molecular response (MMR) were assessed at the start of treatment (within 
1 month before the start of treatment), 3 and 6 months and 1 year from the start of treatment with 
Tasigna.

In  newly  diagnosed  patients  (n=5),  at  1  year,  all  5  patients  (100%)  achieved  CHR  and  CCyR  and  3 
patients  (60%)  achieved MMR.  In  Study  A2120,  no  de  novo  patients  were  enrolled.  In  Study  A2203, 
the proportion of patients who achieved CCyR and MMR at Cycle 12 were both 64.0% (16/25 patients) 
in the 25 pediatric patients with de novo CML-CP. 
In  the  patients  with  resistance/intolerance  to  previous  therapy  (n=5),  4  patients,  2  patients  and  2 
patients already achieved CHR, CCyR and MMR at the start of treatment, respectively. At 1 year 100% 
(n=5) achieved CHR, 80% (n=4) achieved CCyR and 80% (n=4) achieved MMR. 
In Study A2120, 10 (90.9%) patients of 11 Ph+ CML patients achieved confirmed CHR and 1 patient 
satisfied CHR, 4 (36.4%) patients achieved CCyR. MMR was achieved in 3 Ph+ CML patients (27.3%). 
In study A2203, in the 33 imatinib- or dasatinib-resistant or intolerant pediatric patients with CML-CP, 
the  proportion  of  patients  who  achieved  MMR  by  Cycle  6  (Week  24)  was  39.4%  (13/33  patients).  In 
Study  A1401,  the  best  response  outcomes  in  the  observation  period,  which  was  specified  as  up  to  3 
years,  were  as  follows:  CHR  100%,  major  CyR  100.0%  (complete  85.71%  [6/7  patients],  partial 
14.29% [1/7)]. 
Acknowledging the small number of patients in these studies with Tasigna, the efficacy results in the 
present study were overall in line with those in the pediatric populations of Study A2120, Study A2203 
and  Study  A1401.  Results  of  the  study  A2203  were  submitted  to  the  Agency  on  25-Feb-2021 
(EMEA/H/C/000798/II/0109)  and  the  Art  46  submissions  for  study  A2120  and  study  A1401  were 
submitted 
to 
the  Agency  on  14-Dec-2015 
(EMA/H/C/798/P46-0050)  and  11-Jul-2019 
(EMA/H/C/000798/P46), respectively. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  MAH  has  provided  results  from  study  CAMN107A1402  conducted  to  investigate  the  safety  and 
efficacy  profile  of  Tasigna  in  clinical  use  for  Japanese  pediatric  patients  with  CML,  in  line  with  the 
approved marketing authorization in Japan.  
The conclusion as provided with the MAH is fully endorsed; one serious AE (hyperbilirubinaemia) was 
reported in a 14-year-old female was reported to be related to Tasigna. No new safety concerns were 
detected  in  the  pediatric  population  treated  with  Tasigna.  The  safety  profile  observed  in  this  study  is 
consistent  with  the  known  and  well  characterized  safety  profile  of  Tasigna  and  in  line  with  the 
information already presented in the approved SmPC. 
 The  benefit  risk  assessment  remains  unchanged  and  no  further  update  of  the  currently  approved 
SmPC is required.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
II, Labelling 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
and PL 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of leflunomide winthrop continues to be adequately 
and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore considered that 
the benefit risk profile of Leflunomide winthrop continues to 
be favourable in the treatment of active rheumatoid 
arthritis as a "disease-modifying antirheumatic drug" 
(DMARD), and active psoriatic arthritis. The CHMP 
recommended the renewal of the Marketing Authorisation 
with unlimited validity.

SmPC and PL  With the development of teriflunomide, the main active 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. 
This worksharing includes 9 type II variations per 
product grouped as follows: 
-Type II variation, C.I.4 : Update of sections 4.3 and 
4.4 of the SmPC contraindicating and including a 
warning on teriflunamide the active metabolite of 
leflunomide; 
-2 Type II variations, C.I.4 : Update of section 4.5 of 
the SmPC for leflunomide related to the study 
reports HWA486/1032/001 (interaction cimetidine)  
and -HWA486/2F0.1 (interaction with methotrexate); 
- 6 Type II variations, C.I.4 : Update of section 4.5 
metabolite of leflumonide, as a drug for the treatment of 
multiple sclerosis, several interaction studies were 
performed according to current standards. This variation 
hamonised the results of the interaction studies of the main 
metabolite with the parent drug leflumonide. Caution and 
intensified monitoring is recommended for combined use of 
leflunomide and a broad range of products since the plasma 
levels may be increased by the concurrent use of 
leflumonide. The benefit/risk balance of leflumonide 
remains positive, considering that interactions could be 
controlled by dose adjustments. Co administration of 
teriflunomide with leflunomide is not recommended, as 
leflunomide is the parent compound of teriflunomide.

of the SmPC for teriflunomide related to the following 
Study reports INT11697-INT11720-INT12503-
INT12500-INT10564-INT6040. 
In addition and following CHMP request section 4.4 of 
the SmPC was updated to include a warning for 
patients to be evaluated for tuberculosis before 
starting treatment with leflunomide. 
The PL was revised to reflect the above warnings and 
interactions. 
Furthermore, the MAH took the opportunity of this 
worksharing to reflect the interaction studies in the 
RMP and to include DRESS syndrome in the RMP as 
requested by PRAC.

14 cases of DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC in order 
to add a warning and update the safety information 
on DRESS (drug reaction with eosinophilia and 
systemic symptoms).  The section 2 and 4 of the 
Package Leaflet were proposed to be updated 
accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives for Finland, Malta, 
Sweden and United Kingdom in the Package Leaflet. 
C.I.z - Changes (Safety/Efficacy) of Human and

Systemic Symptoms) have been retrieved. 10 cases are 
reports from literature articles and 4 are spontaneous. Of 
the 14 cases, 7 provide insufficient or inconclusive 
information.  The remaining 7 spontaneous and literature 
cases of DRESS have (strong) suggestive evidence and 
strong temporal association with leflunomide (2 “definite” 
and 5 “possible” cases according to the RegiSCAR criteria).  
The product information has therefore been updated to 
include that cases of Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) have been reported in 
patients treated with leflunomide. 
The MAHs of generic products containing leflunomide will 
update their product information in line with that of the 
reference product.

Based on published clinical trial data and single case 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC to add 
cutaneous lupus erythematosus, pustular psoriasis or 
worsening psoriasis and warn physicians about these 
skin reactions. The PL is being updated accordingly. 
Furthermore, the list of local representatives in 
section 6 of the PL is being updated. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
reports in the scientific literature, a possible causal 
association of leflunomide treatment with worsening of 
underlying psoriasis and pustular psoriasis is strongly 
suggested by two cases identified from the company global 
pharmacovigilance database reporting positive rechallenge 
after reintroduction of leflunomide. No similar published 
reports were identified during a comprehensive review of 
the scientific literature. Based on these observations, it can 
be concluded that leflunomide therapy may be associated 
with paradoxical worsening of underlying psoriasis and 
occurrence of pustular psoriasis.  
A possible causal association of leflunomide treatment with 
cutaneous lupus erythematosus is strongly suggested by 
one case identified from the company global 
pharmacovigilance database and published in the scientific 
literature reporting a positive rechallenge of cutaneous 
Page 7/12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lupus erythematosus after reintroduction of leflunomide. 
Such causal relation is further supported by 5 additional 
cases identified from the company global 
pharmacovigilance database and 1 additional report from 
the scientific literature review documenting plausible time 
to onset and positive dechallenge in the absence of other 
obvious confounders except for the underlying autoimmune 
disease. Cutaneous lupus erythematosus was largely 
reversible with discontinuation of leflunomide with or 
without a drug elimination procedure and, in some cases, 
with the administration of corrective treatment. Based on 
these findings it can be concluded that leflunomide therapy 
may be associated with the development of cutaneous 
lupus erythematosus.  
Overall, based on the presented data, cutaneous lupus 
erythematosus, pustular psoriasis or worsening psoriasis 
are added to the SmPC as new adverse events with a “not 
known” frequency. The CHMP also required that Physicians 
be warned in section 4.4 that pustular psoriasis and 
worsening of psoriasis have been reported after the use of 
leflunomide and that treatment withdrawal may be 
considered taking into account patient’s disease and past 
history.

the MAH was asked to update the warning section of the

LEADER) in which two initial dosing regimen were used, 
121 DMARD-naive patients with early RA were randomized 
to receive either the 20 mg or 100 mg starting dose in a 
double-blind, double-dummy fashion, followed by an open-
label maintenance period of 3 months during which 20mg/d 
where administered. The ACR20 response rate at 90 days 
(primary endpoint) was statistically significantly higher in 
the flat-dose group compared to the loading dose group. 
There were, however, no significant differences for any of 
the secondary efficacy parameters, such as ACR50 or 
DAS28 response and, also considered the small sample 
size, superiority of flat dosing regimen above the 100 mg 
loading dose cannot be concluded. However, there appears 
to be no loss of clinical response in the flat dose regimen as 
compared to the loading dose regimen. The incidence of 
gastrointestinal AEs and of elevated liver enzymes reported 
as adverse events tended to be higher during the earlier 
phases of treatment in patients receiving the loading dose 
of 100 mg leflunomide. Overall, the safety data obtained 
were consistent with the known safety profile of

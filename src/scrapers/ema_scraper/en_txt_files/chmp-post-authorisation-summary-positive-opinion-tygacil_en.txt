Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Tygacil 
tigecycline 
On 23 April 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Tygacil. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Pfizer Limited. 
The CHMP adopted a change to an existing indication as follows2: 
“Tygacil is indicated in adults and in children from the age of eight years for the treatment of the 
following infections (see sections 4.4 and 5.1): 
• 
• 
Complicated skin and soft tissue infections (cSSTI), excluding diabetic foot infections (see section 
4.4) 
Complicated intra-abdominal infections (cIAI) 
Tygacil should be used only in situations where it is known or suspected that other alternatives 
antibiotics are not suitable (see sections 4.4, and 4.8 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antibacterial agents.” 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of 
product characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report 
(EPAR), and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to 
the marketing authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

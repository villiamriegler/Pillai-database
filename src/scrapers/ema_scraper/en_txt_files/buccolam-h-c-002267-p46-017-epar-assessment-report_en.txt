1.  Introduction 
On  the  27th  of  January  2020,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  Buccolam,  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  study  SHP615-301  is  part  of  a  clinical  development  program  to  support  the 
paediatric status epilepticus indication in Japan per request of the Japanese health authorities. There is 
no variation or extension to be expected as Buccolam is already approved for use in paediatric subjects 
in the EU.   
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
The  investigational  product  (IP),  was  a  clear,  colorless,  ready-to-use  solution  containing  5  mg/mL 
midazolam (as midazolam hydrochloride salt; each mL contains 5 mg midazolam free base [equivalent 
to 5.56 mg midazolam hydrochloride]). The IP was specifically developed as a single, age-specific, fixed-
dose  (approximately  0.25-0.5  mg/kg)  formulation  for  buccal  administration  in children;  1  dosage  per 
each of the following age groups:  
•  2.5 mg (yellow label) ages 3 months (52 weeks corrected gestational age) to <1 year (and 
•  weight >5 kg) 
•  5 mg (blue label) ages 1 year to <5 years 
•  7.5 mg (purple label) ages 5 years to <10 years 
•  10 mg (orange label) ages 10 years to <18 years 
2.3.  Clinical aspects

2.3.2.  Clinical study 
SHP615-301: A Phase 3, Multicenter, Open-label Study to Determine the Efficacy, Safety, and 
Pharmacokinetics of Buccally Administered MHOS/SHP615 in Pediatric Patients with Status 
Epilepticus (Convulsive) in the Hospital or Emergency Room 
Description 
Study SHP615-301 was a phase 3, open-label study to evaluate the efficacy, safety and pharmacokinetics 
of  a  single  dose  of  Buccolam  in  Japanese  paediatric  patients  with  convulsive  status  epilepticus  in  the 
hospital or emergency room.  
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of this study was to assess the efficacy of oromucosal midazolam (referred to in 
the  report  as  MHOS/SHP615)  administered  buccally  in  pediatric  patients  with  convulsive  status 
epilepticus (CSE) in a healthcare setting. 
The secondary objectives of this study were to assess the safety and PK of MHOS/SHP615 administered 
buccally to pediatric patients with CSE in a healthcare setting. 
Study design 
This study was to be conducted in approximately 25 healthcare setting study centers in Japan. 
Twenty-five subjects were to be enrolled in this study as shown in Figure 1. The study consisted of a 24-
hour,  open-label treatment  period  followed  by  a  1-week  safety follow-up period.  Subjects  were  to  be 
screened and assessed at baseline immediately before administration of IP even if the informed consent 
and some prescreening assessments had been completed at a previous clinical visit.

Study population /Sample size 
Study population 
Children whose corrected gestational age was ≥52 weeks (gestational weeks plus the number of weeks 
after birth) and <18 years (and weight >5 kg) who arrived at the healthcare setting in full seizure, had 
not  received  immediate  treatment,  and  had  parent,  guardian,  or  legally  authorized  representative 
informed  consent/assent  (when  applicable,  per  Shire  policy  and  country  regulations),  were  eligible  to 
participate, provided all eligibility criteria were met. The seizure event(s) had to be accompanied by loss 
of consciousness and could be either generalized tonic-clonic seizures or could have started focally and 
then generalized. 
Sample size 
The target sample size (approximately 25 subjects; minimum 3 subjects per age group) is estimated 
based  on  the  expected  response  rate  which  is  assumed  to  be  58.5%  compared  with the threshold  of 
30% with at least 80% of statistical power at the 2-sided 5% level. 
Treatments 
The  investigational  product,  MHOS/SHP615,  was  administered  buccally  by  the  investigator  or 
subinvestigator as a single, fixed-dose product, banded by age, to subjects with CSE in the healthcare 
setting. 
There  were  4  single,  fixed,  banded-by-age,  dose  regimens  of  the  MHOS/SHP615  formulation  for  the 
treatment of SE; 1 dosage per buccal administration for each of the following age groups: 
• 2.5 mg: 3 months (52 weeks corrected gestational age) to <1 year (and weight >5 kg) 
• 5 mg: 1 to <5 years 
• 7.5 mg: 5 to <10 years 
• 10 mg: 10 to <18 years 
For buccal administration, MHOS/SHP615 was administered into the space between the lower gum and 
the inside of the cheek. Only 1 syringe with the specified dose was given. The full amount of the prefilled 
dosing syringe was injected slowly into the buccal mucosa. In some cases, it might have been necessary 
to divide the dose so that half of the solution was injected into each side of mouth. Prior to administration 
of drug therapy, the airway was secured, and respiratory and cardiac function assessed. 
CHMP comments: 
The treatment is the same as the registered product Buccolam in the EU (EMEA/H/C/002267). 
Pharmacokinetics 
Plasma midazolam (MDZ) and its active metabolite (1-hydroxymidazolam, 1-OH-MDZ)) concentrations 
were evaluated. Pharmacokinetic samples were collected at approximately 1 hour earliest and at 3, 
and 6 hours (or time of discharge, if earlier than 6 hours) after midazolam administration.

Bioanalytical 
Determination  of  midazolam  and  1-hydroxymidazolam  in  human  K3EDTA  plasma  samples  for  study 
SHP615-301  was  performed  using  a  validated  method  of  protein  precipitation  for  sample  preparation 
followed by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry. 
Overall precision and bias for the QC samples were within 15% at all levels, indicating that the method 
performed reliably during the analysis of study samples. Samples were analysed within the established 
storage stability period of 362 days at -80°C. Valid concentrations were generated for all study samples 
analysed. The reproducibility of the validated analytical method when applied to incurred plasma samples 
(ISR) was also within the required acceptance limits for the re-analysis of incurred samples stored at -
80°C. 
Statistical Methods (Pop PK) 
The  PK  data  from  study  SHP615-301  were  analysed  using  a  previously  established  semi-mechanistic 
model that supported an age-based dosing paradigm. The previously developed popPK model was refined 
by  supplementing  data  from  study  SHP615-301  to  the  existing  study  MID001  dataset.  The  analysis 
simultaneously models MDZ and 1-OH-MDZ data from both studies to assess drug exposure differences 
between Japanese and non-Japanese pediatric subjects.  
Study MID001 is a PK study of buccal administered SHP615 in non-Japanese children undergoing routine 
elective surgery, dosed 0.2 mg/kg (5 mg/ml), in which sparse sampling was applied (N = 3-6 samples 
from  50  subjects,  obtained  from  0  to  8  h  post  dose  or  prior  to  cannula  removal).  Patients  aged  >3 
months to <18 years (3 m to <1 y n=6, 1 y to <5 y n=20, 5 y to <10 y n=12 and 10 y to <18 y n= 
12). 
A  number  of  Japanese  pediatric  subjects  in  study  SHP615-301  (N=12)  were  administered  MDZ  via  a 
route  other  than  buccal.  Of  these,  8  subjects  received  concomitant  MDZ  as  rescue  treatment  on  the 
same day as SHP615 administration (i.e., occurring between approximately 40 min and 9 h after SHP615 
treatment). These subjects were excluded from the PopPK analysis. A total of 16 subjects remained in 
the popPK evaluation (3m to <1y (n=3), 1y to <5y (n=8) and 5y to <10y (n=5)). 
Overall,  a  total  of  45  (Study  SHP615-301)  and  263  (Study  MID001)  concentration  samples  with 
quantifiable  MDZ  or  1-OH-MDZ  were  available  for  inclusion  in  the  PopPK  analysis.  For  all  MDZ 
concentrations, corresponding 1-OH-MDZ observations were similarly available. 
Plasma  MDZ  and  1-OH-MDZ  concentration-time  data  were  simultaneously  analyzed  using  nonlinear 
mixed-effects modeling (NONMEM®, Version 7.3, ICON, Hanover, MD, USA). The first-order conditional 
estimation method with interaction was used for all modeling, and the ADVAN5 subroutine. R Version 
3.4.4  was  used  for  graphical  exploration,  goodness-of-fit  (GOF),  model  evaluation,  and  descriptive 
statistics. All simulations were performed using the RxODE package in R (Version 3.4.4). 
Standard GOF plots were used to assess whether the model appropriately described MDZ and 1-OH-MDZ 
observed concentrations. A prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC) was used to evaluate 
the performance of the final model. Bootstrap resampling methods were used to evaluate the precision 
of final estimates, including the estimation of confidence intervals (CIs) for model parameters. Individual

empirical Bayes estimates (EBEs) from the final model were used to derive secondary PK parameters for 
MDZ  and  1-OH-MDZ.  Non-compartmental  analyses  were  performed  on  simulated  data,  to  derive 
secondary  PK  parameters  for  each  subject.  These  included  the  drug  concentration  at  10  min  (C10), 
maximal drug concentration (Cmax), area under the concentration-time from 0 to infinity (AUC0-inf), 
AUC from 0 to 10 min (AUC0-10), AUC from 0 to 60 min (AUC0-60), AUC from 0 to 180 min (AUC0-
180), time to maximal concentration (Tmax), and elimination half-life (t1/2) for both analytes. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  is  response  rate,  which  is  defined  as  the  percentage  of  subjects  with 
therapeutic success. Therapeutic success will be declared for subjects who meet both of the following 
conditions: 
•  Cessation of visible seizure activity within 10 minutes, i.e., the time from investigational product 
administration  to  the  end  of  the  initial  seizure is  less  than  or equal  to  10  minutes.  The initial 
seizure refers to the seizure which triggered the use of the investigational product and which is 
captured on the “confirmation of status epilepticus” eCRF form. 
•  A  sustained  absence  of  visible  seizure  activity  for  30  minutes  following  a  single  dose  of 
MHOS/SHP615 without the need for additional rescue medication, i.e., subject has no recurrence 
of  seizure  within  30  minutes  of  investigational  product  administration  as  documented  on  the 
“subject  seizure  status  (recurrence)”  eCRF  form,  and  no  rescue  medication  has  been 
administered within 30 minutes of investigational product administration. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints will include: 
•  Percentage  of  subjects  whose  seizure  event(s)  stopped  within  10  minutes  of  single  dose  of 
MHOS/SHP615 and who have sustained absence of seizure activity for at least 1 hour. 
•  Percentage  of  subjects  whose  seizure  event(s)  stopped  within  10  minutes  of  single  dose  of 
MHOS/SHP615 and who have sustained absence of seizure activity for at least 4 hours. 
•  Percentage  of  subjects  whose  seizure  event(s)  stopped  within  10  minutes  of  single  dose  of 
MHOS/SHP615 and who have sustained absence of seizure activity for at least 6 hours. 
•  Time to resolution of seizures (convulsions) 
•  Time to recovery of consciousness 
•  Percentage  of  subjects  who  require  additional  anticonvulsant  medication  for  ongoing  SE 
according to the participating healthcare setting protocol or guideline, 10 minutes after a single 
dose of MHOS/SHP615. 
•  Percentage of subjects who fail to respond to treatment: 
o  Treatment  failure/Non-responder  is  defined  as  continuing  seizure  activity  and/or  the 
need  for  any  additional  rescue  medication  according  to  the  participating  healthcare 
setting protocol or guideline, 10 minutes after a single dose of MHOS/SHP615.

CHMP comments: 
Treatment  success  was  defined  as  cessation  of  visible  seizure  activity  <  10  minutes  with  sustained 
absence for 30 minutes. This is shorter than the endpoints investigated in the studies discussed in the 
initial marketing authorisation for Buccolam, where 1 hour was used (see Buccolam EPAR). However, 
sustained absence is covered by the other endpoints. 
If there was no response to Buccolam treatment after 10 minutes, rescue medication was administered. 
This is in line with the current posology of Buccolam in the SmPC.  
Statistical Methods 
Primary endpoint 
The primary efficacy analysis will be conducted on the FAS by constructing the 2-sided, 95% Wald CI for 
the percentage of subjects reaching therapeutic success. The lower limit of the 95% CI will be compared 
with the threshold of 30%, which is equivalent to comparing the percentage of success to the threshold 
at the 2-sided 5% level of significance. The 2-sided p-value of the Wald test will also be provided.  
In addition, the primary efficacy endpoint, response rate, will be evaluated using descriptive statistics 
for the following subgroups: 
•  Age group (age at the time of investigational product administration): 
•  <1 year 
•  1 to <5 years 
•  5 to <10 years 
•  10 to <18 years 
•  Gender: male and female 
•  Epilepsy etiology (based on the underlying etiology of their epilepsy): 
o  Genetic 
o 
Idiopathic 
o  Metabolic 
o  Symptomatic (Structural) 
The number and percentage of subjects achieving therapeutic success will be presented along with the 
corresponding exact 95% Clopper-Pearson CI for each subgroup category. The exact Clopper-Pearson 
CI will be used because the sample size could be small in some subgroups. 
Secondary endpoints 
Percentage  of  Subjects  Whose  Seizure  Event(s)  Stopped  Within  10  Minutes  of  Single  Dose  of 
MHOS/SHP615 and who Have Sustained Absence of Seizure Activity for At Least 1 Hour/4 Hours/6 Hours

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/383769/2020  
Page 8/27 
 
 
 
The  same  definition  of  therapeutic  success  as  given  in  the  CSR  will  be  used  except  that  the  second 
condition will be modified to require sustained absence of visible seizure activity without the need for 
additional  rescue  medication  for  1  hour,  4  hours  or  6  hours,  respectively,  following  a  single  dose  of 
MHOS/SHP615.  Two-sided,  95%  Wald  CI  for  the  percentage  of  subjects  reaching therapeutic  success 
will be constructed on the FAS. 
Time to Resolution of Seizures (Convulsions) 
Time to resolution of seizures (convulsions) in minutes will be calculated as time from investigational 
product  administration  to  the  end  of  the  initial  seizure  or  administration  of  rescue  anticonvulsant 
medication, whichever occurs first. The initial seizure refers to the seizure which triggered the use of the 
investigational product and which is captured on the “confirmation of status epilepticus” eCRF form. Note 
that,  as  per  the  definition  of  the  FAS,  there  will  be  no  censoring  in  this  time  to  event  analysis  as  all 
subjects  will  have  a  date  and  time  captured  for  the  initial  seizure  cessation.  Administration  of  rescue 
anticonvulsant medication for ongoing initial seizure will be treated as a competing event. Cumulative 
incidence function (CIF) of resolution of seizures will be estimated and a plot will be provided. In addition, 
CIF estimates and 95% CI will be provided at several time points post dose. 
A supporting data listing detailing each subject’s contribution to the analysis will also be provided. 
Time to Recovery of Consciousness 
Time to recovery of consciousness in minutes will be calculated only for subjects who lose consciousness 
pre-dose as time from investigational product administration to recovery of consciousness post-dose or 
administration  of  rescue  anticonvulsant  medication,  whichever  occurs  first.  Administration  of  rescue 
anticonvulsant medication prior to recovery of consciousness will be treated as a competing event. If the 
time  of  recovery  of  consciousness  is  missing  and  there  is  no  administration  of  rescue  anticonvulsant 
medication during the 24 hours treatment period, the time to recovery of consciousness will be censored 
at the latest time of any assessment captured in the eCRF up to hospital discharge during the 24 hours 
treatment period, i.e., vital signs, oxygen saturation, Riker SAS, buccal cavity assessment, laboratory 
or PK sample collection, ECG or time the subject was discharged from the hospital. CIF of recovery of 
consciousness will be estimated and a plot will be provided. In addition, CIF estimates and 95% CI will 
be provided at several time points post dose. 
A supporting data listing detailing each subject’s contribution to the analysis will also be provided. 
Percentage  of  Subjects  Who  Require  Additional  Anticonvulsant  Medication  for  Ongoing  SE  10  Minutes 
After a Single Dose of MHOS/SHP615 
Anticonvulsant medication for ongoing SE (rescue treatment) are captured on the “prior and concomitant 
medications” eCRF form. The percentage of subjects who require additional anticonvulsant medication 
for ongoing SE 10 minutes after investigational product administration and before the end of the initial 
seizure will be presented along with the corresponding 95% Wald CI. 
Percentage of Subjects Who Fail to Respond to Treatment 
Responder is defined as subject with cessation of visible seizure activity within 10 minutes after a single 
dose  of  MHOS/SHP615.  A  Treatment  failure/Non-responder  is  defined  as  a  subject  with  continuing 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/CHMP/383769/2020  
Page 9/27 
 
 
 
seizure  activity  for  more  than  10  minutes  after  a  single  dose  of  MHOS/SHP615  or  the  need  for  any 
additional anticonvulsant rescue medication to treat the initial seizure any time after the single dose of 
MHOS/SHP615 according to the participating healthcare setting protocol or guideline. Any of the following 
events qualifies as a treatment failure: 
•  The time from investigational product administration to the end of the initial seizure is more than 
10 minutes. The initial seizure refers to the seizure which triggered the use of the investigational 
product and which is captured on the “confirmation of status epilepticus” eCRF form. 
•  Rescue  anticonvulsant  medication  is  administered  to  treat  the  initial  seizure  anytime  after 
MHOS/SHP615 administration. 
The  percentage  of  subjects  who  fail  to  respond  to  treatment  will  be  presented  along  with  the 
corresponding 95% Wald CI. 
Sensitivity Analyses 
Analyses of the primary efficacy endpoint and secondary efficacy endpoints will be repeated for subjects 
in the Per Protocol Set. 
The 2-sided nominal p-value of the Wald test will be presented for the analysis of therapeutic success 
based on the PPS and no multiplicity adjustment will be performed for this sensitivity analysis. If the PPS 
and the FAS are identical, these sensitivity analyses will not be performed. 
CHMP comments: 
The statistical analyses proposed are descriptive, which is acceptable for this open-label single arm study. 
The  proportion  of  patients  with  treatment  success,  and  corresponding  confidence  interval  will  be 
compared to a threshold of 30%. No (clinical) justification could be found for this threshold, but since 
results are well away of the threshold, this is not further pursued 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of  the  80  subjects  screened,  25  subjects  received  the  IP,  and  25  subjects  completed  the  study;  no 
subjects withdrew from the study. A total of 55 subjects did not meet all of the inclusion and exclusion 
criteria and therefore failed screening (see Figure 2).

Figure 2 Subject Disposition 
CHMP comments: 
The relationship between (prior) screening and enrolment into the study is unclear, i.e. how by prior 
screening it is anticipated that a subject will experience status epilepticus in the future. This is issue, 
however, is not pursued.  
Baseline data 
Demographics 
Of the 25 subjects who received the IP, 3 subjects were <1 year of age, 13 subjects were 1 to <5 years 
of age, 7 subjects were 5 to <10 years of age, and 2 subjects were 10 to <18 years of age. All subjects 
were Asian and none were from a Hispanic or Latino ethnic group; the majority (64.0%) was female. 
The mean body mass index was 15.73 kg/m2 among all subjects, and was generally consistent across 
the age groups. As expected, mean weight and mean height increased with increasing age group. 
History of epilepsy 
The most common epilepsy diagnosis was severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy which was reported in 
14 subjects (56.0%) overall, all of whom were <10 years of age (1, 9, and 4 subjects in the age groups 
<1  year,  1  to  <5  years,  and  5  to  <10  years,  respectively).  There  were  no  subjects  with  an  epilepsy 
diagnosis of severe myoclonic epilepsy of infancy in the age group 10 to <18 years. 
A diagnosis of epilepsy was reported in 1 subject in the age group 10 to <18 years, 3 subjects in the 
age group 1 to <5 years, and 2 subjects each in the age groups <1 year and 5 to 10 years. All other 
epilepsy diagnoses were reported in ≤2 subjects overall, irrespective of age group.

Overall,  the  mean  duration  of  epilepsy  history  was  3.47  years  and  the  mean  number  of  years  since 
diagnosis  was  2.98  years.  As  expected,  mean  duration  of  epilepsy  history  and  time  since  diagnosis 
increased  with  increasing  age  group.  A  total  of  18  subjects  (72.0%)  had  major  epilepsy  of  genetic 
etiology,  the  majority  of  whom  were  1  to  <5  years  of  age.  Major  epilepsy  of  idiopathic  etiology  was 
reported in 4 subjects, all of whom were <10 years of age, while major epilepsy of structural etiology 
was reported in 3 subjects (1 subject each in the age groups <1 year, 1 to <5 years, and 10 to <18 
years, respectively). 
As per the study entry criteria, all 25 subjects had a current seizure (convulsive) accompanied by loss 
of  consciousness,  prior  to IP  administration.  All 25  subjects  were  hospitalized prior to  seizure onset  . 
Time from seizure onset to IP administration ranged from 0 to 68 minutes for all except 1 subject, in 
whom  time  from  seizure  onset  to  IP  administration  was  116  minutes.  The  prolonged  time  to  IP 
administration in 1 Subject did not appear to have a notable impact on the time to seizure cessation or 
recovery of consciousness, both of which occurred 2 minutes postdose. 
Prior anti-epileptic medication 
All  25  subjects  had  at  least  1  prior  medication.  Thirteen  subjects  (52.0%)  had  prior  anticonvulsant 
medications  as  rescue  treatment  for  ongoing  SE  .  The  most  frequently  reported  anticonvulsant 
medications  as  rescue  treatment  were  diazepam  (9  subjects  [36.0%])  and  midazolam  (8  subjects 
[32.0%]). 
Prior  anticonvulsant  medications  as  prophylaxis  treatment  were  reported  for  all  subjects.  The  most 
frequently  reported  were  clobazam  (17  subjects  [68.0%]),  valproate  sodium  (16  subjects  [64.0%]), 
stiripentol  (13  subjects  [52.0%]),  levetiracetam  (10  subjects  [40.0%]),  and  topiramate  (9  subjects 
[36.0%]). 
Concomitant medication 
Concomitant medications were those taken between the time of IP administration and the end of the 
follow-up  period  (ie,  8  days  after  IP  administration).  No  subjects  had  a  protocol  deviation  related  to 
prohibited medication. 
All  25  subjects  had  at  least  1  concomitant  medication.  Sixteen  subjects  (64.0%)  had  concomitant 
anticonvulsant  medications  as  rescue  treatment  for  ongoing  SE.  The  most  frequently  reported  were 
midazolam (9 subjects [36.0%]), diazepam (7 subjects [28.0%]), and fosphenytoin sodium (4 subjects 
[16.0%]).  No  subject  received  rescue  treatment  for  the  initial  seizure  within  10  minutes  of  IP 
administration.  Four  subjects  received  rescue  anticonvulsant  medication  10  minutes  or  more  after  IP 
administration  and  before  the  end  of  the  initial  seizure.  The  remaining  rescue  treatment  was 
administered after the initial seizure. 
Concomitant anticonvulsant medications as prophylaxis treatment were reported for all subjects. 
As seen with the prior medications, the most frequently reported were clobazam (17 subjects [68.0%]), 
valproate  sodium  (16  subjects  [64.0%]),  stiripentol  (13  subjects  [52.0%]),  and  levetiracetam  and 
topiramate (9 subjects [36.0%] each).

All subjects were reported with at least 1 other concomitant medication. The most frequently reported 
were in the classes of intravenous solutions (13 subjects [52.0%]; other alimentary tract and metabolism 
products  (10  subjects  [40.0%]);  and  drugs  for  constipation,  and hypnotics  and  sedatives  (9  subjects 
[36.0%] each). 
Concomitant therapies were administered to 20 subjects (80.0%); the most frequently reported were 
oxygen  therapy  (17  subjects  [68.0%]);  occupational  therapy  and  physiotherapy  (5  subjects  [20.0%] 
each); and speech rehabilitation (4 subjects [16.0%] 
Pharmacokinetic results 
The final model retained the structure of the original Study MID001 model, including the age effects and 
random  variability  components.  In  addition,  CYP3A4  inducers  and  Japanese  origin  were  identified  as 
influential covariates on the clearance of MDZ (CLP/F) and volume of 1-OH-MDZ (VCM/F), respectively.  
MDZ  PK  was  best  described  by  a  2-compartment  model  where  a  fraction  of  the  absorbed  dose  was 
assumed to be metabolized to 1-OH-MDZ and the remaining fraction metabolized to other metabolites, 
both  as  linear  clearance  terms.  The  absorption  of  MDZ  was  assumed  to  occur  both  buccally  and 
intestinally (i.e. swallowed and absorbed in the intestinal tract). 1-OH-MDZ PK was best described as a 
1-compartment model with linear clearance from the central compartment. 
Figure: structure of the pharmacokinetic model 
Age  was  identified  as  covariate  and  was  included  on  the  fraction  buccally  absorbed  and  all  central 
clearances and volumes of distribution. 
CYP3A4 inducers and Japanese origin were identified as covariates on the clearance of MDZ (CLP/F) and 
volume of 1-OH-MDZ (VCM/F), respectively.

In subjects receiving a moderate to strong CYP3A4-effector agent as a concomitant medication (75% of 
the Japanese population, 0% of the non-Japanese population), MDZ clearance was estimated to be 2.28-
fold greater than in those subjects not on a CYP3A4 effector. 
Japanese  pediatric  subjects  would  be  expected  to  have  an  approximately  2.42-fold  higher  1-OH-MDZ 
volume of distribution; however, this should be interpreted with caution, as a result of the large portion 
of Japanese pediatric subjects which was also receiving a concomitantly administered CYP3A4 effector, 
which may be biasing the metabolite estimates for subjects in study SHP615-301. 
Model  diagnostics  showed  favourable  results  and  relatively  good  precision  in  estimates  was  obtained 
(relative standard error <50%), with ETA shrinkage ranging from 3.75 to 33.5%, see table of the model 
parameters below.

Good predictive performance was demonstrated when evaluating the model by pcVPC across alldata and 
when stratified by study. The pcVPC plots show that the final model describes both the central tendency 
and variability for MDZ and 1-OH-MDZ in Japanese subjects, see Figure below. 
Figures of prediction-corrected visual predictive check of the final model 
Secondary PK parameters for MDZ and 1-OH-MDZ were derived using the EBE from the final model. The 
exposure variables of interest included C10, Cmax, AUC0-inf, and partial AUC values up to 10 min (AUC0-
10), 60 min (AUC0-60), and 180 min (AUC0-180) Model derived PK parameters of both MDZ and 1-OH-
MDZ are depicted in the following figures and tables.

CHMP comments: 
Overall, the PopPK analysis adequately described the PK of MDZ and 1-OH-MDZ in Japanese and non-
Japanese  pediatric  subjects.  The  results  do  not  indicate  a  marked  difference  of  estimated  exposure 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the

between Japanese and non-Japanese pediatric subjects. Further, the age-based dosing regimen seems 
to result in a fairly consistent exposure of MDZ and 1-OH-MDZ over the different age categories. 
Differences  in  estimated  non-compartmental  exposure  comparisons  between  Japanese  and  non-
Japanese  pediatric  subjects  were  not  significant  for  most  PK  parameters.  However,  for  the  parent 
compound  midazolam,  Japanese  pediatric  patients  are  expected  to  demonstrate  a  significant  higher 
exposure  compared  to  non-Japanese  pediatric  patients  for  C10  (mean  45.2  versus  27.1  ng/ml)  and 
AUC0-10 (mean 304 versus 177 ng/min/ml). For the metabolite 1-OH-MDZ, Japanese pediatric patients 
are expected to demonstrate a significant higher exposure compared to non-Japanese pediatric patients 
for Cmax (mean 31.1 versus 19.3 ng/ml), AUC0-180 (mean 6754 versus 3754 ng/min/ml) and AUC0-
inf. 
The results are confounded by the limited number of Japanese pediatric patients and concomitant use of 
CYP3A4 effector drugs (75% of the patients) in study SHP615-301, and late first blood sample draw (1 
hour post dose) which is likely the origin of large variability (BSV) on the parameter for the fraction of 
the dose absorbed via the buccal route (Fbucc), and the estimated C10 and AUC0-10 values. 
Therefore, some uncertainty remains with regard to the effect of race on the PK of MDZ and 1-OH-MDZ 
in pediatric patients and the estimated parameters of the absorption phase of the model, resulting in 
difficulty interpreting estimated C10 and AUC0-10 values. 
Nonetheless, overall, it can be agreed with the MAH that the pop PK modeling results are sufficient to 
support the conclusion that a different pharmacokinetic profile for Japanese pediatric patients compared 
to non-Japanese pediatric patients is not expected.  
However, it is not agreed with the MAH that results presented in this article 46 procedure do not need 
to  be  reflected  in  the  SPC.  First,  it  should  be  discussed  by  the  MAH  whether  the  current  table  on 
pharmacokinetic  parameters  in  section  5.2 of  the  SPC  should  be  updated  based  on the  results of  the 
refined pop PK study. Second, the newly gained information on the effect of race on the pharmacokinetics 
of midazolam should be included in section 5.2 of the SPC. 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint 
The response rate, defined as the percentage of subjects with therapeutic success, was 80.0% (95% CI: 
64.3,  95.7)  in  the  full  analysis  set  (FAS,  see  Table  1).  The  95%  CI  showed  that  there  was  a  95% 
probability that the true percentage was between 64.3% and 95.7% of subjects. When the lower limit 
of  the  95%  CI  was  compared  with  the  threshold  of  30%  (using  the  Wald  test),  the  response  was 
statistically significant (2-sided p-value <0.001). 
The  results  were  similar  for  the  per protocol  set  (PPS)  (79.2%;  95%  CI: 62.9,  95.4;  2-sided  p-value 
<0.001).

CHMP comments 
Eighty percent of the subjects enrolled in the study were a responder to treatment (“95% CI [64.3; 
95.7]”). This is within the same order of effect as was observed with prior studies (Buccolam SmPC, 
Section 5.1). However, due to the open label and uncontrolled design of the study, no firm conclusions 
regarding efficacy can be drawn.  
Secondary endpoints 
Percentage of subjects whose seizure event(s) stopped within 10 minutes of Single dose of the ip and 
who had sustained absence of seizure activity for at Least 1 hour/4 hours/6 hours 
The  percentage  of  subjects  with  a  cessation  of  seizures  within  10  minutes  (ie,  ≤10  minutes)  of  IP 
administration and no seizure activity for at least 1 hour was 68.0%. The percentage of subjects with a 
cessation of seizures within 10 minutes and no seizure activity for at least 4 hours was 36.0% and for 
at least 6 hours was 32.0% (see Table 3). 
The results were similar for the PPS (70.8%, 37.5% and 33.3% of subjects with a cessation of seizures 
within  10  minutes  of  IP  administration  and  no  seizure  activity  at  least  1  hour,  4  hours,  and  6  hours, 
respectively).

Product Administration and Sustained Absence of Seizure Activity (Full Analysis Set) 
Time to resolution of seizures (convulsions) 
Seizure  resolution  without  the  need  for  rescue  anticonvulsant  medication  occurred  in  21  out  of  25 
subjects (84.0%). Of these 21 subjects, 1 subject had seizure recurrence within 30 minutes after the 
initial seizure stopped  
Overall,  an  estimated  20%  of  subjects  had  resolution  of  their  initial  seizure  at  1  minute  after  IP 
administration,  80.0%  at  7  minutes  after  IP  administration,  and  84.0%  at  10  minutes  after  IP 
administration.

Four subjects (16.0%) had a competing event (the subjects were administered a rescue anticonvulsant 
medication for their ongoing initial seizure). 
Results were similar in the PPS (20 out of 24 subjects had seizure resolution without the need for rescue 
anticonvulsant medication; an estimated 20.8%, 79.2%, and 83.3% of subjects had resolution of their 
initial seizure at 1, 7 and 10 minutes after IP administration, respectively). 
Time to recovery of consciousness 
Of  the  25  subjects  who  lost  consciousness  predose,  19  subjects  (76.0%)  recovered  consciousness 
postdose without the need for rescue anticonvulsant medication. Overall, an estimated 60.0% of subjects 
had  recovered  consciousness  at  10  minutes  after  IP  administration,  68.0%  at  30  minutes  after  IP 
administration, and 76.0% at 2 hours after IP administration. 
Six  subjects  (24.0%)  had  a  competing  event  (subjects  were  administered  rescue  anticonvulsant 
medication before recovering consciousness). 
Results  were  similar  in  the  PPS  (18  out  of  24  subjects  recovered  consciousness  without  the  need  for 
rescue anticonvulsant medication; an estimated 58.3%, 66.7%, and 75.0% of subjects had recovered 
consciousness at 10 minutes, 30 minutes, and 2 hours after IP administration, respectively). 
CHMP comments: 
Most subjects (84%) had seizure resolution without the need for rescue medication. Sixty-eight percent 
of subjects had resolution of their initial seizure within 10 minutes after administration and had no seizure 
activity for at least an hour. These results are in line with results previously obtained, where cessation 
of visible signs of seizures within 10 minutes without recurrence within 1 hour after administration was 
observed in 56% to 70% of children (Buccolam SmPC,  section 5.1). However, due to the open label, 
uncontrolled design of the study, no firm conclusions on efficacy can be drawn. 
Safety results 
A total of 24 out of 25 subjects (96.0%) received the correct and complete dose of the IP. 
One subject received the full dose of the IP into each side of the mouth but some of the drug leaked out. 
The  subject  initially  responded  to  treatment  (the  initial  seizure  was  stopped  within  10  minutes  of  IP 
administration and an absence of seizure activity was sustained for 30 minutes); however, the subject 
had  seizure  recurrence  within  1  hour  after  IP  administration  that  required  treatment  with  rescue 
anticonvulsant medication.Among the 24 subjects who received a complete dose of the IP, mean (SD) 
actual dose increased proportionately with increasing age group: 2.50 (0.000) mg in the age group <1 
year, 5.00 (0.000) mg in the age group 1 to <5 years, 7.50 (0.000) mg in the age group 5 to <10 years, 
and 10.00 (-) mg in the age group 10 to <18 years. 
Adverse events  
Overall,  9  subjects  (36.0%)  experienced  a  total  of  13  TEAEs.  Three  subjects  reported  serious  TEAEs 
during the study; 2 subjects (15.4%) in the age group 1 to <5 years, and 1 subject (50.0%) in the age 
group 10 to <18 years.  A total of 2 subjects (8.0%) reported severe TEAEs,  and 3 subjects (12.0%)

reported a TEAE that was considered by the investigator to be related to IP. No subjects died during the 
study, and no subjects reported TEAEs leading to discontinuation from the study. 
Treatment-emergent AEs occurred most frequently in the SOC of nervous system disorders, which was 
reported in 4 subjects (16.0%) overall; 2 subjects (15.4%) in the age group 1 to <5 years, 1 subject 
(14.3%) in the age group 5 to <10 years, and 1 subject (50%) in the age group 10 to <18 years. All 
other TEAEs by SOC were reported in ≤2 subjects overall, irrespective of age group  
The most frequent TEAE by PT occurring in ≥10% of subjects in any age group was respiratory depression 
(2 subjects [8.0%]). All other TEAEs by PT occurring in ≥10% of subjects in any age group were reported 
in 1 subject overall (see Table 4). 
Table  4  Frequently  Occurring  (>=10%)  Treatment-Emergent  Adverse  Events  by  Preferred 
Term and Age Group (Safety Set) 
The  majority  of  TEAEs  were  considered  mild  in  intensity.  Overall,  2  subjects  (8.0%)  reported  severe 
TEAEs; 1 subject (4.0%) reported a severe TEAE of SE and 1 subject (4.0%) reported a severe TEAE of 
respiratory depression. 
All TEAEs reported during the study occurred before hospital discharge. No subjects reported TEAEs after 
hospital discharge. 
A total of 3 subjects (12.0%) reported a total of 3 serious TEAEs during the study, including SE, seizure 
cluster, and respiratory depression. Of these, 1 SAE was considered by the investigator to be related to 
the  IP  (respiratory  depression);  the  event  was  severe  in  intensity  and  occurred  on  the  same  day  as 
treatment  failure.  The  other  2  SAEs  were  not  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  the  IP.

Severe TEAEs of respiratory depression (1 event; serious and considered related to the IP, and SE (2 
events in 1 subject; 1 serious event and 1 nonserious event, both considered unrelated to the IP) were 
also reported. 
A total of 2 subjects (8.0%) reported a TEAE of respiratory depression during the study: 
•  1  subject  reported  a  TEAE  of  respiratory  depression  on  Day  5  of  the  study  that  was  mild  in 
intensity and was not considered by the investigator to be related to the IP. No action was taken 
in response to the event, which resolved 3 days after onset. 
1 subject reported a serious TEAE of respiratory depression on Day 1 of the study that was severe in 
intensity  and  was  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  related  to  the  IP.  Of  note,  the  subject  had 
decreased oxygen saturation at baseline (82%) and failed to respond to treatment with the IP. Medical 
intervention (assisted ventilation) was required to treat the event which resolved on the same day. No 
events of aspiration pneumonia or buccal irritation were reported during the study. 
Improvements in Riker SAS scores were observed following IP administration. Median Riker SAS scores 
increased from 1.0 (indicates “unarousable”) at baseline to 4.0 (indicates “calm and cooperative”) at 30 
minutes postdose and remained at 4.0 at all subsequent timepoints evaluated. 
No  clinically  relevant  trends  were  apparent  in  mean  changes  from  baseline  in  chemistry  values,  vital 
signs,  or  urinalysis  parameters  over  time.  Clinically  significant  abnormalities  in  individual  chemistry 
values and vital signs were observed in a small number of subjects. Elevated ALT and elevated glucose 
were reported in 1 subject each. Vital signs abnormalities included elevated pulse rate, reported in 4 
subjects;  elevated  temperature,  reported  in  3  subjects;  and  elevated  respiratory  rate,  reported  in  2 
subjects. 
Overall, 24 out of 25 subjects had at least 1 oxygen saturation on room air result recorded during the 
study. At all timepoints evaluated, overall mean oxygen saturation on room air was ≥94%. One subject 
had an oxygen saturation on room air measurement of 87% at baseline which persisted for at least 2 
minutes.  
No clinically relevant changes with time were observed for ECG results. 
CHMP comments: 
The amount of safety data is limited due to the number of subjects included in the study. Adverse events 
did not occur frequently, though what has been reported are known events associated with midazolam 
(Buccolam SmPC, section 4.8).  
There were two cases of respiratory depression of which one was serious. Subject 1’s seizure activity did 
not  resolve  10  minutes  after  Buccolam  administration  and  was  regarded  as  a  treatment  failure  and 
subsequently  received  rescue  medication  (thiopental  sodium).  Approximately  half  an  hour  after 
Buccolam/rescue  medication  administration,  the  subject  experienced  a  serious  case  of  respired 
depression  and  needed  to  be  intubated.  The  subject  had  Dravet  Syndrome  and  took  the  following 
concomitant  anti-epileptic  drugs:  stiripentol,  levetiracetam,  valproate  and  clobazam.  The  Applicant

considers the event related to the study medication, more specifically the result of various drug-drug 
interactions due to the concomitant drugs the subject had taken. This conclusion is supported as it is 
known  that  combining  midazolam  with  other  anti-epileptic  drugs  increases  the  risk  for  respiratory 
depression.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Study SHP615-301 was an open-label study to evaluate oromucosal midazolam as an acute treatment 
for status epilepticus.  
The pop PK modelling results are sufficient to support the conclusion that a different pharmacokinetic 
profile  for  Japanese  pediatric  patients  compared  to  non-Japanese  pediatric  patients  is  not  expected. 
However, it should be discussed by the MAH whether section 5.2 of SPC should updated, based on the 
current results. . 
Regarding  efficacy  results,  80%  of  the  subjects  enrolled in the  study  were  a  responder to  treatment. 
Furthermore,  68%  percent  of  subjects  had  resolution  of  their  initial  seizure  within  10  minutes  after 
administration and had no seizure activity for at least an hour. These results are within the same order 
of magnitude as results previously obtained (Buccolam SmPC, Section 5.1). However, due to the open 
label, uncontrolled design of the studies, no firm conclusions on efficacy can be drawn. 
No new safety signals have been identified in the study population. Adverse events were infrequent and 
what was reported is similar to what was previously observed (Buccolam SmPC, section 4.8).  
3.  Rapporteur’s updated overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
  Fulfilled: 
4.  Additional clarification requested 
Based on the data submitted, the MAH should address the following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  It  has not  sufficiently  been  justified  that  results  presented  in  this  article  46  procedure  do not 
need to be reflected in the SPC. First, it should be discussed by the Applicant whether the current 
table on pharmacokinetic parameters in section 5.2 of the SPC should be updated based on the 
results of the refined pop PK study. Second, it should be discussed if the newly gained information 
on the effect of race on the pharmacokinetics of midazolam should be included in section 5.2 of 
the SPC. 
The timetable is a 30 day response timetable with clock stop.

MAH responses to Request for supplementary information 
The Applicant acknowledges the rapporteurs request and proposes to update section 5.2 of the SmPC 
with the following wording: 
Race: 
Clinical studies have included patients from Japanese and non-Japanese groups, and no differences in 
the pharmacokinetic profile have been identified on exposure to Buccolam. 
No dose adjustment is warranted. 
CHMP comments: 
The Applicant partially responded to the assessor’s request for supplementary information. The 
proposed addition to section 5.2 of the SmPC is agreed. The issue on the table on pharmacokinetic 
parameters in section 5.2, is not further pursued. 
No further issues.

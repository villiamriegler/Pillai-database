2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Congenital coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) deficiency is a rare autosomal recessive bleeding disorder 
with an estimated prevalence of 1 per 2 to 5 million individuals. Congenital FXIII deficiency is usually 
caused by mutations in the F13A1 gene (6p24.2-p23) encoding the catalytic A subunit, but mutations 
have also been found in the F13B gene (1q31-q32.1) encoding the B subunit. The phenotype is less 
severe when the F13B gene is mutated. In patients with FXIII A-subunit deficiency the FXIII activity 
level is lower than 3 to 5% (or approximately 0.04 to 0.06 IU/mL), compared with a wide range of 
approximately 50% to 220% (0.60 to 2.60 IU/mL) in the normal population. 
Diagnosis is based on quantitative FXIII activity measurement and antigen assays. Common clotting 
assays such as activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) and Prothrombin Time (PT) are normal 
and cannot be used for the screening. The clot solubility test may also be used (clot is stable for less 
than 24 hours in case of FXIII deficiency). However, the assay is qualitative, and when performed 
correctly the test is positive only when the FXIII activity in the sample is close to zero. Differential 
diagnoses mainly include the other congenital coagulation factor deficiencies: fibrinogen, factors II, V, 
VII, X, XI, VIII and IX. Antenatal diagnosis is possible if the causal mutations have previously been 
identified in the family.  
Congenital factor XIII deficiency is characterized by hemorrhagic diathesis frequently associated with 
spontaneous abortions and defective wound healing. Congenital FXIII deficiency can manifest at any 
age, but diagnosis is often made during infancy. Umbilical stump bleeding manifests in up to 80% of 
the patients. Other common signs include intracranial hemorrhage (25-30%), soft tissue bleeding, 
bruising, hemarthroses (20%), and recurrent spontaneous abortions. In most cases, hemorrhages are 
delayed (12-36hr) after trauma or surgery. Patients may have poor wound healing.  
FXIII is a pro-enzyme (pro-transglutaminase) and is the terminal enzyme in the coagulation cascade. 
In plasma, FXIII circulates as an inactive zymogen heterotetramer [A2B2] composed of two FXIII A-
subunits [A2] and two carrier FXIII B-subunits [B2] held together by strong non-covalent interactions. 
The FXIII A-subunits possess the catalytic site of the FXIII enzyme. The FXIII B-subunits act as carrier 
molecules for the FXIII A-subunits in circulation, and prolong the half-life of the FXIII A-subunit when 
in circulation. The carrier FXIII B-subunits are present in approximately 50% excess in plasma in the 
form of circulating, uncomplexed proteins. The mechanism of action of FXIII is as follows: following 
injury to the vessel wall the coagulation cascade is activated. This leads to the conversion of fibrinogen 
into fibrin monomers, which polymerise and form a fibrin clot at the site of injury. Upon proteolytic 
activation by thrombin, the FXIII A-subunits are released from the FXIII B-subunits, whereby the 
active site of the FXIII enzyme is exposed. Activated FXIII binds to fibrin and catalyses the formation 
of several amide bond cross-links between adjacent fibrin molecules.  
This cross-linking increases the mechanical strength of the fibrin clot and prevents premature 
fibrinolysis. In addition to cross-linking fibrin molecules, FXIII incorporates into the fibrin clot a number 
of plasma- and extracellular matrix proteins involved in inhibition of fibrinolysis and promotion of 
wound healing, including the anti-fibrinolytic protein α2 antiplasmin, which is the major inhibitor of 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 6/80
 
 
 
 
 
plasmin-induced clot degradation. Thus, FXIII modifies both the mechanical strength and the 
physiological properties of the blood clot and is vital to normal haemostasis. 
In congenital FXIII deficiency, initial clot formation is often sufficient to arrest bleeding. However, if 
there is insufficient FXIII activity for adequate cross-linking of fibrin and for incorporation of α2 
antiplasmin into the clot, clot strength is decreased and premature clot lysis occurs. Bleeding may 
resume several hours after injury (delayed bleeding). In the absence of FXIII replacement, a single 
injury may initiate refractory bleeding episodes lasting weeks or months. 
Current treatment options in FXIII deficiency include cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, and – where 
available – plasma-derived FXIII concentrate. Prophylactic therapy with FXIII concentrate should be 
indicated to prevent recurrent bleedings such as intracranial hemorrhage. Intracranial hemorrhage can 
be life threatening, but prognosis is favorable if adequate treatment is provided.  
Recombinant FXIII (rFXIII, rFXIII-A2) is a dimer of two FXIII A-subunits [rA2] and is identical in 
structure to the human FXIII A-subunit. Upon injection, the rFXIII A2 dimers bind to endogenous 
circulating B-subunits that circulate in excess to form a stable rA2B 2 heterotetramer. 
The Applicant applied for the following therapeutic indication for rFXIII: prophylactic treatment of 
bleeding in patients 6 years and above with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency. 
The final indication agreed by the CHMP is long-term prophylactic treatment of bleeding in patients 6 
years and above with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency 
The recommended dose is 35 IU/kg body weight (bw) once monthly (every 28 days +/- 2 days), 
administered as an intravenous bolus injection. Based on the actual concentration of NovoThirteen, the 
dose volume (in millilitres) to be administered can be calculated from the formula below: 
Dose volume in ml = 0.042 x subject bw (kg) 
Dose adjustment can be considered necessary by the physician in certain situations where the 
prevention of bleeding is not appropriately covered by the recommended 35 IU/kg/month dose. This 
dose adjustment should be based on FXIII activity levels. Monitoring NovoThirteen activity levels using 
a standard FXIII activity assay is recommended. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
NovoThirteen contains recombinant human coagulation factor XIII A (rFXIII-A)-subunit produced in 
yeast cells (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) by recombinant DNA technology.  
Recombinant FXIII is a dimer of two FXIII A-subunits [rA2] and is identical in structure to the human 
FXIII A-subunit. The finished product is presented as powder for solution for injection containing a 
nominal value of 2500 IU of rFXIII in glass vial. The container closure system for NovoThirteen consists 
of 12 ml glass vial Type I, chlorobutyl rubber stopper and snap-off. For reconstitution of the finished 
product, water for injections (WFI) is also supplied in another glass vial containing 3.2 mL. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The structure of recombinant FXIII (rFXIII) is a mature non-glycosylated full-size FXIII A subunit 
molecule with a native conformation of a non-covalent homodimer consisting of two identical rFXIII A-
subunits with a mass of approximately 166 kDa for the dimer. 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 7/80
 
 
 
 
The FXIII A-subunits are composed of 731 amino acids and possess the catalytic site of the FXIII 
enzyme. As for the native protein, the N-terminal serine is blocked and there are no post-translational 
modifications, and no disulfide linkages are present.  
The structural characterisation and elucidation of physico-chemical properties using adequate analytical 
methods presented in the application have confirmed that the structure and properties of rFXIII active 
substance produced by Novo Nordisk have identical features to the native FXIII-A subunit. 
Manufacture 
rFXIII-A 2 is produced intracellularly in Saccharomyces cerevisiae using fed-batch fermentation after 
which the cells are homogenized and rFXIII is captured and purified. The cell substrate was derived 
from Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell line which was transformed by a plasmid containing the gene of 
interest. The rFXIII A-subunit protein is not further processed and collected intracellularly in the 
cytosol.  
The commercial manufacturing process for rFXIII active substance consists of fermentation, recovery 
and purification. 
Fermentation includes propagation of S. cerevisiae strain expressing rFXIII in a fed batch process. A 
two-tiered banking system (MCB/ WCB) is used to assure supply of the production cell line to support 
manufacture of rFXIII.  MCB and WCB were both established without the use of materials of human or 
animal origin. During the recovery process rFXIII is released from the cells by high pressure 
homogenisation. The homogenized broth is clarified by centrifugation followed by filtration.  
The quantitative information (e.g. volumes/size, mass, load, cell density…) have been described. The 
description of the fermentation and recovery process and their controls is considered adequate. 
Detailed information on the in-process tests (including their appropriate limits) has been provided.  
The released rFXIII-A 2 is captured using anion exchange (DEAE) chromatography. During the following 
purification process another three chromatographic steps are performed. The purification process also 
includes 2 filtrations 0.2 µm.  The bulk is then concentrated by ultrafiltration, formulated into the final 
formulation buffer by diafiltration and filled into LDPE containers.  
Genetic stability was investigated on End of production cells (EOP) obtained with commercial scale 
fermentation up to the “routine limit of cell age”, and Late extended culture (LEC), obtained from small 
scale expansion beyond the routine limit of cell age. 
A batch of rFXIII active substance is the final material that is derived from one fed-batch fermentation. 
No material mixing or splitting is involved as one fermentation batch is recovered into one active 
substance batch. The range of the batch size initially claimed by the Applicant was not supported by 
the validation data provided and it was not clear whether the range proposed was due to technical 
equipment or to active substance yield. Supplementary validation studies were performed and results 
are within the validation target. The proposed batch size of the active substance is considered 
acceptable and the batch numbering system appropriately described. 
Validation and/or Evaluation 
The validation is based on the results of in-process tests and batch analysis of 3 batches produced with 
the final commercial process. The validation of the fermentation and recovery process was performed 
on 3 batches. The validation of the purification process consisted of 3 batches. Four batches were 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 8/80
 
 
 
 
 
manufactured but one batch did not meet a prerequisite defined in the protocol. However, this was 
appropriately justified. All the results comply with their acceptance criteria. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes test methods for identity, content, specific bioactivity, 
aggregates, purity, impurities, rFXIIIa° (Non-proteolytically activated rFXIIIa). The Tests for process-
related impurities only consists in HCP (Host Cell Protein) since validation removal is claimed for DNA 
and Nickel. Other general tests (appearance, pH, endotoxins and microbial count) are also included in 
the specification.  
A concern was raised regarding the control of purity and rFXIIIa˚ as it has not been demonstrated to 
appropriately monitor oxidized, deamidated and truncated forms. This concern was considered as 
sufficiently addressed by the Applicant’s responses and the purity/impurity profiles can be considered 
appropriately controlled; specific acceptance criteria have been defined for each individual peak in the 
finished product specification.  
As the HCP acceptance criteria is above the value of the clinical Phase III batches and a trend was 
observed with the recent Novo Nordisk campaigns with an increase of HCP levels, the CHMP 
recommended revision of the HCP limit once sufficient data are available. The data provided suggested 
that the production process is able to reduce HCP below the proposed limit which should be tightened. 
The Applicant committed to revise this limit when sufficient active substance analysis data are 
available.  
As no international recombinant FXIII-A reference material exists, the biological activity/Total rFXIII 
bioactivity is performed according to an in-house method based on calibration of the rFXIII primary 
reference material (PRM) against the WHO 1st International Standard (IS) Factor XIII Plasma. The 
latter contains FXIII in form of the hetero-tetramer A2B 2, whereas rFXIII-A exists as homodimer A2 in 
NovoThirteen.  
A parallel-line analysis has been performed using the Berichrom assay with dilution series of the WHO 
IS FXIII Plasma and the rFXIII PRM based on the validated range of the method. Statistical evaluation 
of the data has been provided according to Ph. Eur. chapter 5.3. The evaluation indicated no 
significance for non-parallelism of the calibration lines in the validated range, therefore it was 
concluded that rFXIII PRM acts like the WHO 1st IS FXIII plasma (like-versus-like). Thus, traceability 
to the international standard is considered established and the use of international units (IU) for 
NovoThirteen rFXIII is regarded justified. 
The methods proposed to monitor the substance are generally considered appropriate. 
Stability 
The primary and supportive studies were performed according to the current ICH guidelines. Based on 
the data provided a shelf-life of 60 months at -20 ± 5°C for the active substance is considered 
acceptable.  
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 9/80
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
Before the first clinical trials, the manufacture was transferred to the initial active substance 
manufacturing site. After campaign 1 the process was optimized to increase purity of the active 
substance before the production for the phase 3a clinical trials. After the phase 3a clinical trial the 
process has been moved to Novo Nordisk A/S where the commercial production of the rFXIII active 
substance will take place.  
A comparability study was conducted on three initial manufacturing site and two Novo Nordisk 
representative rFXIII active substance batches. In addition, comparison of batch analysis of seven 
initial manufacturing site batches and three Novo Nordisk batches was provided. These studies show 
that the quality profiles of the active substance produced at initial manufacturing site and Novo Nordisk 
are highly similar. 
2.2.3.   Finished Medicinal Product 
The finished product is formulated with L-histidine, sodium chloride, sucrose, polysorbate 20. The 
lyophilised powder is dissolved in 3.2 ml water for injections before use. 
The rFXIII active substance is formulated with L-Histidine to maintain an optimal pH for stability, 
sodium chloride to minimise formation of rFXIIIa° in the lyophilised product, sucrose to protect the 
protein from aggregation, and polysorbate 20 to stabilise the active substance against surface 
denaturation. All excipients comply with Ph. Eur. monographs. 
Pharmaceutical Development 
During development different manufacturing processes have been used. The differences between the 
manufacturing processes relate to the following changes: 
  Change in manufacturing process of solution prior to lyophilisation due to change in composition 
  Change in filling volume and vial size 
  Change in manufacturing site 
  Change in lyophilisation process 
Development and modifications of the manufacturing process have been made to minimise the 
formation of rFXIIIa° in the lyophilised finished product and to accommodate to the changes in the 
formulation, the change in vial size and filling height, and to the actual production site. 
The current composition (Formula C) intended for the market corresponds to the composition used in 
phase 3 clinical trials for treatment of congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. The Formula C was used 
with the active substance manufactured according to the current Novo Nordisk process, and also for 
some batches manufactured according to the previous manufacturing site campaign 2-3 process. 
The lyophilisation process was challenged in a full load extended laboratory scale study. All individual 
parameters in the lyophilisation program were systematically challenged by worst case combinations of 
minimum/maximum values. The purity and the content in rFXIII° and aggregates were not modified by 
the different worst case combinations. 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 10/80
 
 
 
 
 
The comparability of the Formula C finished product manufacturing process, according to the active 
substance initial manufacturing campaign 2-3 process and to the active substance Novo Nordisk 
process, has been studied.  
Release data and stability data have been compared for the different formulations and manufacturing 
processes used during development and demonstrated that rFXIII finished product manufactured with 
active substance from the initial manufacturing site and Novo Nordisk is comparable. 
Adventitious agents 
NovoThirteen is produced without the use of human or animal derived materials.  
TSE compliance 
The active substance is manufactured and purified in the absence of human or animal derived material. 
The cell banking system was also established without the use of materials of human or animal origin. 
Therefore NovoThirteen is free of TSE-risk substances. 
Virus safety 
The fermentation process of NovoThirteen uses animal and human component free medium. This 
minimizes a possible contamination for adventitious viruses. The cells used for production of 
NovoThirteen are fungi (S. cerevisiae), therefore no virus safety testing on cell banks and un-
processed bulk has been performed and the purification process was not validated for its virus reducing 
capacity. This approach is in compliance with current guidelines. In summary, the viral safety of 
NovoThirteen has been sufficiently demonstrated. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process mainly consists in active substance thawing, formulation, double filtrations, 
filling (by weight) into vials and lyophilisation. The final formulation is sterile filtered and lyophilised. 
After completion the vials are closed automatically and capped.  
The finished product manufacturing process is generally well described. All excipients are controlled 
according to Ph. Eur. 
A comprehensive finished product process validation consisting of process design, process qualification 
and process confirmation was provided. The lyophilisation program was challenged at laboratory scale 
by worst case combinations of minimum/maximum values for time, temperature and pressure. Four 
worst case combinations were tested. The manufacturing process has been transferred to production, 
with a process challenge made at two worst case conditions identified in laboratory scale (the HighHigh 
and LowLow combinations) and a process qualification/confirmation at set point. 
Process qualification has been performed on 2 batches formulated with active substance from the initial 
manufacturing site and 3 batches formulated with active substance from Novo Nordisk. These 5 
batches were produced with the commercial finished product process. The results of in-process 
controls (IPCs) are in accordance with the control limits. 
Process confirmation has been performed on only 1 batch produced from active substance 
manufactured through the Novo Nordisk manufacturing process. The CHMP recommended post-
approval validation and batch analysis on two additional commercial scale of the finished product.   
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 11/80
 
 
 
 
 
 
Batch analysis was provided for 15 finished product batches, including 6 batches produced according to 
the final process of the active substance and finished product processes. All results meet the 
acceptance criteria.  
Product specification 
The finished product (powder) is controlled for appearance, reconstitution time and water content. 
After reconstitution with WFI, it is controlled for appearance, identity , purity, aggregates, rFXIIIa°, 
bioactivity assay, protein concentration, sterility, bacterial endotoxins, pH, relative osmotic pressure 
and particulate matter.  
Initially no upper limit has been set for the potency therefore the consistency of the product strength 
could not be guaranteed. This was raised as a major objection in the LoQ and is considered to be 
resolved at the time of the opinion. The proposed revised acceptance criterion for total bioactivity at 
release and shelf life of the finished product is considered acceptable in accordance with the target 
range of the Ph. Eur. monograph for other coagulation factors. The limits for purity, rFXIIIa° and water 
content are appropriately defined.  
Stability of the product 
The studies were performed according to the current ICH guidelines. The container closure system 
used in all stability studies is identical to the one intended for the market. The batches included in the 
stability programme were manufactured at the intended commercial manufacturing site.  
Based on the data provided, a shelf-life as stated in the SmPC for the finished product is considered 
acceptable. However, the CHMP recommended the Applicant to perform in-use stability studies at the 
end of the shelf life for two additional primary batches of the finished product to confirm the proposed 
in-use time of 24 hours storage at 5°C ± 3°C or 3 hours at maximum 25°C after reconstitution. 
Water for Injection (WFI)  
Water for injection for rFXIII is used for reconstitution of lyophilised rFXIII 2500 IU before use. The 
manufacture of WFI for rFXIII has been adequately described. The manufacturing process of the 
solvent consists in filtration with nitrogen, filling by weight, capping and autoclaving.  
(Critical) in-process tests have been established in the production process and are appropriate to 
control the manufacturing process.  The terminal sterilisation process for sterile water for rFXIII has 
been qualified to provide at least a six log reduction of microorganisms ensuring a safe product.  
Stability results of the 2 tested validation batches comply with specification after 12 months storage at 
+2 to +8°C and 6 months at 25°C. A shelf life of 24 months at +2 to +8°C is supported by stability 
data. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information about the active substance, catridecacog, was of acceptable quality. In general sufficient 
evidence regarding the manufacturing process has been provided.  
Specification limits and analytical methods are suitable to control the quality of the active substance. 
However, the CHMP recommended revision of the HCP limit once sufficient data are available.

The finished product was well characterised. In general sufficient evidence regarding the 
manufacturing process has been provided. The method of manufacture has been satisfactorily 
described and the validation data shows consistent manufacture. Nevertheless, the CHMP 
recommended post-approval validation and batch analysis on two additional commercial scale batches 
of the finished product. 
The proposed specifications were justified based on batch and stability results, and are in general 
adequate for assuring the product quality and therefore were accepted. 
The stability program is in general considered satisfactory. The results generated during the stability 
studies support the proposed shelf life and storage conditions as defined in the SmPC. However, the 
CHMP recommended performing in-use studies at the end of shelf life for two additional primary 
batches of the finished product to confirm the proposed in-use time of 24 hours storage at 5°C ± 3°C 
or 3 hours at maximum 25°C after reconstitution. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The active substance (catridecacog) and the finished product have been appropriately characterised 
and in general satisfactory documentation has been provided. The results indicate that catridecacog as 
well as the finished product can be reproducibly manufactured.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
1.  The CHMP recommends post-approval validation and batch analysis on two additional commercial 
scale batches of the finished product. 
2.  The CHMP recommends revision of the HCP limit once sufficient data on the active substance are 
available. 
3.  The Applicant is recommended to perform in-use studies at the end of shelf life for two additional 
primary batches of the finished product to confirm the proposed in-use time of 24 hours at 5°C ± 
3°C or 3 hours at maximum 25°C. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The pharmacological activity of rFXIII has been investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies. The 
objective was to demonstrate that rFXIII has the same pharmacodynamic properties in plasma as 
those described for endogenous FXIII. 
The pharmacology and PK studies in the development program were conducted in accordance with 
good scientific principles; however, these studies were not conducted in full compliance with Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP) regulations. The studies comprising the toxicology program were conducted 
in compliance with GLP, with the exception of toxicokinetics assays which were conducted according to 
good scientific principles, but not in full compliance with GLP regulations.

rFXIII is able to crosslink 
both human and 
monkey fibrin and this 
crosslinking readily 
occurs in a plasma 
environment.  
The rFXIII from two 
different production 
strains of S. cerevisiae 
was compared and found 
to have identical activity 
in this assay system. 
rFXIIIa* and rFXIIIa° 
could cross fibrinogen 
(in absence of thrombin) 
in a dose-response 
manner (2-50µg/ml), the 
crosslinking profiles and 
dose response were 
similar between rFXIIIa* 
and rFXIIIa°. The human 
and cynomolgus 
heparinized plasma were 
shown to have equivalent 
crosslinking profiles with 
rFXIIIa* and rFXIIIa°.   
rFXIII prolongs clot-
lysis time in a 
concentration-dependent 
manner and rFXIII is 
required for the anti-
fibrinolytic activity of 
TAFI.  
rFXIII significantly 
enhanced the mechanical 
strength and the

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The ability of rFXIII and the thrombin-activated rFXIII (rFXIIIa*) to interact with human whole blood 
and bind to a variety of cells was assessed in in vitro tests. An overview of the major findings is 
presented in Table 5.  It was observed that thrombin-activated FXIII may be deposited at the 
intercellular junction of cultured porcine aortic endothelial cells and FXIII may be linked to gut 
permeability and inflammatory bowel disease. Hence several cell types were investigated.

Safety pharmacology programme 
The safety pharmacological activity of rFXIII has been investigated in in vitro and in vivo specific 
studies (cardiovascular model in rabbit and extra-corporal circulation model in cynomolgus monkey). 
Moreover, specific endpoints have been incorporated in the design of two toxicology studies (SBI 1394-
175 and NN 205255) for assessing safety pharmacology in cynomolgus monkey. 
A summary of the major findings in in vitro and in vivo safety pharmacology studies is shown in Table

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of rFXIII were characterized in single-dose administration in cynomolgus 
monkeys (0.3-20 mg/kg equal to 50-3340 IU/kg), repeated administration in rat (1-15 mg/kg equal to 
167-2505 IU/kg) and repeated administration in monkey (1-10 mg/kg equal to 167-1670 IU/kg). 
Absorption 
Absorption of rFXIII has been studied within dedicated pharmacokinetic studies (SBi-1224-175 and SBi 
1241-175) as well as within single and repeat dose toxicology studies (Table 8).

A comparison of the pharmacokinetic profiles of a single intravenous injection of rFXIII at 1 mg/kg 
between juvenile and mature monkeys showed significantly lower exposure in juvenile versus mature 
animals, indicating a higher clearance and/or higher volume of distribution in the juveniles. 
Distribution 
A subset of the monkeys (2M/2F) in study 7333-101 were allocated for the investigation of the 
distribution of 125I-labelled rFXIII in a Whole-body Autoradiography (WBA) study following single 
intravenous administration of 0.5 and 5.0 mg/kg. Radioactivity was mainly distributed to plasma and 
highly perfused organs. No tissues (except for the thyroid as could be expected due to the Iodine label) 
were exposed to radioactivity at tissue to plasma ratios above 1 at either 2 or 72 hours post-dose. 
Metabolism 
No in vitro or in vivo metabolism studies were submitted. 
Elimination 
In the biodistribution study performed in cynomolgus monkeys (study 7333-101_B), 4 monkeys (1 
male and 1 female per dose) received a single IV injection of 0.5 or 5 mg/kg 125I-labelled rFXIII.  
Urine and faeces were collected at 0-4, 4-8, 8-24 and 24-hour intervals through 168 hours postdose. 
Urinary excretion was the predominant route of elimination. Urine and faeces accounted for average 
values of 51.5 and 1.93% of the administered radioactive dose, respectively, for the low dose and 41.8 
and 2.37%, respectively, for the high dose.

Pharmacokinetic drug interaction 
A single-dose study was performed in cynomolgus monkey assessing the toxicity of intravenous (IV) 
administration of rFVIIa and rFXIII (study NN205148). IV administration of rFXIII in the dose range 0 
to 14 mg/kg and rFVIIa in the dose range 0 to 4 mg/kg administered sequentially showed that the 
exposure (AUC (0-72h)) of the A2B2 complex did not change with dosing of rFVIIa or rFXIII.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology

In study SBI 1249-175, one animal from group 2 dosed on Days 1 and 4 with 12.5 mg/kg rFXIII 
survived until the terminal sacrifice on Day 15. In this animal, no rFXIII related effects were observed 
on clinical signs, food consumption, body weight, blood pressure, body temperature, heart rate, clinical 
pathology, organ weights and gross pathology. Histopathology in this animal revealed minimal vascular 
thrombosis in one optic nerve. In all seven animals that died or were sacrificed, the underlying 
pathology was systemic thrombosis in multiple organs, which was attributed to an exaggerated 
pharmacology of rFXIII/activated rFXIII. 
Lymphoid hyperplasia in the spleen was observed in the repeat dose study NN209502 in rat animals 
and in SBI 1266-175 study in monkeys. A comparison between lymphoid hyperplasia in the spleen and 
the development of anti-rFXIII antibodies is shown in Table 11 and 12.

Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance has been assessed within repeated dose toxicity studies in rat and cynomolgus 
monkey. Generally there were no or minor local reactions noted in the repeat dose toxicity studies.  
Furthermore, two separate local tolerance studies have been performed in rabbits (see Table 16).

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment was performed given that the drug substance is a protein. The 
active substance is a natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution 
of the substance in the environment. Therefore, rFXIII is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The pharmacological activity of rFXIII was investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies by the Applicant. 
rFXIII was shown to bind to the endogenous FXIII-B subunit in mouse, rat, rabbit, dog, monkey and 
human forming the heterotetramer [A2B2] complex. The data demonstrated that rFXIII has the same 
pharmacodynamic properties as has been described for endogenous FXIII. In rat studies, the PK 
showed a non-linear profile between 1.5 and 15 mg/kg, with no apparent differences between males 
and females. The accumulation between Day 1 and Day 28 was low (<1.6 fold) and the determined 
half-life was 6-10 hours. In cynomolgus monkey studies, rFXIII was found to bind to free FXIII- B2; 
the complex had a terminal half-life of 50-225 hours, the half-life of free rFXIII was in the order of 4
-7 
hours. In cynomolgus monkeys, tissue biodistribution appeared to be predominantly in blood and 
highly perfused organs. Furthermore, the Applicant performed a single dose pharmacokinetic study in 
juvenile and mature cynomolgus monkeys. The results demonstrate a significantly lower exposure in 
juvenile animals. Thus clinical pharmacokinetic assessment in children may be necessary to further 
evaluate the need for any adjustment of the recommended dose. 
Urine was identified as the primary route of excretion of 125I-rFXIII-derived radioactivity. The 
excretion studies are considered sufficient and the results revealed no concerns. 
Furthermore, pharmacokinetic drug interaction between rFXIII and rFVIIa has been investigated in a 
single-dose study in cynomolgus monkey. No signs for pharmacokinetic drug interaction between 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 24/80
 
 
 
 
 
 
rFXIII and rFVII were found in this study. Overall, the pharmacokinetic studies in adult animals 
submitted in the application are considered sufficient to support marketing authorization of rFXIII. 
The safety pharmacological activity of rFXIII was investigated in in vitro and in vivo specific studies. 
The safety pharmacological program followed ICH S6 guidance. In vitro data showed no adverse 
effects observed at concentrations compatible with in vivo treatment (10µg/ml or less), neither non-
activated nor activated rFXIII were toxic to endothelial cells, pro-inflammatory, and did not elicit an 
immune/inflammatory response. In vivo data showed no effects in the clot growth, blood flow, blood 
pressure, and platelet counts in rabbit. In extra-corporal circulation system in cynomolgus monkey, no 
treatment-related effects were noted in the safety pharmacological battery of tests, i.e. respiration, 
ECG, CVS parameters, body temperature, clinical chemistry, haematology, coagulation endpoints and 
gross necropsy. A single dose of 2.1 and 7.1 mg/kg after two hours of extra-corporal circulation was 
well tolerated and with no apparent adverse effects through six hours of observation. In vivo data in 
toxicological studies showed no treatment-related effects in vital organs, CNS or CVS with rFXIII in 
cynomolgus monkey. The rat and monkey animal studies, NN209502 and SBI 1266-175, described the 
finding of lymphoid hyperplasia in the spleen. A comparison between lymphoid hyperplasia in the 
spleen and the development of anti-rFXIII antibodies demonstrated that there was no direct correlation 
between the two occurrences. Mild glomerulopathy was observed in the monkey study SBI 1266-175. 
However, this pathological finding was reviewed and considered as normal background finding and no 
further concerns were expected.  
Results from a cardiovascular model study in cynomolgus monkeys where rFVIIa was administered 
concomitantly with rFXIII suggest that this combination could have a synergic effect which could lead 
to thrombus and death. The results are highlighted in section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
The Applicant did not submit in vitro or in vivo metabolism studies, genotoxicity studies, 
carcinogenicity studies and reproduction studies. The metabolism of rFXIII was expected to follow the 
same catabolic routes as its endogenous counterpart and the CHMP considered the lack of studies 
acceptable. No effects on reproductive organs were noted in the repeated dose toxicity studies. Given 
the biological nature of the product, the lack of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies was also 
considered acceptable and consistent with the ICH S6 guideline. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical studies submitted for the marketing authorisation application for rFXIII-A2 (rFXIII) 
were considered adequate and acceptable for the assessment of non-clinical aspects for the product 
catridecacog. The safety pharmacology aspects in the repeat dose toxicity studies revealed no further 
concerns. The lack of metabolism, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity and environmental risk assessment 
studies was justified and considered acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the Applicant. 
The  clinical  studies  were  conducted  in  the  EU,  Switzerland,  US,  Canada,  Japan  and  Israel.  The

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
409 cardiac surgery patients 
The pharmacokinetics of rFXIII was investigated in five clinical pharmacology trials; four trials in 
healthy subjects and one trial in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency. In addition, a 
phase 3 trial (F13CD-1725) contribute to the assessment, as blood sampling for pharmacokinetics and 
clot solubility was performed immediately before and one hour after each monthly dose of rFXIII as 
well as 14 days after the initial dose. Furthermore, preliminary results from an ongoing phase 3 safety 
extension trial (F13CD-3720) on FXIII activity and clot solubility were also analysed (cut-off date of 11 
February 2011). Samples were drawn at pre-dose only. 
The main features of the clinical pharmacology studies are shown in Table 17.

Pharmacokinetics in Healthy Subjects 
An overview of the study results for pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers is presented in Table 18.

Pharmacokinetic Parameters in Healthy Subjects across Studies 
Pharmacokinetics in Patients with FXIII deficiency 
Study F13-1663 was a phase 1 escalating dose (2, 7, 24, 60 and 89 IU/kg IV single dose) study of the 
safety and pharmacokinetics of recombinant factor XIII in patients with congenital factor XIII 
deficiency (n=9, 5 male/4 female). The terminal half-life ranged from 6 to 12 days, when excluding a 
very short half-life (9 hours) of a FXIII B-subunit deficient subject. PK characteristics from the F13-
1663 trial supported the chosen dose (35 IU/kg) in the F13CD-1725 trial. The reported values for 
AUC 0-inf  and initial concentration (C0) are shown in Table 19 . There is an approximated linear relation 
between response and the 3 highest tested doses from 20 U/kg to 75 U/kg (corresponding to 
approximately 24 IU/kg and 89 IU/kg, respectively). Figure 1 represents a graphical presentation of 
the values in Table 19. The figure indicates that AUC and C0 at the dose level of 35 IU/kg (29 U/kg) 
are predicted by linear interpolation from the observed values at the surrounding dose range from 20 
U/kg to 75 U/kg.

Study F13CD-1725 was a prospective, open-label, single arm trial evaluating the efficacy and safety of 
monthly replacement therapy with 35 IU/kg rFXIII in subjects with congenital factor XIII A-subunit 
deficiency (n=41).  Blood sampling for pharmacokinetics was performed immediately before and one 
hour after each monthly dose as well as 14 days after the initial dose of rFXIII. Based on FXIII activity 
as measured for 471 monthly doses of rFXIII in the trial, the estimate of the half-life of rFXIII was 11.5 
days.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamic properties of rFXIII were evaluated in phase 3 by testing for clot lysis. 
Mechanism of action 
The Applicant did not submit studies on the mechanism of action. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
At present there are no markers that can quantitatively assess the in vivo pharmacodynamics of FXIII. 
As it is the quality of the clot that is affected in FXIII deficiency, the results of standard coagulation 
screening tests such as prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, and 
platelet count and bleeding time are all normal in FXIII deficiency. Therefore, clot lysis results from 
inadequate cross-linking of fibrin molecules is used as an indicator of FXIII deficiency.

Five in vitro studies were performed with normal and FXIII-deficient human blood. Clot lysis results 
were used in the assay.  The clot solubility assay was included in pivotal F13CD-1725 phase 3 trial in 
patients with congenital FXIII deficiency. At unscheduled visits, samples were drawn before and one 
hour after administration of any FXIII containing product. Results are summarised in the table below:

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The rFXIII drug substance used for nonclinical studies and the larger part of the clinical development 
program was produced at the initial AS manufacturing site (rFXIIIIASMS). One clinical trial, NN1841-
3788, was conducted in 50 healthy male subjects to demonstrate PK characterization of both 
rFXIIIIASMS and rFXIIINN. The outcome of the study suggests that both active substances may behave 
similarly. 
The findings of Study NN-1841-3788 (based on Berichrom technique) suggest that NovoThirteen is not 
distributed to extra-vascular compartment (Vss is approximately 47 mL/kg) with a clearance of 
approximately 0.13 mL/h/kg and a half-life of approximately 10-12 days. As the product under 
consideration is an endogenous substance obtained by DNA technique, no formal investigations of the 
elimination route are required. 
Available data from studies in healthy subjects as well as in patients suggest strongly that plasma 
levels of rFXIII increase less than proportionally to the dose in a pronounced manner.  
The findings of Study F13CD-1725 where patients were treated for up to 16 months do not suggest a 
shift in the PK of NovoThirteen over time. 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 34/80
 
 
 
 
 
 
The inter-subject variability of AUC as estimated by the coefficient of variation (CV) is moderate 
(approximately 25). 
Because the recombinant protein is similar to the endogenous protein, no PK interaction studies were 
submitted. 
Out of the five phase I trials, the proposed treatment of 35 IU/kg body weight once monthly has been 
investigated in two studies (NN1841-3788 and NN1810-3733) including healthy subjects. There is no 
Pk study performed using the chosen dose of 35 IU/kg rFXIIINN in FXIII deficient patients in the phase 
III studies. The claimed 35 IU/kg dose has been predicted from an extrapolation of absolute FXIII 
activity results obtained in the F13-1663 phase I safety study where several doses (2, 7, 24, 60 and 
89 IU/kg), were tested. A well approximated linear relation between the administered dose and 
increase in FXIII plasma activity was observed in the dose interval 24 IU/kg to 89 IU/kg, see Figure 1. 
Administration of 24 IU/kg, 60 IU/kg or 89 IU/kg resulted in absolute FXIII activity increases of 57-
59%, 105-129% and 160-181%, respectively, up to one hour after dosing. The 35 IU/Kg dose is 
predicted to have FXIII activity well within the normal range in patients with congenital FXIII 
deficiency, but below 100%, at the time of injection and maintain the activity level >10% at four 
weeks. A mean 10% trough level was targeted to ensure haemostatic coverage in all patients when 
considering the variability in bleeding tendency at relatively low FXIII activity levels. The CHMP 
requested the Applicant to evaluate full PK data using the intended dose of 35 IU/kg. 
No PK investigations have been performed in children over 6 years. So far only 9 (6-11 years) and 6 
(12-17 years) paediatric patients have been included into the pivotal and extension trial. The CHMP 
requested further clinical data in children in the extension study applying the regimen of 35 IU/kg 
every 4 weeks. The results would be an increase of patient number (doubled) and also longer time for 
the investigation (see also Discussion on clinical efficacy). 
The pharmacodynamic properties of rFXIII were evaluated in phase 3 by testing for clot lysis. Clotting 
dynamics were also exploratively assessed by thromboelastography in the F13-1663 phase 1 trial in 
patients with congenital FXIII deficiency. Coagulation methods such as rotational thromboelastography 
(ROTEM) or clot solubility test have not been validated as surrogate efficacy endpoints in this setting. 
Therefore, surrogate PK and PD data from clot lysis are considered as only qualitative data and do not 
directly support the pharmacodynamic effect of FXIII.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The CHMP was of the opinion that as no validated pharmacodynamic markers to measure the activity 
of rFXIII were available, the investigations submitted by the Applicant were regarded as sufficient. The 
clinical pharmacology studies submitted by the Applicant were adequate but questions remained on the 
full PK assessment in patients dosed with the chosen dose 35 IU/kg administered in phase III studies. 
In addition, the available data from study F13CD-3720 showed that the target level of rFXIII (10% of 
plasma level in non deficient patients at day 28 post administration) was not achieved in approximately 
5 % of patients. Thus, the CHMP considers the following measures as stated in the RMP necessary to 
address the issues related to pharmacology: 
 
To amend the currently ongoing extension study (F13CD-3720) to include PK sampling of 5 
patients at steady state that are dosed with the recommended posology of 35 IU/kg. The PK 
sampling will generate full PK profiles, with blood samples being taken pre-dose, 1 hour after 
dosing and 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after dosing. The details are outlined in a draft protocol 
amendment and the results of the additional PK assessments will be provided post marketing 
authorisation.

Patients with age ≥ 6 years and a weight ≥20 kg. Before enrolling patients ≥ 6 to < 12 years of age in 
the EU countries, 7 patients had to be exposed for 12 weeks (3 exposures) to trial product with a safe 
safety profile.  
  German sites were only to include patients above or equal to 12 year of age. 
 
In Israel: Patients with age > 6 years and a weight > 20 kg. Before enrolling patients of > 6 to < 
18 years of age, 7 patients had to be exposed for 12 weeks (3 exposures) to trial product with a 
safe safety profile.  
Main Exclusion Criteria 
  Known neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) towards FXIII. 
  Documented history of ≥ 2 treatment-requiring bleeding episodes per year during previous regular 
replacement therapy with FXIII containing blood products (FFP, pd FXIII and cryoprecipitate).

 
Treatments 
 
Treatments administered 
During the treatment period of 52 weeks (visit 2 through to visit 15), patients received 35 IU/kg rFXIII 
every 4th week (28±2 days). At each visit, the dose was adjusted according to the actual weight of the 
patient. The reconstituted trial product was administered as a slow intravenous injection (at a rate that 
was not to exceed 1-2 mL per minute). 
The trial comprised 16 scheduled visits (Visit 1: “Screening visit” at Week -4;  Visits 2-15: “Treatment 
period” at Week 0, 2, 4, 8 and every 4 weeks up to Week 48; Visit 16 “End-of-trial visit” at Week 52) 
and additional visits in case of treatment-requiring bleeding episodes. 
 
Prior and concomitant therapy 
It was a requirement for inclusion into the trial that patients receiving regular replacement therapy had 
received treatment with FXIII-containing blood products for at least 6 months prior to screening, and 
that patients receiving only on-demand treatment had received FXIII-containing blood products on at 
least two occasions within 12 months of the screening visit. 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 38/80
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Non-emergency use of FXIII-containing products other than rFXIII was not allowed during the trial 
period. In case of acute bleeding episodes, any additional treatment as per investigator judgment was 
to be according to local standard practice, and additional doses of rFXIII could therefore not be used to 
treat such breakthrough bleedings. Treatment of bleeding episodes was to be under direct supervision 
of the investigator or delegated medically qualified staff. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII in prevention 
of bleeding episodes in patients with congenital FXIII deficiency. 
Secondary Objective: To evaluate the safety of monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
  Rate (number per patient year) of “bleeding episodes requiring treatment” with a FXIII-containing 
product during the rFXIII treatment period 
Secondary endpoints: 
 
Percentage  of  patients  without  “bleeding  episodes  requiring  treatment”  with  a  FXIII-containing 
product during the treatment period 
  Rate  (number  per  patient  year)  of  spontaneous  “bleeding  episodes  requiring  treatment”  with  a 
FXIII-containing product during the rFXIII treatment period 
  Rate (number per patient year) of traumatic “bleeding episodes requiring treatment” with a FXIII-
containing product during the rFXIII treatment period 
  Rate  (number  per  patient  year)  of  intracranial  “bleeding  episodes  requiring  treatment”  with  a 
FXIII-containing product during the rFXIII treatment period 
  Bleeding episodes: Throughout the 52-week rFXIII treatment period, details of all bleeding 
episodes were recorded at scheduled visits as well as at unscheduled visits, the latter in case of 
treatment-requiring bleedings. The following details were recorded for bleeding events that 
required treatment with a FXIII-containing product: Date and time of onset of bleeding / Cause 
of bleed (spontaneous or traumatic) / Site of bleeding (central nervous system bleeding, 
haemarthrosis, gastrointestinal bleeding, subcutaneous bleeding, muscular bleeding or other) / 
Haemostatic drug used for treatment of bleeding episodes (drug name, dose and time of 
administration) / Other therapy used (e.g., compression, ice) / Date and time of bleeding 
resolution 
 
Percentage of patients having a normal clot solubility one hour after rFXIII administration and 28 
days after rFXIII administration 
  Clot solubility: At screening, at visits 1-16 and at any unscheduled visit, blood samples were 
drawn for analysis of clot solubility. At dosing visits (visits 2-15 except visit 3), samples were 
to be drawn before and one hour after administration of trial product. At unscheduled visits, 
samples were to be drawn before administration of any FXIII-containing product. The applied

assay is a qualitative assay typically used to screen for FXIII deficiency. The assay is based on 
the ability to dissolve fibrin clots that have not undergone FXIII-induced stabilization. Normal 
blood clots generally remain stable for 24 hours or more, while clots in which fibrin molecules 
have not been cross-linked are soluble within minutes. The assay was performed at the 
designated central laboratory.

In addition, overall safety was evaluated by investigating laboratory parameters, vital signs, physical 
examination and body measurements. In addition to haematology, biochemistry and urinalysis 
parameters, clinical laboratory tests comprised a FXIII Berichrom activity assay, FXIII antigen ELISAs, 
FXIII genotyping, immunogenicity assays and tests for coagulation parameters. 
Sample size 
Based on retrospectively collected data, the bleeding rate for patients treated only on-demand was 
estimated by a Poisson model. The estimate was 2.91 bleedings per year with a 95% confidence 
interval (CI) of [2.18; 3.87]. The same was done for patients receiving regular replacement therapy, 
and the yearly bleeding rate was estimated at 0.33 with a 95% CI of [0.22; 0.52]. 
Assuming a yearly bleeding rate for patients receiving monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII of 0.52 
and comparing with a fixed rate of 2.91 bleedings yearly by means of a Poisson model with a type I 
error rate of 5%, a total of 40 patients was calculated to yield 99% power. 
Randomisation 
The study was a single arm study. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was an open label study.

Statistical methods 
All patients who receive at least one dose of trial product were to be included in the Full Analysis Set 
(FAS). Data from patients that have discontinued the trial for any reason would be included in the 
analysis up to the point of discontinuation. 
The per-protocol analysis set (PP) comprised all patients completing the 52-week rFXIII treatment 
period, and furthermore excluded any patients with protocol violations that are judged to affect the 
primary efficacy evaluation. 
The safety analyses were performed for the FAS population, and the efficacy analyses were performed 
for both the FAS and the PP Populations. The FAS was the primary analyses, with PP analyses 
providing supporting evidence. 
-  Statistical Methodology 
All analyses were pre-specified in the statistical analysis plan (SAP). 
Unclear or missing data were queried. 
 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint was evaluated by a poisson model (log-link), comparing the data to a fixed 
placebo rate of 2.91 bleedings yearly. Age was included as a continuous covariate and the total 
observation time during the treatment period was used as an offset in the model. The model also took 
into account those patients withdrawing before end of trial, by adjusting the length of time under 
observation. The estimated rate was calculated, adjusting for overdispersion. The overdispersion was 
estimated by Pearson’s chi-square statistic divided by its degrees of freedom. 
Monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII was concluded as superior to on-demand treatment with 
FXIII containing products (defined as placebo) if the yearly bleeding rate for the rFXIII group, λ, was 
lower than 2.91. The null hypothesis of no difference between rFXIII and placebo was rejected if the 
upper limit of the 95% confidence interval for λ was less than 2.91. 
The number of bleeding episodes was tabulated along with point estimate and 95% confidence 
interval. 
Additional Analyses: Bleeding rate was summarised by age group (<18 vs >=18) as well as by time 
since last dose (<14 days vs >=14 days). 
  Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The percentage of patients without “bleeding episodes requiring treatment” with FXIII containing 
products was evaluated by a binomial model including age as a covariate, comparing the data to a 
fixed placebo probability of whether or not patients were experiencing any treatment-requiring 
bleedings. 
As for the primary endpoint the fixed placebo probability was based on the historical data collected. 
The probability of not having any bleeding episodes requiring treatment for patients treated on-
demand was estimated by a binomial model. Estimate was a probability of 0.25 with a 95% confidence 
interval of [0.10; 0.51]. 
Monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII was concluded as superior to on-demand treatment with 
FXIII containing products (defined as placebo) if the probability of not having any treatment-requiring

bleeding episodes for the rFXIII group, p, was greater than 0.25. The null hypothesis of no difference 
between rFXIII and placebo was rejected if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval for p was 
greater or equal to 0.25. 
The percentage of patients without any treatment-requiring bleeding episodes was tabulated along 
with point estimate and 95% confidence interval. 
The rate (number per patient year) of spontaneous, traumatic and intracranial “bleeding episodes 
requiring treatment” with FXIII containing products during the rFXIII treatment period was tabulated. 
The percentage of patients having normal clot solubility one hour after rFXIII administration and 28 
days after rFXIII administration was tabulated and listed. 
The level of FXIII activity one hour after rFXIII administration and 28 days after rFXIII administration 
was tabulated and listed. 
The number of patients withdrawn from the trial due to lack of efficacy of rFXIII treatment was 
tabulated and listed.

Conduct of the study 
A total of 41 patients were enrolled and exposed to trial drug following screening procedures. 
Of the 41 enrolled and dosed patients, 5 patients were withdrawn from the trial: 
  One  patient  was  withdrawn  by  the  parents  at  visit  5  because  parents  and  patient  felt  that  there 
were too many blood samples. 
  One  patient  was  withdrawn  by  the  investigator  after  visit  6  due  to  worsening  of  neutropenia  and 
leucopenia. 
 
Two patients became pregnant and were withdrawn after visits 11 and 14, respectively. 
  One patient withdrew after visit 9 for personal reasons. 
In addition, 3 patients were withdrawn from treatment due to development of antibodies but remained 
in the trial for safety monitoring purposes. 
The remaining 33 patients completed the pre-defined trial treatment period. All 33 patients who 
completed trial F13CD-1725 were enrolled and exposed to trial drug in trial F13CD3720. Of the 33 
enrolled and dosed patients, 3 patients were withdrawn from the trial. One patient was withdrawn by 
the investigator after 3 doses of rFXIII due to pregnancy (withdrawal criteria) and another patient 
withdrew her consent due to a wish to become pregnant after 4 doses of rFXIII. A third patient wished 
to withdraw after 13 doses due to relocation of the clinical trial site. 
Protocol Deviations 
All trial participants met inclusion criteria and none fulfilled any of the exclusion criteria. In addition to 
withdrawal from treatment or trial, the following major protocol deviations led to exclusion from PP 
analysis: 
  One  patient  received  preventive  plasma-derived  FXIII  during  hospitalisation  even  though  no 
bleeding was present. 
  One patient did not receive any trial product at visit 4. 
A total of 6 substantial amendments were implemented after initiation of patient enrolment. 
Baseline data 
The demographics of the trial population at baseline are presented in Table 24 below.  
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report

Table 24: 
Baseline Demographics - Full Analysis Set 
FXIII A-subunit deficiency was confirmed for all patients. One patient furthermore had a heterozygous 
missense mutation in the F13B gene. The effect of the F13B gene mutation is unknown, but ELISA 
results for FXIII B-subunits showed that this patient did not appear to have abnormally low levels of B-
units and that the B-subunits were functionally capable of binding to A-subunits as reflected in reduced 
levels of B-subunits and increased levels of A2B2 following injection of rFXIII.  
All patients except two had received regular replacement therapy with FXIII-containing products prior 
to enrolment into the trial, which further attests to the severity of FXIII deficiency in the investigated 
patient population. 
A total of 8 of the 41 patients included in the trial exhibited abnormal clot solubility (i.e., clot lysis) at 
baseline. The vast majority of physical examinations were rated as normal. 
Historical controls 
Historical data from the Congenital FXIII-deficiency Questionnaire obtained between June and 
September 2005 were available for a total of 92 patients. Patients were included from 13 countries 
with 1 to 16 centers per country. The majority of the patients were collected at 16 sites in Germany. A 
total of 45 female and 47 male patients were included and the majority of the patients were White. The 
reported mean and median age of the patients were 26.7 and 25.0 years, respectively. A total of 87 of 
the 92 patients included were reported to be alive at the time of data collection. The reported mean 
and median body weight of the patients were 59 and 61 kg, respectively. For the majority of the 
patients, the subtype of the FXIII-deficiency (deficiency of the FXIII subunit A and/or B) was unknown. 
A total of 39 patients were classified as FXIII-subunit A deficient, 2 patients as FXIII-subunit B-
deficient, and 4 patients as both FXIII-subunit A- and B deficient. The measured mean and median 
FXIII activity were 7.1 and 3.5 percent of normal, respectively, and ranged from 0.0 to 55.0% (n=78). 
A total of 69 of the 92 (75%) patients had a history of regular FXIII replacement therapy for bleeding 
prophylaxis and the majority of these patients initiated prophylactic treatment in childhood. 
Fibrogammin P (plasma-derived FXIII) was the most frequently used FXIII-containing product. The 
mean and median doses of Fibrogammin P administered for prophylactic therapy were 20.1 and 14.9 
units per kg, ranging from 5.7 to 64.1 units per kg, administered with a frequency ranging from twice 
a week to once every six weeks. Overall, a total of 17 of 64 patients (27%) with a history of 
prophylactic treatment and available bleeding information had experienced breakthrough bleedings. 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 44/80
 
 
 
 
 
The number of breakthrough bleeds per year ranged from 0 to 7 per patient, with a mean and median 
number of bleeds of 0.3 and 0.0 per patient, respectively. 
A total of 3 patients had never received any type of treatment and a total of 20 patients were treated 
on-demand for the management of acute bleeding episodes without having any current prophylactic 
treatment. Only 1 patient with a history of CNS bleedings had been treated on-demand only. The 
number of bleeding episodes requiring on-demand treatment ranged from 0 to 12 per patient, with a 
mean and median number of bleeds of 2.9 and 2.0 per patient year, respectively (see Table 25).

Summary of Bleeding Frequency by Treatment Modality in Historical Controls 
Numbers analysed 
All 41 patients who received at least one dose of trial product were included in the full analysis set and 
the safety analysis set in trial F13CD-1725. 
The per-protocol (PP) analysis set comprised patients completing the 52-week rFXIII treatment period 
and furthermore excluded any patients with protocol violations that were judged to affect the primary 
efficacy evaluation. A total of 33 patients completed the pre-planned treatment period, two of whom 
were excluded from PP analysis due to significant protocol violations (one patient received preventive 
plasma-derived FXIII treatment, and another patient did not receive trial drug at visit 4 (week 8)). The 
remaining 31 patients comprised the per protocol (PP) analysis set.

In the primary endpoint analysis, the age-adjusted rate (number per subject year) of treatment-
requiring bleeding episodes during the rFXIII treatment period was 0.048/year (95% CI: 0.0094 - 
0.2501), which is less than 2.91 yearly bleeding rate. Thus, endpoint met the criteria for superiority. 
There was a 4-week run-in period before attending the screening visit for subjects who were to receive 
their usual replacement therapy dose to ensure that the previous treatment did not influence the 
bleeding frequency in the first month of the trial. As the 4-week run-in period may be considered too 
short considering the maximum half-life of rFXIII of around 12 days, the primary analysis of the rate of 
bleeding episodes requiring treatment was repeated, taking into account the data collected following a 
second administration. The outcome of the analysis is shown in Table 27.

During the rFXIII treatment period (mean observation period was 322 days), there were five 
treatment-requiring bleeding episodes observed in four patients. All five events were traumatic 
bleeding episodes. 
  Secondary endpoints

Thirty seven of the 41 patients comprising the full analysis set did not experience any treatment 
requiring bleeding episodes during the trial. Age-adjusted statistical analysis determined the 
probability of not having any treatment-requiring bleedings during the trial period to 0.9581/year for 
the trial period of approximately one year (Table 28).

Title:  F13CD-3720: A Multi-Centre, Open-Label, Single-Arm and Multiple Dosing Trial on 
Safety of Monthly Replacement Therapy with Recombinant Factor XIII (rFXIII) in Subjects 
with Congenital Factor XIII Deficiency (cut-off date 11 February 2011). 
Methods 
The trial F13CD-3720 is a safety extension to Trial F13CD-1725 intended to document long-term safety 
of monthly replacement therapy with recombinant coagulation factor XIII (rFXIII) in patients 
previously exposed to rFXIII as part of Trial F13CD-1725. Overall, the design is similar to trial F13CD-
1725. 
Study Participants  
Main Inclusion Criteria 
 
Previous participation in F13CD-1725 (up to and including Visit 16 [end-of-trial]). 
Main Exclusion Criteria 
  Known neutralizing antibodies (inhibitors) towards FXIII. 
  Any known congenital or acquired coagulation disorder other than congenital FXIII deficiency; Any 
history of confirmed venous or arterial thrombo-embolic events, including myocardial infarction or 
stroke 
  Documented  history  of    3  spontaneous  and  haemostatic  treatment-requiring  bleeding  episodes 
per year during previous regular replacement therapy with rFXIII; 
 
Previous participation in this trial. (Defined as screened at visit 1): these criteria were removed by 
Substantial Amendment No. 8. 
 
Platelet count (thrombocytes) < 75 × 109/L then modified by Substantial Amendment Nos. 4 and 8 
to read: Platelet count (thrombocytes) < 50 × 109/L. For subjects who participated in F13CD-1725, 
platelet count from visit 15 in F13CD-1725 must be used for evaluation. 
  Known or suspected allergy to trial product(s) or related products. 
  Renal insufficiency defined as currently requiring dialysis therapy. 
Treatments 
All patients received 35 IU/kg rFXIII every 4th week (28±2 days). At each visit, the dose was adjusted 
according to the actual weight of the patient. The reconstituted trial product was administered as a 
slow intravenous injection (at a rate that was not to exceed 1-2 mL per minute).  
 
Prior and Concomitant Therapy 
All patients included in Trial F13CD-3720 as of the cut-off date of 11 February 2011 completed Trial 
F13CD-1725 and therefore had received regular replacement therapy with rFXIII for at least 52 weeks. 
Non-emergency use of FXIII-containing products (other than rFXIII) was not allowed during the trial 
period. In case of acute bleeding episodes, any additional treatment as per investigator judgment was 
to be according to local standard practice, and additional doses of rFXIII could therefore not be used to 
treat such breakthrough bleedings. 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 49/80
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients requiring elective surgical procedures during the course of the trial were to receive plasma-
derived FXIII according to local standard care during and after the surgical procedures. As in Trial 
F13CD-1725, patients were to be withdrawn from the trial if they received any anti-thrombotic drug 
during the trial period. 
Objectives 
Primary Objective: To assess the long term safety of monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII when 
used for prevention of bleeding episodes in subjects with congenital FXIII deficiency. 
Secondary Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII when used 
for prevention of bleeding episodes in subjects with congenital FXIII deficiency. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
  Adverse events (serious and non-serious) occurring from first trial-related activity after signing the 
informed consent to the end of patient’s participation in the trial 
Secondary safety endpoints: 
  Antibody and inhibitor development 
 
Laboratory parameters 
  Vital signs 
  Body measurements 
Secondary efficacy endpoints: 
  Rate  (number  per  patient  year)  of  bleeding  episodes  requiring  treatment  with  a  FXIII  containing 
product  during  the  rFXIII  treatment  period  (spontaneous  bleeding  episodes  /  traumatic  bleeding 
episodes / intracranial haemorrhages) 
  Number of patients withdrawn from the trial due to lack of efficacy of rFXIII treatment (as judged 
by the investigator) 
Sample size 
Sample size was partly determined by the number of patients completing Trial F13CD-1725 (N=33). 
Substantial Amendment No. 8 allowed inclusion of patients outside the context of the F13CD-1725 
trial. Approximately 10-20 additional patients were expected to be enrolled, and to contribute to the 
documentation of the long-term safety of monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII. 
Randomisation 
The study was a single arm trial. 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 50/80
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was an open label study. 
Statistical methods 
No formal testing of statistical hypotheses was performed. Safety endpoints were summarised 
descriptively. Adverse events recorded by the investigator to be symptoms related to an adverse event 
diagnosis were not included in the summary tables. All adverse events were presented in the listings 
and events related to a diagnosis were flagged. 
Number of bleeding episodes requiring treatment were evaluated by a Poisson model (log-link) similar 
to the model used in the evaluation of efficacy in Trial F13CD-1725. The remaining efficacy endpoints 
were summarised descriptively. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Subject disposition is presented in the Table 32. All 33 patients who completed Trial F13CD-1725 were 
enrolled and exposed to trial drug. Of the 33 enrolled and dosed patients, 3 patients were withdrawn 
from the trial. 
Table 32: 
Patient disposition – Study F13CD-3720 
Recruitment 
Of the 23 actively recruiting sites in Trial F13CD-1725, 4 sites did not include patients into Trial F13CD-
3720. A total of 19 sites enrolled and dosed at least one patient. The country distribution was as 
follows (number of actively recruiting sites per country in parenthesis): Austria (1), Canada (1), 
Finland (1), France (1), Germany (3), Israel (1), Italy (1), Spain (1), Switzerland (1), UK (2) and USA 
(6). 
Conduct of the study 
A total of six substantial amendments were implemented after initiation of patient enrolment. The 
protocol was amended (Substantial Amendment No. 8) in order to offer additional patients (patients 
who were not included in Trial F13CD-1725) with FXIII subunit A-deficiency participation in Trial

F13CD-3720. The trial was initiated on 21 September 2009 and is not completed. Interim analyses 
were planned to take place when all patients had been exposed to rFXIII for at least 3 and 6 months. 
An additional interim analysis covering all endpoints was planned to take place when all patients had 
completed 52 weeks in the trial. 
There were no important protocol deviations in the trial as of the cut-off date 11 February 2011 . 
Baseline data 
The demographics of the trial population at baseline are presented in the Table 33.  
Table 33: 
Baseline Demographics - Full Analysis Set 
Numbers analysed 
All analyses were performed on the full analysis set, which was identical to the safety analysis set. 
All patients who received at least one dose of trial product were included in the full analysis set. Data 
from patients who discontinued the trial for any reason was included in the analysis up to the point of 
discontinuation. 
All withdrawn patients were excluded from the per protocol (PP) analysis set. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
Of a total of 98 treatment-emergent adverse events reported, two (2) events were evaluated by the 
investigator to be possibly or probably related to trial product 
The overall rates of adverse events were similar for the two drug substances (rFXIIIIASMS: 31.1 adverse 
events per 100 exposures; rFXIIINN: 25.5 adverse events per 100 exposures) and no noteworthy 
differences in rate of any adverse event was apparent between the two drug substances.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The pivotal trial F13CD-1725 was a single arm trial in patients that were FXIII deficient. The trial was 
designed as a superiority trial, comparing the efficacy of monthly rFXIII replacement therapy against a 
historical control group that required treatment with a FXIII-containing product per patient per year. 
The historical data was derived from analysis of retrospective data from 16 patients with congenital 
FXIII A-subunit deficiency that were treated on-demand with FXIII-containing products. The trial was 
extended to evaluate the long term safety of monthly replacement therapy with rFXIII in patients with 
congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency (Study F13CD-3720) in patients previously exposed to rFXIII as 
part of Trial F13CD-1725 and other additional patients with FXIII subunit A-deficiency participation.  
Given the rarity of the condition, the trial design (single-arm), the low number of patients (41 and 33, 
respectively) and duration of both trials were considered acceptable. The CHMP noted that such trial 
could not be recognised as a true superiority trial, considering that the on-demand population was 
different than the historical data and thus could not be compared. However, the listing of history 
bleeding (type and number) did not reveal any associated clinical issue, and thus the proposed 
comparison (prophylaxis vs on demand) was considered acceptable. However, the need for statistical 
significance should be weighed against the need for clinically relevant/interpretable results (the 
guideline on clinical trial in small populations CHMP/EWP/83561/2005). The statistical analysis 
methods applied were considered acceptable.

Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The single pivotal phase 3 trial (F13CD-1725) and the extension trial (F13CD-3720) investigated 
monthly replacement therapy for prevention of bleeding episodes (prophylaxis). The trial F13CD-1725 
met its primary endpoint which was superiority over the historical group where the age-adjusted rate 
(number per subject year) of treatment-requiring bleeding episodes during the rFXIII treatment period 
was 0.048/year (95% CI: 0.0094 - 0.2501), which is less than 2.91 yearly bleeding rate from historical 
controls. The baseline age for patients who suffered treatment-requiring bleeds was 8, 10, 16 and 19 
years. When considering that the mean age of the trial population was 26 years, there was a tendency 
for treatment-requiring bleeds to occur primarily at a younger age, consistent with the effect of age 
being statistically significant in the primary analysis (p=0.022). Efficacy of a long-term prophylactic 
therapy with rFXIII will be evaluated in the extension trial, which is still ongoing. 
In the extension trial, surgeries were not part of the exclusion criteria. The definition of severe 
bleeders (documented history of  3 spontaneous and haemostatic treatment-requiring bleeding 
episodes per year during previous regular replacement therapy with rFXIII) had also been modified. In 
both trials the bleeding occurred at a younger age. There appeared to be a higher likelihood of 
traumatic bleeds in children. However, there were also two spontaneous treatment-requiring bleeds in 
the extension period, in an 8 years old child. The available data suggests that no difference in FXIII 
activity profiles after dosing of 35 IU/kg rFXIII in patients with congenital FXIII deficiency is observed. 
However, the need for dose adjustment in paediatric patients should be discussed further when the full 
reports on the already initiated investigation in young children (under 6 years) and those planned in 
adult patients become available. 
No dose response study has been performed. 
The main objective of the trial F13CD-1725 was to assess the efficacy of rFXIII in the prevention of 
bleeding episodes. In case of acute bleeding episodes during the pivotal trial, additional doses of rFXIII 
could not be used to treat such breakthrough bleedings. No investigations of rFXIII in on-demand 
treatment setting are available. Thus, the CHMP had a concern over the off label use of rFXIII in the 
routine management of breakthrough bleedings. Current practice for patients on long-term prophylaxis 
involves administration of the FXIII-containing product treatment at home and in advance of the next 
scheduled dose to treat any breakthrough bleedings. As the treatment of breakthrough bleeding was 
not part of the investigation in the phase III clinical trial, the treatment of breakthrough bleedings with 
NovoThirteen was not recommended. A warning was included in section 4.4 to inform the prescriber 
that the on-demand treatment of acute bleeds or breakthrough bleeds with NovoThirteen has not been 
studied in clinical trials and that an alternative treatment should be considered in such situations. In 
addition, monitoring of off-label use of NovoThirteen has been included in the RMP. 
There were no efficacy data on the peri-operative management of bleeding in patients with congenital 
FXIII deficiency with the rFXIII product provided by the Applicant. Thus, the CHMP was of the opinion 
that the indication required restriction from the general sense of prophylaxis to specifically long-term 
prophylaxis. Thus, the indication was modified to “Long-term prophylactic treatment of bleeding in 
patients 6 years and above with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency”. 
As previously mentioned, clot solubility test has not been validated as surrogate efficacy endpoint in 
this setting and was not be taken into account. 
The pivotal phase 3 trial included 15 patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency below 18 years 
(9 between 6 and 11 years, 6 between 12 and 17 years) out of 41 patients. In the currently ongoing 
extension trial, 11 patients out of 33 were below 18 years (7 between 6 and 11 years, 4 between 12 
and 17 years). In accordance with an EMA Paediatric Investigation Plan commitment, a single-dose

trial specifically designed to investigate the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of rFXIII in children 
less than 6 years old with congenital FXIII deficiency (F13CD-3760) was initiated on 07 November 
2010. Inclusion into a long-term safety follow-on trial (F13CD-3835) was offered to those children who 
complete the F13CD-3760 trial. So far, only 1 patient has been included as of the cut-off date of 11 
February 2011.  
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The pivotal trial F13CD-1725 provided satisfactory evidence that NovoThirteen reduced the rate 
(number per subject year) of bleeding episodes requiring treatment with a FXIII-containing product 
during the rFXIII treatment period. Efficacy has been demonstrated. However, the CHMP highlighted 
the fact that the efficacy and safety of rFXIII in the treatment of breakthrough bleedings had not been 
demonstrated. Moreover, as no dose response study has been performed in patients with the 
35IU/kg/month dose, the CHMP requested further data from the ongoing extension study (F13CD-
3720) in order to collect additional information on the 35 IU/kg dose of rFXIII. The results of the 
additional PK assessments will be provided post marketing authorisation. 
The CHMP considers the following measures as stated in the RMP necessary to address issues related 
to efficacy: 
  A post approval commitment to amend the ongoing trial, F13CD-3720, to investigate the clinical 
efficacy and safety of rFXIII in treatment of breakthrough bleedings during prophylactic treatment 
with rFXIII for one year after implementation of the protocol amendment. Any breakthrough 
bleeding during the trial period which requires additional FXIII treatment (by investigator’s 
judgment) should be treated with rFXIII 35 IU/kg in addition to the routine prophylaxis.  
In addition, the CHMP recommends the following point for further investigation: 
 
To date only 9 (6-11 years) and 6 (12-17 years) children have been included into the pivotal and 
extension trial. Thus, in children further clinical data need to be collected in the extension study 
applying the dose regimen of 35 IU/kg every 4 weeks. This refers to an increase of patient number 
(doubled) and also to long-time investigation. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety data in patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency included one phase III study 
F13CD-1725, one phase III extension study F13CD-3720 and one phase I study F13CD-1663. 
The safety data in healthy subjects comprised of four phase I studies, F13CD-1662, F13CD-1661, 
NN1810-3733 and NN1841-3788. 
The safety database also included, one phase I study F13CARD-1660 in patients undergoing cardiac 
surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass and one randomised, double-blind, phase II and placebo 
controlled trial (NN1810-3540) of rFXIII replenishment with two different doses of recombinant factor 
XIII following cardiopulmonary bypass surgery which is ongoing. 
Patient exposure 
Patient exposure and the dose levels received are present in Table 38 and 39. Concerning patients with 
congenital FXIII deficiency, a total of 50 patients were exposed to rFXIII in three studies.  The extent 
of exposure varied from a single dose administration up to 33 infusions. Otherwise, 122 healthy 
patients were exposed to rFXIII and 26 healthy subjects received placebo. Concerning patients

In study NN1841-3788, a total of 46 treatment-emergent adverse events were reported (21 events in 
15 patients after administration of rFXIIIIASMS and 25 events in 17 patients after administration of 
rFXIIINN). Of these, 3 events (myalgia, pain in extremity and headache) were evaluated by the 
investigator to be possibly or probably related to trial product after administration of rFXIIINN, and 2 
events (rFXIII antibody test positive and muscle tightness) were evaluated to be possibly or probably 
related to trial product after administration of rFXIIIIASMS. The most frequently reported adverse events 
were headache, somnolence, upper respiratory tract infection, paraesthesia, fatigue and 
dysmenorrhoea.

One AE of increased AST was reported at 8 hours, 1, 2 and 3 days following administration of 5 U/kg 
rFXIII. This event was considered possibly related to study treatment. The Day 0 pre-dose value for 
AST was not available for this subject although the screening laboratory value was within normal range 
(23 U/L). The maximum value of AST in this subject was 82 U/L (normal range: 4-40 U/L). The AST 
value had returned to normal range by study day 7.  
In summary, the most frequently reported adverse events were headache, increased fibrin D-dimer, 
muscle cramp and pain in limb. 
Adverse drug reactions 
A total of 14 adverse events in 9 patients were evaluated by the investigator to be possibly or probably 
related to trial product in Trials F13CD-1725 and F13CD-3720 (Table 21). All these events occurred 
after administration of rFXIIIIASMS. All 14 events were characterised by full recovery except for an 
event of pain in extremity (both legs) from which the patient recovered from the event approximate
ly 
10 months after onset of the even
t.

A total of 15 adverse events were evaluated by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to 
trial product in Trials F13CD-1725 and F13CD-3720. These comprised events of positive antibody test 
(4 events in 4 patients), incorrectly administered dose (3 events in 2 patients), injection site pain (1 
event), increase in fibrin D-dimer (1 event), pain in extremity (1 event), headache (1 event), limb 
injury (1 event), overdose (1 event) and coinciding events of neutropenia and leukopenia in one 
patient (worsening of mild neutropenia initially diagnosed before first trial drug administration).Of 
these events, 3 of the 4 cases of positive antibody test were classified as serious adverse events. 
Coinciding and possibly related adverse events of worsening of neutropenia and leucopenia were 
reported for one patient. The patient had mild neutropenia (neutrophil count: 1200/μL; normal range: 
2500-7500/μL) before the initial trial drug administration. The neutrophil count dropped to 940/μL at 
week 12, at which point the patient was withdrawn from the trial. The neutrophil count at the end-of-
trial visit at week 16 remained suppressed at 1350/μL.

and F13CD-3720 – Patients with Congenital FXIII Deficiency 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
For the study F13CD-1725, 6 patients experienced eight serious adverse events (SAEs):  
  One 57 year-old patient with a medical history of sigmoid colon diverticulosis experienced 
“diverticulitis” 3 days after treatment with rFXIII. A treatment with antibiotic and Fibrogammin for 
prevention of an intestinal bleeding was initiated. This patient recovered without any further 
complications; 
  One 55 year-old patient experienced “non-cardiac chest pain” and “headache” 23 and 24 days after 
treatment with rFXIII. The patient recovered few days later; 
  One 19 year-old patient experienced a road traffic accident which was unrelated to study 
treatment; 
 
Three patients experienced “antibody test positive” associated with a small intestinal obstruction in 
one case. Please see the next section for a full assessment of these cases.

In the extension study F13CD-3720, two serious adverse events have been recorded as of the cut-off 
date (11 February 2011): 
  One 12 year-old patient experienced gastroenteritis and headache (treated with ibuprofen) on 18 
Aug 2010. On 19 Aug 2010, this patient still felt unwell and fell on the staircase. He experienced a 
temporal laceration of his forehead and a wrist sprain. On 20 Aug 2010, the patient was treated 
with Fibrogammin for prevention of bleeding and for wound healing. On 06 Sep 2010, the patient 
recovered;    
  One 55 year-old patient began experiencing carpal tunnel syndrome of the right hand and wrist on 
16 Jun 2010. No relevant tests were performed. On 22 Jun 2010, this patient was treated with 
rFXIIINN. On 23 Aug 2010, the patient underwent planned surgery. No bleeding was recorded. On 
24 Aug 2010, the patient was discharged and was evaluated as recovered. 
In the phase I study F13CARD-1660; two SAEs possibly related to trial product were of interest: 
- One 55 year-old patient receiving 11.9 IU/kg experienced an anaphylactic reaction 57 minutes after 
the treatment. This patient recovered within 6.5 hours. It can be noted that protamine had been given 
shortly before the trial product was administered. This patient received also Promiten/Macrodex which 
can be associated with allergic reactions. This patient had a baseline titer of yeast antibodies of 0.23 
kU/L and a post-dose titer of < 0.11 kU/L. 
  One 73 year old patient receiving 25 IU/kg experienced soft tissue necrosis at the site of the vein 
harvesting, 10 days after trial drug administration. The patient fully recovered. 
No serious adverse events were reported in Trials F13-1663, F13CD-3760 and F13CD-3835. No serious 
adverse events were reported in healthy patients (Trials NN1841-3788, F13-1661, F13- 1662 and 
NN1810-3733). 
No deaths were reported in the two main phase III studies. 
No adverse events of anaphylactic or allergic reaction, bleeding episodes or changes in 
pharmacokinetics have been observed in any of the patients at any time during the presence of the 
non-neutralising antibodies or during the follow-up period.

Anti-rFXIII antibody 
There were four patients in study F13CD-1725, and one patient in the phase I study NN1841-3788 that 
developed anti-rFXIII antibodies. The anti-rFXIII antibodies were transient, low-titre anti-rFXIII 
antibodies that had no neutralising activity.  
- 
Thromboembolic events  
One thromboembolic event was reported. One 60 year-old patient in the study F13CD-1725 
experienced a superficial phlebitis.

At each level of classification, patients are counted only once 
Thrombin time showed a trend toward longer values with increasing doses of rFXIII. Otherwise, a trend 
toward increase in thrombin time in subjects receiving rFXIII relative to placebo was observed. 
In addition, a trend toward increase in fibrinogen levels in subjects receiving rFXIII relative to placebo 
was observed.  
Three subjects had a post treatment DVT score of 1 indicating a moderate probability of DVT. 
Safety in special populations 
Paediatric population 
Factor XIII A-subunit deficient patients aged from 6 to less than 18 years old have been included in the 
study F13CD-1725 and in the extension study F13CD-3720. No assessment of this specific population 
was performed.  
There was no data submitted in paediatric patients aged 1 to less than 6 years old with congenital 
FXIII A-subunit deficiency. 
Elderly (> 65 years) 
One elderly patient with congenital deficiency has been treated with rFXIII. No safety concerns were 
identified. 
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation: 
There was no data on fertility, pregnancy and lactation submitted. 
Pregnancy 
There are no clinical data on the use of NovoThirteen in pregnant women. Animal studies are 
insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) as NovoThirteen has not been studied 
in pregnant animals. The risk to humans is not known. However, based on the therapeutic need the 
use of NovoThirteen as a replacement therapy may be considered during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether rFXIII is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of rFXIII drug substance 
in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding 
or to continue/discontinue therapy with NovoThirteen should be made taking into account the benefit 
of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of NovoThirteen therapy to the mother. 
Fertility 
No effects on reproductive organs have been seen in non-clinical studies. There are no human data on 
potential effects on fertility. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
There was no clinical data submitted on interaction between rFXIII and other medicinal products.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In study F13CD-1725, of the 41 patients, 8 patients were withdrawn from the trial. 3 patients were 
withdrawn due to development of antibodies but remained in the trial for safety monitoring purposes. 
One patient was withdrawn by the investigator after visit 6 due to worsening of neutropenia and 
leucopenia. Other patients were withdrawn due to pregnancy (2), personal reasons (1) or because 
there were too many blood samples (1).  
In study F13CD-3720, of the 33 enrolled and dosed patients, 3 patients were withdrawn from the trial. 
One patient was withdrawn by the investigator after 3 doses of rFXIII due to pregnancy (withdrawal 
criteria) and another patient withdrew her consent due to a wish to become pregnant after 4 doses of 
rFXIII. A third patient wished to withdraw after 13 doses due to relocation of the clinical trial site.  
Post marketing experience 
There has been no post-marketing experience submitted for the product. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the two phase III studies (congenital FXIII deficiency), a total of 352 adverse events were reported 
in 32 of 41 (78%) of the exposed patients until the cut-off date of February 2011 (studies F13CD-1725 
and F13CD-3720 pooled). Of these, 270 events were reported after exposure to rFXIIIIASMS and 82 
events were reported after exposure to rFXIIINN. The overall rates of adverse events were 45.5% for 
rFXIIIIASMS and 25.9 % for rFXIIINN.  
The main adverse event reported was “headache” (32 AEs – 4.2% rFXIIIIASMS vs 2.2% rFXIIINN of 
adverse events) reported in 31.7% of patients.  “Nasopharyngitis” (19 AEs – 2.0% vs 2.2%) was also 
frequently reported in 26.8% of patients. Other AEs frequently observed included “pyrexia” (10 AEs – 
1.2% vs 0.9%), “incorrect dose administered” (12 AEs – 2% vs 0%, all with rFXIIIIASMS) and 
“oropharyngeal pain” (10 AEs – 1.0% vs 1.3%). 
No anaphylactic reaction has been observed until the cut-off date of February 2011 in studies F13CD-
1725 and F13CD-3720 but some adverse events as cough (6), conjunctivitis (1), rash papular (1), 
asthma (1) or eye swelling (2) have been observed and could have an allergic origin. One allergic 
reaction-related event has been observed in the clinical development program. As rFXIII is produced in 
yeast and due to the two cases of eczema which could have an allergic origin, a wording concerning 
the risk of allergic reaction has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC. This risk was also included as 
a potential risk in the risk management plan. Finally, NovoThirteen is contraindicated in cases of known 
hypersensitivity to catridecacog (rFXIII-A2). 
A total of 15 adverse events were evaluated by the investigator to be possibly or probably related to 
NovoThirteen in Trials F13CD-1725 and F13CD-3720. These comprised events of positive antibody test 
(4 events in 4 patients), incorrectly administered dose (3 events in 2 patients), injection site pain (1 
event), increase in fibrin D-dimer (1 event), pain in extremity (1 event), headache (1 event), limb 
injury (1 event), overdose (1 event) and coinciding events of neutropenia and leukopenia in one 
patient (worsening of mild neutropenia initially diagnosed before first trial drug administration).  
No death was reported. Three serious reports of “antibody formation” were probably related to the 
study treatment and one serious case of anaphylactic reaction in a patient undergoing cardiac surgery 
is of interest. All patients recovered. 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report

As there is a risk of clotting and fibrinolysis during sampling due to an incorrect storage, the risk of 
thromboembolic events remains of concern. This has been included in the SmPC in section 4.4 and the 
RMP. Additional risk minimisation will be implemented via educational tools. 
No events of thromboembolism were observed during replacement therapy with rFXIII. However, cases 
of increase in fibrin D-Dimer, a trend toward increase in fibrinogen levels in patients receiving rFXIII 
relative to placebo, cases of prolonged thrombin time and a trend toward increase in thrombin time in 
patients receiving rFXIII relative to placebo have been observed.  The risk of increased levels of non-
proteolytically activated NovoThirteen in case of incorrect storage is of concern as it may increase the 
risk of thrombosis. In addition, there is an increased risk of embolic and thrombotic events including 
the risk of vessel occlusion in patients with thrombotic risk. The SmPC included wording in section 4.4 
of the SmPC, for both confirmed venous or arterial thromboembolic events. “In case of predisposition 
to conditions of thrombosis, caution should be exercised due to the fibrin-stabilizing effect of 
NovoThirteen. A stabilization of the thrombus might occur, resulting in increased risk of vessel 
occlusions.”  
Laboratory and other safety variables revealed no clinically relevant findings and did not indicate any 
safety issues. 
Assessment of safety in Factor XIII A-subunit deficient patients aged from 6 to less than 18 years old 
was performed. No safety issues other than the ones identified in the adult population have emerged in 
this population. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. These were headache, leucopenia and aggravated neutropenia, 
pain in extremity, injection site pain, non-neutralising antibodies and fibrin D-dimer increase. 
Four patients with congenital FXIII A-subunit deficiency and one healthy subject developed low-titre, 
transient, non neutralising antibodies rapidly following exposure to rFXIII. No inhibitor formation to 
rFXIII has been observed in clinical trials. However, neutralising antibodies have been observed in 
pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies and this remains a potential risk of rFXIII. Long-term safety data 
are not sufficient to conclude on this safety issue. Inhibitors may be suspected in the event of lack of 
therapeutic response which is observed as bleeding or demonstrated by laboratory findings including 
FXIII activity that fails to reach expected levels. In the event that inhibitors are suspected analysis for 
antibodies should be performed. Moreover, patients known to have neutralising antibodies to FXIII 
should not be treated with NovoThirteen without close monitoring. 
17 medication errors were recorded without any adverse events. Most of them were due to errors 
during the reconstitution or errors concerning the weight of the patient.  
There are no clinical data on the use of NovoThirteen in pregnant women. Animal studies are 
insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3) as NovoThirteen has not been studied 
in pregnant animals. The risk to humans is not known. However, based on the therapeutic need the 
use of NovoThirteen as a replacement therapy may be considered during pregnancy. 
It is unknown whether NovoThirteen is excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of NovoThirteen 
in milk has not been studied in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue breast-feeding 
or to continue/discontinue therapy with NovoThirteen should be made taking into account the benefit 
of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of NovoThirteen therapy to the mother. 
Exposure during pregnancy will be recorded during routine pharmacovigilance, as part of the 
observational PASS study and in patients included in the PRO-RBDD registry with which cooperation 
has been agreed. 
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 69/80
 
 
 
 
The safety profile of rFXIII in elderly has been described as important missing information, as there 
has been limited exposure to rFXIII in this population. The elderly population will be monitored via 
routine pharmacovigilance in the post marketing period. The SmPC included the wording “There is very 
limited clinical experience administering rFXIII to elderly patients with congenital FXIII deficiency” in 
Section 4.4 special warnings and precautions of the SmPC. 
In patients with FXIII deficiency, NovoThirteen is not effective if used for monthly prophylactic 
treatment of bleeding in patients with congenital FXIII B-subunit deficiency. FXIII B-subunit deficiency 
is associated with a much reduced half-life of the administered pharmacologically active A-subunit. The 
subunit deficiency of patients should be determined prior to treatment by appropriate diagnostic 
procedures including factor XIII activity and immunoassay and if applicable genotyping. 
Patients with hepatic impairment have not been studied. NovoThirteen may not be effective in patients 
with hepatic impairment if the hepatic impairment is severe enough to result in decreased levels of 
FXIII B-subunits. FXIII activity levels should be monitored in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The AES reported for patients being treated with rFXIII appear to be mostly of low grade and 
manageable. From the safety database, there were no safety signals that were raised by the safety 
data. However, it is of note that there was very limited safety data in patients with congenital FXIII 
deficiency who have received only rFXIIINN (10 patients – 45 doses). The long term safety will be 
assessed and monitored in congenital FXIII deficient patients who have received only rFXIII at the 
recommended dose, including the elderly and paediatric patients, as part of the cumulative safety 
reviews. 
The CHMP was concerned over the off-label use of the product in breakthrough bleedings. No 
investigations of rFXIII in on-demand treatment setting and for breakthrough bleedings were 
performed. The monitoring of off-label use is covered by the RMP. However, to investigate the 
potential efficacy of NovoThirteen in breakthrough bleeding, the CHMP requested a post approval 
commitment to amend the ongoing trial, F13CD-3720, to investigate the clinical efficacy and safety of 
rFXIII in treatment of breakthrough bleedings during prophylactic treatment with rFXIII.

  “rFXIII is indicated for long-term prophylactic 
treatment of bleeding in patients 6 years and 
above with congenital factor XIII A-subunit 
deficiency.” 
  “In patients with FXIII deficiency, NovoThirteen 
is not effective if used for monthly prophylactic

should be confirmed by appropriate diagnostic 
procedures including factor XIII activity and 
immunoassay and if applicable genotyping.” 
  “There are no clinical data available on 
interaction between NovoThirteen and other 
medicinal products. Based on the non-clinical 
study (see section 5.3 in SmPC) it is not 
recommended to combine NovoThirteen and 
rFVIIa.” 
The SmPC Section 4.4 states: 
“Incorrect storage of the product after 
reconstitution must be avoided as it may result in 
loss of sterility and in increased levels of activated 
NovoThirteen. Increased levels of activated 
NovoThirteen may increase the risk of

Patient educational material and a physician 
information brochure are being prepared to avoid 
medication error related to reconstitution and 
administration (draft in Annex 10 and Annex 11). 
As a routine risk minimisation, the SmPC Sections 
4.1 and 4.4 state:  
  “rFXIII is indicated for long-term prophylactic 
treatment of bleeding in patients 6 years and 
above with congenital factor XIII A-subunit 
deficiency.” 
  “The on-demand treatment of acute bleeds or 
breakthrough bleeds with NovoThirteen has not 
been studied in clinical trials. An alternative 
treatment could be considered in such 
situations.” 
A physician information brochure is being 
prepared to create awareness among physicians 
about the indications of the product (draft in 
Annex 11). 
The SmPC Sections 4.2 and 4.8 states: 
  “The safety and efficacy of NovoThirteen in 
children less than 6 years have not yet been 
established. No data are available.” 
  “In clinical studies, adverse reactions were 
more frequently reported in patients aged from 
6 to less than 18 years old than in adults. 4 
patients (25%) under 18 years experienced 
serious adverse reactions in comparison to 3 
patients over 18 years (8.5%) that experienced 
serious adverse reactions. Four cases of non-
neutralising antibodies were reported at the 
start of the treatment in patients under 18 
years of age. 3 of these patients discontinued 
the study due to the adverse reaction.” 
The SmPC Section 4.4 states: “There is limited 
clinical experience in administering rFXIII to 
elderly patients with congenital FXIII deficiency.” 
The SmPC Section 4.6 states: 
  “There are no clinical data on the use of 
NovoThirteen in pregnant women. Animal 
studies are insufficient with respect to 
reproductive toxicity as NovoThirteen has not 
been studied in pregnant animals. The risk to 
humans is not known. However, based on the 
therapeutic need the use of NovoThirteen as a 
replacement therapy may be considered during 
pregnancy. It is unknown whether rFXIII is 
excreted in human breast milk. The excretion of 
rFXIII drug substance in milk has not been 
studied in animals. A decision on whether to 
continue/discontinue breast-feeding or to 
continue/discontinue therapy with NovoThirteen 
should be made taking into account the benefit 
of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of 
NovoThirteen therapy to the mother.” 
  “No effects on reproductive organs have been 
seen in nonclinical studies. There are no human 
data on potential effects on fertility.” 
The SmPC Section 4.4 states: “Patients with renal 
insufficiency requiring dialysis have not been 
studied in clinical trials.”

The Marketing Authorisation Holder must implement this educational plan nationally, prior to 
marketing. The final content, format and distribution modalities of both documents should be agreed 
with the national competent authority in each Member State. 
In addition, the CHMP considered that the Applicant should take the following minor points into 
consideration when an update of the Risk management Plan is submitted: 
1.  Table of contents: The hyperlinks should be corrected, e.g. for section 4. 
2.  Table 37, last row and table 31 should be aligned with the middle column of the respective risk in 
table 48, which the Applicant changed in the latest RMP. 
3.  Each reference should be hyperlinked to eCTD section 5.4. 
2.8.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
Applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The pivotal trial met its primary endpoint and the efficacy of NovoThirteen in the indication “Long term 
prophylactic treatment of bleeding in patients 6 years and above with congenital factor XIII A-subunit 
deficiency” is considered established. During the rFXIII prophylactic treatment period, five traumatic 
bleeding episodes that required treatment with a FXIII-containing product were observed in 4 patients 
out of 41 subjects enrolled. No intracranial or life-threatening bleedings occurred. 
Current treatment options for patients with a congenital FXIII deficiency include cryoprecipitate, fresh 
frozen plasma, and plasma-derived FXIII concentrate. NovoThirteen, a recombinant derived FXIII A2 
subunit protein, represents an additional choice with an advantage over the other products of no 
potential virus safety risk. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The final dosing proposal of 35 IU/kg was derived from phase III results and correlation between dose 
and response is missing. No PK data with the recommended posology was formally assessed. In 
addition, most bleedings occurred in the middle of the prophylaxis interval where FXIII levels should be 
higher than 10%. As this result may indicate the need for dose adjustment, the CHMP requested to 
amend the current ongoing extension study (F13CD-3720) in order to collect full PK-data from 
congenital FXIII deficient patients administered the recommended posology. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The safety database showed no major concerns over adverse reactions. 14 adverse events were 
considered possibly or probably related to rFXIII in the two phase III studies. These comprised 4 
events of positive antibody test (non-neutralising), 3 events of incorrectly dose administered, 1 event 
of increase D-Dimer, 1 event of pain in extremity, 1 headache, 1 injection site pain, 1 overdose and 
coinciding events of neutropenia and leukopenia. All these adverse events have been included in the 
SmPC of rFXIII. As rFXIII is produced in yeast and it is probable that the cases of eczema could have 
an allergic origin, the risk of allergic reaction remains a potential risk.   
No neutralising antibodies have been reported. However, neutralising antibodies were included in the 
RMP as an identified risk. 
Adverse events were more frequently reported in patients aged from 6 to less than 18 years old than 
in older patients: 4 patients (25%) under 18 years experienced serious adverse reactions in 
comparison to 3 patients over 18 years (8.5%) that experienced serious adverse reactions.  Out of the 
4 cases of non-neutralising antibodies that were reported, 3 of these patients discontinued the study 
due to the adverse reaction. This is adequately reflected in the SmPC of NovoThirteen (section 4.8 
“paediatric population”). 
The data from paediatric patients from 1 to less than 6 years old was very limited. Thus, this 
population was not included in the indication and information in the SmPC.  
NovoThirteen 
Assessment report  
Page 76/80
 
 
 
 
The risk of increased levels of non-proteolytically activated rFXIII in case of incorrect storage was of 
concern as this may increase the risk of embolic and thrombotic events including the risk of vessel 
occlusion in patients with thrombotic risk. The CHMP considered that the addition of risk minimisation 
measures was necessary and educational materials were proposed for physicians and patients on the 
appropriate storage, handling, reconstitution and administration of rFXIII. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The magnitude of the risk of thrombotic and embolic events derived from the increased levels of non-
proteolytically activated NovoThirteen when the medication is not stored properly is unknown. In 
addition, the risk of medication errors when patients receive their treatment at home was highlighted 
in the list of ADRs. These risks were included in the RMP as important potential risk, to be monitored 
via routine PV and PASS. However, as the risk minimisation activities was considered insufficient to 
adequately address some risks, an educational program, including physician and patient brochures, 
has been developed.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
Overall, the pivotal study provided satisfactory results with respect to efficacy (no occurrence of 
intracranial or life-threatening bleedings) and safety (no emergence of a major safety signal). The 
availability of a recombinant form of FXIII as a therapeutic option for the treatment of congenital FXIII 
deficiency was of interest given the viral safety. Thus, the beneficial effect of treatment with 
NovoThirteen in the prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with severe congenital FXIII deficiency 
was regarded as an important aspect for patients with this rare disease. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the results of the pivotal trial F13CD-1725 and the extension study F13CD-3720, the benefits 
of NovoThirteen treatment in the prevention of bleeding episodes in patients with severe congenital 
FXIII deficiency outweighed the adverse events (leucopenia and aggravated neutropenia, headache, 
pain in extremity, injection site pain, non-neutralising antibodies, fibrin D-dimer). Therefore, the CHMP 
considers that the benefit-risk balance for rFXIII in the long term prophylactic treatment of bleeding in 
patients 6 years and above with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency is positive.  
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of NovoThirteen in the long-term prophylactic treatment of bleeding in 
patients 6 years and above with congenital factor XIII A-subunit deficiency is favourable and therefore 
recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

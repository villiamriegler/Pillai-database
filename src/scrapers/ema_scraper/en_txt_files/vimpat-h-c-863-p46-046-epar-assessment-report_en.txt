1.  Introduction 
On the 27th of March, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for lacosamide, in accordance 
with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s) <specific obligation(s)>? 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that Lacosamide to treat neonatal seizures EPO149 is a standalone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study<ies> 
IV lacosamide was given in 82% of the cases, the rest enteral. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Clinical study 
Lacosamide to treat neonatal seizures EPO149 
Description 
EP0149 was a single arm retrospective chart review study to evaluate the use of LCM to treat neonatal 
seizures in tertiary care centers, assessing its safety and possible effectiveness. The primary objectives 
were the characterization of the population of newborns whose seizures were treated with LCM and the 
response of neonatal seizures to LCM treatment. The secondary objective was to characterize the rate 
and type of adverse events (AEs). 
Methods 
Patient records of patients born from 2008 to 2020 were reviewed. Chart review data was collected 
and managed using electronic data capture tools such as Research Electronic Data Capture hosted at 
Boston Children’s Hospital. 
For the collection of AEs, patients were followed for up to 30 days from the index date (first exposure 
to enteral or iv LCM) provided they remained on LCM. For the assessment of effectiveness outcomes, 
patients were followed during continuous exposure, which was defined as exposure to LCM without the 
addition of another antiseizure medication (ASM) and without breaks in administration of more than 1 
calendar day estimated using time stamps for drug administration. 
Due to multiple drug exposure and the historical nature of the data, it was not possible to attribute the 
cause of an AE to LCM unless stated at the time by the treating physician in the medical chart.

Study participants 
Patients were selected for inclusion in EP0149 if they were <44 weeks postmenstrual age (PMA) at 
seizure onset and LCM treatment for seizures was initiated by 48 weeks PMA. Neonates with a 
transient cause for seizures (eg, mild hypoglycemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia with no associated 
brain injury) for whom the primary treatment of seizures was the correction of the underlying 
metabolic abnormality were excluded from the study. The study was a multicenter effort in order to 
collect a sufficient number of patients to achieve meaningful results (only a few neonates were treated 
at most centers). 
Among 62 patients, the median (interquartile range [IQR]) PMA at index date was 
40.3 (39.1, 43.1) weeks and the median (IQR) gestational age was 37.1 (35.6, 39.3) weeks. 
Sixty-three percent of neonates were born full term (≥37 weeks). Most of the patients were White 
(69%), female (60%).  
Treatments 
Lacosamide was given to neonates having seizures. The median (IQR) PMA at seizure onset was 39.2 
(37.1, 40.6) weeks. The primary seizure etiologies included presumed or confirmed underlying genetic 
etiologies (22%), hypoxic ischemic encephalopathy (18%), disorders of cerebral dysgenesis (18%), 
intracranial hemorrhage ( <18%), infection (<18%), ischemic or hemorrhagic neonatal stroke 
(<18%), and others (<18%). Almost half of the patients (47%) had status epilepticus before the index 
date, and around one-fifth of the patients each had status epilepticus on the index date (19%) and 
after the index date (21%). The majority of patients (60%) received ≥4 ASMs before LCM; all patients 
(100%) received phenobarbital before LCM, and almost all patients (98%) received levetiracetam 
before LCM. 
The median (range) index LCM dose was 5.0 (0.8, 25.1) mg/kg. The route of first LCM administration 
was iv in 82% of patients. Ninety-five percent of patients received their first dose of LCM in an 
intensive care unit. 
The median (range) length of LCM inpatient treatment was 11 (1, 157) days

Efficacy results  
Among 20 patients, EEG evidence of seizure cessation during exposure to LCM (regardless of the 
introduction of another drug post LCM initiation) demonstrated that 45% of patients were seizure free 
at 1 day and by 30 days each. Among 11 patients, EEG evidence of seizure cessation during 
continuous exposure to LCM (without introduction of another drug post LCM initiation) demonstrated 
that 46% and 45% patients were seizure free at 1 day and by 30 days, respectively. Lacosamide 
continuation, the patient still receiving iv or enteral lacosamide at the end of the 30 days follow up 
period was observed in 53%. 72% of the patients were discharged home or transferred to another 
clinic on Lacosamide suggesting the clinicians may have attributed a beneficial effect to lacosamide 
Safety results 
The median (IQR) duration of follow up for AE and effectiveness evaluations were 15 (7, 30) days and 
4 (2, 9) days, respectively.  
During the AE follow-up period, 11 deaths were observed. None of the deaths were attributed to LCM. 
In < 11 patients the reason of death was the withdrawal of medical technology  
From the currently available safety data for lacosamide, there was no evidence of any new safety 
concern. During the median (IQR) follow up of 15 (7, 30) days, the incidence rates per 1000 
patient days for each AE were as follows: cardiac disorders (5.2), skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders (1.0), nervous system disorders (2.0), blood and lymphatic system disorders (9.9), other 
AEs (22.9) and mortality (10.6). The incidence rate by specific AEs were atrial arrhythmia (1.0), 
bradycardia (5.2), cardiac arrest (2.0), rash (1.0), encephalopathy (1.0), moderate encephalopathy

(1.0), band neutrophil count decreased (1.0), band neutrophil percentage decreased (1.0), 
eosinopenia/eosinophil count decreased (2.0), lymphopenia/lymphocyte count decreased (1.0), 
neutropenia/ neutrophil count decreased (4.1), white blood cell count decreased (4.1), other AEs 
(22.9) and mortality (10.6). None of the AEs were attributed to LCM by the treating physicians 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Due to multiple drug exposure, and the historical nature of the data, it is not possible to attribute 
cause of an AE to LCM unless stated at the time by the treating physician in the medical chart. 
• Bias: Channeling by severity may occur as patients who have refractory seizures may be 
more likely to get LCM and these neonates are more likely to have a greater morbidity burden. 
This phenomenon means that such patients taking such drugs may appear to have greater 
numbers of AEs occurring post exposure, even though none are likely to be directly attributable 
to said drug based on attribution and reporting requirements. 
Safety findings (ie, the number of AEs) in neonates exposed to LCM in specialist treatment 
centers may thus be biased upwards beyond the rate usually observed in less refractory patients 
treated at non-specialist centers. 
• Historical data: Chart extraction are reliant on the original data quality and care taken by the 
recorder 
3.  CHMP overall conclusion and recommendation 
The CHMP agrees with the conclusion of the study when it comes to the suggested effectiveness 
although it is hard to determine the effect of a certain AED, especially if it is given in addition to 
several other AEDs. The CHMP also concurs concerning AEs and think there is no need to change the 
indications applicable to Lacosamide, neither is it raising any new safety concerns. The MAH suggest 
that there will be no change in the SmPC text and the CHMP agrees with that opinion.

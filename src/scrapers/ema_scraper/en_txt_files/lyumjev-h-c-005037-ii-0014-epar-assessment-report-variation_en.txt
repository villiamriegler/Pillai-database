2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The term diabetes describes a group of metabolic disorders characterized and identified by the presence of 
hyperglycaemia in the absence of treatment. Four diagnostic tests for diabetes are currently recommended, 
including measurement of fasting plasma glucose; 2-hour (2-h) post-load plasma glucose after a 75 g oral 
glucose tolerance test (OGTT); HbA1c; and a random blood glucose in the presence of signs and symptoms 
of diabetes. People with fasting plasma glucose values of ≥7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dl), 2-h post-load plasma 
glucose  ≥  11.1  mmol/L  (200  mg/dl)  (5),  HbA1c  ≥  6.5%  (48  mmol/mol);  or  a  random  blood  glucose 
≥ 11.1 mmol/L  (200  mg/dl)  in  the  presence  of  signs  and  symptoms  are  considered  to  have  diabetes 
(WHO 2019).  
The current definition of types of diabetes by the WHO encompasses the following: 
Type 1 diabetes 
• 
• 
•  Hybrid forms of diabetes 
Type 2 diabetes 
-  Slowly evolving immune-mediated diabetes of adults 
-  Ketosis prone type 2 diabetes 
•  Other specific types  
-  Monogenic diabetes 
  Monogenic defects of β-cell function 
  Monogenic defects in insulin action 
-  Diseases of the exocrine pancreas 
- 
Endocrine disorders 
-  Drug- or chemical-induced 
- 
Infections 
-  Uncommon specific forms of immune-mediated diabetes 
-  Other genetic syndromes sometimes associated with diabetes 
•  Unclassified diabetes 
• 
This category should be used temporarily when there is not a clear diagnostic category especially 
close to the time of diagnosis of diabetes 
•  Hyperglycaemia first detected during pregnancy 
-  Diabetes mellitus in pregnancy 
-  Gestational diabetes mellitus 
Insulin  can  be  used  for  treatment  of  hyperglycaemia  regardless  of  type  of  diabetes.  In  children  and 
adolescents, the most frequent type is the auto-immune mediated Type 1 diabetes (T1D). In teenagers, 
especially  of  some  ethnic  groups  and  associated  with  obesity,  also  Type  2  diabetes  (T2D)  is  getting 
increasingly frequent (see later under subtitle Epidemiology).

Epidemiology  
The incidence and prevalence of type 1 diabetes (T1D) are increasing in the world (Mobasseri et al, Health 
Promotion  Perspectives,  2020,  10(2),  98-115).  Worldwide  annual  incidence  estimate  for  year  2021  was 
that around 108,300 children and adolescents under 15 years will be diagnosed in 2021, and this number 
rises to 149,500 when the age range extends to under 20 years (Ogle et al. Diabetes Research and Clinical 
Practice. December 6, 2021). According to the systematic review by Mobasseri et al, the incidence of type 
1  diabetes  in  Europe  was  15  per  100  000  population.  However,  there  is  high  variation  from  country  to 
country. The highest incidence (per 100 000 per annum) in children aged 0–14 years is in Finland (52.2) 
and Sweden (44.1); other European countries appearing within the top 10 of T1D incidence are Norway, 
the United Kingdom and Ireland (Ogle et al. Diabetes Research and Clinical Practice. December 6, 2021). 
The peak age of onset of T1D varies substantially. In Finland, T1D incidence peaks in the 5–9 years age 
group and in most non-European origin populations in the 10–14 years group (Ogle et al. Diabetes Research 
and Clinical Practice. December 6, 2021). 
Until recently, type 2 diabetes (T2D) was seen mainly in middle-aged and elderly people. However, T2D is 
now  occurring  increasingly  frequently  in  children  and  adolescents  as  well.  One  reason  is  increasing 
prevalence of obesity. However, even  though obesity is often observed in children and adolescents with 
T2D from Western regions, such as the USA and Europe, up to 30−50 % of youth-onset T2D cases in Eastern 
countries,  such  as  Japan,  India,  and  Taiwan,  have  normal  weight.  Overall,  available  country-specific 
epidemiology data for youth-onset T2D are varied and scant. Incidence is especially high in some ethnic 
minorities such as African American, Aboriginal, Hispanic, Asian, and Pacific Island descendants, compared 
with non-Hispanic White. (Lynch et al. Country-Specific Prevalence and Incidence of Youth-Onset Type 2 
Diabetes: A Narrative Literature Review Ann Nutr Metab 2020;76:289–296) 
Management 
Rapid-acting  insulins  are  used  as  subcutaneous  (sc.)  injections  given  prior  to  or  at  mealtime  to  prevent 
postprandial glucose excursions or as continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via insulin pump to 
provide both basal and mealtime insulin to the patient. 
The major difference of LY900014 (faster-acting lispro insulin) in comparison with Humalog (lispro insulin) 
is the time-action profile, which is shifted to the left in adult studies; hence, the glucodynamic effect starts 
earlier and ends earlier and as such resembles more closely the physiological postprandial insulin excursions 
in healthy subjects. In adults with T1D, a marked reduction in postprandial glycaemia, as compared with 
Humalog,  was  seen  when  both  were  injected  prior  to  meal.  In  adult  T2D  subjects,  the  corresponding 
reduction in postprandial 2-hour glucose was less marked than in T1D. In clinical practice, it is expected 
that  patients  chosen  to  use  LY900014  would  be  the  individuals  with  uncontrolled  post-meal  glucose 
excursions. 
In adult subjects, the effect of LY900014 taken just after meal resembled that of Humalog taken just before 
meal.  Hence,  LY900014  can  occasionally  be  injected  also  after  meal,  if  necessary.  This  option  would  be 
important  in  the  paediatric  population  as  well,  especially  toddlers,  for  whom  it  may  not  be  possible  to 
anticipate the amount of ingested carbohydrates prior to meal. In such instances, it is practical if mealtime 
insulin dose can be decided after the meal.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Lyumjev (LY900014) is a rapid-acting (fast-acting) formulation of insulin lispro. LY900014 is approved for 
the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults in the EU.  
The primary activity of Lyumjev is the regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulins, including insulin lispro, 
the active substance in Lyumjev, exert their specific action through binding to insulin receptors. Receptor-
bound  insulin  lowers  blood  glucose  by  stimulating  peripheral  glucose  uptake  by  skeletal  muscle  and  fat, 
and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulins inhibit lipolysis and proteolysis and enhance protein 
synthesis. 
The  LY900014  formulation  includes  2  enabling  excipients,  treprostinil  and  citrate,  with  independent 
mechanisms  to  accelerate  the  absorption  of  insulin  lispro  from  the  site  of  injection  or  infusion.  These 
mechanisms  result  in  rapid  absorption  that  leads  to  greater  early  glucose  lowering  postmeal  and  earlier 
offset of insulin action compared to Humalog. These 2 mechanisms include 
• 
• 
enhanced absorption of insulin lispro through increased local vasodilation due to the addition of a 
microdose of treprostinil as an excipient in the formulation, and 
accelerated absorption of insulin through enhanced local vascular permeability, which is achieved 
by addition of the excipient sodium citrate in the formulation. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Scientific advice 
In  the  EMA  scientific  advice  in  2016  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/400498/2016)  the  MAH  inquired  if  it  would  be 
sufficient to request a similar indication to the current Humalog licence, including children and adolescents, 
in  case  the  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  profile  of  insulin  lispro  after  administration  of  LY900014  in  paediatric 
patients is similar to that already observed in adult patients. The CHMP responded that clinically relevant 
advantage of LY900014 over insulin lispro in adults does not necessarily mean the same benefit for children 
using smaller volumes, with relatively larger surface areas of subcutaneous doses and thus a potentially 
different additive effect of treprostinil, and differences in fat mass and subcutaneous fat in small children 
compared to adults. Therefore, PK studies alone were not considered adequate for MA in children, hence, 
data from a clinical efficacy and safety study was considered necessary. This advice has been followed by 
the MAH. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GLP, GCP

China, and Japan 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Environmental risk assessment was included for this Type II variation including extension of indication in 
according to the current ERA guideline (CPMP/SWP/4447/00 corr2). 
The  Phase  I  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  focusing  on  excipient  treprostinil  submitted  with  the 
original MAA for LY900014 for adult indication, was provided. 
In LY900014, the amount of treprostinil in the drug product is 10 ng/U. A maximum high dose of insulin 
for type 2 diabetic patients is 3 units/kg/day. Assuming that all insulin used is LY900014 and a body weight 
of 100 kg, the maximum daily dose of treprostinil is 3000 ng, or 0.003 mg. The calculated PECsurface water for 
treprostinil was 0.000015 µg/L, and lower than the action limit of 0.01 µg/L. Therefore, is unlikely to be a 
risk for the environment following patient use. 
The sum of predicted environmental concentrations of treprostinil from use as an excipient in LY900014 
and for treatment of PAH is 0.000022 µg/L. Since the expected concentration of treprostinil is less than 
0.01 µg/L, it is unlikely that it will be a risk to the environment. Neither insulin lispro nor treprostinil should 
be classified as persistent, bioaccumulative and toxic.  
2.2.2.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
No new nonclinical data was submitted in this type II variation. This is in general acceptable but considering 
that  LY900014  includes  excipient  treprostinil  (a  prostacyclin  analogue),  justification  for  its  safe  use  in 
proposed paediatric patients was asked.  
There  are  limited  data  on  the  use  of  treprostinil  in  paediatric  patients.  Paediatric  assessments  have  not 
been required for treprostinil because of its orphan drug designation; thus, the safety and effectiveness of 
treprostinil in paediatric patients have not been established. SC treprostinil has been evaluated in children 
with  PAH  in  an  observational  study  (n  =  8).  Patients  initially  received  a  fixed  treprostinil  dose  of 
1.25 ng/kg/minute,  which  was  gradually  increased  according  to  general  and  local  tolerance,  reaching  a 
median of 40 ng/kg/min (range, 37 to 60 ng/kg/min) over the duration of follow-up (6- to 18-month time 
period) after initiation of treprostinil therapy. Six children had symptomatic and haemodynamic response 
to  the  addition  of  SC  treprostinil,  with  manageable  control  of  local  injection-site  discomfort  (Levy  et  al. 
2011).  
The amount of treprostinil will vary based upon the LY900014 dose administered (10 ng/U of treprostinil in 
LY900014),  and  treprostinil  exposure  has  not  been  detected  in  adults  at  doses  up  to  50  U  LY900014 
following MDI studies or up to 18 U bolus dose with a basal infusion (up to 16 ng/hour) with CSII therapy. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 11/134 
 
 
 
 
On average, the paediatric population will use a lower preprandial insulin dose, further lowering exposure 
to treprostinil in this population. 
The MAH provided a justification based on lack of toxicity of treprostinil in nonclinical studies, negligible 
systemic exposure in patients, and the general clinical safety profile of LY900014 for safe use treprostinil 
as excipient in paediatric patients.  
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
The safety of insulin containing medicinal products is well characterised in paediatric patients. Regarding 
the  treprostinil  excipient,  the  MAH  did  not  initially  include  any  discussion  to  justify  the  safe  use  of  this 
excipient  in  paediatric  patients  in  their  extension  of  indication  application,  and  further  justification  was 
requested and further provided by the MAH. 
In preclinical safety pharmacology and toxicity studies, or clinical pharmacology studies involving LY900014 
or treprostinil alone, other than known risks associated with Humalog and Remodulin, no additional risks 
were identified. Repeat SC dosing with treprostinil sodium for up to 26 weeks was well tolerated in rats and 
dogs.  Local  and  systemic  toxicity  profiles  of  Humalog  and  Remodulin  do  not  suggest  the  potential  for 
additive or synergistic toxicity. During Lyumjev original MAA submission, no juvenile animal toxicity studies 
were done, but reproduction and development toxicity studies were conducted. Studies in juvenile animals 
were  not  deemed  necessary  based  on  the  weight-of-evidence  risk  assessment  to  support  the  use  of 
LY900014 containing treprostinil in paediatric patients in line with the ICH S11. This approach was agreed 
also by CHMP (advice procedure on 2017). 
In reproduction and developmental toxicity studies in rats, no treprostinil-related effects were noted up to 
0.1  mg/kg/day,  corresponding  to  a  safety  margin  of  415-fold  in  comparison  to  the  clinically  relevant 
exposure (AUC) of treprostinil received via LY900014.  
No evidence of harm to the foetus or growth and development of the offspring was noted in reproductive 
and  developmental  toxicity  studies  of  treprostinil  to  support  the  marketing  authorisation  of  Remodulin 
(Remodulin  SmPC 2014) at allometric dose multiples 140-fold the maximum daily dose of treprostinil in 
LY900014 (that is, 15 ng/kg/day).  
2.2.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new nonclinical data was submitted for variation II for the extension indication to paediatrics. The safety 
of  insulin-medicinal  products  is  well  characterised  in  paediatric  patients.  LY900014  includes  treprostinil 
excipient.  There  are  limited  data  on  the  use  of  treprostinil  in  paediatric  patients,  but  the  MAH  provided 
adequate  justification  for  the  safe  use  of  Lyumjev  containing  treprostinil  for  the  treatment  of  diabetes 
mellitus  in  paediatric  patients.  The  extrapolated  total  daily  treprostinil  exposure  AUC(0-24h)  for  3 pre-
prandial doses of LY900014 containing 50 U of insulin lispro (500 ng of treprostinil) is estimated to be 1000-
fold  lower  than  that  following  SC  therapeutic  dosing  of  Remodulin  in  adult  indications.  The  amount  of 
treprostinil will vary based upon the LY900014 dose administered (10 ng/U of treprostinil in LY900014), 
but  on  average,  the  paediatric  population  will  use  a  lower  preprandial  insulin  dose,  further  lowering 
exposure to treprostinil. 
The updated data submitted in this application do not lead to a significant increase in environmental 
exposure further to the use of insulin lispro (containing treprostinil). Considering the above data, insulin 
lispro (containing treprostinil) is not expected to pose a risk to the environment.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
All LY900014 studies in paediatric patients are listed in Table 1. 
The  submission  package  includes  the  following  clinical  studies  in  which  LY900014  was  administered  to 
paediatric patients with T1D: 
•  One  Phase  3  study,  Study  ITSB,  provides  data  to  support  the  inclusion  of  the  paediatric  patient 
population to the EU Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) for LY900014. This is a pivotal Phase 
3 study designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Lyumjev compared to Humalog in combination 
with basal insulin in children and adolescent patients with T1D.  The study was designed to compare 
change in HbA1c as the primary endpoint.  
•  One  clinical  pharmacology  study,  Study  ITSA,  characterized  the  PK  and  PD  during  a  test  meal  of 
LY900014 and Humalog following a single SC bolus dose administered through injection (study Part A) 
or CSII (study Part B) in paediatric and adult patients with T1D. Study ITSA was previously assessed 
in  Article  46  procedure  EMEA/H/C/005037/II/0005.  Main  results  of  study  ITSA  are  summarized  in 
sections 2.3.2 and 2.3.3 of this assessment report (AR). 
The evaluation of clinical efficacy and safety of LY900014 in children and adolescents aged from 1 year to 
<18 years is in this procedure based on Study ITSB and assessed in Sections 2.4 to 2.5 of this AR.  
In addition, the MAH has submitted several population PK and PK/PD modelling and simulation analyses, 
which are assessed and discussed in Sections 2.3.4 and 2.3.5 of this AR.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
Quantification of insulin lispro in human serum samples 
Human serum samples obtained during these studies were analyzed for free insulin lispro using a validated 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method at Charles River Laboratories Montreal located in Senneville, 
Quebec, Canada. The assay is specific for insulin lispro and endogenous insulin does not cross-react in the 
assay. The method has been a part of the original MAA. 
Detection of anti-insulin lispro antibodies in human serum  
In the clinical studies of LY900014 included in this submission, a radioligand binding assay (RBA) was used 
for  the  detection  of  anti-insulin  lispro  antibodies  in  human  serum.  In  Study  ITSB,  the  same  RBA  was 
implemented by 2 vendors: one intended for samples collected in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) at 
WuXi AppTec (WaiGaoQiao Free Trade Zone, Shanghai, China), and the other intended for samples collected 
from patients outside the PRC at Eurofins (Saint Charles, MO, USA). Results of the assay validation at WuXi, 
including  validation  parameters  and  relevant  validation  reports,  are  described.  Results  of  the  assay 
validation at Eurofins are described in the original MAA submission.  
In  the  RBA  a  radiolabeled  insulin  tracer  is  incubated  with  sample  overnight  in  assay  buffer.  After  an 
overnight incubation, bound anti-insulin antibodies are precipitated with bovine gamma globulin and PEG, 
centrifuged and the supernatant removed. The pellet that forms is then washed with PEG and centrifuged. 
The supernatant is removed, and the pellet is counted on a gamma counter. 
The validation at WuXi AppTec included the following parameters: Confirmation of MRD, Anti-insulin lispro 
assay cut point and specificity (Tier 1), Cross-reactivity to insulin assay cut point and specificity (Tier 2), 
Anti-insulin  lispro  sensitivity,  Cross-reactivity  to  insulin  sensitivity,  Drug  tolerance  to  LY275585,  Insulin 
tolerance,  Intra-  and  inter-assay  precision,  Assay  robustness  (Minimum  and  maximum  incubation  times 
were tested) and Minimum significant ratio (MSR). 
Table  2  provides  a  side-by-side  comparison  of  critical  assay  parameters  from  the  2  clinical  research 
organizations. Validations for this assay showed concordance in sensitivity, drug tolerance, and precision.  
Table 2. Comparison of Key Validation Parameters 
Study ITSA  
Study ITSA was a randomised, 2-part, patient- and investigator-blind, 2-period crossover study in children, 
adolescents, and adults with T1D. The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the PK of insulin lispro 
following a single SC bolus dose administered through injection (study Part A) and CSII (study Part B) of 
LY900014 compared to Humalog in children, adolescents, and adults. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 15/134 
 
 
 
 
 
In ITSA Part A, patients received a single 0.2 U/kg dose of either LY900014 or Humalog on each period as 
SC bolus injection immediately prior to a standardised liquid mixed meal. The primary PK endpoints were 
time  to  early  half-maximal  drug  concentration  [early  50%  tmax]  and  AUC(0-30min).  Of  the  42  patients 
randomised, 13 were children aged 8 to 11 years, 14 were adolescents aged 12 to 16 years, and 15 were 
adults aged 18 to 58 years. One adult patient discontinued from the study. 
LY900014  showed  an  accelerated  insulin  lispro  absorption  with  a  reduction  in  late  insulin  exposure 
compared to Humalog across all 3 age groups (Figure 1 and Table 3).

In  ITSA  Part  B,  patients  received  a  single  0.2  U/kg  dose  of  either  LY900014  or  Humalog  on  each  study 
period as SC bolus infusion via CSII (single wave bolus with a standard delivery speed of 1.5 U/minute)

immediately prior to a standardised liquid mixed meal. The catheter was inserted the night before with low 
continuous  delivery  overnight.  Of  the  39  patients  randomised,  12  were  children  aged  8  to  11  years,  13 
were adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, and 14 were adults aged 18 to 58 years. Two adult patients withdrew 
from the study. 
The mean insulin lispro exposures in children, adolescents, and adults are shown in Figure 2. Numerical 
results for the two primary PK parameters [early 50% tmax and AUC(0-30min)] and selected secondary 
PK parameters are summarized in Table 3. No statistically significant differences between LY900014 and 
Humalog were observed for the PK parameters [early 50% tmax and AUC(0-30min)], Cmax and tmax. The 
insulin lispro exposure within the first 15 minutes [AUC(0-15min)] was increased by 1.61-fold in children 
(p=0.0397), by 1.38-fold in adolescents (p=0.1266), and 1.66-fold in adults (p=0.0229) after LY900014 
administration compared to Humalog.

Predose anti-insulin lispro antibodies (ADA) were very common in patients in study ITSA. In Part A, predose 
ADA were detected in all patients except 1 adolescent and 3 adults. In Part B, predose ADA were detected 
in all patients except 2 adults.

Pharmacokinetics across adult and paediatric studies: SC injection 
The PK profiles between LY900014 and Humalog following a single SC injection in children (Study ITSA: 
Part A), adolescents (Study ITSA: Part A), and adults with T1D (Studies ITRR, ITRV, and ITSA: Part A) were 
compared by the MAH. This analysis was possible as these studies used the final commercial formulation 
of  LY900014,  included  Humalog  as  the  comparator,  collected  PK  data  in  a  crossover  study  design,  used 
similar  timing  for  PK  collection,  and  conducted  comparisons  between  LY900014  and  Humalog  using  the 
same dose level. Patient demographics are summarized in Table 4. 
Table 4. Demographics for studies conducted in patients with T1D on SC injection therapy 
A  consistent,  faster  insulin  absorption  was  observed  with  LY900014  compared  to  Humalog  across  these 
parameters  in  children,  adolescents,  and  adults  across  these  clinical  pharmacology  studies  (Figure  3). 
Furthermore,  LY900014  reduced  the  late  insulin  lispro  exposure  compared  to  Humalog  for  all  study 
populations,  and  the  total  insulin  lispro  exposure  (AUC[0-inf])  and  tmax  were  comparable  between 
LY900014 and Humalog in children, adolescents, and adults.

of appearance = time from study drug administration until the first time serum insulin lispro concentrations 
reached above the lower limit of quantification 
Pharmacokinetics across adult and paediatric studies: CSII 
The PK profiles between LY900014 and Humalog in children (Study ITSA: Part B), adolescents (Study ITSA: 
Part B), and adults with T1D (Studies ITSA: Part B, ITSC, and ITRF) during CSII therapy were compared 
using  the  early,  late,  and  total  PK  parameters.  This  analysis  was  achievable,  as  these  studies  included 
Humalog  as  the  comparator,  collected  PK  data  in  a  crossover  study  design,  used  similar  timing  for  PK 
collection, and conducted comparisons between LY900014 and Humalog using the same dose (bolus dose 
and basal rate) in some parts of the studies. 
Table 5 shows the comparison of the patient demographics between children, adolescents, and adults with 
T1D in studies conducted with CSII therapy. The adults in Study ITSA were similar to the adults in both 
Studies  ITRF  and  ITSC.  Accelerated  insulin  lispro  absorption  for  was  previously  demonstrated  with 
LY900014 compared to Humalog in adults (Studies ITSC and ITRF), and numerically similar results were 
observed in children and adolescents in study ITSA Part B (Table 6). Overall, pharmacokinetic differences 
between  LY900014  and  Humalog  appeared  to  be  lesser  following  CSII  bolus  infusion  compared  with 
differences observed following SC injection.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Study ITSA  
Evaluation  of  the  differences  in  postprandial  glucodynamic  response  to  LY900014  and  Humalog 
administered through SC bolus injection or CSII was a secondary objective of study ITSA Parts A and B. 
Patients were provided standardised liquid meals for the mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). For adults, the 
meal  consisted  of  2  cans  of  8  fl/oz  (total  of  474  mL)  Abbott  Ensure  Plus®  (approximately  100  g  of 
carbohydrates total). For children and adolescents, the volume (and carbohydrate content) of the meal was 
adjusted  based  on  the  patient’s  body  weight.  The  test  meal  was  to  be  completed  within  15  minutes  of 
starting the meal and the patients were expected to not consume any further food until the completion of 
blood  glucose  collection  (approximately  300  minutes).  The  study  drug  (LY900014  or  Humalog)  was 
administered immediately before the start of the test meal in study Parts A and B. The primary PD endpoints

were change from baseline glucose area under concentration versus time curve from time 0 to 2 hours and 
from 0 to 5 hours postmeal [BGΔAUC(0-2h) and BGΔAUC(0-5h), respectively]. 
In  study  Part  A,  a  total  of  6  patients  had  hypoglycaemic  or  hyperglycaemic  event(s)  and  received 
intervention during the MMTT. Figure 4 presents the mean glucose excursions over time after SC injection 
of LY900014 and Humalog by age group. Statistical analysis for key glucodynamic parameters, excluding 
data after any treatment intervention, are summarised in Table 7.

In addition, PK and PK/PD simulations for SC injection for children and adolescents with T2D were 
conducted. No clinical studies were conducted in paediatric patients with T2D. 
For the PPK models, disposition parameter estimates were fixed to the values estimated for intravenously 
injected  LY900014  in  healthy  adult  subjects  (n=27;  see  PPK  model  for  adults,  SC  injection).  The  PK/PD 
models  utilized  the  Integrated  Glucose-Insulin  (IGI)  model  developed  for  characterizing  the  mechanistic 
feedback relationship between insulin and glucose.

ITRV and I8B-MC-ITRW (Approval date 15-Feb-2019) 
The  adult  population  PK  model  for  insulin  lispro  was  developed  using  data  from  8  clinical  pharmacology 
studies with frequent PK sampling. A total of 18957 insulin lispro concentration-time data points from 338 
subjects (149 healthy subjects, 115 T1D subjects, and 74 T2D subjects; age from 18 to 77 years and weight 
between 48.6 and 141.5 kg) were included in the analysis. It was assumed that once insulin lispro (the 
active  ingredient  in  LY900014  and  Humalog)  is  absorbed  into  the  systemic  circulation,  the  disposition 
parameters are the same for the two products. The model was developed in 3 steps as follows. 
Model A: Disposition model for the absolute clearance and distribution parameters of insulin lispro. Data 
following  IV  injection  of  LY900014  in  healthy  subjects  (n=27;  study  ITRT)  was  used.  A  3-compartment 
disposition model provided the best description of the data. Fixed allometric exponents (0.75 for clearances; 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 28/134 
 
 
 
 
1.0 for volumes) were used; estimated exponents were tested but they did not improve the model. Inter-
individual  variability  (IIV)  could  be  estimated  in  all  of  the  disposition  parameters  with  good  precision 
(relative standard error [%RSE] ≤16.4% for all parameters). The typical CL of insulin lispro was 28.6 L/h 
(IIV 12.4%), the central volume (V2) was 4.73 L (IIV 6.2%), the peripheral volume 1 (V3) was 1.49 L (IIV 
24.6%), and the peripheral volume 2 (V4) was 2.0 L (IIV 8.1%).  
Model B: SC absorption characteristics of LY900014. The structural model for insulin lispro following IV and 
SC injection of LY900014 in healthy subjects and patients with T1D and T2D was developed. A combined 
zero-order and first-order absorption model incorporating a transit compartment best described the insulin 
lispro  absorption  following  SC  administration  of  LY900014  (Figure  6).  In  addition  to  the  absorption 
parameters, the central volume of distribution for SC administration (V2_SC) had to be estimated to address 
model  misspecification  observed  in  goodness-of-fit  plots.  The  estimated  central  volume  was  larger  and 
more variable following SC injection than following IV injection.  
Figure 6. Insulin Lispro Structural PK Model following IV and SC injection. 
Vx = volume of distribution for compartment x; CL = clearance; Qx = intercompartmental clearance for compartment x; 
kxy = first-order rate constant from compartment x to y; IV = intravenous; SC = subcutaneous; FR = fraction;  
fo = first-order; BIO = bioavailability; ktr = transit rate constant; ka = first-order absorption constant. 
Model C: Formulation and population effects. Once the structural and statistical model was established for 
IV and SC LY900014, the effects of treatment (LY900014 vs Humalog) and population differences (patients 
with T1D vs T2D vs healthy) were assessed on the absorption of insulin lispro and added in the structural 
model. A faster absorption of insulin lispro after SC administration of LY900014 compared to Humalog was 
observed in the clinical studies in all populations. This was best described in the model by adding treatment 
differences  in  fraction  absorbed  via  transit  compartments  and  first-order  absorption  rate  constant. 
Population effects in the final model were included on absorption rate constant, central volume following 
SC administration, and bioavailability. Parameter estimates for the final population PK model are shown in 
Table 8. The interpretation of clinically relevant differences is summarised in Table 9.

Furthermore, the effect of baseline anti-insulin lispro antibodies  (ADA) on insulin lispro PK was explored 
using  Model  C.  Baseline  ADA  were  detected  in  24%  of  subjects  (1.3%  of  healthy  subjects,  45%  of  T1D 
patients and 35% of T2D patients). A statistically significant increase of 16.5% in the insulin lispro clearance 
was estimated for subjects and patients with ADA detected at baseline. The ADA covariate on clearance 
was not added in the final PPK model, however. The grounds for this decision were that because insulins 
are individually dosed, the change in clearance was not expected to produce clinically meaningful difference 
in glycaemic control.  
Population PK: Study ITSA, SC injection 
Multiple Daily Injection (MDI) Pediatric/Adult Population Pharmacokinetic and Pharmacodynamic Analyses 
of Study I8B-MC-ITSA (Part A) (Approval Date: 21-Oct-2021) 
13 children (8 to < 12 years), 14 adolescents (12 to < 18 years), and 15 adults with T1D participated in 
study ITSA Part A. A total of 1428 samples from 42 patients were used in the PPK model analysis. 
The prior adult PPK model for SC injection was initially tested.  
The  PPK  model  for  children,  adolescents,  and  adults  with  T1D  in  Study  ITSA  was  optimized:  First,  the 
differences  between  adult  healthy  subject’s  estimates  and  those  for  the  patients  with  T1D  (children, 
adolescents, and adults) in Study ITSA were estimated for the previously identified population covariates: 
SC  bioavailability,  zero-order  duration  of  absorption,  first-order  absorption  rate,  and  central  volume  of 
distribution.  Subsequently,  the  difference  between  the  first-order  absorption  of  LY900014  and  Humalog 
was  estimated.  Lastly,  the  allometric  scaling  coefficients  for  clearance  and  volume  parameters  were 
estimated. The model parameters are summarized in Table 10 and the VPCs are shown in Figure 7.

ITRF and I8B-MC-ITSC (Approval date 18-Jun-2020) 
Background: Study ITRF was a single-site, 4-period, patient- and investigator-blind, randomized, replicate 
crossover  study  in  adult  patients  with  T1D  to  evaluate  the  insulin  lispro  PK  and  PD  characteristics  of 
LY900014  compared  to  Humalog  with  CSII  therapy  over  a  3-day  catheter  duration  via  an  insulin  pump 
(Accu-Chek® Spirit; Roche). Each patient was randomized to 1 of 6 treatment sequences. Each sequence 
consisted  of  four,  3-day  treatment  periods  comprising  CSII  of  LY900014  or  Humalog.  All  insulin  lispro 
boluses were delivered with the rapid pump speed (RS) of 12 U/min as single-wave bolus given at the start 
of the meal. Anti-insulin lispro antibodies were detected in 19 patients at baseline.

Study  ITSC  was  a  single-site,  4-period,  patient-  and  investigator-blind,  randomized,  crossover  study  in 
adult patients with T1D to evaluate the insulin lispro PK and PD characteristics of LY900014 to Humalog 
during CSII therapy over a 3-day catheter duration via an insulin pump (Medtronic 640G). Insulin lispro 
boluses were delivered as a single-wave or dual-wave bolus delivery (50% of dose as a single-wave bolus 
and the remaining 50% infused as a square-wave over 3 hours) with standard (1.5 U/min) bolus delivery 
speed (SS). Anti-insulin lispro antibodies were detected in 15 patients at baseline. 
In  both  studies,  the  PK  and  PD  samples  were  collected  over  5  hours  following  an  individualized  solid 
breakfast test meal. A total of 6746 insulin lispro concentrations from 54 patients were included in the PPK 
analysis. 
Disposition parameters of the prior structural PK model developed for SC injection therapy (see Figure 8 
and Table 11) were applied to the insulin lispro CSII PPK model. The basal insulin was modelled as a zero-
order infusion with fixed disposition parameter estimates, except for the central volume of distribution that 
was estimated together with the prandial insulin data. For prandial insulin, all absorption parameters and 
central  volume  of  distribution  were  estimated.  To  account  for  the  observed  differences  in  the  rate  of 
absorption of LY900014 vs. Humalog, pump delivery speed (rapid speed (RS) vs. standard speed (SS)), 
and catheter dwell time (Day 1 vs. Day 3), separate ka with interindividual variability was estimated with 
the following discrete categories: 
• 
LY900014 on Day 1 for Study ITSC (SS) 
•  Humalog on Day 1 for Study ITSC (SS) 
• 
LY900014 on Day 3 for Study ITSC (SS) 
•  Humalog on Day 3 for Study ITSC (SS) 
• 
LY900014 on Day 1 for Study ITRF (RS) 
•  Humalog on Day 1 for Study ITRF (RS) 
• 
LY900014 on Day 3 for Study ITRF (RS) 
•  Humalog on Day 3 for Study ITRF (RS) 
Graphical analyses of the individual parameter estimates and random effects did not identify any additional 
covariate relationships to evaluate in the PK model. The final model parameter estimates are summarized 
in Table 12.  Prediction- and variability-corrected VPCs (500 simulated datasets) indicated adequate model 
fit to the observed data (Figure 9).

LY900014  and  Humalog  were  administered  via  a  single  wave  bolus  with  a  standard  delivery  speed 
(1.5 U/minute)  in  study  ITSA  Part  B.  PK  data  were  available  from  12  children  (8  to  <  12  years), 
13 adolescents (12 to < 18 years), and 12 adults with T1D in study ITSA Part B. A total of 1296 samples 
from 37 patients were used in the PPK model analysis. 
Based  on  the  PPK  model  optimization  for  Study  ITSA  Part  A  (see  above),  PK  parameters  for  SC 
bioavailability, zero-order duration of absorption, first-order absorption rate, fraction absorbed via transit 
compartments,  mean  transit  time,  and  central  volume  of  distribution  were  estimated  for  children, 
adolescents,  and  adults  with  T1D  in  Study  ITSA  Part  B.  Lastly,  the  allometric  scaling  coefficients  for 
clearance and volume parameters were estimated. The model parameters are summarized in Table 12 and

ITRV and I8B-MC-ITRW (Approval date 15-Feb-2019) 
A sequential PK/PD modelling approach was used to analyze the postprandial glucose response after a liquid 
test meal in adult patients with T1D (Study ITRV) and T2D (Study ITRW). See above for description of the 
population PK model utilized in these analyses. The individual PK parameters from the final insulin lispro 
PK  model  were  merged  with  the  PD  dataset  to  predict  the  time  course  of  insulin  concentrations  for  the 
exposure-response modelling. 
The relationship between LY900014 and Humalog administration, insulin concentrations in serum, and the 
corresponding  effect  on  glucose  concentrations  was  evaluated  using  an  exposure-response  model  that

utilizes  the  Integrated  Glucose-Insulin  (IGI)  model.  The  IGI  model  is  a  (semi)mechanistic  PK/PD  model 
initially  developed  using  data  from  T2D  patients  and  healthy  subjects  undergoing  intravenous  and  oral 
glucose tolerance tests. Subsequently, gastric emptying and intestinal transit times have been incorporated 
in the model. In brief, the model incorporates the effects of endogenous glucose and insulin (the stimulatory 
effect of glucose on insulin production; the stimulatory effect of insulin on glucose elimination; the inhibitory 
effect  of  glucose  and  insulin  on  hepatic  glucose  production;  the  glucose  absorbed  into  the  body  was 
calculated  from  carbohydrate  contents  in  the  meals).  The  IGI  model  was  linked  to  a  model  for  small 
intestinal transit through the stomach, duodenum and ileum that incorporated inhibition of gastric emptying 
by glucose, and saturable absorption of glucose through the epithelium to account for gastric emptying and 
glucose absorption. Additionally, the exogenous insulin effect on glucose clearance was described using a 
nonlinear (sigmoidal Emax model) relationship between insulin and insulin-dependent glucose clearance. 
The base structure of the IGI model for T1D and T2D are shown in Figures 5.3.4.6 and 5.3.4.7, respectively.  
Parameter estimates of the final optimized IGI model for T1D and T2D are summarized in Tables 5.3.4.6

PK/PD model: PPG after liquid test meal, Study ITSA, SC injection 
The final optimized PK/PD model for adults with T1D (Study ITRV) was tested first. The model was then 
optimized using the glucose data only from the adults in Study ITSA Part A (n = 14) to address any study 
differences between Studies ITRV and ITSA.  
In  the  optimized  adult  model  for  study  ITSA  Part  A,  the  KWpre,  DUOKM,  KMGLU,  EC50,  HILL,  and  CLGI 
parameter  values  were  estimated  simultaneously,  as  well  as  the  IIV  for  DUOKM,  CLGI,  and  the  residual 
variability. The VPCs for LY900014 and Humalog in adults showed good agreement between the median of 
the observed and median of the simulated glucose concentrations (Figure 12). However, even the optimized 
adult ITSA Part A model underpredicted the glucose concentrations observed in Study ITSA Part A for the 
children  and  adolescents  (Figures  5.3.4.10  and  5.3.4.11,  respectively).  The  model  was  considered  to 
describe  the  data  well  and  no  further  model  development  conducted.  The  final  model  parameters  are 
summarized in Table  15.

Simulations for paediatric and adult patients with T2D 
The  previously  developed  PK/PD  model  for  adults  with  T2D  (Study  ITRW)  was  adjusted  based  on  the 
changes made between the PK/PD model in adult patients with T1D and the final optimized PK/PD model

for adults, children, and adolescents with T1D in Study ITSA Part A. This paediatric/adult T2D PK/PD model 
was used to simulate glucose time course following a liquid MMTT when either LY900014 or Humalog was 
administered immediately prior or 20 minutes after the start of the test meal. The simulated PPG curves 
indicated  less  pronounced  postprandial  glucose  excursion  with  LY900014  compared  to  Humalog  (Figure 
15).

immediately prior (top) and 20 minutes after (bottom) the start of the meal in children (left), adolescents 
(middle), and adults (right) with T2D. 
PK/PD model: PPG after liquid test meal, Study ITSA, CSII 
A PK/PD model for adults with T1D on CSII therapy (studies ITRF and ITSC) was previously developed but 
was not applicable for study ITSA Part B because the test meal in studies ITRF and ITSC was solid whereas 
liquid test meal was used in study ITSA. Therefore, PK/PD models following a liquid test meal developed 
for T1D patients on SC injections therapy (adults: study ITRV; adults and paediatric: study ITSA Part A) 
were utilized. 
First, all IGI model parameters were fixed to estimates for adult T1D model from Study ITRV. The VPCs 
indicated that the model underpredicted the glucose concentrations observed in Study ITSA Part B. Next, 
all IGI model parameters were fixed to the estimates for the model optimized for study ITSA Part A. The 
VPCs indicated that the latter model better described the glucose concentrations observed in study ITSA 
Part B.  
The  parameter  estimates  for  the  final  optimized  model  are  provided  in  Table  16.  The  VPCs  for  the  final 
PK/PD model for study ITSA Part B are shown in Figure 16.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalytics 
The  bioanalytical  methods  used  in  the  clinical  studies  of  LY900014  included  in  this  submission  have,  in 
general,  been  appropriately  described  and  validated  according  to  relevant  guidance.  Most  of  the  used 
analytical methods have been a part of previous (and/or the original) submissions. 
In  the  clinical  study  ITSB  included  in  this  submission,  the  same  radioligand  binding  assay  used  for  the 
detection of anti-insulin lispro antibodies in human serum was implemented by 2 vendors: one intended for 
samples collected in the People’s Republic of China (PRC) at WuXi AppTec (WaiGaoQiao Free Trade Zone, 
Shanghai, China), and the other intended for samples collected from patients outside the PRC at Eurofins 
(Saint Charles, MO, USA). The assay validation at Eurofins was part of the original MAA submission and has 
been discussed at the time.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 51/134 
 
 
 
 
 
An appropriate validation of the method at WuXi AppTec was provided in this submission. The validation 
covered relevant parameters and the method at WuXi AppTec can be considered acceptable for the intended 
purpose.  It  seems  that  no  actual  comparability  evaluation  of  assay  performance  was  performed  by  e.g. 
analysis of the same samples at both facilities, however, comparison of key validation parameters at WuXi 
AppTec (new vendor) and at Eurofins (old vendor) indicates that the RBA assay performs similarly at both 
facilities.   
Observed PK and PD in paediatric patients 
PK and PD data were collected in a limited number (n = 12 to 14) of children (8 to 11 years) and adolescents 
(12 to 17 years) with T1D following a single SC injection and CSII bolus infusion in study ITSA Part A and 
Part B, respectively. In the phase 3 study ITSB, it was not feasible to collect PK data due to rapid elimination 
of insulin lispro.  
Overall, the PK data from study ITSA and prior studies in adults demonstrate that following a SC injection, 
the early insulin lispro exposure parameters (e.g. AUC[0-30min], AUC[0-1h]) were higher with LY900014 
compared to Humalog, indicating faster absorption, and the total exposure (AUC[0-inf]) was comparable. 
There appeared to be lower early PPG excursion with LY900014 compared to Humalog when insulin lispro 
was administered for children and adolescents as SC injection with significant reductions in PPG response 
over 2 hrs (BGΔAUC[0-2h]) in children and adolescents, but no statistically significant difference between 
the study drugs was demonstrated over the complete 5-hour test meal period in study ITSA Part A. 
Following  a  CSII  bolus  infusion  administrated  via  insulin  pump  (ITSA  Part  B),  the  very  early  exposure 
parameters (AUC[0-15min] AUC[0-30min]) suggested slightly faster absorption with LY900014 compared 
to Humalog in children, adolescents and adults, but the differences were not statistically significant for the 
primary PK endpoints. The PPG excursions following a liquid test meal and CSII bolus infusion were similar 
for  LY900014  and  Humalog  in  children,  adolescents,  and  adults. It  is  difficult to  compare  the  results  for 
different studies using CSII bolus infusion (i.e. ITSA Part B and prior studies in adults), because different 
insulin doses and infusion rates and test meals were used in the studies. 
PK and PK/PD modelling 
The population PK and PK/PD modelling conducted by the MAH are considered supplementary information 
for the current application; Refer to section 3 Benefit-Risk Balance of this AR. Main issues related to the 
models are briefly presented below, but no questions are raised on issues related to PK and PK/PD models. 
Overall,  the  submitted  modelling  reports  for  paediatric  and  adult  patients  in  study  ITSA  were  cursory 
compared with the prior models for studies conducted in adults. 
Population PK models 
The first insulin lispro population PK model was for administration via IV and SC injection. The model was 
based on 8 clinical pharmacology studies with frequent sampling and a total of 338 adult subjects. Model 
development started with establishing a 3-compartment disposition model with clearance from the central 
compartment.  The  disposition  model  was  based  on  data  observed  after  IV  injection  and  the  parameter 
estimates  were  fixed  in  the  subsequent  models.  Next,  absorption  model  (a  mixed  zero-  and  first-order 
absorption)  following  SC  injection  of  LY900014  was  added  and,  subsequently,  the  effects  of  treatment 
(LY900014 vs Humalog) and population differences (patients with T1D vs T2D vs healthy) were assessed 
on the absorption of insulin lispro. Finally, it was estimated that subjects with anti-insulin lispro antibodies 
(ADA) had increased insulin lispro clearance (+16.5%); this effect was statistically significant. However, 
the effect of ADA on insulin lispro kinetics was not included in the final model. The MAH’s grounds for this 
decision were that because insulins are individually dosed, the change in clearance was not expected to 
produce clinically meaningful difference in glycaemic control.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 52/134 
 
 
 
 
The prior adult PPK model for SC injection overpredicted the insulin lispro concentrations in the elimination 
phase for children and adolescents from study ITSA Part A. Surprisingly, it was not shown whether the prior 
adult PPK model was able to characterize the PK in adults from study ITSA Part A. Importantly, in study 
ITSA  Part  A  the  proportion  of  ADA  positive  subjects  was  very  high  [13/13  (100%)  in  children,  13/14 
(92.9%) in adolescents, and 12/15 (80%) in adults] compared with the proportion of ADA+ subjects in the 
prior  adult  dataset  (24%).  Some  model  parameters  were  re-estimated,  which  improved  the  fit  to  some 
extent. At present, the MAH has one PPK model for SC injection in adults based on relatively large dataset 
(the prior model) and another for adults and paediatric patients (8 to 17 years) based on a relatively small 
dataset (ITSA Part A). It would be preferable to have a joint model. 
A  population  PK  model  for  CSII  bolus  infusion  was  developed  by  utilizing  the  prior  3-compartment 
disposition model and estimating the absorption kinetics with data from adult studies ITRF and ITSC. The 
VPC plots indicated that the model overpredicted insulin lispro concentrations for adults in study ITSA Part 
B during the very early absorption phase as well as at the elimination phase. It seems that for the CSII 
model it was appropriate to re-estimate at least some absorption parameters. This may be attributed to 
the prolonged duration of administration with CSII. For SC injections, the dose will always be administered 
over a few seconds. Furthermore, the cannula of an insulin pump is more complex than a SC needle, which 
might add further differences between studies in which different insulin pumps may have been used. It is 
known that the dwelling time of the insulin pump cannula has significant effect on the absorption kinetics. 
As  with  SC  injection,  the  MAH  presently  has  two  population  PK  models  for CSII  bolus  infusion  based  on 
different datasets. It would be preferable to have a joint model, but this may be more difficult to achieve 
for CSII administration.  
PK/PD models 
A sequential PK/PD modelling approach was used to analyze the postprandial glucose response after a test 
meal.  The  relationship  between  LY900014  and  Humalog  administration,  insulin  concentrations  in  serum 
predicted by a population PK model, and the corresponding effect on glucose concentrations was evaluated 
using an exposure-response model that utilized a mechanistic Integrated Glucose-Insulin (IGI) model.  
A PK/PD model was initially developed for adult T1D patients with data from study ITRV (SC injection, liquid 
test  meal).  Interestingly,  it  seems  that  the  effect  of  insulin  on  endogenous  glucose  production  was  not 
included in the IGI model for T1D patients whereas it was included for T2D patients. The rationale for this 
was not discussed in the modelling report. This model failed to predict postprandial glucose levels in a new 
population  (adults  from  study  ITSA  Part  A).  It  was  necessary  to  re-estimate  several  parameters 
characterizing gastric emptying, glucose absorption and glucose disposition to achieve a model that was 
able to characterize the glucose response observed in study ITSA Part A.  
Overall, the presented modelling exercises in adult and paediatric patients to characterize the exposure-
response relationship between insulin lispro concentration and postprandial glucose response highlight the 
several  challenges  of  the  task.  Even  in  adult  patients  with  T1D,  the  PK/PD  model  developed  in  one 
population  (study  ITRV)  failed  to  characterize  the  postprandial  glucose  excursion  in  another  population 
(study ITSA Part A). Extrapolation of the insulin-glucose PK/PD model for study ITSA Part A to patients with 
T2D is expected to be very challenging and the presented simulations should be interpreted very cautiously.    
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Observed PK data in study ITSA indicate that following a single SC injection, the early absorption of insulin 
lispro was faster with LY900014 compared to Humalog in children (age 6 to <12 years), adolescents (age 
12  to  <18  years),  and  adults  (age  18  to  <65  years).  No  significant  differences  between  LY900014  and 
Humalog  were  observed  in  terms  of  total  exposure,  peak  concentration  (Cmax)  and  time  to  peak 
concentration  (tmax).  Following  a  single  bolus  infusion  via  CSII  pump,  a  trend  towards  an  accelerated 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 53/134 
 
 
 
 
absorption of insulin lispro was observed with LY900014 compared to Humalog. Overall, pharmacokinetic 
differences between LY900014 and Humalog appeared to be lesser following CSII bolus infusion compared 
with differences observed following SC injection. 
Evaluation of glucose excursion following a liquid mixed meal and a single dose of LY900014 and Humalog 
given  immediately  before  the  start  of  the  meal  was  a  secondary  objective  of  study  ITSA.  The  results 
indicated  no  compelling  difference  in  the  overall  postprandial  glucose  excursion  between  LY900014  and 
Humalog in children and adolescents when given immediately before a meal, although the early increase 
in blood glucose might be attenuated with SC injection of LY900014. Because a liquid test meal and fixed 
insulin dose of 0.2 U/kg (in contrast to individually adjusted dose) were used in study ITSA, it is difficult to 
estimate the clinical significance of these results.  
The population PK and PK/PD modelling and simulation exercises conducted by the MAH are acknowledged. 
Further development of the PK models is encouraged, especially it is advised to include the effect of anti-
drug  antibodies  in  the  models.  The  presented  PK/PD  models  highlight  the  challenges  of  modelling 
postprandial glycaemia and extrapolation of models to new populations. Overall, the PK and PK/PD models 
are  considered  supplementary  information  for  the  benefit-risk  (B/R)  assessment  of  the current  variation 
application and, therefore, no questions are raised on the models. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main studies 
The paediatric development program of Lyumjev (LY900014) includes 2 clinical studies in which LY900014 
was administered to paediatric patients with T1D. 
1.  A clinical pharmacology study ITSA, which established the PK and glucodynamic profile during a test 
meal of LY900014 and Humalog following a single SC bolus dose administered through injection or 
CSII  in  paediatric  and  adult  patients  with  T1D.  Under  Article  46,  Study  ITSA  was  previously 
reviewed  (EMEA/H/C/005037/II/0005).  Additional  analyses  from  study  ITSA  submitted  with  this

Open-Label  Postprandial  LY900014  Treatment  Group  in  Children  and  Adolescents  with  Type  1 
Diabetes: PRONTO-Peds. In this AR, the study is referred to as ITSB. 
The evaluation of efficacy and safety of LY900014 in children and adolescents aged from 1 year to <18 years 
is in this procedure based on the ITSB.  
PK modelling reports (MDI Pop PK Report Addendum: Study ITSA Part A; CSII Pop PK Report Addendum: 
Study ITSA Part B; Pop PK ITRF-ITSC) included in the current submission are assessed in Sections 2.3.2 to 
2.3.6 of this AR. 
2.4.1.1.  Methods 
2.4.1.1.1.  Study design 
Study ITSB was a Phase 3 study designed to evaluate LY900014 compared to Humalog in combination with 
basal insulin in children and adolescent patients with T1D.  
The study consisted of 3 treatment groups: 
• 
LY900014, given 0 to 2 minutes prior to the meal 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 54/134 
 
 
 
 
•  Humalog, given 0 to 2 minutes prior to the meal, or 
• 
LY900014+ 20, given up to 20 minutes after the start of a meal. 
The study was designed to demonstrate noninferiority of LY900014 compared with Humalog in change from 
baseline  to  Week  26  in  HbA1c  when  injected  0  to  2  minutes  prior  to  the  start  of  the  meal,  comparing 
treatment groups 1 and 2 on the list above. The third treatment group was open label due to inability to 
blind postprandial injection timing of LY900014 and evaluated the efficacy and safety of postprandial dosing, 
which often occurs in children due to unpredictable eating patterns and activity. (Figure 17). 
The study consisted of 4 periods: 
•  1-week screening 
•  4-week lead-in period 
•  26-week treatment period, and 
•  2-week safety follow-up period. 
Figure 17 Illustration of study design. 
During  4-week  lead-in  period,  patients  taking  insulin  aspart,  insulin  glulisine,  faster  insulin  aspart,  or 
biosimilar insulin lispro at screening switched to marketed insulin lispro (Humalog) while remaining on their 
basal insulin regimen (insulin glargine, insulin detemir, or insulin degludec) throughout the study. Glucose 
target  values  were  recommended  and  were  used  to  determine  insulin  dose  titration  by  the  investigator. 
During  the  lead-in,  emphasis  was  on  basal  insulin  adjustment.  Prandial  insulin  was  titrated  to  achieve 
optimal dosing during the first 12 weeks. Therefore, the primary endpoint HbA1c reflected glucose control 
during the 3-month time period when there were minimal changes. Adjustment of basal and prandial insulin 
doses was allowed throughout the treatment period to achieve or maintain glycaemic targets or for safety 
reasons. 
Glucose monitoring 
Patients were required to collect glucose values at least 4 times (before meals and bedtime) each day using 
the BG meter provided or a personal CGM/FGM that is approved for nonadjunctive use; i.e. results could 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 55/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
be  used  to  make  insulin  dosing  decisions  per  their  local  country  regulations.  The  investigator  reviewed 
glucose values at office and telephone visits in order to determine any insulin dose adjustments. Once BG 
targets  were  achieved  and  basal  and  prandial  dose  titration  had  been  optimised,  daily  4-point  glucose 
testing frequency and timing could be adjusted at the investigator’s discretion in consultation with patient 
and caregiver.

2.4.1.1.3.  Treatments 
Table 17 outlines the study interventions. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 57/134 
 
 
 
 
Table 17 Study interventions administered 
The glucose target values shown in Table 18 are suggested guidelines that are required in order to achieve 
an  HbA1c  goal  of  <7.0%  (53  mmol/mol)  and  could  be  used  to  determine  insulin  dose  titration.  Targets 
could  be  individualised,  aiming  for  the  lowest  achievable  HbA1c  without  undue  exposure  to  severe 
hypoglycaemia. A higher HbA1c goal (in most cases <7.5% (58 mmol/mol) could be appropriate in younger 
children who are unable to articulate symptoms of hypoglycaemia. 
Table 18 Glucose Target Values 
In the blinded treatment groups, LY900014 and Humalog was administered immediately prior to each meal 
(0–2 minutes). The LY900014+20 open label treatment group administered the dose up to 20 minutes after 
the start of a meal. 
The patient’s basal insulin during the study could be dosed at any time and was to be taken at approximately 
the same time each day. Patients were required to use the same basal insulin regimen (type and dosing 
frequency) throughout the study. 
Detailed advice regarding adjustment of prandial and basal insulin were included in the protocol (not copied 
in this AR for brevity). The prescribed prandial insulin dose was determined by, and the responsibility of, 
the  investigator  in  consultation  with  the  patient  or  caregiver.  Patients  were  to  attempt  to  eat  3  meals 
(morning, mid-day, and evening) with at least 3 doses of meal-related IP every day. Patients could also 
eat a snack and inject insulin to cover the carbohydrates eaten if that was their usual practice. Patients 
were to administer IP to correct high BG using their usual method for determining a correction dose 
2.4.1.1.4.  Objectives 
Table 19 shows the objectives and endpoints of the study.  
The primary objective of the study was to test the hypothesis that LY900014 is noninferior to Humalog 
on glycaemic control, measured by the change from baseline in HbA1c in patients 1 to <18 years of age 
with T1D, when administered as prandial insulin (0 to 2 minutes prior to the meal), in combination with 
basal insulin for 26 weeks. 
It is to be observed that the non-inferiority margin of 0.4% in the table is for the FDA, for the EU then non-
inferiority margin (NIM) is 0.3% (3 mmol/mol). The protocol (version B) states:” For both primary analysis 
approaches,  LY900014  will  be  declared  noninferior  to  Humalog  if  the  upper  limit  of  the  2-sided  95% 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 58/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
confidence interval (CI) for the least-squares (LS) mean difference in the change from baseline in HbA1c 
for LY900014 minus Humalog is below +0.4%. In addition, the 95% CI for the treatment difference will be 
compared to an alternative NIM of +0.3%. Both estimands will be tested at the full significance level of 
0.05.” The MAH states in the Summary of Clinical Efficacy that A NIM of 0.4% has been developed consistent 
with  the  FDA  guidelines.  The  primary  endpoint  was  also  assessed  using  a  NIM  of  0.3%,  in  line  with  the 
Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus 
(14 May 2012 CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1). For further justification of the NIM, see section 2.4.1.1.10.

2.4.1.1.6.  Sample size 
Approximately 708 patients were to be randomized in order that 600 patients complete the study through 
the  primary  endpoint  at  Week  26.  Patients  will  be  randomized  in  a  2:2:1  ratio  to  double-blind  prandial 
LY900014 (LY900014) , Humalog, or open-label post-prandial LY900014 (LY900014+20). 
Assuming a NIM of 0.4%, no true difference between treatment groups and a SD of 1.1%, 240 completers 
for  each  double-blind  treatment  group  would  provide  greater  than  95%  power  to  show  noninferiority 
between  LY900014  and  Humalog  using  the  upper  limit  of  a  2-sided  95%  CI.  This  sample  size  was  also 
estimated to provide more than 80% power to show noninferiority between LY900014 and Humalog using 
a 0.3% NIM at 26 weeks. 
Additionally, with the assumption a difference no larger than 0.07% between treatment groups and a SD 
of 1.1%, 240 completers of Humalog and 120 completers of LY900014+20 would provide approximately 
76% power to show noninferiority between LY900014+20 and Humalog using a NIM of 0.4%. 
Assuming a 15% dropout rate during 26 weeks of treatment, approximately 708 patients (283 patients in 
each  double-blind  treatment  group  and  142  patients  in  the  open-label  treatment  group)  were  to  be 
randomised. 
2.4.1.1.7.  Randomisation and treatment assignment 
Eligible patients were randomised to double-blind treatment or open label treatment at Visit 4. Assignment 
to treatment groups was be determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an interactive 
web-response system (IWRS). 
Patients were randomized to double-blind LY900014, double-blind Humalog, or open-label LY900014+20 
in a 2:2:1 ratio. Stratification was by country, HbA1c stratum (≤8.0%, >8.0%) based on HbA1c measured 
at Visit 1, type of basal insulin at randomization (insulin glargine, detemir, or degludec), and age group 
(1 to <12, 12 to <18 years). 
The IWRS was used to assign all IP (blinded and open-label) during the study. 
2.4.1.1.8.  Blinding (masking) 
Study ITSB was a double-blind study; both treatment groups, LY900014 and Humalog, were administered 
immediately prior to each meal in a double-blind manner. Investigators, patients, and study site personnel 
were  blinded  to  assigned  insulin  regimen  throughout  the  study.  The  third  treatment  group  consisting  of 
LY900014  administered  up  to  20  minutes  after  the  start  of  a  meal  (LY900014+20)  was  open-label,  as 
blinding  for  this  group  was  not  possible.  The  sponsor  remained  blinded  throughout  the  study  for  all 
treatment groups. 
2.4.1.1.9.  Analysis populations 
Definitions of populations are given in Table 23. 
The efficacy analysis was conducted on the Randomized Population, unless otherwise noted. The primary 
endpoint was also analysed using the Per Protocol Population and Completer Population. 
Efficacy analyses for other secondary objectives and exploratory objectives were performed for the efficacy 
estimand. 
Safety analyses were conducted on the Safety Population.

Analyses of AEs included 2 sets of analyses: 
• 
• 
data collected prior to permanent discontinuation of IP, and 
all data collected during the course of the entire study, including the follow-up visit, regardless of 
IP use. 
Analyses of hypoglycaemia used data collected prior to permanent discontinuation of IP, while analyses for 
posttreatment was performed as needed. 
Analyses of safety laboratory measurements was performed on all data during the planned treatment period 
regardless of IP use.

Note: The health outcome measure PedsQL was performed on 105 subjects in English speaking countries. 
This  measure  is  not  in  the  main  protocol.  However,  the  MAH  submitted  upon  request  the  addendum  of 
study ITSB, which includes the health outcome measure PedsQL. 
2.4.1.1.10.  Statistical methods 
Analyses of primary objective 
The clinical variable analysed for the primary objective, to show that LY900014 is noninferior to Humalog 
on glycaemic control, was change from baseline in HbA1c (%) at Week 26. Two alternative NIMs 0.3% and 
0.4% were to be considered. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 65/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy estimand 
For  the  EMA  jurisdiction  the  primary  estimand  was  set  to  be  the  “efficacy  estimand”  that  included  data 
collected prior to permanent discontinuation of IP.  
The  analysis  model  for  the  efficacy  estimand  was  a  MMRM,  and  thus  in  practise  only  patients  with  both 
baseline  and  at  least  1  postbaseline  values  were  included.  The  MMRM  analysis  model  for  the  efficacy 
estimand included the fixed effects of treatment, the main effects of the stratification factors (type of basal 
insulin, age group [to <12 years, 12 to <18 years], and country), visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, 
as well as the continuous, fixed covariate of baseline value. Countries in similar geographic regions with 
fewer  than  10  patients  were  pooled  to  achieve  a  pooled  country  of  at  least  10  patients.  Within-patient 
association matrix was assumed to be unstructured. LY900014 was to be declared noninferior to Humalog 
if the upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the LS mean difference in the change from baseline in HbA1c 
for LY900014 minus Humalog was below +0.4%. In addition, the 95% CI for the treatment difference was 
compared to an alternative NIM of +0.3%.  
ITT estimand 
The other estimand defined, the “ITT estimand”, included all data collected regardless of IP use. All patients 
with baseline value were included in the analysis. 
For the ITT estimand, the multiple imputation method of return to baseline was used: The missing HbA1c 
measurement  at  Week  26  was  imputed  by  the  patient-level  observed  baseline  value  plus  a  noise  for 
uncertainty, assuming a washout of any potential treatment effect. The noise followed a normal distribution 
with the variability estimated from the “washout HbA1c data”, derived  by subtracting the corresponding 
treatment  mean  at  Week  26  from  individual  nonmissing  HbA1c  values  at  Week  26.  (Of  note:  The  copy 
reference method, originally planned as the first option, was not used because there were a limited number 
of patients who discontinued study drug before Week 26 but provided data at Week 26, i.e. the relevant 
reference  group,  and  hence  a  limited  dataset  that  could  have  been  used  for  imputation  with  the  copy 
reference approach.) 
For the ITT estimand, an ANCOVA was used for each of the multiple imputed datasets with fixed effects of 
treatment and the main effects of the stratification factors (type of basal insulin, age group, and country 
[pooled]) as fixed effects and baseline HbA1c as a covariate, and model based mean difference calculated 
for the treatment groups. The final estimates were combined from at least 1000 imputations. LY900014 
was  to  be  declared  noninferior  to  Humalog  if  the  upper  limit  of  the  2-sided  95%  CI  for  the  LS  mean 
difference  in  the  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  for  LY900014  minus  Humalog  was  below  +0.4%.  In 
addition, the 95% CI for the treatment difference was compared to an alternative NIM of +0.3%.  
Additional analyses of the primary objective 
Additional analyses of HbA1c were completed for the primary variable: an MMRM model using the completer 
and  per-protocol  populations.  Sensitivity  analyses  were  conducted  using  a  progressive  stress  test, 
implemented as tipping point analysis, for both efficacy and ITT estimands: The basic idea was to impute 
the missing values and add a value (delta) to the imputed values to find the delta value that would overturn 
the conclusion. If the delta required to overturn the primary result was not a plausible departure from what 
would be expected under missing-at-random assumption, then the primary result was considered robust to 
plausible departures from MAR. 
A secondary analysis model for the efficacy estimand was an ANCOVA, using the model with strata (pooled 
country, type of basal insulin, and age group) and treatment as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate. 
Missing endpoints were imputed using the LOCF approach using postbaseline data only.

Justification for noninferiority margin 
A NIM of 0.4% from both statistical and clinical perspectives was developed consistent with the Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines. The primary endpoint was also assessed using a NIM of 0.3%, which 
is generally considered acceptable per the CHMP Guideline on Clinical Investigation of Medicinal Products 
in the Treatment or Prevention of Diabetes Mellitus. 
The International Council for Harmonisation E10 states that the NIM cannot be greater than the smallest 
effect size that the active drug would be reliably expected to have compared to placebo in the setting of 
the planned trial. The FDA “Guidance for Industry: Diabetes Mellitus: Developing Drugs and Therapeutic 
Biologics for Treatment and Prevention” 2008 draft, which was in place at the time the study was conducted, 
states that a NIM of either 0.3% or 0.4% is acceptable in diabetes trials, provided this is no greater than a 
suitably conservative estimate of the magnitude of the treatment effect of the active control in the previous 
placebo-controlled trials. 
A NIM of 0.4% was also considered appropriate from the perspective of clinical relevance. Basing the clinical 
relevance  upon  the  curvilinear  relationship  between  HbA1c  and  microvascular  complications  and 
hypoglycaemia  rates  from  the  Diabetes  Control  and  Complications  Trial,  the  mean  change  in  HbA1c 
represented by a NIM of 0.4% HbA1c would represent negligible increased rates of complications per 100 
patient-years for patients with diabetes having a mean HbA1c of 8% at baseline (DCCT 1993; DCCT 1996). 
Analyses of Multiplicity-Controlled Objectives 
The analysis methods described above for the efficacy and ITT estimands were to be used for testing the 
two multiplicity-controlled secondary hypotheses: (1) whether LY900014+20 is noninferior to Humalog for 
glycaemic control, and (2) whether LY900014 was statistically superior to Humalog for glycaemic control. 
The  two  hypotheses  above  were  to  be  tested  hierarchically  at  two-sided  5%  alpha  level,  provided  the 
noninferiority  of  LY900014  to  Humalog  in  glycaemic  control  is  demonstrated  first.  (Of  note:  Although  a 
simple hierarchical hypothesis test procedure was used, the MAH refers to it as being ‘graphical’ in some 
parts of the documentation.) 
Analyses of Secondary Efficacy Objectives 
The analyses of insulin dose (i.e., actual and change from baseline in total, basal, prandial insulin dose and 
prandial/total  insulin  dose  ratio)  used  an  MMRM  model  similar  to  that  for  the  primary  outcome  with  an 
additional term of HbA1c stratum (≤8.0%, >8.0%). 
Treatment comparisons for the proportion of patients with HbA1c <7.0% and <7.5% were analysed using 
a  longitudinal  logistic  regression  with  repeated  measurements  conducted  by  a  generalized  linear  mixed 
model, including independent variables of treatment, baseline HbA1c value, visit, baseline HbA1c-by-visit 
interaction,  and  treatment-by-visit  interaction.  An  unstructured  covariance  structure  was  used.  As  a 
sensitivity analysis, the proportion of patients with HbA1c <7.0% and <7.5% at Week 26 (Visit 15), imputed 
using LOCF, was compared using a logistic regression model with terms for treatment and baseline HbA1c 
value. 
There was a substudy on health-related quality of life (HRQoL), conducted in English-speaking countries. 
The protocol and statistical analysis plan (SAP) for this substudy were missing from the submission and 
were requested to be submitted. The MAH submitted upon request the protocol which included the SAP. 
Patients  and  caregivers  who  were  enrolled  at  sites  in  the  US  and  who  spoke  English  were  asked  to 
participate in Pediatric Quality-of-Life addendum I8B-MC-ITSB(1) using the measure PedsQL, consisting of 
PedsQL  Generic  Core  Multidimensional  Scales  (physical  functioning,  emotional  functioning,  social 
functioning,  school  functioning),  Summary  Scores  (psychosocial  health  summary  score,  physical  health

summary  score,  total  score),  and  Diabetes  Module  (diabetes,  treatment  I,  treatment  II,  worry, 
communication). For the PedsQL Generic Core (4.0) and PedsQL Diabetes (3.2) scales, transformation of 
scores was needed as indicated by the scoring manual. Items were scored on a 5-point Likert scale from 0 
(Never)  to  4  (Almost  always).  Items were  then  reversed  scored  as  follows:  0=100,  1=75,  2=50,  3=25, 
4=0. The dimension scores and the summary scores were calculated by summing the transformed scores 
of the items divided by the number of items answered. Moreover, for both the PedsQL Generic Core (4.0) 
and PedsQL Diabetes (3.2) scales, if more than 50% of the items in the scale were missing, then the Scale 
Scores were not computed. If 50% or more items were completed, mean of the completed items in a scale 
was used to impute the missing scores. 
The PedsQL Diabetes (3.2) and PedsQL Generic Core (4.0) scales were analysed by ANCOVA model using 
treatment  and  strata  (pooled  country,  type  of  basal  insulin,  and  HbA1c  stratum)  as  fixed  effects  and 
baseline score as a covariate. The analyses covered the total scores, all subscale scores, and dimensions. 
Analyses of Exploratory Objectives 
Seven-point SMBG assessment covered three, approximately 2-week intervals prior to baseline, week 12 
and  week  24.  For  each  of  the  three  interval  (referred  to  as  ‘visits’  hereafter),  7-point  SMBG  was  to  be 
conducted on at least 3 nonconsecutive days. The following variables were derived from the 7-point SMBG 
profiles for each visit and analysed using the MMRM model similar to that for the primary outcome with an 
additional term of HbA1c stratum (≤8.0%, >8.0%): 
•  1-hour postmeal excursion 
• 
between-day coefficient of variation (CV) and SD, and 
•  within-day CV and SD. 
The excursion of SMBG was calculated for each meal category (morning meal, midday meal, evening meal, 
and  all  meals).  The  average  value  of  excursions  from  the  same  visit  for  each  patient  was  used  in  the 
analysis. 
Blood  glucose  (BG)  values  that  were  out  of  the  detectable  range  (BG  <20  mg/dL  [1.1  mmol/L]  or 
BG >600 mg/dL  [33.3  mmol/L])  of  the  glucometer  were  excluded  from  the  analysis  data.  For  baseline 
SMBG, records that were collected on or after the first dose date were excluded from the analysis. If there 
were  multiple  records  on  the  same  day  and  same  time  point,  only  the  last  entry  was  used  for  variable 
derivation. Blood glucose readings without units were not used in the analysis. 
At a given visit, the CV and SD on each day with the 7-point SMBG profile were calculated using all the 
glucose values within that day. The average values of these CVs and SDs were then used as the within-day 
CV and SD at that visit in analysis. At a given visit, the CV and SD at each of the 7 pre-specified SMBG time 
points were calculated using the corresponding glucose values of the 7-point SMBG profiles. The average 
values of these CVs and SDs was then used as the between-day CV and SD at that visit in analysis.

2.4.1.2.2.  Recruitment 
Study ITSB was conducted at 96 centres that enrolled participants in the United States, Russian Federation, 
Czech  Republic,  Spain,  Ukraine,  Brazil,  Israel,  France,  Italy,  Poland,  United  Kingdom,  Mexico,  China, 
Austria, Germany, Denmark, and Japan. First patient visit: 07 April 2019, last patient visit: 02 July 2021. 
2.4.1.2.3.  Conduct of the study 
The  MAH  confirms  that  the  study  was  conducted  in  accordance  with  the  protocol,  consensus  ethical 
principles  derived  from  international  guidelines,  including  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  Council  for 
International  Organizations  of  Medical  Sciences  International  Ethical  Guidelines,  applicable  ICH  GCP 
Guidelines, and applicable laws and regulations. 
Amendments 
The  protocol  and  protocol  amendments  located  in  an  appendix  of  the  CSR  provide  information  about 
changes  in  study  conduct  implemented  by  protocol  amendments.  The  changes  made  in  protocol 
amendments were considered nonsubstantial. All amendments are not described in this AR for brevity. ITSB 
Amendment (a) included, e.g., addition of CGM/FGM and relevant advice for their use, more flexibility to 
glucose monitoring and requirement to confirm any suspected hypoglycaemia events by BG meter. ITSB 
Amendment (b) included, e.g., changes in daily insulin dose range to allow for younger and active children 
using smaller doses and adolescents who require more insulin during puberty; allowed rescreen to patients 
who had a screen fail or unexpectedly had to discontinue due to COVID-19 enrolment pause. 
Table  24  summarizes  the  approval  dates  of  the  protocol  and  subsequent  amendments  in  addition  to 
providing the date of the first patient visit. 
Table 24 Protocol Approval Dates and First Patient Visit Date 
Protocol deviations 
Important protocol deviations are defined as those likely to have a significant impact on the completeness, 
accuracy,  or  reliability  of  the  study  data  or  that  may  significantly  affect  a  participant’s  rights,  safety,  or 
well-being. 
A total of 78 participants (10.9%) had at least 1 important protocol deviation. The most common important 
protocol deviations were related to IP treatment assignment/randomisation error (n=24 [3.4%]), informed 
consent (n=22 [3.1%]), and study procedures (n=22 [3.1%]). 
There  were  8  patients  (1.1%)  with  protocol  deviations  due  to  inadvertent  enrolment.  Seven  of  these 
patients were considered inadvertent enrolment due to misinterpretation of Inclusion Criterion [9], Female 
patients  of  childbearing  potential.  Due  to  the  misinterpretation  of  the  protocol  definition  of  childbearing 
potential, some female participants had missing pregnancy tests at Visits 1 and 4. All protocol deviations 
related  to  IP  treatment  assignment/randomisation  error  were  due  to  IWRS  entry  error  impacting 
stratification. Several subjects had office visits changed to telephone visits due to COVID-19 restrictions, 
leading to missing patient characteristics or laboratory values for the visit.

Only  27  patients  were  below  the  age of  6,  of whom  10  in  the LY900014  group  and  10  in  the  LY900014 
group (Table 27). No subjects below the age of 3 years were included in the study. 
2.4.1.2.5.  Exposure 
Exposure to investigation product over the study is shown in table 27. The exposure from first to last dose 
on IP in total patient-years was 136.3 for LY900014, 146.9 for Humalog, and 68.8 for LY900014+20.

2.4.1.2.6.  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary and Multiplicity-Controlled Efficacy Analyses 
Primary objective: change in HbA1c with LY900014 vs. Humalog, noninferiority 
The primary objective was achieved. LY900014 was noninferior to Humalog for glycaemic control. The upper 
limit of the 95% CI for the difference in change in HbA1c was less than the prespecified NIMs of 0.4% and 
0.3% for both the efficacy and the ITT estimands (table 28)  
Table 28 Summary and Analysis of HbA1c at Baseline and Week 26 
There were no significant differences in HbA1c between treatment groups at any visit. For both LY900014 
and LY900014+20 treatment groups, there were significant within-treatment changes at Weeks 6 and 12 
but  not  at  Week  26.  Figure  20  presents  the  actual  LS  mean  HbA1c  by  visit  and  at  endpoint  from  all 
randomized patients from study entry to Week 26 for the efficacy estimand.

Multiplicity-Controlled Objective (1): change in HbA1c with LY900014 + 20 vs. Humalog 
Multiplicity-Controlled  Objective  (1)  was  achieved.  LY900014  +  20  was  noninferior  to  Humalog  for 
glycaemic control. The upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in change in HbA1c was less than the 
prespecified NIM of 0.4% and 0.3% for both the efficacy and the ITT estimands. (Table 30). 
Multiplicity-Controlled Objective (2): change in HbA1c with LY900014 vs. Humalog, superiority 
The  Multiplicity-Controlled  Objective  (2)  was  not  achieved.  LY900014  was  not  statistically  superior  to 
Humalog for glycaemic control with the efficacy or the ITT estimand (Table 31). 
Secondary and Tertiary Efficacy Analyses 
Analyses of the secondary and tertiary endpoints were not multiplicity controlled. 
Proportion of patients achieving HbA1c targets 
There  were  no  statistically  significant  treatment  differences  among  the  LY900014,  LY900014+20,  or 
Humalog treatment groups in the percentages of patients achieving HbA1c targets (<7%, 53 mmol/mol, 
and  <7.5%,  58  mmol/mol)  at  Week  26.  At  week  26,  around  20%  of  subjects  reached  HbA1c  <7.0% 
(53 mmol/mol) (table 32). For the threshold of HbA1c 7.5%, the respective proportions were 40.1%, 37.0% 
and 33.3 % for Humalog, LY900014, and LY900014+20, respectively.

Glycaemic variability 
Within-day  and  between-day  glycaemic  variability  was  measured  by  the  standard  deviation  and  the 
coefficient of variation of 7-point SMBG profiles. No significant differences were observed in within-day or 
between-day glycaemic variability between treatment groups at baseline and at Week 26 (data not shown 
for brevity).

Body weight 
Weight increased similarly in all study arms, with median change from baseline of 2.1, 1.9 and 2.0 kg in 
the Humalog, LY900014 and LY900014 + 20 groups, respectively. Median growth in height was 2.0 cm in 
all three study arms. 
Health outcomes analyses 
In  the  Pediatric  Quality-of-Life  addendum  I8B-MC-ITSB(1)  using  the  measure  PedsQL  (description  in  
Section 2.4.1.1.10), some differences were seen at baseline between study arms. However, at the LOCF 
endpoint, no differences were seen between treatments (data not shown for brevity). 
2.4.1.2.7.  Ancillary analyses 
Primary outcome 
Additional analyses of HbA1c were conducted for the efficacy estimand for the Completer Population and 
the  Per  Protocol  Population,  respectively.  Results  were  consistent  with  those  from  the  All  Randomized 
Population, and all noninferiority objectives were met. (data not shown for brevity) 
The progressive stress test sensitivity analysis of HbA1c (%) for the efficacy estimand and ITT estimand 
implied that the primary results are robust and support conclusions made for the primary objective (data 
not shown for brevity). 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses for actual HbA1c and HbA1c change from baseline were performed to examine whether 
the treatment difference varied by the subgroup. The evaluation was based on the treatment-by-subgroup 
interaction  using  either  the  efficacy  or  ITT  estimand  with  multiple  imputation  described  for  the  primary 
analysis with the addition of subgroup-related terms. The treatment-by-subgroup interaction effect at Week 
26 was evaluated at the significance level of 0.10. 
There were no significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions for age groups, BMI, HbA1c stratum, duration 
of diabetes, ethnicity, country, type of basal insulin, prandial insulin dosing plan, personal CGM/FGM use, 
and treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies (TEADA) status for the efficacy estimand or ITT estimand. In 
different  age  groups,  the  mean  HbA1c  (%  /  mmol/mol)  in  the  Humalog,  LY900014  and  LY900014+20 
groups, respectively, was at Week 26 
•  8.02 / 64.2, 7.89/ 62.7 and 7.59 / 59.5 in subjects aged 3 to <6 years;  
•  7.72 / 60.9, 7.85 / 62.3, and 7.99 / 63.8 in subjects aged 6 to <12 years, and  
•  7.98 / 63.4, 7.86 / 62.2 and 7.78/ 61.8 in subjects aged 12 to <18 years. 
Statistically significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions were observed for gender and race for the ITT 
estimand  and  for  region  for  the  efficacy  estimand.  These  subgroup  interactions  were  not  considered 
clinically meaningful (data not shown for brevity). 
2.4.1.3.  ITSB CGM Addendum 
2.4.1.3.1.  Methods 
Study I8B-MC-ITSB (ITSB) CGM addendum was performed in a subset of sites that participated in the main 
study. The original submission included only the CSR for the CGM Addendum, but the appendices of this 
substudy – protocol, statistical analysis plan (SAP), ERB list and sample ICF – were not included. These 
documents  were  requested  and  received  with  the  response  from  the  MAH,  except  for  the  SAP.  The 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 79/134 
 
 
 
 
methodology for the derivation of the primary endpoint, iAUC0-2 hours for each visit, and some other variables 
derived  from  CGM  data,  is  not  included  in  the  protocol  or  the  CSR.  Since  the  CGM  Addendum  failed  to 
recruit an adequate number of subjects and therefore did not have the power to show differences between 
treatments,  the  results  of  the  CGM  are  not  considered  crucial  for  the  assessment  and  the  issue  of  the 
missing SAP is not pursued further.    
Design of Addendum 
These sites were selected in countries where Dexcom G6 is approved for use in children. This resulted in 
20 centres that screened participants in Israel, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the US. Due to the limited number 
of countries where Dexcom G6 was approved for use in children and the non-obligatory nature of the CGM 
addendum, the CGM addendum did not meet the prespecified enrolment criteria. 
The purpose of this addendum was to evaluate the 24-hour glucose profile captured with continuous glucose 
monitoring (CGM) for LY900014 and Humalog, when either is used in combination with basal insulin as part 
of a multiple daily injection regimen. 
In addition to use of the CGM device, the same intervention measures from the main Study ITSB applied 
to all patients enrolled in the CGM addendum. 
Eligible subjects were required to be participants in Study ITSB for participation in this Addendum. Patients 
or parents (or legal representative) signed separate addendum-specific informed consents. Age was limited 
to the approved Dexcom G6 indication for use in the geographic region where it was used. 
The  study  included  a  1-week  screening  with  a  4-week  lead-in  period,  followed  by  a  26-week  treatment 
period and a 2-week safety follow-up period. In 2 of the treatment groups, LY900014 and Humalog were 
administered immediately (0 to 2 minutes) prior to each meal in a double-blind manner. A third open-label 
treatment  group  consisted  of  LY900014  administered  up  to  20  minutes  after  the  start  of  a  meal 
(LY900014+20). (Figure 22) 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Figure 22 ITSB CGM addendum study design. 
Patients who chose to participate in the Study ITSB CGM addendum used the CGM device during 2 periods 
of time: during the 4-week lead in period, and during the 26-week treatment period. 
Sample size 
Approximately 163 randomized patients were planned to participate in this addendum so that 130 patients 
would  complete  this  addendum  at  Week  26.  Assuming  a  mean  difference  of  22  mg∙h/dL,  an  SD  of 
39.5 mg∙h/dL, and a 2-sided significance level of 0.05, approximately 52 completers in each double-blind 
treatment group would provide approximately 80% power to show superiority of LY900014 versus Humalog 
in the iAUC0-2 hours after the start of meals obtained from up to 10 days of CGM use at Week 26. Assuming 
a 20% dropout rate for 26 weeks, approximately 163 patients (65 in each double-blind treatment group 
and 33 in the open-label treatment group) were planned to participate in this addendum. 
Objectives 
The primary outcome of the CGM addendum was the iAUC0-2 hours after meals obtained from up to 10 days 
of CGM use prior to Week 26.  
An analysis of covariance model with treatment, type of basal insulin, HbA1c stratum (≤8.0% or >8.0%), 
and age group as fixed effects and baseline as a covariate was used for treatment group comparison. The 
LS mean of the treatment difference estimated from the model at Week 26 is provided.

Percentage and duration of time within a glucose range: The percentage of time within a specified 
glucose  range  (target,  hypo-  or  hyperglycaemia  ranges)  was  calculated  as  the  number  of  observations 
within the specified range divided by the number of observations in the time interval (e.g., 24-hour period) 
on all valid CGM days at the same visit. The duration (in minutes) within the glucose range was calculated 
as the percentage of time within the glucose range times the length of the period (24-hour, 18 hour, and 
6 hour, for the periods of 24-hour, daytime, or night-time, respectively). For a visit, the average percentage 
across all valid CGM days during the visit was calculated and used for the calculation of the duration (in 
minutes) of time in the specified range during the 24-hour period for this patient by multiplying the average 
percentage with 1440 minutes. 
Post-Meal  Dosing  Comparison:  LY900014+20  versus  Humalog,  when  administered  as  prandial 
insulin (0 to 2 minutes prior to the start of a meal), with regard to the iAUC0-2 hours after the start  of 
meals obtained from up to 10 days of CGM use at Week 26. 
Time in Glucose Target Range: time in the glucose target range of 70 to 180 mg/dL [3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L] 
during daytime, normalized to 24-hour period at Week 26. 
Average Glucose Excursions: postmeal average glucose excursions following all meals combined at Week 
26 (0 to 1 hour, 0 to 2 hours, 0 to 3 hours, and 0 to 4 hours postmeal). 
Ambulatory Glucose Profiles for Postprandial Glucose Control: mean ambulatory glucose profiles for 
postprandial glucose control at baseline and Week 26. 
2.4.1.3.2.  Results 
A total of 88 patients were randomized after signing the ICF for the CGM addendum. Of the 88 randomized 
patients, 79 were included in the CGM analysis set (37 in the Humalog group, 29 in the LY900014 group 
and  13  in  the  LY900014+20  group).  This  is  lower  than  the  planned  completion  number  of  130.  The 
addendum  with  130  patients  had  80%  power  to  detect  a  difference  of  22  mg∙h/dL  in  the  postmeal 
iAUC0-2 hours at Week 26, assuming an SD of 39.5 mg∙h/dL. With only 79 patients, the addendum was not 
powered to detect this difference.  
Detailed  disposition  of  participants  is  not  included  in  this  AR  for  brevity.  Of  subjects  randomised  to  the 
Humalog, LY900014, and LY900014+20 groups, respectively, 34/37, 27/29 and 13/13 subjects completed 
the study. 
Baseline characteristics 
Baseline characteristics for the addendum are given in Table 32. Age range was from 4 to 17 years, with 3 
subjects <6 years of age and 18 subjects from 6 to 12 years of age.

Table 32 Baseline Characteristics in CGM Addendum
Although 79 patients were included in the CGM analysis set, there were instances where meal occurrence 
time data were collected but did not contribute to analysis. Only subjects with nonmissing baseline values 
and at least 1 nonmissing postbaseline value for the response variable were included in analysis.  Reasons 
for noninclusion include data collected on a nonvalid CGM day or postmeal CGM data collected was fewer

Incremental AUC0-2h Humalog vs. LY900014 
Figure  23  presents  the  results  for  the  primary  objective,  comparison  between  LY900014  and  Humalog, 
when administered as prandial insulin (0 to 2 minutes prior to the start of a meal), with regard to the iAUC0-
2 hours after the start of meals obtained from up to 10 days of CGM use at Week 26. The LSMean difference 
of  −2.4  mg∙h/dL  (95%  CI  −36.2,  31.5)  in  the  postmeal  iAUC0–2  hours  at  Week  26  was  not  nominally 
statistically significantly different between LY900014 and Humalog.

Average glucose excursions 
Average  glucose  excursions  at  Week  26  from  0  to  1  hour  postmeal  for  all  meals  combined  were  only 
analysed for the subset of completers who recorded meal start times in their CGM diary (Humalog [n = 19]; 
LY900014  [n  =  15];  LY900014+20  [n  =  6])  (Table  34).  No  differences  were  observed  for  the  average 
glucose excursions combined for all meals. The only nominally statistically significant findings in this small 
subset  were  lower  glucose  excursions  from  premeal  to  3  and  to  4  hours  postmeal  for  breakfast  in  the 
LY9000014 group vs. Humalog at Week 26 (data not shown for brevity).

Glucose Variability 
Ambulatory  glucose  profiles  during  the  4-hour  period  after  meals  as  represented  by  median,  25th/75th 
percentiles, and 10th/90th percentiles are shown at baseline when all patients were treated with Humalog, 
and at the 26-week assessment by treatment assignment (Figure 27). 
Upon visual inspection, LY900014 and Humalog postprandial glucose patterns were similar between both 
treatment groups at each time interval at each meal and across all meals, suggesting small differences in 
glucose  variability.  For  all  3  treatment  groups,  there  appears  to  be  increased  variability  at  26  weeks 
compared with baseline in the post-dinner glucose profiles. In the LY900014+20 group, there is greater

variability  observed  from  baseline  to  Week  26  compared  with  LY900014  and  Humalog,  with  an  increase 
noted at 1 hour (morning, midday) and across all meals and a tendency toward hypoglycaemia at 4 hours 
(midday and dinner) and across all meals. 
Interpretation  of  data  and  its  clinical  importance  is  limited  by  the  small  number  of  participants  with 
evaluable data due to missing mealtimes in the patient diary. 
Figure 27 Postprandial ambulatory glucose profiles at baseline and Week 26 
No differences were observed in within-day glycaemic variability between treatment groups (data not shown 
for brevity). 
The MAH claims that between-day glucose variability between LY900014 and Humalog at Week 26 showed 
nominally statistically significantly lower mean of daily differences (MODD) for the daytime, night-time, and 
24-hour period; however, the opposite is true (table 35). Furthermore, according to the MAH, LY900014+20 
versus Humalog at Week 26 resulted in statistically significantly lower MODD for the night-time and 24-
hour  period  but  this  is  incorrect,  too,  since  postmeal  administration  resulted  in  nominally  statistically 
significantly greater between-day variation compared to Humalog (table 35).

Description 
Primary Efficacy Analysis and Multiplicity-Controlled Secondary Objectives The efficacy estimand included data 
collected prior to permanent discontinuation of study treatment. The ITT estimand included all data collected regardless of 
study drug use. The efficacy estimand was the primary estimand for the EU submission. 
HbA1c: Change from baseline to Week 26 
Control for Multiplicity: A hierarchical approach for multiple comparisons was used to strongly control the overall Type I error 
(2-sided alpha level of 0.05) for testing the treatment effect for the primary and multiplicity-controlled secondary objectives. 
Analysis 
Description 
Primary Efficacy Analyses: An MMRM analysis of data from all randomised patients, collected prior to permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment (efficacy estimand), was used to analyse the primary efficacy measure. The model included 
the fixed class effects of treatment, strata, visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction, as well as the continuous, fixed covariates 
of baseline value. An unstructured covariance structure was used to model the within-patient errors. Sensitivity analyses were 
also conducted. 
Multiplicity-Controlled Secondary Objectives included 
(Objective 1) noninferiority of LY900014+20 to Humalog for change from baseline in HbA1c 
(Objective 2) superiority of LY900014 to Humalog for change from baseline in HbA1c 
Primary Objective: All Randomised Patients, Efficacy Estimand 
The primary objective was achieved. LY900014 was noninferior to Humalog for glycaemic control. (NIM: 0.4 and 0.3% [4.4 and 
3.3 mmol/mol]). 
•  The upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in change in HbA1c was less than the prespecified noninferiority margins

Lead-in Period 
There was a clinically significant improvement in HbA1c in all treatment groups during the lead-in period designed to 
optimise basal insulin therapy. 
From Baseline to Week 26 
Mealtime LY900014 compared to Mealtime Humalog: HbA1c remained steady from baseline in both treatment groups. 
Noninferiority was confirmed for HbA1c change from baseline with LY900014 compared to Humalog. 
LY900014+20 compared to Mealtime Humalog: In the multiplicity-controlled objective 1 (change from baseline in HbA1c), 
HbA1c remained steady from baseline in both treatment groups. Noninferiority was confirmed for HbA1c change from baseline 
with LY900014+20 compared to Humalog. 
Results 
(continued) 
LY900014+20 compared to Mealtime LY900014: At 26 weeks, HbA1c was similar between the mealtime LY900014 and

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Paediatric development 
In 2016, the CHMP recommended that a clinical efficacy and safety study should be conducted for paediatric 
patients, instead of only PK studies, even if the PK profile would be similar in adults and paediatric patients. 
This advice was followed by the MAH, and one pivotal Phase 3 study, I8B-MC-ITSB (ITSB), was conducted 
for children and adolescents with T1D. A clinical pharmacology study, I8B-MC- ITSA (ITSA), established the 
PK/PD  profile  during  a  test  meal  of  Lyumjev  and  Humalog  following  a  single  subcutaneous  bolus  dose 
administered  through  injection  or  CSII  in  paediatric  and  adult  patients  with  T1D.  ITSA  was  previously 
reviewed (EMEA/H/C/005037/II/0005). The current application for indication of use of Lyumjev in subjects 
aged 1 year and above is based on ITSB and on PK modelling based on ITSA.   
ITSB methods 
The study ITSB is considered appropriately designed. The primary objective was to test the hypothesis that 
LY900014 is noninferior to Humalog for glycaemic control (change from baseline in HbA1c), when both are 
administered  preprandially  (0−2  minutes  before  meal).  These  study  arms  were  blinded.  Subjects  in  the 
third study arm administered LY900014 postprandially up to 20 minutes. Obviously, administration time 
could  not  be  blinded;  however,  the  sponsor  remained  blinded  for  all  treatment  groups.  There  were  two 
gated objectives: 1) to test the hypothesis that LY900014 administered within 20 minutes after the meal 
is noninferior to Humalog administered 0 to 2 minutes prior to the meal in change from baseline in HbA1c; 
and 2) to test the hypothesis that LY900014 is superior to Humalog in improving glycaemic control (change 
from baseline in HbA1c) when both are administered preprandially. The noninferiority margin was 0.4% for 
the FDA, and 0.3% for the EU, in line with the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in 
the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus (14 May 2012 CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1).  Hence, the 
relevant NIM in the current assessment for the primary endpoint is 0.3% (3 mmol/mol). 
The  number  of  stratification  factors  exceeds  the  recommended  number  of  ICH  guideline  E9  Statistical 
Principles for Clinical Trials. The number of patients randomised must have been very small in a considerable 
proportion of strata. As such it is questionable whether the randomisation procedure was optimal in ensuring 
balanced treatment groups with respect to the key factors. However, given that this randomisation actually 
resulted in good balance with respect each of the stratification factors, this potential methodological risk 
can be ignored. 
The first patient visit (FPV) of ITSB occurred on 26 Oct 2018. Both of the two amendments to the protocol 
are dated after the FPV: version ITSB(a) on 18 Nov 2019 and version ITSB(b) on 30 Apr 2020. However. 
these amendments are considered nonsubstantial. ITSB(a) e.g., allowed use of personal CGM/FGM, more 
flexibility to glucose monitoring and requirement to confirm any suspected hypoglycaemia events by BG 
meter.  ITSB  Amendment  (b)  included,  e.g.,  changes  in  daily  insulin  dose  range  for  younger  and  active 
children  and  adolescents;  rescreen  of  patients  with  prior  screen  fail  or  discontinuation  due  to  COVID-19 
enrolment pause. Protocol deviations are also considered not to have relevantly affected study results. 
The duration of the study, with a 1-week screening, 4-week lead-in period, 26-week treatment period and 
2-week safety follow-up period is regarded sufficient. Inclusion and exclusion criteria were usual for studies 
in  paediatric  subjects  with  T1D.  Glycaemic  targets  and  monitoring  of  glucose  values  were  appropriate. 
Secondary efficacy and safety endpoints were also usual for a T1D trial.  
The key assessments of efficacy and the corresponding statistical analyses of these were fit for purpose. 
Specifically,  the  efficacy  estimand,  largely  corresponding  to  the  hypothetical  HbA1b  outcomes  as  if  all 
 
 
 
 
 
randomised  subjects  completed  the  study  is  considered  adequate  approach  for  comparing  the  outcomes 
between  the  treatment  groups  for  non-inferiority  and  is  in  accordance  with  relevant  EMA  guideline.  The 
corresponding ITT analysis is considered supportive. The concordance of the two analytical approach and 
the robustness of each analyses are high because few subjects discontinued the study prematurely (see 
below).  
Of  minor  note,  care  must  be  taken  when  interpreting  the  odds  ratios  for  achieving  target  HbA1c  levels 
between treatment groups as these are conditional odds ratios (on the covariates) rather than marginal. 
Furthermore,  the  documentation  refers  to  the  statistical  method  as  generalized  linear  mixed  model  - 
suggesting  that  a  subject-specific  model  may  have  been  used  -  while  the  reference  to  unstructured 
covariance  matrix  suggest  that  a  generalised  estimating  equation  model  was  applied.  Given  the  low 
importance of the odds ratio estimates in question, these points are not considered to require clarification.  
Conduct of ITSB 
Conduct of the study was overall acceptable. A total of 78 participants (10.9%) had at least 1 important 
protocol deviation, most commonly related to IP treatment assignment/randomisation error due to IWRS 
entry  errors  impacting  stratification  (n=24  [3.4%]),  informed  consent  (n=22  [3.1%]),  and  study 
procedures (n=22 [3.1%]). Seven subjects were misinterpreted to not being female patients of childbearing 
potential  and  hence  had  missing  pregnancy  tests.  Several  patients  changed  visits  to  phone  calls  due  to 
COVID-19  pandemic  and  missed  some  patient  characteristics  or  values  for  the  visit.  Important  protocol 
deviations were reviewed by the assessor and deemed not to have a relevant effect on the study results. 
Approximately 96% of patients across treatment groups completed the study while on study drug. 
ITSB substudies 
There were two substudies of ITSB: one for assessment of HRQoL by PedsQL in an English-speaking subset 
of  patients  and  another,  the  CGM  Addendum,  investigating  glucose  excursions  over  24  hours. 
Documentation  on  these  appendices  of  ITSB  is  not  complete  in  the  variation  submission.  Protocols, 
statistical analysis plans and other relevant documents of these substudies were received upon request. 
In  the  CGM  addendum  study  report,  the  MAH  stated  each  hypothesis  (comparisons  between  treatment 
groups) as being or not being statistically significant based on the nominal p-value. However, there was no 
control for study-wise type 1 error probability. Furthermore, in rapporteur’s view, since the CGM addendum 
represents a substudy of ITSB, a strategy to control of type 1 error probability at the level as part of ITSB 
study should have been adopted. The rapporteur therefore chose to refer to each result as being or not 
being nominally statistically significant in this AR based on the p-value provided, and these results should 
not be considered as confirmation of a true difference in the target population. The number of participants 
in the CGM substudy was considerably lower than planned, and therefore the results from this substudy 
were bound to be inconclusive. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
ITSB 
A  total  of  716  subjects  participated,  allocated  to  Humalog  (n=298),  preprandial  LY900014  (n=280)  or 
postprandial  LY900014  (n=138).  The  groups  were  comparable  at  baseline.    The  numbers  of  subjects  in 
each age group are deemed sufficient for granting indication for use. In total 253 subjects aged <12 years 
and 463 subjects aged 12 to <18 years were enrolled. There were only 27 subjects aged 3 to <6 years, of 
whom 10 in the LY900014 group and 10 in the LY900014 group. None were <3 years of age. Hence, the 
data  on  the  youngest  age  group  is  scarce.  The  patients  had  a  mean  baseline  HbA1c  of  7.8% 
(61.8 mmol/mol) and a mean duration of diabetes of 4.6 years.

During  the  4-week  lead-in  period,  all  patients  taking  other  prandial  insulins  at  screening  switched  to 
Humalog  while  remaining  on  their  basal  insulin  regimen  (insulin  glargine,  insulin  detemir,  or  insulin 
degludec)  throughout  the  study.  During  the  lead-in,  emphasis  in  insulin  titration  was  on  basal  insulin 
adjustment. Prandial insulin was planned to be titrated to achieve optimal dosing during the first 12 weeks. 
Figure 28 shows that HbA1c did not markedly change in the Humalog group during the 26-week controlled 
period, whereas in both study arms using LY900014 an initial increase in HbA1c is seen during the 26-week 
comparative  phase  of  the  trial  up  to  12  weeks;  even  though  the  differences  between  treatment  groups 
were small at any visit. During the latter part of the comparative phase, HbA1c decreased and was at 26 
weeks  similar  in  all  three  study  arms.  This  phenomenon  probably  reflects  caution  in  adjusting  prandial 
insulin  after  switching  from  Humalog  to  IP.  Finding  optimal  dosage  of  in  the  LY900014  and 
LY900014+20 arms  seems  to  have  taken  the  entire  study  duration,  26  weeks,  instead  of  the  planned 
12 weeks. At Week 26, however, no statistical differences were seen in either total, basal or prandial insulin 
doses between study groups. 
The study met its primary endpoint, non-inferiority of LY900014 to Humalog also with the relevant NIM for 
EU, 0.3% (3 mmol/mol). The primary objective of noninferiority of LY900014 versus Humalog in change 
from  baseline  in  HbA1c  at  Week  26  was  demonstrated  for  both  the  efficacy  estimand  and  ITT  estimand 
(efficacy  estimand:  LSM  Difference  [95%  CI]  =  -0.02  [-0.17,  0.13];  ITT  estimand:  LSM  Difference 
[95% CI] =  -0.01  [-0.15,  0.14]).  It  is  noteworthy  that  no  improvement  in  mean  glycaemic  control  was 
observed from baseline to 26 weeks in any treatment arm. Mean HbA1c (%/mmol/mol) at Week 26 was 
7.88/62.57, 7.85/62.35 and 7.86/62.41 in the Humalog, LY900014, and LY900014+20 groups, respectively 
(efficacy estimand).  
There  were  two  multiplicity-controlled  endpoints.  Of  these,  superiority  of  LY900014  vs.  Humalog  in 
controlling  glycaemia  (change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline)  was  not  met.  Administering  LY900014  within 
20 minutes from start of meal was demonstrated noninferior to Humalog administered within 0-2 minutes 
before meal.  
As expected, due to accelerated time-action profile, LY900014 reduced postprandial glucose (PPG) levels 
as  measured  by  a  7-point  SMBG  profile.  Notably,  these  analyses  were  not  controlled  for  multiplicity.  At 
Week 26, the difference between LY900014 and Humalog was in favour of Lyumjev from premeal to 1-hour 
postmeal  actual  glucose  excursions  at  breakfast  and  at  dinner  (figures  5.4.2.2.6.2  and  5.4.2.2.6.3), 
however,  the  dinner  premeal  glucose  were  higher  in  those  using  mealtime  LY900014.  The  change  from 
baseline in the daily mean PPG excursion was −0.6 mmol/L (−11.3 mg/dL) with LY900014 compared to 
0.1 mmol/L (1.9 mg/dL) with Humalog. The actual daily average of 1-hour PPG excursions (over all meals) 
was 0.8 mmol/L (13.2 mg/dL) higher at week 26 in the Humalog group than the LY900014 group. 
The accelerated time-action profile of LY900014 also allowed patients to achieve similar glycaemic control 
(HbA1c)  with  postmeal  dosing  (up  to  20  minutes  after  the  start  of  the  meal)  as  premeal  dosing 
(administered  0  to  2  minutes  before  the  start  of  the  meal).  The  option  to  dose  mealtime  insulin 
postprandially is particularly important for paediatric patients for whom predicting the carbohydrate content 
of a meal is not always possible. However, the improvement in PPG values (change from baseline [CFB] in 
PPG  excursions)  was  smaller  when  LY900014  was  dosed  after  the  meal:  CFB  of  daily  mean  glucose 
excursion from premeal to 1-hour postmeal was −0.1 mmol/L (−2.5 mg/dL) for the LY900014+20 group 
vs. −0.6 mmol/L (−11.3 mg/dL) for the LY900014 group. The actual 1-hour postmeal excursion daily mean 
at  Week  26  was  for  LY900014+20  vs.  LY900014,  in  mmol/L  (mg/dL),  0.3  (5.9)  vs.  −0.2  (−3.0), 
respectively. Hence, the PPG results favour premeal administration. Nevertheless, it should be noted that 
these results are not controlled for multiplicity and  are as such  not statistically robust, even though the 
MAH  presents  in  the  CSR  p-values  for  the  comparisons.  Furthermore,  since  no  difference  in  HbA1c  was 
observed  between  premeal  and  postmeal  administration,  postmeal  administration  is  considered  an 
acceptable option when needed, e.g., when the carbohydrate content of the meal is not known before meal, 
similarly as has been approved in adults, and as approved for all age groups using Humalog.

The number of patients in the age group 3 to <6 years (n = 27) was small compared with the 6 to <12 years 
group (n = 226) and the 12 to <18 years group (n = 463). It is also notable that no subjects <3 years of 
age were included in ITSB. Altogether, there were only 5 subjects aged 3 years (1 in the Humalog, 4 in the 
LY900014  and  none  in  the  LY900014+20  group);  7  subjects  aged  4  years  (1  in  the  Humalog,  2  in  the 
LY900014 and 4 in the LY900014+20 group); and 15 subjects aged 5 years (5 in the Humalog, 4 in the 
LY900014 and 6 in the LY900014+20 group).  Hence, the efficacy data in the youngest age group are very 
limited.  The  MAH  states  that  there  were  no  significant  treatment-by-subgroup  interactions  for  age  with 
actual HbA1c and HbA1c change from baseline, thus indicating no differential treatment effect of age on 
HbA1c. In the response to questions from prior assessment round, the MAH nevertheless informed that the 
for  patients  3  to  less  than  6  years  of  age,  there  was  a  greater  HbA1c  reduction  for  LY900014  and 
LY900014+20 groups compared to the Humalog group (LY900014 - Humalog: −0.77% and LY900014+20 
- Humalog: 
0.46%). This could be interpreted to indicate increased efficacy at some time point after meals 
in smaller children, especially since part of the noted increase in hypoglycaemic event rate in subjects aged 
3 to 6 years was according to the MAH’s response to the LoQ due to a larger decrease in HbA1c in this age 
−
group. Nevertheless, the timing of the hypoglycaemic events was not accordant with the faster action profile 
of LY900014. The achieved mean HbA1c (SD) in children aged 3 to 6 years was furthermore very similar 
between the Humalog (N=10) and LY900014 (N=10) groups: 8.0% (0.7) and 7.9% (0.6), respectively. In 
the LY900014+20 group (N=7), the mean achieved HbA1c was somewhat lower: 7.6% (0.6). The change 
from baseline in HbA1c levels at Week 26 for patients 6 to less than 12 years of age and 12 to less than 
18 years of age groups was similar across all treatment groups.  
There is no pharmacological reason to assume different PD effect in the youngest children as opposed to 
older  subjects.  As  a  conclusion,  extrapolation  of  efficacy  data  from  older  children  to  subjects  aged 
1 to 3 year is deemed acceptable.  
Type 2 diabetes 
No  clinical  efficacy  and  safety  trials  were  conducted  with  Lyumjev  in  paediatric  patients  with  T2D.  Even 
though the incidence in T2D is increasing, it remains rare in European children and adolescents and only 
occurs from age of 10 years onwards. T2D is largely treated by other medications and lifestyle measures 
in paediatric patients; however, some of these patients need insulin for control of hyperglycaemia.  
In study ITSA, LY900014 showed an accelerated insulin lispro absorption with a reduction in late insulin 
exposure  compared  to  Humalog  in  children,  adolescents,  and  adults  with  T1D.  Furthermore,  LY900014 
reduced the late insulin lispro exposure compared to Humalog for all study populations, and the total insulin 
lispro  exposure  (AUC[0-inf])  and  tmax  were  comparable  between  LY900014  and  Humalog  in  children, 
adolescents, and adults. 
Additional data in paediatric patients with T2D are not required as per Guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1), since 
the clinical efficacy and safety of Lyumjev (LY900014) has been characterized in paediatric patients with 
T1D and in adults with T1D and T2D.  Furthermore, faster absorption of LY900014 compared to Humalog 
was demonstrated after single dose via SC injection and via CSII in adult and paediatric patients with T1D. 
Consequently,  if  the  B/R  of  Lyumjev  is  finally  considered  positive  in  paediatric  patients  with  T1D,  no 
paediatric efficacy and safety trial would be needed for approval of use of LY900014 in paediatric patients 
with T2D or in paediatric patients using CSII. 
The B/R of Lyumjev in subjects aged 1 year and above is positive. 
HRQoL Addendum 
No differences between study groups were seen in quality of life as measured by the PedsQL questionnaire. 
CGM addendum 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 99/134 
 
 
 
 
Due to a failure to achieve the planned number of participants in the CGM Addendum substudy, the study 
was  underpowered  to  show  difference  for  the  primary  endpoint,  the  iAUC0-2  hours  comparison  between 
LY900014 and Humalog. A numerical difference of 6.7 mg∙h/dL in the postmeal iAUC0–2 hours at Week 26 was 
observed,  which  was  lower  than  expected  by  the  MAH  when  planning  the  sample  size  (assumed  mean 
difference of 22 mg∙h/dL).  
No nominal statistical differences were seen between study groups for time in target glucose ranges, time 
in  hypoglycaemic  glucose  ranges  or  time  spent  in  hyperglycaemic  ranges.  Numerically,  postmeal 
administration of LY900014 was associated with less time in target level than premeal administration of 
LY900014 or Humalog especially during daytime (Figure 28). 
Postprandial ambulatory glucose profiles, obtained in a small subset of subjects (n=28, 24, and 7, in the 
Humalog, LY900014 and LY900014+20 groups, respectively), were visually closely similar between all three 
study groups. However, postmeal administration of LY900014 seems to be associated with an increase at 
1  hour  after  meals  and  a  tendency  toward  hypoglycaemia  at  4  hours  (Figure  28).  No  differences  were 
observed  in  within-day  variability  between  treatments.  Between-day  variability,  contrary  to  the  MAH’s 
claim,  was  numerically  lesser  in  the  Humalog  group  compared  with  the  LY900014  group  at  Week  26. 
Overall,  the  differences  between  treatments  in  variability  were  overall  relatively  small  or  non-existent, 
depending on measure. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
LY900014  was  non-inferior  to  Humalog  in  controlling  glycaemia  (HbA1c)  whether  administered  prior  to 
meal  or  after  the  meal.  The  results  on  postprandial  glucose  (PPG)  excursions  showing  lower  earlier 
postprandial glucose excursions with LY900014 vs. Humalog are not controlled for multiplicity.  
The HbA1c results support the option to administer Lyumjev postprandially when necessary in children and 
adolescents, similarly to adults. 
Few subjects below the age of 6 year old and none below the age of 3 year old were included in the ITSB 
trial.  There  is  no  concern  that  the  efficacy  would  differ  in  children  in  this  age  group  compared  to  older 
children. 
From an efficacy point of view, the benefit-risk of LY900014 in subjects aged 1 year and above is positive. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The  active  substance  of  LY900014,  insulin  lispro,  is  known  for  more  than  20  years.  The  LY900014 
formulation  utilizes  2  enabling  excipients:  treprostinil  and  citrate  with  independent  mechanisms  to 
accelerate the absorption of insulin lispro from the site of injection or infusion resulting in a faster insulin 
time-action profile and in earlier glucose lowering when compared to Humalog.  
The most important adverse events of LY900014 observed in adults with T1D and T2D are hypoglycaemic 
events, as with all insulins. In the pivotal trials in adults, in both T1D and T2D patients, early post-meal 
hypoglycaemia  was  more  frequent  with  LY900014  as  compared  with  Humalog,  whereas  late  post-meal 
hypoglycaemia was more frequent with Humalog. Overall incidence and rate of hypoglycaemic events was 
similar in adult T1D patients who were administered Humalog or LY900014 as MDI regimen. In T2D, the 
incidence  and  rate  of  documented  hypoglycaemia  was  slightly  higher  with  LY900014.  No  difference  was 
seen between LY900014 and Humalog in the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia events in the pivotal trials 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 100/134 
 
 
 
 
 
in adults. 
A markedly higher incidence of injection and infusion site reactions (pain, itching, induration, erythema, 
and oedema) was observed in pivotal trials in adults in subjects administered LY900014 vs. Humalog. The 
incidence of these reactions was for MDI regimens 30 (2.7%) vs 1 (0.1%) (p<0.0001) for LY900014 and 
Humalog, respectively. In the studies on continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) in adults, injection 
site  reactions  were  also  several-fold  more  common  in  subjects  administered  LY900014  than  in  subjects 
using Humalog. It is not certain if the increase in local reactions is due to direct irritation caused by the 
excipients of LY900014 or caused indirectly e.g., by increased blood vessel permeability (sodium citrate) 
and  vasodilatation  (treprostinil)  at  injection  sites.  However,  no  differences  have  been  observed  in  adult 
studies for systemic hypersensitivity reactions between LY900014 and Humalog. 
Please see Section 2.4.1.1.5 of this AR for description of safety assessments of study ITSB. 
2.5.2.  Patient exposure 
A  total  of  418  patients  received  LY900014  in  Study  ITSB.  Three-hundred  and  sixty-one  (86%)  of  those 
patients were exposed to LY900014 for 180 days or more. 
Table 37 summarizes exposure to study drug for Study ITSB. 
Table 37. Summary of Exposure 
2.5.3.  Adverse events  
The incidence of all TEAEs reported  during the study was similar between the study intervention groups 
(Table 38).

Table  38 Summary of Adverse Events from Randomization to Safety Follow-up 
Overall,  reporting  of  TEAEs  was  similar  between  treatment  groups  for  each  PT,  except  for  injection  site 
reactions and depression.  
Thirty-four patients (4.7%) experienced at least 1 TEAE of injection site reactions, with a total of 46 events 
being reported. See section 2.5.6.1 of this AR for further details on injection site reactions. 
There were 3 patients (2.2%) in the LY900014+20 treatment group who reported depression. Two events 
were moderate, 1 event was mild, and none were SAEs. No other events of depression were reported. 
Nasopharyngitis  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  were  the  only  TEAEs  reported  by  at  least  5%  of 
patients. The incidence of patients reporting these TEAEs was similar among the 3 treatment groups. 
2.5.4.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no treatment differences in the incidence of SAEs or in the incidence of SAEs for any PT. 
A total of 20 patients (LY900014, 6 patients; LY900014+20, 2 patients; Humalog, 12 patients) reported 
>1 SAE during the study. Serious adverse events reported by more than 1 patient from randomization to 
follow-up were 
1.  Hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemic coma, n=6 patients 
• 
• 
Hypoglycaemia (n=5): Humalog, 2 patients (0.7%); LY900014, 3 patients (1.1%) 
Hypoglycaemic coma (n=1): Humalog, 1 patient (0.3%) 
2.  Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA), n=3 patients 
• 
LY900014, 2 patients (0.7%); LY900014 postmeal, 1 patient (0.7%) 
o 
One DKA event was considered related to study drug or procedure, as determined 
by  the  investigator.  Upon  further  review,  all  3  events  were  associated  with 
disruption  of  prescribed  dosing  recommendations  (missed  basal  insulin  dose  or 
insufficient bolus insulin dosing). All 3 events resolved following treatment with full 
recovery. 
2.5.5.  Hypoglycaemia 
In  Study  ITSB,  hypoglycaemia  was  assessed  primarily  using  SMBG.  Whenever  hypoglycaemia  was 
suspected, the patients were to 1) check their BG with a study-provided BG meter, and 2) record their BG 
value, the date and time, any associated symptoms, and the treatment administered in their study diary. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 102/134 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia was described using the following definitions: 
•  Documented Glucose Alert; BG≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL): 
o  Documented  symptomatic  hypoglycaemia:  an  event  with 
typical  symptoms  of 
hypoglycaemia. 
o  Documented  asymptomatic  hypoglycaemia:  an  event  without  typical  symptoms  of 
hypoglycaemia. 
o  Documented  unspecified  hypoglycaemia:  with  no  information  about  symptoms  of 
hypoglycaemia available (this has also been called unclassifiable hypoglycaemia). 
•  Documented Clinically Significant Hypoglycaemia with similar criteria as above, except for threshold 
BG<3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) 
o  Documented symptomatic hypoglycaemia 
o  Documented asymptomatic hypoglycaemia 
o  Documented unspecified hypoglycaemia 
•  Severe hypoglycaemia: during these episodes, patients have an altered mental status and cannot 
assist in their own care, may be semiconscious or unconscious, or experience coma with or without 
seizures, and require assistance of another person to actively administer carbohydrate, glucagon, 
or other resuscitative actions. Blood glucose measurements may not be available during such an 
event,  but  neurological  recovery  attributable  to  the  restoration  of  BG  concentration  to  normal  is 
considered  sufficient  evidence  that  the  event  was  induced  by  a  low  BG  concentration 
(BG≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) 
o  Note:  Young  children  will  frequently  require  assistance  with  treatment  of  hypoglycaemia 
but  are  not  experiencing  signs  of  altered  mental  status  or  cognitive  impairment.  Final 
determination was made by the investigator and based on a severe hypoglycaemia event 
meeting the description provided above. 
•  Other hypoglycaemia: 
o  Nocturnal  hypoglycaemia:  any  documented  hypoglycaemic  event  (including  severe 
hypoglycaemia) that occurs between bedtime and waking. 
o  Probable symptomatic hypoglycaemia: an event during which symptoms are present, but 
BG measurement was not reported. 
o  Overall  (or  total)  hypoglycaemia:  this  category  combines  all  cases  of  hypoglycaemia 
(documented hypoglycaemia and probable symptomatic hypoglycaemia, including severe 
hypoglycaemia)  excluding  the  events  of  relative  hypoglycaemia.  Nocturnal  and  severe 
hypoglycaemia are special cases of documented or probable hypoglycaemia. If an event of 
hypoglycaemia  falls  into  multiple  subcategories,  the  event  is  only  counted  once  in  this 
category. 
The final determination of a hypoglycaemic event as an episode of severe hypoglycaemia was made by the 
investigator  based  on  the  medical  need  of  the  child  to  have  required  assistance  (that  is,  altered  mental 
status  or  cognitive  impairment)  and  was  not  predicated  on  the  report  of  a  child  simply  having  received 
assistance. All episodes of severe hypoglycaemia were to be reported as SAEs. 
Statistical analysis of hypoglycaemic events 
The  rate  of  severe  hypoglycaemia  per  100  years  was  compared  between  treatment  groups  using  the 
empirical method that accounts for the heterogeneity between subjects in the underlying event rate. For 
each of the other categories of hypoglycaemia, the number of hypoglycaemia events during a specific period 
after  randomization  (for  example,  Weeks  0  to  12  of  treatment  period)  were  analysed  using  a  negative 
binomial regression model. The model included treatment and age group as covariates. An offset defined 
as the log transformation of treatment exposure in the specific period (days)/365.25 days (or 30 days) was 
included in the model to standardise the rate of hypoglycaemia per year (or per 30 days). The proportion 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 103/134 
 
 
 
 
 
of patients with at least 1 hypoglycaemic event in each category during a specific period after randomization 
was analysed using a logistic regression model including treatment and age group as covariates. 
During  assessment  of  the  MAH’s  response  to  the  first  request  for  supplementary  information  (RSI),  a 
discrepancy  was  noticed  regarding  results  on  hypoglycaemic  events  at  baseline  (i.e.,  during  the  lead-in 
period) reported in the interim clinical study report (CSR) and in the response to the first RSI. In the interim 
CSR submitted with the application, in children aged 3 to <6 years, a markedly higher mean baseline event 
rate of hypoglycaemia (calculated per year) was given for the Humalog group compared with the other two 
groups. The CSR reports a mean rate of documented hypoglycaemia <3.0 mmol/L (<54 mg/dL) of 112.8 
in the Humalog group vs. 52.1 and 61.2, in the LY900014 and LY900014 postmeal groups, respectively. 
On  the  contrary,  the  model-based  estimates  given  in  table  5.1  of  the  response  to  the  first  RSI  below 
indicated  lower  baseline  event  rate  of  hypoglycaemia  in  Humalog  as  compared  with  the  LY900014  and 
LY900014+20 groups.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 104/134 
 
 
 
 
The  MAH  clarified  in  their  response  to  the  second  RSI  that  the programming  instructions  (Analysis  Data 
Model [ADaM] specifications) were not followed to correct a permanent data issue that was identified prior 
to database lock. This programming error affected 9 patients in the full study population. For 7 patients, 
the baseline event rate was inflated because of the incorrect shortened duration (lead-in period start date 
was  the  same  as  the  end  date).  For  1  patient  in  the  3  to  less  than  6  years  of  age  cohort  who  received 
Humalog, the event rate for glucose less than 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) was incorrectly calculated as 730.5 
events per year, but once corrected, it was reduced to 26.1 events per year. This patient had a significant 
impact  on  the  Humalog  group  mean  at  baseline  as  reported  in  the  CSR.  According  to  the  applicant,  the 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 105/134 
 
 
 
 
 
results given in the response to the first RSI were correct, as the programming error had been detected 
already when performing analyses for the response. 
The model used in Lilly’s response to the first RSI included the baseline number of events as a covariate, 
which is equivalent to using baseline hypoglycaemic rate when the baseline duration is approximately the 
same (4 weeks).  
According  to  MAH,  the  2  patients  with  post-baseline  data  errors  were  reported  to  have  had  very  few 
hypoglycaemic events, and once the total duration was corrected, the rate was essentially the same. Thus, 
the MAH informed that this programming error had negligible impact on the overall results (p-values and 
LS means) and conclusions of the post-baseline event rates because the statistical model did not include 
baseline hypoglycaemic rate. 
The updated subgroup analyses for glucose less than 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) for the full study population 
were submitted with the MAH’s response to the second RSI. Remaining analyses on hypoglycaemic events 
and tables and figures thereof in the CSR were received upon request from the MAH with the response to 
third  RSI. The text, tables and figures in this AR, which were compromised by the error, have been updated 
according to the final corrected analyses. 
Severe hypoglycaemia 
There were no treatment differences in the rate or incidence of severe hypoglycaemia. A total of 6 patients 
(LY900014, n=3; Humalog, n=3) experienced an episode of severe hypoglycaemia (table 39). Five of the 
six patients recovered after ingesting  glucose in the form of food or drink and 1 patient recovered after 
having glucagon administered.

Incidence of all documented, nocturnal, and non-nocturnal hypoglycaemia 
Rates of hypoglycaemia from randomisation to week 26 are given in tables 5.5.5.2 [for BG <3.0 mmol/L 
(<54 mg/dL)] and 5.5.5.3 [for BG <3.9 mmol/L (≤70 mg/dL)]. 
There were no treatment differences in the rate of all documented hypoglycaemia with BG <3.0 mmol/L 
(<54 mg/dL). Also, the incidence was similar between the 3 treatment groups with this glycaemic threshold.

Results  on  hypoglycaemia  analysed  relative  to  the  time  of  the  most  recent  mealtime  dose  given  (“post-
dose”) are presented in Figure 28. 
For  the  time  from  Week  0  to  Week  26,  for  BG  <3.0  mmol/L  (<54  mg/dL),  there  was  a  higher  rate  of 
documented hypoglycaemia for

Subgroup Analyses for Hypoglycaemia 
For  all  the  documented  hypoglycaemia  based  on  the  threshold  of  BG  ≤3.9  mmol/L  (70  mg/dL)  and 
<3.0 mmol/L  (54  mg/dL),  event  rate  was  analysed  using  a  negative  binomial  model,  which  includes 
treatment, subgroup and 2-way interaction of subgroup, and treatment. 
The rate and incidence of all documented hypoglycaemia were analysed by the following subgroups in study 
ITSB: age group (Age Group 1, Age Group 2); HbA1c stratum; region; type of basal insulin; prandial insulin 
dosing plan; personal CGM/FGM use, and TEADA status. 
For hypoglycaemia with the threshold of BG <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL), the only observed treatment-by-
subgroup interaction was the “Age Group 2” analysis. Age Group 2 categorized patients into 3 age cohorts: 
0 to <6, 6 to <12, and 12 to <18 years of age. Of note, no subjects <3 years of age participated in the 
study.  In  Age  Group  2,  the  relative  rate  of  hypoglycaemia  with  BG  <3.0  mmol/L  (54  mg/dL)  for  Weeks

0 to 26  was  higher  for  LY900014  and  LY900014+20  compared  to  Humalog,  which  was  driven  by  the 
3 to <6 age  cohort,  in  which  the  relative  rate  of  hypoglycaemia  was  around  3−4  times  higher  in  the 
LY900014 and LY900014+20 groups than in the Humalog group (table 42). This treatment-by-subgroup 
interaction is interpreted by the MAH to be spurious due to the small number of patients in the 0 to <6 age 
cohort who reported the majority of the hypoglycaemic events. Out of the 20 patients in Age Group 3 to 
<6  years  exposed  to  LY900014  (10  with  preprandial  and  10  with  postprandial  administration),  18 
experienced at least 1 hypoglycaemic event (BG <3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL]) during the treatment period. Of 
the 18 patients who experienced at least 1 hypoglycaemic event, one third of patients experienced between 
20 and 66 hypoglycaemic events. Out of the 18 patients who experienced at least 1 hypoglycaemic event 
during the treatment period, 16 patients came from 2 sites in Brazil (n=8) and 2 sites in Ukraine (n=8). 
One  3-year-old  subject  experienced  a  severe  hypoglycaemic  event  with  prolonged  recovery  after 
food/drink.  
Table 42 moreover shows that in the Humalog groups, the LS Mean rate of hypoglycaemia <3.0 mmol/L 
(54  mg/dL)  from  randomisation  to  Week  26  was  about  half  of  the  rate  seen  in  older  children  and 
adolescents. On the contrary, in the LY900014 and LY900014+20 groups, the event rate in children aged 
3  to  <6  years  was  about  double  the  rate  seen  in  older  children  and  adolescents.  In  the  age  groups  of 
children  from  6  to  <12  years  and  adolescents  aged  12  to  <18  years,  the  rate  of  hypoglycaemic 
events/patient/year were in the same range in all age groups. Hence, the marked difference noted in the 
youngest  age  group  was  partly  due  to  both  a  greater  numerical  rate  of  events  in  the  LY900014  and 
LY900014+20  groups  and  a  lower  numerical  rate  of  events  in  the  Humalog  group  when  compared  with 
older children and adolescents.

c) subjects aged 12 to <18 years 
For hypoglycaemia with BG ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL), there was a treatment-by-subgroup interaction for 
personal CGM/FGM use. The rate of hypoglycaemia was similar for LY900014 and Humalog if patients used 
a personal CGM/FGM during the treatment period from baseline to Week 26 (relative rate = 1.05). The rate 
of  hypoglycaemia  was  lower  for  LY900014  compared  to  Humalog  if  patients  were  not  using  a  personal 
CGM/FGM (relative rate = 0.80). 
A  major  objection  was  raised  due  to  the  increased  hypoglycaemia  risk  in  children  <6  years  of  age  for 
hypoglycaemic  events  <3.0  mmol/L  (54  mg/dL).  In  their  response  to  the  first  RSI,  the  MAH  submitted 
summary  statistics  by  age  groups.  The  MAH  explains  the  difference  to  be  partly  due  to  differences  in 
baseline  hypoglycaemia  risk  in  the  three  treatment  groups,  defined  as  hypoglycaemic  events  occurring 
during  the  lead-in  period  when  all  patients  were  treated  with  Humalog.    It  is  agreed  that  there  was  an 
imbalance in the rate of hypoglycaemia in this age group in favour of Humalog compared with the other 
treatment groups at baseline in the analyses submitted with the response. During the 4 weeks of the lead-
in period, the mean (SD) events of hypoglycaemia <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) was for Humalog 1.0 (1.0), 
for  LY900014  4.0  (3.1),  and  for  LY900014+20:  4.7  (6.3).  However,  even  when  adjusting  for  baseline 
hypoglycaemia and achieved HbA1c at week 26, there remained a more than 2-fold risk for hypoglycaemia 
in the LY900014 and LY900014+20 groups vs. Humalog, even if the difference was no more statistically 
significant after the adjustments. Moreover, the further analyses on the rate of hypoglycaemia in the age 
group <6 years submitted by the MAH in the response to the first RSI identified two children with a very 
high rate of hypoglycaemic events <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL), one in the LY900014 group and one in the 
LY900014+20  group  both  of  whom  had  high  hypoglycaemia  rate  already  at  baseline.  The  remaining 
difference  in  hypoglycaemia  risk  after  adjusting  the  hypoglycaemia  rate  for  baseline  rate  and  achieved 
HbA1c level is driven by these outliers.  
The MAH did not consider addition of any warnings regarding hypoglycaemia risk in this age group to be 
warranted, and no warning is required based on analyses included in the MAH’s response to the first RSI.  
Time in Hypoglycaemic and Hyperglycaemic BG ranges/CGM Addendum 
In  the  CGM  Addendum  of  ITSB,  time  spent  in  hypoglycaemia  and  in  hyperglycaemia  were  assessed  as 
secondary endpoints. Note: due to insufficient enrolment in the CGM Addendum, and the subsequent lack 
of study power, it is not possible to draw definitive interpretations of the data collected in this addendum 
(see Section 2.4.1.3 of this AR).

2.5.6.  Hypersensitivity 
2.5.6.1.  Injection site reactions 
A customized MedDRA search of spontaneously reported AEs was used to identify potential injection site 
reactions.  An  eCRF  was  also  used  to  collect  information  on  the  presence  and  severity  of  injection  site 
erythema, induration, pain, pruritus, and oedema for injection site reactions during the study. 
A total of 34 patients (4.7%) experienced at least 1 TEAE of injection site reaction, with a total of 46 events 
being reported.  All of the injection site reactions were mild or moderate in severity.  
More patients in the LY900014 treatment group had injection site reactions compared to Humalog: 
•  Humalog: n=8 (2.7%) 
• 
• 
LY900014+20: n=4 (2.9%). 
LY900014: n=22 (7.9%), and 
Most events experienced by patients in the LY900014 groups were reported as 
• 
• 
• 
injection site reaction (LY900014, n=11; LY900014+20, n=2) 
injection site erythema (LY900014=4; LY900014+20=0), and 
injection site pain (LY900014, n=4; LY900014+20, n=1). 
Two patients in the LY900014 treatment group discontinued study treatment due to AEs of injection site 
reactions.

2.5.6.2.  Systemic Hypersensitivity Reaction  
Three  SMQs  were  used  to  identify  potential  systemic  hypersensitivity  reactions  from  the  spontaneously 
reported AEs, namely, Anaphylactic reaction (SMQ), Angioedema (SMQ), and Hypersensitivity (SMQ). 
There were 36 patients (5.0%) who experienced ≥1 TEAE by broad search terms and 22 patients (3.1%) 
who  experienced  ≥1  TEAE  of  hypersensitivity  by  narrow  search  terms.  None  of  these  hypersensitivity 
reactions were serious. There were no discontinuations of the study or study drug due to hypersensitivity 
reactions.  
Rhinitis  (0.7%),  dermatitis  (0.2%),  rash  (0.5%),  and  hypersensitivity  (0.5%)  were  the  most  common 
events  reported  with  LY900014  treatment.  There  were  more  patients  in  the  LY900014+20  group  (n=4, 
2.9%) versus the Humalog group (n=2, 0.7%) and LY900014 group (n=1, 0.4%) who experienced events 
included among broad search terms for angioedema (Table 43).

2.5.7.  Treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies 
Overall, 686 participants were evaluable for anti-drug antibodies (ADA) at baseline. Of these, 493 (71.9%) 
patients were positive for pre-existing ADAs. Out of the 493 patients, 477 (96.8%) patients were positive 
for cross-reactive ADAs.  
There  were  no  meaningful  differences  in  incidence  of  treatment-emergent  anti-insulin  lispro  antibodies 
(TEADA) between the treatment groups (Humalog, LY900014, LY900014 + 20) post baseline (table 44). 
Similarly, there were no meaningful differences between the treatment groups in cross-reactivity to native 
insulin.

randomization to Week 26. Safety population with positive TEADA response excluding China. 
In subgroups analyses, TEADA status was not related to HbA1c or hypoglycaemia. The development of 
TEADA was not associated with an increased risk for hypersensitivity or injection site reactions. (Data not 
shown for brevity) 
2.5.8.  Laboratory findings and Vital Signs 
There  were  no  clinically  meaningful  treatment  differences  in  chemistry  laboratory  tests  at  the  last 
observation  carried  forward  endpoint,  haematology  laboratory  values,  or  in  the  incidence  of  treatment 
emergent abnormal laboratory values (data not shown for brevity). 
The  were  no  clinically  meaningful  differences  in  the  vital  sign  measurements,  physical  examination 
assessments, or other observations related to safety in Study ITSB. There were no treatment differences 
in the proportions of patients with treatment-emergent high or low vital signs (data not shown for brevity).

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Two  patients  (0.3%),  both  from  the  LY900014  treatment  group,  reported  AEs  leading  to  treatment 
discontinuation:  one  reported  moderate  injection  site  pain  and  the  other  reported  mild  injection  site 
reaction. 
Post marketing experience 
The safety and efficacy of insulin lispro are well established through the Humalog development program 
and over 20 years of postmarketing experience. No postmarketing experience is available for LY900024, 
since it has so far been indicated for use in adults only. 
2.5.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The collection of safety data was appropriately planned in study ITSB. The definitions used for describing 
hypoglycaemia were in line with international recommendations for diabetes trials. Immunogenicity testing 
was performed adequately. Safety monitoring was conducted in compliance with international regulations 
and GCP guidelines. 
There were no deaths. There were no marked differences in the incidence of SAEs between treatments. The 
SAEs reported by more than 1 patient were hypoglycaemia or hypoglycaemic coma (6 subjects), including 
5 reported as hypoglycaemias, of which 2 (0.7%) in the Humalog group and 3 (1.1%), in the LY900014 
group; 1 hypoglycaemic coma (in the Humalog group), and 3 cases of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA).  The 
DKA cases occurred in 2 patients (0.7%) in the LY900014 group and 1 patient (0.7%) in the LY900014+20. 
In all cases of DKA, the reason was determined to be due to non-compliance of the prescribed guidelines 
or omission of necessary insulin administration. 
The  overall  rate  and  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia  observed  in  paediatric  patients  in  Study  ITSB  with 
LY900014 treatment is consistent with the hypoglycaemia findings in adult patients with diabetes who were 
treated with LY900014. The incidence for documented, nocturnal, and non-nocturnal hypoglycaemia was 
similar between LY900014 and Humalog for the BG threshold <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL).  For the higher BG 
threshold (BG ≤3.9 mmol/L [70 mg/dL]), the incidence of documented and non-nocturnal hypoglycaemia 
was  lower  in  the  LY900014+20  group  (postprandial  administration)  vs.  Humalog,  and  the  incidence  of 
nocturnal hypoglycaemia was lower in the LY900014+20 group vs. LY900014 group. However, no difference 
was  seen  in  the  incidence  of  hypoglycaemic  events  between  pre-prandially  administered  Lyumjev  and 
Humalog. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between treatment groups for the rates/year 
of all documented, nocturnal, and non-nocturnal hypoglycaemia at baseline and from Weeks 0 to 26 when 
using either the threshold of BG threshold <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) or BG ≤3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). More 
information was requested to understand why the total incidence and rate of hypoglycaemic events seemed 
to  be  larger  than  the  sum  of  nocturnal  and  non-nocturnal  hypoglycaemic  events  for  all  three  treatment 
groups (see Tables 5.5.5.2 and 5.5.5.3). The MAH clarified this issue in their response to the first RSI: the 
total  incidence  and  rate  of  hypoglycaemic  events  included  all  documented  symptomatic,  documented 
asymptomatic,  unclassifiable  and  severe  events,  whereas  the  table  on  nocturnal  and  non-nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia included documented symptomatic and severe events.  
In subjects aged 3 to <6 years, the rate of hypoglycaemia below BG <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) was 3−4-
fold  higher  in  the  LY900014  and  LY900014+20  group  than  in  the  Humalog  group.  Compared  with  older 
children and adolescents, the 3- to <6-year-old subjects had a lower rate of hypoglycaemia in the Humalog 
group but a higher rate of hypoglycaemia in the LY900014 and LY900014+20 groups. Out of the 20 patients 
exposed to LY900014 (10 with preprandial and 10 with postprandial administration) in Age Group 3 to <6 
years, 18 experienced at least 1 hypoglycaemic event (BG <3.0 mmol/L [54 mg/dL]) during the treatment

period. Out of the 18 patients who experienced at least 1 hypoglycaemic event during the treatment period, 
16  patients  came  from  2  sites  in  Brazil  (n=8)  and  2  sites  in  Ukraine  (n=8).  One  3-year-old  subject 
experienced a severe hypoglycaemic event with prolonged recovery after food/drink. According to the MAH, 
regional differences in the management of T1D in children may have impacted insulin dose titration in this 
younger age group and may have contributed to increased hypoglycaemia observed at these sites. On the 
other hand, since there were only 27 subjects aged 3 to <6 years in this subgroup analysis (n=7, 10, and 
10  in  the  Humalog,  LY900014  and  LY900014+20  groups,  respectively),  the  16  subjects  from  Brazil  and 
Ukraine  with  hypoglycaemia  <3.0  mmol/L  (54  mg/dL)  constituted  a  majority  of  all  subjects  in  this  age 
group. Due to the low number of subjects in this age group, firm conclusions on risk of hypoglycaemia in 
these youngest patients cannot be drawn. It is noteworthy that the overall glycaemic control was similar 
across age groups and does not explain the excess risk of hypoglycaemia in the youngest age group. More 
detailed information on this issue was requested for assessment of safety of LY900014 in youngest children.  
It is also noteworthy that even though inclusion criteria would have allowed subjects from age of 1 year, 
none below 3 years of age were included in the study. The MAH was requested to submit a detailed analysis 
of hypoglycaemic events in patients aged 3 to 12 years vs. other paediatric age groups and to discuss if 
the excess risk of hypoglycaemia in the youngest age group should be reflected in the Product Information.  
Further analyses provided by the MAH showed that the timing of the hypoglycaemia events in relation to 
the meal were relatively similar between treatment groups in children aged 3 to <12 years. The majority 
of events occurred after the first hour with most events seen at 2 to less than 4 hours (Humalog 31.6%; 
LY900014 33.2%; LY900014 postmeal 37.6%). The majority of hypoglycaemia events in children aged 3 
to <12 years occurred during the non-nocturnal time in all 3 treatment groups (Humalog 88.1%; LY900014 
89.4%;  LY900014  postmeal  89.8%).  Data  on  timing  of  hypoglycaemia  were  not  given  separately  for 
children aged 3 to <6 years. Analysis of HbA1c at Week 26 versus post-baseline hypoglycaemia event rate 
for all patients aged 3−<12 years showed increase in hypoglycaemia with HbA1c <8.0 % in all treatment 
arms,  which  is  expectable.  An  analysis  on  the  relation  of  insulin  dosage  and  hypoglycaemic  events 
demonstrated less hypoglycaemia with larger insulin dose, which reflects easier control of hypoglycaemia 
in older children, who are bigger and therefore have a higher total insulin dose. 
In their response to the first RSI, the MAH submitted summary statistics for patient characteristics by age 
groups.  At  baseline,  children  aged  3−<6  years  who  were  randomised  to  either  the  LY900014  or 
LY900014+20  treatment  group  had  more  hypoglycaemic  events  <3.0  mmol/L  (54  mg/dL)  compared  to 
Humalog (Humalog: 1.0, LY900014: 4.0 and LY900014+20: 4.7 events). After adjusting for both baseline 
hypoglycaemia and for HbA1c at Week 26, the differences were no longer statistically significant, but the 
numerical difference in the rate of hypoglycaemia <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) remained more than 2-fold in 
the LY900014 and LY900014+20 groups compared with the Humalog group. Baseline hypoglycaemic events 
were  events  that  occurred  during  the  lead-in  period  when  all  patients  were  treated  with  Humalog.  Such 
imbalance at baseline occurs easily by chance when the number of subjects is low and may indeed have 
major impact on results.  Hence, lower baseline hypoglycaemia in the Humalog group vs. the other two 
groups could partly explain the observed difference in hypoglycaemia rate between the Humalog group and 
the  two  LY900014  groups.  Furthermore,  this  finding  could  also  explain  the  observation  that  the 
hypoglycaemia rate was lower in the Humalog group of subjects aged 3−<6 years in comparison to older 
children  and  adolescents  in  the  Humalog  group.  However,  an  analysis  on  hypoglycaemic  events 
<3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) included in the CSR for the same age group yielded seemingly discrepant results 
from the currently submitted analysis, with markedly higher mean baseline event rate of hypoglycaemia 
(calculated per year) in the Humalog group. The MAH was requested to discuss and clarify the differences 
between the analyses in the response and the CSR. The MAH explained in the response to the second RSI 
that the discrepancy was due to a programming error in the analyses included in the CSR, which had been 
corrected  in  the  analyses  submitted  with  the  response  to  the  first  RSI.  In  the  response  analysis,  the 
hypoglycaemia rate (events/patient/year) during the lead-in period, when all subjects received Humalog

as  prandial  insulin  (i.e., prior  to  randomisation),  was  12.2  in  the  Humalog  group,  52.1  in  the  LY900014 
group  and  61.2  in  the  LY900014  postmeal  group.  The  MAH  was  further  requested  to  perform  a 
comprehensive analysis of hypoglycaemic events to exclude errors caused by the identified programming 
error. The updated analyses received with the MAH’s response to the third RSI confirmed the previously 
drawn conclusions on the risk for hypoglycaemia. There were only minor numerical differences to originally 
submitted results. All results presented in this AR have been updated according to the MAH’s response to 
third RSI. 
The MAH submitted further analyses on the rate of hypoglycaemia in the age group <6 years compared 
with  other  age  groups  and  with  Humalog  in  the  response  to  the  first  RSI.  These  analyses  identified  two 
children  with  a  very  high  rate  of  hypoglycaemic  events  <3.0  mmol/L  (54  mg/dL),  one  in  the  LY900014 
group and one in the LY900014+20 group. The outliers could be considered as responsible for the remaining 
2-fold difference in hypoglycaemia risk after adjusting for baseline rate and achieved HbA1c.  
Overall, the number of subjects aged 3 to <6 is very low, hence, the data are scarce and the differences in 
hypoglycaemic  events  seem  to  be  due  to  chance  and  not  by  differential  PD  of  Lyumjev  and  Humalog  in 
children  <6  years  of  age.  The  MAH  did  not  consider  the  need  for  addition  of  any  warnings  regarding 
hypoglycaemia risk in this age group to be warranted, and this is agreed with. In the entire study population, 
only 6 patients (LY900014, n=3; Humalog, n=3) experienced an episode of severe hypoglycaemia; and no 
difference was seen in total hypoglycaemic event rate between treatments.  
In the CGM Addendum of ITSB, consistent with the known faster time-to-action profile of LY900014, the 
rate  and  incidence  of  post-dose  hypoglycaemia  was  higher  for  LY900014  compared  to  Humalog  at 
≤1 and ≤2 hours and lower for LY900014 compared to Humalog at >4 hours after the prandial dose. Time 
spent in hypoglycaemia (<3.0 mmol/L [70 mg/dL] seems numerically higher especially during daytime in 
the LY900014+20 group (34.7 minutes) than the two other groups (28 and 25 minutes in the LY900014 
and the Humalog group, respectively) (Figure 33). However, the differences between treatments in the rate 
and incidence of postprandial hypoglycaemic events were overall small from a clinical point of view.  
No treatment differences for time spent in hypoglycaemic or hyperglycaemic ranges were seen in the CGM 
Addendum of ITSB. However, lack of study power caused by insufficient enrolment in the CGM Addendum 
prevents definitive interpretation of the CGM data. 
Similar  to  adult  trials  with  LY900014,  the  incidence  of  injection  site  reactions  was  markedly  higher  in 
subjects  administered  LY900014  than  Humalog.  The  reactions  were  reported  as  injection  site  reaction, 
injection site erythema or injection site pain. However, whereas in adult trials the difference in injection 
site  reactions  was  >10-fold  between  LY900014  and  Humalog,  in  study  ITSB  the  difference  was  around 
3-fold:    injection  site  reactions  were  reported  for  8  subjects  (2.7%)  in  the  Humalog  group,  22  subjects 
(7.9%) in the LY900014 group, and 4 subjects (2.9%) in the LY900014+20 group. All reported injection 
site reactions were mild or moderate, but two subjects discontinued LY900014 due to these reactions. 
No difference between treatments was observed in immunogenicity. The majority of subjects (71.9%) were 
positive  for  pre-existing  anti-insulin-lispro  antibodies  (ADA)  at  baseline,  and  96.8  %  of  subjects  were 
positive  for  ADA  cross-reactive  to  native  insulin.  No  clinically  meaningful  differences  were  seen  in 
treatment-emergent  ADA  (TEADA),  and  there  was  no  implication  of  effect  of  TEADA  on  efficacy  or 
hypersensitivity. 
2.5.10.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Overall,  the  safety  profile  of  LY900014  in  children  and  adolescents  is  consistent  with  the  known  safety 
profile  of  Lyumjev  in  adult  subjects.  Treatment  with  LY900014  carries  an  overall  similar  risk  for 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

hypoglycaemia as treatment with Humalog, but with an earlier postprandial timing of hypoglycaemic events 
due to faster time-to-action-profile of LY900014.  
In children aged 3 to <6 years, hypoglycaemia below 3 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) occurred more frequently with 
LY900014  than  Humalog.  However,  the  data  are  scarce  for  this  age  group  and  the  observed  difference 
seems to be due to different baseline hypoglycaemia rate between study arms, different change in HbA1c, 
and two outliers with very high hypoglycaemia rate. Consequently, the differences seem to be due to chance 
in the very small group of subjects aged 3 to <6 years. No data are available for subjects below the age of 
3  years,  but  since  there  is  no  reason  to  assume  differential  PD  effect  of  LY900014  in  subjects  aged  <3 
years vs. >3 years, the results on safety can be extrapolated to children aged 1 to <3 years.  
No  other  new  safety  concerns  were  identified.  Similar  to  adults,  injection  site  reactions  are  several-fold 
more frequent with LY900014 compared to Humalog in children and adolescents, too. These reactions are 
mild to moderate but do sometimes lead to discontinuation of treatment. 
From a safety point of view, the B/R of Lyumjev is positive in children and adolescents aged 1 year and 
above. 
In addition, the MAH should submit the following safety data in the next PSUR: hypoglycaemias in the 
age group 1 to <6 years.

2.10.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4,2, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated to include indication for use and information on safety, efficacy, and PK/PD of Lyumjev in 
paediatric patients aged 1 year and above. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found unacceptable for the following reasons: 
The MAH justifies absence of user consultation or bridging report by stating that the “addition of the new 
indication  targets  a  similar  patient  group  and  their  parents  or  caregivers  as  the  one  that  made  up  the 
representative  test  population  for  the  performed  user  testing.  The  proposed  text  modifications  to  the 
package leaflet resulting from the addition of this new indication are minor and do not include text that is 
significantly different from that user tested”. 
It is agreed that the structure and design of the revised Lyumjev Package Leaflets have not changed due 
to the new information and there are no changes which alter overall readability. However, the user tests 
on the Lyumjev PL submitted within the MAA were performed with only adult subjects: for the cartridge, 
user  test  with  target  group  of  adults  aged  31  to  58  years;  for  KwikPen  100U/mL,  a  bridging  report;  for 
KwikPen 100 U/mL, user test with adults aged 20 to 66 years; and for the vial, user test with adults aged 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 124/134 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
21 to 57 years. 
Hence,  no  readability  testing  has  been  performed  with  paediatric  age  groups.  With  growing  age,  a  child 
with  diabetes  typically  takes  more  and  more  responsibility  of  their  insulin  treatment,  including,  e.g. 
injections during school days. Many teenagers have full responsibility of their insulin treatment, some are 
not even living with their parents. The guideline on the readability of the labelling and package leaflet of 
medicinal products for human use (Rev.1, 12 Jan 2009) states the following general consideration: “If the 
package leaflet is well designed and clearly worded, this maximises the number of people who can use the 
information, including older children and adolescents, those with poor literacy skills and those with some 
degree of sight loss.”  
The MAH was requested to justify why results of the prior PL readability tests conducted in adults could be 
extrapolated  to  paediatric  age  groups  and  parents/caregivers  of  children,  who  were  not  included  in  the 
target groups of the tests. In their response to the first RSI, the MAH has justified that no further testing 
of the Lyumjev PL or device are needed to be performed, since readability tests and human factor studies 
in  children  and  adolescents  were  performed  on  the  Humalog  KwikPen  and  Humalog  Junior  KwikPen 
presentations, which are similar to the corresponding Lyumjev presentations. It is agreed that the results 
of these Humalog tests can be extrapolated to Lyumjev.  
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is one of the most common chronic diseases in children and adolescents. A 
great majority of paediatric subjects with diabetes suffer from T1D and have subtotal or total loss of insulin 
secretion. In adolescents, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D) is occurring more and more frequently in those 
with  obesity  and  in  high-risk  ethnic  populations.  However,  T2D  remains  relatively  rare  in  the  general 
European  population.    Both  types  of  diabetes  carry  a  risk  for  chronic  complications  caused  by 
hyperglycaemia. 
With this application the MAH seeks to extend the indication for Lyumjev to include children and adolescents 
from the age of 1 year. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Children and adolescents with T1D are dependent on daily and lifelong insulin treatment. T1D is in general 
treated by a multiple-dose insulin (MDI) regimen or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) via an 
insulin pump to mimic physiological insulin secretion as closely as possible.  
T2D is typically managed with diet, exercise, oral antihyperglycemic medications, GLP1 receptor agonists, 
and sometimes exogenous insulin.  
Both types of diabetes are associated with long-term complications caused by chronic hyperglycaemia. In 
T2D,  obesity-associated  metabolic  disturbances  linked  to  insulin  resistance  increase  the  risk  for 
complications. Several long-term studies in both T1D and T2D have demonstrated that long-term diabetic 
complications can be reduced by successful treatment of hyperglycaemia. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Aggressive treatment of hyperglycaemia carries along the risk for hypoglycaemia, which can be severe and 
life-threatening. The challenge to obtain good glycaemic control in the absence of hypoglycaemia is greater 
in a paediatric population compared to an adult population due to growth, more variable lifestyle, need of 
assistance with insulin injections, and hormonal changes. Changes in eating and physical activity are also 
less predictable in paediatric patients. 
LY900014 provides another treatment option for paediatric patients with diabetes. LY900014 more closely 
mimics  endogenous  insulin  action  compared  to  Humalog.  However,  there  is  already  on  market  another 
faster-acting mealtime insulin, faster-acting aspart, authorised for use in patients aged 1 year and above. 
Preferably, mealtime insulin bolus doses should be administered prior to meals for optimal timing of the 
peak effect of insulin with the postprandial glycaemic excursion. However, flexibility in dose timing (up to 
20 minutes after a meal) provided by LY900014 is also important for young children with diabetes due to 
unpredictable eating, which hampers defining the correct insulin dose for the meal. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study  ITSB  was  a  26-week,  Phase  3,  prospective,  randomized,  outpatient,  multinational,  multicentre, 
parallel,  active-controlled  study  conducted  in  paediatric  patients  (age  range  3  to  <18  years)  with  T1D 
currently using an MDI regimen. The study was designed to test the hypothesis that LY900014 is noninferior 
to  Humalog  on  glycaemic  control  (change  in  HbA1c)  as  the  primary  endpoint.  Two  secondary  gated 
objectives  were  1)  to  test  the  hypothesis  that  LY900014  administered  as  postprandial  insulin  up  to 
20 minutes after the start of a meal (LY900014+20) is noninferior to Humalog, administered as prandial 
insulin (0 to 2 minutes prior to the meal), on glycaemic control, and 2) to test the hypothesis that LY900014 
is superior to Humalog in improving glycaemic control (HbA1c) when administered as prandial insulin (0 to 2 
minutes prior to the meal). 
A subset of subjects in ITSB participated in a substudy, “CGM addendum”, evaluating the 24-hour glucose 
profile captured with Dexcom G6® CGM System (Dexcom G6) for LY900014 and Humalog. The primary 
objective of the CGM Addendum was to compare the iAUC0-2 hours after the start of meals between the 
two  treatments.  Due  to  unsuccessful  recruitment,  this  voluntary  substudy  was  not  powered  to  show  a 
difference between LY900014 and Humalog. 
Data form ITSB is presented for 716 randomised subjects, of whom 298 in the Humalog group, 280 in the 
LY900014 group, and 138 in the LY900014+20 group. Of the subjects, none were <3 years, 27 were aged 
3 to <6 years, 226 aged 6 to <12 years, and 463 aged 12 to <18 years. The demographic and baseline 
characteristics were balanced between groups. A high proportion of subjects completed the trial: 96.6% of 
the Humalog group, 95% of the LY900014 group, and 97.8% of the LY900014+20 group. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study ITSB met its primary objective, since non-inferiority of LY900014 to Humalog, both administered 
within 0-2 minutes prior to meal, was demonstrated with the relevant NIM for EU, 0.3% (3 mmol/mol). 
Non-inferiority  of  LY900014  versus  Humalog  in  change  from  baseline  in  HbA1c  at  Week  26  was 
demonstrated for both the efficacy estimand and ITT estimand (efficacy estimand: LSM Difference [95% 
CI] = -0.02 [-0.17, 0.13]; ITT estimand: LSM Difference [95% CI] = -0.01 [-0.15, 0.14]). It is noteworthy 
that  no  improvement  in  mean  glycaemic  control  was  observed  from  baseline  to  26  weeks  in  any  of  the 
treatment arms. 
Of the two multiplicity-controlled secondary endpoints, superiority of LY900014 vs. Humalog in controlling 
glycaemia  (change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline)  was  not  met.  However,  the  other  multiplicity-controlled 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 126/134 
 
 
 
 
secondary endpoint was met: postprandially (within 20 minutes from start of meal) administered LY900014 
was non-inferior to preprandial Humalog (within 0-2 minutes before meal) in terms of change in HbA1c. 
The proportion of patients with HbA1c <7% and <7.5% at Week 26 were similar in all three arms of the 
study.  At  Week  26,  approximately  20%  of  patients  achieved  the  HbA1c  target  <7%  in  all  three  study 
groups. 
In comparison to Humalog, LY900014 reduced postprandial glucose levels as measured by a 7-point self-
monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) profile, which is an expected finding for an insulin with a known faster 
time-to-action profile. Since the analyses on postprandial glucose were not controlled for multiplicity, any 
references  to  statistical  significance  are  considered  as  nominal  and  not  indicative  of  true  difference  in  a 
confirmatory sense. The LS mean change from baseline at week 26 in the daily mean postprandial glucose 
excursion at 1 hour was −0.6 mmol/L (−11.2 mg/dL) with LY900014 compared to 0.1 mmol/L (1.3 mg/dL) 
with Humalog; with a LSM difference of −0.7 mmol/L (95% CI −1.0, −0.4) [−12.5 mg/dL (95% CI −17.5, 
−7.6)]. 
Postprandial  glucose  excursions  according  to  SMBG  were  numerically  higher  when  LY900014  was  dosed 
after the meal. The LS mean difference in change from baseline in 1-hour PPG excursion between premeal 
and postmeal administered LY900014 was 0.5 mmol/L  (95% CI 0.1, 0.9) [8.9 mg/dL (95% CI 2.2, 15.5)] 
in favour of premeal vs. postmeal administration of LY900014. 
No differences were observed between treatments in daily mean bolus, basal or total insulin dose at week 
26.  
The substudy investigating HRQoL demonstrated no differences between study arms as measured by the 
PedsQL  questionnaire.  This  finding  is  concordant  with  pivotal  trials  in  adults,  which  also  failed  to 
demonstrate any benefit on HRQoL by LY900014.   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Data in for patients under the age of 6 years in study ITSB is overall scarce. Only 27 patients, of whom 10 
in the LY900014 group and 10 in the LY900014+20 group, participated in the study. Of note, no subjects 
below the age of 3 years were included in the study.  
There seems to be a numerical trend for increase in HbA1c during the first 12 weeks of the study in the 
LY900014  and  LY900014+20  groups  compared  with  the  Humalog  group.  However,  the  difference  is  no 
longer evident at Week 26. Since the differences between treatments at each measurement point during 
the study were not significant, this issue is not pursued further. 
The analyses on PPG excursions based on SMBG (see above in Section 3.2) in paediatric subjects were not 
controlled for multiplicity.  
Unfortunately, the substudy CGM addendum of ITSB was unpowered to demonstrate differences between 
study arms due to recruitment problems and consequent low number of subjects. Hence, even though the 
primary endpoint of iAUC0-2hours after all meals was numerically better for LY900014 vs. Humalog, no firm 
conclusions can be drawn from this finding. Additionally, robust data on time in glycaemic target glucose 
level are not available due to lack of power. No relevant difference was observed in time in glucose range 
3.9 to 10.0 mmol/L (70 to 180 mg/dL) between LY900014 and Humalog; both groups spent <50% time in 
this range.

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
There were no deaths reported in study ITSB. There was a total of 20 patients who reported serious adverse 
events (SAEs) during the study, with a higher number of SAEs in the Humalog treatment group: Humalog, 
n=12  (4.0%),  LY900014,  n=6  (2.1%),  and  LY900014+20,  n=2  (1.4%).  SAEs  reported  by  more  than  1 
patient  from  randomization  to  safety  follow-up  were  hypoglycaemia  (Humalog,  n=2;  LY900014,  n=3; 
LY900014+20, n=0) and diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA, Humalog, n=0; LY900014, n=2; LY900014+20, n=1). 
All 3 events of DKA were assessed by investigator to be due to non-administration of insulin according to 
prescribed  guidelines  or  omission  of  insulin  dosing  and  unrelated  to  study  drug.  All  3  events  resolved 
following treatment with full recovery. 
The  overall  rate  and  incidence  of  hypoglycaemia  observed  in  paediatric  patients  in  Study  ITSB  with 
LY900014 treatment was similar compared to Humalog and consistent with the hypoglycaemia findings in 
adult  patients  with  diabetes  who  were  treated  with  LY900014.  A  total  of  6  patients  (LY900014,  n=3; 
Humalog, n=3) experienced an episode of severe hypoglycaemia. However, in subjects aged 3 to <6 years, 
the rate of hypoglycaemia below BG <3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) was 3−4-fold higher in the LY900014 and 
LY900014+20  group  than  in  the  Humalog  group.  Compared  with  older  children  and  adolescents,  the 
3 to <6-year-old subjects had a lower rate of hypoglycaemia in the Humalog group but  a higher rate of 
hypoglycaemia  in  the  LY900014  and  LY900014+20  groups.  No  data  are  available  for  subjects  aged 
<3 years. 
Similar  to  adult  trials  with  LY900014,  the  incidence  of  injection  site  reactions  was  markedly  higher  in 
subjects administered LY900014 than Humalog. However, whereas in adult trials the difference in injection 
site reactions was around 10-fold between LY900014 and Humalog, in study ITSB the difference was around 
3-fold  in  comparison  to  Humalog.  All  reported  injection  site  reactions  were  mild  or  moderate;  however, 
2 subjects discontinued study drug due to injection site reactions. 
No difference was observed in immunogenicity between LY900014 and Humalog. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The  information  on  the  risk  for  hypoglycaemia  in  paediatric  subjects  is  scarce  and  insufficient  for 
assessment  of  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  observed  markedly  higher  risk  for  hypoglycaemia  below 
3.0 mmol/L (54 mg/dL) in subjects aged from 3 to <6 years. Furthermore, no data are available for subjects 
below the age of 3 years. The MAH was requested to further analyse and discuss the observed excess risk 
for  hypoglycaemia  in  this  age  group.  Additional  analyses  by  the  MAH  showed  that  this  difference  was 
reduced but was still more than 2-fold after adjusting for baseline hypoglycaemic rate and achieved HbA1c 
level at Week 26. Moreover, the MAH identified two individual subjects, one in the LY900014 group and one 
in the LY900014+20 group, whose high rate of hypoglycaemic events may have partly driven the difference 
seen between these treatment regimens vs. Humalog, which is interpreted to account for the remaining 
risk after the adjusted analysis, based on a scatter plot with the outliers excluded from the analysis.  
Overall, the submitted analyses indicate that the difference is likely due to chance. 
A discrepancy was noticed regarding results on hypoglycaemic events at baseline (i.e., during the lead-in 
period) reported in the interim CSR and in the response to the first RSI. In the interim CSR, in children 
aged  3  to  <6  years,  a  markedly  higher  mean  baseline  event  rate  of  hypoglycaemia  was  given  for  the 
Humalog group compared with the other two groups, whereas the model-based estimates in the response 
to the first RSI indicated lower baseline event rate of hypoglycaemia with Humalog as compared with the 
LY900014  and  LY900014+20  groups.  The  MAH  clarified  in  their  response  to  the  second  RSI  that  the 
discrepancy was due to a programming error identified prior to database lock but not corrected for in the 
analyses for the interim CSR. However, analyses submitted with the first and second response to LoQ were 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 128/134 
 
 
 
 
correct. This programming error affected 9 patients in the full study population. For 7 patients, the baseline 
event rate was inflated because of the incorrect shortened duration (lead-in period start date was the same 
as the end date). For 1 patient in the 3 to less than 6 years of age cohort who received Humalog, the event 
rate for glucose less than 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) was incorrectly calculated as 730.5 events per year, but 
once corrected, it was reduced to 26.1 events per year. This patient had a significant impact on the Humalog 
group mean.  
For the two patients with post-baseline data errors, there was, according to the MAH, negligible impact on 
the  event  rate  because  very  few  hypoglycaemic  events  were  reported,  and  once  the  total  duration  was 
corrected, the rate was essentially the same. The MAH stated that this programming error had negligible 
impact  on  the  overall  results  (p-values  and  LS  means)  and  conclusions  of  the  post-baseline  event  rates 
because the statistical model did not include baseline hypoglycaemic rate. 
The updated subgroup analyses for glucose less than 54 mg/dL (3.0 mmol/L) for the full study population 
were submitted with the MAH’s response to the second RSI. However, all analyses on hypoglycaemic events 
and tables and figures thereof in the CSR were not repeated and submitted by the MAH with either response 
to first or second RSI. Therefore, the MAH was requested to perform all analyses on hypoglycaemic events 
included in the CSR for the total study population and subgroups with the correct numbers and submit the 
updated texts, figures and tables concerning hypoglycaemia. The requested analyses were received with 
the MAH’s response to the third RSI. There were several but minor numerical changes in the results. None 
of  the  repeated  analyses  revealed  any  findings  of  clinical  importance  that  would  change  the  conclusions 
regarding risk for hypoglycaemia in paediatric patients.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
LY900014  was  shown  to  be  non-inferior  to  Humalog  in  paediatric  age  groups:  the  mean  HbA1c 
(%/mmol/mol) at Week 26 was 7.88/62.57, 7.85/62.35 and 7.86/62.41 in the Humalog, LY900014, and 
LY900014+20 groups, respectively (efficacy estimand).  
Superiority  of  LY900014  vs.  Humalog  in  controlling  glycaemia  (change  in  HbA1c  from  baseline)  was  not 
met.  Administering  LY900014  within  20  minutes  from  start  of  meal  was  demonstrated  noninferior  to 
Humalog administered within 0-2 minutes before meal. No data are available for subjects aged <3 years, 
and data on subjects <6 years of age is scarce. Nevertheless, there is no indication of differential efficacy 
based  on  age,  since  the  HbA1c  levels  were  similar  in  all  paediatric  age  groups.  From  a  pharmacological 
point of view, similar efficacy is expected also in patients below the age of 3 years.  
Administering  LY900014  after  meal  was  not  as  efficacious  as  premeal  administration  for  glucose  control 
during the early postprandial period. However, in light of the similar HbA1c achieved in groups administering 
LY900014 premeal and postmeal, postprandial administration can be accepted as an option in situations 
when the carbohydrate and energy content of the meal cannot be anticipated. Postprandial administration 
has been accepted for adults using Lyumjev and for all age groups using Humalog. This option is important 
especially for toddlers. 
There was a 3−4-fold increased rate of documented, clinically relevant hypoglycaemia below 3.0 mmol/L 
(54  mg/dL)  in  subjects  younger  than  6  years  in  the  LY900014  and  LY900014+20  groups  vs.  Humalog 
group.  After  adjusting  for  baseline  hypoglycaemia  rate  and  for  HbA1c  at  week  26,  these  differences 
remained  >2-fold.  No  data  are  available  for  patients  aged  1  to  <3  years.  The  increased  rate  of 
hypoglycaemia in the age group of 3 to <6 years is not explained by overall glycaemic control, which was 
overall similar in terms of HbA1c at week 26. After exclusion of two outliers (one in the LY900014 group 
and one in the LY900014+20 group) with a very high hypoglycaemia rate, this difference in hypoglycaemic 
event rate between study groups is no longer seen. 
The risk for injection site reactions is several-fold higher with LY900014 compared with Humalog. However, 
the difference between LY900014 and Humalog in the risk of injection site reactions was lower in paediatric 
subjects  in  study  ITSB  than  was  seen  in  adult  pivotal  trials.  Moreover,  these  reactions  were  mild  to 
moderate and rarely lead to discontinuation of LY900014. 
Additional data in paediatric patients with T2D are not required as per Guideline on clinical investigation of 
medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1), since 
the clinical efficacy, safety and PK/PD of Lyumjev (LY900014) has been characterised in paediatric patients 
with T1D and in adults with T1D and T2D; including similar PK/PD after single dose via SC injection and via 
CSII  in  adult  and  paediatric  patients  with  T1D.  Consequently,  no  paediatric  efficacy  and  safety  trial  is 
deemed to be needed for approval of use of LY900014 in paediatric patients with T2D, in paediatric patients 
using CSII, or children aged 1 to <3 years. From a pharmacological point of view, similar efficacy and safety 
is expected also in patients below the age of 3 years. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Non-inferiority  of  LY900014  in  overall  glycaemic  control  (as  measured  by  HbA1c)  in  comparison  with 
Humalog was demonstrated in paediatric T1D subjects aged from 3 to <18 years. No data are available for 
patients <3 years of age. Efficacy and safety of LY900014 have been characterised for paediatric patients 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 132/134 
 
 
 
 
aged 6 years and older. For subjects below the age of 6 years, a 3−4-fold rate for documented, clinically 
relevant  hypoglycaemia  (<3.0  mmol/L,  54  mg/dL)  was  observed,  and  the  rate  remained  >2-fold  after 
adjusting for baseline hypoglycaemia and achieved HbA1c. However, the remaining difference is explained 
by two outliers with a very high rate of hypoglycaemia. It is however proposed that hypoglycaemias in the 
age group 1 to <6 years should be followed and reported in the PSURs. A programming error was identified 
by  the  MAH which  compromised  analyses  on  hypoglycaemic  events.  Updated  analyses  with  correct  data 
yielded only minor numerical differences compared to originally submitted results. None of the differences 
were of clinical relevance. 
Clinical efficacy and safety of Lyumjev (LY900014) has been characterized in paediatric patients with T1D 
and in adults with T1D and T2D, including similar PK/PD after single dose via SC injection and via CSII in 
adult and paediatric patients with T1D. Hence, additional data in paediatric patients with T2D are not needed 
as per Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products in the treatment or prevention of diabetes 
mellitus (CPMP/EWP/1080/00 Rev. 1). Consequently, no paediatric efficacy and safety trial is needed for 
approval of use of LY900014 in paediatric patients with T2D or in paediatric patients using CSII. Efficacy 
and safety data can also be extrapolated to children aged 1 to <3 years. 
As a conclusion, the B/R of Lyumjev in paediatric patients is positive. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
LY900014 is considered not similar (as defined in Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000) 
to Amglidia (glibenclamide).  
The MAH withdrew their request on one additional year of market protection in their response to the first 
RSI. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lyumjev is positive for children and adolescents aged 1 year and above. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Extension of indication to include the treatment of diabetes mellitus in adolescents and children aged 1 
year and above, based on final results from study I8B-MC-ITSB; this is a pivotal Phase 3 study designed 
to evaluate the safety and efficacy of Lyumjev compared to Humalog in combination with basal insulin in 
children and adolescent patients with T1D.  The study was designed to compare change in HbA1c as the 
primary endpoint. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report  
EMA/914290/2022 
Page 133/134 
 
 
 
 
Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to implement update 
minor editorial and linguistic changes in the SmPC and Package Leaflet. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annex(es) I and IIIB and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Lyumjev is not similar to Amglidia within the meaning of 
Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200.

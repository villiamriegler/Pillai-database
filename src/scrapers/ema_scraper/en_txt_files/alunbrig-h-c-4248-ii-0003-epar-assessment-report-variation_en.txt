2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The MAH applied for the following indication: 
 
 
 
 
Alunbrig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously untreated with an ALK 
inhibitor. 
Epidemiology 
Lung cancer is one of the most common cancers in the world and is the leading cause of cancer death 
worldwide. Globally, 2.1 million new lung cancer cases are estimated to have occurred in 2018, and lung 
cancer was responsible for 1.8 million deaths. In Europe, there were an estimated 470,000 cases of lung 
cancer diagnosed in 2018 across 40 countries, with 388,000 deaths1 [GLOBOCAN 2018]. 
NSCLC is the most prevalent histologic class of lung cancer, accounting for nearly 85% of all cases. 
Traditionally, NSCLC has been further divided into one of several histologic subtypes, including 
adenocarcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, large cell carcinoma, and bronchioloalveolar carcinoma2. 
Tumours that appear identical by histologic criteria are often driven by distinct oncogenes and, 
therefore, respond differently to therapeutic interventions because of their individual molecular 
profiles. 
Biologic features, aetiology and pathogenesis 
ALK is a tyrosine kinase encoded on chromosome 2 and is primarily involved in developmental processes 
and expressed at low levels in adults3. The first genetic rearrangement of ALK seen in NSCLC involved a 
fusion between the echinoderm microtubule-associated protein-like 4 (EML4) gene and the ALK tyrosine 
kinase domain. EML4-ALK has the capacity to transform fibroblasts grown in culture and as subcutaneous 
xenografts to induce tumour formation4. A number of additional ALK fusion partners have been described 
in  NSCLC  that  are  believed  to  result  in  aberrant  signalling  and  oncogenic  transformation 5   6 .  ALK 
rearrangements are more common among patients with adenocarcinoma histology, patients who have 
never smoked, and patients who have wild-type EGFR and v-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene 
homologue (KRAS)7. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Approximately, one-third of the patients with Stage IIIA disease are considered operable. However, 
the majority of patients with Stage IIIA/B have inoperable (unresectable) disease, and are amenable 
to receiving curative intention chemoradiation treatment. The biological characteristics of locally 
advanced, Stage III disease are poorly defined; the clinical characteristics associated with prognosis 
are nodal station involvement, size of primary tumour, baseline pulmonary function, gender, presence 
or absence of significant weight loss, and performance status (PS).

Pathological diagnosis based on tumour samples includes immunohistochemistry (IHC) to identify 
adenocarcinoma or squamous cell carcinoma and cytogenetic analysis by fluorescence in situ 
hybridisation (FISH) test to detect ALK rearrangements. Molecular testing should be carried out to 
determine genetic alterations, such as EGFR mutations and ALK rearrangements which determine 
choice of targeted treatment.  
Management 
Crizotinib 
In a randomized study of crizotinib against pemetrexed platinum doublet chemotherapy in patients with 
advanced, previously untreated ALK+ NSCLC, the median PFS was 10.9 months in  the  crizotinib arm 
and 7.0 months in the chemotherapy arm (HR = 0.45) [10,11]. 
For patients who respond, the median duration of response (DOR) of less than 1 year (~11 months in 
previously untreated ALK+ NSCLC  and ~7 months in patients previously treated with  chemotherapy) 
[see  Xalkori  EPAR].  Among  responders,  ALK-dependent  mechanisms  of  resistance  develop  in 
approximately 30%8 and include the acquisition of secondary point mutations in the kinase domain of 
ALK that interfere with crizotinib binding9 and/or amplification of the ALK fusion gene. 
The central nervous system (CNS) is the first site of progression in approximately 50% of patients10 11, 
suggesting inadequate penetration of crizotinib into the brain (i.e., pharmacologic failure) as the primary 
cause of resistance in these patients. 
Well-described safety and tolerability concerns associated with crizotinib include hepatotoxicity requiring 
monitoring;  severe,  life-threatening,  or  fatal  interstitial  lung  disease  (ILD);  QT  interval  prolongation; 
bradycardia; and severe visual impairment. Other common adverse events (AEs) include gastrointestinal 
(GI) toxicity and peripheral oedema. 
Recent First-Line Studies With Second- and Third-Generation ALK Inhibitors 
Building on the robust efficacy results observed in the post-crizotinib setting, alectinib and ceritinib have 
been  authorised  in  previously  untreated  ALK+  NSCLC  in  the  EU.  For  alectinib,  clinically  meaningful 
improvements  in  PFS  were  noted  in  the  first-line  setting  when  compared  with  crizotinib  in  the  ALEX 
study, with a median PFS (by IRC) of 25.7 months versus 10.4 months, respectively (HR = 0.50) [see 
Alecensa EPAR]. 
The first-line approval of ceritinib was based on findings from the phase 3 ASCEND-4 trial, which were 
observed relative to chemotherapy rather than crizotinib as active control. The median PFS was 16.6 
months with ceritinib versus 8.1 months with chemotherapy (HR = 0.55) [see Zykadia EPAR]. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Brigatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that targets ALK, c-ros oncogene 1 (ROS1), and insulin like 
growth factor 1 receptor (IGF 1R). Brigatinib inhibited autophosphorylation of ALK and ALK mediated 
phosphorylation of the downstream signalling protein STAT3 in in vitro and in vivo assays (SmPC,

section 5.1). Brigatinib inhibited the in vitro proliferation of cell lines expressing EML4 ALK and NPM 
ALK fusion proteins and demonstrated dose dependent inhibition of EML4 ALK positive NSCLC 
xenograft growth in mice. Brigatinib inhibited the in vitro and in vivo viability of cells expressing 
mutant forms of EML4-ALK associated with resistance to ALK inhibitors, including G1202R and L1196M 
(SmPC, section 5.1). 
In the clinical setting, brigatinib showed efficacy in patients with ALK+ NSCLC previously treated with 
crizotinib in Study 201. In this study, there was a median PFS greater than 15 months in patients 
receiving the recommended dose, as assessed by both investigator and IRC (15.6 and 16.7 months, 
respectively). Based primarily on the results from Study 201, approval was granted in the EU in 
November 2018 for use of brigatinib as monotherapy in adult patients with ALK+ advanced NSCLC 
previously treated with crizotinib. 
In the context of this procedure and based on the results from study AP26113-13-301 (referred to as 
Study 301), the CHMP recommends the following indication for approval:  
Alunbrig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously not treated with an ALK 
inhibitor. 
The recommended starting dose of Alunbrig is 90 mg once daily for the first 7 days, then 180 mg once 
daily. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated environmental risk assessment was not included within the Type II variation application  
for the following additional indication: 
“Alunbrig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously untreated with an ALK 
inhibitor.” 
The currently approved indication for Alunbrig is as follows: 
“Alunbrig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with crizotinib.” 
In the ERA submitted with the initial MAA, the maximum theoretical use of brigatinib was refined based 
on the epidemiologically substantiated prevalence of ALK+ NSCLC. This means that the prevalence 
figure used comprises all expected cases of ALK+ NSCLC, not only the ones previously treated with 
crizotinib. Hence, the ERA as it stands covers the potential environmental risks deriving from all 
applications for ALK+ NSCLC. Therefore, no new or updated environmental risk assessment is needed 
for the current indication extension. 
 
 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Methods 
Plasma concentrations of brigatinib were analysed using validated liquid chromatography tandem mass 
spectrometry  methods.  The  LC-MS/MS  methods  were  validated  for  the  analysis  of  AP26113  and  its 
metabolite, AP26123, in human K2EDTA plasma; therefore, AP26123 is included in the stocks, standards 
and  quality  control  samples.  As  analysis  for  the  metabolite  was  not  required  for  the  study  samples 
according to the protocol of Study 301, the data was only quantified for AP26113. 
The  population  PK  analysis  was  performed  using  the  NONMEM  (Version  7.3.0)  software  for  nonlinear 
mixed  effects  models.  Data  management,  exposure-response  analyses,  and  results  evaluations  were 
performed using R (version 3.3.1). 
Population PK analysis 
The primary objective of the Pop PK analysis was to  obtain post hoc exposure estimates for patients 
from Study 301 to facilitate ER analysis. The Pop PK model for brigatinib (a 3-compartment model with 
linear  kinetics  and  first-order  absorption  preceded  by  a  set  of  transit  compartments)  was  previously 
developed based on data from 442 subjects (105 healthy subjects and 337 cancer patients) from four 
phase 1 studies (AP26113-11-101, AP26113-13-102, AP26113-13-103 and AP26113-15-105) and one 
phase 2 study (Study 201).  
 
 
 
PK data for brigatinib in Study 301 were available for 121 of 137 enrolled patients (88%) in the brigatinib 
arm.  Brigatinib  concentrations  below  the  limit  of  quantification  (BLQ)  and  data  points  identified  as 
outliers (CWRES>5) were excluded from the analysis. 
A  Bayesian  re-estimation  approach,  leveraging  the  existing  Pop  PK  model  and  the  available  sparse 
brigatinib concentration data from Study 301, was applied to obtain individual exposure estimates. The 
Pop PK model parameter values (fixed effects and random effects variances) were fixed to final estimates 
from the previously developed model with only the individual random effects estimated based on the 
analysis dataset for Study 301. The final Pop PK model scheme and parameters are presented in Figure 
1 and Table 2, respectively. 
Figure 1: Structural PopPK model for brigatinib 
Inter individual variability was estimated on apparent clearance from the central compartment, apparent 
volume  of  distribution  in  the  central  and  the  first  peripheral  compartments,  the  number  of  transit 
compartments  and  mean  transit  time.  The  final  model  included  albumin  as  a  covariate  on  apparent 
clearance, with apparent clearance increasing with increasing albumin levels. 
 
 
 
Table 2: Final PopPK model parameters for Brigatinib 
Diagnostic  plots  showed  that  individual  predictions  were  consistent  with  the  observed  Study  301 
concentrations  and  the  CWRES  were  normally  distributed  and  showed  no  trend  when  related  to 
population prediction or time. PK parameter estimates were similar for Studies 301 and 201 (Table 3) 
and confirmed that the Bayesian re-estimation approach was an appropriate method to obtain individual 
PK parameters and post hoc exposure estimates for Study 301. 
Table 3: Summary statistics of post hoc parameter estimates from studies 301 and 201 
 
 
 
 
For Study 301, exposure estimates, expressed as AUC180, were derived for each patient based on the 
protocol defined brigatinib dose of 180 mg (Table 4). AUC180 excluded effects of noncompliance or dose 
interruption due to tolerability. 
Table 4: Summary statistics of post hoc steady state AUC 
In  patients  given  brigatinib  180  mg  once  daily,  the  geometric  mean  apparent  volume  of  distribution 
(Vz/F) of brigatinib at steady state was 307 L and the geometric mean apparent oral clearance (CL/F) at 
steady state was 8.9 L/h. 
Table 5: Summary of Brigatinib PK Parameters at Steady-State (C2D1) for Daily Dosing (Study 101) 
A prediction-corrected visual predictive checks (pcVPC) was performed where observations from Study 
301 were overlaid onto model predictions based on 1000 replicate simulations. The pcVPC showed good 
agreement with a slight under prediction for median concentrations.

To assess the relative effects of covariates on brigatinib exposure in Study 301, post hoc stratification 
of  calculated  steady-state  AUC  following  180  mg  doses  was  performed  for  covariates  of  interest  and 
depicted in a Forest plot (Figure 3). Compared to the overall variability in exposure, the magnitude of 
effects at the 95th percentile and 5th percentile for continuous covariates or between strata of categorical 
covariates was not clinically meaningful.

Exposure-Response analysis 
Only data from Study 301 were used in this evaluation. The primary objective of these ER analyses was 
to evaluate the relationship between brigatinib exposure and clinical efficacy endpoints, selected adverse 
events (AEs) of clinical interest, and the time to first dose reduction. The exposure-response analysis 
related reported efficacy outcomes to individual predicted exposures (and other covariates) based on 
logistic regression or time-to-event models. Only patients assigned to the brigatinib regimen with both 
PK and response information were included in the analysis. Of the 137 patients enrolled in the brigatinib 
arm, 16 patients were excluded due to the lack of exposure data, resulting in 121 patients with available 
post hoc exposure estimates. Exposure endpoints were merged with the efficacy and safety outcomes 
and with covariate data to construct the analysis dataset. 
 
 
 
Table 6: Overview of patients in the analysis populations 
For exposure-efficacy analysis, the following time-averaged AUCs were considered: 
1.  Time-averaged exposure between the last 2 disease assessment scans preceding PFS, iPFS, ORR  
or iORR or censoring and a dynamic time-averaged AUC between successive disease assessment 
scans preceding the event or censoring for PFS and iPFS.  
2.  Time-averaged AUC until progression 
3.  Time-averaged AUC to the best response  
4.  In case of no response, time-averaged AUC until censoring (end of treatment) 
5.  Daily AUC was based on the cumulative AUC to day i 
A Cox proportional hazard model was used to estimate the relationship between exposure and PFS/iPFS. 
First, a base model was developed to assess the relationship between brigatinib exposure and PFS. If 
exposure was found to be a significant predictor of PFS, a covariate model was developed. The exposure 
to  brigatinib  was  characterized  using  a  time-dependent  covariate  in  the  (i)PFS  model.  Kaplan-Meier 
curves were constructed to visually evaluate the association between quartiles/tertiles of the exposure 
distribution and PFS/iPFS outcomes. Logistic regression  models were used to explore the relationship 
between exposure and ORR/iORR. For ORR  and iORR,  each patient was classified as a responder (as 
defined by CR or PR) or a non-responder. If the ORR or iORR occurred more than once, the time to the 
first occurrence of the best response was used in the exposure-response analyses. A base model was 
developed to assess the relationship between exposure and the probability of the first confirmed best 
clinical  response.  If  brigatinib  exposure  was  not  identified  as  a  statistically  significant  predictor  of 
response (at p = 0.05), additional covariate analysis was not performed and the final model was identical 
to the base model. 
The developed exposure-response models were evaluated by graphically superposing model predictions 
on the observed data. Logistic regression models (clinical response, AE) were evaluated by plots showing 
the  model-predicted  response  compared  to  observations  stratified  by  (binned)  exposure  and  other 
covariates.  Time-to-event  models  (PFS,  time  to  first  dose  reduction)  were  evaluated  by  plotting  KM 
curves stratified by brigatinib exposure quartiles. 
Handling  of  missing  and  incomplete  observations:  If  the  time  of  sample  collection  or  response 
observation was missing, the data record was excluded from analysis. If dose times were missing, they 
were imputed carrying forward the last known dose time. Missed doses were not imputed.

TASCANIPROG for iPFS) 
Additional  exposure  metrics  including  dynamic  exposure  metrics  (i.e.,  the  dynamic  daily  AUC  and 
dynamic AUC between successive disease assessment scans) were evaluated and further supported the 
findings.  
Figure 4: Observed incidence and predicted probability of ORR (left) or iORR (right) as a function of 
brigatinib exposure (TASCANBR for ORR and TASCANIBR for iORR) using a logistic regression model 
Brigatinib exposure was not a predictor for the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) based on the 
results  from  the  logistic  regression  analysis.  The  results  of  the  logistic  regression  analysis  showed  a 
relationship between brigatinib exposure and iORR with higher exposure associated with higher incidence 
of intracranial response. Additional covariate analysis was performed only on the iORR logistic regression 
model and the covariates tested were not found to have a statistically significant impact on the iORR, 
while the exposure effect remained statistically significant. 
 
 
 
 
Table 8: Estimated odds ratio (95% CI) for the exposure-clinical response (ORR and iORR) analysis 
Exposure-response analyses were performed based on data from the second interim analysis of Study 
301 (data cutoff date of 28 June 2019). The results of these analyses are described in an updated 
population PK/exposure-response report.  
In the updated exposure-efficacy analyses, a statistically significant (p-value = 0.0486) relationship 
was identified between brigatinib exposure and iORR, with higher exposure associated with higher 
iORR (Figure 5). 
Figure 5: Observed incidence and predicted probability of iORR as a function of brigatinib exposure 
using a logistic regression model 
For exposure-safety analysis, the following exposure metrics were derived: 
1.  Time-averaged AUC [TAX] until an AE event or until first brigatinib dose reduction 
2.  In case of no event, TAX until end of treatment of censoring 
3.  Averaged daily AUC across Days 8 to 14, based on the daily AUC simulations 
 
 
 
 
Logistic  regression  models  were  used  to  explore  the  relationship  between  exposure  and  incidence  of 
Grade  ≥3  and  Grade  ≥2  events  of  interest.  If  the  AE,  occurred  more  than  once,  the  time  to  the  first 
occurrence of AE was used in the exposure-response analyses. 
Eleven safety endpoints were planned with five endpoints ≥ Grade 3 and six endpoints ≥ Grade 2. Given 
that three endpoints ≥ Grade 3 (ALT, AST and amylase elevations) had AE rates of less than 6%, ≥ Grade 
2 of those endpoints were added for the analysis. Any AE ≥ Grade 3 (CPK, AST, ALT, amylase, lipase 
elevations  as  well  as  hyperglycaemia,  hypertension,  bradycardia  and  rash)  was  also  added  to  the 
analysis.  
The probability of response (AEs) vs TAX was plotted, with probabilities calculated across sets of patients 
binned by exposure quartile. The relationship between time-averaged exposure and the probability of 
developing an AE was examined using the same logistic regression model and covariate analysis methods 
as for the exposure-clinical response analyses. Results of the comprehensive exposure-response analysis 
of 15 safety endpoints are presented in the following table:

2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Overall,  the  bioanalysis  of  samples  from  study  301  was  acceptable.  Methodologically,  the 
pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic modelling were considered acceptable. 
Individual parameter values for patients in Study 301 were estimated based on the previously developed 
population PK model (a 3-compartment model with linear kinetics and first-order absorption preceded 
by a set of transit compartments). Concentration data <LLOQ were not included. The model parameters 
were fixed while the random effects (Eta values) were estimated for each individual based on data from 
Study 301. The GoF plots were acceptable. The pcVPC after 1000 replicates showed the model  could 
capture the trend of data from study 301 with a slight underestimation and was regarded as an external 
validation of the final population PK model. The under prediction is minor and not considered critical for 
the subsequent E-R analyses. 
Comparison of PK parameters derived for Study 201 and 301 showed good agreement.  
Individual patient dosing histories contributed to estimation of individual PK parameters e.g. apparent 
CL, therefore AUCss could be derived without any additional consideration of non-compliance or dose 
interruption. No formal covariate analysis was performed. The impact of each covariate on the steady 
state AUC of brigatinib after 180 mg QD dosing was evaluated and the effect compared to the variability 
of the study population. No clinically relevant effects of covariates: age, body weight, sex, race, liver 
function and renal function on brigatinib exposure was observed.  The inter individual variability was also 
rather high for the parameter estimates in the final model with high shrinkage on MTT and NTR. The 
variability in predicted exposure for study 301, AUC180 was large (CV% 53.4), but within the variability 
observed for AUC at steady-state following 180 mg QD dosing in patients (PK Study 101, AUC C2D1, 
CV% 61.6). 
 
 
 
No  clear  trend  in  the  relationship  between  exposure  to  brigatinib  and  progression  of  disease  was 
observed. There was no significant relationship identified between brigatinib exposure and PFS, iPFS or 
ORR. Therefore, the effect of covariates on (i)PFS and ORR were not evaluated. However, a statistically 
significant  relationship  (p=0.0305)  was  identified  between  brigatinib  exposure  and  iORR,  with  higher 
exposure associated with a higher iORR.  
The  MAH  performed  an  additional  logistic  regression  model  with  covariates  for  iORR  but  no  other 
covariates  were  found  to  be  statistically  significant.    The  MAH  submitted  an  update  of  Pop  PK  and 
exposure-response  analysis  showing  a  statistically  significant  relation  (p=0.0486)  between  iORR  and 
exposure expressed as time-averaged AUC.  
Despite the low number of events for most of the individual endpoints, the comprehensive exposure-
response analysis of 15 safety endpoints provided a robust assessment of exposure effects on selected 
safety endpoints and showed a consistent absence of discernible exposure effects. 
The recommended dose of brigatinib for the treatment of ALK+ NSCLC in the post-crizotinib setting is 
90 mg QD for 7 days followed by 180 mg QD based on the favourable benefit-risk profile established in 
Study 201. The results of the Pop PK analysis of Study 301 in the frontline treatment setting in patients 
not  previously  treated  with  an  ALK  inhibitor  support  consistency  in  systemic  exposures  with  those 
observed  previously  in  the  Study  201  patient  population.  No  new  or  clinically  relevant  sources  of 
variability were observed upon inspection of the distributions of brigatinib systemic exposure in the Study 
301 patient population stratified by key covariates. As such, from a PK perspective, these results support 
the  use  of  the  same  dose  of  brigatinib  in  the  frontline  patient  population  as  in  the  post-crizotinib 
treatment setting. 
With the exception of an ER relationship for intracranial response rate (iORR) further supporting selection 
of  the  180  mg  dose  (preceded  by  dosing  at  90  mg  for  1  week),  the  exposure-efficacy  analyses  for 
PFS/iPFS and ORR did not identify any discernible relationships, indicating consistent treatment benefit 
of brigatinib over the range of exposures achieved at the dose and regimen used in Study 301 (see also 
Clinical efficacy). The incidences of most AEs of clinical interest (Grade ≥2 or Grade ≥3) were relatively 
low and no relationships to systemic exposures of brigatinib could be discerned in the exposure-safety 
analyses. (see also Clinical safety section)  
As the proposed dose and regimen for frontline treatment is identical to that in the post-crizotinib setting 
and  no  readily  apparent  differences  in  PK  are  observed  between  these  populations  based  on  PopPK 
analysis, the MAH proposed that dosing and administration guidelines across specific clinical contexts of 
use (e.g., in patients with renal or hepatic impairment, or during coadministration with interacting drugs) 
for the current proposed indication are identical to those applicable in these respective clinical contexts 
of use in the post-crizotinib setting. 
2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Exposure-response analyses of efficacy and safety in the Study 301 population supported the proposed 
dosing regimen.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint 
The primary endpoint for this study is PFS, as assessed by the BIRC, per Response Evaluation Criteria 
in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. A PFS event in the primary analysis is defined as death, BIRC-determined 
RECIST progression or receiving radiotherapy for CNS metastases. Radiological scans for the assessment 
of  disease  progression  and  tumor  response  were  scheduled  to  be  performed  every  8  weeks,  and 
unscheduled scans could be performed at other times. 
Secondary Endpoints 
1. Confirmed ORR, as assessed by the BIRC, per RECIST v1.1 
2. Confirmed intracranial ORR, as assessed by the BIRC 
3. Intracranial PFS, as assessed by the BIRC 
4. OS 
The first four endpoints above will be evaluated in a closed testing procedure. 
5. Duration of response, as assessed by the BIRC 
6. Time to response, as assessed by the BIRC 
7. Disease control rate, as assessed by the BIRC 
8. Safety and tolerability 
9. Change from baseline scores in global health status/quality of life (QOL) assessed with the EORTC 
QLQ-C30 (v3.0), and time-to-deterioration in dyspnea assessed with the EORTC QLQ-LC13 (v3.0) 
Exploratory Endpoints 
1. Confirmed ORR for brigatinib, as assessed by the BIRC, per RECIST v1.1, in patients who crossover 
from Arm B (crizotinib) 
2.  PFS  from  the  first  dose  of  brigatinib,  as  assessed  by  the  BIRC,  per  RECIST  v1.1,  in  patients  who 
crossover from Arm B (crizotinib) 
 
 
3. Correlation of brigatinib plasma pharmacokinetics with both efficacy and safety 
4. Molecular determinants of efficacy and safety with brigatinib and crizotinib 
Sample size 
For the purposes of this sample size calculation, the median PFS for crizotinib is estimated as 10 months. 
A total of 198 events (progression or death among the randomized subjects) will provide 90% power to 
detect a clinically meaningful 6-month improvement in PFS (hazard ratio=0.625). This power projection 
is  based  on  a  2-sided  log-rank  test,  and  is  controlled  at  the  2-sided  0.043  level,  adjusting  for  the 
proposed interim analysis plan. Approximately 270 subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 fashion to receive 
brigatinib or crizotinib. 
The number of events is fixed, but the enrolment number may change based on an assessment of the 
overall event rate pooled across treatment groups (prior to the close of enrolment). 
Randomisation 
Patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either brigatinib 90 mg once daily (QD) orally for 7 
days followed by 180 mg QD orally continuously (Arm A) or crizotinib 250 mg twice daily (BID) orally 
(Arm B). Patients will be stratified by the following two factors, each having two levels: 
1. Intracranial CNS (iCNS) metastases at baseline (Yes versus No) 
2. Prior chemotherapy use for locally advanced or metastatic disease (Yes versus No). For the purposes 
of  stratification,  prior  chemotherapy  is  defined  as  completion  of  ≥1  full  cycle  of  chemotherapy  in  the 
locally advanced or metastatic setting. 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was unblinded to patients, investigators and the sponsor.   
Images from all scans performed from screening through the end of study participation were transferred 
to the BIRC and evaluated per RECIST v1.1.; validity of the findings of the BIRC was enhanced by using 
two  primary  readers  supported  by  an  adjudicator.  All  members  of  the  BIRC  were  blinded  to  study 
treatment and any other information collected on subjects following randomization other than the scans 
themselves. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Populations 
Intent–to-Treat (ITT) Population: The ITT population includes all subjects randomized to either regimen. 
The primary analyses of efficacy will be based on the ITT population. 
Treated Population: The treated population for each regimen includes all subjects receiving at least one 
dose of study drug. Safety will be analysed using the treated population. 
Per-protocol  Population:  The  per-protocol  population  will  be  used  for  sensitivity  analyses  in  order  to 
characterize the effects of the two treatment regimens when used as  intended according to the study 
protocol.  Considerations  for  inclusion  include  consistency  with  the  intended  treatment  population, 
 
 
adequate exposure to randomized treatment regimen, and sufficient post-exposure disease assessment 
to determine presence or absence of progressive disease. 
FDA-Approved ALK Test Population: A sensitivity analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed in 
the “FDA approved ALK test population”. This population will consist of all subjects in the ITT population 
who also meet one of the two following criteria: 1) Were determined to be ALK+ by one of the tests 
identified in Inclusion Criteria; 2) Provided adequate tissue for central testing and were determined to 
be ALK+ at the central laboratory by the FDA-approved test. 
PFS 
The primary analysis of the primary endpoint will be performed using a 2-sided stratified logrank test 
(stratification factors: presence of CNS metastases at baseline [Yes versus No], and prior chemotherapy 
for  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  disease  [Yes  versus  No])  to  compare  the  BIRC-assessed  PFS  of 
subjects randomized to brigatinib with the BIRC-assessed PFS of subjects randomized to crizotinib. The 
overall (2-sided) Type I error rate will be controlled at 0.05. The primary analysis will be based on the 
ITT population. Median PFS and 95% confidence intervals will be estimated for each treatment arm using 
the Kaplan-Meier method. Additionally, hazard ratios will be estimated using the Cox regression model 
with the stratification factors as covariates. The analysis will use the current values of the stratification 
factors.

Sensitivity analyses 
Sensitivity Analysis 1– Censor at date of last treatment administration if PFS event not observed prior 
to the End of Treatment Visit. Other censoring rules from the primary analysis of PFS remain in effect. 
Sensitivity Analysis 2 – Do not censor PFS events for reasons of time lapse from last assessment (i.e., 
no 126-day rule) or usage of disallowed therapies. 
Each sensitivity analysis is targeted at specific changes to the rules for the primary analysis, and any 
rules not specified in the sensitivity analysis will remain as specified in the primary analysis. 
Confirmed ORR, as assessed by the BIRC, per RECIST v1.1  
ORR will be calculated using the following formula: ORR per BIRC = (#confirmed BIRC-based CR or PR) 
/ (#Randomized subjects)*100%. 
Sensitivity analyses of this endpoint using different analysis populations will be calculated in the same 
manner  after  first  restricting  subjects  included  in  the  denominator  and  eligible  for  inclusion  in  the 
numerator to those in the analysis population of interest. 
Confirmed ORR will be analyzed with the Mantel-Haenszel test (using the stratification factors) on the 
ITT  population  to  compare  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  objective  response  between  the  2 
treatment arms. The exact 2-sided 95% binomial confidence intervals will be calculated. 
Any  subjects  who  are  identified  as  having  only  non-measurable  disease  at  baseline  by  one  of  these 
assessment  mechanisms  (BIRC  or  investigator  assessment)  will  not  be  eligible  to  be  counted  as 
responders (i.e. overall response of PR or CR) in analyses of results assessed by that mechanism, unless 
their overall response is CR. 
Sensitivity analyses to be performed on this endpoint will be: 
1) ORR defined as all confirmed and unconfirmed responses as determined by BIRC 
2) Confirmed ORR as determined by the investigator 
3) ORR defined as all confirmed and unconfirmed responses as determined by the investigator 
Confirmed intracranial ORR, as assessed by the BIRC 
iCNS ORR will be calculated in the same manner as for RECIST v1.1 BIRC using confirmed time point 
responses  from  the  iCNS  BIRC.  Confirmed  iCNS  ORR  will  be  analyzed  for  the  following  subsets  of 
subjects: 
1) The measurable iCNS disease population 
2) The non-measurable iCNS disease population 
3) The all iCNS disease population 
Each of these analyses will be accompanied by a sensitivity analysis restricted to the subset of subjects 
with active lesions at baseline. Responses of iCNS CR in subjects with non-measurable iCNS disease at 
baseline will be counted as time point responses in analyses of iCNS ORR. Analysis will differ in that the 
iCNS  ORR  will  be  analyzed  with  the  Mantel-Haenszel  test  using  only  the  stratification  factor  of  prior 
chemotherapy. A sensitivity analysis of confirmed + unconfirmed iCNS ORR will be performed. 
 
 
 
 
 
Intracranial PFS, as assessed by the BIRC 
Intracranial PFS will be defined and analyzed in the same manner as for PFS used in the primary endpoint 
with the exceptions that the progression events used will come from the iCNS BIRC and the analysis will 
be restricted to subjects identified as having brain metastases at baseline in the randomization. 
The primary evaluation of iCNS PFS will be performed in the all iCNS disease population, with a sensitivity 
analysis  in  the  active  iCNS  disease  population.  Additional  analyses  will  be  performed  in  the  no  iCNS 
disease  population,  in  which  case  PFS  events  would  consist  of  either  the  appearance  of  new  brain 
metastases or death. iCNS PFS will also be analyzed in the measurable iCNS disease population with a 
sensitivity analysis in the active measurable iCNS disease population. 
Conduct and analysis of iCNS response and progression will occur independently of systemic assessment 
of disease. If a subject progresses due to lesions outside the iCNS and continues on their randomized 
study treatment, the subject will continue to be evaluated as SD, PR, or CR in the iCNS until disease 
progression in the iCNS or the subject discontinues randomized study treatment. Confirmation of CR or 
PR should be performed 4 weeks (allowing a minus 3-day window) or more after initial response. 
OS 
OS is defined as the time interval from the date of randomization until death due to any cause in the ITT 
population. OS will be censored on the date of last contact for subjects who are still alive. In the primary 
analysis  of  OS  follow-up  time  will  not  be  censored  for  initiation  of  non-study  anticancer  therapies, 
including crossover from crizotinib to brigatinib. 
The  primary  analysis  of  OS  will  be  conducted  using  the  same  statistical  methods  as  for  the  primary 
endpoint.  Follow-up  time  in  the  primary  analysis  of  OS  will  not  be  censored  for  any  other  reason. 
Sensitivity analyses using additional censoring rules such as initiation of disallowed anticancer therapies 
may be performed. For subjects who have been randomized and are not treated, the OS will be defined 
as the time interval from randomization date to death date or date of the last contact, if available. 
Overall type I error rate for secondary endpoints 
The overall type I error rate was set at 0.05. Analysis of a key secondary endpoint will be considered 
significant if the test for that endpoint and comparisons of all other secondary endpoints with a smaller 
rank are significant at the two-sided 0.05 significance level. Rank-ordering of key secondary endpoints: 
1. Confirmed ORR, as assessed by the BIRC, per RECIST v1.1 
2. Confirmed intracranial ORR, as assessed by the BIRC 
3. Intracranial PFS, as assessed by the BIRC 
4. OS 
The  primary  assessment  of  the  first  three  endpoints  above  will  be  performed  at  the  time  when  the 
assessment of the primary endpoint is completed, either when the efficacy boundary is surpassed on 
one of the interim analyses or at the time the final analysis is done. 
The primary assessment of OS will be performed when 198 PFS events to perform the final analysis of 
the primary endpoint have been observed, or at final database lock if the study is terminated prior to 
this occurs prior to the observation of 198 PFS events. 
Interim analysis 
 
 
Two  interim  analyses  are  planned  after  approximately  50%  and  75%  of  the  total  expected  events 
(progression  or  death) have  been observed.  An  O’Brien-Fleming  Lan-DeMets alpha  spending  function 
will be used to control the overall alpha level at 0.05 2-sided. 
Amendments to the statistical analysis plan  
Version 3 update was made on March 27, 2018, in which substantive changes were made: 
• 
formal  statistical  inference  will  be  completed  at  the first  successful  evaluation  of  the  primary 
endpoint. 
•  Analysis of ORR using BIRC or investigator assessments will treat all subjects assessed as having 
non-measurable disease at baseline as non-responders. 
• 
The definition of DCR was modified to state that single responses of CR and non-CR/non-PD in 
subjects with non-measurable disease at baseline will be eligible to contribute to disease control. 
• 
The definition of the Measurable iCNS disease population was changed from being a subset of 
the ITT population to being a subset of the all iCNS disease population 
•  Censoring for anticancer therapies recorded during safety follow up will occur as of the date of 
contact at which the first occurrence of therapy is noted 
• 
The  definition  of  time  to  response  analyses  was  simplified  to  the  presentation  of  summary 
statistics restricted to responders. Time to event models and figures were eliminated. 
Version 4 update was made to this plan on August 19, 2019, which included the following: 
•  Based on Intent-to-Treat Principle, subjects who were randomized but did not 
take any study treatment should be analyzed the same way as any other 
randomized subjects. Therefore, censoring rule for PFS and DOR were modified 
as below: 
The following sentence was removed:  
“Randomized subjects who did not receive any of their assigned study drug will 
be censored at follow-up Day1.” 
The corresponding censoring rule was removed. As a result of this change, 
subjects who were randomized but untreated will be analyzed based on the 
remaining progression and censoring. This change applies to the analysis of 
Duration of Response (DOR), intracranial Progression-free Survival (iPFS), and 
intracranial Duration of Response (iDOR) as well. 
•  Based on RECIST criteria v1.1, subjects who only had non-measurable disease 
at baseline should be counted as a responder if they had an overall response of 
CR: 
“Any subjects who are identified as having only non-measurable disease at baseline by one 
of these assessment mechanisms (BIRC or investigator assessment) will not be eligible to be 
counted as responders (i.e. overall response of PR or CR) in analysis of results assessed by 
that mechanism, unless explicitly stated is exploratory analysis” 
was changed to  
 “Any subjects who are identified as having only non-measurable disease at 
baseline by one of these assessment mechanisms (BIRC or investigator 
assessment) will not be eligible to be counted as responders (i.e. overall 
response of PR or CR) in analyses of results assessed by that mechanism, 
unless their overall response is CR.” 
 
 
 
 
Results 
Participant flow 
Source: Study 301 Table 15.1.3 (data cutoff: 19 February 2018). 
Abbreviations: AE, adverse event; ITT, intent-to-treat; RECIST, Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors. 
In this study, a total of 311 patients were screened, which led to the inclusion of 275 patients in the 
ITT population. 
Recruitment 
The ALTA 1L study was fully recruited in 14 months and last patient first dose was in August 2017, 
hence, the median follow-up was initially less than a year. However, the MAH have provided updated 
data with 24.9 months of follow-up and data cut-off 28 June 2019. 
Patients were randomized at 92 study sites in the following regions:  
•  143  patients  at  55  sites  in  Europe  (Austria,  Denmark,  France,  Germany,  Italy,  Luxembourg, 
Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and the United Kingdom);  
•  107 patients at 24 sites in the Asia Pacific region (Australia, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and 
South Korea), and  
•  25 patients at 13 sites in North America (US and Canada). 
 
 
 
 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The original protocol (dated 22 October 2015) was amended once, i.e. Protocol Amendment 1 (Dated 21 
September 2016). 
The following key changes were made in Protocol Amendment 1: 
• 
The  EORTC  QLQ-LC13  was  added  as  a  QoL  assessment.  Additionally,  clarification  was  made 
about signs and symptoms of the QoL assessments and when they will be considered AEs. 
• 
The  required  duration  for  contraceptive  use  after  the  end  of  treatment  with  crizotinib  was 
amended to be both during the dosing period and for a period of at least 4 months after the end 
of treatment with brigatinib, and at least 3 months after the end of treatment with crizotinib. 
This was changed to be consistent with the crizotinib SmPC. 
• 
The definition of highly effective contraception to be used during and after the study was added. 
•  Wording was amended regarding possible additional drug-drug interactions with crizotinib and 
the  possibility  that  the  effectiveness  of  oral  contraceptives  may  be  reduced  while  taking 
crizotinib. 
• 
Investigator guidance for monitoring signs of vision dysfunction and worsening vision disorders 
was  modified  to  include  brigatinib  in  the  guidance  for  crizotinib,  to  be  consistent  with  the 
crizotinib  SmPC,  and  to  specify  that  for  new  or  worsening  severe  vision  disorders, 
ophthalmological evaluation consisting of best corrected visual acuity, retinal photographs, visual 
fields, optical coherence tomography, and other evaluations should be performed. 
• 
Text  regarding  management  of  additional  selected  treatment-related  AEs  was  modified  to 
provide guidance on the management of visual disturbance during treatment with brigatinib. 
•  A clarification was made that patients will continue to receive study drug until discontinuation, 
as opposed to  being transitioned to  commercially available  brigatinib as stated in the original 
protocol. 
• 
The timing of the following study procedures was clarified: 
– Imaging by CT or MRI should continue until the end of treatment, rather than PD, as some 
patients may remain on treatment after PD. 
–  Additional  pregnancy  testing  should  be  performed  if  recommended  or  required  per  local 
guidelines or regulations. 
•  Modified inclusion criterion 1 to clarify that eligible patients included those with locally advanced 
or recurrent Stage IIIB NSCLC; locally advanced or recurrent status was added. 
•  Modified inclusion criterion 5 to specify that Grade >1 alopecia or peripheral neuropathy related 
to prior anticancer therapy are allowed if deemed irreversible. 
•  Clarified  that  baseline  laboratory  tests  that  need  to  be  repeated  on  Cycle  1  Day  1  (because 
screening laboratory tests were performed >7  days before the first dose)  should be obtained 
before starting treatment. 
•  Clarified the following administrative information and processes: 
– The process for investigator reporting of SAEs, specifying that the investigator or investigator’s 
designee is required to record all SAE information in the clinical trial database within 24 hours 
 
 
after  becoming  aware  of  an  SAE,  or  fax  the  SAE  report to the  sponsor if  the  database is  not 
available. 
– The process regarding review and approval of protocol amendments, so that any significant 
change in the study protocol requires an amendment to be submitted to competent authorities 
and IRB/IEC for review and approval per applicable guidance and regulations. 
– Amended the sponsor contact and signatory information. 
•  An update was made to Appendix E (Drugs With a Risk of Torsades de Pointes) to be based on 
a more recent list provided by CredibleMeds (dated 10 August 2016). 
Additionally,  administrative  changes  were  made  to  correct  typographical  and  grammatical  errors  and 
inconsistencies throughout the protocol. 
Other Changes and Clarifications 
The SAP indicates that the primary assessment of OS will be performed when 198 BIRC assessed PFS 
events are observed, or at final database lock if the study is terminated before the observation of 198 
PFS events. However, the primary assessment of OS is planned at approximately 3 years after the last 
patient  is  enrolled,  when  it  is  anticipated  that  approximately  150  OS  events  would  be  observed. 
Sensitivity analyses of OS will also be performed at this time.

Numbers analysed 
The ITT Population included all randomized patients, regardless of whether they received study drug or 
adhered to their assigned dose. In total, there were 275 patients in the ITT Population, with 137 in the 
brigatinib arm and 138 in the crizotinib arm. The ITT Population includes 2 patients (1 in each arm) who 
were never treated. Both withdrew consent after randomization before first dose.

Ancillary analyses 
PFS by BIRC 
Additional sensitivity analyses: 
Because of data errors identified and corrected during preparation for IA2 that affected data relevant to 
IA1, the MAH decided in August 2019 to perform an IA1 sensitivity analysis, which was conducted with 
corrected data using the original IA1 data cut-off date 19 February 2018. The decision to conduct this 
sensitivity analysis was made to ascertain the precise nature and impact of these data corrections. This 
was especially important given that IA1 data were used to declare statistical significance of the Study 
301 results.  
The documentation errors identified during the additional data review are summarized below: 
–  Seven  tumour-related  intervention  procedures  had  been  entered  incorrectly  in  the  clinical 
database. Concern was raised that these data errors could potentially affect censoring of PFS events 
and the results of the PFS analysis. After carefully evaluating the data corrections and confirming 
that these corrections were incorporated in IA2, it became clear that for these patients, PFS events 
and censoring by the IA1 data cut-off date (19 Feb 2018) were affected, and the PFS HR for the ITT 
population at IA1 could change as well.  
– A single death event was identified in August 2019 that had been captured only in a free-text data 
field in the clinical database. It was therefore not able to be captured in the analysis, which could 
potentially affect the number of PFS events and would definitely affect the OS events for IA1. 
– Twenty-one baseline scans were identified that had no BIRC assessment performed; thus, these 
patients were treated as not having brain metastasis at baseline in the original IA1 database. This 
issue  was  caused  by  the  BIRC  Charter  requirement  that  baseline  scans  be  sent  to  the  BIRC  for 
review together with the first postbaseline assessment. However, as these patients had discontinued 
from the study without having any follow-up scans, these baseline scans had not been submitted 
for  BIRC  assessment  for  the  original  IA1  analysis.  These  issues  were  not  expected  to  affect  the 
primary  endpoint  analysis  but  could  affect  key  secondary  endpoints  of  intracranial  PFS  and 
intracranial ORR. 
The IA1 sensitivity analysis results are presented in the table below: 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 35: Summary of sensitivity analysis for key efficacy endpoints (original IA1 vs IA1 sensitivity 
analysis) 
A total of 7 patients had their PFS event/censoring status and/or event/censoring date updated after the 
original IA1 analysis, including 4 patients in the crizotinib arm whose PFS event/censoring status changed 
and  3  patients  in  brigatinib  arm  whose  PFS  event/censoring  status  remained  the  same  but  their 
event/censoring date changed. The total number of patients with PFS events by BIRC did not change in 
either arm and remained at 99 events for the IA1 sensitivity analysis. 
Overall, the confirmed ORR by BIRC was updated from 70.8% versus 60.1% to 71.5% versus 60.9% for 
the brigatinib arm and the crizotinib arm, respectively. Only 2 patients had their best confirmed response 
changed from the original IA1 to the updated IA1 analysis: 1 patient in each treatment arm.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In order to support this extension of indication for brigatinib in patients with ALK+ NSCLC previously 
not treated with an ALK inhibitor, the MAH submitted the results from the multicenter, randomised 
phase 3 ALTA 1L trial, comparing brigatinib with crizotinib in the TKI-naïve setting. 275 patients were 
randomised 1:1 in 92 investigational sites across the world, mainly in the EU (55 sites) and the Asia-
Pacific (24 sites). The study was fully recruited by 14 months. Updated efficacy data are presented 
with longer follow-up (24.8 months for the brigatinib arm) and from the data cut-off of 28 June 2019. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design of the pivotal ALTA 1L is acceptable. The randomisation, sample size and statistical 
methods used are generally endorsed. Additional sensitivity analyses and clarifications were requested 
and were in line with the primary analysis.  
The comparator of crizotinib, which is a first-generation ALK-TKI, is now an inferior treatment 
considering the current treatment landscape with several second-generation ALK-TKIs, of which some 
are approved for first-line treatment (alectinib and ceritinib). However, it is acknowledged that 
crizotinib was the standard of care in the first-line setting, when the pivotal 301 study was planned 
and initiated. The pivotal 301 study was also the confirmatory study for the initially planned CMA for 
Alunbrig in the second-line setting. Hence, the comparator of crizotinib has already been accepted in 
the procedure for the initial MAA, despite the fact that Alunbrig was given a full approval. Crizotinib 
was also accepted as comparator in the approval for first-line treatment with alectinib. In that context, 
crizotinib as comparator in the pivotal 301 study is considered acceptable. 
The primary objective of the pivotal trial is efficacy measured using PFS by BIRC as primary endpoint 
and the key secondary endpoints tested hierarchically are confirmed ORR, intracranial ORR, 
intracranial PFS, and OS. As the study was not blinded, it is endorsed that the blinded independent 
review of PFS is the primary endpoint to minimise bias from the investigators, who know the allocated 
treatment. The key secondary endpoints are also endorsed, as response to treatment both systemically 
and intracranially are clinically relevant endpoints due to the high risk of brain metastases with ALK+ 
NSCLC. Due to database entry errors discovered when the second IA was prepared, an extra sensitivity 
analyses of the first IA was done and was in line with the primary analysis. Moreover, these errors 
were not deemed to have had relevant clinical impact on the study results. 
The majority of included patients were white (58.9%) or Asian (39.3), which is reflective of the sites of 
the study and is acceptable. The median age was 59 years (range 27-89), slightly more women were 
included and most were non-smokers (57.8%), which is reflective of the patient population. It is 
considered possible to extrapolate efficacy in the Asian population to the European mainly white 
population, as brigatinib is a specific targeted treatment for ALK+ NSCLC. Only 4.4% of the patients 
had PS 2, while the remaining patients had PS 0-1, which is reflective of a study population but not the 
general patient population. This is acceptable for the clinical study setting and these patients were 
evenly distributed between the treatment arms, minimising the bias of poor performance status. The 
organ involvement including the CNS is considered reflective of the patient population. Overall, the 
baseline characteristics are reflective of the targeted disease and patient population and there are no 
major clinically important imbalances between the treatment arms. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The primary efficacy analysis, PFS by BIRC, is from the primary analysis and the primary endpoint was 
met.  Updated  data  from  the  second  IA  show  that  the  median  PFS  by  BIRC  was  improved  from  11.0 
months to 24.0 months (95%CI: 18.5, NE) with a HR of 0.489 and based on 46% events with brigatinib 
vs 63% events with crizotinib. The 13 months improvement is statistically significant and highly clinically 
meaningful for the targeted patient population. 
The key secondary endpoint of confirmed ORR was improved by approximately 10%, which is considered 
clinically relevant, because it translates into better disease control and symptom relief. It is noted that 
more patients had a confirmed complete response (CR) with brigatinib vs crizotinib (14.6% vs 8.7%). 
In addition, more patients had an overall response to brigatinib 73.7% (95%CI: 65.52; 80.87) compared 
to crizotinib 61.6% (95%CI: 52.94; 69.74), while similar disease control rates were observed in both 
 
 
arms  (~83%).  Updated  data  now  show  that  the  difference  in  ORR  by  BIRC  and  INV  is  considered 
supportive of the primary objective.  
Updated  confirmed  Intracranial  ORR  for  patients  with  any  brain  metastases  at  baseline  (n=90)  is 
markedly improved with brigatinib i.e. 66%  (95%CI:  50.69; 79.14) vs 16.3% (95%CI: 7.32; 29.66) 
with  crizotinib,  which  is  also  supported  by  intracranial  PFS  in  patients  with  any  brain  metastases  at 
baseline with a median iPFS of 24 months with brigatinib vs 5.6 months with crizotinib. Regardless of 
the presence of brain metastases at baseline, the updated PFS was ~24 months with brigatinib versus 
a PFS of ~13 months on crizotinib if there were no brain metastases at baseline and as mentioned, only 
5.6 months with brain metastases at baseline. Hence, these data show a superior  iPFS with brigatinib 
regardless of the presence  of  brain metastases  at baseline, indicating that brigatinib can prevent the 
occurrence of de novo brain metastases, as the brain is often the site of progression.  
Overall,  70  deaths  have  been  reported  by  the  time  of  the  latest  data  cut-off,  and  consequently  the 
median OS has still not been reached in either arm. The event rate is 24.1% in the brigatinib arm and 
26.8%  in  the  crizotinib  arm,  which  is  reflective  of  the  multiple  treatment  options  beyond  first-line 
treatment. Although OS data are still immature, there are no sign of a detrimental effect of brigatinib 
treatment and it is considered encouraging that the OS events are occurring slower than anticipated. 
Hence, it is acceptable that the final OS and PFS analyses are provided by 30 June 2021.   
Time to response were similar between the arms and the median was approximately 1.8 months, which 
is consistent with previous data on brigatinib and other ALK-TKI’s. The median DOR by BIRC was not 
reached for brigatinib (95%CI: 19.38, NE) and 13.8 months (95%CI: 9.30; 20.8) for crizotinib. The DOR 
by  INV  was  similar  and  considered  supportive  of  the  BIRC  assessed  data.  The  prolonged  DOR  with 
brigatinib is considered clinically relevant, and the updated data is considered mature.  
PRO data have been presented and results indicate no detrimental effect of brigatinib. However, these 
data should be interpreted with caution as there was no blinding of the study treatment and bias cannot 
be ruled out. Moreover, the type I error was neither controlled for the multiple secondary endpoints (of 
which PRO is number 9) nor the multiple symptoms being assessed with the PRO tools.  
Updated subgroup analyses of BIRC-Assessed PFS by prior chemotherapy are in favour of treatment with 
brigatinib and the results are  consistent with those in the ITT population. Hence, one treatment  with 
chemotherapy, as allowed in the inclusion criteria, is acceptable for the applied indication of brigatinib. 
Overall, the subgroup analyses favour brigatinib, especially if brain metastases were present at baseline, 
which is considered supported of improved intracranial efficacy results. The Competing Risks Analysis 
shows evidence of more CNS progressions with crizotinib than with brigatinib (26.1% vs 16.1% events), 
also  supportive  of  improved  intracranial  efficacy  with  brigatinib.  There  were  no  detrimental  effects 
observed regarding advanced age (≥ 65 years), gender, race, smoking status, or ECOG performance 
status. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy results from the pivotal study ALTA 1L show superior efficacy of brigatinib versus crizotinib 
both systemically and intracranially for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
ALK+ NSCLC, who had not received prior treatment with an ALK-inhibitor. 
 
 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The  evaluation  of  safety  was  initially  based  on  data  from  phase  3  Study  301  (data  cut-off  date: 
19 February 2018), which comprises 273 patients who received ≥1 dose of study drug: 136 brigatinib 
and 137 crizotinib. Updated safety data from the 301 study have now been provided using the data cut-
off 28 June 2019. In addition, safety data is reported from the phase 2 study 201 in patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic ALK+ NSCLC, who had progressed on crizotinib (222 patients were randomized, 
and 219 patients received ≥1 dose of brigatinib of which 110 patients received the recommended dose 
of brigatinib i.e. 90 mg QD→180 mg QD (data cut-off: 29 September 2017).

Adverse drug reactions 
The list and frequency of adverse drug reactions have been reviewed in the context of this application 
on the basis of the pooled safety data of patients treated at the 180 mg regimen from three clinical 
trials: a Phase 3 trial (study 301) in patients with advanced ALK positive NSCLC previously not treated 
with an ALK inhibitor (N = 136), a Phase 2 trial (study 201) in patients treated with Alunbrig with ALK 
positive NSCLC who previously progressed on crizotinib (N = 110), and a phase 1/2 dose 
escalation/expansion trial (study 101) in patients with advanced malignancies (N = 28).

Adverse events of special interest 
Pulmonary AEs: EOPEs and Later-onset pneumonitis events 
EOPEs occurred in 4 of the 136 patients (2.9%) in the brigatinib arm and no patients in the crizotinib 
arm. All EOPEs were reported as ILD or pneumonitis, and all occurred while the patient was taking 
90 mg QD brigatinib (i.e., prior to escalation to 180 mg QD), with a range of onset of Day 3 to 8. The 
incidence of EOPEs in Study 301 was lower than the incidence reported in Study 201 (2.9% vs 6.4%).  
The overall rate of ILD/pneumonitis at any time (cumulative early- and later-onset) was comparable 
between the brigatinib and crizotinib arms (3.7% vs 2.2%, respectively). 
One of the 136 patients (0.7%) in the brigatinib arm and 3 of the 137 patients (2.2%) in the crizotinib 
arm had later-onset pneumonitis. The incidence of later-onset pneumonitis events in brigatinib-treated 
patients was lower in Study 301 compared with the brigatinib 90 mg QD→180 mg QD arm in 
Study 201 (0.7% vs 2.7%).  
Additionally, 1 of the 35 patients in the crizotinib arm who crossed over to brigatinib experienced 
pneumonitis on Day 3 of crossover; however, this patient had ground glass opacities on a chest CT 
scan before starting brigatinib. 
The rate of these events in the ALK inhibitor-naïve setting (~3%) appears to be lower than in the 
crizotinib-refractory setting in Study 201 (~6%). The rate of EOPEs in Study 301 in patients who have 
crossed over from crizotinib to brigatinib was ~6.6% (4 of 61 patients). In Study 201, a multivariate 
analysis indicated that short washout (<7 days) from crizotinib increased the risk of these pulmonary 
events.

Pancreatic Events 
No patients had clinical pancreatitis in either study 201 or 301. Chemical pancreatitis TEAEs occurred 
in 22.8% of patients in the brigatinib arm and 15.3% of patients in the crizotinib arm. With updated 
safety data these number increased to 26.5% and 19.0% of patients in the brigatinib vs crizotinib arm. 
Grade ≥3 events also occurred more frequently in the brigatinib arm (16.2%) compared with the 
crizotinib arm (5.1%).

Post marketing experience 
Available safety data from post marketing sources are consistent with the known safety profile on 
brigatinib; no new safety concerns were identified. The MAH continues to actively monitor safety 
information from post marketing sources, as well as within the overall clinical development program. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database regarding the safety of brigatinib are from both the 201 and 301 studies, and 110 
and 136 patients, respectively, have received the recommended dose. Updated safety data from the 
301 study have been provided during the procedure using the data cut-off 28 June 2019. The updated 
median exposure of brigatinib is prolonged to 24.3 months compared to 9.2 months (range 0-18) 
before and versus 17.2 months (range: 0-39) in the 201 study. More than two thirds of the patients 
were exposed to brigatinib for more than 12 months. The mean relative dose intensity of brigatinib 
was close to 90% in the 201 study and 96.9% in the 301 study, which is considered reassuring and it 
is expected that the first ALK-TKI is better tolerated than the following treatments. The exposure of 
almost 2 years allow for a sufficient assessment of the safety profile of brigatinib in the ALK inhibitor 
naïve setting.  
 
 
 
 
Updated data from the pivotal study 301 show that nearly all patients had adverse events with 
brigatinib and ~91% of these AEs were treatment-related. The most common clinical AEs in the 301 
study (brigatinib vs crizotinib) included decreased appetite (8.8% vs 19%), dysgeusia (2.9% vs 
13.9%), dizziness (14.7% vs 20.4%), visual impairment (0 vs 16.8%), photopsia (0.7% vs 20.4%), 
bradycardia (8.1% vs 15.3%), hypertension (31.6% vs 8%), diarrhea (52.2% vs 56.2%), nausea 
(30.1% vs 58.4%), vomiting (20.6% vs 43.8%), constipation (18.4% vs 41.6%), fatigue (19.1% vs 
22.6%), and peripheral oedema (6.6% vs 44.5%). More grade 3-4 AEs were observed in patients 
treated with brigatinib (66.2% vs 53.3%); and this was also observed for treatment-related grade 3-4 
events (55.9% vs 35%). 
Treatment-related events seem to be consistent with the pattern of the treatment-emergent AEs, and 
it is noted that more GI toxicity events were deemed treatment-related with crizotinib. Grade 3 
treatment-related AEs were more common with brigatinib, especially regarding CPK, lipase and 
amylase increased and hypertension. The incidence of grade ≥3 treatment-related AEs increased a bit 
with longer exposure, but clinically symptomatic events were rare and the overall rates are acceptable. 
Adverse events of special interest with clinically significant impact observed with either brigatinib or 
crizotinib included early-onset pneumonitis (EOPE), bradycardia, hypertension, GI events, hepatic 
events, creatine phosphokinase (CPK) elevation, and vision impairment. The incidence of EOPE was 
lower in the ALK TKI naive setting compared to study 201 (2.9% vs 6.4%). This was a very early onset 
event, as all events were observed within the first 8 days and before dose-escalation. It was initially 
agreed that the prolongation of the washout period from <7 days to 10 days could have proven 
beneficial, but with updated safety data with double as many patients in the sample size (35 vs 61 
patients), the rate was similar to the one observed in the second-line setting, i.e. 6.6% of those 
patients who crossed over to brigatinib after crizotinib. Hence, the lower incidence of EOPE in the first-
line setting may be attributed to the ALK inhibitor-naïve setting. The rate of EOPE of ~3% in the first-
line setting did not change with updated data and the events were clinically manageable due to the 
early onset and no fatal cases were observed in the first-line setting.  
The rate of other pneumonitis events was similar between the treatment arms.  Bradycardia was less 
frequent in the brigatinib arm (11.8%) compared with the crizotinib arm (23.4%), but was rarely of 
high grade. It is noted that slightly more patients had bradycardia in both arms with longer follow-up. 
However, the incidence is still acceptable and the event is considered clinically manageable. 
Hypertension was common in the brigatinib arm (32.4%) compared with the crizotinib arm (8.2%). 
Grade ≥3 hypertension was observed in 11.8% of patients with brigatinib and 2.9% of patients with 
crizotinib; however, the event is medically and clinically manageable. More GI toxicity were observed 
with crizotinib, especially nausea, vomiting and constipation. However, a similar incidence of diarrhea 
was observed with both study treatments. It is noted that high-grade treatment-related events were 
observed in 5.1% on brigatinib vs 10.9% of patients in the crizotinib arm. Because very few patients 
discontinued treatments due to GI toxicity, these events are considered overall clinically manageable. 
Hepatic events occurred in 33.8% of patients in the brigatinib arm and 43.8% of patients in the 
crizotinib arm.  The Grade ≥3 AEs that occurred in more than 1 patient in the brigatinib or crizotinib 
arms were blood ALP increased (2.9% vs 0.7%), ALT increased (3.7% vs 10.2%), AST increased 
(3.7% vs 6.6%), and gamma-glutamyltransferase increased (1.5% vs 2.2%). It is noted that there 
were no clinically symptomatic hepatoxicity events, and no patients met the Hy’s law laboratory 
criteria in either study. Hence, the level of hepatotoxicity is considered acceptable. Elevated CPK was 
very common with brigatinib (46.3%) compared with crizotinib (17.5%), and grade ≥3 events were 
markedly more frequent with brigatinib (24.3%) compared to crizotinib (1.5%). However, the number 
of patients with clinical symptoms such as myalgia or musculoskeletal pain was similar between arms, 
so this class effect is considered clinically manageable. Vision impairment occurred in markedly fewer 
patients on brigatinib (14.0%) compared with crizotinib (54.7%), and although these events were only 
 
 
of high grade in 1 patient on crizotinib (photopsia), this is considered a clinically significant difference. 
The incidence and severity of vision impairment events in brigatinib treated patients did not change 
significantly with updated data. 
As part of this procedure, increased blood cholesterol was identified as a new ADR with a frequency of 
8.0% (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Serious adverse events were more common with crizotinib (37.2% vs 33.1%) and it is noted that with 
brigatinib the most common serious events were pneumonia and pneumonitis. Updated safety data 
increased the incidences slightly, probably due to the longer exposure, but the level of SAEs and 
treatment-related SAEs are still acceptable. 
There was a similar number of deaths with any AEs in each arm (9 vs 10 patients) of the 301 study; 
and of the nine deaths in the brigatinib arm, 5 are agreed to be lung-cancer related. There were no 
treatment-related deaths. 
A shift to any grade of clinical chemistry was more common with crizotinib compared to brigatinib 
regarding ALT increased, potassium increased, creatinine increased, albumin decreased, and calcium 
decreased. However, the shifts were rarely to grade 3-4 toxicity except for ALT increased (12.4%). 
Any shifts that were observed more commonly with brigatinib were lipase increased, amylase 
increased, glucose increased, magnesium decreased, calcium increased, and potassium decreased. 
Again, the shifts were rarely to grade 3-4 toxicity. Updated safety data showed a small increase of the 
incidences; however, this is acceptable and expected with longer exposure. 
Discontinuations due to AEs are more frequent with brigatinib (12.5%) vs crizotinib (8.8%), and was 
mostly due to ILD/pneumonitis and pneumonia. The discontinuation rates with brigatinib are similar in 
the 201 and 301 studies and are considered acceptable. Dose interruptions due to an AE also occurred 
more frequently with brigatinib (66.2% vs 46.7%) and it is noted that this was due to increased CPK, 
lipase, amylase or hypertension in many cases. Dose interruptions for crizotinib were mainly due to 
increased ALT, AST and decreased neutrophils and clinical AEs of nausea and vomiting. Dose 
reductions were also more common with brigatinib but again dominated by clinical chemistry AEs (CPK, 
amylase and lipase increased), while the AEs leading to dose reduction of crizotinib were clinical AEs 
such as nausea and vomiting. The recommendations for dose modifications with elevation of CPK are 
further clarified and strengthened in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Updated safety data do not change this 
pattern significantly and data are consistent with the known safety profiles of the study drugs. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The comparison of the safety profiles of brigatinib or crizotinib in the ALK inhibitor naïve setting is now 
possible due to updated safety data with a median exposure to brigatinib of almost 2 years. Overall, 
the toxicities with brigatinib are well known and updated data confirm that the safety profile for 
brigatinib in the first-line setting is acceptable and no new safety issues have been raised. It is 
particularly reassuring that there were no new case of EOPE and the events are clinically manageable.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have 
been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. Annex II has been revised to reflect 
the new due date for the provision of the final results from study 301. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The information in the Patient Information Leaflet (PIL) adequately reflects both the currently 
approved indication and the proposed indication. 
In accordance with articles 59(3) and 61(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, the MAH included the results of 
user testing of the Patient Information Leaflet (PL) during the review of the initial marketing 
authorization application for Alunbrig. 
The additional indication is intended to treat NSCLC and has a similar safety profile. Furthermore, there 
have been no changes to the layout of the PIL. Therefore, the MAH has not conducted a user 
consultation on the PIL in relation to the additional proposed indication on the basis that there has 
been no change that may affect the readability of the PL. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The Applicant is seeking an extension of indication to include treatment of adult patients with 
anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously 
untreated with an ALK-inhibitor. The proposed revised wording of indication is the following:  
Alunbrig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously untreated with an ALK 
inhibitor. 
In addition to the current indication: 
Alunbrig is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic lymphoma 
kinase (ALK) positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously treated with crizotinib. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Other available therapies for this patient population in the ALK-TKI naïve setting are mainly the 
second-generation ALK-TKIs alectinib and ceritinib. In principle, chemotherapy and the first generation 
ALK-TKI crizotinib are also approved for first-line therapy, but due to inferior efficacy compared to 
alectinib and ceritinib in the first-line setting, these options are rarely used. Checkpoint inhibitors may 
also be used in combination with platinum-based chemotherapy, however, the median PFS with 
checkpoint inhibitors and platinum-based chemotherapy in this setting has been shown to be 
 
 
approximately 8 to 9 months in comparison to a PFS of 34.8 months on alectinib (Camidge et al. 
2019), 16.6 months with ceritinib, and 10.4 months with crizotinib.  
Hence, the targeted patient population has a number of options in the context of a palliative setting 
with a chance of a median progression-free survival of almost 3 years in the proposed setting with 
alectinib. The median OS with alectinib in the same setting is still immature (Alecensa II/01 EPAR). 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study for this application is the multicenter, randomised phase 3 ALTA 1L trial, comparing 
brigatinib with crizotinib in the ALK TKI-naïve setting. 275 patients were randomised 1:1 in 92 
investigational sites across the world, mainly in the EU (55 sites) and the Asia-Pacific (24 sites). The 
study was fully recruited by 14 months; however, initial efficacy data presented are with less than a 
year of follow-up (11.1 months for the brigatinib arm) and from data cut-off 19 February 2018. 
Updated efficacy data are presented from data cut-off 28 June 2019 with a follow-up of 24.9 months 
for the brigatinib arm. 
The primary endpoint is PFS by BIRC and the key secondary endpoints tested hierarchically are 
confirmed ORR, intracranial ORR, intracranial PFS, and OS. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary analysis of PFS by BIRC was improved from 9.8 months on crizotinib to not reached with a 
HR of 0.492 and based on 26.3% events with brigatinib vs 45.7% events with crizotinib. Updated data 
from the second IA show that the median PFS by BIRC was improved from 11.0 months to 24.0 
months (95%CI: 18.5, NE) with a HR of 0.489 and based on 46% events with brigatinib vs 63% 
events with crizotinib. 
The updated key secondary endpoint of confirmed ORR by BIRC was improved by approximately 10%, 
so more patients had an overall response to brigatinib 73.7% (95%CI: 65.52; 80.87) compared to 
crizotinib 61.6% (95%CI: 52.94; 69.74). 
Updated intracranial ORR for patients with any brain metastases at baseline (n=90) is improved with 
brigatinib i.e. 66% (95%CI: 50.69; 79.14) vs 16.3% (95%CI: 7.32; 29.66) with crizotinib. Updated 
intracranial PFS in patients with any brain metastases at baseline showed a median iPFS of 24 months 
with brigatinib vs 5.69 months with crizotinib. 
Overall, 70 deaths have been reported by the updated data cut-off, and consequently the median OS 
has still not been reached in either arm. The event rates are 24.1% in the brigatinib arm and 26.8% in 
the crizotinib arm. 
Time to response were similar between the arms and the median was approximately 1.8 months, 
which is consistent with previous data on brigatinib and other ALK-TKI’s. The DOR by BIRC was not 
reached (95%CI: 19.38, NE) for brigatinib and 13.8 months (95%CI: 9.30, 20.80) for crizotinib. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
OS results will be confounded by the allowed crossover from crizotinib to brigatinib at time of 
progression and subsequent treatments, but even so, no detrimental effect on OS is observed with 
updated data. The final PFS and OS analysis will be submitted post authorisation (see Annex II). 
 
 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the pivotal study 301, nearly all patients had adverse events with brigatinib and ~91% of patients 
had treatment-related AEs. The most common clinical AEs in the 301 study (brigatinib vs crizotinib) 
included decreased appetite (8.8% vs 19%), dysgeusia (2.9% vs 13.9%), dizziness (14.7% vs 
20.4%), visual impairment (0 vs 16.8%), photopsia (0.7% vs 20.4%), bradycardia (8.1% vs 15.3%), 
hypertension (31.6 vs 8%), diarrhea (52.2% vs 56.2%), nausea (30.1% vs 58.4%), vomiting (20.6% 
vs 43.8), constipation (18.4 vs 41.6%), fatigue (19.1% vs 22.6%), and peripheral oedema (6.6% vs 
44.5%). Grade 3 AEs were observed more frequently in patients treated with brigatinib (72.8% vs 
61.3%); and this was also observed for treatment-related grade 3 events (46.3% vs 25.5%).  
Regarding treatment-related events, these seem to be consistent with the pattern of the treatment-
emergent AEs. Grade 3 treatment-related AEs were more common with brigatinib, especially regarding 
CPK and lipase increased. 
Adverse events of special interest included EOPE, bradycardia, hypertension, GI events, hepatic 
events, CPK elevation, and vision impairment. The incidence of EOPE was lower in the ALK inhibitor 
naïve setting compared to study 201 (2.9% vs 6.4%) and was observed within the first 8 days of 
treatment with brigatinib and before dose-escalation. Grade 3 4 ILD/pneumonitis  events were 
reported in 2.2 % of patients. Additionally, 3.7% of patients experienced pneumonitis later in 
treatment. The rate of other pneumonitis events was similar between treatment arms. Bradycardia was 
less frequent in the brigatinib arm (11.8%) compared with the crizotinib arm (23.4%), and was rarely 
of high grade. Hypertension was common in the brigatinib arm (32.4%) compared with the crizotinib 
arm (8.2%) and grade ≥3 events were observed in 11.8% of patients in the brigatinib arm and 2.9% of 
patients in the crizotinib arm. GI toxicity were frequently observed with crizotinib, especially nausea, 
vomiting and constipation. However, a similar incidence of diarrhea was observed with both study 
treatments. High-grade treatment-related events were observed in 5.1% on brigatinib vs 10.9% of 
patients in the crizotinib arm. Hepatic events occurred in 33.8% of patients in the brigatinib arm and 
43.8% of patients in the crizotinib arm. There were no clinically symptomatic hepatoxicity events, and 
no patients met the Hy’s law laboratory criteria in either study. Elevated CPK was very common with 
brigatinib (46.3%) compared with crizotinib (17.5%), and grade ≥3 events were more frequent with 
brigatinib (24.3%) compared to crizotinib (1.5%). The proportion of patients with myalgia or 
musculoskeletal pain was similar between treatment arms. Vision impairment occurred less frequent 
on brigatinib (14%) compared with crizotinib (54.7%), and an event of high grade was observed in 1 
patient on crizotinib (photopsia).   
Serious adverse events were more common with crizotinib (37.2% vs 33.1%).  
A shift to any grade of clinical chemistry were more common with crizotinib compared to brigatinib 
regarding ALT increased, potassium increased, creatinine increased, albumin decreased, and calcium 
decreased. The shifts were rarely to grade 3-4 toxicity except for ALT increased (12.4%). Any shifts 
that were observed more commonly with brigatinib were lipase increased, amylase increased, glucose 
increased, magnesium decreased, calcium increased, and potassium decreased. The shifts were rarely 
to grade 3-4 toxicity.  
Discontinuations due to AEs were observed more frequently with brigatinib (12.5%) vs crizotinib 
(8.8%), and was mostly due to ILD/pneumonitis and pneumonia in the brigatinib arm. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There are currently no major uncertainties in relation to the safety profile of brigatinib.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy of brigatinib was demonstrated in the ALK TKI-naïve setting, as one line of chemotherapy was 
allowed, and this is reflected in the indication and considered acceptable. The observed 13 months 
improvement of PFS by BIRC (HR 0.49) is statistically significant and is considered clinically meaningful 
in this non-curable setting. Moreover, the data are now considered mature with median follow up of ~2 
years in the brigatinib arm. Intracranial efficacy results are considered supportive of the primary 
endpoint and show a clinically relevant treatment effect. Updated efficacy data regarding PFS, provided 
during the procedure, show a clinically and statistically significant 13 months improvement, a 10% 
improvement in ORR, and a prolongation of DOR, which are supportive of the primary efficacy 
endpoint. Moreover, there are no signs of a detrimental effect on OS with brigatinib. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
With a median exposure of ~2 years allow for a sufficient assessment of the safety profile of brigatinib, 
and the incidence of AEs, ADRs, and AEs of special interest did not change clinically significantly. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The improvement of PFS, ORR, DOR and intracranial efficacy is balanced with the safety profile of 
brigatinib in the first-line setting.   
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Alunbrig as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with anaplastic 
lymphoma kinase (ALK) positive advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) previously not treated 
with an ALK inhibitor is positive.

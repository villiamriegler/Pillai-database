SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION  
1. 
Introduction 
Imatinib  is  a  protein-tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor,  which  inhibits  the  Abl  tyrosine  kinase  at  the  in  vitro, 
cellular and in vivo level. The compound specifically inhibits proliferation of v-ABL and BCR-ABL 
expressing  cells.  In  addition,  imatinib  inhibits  the  activity  of  the  platelet-derived  growth  factor 
receptors  (PDGFR)  α  and  β,  c-kit,  the  receptor  for  stem  cell  factors  (SCF),  c-Fms,  the  receptor  for 
macrophage-stimulating factors (M-CSF), as well as the ABL and Arg PTK. Imatinib also inhibits the 
cell signalling events mediated by activation of BCR-ABL, c-Kit and the PDGF receptors. 
The MAH submitted a type II variation for Glivec, proposing to include “Treatment of adult patients 
with hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES) and/or chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL)” 
Folowing the  assessment the indication  has  been specified for  HES/CEL patients  with  demonstrated 
FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase. A starting dose of 100 mg/day is recommended. Dose increase from 
100  mg  to  400  mg  for  these  patients  may  be  considered  in  the  absence  of  adverse  drug  reactions  if 
assessments demonstrate an insufficient response to therapy. 
The  COMP  granted  Glivec  the  orphan  status  for  HES  on  19  August  2005.  A  Commission  Decision 
was issued on 28 October 2005. 
Clinical aspects 
into  “classic” 
Chronic  myeloproliferative  diseases  (CMPD)  can  be  classified  as  either  being  Bcr-Abl  positive  or 
negative. Classic Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) is defined by the presence of the Bcr-Abl 
fusion kinase RNA transcripts in the blood and bone marrow. Bcr-Abl negative CMPD can be further 
classified 
include  polycythemia  vera,  essential 
thrombocythemia,  and  myelofibrosis  with  myeloid  metaplasia.  Other  disorders  that  are  Bcr-Abl 
negative share certain phenotypic characteristics of the “classic” forms of CMPD, but are considered 
“atypical”  as  they  have  other  unique  features.  Clinicopathologically  these  disorders  include 
mastocytosis, varying forms of eosinophilic disorders (including HES, CEL), chronic myelomonocytic 
leukemia  (CMML),  juvenile  myelomonocytic  leukemia,  chronic  neutrophilic  leukemia,  and  an 
unclassified category of mixed or hybrid CMPD (Pardanani & Tefferi 2004
forms  of  CMPD,  which 
). 
Idiopathic  hypereosinophilic  disorder  is  a  rare  hematological  disorder  characterized  by  chronic 
overproduction  of  eosinophils,  tissue  infiltration  and  organ  damage.  Diagnostic  criteria  include 
sustained  eosinophilia  (>1500  eosinophils/mm3)  for  more  than  six  months,  exclusion  of  reactive 
causes  of  hypereosinophilia,  such  as  parasitic  infections  or  allergic  reactions,  and  evidence  of  end 
organ  involvement.  Following  original  classification,  other  classification  schemes  developed  that 
required  HES  remain  a  disorder  of  exclusion  of  all  other  causes,  including  eosinophilia  of  clonal 
origin,  such  as  the  atypical  chronic  myeloproliferative  disorders  mentioned  in  the  first  paragraph  of 
this section. In this instance, the clonal disorders would be classified as chronic eosinophilic leukemia 
(CEL).  In  the  most  current  WHO  classification,  a  diagnosis  of  HES  or  CEL  requires  exclusion  of 
reactive causes, of malignancies in which eosinophilia is reactive or part of the neoplastic clone, and 
of  T-cell  disorders  with  immunophenotype  and  cytokine  production  abnormalities,  with  or  without 
evidence of lymphocyte clonality, as reported by Bain, et al (2001)
. The authors further commented 
on  the  separation  of  HES  and  CEL,  following  the  report  by  Cools, et al (2003)
  demonstrating  that 
many  patients  with  HES  had  a  clonal  molecular  abnormality,  the  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  fusion  gene 
(Bain 2004b)   .

If no such evidence was found, Bain (2004a)    still felt a diagnosis of CEL could be based on clinical 
features  (i.e.  elevated  blasts,  etc.).  Although  the  WHO  classification  of  eosinophilic  disorders 
recommends  a  diagnosis  of  CEL  when  clonality  is  proven  and  maintains  that  the  idiopathic 
hypereosinophilic  syndrome  (IHES)  remains  a  diagnosis  of  exclusion,  several  authors  have  pointed

(Vandenberghe, et al 2004, Martinelli, et al 2006)
. Elevated blasts in blood and marrow are often 
not  present  in  patients  with  CEL  defined  by  detecting  a  cytogenetic  abnormality,  other  surrogate 
clinical/laboratory markers for CEL are often also present in IHES, and organ infiltration/damage can 
occur in both disorders. For this reason, the sponsor will broadly define HES as including both CEL 
and IHES in his description of the role of imatinib in the treatment of these disorders in the dossier.

in 
Eosinophils derive in the bone marrow from CD34+ myeloid progenitor stem cells and differentiate in 
response to a number of T-cell derived eosinophilic cytokines and growth factors including IL-3, GM-
CSF  and  IL-5  (Ackerman & Butterfield 2005)
.  Eosinophils  participate  broadly  in  a  variety  of 
functional  roles,  including  host  defense,  allergic  responses,  and  inflammatory  reactions  (including 
tissue  injury  and  fibrosis).  Clinically,  these  multiple  functions  lead  to  the  protean  manifestations  of 
eosinophilic  disorders.  The  clinical  manifestations  of  organ  infiltration  and  subsequent  dysfunction 
often dominate the clinical picture. Patients with HES have a predilection for organ infiltration of the 
heart, the central and peripheral nervous system, the lungs and the skin.  
The  illness  most  often  develops  in  patients  20  to  50  years  of  age  and  has  a  strong  male  to  female 
predilection (9:1 ratio) (Fauci, et al 1982)
. End organ manifestations are multiple.

The  most  commonly  encountered  clinical  events,  and  often  the  most  serious,  are  the  cardiovascular 
complications that occur in 50-75% of all patients. These are often life threatening and life limiting in 
patients  with  HES.  In  the  early  phases  of  cardiac  involvement,  eosinophilic  infiltration  can  cause 
inflammatory  disorders  of  the  heart  and  intramural  thrombi  to  form  on  the  endocardial  surfaces.  In 
time,  inflammation  leads  to  fibrosis  leading  to  valvular  disorders  and  constrictive  pericarditis.  Once 
fibrosis  occurs,  the  cardiac  conditions  are  irreversible  by  medical  therapy  alone  and  often  require 
cardiac surgical procedures for control. 
Treatment  for  HES,  once  appropriate  diagnostic  and  extent  of  disease  evaluations  have  been 
performed, employ algorithms for treatment based on the presence or absence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRα 
2 
fusion  gene  (see  discussion  below  “The  role  of  genetics  in  HES”).  If  the  patient  does  not  have  the 
FIP1L1-PDGFRα  fusion  gene,  no  extreme  eosinophilia  in  the  peripheral  blood,  and  no  evidence  of 
organ  dysfunction,  following  the  patient  quarterly  with  re-evaluations  is  the  currently  accepted 
approach.  
If the disease is more extreme, then systemic corticosteroid therapies are generally administered using 
various regimens. If  control  is  not achieved,  other  agents are added  or  used,  including hydroxyurea, 
interferon-α, vincristine and alkylating agents. Pheresis, anticoagulation, cardiac surgery, splenectomy, 
stem  cell  transplantation,  and  investigational  agents  are  included  under  specialized  circumstances 
(Ackerman & Butterfield, 2005)
.  
Hypereosinophilic syndrome remains a serious disease in many patients with continued unmet medical 
needs  for  therapy,  especially  if  the  patient’s  condition  is  not  easily  improved  with  systemic 
corticosteroids  or  if  the  patient  develops  serious  signs  of  organ  dysfunction.  Traditional  cytotoxic 
chemotherapies  are  difficult  to  take  and  not  very  effective.  Plasmapheresis  and  major  surgical 
procedures are not easy for the patient to tolerate and do not treat the underlying cause of the disorder. 
Thus, newer approaches to the treatment of HES in patients with aggressive forms of the disease need 
to  be  developed.  Early  reports,  prior  to  recognition  and  treatment  techniques  for  the  cardiovascular 
complications, gave a dismal prognosis for patients with HES. Improvements in therapies and patient 
support generally led to survival rates in the late 1980s reported as 80% at 5 years and 40% at 10 and 
15 years (Ackerman & Butterfield 2005)
. 
The role of genetics in HES 
The clonal nature of some patients with HES was first described utilizing X-inactivation assays in the 
1990s, however it was the description of a fusion gene on chromosome 4 (FIP1L1-PDGFRα) that first 
described a clonal genetic abnormality related to the HES phenotype and a rationale for its treatment 
with imatinib (Cools, et al 2003)
. FIP1L1-PDGFRα is a unique fusion gene caused by the fusion of 
the  FIP1L1  gene  to  the  PDGFRα  gene.  The  fusion  results  from  an  interstitial  deletion  of 
approximately  800-kb  on  chromosome  4q12  that  includes  the  cysteine-rich  hydrophobic  domain  2 
(CHIC2)  locus.  This  small  deletion  is  not  readily  seen  in  routine  karyotyping,  hence  it  has  been 
described as a “silent deletion”. The resulting fusion kinase, FIP1L1-PDGFRα, is constitutively active 
and drives the phenotype of HES in patients who have it. It is also a target for imatinib.  
Other  clonal  and  molecular  genetic  abnormalities  have  been  identified  in  patients  with  HES.  These 
may or may not be associated with easily identified karyotypic abnormalities, but have added further 
weight to  arguments and classification schemes driving attempts to separate CEL from IHES. There 
have  been  multiple  molecular  genetic  abnormalities  detected  in  patients  with  eosinophilic  disorders 
and recent reviews are available that describe them (Bain 2004a, Gotlib, et al 2004)
. Some of these 
reports  describe  clonal  abnormalities  of  PDGFRβ,  another  known 
imatinib 
(Apperley, et al 2002)
.  Other  as  yet  undescribed  cytogenetic  abnormalities  and  fusion  kinases 
sensitive to imatinib may be found in patients with HES and myeloproliferative disorders associated 
with eosinophilia (Cools, et al 2003)
target 
for 
. 
A  proportion  of  patients  with  HES  demonstrate  a  clonal  expansion  of  abnormal  lymphocyte 
populations.  The  abnormal  T-cell  populations  may  overexpress  the  cytokine  IL-5,  leading  to  the 
expansion  of  the  eosinophil  mass  causing  manifestations  of  HES.  Clonal  rearrangements  of  T-cell 
genes have been described and this T-cell stimulated mechanism may explain other cases of HES. It is 
currently unknown whether subsets of T-cell associated HES also express the FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion 
gene. Additionally, the sensitivity of HES patients with this T-cell driven pathogenesis to imatinib is 
unknown. Recent reviews comment on this aspect of HES (Gotlib, et al 2004)
. 
Imatinib  specifically  inhibits  Abl,  PDGFRs,  and  c-Kit  kinases  and  displays  impressive  clinical 
efficacy  in  Bcr-Abl-positive  CML.  (Cools, et al 2003)
  were  the  first  to  describe  the  relationship 
between FIP1L1-PDGFRα, patients with HES, and the response of the target to imatinib. They showed 
that the proliferation of Ba/F3 cells expressing FIP1L1-PDGFRα was inhibited by imatinib (IC50) at 
3.2 nM,  whereas  the  same  measure  for  cells  expressing  Bcr-Abl  was  582 nM.  The  publication 
described responses in 9 of 11 patients treated with imatinib and the presence of FIP1L1-PDGFRα in 5 
of the 9 patients whose illness responded for more than 3 months. The subsequent detection of a T647I 
mutation  in  PDGFRα,  a  mutation  known  to  confer  resistance  to  imatinib,  in  a  patient  who  relapsed

gave  further  proof  that  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  was  causally  related  to  the  disorder  in  some  patients.

Clinical studies 
This application is supported by: 
•  A phase II open label [Study B2225] in patients with life threatening diseases, including HES, 
known to be associated with one or more imatinib-sensitive tyrosine kinases and 
•  34 publications and one manuscript submitted for publication (Martinelli, et al 2006)
. 
The total number of HES and CEL patients included is 176 (14 from [Study B2225] and 162 from the 
publications). 
At  least  three  investigator-led  studies,  CSTI571ADE31,  CSTI571AIT12  and  CSTI571AUS19,  are 
enrolling patients with HES. These studies are ongoing. 
Study  B2225  was  an  open-label,  multicenter,  non-randomized,  uncontrolled,  single  arm  study 
evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  in  patients  suffering  from  different  life-threatening  diseases 
associated with Abl, Kit or PDGFR PTK and refractory to standard therapeutic options or for which 
no conventional therapies of definitive benefit existed. 
2. 1.  Methods 
Patients were eligible to receive imatinib treatment in this study, provided they had a malignant, life-
threatening disease (solid or haematological malignancies) and the disease was refractory to standard 
therapeutic options or no conventional therapies of definitive benefit existed. Other inclusion criteria 
were an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 to 2, adequate end organ 
function,  life  expectancy  of  more  than  3  months,  adequate  contraception  and  written,  informed 
consent.   
The primary objective of the study was to assess the efficacy of imatinib in patients suffering from 
different  malignancies  known  to  be  associated  with  one  or  more  imatinib-sensitive  PTKs  following 
failure of standard therapeutic options or without therapeutic options of definitive benefit.  
The  primary  efficacy  variable  was  the  frequency  of  response  to  treatment,  although  no  formal 
definition  of  response  was  included  in  the  protocol  for  haematologic  malignancies.  The  activity  of 
imatinib  was  assessed  primarily  by  evaluating  normalization  of  blood  counts,  and/or  relevant  bone 
marrow  or radiologic assessments (e.g. radionuclide scanning). The  response for either  of these was 
captured  in  the  same  way  and  categorized  as  complete  response,  partial  response;  stable  disease/no 
response, progressive disease or unknown. The best response status was classified as unknown for any 
category of response (except progressive disease) if not confirmed by a subsequent evaluation after at 
least 4 weeks. Tumor status was assessed at baseline, at Visits 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and at End of Study. 
The planned duration of the study was 2 years. 
The main clinical secondary efficacy variable was the evolution of the ECOG performance status. It 
was assessed at baseline and at Visits 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and End of Study. Similarly, periodic weight 
assessments were summarized by visit looking at changes over time. 
The  secondary  objectives  were  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  imatinib,  to  evaluate  the 
pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of imatinib in selected patients and to assess, if feasible, the functional 
significance of relevant signal-transduction components in target tissues by evaluating the expression 
and  activation status  of the relevant tyrosine  kinase  molecules  or associated signaling  molecules, by 
measuring indices of cellular proliferation and by correlating the changes in the above findings with 
clinical outcomes.  
Safety  assessments  consisted  of  evaluating  adverse  events  (AE)  and  serious  adverse  events  (SAE), 
laboratory  parameters  including  hematology,  biochemistry,  vital  signs,  physical  examinations,  and 
documentation of all concomitant medications and therapies. All safety and efficacy evaluations were 
performed on patients who received at least one dose of study medication.

Dosing and exposure 
No dose finding studies have been performed. The dose of imatinib for this study was chosen on the 
basis of demonstrated efficacy and safety in other malignant diseases, suggesting that a similar dose 
could  be  employed  to  explore  the  efficacy  of  imatinib  in  the  new  indication.  Patients  with 
haematologic malignancies were initiated on imatinib therapy at a dose level of 400 mg/day. 
In  the  published  literature  listed  in  this  submission,  patients  received  doses  ranging  from  100 mg  to 
800 mg  daily.  From  the  reports,  the  dose  selection  rationale  used  by  investigators  included  the 
recognition  of  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  inhibition  by  low  concentration  exposures  to  imatinib,  empiricism, 
the clinical status of the patients, known efficacy and safety profile of imatinib at the 400 mg dose. 
reduced 
to  200 mg  weekly 
None of these studies were large enough to provide a dose selection rationale and were not designed 
for  this  purpose.  In  the  first  case  series  report,  the  investigator  made  an  empiric  decision  to  begin 
treatment  with  100 mg  daily,  which  was 
responders 
(Gleich, et al 2002)
.  In  the  largest  case  series,  patients  were  begun  at  a  dose  of  100 mg  and  then 
increased in 100 mg increments weekly to a dose of 400 mg (Martinelli, et al 2006)
. Clearly patients 
with  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  can  develop  responses  on  doses  of  imatinib  as  low  as  100 mg  per  day,  but 
other investigators have  administered imatinib  at 400 mg  per  day to such  patients. The  median  dose 
intensity was as planned in the protocol, approximately 400 mg daily for hematological malignancies, 
indicating a good compliance by the patients. The mean dose intensity HES patient was slightly higher 
than planned dose in patients with hematological malignancies (473 mg, 118%), similar to the median 
dose  intensity  in  the  whole  population  with  hematological  malignancies.  Of  note,  the  frequency  of 
dose variation (dose escalation) due to lack of efficacy is very similar in the two populations (11.4% in 
solid tumors and 11.1% in hematological malignancies).

In the group of 14 patients with HES, four patients experienced a partial response (PR) with durations 
of response of at least 348, 394, 131 and 183 days and time to progression censored on Days 429, 421, 
349  and  210,  respectively.  The  duration  of  this  partial  response  was  longer  than  4  months.  Another 
two  patients  had SD,  one  kept  on treatment for  678 days while the  other  progressed  after  400  days. 
Two  patients  had  “Unknown”  as  best  response  due  to  missing  data;  one  with  time  to  progression 
censored on Day 177, the other progressing after 114 days.  
The  ECOG  performance  status  for  the  HES  population  is  better  at  baseline  than  in  the  overall 
population (no worse than 2). In these patients, the overall ECOG performance status did not change 
substantially,  with  two  patients  having  worsened  ECOG  at  the  end  of  the  study  (but  only  one  with 
ECOG 2) and two patients improving their ECOG at the end of study from ECOG 1 to ECOG 0. 
The  results  in  ECOG  status  do  not  provide  relevant  efficacy  information.  The  results  of  cytogenetic 
response have not been provided and seem to have not been  collected. There is not any information 
about improvement of symptoms or organ damage related to HES either. 
As there is no description of the presence and type of any mutation or disease status in these 4 patients, 
it is not possible to analyse if these aspects were correlated with response.  
Only  patients  aged  15  years  old  or  older  were  included  in  study  B2225.  As  HES/CEL  is  usually 
diagnosed in adults, the age group investigated is adequate.

* The publication states that the patient presented with a reduction in eosinophils to 10.3% associated with a marked decrease in mast cells 
after 4 weeks with 100 mg/day imatinib. However, at 8 weeks, the Eo count increased again in the peripheral blood; an increased dose of 
200 mg/day was temporarily effective up to 30 weeks of treatment, after which the disease became refractory to the increased dose. 
**  The  publication  states  that  a  complete  hematological  remission  was  achieved,  although  this  patient  had only  a  transient  response  to 
100 mg/day imatinib, which lasted several weeks, and had no response to an increased dose of imatinib 
***  The  publication  states  that  the  patient  experienced  transient  normalization  of  peripheral  Eo  counts  within  1  week  of  the start  of 
100 mg/day  imatinib.  Two  weeks  later,  the  symptoms  recurred  and  the  Eo  count  increased  without  further  improvement  despite  dose 
increase to 400 mg.

Haematological response 
107  out  of  162  patients  (66%)  reported  in  the  literature  experienced  a  complete  hematological 
response. Cytogenetic abnormalities were evaluated in 117 of the 176 patients treated in the published 
reports  and  [Study B2225].  Sixty-one  out  of  these  117  patients  had  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  fusion  kinase. 
All  these  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  fusion  kinase  positive  patients  achieved  a  complete  hematological 
response.  
The  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  fusion  kinase  was  either  negative  or  unknown  in  115  patients,  of  which  62 
(54%) achieved either a complete (n=46) or partial (n=16) hematological response. 
Cytogenetic and molecular response 
There are several reports of complete cytogenetic response and a few of molecular response.

Additionally,  although  the  evaluation  of  hematological  responses  as  defined  by  improvement  in 
hematologic and bone marrow abnormalities was the primary basis for determining response in these 
patients, improvements in symptomatology and other organ  dysfunction abnormalities were reported 
by the investigators.  
In  the  largest  case  series  in  this  application,  28  out  of  59  patients  (47%)  presented  with  organ 
involvement  (Martinelli, et al 2006)
. The  most common  organ involvement was  with  lung, skin  or 
heart, and less common with liver, spleen or soft tissue. Organ involvement regression was recorded in 
all the patients that reached CR.  La Starza, et al (2005)
 published the  second largest case series in 
which  lung,  heart,  skin,  CNS,  or  gastrointestinal  involvement  were  reported  in  10  of  12  patients. 
Improvements  were  observed  in  heart  and  CNS  involvement.  Klion, et al (2004) 
  treated  seven 
patients who presented with lung, heart, skin, and spleen involvement. Organ involvement resolved or 
normalized  in  all  but  the  heart.  Although  the  patients’  constitutional  symptoms  improved,  the  signs 
and  symptoms  of  congestive  heart  failure  in  three  patients  with  endomyocardial  fibrosis  remained 
unaffected.  End  organ  damage  caused  by  eosinophilic  infiltration  is  reversible  to  a  point,  but  once 
organ  fibrosis  occurs  in  response  to  the  infiltration  the  disorder  is  unlikely  to  be  reversible  with 
therapy.

Summary of Published Case Series and Case Reports 
Schaller and Burkland (2001)
were  the  first  to  report  that  treatment  with  imatinib  at  a  dose  of 
100 mg/day caused rapid and complete hematological remission (CHR) in a 41-year-old male patient 
with HES who suffered from severe, intractable side effects of long-term hydroxyurea and interferon-
α therapy.  
Ault, et al (2002)
  reported  on  a  54-year-old  male  patient  with  HES  resistant  to  steroids  and 
chemotherapy,  with  persistent  hip  pain.  Upon  administration  of  imatinib  at  100 mg/day,  the  patient 
had a rapid and significant reduction of hip pains, as well as rapid improvement of the hemoglobin and 
platelet counts and disappearance of eosinophilia. He experienced no side effect from the therapy, but 
developed fulminant pneumococcal sepsis and died three months after initiation of imatinib treatment. 
Gleich, et al (2002)
 reported positive response to imatinib 100 mg/day in 4 of 5 patients with HES. 
One  of  these  patients  had  previously  been  reported  by  Schaller and Burkland (2001)
.  Responding 
patients  were  all  males  with  normal  serum  interleukin-5  levels.  Analysis  for  c-Kit  activation  loop 
mutation (D816V) in the responding patients was negative, suggesting that c-Kit was not the target of 
imatinib. 
Gotlib, et al (2002)
 described imatinib treatment of 5 male patients with HES unresponsive to prior 
therapies including corticosteroids and/or hydroxyurea. Four patients had a normal karyotype and one 
patient  had  a  t(1:4)  translocation.  A  complete  hematologic  remission  was  rapidly  achieved  in  all 
patients, which was still ongoing at the time of the publication. 
11 
 
Nolasco, et al (2002)
 reported  on  a  46-year-old  male with  normal  karyotype and Bcr-Abl  negative 
by PCR analysis. After treatment with interferon-α associated to glucocoticosteroids and hydroxyurea 
was  discontinued  due  to  GI  intolerance,  hydroxyurea  was  stopped  and  imatinib  at  100 mg/day  was 
started.  Within  one  week,  Eo  count  decreased  rapidly  and  reached  normal  levels  at  the  end  of  the 
second  week  of  treatment.  Glucocorticosteroids  were  progressively  discontinued  and  imatinib  was 
tapered  to  100 mg  twice  weekly  by  the  end  of  the  fourth  week.  A  bone  marrow  biopsy  at  the  time 
showed only rare eosinophils and slight fibrosis. Since then, the patient remains asymptomatic and is 
off any other type of treatment. 
Cools, et al (2003)
 enrolled 16 patients with HES. All patients had received prior therapy with no or 
limited  success  including,  but  not  limited  to,  prednisone,  hydroxyurea  and/or  interferon-α.  Eleven 
patients  (9  men  and  2  women)  with  symptomatic  disease  (e.g.  endomyocardial  fibrosis, 
gastrointestinal  Eo  infiltrates,  cranial  nerve  palsies,  rash,  hepatosplenomegaly)  were  treated  with 
imatinib.  Treatment  with  imatinib  (100-400 mg/day)  resulted  in  CHR  in  10  of  11  patients  after  a 
median  of  4  weeks  (range  1-12  weeks).  One  of  the  ten  patients  had  a  transient  response  that  lasted 
several weeks and did not respond to increasing doses of imatinib. The median duration of response in 
the remaining nine patients was 7 months (range 3-15 months). Analysis of patient DNA for activating 
mutations in known targets of imatinib (PDGFRα, PDGFβ, c-Kit) indicated the presence of a deletion 
on 4q12 with a breakpoint near PDGFRα. This deletion left behind fragments of two genes, FIP1L1 
and  PDGFRα,  which  fused  to  form  a  novel  gene,  FIP1L1-PDGFRα,  which  has  constitutively  active 
tyrosine kinase analogous to the imatinib sensitive Bcr-Abl enzyme. 
Cortes, et al (2003)
  reported  the  results  of  imatinib  treatment  in  9  patients  with  HES.  All  patients 
had  received  prior  therapy  with  no  or  limited  success  including,  but  not  limited  to,  steroids, 
hydroxyurea, interferon-α and/or chemotherapy. All patients were symptomatic at the start of imatinib 
therapy.  All  patients  had  normal  karyotypes,  and  no  patient  had  the  Bcr-Abl  rearrangement.  Four 
patients achieved CR. All 4 responders were men. All patients in the series were treated with imatinib 
at  100 mg/day,  although  in  one  patient  the  dose  was  increased  to  400 mg/day  before  the  response 
could be confirmed. 
Ishii, et al (2003)
  reported  one  41-year-old  male  patient  diagnosed  with  HES  and  myelofibrosis 
based  on  bone  marrow  biopsy  and  bronchoalveolar  lavage  (32%  eosinophils).  He  was  treated  with 
prednisolone,  interferon-α,  hydroxyurea  and  cyclosporine  A  without  significant  efficacy  for  his 
eosinophilia  and  complained  of  asthma-like  respiratory  symptoms.  He  was  started  on  imatinib  at 
100 mg/day; after 7 days, absolute Eo count fell to within the normal range and asthma-like symptoms 
disappeared completely. Imatinib was administered for 7 days at 100 mg/day and then maintained at 
100 mg  twice  weekly.  At  the  time  of  the  publication,  no  eosinophilia  was  noted,  and  there  were  no 
notable adverse events. 
Klion, et al (2004) 
  analyzed  responses  in  seven  HES  patients  treated  with  imatinib  at  300  to 
400 mg/day. All seven patients had elevated serum tryptase levels and the FIP1L1-PDGFRα mutation 
in  RNA  from  peripheral  blood  cells.  All  seven  patients  responded  to  imatinib.  1  mo  of  imatinib 
administration, a rapid and dramatic decrease in Eo was found as well as complete resolution of Eo-
related  signs,  except  for  cardiac  involvement.  The  lack  of  reversal  of  cardiac  abnormalities  and 
persistence  of  the  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  mutation  in  one  patient  suggests  that  early  intervention  with 
higher doses than the administered (300-400 mg/day) of imatinib may be desirable in the treatment of 
patients with MP-HES. Abnormalities in laboratory test results, including anemia, thrombocytopenia, 
and elevated serum tryptase and B12 levels resolved in all seven patients. There was also a reversal of 
BM  abnormalities  as  well  as  a  reduction  in  aberrant  and  activated  mast  cells  and  activated  Eo.  The 
authors concluded that elevated serum tryptase is a sensitive marker of a myeloproliferative variant of 
HES characterized by tissue fibrosis, poor prognosis, and imatinib responsiveness. 
Koury, et al (2003)
  reported  a  case  where  HES  was  coexisting  with  a  rare  skin  disease, 
lymphomatoid papulosis, characterized by multiple transient papular eruptions due to focal dermal T-
cell  infiltration  who  had  failed  treatment  with  hydroxyurea  for  HES  and  methotrexate,  psoralen-
ultraviolet A light for the skin disorder, presented with severe dyspnea and biventricular heart failure. 
Serum IL-5 levels were markedly elevated. Imatinib was given at the dose of 400 mg/day for 2 weeks, 
200 mg/day  for  7  months,  and  100 mg/day  for  11  months.  Eo  counts  and  skin  lesions  disappeared 
within a week, serum IL-5 rapidly declined and normalized in 5 weeks; hydroxyurea was discontinued 
12 
in 2 weeks and prednisone reduced in the course of 6 months. At 6 months, cardiac status improved 
dramatically and at 18 months the patient was active. The authors concluded that an unidentified TK 
in the intracellular pathways of IL-5 production or IL-5 receptor signaling is the target for imatinib and 
that imatinib should be considered for all patients with HES or lymphomatoid papulosis. 
Pardanani, et al (2003)
 treated five HES patients (all male, median age 46 years) and 2 with the very 
rare  eosinophilia-associated  chronic  myeloid  disorder  (Eos-CMD)  (both  male,  aged  45  and  58).  All 
patients had failed previous treatments including but not limited to prednisone. At a median follow-up 
of  17  weeks  (range  10-33 weeks), two HES  and one  eos-CMD  patient achieved CHR and one HES 
achieved PR. 
Pottier, et al (2003)
  published  a  case  report  of  a  32-year-old  male  who  had  hypereosinophilia 
associated with cutaneous mastocytosis. The patient failed interferon-α and hydroxyurea therapy, but 
responded  completely  to  imatinib  400 mg/day  within  three  weeks  of  initiation.  The  urticaria 
pigmentosa lesions persisted. The patient was still on therapy after six months. 
Salem, et al (2003)
  reported  six  patients  with  idiopathic  HES.  All  patients  had  received  prior 
therapies including but  not limited to  corticosteroids alone  (n=2) or in association with hydroxyurea 
(n=2)  or with hydroxyurea, interferon-α and  cytarabine  (n=2). All patients achieved  partial response 
with these initial therapies. Five patients had normal karyotypes and one showed trisomy 8. RT-PCR 
was  negative  for  ETV6-PDGFRB  and  Bcr-Abl  fusion  mRNAs.  All  patients  rapidly  achieved  CHR 
when treated daily with imatinib at 100 mg. 
Ascione, et al (2004)
  reported  the  case  of  a  33-year-old  man  with  HES  and  with  cardiac 
involvement  (acute  coronary  syndrome).  A  treatment  with  imatinib  at  400 mg/day  and  warfarin  was 
initiated.  After  four  months,  the  WBC  showed  Eo  count  decreased  to  normal  levels  and  an  ECG 
revealed normal sinus rhythm without ST segment modifications. 
Frickhofen, et al (2004)
  reported  a  33-year-old  man  in  whom  a  diagnosis  of  hypereosinophilic 
syndrome was made. Treatment with azathioprine and prednisone was started, the patient’s condition 
improved.  However,  laboratory  evaluations  confirmed  eosinophilia  with  counts  varying  between 
1.5x109/L (during treatment with azathioprine) and 8.4x109/L (after discontinuation of azathioprine). 
Cytogenetic analysis revealed a normal karyotype. The patient was started on imatinib at 200 mg/day. 
Within two weeks, Eo count decreased to normal levels and remained there with continued imatinib 
treatment. At the time of the report, the patient was feeling well without any adverse events. 
Malagola, et al (2004)
 reported the case of a 47-year-old male diagnosed with chronic eosinophilic 
leukemia  (CEL).  His  karyotype  was  normal.  No  Bcr-Abl  rearrangement  was  found,  but  FIP1L1-
PDGFRα  rearrangement  was  detected.  Treatment  with  imatinib  was  begun  on  a  dose-escalation 
regimen: 100 mg/day for the first week with weekly dose increases of 100 mg/day up to a maximum 
dose  of  400 mg/day.  Seven  days  after  start  of  treatment,  the  WBC  and  eosinophil  counts  were 
dramatically reduced  and  maintained constantly within  normal ranges over 120 days of  observation. 
Molecular response was documented 80 days after the start of the treatment. 
Martinelli, et al (2004)
 reported the case of a 65-year-old man presenting with idiopathic HES. RT-
PCR analysis detected the FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion gene but no Bcr-Abl, FGFR1-Bcr or PDGFRα-Tel 
rearrangement.  The  patient  was  started  on  imatinib  at  600 mg/day;  after  21  days,  the  white  cell  and 
eosinophils  counts  fell  dramatically  and  have  remained  normal  over  17  months  of  continuing 
treatment. 
Musto, et al (2004)
  observed  a  t(2:4)(p24:q12)  reciprocal  translocation  in  a  64-year-old  male 
affected by HES with complete clinical response, CHR and CCR to imatinib (100 mg/day) sustained 
for 10 months of follow-up. Cytogenic and FISH analyses suggested a different molecular abnormality 
than  the  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  rearrangement.  The  authors  described  that  while  the  patient  with  t(2:4) 
achieved  impressive  durable  response  with  100 mg/day  imatinib,  for  the  other  three  patients  400  to 
800 mg/day imatinib was necessary to achieve response.. 
Payne, et al (2004)
  reported  2  clinical  cases  of  HES  refractory  to  standard  therapy  in  two  male 
patients with organ involvement. Both were treated with imatinib. In one patient, a 29-year-old man 
with  normal  cytogenetics, treatment  with imatinib at 1400 mg/day  produced  resolution  of  symptoms 
and peripheral blood count within 6 days. The patient had maintained normal blood count s and was 
13 
symptom free more than one year after start of treatment. The second patient, a 20-year-old man also 
with normal cytogenetics, failed to respond to imatinib even at a maximum dose of 400 mg/day. 
Rose, et al (2004)
  reported  the  case  of  a  leukemic  form  of  HES  refractory  to  intensive  treatment 
(including  hydroxyurea,  prednisone,  interferon-α,  cytarabine,  thiotepa,  etoposide  and  allograft)  in 
whom sustained clinical  and  molecular response was induced by 200 mg/day imatinib. The 29-year-
old male patient in poor clinical status achieved CCR after only 15 days of treatment with imatinib and 
the response persisted 1 year later. 
Rotoli, et al (2004)
  treated  a  37-year-old  male  affected  by  Loeffler's  endocarditis  with  imatinib. 
Cytogenetics, FISH and molecular analyses showed the presence of the FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion gene. 
Standard  echocardiography  revealed  a  large  infiltration  of  the  apical  region,  with  apparently 
pedunculate  corpora  floating  in  the  LV  chamber.  Treatment  with  low  dose  imatinib  (initially 
200 mg/day  reduced  to  100 mg/day  after  2  weeks)  caused  rapid  regression  of  both  eosinophilic 
proliferation and endomyocardiopathy. The CHR and reversion of the cardiac damage were sustained 
for  17  months  at  the  time  of  the  report.  The  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  fusion  gene  was  found  significantly 
decreased  after  a  few  months  of  treatment.  Using  a  contrast  echocardiographic  approach,  we 
demonstrated the non-thrombotic origin of the “in-plus” image in our patient and its rapid resolution 
following imatinib treatment.  
Smith, et al (2004)
 describe 3 patients with HES with cytogenetic abnormalities (FIP1L1-PDGFRA 
fusion in two patients, t(5:12)(q33:p13) translocation in a third patient). The two first patients (46- and 
52-year-old  men)  were  given  imatinib  at  400 mg/day  and  both  presented  rapid  normalization  of 
eosinophils  counts;  at  the  time  of  the  publication,  they  had  remained  clear  for  8  months  with  no 
apparent  adverse  effects  from  the  drug.  The  third  patient,  a  56-year-old  man,  was  given  imatinib  at 
600 mg/day; initial rapid resolution of eosinophilia was observed; however, after 4 months of imatinib 
therapy the patient experienced blast crisis. 
Tan, et al (2004)
  describe  a  32-year-old  male  with  HES  and  significant  end  organ  damage  who 
remained refractory to conventional therapy (hydroxyurea). No clonal karyotypic abnormalities were 
observed. The patient was started on imatinib 100 mg/day. The patient achieved CHR without any side 
effects reported. 
Vandenberghe, et al (2004
)  retrospectively  characterized  17  patients  fulfilling  WHO  criteria  for 
IHES or CEL, using RT-PCR and FISH. Eight patients had FIP1L1-PDGFRα positive CEL, three had 
FIP1L1-PDGFRα  negative  CEL  and  six  had  IHES.  Four  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  positive  patients  were 
treated at an initial dose of 100 mg/day of imatinib. In all four treated patients, including one female, 
imatinib induced rapid and complete hematological response with normalization of the peripheral Eo 
count. Nevertheless, no clear improvement of the eosinophilic endomyocardial disease was observed 
in the three patients presenting with cardiac involvement, and one of these patients died from cardiac 
failure a few weeks later. The presence of FIP1L1-PDGFRα mRNA was analyzed in the blood of the 
three  surviving  patients  under  treatment:  the  fusion  became  undetectable  by  nested  PCR  in  two 
patients  and  remained  so  during  4  months  of  follow-up.  The  third  sample  from  the  female  patient 
remained  positive. In the IHES group of patients, only one  patient was  treated with imatinib,  which 
was rapidly abandoned for intolerance without evidence of response. 
Wolf, et al (2004)
 describe a 47-year-old man with a HES, diagnosed 20 years ago. The patient was 
admitted due to insufficient therapeutic response to hydroxyurea: in general, he felt well, but reported 
increasing  neurological  problems,  such  as  ataxia,  memory  deficits  and  dysarthria.  No  insertional 
deletion 4q12 with  concomitant fusion of  the  FIP1L1  to the PDGFRα locus  was  detected. Magnetic 
resonance  imaging  (MRI)  indicated  a  granulomatous  vasculitis,  most  likely  due  to  the  hematologic 
malignancy.  Despite  negativity  for  the  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  fusion  gene,  therapy  was  started  with 
100 mg/day imatinib. This led to a rapid normalization of eosinophilic granulocytes in the peripheral 
blood as well as in the bone marrow. Partial cytogenic remission was achieved at 6 months; CR at 17 
months,  confirmed  at  21  months.  Due  to  the  good  response  at  9  months  the  dose  of  imatinib  was 
reduced to 100 mg once weekly, which was subsequently increased at 18 months to 100 mg/day. This 
led to a rapid normalization of eosinophilic granulocytes in the peripheral blood as well as in the bone 
marrow. In addition, the neurological symptoms substantially improved.

Anghel, et al (2005)
 describe the case of  a young  male  patient with a  six year  history  of HES  and 
severe  heart  involvement  who,  after  unsuccessful  treatment  attempts  with  steroids,  hydroxyurea  and 
interferon-α, had a prompt, clinical and hematological complete remission following administration of 
imatinib.  As  his  cardiac  function  also  markedly  improved,  he  was  considered  for  heart  transplant. 
However, seven years after the onset of the disease and four months after the termination of imatinib 
treatment  the  patient  died  of  a  cerebral  hemorrhage  that  occurred  during  an  episode  of  acute 
respiratory sepsis. 
Cervetti, et al (2005)
 reported on one case of HES treated with imatinib. The case concerned a 61-
year-old  male  presenting  HES  and  hepatomegaly  who  was  treated  with  interferon-α  for  5  years, 
obtaining normalization of peripheral blood count with unmodified hepatomegaly. Due to neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, and massive liver and spleen enlargement with appearance of ascites, the treatment 
was  stopped  and  imatinib  at  100 mg/day  was  initiated.  Three  months  after  beginning  the  treatment, 
hematological toxicity resolved and the patient showed significant improvement of hepatomegaly with 
complete  resolution  of  ascites.  The  presence  of  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  rearrangement  was  retrospectively 
tested on bone marrow samples harvested from the patient at diagnosis and after 12 months of imatinib 
therapy. The first sample tested positive, whilst the second did not show the FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion 
gene. 
Imashuku, et al (2005)
 A  26-year-old  man with  HES was treated with imatinib following  a  5  year 
history  of  prednisolone  therapy.  The  patient  had  hypereosinophilia  (absolute  eosinophil  count 
>1500/µL) occurring in cyclic oscillations as well as histologically diagnosed eosinophilic vasculitis, 
bursitis, and periodic soft-tissue swellings. Laboratory data revealed high levels of serum tryptase and 
increased numbers of  mast cells  in the bone  marrow, but  serum interleukin-5  levels  were  within the 
normal  range.  The  disease  initially  responded  well  to  100 mg/day  of  imatinib  but  recurred  8  weeks 
later. Thereafter, a 200 mg/day dose was temporarily  effective. Despite the response to imatinib, the 
FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion gene was not detected by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. 
Additional  molecular  and  cytogenetic  studies  showed  neither  translocations  of  PDGFR  genes  nor 
mutations in the c-KIT or the PDGFR genes.  
La Starza, et al (2005)
 reported on a multicentric study that included 20 patients fulfilling the WHO 
criteria for HES and 6  patients without signs or symptoms of end-organ involvement. Ten of the 26 
patients  presented  the  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  gene.  Seven  of  these  10  patients  received  imatinib  therapy 
with the peripheral Eo count normalizing within 2-4 weeks. In three patients, interphase FISH and RT-
PCR demonstrated cytogenetic and molecular remission during therapy. Five of the FIP1L1-PDGFRα 
negative  patients  also  received  imatinib  therapy.  Two  of  these  patients  achieved  hematologic 
remission with peripheral Eo count normalization. 
Musial, et al (2005)
  reported  a  41-year-old  man  diagnosed  with  HES  with  cardiac  involvement. 
Genetic  analysis  revealed  a  FIP1L1-PDGFRA  fusion  gene.  The  patient  was  unresponsive  to 
interferon-α  therapy.  He  was  started  on  imatinib  at  100 mg/day  for  the  first  3  months  and  then 
continued  treatment  at  100 mg  every  second  day.  Full  hematological  and  molecular  remission  was 
accompanied by spectacular improvement in cardiac function. 
Onitilo, et al (2005)
 reported a 50-year-old male patient with HES with trisomy 8 who experienced a 
complete  and  durable  hematological  and  cytogenetic  remission  with  low-dose  imatinib  therapy 
(100 mg/day).  He  also  had  a  significant  reversal  of  cardiac  dysfunction  with  a  reduction  in  cardiac 
hypertrophy, resolution of pericardial effusion and mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. He remained in 
remission 3 years after therapy. 
Roche-Lestienne, et al (2005)
  performed  molecular  characterization  of  HES  in  35  patients  with 
normal  karyotypes  by  conventional  cytogenetic  analysis.  TCRγ  gene  rearrangements  suggesting  T 
clonality  were  seen  in  11  patients  (31%),  and  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  by  RT-PCR  in  six  of  35  patients 
(17%), who showed no evidence of T-cell clonality. An elevated serum tryptase level was observed in 
FIP1L1-PDGFRα-positive  patients  responding  to  imatinib,  whereas  serum  IL-5  levels  were  not 
elevated  in  T-cell  associated  hypereosinophilia.  Sequencing  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  revealed  scattered 
breakpoints in FIP1L1-exons (10-13), whereas breakpoints were restricted to exon 12 of PDGFRα. In 
the 29 patients without FIP1L1-PDGFRα, no activating mutation of PDGFRα/PDGFRβ was detected; 
however; one patient responded to imatinib. FISH analysis of the 4q12 deletion was concordant with 
15 
FIP1L1-PDGFRα RT-PCR data. Further investigation of the nature of FIP1L1-PDGFRα affected cells 
will  improve  the  classification  of  HES.  Nine  patients  were  treated  with  imatinib  (100-200 mg/day), 
seven males, two females, and five of the male HES patients achieved sustained CR. 
Chung, et al (2006)
 reported a case of persistent cough associated with gastro-esophageal reflux and 
hypereosinophilia.  Treatment  with  proton  pump  inhibitors  and  fundoplication  did  not  control  the 
cough.  However,  high  dose  prednisolone,  but  not  inhaled  corticosteroids,  did.  The  presence  of  the 
FIP1L1-PDGFRA  fusion  gene  in  myeloid  cells  was  confirmed  by  fluorescence  in  situ  hybridization 
analysis  using  CHIC2  deletion  as  a  surrogate  marker.  The  cough  and  other  disease  features  were 
subsequently suppressed by imatinib at the dose of 100 mg/day. This 54 year old male scientist is the 
first  case  of  persistent  cough  caused  by  HES  characterized  by  FIP1L1-PDGFRA  fusion  gene  and 
aberrant tyrosine kinase activity. 
Mueller, et al (2006)
 The authors summarize recent knowledge of clinical features, pathophysiology 
and novel treatment aspects of HES by performing a comprehensive search of the available literature 
and report on 94 patients. The Authors particularly address the issue of organ involvement and specific 
characteristics  of  the  variable  clinical  pictures.  In  addition,  two  cases  are  presented,  which  illustrate 
typical clinical scenarios and treatment outcome. 
Martinelli, et al (2006)
  treated  59  HES  patients  (age  range  18-78)  with  imatinib.  Fifty  patients 
received  100 mg/day  increasing  by  100 mg/day  at  weekly  intervals  to  reach  the  planned  dose  of 
400 mg/day; the imatinib dose was subsequently reduced to 200-300 mg/day in 5 of these patients and 
maintained at that level due to AEs. Of the remaining nine  patients, one patient discontinued  before 
reaching the full dose due to rapid progression and one patient discontinued during dose escalation due 
to renal failure. One HIV positive patient remained on low dose to prevent possible pharmacological 
interaction with antiviral therapies. Four patients remained at 100 mg/day per investigator’s decision 
due to concomitant morbidity. The two remaining patients received an unknown dose of imatinib. All 
patients  were  studied  by  molecular  analysis  for  expression  of  FIP1L1-PDGFRα,  Tel-PDGFRβ, 
FGFR1-Bcr and Bcr-Abl chimerical transcripts.  
Rapid, hematological CR was recorded after one month of therapy in all 23 (39%) FIP1L1-PDGFRα 
positive  patients.  In  36  patients  negative  for  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  rearrangement,  9  (25%)  experienced 
PR  and  3  CR  (PR+CR  33%).  Furthermore,  a  molecular  complete  remission  (defined  as  the 
disappearance  of  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  at  qualitative  RT-PCR  evaluation)  was  also  recorded  in  20 
FIP1L1-PDGFRα  positive  patients  after  3  months  of  therapy.  The  median  follow  up  was  4  months 
(range  2-39).  The  authors  concluded  this  study  supports  the  use  of  imatinib  as  first  line  therapy  in 
FIP1L1-PDGFRα positive HES patients. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
A  Bayesian  [Meta-analysis Report]  of  efficacy  data  from  published  papers  was  performed  and 
compared with the [Study B2225] efficacy data to examine the effect of potential publication bias in 
the published reports.  
This  report  cannot  rule  out  the  existence  of  publication  bias,  as  the  observed  response  rate  (i.e. 
complete plus partial responses) in [Study B2225] of 28.6% does not fall within the pooled posterior 
response rate confidence interval for literature reported patients with HES treated with imatinib, which 
is [74.2%,94.3%]. The posterior median response rate in the meta-analysis for the published literature 
is  of  83.5%.  The  discrepancy  between  the  two  could  be  explained  by  the  small  sample  size  of  the 
[Study B2225] HES patient population compared to the pooled sample size of the published literature 
(0.14 ratio between the two). Furthermore, this discrepancy could also be attributed to the fact that six 
out of 14 patients within the [Study B2225] HES population had a best overall response of Unknown, 
as they did not have a sufficient number of  meaningful tumor assessments in  order to be assigned a 
best  overall  response  different  from  Unknown  according  to  the  SWOG  criteria.  Of  note,  the 
publication  cut-off  date  for  the  literature  in  the  [Meta-analysis Report]  was  14-Oct-2005  and  only 
patients  with  HES  were  included,  which  explains  the  difference  in  the  number  of  published  cases 
included in the [Meta-analysis Report] compared to the present application.

Discussion on clinical efficacy 
 The reported benefit of reported responses in the whole population from [Study B2225] and published 
literature, can be summarized as follow: 
•  A complete reported response rate of 107/176 or 61% 
•  An overall reported response rate of 123/176 or 70% (complete and partial responses) 
•  A reported response to imatinib that was often durable 
If the evaluation is categorized by patients demonstrating known cytogenetic abnormalities associated 
with imatinib sensitivity, the benefit is higher: 
•  All 61 patients (100%) with known FIP1L1-PDGFRα fusion kinase achieved a hematological 
complete response. 
•  Sixty-two  of  115  patients  (54%)  with  no  or  unknown  cytogenetic  abnormality  achieved  a 
hematological response, either complete (46 patients) or partial (16 patients). 
Many patients reported improvement in HES related organ dysfunction with imatinib therapy.  
The  MAH  has  provided  additional  evidence  from  publications  concerning  162  HES/CES  patients. 
Although these case reports and case series are a source of heterogeneous and incomplete information, 
they are a very relevant part of the evidence. 
In  accordance  with  the  description,  the  population  treated  with  imatinib  seems  to  have  an  advanced 
stage  of  HES-CEL,  as  many  of  the  patients  suffered  organ  damage  and  had  received  previous 
treatments without satisfactory results.  
Regarding efficacy, there is a high rate of haematological response (83.5%), mainly complete (66%). 
The responses were rapid and more convincing in FIP1L1-PDGFRa positive patients (100% complete 
remissions).  The  duration  of  the  responses  is  heterogeneous  with  median  durations  of  about  7-8 
months but wide ranges (3-more than 15 months). Some of the patients have responses lasting more 
than  1  year.  Of  relevance,  a  consistent  number  of  patients  obtained  cytogenetic  and  molecular 
response,  mainly  in  FIP1L1-PDGFRa  patients.  There  are  also  some  reports  of  improvements  in 
symptoms and organ dysfunction. So, in accordance to these findings, imatinib has convincing activity 
in certain HES-CES patients who carry the FIP1L1-PDGFRa gene. 
 Clinical safety 
The  application  for  this  new  indication  is  based  on  study  B2225,  which  included  185  patients  with 
various  malignancies  possibly  associated  with  imatinib-sensitive  kinases  (45  of  them  suffered  a 
haematological  malignancy,  out  of  which  14  patients  were  classified  as  presenting  HES-CEL). 
Additional  evidence  in  35  published  articles  with  162  additional  patients,  have  been  presented  to 
support this indication. 
Because of the nature  of  the  reports (clinical  study involving  multiple diseases  vs. case reports)  and 
the  well  established  safety  profile  of  imatinib  in  myeloid  haematological  malignancies  and  solid 
tumours, for Study B2225 the safety of the whole population of 185 patients enrolled is considered, as 
well as the safety of the 14 patients with HES enrolled in the study.  The case reports are discussed 
with special attention to any event not consistent with the known imatinib safety profile. 
Safety  was  assessed  by  collecting  reports  of  deaths,  SAEs  and  AEs,  laboratory  data  (standard 
haematology,  biochemistry  and  urinalysis)  and  data  on  vital  signs,  weight,  ECG  and  physical 
examinations.  Safety  variables  consisted  of  AEs  related  or  not  to  study  drugs  and  of  laboratory 
parameters, classified according to NCI common toxicity criteria. 
Patient exposure 
A  total  of  185  patients  suffering  from  different  diseases  associated  with  ABL,  Kit  or  PDGFR  PTK 
were  treated  with  imatinib  in  study  B2225  at  doses  between  200  and  1000  mg  daily.  Twenty-five 
patients were treated for more than 1 year and seven patients for more than 2 years. Patient exposure is 
summarised in the following table.

Demographic characteristics regarding exposure: 
In the overall study population, according to gender there were 56.8% male and 43.2% female; 94.6 
%, of patient were Caucasian,  and they were mainly aged <65 years. (82.2 %), and only 17.8 % were 
over  65  years  (range:  15-86).  Most  patients  with  haematological  malignancies  had  been  diagnosed 
within the preceding 12 months whereas most of the patients with solid tumours had been diagnosed 
more than 1 year before being recruited into the study. 
In the HES patients, 11 out of 14 were males, 12 of them were Caucasian and there were no patients 
aged 65 years old or more, while all of them were between 16 and 64 years. There is no individualized 
information about history of malignancy in the HES group.  
The applicant highlights that most of the information related to disease characteristics is missing for 
the haematology group, and therefore no conclusions can be reached.

Adverse events 
Pooling of data was not performed with results of other studies. All patients exposed to more than 1 
dose of study treatment were pooled to examine the incidence rate of deaths and SAEs, the affected 
body systems, type of underlying event and suspected drug relatedness. 
All  patients,  both  in  the  haematology  and  in  the  solid  tumour  group,  experienced  at  least  one  AE. 
Overall, the most frequently reported AEs in both tumor groups affected the gastrointestinal system, 
general  and  administration  site  disorders  or  skin,  musculoskeletal,  respiratory  or  nervous  system 
disorders. Patients with haematological malignancies had a higher frequency of skin disorders (68.9% 
vs. 57.1%), blood disorders (48.9% vs. 24.3%) and cardiac disorders (11.1% vs. 6.4%) than patients

with solid tumours and a lower frequency of general disorders (62.2% vs. 80.7%), of  metabolic  and 
nutrition disorders (24.4% vs. 42.1%) and of eye disorders (13.3% vs. 26.4%).  
All  HES  patients  experienced  at  least  one  AE,  the  AE  profile  was  consistent  with  the  one  of  the 
overall  group,  the  most  commonly  affected  system  organ  classes  being  the  gastrointestinal  system, 
cutaneous disorders, and musculoskeletal disorders. 
The most frequently occurring adverse events in patients with HES were nausea in 9 cases, followed 
by diarrhea and muscle cramps in 7 cases each and then by periorbital edema and vomiting (4 cases 
each). All other AEs occurred in three patients or less. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
There  were  23  deaths  (12.4%)  reported  in  the  overall  population  enrolled  in  study  B2225  during 
treatment  or  up  to  28  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  medication.  None  of  these  deaths  were 
considered to be related to study drug. No patient with HES died on study. 
A total of 79 patients (42.7%) experienced at least one SAE, the most frequent being gastrointestinal 
(27 patients – 14.6%) or respiratory (26 patients – 14.1%). Although many of the AEs were mild to 
moderate  in  severity,  a  total  of  82  patients  (44.3%),  61  in  the  solid  tumor  group  and  21  in  the 
hematology group, experienced CTC grade 3 AEs by any cause and a total of 33 patients (17.8%), 27 
with  solid  tumours  and  6  with  haematological  malignancies,  experienced  CTC  grade  4  AEs  by  any 
cause. The majority of these AEs were related to the underlying conditions; drug-related CTC grade 3 
AEs  were  reported  in  a  total  of  54  patients  (29.2%),  40  patients  with  solid  tumours  and  14  with 
haematological malignancies, and drug-related CTC grade 4 AEs were reported in 7 patients (3.8%), 5 
with solid tumours and 2 with haematological malignancies.  
Two HES patients experienced  three  drug-related SAEs: patient  [701/111] presented  a CTC grade 3 
acute renal insufficiency from Day 14 to Day 22 and a CTC grade 3 edema from Day 28 to Day 33, 
both  of  which  resulted  in  hospitalization  as  seen  in  [Study B2225−PTL 10.2-1].  Patient  [901/152] 
experienced CTC grade 3 decreased sperm count on Day 362 which did not lead to further action.  
Three  additional  HES  patients  experienced  non-related,  non-fatal  SAEs:  patient  [201/093]  had  CTC 
grade 3 ascites which resolved in two days with non-drug therapy; patient [201/147] had a CTC grade 
3 chest infection from Day 7 to Day 20 which led to hospitalization and administration of concomitant 
medication; he was again hospitalized on Day 24 due to the following SAEs: CTC grade 2 sweating 
which  resolved  after  one  day,  CTC  grade  2  endomyocardial  fibrosis,  ischemic  lesions  in  cerebral 
hemispheres, diarrhea and dizziness and CTC grade 1 nausea, which led to permanent discontinuation 
of the study treatment. Patient [701/171] had a CTC grade 2 cerebral ischemia from Day 89 to Day 93 
which led to hospitalization and the use of concomitant medication. 
Analysis by organ system or syndrome 
Cardiovascular system 
In  the  overall  population  of  185,  four  patients  experienced  drug-related  vascular  events  (2.2%),  all 
CTC grade 1 in severity. Cardiac disorders were considered SAEs in four cases (2.2%).  
Two HES patients presented two cardiovascular SAEs which were not considered study drug-related: 
patient  [201/147]  presented  a  CTC  grade  2  restrictive  cardiomyopathy  which  led  to  study  drug 
discontinuation, and patient [701/171] presented transient CTC grade 3 peripheral ischemia which led 
to hospitalization and administration of concomitant medication. 
Renal and urogenital system 
A total of three patients (1.6%) experienced AES that were considered drug-related, and in two cases 
(1.0%)  were  of  CTC  grade  3  or  4  severity.  In  one  case  treatment  was  withdrawn  because  of  drug-
related CTC grade 3 creatinine increase.  
HES patient [701/111] presented an SAE of CTC grade 3 acute renal failure which was suspected of 
being  study  drug-related  and  led  to  hospitalization,  study  drug  interruption  and  administration  of 
concomitant medication. This SAE resolved after 9 days. 
19 
 
Hepatic system 
Three patients (1.6%) were withdrawn from treatment because of elevated liver enzymes, considered 
drug-related in two cases.  No  SAE affecting the  hepatobiliary  system  was  reported.  No  patient  with 
HES presented hepatobiliary system disorders. 
Gastrointestinal system 
A  total  136  patients  (73.5%)  experienced  gastrointestinal  system  disorders  of  any  cause,  the  most 
frequently observed being nausea, diarrhoea and vomiting. Of those, 13 patients (7.0%) experienced 
grade 3 AEs and one patient grade 4 severity. A total of 27 patients experienced SAEs involving this 
system organ class. 
Twelve  patients  with  HES  presented  gastrointestinal  system  disorders,  of  which  three  were  SAEs: 
patient 201/093 presented a CTC grade 3 ascites, while patient 201/147 presented CTC grade 1 nausea 
and CTC grade 2 diarrhea, none of which were considered study drug-related. 
Nervous system 
A total of 37 patients (20.0%) experienced AEs that were considered drug-related; all grade 1 or 2 in 
severity.  
Six  HES  patients  presented  nervous  system  disorders,  two  of  which  were  non  drug-related  SAEs: 
patient [201/147] presented a CTC grade 2 cerebral ischemia that led to study drug discontinuation; it 
was accompanied by CTC grade 2 dizziness which resolved after one day. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Most of the haematological abnormalities were CTC grade 3, with only eight instances of CTC grade 
4  events  in  the  overall  population:  five  cases  of  neutropenia,  two  of  leukopenia  and  one  of 
thrombocytopenia.  As  expected,  most  of  these  CTC  grade  4  events  occurred  in  patients  with 
haematological  malignancies  (two  instances  of  neutropenia  and  one  each  of  thrombocytopenia  and 
leukopenia), with a frequency at least double of that seen in solid tumor patients, although the absolute 
frequency never exceeded 4.4% in the overall population.  
In  HES  patients,  the  worst  hematological  abnormalities  were  CTC  grade  3  in  severity.  Four  HES 
patients  presented  one  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorder  AE  each  (two  cases  of  anemia  and  one 
case each of neutropenia and thrombocytopenia), none of which were SAEs and none of which led to 
study drug discontinuation. 
Clinical chemistry 
Most of the chemistry abnormalities were CTC grade 3 with four instances of CTC grade 4 events in 
the overall population: two cases for creatinine (1%), one for alkaline phosphatase (0.5%) and one for 
AST (0.5%).  There  was no difference between the two main  populations of patients in frequency of 
events regardless of CTC grade, with the exception of creatinine increase, which was more severe in 
patients  with  solid  tumours  (two  CTC  grade  4  instances)  than  in  patients  with  haematological 
malignancies (two CTC grade 3 instances). 
In HES patients, there was one instance of CTC grade 3 albumin decrease and one instance of CTC 
grade 3 creatinine increase. No HES patient was withdrawn from the study due to abnormal laboratory 
values. 
Safety in special populations 
Women  of  child-bearing  potential  were  advised  to  avoid  becoming  pregnant  and  to  use  effective 
contraception during treatment (study B2225). No cases of pregnancies were reported, nor were there 
cases of partners of male patients becoming pregnant.

Postmarketing safety and other sources of data 
Since the international lauch date (May 2001), the Post marketing experience with imatinib has been 
reviewed  on  an  ongoing  basis  in  the  Periodic  Safety  Update  Reports  (PSUR)  and  the  US  Periodic 
Reports (USPR).  
Based upon cumulative reviews in the most recent PSUR version 6 (period 11 May 2004 to 10 May 
2005),  it  was  recommended  to  continue  to  monitor  the  following  events:  myocardial  infarction, 
cardiomegaly/  cardiomyopathy,  angina  pectoris,  thrombosis/embolism,  pulmonary  hypertension, 
hepatic  necrosis/cirrhosis,  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation,  glucose  metabolism  disorders, 
rhabdomyolysis, hemolytic anemia, suicide attempt, ideation and suicide. 
There  are  no  new  events  reported  from  Post  marketing  experience  which  have  not  already  been 
observed during clinical trials. No important targeted safety studies were identified. The safety profile 
of imatinib remains consistent with the information provided in the CDS of the product. 
In the ongoing trials recruiting patients with HES, six SAEs have been reported to Novartis to  date. 
Most  were  related  to  preexisting  conditions  or  concomitant  medications,  and  none  was  suspected  of 
being related to the study drug. 
Case reports 
Out  of  162  cases  of  HES/CEL  in  the  literature,  few  AEs  were  reported  by  the  authors. 
Schaller, et al (2001)
 reported that the patient they treated reported transient mild nausea on 100 mg 
daily imatinib, relieved with ondansetron. The patient then developed a constant mild headache, which 
disappeared with a dose reduction to 75 mg daily.  
Cortes, et al (2003)
  reported  one  patient  with  a  rash  consistent  with  exacerbation  of  preexisting 
psoriasis  and  who  was  taken  off  therapy  after  10  days.  Abdominal  cramps  and  nausea  developed  in 
one  patient,  necessitating  a  dose  reduction  from  100 mg  o.d.  to  100 mg  every  other  day;  all  other 
adverse events were grade 1 and consistent with previously reported toxicity with imatinib, including 
fluid retention (n = 2), diarrhea (n = 1), muscle cramps (n = 1), and nausea (n = 1).  
Pardanani, et al (2003)
  reported  a  patient  who  developed  mild  fatigue  when  imatinib  dose  was 
increased  from  100 mg  o.d.  to  400 mg  o.d.  and  another  patient  who  experienced  grade  3  fatigue  on 
100 mg o.d. imatinib and elected to stop imatinib after 4 weeks of treatment.  
Another  of  their  patients  developed  progressive  dyspnea  and  orthopnea  from  acute  left  ventricular 
dysfunction with cardiogenic shock, which required intravenous pressor support following 8 days of 
imatinib  therapy.  An  echocardiogram  revealed  new-onset  severe  generalized  left  ventricular  (LV) 
hypokinesis  (LV  ejection  fraction  decreased  from  71%  to  10%)  and  the  endomyocardial  biopsy 
confirmed  eosinophilic  infiltration  of  the  myocardium.  Placement  of  an  intraaortic  balloon  pump 
became necessary for hemodynamic support. The patient was started on high dose steroids with rapid 
improvement of  hemodynamic  parameters and  was  weaned of the pressors after 72  hours.  After LV 
function recovery (LV ejection fraction 55-60% at 4 weeks after imatinib discontinuation), the patient 
was rechallenged with imatinib at 100 mg/day. The patient tolerated imatinib retreatment well without 
recurrence of cardiac toxicity. 
Klion, et al (2004)
 reported one case of transient grade 3 neutropenia leading to interruption of the 
study drug followed by a dose reduction from 400 mg to 300 mg o.d., one case of grade 1 pedal and 
facial edema requiring no additional therapy, and one case of transient grade 2 myalgia resolved with 
ibuprofen. 
 Musto, et al (2004)
  reported  the  appearance  of  fatigue,  muscle  cramps,  and  diarrhea  in  a  patient 
treated  with  400 mg/day  imatinib;  a  dose  reduction  to  200 mg/day  led  to  the  return  of  symptoms  as 
well as that of the eosinophils count to baseline levels. The patient refused to be further treated. No 
further safety observations were reported for the other published case reports. 
Martinelli, et al (2006)
disorder, thrombocytopenia, muscle cramps, edema and anemia.  
  reported  common  adverse  events  including  neutropenia,  gastrointestinal 
21 
Grade 3 or 4 events were infrequent. Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia was noted in two (3.4%) patients, and 
grade  3  thrombocytopenia  in  one  patient  only  (1.7%).  Drug-related  adverse  events  led  to 
discontinuation of therapy in two patients. 
Out of 162 cases of HES/CEL reported in the literature, five deaths were reported on treatment with 
imatinib. Taking into consideration the level of detail provided, none appears attributable to imatinib.  
Ault, et al (2002)
three months after initiation of treatment with imatinib at 100 mg/day. 
 reported that their patient developed a fulminant pneumococcal sepsis and expired 
Cools, et al (2003)
complete remission, without further detail. 
  reported  that  one  patient  died  after  3  months  of  imatinib  treatment  while  in 
Klion, et al (2004)
  reported  that  a  patient  with  endomyocardial  fibrosis  in  whom  symptoms  and 
signs of congestive heart failure remained unaffected by imatinib therapy died 1 month after beginning 
imatinib  at  400 mg/day  from  disseminated  cytomegalovirus  infection  thought  to  be  a  result  of 
prolonged  high-dose  steroid  use.  At  autopsy,  extensive  endomyocardial  fibrosis  was  evident 
throughout the ventricular walls and interventricular septum. 
Vandenberghe, et al (2004)
 reported that one patient presenting with cardiac failure and thrombotic 
events  early  in  his  disease  course  died  from  cardiac  failure  a  few  weeks  after  starting  imatinib  at 
100 mg/day. 
Anghel et al (2005)
 reported that four months after the withdrawal of imatinib, while in good clinical 
and hematological remission, the patient died of a brain hemorrhage that occurred during an episode of 
acute respiratory sepsis. 
Discussion on safety  
In the original submission, it was reported that  caution must be exercised because of the occurrence of 
severe  thrombopenias  and/or  neutropenias  and  the  rare  occurrence  of  a  fluid  retention  syndrome. 
Transaminitis is also a known risk with imatinib. The data from this application confirm these risks, 
although  they  are  manageable  by either  reducing  the  dose  or  temporarily  suspending  treatment  with 
imatinib.  No  new  risk  questions  were  identified.  Isolated  cases  of  cardiogenic  shock/left  ventricular 
dysfunction  have  been  associated  with  the  initiation  of  imatinib  therapy  in  patients  with  HES  and 
cardiac  involvement  (Pardanani, et al 2003
.  The  condition  was  reported  to  be 
reversible with the administration of systemic steroids, circulatory support measures and temporarily 
holding of imatinib. Screening with echocardiograms and serum troponin levels should be considered 
in patients with HES. If either is abnormal, then the prophylactic use of systemic steroids (1-2 mg/kg) 
for  1  to  2  weeks  concomitant  with  imatinib  should  be  considered.  Therefore,  the  CDS  Section  4.4 
“Special warning and special precautions for use” has been updated accordingly. 
,  Pitini, et al 2003)
Benefit-Risk assessment 
The initially claimed indication was HES-CEL, which  include a very heterogeneous range of diseases, 
with  a  wide  spectrum  of  biological  and  clinical  situations,  including,  in  one  extreme,  patients  with 
moderate eosinophilia without organ dysfunction who do not need treatment and, in the other extreme, 
patients  with  cytogenetic  aberrations  and  aggressive  forms  of  the  disease  with  massive  organ 
infiltration and a dismal prognosis. For some of these subgroups, there are limited treatment options 
and  systemic  therapies,  mainly  corticosteroids,  are  not  satisfactory,  therefore,  new  treatments  are 
required.  
The  molecular  mechanism  underlying  the  FIP1L1-PDGFRa  fusion  gene  giving  rise  to  a  new 
constitutively  active  fusion  tyrosine  kinase  that  can  be  targeted  by  imatinib  makes  plausible  the 
biological and molecular basis for this treatment. However, this is not the case when such a molecular 
mechanism is not found or it is already unknown.  
The dossier presented to support the indication of Glivec for the treatment of adult patients with HES-
CEL  is  limited  to  a  phase  II,  uncontrolled,  open  label  study  (which  includes  14  patients  with  HES-
CEL) and 35 publications, including a total of 176 patients. 
22 
 
 
 
The  main  clinical  study  (B2225)  was  designed  as  a  proof  of  concept  trial,  so,  it  is  not  specifically 
designed for the investigation of imatinib in HES-CEL. It has several major problems of design and 
efficacy results are unclear. None of the 14 patients with HES-CEL had a complete response, and only 
4  of  them  showed  a  partial  response.  Due  to  the  missing  information,  neither  the  adequacy  of 
treatment nor the low response rate can be assessed adequately.   
In contrast to the clinical study B2225,  the  efficacy results found in  case-reports and case  series are 
positive, although this evidence can be influenced by publication bias. In particular, all patients with 
the  FIP1L1-PDGFRa  mutation  showed  complete  haematological  response.  Not  unexpectedly,  taking 
into  account  the  biological  background,  the  response  was  rapid  and  durable  with  some  reports  of 
cytogenetic and molecular responses that translate in improvement in organ damage. This is consistent 
with the previous experience with imatinib in other indications with similar biological rationale.  
Concerning imatinib safety profile in this disease, it did not differ substantially from that previously 
described  and  it  can  generally  be  considered  well  tolerated.  There  was  one  case  of  cardiac  adverse 
event  (acute  left  ventricular  dysfunction)  related  with  imatinib,  which  could  suggest  additional 
monitoring in this patient population. Until more information is available, a warning about the use of 
imatinib in HES/CEL has been included in the SPC. 
In accordance with these results, the CHMP requested additional information to clarify some clinical 
aspects and  SPC  information. The MAH response  document to the  day 120 CHMP list  of questions 
mainly consists on further justification that confirm the initial findings.  
For  efficacy,  more  detailed  information  about  patient  characteristics,  study  design  and  results  was 
requested. A new description of the results for FIP1L1-PDGFRa population has also been provided. 
A controversial point was the benefit/risk of imatinib therapy in patients without the FIP1L1-PDGFRa 
mutation. Although some patients have demonstrated a response, in general, these responses have been 
slower  and  have  required  higher  imatinib  doses  than  those  in  patients  with  FIP1L1-PDGFRa 
associated disease. The data submitted in this application are clearly insufficient and do not allow an 
adequate  assessment  of  the  effects  of  imatinib  when  the  presence  of  the  FIP1L1-PDGFRa  mutation 
has not been shown. 
Another  aspect  that  was  based  on  limited  investigations  is  the  optimum  dose  of  imatinib  for  this 
indication, as responses were obtained for various doses, but this has not been discussed relating the 
intensity and durability of response and the safety profile obtained with them. As the studies submitted 
used  imatinib  100  mg  or  400  mg  obtaining  positive  results,  the  proposal  to  use  imatinib  100  mg 
initially in the FIP1L1-PDGFRa population is acceptable.  
No long term data on the maintenance of the response and survival have been provided either.  
As the experience with imatinib is limited, further investigations of the use of imatinib in HES/CEL 
are recommended to better define its role. The company mentions more studies in this indication. For 
them, additional results, including molecular response, should be provided, if relevant. 
The  safety  profile  of  imatinib  in  HES-CEL  patients  seems  not  different  from  the  one  in  the  whole 
population of Study B2225, which included patients with various diagnoses. 
One  HES  patient  suffered  cardiogenic  shock/left  ventricular,  which  has  been  associated  with  the 
initiation of imatinib therapy. As HES may be associated with cardiac dysfunction, this adverse event 
could  occur  more  frequently.  The  Applicant  has  reflected  this  in  the  proposed  SPC,  which  it  is 
reasonable to grant safety. 
Case reports are focused on efficacy data and information related to safety is limited. There are few 
adverse  events  reported  in  HES-CEL  patients  obtained  from  publications  and  they  seem  consistent 
with previous experience. As the HES-CEL population can have previous cardiac problem, it is very 
reasonable  to  monitor  cardiac  safety  at  the  initiation  and  during  imatinib  treatment.  A  relevant  
warning has been introduced in the SPC. 
In conclusion, imatinib treatment was well tolerated by patients with HES-CEL. Its safety profile does 
not  seem  different  substantially  from  the  known  safety  profile  of  imatinib  observed  in  other  larger 
haematological malignancies populations, such as CML.  
23 
 
 
 
 
To summarize, efficacy and safety clinical results obtained with imatinib in the advanced HES/CEL 
FIP1L1-PDGFRα  mutation  population,  although  limited,  can  be  considered  positive.  Taking  into 
account  the  interest  of  having  adequate  treatments  in  this  patient  group  (the  current  treatment  with 
steroids  provides  symptomatic  improvement  associated  with  a  poor  safety  profile  in  the  long  term 
treatment) and also the mechanism of action, there is a solid rationale to support the interest of this use 
of imatinib as a therapy that can be more effective to control this disease. The marketing authorization 
holder  in  the  response  document  provides  additional  information,  which  is  acceptable  for  the 
Rapporteurs. The evidence presented can be considered sufficient to grant a new labelling. 
The  changes  proposed  for  the  SPC  (pending  minor  amendments)  reflect  adequately  the  comments 
made by the CHMP. 
In  the  light  of  the  above  discussion,  we  consider  that  an  indication  “Imatinib  is  indicated  in  the 
treatment  of  adult  patients  with  advanced  HES-CEL  with  FIP1L1-PDGFRα  rearrangement”  is 
acceptable.  
CONCLUSION 
-  On 18 October 2006 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on 
the amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
Follow-up measures undertaken by the Marketing Authorisation Holder  
As requested by the CHMP, the MAH agreed to submit the follow-up measures as listed below and to 
submit  any  variation  application  which  would  be  necessary  in  the  light  of  compliance  with  these 
commitments (see Letter of Undertaking attached to this report):

Description 
1. The results of the investigations planned or ongoing on the use of 
imatinib in patients with HES/CEL, including long term data on the 
maintenance of the response and survival should be submitted to the 
CHMP 
2.  There  are  currently  no  data  regarding  the  RT-PCR  number  of 
transcripts in HES/CEL patients.  
•  As  this  information  would  be  useful  to  assess  the  response  to 
imatinib, the collection of these data should be considered in clinical 
investigations.  
•  The molecular data requested should be submitted 
3.  The  dosage  proposals  for  HES/CEL  should  be  reviewed  when  more 
information, i.e. molecular response, duration of response, safety, etc., is 
available 
4. The cardiac safety profile of imatinib in HES/CEL patients should be 
reassessed when more experience in this patient population is available

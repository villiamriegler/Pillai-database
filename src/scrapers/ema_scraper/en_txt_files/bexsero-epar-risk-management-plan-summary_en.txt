Summary of risk management plan for Bexsero (Meningococcal group B 
vaccine, (rDNA, component, adsorbed) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Bexsero. The RMP details 
important risks of Bexsero, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about Bexsero 's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Bexsero 's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Bexsero should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Bexsero should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of Bexsero's 
RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Bexsero is authorised for invasive disease caused by N. meningitidis group B (see SmPC for 
the full indication). It contains three N. meningitidis recombinant proteins: NHBA (rp287-953), 
NadA (rp961c) and fHbp (rp936-741), formulated with OMV from N. meningitidis serogroup 
B strain NZ98/254, containing PorA P1.4 as the active substances and it is given by deep 
intramuscular injection. 
Further information about the evaluation of Bexsero’s benefits can be found in Bexsero’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: ‘Internet 
site’ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/002333/human_me
d_001614.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124’. 
II. 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or 
further characterise the risks 
Important risks of Bexsero, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Bexsero's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals; 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly; 
 
 
 
 
 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment - so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Bexsero is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Bexsero are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered.  
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for 
which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Bexsero. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Summary of important risks 
Important Potential Risk: Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS) 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients vaccinated with Bexsero are not known to be at increased 
risk of this event as a result of vaccination. Rather, this event is 
considered a potential risk with Bexsero because it has been 
observed with other vaccines, such as rabies and influenza vaccines 
as well as a quadrivalent meningococcal vaccine. 
Children and adults of all ages and both sexes. There is some 
evidence to suggest an increased occurrence with advancing age, 
though this is not established.

•  Children younger than 10 years of age. The occurrence in 
adulthood is unclear but less frequent than in childhood.

Routine risk minimisation measures: 
•  SmPC sections 4.3 (PL section 2) 
•  SmPC section 4.8 (PL section 4); 
•  SmPC section 4.4 where recommendation is given to healthcare 
professionals to have appropriate medical treatment readily 
available

Important Potential Risk: Vasculitis/Kawasaki syndrome 
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Patients vaccinated with Bexsero are not known to be at increased 
risk of this event as a result of vaccination. This event is considered a 
potential risk with Bexsero because a few subjects participating to the 
clinical trials reported this event after Bexsero. The few cases that 
occurred in the Bexsero studies do not allow a definitive conclusion 
whether Bexsero could eventually cause Kawasaki syndrome.

Fever is a common occurrence after vaccination. Febrile seizures are 
associated with any condition that results in fever, including 
vaccination, but most commonly occur with the fevers caused by 
typical childhood illnesses (e.g., acute otitis media, viral upper 
respiratory tract infections and roseola). 
The condition of a child being less developed mentally or physically 
than is normal for its age; discharge from a neonatal unit after 28 
days; day care attendance; viral infections; a family history of febrile 
seizures; certain vaccinations; and possibly iron and zinc deficiencies.

Patients vaccinated with Bexsero are not known to be at increased

considered a potential risk with Bexsero because it has been 
observed after Bexsero but it is unknown if Bexsero is the cause. 
Advancing age; gender (more common in women); genetic (specific 
genes are associated with a higher risk of certain types of arthritis, 
such as rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematous, and 
ankylosing spondylitis); family history or past history of arthritis; 
overweight and obesity; joint injuries and joint prosthesis; infections; 
smoking, intravenous drug abuse, alcoholism, diabetes; exposure to 
silica dust; dietary intake of vitamin D, antioxidants, fish, protein, and

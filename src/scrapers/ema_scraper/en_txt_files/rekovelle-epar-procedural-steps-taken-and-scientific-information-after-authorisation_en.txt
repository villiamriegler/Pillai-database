are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

the product information

This was an application for a group of variations.

SmPC and PL 
The BEYOND trial provided efficacy and safety information 
Grouped application comprising two type II 
variations as follows: 
- Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC to update the safety information following final 
results from study 000304 (BEYOND). This is a 
randomised, controlled, open label, parallel group, 
multicentre trial comparing the efficacy and safety of 
individualised FE 999049 (follitropin delta) dosing, 
using a long GnRH agonist protocol and a GnRH 
antagonist protocol in women undergoing controlled 
ovarian stimulation.  
 - Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC, including the 
tabulation of adverse drug reactions based on pooled 
safety data from studies ESTHER-1, ESTHER-2, 
000273, 000145, BEYOND and RAINBOW. 
The updated RMP version 8.0 has also been 
submitted. 
In addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update 
the list of local representatives in the Package 
Leaflet.

C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
about the use of follitropin delta (REKOVELLE) within a 
GnRH agonist protocol, as this was not studied at the time 
of the marketing authorisation application, but it is still 
used in clinical practice.  
Pooled data from BEYOND and other clinical trials did not 
identify new safety information. 
The subset of women with AMH ≥ 35 pmol/L have not been 
studied in a GnRH agonist protocol, as reflected in the 
updated section 5.1 of the SmPC.

Product Characteristics.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of 
PL 
Rekovelle in the approved indication remains favourable 
and therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

to determine the dose of follitropin delta, following 
an agreed recommendation. In consequence, RMP 
dose of follitropin delta, in addition to the currently 
mentioned immunoassay in the SmPC section 4.2.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant APEIRON Biologics AG submitted on 6 May 2015 an application for marketing authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Dinutuximab beta Apeiron, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 19 December 2013. 
Dinutuximab beta Apeiron was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/12/1062 on 8 November 
2012. Dinutuximab beta Apeiron was designated as an orphan medicinal product in the following 
indication:  treatment of neuroblastoma. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: 
“Dinutuximab beta Apeiron is indicated for the treatment of patients with neuroblastoma. 
90 % of patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma are below 5 years of age, with a median age at diagnosis 
of 22 months. Less than 10 % of the cases occur in patients being older than 10 years.” 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan Medicinal 
Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron as an orphan medicinal product 
in the approved indication. The outcome of the COMP review can be found on the Agency's 
website: ema.europa.eu/Find medicine/Human medicines/Rare disease designation. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated that 
dinutuximab beta was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-clinical 
and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0094/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0094/2014 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with the authorised 
orphan medicinal product Unituxin. However, following withdrawal of the marketing authorisation for 
Unituxin on 22 March 2017, it was considered unnecessary for the CHMP to conclude on possible similarity 
with Unituxin.

Derogation(s) from market exclusivity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
847/2000, the applicant submitted claims addressing the following derogations laid down in Article 8.3 of 
Regulation (EC) No 141/2000;  the holder of the marketing authorisation for the original orphan medicinal 
product is unable to supply sufficient quantities of the medicinal product and the applicant can establish 
in the application that the medicinal product, although similar to the already authorised orphan medicinal 
product Unituxin, is safer, more effective or otherwise clinically superior. However, following withdrawal 
of the marketing authorisation for Unituxin on 22 March 2017, it was considered unnecessary for the 
CHMP to conclude on the derogations claimed. 
Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance dinutuximab beta contained in the above medicinal product 
to be considered as a new active substance in comparison to dinutuximab previously authorised in the 
European Union as Unituxin, as the applicant claimed that dinutuximab beta is a biological substance that 
has a different manufacturing process and differs significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or 
efficacy from the already authorised active substance. 
Protocol Assistance 
The applicant received Protocol Assistance from the CHMP on 17 February 2011. The Protocol Assistance 
pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumour of the autonomic nervous system, meaning that the cell of origin 
is thought to be a developing and incompletely committed precursor cell derived from neural-crest 
tissues. Neuroblastomas generally occur in very young children; the median age at diagnosis is 17 
months.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumour of childhood. Its incidence is 10.2 cases per 
million children under 15 years of age and accounts for approximately 7% of paediatric malignancies in 
this age category; it is the most common cancer diagnosed during the first year of life (Modak 2007). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
The tumours arise in tissues of the sympathetic nervous system, typically in the adrenal medulla or 
paraspinal ganglia, and thus can present as mass lesions in the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The clinical presentation is highly variable, ranging from a mass that causes no symptoms to a primary 
tumour that causes critical illness as a result of local invasion, widely disseminated disease, or both. 
The diagnosis of neuroblastoma is based on the presence of characteristic histopathological features of 
tumour tissue or the presence of tumour cells in a bone marrow aspirate or biopsy accompanied by raised 
concentrations of urine catecholamines. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging are the 
preferred methods for the assessment of tumor in the abdomen, pelvis, mediastinum, or in paraspinal 
lesions, respectively. For enhanced detection of tumor, radiolabeled-metaiodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) 
scintigraphy is used. Other methods are used to detect minimal residual disease such as bone marrow 
aspirates and biopsy, pathological evaluation and polymerase-chain reaction-based techniques to identify 
GD2 synthase, tyrosine hydroxylase and protein gene product 9.5. 
For over a century, researchers have noted that neuroblastomas exhibit diverse and often dramatic 
clinical behaviours. On the one hand, neuroblastoma accounts for disproportionate morbidity and 
mortality among the cancers of childhood; on the other hand, it is associated with one of the highest 
proportions of spontaneous and complete regression of all human cancers. 
There have been substantial efforts to develop a risk-classification algorithm for patients with newly 
diagnosed neuroblastoma. Most cooperative groups use a system that combines the assessment of easily 
measured clinical variables, such as the patient’s age and the tumour stage, with specific biologic 
variables. The age at diagnosis is considered a surrogate for underlying biologic characteristics, in that 
younger patients are more likely to have tumours with biologic features that are associated with a benign

clinical course. To address this issue of classification, a new International Neuroblastoma Risk Group 
(INRG) classification system has been proposed in 2009 with four broad categories —very low risk, low 
risk, intermediate risk, and high risk — based on the assessment of the following prognostic factors: age 
at diagnosis (2 cut-offs, 12 and 18 months), INRG tumour stage (L1, L2, M, MS), histologic category, 
grade of tumour differentiation, DNA ploidy (hyperploidy/diploidy), MYCN oncogene status (amplified or 
not), aberrations at chromosome 11q (presence/absence) (Cohn 2009). 
2.1.5.  Management 
First-line setting 
The treatment of choice is risk category adapted. 
For low risk neuroblastomas, the treatment encompasses surgery followed by observation; 
chemotherapy with or without surgery (for symptomatic disease or unresectable progressive disease 
after surgery); observation (considered an option in case of perinatal neuroblastoma with small adrenal 
tumours). 
For intermediate risk neuroblastomas, the treatment encompasses chemotherapy (e.g. carboplatin, 
cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, and etoposide) with or without surgery; surgery and observation (in 
infants); radiation therapy (only for emergency treatments, like progressive disease or life-threatening 
events related to the disease that does respond to treatment otherwise). 
For high-risk neuroblastomas, the current treatment can be divided into three distinct phases (Maris 
2010): 
induction of remission with intensive chemotherapy. The backbone of the most commonly used 
• 
induction therapy includes dose-intensive cycles of cisplatin and etoposide alternating with vincristine, 
cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin (Kushner 2014). Topotecan was added to this regimen based on the 
anti-neuroblastoma activity seen in relapsed patients (Park 2011). After a response to chemotherapy, 
resection of the primary tumour is usually attempted. 
•  consolidation of the remission with myeloablative chemotherapy which attempts to eradicate minimal 
residual disease using lethal doses of chemotherapy followed rapidly by rescue with autologous 
hematopoietic progenitor cells to repopulate the bone marrow. 
•  and finally a maintenance phase used to treat potential minimal residual disease (MRD) following 
HSCT to reduce the risk of relapse (Matthay 2009), e.g. with ch14.18 (dinutuximab) and isotretinoin, a 
molecule that induces terminal differentiation of neuroblastoma cell lines. 
On 14 August 2015, a marketing authorisation was granted to Unituxin (dinutuximab) with the following 
indication: treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months to 17 years, who have 
previously received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, followed by 
myeloablative therapy and autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT). It is administered in combination 
with granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), interleukin-2 (IL-2), and isotretinoin. 
-  GD2 targeting is associated with acute pain, which is related to GD2 expression on peripheral nerve fibres 
and requires use of analgesia. The antibodies are also unable to treat bulky disease. 
- 
The use of IL-2 is associated with substantial toxicity, including infections, pancytopaenia, capillary leak 
syndrome, aggravation of auto-immune disease, renal and/or hepatic impairment. Fatal complications 
after use of IL-2 have been observed. 
-  Recognised adverse reactions of isotretinoin (13-cis RA) include teratogenicity, myelotoxicity, headache, 
as well as laboratory abnormalities.

Recurrent setting 
Patients with low risk neuroblastoma (ca 37% of all neuroblastoma patients) and intermediate risk (ca 
18%) reach survival in approximately 90 and 70-90% respectively. Most favourable clinical results are 
usually obtained in infants and good outcomes may be the result of restraint (spontaneous regression 
after observation) or surgery. 
Despite intensive multimodal therapy, over 50% of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma relapse with a 
dismal long-term outcome. Historically, recurrent neuroblastoma has been treated with a combination of 
chemotherapy and radiotherapy for the purposes of palliation only. In more recent times, treatment has 
evolved comprising salvage chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery, and 131I-MIBG therapy, and 
ch14.18 monoclonal antibody therapy with aldesleukin-2 (IL-2) and oral isotretinoin (13-cis RA). 
•  Salvage regimens in the recent era have altered the natural disease course and prolonged 
post-relapse survival. Second line chemotherapies with mild to modest toxicities that have not been 
included in frontline treatment are often considered for salvage. Frequently used combinations are 
topotecan, vincristine, and doxorubicin (TVD), temozolomide and irinotecan (TEM/IRN), or topotecan and 
cyclophosphamide. Up to 60% of response or arrest of disease progression can be achieved.  
•  Depending on the type of relapse (localised vs metastatic), location of tumour, previous treatment 
history, etc. it may be that surgery or external beam radiotherapy are part of the treatment strategy. 
•  131I-MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) therapy may be an appropriate treatment option for children 
having MIBG avid (or MIBG positive) disease and has formed a core part of the treatment of relapsed 
neuroblastoma over the last few years. It may be expected to improve or consolidate the response to the 
intense chemotherapy. 
•  A new aggressive treatment approach is being explored but further research is needed to show 
whether it can produce long lasting remissions. Haploidentical stem cell transplantation (Haplo-HSCT) 
involves taking stem cells from a parent and transplanting them into the patient following myeloablative 
chemotherapy to completely destroy the existing bone marrow system. The transplant process effectively 
equips the patient with a new immune system, which is hoped to be able to target any remaining cancer 
cells in a way the patient’s own immune system was unable to. The graft of donor stem cells is engineered 
in such a way that T and B cells are depleted, but large numbers of NK cells are infused. 
Salvage regimens in the recent era have altered the natural disease course and prolonged post-relapse 
survival. Many of the factors at diagnosis that are prognostic of survival also influence survival after 
disease progression or relapse. Factors identified as most highly prognostic of poor survival were age≥18 
months, use of intensive multi-modality treatment at diagnosis, stage 4, elevated serum ferritin, elevated 
LDH, unfavourable histology, high MKI, and MYCN amplification; in addition, shorter time to first relapse 
was a significant adverse factor for survival. 
Up to half of these patients achieve some response or stable disease, and survival after relapse is longer 
in patients who have received salvage therapy. In an INRG analysis of 2,266 patients who experienced 
first progression/relapse, the median time to relapse was 13 months, and 5-year OS from the time of first 
relapse was 20% (London & Castel et al, 2011). The longer survival after relapse is also likely due to early 
detection of disease recurrence as a result of employing more sophisticated surveillance studies in recent 
years. 
There is rationale for a child who has responded to second-line chemotherapy and/or MIBG therapy, and 
now has only MRD, to receive immunotherapy with ch14.18 and isotretinoin (13-cis RA) in order to try 
and achieve long-term remission.

About the product 
Dinutuximab beta is a chimeric monoclonal IgG1 antibody that is specifically directed against the 
carbohydrate moiety of disialoganglioside 2 (GD2), which is overexpressed on neuroblastoma cells. 
Dinutuximab beta has been shown in vitro to bind to neuroblastoma cell lines known to express GD2 and 
to induce both complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cell-mediated 
cytotoxicity (ADCC). In the presence of human effector cells, including peripheral blood nuclear cells and 
granulocytes from normal human donors, dinutuximab beta was found to mediate the lysis of human 
neuroblastoma and melanoma cell lines in a dose-dependent manner. Additionally, in vivo studies 
demonstrated that dinutuximab beta could suppress liver metastasis in a syngeneic liver metastasis 
mouse model. 
Neurotoxicity associated to dinutuximab beta is likely due to the induction of mechanical allodynia that 
may be mediated by the reactivity of dinutuximab beta with the GD2 antigen located on the surface of 
peripheral nerve fibres and myelin (see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
The claimed indication was: 
“Isqette is indicated for the treatment of patients with neuroblastoma. 
90 % of patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma are below 5 years of age, with a median age at diagnosis 
of 22 months. Less than 10 % of the cases occur in patients being older than 10 years.” 
The CHMP recommended the following indication for Dinutuximab beta Apeiron: treatment of high-risk 
neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and above, who have previously received induction 
chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, followed by myeloablative therapy and stem cell 
transplantation, as well as patients with history of relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma, with or without 
residual disease. Prior to the treatment of relapsed neuroblastoma, any actively progressing disease 
should be stabilised by other suitable measures. 
In patients with a history of relapsed/refractory disease and in patients who have not achieved a complete 
response after first line therapy, Dinutuximab beta Apeiron should be combined with interleukin 2 (IL 2). 
The recommended posology consists of 5 consecutive courses, each course comprising 35 days. The 
individual dose is determined based on the body surface area and should be a total of 100 mg/m2 per 
course. 
Two modes of administration are possible: 
• 
• 
a continuous infusion over the first 10 days of each course (a total of 240 hours) at the daily dose 
of 10 mg/m2 
or five daily infusions of 20 mg/m2 administered over 8 hours, on the first 5 days of each course.  
When IL-2 is combined with Dinutuximab beta Apeiron, it should be administered as subcutaneous 
injections of 6×106 IU/m2/day, for 2 periods of 5 consecutive days, resulting in an overall dose of 60×106 
IU/m2 per course. The first 5-day course should start 7 days prior to the first infusion of dinutuximab beta 
and the second 5-day course should start concurrently with dinutuximab beta infusion (days 1 to 5 of each 
dinutuximab beta course). 
Prior to starting each treatment course, the following clinical parameters should be evaluated and 
treatment should be delayed until these values are reached:  
−  pulse oximetry > 94% on room air

−  adequate bone marrow function: absolute neutrophil count ≥ 500/µL, platelet count 
≥ 20.000/µL, haemoglobin > 8.0 g/dL 
−  adequate liver function: alanine aminotransferase (ALT)/ aspartate amino transferase (AST)  
< 5 times upper limit of normal (ULN) 
adequate renal function: creatinine clearance or glomerular filtration rate (GRF) > 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This application has been submitted under Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and 
independent application. During the evaluation of the application, the CHMP considered that the data 
provided in support of this application is not comprehensive and proposed to consider marketing 
authorisation under exceptional circumstances, and consulted with the applicant. The applicant supported 
proposal for a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances and provided the following 
justification: 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive. 
The applicant is unable to provide comprehensive data. Since 2009, when the results of NCI/COG 
• 
study ANBL0032 (supporting the MA for Unituxin) were reported at ASCO and later on also published (Yu, 
Gilman et al. 2010) immunotherapy with ch14.18 antibodies has become the “standard of care” for 
patients suffering from high-risk neuroblastoma, worldwide within the scientific community of paediatric 
oncologists and patient associations/parents. For this reason, it is considered unethical not to provide 
patients with GD2 specific immunotherapy excluding the possibility to have a control arm in the context 
of a randomised clinical study. 
The approval would ensure the availability of an effective treatment modality to patients with 
• 
neuroblastoma patients in the European Union (which is considered as standard of care) and thus 
represent a significant improvement to patient care. 
The uncertainties related to the efficacy and safety of the product will be further studied with the 
• 
conduct of a drug exposure registry (SAFARY). In addition to long-term safety information, data will be 
specifically generated on pain intensity and need for pain medications, effect on peripheral and central 
nervous system, including visual impairment; data on short-term anti-tumour response and long-term 
survival will also be collected. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Dinutuximab beta (also called ch14.18/CHO or APN311) is a monoclonal antibody that is specifically 
directed against carbohydrate disialoganglioside GD2, which is overexpressed by cells of 
neuroectodermal origin such as neuroblastoma cells. APN311 triggers complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC) resulting in activation of the complement cascade and lysis of target cells, as well as 
antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), mediated by recruitment of natural killer (NK) 
cells via the Fc-receptor (CD16, FcγR) interaction of the constant region of the heavy chains, finally 
leading to target cell lysis. 
Dinutuximab beta Apeiron is formulated as a concentrate for solution for infusion that comprises 4.5 
mg/mL dinutuximab beta formulated with histidine, sucrose, polysorbate 20, hydrochloric acid for 
adjustment to pH 6.0 and water for injections. To ensure an extractable volume of 4.5 mL the vials are

filled with 4.9 mL finished product. A solution of 0.9% sodium chloride containing 1% human albumin for 
dilution (provided separately) is used for the preparation of the final solution for infusion. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General Information 
Dinutuximab beta is a monoclonal, chimeric (murine/human) antibody of IgG1 subclass consisting of 2 
light chains (220 amino acids) and 2 heavy chains (443 amino acids). The monoclonal antibody 
incorporates human constant regions for the heavy chain IgG1 and the kappa light chain, along with the 
mouse variable regions targeted specifically against human disialoganglioside (GD2).  
The relative molecular mass of the intact antibody is approximately 150,000 Dalton. There is a single 
N-linked glycosylation site (Asn 293) and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the heavy chain 
contains the typical IgG diantennary fucosylated N-glycans with 0, 1 or 2 galactose residues, with a 
smaller fraction of glycans with sialic acid and oligomannose residues. No Gal-α-1,3 Gal is present in these 
glycans, typical for IgG expression in CHO cells. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured at Rentschler Biotechnologie GmbH, Erwin-Rentschler-Str. 21, 
Laupheim 88471, Germany. 
Manufacturing process and controls 
The monoclonal antibody ch14.18/CHO is expressed in a recombinant CHO cell line. The production of one 
batch APN311 active substance commences with thawing of one vial APN311 working cell bank (WCB). 
During a series of four sub-cultivations, the cells are propagated in shake flasks and subsequently in 20 
L, 100 L and 500 L bioreactors to achieve cell expansion for subsequent inoculation of the production 
bioreactor. Cultivation of the cells in the production bioreactor is performed in fed-batch mode, using a 
fixed feeding strategy. The cultivation is terminated when a viability is reached, followed by harvesting 
and clarification of the supernatant. The biomass is separated by centrifugation and the supernatant is 
depth filtered followed by a 0.2 µm filtration. 
The harvest of one production bioreactor is ultra-filtered for concentration of the harvest  and capture of 
dinutuximab beta is performed in up to three Protein A chromatography runs, depending on product 
concentration of the ultrafiltration harvest. After washing, the bound antibody is eluted from the column 
using a pH-shift and is collected as a single fraction per cycle. Every Protein A capture elution is followed 
immediately by a low pH virus inactivation step. The virus-inactivated intermediates are pH adjusted then 
filtered, pooled and further purified in one anion exchange flow-through chromatography cycle (Q 
Sepharose Fast Flow), to reduce endotoxins, host cell proteins (HCP), DNA and Protein A leachables. The 
anion exchange chromatography is also defined as a virus removal step. The flow-through fraction is 
ultrafiltered and diafiltered, followed by a mixed mode flow-through chromatography step (Capto Adhere), 
to reduce product-related impurities. The last steps are the third ultrafiltration/diafiltration step, 
performed to adjust the product concentration and to exchange the matrix in the final formulation buffer. 
This is followed by the virus nanofiltration step for retention and removal of potential viral particles, with 
filtration through a cascade of a 0.2/0.1 µm filter and finally a virus reduction filter. The final formulation 
step is to adjust the final active substance excipient composition and protein concentration. A final 0.2 µm 
filtration is performed before aliquoting the APN311 active substance in single use containers (bags), 
which results in a single batch of APN311 active substance. The labelled active substance bags are stored 
at for up to 9 months until further processing, at Rentschler Biotechnologie.

Reprocessing is not allowed nor anticipated for any of the steps described. 
5 GMP batches were manufactured using the proposed commercial process v.2.1: GMP1, GMP2, GMP3, 
GMP4 and GMP5. 
Control of materials 
The quality of raw materials is controlled in accordance with the principles of ICH Q6B. All raw materials 
(except for the cell line), used in the upstream and downstream manufacturing process of APN311 active 
substance are animal component free. All media and supplements are serum and protein free; the media 
do not contain any material of animal origin and are manufactured without the use of raw materials 
containing animal origin components. The buffers, reagents and raw materials are suitably documented. 
Source, history and generation of the cell substrate 
DHFR-deficient CHO cells were transfected with the ch14.18 plasmid, pdHL7, containing coding 
sequences for mouse-human chimeric dinutuximab beta (GD2) monoclonal antibody. This is the same 
plasmid as previously used for generation of ch14.18/SP2/0 and ch14.18/NSO in early development.  
Vector sequencing was performed and the nucleotide sequences of the heavy chains and light chains were 
confirmed. Following transfection, high producing clones were isolated using selection medium and two 
rounds of limited dilution sub-cloning, to isolate a suitable clone for production of dinutuximab beta 
(ch14.18/23B11/20D2/6A8). These cells were adapted to serum-free culture conditions and also 
protein-free culture, before a third sub-cloning step for selection of the serum-free sub-clone which was 
used to generate the research cell bank (CHO/ch14.18/6A8/6F12/SF). Six ampoules of the research cell 
bank (RCB) were stored in liquid nitrogen.  
The Master Cell Bank (MCB) was prepared in August 2004 by expansion of cells from one ampoule of the 
primary RCB and stored in protein-free freezing medium in a liquid nitrogen tank. The MCB was shown to 
be stable during long term cultivation over 6 months and in the presence of methotrexate (total cell 
number and viability, specific growth rate and specific production rate), showing that the MCB is suitable 
for large scale production. Genetic characterisation confirmed vector integration in a single, specific site 
and the mean copy number was 6 copies / cell for antibody light chain and 3 copies / cell for antibody 
heavy chain. Adventitious agent testing was performed on the initial MCB, with additional testing on 
transfer of the MCB. The MCB was negative for the presence of microbial contaminations, mycoplasma, 
adventitious viruses and various specific viruses (murine, bovine and porcine viruses) and retroviruses. In 
addition, quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assays were employed for specific detection of 
minute virus of mice (MVM)-DNA sequences. Although one original in vivo assay showed a positive result 
on embryonated cells and cytopathic effect on CHO cells, this finding could not be repeated in three 
further replicates. No evidence was found for presence of adventitious viruses, in compliance with ICH 
Q5D and Q5A. 
The WCB was prepared in May 2011 by expansion of cells from one ampoule of the MCB and subsequently 
stored in protein-free freezing medium in a liquid nitrogen tank. Phenotypical characterisation and 
microbiological safety testing were performed, but no further viral safety testing was done. This is 
acceptable since the parental MCB was fully tested for viral safety and in vitro/in vivo tests are performed 
at the level of the end-of-production cells (EPC), in accordance with ICH Q5A. In 2013, genetic 
characterisation and further tests for microbial contamination were performed, which were satisfactory. 
Two EPC banks were prepared: EPC1 comprised cells obtained from the harvest at the end of a production 
run for GMP2 and EPC2 was generated using an aliquot of cells obtained from the same bioreactor run at 
day 6 and cultivated in shake flasks up to day 19, to maintain the viability of cells in order to perform 
safety assays. Microbial safety testing showed EPC1 was negative for microbial contamination and

mycoplasma. EPC2 was tested for adventitious viruses and retroviruses, with qPCR assays used for 
specific detection of MVM-DNA sequences. These were all negative, although intracytoplasmic A-type 
particles were detected by quantitative transmission electron microscopy (TEM) in 6 of 200 cells; no 
virus-like particles (VLP) were detected in the supernatant and the possible viral load was calculated as < 
4.2 x 104 VLPs/mL. No evidence was found for reverse transcriptase activity or replication competent 
retroviruses, suggesting that there are no infectious retroviruses present in EPC2. 
Comparative genetic characterisation included sequence analysis of APN311-specific cDNA derived from 
MCB, WCB and EPC (RT-PCR and cDNA sequencing), showing heavy chain and light chain is identical in 
MCB, WCB and EPC (0, 5 and 10 days, also 19 days at small scale) and corresponds to the reference 
sequence, confirming genetic stability of the cell line. Integration of the recombinant expression vector 
into the host cell genome at the chromosomal level was determined by fluorescence in-situ hybridisation 
on MCB cells, although the results showed a high level of chromosome rearrangements compared with the 
hybridisation negative control (CHO dhfr- host cells), which is likely to be induced by methotrexate. Based 
on this analysis it was not possible to confirm clonal status of MCB, although one single specific and stable 
vector integration site was detected for the MCB cells in 95% of all metaphase chromosomes, which 
suggests stable integration of the vector. 
Determination of the transgene copy number showed 6 copies per cell for light chain and 2 - 3 copies per 
cell for heavy chain (MCB and WCB), with a slightly lower copy number for the day 19 extended culture 
samples (5 copies for light chain and 2 copies for heavy chain). While these results might indicate some 
instability over extended production, no reduction in productivity was detected up to 10 days in the 
production bioreactor. Differences observed in the SDS-PAGE band pattern at the expected molecular 
mass for IgG under non-reducing conditions, particularly after 45 passages for the MCB, have been 
explained. Genetic stability of the WCB and EPCs at mRNA level (in comparison to the MCB) for the 
intended period of use was confirmed. The potential impact of different copy numbers for light and heavy 
chain on product quality has been discussed; although there are twice as many gene copies for the light 
chain in the production cell line, if excess light chain fragments were present these would be removed 
during the purification process. This is confirmed by the level of low-molecular weight species (LMWS) 
detected in GMP production runs. 
Safety testing for the cell bank is in accordance with ICH Q5A. The source of the foetal calf serum (FCS) 
is considered satisfactory. 
No protocol with description of manufacture and testing acceptance criteria for replacement of the WCB 
was provided. The Applicant confirmed they will file a variation in case a new working cell bank is 
introduced. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Suitable in-process controls (IPC) have been identified in the dossier. Acceptance criteria and ranges for 
cell culture / fermentation (upstream process, USP) and purification (downstream process, DSP) were 
based on process characterisation studies and process performance qualification (PPQ), which was 
performed in combination with risk analysis exercises for all process parameters and steps.  
For cell culture/fermentation, minimum viable cell number and/or concentration were defined to ensure 
proper growth of cells. It is noted that the PPQ batches showed harvest cell viability of 27 - 40%. Controls 
were defined to ensure absence of contamination by adventitious agents. Bulk harvest testing by in-vitro 
virus assay as well as for absence of mycoplasma is performed routinely. Bioburden and endotoxins are 
controlled at multiple steps with limits throughout the entire manufacturing process, i.e. from harvest to 
bulk active substance (and finished product) to guarantee that the process is under control.

Once the production bioreactor is harvested, supernatant is clarified and APN311 purified using a number 
of concentration, capture and flow-through purification steps. The Protein A capture elution is followed 
immediately by a low pH virus inactivation step. The anion exchange flow-through chromatography cycle 
(Q Sepharose Fast Flow) reduces impurities such as endotoxins, HCP, DNA and Protein A leachables and 
a mixed mode flow-through chromatography step (Capto Adhere column) reduces levels of high and low 
molecular weight species, which are controlled as critical quality attributes (CQAs) of APN311. Defined 
minimum yield levels ensure proper performance of all steps. 
A systematic overview of all critical process parameters (CPPs) and IPCs related to the chromatographic 
steps has been given with an associated justification. This approach is considered as a traditional process 
description, which is substantiated with enhanced development and characterisation studies. For a few 
parameters the ranges have been defined, which are supported by 22 full-factorial design of experiments 
(DoE) studies for each step; while for other parameters, only set-points are defined and no ranges are 
attached, therefore validation only at set-point is performed. The data are sufficient to conclude that the 
proposed CPPs and IPCs are justified and able to control the manufacturing process appropriately. 
There are no isolated intermediates with extended storage time during manufacture of APN311 active 
substance. The clarified harvest holding time is either ≤ 24 hours at 18 - 26°C, or ≤ 72 hours at 2 - 8°C. 
Short-term holding times (depending on the process step) have been defined based on data obtained 
from the accumulative hold time study. The maximum duration between successive process steps at 
room temperature (18 - 26°C) is ≤ 24 hours. 
Process validation 
Process characterisation studies performed for USP and DSP Proven Acceptable Range (PAR) studies 
investigated the influence of varying process parameters during APN311 manufacturing process on 
cell/process performance and product quality. For USP, representative small-scale bioreactors (5 - 10 L 
scale) were used in PAR experiments for the evaluation of cultivation parameters considered a high risk or 
with potential impact on quality, such as pH, temperature, seed cell concentration and low oxygen 
pressure (pO2). A total of 23 bioreactor runs was performed, followed by further processing in DSP and 
subsequent product analysis. The DoE studies showed that for the production bioreactor, pH/ 
temperature/seed concentration all influence the content of the major N-glycans and pH affects the 
activity of APN311. Yield was also affected, but was above the level required for further purification at 
harvest. The process parameter pO2 is a non-key operational parameter. The proposed operating ranges 
are relatively tight and data from proven acceptable ranges (PAR) studies support the IPC ranges for 
upstream processing of APN311.  
For downstream processing, a 22-full factorial DoE approach was performed for the three 
chromatographic steps to systematically test the influence of two different parameters on each other, e.g. 
column load and load material pH. The centre point runs of the DoE were used as scale-down verification 
runs (for virus validation studies), as well as column lifetime studies and to determine the maximum 
processing times for individual steps. Elevated aggregate levels were observed after thawing various 
starting materials from GMP1, although it is noted that this is not an issue in production since the 
intermediate storage temperature is 5 ± 3°C. The main observed differences between the runs were the 
step/overall yield, which ranged from 33.4% to 77.1%, as well as slight variations in high molecular 
weight species (HMWS) content and HCP level for various intermediates, although the HMWS was reduced 
to 0.1% by downstream processing in all cases. The GD2 activity and CD16 affinity was comparable 
across best case, worst case and centre point runs, compared with GMP1 and GMP2 values. The majority 
of critical and key operational parameters for the downstream process are acceptable, with the minimum 
and maximum loading density for MabSelect SuRe, Q Sepharose-FF and CaptoAdhere chromatography 
steps defined during process development and process characterization studies in a DoE-based approach.

Although these are wider than the range observed in the four PPQ runs, the loading ranges have been 
justified. For the viral reduction steps, maximum loading density for Protein A and Q Sepharose 
chromatography in the viral validation studies is in line with the claimed maximum load for these steps.  
A clarified description of the worst case ultra-/diafiltration (UF/DF) runs was submitted, which 
demonstrates the validity and robustness of these UF/DF steps. The suggested tightening of the relevant 
CPPs/PPs for step I30 has been implemented; the retentate flow rate is updated from 380 - 580 to 480 - 
580 L/(hxm2), because the data demonstrated a decrease in the amount of monomers under these 
conditions. 
Results of the column lifetime studies using the representative scale-down models supported use up to 20 
cycles (Protein A column), 10 cycles (Q Sepharose FF) and 11 cycles (Capto Adhere column). Column 
lifetimes will be evaluated in ongoing GMP manufacturing batches at production scale. Column cleaning, 
regeneration and sanitization are addressed both in PPQ and in large-scale column lifetime studies 
(ongoing) and corresponding small-scale studies. For all columns, blank runs are used to evaluate 
efficiency of cleaning procedures and potential bioburden contamination or carryover of impurities such 
as HCP, residual DNA and protein. 
Process validation at manufacturing scale was performed on four consecutive production runs (PPQ). 
Given the low number of overall production batches required for the orphan indication, the 2 first 
consecutive GMP runs were included and retrospectively analysed, whereas GMP runs 3 and 4 were 
executed according to pre-defined process validation protocols. Process parameters and product quality 
of all 4 GMP runs were in compliance with defined acceptance ranges, criteria and specifications. 
Additional criteria showed that the cell culture process is well within the maximum allowed population 
doubling levels (PDLs) covered by genetic stability testing, that the acceptance criteria for the monitoring 
of potential contaminants in the production bioreactor and clarified harvest were fulfilled, including 
bioburden, mycoplasma, viruses and endotoxins. For DSP, evaluation of additional parameters during 
process validation showed reliable removal of product-related impurities and process-related impurities 
down to acceptable levels. Removal of process-related impurities has been assured by additional 
in-process testing at step 13 (V10-PP) and step 16 (C30-PP), with these impurities below LOQ at the 
tested intermediates. Acceptance criteria for these process-related impurities have been included in the 
active substance specification. Microbiological control strategy showed that the process is under control 
with respect to potential contaminants. Data from the four PPQ batches confirmed that the active 
substance manufacturing process is well controlled and results in APN311 of consistent quality. The step 
yield limits for I20 and I30 product pools for ultrafiltration / diafiltration, or I50 product pool for 
formulation have been revised in line with the large scale batch data (GMP1 - GMP4). Additional 
parameters will also be monitored as part of continuous process verification with concurrent analysis of 
data at commercial scale. All tested parameters as defined in the revised control strategy will be 
evaluated on an ongoing basis covering all lots (current and future batches), including statistical 
evaluation as part of continuous process verification. 
Manufacturing process development 
Changes were made between APN311 manufacturing campaigns v.1.0 in 2004 (batch T65) and 
2009/2010 (batch T90), and manufacturing campaign v.2.0 in 2012 (batch T110), with an intermediate 
engineering run (batch T99) using manufacturing process v.2.0. Further minor changes were made 
following transfer of APN311 in 2013 - 2014, with 5 GMP batches manufactured using the proposed 
commercial process v.2.1: GMP1, GMP2, GMP3, GMP4 and GMP5.  
Upstream changes from process v.1.0 to process v.2.0 included introduction of a WCB (engineering batch 
T99), minor changes in culture medium, concentration of clarified supernatant by ultrafiltration (storage 
of concentrated 0.2 µm-filtered retentate instead of clarified supernatant), change in bioreactors at new

facility (FR02, also FR03 and FR04 which can be run in tandem), scale up with a slightly different fill and 
feed strategy (batch T110) and more efficient clarification and increase in ultrafiltration membrane area. 
The storage vessels used for media and production harvest at the new facility are all disposable bags. 
Significant changes are the facility changeand introduction of the ultrafiltration step and different 
bioreactors. Manufacturing steps were essentially unchanged on transfer (process v.2.1). Upstream 
fermentation steps were comparable, with a few minor improvements made in thawing, pre-culture, seed 
culture and production steps at RB. None of the changes were expected to have a negative impact on 
quality. 
Changes in downstream processing included introduction of a nanofiltration step (T90), change of Protein 
A chromatography from expanded bed (Protein A resin) to fixed bed mode (MabSelect SuRe) with 2 - 3 
cycles per harvest (T99 / T110), introduction of an additional purification step to reduce fragments and 
dimers (Capto Adhere mixed mode chromatography) and change in formulation buffer from 
phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) to sucrose, histidine and Tween 20, pH 6.0 ± 0.5, in order to reduce 
precipitation observed in PBS. The changes are expected to improve the quality of the product, in terms 
of safety (virus nanofiltration) and quality (reduction in impurities). Other changes in downstream 
processing on transfer to RB include holding the cooled/ 0.2µm filtered harvest at ambient temperature 
overnight, change in the supplier of UF/DF filters and the virus nanofiltration followed by a separate 
formulation step. Changes in chromatography column peak cuts and wash steps were also included, 
which improved product yields. 
Comparability exercise to support manufacturing process development 
A comparability study evaluated an extensive range of quality, purity, identity, activity and safety 
attributes and compared these for T65 and T90 (process v.1.0) and T110 (process v.2.0) GMP 
manufactured material (including T99 engineering run material), with analytical results generated during 
batch release testing and additional comparative characterization. Further comparability studies were 
performed for active substance manufactured in 2013/2014 using the proposed commercial process 
(v.2.1) with batch T110 (process v.2.0), in line with ICH Q5E. No significant differences could be observed 
between processes v.1.0, v.2.0 and v.2.1 according to release testing results, other than in the pH value 
and osmolality (due to the change in active substance formulation), or in purity where 100% monomer 
was detected following optimisation of the purification process for T99/T110 batches. Comparability was 
demonstrated in batch release testing for T65, T90 and T110, and also for T110-finished product, 
GMP1-active substance, GMP2-active substance and GMP1-finished product. No significant differences in 
potency were found between the v.1.0 and v.2.0 batches, or v.2.0 and v.2.1 batches; with specific 
GD2-target binding by ELISA and biological activity. SE-HPLC analysis showed that monomer (area%) 
was also consistent between T110, GMP1 and GMP2. Although glycans, HMWS/LMWS impurities by 
SDS-PAGE, CIEX HPLC main/acidic/basic peaks or potency were not determined for T110-finished 
product at release testing, some of these were determined in the extended characterisation studies. 
Extended characterisation data showed similar structural features for APN311 manufactured by these 
different processes, by far-UV and near-UV circular dichroism spectra, similar light and heavy chain 
masses (including major glycosylation forms of the non-reduced antibody) by matrix-assisted laser 
desorption/ionization time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and electrospray ionisation time 
of flight mass spectrometry (ESI-TOF-MS), with comparable results by peptide mapping (sequence 
coverage of 100% light chain and 96 - 98% by MALDI-TOF MS or >90% by ESI-TOF MS for heavy chain). 
Confirmation of C- and N-terminal sequences was provided, with C-terminal lysine missing for all the 
heavy chain samples (T110 and GMP1/GMP2). Correct positions of the disulfide bridges were shown and 
quantitation of free SH groups was demonstrated to be very low for all samples. Deamidation rates were 
all below 1% by liquid chromatography electrospray ionisation tandem mass spectrometry 
(LC-ESI-MS/MS). Analysis by weak cation-exchange chromatography (WCX-IEC) indicated higher acidic

peaks in batches T65 and T90 at the time of analysis, but this was attributed to the effect of storage (up 
to 8 years), since sample characteristics were similar at the time of release. The WCX main peak and 
acidic peaks were comparable for T110 and GMP 1 and 2, with no basic peaks detected in any samples. 
Slight differences were attributed to the age of T110 at the time of testing (12 months at 5°C). 
Slightly higher levels of G0F were noted in batches T90/T99/T110, compared with batch T65, with a 
corresponding reduction in G1F and G2F; sialylated glycans were also slightly reduced in these later 
batches. Similar results were obtained for the glycan analysis by HPAEC-PAD for T110 (process v.2.0) and 
GMP1/GMP2 (process v.2.1). 
Based on the comparison of the relevant quality attributes, both from release testing and formal 
side-by-side testing, pre-change (process v.1.0: T65, T90) and post-change active substance (process 
v.2.0: T110) and the proposed commercial active substance (process v.2.1: GMP1 and GMP2) are 
considered comparable.  
A head-to-head comparative stress testing stability study (3 months at 40°C) between T110 finished 
product (process v.2.0) and GMP2 (process v.2.1) was performed to evaluate potential differences in the 
degradation profiles. It is noted that active substance and finished product have the same formulation 
and concentration, thus comparison of data from either is acceptable. Although the T110-finished product 
was stored in glass vials for up to 16 months at 5°C prior to pooling into 30mL PETG bottles before starting 
the comparability stress testing, the values at the beginning were similar and would not explain the large 
change seen in GD2 binding activity and particularly the CDC assay results for T110 finished product. 
Comparable results were obtained for stress testing for CD16 binding activity, changes in the charge 
variants by CIEX-HPLC over 3 months at 40°C (reduction in main peak and increase in acidic peaks and 
slight increase in basic peaks), monomer and LMWS.  
Direct comparison between finished products was made for T110-finished product and the first GMP 
finished product batch (1018750) derived from GMP1 active substance, in a second comparative stress 
testing study performed at 40°C. In this study, GD2 binding activity and CDC assay showed similar profile 
for T110 finished product and GMP1 finished product in glass vials, with comparable results for CD16 
binding activity, CIEX-HPLC, monomer (and LMWS), purity (by reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE) 
and N-glycosylation profiles, over 3 months at 40°C. This second study provides some reassurance 
following discrepancies noted in the first stress stability study. 
Additional data from the second comparative stress study performed at 40°C was provided to support 
comparability of clinical and commercial material. Analysis of the charge heterogeneity showed that 
differences are mainly due to changes during storage, and that the basic (intrinsic) pattern is similar. C1q 
binding and CD16 binding do not appear to be stability-indicating; however, GD2 binding, and 
concomitantly CDC and ADCC are clearly stability-indicating and the comparable data support that 
potency of the batches is similar. Changes during storage and the extent of oxidation at M34/W36 and 
M248 (HC Fc-region), or isomerisation at D52 (HC CDR2) and D261/266 (HC Fc-region), or deamidation 
at N33/35 (HC CDR1), as well as N33 (LC CDR1), was investigated by storage under stress conditions 
(40°C, over 1 – 3 months). Data clearly indicate a relevant effect on binding (GD2 and CD16) and potency 
(CDC and ADCC), which were correlated to the formation of charge variants by CIEX-HPLC. The content 
of acidic and basic variants is controlled as CQAs in the routine release testing. These represent suitable 
specification limits to ensure control of oxidation and deamidation in APN311. 
Characterisation 
Most lots of APN311 produced were analysed and submitted to extended characterisation, including early 
lots T65, T90, T99 and T110, as well as recent batches, GMP1 and GMP2. Analysis of primary reference 
standard SR-951PI.1 (derived from GMP1) has also been included as a representative sample. 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 22/129 
 
 
 
 
The amino acid sequence of APN311 was confirmed, with sequence coverage of up to 98% for the heavy 
chain and 100% for the light chain. The C-terminal lysine of the heavy chain was missing in the majority 
of samples; APN311 with intact C-terminus was detected among the basic charge variants, typically 
present at less than 10%. All peaks in the peptide map were identified, with potential areas for 
modification analysed further by mass spectrometry following storage under stress conditions. Secondary 
structure was determined as typical for an antibody, by circular dichroism. The results are in the expected 
range for mass determination for light chain and heavy chain, by MALDI-TOF MS and ESI-TOF-MS, with 
the mass of reduced light chain of 24071 ±1 Da and masses of the reduced heavy chains (without 
C-terminal lysine) comprising the three major glycosylation forms G0F, G1F and G2F, with two major 
signals at 49753 ±1 (G0F), 49915 ±1 (G1F) and two minor peaks of 49525 Da (Man5) and 50077 ±1 Da 
(G2F). Glycosylation analysis was further evaluated using high performance anion exchange 
chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAEC-PAD) showing neutral oligosaccharide 
structures as the main glycan component consisting of predominantly 1,6-fucosylated diantennary 
glycans without one and two ß-galactose residues. Diantennary glycans with a-1,6-linked fucose, 
truncated glycans lacking ß-galactose and N-acetylglucosamine residues and oligomannosidic 
Man4-9GlcNAc2 glycan chains  were found in all antibody samples. Sialylated glycans 
(N-acetylneuraminic acid) were detected in ≤ 3.6% of total N-glycans. Further information supports site 
occupancy for glycans of >99%, and confirms that the glycan pattern is consistent between batches. 
A theoretical extinction coefficient is used for determination of ch14.18/CHO concentration, which was 
subsequently confirmed by determination of the experimental extinction coefficient. Purity of APN311 was 
determined using a number of different methods, with reducing sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE); non-reducing SDS-PAGE or by SE-HPLC. Identity by non-reducing 
SDS-PAGE shows the expected band of about 150 kDa corresponding to the expected size of an intact 
IgG1, but smaller faint bands were also visible at about 100 kDa, 70kDa and 26kDa on the gels.  The 
identity of these bands has been clarified as product-related variants of ch14.18/CHO, with only traces of 
HCP. Bands at 50kDa appear to contain heavy chain and two light chains, with the band at 25 kDa 
appearing to be mainly free light chain with low levels of HCP. Since these are all at levels well below the 
main band (by densitometry), these product-related impurities are not expected to have an adverse 
impact on the dinutuximab product. 
CIEX-HPLC of ch14.18/CHO shows main, acidic and basic peaks. Different charge variants are part of the 
normal distribution, correlated to presence or absence of C-terminal lysine and mono-, di- and 
tri-sialylated variants of glycans, which are regarded as product-related substances.  Increase/decrease 
in these groups may change due to degradation, and other modifications such as oxidation or 
deamidation/isomerization of amino acid side chains.  
Potency was determined by specific GD2-binding activity and CD16 binding activity, which is used as a 
surrogate for ADCC activity, as well as CDC activity. Additional information was provided to support the 
use of relative binding for both CD16 and GD2 binding. Measurement of CD16 receptor binding instead of 
ADCC activity was also justified, using data from production batches, stressed samples and different 
charge forms. Under accelerated conditions (25°C) or stress testing (40°C), an increase of acidic charge 
variants was observed by CIEX-HPLC, which was correlated to a reduction of GD2 target binding. 
Process-related impurities have been shown to be removed to sufficiently low levels during the 
purification process. 
Specification  
The active substance specification for dinutuximab beta is presented in and includes identity, purity and 
impurities, potency and other general tests. Potency is controlled by 3 methods: 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 23/129 
 
 
 
 
- GD2-binding activity: This test method is designed and validated for quantitative evaluation of the 
potency of APN311 by measuring the specific binding activity to the antigen GD2 in vitro. 
- CD16-binding activity: CD16 Binding activity as a surrogate for Antibody Dependent Cell-Mediated 
Cytotoxicity (ADCC) activity. Specific binding to Fc receptor CD 16 determines the efficacy of the antibody 
to bind to natural killer (NK) cells. 
- Complement Dependent Cytotoxicity (CDC): This test method is designed and validated for the 
quantitative evaluation of the potency by measuring CDC for specific and dose-dependent target cell lysis 
induced by APN311. 
Analytical methods for release and stability testing of the active substance were described. 
Methods used for testing of active substance and additional impurity testing include SDS-PAGE for the 
quantitative determination of purity/impurities under non-reducing conditions (method APA-QC-025, 
Protein A-HPLC for ch14.18/CHO content (APA-QC-002). 
Contaminants such as endotoxins, bioburden and mycoplasma are tested by the relevant Ph. Eur. 
methods (2.6.14, 2.6.12 and 2.6.7, respectively), with adventitious virus testing (14 days in vitro assay) 
by SOP APC-0271. Osmolality and pH are also tested using Ph. Eur. methods (2.2.35 and 2.2.3, 
respectively). 
Data has been provided to substantiate that separate control of oxidation and deamidation is not 
necessary, because changes to the ion-exchange HPLC (IEX-HPLC) pattern are sufficient to pick up these 
changes and the specifications for IEX-HPLC are sufficiently well-defined. The limit for residual HCP of 
should be reviewed/revised after manufacture of 20 batches, since current batch data is limited. The 
specification limit for the Man5 glycans has been tightened based on the small-scale transfer and process 
characterisation runs, as well as the 5 GMP batches to date. In order to align acceptance limits for all 
afucosylated structures quantified, the proposed limits for cGN2 have been tightened. 
A commercial assay has been used for detection of host cell protein and this assay is not specific to the 
manufacturing process. Further data has been provided to demonstrate that theHCP assay provides 
sufficient coverage of the HCPs present in the APN311 upstream samples (harvest after filtration), 
confirming that the HCP assay is sufficiently representative for quantitative detection of HCPs in APN311 
in-process control samples to enable this to be used in place of a process-specific HCP assay. Information 
on the samples used for determination of linearity in the HCP assay has also been provided. 
The validation of analytical procedures was performed. In addition, matrix validation was performed for 
compendial tests for bioburden and endotoxin.  
The 4 GMP batches of APN311 show comparable results and all results are within specification. Identity 
was confirmed and comparable purity/impurity profiles were obtained, with only low levels of HMWS and 
LMWS observed in these batches. Protein characterisation data show comparable results for all batches, 
with similar CIEX profiles for all 4 batches. N-glycan analysis profiles were similar, although some 
batch-to-batch variability was observed. Robustness of the sample workup (specifically N-glycosidase F 
lots and incubation time) for N-glycan analysis has now been validated.  
Potency was consistent across batches, with GD2 levels relative to reference standard, CD16 relative to 
reference standard and CDC levels. Both product-related and process-related impurities were cleared to 
acceptably low levels, in many cases well below the set acceptance criteria. Endotoxin was well below the 
specification limits (and below LOQ) and bioburden levels were 0 cfu/10mL. 
Reference standards 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 24/129 
 
 
 
 
The primary reference standard SR-951PI.1 has been used for analyses of active substance / finished 
product since April 2014 (GMP3 and GMP4), as well as for stability testing. This primary reference 
standard (SR-951PI.1) was derived from GMP1 and characterised using the previous interim reference 
standard SR-950KU.1 (derived from T110 in 2012), with the exception of the complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC assay). Reference standard SR-950KU.1 was previously used for validation of the 
different analytical methods and release of active substance batches GMP1 and GMP2. 
Reference material L03/CH1418/UDF was derived from non-GMP production in 2009 using process v.1.0 
and used for release of batches T90 and T110, as well as method validation and stability testing. Prior to 
this, early development reference material (48P8-1PS/01) was manufactured in 1997. 
Results presented demonstrate that the interim reference standard SR-950KU.1 and primary reference 
standard SR-951PI.1 are comparable. Additional data, including reducing and non-reducing SDS-PAGE 
gels and Western blots, IEF gels; peptide map fingerprint; chromatograms for N-glycan analysis, 
SE-HPLC and CIEX-HPLC were given for primary reference standard SR-951PI.1. The primary reference 
standard SR-951PI.1 has been used for active substance and finished product release since April 2014. 
This reference standard was shown to be suitable for its intended purpose by comprehensive analysis, 
including GD2 binding activity, CD16 binding activity and CDC analysis. A potency value of 1.28 (relative 
to previous reference standard L03/ch14.18/UDF) was assigned to SR-951PI.1 for the CDC assay. 
Aliquots of the reference standard (200 µL) are stored at -70°C ± 10°C and stability testing will continue 
for 60 months. Stability has been demonstrated for 24 months at -70°C to date and also at 5°C storage 
for 2 weeks, with no changes observed within this period. 
Further internal reference standards will be qualified in comparison to SR-951PI.1 using an appropriate 
set of methods and reviewed via a post-approval variation. 
Container closure system 
Details have been provided for the primary container for the active substance, comprising pre-sterilised 
single-use storage bags (Flexboy containers). Certification has been provided to demonstrate that these 
meet appropriate standards for containers for biopharmaceutical products, including an EC certificate. 
The Flexboy bags are sterilised by gamma irradiation in a validated sterilisation process, with the 
efficiency of the minimum dose of 25 kGy validated to obtain 10-6 sterility assurance level (SAL). 
Stability 
Stability studies confirm the stability of APN311 under long term storage conditions, with no changes 
observed for appearance, identity, protein content or glycan profile. For potency under long term stability 
conditions, the data shows some variations, but all remain within the acceptance criteria given for these 
parameters. All GD2 binding was between 98 - 111% up to 24 months (for GMP1 and GMP2) and up to 18 
months (for GMP3). For CD16 binding, values were between 87 and 123%, while CDC activity was 
determined as 84 - 110% up to 24 months (GMP1 and GMP2) and up to 18 months (GMP3). No significant 
changes were observed in the other parameters for these batches over 24 or 18 months. 
Supportive data under accelerated conditions (5 ± 3°C) confirmed that no major changes could be 
observed for GMP1 - GMP3 (and T99 in the new formulation buffer), although there were variations in the 
CDC activity, with an increase from 107% to 122% for GMP1, reduction from 105 to 85% for GMP2 and 
108 to 98.4% for GMP3. Supportive data from T99 under these conditions (up to 16 months) did not show 
any distinct trends. No changes were observed in the other potency parameters, GD2 binding and CD16 
binding, although there were fluctuations in the values across the time-points (0 to 6 months) for these 
analytical results. A minor trend was observed with slightly elevated quantities of acidic and basic forms, 
with a corresponding reduction in main peak, determined by CIEX-HPLC for GMP1 - GMP3 under these 
conditions. 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 25/129 
 
 
 
 
The freeze/thaw stability program was extended to include two additional batches (GMP2 and GMP3). 
Data from these batches confirm stability of the active substance over three freeze/thaw cycles and 
stability-indicating parameters (size-exclusion chromatography (SEC), CIEX) do not indicate 
changes/degradation for all three batches. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product is presented as concentrate for solution for infusion in a clear Type I glass vial (6 mL) 
with a halobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium flip-off cap, containing a minimum extractable volume of 
4.5 mL concentrate for solution for infusion. 
One mL of concentrate contains 4.5 mg/ml dinutuximab beta. Each vial contains 20 mg dinutuximab beta 
in 4.5 mL. 
The active substance is formulated with sucrose, polysorbate 20, histidine, water for injections and 
hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment). All the excipients are of Ph. Eur. standard and a slight overfill (4.9 
mL) is given to ensure that 4.5 mL can be extracted from the vials.  
Pharmaceutical development 
Formulation occurs at the last step of the active substance manufacturing, prior to immediate sterile 
filtration and aseptic fill or storage at -70°C. In accordance with ICH Q5E, an evaluation of the relevant 
quality attributes has been performed following formulation change and other active substance 
manufacturing process changes (see active substance section). Comparison of APN311 finished product 
in the two different formulations showed similar degradation curves under short-term stress conditions. 
Batches formulated in PBS were T65 and T90, used in the Phase I clinical trials and clinical trials 301 (HR), 
201 (Haplo), 202 (LTI) and 303 (LTI-Pilot). Batch T110 was formulated in histidine/sucrose/polysorbate 
80 and was also used in clinical trials 301 (HR), 201 (Haplo), 202 (LTI), as well as clinical trials 102 
(Japan) and 304 (Single Agent). Both formulations (concentrate for solution for infusion) were/are used 
for the preparation of the final solution for infusion by dilution in 0.9% sodium chloride and 1% human 
albumin (HSA). The commercial saline/1% HSA as diluent of the solution for infusion remained 
unchanged throughout all clinical trials and is the proposed commercial diluent. 
Since the finished product manufacturing process consists of thawing of active substance, sterile filtration 
and aseptic filling into glass vials, this process has not been changed over the course of development 
(other than the filter material and rubber stopper) and complete process validation has been performed. 
Finished product is filled into type I glass vials, closed with coated bromobutyl rubber stoppers and 
aluminium crimping caps, with a blue flip-off seal. Container closure system integrity was demonstrated 
to be acceptable for finished product, shown using methylene blue dye ingress testing. Long-term 
stability studies are ongoing for the finished product in the new formulation, under long-term and 
accelerated conditions, including sterility testing.  
The finished product is a sterile concentrate intended for the preparation of a solution for infusion. The 
concentrate for solution for infusion is diluted into commercial 0.9% sodium chloride and 1% human 
albumin, which results in physiological conditions for the final solution infusion, i.e. pH 6.6 and osmolality 
of about 283 mOsmol/kg, while maintaining product stability at ambient temperature for the duration of 
infusion.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 26/129 
 
 
 
 
One finished product batch is produced using aliquots from one active substance batch (20 - 30L), but it 
is noted that the finished product pooling consisted of three active substance aliquots (GMP1), four active 
substance aliquots (GMP2 and GMP4) or five active substance aliquots (GMP3) in the PPQ batches.  
Active substance in bags is thawed and held up to 24 hours before homogenisation, filtered and 
sterile-filtered (with two in-line 0.2 µm filters) into a sterile glass vessel in a Class A area. Filters are 
washed with buffer and conditioned with bulk solution prior to filtration, with integrity testing before and 
after filtration. Samples taken before both or after the first filter are tested for bioburden and endotoxin, 
respectively. The solution is filled into pre-sterilised/depyrogenated vials and stoppers applied 
immediately after filling. Capping and crimping are followed by 100% visual inspection of the vials before 
storage at 5°C ± 3°C. There are no isolated intermediates during manufacture of APN311 finished 
product. 
Process validation 
Process validation was performed retrospectively for GMP1 and GMP2, with prospective validation of 
GMP3 and GMP4. Process validation included filter validation (retention of microbes, adsorption/dilution 
of active substance, extractables and leachables), container closure integrity and microbial safety of the 
manufacturing process (in-process control and holding times, media fills, sterilisation and depyrogenation 
of containers/closures and equipment, environmental monitoring).  
A mixing study in the 50 L glass bottle examined stirring speed and time, which were tested at or near the 
limits for GMP3 (maximum limits) and GMP4 (minimum limits). These confirmed homogeneity of the 
formulated bulk, without any impact on quality (determined by protein content, excipients, SE-HPLC for 
formation of HMWS/LMWS and GD2/CD16 binding activity). This process characterisation study was used 
to define a control strategy for this mixing step and CPPs with appropriate limits (shaking frequency and 
time, stirring speed and time) will ensure homogeneity of the formulated bulk during routine production. 
Filtration flux was not within the operating range for GMP3, but all other operating parameters were 
within the defined operating range. The filter flush volume was increased prior to GMP4, to prevent 
dilution of the filtered bulk. The performance parameters for thawing, pooling, filtration, filling, 
capping/crimping and visual inspection were all within the acceptance criteria, except for an increased 
number of rejects for GMP3 vials, which was attributed to inaccurately seated stoppers. Adaptation of the 
filling needles and pump parameters resulted in a reproducible filling process.  
Control of excipients 
The composition of APN311 finished product is identical to that of APN311 active substance. All excipients 
used in the formulation of active substance/finished product are of pharmacopoeial grade quality 
according to the respective monographs in the current editions of Ph. Eur., and are tested accordingly by 
the supplier. Since no additions or changes to the formulation from active substance to finished product 
are applied, the excipients specifications are identical. No further excipients are used in the manufacture 
of APN311 finished product.  
Product specification 
The specification for the finished product is presented. 
The majority of analytical methods are the same as for active substance, which reflects the fact that the 
finished product manufacturing process is limited to sterile filtration and aseptic filling.   
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 27/129 
 
 
 
 
 
Acceptance criteria for the additional tests required for finished product (visible particles, sterility, 
uniformity of dosage units, sub-visible particles and extractable volume) are justified based on Ph. Eur. 
requirements. Appropriate limits for polysorbate, histidine and sucrose have also been added. 
Container closure system 
Finished product is filled in 6 ml sterile type I (DIN6R) glass vials, 4.5 mL with a 0.4mL overfill to comply 
with Ph. Eur. 3.2.1 for extractable volume. The vials are closed with 20 mM Flurotec-coated grey 
bromobutyl rubber stoppers, which comply with Ph. Eur. 3.2.9. Crimping seals are aluminium caps with a 
blue polypropylene flip-off seal. These have been described in sufficient detail and do not lead to any 
concerns. Suitable testing is described and the glass vials and rubber injection stopper are sterilised using 
dry heat and steam sterilisation, respectively. The sterilisation procedures are validated. APN311 finished 
product is transported in the sealed glass vials inserted into card board boxes as secondary packaging. 
Stability of the product 
The Applicant claimed a shelf life of 24 months when stored at 5 ± 3°C, which is supported by the stability 
data and is therefore considered acceptable. Stability studies are in progress for 3 batches of finished 
product (GMP1, GMP2 and GMP3) manufactured using the proposed commercial process (v.2.1), under 
long term (5 ± 3°C), accelerated (25 ± 2°C) and stress conditions (40 ± 2°C). Vials from GMP1 were 
stored in both upright and inverted positions at 5 ± 3°C.  Stability data generated under these long term 
conditions is available for 30 months (GMP1), 18 months (GMP2) or 12 months (GMP3), confirming that 
there was no changes or obvious trends compared with the day 0 data for these batches. No changes are 
observed in GD2 binding, CD16 binding or CDC activity under long term storage conditions. Photostability 
studies were also performed for up to 3 months under long term conditions, showing that APN311 was 
reasonably stable on exposure to light, although reduction in CDC activity and increase in acidic forms 
was observed after 4 cycles of light exposure. Section 6.4 of the SmPC includes the statement ‘Keep the 
vial in the outer carton in order to protect from light’ to address this. 
Supportive stability data has been generated using batches T99 and T110 (process v.2.0), formulated in 
the same 20 mM histidine, 5% sucrose, 0.01% polysorbate 20 buffer, pH 6.0 and with the same primary 
packaging. Data up to 12 months (batch T99, an engineering batch which was not used in clinical studies) 
and 24 months shows that this material was stable under long term conditions (5 ± 3°C) up to 24 months, 
although clinical batch T110 results for CDC activity were out-of-specification (OOS) for CDC activity at 30 
and 36 months (60% and 59% relative activity, respectively). All the other results remained within 
specification limits. This stability study for clinical batch T110 will continue for a further 2 years under long 
term conditions. 
Additional data has been given for batches T65 and T90 (process v.1.0), although these were formulated 
in phosphate buffered saline, pH 7.0. Stability data up to 96 months (T65) and 48 months (T90) showed 
an increase in HMWS and LMWS (close to the limits), but GD2-binding activity and CDC activity  were 
comparable to time 0 values for T65, with slightly reduced CDC activity but not GD2-binding activity for 
T90. 
Accelerated stability studies with GMP1, GMP2 and GMP3 (up to 6 months at 25 ± 2°C) shows that CDC 
activity is out-of-specification at 3 months under these conditions. GD2-binding activity was also OOS 
after 3 or 6 months in these GMP batches. Degradation of APN311 under these conditions is confirmed by 
changes in the IEF pattern and a significant increase in acidic forms after 6 months, with a smaller 
increase in basic forms, determined by CIEF-HPLC. Higher ratios of LMWS were also observed. No 
degradation was observed up to 1 month at 25°C, confirming that handling for short periods at room 
temperature is acceptable. Data from GMP batches was supported by data generated under similar 
conditions for batches T99 and T110. Data generated under stress conditions (40 ± 2°C) showed a similar

pattern in a shorter timeframe, with OOS results for CDC activity and GD2 binding after 2 weeks, and 
formation of acidic forms leading to OOS results after 4 weeks. Increase in LMWS was also observed in 
these stress studies up to the 2 month time-point. 
In-use stability 
Details of the two infusion devices used for administration of dinutuximab beta (provided separately) and 
the product contact material have been given for the syringe and infusion bag. The Applicant has provided 
the in-use stability study report for dinutuximab beta finished product to support the clinical phase III 
studies and commercial use using these two devices. Finished product is diluted to 0.2 mg/mL in a 
physiological sodium chloride solution (0.9% NaCl) with 1% human albumin, to be administered by 
continuous intravenous infusion via a 50 mL syringe in an infusor device, or via a peristaltic mini-pump 
from a 250 mL medication cassette reservoir. Stability data in the 50 mL syringe were comparable to the 
initial values after 72 hours at 5°C and 24 / 48 hours at 37°C, except for the pH which decreased from 
6.55 to 6.42 over the storage time at 37°C. For the infusion solution in the 250 mL bag, analytical results 
were comparable to the initial values after 72 hours at 5°C and 7 days at 37°C. This confirms that the 
dilution matrix and materials used does not impact the dinutuximab beta; both strategies for continuous 
infusion are acceptable. 
Results from a more comprehensive in-use stability study have been submitted to demonstrate that 
different containers / devices (50mL syringe and 250mL infusion bags) in combination with an infusion 
line and 0.22 µm in-line filter, representing the typically-used devices in hospitals, are suitable for the 
administration of APN311. The in-use study was performed at minimum and maximum worst case 
concentrations of 0.1125 mg/mL to 0.4420 mg/mL APN311 in 0.9% NaCl with 1% human albumin, which 
represents the range of concentrations expected to be infused via the intended route of administration, 
based on the patient body surface area. In-use stability was demonstrated for 48 hours at 25°C (with the 
50mL syringe) or 7 days at 37°C (with the 250mL infusion bag) and no impact on potency or other tested 
parameters was identified. It is noted that the human albumin and sodium chloride solution (0.9%) used 
for dilution of the APN311 are provided by the hospital and are expected to be approved for human use.  
The SmPC Section 6.6 includes a note that ‘Elastomeric pumps are not considered suitable in combination 
with in-line filters’, as recommended. 
From a microbiological point of view, the product should be used immediately. If not used immediately, 
in-use storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would not normally 
be longer than 24 hours at 2 to 8 °C, unless dilution has taken place in controlled and validated aseptic 
conditions. 
The absence of formal extractable/leachable studies with dinutuximab beta and the proposed infusion 
bags and syringes is based on compliance of these devices with Ph. Eur. and the use of physiological 
saline as diluent. 
Adventitious agents 
All raw materials, except for the cells themselves, used in the upstream and downstream manufacturing 
process of APN311 active substance are animal component free. Raw materials, including media and 
excipients are tested for bioburden (Ph. Eur. 2.6.12) and endotoxins (Ph. Eur. 2.6.14), except sodium 
hydroxide and hydrochloric acid due to methodical reasons. In addition, buffers used for final 
manufacturing steps are tested for bioburden and endotoxins. 
The manufacturing process does not contain any animal-derived starting materials, which were only used 
in the development of the cell line: FCS (cattle, Australia), thymidine (salmon) and trypsin (porcine) were 
used. Corresponding certificates of analysis and conformity are provided in 3.2.A.2. Trypsin and FCS were

negative for the presence of porcine parvovirus and selected bovine viruses (bovine viral diarrhea virus 
(BVDV), Bovine herpesvirus 1 (BHV-1), Parainfluenza-3). The cells were adapted to serum-free medium 
during the manufacture of the RCB prior to laying down the MCB. 
The MCB was extensively tested in vitro and in vivo for the presence of adventitious viruses and for 
various specific viruses (murine, bovine and porcine viruses) and retroviruses. In addition, qPCR assays 
were employed for specific detection of MVM-DNA sequences. No viruses were detected and all 
acceptance criteria were fulfilled. TEM analysis showed no intra-cytoplasmic A-type virus-like particles or 
extracellular C-type VLPs, or other virus-like particles or viruses, detected on 200 evaluated MCB cells. 
When analyzing test article supernatant, no virus-like particles were detected. Reverse transcriptase 
activity was not detectable by product-enhanced reverse transcriptase (PERT) assay and 
replication-competent retroviruses were not detectable by the S+L- assay, confirming lack of infectious 
retroviruses in the MCB. 
An EPC bank (EPC2APA) was established and tested for latent or inducible viruses/retroviruses, as given 
for the MCB. For the EPC, intracytoplasmic A-type particles were detected in about 3% (6 cells) of 200 
evaluated cells by TEM analysis and the positive cells exhibited 1-15 VLPs. No C-type particles, or other 
VLPs or viruses were detected. When analyzing test article supernatant, no virus-like particles were 
detected. As a result, the calculated possible load is < 4.2 x 104 VLPs/mL. Reverse transcriptase activity 
was not detectable by PERT assay and replication competent retroviruses were not detectable by the S+L- 
assay or by co-cultivation of cells with Mus dunni cells and S+L- assay, confirming lack of infectious 
retroviruses in the EPC (extended culture). 
The WCB was not tested for viral safety. As the parental MCB1APA was fully characterised according to 
ICH Q5A, no further viral safety testing was required. Unprocessed bulk harvest produced from the WCB 
tested negative for adventitious viruses and infectious retroviruses and no virus-like particles were 
detected in test article supernatant from three representative batches of bulk harvest. A potential load of 
6.3 x 104 was used as basis for calculation of the overall viral safety margin of the manufacturing process. 
Virus validation studies 
The process steps C10 (Benzonase / Triton X-100 inactivation wash step), V10 (low pH inactivation), C20 
(chromatographic step) and I20 (filtration step) were tested for their potential to clear viral contaminants. 
Only low clearance of Reo3 and MVM were observed in the initial study report for Protein A, therefore 
further analysis was performed separately for low pH inactivation and the Benzonase/ Triton X-100 wash 
step, evaluated by incubation with these reagents for 30 minutes at 18°C. This resulted in acceptable 
clearance of pseudorabies virus (PRV) (≥ 5.36 log 10), but lower viral reduction of xenotropic murine 
leukemia virus (X-MuLV) (≥ 2.99 log 10) under these conditions. Similar results were obtained for low pH, 
with clearance of PRV (≥ 5.03 log10), but lower clearance of X-MuLV (≥ 2.86 log10). Good clearance was 
shown for all viruses with the virus filtration step (I20) and the Q-Sepharose chromatography 
(flow-through). 
The combination of virus safety data from the cell banks (both MCB and EPC), data from TEM analysis of 
crude bulk harvest and the current safety margin obtained for X-MuLV during virus validation shows that 
the production process of APN311 is suitable for clearance of potential viral contamination. Overall log 10 
reduction factors were ≥ 17.09 for X-MuLV, ≥ 13.65 for MVM, ≥ 23.89 for PRV and ≥ 13.32 for Reo3. The 
safety margin (based on X-MuLV) is ≥ 9.14 log 10.  
TSE Issues 
FCS was obtained from cattle in Australia. An EDQM certificate has been provided for this FCS (R0-CEP 
2002-167-Rev 01) which was used during generation of the RCB. Cells were subsequently adapted to 
serum-free medium during manufacture of the RCB, prior to manufacture of the MCB.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Active substance 
Generation of the cell line and cell banks for manufacture of APN311 is sufficiently described. Cell line 
stability was demonstrated. The apparent discrepancies in the cell bank data were subsequently 
explained. 
The description of the active substance manufacturing process and related information was updated, with 
CTD sections S.2.2-4 completely revised. Limits for the IPCs were included in the flow charts for upstream 
and downstream processing. IPCs were added for the production bioreactor at harvest (titre and product 
yield) and a minimum limit set for cell viability at harvest, to provide conditions for effective processing 
with no impact on the subsequent filtration step. For downstream processing, the IPC limits are 
acceptable, with the minimum and maximum loading density for the MabSelect SuRe, Q Sepharose and 
CaptoAdhere chromatography steps defined during process development and process characterisation 
studies in a DoE-based approach. The Applicant has defined terminology used in the dossier; these are 
broadly in line with ICH principles.  
The process characterisation studies are of acceptable quality and can be deemed suitable for a 
manufacturing process where no design space or similar flexibility is claimed. Additional information has 
been provided to link the process characterisation studies with the control strategy. The Applicant 
provided a systematic overview of all CPPs and IPCs related to the chromatographic steps, with an 
associated justification. This approach considered as comprising a traditional process description, which is 
substantiated with enhanced development and characterisation studies. For a few parameters the ranges 
have been defined, which are supported by 22 full-factorial DoE studies for each step, while for other 
parameters, only set-points are defined and no ranges are attached; therefore it is sufficient that only 
validation at set-point is performed. The data are considered sufficient to conclude that the proposed 
CPPs and IPCs are justified and able to appropriately control the manufacturing process. 
Process validation was supported by DoE studies and confirmed at the commercial scale in 4 GMP runs. 
The provided PPQ data (both prospective and retrospective) confirm that the Applicant is able to 
manufacture an active substance which meets its specifications and that the individual steps are under 
control. Impurity removal and process robustness were more fully addressed in response to the 
questions, including appropriate data that small (non-proteinaceous) impurities will be removed by the 
UF/DF steps and by other process steps. Worst case UF/DF runs were performed to demonstrate the 
validity and robustness of these steps. 
Characterisation studies investigated the physicochemical and biological attributes of dinutuximab beta, 
which are as expected for a monoclonal antibody, including predominantly diantennary glycosylation and 
very little C-terminal lysine. Potency was determined by specific GD2-binding activity and CD16 binding 
activity, as well as CDC activity. Further information was provided to justify the measurement of 
CD16-binding as a surrogate for ADCC activity, since ADCC is part of the mechanism of action for APN311. 
Additional physicochemical and biological data was provided for the characterisation exercise for active 
substance. This pertains to physicochemical identification of CQAs, and the link to biological 
characterisation of GD2 and CD16 (FcRIII) binding, as well as CDC activity. Measurement of CD16 
(FcγRIII) receptor binding instead of ADCC activity was also justified, using data from production batches, 
stressed samples and different charge forms. Under accelerated conditions (25°C) or stress testing 
(40°C), an increase of acidic charge variants was observed by CIEX-HPLC, which was correlated to a 
reduction of GD2 target binding. The extent of oxidation / deamidation / isomerisation has been evaluated 
in the context of product characterisation and is controlled via specification limits for acidic and basic 
species in APN311.

While some changes were made between the early manufacturing process and the proposed commercial 
process, these did not have a significant impact on the quality of active substance and the three 
manufacturing processes (v.1.0, v.2.0 and v.2.1) yielded comparable dinutuximab beta. The 
comparability exercise between clinical and commercial batches has demonstrated that material from 
these manufacturing processes are comparable, with additional data from the second comparative stress 
study performed at 40°C provided to support comparability of clinical and commercial material.  
The reference standard is satisfactory and can also be used for the finished product, since no changes are 
made in the concentration of dinutuximab beta or excipients compared with active substance. Additional 
stability data has been provided for this reference standard. 
The proposed acceptance criteria for many of the active substance and finished product specifications, 
including purity and potency, have been revised based on clinical batch data and process capability. The 
same specification limits apply to release and shelf life for all analytical methods. The proposed 
specification limit for the afucosylated Man5 structure has been tightened based on the small-scale 
transfer and process characterisation runs, as well as the 5 GMP batches to date. In order to align 
acceptance limits for all afucosylated structures quantified, the proposed limits for cGN2 have been 
tightened. 
For the HCP assay, initial comparison of the HCP-profiles of an upstream sample APN311 (harvest after 
filtration) against the HCP standard (silver-stained 2D SDS-PAGE) showed acceptable spot coverage of 
73%. In an additional experiment, the coverage of kit antibodies for HCPs present in a representative 
APN311 upstream sample (filtered and concentrated harvest) was shown using 2D PAGE and Western 
blot, demonstrating detection of 71% of spots over the entire pH and molecular weight range. This 
confirms the ability of the antibody in the kit to detect the majority of HCPs in the APN311 harvest 
fraction.  
The number of batches of APN 311 produced so far is limited, since this is an orphan medicine indication; 
therefore the Applicant proposes to tighten the HCP specification limit. While this is still high compared 
with the measured HCP, this can be accepted at present, but the Applicant is recommended to review the 
HCP levels and revise the specification limits (if appropriate) once a total of 20 batches have been 
manufactured. 
Stability studies were conducted to support the claimed long-term storage of active substance for up to 12 
months at -70°C. There is no clear trend over time and stability data has been provided up to 24 months 
(GMP1 and GMP2) and 18 months (GMP3), to further support the proposed shelf life for APN311 active 
substance of 12 months under long term storage conditions.  
It has been established which physicochemical changes in CQAs during storage result in changes to 
biological activity. Supportive data generated under accelerated or stress conditions suggest that the 
stability-indicating methods are CDC activity, GD2 binding and CD16 binding, in addition to CIEX-HPLC 
(with an increase in acidic and basic forms). Additional stability data have also been provided for the 
reference standard SR-951PI.1 (up to 24 months). 
Finished product 
The finished product is manufactured by thawing the active substance, followed by a sterile filtration and 
aseptic filling into sterile glass vials. A slight overfill (4.9 mL) is made to allow extraction of 4.5 mL 
finished product. The finished product is filled into type I glass vials, sealed with a bromobutyl stopper and 
aluminium crimp. The container closure system is demonstrated to be suitable for dinutuximab finished 
product using methylene blue challenge studies and stability studies. Finished product manufacturing and 
process control are acceptable.  
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 32/129 
 
 
 
 
Process validation for the 4 commercial scale batches was satisfactory, although it is noted that two of 
these were retrospective and two were prospective process validation batches.  
The initial formulation in early clinical studies was phosphate-buffered saline, but this has been changed 
to 20 mM histidine, 5% sucrose and 0.01% polysorbate 20, pH 6.0. Excipients are all Ph. Eur. quality. The 
finished product is a sterile concentrate for solution for infusion, diluted into commercial 0.9% sodium 
chloride and 1% human albumin. 
The proposed product specification is satisfactory, following revision of the acceptance criteria for potency 
and purity. 
Stability studies were provided to support the long term storage conditions at 5 ± 3°C. This includes 3 
batches of finished product (GMP1, GMP2 and GMP3) manufactured using the proposed commercial 
process (v.2.1) with stability data up to 30 months and supportive data from one batch of finished product 
(T110) manufactured using process v.2.0, up to 36 months. This is sufficient to support the claimed shelf 
life of 24 months at 5 ± 3°C. Supportive data has also been provided under accelerated and stress 
conditions for finished product. Batches manufactured using process v.1.0 in the previous formulation 
(PBS) also demonstrated good stability under long term storage conditions, although an increase in 
HMWS and LMWS was found with this original formulation. 
In relation to adventitious agents, microbial/non-viral adventitious agents are appropriately controlled. 
No animal-derived raw materials are used during production. The MCB is adapted to serum-free medium; 
sufficient information is given regarding the animal materials used before establishment of the MCB. 
Testing for adventitious agents and viral safety was satisfactory for the MCB, WCB and end-of-production 
cells (EPC).  
Virus validation studies were conducted to demonstrate that the manufacturing process is capable of 
inactivating/removing any potential viruses and adventitious agents with an acceptable safety margin. 
The virus validation reports provide sufficient details of the process parameters, limits and validity of the 
small scale models used in the studies. Virus validation has not been performed using aged resin for 
Q-Sepharose chromatography, but this will be limited to a maximum of 10 runs based on the small scale 
column lifetime studies, or until the chromatography resin expiry date. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Overall, the quality of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron is considered to be in line with the quality of other 
approved monoclonal antibodies. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines. The fermentation and purification of the active substance 
are adequately described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised with regard 
to its physicochemical and biological characteristics, using state-of-the-art methods, and appropriate 
specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been satisfactorily described 
and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test methods and 
specifications. 
Viral safety and the safety concerning other adventitious agents including TSE have been sufficiently 
assured. 
The overall quality of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron is considered acceptable when used in accordance with 
the conditions defined in the SmPC.

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommended a point for investigation:  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The non-clinical development programme of ch14.18/CHO did not follow the pre-specified, 
ICH-dependent path. Various non-clinical data were generated within academic studies. In addition to 
these available non-clinical data from the literature, APEIRON performed pharmacodynamic studies to 
further elucidate the mode of action as well as studies to define a relevant animal species in order to 
further access pharmacokinetics and toxicity of ch14.18/CHO. 
The majority of data which are available from published papers have been generated with older 
development branches of GD2-specific antibodies, namely the monoclonal mouse antibody 14G.2a and 
the chimeric mouse-human antibody ch14.18/SP2/0. Therefore, comparability of ch14.18/SP2/0 and 
ch14.18/CHO in regards to in vitro binding affinity, specificity, effector functions like 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and 
pharmacokinetics in mice has been investigated. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Table 1: The primary pharmacology data submitted in support of this application are 
summarised in the table below. 
In vitro studies 
Binding constants of ch14.18/CHO as well as 14G.2a (a fully murine version of ch14.18/CHO) to its 
antigen GD2 (Study No. 01-2014). 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 34/129 
 
 
 
 
 
Three experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, binding of ch14.18/CHO (batch T651204), 
14G.2a, rituximab (as unspecific control) and an isotyope control were compared at concentrations of 
25.0, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.5, 0.75, 0.37 and 0.0 μg/ml.  
Binding curves for ch14.18/CHO and 14G.2a were similar. They showed mostly the same shape while 
affinity of ch14.18/CHO apparently was slightly lower when compared with 14G.2a (EC50: 4.5 and 3.1 
μg/ml for ch14.18/CHO and 14G.2a respectively). Specificity of the assay was confirmed with a murine 
IgG2a isotype control as well as with the chimeric antibody rituximab which both did not show binding 
activity. 
In the second experiment, 10 μg/ml of antibody were exposed to decreasing amounts of the anti-idiotypic 
antibody gangliodiomab, starting at 43 μg/mL down to 0.33 μg/mL. Binding of ch14.18/CHO and 14G.2a 
to their target antigen GD2 was, as expected, inhibited by increasing amounts of the anti-idiotypic 
antibody gangliodiomab. Curve shapes were very similar, confirming that despite several differences 
between the constant domains of ch14.18/CHO and 14G.2a, both antibodies showed similar inhibition of 
GD2-binding by Gangliodiomab. 
In the third experiment, it was determined that KD, ka and kd values were very similar for the two 
ch14.18/CHO batches (T65 and T90). Moreover, the measured values are within the expected ranges for 
mid to high affinity, monoclonal antibodies targeting cell surface antigens for tumour therapies.  
Binding curves of ch14.18 prepared from CHO, NS0 and SP2/0 cells to its antigen GD2 (Zeng et al.2005). 
Bibliographic data is cited where the binding of ch14.18 preparations from CHO, NS0 and SP2/0 cells and 
Mabthera/Rituximab as a negative control to gangliosides was determined in solid phase ELISAs. Results 
indicate a highly specific binding of all ch14.18 antibody preparations (with similar affinities) to 
ganglioside GD2 in contrast to the anti-CD20 mAb controls. 
Binding of APN311 to GD2-expressing tumour cell lines LAN-1 and M21 (Study No. 01-2014) 
The aim of this study was to confirm GD2 expression on LAN-1 (human neuroblastoma cell line) and M21 
(human melanoma cell line) cell lines via flow cytometry. Results indicated that APN311 strongly 
interacted with both cell lines in comparison to the isotype control indicating that both cell lines express 
GD2. This would enable subsequent use of these cells lines to be used to measure APN311-mediated 
effector function. 
Effector Function Studies (all reported within Study No. 01-2014) 
An experiment was conducted to determine the ch14.18/CHO-triggered CDC activity against the 
GD2-expressing cell lines LAN-1 and M21 (human melanoma cell line) in vitro. In this study, 51Cr-labeled 
LAN-1 or M21 cells were used as target cells. Human serum (1:5 final dilution) derived from healthy donor 
served as the effector source. Following treatment, radioactivity which is proportional to the release 
of 51Cr after cell lysis was measured in all samples and expressed in counts per minute (cpm). Results 
were calculated as % lysis subtracting the cpms of spontaneous lysis (background) from all sample values 
and relating to the cpm of the maximal achievable lysis (with a surfactant) which is set to 100%. APN311 
showed strong lysis of the GD2-positive cell lines LAN-1 and M21 via complement-mediated cytotoxicity. 
Calculated EC50 values were 157 and 138 ng/ml, respectively. 
Antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) 
In the same study, it was determined if there was ch14.18/CHO-triggered ADCC activity against the GD2- 
expressing cell lines LAN-1 and M21. Here, human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC; effector to 
target cell ratio 30:1 for M21 and 5:1 for LAN-1 cells) derived from healthy donor, heparinized whole 
blood served as the effector source. The concentration range of ch14.18/CHO (batch T110) tested was 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 35/129 
 
 
 
 
1-400 ng/mL and 20-1200 ng/mL on LAN-1 and M21 cells, respectively. APN311 had EC50 values of 2.0 
and 4.1 ng/mL for ADCC on LAN-1 and M21 cells, respectively. 
Whole blood cytolytic activity (WBT) 
Finally, in addition to the two standard effector function assays, CDC and ADCC, the whole blood cytolytic 
activity test (WBT) was established to better mimic the in vivo physiology by using naïve healthy 
volunteer- (in vitro) or treated patient-derived (ex vivo) whole blood samples. APN311 had EC50 values 
of 65 and 140 ng/mL in a whole blood mediated cytolytic assay performed on LAN-1 and M21 cells, 
respectively. 
Effector Function Studies (reported within (Zeng et al. 2005) 
Zeng et al. reported that CDC mediated by the different ch14.18 preparations were mAb concentration 
dependent and specific, since chimeric anti-CD20 mAb (rituximab) used as a non-specific control was 
ineffective. Identical CDC activity of ch14.18/CHO compared to ch14.18/SP2/0 was evident. However, 
results suggested a lower CDC activity of ch14.18/NS0. In the same paper, it was reported that the ADCC, 
effect was dependent on time and correlated with the mAb concentration. The ADCC effect mediated by 
ch14.18/CHO was superior to that of ch14.18/SP2/0 and ch14.18/NS0 by a factor of 2 at low mAb 
concentrations (0.001–0.0003 μg/ml) (p < 0.01). The ch14.18/NSO mAb preparation was less effective 
in antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) than ch14.18/CHO or ch14.18 SP2/0 at lower mAb 
concentrations (<1.0 μg/ml). Results suggest that there may be an improved ADCC effect with 
ch14.18/CHO at low antibody titres. 
A reduction of fucose content within the glycosylation site of antibody Fc domains is reported (Suzuki et 
al. 2007) to result in an increase of ADCC activity due to higher affinity binding of the fucose-reduced 
antibody to the FcgammaRIIIa receptor on natural killer cells.  
In vivo studies 
Anti-Tumour Activity of ch14.18/CHO and ch14.18/NS0 in a Syngeneic Tumour Mouse Model (Zeng et al. 
2005) 
The purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the anti-tumour effect of ch14.18/CHO and 
ch14.18/NS0 in vivo. Therefore, a syngeneic, neuroblastoma cell, liver metastasis mouse model was 
used. Liver tumour burden was a measure for the therapeutic effect 28 days after tumour inoculation. 
In this study 1 x 105 murine NXS2 neuroblastoma (NB) tumour cells were i.v. injected into the tail vein of 
female A/J mice (n = 6 per group). One group was untreated, the other groups were treated from Day 3 
post-tumour inoculation for 5 consecutive days with i.v. injected PBS (vehicle control), 100 or 300 μg/day 
ch14.18/CHO (4 or 12mg/kg/day) or ch14.18/NS0. Another group was treated identically at 300 μg/day 
ch14.18/CHO but received 50 μl i.p. anti-Asialo GM1 antiserum on Days -2, 4 and 10 before/after tumour 
cell inoculation in order to deplete NK-cells. Mice were sacrificed on Day 28 or when they became 
moribund. The therapeutic effect was determined by analysis of hepatic tumour burden measured as wet 
liver weights. 
Dose-dependent and antigen specific suppression of metastases was demonstrated in mice treated with 
ch14.18. The treatment at the dosage of 300 μg ch14.18/day reduced neuroblastoma liver metastasis, as 
indicated by a decrease of the liver weight from 2.3 g±0.3 g (PBS controls) to 1.1 g±0.1 g (ch14.18/CHO 
treated mice) and 1.3 g±0.3 g (ch14.18/NS0) (p > 0.05). The latter two values are superimposable to 
those found in healthy control animals. As expected, the effect of ch14.18/CHO treatment was not 
statistically different from that obtained upon treatment with ch14.18/NSO (p > 0.1). The specificity of 
ch14.18 therapy was demonstrated, since treatment with an equivalent amount of non-specific 
anti-CD20 antibody was completely ineffective. Notably, this control antibody binds to the human B-cell

associated CD20 molecule with no cross-reactivity to murine CD20. A reduction of liver metastasis was 
also achieved at 100 μg ch14.18/day but to a lower extent compared to 300 μg/day. The liver weight 
decreased from 2.2 g±0.4 g (PBS) to only 1.5 g±0.4 g (ch14.18/CHO) and 1.9±0.2 g (ch14.18/NS0), 
respectively, but the differences were statistically not significant (p > 0.05). Finally, the depletion of 
NK-cells resulted in complete abrogation of the therapeutic effect of ch14.18/CHO, indicating the critical 
role of NK-cells, likely mediating ADCC in the ch14.18/CHO induced anti-neuroblastoma immune 
response. Comparable efficacies of ch14.18/CHO and ch14.18/NS0 were expected since the advantage of 
the increased ADCC activity of APN311 is not relevant in mice. Furthermore, there was no evidence of 
toxicity in mice treated with ch14.18/CHO as indicated by a stable body weight after treatment with 
ch14.18/CHO. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been performed. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No stand-alone safety pharmacology studies have been performed. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were submitted. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No classical absorption/distribution/metabolism/excretion (ADME) studies have been performed with 
APN311. The pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of APN311 was investigated in a GLP absorption study after 
single intravenous (i.v.) 24-hr infusion of APN311 to male Guinea pigs (Study No. 29338). Furthermore, 
the toxicokinetic (TK) profile of APN311 was characterised as part of a GLP repeat-dose toxicity study in 
Guinea pigs (Study No. 29339).  
Following a single administration of the DP to male guinea pigs, APN311 Cmax and exposure exhibited 
dose-dependent, linear pharmacokinetics over the administered dose range of 1.25 (= 10 mg/m2), 6.25 
(= 50 mg/m2) and 12.5 mg/kg (=100 mg/m2). The terminal half-lives were similar (ca. 40 h) between 
doses with a slight trend towards increasing values with increased dose.

In the repeated dose toxicology study; the 10-day infusion of APN311 to male and female guinea pigs had 
to be terminated prematurely at the end of Cycle 2 dosing because of a high number of unscheduled 
death/moribund animals seen in all dose groups (see toxicology section below). The causes of 
death/preliminary termination were reportedly due to valvular/thrombotic endocarditis (as a result of the 
long-term infusion induced injection site changes and/or post-surgical trauma/infection) as well as 
rupture of infusion catheter. Therefore only TK data could be generated for the first dosing cycle: APN311 
Cmax and exposure exhibited dose-dependent, near to linear pharmacokinetics over the administered 
dose range of 1.25, 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg/day after 10 consecutive days of dosing. 
No clear sex differences in exposure levels were observed. Comparison of single versus repeated dose PK 
parameters in males revealed similar Cmax levels but ca. 3-4-fold lower exposure (AUC) levels after the 
10-day infusion regimen counteracting the anticipated accumulative effects of repeat infusions. This was 
likely due to the potential early onset of an anti-ch14.18/CHO antibody response. Indeed the occurrence 
of anti-drug antibodies was confirmed for Day 34 samples of the study, but no early samples (e.g. Day 
10) have been measured. 
A GLP, 10-day repeat-dose toxicity in Cynomolgus monkey with daily, 4-hr continuous i.v. infusions of 
ch14.17/CHO has been conducted and reported under Study No. 31743. Cmax levels of ~ 20 fold the 
levels observed in humans are reported. Serum levels and AUC values revealed a dose-related, linear 
exposure with no sex differences. 
Table 3: Pharmacokinetic parameters of ch14.18/CHO during a 10-day, daily 4-hr i.v. infusion to 
Cynomolgus monkeys (Study No. 31743) (Days 1-15) 
No studies on metabolism have been performed.  
Following a pilot study (Study No. 29355), in vitro cross-reactivity studies in Guinea pig (Study No. 
30666) and human tissues (Study No. 2014-AP-001) were conducted. A further tissue cross-reactivity 
study was conducted with a panel of tissues derived from the cynomolgus monkey (Study No. 31882). 
The staining pattern in both species followed the expected expression pattern of GD2 on central and 
peripheral nerves and organ innervations structures.

2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No stand alone, acute toxicity studies have been conducted. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
The toxicology program conducted with APN311 consists of one GLP intravenous (continuous i.v. infusion) 
repeat-dose toxicity study with APN311 (0, 1.25, 6.25 and 12.5 mg/kg/day = 10, 50, 100 mg/m2/day) 
conducted in juvenile Guinea pigs (7 wks at start of first dose).

- Myeloid hyperplasia of the bone marrow 
The administration scheme (cyclic administration) mimicked exactly the clinical administration scheme; 
10 consecutive days of continuous i.v. infusion followed by a 25-day off-period before the next 10 
consecutive days of dosing started. Dosing was stopped at the end of Cycle 2 because a high number of 
animals were terminated prematurely/found dead, with comparable numbers of deaths amongst control 
and test item groups. The causes of death/preliminary termination were valvular/thrombotic endocarditis 
(as a result of the long-term infusion induced injection site changes and/or post-surgical 
trauma/infection) as well as rupture of infusion catheter. Due to the high mortality during the study, the 
amount of animals in satellite and recovery groups is sometimes limited to one. Drug-related toxicities 
comprising of clinical signs, body weight and food consumption decrease, changes in haematology and 
bone marrow findings are said to be well in accordance with the expected toxicities of ch14.18/CHO, i.e. 
induction of pain by binding to peripheral nerve tissue structures (resulting in the observed, 
dose-dependent clinical signs, food and body weight decreases) and interference with the hematopoietic 
system/bone marrow. However, repeated administration of APN311 resulted in the induction of anti-drug 
antibodies interfering with the pharmacokinetics of ch14.18/CHO as well as possibly compensating 
ch14.18/CHO-induced clinical signs and haematologic changes. At the end of the recovery period all 
changes noted during the treatment period had subsided beside a reduction in absolute and relative liver 
organ weight and a still increased myeloid:erythroid ratio in high dose (100 mg/m2/day) males. Under the 
present test conditions the NOAEL is judged to be 1.25 mg/kg/day (10 mg/m2/day) as the observed 
changes at that dose level are associated with the pharmacodynamic mode of action of a GD2-targeting, 
ADCC/CDC-triggering antibody. The MTD is 12.5 mg/kg/day (100 mg/m2/day).  
The results of a GLP-compliant, repeat-dose toxicity in Cynomolgus monkey with daily, 4-hr continuous 
i.v. infusions of ch14.17/CHO has been submitted (Study 31743): 0, 30 (3x human dose) and 100 
mg/m2/day (10x human dose) APN311 were administered to groups of 6 Cynomolgus monkeys

(n=3/sex/group main study, n=2/sex/group recovery) for 10 consecutive days and termination of 
animals on Day 15 (i.e. 5 days after start of final dosing on Day 10; main study animals) and Day 36 
(recovery group). Cmax levels of ~ 20 fold the levels observed in humans are reported. Serum levels and 
AUC values revealed a dose-related, linear exposure with no sex differences. The dosing schedule was in 
line with FDA advice received in 2014 and reflects the proposed 10-day clinical dosing regimen with 
adequate human safety margins. Two unscheduled deaths occurred in the high dose group on Day 14 and 
the cause remains inconclusive, although it is stated that both animals had shown moderate to severe 
reduction in overall activity for period of 7 or 12 days before death. In addition reduction in thymus sizes 
and reddening of the caecum mucosa were noted. Underactivity and reduction of thymus size was also 
observed in all other high-dose animals. Other drug-related toxicities included reduction in body weight 
and food consumption; bone marrow changes including atrophy of myeloid and erythroid precursor cell 
lineages were also observed. These findings were expected toxicities of ch14.18/CHO, i.e. induction of 
pain and interference with the hematopoietic system. Beside reduction of thymus size observed in one 
high dose female, animals recovered from all findings during the 4-week recovery period. The 
no-observed-adverse effect level (NOAEL) was determined to be 30 mg/m2/day, as was the maximum 
tolerated dose. Results from in vitro cross-reactivity studies using cynomolgus monkey tissue (as well as 
guinea pig and human tissue) served to validate the cynomolgus monkey as a relevant toxicology 
species; with tissue binding of the antibody 14.G2a (predictive for APN311) limited to some neuronal 
tissues, including cerebellum, cerebrum, and peripheral nerves, as well as external and internal 
innervation structures of non-neuronal tissue types. 
Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies have been conducted. 
Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted. 
The applicant has included the histopathological results of the analysis of the reproductive organs in 
Guinea Pigs and in Cynomolgus monkey. No APN311 related effects on reproduction organs in guinea pig 
and cynomolgus monkey were reported. 
The mammary gland in female animals was missing in 6/11 animals compared to 1/11 in controls. 
Mammary gland in guinea pig seemed to be present according to the gross pathological examination, but 
during histopathological examinations it was absent.  
Toxicokinetic data 
APN311 Cmax and exposure exhibited dose-dependent, but not fully linear pharmacokinetics over the 
administered dose range after 10 consecutive days of dosing. No clear sex differences in exposure levels 
were observed. Comparison of pharmacokinetic parameters measured in the PK study after a single 
24-hour i.v. infusion of ch14.18/CHO to male Guinea pigs with PK parameters obtained after the 10-day 
continuous i.v. infusion in Cycle 1 revealed similar Cmax levels but ca. 3-4-fold lower exposure (AUC) 
levels after the 10-day infusion regimen.

Local Tolerance  
No local tolerance studies have been conducted. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No environmental risk assessment studies were submitted for dinutuximab beta. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical package presented is based on repeat dose studies in the guinea pig and the cynomolgus 
monkey as relevant species, supported by toxicokinetic data in both species as well as in vitro tissue 
cross-reactivity studies in guinea pig, cynomolgus monkey and human tissues which served to validate 
the toxicology species.  
The in vitro pharmacology studies are generally supportive of the proposed indication. Binding constants 
of ch14.18/CHO as well as 14G.2a (a fully murine version of ch14.18/CHO) to its antigen GD2 were 
determined in a series of experiments. Binding curves for ch14.18/CHO and 14G.2a were similar. Binding 
curves of ch14.18 prepared from CHO, NS0 and SP2/0 cells were also shown to be comparable. Further 
in vitro results demonstrated that APN311 showed strong lysis of the GD2-positive cell lines LAN-1 and 
M21 via complement-mediated cytotoxicity. 
The majority of data which are available from published literature data have been generated with the 
older development branches of GD2-specific antibodies. Therefore the comparability of ch14.18/SP2/0 
and ch14.18/CHO in regards to in vitro binding affinity, specificity, effector functions like 
complement-dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) is 
accepted based on the in vitro data presented thus far.  
In vivo biodistribution data has been generated with 125I-labeled ch14.18/CHO in neuroblastoma-bearing, 
female A/J mice (Ladenstein, R., et al., 2013). This in vivo data, together with in vitro tissue cross 
reactivity data in non-human primates supports the therapeutic profile of the proposed product. 
In the guinea pig 10-day repeated dose toxicology study, toxicokinetic analyses are hampered by several 
factors: early formation of ADA resulting in rapid decline of plasma levels during infusion and possibly 
interference in the assay, unexplained higher plasma levels at the end of cycle 2 as compared to end of 
cycle 1, limited measurements after cycle 2 due to mortalities in the satellite group of the repeated dose 
toxicity study, and detection of ADA in control animals using a validated method but not using a 
non-validated method. 
Not only toxicokinetic satellite animals died during the study, also main animals in all groups did not last 
longer than 2 cycles. This was probably due to the method of administration, which was not suitable for 
Guinea pigs. As a consequence of mortalities and formation of ADA and therefore lack of exposure, only 
the first cycle is taken into account for the safety assessment of APN311. 
During the procedure, the applicant submitted a repeat dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys. In 
contrast to the expectations of 3 cycles as per ICH guidance ICH S9, only one cycle of repeated dosing in 
the monkey was conducted. This has been justified based on clinical signs (underactivity) and body 
weight loss observed during the 10 day dosing period. It is stated that the signs most probably relate to 
acute pain induction due to the test item targeting GD2 within the peripheral nerve system. It is accepted 
that continued dosing would not be justified based on the above toxicities and furthermore it is stated that 
no additional toxicities would be expected to arise due to repeated cycles other than that related to pain

Page 41/129 
 
 
 
 
 
as histopathological changes in the peripheral nervous system or innervations structures of non-neuronal 
tissues were observed. In addition literature data support the view that pain (also observed in humans) 
is acute rather than chronic. Prolonged dosing in the guinea pig resulted in an immune response and it is 
theorised by the applicant that this too is likely to have occurred in the non-human primate. Further 
reassurance is given as the clinical database does not appear to indicate long term neurotoxic effects 
following ch14.18-based neuroblastoma therapy. It is concluded that no further non-clinical dosing can be 
expected. 
Findings of note in the repeat-dose toxicity regimens included changes (decrease) in thymus weight as 
well as bone marrow changes (atrophy affecting myeloid and erythroid precursor cell lines). The bone 
marrow changes were slight to severe and recovered after cessation of dosing. No effects on 
cardiovascular functions (ECG, blood pressure) were observed in monkeys (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
The absence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies is agreed since APN311 is an antibody not 
expected to interact with DNA or to be carcinogenic. No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies 
have been performed with APN311. In the repeat-dose toxicity studies in Guinea pigs and cynomolgus 
monkeys, no adverse effects of dinutuximab beta were observed on reproductive organs at exposure 
levels above clinical levels (see section 5.3 of the SmPC). 
The target of APN311, GD2, is expressed on neuronal tissues especially during embryofetal development 
and taking into account the potential of placental transfer of antibodies; APN311 may cause foetal harm 
when administered to pregnant women. Moreover, retinoic acid, a concomitant drug administered during 
APN311 treatment, is a well-known, potential teratogen. In addition, considering the type of disease and 
overall clinical conditions/treatment of the patients as well as the fact that the main patient population (≥ 
90%) intended to receive treatment with APN311 is below an age of 10 years, pregnancy seems to be an 
unlikely event to occur during treatment with APN311. Considering the above arguments, the lack of 
specific reproduction toxicity studies with APN311 is accepted. 
The finding on the mammary gland in female animals is of possible concern. The applicant noted, that it 
is possible that although during processing it seems to be present, but it turns out not to be mammary 
gland tissue upon histopathological examination. Furthermore, the applicant argued that in 10-40% of 
small and juvenile animal’s mammary gland tissue cannot be found. In this case, it is 60% of the animals, 
which exceeds the 40%. However, since the development of the mammary gland in cynomolgus monkeys 
exposed to higher levels of APN311 is similar to control animals, the effect on mammary gland in guinea 
pig, is likely not relevant for human. 
A lower exposure (AUC) was observed after 10 day-continuous infusion regimen compared to a single 
24-hour i.v. infusion of ch14.18/CHO. In contrast, one would have been expected higher values due to 
accumulation effects comparing same daily dose levels. However, this observation can be explained by a 
potential early onset of an anti-ch14.18/CHO antibody response, compensating for ch14.18/CHO 
accumulation effects and resulting in an increased clearance or interfering with the ELISA method. The 
occurrence of anti-drug antibodies was confirmed for Day 34 samples of the study, but no early samples 
(e.g. Day 10) have been measured. 
It can be, therefore, expected that the formation of anti-ch14.18/CHO antibody rendered the 
toxicokinetics and extent of the toxicities reported for ch14.18/CHO in the Guinea pigs largely 
underestimated and hence the reported clinical safety margins not representative. 
In accordance with the Guideline on Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human use 
[CHMP/SWP/4447/00], proteins are exempt from the need to conduct environmental risk assessment 
studies. Therefore, no environmental risk assessment studies were provided.

2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to the approval of the proposed product from a non-clinical perspective. The long 
term dosing schedule in the toxicology species was not in line with the requirements of ICH S9; however 
for the reasons discussed above – no further dosing in the toxicology species can be justified.

NA = not applicable, OL = open label, R/R = relapsed/refractory, TBD = to be determined. 
The main study is a retrospective data collection from the compassionate use of the product in a single 
centre where a heterogeneous population of patients with neuroblastoma was treated. The supportive 
studies are investigator-sponsored Phase I/II trials to evaluate primarily the safety, pharmacokinetics, 
and pharmacodynamics of the product. All these trials have enrolled patients with relapsed/refractory 
neuroblastoma. 
The only controlled trial is the ongoing first-line trial in high risk neuroblastoma conducted by the 
International Society of Paediatric Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma (SIOPEN), which evaluates the 
effects of adding IL-2 to ch14.18/CHO and 13-cis RA. During the procedure, interim data have been 
submitted in the form of a CSR following a retrospective SAP (cut-off date 22 January 2016). An updated 
analysis of the same study has also been submitted during the procedure (cut-off date 05 September 
2016).  
Results from study APN311-301 have also been submitted by the Applicant. This study, which aimed at 
comparing 13-cis-RA treatment to 13-cis-RA treatment plus ch14.18/CHO therapy in high risk 
neuroblastoma, was stopped after the publication of the US COG trial and had enrolled 34 patients only. 
No conclusion can be drawn from the provided study results. 
All studies included mainly paediatric and also some adolescent patients. Most received ch14.18/CHO 
treatment in combination with IL-2 and 13-cis-RA except for the control arm of the first-line trial 
(APN311-302) and the trial after haploidentical stem cell transplantation (APN311-201). Finally, two 
studies investigated a continuous infusion paradigm (APN311-202 and -303). 
PK and PD assessments were part of the general study design of the clinical APN311 studies in patients 
with refractory/relapsed (R/R) neuroblastoma (APN311-101, 201, 202, and 303). PD assessments 
included determination of complement-dependent and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity 
(CDC and ADCC), analysis of cytolytic activity in whole blood (whole blood cytolytic activity test [WBT]), 
and analysis of activated white blood cells. In addition, the occurrence of human anti-chimeric antibodies 
(HACA) was determined. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Data are available from three studies described below. 
APN311-101 
Patients received three 28-day treatment cycles, each consisting of 5 consecutive days of 8-hr 
intravenous infusions with ch14.18/CHO (monotherapy). Although three doses were tested (10, 20 and 
30 mg/m2/day, data were only provided for the medium dose of 20 mg/m2/day, i.e. a cumulative dose of 
100 mg/m2 per cycle. 
APN311-202 
Ch14.18/CHO was applied from Day 8 to 18 of each 35-day cycle as a 10-day continuous infusion of 100 
mg/m2 per cycle. Concomitant treatment with interleukin 2 (IL-2) at the dose of 6x106 IU/m²/day was 
given on Days 1-5 and Days 8-12 of each cycle. Cis-retinoic acid (cis-RA) was applied for 14 days starting 
at cycle Day 22 at the dose of 160 mg/m2/day.

The treatment was applied for 5 cycles but PK data are available for the first cycle only. This study started 
with a dose schedule finding phase and the first patient cohort was allocated to receive 100 mg/m² over 
10 days (the established dose already applied in previous studies based on an 8h-short infusion scheme). 
Only this dosing schedule was evaluated because it was considered the suitable ch14.18/CHO infusion 
dose based on pre-defined PD and PK endpoints. Therefore, it was also used for the confirmatory 
expansion cohort. 
APN311-303 
The same dosing regimen as in the previous trial was applied (the initial 4 patients received a slightly 
different treatment regimen). A total of up to 6 cycles was given but PK data were provided for 5 
treatment cycles. 
The PK parameters for the first treatment cycle in the three studies are summarised below.

The PK characteristics of ch14.18/CHO are summarised hereafter. 
Absorption 
 Dinutuximab beta is dosed via the IV route and therefore is completely bioavailable. 
Bioequivalence 
Ch14.18/CHO was manufactured at 3 different sites. No bioequivalence studies were conducted but 
pharmacokinetic parameters of ch14.18/CHO were in general comparable between studies APN311-202 
and -303. 
Distribution 
Peak levels were generally reached at the end of the 10-day infusion; the mean Cmax was 13 µg/mL in 
Cycle 1. 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 45/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The volume of distribution is stated to be 5- 6.5 L/m2. 
Elimination 
No excretion or metabolism studies have been submitted. 
The half-life observed in studies 1 and 2 was in the range of 190 hours, i.e. 8 days (see section 5.2 of the 
SmPC). 
Dose proportionality 
In the publication of study APN311-202 (Ladenstein, 2013), pharmacokinetics appeared roughly 
proportional over the dose range of 10 to 30 mg/m2/day. 
There are limited data to assess dose proportionality. Following the 5 x 8-hour infusion regimen and the 
10-day continuous infusion, Cmax was roughly similar (only slightly lower with the 10-day infusion 
compared to the same total dose administered as 5 short infusions). 
Time dependency 
There appears to be possible time dependency in the data presented with an increase in half-life with a 
longer duration of dosing. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
Inter-individual variability is high with a CV of 46.5% on clearance from the study utilising an 8-hour 
infusion. This is surprising for a drug given intravenously. A non-compartmental re-analysis of the data 
from studies APN311-202 and -303 is required and should include an assessment of inter-individual 
variability. Intra-individual variability should also be assessed in a PopPK analysis. 
Special populations 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis conducted on the data obtained with the initial non validated 
assays was used to investigate the important covariates on PK. The relationship for clearance and volume 
of distribution (Vd) with weight is with the expected exponents of 1.0 and 0.75, respectively. Gender did 
not have a significant impact on the pharmacokinetics. The assay for anti-drug antibody is also not 
considered robust; however, the suggestion is an effect on Vd, but not clearance. 
There are no data in patients with renal or hepatic impairment. This would not be expected for a 
monoclonal antibody. In the PopPK analysis markers of renal and hepatic clearance (eGFR and bilirubin) 
did not show a relationship with exposure (Cmax and AUC24h on day 1 and day 10 during a 10-day 
infusion). 
The exposure (Cmax and AUC24h on day 1 and day 10 during a 10 day infusion) is predicted to be similar 
in subjects with ages less than or equal to 12 years and decreases slightly for older, heavier subjects. 
Effects of age was not found to influence the pharmacokinetics of dinutuximab beta. 
The posology of APN311 is based on mg/m2 which suggests clearance increases linearly with BSA, this is 
consistent with the relationship of clearance on weight. 
There are very limited data in children less than 2 years of age. 
An effect of ADA formation on the volume of distribution was found (increase of 37% in volume). 
Therefore, ADA formation would be predicted to have a slight impact (less than 10% decrease) on 
exposure within 24 hours after administration, under non steady state conditions. After reaching steady 
state, no difference in exposure is predicted, with and without ADA formation.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No interaction studies have been performed. Ch14.18/CHO has been co-administered with IL-2 in the two 
PK studies with continuous infusions. 
It has been shown in study APN311-201 that APN311 induced the release of cytokines, in particularly IL-6 
and TNFα.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ch14.18/CHO was shown in vitro to specifically bind to GD2 with similar binding affinities compared to 
ch14.18/SP2/0 or ch14.18/NS0. This was expected as the variable regions of the antibodies are identical. 
Ganglioside GD2 is a glycolipid antigen devoid of an intracellular signal transduction domain. Therefore, 
the mechanism of action of anti-GD2 mAbs mostly relies on immune effector functions like CDC and 
ADCC. CDC is induced through binding of a serine protease complex C1 to the Fc domains of two or more 
mAb molecules binding to antigens expressed on tumour cells. This classical complement pathway results 
in an activation cascade resulting in a membrane attack complex disrupting the target cell. ADCC is a 
result of Fc-gamma receptor (FcγR) mediated interaction with effector immune cells such as NK cells, 
macrophages and granulocytes. The binding of the FcγR to the Fc domain induces both release of 
granzymes and perforin from effector cells leading to a target cell lysis and Fc-dependent tumour cell 
phagocytosis. 
The reason for combining IL-2 to ch14.18 was because it stimulates the proliferation, growth and 
activation of natural killer cells, generates lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells, and therefore 
augments ADCC. In the literature, in vitro studies with anti-GD2 antibodies and IL-2 have demonstrated 
that the addition of IL-2 enhanced the lysis of GD2-expressing cells as compared to anti-GD2 antibody 
alone. IL-2 is also known to increase regulatory T cell function. 
PD marker results 
In the clinical APN311 studies, effects on pharmacodynamics parameters were investigated as secondary 
endpoints. These included ADCC, CDC, and whole blood cytolytic activity, absolute counts of immune 
cells, NK and T cell activation, and soluble IL-2 receptor as well as HACA analyses. Time points with most 
available data were D1 (before IL-2), D8 (3 days after the end of the first IL-2 course and before the 
second IL-2 course combined with ch14.18/CHO treatment), and Day 15 (3 days after the end of the 
second IL-2 course during ch14.18 treatment). Sufficient data at subsequent time points (from the end of 
ch14.18 (Day 18) until the end of the cycle) were only available in one trial. Therefore, the respective 
effects of IL-2 and CH14.18/CHO are difficult to disentangle. 
Effect on immune cells 
IL-2 induced an increase in the absolute count of leukocytes and lymphocytes, activated NK cells and their 
subsets (cytotoxic and cytokine producing NK cells), T cells and their subsets (regulatory, helper and 
cytotoxic); the increase in activated NK cells and T lymphocytes was prolonged so that the response to 
IL-2 was enhanced throughout the cycles. IL-2 also increased the proportion of regulatory T-cells at the 
expense of cytotoxic T-cells.

Figure 1 Mean values of activated NK cells as result of ch14.18/CHO treatment in combination 
with IL-2 and RA (study 202) 
In contrast to lymphocytes, granulocytes, especially neutrophils, seemed essentially unaffected by IL-2 
but increased during Ch14.18/CHO treatment although this effect seemed to diminish over the cycles. 
Finally, monocytes seemed marginally influenced by the two products. However, IL-2 appeared to 
activate granulocytes and monocytes although this effect also seemed to diminish over the cycles. 
The effect of ch14.18 on its own could be evaluated in study APN311-201 where it was administered alone 
(or followed by low doses of IL-2). Lymphocyte counts and activated CD56+CD16+ (cytokine-secreting 
and cytolytic) NK cells were substantially reduced after ch14.18/CHO administration and returned to 
pre-treatment levels afterwards. In line with these results, when ch14.18/CHO was administered after 
IL-2, lymphocyte counts decreased whereas activated NK cells plateaued or decreased before a slight 
rebound was observed; it might be speculated that activated NK cells migrate to the tumour site and are 
then replenished after a few days. 
Effector functions 
As expected, IL-2 on its own did not impact on CDC and ADCC activities, which were increased by 
ch14.18/CHO. With the assays used, the magnitude of the CDC effect was high compared to that of ADCC, 
which appeared to vary greatly amongst patients and tended to decrease after the first cycle to be almost 
abolished in the last cycle (cycle 5). It is noteworthy that this was observed in parallel with a decrease in 
neutrophils and activated granulocytes/monocytes, which are also involved in ADCC. 
As expected given the limited samples available, no strong correlation has been shown between FCγR or 
KIR/HLA KIR ligand and ADCC. Nevertheless, trends consistent with the literature on anti-GD2 were 
found, i.e. ADCC activity tended to be higher in patients with mismatched KIR/HLA-KIR compared with 
patients with matched KIR/HLA-KIR and in patients with high-affinity FcγR2A 131-H/H genotype 
compared to those with FcγR2A 131-R/R genotype. High-affinity FcγR2A 131-H/H genotype reflects 
neutrophil and macrophage ADCC and IL-2 treatment is known to induce release of GM-CSF by IL-2 
responsive cells, in turn stimulating these ADCC effector FcγR2A-bearing cells. The Applicant’s hypothesis 
that the decrease in ADCC over time, especially in patients with high affinity receptors, may be correlated 
with the decrease in tumour burden is plausible. 
To further assess the lysis capacity of ch14.18/CHO, a whole blood cytolytic activity test (WBT), 
mimicking in vivo physiology by using whole blood as the effector source and a GD2-positive LAN-1 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron

human neuroblastoma cell line as target cells. Cytolytic activity was increased after the administration of 
ch14.18/CHO (mean ~ 70%) and this response was abolished in the presence of ganglidiomab 
(anti-idiotypic antibody that neutralizes the binding of ch14.18/CHO to GD2), confirming that this 
response is mediated by ch14.18/CHO. In contrast with the ADCC activity, the WBT cytolytic activity was 
maintained throughout the five treatment cycles. It is usually postulated that ADCC is the main 
mechanism of action for anti-GD2 therapies, but these data would suggest that CDC may be an important 
contributor in vivo. 
Based on these data it cannot be concluded that IL-2 does not enhance the response to ch14.18/CHO as 
this should require comparing ch14.18/CHO alone and in combination with IL-2. The design of study 
APN311-201 where IL-2 was added after the administration of ch14.18/CHO at cycles 4 to 6 to minimize 
the risk of GvHD and at a much lower dose than that used in the other trials cannot address this question. 
Soluble IL-2 receptors are expected to be upregulated following IL-2 mediated stimulation of cells, 
resulting in a positive feedback loop. Indeed, the mean concentration of sIL2r peaked after IL-2 
application but the peak decreased over the cycles. A slight increase after ch14.18 alone was observed, 
which is not unexpected given that this is a marker for overall immune activation. 
HACAs 
Antibody generation against the GD2 antibody ch14.18/CHO may interfere with the functioning of the 
antibody and thus limit the efficacy of ch14.18/CHO treatment. Human anti-chimeric antibodies to 
ch14.18/CHO were determined; a new antibody binding assay was developed using 
electrochemiluminescence on the Meso Scale Discovery platform.  
Using this new assay, 65/105 (62%) of the patients developed ADAs; 11 out of 15 (73%) patients with 
data available were ADA positive in APN311-101, 27 out of 42 (64%) patients in APN311-202, and 27 out 
of 48 (56%) patients in APN311-303. No patient (out of the 32 analysed) was ADA positive in study 
APN311-201, because these patients were B-cell depleted following a CD3/CD19-depleted, hematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation. 
Overall, there was a trend towards a slight reduction of CDC, ADCC and WBT lysis capacity correlating 
with formation of an ADA response measured in samples from study APN311-303. This result is in 
alignment with predicted correlations between impact of ADA formation on serum APN311 levels (i.e. 
reduction in Cmax and AUC). There were no consistent relationships between ADA positivity and efficacy 
measure response, EFS and OS, across studies. There was no correlation between ADA positivity and 
TEAE. 
IL-2 is also known to be immunogenic and no data on anti-IL-2 antibodies have been provided. However, 
there was no apparent indication of a decrease in its main PD effects over the treatment cycles. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Ch14.18/CHO is a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal anti-GD2 IgG1 antibody produced in a mammalian 
CHO cell line. In the US, clinical studies have been conducted with ch14.18 produced in SP2/0 murine 
cells. The glycosylation pattern varies between ch14.18/CHO and ch14.18/SP2/0 due to the different 
production cell lines, and this may influence pharmacokinetics, efficacy and safety of the antibody in the 
treatment of neuroblastoma patients. 
No direct comparison between the two products has been conducted. Pharmacokinetics of ch14.18/CHO 
and ch14.18/SP2/0 were only compared across studies based on literature data for ch14.18/SP2/0 
(Uttenreuther-Fischer et al, 1995). It should be noted that there are differences in study design (e.g. 
administration of IgG before treatment with ch14.18/CHO, administration with GM-CSF for 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 49/129 
 
 
 
 
ch14.18/SP2/0, different doses) and ch14.18 analyses in serum were performed with different assays. 
Further, for both products inconsistencies in pharmacokinetic parameters between studies were reported. 
Therefore, this comparison between ch14.18/CHO and ch14.18/SP2/0 is of limited value with regard to 
bridging purposes. Since the efficacy of ch14.18/CHO was evaluated in comparison with historical 
controls that did not receive immunotherapy, the lack of adequate bridging between ch14.18/CHO and 
ch14.18/SP2/0 is no concern. 
Ch14.18/CHO has been manufactured at three different sites. The commercial product has not been used 
in any clinical study but quality data do support the comparability of these products. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetics of ch14.18/CHO has only been evaluated in paediatric patients with neuroblastoma, 
which is acceptable given the toxicity of the product. 
Dinutuximab beta is a protein for which the expected metabolic pathway is degradation to small peptides 
and individual amino acids by ubiquitous proteolytic enzymes. Classical biotransformation studies have 
not been performed. As the target for APN311 is a membrane-bound receptor, target-mediated 
degradation is also expected. 
The terminal half-life of APN311 could only be estimated in a fraction of subjects (less than half the 
subjects) as the elimination phase was not captured by the end of the cycle and the blood sampling times 
were not appropriate. Even for those individuals where a half-life was estimated, it is not considered that 
the fit for the data allowed for the calculation of a half-life. In the continuous infusion studies, a mean 
half-life of 8 days in Cycle 1 (vs. 4 days in the short-infusion study) is likely to be underestimated. It 
increased to 12 days in Cycle 4. In addition, exposure increased by approximately 50% by Cycle 5 and 
this would suggest a longer half-life than calculated by the Applicant. 
The volume of distribution is stated to be 5- 6.5 L/m2, which is consistent with what would be expected 
for a monoclonal antibody. However, in the PopPK analysis, it was estimated at 2L, which is unexpectedly 
low. 
Due to the issues encountered with the bioanalytical assays, PK data cannot be considered to be robust 
and therefore the conclusions from the data are limited. This has to be taken into consideration when 
interpreting PK parameters (Cmax, exposure, half-life) listed in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
A further investigation of PK has been requested in the context of a specific obligation (see Annex II). 
The objective of the first trial (APN311-101) was to bridge the PK profile of ch14.18/CHO to that of the 
previous ch14.18 produced in SP2/0 cells by comparison with literature data. The PK profile was 
considered sufficiently similar so that it was decided to pursue the clinical development of APN311 using 
the same daily dose as the other product, i.e. 20 mg/m2 (Ladenstein, 2013). In the publication, PK data 
were also provided for patients treated at 10 and 30 mg/m2/day (3 subjects each). No clear dose toxicity 
relation was observed, therefore, no firm conclusions on the optimal doses of ch14.18/CHO can be drawn. 
In the second dose-finding study (APN311-202), the starting dose was 100 mg/m² over 10 days, which 
was the established cumulative dose applied in previous studies with ch14.18 produced in other cells 
based on an 8h-short infusion scheme. Eventually, only this dosing schedule was evaluated because it 
was considered suitable based on pre-defined PD and PK endpoints, i.e. ch14.18/CHO concentration 
>1µg/ml at Day 15 of cycle 1 in ≥ 80 % of patients AND an increase of 500% and/or an absolute minimum 
increase to ≥100 cells/µL of the CD16/CD56 positive activated NK cells compared to baseline in ≥ 80 % 
of patients. It is noteworthy that all these PD criteria were based on literature data for IL-2.

A population pharmacokinetic analysis was conducted on the data obtained from studies APN311-101, 
-202 and -303 with the initial non validated assays. A number of covariates have been investigated, i.e. 
markers of renal and liver function, gender, age, body weight, BSA, ADA, infusion length and cycle 
number. Gender does not appear to have a significant effect. ADA seems a significant covariate on Vd but 
not clearance, suggesting a difference in exposure in the presence of ADA at earlier doses but not at 
steady state. The relationship for weight is consistent with dosing on an mg/m2 basis. Markers of renal 
and hepatic function, eGFR and BIL1 do not have a significant effect on exposure. There are insufficient 
data to support dosing of children less than 2 years. 
Ch14.18/CHO is considered to have a low potential for drug-drug interactions given its target and 
elimination profile. However, in study APN311-201, APN311 induced the release of cytokines, in 
particularly IL-6 and TNFα. Cytokines can affect expression levels of cytochrome P450s and IL-6 is known 
to decrease the activity of cytochrome P450. A risk for indirect reduction of CYP activity due to higher 
TNF-α and IL-6 levels and, therefore, interactions with concomitantly used medicinal products, cannot be 
excluded (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
Pharmacodynamics 
The mechanism of action of anti-GD2 mAbs and rationale for adding IL-2 is widely documented in the 
literature. A significant battery of tests has been deployed to evaluate the activities of the combination as 
reflected by the proliferation and activation of immune cells and their cytolytic effects on tumour cells. 
The results showed that cytolytic activity was durably elevated by ch14.18. It is noteworthy that this 
activity was abolished in a patient who developed HACAs. 
No data or discussion has been provided on the relationship between drug concentration and PD effects 
since the exposure data are not robust. In vitro studies indicate that ch14.18 can induce tumour cell lysis 
via CDC and ADCC at concentrations <1 µg/ml. For that reason a limit of measurable ch14.18/CHO level 
of at least 1 μg/mL could be understood although at day 15 the infusion with ch14.18/CHO is still ongoing 
and patients have considerably higher ch14.18/CHO serum concentrations at this time point than during 
days 20-35 of the cycle and up to day 8 of the next cycle. In study APN311-202, only 11/35 patients 
(31%) having received more than 40 mg/m² had trough concentrations (before the next infusion) at that 
level. Therefore, the validity of this target concentration for ch14.18/CHO at day 15 of cycle 1 is doubtful. 
The relationship between CD16/CD56 positive activated NK cells, which are involved in ADCC-mediated 
lysis of tumour cells, and the efficacy of ch14.18/CHO has been investigated. There was no clear 
correlation between CD16/CD56+ activated NK cell expression and tumour response rate but a trend 
towards longer overall survival in patients with high expression of CD16/CD56+ activated NK cells. 
In addition, the possible impact of genetic polymorphism of FcγR and KIR/KIR-Ligand on the PD response 
has been investigated. Trends consistent with the literature on anti-GD2 were found, i.e. ADCC activity 
tended to be higher in patients with mismatched KIR/HLA-KIR compared with patients with matched 
KIR/HLA-KIR and in patients with high-affinity FcγR2A 131-H/H genotype compared to those with FcγR2A 
131-R/R genotype. 
Compared to the in vitro CDC and whole blood cytolytic activity of ch14.18/CHO, higher ch14.18/CHO 
serum concentrations seem to be needed for maximal effect in the ex vivo CDC and whole blood cytolytic 
activity assay. The cytolytic activity was higher at day 15 than at day 1 of the next cycle while 
ch14.18/CHO serum concentrations were still > 1 µg/ml for most patients. Based on the in vitro results 
(maximal lysis at 1 µg/ml ch14.18 concentration) a maximal cytolytic effect would have been expected at 
Day 1 of cycles 2-5. However, no definite conclusion can be drawn since the exposure data are not robust.

The validated HACA assay appears to have poor drug tolerance and its results are not considered reliable. 
No neutralising assay is currently available. Nevertheless, it is noted that the majority of patients 
developed HACAs (56% to 73% depending on the studies) except in one study (APN311-201) because the 
patients were B-cell depleted following a CD3/CD19-depleted, hematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Upon CHMP request, the Applicant developed new analytical methods for drug and HACA measurement 
and will develop a neutralising assay. The validation reports showed major issues with drug–HACA 
interaction, and therefore, both drug and antibody measurements are not considered robust at the time 
being.  
The current analyses are considered exploratory only and further research post-authorisation will be 
needed to enable conclusive interpretations (see Annex II). 
The Applicant has provided theoretical arguments as to why the ch14.18/CHO molecule is unlikely to 
affect cardiac repolarisation. Furthermore, non-clinical and clinical data (ECG) collected so far did not 
enable to detect any abnormalities that could suggest QT prolongation. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK profile of ch14.18 has been poorly characterised due to major issues with bioanalytical assays. At 
the moment, the uncertainties regarding the pharmacokinetic parameters because of limitations of the 
bioanalytical assays have been addressed in the SmPC. 
Although the evaluation of the PD response to ch14.18 and IL-2 has been extensively studied, these data 
do not enable to determine the contribution of IL-2 to the response to the anti-GD2 antibody and it is not 
known whether the blood cytolytic activity is similar with or without IL-2. Further data from study 
APN311-202v3 will be provided as a post authorisation measure (see Annex II). 
Due to poor drug tolerance of the new validated HACA assay, the immunogenicity data are not considered 
reliable. The Applicant’s analyses of the impact of HACAS on PD, efficacy and safety can only be 
considered exploratory (See Annex II). 
No firm conclusions on the optimal dose of ch14.18/CHO can be drawn because there was no clear dose 
toxicity response (see Annex II). 
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the issues related to pharmacology: 
• 
• 
The applicant will perform an evaluation of PK/PD and immunogenicity profile based on data 
collected from completed and ongoing trials (APN311-202v1-2-3 and -304) in order to better 
characterise the PK/PD profile and the impact of HACAs on PD, efficacy and safety. 
The applicant will submit the results of study APN311-202v3, in order to evaluate the add-on 
effect of IL-2 in patients with relapsed refractory neuroblastoma. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies and main clinical studies 
Two dose response trials were submitted, but no dose response assessment was actually conducted. In 
both trials, all data relate to a 100 mg/m2 treatment course, administered either as 5 daily infusions of 20 
mg/m2 (APN311-101) or one continuous 10-day infusion at 10 mg/m2/day (APN311-202). The former 
regimen corresponds to the regimen administered in previous German trials (NB90/NB97) using ch14.18

produced in NS0 cell lines (Simon 2005). In the second trial, PK and PD criteria were pre-defined and 
therefore, this regimen was pursued. 
Study APN311-202 
A Phase I/II Dose Schedule Finding Study of ch14.18/CHO Continuous Infusion Combined 
with Subcutaneous Aldesleukin (IL-2) in Patients with Primary Refractory or Relapsed 
Neuroblastoma 
Stage 1: dose schedule finding phase 
Planned daily doses to be investigated in cohorts of 10 patients: 7, 10, or 15 mg/m² with infusion 
durations varying between 10 to 21 days resulting in total doses of 100, 150 or 210 mg/m² 
The dose schedule finding phase was rule-based accounting for both the pain-toxicity profile and 
immunomodulatory (efficacy) capacity. Results on both endpoints were to be evaluated after each cohort 
of 10 patients. On the basis of the results, the next rule-based infusion schedule was assigned for the next 
cohort until one was identified that met all primary endpoint criteria in at least 80% of patients. 
Stage2: confirmatory phase to treat an expansion cohort of 100 patients for five 35-day treatment cycles 
(ongoing)

likely to require, corticosteroid or other immunosuppressive drugs 
Treatments 
- 
Ch14.18/CHO was administered as a 10-day continuous infusion in cycles of 35 to 49 days 
(depending on infusion duration) starting on Day 8 of each cycle, for a total of 5 cycles; however, only the 
first cycle was assessed for the dose schedule finding

Ch14.18/CHO was combined with IL-2 and 13-cis RA (see details of the regimen in the PK 
section). 
Concomitant treatment 
Pain management 
Prior to each cycle of ch14.18/CHO the patient was to be primed with oral gabapentin, which was then 
continued during ch14.18/CHO administration. 
Prior to each infusion of ch14.18/CHO, intravenous morphine was to be given first as a bolus, then as a 
continuous infusion and ideally weaned off over the first 5 days depending on the individual patient pain 
tolerance.

Results 
Patient population 
Forty four (44) patients with relapsed/refractory (R/R) neuroblastoma were enrolled at the cut-off date 
(February 2015). 
Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled from January 2012 in 10 centres in Spain (10), France (9), Italy (9), UK (6), 
Germany (5), Israel (4), and Austria (1).

Table 7: Demographics and disease history 
For a total of 23 patients the overall number of relapses/progressions and the date of the most recent 
relapse/progression was documented. Sixteen out of the 23 patients experienced only 1 
relapse/progression. Most patients (56.5%) experienced relapse/progression of the combined type, i.e. 
not limited to one location. For 38 patients the performance status before study treatment was evaluated. 
The minimum performance score was 80 and the maximum was 100 (mean 98.4 ± 4.4) at baseline. 
Table 8: Relapse/Progression prior to immunotherapy 
First-line treatment consisted of single courses or combinations of the following treatments: surgery, 
radiotherapy, chemotherapy, intensive chemotherapy and maintenance therapy with 13-cis-retinoic acid

(RA). Most frequently patients received rapid COJEC followed by high-dose BuMel (busulfan and 
melphalan) + autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) treatment. About 55% of the patients received 
radiotherapy and 43% received 13-cis-RA maintenance therapy prior to immunotherapy. 
As treatment of R/R disease, 14 patients received another intensive chemotherapy regimen followed by 
ASCT. Nine patients (20.5%) received radiotherapy as local therapy and 8 patients (18 %) underwent 
surgery. About 20% of patients received 13-cis-RA maintenance therapy. 
Although the response to the most recent therapy was not recorded, all patients had to have responded 
adequately to their previous treatment and no patient had signs of progression at study entry. Most 
patients had evidence of disease at baseline before immunotherapy, either detected 
by 123/131iodine-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (mIBG) and/or bone marrow (BM) histology or measured by 
magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and/or computed tomography (CT) (see table below).  
Following CHMP request, the Applicant indicated that five patients could be considered first-line patients.

At the end of treatment (i.e. approximately 6 to 8 months after treatment initiation or earlier in case of 
progressive disease), a response was observed in 14/33 patients (42%) with evidence of disease at 
baseline. Two patients were non evaluable.  
The treatment response was the same in patients with disease evaluable by mIBG/BM only (43%; 9/21) 
and in patients with disease measurable by MRI/CT (42%; 5/12). It was higher in refractory disease 
(48%; 10/21) than in relapsed disease (33%; 4/12). The range for the duration of response was very 
broad (5 weeks to 3 years); the median was about 2.3 years regardless of baseline status and disease 
type. No other factors were investigated.

Treatments 
Ch14.18/CHO was given in combination with fixed doses of s.c. aldesleukin (IL-2) and oral isotretinoin 
(13-cis-RA). Patients initially received i.v. ch14.18/CHO in combination with s.c. IL-2. 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 58/129 
 
 
 
 
 
Aldesleukin (IL-2) 
Subcutaneous IL-2 was usually given at a dose of 6 x 106 IU/m2/day. The majority of patient received it 
in two 5-day blocks (days 1-5 and 8-12). In these patients, IL-2 was given concurrently with 
ch14.18/CHO on days 8-12. Initial patients, however, received IL-2 on days 1-5 only as they started with 
the combination of IL-2 and ch14.18/CHO. Patients ≤ 12 kg were dosed according to body weight: 0.2 x 
106 IU/kg/day. 
ch13.18/CHO 
The dose level of ch14.18/CHO was limited by tolerability although a target daily dose of 10 mg/m2, which 
relates to a total dose of 100 mg/m2/cycle was aimed for. Patients initially received 50 mg/m2 in their first 
treatment cycle in order to assess feasibility and tolerability of the treatment regimen. The majority of 
patients started with s.c. IL-2 in the first week, followed by a combination of ch14.18/CHO and s.c. IL-2 
in the second week. The total duration of a cycle varied between 28 and 35 days. In each cycle treatment 
ended with oral isotretinoin (13-cis-RA) after the completion of the ch14.18/CHO infusion. A total of up to 
6 cycles was given. 
Table 11: Treatment schedules - Study APN311-303 
In order to explore the safety and tolerability of the combination (ch14.18/CHO, IL-2 and 13-cis-RA) the 
first 4 patients were treated according to less intensive treatment schedule 1 in their first treatment cycle. 
As the safety profile of the administered treatment was acceptable all 4 patients continued with higher 
dose of ch14.18/CHO from their 2nd cycle onwards (treatment schedule 2 in the Table 1 above). 
Tolerability and safety of both 4-week treatment schedules were acceptable and therefore the following 
50 patients were treated according to intensified treatment schedule 3. A maximum of 6 cycles was 
allowed. Some patients received reduced doses of IL-2 and/or ch14.18/CHO for safety/tolerability 
reasons. 
13-cis RA 
Patients received isotretinoin (13-cis-RA) at a total daily dose of 160 mg/m²/day administered in two 
equal oral doses twice a day for 14 days after the completion of the ch14.18/CHO infusion. Doses were 
rounded to the nearest 10 mg. The starting day was either day 14 or day 21. Patients ≤12 kg were given 
5.33 mg/kg/day divided into two equal doses given orally twice a day for 14 days. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of study APN311-303 was to evaluate retrospectively the safety and pain-toxicity 
profile of prolonged continuous infusion of ch14.18/CHO in combination with s.c. (IL-2) and oral

13-cis-RA in patients with high risk neuroblastoma treated under a compassionate use programme in one 
single centre in Germany. Secondary objectives included the retrospective evaluation of anti-tumour 
response through clinical assessment (CT/MRI, 123I mIBG, bone marrow examination ) in patients with 
measurable disease, Overall Survival (OS) and Event-Free Survival (EFS), pharmacodynamics and 
pharmacokinetics of ch14.18/CHO. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoints 
Safety and tolerability were evaluated by: 
•  Pain intensity/morphine use 
• 
Incidence, grade and type of adverse events, vital signs and changes in clinical laboratory tests 
Secondary Endpoints 
•  Response rate in patients with measurable/evaluable disease (skeletal lesions, soft tissue lesions, lymph 
nodes and/or primary tumour site, bone marrow) as measured by mIBG, CT/MRI and/or bone marrow 
examination at the end of cycle 3 and at the end of treatment (after 5th or 6th cycle) 
•  Durability of the response 
•  Overall survival (OS) 
•  Event-free survival (EFS), calculated as number of days from starting the compassionate use programme 
treatment until relapse or disease progression observed and detected by any of the 3 methods, CT/MRI, 
mIBG or bone marrow examination 
•  Pharmacodynamic parameters 
•  Correlation between activated NK cells and ch14.18/CHO level with ADCC 
•  Pharmacokinetic parameters 
Response Criteria 
The definition of overall response was based on modified International Neuroblastoma Response Criteria 
(INRC). The response criteria integrated response at all sites, including CT/MRI soft tissue lesions, which 
met RECIST criteria version 1.1, mIBG positive lesions, and bone marrow disease.

Statistical methods 
Descriptive summaries and Kaplan-Meier curves for survival analyses were presented. 
The safety population (SAF) included all patients who were enrolled in this retrospective analysis. 
The full analysis set (FAS, intention-to-treat population, ITT) included all patients who were enrolled, and 
from whom a screening mIBG or CT/MRI was available. 
Two per protocol (PP) populations were defined, PP-RESP for the overall response evaluation and 
PP-SURV for event free and overall survival. 
For the PP-RESP, the following patients were considered: 
• 
• 
with evidence of disease at screening assessment and 
with MRI/CT at baseline and at MID/EOT evaluation or mIBG at baseline and at MID/EOT 
assessment and 
• 
receiving ch14.18/CHO and IL-2. 
For the PP-SURV all patients receiving ch14.18/CHO and IL-2 were considered. 
Efficacy data were analysed overall and separately for patients having received first-line therapy  who had 
evidence or no evidence of disease at baseline, and patients with relapsed or refractory neuroblastoma 
(separately and together).

Results 
Participant flow 
Fifty-four (54) patients were treated in this compassionate use programme. About half of the patients 
(56%) had relapsed neuroblastoma, i.e. the patients had experienced at least one relapse after previous 
neuroblastoma treatment, although they reacted adequately to the most recent treatment prior to 
immunotherapy. Fifteen patients (28%) had a refractory disease status and 9 patients (17%) had only 
received first-line neuroblastoma treatment with either a complete response or with minimal residual 
disease (see table 16). 
Recruitment 
Patients were enrolled and treated between November 2009 and August 2013. 
Conduct of the study 
This was a retrospective data analysis which started after all patients were enrolled and treated.

Table 14: Demographics and disease history by disease type - Study APN311-303 
Six patients (11%) had INSS stage < 4 at diagnosis but suffered from disseminated or combined relapse, 
and therefore, are considered to have similar prognosis as stage 4 patients. Information on MYCN 
amplification status is missing for 12 patients (22%); it was positive in 13 patients (24%). 
For 31 patients (30 with relapsed disease and 1 with refractory disease) the dates of previous 
relapses/progressions were documented. Most of the patients had experienced only 1 
relapse/progression prior to enrolment to immunotherapy. The median time since the first 
relapse/progression to the start of immunotherapy was 12 months, the median time since the most 
recent relapse/progression was 10 months. The average time from the initial diagnosis to the first 
relapse/progression was 708 days (± 311) days, which would suggest a population with a relatively good 
survival prognosis.  
First-line treatment included in most patients intensive combined chemotherapy followed by ASCT: 24 
had BuMel+ASCT and 24 had CEM+ASCT. Salvage therapies of the recurrence included amongst others 
second-line therapy with irinotecan/temozolomide or topotecan/temozolomide, radiotherapy, and 
radionuclide therapy with MIBG.

At the end of treatment (i.e. 5-6 cycles or earlier in case of progressive disease), a response (CR+PR) was 
observed in 12/39 patients (31%) with evidence of disease at baseline while progression occurred in 
17/39 patients (44%). Two patients were not evaluable. The response rate was the same regardless of 
baseline status (MRI/CTI or MIBG/BM) although CR (3 cases) was only reported in patients with 
detectable disease by mIBG and/or BM histology. However, the duration of response (overall: median 313 
days; range 71 – 847) was longer in patients with disease only detectable by MIBG/BM (median of 338 
days; range: 97 - 659) compared to measurable disease with MRI/CT (median of 183 days; range: 71 - 
847) as could be expected. 
In patients with R/R disease, the response rate was only 10/36 (28%). Amongst the 15 patients without 
detectable disease at baseline, one was non-evaluable (no control) and two progressed under treatment.

Ancillary analyses 
Comparison to historical controls 
The overall survival in study APN311-303 was compared with that of historical controls. In a retrospective 
study, Garaventa and colleagues investigated the outcome of neuroblastoma children with relapse or 
progression documented in the Italian Neuroblastoma Registry from 1979 to 2006 (Garaventa et al, 
2009). These patients had received treatment according to the protocols of the Associazione Italiana di 
Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), which included tumour resection, chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy, and myeloablation followed by ASCR, but no immunotherapy. Treatment was thus 
comparable to the treatment used prior to immunotherapy in patients included in study APN311-303. 
Since neuroblastoma treatment regimens had changed over the decades, only data from historic control 
patients with a date of initial diagnosis ≥1999 were included in the historic control group. 
To further ensure comparability of data, historic control analyses were restricted to patients with relapsed 
neuroblastoma, patients who were ≥1 year of age at initial diagnosis/relapse and who presented with 
INSS stage 4 at initial diagnosis or nonlocal type of first relapse. The cut-off date for these patients 
follow-up was 22 July 2014.

Since the historic control patients had not been treated with ch14.18/CHO, an auxiliary starting point had 
to be defined; this was equal to the date of first relapse plus the median time between first 
relapse/progression and start of antibody therapy for the APN311-303 patients (~ 1 year). 
The historical cohort included fewer females and more patients with stage 4 disease and MYCN 
amplification (i.e. less favourable prognosis) than the immunotherapy cohort but the time between 
diagnosis and first relapse was comparable. 
Table 18: Patient characteristics - APN311-303 vs. historical controls 
The difference in OS between the two cohorts was highly significant (p = 0.0009) in favour of 
APN311-303. When adding prognostic factors for OS (ie, age at diagnosis, gender, MYCN amplification, 
and INSS stage) in a Cox model, the difference in OS time was still statistically significant (p = 0.002).

Study APN311-302 (HR-NBL-1/SIOPEN) 
Safety and efficacy of ch14.18/CHO from data collected in the high risk neuroblastoma 
(HRNBL1) study 1.5 of SIOP-Europe (SIOPEN) 
Methods 
This data set came from a multinational, open-label, randomised, controlled Phase III trial in high-risk 
neuroblastoma patients conducted by SIOPEN to control minimal residual disease after intensive 
combination chemotherapy, myeloablative therapy (MAT) with stem-cell rescue, and radiation therapy. 
Study APN311-302 evaluated the add-on effect of IL-2 to the ch14.18/CHO + 13-cis RA regimen. Patients 
were randomised to ch14.18/CHO (100 mg/m2 per cycle in 5 daily 8-hour infusions) with or without IL-2 
(60 x 106 IU by cycle) and all received 13-cis RA. 
The study included three main study phases: an induction phase, a consolidation (MAT) phase, and 
a maintenance phase. During the latter patients receive immunotherapy. 
The study protocol was recently amended and is now recruiting additional patients treated with 
continuous infusions instead of short infusions of ch14.18/CHO. A total of 406 patients were enrolled in 
study APN311-302 by August 2013 in 10 European countries, Australia and Israel. The Applicant has 
provided a CSR of the maintenance phase on 385 randomised patients, for whom Case Report Forms have 
become available so far (last cut-off date 05 September 2016). 
Study Participants 
Main inclusion criteria 
• 
Established diagnosis of neuroblastoma according to the International Neuroblastoma Staging 
System (INSS). 
•  Age below 21 years. 
•  High risk neuroblastoma, defined as either: 
o 
o 
INSS stages 2, 3, 4 or 4s with MYCN amplification of any age below 21 years 
INSS stage 4 without MYCN amplification aged ≥12 months at diagnosis and in patients 
aged 12-18 months only in the presence of segmental chromosomal alterations (SCA) 
•  No previous chemotherapy except for 1 cycle of etoposide and carboplatin (VP/Carbo). 
• 
Tumour cell material available for determination of biological prognostic factors. 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 67/129 
 
 
 
 
 
Main exclusion criteria 
Patients aged 12-18 months at diagnosis with stage 4 neuroblastoma, no MYCN amplification, and 
without SCA were not eligible for R2. These patients stopped treatment after induction therapy and 
surgery to the primary tumour because these patients present a special disease entity considered 
intermediate risk only. 
Treatments 
13-cis-RA was administered orally, at a dose of 160 mg/m²/day over 14 days, every 4 weeks over 6 
courses, and was started after completion of local irradiation, no later than Day 120 post PBSCR. 
13-cis-RA was provided in 5 mg and 20 mg capsules depending on the total daily dose required. 
Ch14.18/CHO was administered as an 8-hour i.v. infusion, at a dose of 20 mg/m²/day over 5 days, every 
4 weeks over 5 courses. The first course started 3 weeks after the initiation of 13-cis-RA. 
Patients randomized to receive ch14.18/CHO and subcutaneous IL-2 started their immunotherapy with 
IL-2 at Week 3. IL-2 was given according to the following administration schedule: 
•  During Weeks 3, 7, 11, 15 and 19 IL-2 was given at a dose of 6 MIU/m2/day over 5 days 
subcutaneously (Monday-Friday). 
•  During Weeks 4, 8, 12, 16 and 20 IL-2 was given 2 hours after the stop of the anti-body infusion at 
a dose of 6 MIU/m2/day over 5 days subcutaneously. 
Objectives 
Primary objective:  
To test the hypothesis that the addition of subcutaneous aldesleukin (IL-2) to immunotherapy with 
ch14.18/CHO in addition to differentiation therapy with isotretinoin (13-cis-RA) following myeloablative 
therapy (MAT) and autologous stem cell rescue (ASCR), will improve 3-year event-free survival (EFS) in 
patients with high risk neuroblastoma. 
Secondary objectives: 
•  To determine the tolerance of immunotherapy with ch14.18/CHO with or without subcutaneous (s.c.) 
IL-2 in addition to 13-cis-RA following MAT. 
•  To collect data on selected, validated biological features, and to determine the effect of these on EFS 
and overall survival (OS). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: 
3-year EFS, calculated from the date of randomisation. Disease progression or relapse, death from any 
cause and second neoplasm were considered as events. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
•  overall survival, calculated from date of randomisation to death from any cause 
• 
• 
cumulative incidence of relapse/progression 
cumulative incidence of death by disease progression, infection and other reason 
•  overall response based on the investigator’s assessment

• 
relationship of response rates, survival, EFS, and the cumulative incidence of relapse or progressions 
with disease status before immunotherapy. 
Sample size 
The 3-year EFS in the group without IL-2, i.e. 13-cis-RA and ch14.18/CHO) was anticipated to be 55%. 
This trial aimed to demonstrate an improvement of 12.5% by the addition of aldesleukin (IL-2). With a 
sample size of 400 patients, a recruitment period of 4 years, a minimum follow up of 2 years, and 
two-sided α = 5%, the study had a power of 80%. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized to 13-cis-RA and ch14.18/CHO, with or without IL-2. 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was open label. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy was analysed based on the full analysis set (FAS) and the per-protocol set (PPS). The primary 
endpoint, the 3-year EFS, was analysed using Kaplan-Meier methods.  
Overall survival was calculated as the number of days until death from any cause using Kaplan-Meier 
methods. Patients lost to follow-up without event were censored at the date of their last follow-up 
evaluation. 
For the analysis of EFS and OS, treatment groups were compared using the log-rank test adjusted by 
previous treatment group (BuMel or CEM). 
Response evaluations were summarized descriptively at baseline, after the immunotherapy phase and at 
the 1-year follow-up. Additionally, a cross-tabulation of the response evaluations at baseline vs after the 
immunotherapy phase was prepared. The number of patients with relapses and/or progression after 
immunotherapy phase was summarized with frequency tables. 
A sub-group analysis was performed for EFS and OS (FAS and PPS). 
The sub-groups consisted of: 
•  patients without evidence of disease at baseline (CR) and 
•  patients with evidence of disease at baseline (VGPR, PR, MR, NR, PD).

Treatment compliance (Safety set) 
In the IL-2 arm, a proportion of patients not only did not receive the full IL-2 treatment but had also lower 
exposure to ch14.18/CHO than patients in the ch14.18/CHO alone arm 39% (with IL-2) vs 78% (without 
IL-2) of patients received at least 50% of the planned doses of ch14.18/CHO or IL-2. Of the 183 patients 
receiving IL-2, 70 had an IL-2 dose reduction and 29 patients discontinued IL-2 treatment. Moreover in 
the IL-2 arm, there were 64 dose reductions and 34 discontinuations of ch14.18/CHO compared to 29 
dose reductions and 25 discontinuations in the 183 patients of the ch14.18 alone arm. The mean 
cumulative ch14.18 dose was 289 mg (ch14.18 alone) vs 234 mg (with IL-2). 
Comparison to historical controls 
As requested by the CHMP, the Applicant has provided an appropriate historical comparison for the use of 
Dinutuximab beta Apeiron in the first line treatment of high risk neuroblastoma by identifying patients 
enrolled in the same SIOPEN protocol but in an earlier phase (R1; 2002-2010); these patients did not 
receive immunotherapy but only 13-cis retinoic acid (RA).

Comparison to historical controls 
The overall survival of the pooled relapsed patients from studies APN311-303 and -202 was compared 
with that of two cohorts of historical controls. 
In a retrospective study, Garaventa and colleagues investigated the outcome of neuroblastoma children 
with relapse or progression documented in the Italian Neuroblastoma Registry from 1979 to 2006 
(Garaventa et al, 2009). These patients had received treatment according to the protocols of the 
Associazione Italiana di Ematologia e Oncologia Pediatrica (AIEOP), which included tumour resection, 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy, and myeloablation followed by ASCR, but no immunotherapy. Treatment 
was thus comparable to the treatment used prior to immunotherapy in patients included in APN311 
studies. Since neuroblastoma treatment regimens had changed over the decades, only data from historic 
control patients with a date of initial diagnosis ≥1999 were included in the historic control group. 
Another historical cohort was extracted from patients enrolled in the SIOPEN high risk neuroblastoma 
study (HRNBL1) in an earlier phase (R1; 2002-2010) than study APN311-302 (R2; 2009-2013); these 
patients did not receive immunotherapy but only 13-cis retinoic acid (RA), and had experienced a relapse 
during their follow-up. 
To further ensure comparability of data, historic control analyses were restricted to patients with relapsed 
neuroblastoma, patients who were ≥1 year of age at initial diagnosis/relapse and who presented with 
INSS stage 4 at initial diagnosis or nonlocal type of first relapse.

Since the historic control patients had not been treated with ch14.18/CHO, an auxiliary starting point had 
to be defined; this was equal to the date of first relapse plus the median time between first 
relapse/progression and start of antibody therapy for the APN311 patients. 
The description of the patient and relapse characteristics for the pooled APN311 population and historical 
controls is shown below.

The survival results are shown hereafter. 
Sensitivity analyses were conducted excluding historic control patients who died within the first two 
months (60 days) after the auxiliary starting point, i.e. patients who might not have been fit enough to 
receive immunotherapy at the auxiliary starting point. The results showed the same trend but they did not 
all reach statistical significance. In addition, given the imbalance in MYCN status and its prognostic value, 
adjusted analyses on this factor were requested and also supported a positive effect of immunotherapy on 
survival (HRs = 0.52 and 0.60).

Study APN311-201 
This is an ongoing feasibility study using of ch14.18/CHO and IL-2 after haploidentical stem cell 
transplantation. In this setting, anti-tumour activity is exerted by the donor-derived NK cells and IL-2 is 
used at a low dose from Cycle 4 to prevent graft vs. host disease. The short-infusion regimen was 
administered up to 9 cycles in this trial. 
Overall, 35 patients with histologically confirmed neuroblastoma had experienced at least one relapse 
between the time of their initial diagnosis and the allogeneic haploidentical stem cell transplantation 
(ASCT), when they were enrolled into this study. 
Their age ranged from 3 to 20 years (median = 6 years) and included more females than males (69% vs. 
31%). Most patients (94%) had evidence of distant relapse, particularly metastases to the skeleton and 
bone marrow. Most tumours (71%) were MYCN non-amplified. Nearly all patients (97%) had received 
chemotherapy, approximately half of the patients (43%) had undergone surgery, half of the patients 
(46%) radiation therapy and approximately three-quarters of the patients (77%) had 131I-radiolabelled 
mIBG therapy for treatment of recurrent neuroblastoma. 
After haplo-HSCT, the patient status was the following: 11 patients had CR, 2 had VGPR, 17 had PR, 1 had 
MR (mixed response), 3 had NR (no response) and 1 had PD. 
In 22 evaluable patients with evidence of disease prior to immunotherapy, 11 (50%) had a complete 
response at the end of treatment. However, the results of patients initially negative should also be taken 
into account in the analysis. Out of 28 evaluable patients, 12/28 (43%) showed an improvement, 8/28 
(29%) worsened and 8/28 (29%) had no change. A more conservative estimate of the proportion of 
patients improved would be based on the whole patient population, i.e. 12/35 (34%).

Data from 20 historic control patients were selected from the CD3/CD19 depleted Haplotransplantation 
Study, which was performed at the University Hospital Tübingen. Patients were selected if they had 
relapsed neuroblastoma and had undergone Haplo-SCT from 2004. 
The patients in the historic control group were diagnosed with neuroblastoma between 1999 and 2009. 
Patients in study APN311-201 were initially diagnosed with histologically confirmed neuroblastoma 
between 2005 and 2011 as reported by Tübingen.  
The starting point of the analysis for the historic control patients was equal to the date of Haplo-SCT plus 
the median time between Haplo-SCT and start of antibody therapy for the APN311-201 patients (83 
days). 
Patients with relapse/progression or who died between haplo-SCT and the auxiliary starting point (i.e., 
date of haplo-SCT plus the median time between transplantation and start of antibody therapy for the 
APN311-201 patients) were excluded from the historical control group. 
The immunotherapy cohort was slightly older with more females but importantly with more MYCN 
amplified tumours (29% vs 12%) than the controls, i.e. with less favourable prognosis.

 Table 35: APN311-201 vs. historical controls: Event-free survival 
Increased survival (EFS and OS) was shown in the immunotherapy cohort, which was statistically 
significant for OS (p = 0.026). As some patients had already received ch14.18 before haplo-SCT (7 in the 
APN311-201 trial and 5 in the historical cohort, respectively), a sub-group analysis was also conducted 
excluding these patients and showed similar results.

Study APN311-301 
This was the first phase of the SIOPEN study which compared ch14.18/CHO+13-cis RA with 13-cis RA 
alone. The number of patients enrolled was very small: 34 patients in the ITT set (16 patients in the 13-cis 
RA arm and 18 patients in the 13-cis-RA+ch14.18/CHO arm) and 25 patients in the FAS (full analysis set), 
which only included patients having received treatment; 11 patients in the 13-cis-RA arm and 14 patients 
in the 13-cis-RA+cis14.18/CHO arm. 
At 2-year, overall survival was higher in the 13-cis RA alone arm (82% vs 71%) whereas afterwards, the 
opposite trend was reported; at 3- and 4-year, OS appeared higher in the ch14.18/CHO + 13-cis RA arm: 
71% vs 64% and 48% vs 35%, respectively. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical development of ch14.18/CHO has been conducted by the International Society of Paediatric 
Oncology Europe Neuroblastoma (SIOPEN). The clinical dossier consists of six studies of which five 
(APN311-101, APN311-201, APN311-202, APN311-301, APN311-303) were small (54 or less patients 
treated); one was actually a retrospective data collection of a compassionate use programme. It is 
noteworthy that none of the three single-arm investigator-sponsored trials had efficacy as a primary 
endpoint since these were Phase I/II trials to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics, 
pharmacodynamics, and anti-tumour response. Their objectives were first to bridge to previous ch14.18 
produced in other cell lines and subsequently to evaluate a new way of delivering the cycle dose, as a 
continuous infusion rather than daily 8-hour infusions, in an attempt to reduce the well-known pain 
toxicity of anti-GD2 mAbs. The last trial is a feasibility trial investigating a new experimental approach 
including haploidentical SCT followed by ch14.18/CHO monotherapy, with a low dose IL-2 regimen 
subsequently added to prevent GvHD. 
The sixth study (APN311-302) enrolled in total 406 patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who were 
randomised to study the effect of IL-2 added to the combination of ch14.18 and 13-cis RA after first-line 
therapy. The first part of this study (APN311-301) enrolled 34 patients who were randomised to receive 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 85/129 
 
 
 
 
 
ch14.18/CHO and RA or RA monotherapy. This trial was stopped and the data have been submitted 
following CHMP request; however, these are too limited to enable any conclusion. 
Historical comparisons 
Overall, none of the submitted studies included a comparative arm with patients who did not receive 
ch14.18/CHO except for the very small APN311-301 trial (25 evaluable patients). In the absence of 
internal controls, the assessment of the efficacy of immunotherapy was performed by comparison to 
historical control data. 
Following CHMP request, the two studies in the relapsed setting were compared to historical controls; 
additional data on the relapses were collected to strengthen the evidence that these are reasonably 
matched with the patients treated in the APN311 studies for the most relevant baseline characteristics 
that are known from the literature. Two historical cohorts were identified: one from the Italian 
Neuroblastoma Registry (Garaventa et al, 2009) with enrolment between 1999 and 2004, the other 
included relapsed patients extracted from the SIOPEN high risk neuroblastoma study (HRNBL1) in an 
early phase (R1; 2002-2010) before immunotherapy was introduced. This whole second cohort was also 
used for the historical comparison in the first-line setting. 
Comparative analyses were conducted between controls and individual APN311 studies as well as pooled 
studies for the relapsed setting. A sensitivity analysis was conducted for all these comparisons excluding 
from the control arm those patients who died (and progressed for the first-line setting) within 60 days of 
the follow-up starting point; this criterion is used as a surrogate of the performance status/clinical 
condition of the controls as patients eligible to receive Dinutuximab beta Apeiron/IL-2 are anticipated to 
be in good condition to be able to tolerate it. 
Based on the literature, there are four key individual prognostic factors of survival in the relapsing 
patients: age at diagnosis, INSS stage of the tumour, time to first relapse and MYCN amplification status. 
When pooled together, the relapsed patients in the APN311 studies appear reasonably well matched to 
both cohorts (Italian Registry and HRNBL1-R1) except for the MYCN amplification status (fewer amplified 
in the APN311 studies, which would favour them against the controls). Therefore, a sensitivity analysis 
adjusting for this factor was requested by the CHMP. 
Quality of the data and analyses 
As expected for compassionate use (study APN311-303), the patient population is extremely 
heterogeneous, including both first-line and refractory/relapsed patients. Furthermore, due to the 
retrospective nature of the data collection, there was a substantial amount of missing data, especially for 
prognostic factors; these data could not be retrieved in spite of the Applicant’s review of the data. As a 
consequence of this design, population (selection bias), application of treatment (no prospective 
treatment protocol), data recording (possible lack of standardization) and measurement of outcomes 
could potentially be affected. 
Furthermore, a GCP inspection was carried out, which identified critical and major findings. In particular, 
the retrospective informed consent procedure was not appropriate. The Applicant had to conduct a 
re-consent procedure and to present its outcomes to the Ethics Committee, which finally agreed that all 
data from the compassionate use programme could be used if anonymised. Regarding the accuracy of the 
data, the inspectors concluded that the data could be considered reliable, which was endorsed by the 
CHMP. 
Efficacy endpoints 
In study APN311-202, the primary endpoint was the number of CD16/CD56 positive activated NK cells 
but this endpoint is not acceptable as efficacy endpoint because the correlation of this PD parameter with 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 86/129 
 
 
 
 
clinical outcomes is unclear. In fact, no correlation with tumour response could be found by the Applicant, 
rather a trend towards longer OS in patients with high expression of CD16/CD56+ activated NK cells. 
Tumour response, especially the occurrence of complete response (CR) may indicate anti-tumour activity 
of the treatment regimen but does not always relate to clinical benefit e.g. prolonged survival. Moreover, 
ch14.18/CHO was combined with 13-cis-RA and IL-2 in most studies. Thus, it is not clear whether the 
reported responses are exclusively the result of ch14.18/CHO treatment or of the other components of 
the applied regimen. Responses, including complete response, have also been reported for 13-cis-RA 
therapy. Given the fixed number of treatment cycles 5 (or 6), which was applied to the vast majority of 
patients except in case of early disease progression, the best response is not necessarily the most 
clinically relevant outcome as it takes into account responses of very short duration. Evaluation at the end 
of treatment, which was usually performed 6-8 months after treatment initiation (except in case of early 
disease progression), provides a valuable indication of the disease outcome after such a period of time. 
Event free survival is generally considered as an important efficacy endpoint, and this might even be used 
as primary endpoint when there is a good correlation between EFS and OS and a long median OS is 
anticipated. However, this endpoint is complicated by several methodological issues, including the exact 
definition of events and methods of disease status determination. The time points at which disease status 
was assessed during treatment and follow-up were not strictly pre-specified; consequently, it is not clear 
whether the exact time of disease progression was determined. 
As efficacy data in terms of EFS and OS were not planned in the protocols, these have been collected 
retrospectively and presented by the Applicant. The value of EFS results is considered limited due to the 
methodological issues previously mentioned and OS is considered the most important efficacy endpoint. 
As the proportion of censored subjects is high after 2 years, only outcomes during the first 2 years after 
treatment are currently considered reliable in the R/R setting. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
No proper dose finding trial was conducted. The first trial investigated only three treatment cycles in a 
very small number of heterogeneous patients and without defined timing of efficacy assessments. The 
second trial tested only one dose. 
Refractory/Relapsed setting 
For the total of both studies APN311-303 and 202, the overall response (CR+PR) at the end of treatment 
was 26/72 (36%; 95%CI [25%, 48%]) in patients with detectable disease, out of whom 9 (13%) had a 
CR, while disease had progressed in 29/72 patients (40%; 95%CI [19%, 52%]).  
Survival data (EFS/OS) showed comparable results in both studies at one year. At 2-year, inconsistent 
results were observed across the studies: EFS was lower but OS was higher in study APN311-303 
compared with the outcomes in study APN311-202; the 2-year OS rate was 75% in study -303 and 63% 
in study -202 (for the total population). Three-year results are not reliable due to high level of censoring. 
EFS/OS rates tended to be higher in refractory disease compared to relapses. This finding is in line with 
a retrospective study in patients treated with 131I-MIBG but in contrast with older data from the Italian 
registry. 
EFS/OS rates were higher in patients with no evidence of disease compared to those with evidence of 
disease, as would be expected, in one of the studies (APN311-303), while no difference was observed in 
the other study (APN311-202). There is no explanation for the latter finding although the sample size is 
small. 
Historical control comparisons were conducted for relapsed patients. 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 87/129 
 
 
 
 
A sensitivity analysis adjusting for MYCN amplification status supported a favourable effect of 
ch14.18/CHO on survival. Another sensitivity analysis was conducted excluding from the control cohorts, 
the patients who died within 60 days of the follow-up starting point; this criterion is used as a surrogate 
of the performance status/clinical condition of the controls as patients eligible to receive Dinutuximab 
beta Apeiron/IL-2 are anticipated to be in good condition to be able to tolerate it. 
Due to the small samples of treated patients and controls, these historical comparisons lack power but the 
point estimate and confidence interval do indicate survival benefit. In conclusion, the magnitude of the 
effect may differ but the trends are consistent and the replication of the results provides reassurance 
about the benefit even if its extent cannot be accurately quantified. 
The results of the feasibility study on haploidentical SCT followed by ch14.18/CHO monotherapy (and IL-2 
to prevent GvHD) are promising. In this study, the 1-year rates were higher for EFS (62%) but lower for 
OS (80%) compared to the two other trials, which is likely due to the different population and 
complications of the treatment modalities. 
The additive effect of IL-2 is not known for patients with relapsed/refractory disease as the effect of 
omitting IL-2 in the treatment has not been studied in this population. This will be addressed in the 
context of a specific obligation (see Annex II). 
First-line setting 
Study APN311-302 compared ch14.18/CHO with or without IL-2 in the first-line setting (patients with 
high-risk neuroblastoma having previously received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a 
partial response, followed by myeloablative therapy and stem cell transplantation. It was used to justify 
ch14.18/CHO monotherapy as the survival results suggest limited added value of IL-2.  
However in this study, treatment compliance to IL-2 was poor; moreover, compliance with ch14.18/CHO 
was worse in the combination arm (ch14.18/CHO + IL-2) than in the ch14.18/CHO monotherapy arm. It 
is noteworthy that compliance in study APN311-302 is relativity poor when compared to compliance in the 
R/R setting, which makes the interpretation of these results and their extrapolation to other treatment 
settings difficult. 
The 3-year EFS (primary endpoint) showed rates of 55% without IL-2 and 61% with IL-2 while the 3-year 
OS rates were 64% and 69%, respectively. It is agreed that the differences in EFS and OS were small 
between the treatment arms although the rates in the +IL-2 arm tended to be (numerically) higher than 
the rates in the –IL-2 arm, in particular at the later time points. Nevertheless, it is agreed that the data 
indicate that there is no or only limited added benefit of the addition of IL-2 to the treatment with 
ch14.18/CHO in the first-line setting without residual disease (at 3 years, EFS: 62% vs 66% and OS: 71% 
vs 72%, respectively). Whether this is also true for patients with residual disease is doubtful based on the 
APN311-302 study results. In a post-hoc analysis, a numerical difference (8-9%) in 3-year survival rates 
was reported for patients with evidence of disease before immunotherapy (EFS: 46% vs 54% and OS: 
54% vs 63%, respectively) in contrast to those without evidence of disease, i.e. with complete response 
to previous therapies). These outcomes were in line with other data: a higher relapse rate in the arm 
receiving only ch14.18: 41% (74/180) vs 35% (67/190), with more relapses in multiple sites: 35% 
(38/109) vs 25% (26/104); in patients with disease before immunotherapy, a lower tumour response 
rate in the arm receiving only ch14.18: 33% (22/66) vs 46% (32/70) (missing data excluded). 
A comparison to an historical control group obtained from study HRNBL1-R1 was performed using 450 
patients diagnosed with neuroblastoma between 2002 and 2010. Given the relatively high number of 
patients it is expected that these patients are representative for the patients with high risk neuroblastoma 
seen in clinical practice during this period. Furthermore, control and study groups seemed to be 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 88/129 
 
 
 
 
reasonably balanced for the main prognostic factors like MYCN status, INSS stage at initial diagnosis and 
age of diagnosis. 
This comparison showed that the percentage of patients that were still alive after 3 year of follow up was 
12 % (59% vs 71%, for MAT and MAT+ immunotherapy respectively) higher after APN311 treatment 
than for patients who did not receive immunotherapy. Such difference is considered clinically relevant. 
With the sensitivity analysis excluding patients who had relapse/progression or death within the first two 
months (60 days) after the auxiliary starting point, still 9% more patients treated with immunotherapy 
than with 13-cis-RA alone, were alive after 3 years of follow up and after 5 years of follow-up the survival 
rate was 12% higher for the immunotherapy group.  
IL-2 combination 
Overall, the data indicated that the added value of IL-2 to the treatment effect of ch14.18/CHO is doubtful 
in the overall population of study APN311-302, while a significant contribution to the safety profile of 
treatment is noted. Thus, omitting IL-2 from the treatment schedule for some of these patients could be 
considered.  
Whether this is also true for relapsed/refractory patients is uncertain as the effect of omitting IL-2 in the 
treatment has not been studied in this population. One should be extremely cautious with extrapolation of 
the findings of the APN311-302 study to the relapsed/refractory setting, i.e. a patient population with 
higher risk, especially given the results observed in patients with residual disease. 
Based on these data, it can be accepted that in the first-line setting and if there is no residual disease, IL-2 
has no benefit. In all other circumstances, first-line with residual disease (PR) and R/R setting, it is not 
currently possible to dismiss an add-on benefit of IL-2, and therefore, the combination of Dinutuximab 
beta Apeiron to IL-2 is recommended until new data become available. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that the data set on the 
clinical efficacy of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron under normal conditions of use could not be considered 
comprehensive due to the absence of any randomised head-to-head comparison with a placebo or active 
comparator in any clinical setting. The use of historical controls has major weaknesses especially in this 
case given the scarcity of the information available to support that patients treated with Dinutuximab beta 
Apeiron and controls were matched. 
However, it is not considered feasible to generate a comprehensive data set due to ethical considerations 
preventing the conduct of a randomised placebo-controlled trial. At the time of this report, dinutuximab 
is standard of care in the treatment of high risk neuroblastoma, whereby neither physicians nor patients 
would be prepared to participate in a placebo-controlled trial. 
In addition, a comparative trial against the previously authorised dinutuximab product Unituxin (the only 
one potential active comparator) is not expected to be feasible given the withdrawal of the marketing 
authorisation of Unituxin. 
Therefore, the current situation prevents the generation of new controlled data to confirm the outcomes 
of studies APN311-202, -303, and -302. 
The CHMP was therefore of the view that a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
should be granted subject to a number of obligations in line with a programme of ongoing studies and 
analyses to be further proposed by the Applicant. Within this programme, additional PK/PD and 
immunogenicity data should be generated, especially about the impact of HACAs on efficacy, since the 
product being highly toxic, the benefit of completing all treatment cycles after developing HACAs should

EMA/263814/2017 
Page 89/129 
 
 
 
 
be evaluated. Furthermore, updated survival data should be generated as they are currently immature. 
Finally, one Phase II study is further investigating whether the addition of IL-2 to Dinutuximab beta 
Apeiron improves anti-tumour response and survival in the R/R setting. 
In addition, a drug exposure registry should be implemented. While this study is mainly intended for the 
generation of further safety data, data on short-term anti-tumour response and long-term survival should 
also be generated. These specific obligations will be reviewed annually and continuation of the 
authorisation shall be linked to these annual re-assessments. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
R/R setting 
In a pooled analysis of the two APN311 studies, a response rate of 36% was achieved at the end of 
treatment, with 13% of complete response. This result looks promising and strongly suggests 
anti-tumour activity, although a sustained effect of previous therapies of the relapse cannot be 
completely ruled out. 
All historical control comparisons showed that immunotherapy improves survival in relapsed disease. The 
magnitude of the effect may differ but the trends are consistent and the replication of the results provides 
reassurance about the benefit even if its extent cannot be accurately quantified. 
While none of these outcomes on its own would be sufficient to establish efficacy, it is considered that, by 
the combination of the provided evidence (early tumour response to treatment and long-term survival 
data), the efficacy of ch14.18/CHO is demonstrated, even though the exact effect size is not fully known.  
First-line setting 
The use of ch14.18/CHO in patients with high-risk neuroblastoma who have previously received induction 
chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, followed by myeloblative therapy and stem cell 
transplantation, is supported by the results of study APN311-302. A comparison with a historical control 
group showed that the percentage of patients that were still alive after 3 years of follow-up was 12% 
higher after ch14.18/CHO treatment (with or without IL-2) than for patients who did not receive 
immunotherapy, a difference that is considered clinically relevant. 
Therefore, it is considered that in this population also, immunotherapy increases long term survival. 
However, the CHMP considered that the available data set on the clinical efficacy was not comprehensive 
and that the following measures are necessary to generate additional efficacy data in the context of a 
marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances: 
•  The MAH should provide PK/PD and immunogenicity data, including the effect of HACAs on 
efficacy, using data collected from several ongoing trials (e.g. APN311-202v1-2 and -304) 
•  The MAH should provide survival update from studies APN311 -202 and -302. 
•  The MAH should provide the results of the Phase II study comparing Dinutuximab beta Apeiron 
monotherapy vs combination with IL-2 in the R/R setting. 
•  The MAH should follow up patients in the SAFARY drug registry and provide annual results.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The overall safety database currently includes 514 patients that received ch14.18/CHO: 98 patients as 
a continuous infusion over 10 days and 416 patients as short 8h-infusions. Overall, 281 patients received 
it in combination with IL-2 and 207 patients received antibody treatment without IL-2; 26 patients 
received both single-agent and combination cycles, but with a low IL-2 dose. In addition, 13-cis retinoic 
was also administered to patients in studies APN311-202, -302 and -303. 
The dosing regimens of the three products are shown in the next table. 
It should be emphasized that the method of AE collection varied across studies. In particular, in the 
largest study (APN311-302) only SAEs were fully reported while for other AEs, a pre-defined list of 31 
specific toxicities was used. A similar system was used in study APN311-201 where safety was recorded 
by toxicity forms and AEs that were not already included in the form were to be reported as TEAEs. All 
adverse events that were listed as toxicity were classified as at least possibly related to treatment. As the 
main study is a retrospective analysis of patients enrolled into the compassionate use programme, safety 
was also retrospectively assessed from adverse events recorded from time of enrolment until 30 days 
after last study treatment. 
Therefore, except for SAEs and some ADRs of specific interest, the evaluation will mainly focus on the 98 
patients of the continuous infusion studies due to the specific toxicities of the transplantation setting, the 
restricted number of cycles administered in the PK bridging study.

In the main (continuous infusion) studies 68/98 (69%) patients completed the planned 5-6 cycles. The 
main reason for treatment discontinuation was progressive disease and the number of patients having 
stopped treatment due to an ADR, as only reason or associated with PD, was 6 (6%).

While the number of TEAEs decreased significantly over treatment cycles, the proportion of patients with 
any TEAE remained high throughout the study (data not shown). 
The most frequent TEAEs are presented for cycle 1 in studies APN311-202 and -303 below. General 
disorders, namely pyrexia, were the most frequently documented TEAEs, followed by 
investigation-related TEAEs in study APN311-202 and by gastrointestinal disorders in study APN311-303.  
In study APN311-202, the most frequent PTs were pyrexia, pain, vomiting, cough, increased weight, and 
laboratory abnormalities (increased alanine aminotransferase and gammaglutamyltransferase, anaemia, 
leukopenia, thrombopenia).

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Seven patients died for a reason other than disease progression. 
For three patients, death occurred several months after the end of treatment: one as a result of an 
accident and two as the result of an infection. 
Four deaths could be considered as possibly treatment-related as they occurred as a result of an AE that 
started under therapy. 
• 
Two deaths occurred in study APN311-302 due to capillary leak syndrome and acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, which may have been the result of an anaphylactic reaction. 
•  One death in study APN311-201 is more likely related to the previous allogeneic stem cell transplantation 
(herpes encephalitis); the patient developed pneumonia leading to pulmonary failure with fatal outcome 
about 2 months later. 
•  One death in study APN311-202 was due to septic shock and was attributed to delayed antibiotic 
treatment in an outpatient who presented with repeated fever episodes and was subsequently 
hospitalised. It does not seem that, in this case, home treatment could be directly incriminated in the 
delayed antibiotic therapy, but according to the Applicant, rather the fact that the patient was not 
followed in a specialised environment. 
SAEs 
The SAE profile was broadly similar in studies APN311-201 and 202; the most frequent SAEs were 
infections, pyrexia, hypotension, thrombocytopaenia. However, a high occurrence of serious 
hypoxia/respiratory distress was reported specifically in study APN311-202. 
The patient incidence of SAEs decreased significantly over the treatment cycles: from 39% (cycle 1) to 
7% (cycle 5) in study APN311-202 and from 15% (cycle 1) to 0% (cycle 5) in study APN311-303. 
Study APN311-302 allowed to compare the safety profile of ch14.18/CHO (+13-cis RA) alone and 
combined with IL-2. SAEs were reported more frequently in patients receiving IL-2 compared to patients 
not receiving IL-2: 46% vs 27%. More patients who received IL-2 experienced at least 1 SAE leading to 
the discontinuation of ch14.18/CHO, 13-cis-RA, and/or IL-2, if applicable: 17% vs 6% of patients (47 vs 
16 SAEs).

Treatment-related events 
Since most TEAEs documented during the studies were judged to have at least a possible relationship to 
the study treatment (any of ch14.18/CHO, IL-2, 13-cis-RA), treatment-related TEAEs were generally 
comparable to overall TEAE incidences. 
Study APN311-302 allowed to compare the safety profile of ch14.18/CHO (+13-cis RA) alone and 
combined with IL-2. Toxicities were generally more frequent in patients who received IL-2 compared to 
patients who did not receive IL-2 in particular capillary leak syndrome, platelet abnormalities, 
hypotension, infections, nausea or vomiting, fever, and pain related to ch14.18/CHO. Constipation 
however was observed less frequently with concomitant IL-2 treatment than without IL-2 treatment.

Adverse drug reactions 
The list of ADRs has been established by the applicant and reviewed by the CHMP. Due to different 
methods of AE collection across studies, ADR frequencies were calculated either on the totality of the 
safety database (N=514) when possible/relevant or on the subpopulation of studies APN311-101, -201, 
-202, -303 (N=148).

Adverse events of interest 
Pain-related AEs and intravenous morphine use 
The main expected toxicity of ch14.18 antibody treatment is related to neuropathic pain symptoms. In 
studies APN311-303 and -202, pain self-assessment was performed using specific paediatric scales (e.g., 
Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale or Faces Pain Scale – Revised). The investigator documented the 
occurrence of pain on a daily basis in study APN311-101 and in study APN311-201 the incidence of pain 
was documented per treatment cycle only.

Pain assessment 
The total number of patients with at least one documentation of pain in each treatment cycle is provided 
for the continuous infusion studies APN311-303 and -202, using a dosage of 10 mg/m2/day, and for the 
short infusion study APN311-101, using a dosage 10 to 30 mg/m2/day. 
In the continuous infusion studies, around 90% of the patients experienced pain in cycle 1. The 
percentage of patients with pain decreased in subsequent treatment cycles, to about 60% in cycle 5. In 
study APN311-101, 67% of the patients experienced pain in cycle 1 and 22% in cycle 3.

In study APN311-201 (short infusions), there was a clear decrease in the incidence of pain from Cycle 1 
(100%) to Cycle 6 (65%); as there was a drop in the number of patients after Cycle 6, the apparent 
increase in pain incidence during the last cycles should be interpreted with caution.

Intravenous morphine use 
Intravenous morphine is generally used in ch14.18 treatment to prevent expected severe pain events. 
The proportion of patients requiring iv morphine in the continuous infusion studies decreased over the 
cycles but much more in study 303 (from 96 to 11%) than in study 202 (from 100 to 72%).

In study APN311-201, the proportion of patients receiving morphine declined from 100% to 87% by cycle 
5, although it is unclear if it was intravenously in all cases. 
Pain medications other than morphine were allowed in most studies. These included gabapentin, 
acetaminophen, NSAID, ketamine and fentanyl patches (a morphine analogue). In study APN311-303, a 
number of patients (44/54; 81%) received prophylactic naloxone, which is often used to counteract the 
effects of morphine. 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
In the continuous infusion studies APN311-202 and -303, infusion-associated and allergic reactions were 
reported in 73% and 89% of the patients, respectively. Most were of mild or moderate severity. Grade 3 
reactions were reported in 18% and 17% of the patients, respectively. No grade 4 reaction was reported. 
Their incidence decreased from cycle 1 (52% and 74%, respectively) to cycle 5 (29% and 41%, 
respectively). 
Manifestations included hypotension (45% and 63%, respectively), facial, periorbital or lip oedema (2% 
to 44%), bronchospasm (14% and 11%, respectively), urticaria (23% and 24%, respectively) and rashes 
(20% and 31%, respectively). The rate of hypotension, however, needs to be interpreted with caution as 
hypotension is a common complication of iv morphine, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 
antihistamines, which – at least in early treatment cycles- virtually every patient received as concomitant 
medication. 
In study APN311-302, skin allergies were reported in 55% of the patients in the arm without IL-2 and 
65% of patients in the arm with IL-2. 
Across all studies, 46 serious infusion-associated and allergic reactions were reported in 34 patients 
(7%). Reactions reported by more than 2 patients included hypersensitivity (18 patients), hypotension (7 
patients), anaphylactic reaction (5 patients), and bronchospasm (4 patients). All resolved with the 
exception of bronchospasm/laryngospasm, and acute respiratory distress syndrome, further complicated 
by pneumonia and sepsis in one patient (ch14.18/CHO alone), who eventually died of multi-organ failure 
during cycle 3. 
In the total safety database, only 6 patients (1.2%) had a coded anaphylactic reaction/shock, definitely 
diagnosed by the investigator. Following CHMP request, a comprehensive search using PTs terms 
suggestive of an anaphylactic reaction according to literature consensus, chronology and treatment with 
adrenaline resulted in 16/148 patients (from studies APN311-101, -201, -202, -303), i.e. 11% overall 
and 6/148 (4%) with serious reactions. The last figure is consistent with an incidence of 12/366 (3%) in 
study APN311-303.

EMA/263814/2017 
Page 103/129 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoxia/respiratory distress 
In the continuous infusion studies APN311-202 and -303, hypoxia/respiratory failure were reported in 
43% and 44% of the patients, respectively. They were mostly grade 1 or 2. The majority occurred in the 
first two cycles. 
Overall, there were 12 serious hypoxia/respiratory distress events in 11 patients; only 4 cases were 
reported in study APN311-302 (3/4 without IL-2), one of which was eventually fatal (see death section). 
Most SAEs led to interruption or discontinuation of treatment. 
Cytokine release syndrome 
Ten episodes of CRS in 8 patients had been coded by the diagnosis CRS or SIRS and 70 sequences of 
events were considered as possible episodes of CRS. Therefore, in summary 80 episodes of CRS were 
identified. The majority of events (95%) were graded as mild to moderate  
CRS was reported in 36% and 56% of the patients in studies APN311-202 and -303, respectively. Most 
episodes occurred during the first treatment cycle of ch14.18/CHO. In the following cycles the incidence 
of CRS gradually decreased. The majority of events (95%) were graded as mild or moderate and no 
life-threatening event was observed during the episodes of CRS.  
In study APN311-302, CRS occurrence was only slightly increased by the addition of IL-2: 27% of the 
patients in the arm without IL-2 and 35% of patients in the arm with IL-2. Their frequency decreased over 
cycles. Half of CRS events were grade 1 while 10% were severe (grade 3-4). 
Capillary leak syndrome 
A specific analysis was conducted to identify patients who experienced the full clinical picture of CLS 
including the main symptoms of fluid extravasation (oedema), hypoalbuminemia, haemoconcentration, 
and/or hypotension. Variable rates of CLS were reported across studies reflecting the lack of 
standardisation in data reporting and emphasis on this particular ADR, e.g. 36% in study APN311-202 
and 83% in study -303. More than half of the events occurred in the first cycle and their incidence 
gradually decreased over cycles; 10% of the events were reported as serious and 18% as severe (grade 
3-4) with 2 events being life-threatening. 
IL-2 is well known to induce CLS and, in study APN311-302, CLS occurrence was doubled by the addition 
of IL-2: 25% of the patients in the arm without IL-2 and 50% of patients in the arm with IL-2. Their 
frequency decreased over cycles and 10% of the events were severe (grade 3-4) overall, but more with 
IL-2 (12%) than without IL-2 (7%). 
Neurological disorders 
Potentially severe reactions to ch14.18 treatment include neurological disorders of the eye, based on 
binding of the antibody to optic nerve cells.  
In the continuous infusion studies APN311-202 and -303, neurological eye disorders were reported in 
23% and 28% of the patients, respectively. These figures are consistent with the eye toxicities reported 
in study APN311-302: 18% without IL-2 vs 25% with IL-2. Mydriasis and accommodation defects with 
blurred vision were the most common manifestations. Two grade 4 cases were reported, ophtalmoplegia 
(which resolved after 10 months) and optic atrophy. 
Across all studies, SAEs related to neurological eye disorders were reported in 3% of the patients. They 
were resolving or resolved, some with sequelae. 
In the continuous infusion studies APN311-202 and -303, both motor and sensory neuropathies were 
reported with an incidence of 9% and 5%, respectively. These figures are consistent with the peripheral 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 104/129 
 
 
 
 
neurotoxicities reported in study APN311-201 (9%) and in study APN311-302: 7% without IL-2 vs 14% 
with Il-2. Most events were of grade 1-2 and resolved; two patients discontinued treatment. 
Infections 
In the continuous infusion studies APN311-202 and -303, infections were reported in 61% and 76% of the 
patients, respectively. These figures are consistent with the infections reported in study APN311-302: 
58% without IL-2 vs 72% with Il-2. 
However, severe infections (grade 3-4) were more frequent in study APN311-202 (50% of patients) 
compared to 15% in study APN311-303. The reason for this finding is unknown. However, the Applicant 
commented that “study ANP311-202 allowed outpatient treatment with ch14.18/CHO if treatment was 
well tolerated, which may lead to delayed diagnosis and eventually to delayed treatment”. The great 
majority of grade 3 events were device-related infections and more than half of these patients were 
treated at the same centre. According to the Applicant, device-related infections are well-known and 
frequent complications of central venous catheterization and are thus presumably rather related to the 
catheter than to ch14.18/CHO administration. Nevertheless, one patient died of septic shock, which was 
attributed to delayed antibiotic treatment; this outpatient presented with repeated fever episodes and 
was subsequently hospitalised. It does not seem that, in this case, home treatment could be directly 
incriminated in the delayed antibiotic therapy, but according to the Applicant, rather the fact that the 
patient was not followed in a specialised environment. 
Overall, there were 84 serious infection-related events in 63 patients (12%). The occurrence was 
especially high in study APN311-201 after haploidentical SCT (46%), compared to 6% - 23% in the other 
studies. IL-2 did not increase the serious infection rate in study APN311-302: 8% without IL-2 vs 10% 
with IL-2. Overall, three patients died of infectious complications (see death section).  
Others 
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) was diagnosed in 3 patients; however in one case, 
the causality between ch14.18/CHO and PRES was assessed as unlikely due to the chronology of the 
event and alternative possible causes. 
Laboratory findings 
The most common haematological changes assessed as clinically relevant by the investigator were 
decreases in neutrophils, in platelet count and in haemoglobin. The most common clinical chemistry 
abnormalities were abnormal liver function tests (elevated transaminases and gamma-GT) as well as 
elevated CRP. 
Safety in special populations 
N/A 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No studies have been performed. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the continuous infusion study, the number of patients having stopped treatment due to an ADR, as only 
reason or associated with progressive disease, was 6 (6%). These were hypoxia, bronchospasm, 
anaphylactic reaction (3), peripheral neuropathy (1), visual disorder (1), and infection (1).

In study APN311-201, this occurred in 4 patients due to CLS, peripheral neuropathy, psychotic disorder, 
and herpes zoster (unrelated). 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, 514 patients received ch14.18/CHO: 98 patients as a continuous infusion over 10 days and 416 
patients as five daily short 8h-infusions. Overall, 281 patients received ch14.18/CHO in combination with 
IL-2 and 207 patients received antibody treatment as monotherapy; 26 patients received both 
single-agent and combination cycles, but with a very low IL-2 dose used to prevent GvHD. The 
combination also included 13-cis retinoic acid in most studies. In principle, the size of the safety data base 
is acceptable for a rare disorder, especially since the safety profile of anti-GD2 is already known to a large 
extent from published literature. 
It should be emphasized that the method of AE collection varied across studies. In particular, in the 
largest study (APN311-302) only SAEs were fully reported while for other AEs, a pre-defined list of 31 
specific toxicities was used. A similar system was used in study APN311-201 where safety was recorded 
by toxicity forms and AEs that were not already included in the form were to be reported as TEAEs. The 
SAE incidence in study APN311-303 was much lower than in the other R/R studies. A comprehensive 
Applicant’s assessment of grade 4 events did not provide an explanation for the difference in SAE 
reporting compared to study APN311-202. It is likely that, the patients being already hospitalised, the 
difference is mainly due to a different appreciation of “medically significant” events. 
Dosing regimen and pain 
The vast majority of patients across the studies received a dose of 100 mg/m2/cycle, which is 
recommended in the SmPC (i.e. 10 mg/m2/day for 10 days). The target number of cycles and their 
duration differed between studies, but in the continuous infusion studies, the majority of patients 
received 5 (or 6) 35 day-treatment cycles. 
Pain is an anticipated side effect of anti-GD2, which has been managed by standard pain prophylaxis, 
including i.v. morphine. While the morphine dosage somewhat varied across studies, the recommended 
dose is in general at the high end of the paediatric guidelines of pain management. 
There is variation in the infusion scheme (short term (8hr/5 days) vs. continuous infusion (24 hr/10 
days). According to the Applicant, the continuous infusion concept (24h) is associated with an extended 
exposure and lytic pressure leading to a reduction of pain/morphine use, and is therefore proposed as the 
post-marketing administration scheme. However, there is no study directly comparing the continuous 
with the short infusions, and the differences in study design, assessment methodology and data 
presentation severely hamper comparison across studies. 
The two studies using continuous infusion showed similar percentages of patients suffering from pain 
according to parent assessment, which decreased from approximately 90% in cycle 1 to 60% in cycle 5. 
These figures are consistent with the incidence of pain-related events over treatment cycles, although 
parents tended to report pain more often than investigators. 
Simultaneously, the proportion of patients given iv morphine decreased but, much more in study 
APN311-303 (from 96 to 11%) than in study -202 (from 100 to 72%). In those patients receiving 
morphine, the mean cumulative morphine dose was approximately halved by cycle 5 in both studies. 
In the small study using short infusions (APN311-101), the proportion of patients with pain was much 
lower but the Applicant argued that the morphine dose was higher. In the second study using short 
infusions (APN311-201) a decrease in pain incidence from 100% (cycle 1) to 70% (cycle 5) was observed, 
hence slightly worse than in study APN311-202 and -303 (~60%). The proportion of patients receiving 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron

Page 106/129 
 
 
 
 
morphine declined from 100% to 87% by cycle 5, although it is unclear if it was intravenously in all cases; 
this proportion was indeed slightly higher than in study APN311-202 (72%). As there was no obvious 
effect on morphine tolerance, the Applicant did not propose to recommend prophylactic use of naloxone. 
The data available indicate that the correlation between pain and morphine use/dose is not 
straightforward and difficult to interpret. Nevertheless, these data suggest that the pain and morphine 
use were more frequent with short infusions than continuous long-lasting infusion although the difference 
did not appear substantial, and the evidence lacks robustness given the limited sample size. Furthermore, 
the good results regarding morphine use in the single-centre study were not replicated in the multicentre 
study therefore undermining the strength of the conclusion.  
Based on these data, the continuous infusion is not recommended as the only mode of administration as 
this also implies doubling the duration of ch14.18 treatment. No data on the duration of hospitalisation 
with the short infusions have been submitted to compare with that of the continuous infusion (median 
8-10 days). 
As a consequence of the occurrence of pain, premedication with analgesics, including intravenous opioids, 
prior to each infusion of dinutuximab beta is required. A triple therapy, including nonopioid analgesics 
(according to WHO guidelines), gabapentin and opioids, is recommended for pain treatment. The 
individual dose may vary widely. Nonopioid analgesics should be used permanently during the treatment, 
e.g. paracetamol or ibuprofen (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
The patient should be primed with 10 mg/kg/day, starting 3 days prior to dinutuximab beta infusion. The 
daily dose of gabapentin is increased to 2×10 mg/kg/day orally, the next day and to 3×10 mg/kg/day 
orally, the day before the onset of dinutuximab beta infusion and thereafter. The maximum single dose of 
gabapentin is 300 mg. This dosing schedule should be maintained for as long as required by the patient. 
Oral gabapentin should be tapered off after weaning off intravenous morphine infusion, at the latest after 
dinutuximab beta infusion therapy has stopped. 
Treatment with opioids is standard with dinutuximab beta. The first infusion day and course usually 
requires a higher dose than subsequent days and courses.  
•  Before initiation of a continuous intravenous morphine infusion, a bolus infusion of 0.02 to 
0.05 mg/kg/hour morphine should be started 2 hours before dinutuximab beta infusion. 
•  Subsequently, a dosing rate of 0.03 mg/kg/hour is recommended concomitantly with dinutuximab 
beta infusion. 
•  With daily infusions of dinutuximab beta, morphine infusion should be continued at a decreased rate 
(e.g. 0.01 mg/kg/h) for 4 hours after the end of dinutuximab beta infusion. 
•  With continuous infusion, in response to the patient’s pain perception, it may be possible to wean off 
morphine over 5 days by progressively decreasing its dosing rate (e.g. to 0.02 mg/kg/hour, 
0.01 mg/kg/hour, 0.005 mg/kg/hour).  
• 
If continuous morphine infusion is required for more than 5 days, treatment should be gradually 
reduced by 20% per day after the last day of dinutuximab beta infusion. 
After weaning off intravenous morphine, in case of severe neuropathic pain, oral morphine sulphate (0.2 
to 0.4 mg/kg every 4 to 6 hours) can be administered on demand. For moderate neuropathic pain, oral 
tramodol may be administered (see section 4.4 of the SmPC).

There are currently no sufficient data to allow for the administration of ch14.18 in an outpatient setting 
(home treatment). This seems to have been successful in a very specialised centre but has not been 
readily generalised in the multicentre study. In particular, this is likely to have increased the risk of severe 
infections, mostly related to the device used for the infusion, and resulted in a child death due to delayed 
antibiotic therapy in a small hospital not specialised in oncology. 
Safety profile 
The most frequent treatment-emergent AEs were pyrexia, pain, vomiting, cough, increased weight, skin 
reactions, constipation, tachycardia, hypotension, and capillary leak syndrome. Laboratory abnormalities 
were frequent, including increased alanine aminotransferase and gammaglutamyltransferase, anaemia, 
leukopenia, thrombopenia. 
SAEs were reported in 22% of the patients in the compassionate use programme compared with 59% in 
study APN311-202 and 71% in study APN311-201. In study APN311-302, SAEs were reported more 
frequently in patients receiving IL-2 (46%) compared to patients not receiving IL-2 (27%) and led to 
discontinuation of ch14.18/CHO, 13-cis-RA, and/or IL-2 in 17% vs 6% of patients, respectively. However, 
the discontinuation rate in the continuous infusion studies using IL-2 was the same as the latter (6%) and 
about 10% in study APN311-201. 
In the continuous infusion studies APN311-202 and -303, infusion-associated and allergic reactions were 
reported in 73% and 89% of the patients, respectively. Most were of mild or moderate severity. The most 
frequent manifestations included hypotension, urticaria and rashes, bronchospasm and oedema of the 
face. 
In study APN311-302, where only skin allergies were identified, the addition of IL-2 increased their 
frequency only marginally, from 55% to 65%. Across all studies, 46 serious infusion-associated and 
allergic reactions were reported in 34 patients (7%). The occurrence of serious anaphylactic reactions is 
estimated at 3.5%. 
In the continuous infusion studies APN311-202 and -303, hypoxia/respiratory failure were reported in 
43% and 44% of the patients, respectively. Most were mild or moderate and occurred during the first two 
cycles.  
Severe infusion-related reactions, including CRS, anaphylactic and hypersensitivity reactions, may occur 
despite the use of premedication. Occurrence of a severe infusion related reaction (including CRS) 
requires immediate discontinuation of dinutuximab beta therapy and may necessitate emergency 
treatment. 
Cytokine release syndrome frequently manifests itself within minutes to hours of initiating the first 
infusion and is characterised by systemic symptoms such as fever, hypotension and urticaria.  
Anaphylactic reactions may occur as early as within a few minutes of the first infusion with dinutuximab 
beta and are commonly associated with bronchospasm and urticaria (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Antihistamine premedication (e.g. diphenhydramine) should be administered IV approximately 20 
minutes before starting each dinutuximab beta infusion. It is recommended that antihistamine 
administration be repeated every 4 to 6 hours as required during dinutuximab beta infusion. Patients 
should be closely monitored for anaphylaxis and allergic reactions, particularly during the first and second 
treatment course. 
Intravenous antihistamine, epinephrine (adrenaline) and prednisolone for intravenous administration 
should be immediately available at the bedside during administration of dinutuximab beta to manage 
life-threatening allergic reactions. It is recommended that treatment for such reactions include 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 108/129 
 
 
 
 
 
prednisolone administered by intravenous bolus, and epinephrine administered by intravenous bolus 
every 3 to 5 minutes as necessary, according to clinical response. In case of bronchial and/or pulmonary 
hypersensitivity reaction, inhalation with epinephrine (adrenaline) is recommended and should be 
repeated every 2 hours, according to clinical response (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
CLS was reported more frequently in study APN311-303 (83%) than in study APN311-202 (36%), with no 
clear explanation. The vast majority (82%) was grade 1 or 2 and their incidence decreased over 
treatment cycles. In study APN311-302, CLS occurrence was doubled by the addition of IL-2, from 25% 
to 50%. In addition, their severity also increased with IL-2. IL-2 is well known for inducing CLS. CLS 
usually develops within hours after initiation of treatment, while clinical symptoms (i.e. hypotension, 
tachycardia) are reported to occur after 2 to 12 hours. Careful monitoring of circulatory and respiratory 
function is required (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Infections were very frequent in this immunocompromised population: 61%-76% in the continuous 
infusion studies. Severe infections (grade 3-4) were more frequent in study APN311-202 (50% of 
patients) compared to 15% in study APN311-303. The occurrence of severe catheter-related infections in 
these immunocompromised patients is a concern that currently precludes the recommendation of home 
treatment. Patients should have no evidence of systemic infection and any identified infection should be 
under control before starting therapy. 
Neurological disorders of the eye (23%-28%) and peripheral neuropathies (5%-9%) have been reported 
in line with the known toxicities of ch14.18 to the nerve. No dose modification is necessary in the case of 
an impaired visual accommodation that is correctable with eye glasses, as long as this is judged to be 
tolerable. Treatment must be interrupted in patients who experience Grade 3 vision toxicity (i.e. subtotal 
vision loss per toxicity scale). In case of any eye problems, patients should be referred promptly to an 
ophthalmology specialist (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Cases of motor or sensory neuropathy lasting more than 4 days must be evaluated and non-inflammatory 
causes, such as disease progression, infections, metabolic syndromes and concomitant medication, 
should be excluded. Treatment should be permanently discontinued in patients experiencing any 
objective prolonged weakness attributable to dinutuximab beta administration. For patients with 
moderate (Grade 2) neuropathy (motor with or without sensory), treatment should be interrupted and 
may be resumed after neurologic symptoms resolve (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
Occurrence of haematologic toxicities has been reported with Dinutuximab beta Apeiron, such as 
erythropenia, thrombocytopenia or neutropenia. Grade 4 haematologic toxicities, improving to at least 
Grade 2 or baseline values by start of next treatment course, do not require dose modification. 
Regulatory monitoring of liver function and electrolytes is recommended (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
A theoretical risk for indirect reduction of CYP activity due to higher TNF α and IL-6 levels during 
immunotherapy cannot be ruled out. 
Use of systemic corticosteroids is not recommended due to possible interference with immune activation, 
which is necessary for the therapeutic action of the antibody. Vaccinations and the use of intravenous 
immunoglobulins, which may interfere with ch14.18-dependent cellular toxicity, are not recommended 
during immunotherapy (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics.

Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that the data set on the 
clinical safety of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron under normal conditions of use could not be considered 
comprehensive due to the absence of any randomised head-to-head comparison with a placebo. 
Furthermore, the method of data collection in the largest data set (study APN311-302) was incomplete as 
only SAEs were fully reported while for other AEs, a pre-defined list of 31 specific toxicities was used. 
However, it is not considered feasible to generate a comprehensive data set due to ethical considerations 
preventing the conduct of a randomised placebo-controlled trial. At the time of this report, dinutuximab 
is standard of care in the treatment of high risk neuroblastoma, whereby neither physicians nor patients 
would be prepared to participate in a placebo-controlled trial. 
In addition, a comparative trial against the previously authorised dinutuximab product Unituxin (the only 
potentially suitable active control) would not be feasible given the withdrawal of the marketing 
authorisation and since it is unlikely that patients would be willing to participate in a study comparing 
dinutuximab to dinutuximab beta. 
Therefore, the current situation prevents the generation of new controlled data to confirm the outcomes 
of studies APN311-202, -303, and -302. 
The CHMP was therefore of the view that a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
should be granted subject to specific obligations, including the implementation of the drug registry 
SAFARY proposed by the Applicant. In addition to general longer-term safety information, data will be 
specifically generated on pain intensity and need for pain medications, effect on peripheral and central 
nervous system, including visual impairment, anti-tumour response and longer-term effectiveness. 
The specific obligations will be reviewed annually and continuation of the authorisation shall be linked to 
these annual re-assessments. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The evaluation of safety is hampered by the absence of controlled trials without ch14.18 and by the 
heterogeneity of data collection across the academic trials. However, the safety profile of anti-GD2 
antibodies is already known from the literature. Following CHMP request, the Applicant has performed 
numerous analyses of the safety data and most characteristics of the safety profile of the product are now 
adequately described.  
The CHMP considered that the safety data were not comprehensive and that the following measure is 
necessary to generate additional safety data in the context of a marketing authorisation under 
exceptional circumstances: 
•  A drug registry (SAFARY) will collect specific data on pain intensity and need for pain medications, 
effect on peripheral and central nervous system, including visual impairment, and longer-term safety 
as well as on anti-tumour response and longer-term effectiveness.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 7.0 (signed 22 March 2017) is

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
2.9.1.  Problem statement 
This application was submitted in accordance with Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC and it contained a 
claim and discussion as to why the active substance dinutuximab beta should be regarded as new. 
The applicant requested the active substance dinutuximab beta contained in the above medicinal product 
to be considered a new active substance in comparison to the known dinutuximab previously authorised 
in the European Union as Unituxin, and claimed that dinutuximab beta differs significantly in properties 
with regard to safety and efficacy from the already authorised substance. 
2.9.2.  Scientific evaluation 
2.9.2.1.  Quality aspects 
Position of the Applicant 
Dinutuximab beta (ch14.18/CHO, APN311) is a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal anti GD2 IgG1 
antibody expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells, which is the active substance used to 
manufacture the APN311 drug product (Dinutuximab beta Apeiron). Dinutuximab beta specifically binds 
to the disialoganglioside GD2. This glycolipid is expressed on neuroblastoma cells. Dinutuximab beta 
binds to cell surface GD2 and induces cell lysis of GD2-expressing cells via complement-dependent 
cytotoxicity (CDC) and antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). 
Dinutuximab (Unituxin), a mouse-human chimeric monoclonal anti GD2 IgG1 antibody expressed in an 
SP2-0 murine cell line sharing the same amino acid sequence and targeting the same antigen. Unituxin 
received marketing authorization in the European Union on August 14, 2015. 
Due to the alternative expression systems, there are significant differences in glycosylation between the 
two products. Dinutuximab (Unituxin) contains galactose-α-1,3-galactose (Gal1-alpha3Gal) epitopes. 
Terminal Gal1-alpha3Gal-glycostructures on proteins have been well demonstrated for potential to cause 
allergic/hypersensitivity reactions (up to anaphylaxis) in humans ((Commins et al., 2016), (Steinke et al., 
2015); (Commins et al., 2014); (Berg et al., 2014); (Chung et al., 2008)). These allergic reactions can be 
induced by repeated exposure (i.e. classical immunization) to the drug but more importantly they can 
also be triggered immediately during/after the first contact to the respective protein as most humans 
already exhibit a pre-formed anti-Gal1-alpha3Gal antibody immune response. One very well documented

pharmaceutical case is the SP2/0 cell-derived monoclonal anti-EGFR antibody cetuximab which has been 
approved for the treatment of colon carcinoma and SCCHN cancers ((Maier et al., 2015); (Chung et al., 
2008)) 
Proof of presence of Gal1-alpha3Gal epitopes on dinutuximab: During the assessment of the marketing 
authorization application for dinutuximab (Procedure No. EMEA/H/C/002800/0000) by the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA), the EMA clearly confirmed the presence of galactose alpha-1,3-galactose 
glycosylation patterns on dinutuximab (Unituxin) and their potential role in triggering of allergic 
(including anaphylaxis) reaction by requesting the following information from United Therapeutics: “An 
update on the measurement of antibodies against non-human glycans as ch14.18, which is produced in 
rodent cells, contains galactose alpha-1,3-galactose (Gal1-alpha3Gal) and N-glycolylneuraminic acid and 
natural occurring antibodies to non-human glycans may be involved in some of the allergic reactions 
reported with ch14.18” (cited from (EMA_D120_List_of_Clinical_Questions_to_dinutuximab, 2015)). 
The presence of galactose alpha-1,3-galactose residues on dinutuximab was further confirmed in the EMA 
assessment report for dinutuximab ((EMA_EPAR_dinutuximab, 2015), p. 17) as well as a presentation 
given by the lead author of the dinutuximab clinical trial publications, Prof. Yu, at the 2014 ANR (Advances 
in Neuroblastoma Association) meeting held in Cologne, Germany (Yu, 2014). On this occasion it was 
presented that based on the results from COG Study ANBL 0032 performed with Unituxin, the association 
of total anti- α-Gal antibody levels with ≥ grade 1 allergic reaction is statistically significant. 
In contrast, Apeiron has demonstrated with highly sensitive bioanalytical methods, that no Gal1-alpha 
3Gal-epitopes are present on several batches of ch14.18/CHO. This result was (partly) expected as CHO 
cells (like human cells) produce no or only very low levels of terminal Gal1-alpha3Gal-glycoforms in 
contrast to murine SP2/0 cells (Zhong, 2012).  
The results of a head-to-head comparative glycosylation analysis performed on Dinutuximab beta Apeiron 
(Ref. SR-951.PI) vs Unituxin (batch 2600694) and “NCI-like” material (derived from a fermentation using 
the initial SP2-0 research cell line as applied for manufacture of clinical ch14.18/SP2-0 material by the 
NCI) are provided in Table 1, clearly illustrating the differences in the glycosylation pattern of both 
monoclonal antibodies, Dinutuximab beta Apeiron and Unituxin. Dinutuximab beta Apeiron completely 
lacks alpha-gal N-glycosylation, whereas Unituxin carries 1.12% alpha-gal determinants.

Table 51: 
Head-to-head batch comparison data on glycosylation patterns performed for different batches of 
Dinutuximab beta Apeiron T65, T90, T110, GMP2, GMP3, GMP4, GMP5 and reference standard SR-951PI) 
confirm that the differences in glycosylation are not effects of batch-to-batch variability, and therefore 
represent unique molecular features of the different antibodies due to the different expression hosts. 
In support of the Applicant’s claim, an expert opinion provided by Prof. Dr. Uri Galili, who spent major 
parts of his scientific career in investigating α-gal epitopes and its immunological features, which was 
acknowledged by the naming “Galili epitopes”, is included.  
In conclusion, and in line with the expert opinion of Prof. Dr. Galili, the absence of α-gal epitopes is the 
only guarantee to avoid possible α-gal epitope associated anaphylactic reactions, which may have a fatal 
outcome for patients. It also may help to reduce the severity and frequency of treatment associated 
allergic reactions, which could be clearly attributed to be associated with the Unituxin combination 
therapy and the presence of anti-Gal antibodies by the principal investigator of COG study ANBL0032 (Yu, 
A.L., ANR, 2014).

Based on the facts listed above, it has been sufficiently demonstrated that the absence of α-gal epitopes 
in ch14.18/CHO is a specific feature of the utilized CHO production cell line, consistently resulting in 
differences in critical quality attributes (CQAs). 
Discussion on quality aspects 
 Dinutuximab beta Apeiron (ch14.18/CHO) dinutuximab beta has the same amino acid sequence as 
Unituxin (ch14.18) dinutuximab. The plasmid used for the transfection of CHO cells to generate the RCB 
and subsequent MCB for dinutuximab beta (Dinutuximab beta Apeiron) was the same as that used 
previously for the generation of ch14.18-producing murine myeloma cells SP2/0 (ch14.18/SP2/0) and 
NS0 (ch14.18/NS0) in early development. Therefore, these have the same primary molecular structure. 
These products are manufactured according to a different manufacturing process and they have a slightly 
different glycosylation profile. The difference in expression system and the subsequent difference in the 
presence/absence of galactose-1,3α-galactose structures (Unituxin 1.12%; Dinutuximab beta Apeiron 
Not Detectable) are noted, but the absolute amount of Gal-1,3α-Gal structures is considered small. 
Additional data from the ‘NCI-like’ material from the ch14.18/SP2-0 cell line is not relevant in this 
context, since the comparison is only with the product (Unituxin) to be used clinically. 
It has been the policy of the CHMP that changes in the manufacturing process of a given product, or 
differences between the manufacturing processes of two different products (e.g. a biosimilar product and 
its Reference Medicinal Product) do not require a new INN, New Active Substance (NAS) status, and/or 
another qualification that the two active substances are somehow different. Such a status is only 
warranted if the differences in manufacturing processes result in relevant differences between the two 
products. Therefore, the mere fact that the manufacturing processes of dinutuximab (Unituxin) and 
dinutuximab beta (Dinutuximab beta Apeiron) are different is not sufficient to grant NAS status. 
Conclusions on quality aspects 
From a quality perspective, it is accepted that differences in the glycosylation profile exist. 
However, the mere fact that the manufacturing processes of dinutuximab-beta (Dinutuximab beta 
Apeiron) and dinutuximab (Unituxin) are different (leading to differences in the glycosylation profile) is 
not sufficient to grant NAS status. According to Notice to Applicants Volume 2A, Chapter 1, Annex I, 
indent 3, a new active substance includes “a biological substance previously authorised in a medicinal 
product in the European Union, but differing significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or 
efficacy which is due to differences in one or a combination of the following: in molecular structure, nature 
of the source material or manufacturing process”. 
2.9.2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Position of the Applicant 
Following i.v. application both monoclonal antibodies dinutuximab and dinutuximab beta trigger 
complement-dependant (CDC) resulting in activation of the complement cascade and lysis of target cells, 
as well as antibody-dependant cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC), mediated by recruitment of natural killer (NK) 
cells via the Fc-receptor (CD16, FcγR) interaction of the constant region of the heavy chains and finally 
also leading to target cell lysis. 
However, in contrast to CDC activity, a 10-fold difference was observed with regard to induction of ADCC 
measured with dinutuximab beta triggering a significantly stronger ADCC activity than ch14.18/SP2/0 
and ch14.18/NS0 at the lower concentration range (Zeng 2005). In addition a head-to-head comparison 
of Unituxin (batch 2600694) and Dinutuximab beta Apeiron (batch 102092; GMP-4) revealed differences 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 117/129 
 
 
 
 
in CD16 (FcγR) and FcRn binding activity. The lower CD16 binding activity may be the reason for lower 
ADCC activity of Unituxin, although such difference could not finally be proven for the Unituxin batch 
investigated, which may be a result of the variability of the ADCC assay itself. 
Furthermore, Unituxin showed a different FcRn binding kinetic (lower Ka values), compared to 
Dinutuximab beta Apeiron. Whether this would translate into a clinically meaningful difference in PK 
parameters is not clear, however these results provide additional evidence of differences in important 
parameters associated with the mechanism of action of both entities.  
The cause for these observations in favour of dinutuximab beta probably is to be found in the different 
glycosylation patterns of the antibodies as their amino acid sequences/CDRs are identical. A reduction of 
fucose content within the glycosylation site of antibody Fc domains is reported to result in an increase of 
ADCC activity (see also Module 2.4, section 2.1.2). This effect is caused by the higher affinity binding of 
the fucose-reduced antibody to the FcgammaRIIIa receptor on natural killer cells. 
In conclusion, glycosylation and differences in the glycosylation profile represent an important part of the 
chemical structure of biologic molecules. In addition to the differences in the chemical 
composition/structure, differences in the glycosylation patterns also determine differences in the biologic 
activity and the safety profile of biologic molecules, which for Dinutuximab beta Apeiron vs Unituxin is 
demonstrated by respective differences in the safety profile, Dinutuximab beta Apeiron (dinutuximab 
beta, ch14.18/CHO) is considered to qualify for the New Active Substance status. 
Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
A head-to-head comparison of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron (batch 102092; GMP-4) and Unituxin (batch 
2600694) showed differences in CD16 (FcγRIIIa) and FcRn binding activity. The lower CD16 binding 
activity may be the reason for a lower ADCC activity of Unituxin (reported in the literature, Zeng 2005), 
although such difference was not proven for the Unituxin batch investigated. A reduction of fucose 
content within the glycosylation site of antibody Fc domains is reported to result in higher affinity binding 
of CD16 (FcγRIIIa) and a subsequent increase of ADCC activity. However, no difference in impact on 
biological activity has been demonstrated. 
Dinutuximab beta Apeiron showed different FcRn binding kinetics to Unituxin (lower Ka values for 
Unituxin). Whether this would translate into a clinically meaningful difference in PK parameters is not 
established.  
There are no meaningful differences between ch14.18/CHO and ch14.18/SP2-0 from a non-clinical point 
of view. 
2.9.2.3.  Clinical aspects 
Position of the Applicant 
The presence of a1.3-Gal structures is commonly known to being associated with the occurrence of 
treatment related allergic/anaphylactic reactions. 
Due to the severity of the potential outcome, which may be fatal, and the rapid onset of anaphylactic 
reactions, any possibility to reduce their frequency/probability has to be considered to be of significant 
benefit for patient safety. The frequency of anaphylactic reactions observed in clinical studies performed 
with APN311 (ch14.18/CHO), are discussed extensively in the D180 response to Q37. In conclusion, the 
results of a detailed search for anaphylactic reactions, based on a consensus paper driven search 
algorithm, revealed a potential worst case frequency of anaphylactic reactions of 4.1% (n=148) in the 
studies APN311-101, APN311-201, APN311-202, and APN311-303. This is in line with a frequency of 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 118/129 
 
 
 
 
3.3% reported from the supportive study APN311-302. Overall, among all studies only 6 patients (i.e. 
1%), had a coded anaphylactic reaction/shock, definitely diagnosed by the investigator. For Unituxin the 
frequency of reported anaphylaxis was reported to be 10% (see EMA EPAR Dinutuximab, 2015, p79). In 
any case the difference in the reported anaphylactic reactions is magnitudes more beneficial for APN311 
vs. Unituxin (10-fold). Even in case of a worst case scenario comparison of potential anaphylactic 
reactions identified by the implementation of the above mentioned search algorithm, in comparison to the 
actually reported anaphylactic reactions for Unituxin, the result for APN31 remains significantly better 
(about 2.5-fold). 
However, it cannot be proven that this significant difference can solely be attributed to the presence α- gal 
epitopes in Unituxin (ch14.18/SP2-0) or if potential synergistic effects of the concomitant GM-CSF 
administration plays a role. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
Cross-study comparison between Unituxin and Dinutuximab beta Apeiron studies is hampered by major 
uncertainties around AE definition, collection, reporting and analyses. For both products, studies were led 
and sponsored by clinicians, and generally no standardised methods were applied across studies and 
centres. Importantly, in the largest trial with Dinutuximab beta Apeiron (study APN311-302), only serious 
anaphylactic reactions were isolated, as for non-serious reactions, they were all combined under generic 
toxicity terms (e.g. “allergy” as part as “skin toxicity”). 
Nevertheless, cross-study comparisons have been attempted. The overall rate of anaphylactic reactions, 
using an algorithm in the case of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron (based on preferred terms and concomitant 
use of adrenaline) is 16/148 (10.8%) in the pooled small trials. In the Unituxin trials, the rate of 
anaphylactic reaction reports is 176/984 (17.9%) in the pooled population and 28/114 (24.6%) in the 
pivotal trial ANBL0032 (EMA EPAR Dinutuximab, 2015, p75). Therefore, a very conservative comparison 
(given the different evaluation method and the small sample for Dinutuximab beta Apeiron) would 
provide an approximate 2-fold ratio in favour of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron. 
When focusing on serious anaphylactic reactions, a comparison of the rates of anaphylactic reactions 
reported as such by the investigators would provide a 4- to 8-fold ratio in favour of Dinutuximab beta 
Apeiron. However, when using a conservative estimate in the case of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron (using 
the same algorithm), the ratio becomes 1.6 in the comparison of the first-line pivotal trial (5.3% vs 3.3%) 
and 2.7 when comparing the pooled populations (9.5% vs 4.1%), hence again an approximate 2-fold 
ratio. 
Overall, a 2-fold ratio is not is not sufficiently high to conclude on a safety difference given the 
uncertainties about cross-study comparisons previously highlighted. Moreover, there are other 
differences between the studies that need to be taken into account as they could have affected the 
occurrence/frequency of anaphylactic reactions; these include differences in treatment modalities 
(presence/absence of GM-CSF co-administration, differences in premedication or dosing schedule) and 
the experience gained with anti-GD2 treatment and management of ADRs. Therefore, the relationship 
between the reported difference in anaphylactic reactions and the presence/absence of alpha-gal 
epitopes is not considered established. 
Based on the available quality, non-clinical and clinical data, the CHMP considers that dinutuximab beta, 
which have some differences in molecular structure, nature of the source material or manufacturing 
process, does not differ significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from dinutuximab 
contained in medicinal product Unituxin previously authorised within the European Union on 14 August 
2015 and therefore is not considered to be a new active substance.

2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Dinutuximab beta Apeiron 
(dinutuximab beta) is included in the additional monitoring list as: 
It is a biological product authorised after 1 January 2011; 
It is approved under exceptional circumstances [REG Art 14(8), DIR Art (22)] 
It has a PASS imposed at the time of authorisation; [REG Art 9(4)(cb), DIR Art 21a(b)]. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The indication as recommended by CHMP is as follows: 
Treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and above, who have previously 
received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, followed by myeloablative 
therapy and stem cell transplantation, as well as patients with history of relapsed or refractory 
neuroblastoma, with or without residual disease. Prior to the treatment of relapsed neuroblastoma, any 
actively progressing disease should be stabilised by other suitable measures. 
In patients with a history of relapsed/refractory disease and in patients who have not achieved a complete 
response after first line therapy, Dinutuximab beta Apeiron should be combined with interleukin 2 (IL 2). 
Neuroblastoma is an embryonal tumour of the autonomic nervous system, meaning that the cell of origin 
is thought to be a developing and incompletely committed precursor cell derived from neural-crest 
tissues. Neuroblastomas generally occur in very young children; the median age at diagnosis is 17 
months. The tumours arise in tissues of the sympathetic nervous system, typically in the adrenal medulla 
or paraspinal ganglia, and thus can present as mass lesions in the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
For high-risk neuroblastomas, the first-line treatment can be divided into three distinct phases: 
• 
induction of remission with intensive chemotherapy. The backbone of the most commonly used 
induction therapy includes dose-intensive cycles of cisplatin and etoposide alternating with 
vincristine, cyclophosphamide, and doxorubicin. Topotecan was added to this regimen based on the 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 120/129 
 
 
 
 
 
anti-neuroblastoma activity seen in relapsed patients. After a response to chemotherapy, resection of 
the primary tumour is usually attempted. 
• 
• 
consolidation of the remission with myeloablative chemotherapy which attempts to eradicate minimal 
residual disease using lethal doses of chemotherapy followed rapidly by rescue with autologous 
hematopoietic progenitor cells to repopulate the bone marrow. 
and finally a maintenance phase used to treat potential minimal residual disease (MRD) following 
HSCT to reduce the risk of relapse, e.g. with ch14.18 (dinutuximab) and isotretinoin, a molecule that 
induces terminal differentiation of neuroblastoma cell lines. 
In the recurrent setting, treatment has evolved in the recent era and comprises salvage chemotherapy, 
radiotherapy and surgery, 131I-MIBG therapy, and ch14.18 monoclonal antibody therapy with 
aldesleukin-2 (IL-2) and oral isotretinoin (13-cis RA). 
Therefore, in both the first-line and relapsed/refractory settings, ch14.18 has become standard of care to 
treat residual disease. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main studies are: 
- Study APN311-303, a retrospective data collection from the compassionate use of the product in a single 
centre where a heterogeneous population of patients with neuroblastoma in the relapsed/refractory 
setting was treated. 
- Study APN311-302, a randomised controlled Phase III trial comparing the effect of IL-2 added to the 
combination of ch14.18 and 13-cis RA after first-line therapy. 
A supportive phase I/II study evaluating ch14.18 /CHO administered with IL-2 in patients with 
relapsed/refractory neuroblastoma  has also been submitted (Study APN311-202). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Relapsed/refractory setting 
For the total population of studies APN311-303 and 202, the overall response (CR+PR) at the end of 
treatment (i.e. approximately 6 to 8 months after treatment initiation or earlier in case of progressive 
disease) was 26/72 (36%; 95%CI [25, 48]) in patients with detectable disease, out of whom 9 (13%) had 
a CR, while disease had progressed in 29/72 patients (40%; 95%CI [29, 52]). In patients with R/R 
disease, the ORR was 42% (14/33) in study APN311-202 and 28% (10/36) in study APN311-303 but 
given the small numbers, confidence intervals are largely overlapping. 
At 1-year, event-free survival (EFS) was 52% in both studies and overall survival (OS) was 89% and 
92%, respectively. At 2-year, EFS was lower in study APN311-303 (35%) than in study APN311-202 
(47%) while the opposite trend was observed for OS: 75% and 63%, respectively. 
First-line setting 
Study APN311-302 provided survival data with and without the addition of IL-2. The 3-year EFS (primary 
endpoint) showed rates of 55% without IL-2 and 61% with IL-2 while the 3-year OS rates were 64% and 
69%, respectively.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The evaluation of drug exposure and its potential impact on efficacy is not considered robust. 
Measurement of ch14.18/CHO concentrations has been conducted at different analytical centres using 
different dilutions, capturing antibodies; interference/matrix effects have been observed with all applied 
methods and as such comparison of serum APN311 levels between (and even within) studies is uncertain 
and this hampers the PopPK analysis and investigation of exposure-effect relationships. 
Due to poor drug tolerance of the new validated HACA assay, the immunogenicity data are not considered 
reliable. The Applicant’s analyses of the impact of HACAS on PD, efficacy and safety can only be 
considered exploratory. Extensive work is requested post-authorisation (see Annex II) to further 
characterise the PK and immunogenicity profile of the product; in particular, since the product is highly 
toxic, the benefit of completing all treatment cycles after developing HACAs should be investigated. 
The OS data currently available are immature and are only reliable for up to 2 years in the R/R studies and 
3 years for the first-line study. Updated survival data to confirm the effectiveness of immunotherapy are 
requested post-authorisation (see Annex II). 
There is still some level of uncertainty about the add-on effect of IL-2. It is agreed that the differences in 
EFS and OS reported in study APN311-302 were small although the rates in the +IL-2 arm tended to be 
(numerically) higher than the rates in the –IL-2 arm, in particular at the later time points. This would 
indicate that there is no or only limited added benefit of the addition of IL-2 to the treatment with APN311 
in the first-line setting without residual disease. Whether this is also true for patients with residual disease 
is doubtful based on the APN311-302 study results. In a post-hoc analysis, a numerical difference (8-9%) 
in 3-year survival rates was reported for patients with evidence of disease before immunotherapy in 
contrast to those without, i.e. with complete response to previous therapies. Importantly also, the 
additive effect of Il-2 is not known for patients with relapsed/refractory disease as the effect of omitting 
IL-2 in the treatment has not been studied in this population. Therefore, the MAH should provide the 
results of the Phase II study comparing Dinutuximab beta Apeiron monotherapy vs combination with IL-2 
in the R/R setting (see Annex II). 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the two studies using the dosing regimen with continuous infusion in combination with IL-2 and 13-cis 
RA, all 98 patients experienced treatment-emergent AEs; the most frequent were pyrexia, pain at various 
sites (especially abdominal and extremities), gastrointestinal (constipation, vomiting, diarrhoea), 
cutaneous (pruritus, dry skin, rash, urticaria), haematological (anaemia, neutropaenia, 
thrombocytopaenia), abnormal liver function tests (ALT, GGT), capillary leak syndrome (with oedema, 
increased weight), hypotension, tachycardia, and cough (possibly allergic). 
Most patients experienced at least one severe (grade 3/4) AE (94%) in the compassionate use 
programme although out of 3700 TEAEs, only 12% were grade 3 and 1% grade 4, which indicates that 
this treatment is associated with significant toxicity. The most frequent severe AEs were pain, abnormal 
haematological and liver function tests, pyrexia, infections, allergic reactions and capillary leak 
syndrome. Most severe and serious AEs were considered related to the treatment. 
Despite the regimen of a continuous infusion over 10 days, severe pain (score ≥ 7) was reported by one 
third to half of the patients, although its incidence decreased over the cycles: from approximately 90% in 
cycle 1 to 60% in cycle 5. Simultaneously, the proportion of patients given iv morphine decreased but, 
much more in study APN311-303 (from 96 to 11%) than in study -202 (from 100 to 72%). In those 
patients receiving morphine, the mean cumulative morphine dose was approximately halved by cycle 5 in 
both studies. 
Assessment Report - Dinutuximab beta Apeiron   
EMA/263814/2017 
Page 122/129 
 
 
 
 
Currently, in the whole database (514 patients), four deaths could be considered as treatment-related 
and resulted from a capillary leak syndrome, an acute respiratory distress syndrome (possibly related to 
an anaphylactic reaction), an herpes encephalitis (probably related to the prior allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation), and septic shock likely to be device-related in an outpatient.  
The safety data generated in study APN311-302 enable to evaluate the additional toxicity of IL-2 
combined with ch14.18/CHO. The most important difference relates to SAEs, which were reported in 46% 
of the patients receiving IL-2 compared to 27% of the patients not receiving IL-2. The addition of IL-2 
doubled the occurrence of CLS (from 25% to 50%) although only 10% were severe. This translated into 
a higher discontinuation rate due to toxicity: 17% vs 6%. Therefore, a safety benefit is notable for 
monotherapy over the combination with IL-2. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The evaluation of safety is hampered by the absence of control arms without ch14.18 in the trials and by 
the heterogeneity of data collection across the academic trials. However, the safety profile of anti-GD2 
monoclonal antibodies is already known to a large extent and the available data are largely in line with 
current knowledge. 
Reliable immunogenicity data have not been provided due to bioanalytical issues. There were no 
consistent relationships between ADA positivity and efficacy measure response, EFS and OS between 
studies. Neither was there a correlation between ADA positivity and TEAE. As indicated by the Applicant, 
the current analyses are considered exploratory only and further research will be conducted to enable 
conclusive interpretations (see Annex II). 
No long term safety data are currently available but this will be addressed with a post-authorisation drug 
registry (see Annex II).

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Advances in neuroblastoma treatment over the last three decades have resulted in ability to cure over 
70% of children using risk-directed therapeutic approaches. However, until very recently, the outcome of 
high-risk neuroblastoma, especially in children older than 18 months with metastatic disease, remained 
poor. Despite intensive multimodal therapy, over 50% of patients with high-risk neuroblastoma relapsed 
with a dismal long-term outcome. In recent years, they have been offered a wide variety of salvage

treatments following disease recurrence. Up to half of these patients achieved some response or stable 
disease, and survival after relapse was longer in patients who had received salvage therapy. In an INRG 
analysis of 2,266 patients who experienced first progression/relapse, the median time to relapse was 13 
months, and 5-year OS from the time of first relapse was 20% (London & Castel et al, 2011). The longer 
survival after relapse is also likely due to early detection of disease recurrence as a result of employing 
more sophisticated surveillance studies in recent years. Many of the factors at diagnosis that are 
prognostic of survival also influence survival after disease progression or relapse. In addition, time to first 
relapse is a significant adverse factor for survival. 
Therefore, for patients categorized as high risk disease and for those with low or intermediate risk disease 
that do not respond or have relapsed on appropriate front-line treatment, there is still an unmet medical 
need.  
As anti-GD2 became standard practice after the publication of the ECOG trial in 2009, it became very 
difficult for the Applicant to conduct randomised studies.  
The efficacy of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron is supported by anti-tumour response at the end of the 
treatment cycles and overall survival compared to historical controls. While none of these outcomes on its 
own would be sufficient to establish efficacy, it is considered that, by the combination of the provided 
evidence (early tumour response to treatment and long-term survival data), the efficacy of APN311 is 
made plausible, even though the exact effect size is not fully known. 
Ch14.18 and IL-2 is a regimen with well-known severe toxicities, the management of which requires a 
considerable level of medication. Pain, hypersensitivity reactions and capillary leak syndrome are major 
adverse events associated with anti-GD2 therapies. However, the safety profile is comparable to other 
anti-GD2 treatment. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall B/R of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron for the  
“Treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and above, who have previously 
received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, followed by myeloablative 
therapy and stem cell transplantation, as well as patients with history of relapsed or refractory 
neuroblastoma, with or without residual disease. Prior to the treatment of relapsed neuroblastoma, any 
actively progressing disease should be stabilised by other suitable measures. 
In patients with a history of relapsed/refractory disease and in patients who have not achieved a complete 
response after first line therapy, Dinutuximab beta Apeiron should be combined with interleukin 2 (IL 2).” 
is positive. 
First-line indication 
All patients included in study APN311-302 were treated with immunotherapy. In total 370 patients were 
enrolled. A comparison to an historical control group obtained from study HRNBL1-R1 showed that the 
percentage of patients that were still alive after 3 year of follow up was 12 % (59% vs 71%, for MAT and 
MAT+ immunotherapy respectively) higher after APN311 treatment than for patients who did not receive 
immunotherapy. Altogether, it is considered that in this population, immunotherapy increases survival of 
these patients, and therefore, the benefit-risk balance of APN311 for this patient population is positive. 
However, for patients with residual disease after previous therapies, available data suggest that the 
combination to IL-2 may be of benefit, and therefore, should be recommended in these patients. 
Relapse/Refractory setting

For patients with a history of relapsed disease, two main studies were submitted. Both studies were single 
arm studies and included patients who had a history of relapsed disease but had CR or VGPR/PR/SD on 
latest treatment; patients with PD were excluded from the study.  
Two cohorts of controls were identified by the Applicant in an Italian Registry and in the earlier phase (R1 
– 2002-2010) of the SIOPEN High Risk Neuroblastoma Study (HRNBL1) before immunotherapy was 
introduced. 
Comparative analyses have been conducted between these controls and individual APN311 studies as well 
as pooled studies (for the relapse setting). All these analyses point out in the same direction, i.e. showing 
that immunotherapy improves survival in relapsed patients. The replication of the results provides 
reassurance about the treatment benefit even if its extent cannot be accurately quantified. 
In the R/R setting, anti-tumour activity has been evaluated in patients with residual disease after salvage 
therapy. In a pooled analysis of the two APN311 studies, a response rate of 36% is achieved at the end 
of treatment, with 13% of complete response. 
In the absence of a randomised controlled trial, none of these outcomes on its own would be sufficient to 
establish efficacy. However, it is considered that taken together, early anti-tumour response and 
long-term survival provide plausible evidence of efficacy. 
As the combination to IL-2 has been used in both trials, it is recommended in this setting before new data 
become available. 
As safety and efficacy has not been established in patients less than 12 months of age (although patients 
in this age category are likely to be rare), the indication is limited to patients above this age. 
The CHMP furthermore considered that Dinutuximab beta Apeiron should be restricted to hospital-use 
only and must be administered under the supervision of a physician experienced in the use of oncological 
therapies. It must also be administered by a healthcare professional in an environment where full 
resuscitation services are immediately available. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
Taking into account all available data, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk balance of Dinutuximab 
beta Apeiron in the treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma is positive.  
However, the CHMP is of the view that the data set on the clinical efficacy and safety of Dinutuximab beta 
Apeiron cannot be considered comprehensive. 
The CHMP agreed that it was not feasible to produce comprehensive data under normal conditions of use 
of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron due to ethical considerations preventing the conduct of a randomised 
placebo-controlled trial. In addition, a comparative trial against Unituxin (the only acceptable potential 
active control) is not expected to be feasible given the withdrawal of the marketing authorisation. In 
addition, it is unlikely that patients would be willing to participate to a study comparing Unituxin to 
dinutuximab beta. 
The CHMP is therefore of the view that a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances should 
be granted subject to a number of specific obligations: 
• 
In order to further investigate the benefits of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron in the treatment of 
high-risk neuroblastoma a drug registry (SAFARY) has been proposed by the Applicant. The 
objective is to collect more data on pain and its management, effect on peripheral and central

nervous system, including visual impairment, long-term safety as well as short- and long-term 
effectiveness. Annual reports should be submitted as part of the annual re-assessment. 
•  A PK/PD and immunogenicity evaluation should be conducted in order to better define the 
posology in children over the entire age range and the impact of HACAs on PD, efficacy and 
safety. This will be based on an analysis of plasma samples collected from patients in studies 
APN311-202v1-2-3 and APN311-304 according to an agreed protocol. Fully validated analytical 
drug and HACA assays that cover the time course of exposure should be used for this evaluation. 
When submitting these data, the Applicant should provide further evidence of the robustness of 
the drug assay and of the drug tolerance of the binding and neutralising HACA assays. 
• 
• 
In order to evaluate the add-on effect of IL-2 in patients with high risk relapsed/refractory 
neuroblastoma, the MAH will submit the results of study APN311-202v3. 
In order to further estimate the long-term survival effect of dinutuximab beta, the MAH will 
submit at least 5-year survival data for patients included in studies APN311-202 and 
APN311-302. 
Data from these studies should be generated on a regular basis for review in the context of the annual 
re-assessments. 
Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances is considered 
appropriate. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of Dinutuximab beta Apeiron is favourable in the following indication: 
“Treatment of high-risk neuroblastoma in patients aged 12 months and above, who have previously 
received induction chemotherapy and achieved at least a partial response, followed by myeloablative 
therapy and stem cell transplantation, as well as patients with history of relapsed or refractory 
neuroblastoma, with or without residual disease. Prior to the treatment of relapsed neuroblastoma, any 
actively progressing disease should be stabilised by other suitable measures. 
In patients with a history of relapsed/refractory disease and in patients who have not achieved a complete 
response after first line therapy, Dinutuximab beta Apeiron should be combined with interleukin-2 
(IL22).” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions:

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that dinutuximab beta, which have some 
differences in molecular structure, nature of the source material or manufacturing process, does not differ

significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from dinutuximab contained in medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union and therefore is not considered to be a new 
active substance. 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0094/2014 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

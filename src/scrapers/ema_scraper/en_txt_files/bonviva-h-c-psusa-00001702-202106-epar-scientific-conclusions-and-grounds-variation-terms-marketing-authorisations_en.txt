Scientific conclusions 
Taking  into  account  the  PRAC  Assessment  Report  on  the  PSUR(s)  for  ibandronic  acid,  sodium 
ibandronate, the scientific conclusions of CHMP  are as follows:  
In  view of  available data  on  hypocalcaemia from spontaneous  reports including  in  some  cases a  close 
temporal relationship,  a  positive de-challenge and  the  fact  that  hypocalcaemia is  an  identified  risk for 
ibandronic  acid,  the  PRAC  considers  that  a  causal  relationship  between  ibandronic  acid  and 
hypocalcaemia is established.  The PRAC concluded that  the product  inf ormation of  products containing 
ibandronic acid (osteoporotic indication (Bonviva)) should be amended accordingly.  
Update  of  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  to  add  the  ADR hypocalcaemia with  a  frequency uncommon.  The 
Package leaflet is updated accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with  the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation  to the  terms of the marketing  authorisation(s)  
On  the  basis  of  the  scientific  conclusions for  ibandronic  acid,  sodium  ibandronate  the  CHMP  is  of  the 
opinion  that  the  benefit-risk  balance  of  the  medicinal  product(s)  containing  ibandronic  acid,  sodium 
ibandronate is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information  
The CHMP recommends that  the terms of the  marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

2. Scientific discussion
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
End of December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was informed about a cluster of cases of 
viral pneumonia of unknown cause in Wuhan, China. In mid-January 2020 the pathogen causing this 
atypical pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2) and genome sequence data were published. Since then, the virus has spread globally and on 30 
January 2020 the WHO declared the outbreak a Public Health Emergency of International Concern and on 
11 March 2020 a pandemic. The pandemic is ongoing despite unprecedented efforts to control the 
outbreak. According to ECDC, histologic findings from the lungs include diffuse alveolar damage similar to 
lung injury caused by other respiratory viruses, such as MERS-CoV and influenza virus. A distinctive 
characteristic of SARS-CoV-2 infection is vascular damage, with severe endothelial injury, widespread 
thrombosis, microangiopathy and angiogenesis. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 6/63 
State the claimed the therapeutic indication 
The proposed indication and dosing administration for Nuvaxovid are: 
•
Proposed indication: Nuvaxovid is indicated for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19
caused by SARS-CoV-2 in individuals 12 years of age and older (extension including 12 to <18
year olds)
• Dosing administration: Nuvaxovid is administered intramuscularly as a course of 2 doses of
0.5 mL each. It is recommended to administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose (see
section 5.1 of the SmPC).
Epidemiology and risk factors 
The majority of SARS-CoV-2 infections result in asymptomatic or mild disease with full recovery. 
Underlying health conditions such as hypertension, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, chronic respiratory 
disease, chronic kidney disease, immune compromised status, cancer and obesity are considered risk 
factors for developing severe COVID-19. Other risk factors include organ transplantation and 
chromosomal abnormalities. Increasing age is another risk factor for severe disease and death due to 
COVID-19. COVID-19 in adolescents is mostly a mild disease although severe cases also occur rarely.  
Following worldwide spread of the original SARS-CoV-2 strain, more numerous variants have emerged 
with several variants characterised as Variants of Concern and being dominant in circulation at different 
times: the B.1.1.7 (Alpha), P.1 (Gamma), B.1.351 (Beta), B.1.617.2 (Delta), and B.1.1.529 (Omicron) 
variants of SARS CoV-2, respectively, with confirmed acquisition of mutations in key antigenic sites in the 
receptor-binding domain (RBD) and N-terminal domain of the S protein. At present, the Omicron variant 
is the dominant circulating variant in Europe. Omicron was listed as a VOC by the WHO on 26 November 
2021; it has at least 30 amino acid substitutions in the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, including 15 in the RBD, 
that suggest this variant will also be associated with significant reductions in neutralising activity by 
vaccine sera.  
Aetiology and pathogenesis 
SARS-CoV-2 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA (+ssRNA) virus, with a single linear RNA segment. 
SARS-CoV-2 has four structural proteins, known as the S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane), and N 
(nucleocapsid) proteins. The spike protein contains a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to 
increase pathogenicity and transmissibility in other viruses. The spike is responsible for allowing the virus 
to attach to and fuse with the membrane of a host cell, and is considered a relevant antigen for vaccine 
development because it was shown that antibodies directed against it neutralise the virus and it elicits an 
immune response that prevents infection in animals. 
Transmission occurs primarily via respiratory droplets from coughs and sneezes and through aerosols. 
The median incubation period after infection to the development of symptoms is four to five days. Most 
symptomatic individuals experience symptoms within two to seven days after exposure, and almost all 
symptomatic individuals will experience one or more symptoms before day twelve. Common symptoms 
include fever, cough, fatigue, breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste and symptoms may 
change over time. The major complication of severe COVID-19 is acute respiratory distress syndrome 
(ARDS) presenting with dyspnoea and acute respiratory failure that requires mechanical ventilation. In 
addition to respiratory sequelae, severe COVID-19 has been linked to cardiovascular sequelae, such as 
myocardial injury, arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy and heart failure, acute kidney injury often requiring 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 7/63 
renal replacement therapy, neurological complications such as encephalopathy, and acute ischemic 
stroke. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The severity of COVID-19 varies. The disease may take a mild course with few or no symptoms, 
resembling other common upper respiratory diseases such as the common cold. Mild cases typically 
recover within two weeks, while those with severe or critical diseases may take three to six weeks to 
recover.  
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defined COVID 19 symptoms as including 1 or 
more of the following:  
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
Fever
New or increased cough
New or increased shortness of breath
Chills
New or increased muscle pain
New loss of taste or smell
Sore throat
Diarrhoea
Vomiting
Fatigue
Headache
Nasal congestion or runny nose
Nausea
Among those who have died, the time from symptom onset to death has ranged from two to eight weeks. 
Prolonged prothrombin time and elevated C-reactive protein levels on admission to the hospital are 
associated with severe course of COVID-19 and with a transfer to ICU. 
The gold standard method of testing for presence of SARS-CoV-2 is the reverse transcription polymerase 
chain reaction (RT-PCR), which detects the presence of viral RNA fragments. As this test detects RNA but 
not infectious virus, its ability to determine duration of infectivity of patients is limited. The test is 
typically done on respiratory samples obtained by a nasopharyngeal swab, a nasal swab or sputum 
sample. 
Management 
The management of COVID-19 cases has developed during 2020, and includes supportive care, which 
may include fluid therapy, oxygen support, and supporting other affected vital organs. Treatment of 
hospitalised patients encompass anti-inflammatory agents such as dexamethasone and statins, targeted 
immunomodulatory agents and anticoagulants as well as antiviral therapy (e.g. remdesivir, monoclonal 
antibodies). 
These therapies have shown variable and limited impact on the severity and duration of illness, with 
different efficacies depending on the stage of illness and manifestations of disease. While care for 
individuals with COVID-19 has improved with clinical experience, there remains an urgent and unmet 
medical need for vaccines able to prevent or mitigate COVID-19 infections during the ongoing pandemic. 
Especially protection of vulnerable groups and mitigating the effects of the pandemic on a population level 
are desired.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Nuvaxovid (also referred to in this report as NVX-CoV2373) is a vaccine developed for prevention of 
COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2.  
Nuvaxovid is composed of purified full-length SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike (S) protein that is stabilised 
in its prefusion conformation. The addition of the saponin-based Matrix-M adjuvant facilitates activation of 
the cells of the innate immune system, which enhances the magnitude of the S protein-specific immune 
response. The two vaccine components elicit B- and T-cell immune responses to the S protein, including 
neutralising antibodies, which may contribute to protection against COVID-19. 
Nuvaxovid is administered intramuscularly as a course of 2 doses of 0.5 mL each. It is recommended to 
administer the second dose 3 weeks after the first dose. 
The intended indication for Nuvaxovid is ‘for active immunisation to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-
CoV-2 in individuals 12 years of age and older’. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH has not applied for CHMP scientific advice on the paediatric development of Nuvaxovid. A PIP 
has been agreed (PIP P/0126/2021) and the current study is part of the PIP.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The MAH states that all clinical studies were performed in accordance with GCP. The submitted study, 
2019nCoV-301, was also included in the application for initial approval. The trial has been expanded to 
include adolescents aged 12 to <18 years. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
Furthermore, the MAH has provided a statement to the effect that all clinical trials conducted outside the 
European Union were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Tabular overview of clinical studies
The clinical development program for SARS-CoV-2 rS with Matrix-M adjuvant in adolescent participants 
12 to < 18 years of age comprises the ongoing paediatric expansion of Clinical Study 2019nCoV-301: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Table 1. Ongoing MAH-Sponsored Clinical Study of SARS-CoV-2 rS Vaccine with Matrix-M Adjuvant in 
Adolescent Participants 12 to < 18 Years of Age Across the SARS-CoV-2 rS Vaccine Clinical Development 
Programme 
2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Immunogenicity results are presented together with the efficacy analysis. 
A summary of immunogenicity, clinical virology and diagnostic assays used in the adolescent study is 
given in the table below. All the immunogenicity assays shown in the table are based on the index SARS-
CoV-2 strain from the start of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019 (Wu 2020), on which the SARS-
CoV-2 rS (BV2373) spike protein vaccine antigen is also based. 
All assays have been used consistently through the clinical development programme, and are known to 
provide credible and reliable results. All assays have been formally validated, and the assays were 
assessed in detail for the application for conditional marketing authorisation (CMA) for NVX-CoV2373 use 
in individuals > 18 years of age. 
Thus, the in vitro immunogenicity assays employed in the adolescent study are fit for purpose and raise 
no concerns.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main study 
Study 2019nCoV-301, a phase 3, randomised, placebo controlled study to evaluate the efficacy, safety 
and immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 recombinant spike protein nanoparticle vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 rS) 
with Matrix M1 adjuvant in adult participants ≥ 18 years with a paediatric expansion in adolescents (12 to 
<18 years). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 11/63 
Methods 
Study participants 
The paediatric expansion enrolled healthy or medically stable adolescent participants 12 to < 18 years of 
age without a history of previous laboratory confirmed diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection / COVID-19. 
Persons with clinically significant immunosuppression, who were breastfeeding, pregnant or who were 
planning to become pregnant were excluded from participation.  
Treatments 
Participants received 2 intramuscular (IM) 0.5 mL injections of SARS-CoV-2 rS (5 μg) + Matrix-M1 
adjuvant (50 μg) (NVX-CoV2373) or placebo (normal saline) on D0 and D21. Following the accrual of 2 
months safety data, participants were offered the alternative vaccine/placebo in a blinded fashion. 
Objectives 
The following primary objectives were determined for the paediatric expansion: 
•
To evaluate the efficacy of a 2-dose regimen of SARS-CoV-2 rS adjuvanted with Matrix-M1 compared
to placebo against PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 illness diagnosed ≥ 7 days after completion
of the second injection in the initial set of vaccinations of adolescent participants 12 to < 18 years of
age.
•
To describe the safety experience for the vaccine versus placebo in adolescent participants (12 to <
18 years of age) based on solicited short-term reactogenicity by toxicity grade for 7 days following
each vaccination (Days 0 and 21) after the initial set of vaccinations.
•
•
•
•
To assess overall safety through 49 days (28 days after second injection of each set of vaccinations
[initial and crossover]) by comparing vaccine versus placebo for all unsolicited AEs and MAAEs.
To assess the frequency and severity of MAAEs attributed to vaccine, AESIs, or SAEs through the EoS
and to compare vaccine versus placebo after each set of vaccinations (initial and crossover).
To assess all-cause mortality in vaccine versus placebo recipients after each set of vaccinations (initial
and crossover).
To assess non-inferiority of the neutralising antibody response for all adolescent participants
seronegative to anti-SARS-CoV-2 NP antibodies at baseline, compared with that observed in
seronegative adult participants 18 to < 26 years of age from the Adult Main Study (Immunogenicity
Population participants before crossover).
Secondary objectives were: 
•
To evaluate the efficacy of a 2-dose regimen of SARS-CoV-2 rS adjuvanted with Matrix-M1 compared
to placebo against PCR-confirmed symptomatic COVID-19 illness due to SARS-CoV-2 variant not
considered as a “variant of concern /interest” according to the CDC Variants Classification, diagnosed
≥ 7 days after completion of the second injection in the initial set of vaccinations of adolescent
participants 12 to < 18 years of age.
•
To evaluate the efficacy of a 2-dose regimen of SARS-CoV-2 rS adjuvanted with Matrix-M1 compared
to placebo against PCR-confirmed moderate-to-severely symptomatic COVID-19 illness diagnosed ≥ 7

days after completion of the second vaccination in the initial set of vaccinations of adolescent 
participants 12 to < 18 years of age. 
To assess VE against ANY symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection.
To assess VE according to race and ethnicity.
To assess the durability of VE (measured by all defined efficacy endpoints) in adolescents after initial
active vaccine recipients versus crossover (delayed) active vaccine recipients.
To monitor occurrence and severity of COVID-19 cases by following participant-reported symptoms.
To assess the neutralising antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 for adolescent participants by subsets
with and without anti-NP antibodies at baseline, compared with that observed in adult participants 18
to < 26 years of age from the Adult Main Study (Immunogenicity Population participants before
crossover).
•
To assess the anti-spike IgG antibody response and hACE2 inhibiting antibody response at Day 35 for
adolescent participants by subsets with and without detectable anti-NP antibodies at baseline,
compared with that observed in adult participants 18 to < 26 years of age from the Adult Main Study
(Immunogenicity Population participants before crossover).
Exploratory objectives were: 
•
To evaluate the efficacy of study vaccine compared to placebo against PCR-confirmed symptomatic
COVID-19 illness due to a SARS-CoV-2 variant considered as a “variant of concern / interest”
according to the CDC Variants Classification, diagnosed ≥ 7 days after completion of the second
vaccination in the initial set of vaccinations of adolescent participants 12 to < 18 years of age.

Endpoint collection methods 
Starting on Day 4, throughout the first 12 months of the study, parent(s)/caregiver(s) of participants 
were asked to report symptoms of COVID-19 (see Table 3 for symptoms suggestive of COVID-19) to the 
site as soon as possible after symptoms onset, or during the weekly remote contact. Fever and other 
symptoms of COVID-19 (including date of onset, duration, etc.) were collected in a paper memory aid 
and were reported to the sites by the parent(s)/caregiver(s) either as a spontaneous phone call or during 
the weekly remote contact during the first 12 months. If the parent(s)/caregiver(s) report symptoms 
compatible with COVID-19 by spontaneous contact or during the weekly contact, the study site then 
scheduled an in-person Acute Illness Visit.

Page 14/63 
Table 3.  Symptoms suggestive of COVID-19 
At the in-person Acute Illness Visit, participants were queried regarding AE symptoms, concomitant 
medications taken for these symptoms, underwent a targeted physical examination (to include oxygen 
[O2] saturation and respiratory rate), as indicated by participant’s signs and symptoms, and obtained by 
the study personnel a medically attended nasal swab, and a blood sample for serologic testing. Medically 
attended swabs collected at the Acute Illness Visit were processed at the study site for shipment to the 
central laboratory according to established procedures as described in the Laboratory Manual. 
All Acute Illness Visits and assessments performed during the visits were recorded in the participant’s 
electronic case report form (eCRF). Study participants that had medically attended nasal swabs were 
confirmed at the central laboratory to be PCR-positive for SARS-CoV-2 at the Acute Illness Visit were 
contacted by the study site to arrange a Convalescent Visit. The Convalescent Visit was to occur 
approximately 1 month (or as soon thereafter, as feasible) after the onset of the PCR-confirmed case of 
COVID-19 at the Acute Illness Visit to assess status of AEs, record the clinical course of the disease on 
the Endpoint Form, and obtain a blood sample for convalescent serologic testing. 
Nasal swabs of the anterior nares were obtained at the study site on Day 0 (prior to study vaccination), at 
the Acute Illness Visit, and at the first crossover vaccination visit. There was no self-swab collection in the 
adolescent participants. 
Immunogenicity Endpoint: 
• Neutralising antibody response at Day 35 for all adolescent participants seronegative to anti-
SARS-CoV-2 NP antibodies at baseline, compared with that observed in seronegative adult
participants 18 to < 26 years of age from the Adult Main Study (Immunogenicity Population
participants before crossover).
Immunogenicity assessments 
The primary immunogenicity endpoint was determined with a validated wild-type virus 
microneutralisation assay. There are 7 scheduled blood draws for immunogenicity assessments at the Day 
0, 21, 35, C1 (Day 180), and Months 12, 18, and 24 visits, and during visits (acute illness / convalescent 
/general). For participants in the CMI cohort only (n = ~50), additional blood was collected to obtain 
PBMCs at the Day 0, 7, and 28 visits. 
Secondary Endpoints: 
•
First episode of PCR-positive COVID-19, as defined under the primary endpoint, shown by gene
sequencing to represent a variant not considered as a “variant of concern / interest” according to
the CDC Variants Classification.
•

Sample size 
The sample size for the paediatric expansion was chosen to provide an adequate safety database of ≥ 
2,000 paediatric recipients of investigational product to support licensure of NVX-CoV2373 in adolescent 
participants 12 to < 18 years of age. With 2,000 participants in the active vaccine group, there is a >90% 
probability of observing at least 1 participant with an AE if the true incidence of the AE is 0.12% and a 
99% probability if the true incidence of the AE is 0.23%. Recruitment of study participants intended to 
attempt to enrol a similar number of adolescent participants in the 12 to < 15 and 15 to < 18 year old 
age groups. 
The analysis of efficacy in the paediatric expansion was descriptive in nature using the same methods as 
the adult part of the study but with no formal statistical hypothesis tested. 
A non-randomised non-inferiority (NI) analysis of immunogenicity (neutralising antibodies) was 
performed using a random sample of 750 adult participants aged 18 to < 26 years of age from the adult 
part of the study to provide approximately 400 adult participants for the NI analysis, accounting for the 
2:1 randomisation and 500 adult participants accounting for 20% non-evaluability. Similarly, 750 
adolescent participants were randomly selected from the paediatric expansion for testing of neutralisation 
titers, which provided approximately 400 adolescent participants for the NI analysis, accounting for the 
2:1 randomisation and 20% non-evaluability. 
Assuming a standard deviation of log10 neutralisation antibody titer of 0.6, there was over 85% power 
(through simulations) to demonstrate the first 2 NI criteria when assuming an underlying GMT for the 18 
to < 26 years of age group up to 1.1-fold higher than the 12 to < 18 years of age group. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 16/63 
With seroconversion (SCR) defined as ≥ 4-fold increase in neutralisation titers (MN50) at Day 35 relative 
to baseline titres, and assumed SCRs of 95% in the 18 to < 26 years of age group, there was over 80% 
power to demonstrate the third NI criterion for a difference as large as 4% lower in the 12 to < 18 years 
of age group. A descriptive assessment of immunogenicity evaluated the same criteria in the 12 to < 15 
and 15 to < 18 years of age groups separately. 
Unlike neutralising antibody responses that were only assessed in a subset of adolescent participants, 
anti-S IgG antibody responses and hACE2 receptor binding inhibition antibody responses were assessed 
in the totality of the adolescent participants that were part of the PP-IMM (per-protocol immunogenicity) 
population and PP-IMM-2 population (which includes all participants regardless of sero- and PCR-status at 
baseline) (see statistical methods section below). 
Randomisation 
Participants were randomised to study treatment in a 2:1 ratio via block randomisation according to a list 
produced by the biostatistics CRO. As block size is considered potentially unblinding information, it will be 
known to the Study Biostatistician only. An IWRS will be responsible for the allocation of randomisation 
numbers to individual participants. No stratification by site was conducted, however, at the time of 
randomisation of a participant at a site, a full block will be assigned to the site in order to maintain 
treatment assignment balance in the planned ratio at each site and allow for site and region effects to be 
assessed. Efforts were made to enrol similar numbers of participants in the subgroups 12 to < 15 years of 
age, and 15 to < 18 years of age. 
The non-inferiority analysis comprised a non-randomised comparison. 
Enrolment of the full adolescent cohort of participants (12 to < 18 years) will be contingent upon the 
review of early safety data (i.e., 7 days of reactogenicity and overall safety post-dose 1) to be reviewed 
in the first ~60 enrolled adolescents (randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive 5 μg SARS-CoV-2 rS 
adjuvanted with 50 μg Matrix-M1 or placebo) before enrolment of the remainder of the adolescent 
participants (N=~2,940). Likewise, administration receipt of the second vaccine dose to the full 
participant population will be contingent upon the review of early safety data (i.e., 7 days of 
reactogenicity and overall safety post-dose 2) in the first ~60 enrolled adolescents before dosing the 
remainder of the adolescent participants. 
Blinding (masking) 
This is an observer-blinded study. To maintain the blind, placebo vaccination via IM route will be included 
and unblinded study site personnel will manage vaccine logistics, preparation, and administration 
according to the Pharmacy Manual so as to maintain the blind from the remainder of the study site 
personnel and participants. The unblinded study site personnel may administer study vaccine if qualified 
to do so, but will not be involved in study-related assessments or have participant contact for data 
collection after administration of trial vaccine. At the time of implementation of the blinded crossover 
period, a similar procedure will be employed to ensure that all study participants and personnel remain 
blinded as to initial and subsequent treatment assignment. 
Statistical methods 
There were 7 main analysis sets used in this trial: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 17/63 
• The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Analysis Set included all participants who were randomised, regardless of
protocol violations or missing data. The ITT analysis set was used for participant disposition summaries 
and was analysed according to the treatment arm to which the participant was randomised. 
• The Full Analysis Set (FAS) included all participants who were randomised and received at least 1 dose
of study vaccine/placebo, regardless of protocol violations or missing data. Participants who were 
unblinded with an intention to receive other COVID-19 vaccines were censored at the time of unblinding. 
The FAS population was analysed according to the treatment group to which participants were 
randomised. The FAS analysis sets were used for supportive analyses. When the efficacy endpoints were 
analysed using FAS, baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity or nasal swab PCR-positivity was ignored. 
• The Safety Analysis Set included all participants who received at least 1 dose of study vaccine/placebo.
Participants in the Safety Analysis Set were analysed according to the treatment actually received. In 
cases where information is available that indicated that a participant received both active and placebo 
vaccine during the initial period, the participant was analysed as part of the active group. 
• The Per-Protocol Efficacy (PP-EFF) Analysis Set included all participants who received the full prescribed
regimen of trial vaccine and had no major protocol deviations that occurred before the first COVID-19 
positive episode (i.e., participant was censored at the time of the protocol deviation) and were 
determined to affect the efficacy outcomes, including baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity or nasal swab 
PCR-positivity. Participants who were unblinded with an intention to receive other COVID-19 vaccines 
were censored at the time of unblinding. Although the study enrolled participants regardless of SARS-
CoV-2 serologic status at the time of initial vaccination, any participants with confirmed infection or prior 
infection due to SARS-CoV-2 at baseline, by nasal swab PCR or serology, were excluded from the PP-EFF 
population. PP-EFF was the primary set for all efficacy endpoints. Participants determined to have positive 
nasal swab PCR or serology immediately prior to the first crossover vaccination will be excluded from the 
post-crossover PP-EFF population. 
• A second PP-EFF (PP-EFF-2) Analysis Set was defined to allow for evaluation of baseline serostatus
analysis’ impact on VE. The PP-EFF-2 Analysis Set followed the same method described in the PP-EFF 
population with the exception that it included all participants regardless of baseline serostatus (based on 
anti-NP). The analysis of VE using this population was dependent on whether there existed an endpoint 
event for the relevant analysis in a participant who had a baseline positive anti-NP result. 
• The Per Protocol Immunogenicity (PP-IMM) Analysis Set was determined for each study visit and may
be assay specific (i.e., serum vs PBMC, and within serum IgG, MN, hACE2). The PP-IMM Analysis Set 
included participants that had at least a baseline and 1 serum sample result available after vaccination 
and had no major protocol violations that were considered clinically relevant to impact immunological 
measures prior to the visit in question. The PP-IMM Analysis Set also excluded participants who had a 
PCR positive nasal swab between baseline up to the visit analysed. All participants in the PP-IMM analysis 
population were designated at time of vaccination within the immunogenicity subset. For participant visits 
on or after Day 21, participants had to receive the second vaccination to be included in the PP-IMM 
Analysis Set. Durability of immune responses will be evaluated in participants who provided serologic data 
at Months 12, 18, and 24, taking into account when they received active vaccine and if/when they were 
infected with SARS-CoV-2, based on PCR or serology. 
• A second Per Protocol Immunogenicity (PP-IMM-2) Analysis Set was defined to allow for evaluation of
baseline serostatus analysis’s impact on immune response. The PP-IMM-2 Analysis Set followed the same 
method described in the PP-IMM population with the exception that it included prior exposed participants 
determined using baseline SARS-CoV-2 nasal swab or seropositivity at screening to assess if immune 
responses differed between previously exposed and unexposed individuals. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 18/63 
The review and determination for exclusion from the PP-EFF, PP-EFF-2, PP-IMM, and PP-IMM-2 Analysis 
Sets were carried out in a blinded fashion prior to unblinding for the analysis. 
General Statistical Conventions 
Unless otherwise stated, all statistical testing was two-sided and was performed using a significance 
(alpha) of 0.05 However, as the study was set up being descriptive, these p-values are of limited 
relevance. Two-sided 95% CIs were provided when relevant. 
Immunology data consisting of ELISA unit (EU) and titer data were summarised using geometric means, 
also known as geometric mean EUs/titers (GMEU/GMT), geometric mean fold rise (GMFR) and 
seroconversion rate (SCR). Immunology results below the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) were 
summarised and reported using 0.5 × LLOQ. Immunology results above the upper limit of quantification 
(ULOQ) were summarised and reported using the ULOQ. For categorical variables, summaries included 
counts of participants and percentages. CIs surrounding proportions may be constructed using a normal 
approximation for larger samples and exact methods for smaller samples, whichever was appropriate for 
the data. The two-sided 95% CI on this difference of seroresponse rates will be computed based on the 
method of Miettinen and Nurminen. 
The paediatric expansion part of this study was not adjusted for multiplicity. 
Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine if there was a difference in efficacy and safety of the 
vaccine by age group (12 to < 15 years of age, 15 to < 18 years of age), gender, race, and ethnicity. 
These analyses may be conducted in the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety analysis sets as 
appropriate for the type of analysis being conducted.  
All analyses were descriptive. 
Primary Efficacy analyses 
The VE was defined as VE (%) = (1 – RR) × 100, where RR = relative risk of incidence rates between the 
2 trial vaccine groups (NVX-CoV2373/placebo). The RR was estimated by exponentiating the treatment 
group coefficient from a Poisson regression analysis with robust error variance [Zou 2004]. A Poisson 
regression model utilising robust error variance and an offset to account for variable follow-up time was 
used to estimate the RR and VE. A two-sided CI around the estimate also provided the Maximum 
Likelihood Estimator (MLE) 95% CI around the VE. Due to the potential for sparse numbers of cases 
among potential covariates, some covariates were not considered in the model. 
Provided that the Poisson model converges, a Cox proportional hazard (CPH) model using the same 
dependent and explanatory variables was developed as a supportive analysis. 
In the case where there were zero endpoints for one of the vaccine groups or the total number of 
endpoints in both treatment groups combined was less than 5, a Poisson model was substituted with an 
exact conditional binomial method. 
The primary analysis was conducted in the PP-EFF and FAS analysis sets. Additionally, the primary 
efficacy endpoint may be evaluated in the PP-EFF-2 population among the seropositive and seronegative 
participants. 
Primary Immunogenicity analyses 
A formal non-randomised NI analysis of the primary effectiveness endpoint, neutralising antibody to 
SARS-CoV-2 at Day 35, was carried out using the PP-IMM analysis set. The NI analysis of adolescent 
participants compared with the 18 to < 26 year old immunogenicity cohort from the adult part of the 
study was performed using the point estimate and upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI on the ratio of 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 19/63 
GMTs between 2 age cohorts (adults 18 to < 26 year old cohort in the adult part of the study/adolescent 
cohort in the paediatric extension) against the prespecified success criteria. The ratio of GMTs between 
the 2 age cohorts and the corresponding two-sided 95% CI were calculated on log-transformed titers 
using the analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with age cohort and baseline (Day 0) measurement as the 
covariate. In addition, the difference of SCRs between the 2 age cohorts was computed using a definition 
of seroconversion as 4-fold rise in neutralisation titers at Day 35 relative to Day 0. The two-sided 95% CI 
on this difference of SCRs was computed based on the method of Miettinen and Nurminen. 
Successful demonstration of NI (primary immunogenicity objective) required meeting the following 3 pre-
specified criteria simultaneously: 
1. Upper bound of two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) for the ratio of geometric mean titers
(GMTs) (GMT18-< 26yo /GMT12-<18yo) < 1.5 
2. Point estimate of the ratio of GMTs ≤ 1.22 (estimated as square root of 1.5)
3. Upper bound of the two-sided 95% CI for difference of seroconversion rates (SCR) (SCR18-
<26yo - SCR12-<18yo) was < 10%

The paediatric expansion of Study 2019nCoV-301 was initiated on 26 April 2021 (first sentinel participant 
screened), and after safety review of sentinel participants on 06 May 2021, enrolment was resumed and 
completed on 05 June 2021 at 73 sites across the US.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 21/63 
The data cut-off date for this analysis was 27 September 2021, with data extraction on 06 October 2021. 
At the time of this analysis, the Delta (B.1.617.2 and AY lineages) variant of concern (VOC) was the 
predominant variant circulating in the US. The study remains ongoing through approximately 2 years of 
follow-up from the Day 21 injection.

In total, 1136 participants recorded at least 1 protocol deviation – 741 (49.9%) in the NVX-CoV2373 
group compared with 395 (52.8%) in the placebo group. The majority (83.4%) of these deviations 
concerned minor protocol deviations, mostly relating to visit schedules. 
Protocol deviations that were considered exclusionary for the PP-EFF and PP-IMM Analysis Sets occurred 
slightly more frequently in the placebo group than in the NVX-CoV2373 group. 
Approximately 6.3% of participants were unblinded to study treatment assignment during the course of 
the study. The most frequent (incidence > 4.0%) reason for study unblinding was due to a participant 
request for EUA-approved vaccine (4.5%). There was a small imbalance between treatment groups in 
participants that requested unblinding with the intention to receive EUA vaccine, with a higher proportion 
of placebo recipients (5.3%) requesting unblinding than vaccine recipients (4.0%). It is speculated that 
this difference may reflect the perception of study participants based on their reactogenicity symptoms or 
serologic testing outside of the study.

Baseline data 
The median age (range) of participants was 14.0 years (12 – 17 years), with 67.1% of adolescent 
participants being 12 to < 15 years of age. As EUA vaccine was available and recommended for 
adolescents 16 to < 18 years of age during the period this trial was enrolling, the goal of similar 
representation in the 12 to < 15 years and 15 to < 18 years subgroups was not achieved. Nearly half the 
adolescent participants were female, and most adolescent participants were White (74.4%) and not of 
Hispanic or Latino origin (81.3%). Approximately 27% of adolescent participants were obese (≥ 30.0 
kg/m2), and approximately 16% of adolescent participants had either anti-NP serology or PCR-positivity 
evidence of prior exposure to SARSCoV-2 (Table 6).

medical history of 0.4% of participants. 
Demographics and baseline characteristics of the PP-EFF Analysis Set were also well balanced between 
the 2 treatment groups and similar to those of the Safety Analysis Set, except that no participants were 
seropositive or PCR-positive. Demographics and baseline characteristics of the PP-IMM Analysis Set were

Vaccine Efficacy against PCR-Confirmed Symptomatic Mild, Moderate, or Severe COVID-19 with Onset 
from at Least 7 Days after Second Vaccination in Baseline Serologically Negative/PCR-negative Adolescent 
Participants 
There was a total of 20 cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 with 
onset from at least 7 says after second vaccination in the PP-EFF Analysis Set; 6 (0.5%) in the NVX-
CoV2373 group and 14 (2.4%) in the placebo group, all of which were mild in severity. Case distribution 
resulted in a VE of NVX-CoV2373 for preventing symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 in 
baseline seronegative/ PCR—negative adolescent participants of 79.54% (95% CI: 46.83, 92.13). 
Sensitivity analysis resulted in a VE of 79.39% (95% CI: 46.34, 92.08).

specific for SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus at Day 35 (14 days after second vaccination) in both baseline 
serologically negative/PCR-negative and baseline serologically or PCR-positive adolescent participants 
were increased relative to placebo and showed similar patterns of response, with higher levels in the

evident in serologically or PCR-positive adolescent participants. Participants were labelled as serologically 
negative for the immunogenicity populations if their baseline anti-NP and PCR results were negative or 
missing. Participants were labelled serologically positive for these populations if their baseline anti-NP or

PCR results were positive. At 2 weeks following second vaccination in most participants (Day 35), 
neutralising antibody GMTs in the NVX-CoV2373 group were markedly increased relative to placebo for all 
participants (4,429.3 vs 21.3, respectively); for baseline serologically or PCR-positive participants 
(9,151.3 vs 149.3) relative to placebo; and for baseline serologically negative/PCR negative participants

Serum IgG response by baseline serostatus: Serum IgG levels specific to SARS-CoV-2 rS protein were 
measured in all adolescent participants at Day 0 (baseline) and Day 35 (14 days after second vaccination) 
using a validated anti-S IgG ELISA (Novavax Clinical Immunology, Gaithersburg, MD, US). The LLOQ for 
this assay was 200 ELISA units per mL (EU/mL), with titers below this level documented as 100 EU/mL. 
At Day 0 (baseline), serum IgG antibody GMEUs were 194.9 and 211.6 in all NVX-CoV2373 and placebo 
recipients respectively regardless of baseline serostatus; 3,737.3 and 4,403.2 in serologically or PCR-
positive NVX-CoV2373 and placebo recipients; and 112.3 and 113.2 in baseline serologically 
negative/PCR-negative NVX-CoV2373 and placebo recipients.  
At 2 weeks following second vaccination in most participants (Day 35), serum IgG antibody GMEUs in the

Serum IgG response by age: Responses are summarised in Table 16 
At 2 weeks following second vaccination (Day 35), serum IgG antibody GMEUs in the NVXCoV2373 group 
were markedly increased relative to placebo across the age groups with no evidence of placebo response. 
Serum IgG antibody GMEUs in the NVX-CoV2373 group were approximately 1.2-fold higher in the 
younger age cohort (12 to < 15 years of age) than in the older age cohort (15 to < 18 years of age). 
These immune responses equated to serum IgG antibody GMFRs relative to baseline (Day 0) of 1,226.1, 
1,309.7, and 1,064.7, respectively, across the 3 age groups in the NVX-CoV2373 groups. SCRs in the 
NVX-CoV2373 groups also were increased relative to placebo across all age groups.

Secondary efficacy endpoints 
All cases were mild in severity. There were no moderate or severe cases of COVID-19 among NVX-
CoV2373 or placebo adolescent recipients.  
Of the 20 primary endpoint cases in the PP-EFF Analysis Set, viral genetic sequences were available for 
11 samples (55%) from adolescent participants with PCR confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or 
severe COVID-19, 3 (0.2%) in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 8 (1.3%) in the placebo group with all cases 
classified as Delta VOC, resulting in an estimated VE of 82.0% (95% CI: 32.4, 95.2) due to a SARS-CoV-
2 variant considered as a VOC/VOI, which was represented only by the Delta VOC. 
The PP-EFF-2 analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in adolescent participants regardless of baseline 
serostatus was similar to that of the PP-EFF analysis. There were 21 cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic 
mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 with onset from at least 7 days after second vaccination accrued for 
this analysis, with 6 (0.4%; all mild cases) in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 15 (2.1%; all mild cases) in 
the placebo group. NVX-CoV2373 prevented PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe 
COVID-19 with onset from at least 7 days after second vaccination in adolescent participants regardless 
of baseline serostatus with results similar to those of the primary efficacy endpoint (VE = 80.8% [95% 
CI: 50.5, 92.5]). 
There were a total of 29 cases of PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 with 
onset from first vaccination (FAS); 11 (0.7%) in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 18 (2.4%) in the placebo 
group, all of which were mild in severity. NVX-CoV2373 prevented PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, 
moderate, or severe COVID-19 with onset from first injection in adolescent participants regardless of 
baseline serostatus (VE = 69.74 [95% CI: 36.00, 85.69]).

Cumulative rates of PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, and severe COVID-19 begin to diverge 
between 20 and 40 days after first vaccination. 
Figure 1: Cumulative Incidence Curve of PCR-Confirmed Mild, Moderate, or Severe COVID-19 Disease with Onset 
from First Vaccination in Adolescent Participants Who Received at Least 1 Dose of Study Vaccine Regardless of 
Baseline Serostatus (FAS)

μg Matrix-M1 adjuvant; PCR = polymerase chain reaction; SARS-CoV-2 rS = severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
2 recombinant spike protein nanoparticle vaccine. 
There were no cases in the per-protocol analysis set (PP-EFF) that did not meet the mild, moderate, or 
severe COVID-19 definition set forth in the protocol. Thus, VE against any symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 
infection (PCR-positive nasal swab and ≥ 1 of any of the symptoms in the section “Clinical presentation, 
diagnosis”) was identical to that against mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19: 79.5% (95% CI 46.8, 
92.1). 
Ancillary analyses 
Efficacy by subgroup 
Subgroup analyses based on key demographic and baseline characteristics were performed on the PP-EFF 
Analysis Set. VEs of NVX-CoV2373 to prevent symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 in 
baseline seronegative/PCR-negative adolescent participants were reported in the following subgroups: 
•
•
Participants 12 to < 15 years of age: 80.67% (95% CI: 38.47, 93.93)
Participants 15 to < 18 years of age: 76.76% (95% CI: -26.66, 95.74)
• Male participants: 61.83% (95% CI: -70.48, 91.46)
•
Female participants: 86.71% (95% CI: 51.82, 96.33)
• White participants: 78.58% (95% CI: 43.73, 91.84)
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 35/63 
• Non-White participants: 100.00% (95% CI: -1930.52, 100.00)
• Mixed origin participants: 100.00% (95% CI: -1886.85, 100.00)
• Hispanic or Latino participants: 100.00% (95% CI: -1937.83, 100.00)
• Not Hispanic or Latino participants: 78.24% (95% CI: 42.85, 91.71)
The VEs for participants 15 to < 18 years of age, male, non-White, mixed origin, and Hispanic or Latino 
are based on limited numbers and since the lower bound of the 95% CI crosses 0 due to the low number 
of adolescent participants being part of those subgroups, these do not allow meaningful interpretation.

variability 
Whilst a non-randomised, non-inferiority analysis was planned for, this was 
descriptive in nature and no formal hypothesis testing was planned for. 
Successful demonstration of NI (primary immunogenicity objective) required 
meeting 3 pre-specified criteria simultaneously: 
1. Upper bound of 95% CI for GMR (GMT18-<26yo /GMT12-<18yo) < 1.5
2. Point estimate of GMR ≤ 1.22
3. Upper bound of 95% CI for ΔSCR (SCR18-<26yo - SCR12-<18yo) < 10%
All these criteria were met, although no hypothesis testing took place, 
therefore a formal claim of non-inferiority cannot be made 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
PP-EFF, including participants who received the full prescribed regimen of trial 
vaccine and had no major protocol deviations that occurred before the first 
COVID-19 positive episode and were determined to affect the efficacy 
outcomes, including baseline SARS-CoV-2 seropositivity or nasal swab PCR-
positivity. 
Cases were included occurring from Day 35 (14 days after second vaccination) 
up to receipt of cross over vaccine / DCO

2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The application is based on the paediatric expansion of 2019nCoV-301, a 2:1 randomised placebo 
controlled observer blinded trial which is currently ongoing in the US and Mexico. Interim analyses for the 
adult part of this trial were pivotal in the approval of Nuvaxovid in adults, demonstrating an estimated VE 
of 90% in context of circulation of the Alpha variant of SARS-CoV-2. No regulatory advice from EU 
agencies has been obtained for this trial. 
All analyses in the paediatric expansion were of a descriptive nature with no hypothesis defined nor 
tested.

In order to infer efficacy in adolescents, the most relevant objective of primary interest in this 
assessment is the immunogenicity objective in which the neutralising antibody response is bridged to the 
clinical efficacy demonstrated in adults. The primary clinical efficacy objective which aims to demonstrate 
efficacy against COVID-19 is considered of supportive value, mainly as these analyses were not powered 
for.  
Immunobridging was based on the neutralising antibody levels for SARS-CoV-2 wild-type virus as 
measured 2 weeks after the second dose in a randomly selected subset of baseline seronegative 
participants. There is currently no serological correlate of protection for COVID-19. However, considering 
that neutralising antibodies are crucial for protection, immunobridging based on this marker to a 
population where efficacy has been demonstrated is an accepted strategy for ensuring efficacy in 
adolescents. 
Three criteria were defined which were to be met in order to declare non-inferiority of the neutralising 
antibody response in adolescents versus adults aged 18 to <26 years (based on the ratio of GMTs at D35 
between the two groups as well as based on the seroconversion rate from D0 to D35), however as no 
formal hypothesis testing was planned, a formal claim of non-inferiority cannot be made. 
The case definition and methods for case identification and collection were very much in line with the 
adult part of 2019nCOV-301 and acceptable. The case definition for severe COVID-19 was adapted to the 
paediatric population by inclusion of MIS-C which is appropriate. Further the case definition for moderate 
COVID-19 was also slightly adapted by removing the criteria of having ‘fever and 2 COVID-19 symptoms’ 
to classify as a moderate COVID-19 case. This is appropriate. 
The main shortcoming of the methods is the lack of planned formal hypothesis testing, while multiple 
primary endpoints have been defined in various subsets. Considering the selected endpoints, sufficiently 
large sample size and generally acceptable predefined methods as well as the acceptable conduct of the 
trial (see below), the descriptive results are sufficient to infer efficacy in adolescents – also considering 
efficacy in adults has been robustly established and it is anticipated that the immune response at a 
similar dose will be higher in adolescents compared to adults. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Overall, the conduct of the trial is acceptable, with relatively few protocol deviations resulting in exclusion 
from the PP populations. As in the adult part of the trial, a relevant proportion of participants requested 
unblinding for receipt of an EUA approved vaccine - slightly more often in the placebo group (n=40, 
5.3%) compared to the NVX-CoV2373 group (n=60, 4.0%).  
The median age of participants was 14 years, with 67% aged between 12 and 15 years of age. The 
majority of participants was male (52.5%), with relatively more males included in the placebo group 
(56%) compared to the NVX-CoV2373 group (51%).  
Participant ethnicity was mostly ‘White’ or ‘Not Hispanic or ‘Latino’; 27% of participants were considered 
Obese (BMI ≥30) at baseline. In total, 16.1% (n=359) of participants was seropositive (n=348, 15.6%) 
and/or had a positive (n=21, 0.9%) PCR at baseline.  
The baseline characteristics for the cohort of young adults (18-25 years) from the main adult study which 
formed the comparator group for the non-inferiority analysis showed that the adolescent subset included 
relatively more males (52.3%) compared to the young adult subset (46.6%). Further, adolescents were 
less often of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity (16.7% vs. 32.2% in young adults).

Immunobridging 
Generally, adolescents have higher immune responses to vaccination compared to adults, which has been 
shown for e.g. HPV vaccines. This was shown to be the case also for Nuvaxovid vaccine, which is not 
considered surprising as the adult vaccine dose was also used in adolescents (dose was not reduced for 
adolescents). The seroresponse rate was non-inferior (99% vs 100%, with a difference of 1.1%, 95% CI: 
-0.2%, 2.8%) and the GMTs were in fact higher in the adolescent participants (GMT: 3860, 95%CI: 3423,
4352) compared to adult participants aged 18 to <26 (GMT: 2634, 95% CI: 2389, 2904), which was not 
unexpected. The three predefined NI criteria were met, although no formal testing was undertaken. 
The MAH informed that assays are being developed for further evaluation of immunogenicity against 
variant strains (e.g., Alpha, Beta, and Delta), and that these data may be provided in subsequent reports 
as available. It is recommended that (i) assays for the Omicron variant are also developed, (ii) if possible, 
Omicron assays should bracket the antigenic diversity seen in Omicron lineages, and (iii) development of 
immunogenicity assays based on currently circulating variants of concern should be prioritised, and 
results reported as soon as possible (REC). 
Efficacy 
For efficacy, the most relevant objective, i.e. the objective of primary interest to this assessment, is the 
immunogenicity objective in which the response in adolescents is bridged to the clinical efficacy as 
demonstrated for adults. The clinical efficacy objective which aims to demonstrate efficacy against 
COVID-19 is considered of relevance, but although they are stated as primary objective these analyses 
were only descriptive and not powered for, therefore they are considered of supportive value. 
In the adolescent group, in the efficacy analyses of the evaluable efficacy population based on cases 
reported from at least 14 days after Dose 2 through the data cut-off date, the estimated VE was 79.5% 
based on 6 (0.5%) and 14 (2.4%) cases in the NVX-CoV2373 and placebo group, respectively, with 2-
sided 95% CI: 46.8, 92.1% for individuals without evidence of prior SARS-CoV-2 infection before 
vaccination. The effect size was in agreement with that seen in adults overall, which was also anticipated 
based on immunogenicity data. 
All cases were mild in severity, with no moderate or severe cases of COVID-19 among participants. Whilst 
efficacy in adults was estimated at the time of predominance of the Alpha variant, efficacy in adolescents 
has been estimated at the time of predominance of the Delta variant with all evaluable cases in the study 
due to Delta. 
As there was only one additional COVID-19 case with onset from at least 14 days after second 
vaccination in participants seropositive at baseline, in the placebo group, the estimated VE in adolescent 
participants regardless of baseline serostatus (VE = 80.8% [95% CI: 50.5, 92.5]) is similar to the 
primary efficacy endpoint. 
The efficacy analysis for PCR-confirmed symptomatic mild, moderate, or severe COVID-19 with onset 
from first vaccination in the FAS population included 11 cases (0.7%) in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 18 
(2.4%) cases in the placebo group, with an estimated VE of 69.7% (2-sided 95% CI: 36.0, 85.7). 
Overall, these efficacy data support the protective efficacy of NVX-CoV2373 in adolescents 12 to <18 
years of age. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
It can be concluded that NVX-CoV2373 is efficacious in protecting individuals 12 to <18 years of age 
against symptomatic COVID-19 based on non-inferior immune responses, which is supported by 
descriptive efficacy analyses.

The following measures are considered necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
•
The MAH is recommended to provide data from the assays being developed for further evaluation
of immunogenicity against variant strains (e.g., Alpha, Beta, and Delta). The MAH is also
recommended to (i) develop immunogenicity assays for the Omicron variant, (ii) if possible,
Omicron assays should bracket the antigenic diversity seen in Omicron lineages (as of May 2022,
BA.1 through BA.5), and (iii) development of immunogenicity assays based on currently
circulating variants of concern should be prioritised, and results reported as soon as possible
(REC).
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety of Nuvaxovid in adults (median age was 48 years; range 18 to 95 years) was evaluated in 
pooled data from 5 ongoing clinical trials conducted in Australia, South Africa, the United Kingdom, the 
United States and Mexico. At the time of the analysis, a total of 49,950 participants aged 18 years and 
older received at least one dose of Nuvaxovid (n=30,058) or placebo (n=19,892).  
The most frequent adverse reactions in adults were injection site tenderness (75%), injection site pain 
(62%), fatigue (53%), myalgia (51%), headache (50%), malaise (41%), arthralgia (24%), and nausea 
or vomiting (15%). Adverse reactions were usually mild to moderate in severity with a median duration of 
less than or equal to 2 days for local events and less than or equal to 1 day for systemic events following 
vaccination. Overall, there was a higher incidence of adverse reactions in younger age groups. Further, 
local and systemic adverse reactions were more frequently reported after Dose 2 than after Dose 1. 
Patient exposure 
A total of 2,232 adolescent participants received at least 1 dose of NVX-CoV2373 or placebo, with 2,198 
(98.5%) receiving both doses of study vaccine. 
Median duration of the safety follow-up period after first and second vaccinations were 94 and 71 days, 
respectively, in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 93 and 71 days, respectively, in the placebo group. Of the 
1,468 and 730 participants in the NVX-CoV2373 and placebo groups, respectively, who received both 
vaccinations, 1,277 (87.0%) and 618 (84.7%), respectively, had at least 60 days of follow-up after their 
second vaccination. 
Adverse events 
Solicited reactions 
Local reactions dose 1: Following first vaccination in all participants, there was a higher frequency of 
solicited local TEAEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group (65.4%) than in the placebo group (28.5%). Frequencies 
of Grade 3 events were low but occurred at a higher frequency in the NVX-CoV2373 group (1.5%) than in 
the placebo group (0.7%). Tenderness and pain were the most frequent solicited local TEAEs in the NVX-
CoV2373 (56.4% and 44.6%, respectively) and placebo (21.1% and 17.4%, respectively) groups. Median 
duration of tenderness and pain were 2.0 and 2.0 days, respectively, in the NVXCoV2373 group and 1.0 
and 1.0 day, respectively, in the placebo group. 
Local reactions dose 2: Following second vaccination in all participants, the frequency of solicited local 
TEAEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group (75.3%) was increased relative to the first vaccination (65.4%) and 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 41/63 
remained higher than in the placebo group (20.6%) (Table 17). The intensity of solicited local TEAEs was 
increased in the NVX-CoV2373 group, as a higher frequency of participants reported Grade 3 events than 
after Dose 1 (8.5% vs 1.5%, respectively). Injection site tenderness and pain remained the most 
frequent solicited local TEAEs in the 2 study vaccine groups, 65.2% and 61.0%, respectively, in the NVX-
CoV2373 group, and 14.1% and 14.9%, respectively, in the placebo group. Median durations of 
tenderness and pain were 2.0 and 2.0 days in the NVX-CoV2373 group and 1.0 and 1.0 day in the 
placebo group.

Systemic reactions dose 1: Following first vaccination in all participants, there was a higher frequency of 
solicited systemic TEAEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group (55.2%) than in the placebo group (40.8%). Most 
participants in either treatment group reported events that were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 severity. 
Frequencies of Grade 3 events were low and occurred at a similar frequency in the NVX-CoV2373 group 
(3.6%) and in the placebo group (3.4%). Two (0.1%) participants in the NVX-CoV2373 group and none 
in the placebo group reported Grade 4 fever events. Upon further examination, the Grade 4 fever TEAEs 
were found to be reported by mistake in the participant-reported eDiary. Muscle pain, headache, fatigue, 
and malaise were the most frequent solicited systemic TEAEs in the NVX-CoV2373 (34.0%, 30.3%, 
24.2%, and 14.8%, respectively) and placebo (15.7%, 24.9%, 15.4%, and 9.2%, respectively) groups; 
median durations of these events were 1.0 day.  
Systemic reactions dose 2: Following second vaccination in all participants, the frequency of solicited 
systemic TEAEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group (74.5%) increased relative to the first vaccination (55.2%) 
and remained higher than in the placebo group (28.9%). The intensity of solicited local TEAEs was also 
increased in the NVX-CoV2373 group, as higher frequencies of participants reported Grade 3 events than 
after Dose 1 (21.9% vs 3.6%, respectively). There were 2 reports (0.1%) of Grade 4 events in the NVX-
CoV2373 group, and none in the placebo group. The 2 Grade 4 TEAEs were one headache and one 
nausea/vomiting. The Grade 4 TEAE of headache qualified as such based on the participant visit to the 
emergency room (ER) and had a duration of 1 day. The Grade 4 TEAE of nausea/vomiting was found to 
be part of an AE of gastroenteritis that the participant experienced and that prompted an ER visit, 
however, the symptom was nonetheless reported with a duration of 1 day. Headache, fatigue, muscle 
pain, and malaise remained the most frequent solicited systemic TEAEs in the 2 treatment groups, with 
median durations remaining at 1.0 day, except for muscle pain in the NVX-CoV2373 group where it was 
2.0 days.

Unsolicited TEAEs 
Unsolicited TEAEs with onset from after Dose 1 through the data cut off or administration of crossover 
vaccination occurred at similar frequencies in the NVX-CoV2373 group and in the placebo group (n=243, 
16.3% and n=118, 15.8%, respectively). Severe TEAEs were reported in 6 (0.4%) participants in the 
NVX-CoV2373 group and 2 (0.3%) participants in the placebo group. Most TEAEs occurred within 49 days 
after first vaccination (n=241, 16.2% and n=117, 15.7%, in the NVX-CoV2373 group and in the placebo 
group respectively).  
TEAEs of the SOCs Infections and Infestations, Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders, General 
Disorders and Administration Site Conditions, Injury, Poisoning and Procedural Complications, and 
Nervous System Disorders were the most frequent (incidence > 2.0% in the NVX-CoV2373 group) in 
adolescent participants 12 to < 18 years of age. The most frequent TEAEs (incidence > 1.0%) were nasal 
congestion, headache, cough, and oropharyngeal pain in the NVX-CoV2373 group and upper respiratory 
tract infection, oropharyngeal pain, nasal congestion, headache, and rhinorrhoea in the placebo group. 
Unsolicited Treatment-Related TEAEs 
Among adolescent participants 12 to < 18 years of age, unsolicited treatment-related TEAEs from first 
vaccination to Day 49 occurred with a higher frequency of participants reporting them in the NVX-
CoV2373 group (3.4%) than in the placebo group (1.1%). This difference was largely due to treatment-
related TEAEs in the SOC General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (1.6% vs 0.1%, 
respectively), where the most frequent TEAEs of chills, fatigue, injection site pain, and pyrexia only 
occurred in the NVX-CoV2373 group, and the SOC Nervous System Disorders, where the TEAE of 
headache was the most frequently reported. Most of these terms were related to solicited vaccine 
reactogenicity that were counted as treatment-related TEAEs as well. The most frequent treatment-
related TEAE overall was lymphadenopathy, which only occurred in the NVX-CoV2373 group. 
AESIs 
There were no Potential Immune-Mediated Medical Conditions (PIMMCs) reported in the paediatric 
expansion. There was on Adverse Event of Special Interest. There were 5 (0.3%) participants in the NVX-
CoV2373 group and 5 (0.7%) participants in the placebo group who reported COVID-19-related TEAEs in 
the paediatric expansion; al were mild. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
There were no deaths among the adolescent participants in the paediatric expansion at the time of this 
data extraction. 
SAEs were reported by <1% of participants in each treatment group. There was a numerically higher 
frequency of participants reporting unsolicited SAEs in the NVX-CoV2373 group (n = 7, 0.5%) than in the 
placebo group (n = 2, 0.3%). Unsolicited SAEs in the SOCs Injury, Poisoning and Procedural 
Complications, Infections and Infestations, and Psychiatric Disorders were the most frequent (incidence > 
2 participants across both treatment groups). Only 1 SAE (
) was reported in 2

participants (both in the NVX-CoV2373 group). All SAEs were assessed by the investigator as not related 
to study treatment.

Laboratory findings 
No scheduled laboratory assessments for safety were implemented in the study. 
Safety in special populations 
The MAH conducted several subgroup analyses to evaluate the impact on vaccine safety. 
• Frequencies and intensities of solicited systemic TEAEs among NVX-CoV2373 recipients after each
vaccination were similar among each age subgroup (12 to < 15 years and 15 to < 18 years). 
• Male participants reported lower frequencies and intensities of solicited systemic TEAEs among both
NVX-CoV2373 and placebo recipients after each vaccination than in female participants. 
• Black or African American and American Indian or Alaska Native participants reported lower frequencies
and intensities of solicited systemic TEAEs among NVX-CoV2373 recipients after each vaccination than in 
participants of other races. 
• There were generally similar frequencies and intensities of solicited systemic TEAEs after each
vaccination among White, Asian, and mixed origin race participants in the NVX-CoV2373 group. Native 
Hawaiian/Other Pacific Islander was the only group with increased frequency of solicited systemic TEAEs 
among all races, but the number of participants in this category is too low to allow for meaningful 
interpretation. 
• Hispanic or Latino participants reported lower frequencies of solicited systemic TEAEs among both NVX-
CoV2373 and placebo recipients after each vaccination than in not Hispanic or Latino participants. 
Severity (based on percentage of participants with Grade 3+ systemic TEAEs), however, is similar among 
the 2 ethnic groups.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Drug-drug interactions were not evaluated in this study. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were no TEAEs reported that led to study discontinuation in any adolescent participant. 
Unsolicited TEAEs resulting in study vaccine discontinuation were reported in 1 participant each in the 
NVX-CoV2373 and placebo groups. A TEAE of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy was reported by a participant in 
the NVX-CoV2373 group (see section on SAEs) and a TEAE of rhinorrhoea was reported in the placebo 
group; both events occurred in participants 12 to < 15 years of age and both were assessed by the 
investigator as not related to study treatment.  
One additional participant in the NVX-CoV2373 group reported a TEAE of headache that resulted in 
discontinuation of study vaccine, this event was a solicited TEAE that continued beyond the 7-day 
reactogenicity period. 
Post-marketing experience 
Nuvaxovid received a conditional marketing authorisation in the European Union (EU) on 20 December 
2021. According to the latest MSSR (17 March 2022), there are no safety updates for Nuvaxovid. By 28 
February 2022, the vaccine was not yet in use in the EU/EEA. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
This application concerns adolescents 12 to <18 years of age which have subsequently been recruited to 
the paediatric expansion of ongoing phase 3 trial 2019nCoV-301 which was pivotal for the approval in 
adults. The same dose of NVX-CoV2373 as in adults (5-μg dose of SARS-CoV-2 rS with 50 μg Matrix-M 
adjuvant) has been administered to the adolescents, given as a 2-dose regimen with a 21 day interval. 
Up to the cut-off date (6 October 2021), a total of 2,232 adolescents (NVX-CoV2373 n=1,487; placebo 
n=745) aged 12 to <18 years have been included in the safety population; of these 2,198 (98.5%) 
received the second dose. The majority of adolescents (67%) were aged 12 to <15 years. Slightly more 
male participants were included (52.5%). The adolescents were recruited from the USA only. The 
included numbers of participants are considered sufficient to evaluate the reactogenicity profile in 
adolescents that receive two doses of NVX-CoV2373. It will however not be possible within this study to 
detect rare adverse reactions. The safety follow up is considered sufficient, with the median duration of 
follow up after the second dose of NVX-CoV2373 of 71 days and 1,277 adolescents (87.0%) having at 
least 60 days of follow up. 
Reactogenicity: Tenderness and pain at the injection site was the most frequently reported local 
reaction in adolescents (56%/47% dose1; 65%/61% dose2), which was significantly higher compared to 
placebo (21%/17% dose1; 14%/15% dose2).  
The most commonly reported solicited systemic TEAEs among the adolescent subjects that received NVX-
CoV2373 after the first dose were muscle pain, headache, fatigue, and malaise in the NVX-CoV2373 
(34.0%, 30.3%, 24.2%, and 14.8%, respectively) and placebo (15.7%, 24.9%, 15.4%, and 9.2%, 
respectively) groups; median durations of these events were 1.0 day. Headache, fatigue, muscle pain, 
and malaise remained the most frequent solicited systemic TEAEs after the second dose, reported by 
57.0%, 49.9%, 49.1% and 40.2% in the NVX-CoV2373 group and by 17.3%, 14.6%, 12.0% and 7.4% in 
the placebo group respectively.  
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022

Most of the local and systemic events were mild to moderate in intensity and resolved within 2 days. 
There were few reports of Grade 4 fever; according to the MAH, reported TEAEs of Grade 4 fever after the 
first dose were made by mistake. The MAH provided very little detail on the data entries for Grade 4 
events which were judged to be reporting mistakes. The MAH confirmed that less severe events (Grade1-
3) were not checked with the same thoroughness, therefore the possibility of the presence of data entry
errors cannot be excluded. Based on the assumption that errors were made just as often in the placebo 
as active comparison group, this will unlikely affect overall conclusions. 
Generally, the reactogenicity profile in adolescents 12 - < 18 years is similar as that in adults as observed 
in the same trial, 2019nCoV-301: after the first dose 66% of adolescents reported a local reaction 
compared to 58% of adults, after the second dose this was 76% compared to 79% respectively. Systemic 
reactions were also similar; after the first dose these were reported by 55% of adolescents compared to 
48% of adults, after the second dose by 75% of adolescents and 70% of adults. The only exception is 
fever, which was reported more frequently by adolescents: 1% after the first dose, 17% after the second 
dose (2% grade 3), compared with 0.4% of adults after dose 1 and 6% of adults after dose 2 (0.4% 
grade 3). The frequency of fever increases with decreasing age, as for adolescents 12-15 years 18% 
reported fever after the second dose compared with 14% of adolescents aged 16-18 years. In 
adolescents the median duration of fever after the first and second dose was 1 day, with a maximum 
duration of 2 days observed after the second dose. The higher fever rates in adolescents are noted in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Unsolicited AEs with onset from after Dose 1 through to the cut-off date occurred at similar frequencies 
in the NVX-CoV2373 group and in the placebo group (n=243, 16.3% and n=118, 15.8%, respectively). 
This was similar as observed in the adult part of 2019nCoV-301 (16.3% vs 14.8%). The most frequent 
TEAEs (incidence > 1.0%) were nasal congestion, headache, cough, and oropharyngeal pain in the NVX-
CoV2373 group and upper respiratory tract infection, oropharyngeal pain, nasal congestion, headache, 
and rhinorrhoea in the placebo group. 
There was a slight imbalance in AEs in the SOC of Eye disorders, (7 (0.5%) vs 1 (0.1%); IR 3.3/100 PY 
vs 1.0/100 PY), as was observed in adults. Also, as in adults, it was not due to an imbalance related to 
one specific PT and there is no clear indication of relatedness to the vaccine. As this is already being 
followed in PSURs/MSSRs no additional action is warranted at this moment 
Unsolicited treatment-related AEs from first vaccination to Day 49 occurred with a higher frequency 
of participants reporting them in the NVX-CoV2373 group (3.4%) than in the placebo group (1.1%). This 
difference was largely due to the SOC General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (1.6% vs 
0.1%; chills, fatigue, injection site pain, and pyrexia) and the SOC Nervous System Disorders 
(headache). The most frequent treatment-related TEAE overall was lymphadenopathy, which only 
occurred in the NVX-CoV2373 group and is already listed in the SmPC.  
Clinical laboratory testing was not performed as part of the safety evaluation in adolescents. Considering 
that there is no need for any clinical laboratory testing to characterise the safety per se, as there is 
sufficient evidence in adults, the absence of such data is acceptable. 
There were no deaths the adolescent participants in the paediatric expansion, nor any serious AEs 
considered related to NVX-CoV2373. Whilst in the study in adults few cases of pericarditis/myocarditis 
had been observed following vaccination with NVX-CoV2373, none were observed in the paediatric 
expansion. However, the study is not large enough to detect rare adverse reactions. 
With regards to the SAE of juvenile myoclonic epilepsy resulting in discontinuation of vaccination, it is not 
entirely clear how far the subject was in neurological diagnostic work-up or when exactly carbamazepine 
was started and whilst the investigator ruled out possible relatedness due to the reporting of symptoms 
suggesting seizure activity preceding the date of vaccination, details are too limited to firmly rule out any 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report

Page 48/63 
role of NVX-CoV2373. However, based on the available information around this single event no 
conclusions can be drawn and no further action is warranted. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety evaluation is based on a paediatric expansion in an ongoing phase 3 study that has included 
2,232 adolescents aged 12 to <18 years. The same dose and dose regimen as for the adult population 
has been used. Overall, the reported reactogenicity profile is in line with what was observed in the adult 
population, even though a higher frequency of fever was noted in adolescents which is reflected in the 
SmPC. The reactogenicity profile is considered acceptable. The frequency of reported AEs and SAEs were 
low. The sample size does not allow detection of rare adverse reactions. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted/was requested to submit an updated RMP version 1.1  with this application. 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.1  is acceptable.   
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
Safety concerns 
The safety profile of NVX-CoV2373 in adolescents aged 12 to 18 years did not reveal any new safety 
concerns; there were no cases of myocarditis. The safety profile was in line with the current experience in 
adults. Therefore, it is agreed that the safety specifications remain unchanged. 
Myocarditis and pericarditis and are listed as an important potential risk in the EU-RMP of Nuvaxovid 
following evaluation of the clinical trial data supporting the initial CMA (refer to EPAR). No cases of 
myocarditis and pericarditis have been reported in the clinical trials supporting this extension of the 
indication in adolescents.Importantly, reports of myocarditis and pericarditis following Nuvaxovid have 
been reported in the post-marketing setting and are being closely evaluated by PRAC in the context of the 
Summary Safety Reports. 
The risk of anaphylaxis has been removed from the list of safety concerns, as requested by PRAC. This 
risk is well known in clinical practice and within the vaccination campaigns in the Member States. Based 
on the current post marketing experience, the conclusion at approval that routine risk minimisation is 
sufficient to mitigate this risk is maintained. It is also no longer considered in need of further 
characterisation within the ongoing PASS programs. Taken together, while anaphylaxis remains a 
potential risk for the product, as with any other biologicals, it does not have an impact on the benefit / 
risk balance of the vaccine. Therefore, it is agreed that anaphylaxis is reclassified as not “important” and 
removed from the summary of safety concerns in the RMP. This event is expected to be monitored via 
routine pharmacovigilance.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated to extend 
the indication to individuals 12 years of age and older. The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 57/63 
There is no change proposed in the technical specifications of the package information leaflet. The final 
report of the PL user testing, which was performed in January 2022, was submitted and evaluated by the 
EMA within the variation EMEA/H/C/005808/IB/0005, which was approved on 18 March 2022. The 
changes performed in the PL within the frame of this indication extension variation are minimal. The 
information is not moved within the document and no new, significantly complex, text constructions are 
included.  
The proposed changes in the PL with respect to currently submitted variation, do not impact the technical 
readability, comprehensibility of the text, traceability of information, particularly key safety messages, 
which were investigated in the recently performed and approved user testing. The results of the user 
testing of the PL approved in December 2021, which were satisfactory and met the success criteria 
established in the European guideline, are still valid and applicable to the proposed update of the PL. 
Therefore, performing a new user testing of the proposed package information leaflet, which is submitted 
within the variation, the adolescent indication extension, is not required. 
3. Benefit-Risk Balance
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
COVID-19 is the disease caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory coronavirus 2 (SARS-
CoV-2). COVID-19 is primarily recognised as febrile respiratory illness. While the majority of cases 
subsides without specific treatment in a subgroup of patients the disease progresses to severe disease 
characterised by oxygen requirement. Still fewer patients progress to critical disease with respiratory 
failure, ARDS, multiorgan failure and/or thromboembolic complications. Age is the major risk factor for 
severe COVID-19 and death, other described risk factors are obesity, pre-existent diabetes, 
cardiovascular disease, lung disease, immuno-deficiency and pregnancy. COVID-19 can be considered 
confirmed by the existence of above clinical signs and proof of the presence of the virus e.g. by NAAT. 
In adolescents SARS-CoV-2 infections cause mostly asymptomatic or mild disease. Severe COVID-19 
cases occur rarely, and predominantly in subjects with comorbidities. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
To date, several vaccines have been authorised in multiple countries globally for the prevention of 
COVID-19. Within the EU, five SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are currently authorised; of these, two are 
authorised for use in adolescents.  
Despite available preventative measures and treatments, there remains an unmet medical need. 
Especially protection of particularly vulnerable groups and mitigating the effects of the pandemic on a 
population level are desired. While two vaccines for the prevention of COVID-19 are authorised for use in 
adolescents, there is a likely need for additional vaccines to meet sustained demand and to successfully 
protect the global community from SARS-CoV-2. 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 58/63 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This submission is based on one clinical trial conducted in adolescents, a paediatric expansion of study 
2019nCoV-301, a randomised (2:1) placebo controlled observer blinded trial of which the adult part was 
pivotal to the approval of Nuvaxovid in adults.  
Vaccine efficacy is inferred based on demonstrating non-inferiority of the geometric mean value of serum 
neutralising antibodies and the seroresponse rate from adolescent participants (12 to <18 years) 
compared with those obtained from young adults (18 to <26 years of age) enrolled in the adult part of 
2019nCoV-301. Additionally, co-primary endpoints evaluated the effects of Nuvaxovid on COVID-19 as 
well as the safety of Nuvaxovid in adolescents. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Based on in vitro and in vivo studies it has been demonstrated that neutralising antibodies play a crucial 
role in preventing COVID-19. Nuvaxovid was shown to elicit non-inferior neutralising antibody levels and 
seroresponse rates in subjects 12 to <18 years of age without previous SARS-CoV-2 infection compared 
to young adults 18 to <26 years of age. Based on these immunobridging results efficacy can be inferred 
for adolescents.  
In addition, descriptive analyses of efficacy confirmed protection of Nuvaxovid against COVID-19, with an 
estimated vaccine efficacy (VE) of 79.5% (95% CI: 46.8%, 92.1%) based on 20 accrued cases (6 in the 
NVX-CoV2373 group and 14 in the placebo group) found in context of dominant circulation of the Delta 
variant of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in the US. All of the 11 cases that could be sequenced were Delta 
variants. Overall, the VE results are consistent with the VE reported in older age groups. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No data are available from adolescents with a risk of more severe disease, including those with 
comorbidities such as diabetes or those under immune suppressive therapy. A study in 
immunocompromised children is included in the PIP.  
It is currently unknown how long protection will last in adolescents and adults and whether vaccination 
provides protection against currently dominant variants (i.e. Omicron BA1/BA2) or newly emerging 
variants.  
The impact on transmission is currently unknown. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety of Nuvaxovid administered to adolescent subjects was evaluated in 2,232 participants aged 12 
to <18 years of the ongoing phase 3 trial 2019nCoV-301. 
As in adults, the safety profile of Nuvaxovid in adolescents is characterised by its reactogenicity. The 
most frequent reactions were injection site tenderness (56% D1/65% D2) and injection site pain (45% 
D1/61% D2), headache (30% D1/ 57% D2), fatigue (24% D1/50% D2), muscle pain (34% D1/49% D2) 
and malaise (15% D1/ 40% D2). Reactogenicity increased with the second dose both in reporting 
frequency as in severity. The median duration of local and systemic events was 1 to 2 days and reactions 
were mostly mild to moderate at intensity. The reactogenicity profile is similar to what has been reported 
in adults, with the exception of fever which occurred at a higher frequency (1% D1/17% D2 vs 0.4% 
D1/6% D2 in adults)) and was more often severe in adolescent participants, in particular following the 
second dose (2% grade 3 vs 0.4% grade 3 in adults). 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 59/63 
The frequency of AEs and SAEs was in general low and no new safety concerns have been detected 
compared to what was reported for the adult population. Several events of lymphadenopathy (NVX-
CoV2373 0.7% (10 cases); placebo 0% (0 cases)) have been reported. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There is a limited number of adolescent subjects aged 12 to <18 years included in the study, which does 
not allow detection of rare adverse events. 
The trial was restricted to healthy and medically stable adolescents. No safety data are available for 
adolescents with underlying chronic medical conditions and/or immune suppression.  
Concomitant use of Nuvaxovid and any other vaccine or any other medication was not evaluated.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The most important favourable effect of vaccination is the prevention of symptomatic disease that has 
been demonstrated for Nuvaxovid in the pivotal trials that were submitted for marketing authorisation. A 
similar degree of benefit of Nuvaxovid in adolescents 12 to <18 years of age can be inferred by the 
successful immunobridging approach to young adults, 18 to <26 years of age.  
The predefined non-inferiority margins with respect to neutralising antibody levels and seroresponse rates 
were met, and GMTs of neutralising antibodies in adolescents were higher than observed in young adults 
following 2 doses of Nuvaxovid given 21 days apart. Therefore at least similar efficacy is expected in 
CHMP extension of indication variation assessment report 
EMA/637822/2022 
Page 61/63 
 
adolescents as observed in young adults. Clinical data also show short-term protection against 
symptomatic COVID-19 in adolescents 12 to <18 years of age supporting the immunobridging approach. 
The most common and important unfavourable effects are related to reactogenicity. The reactogenicity 
profile was found to be comparable to that observed in the adult population that was evaluated in a 
previous application, with the exception of fever which occurs at higher frequencies and is more often of a 
higher grade with decreasing age. Importantly, the overall safety profile is similar as is observed in adults 
and no new safety concerns were observed, however, the study size did not allow detection of rare 
adverse events. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The course of COVID-19 in adolescents is generally milder than in the older population. Nonetheless, also 
amongst this age group, there are individuals that suffer from direct consequences of the infection. 
Further, considering the acceptable safety profile, which is largely characterised by mild to moderate 
reactions, taking into account the limited experience with this vaccine so far, it is considered that the 
favourable effects of preventing COVID-19 with potential irreversible and long-lasting consequences 
outweigh the identified risks of vaccination with Nuvaxovid. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit-risk of Nuvaxovid in adolescents aged 12 to <18 years is positive.

Extension of indication to include use in adolescents 12 to 17 years of age for Nuvaxovid, based on data 
from study 2019nCoV-301, a Phase 3, Randomized, Observer-Blinded, Placebo-Controlled Study to 
evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of a SARS-CoV-2 Recombinant Spike Protein 
Nanoparticle Vaccine (SARS-CoV-2 rS) with Matrix-M Adjuvant in Adult Participants ≥ 18 Years with a 
Pediatric Expansion in Adolescents (12 to < 18 Years); as a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 
of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. Version 1.1 of the RMP has also 
been submitted. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and to 
the Risk Management Plan (RMP).

Amendments to the marketing authorisation 
In view of the data submitted with the variation, amendments to Annexes I and IIIB, and to the Risk 
Management Plan are recommended. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0126/2021and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

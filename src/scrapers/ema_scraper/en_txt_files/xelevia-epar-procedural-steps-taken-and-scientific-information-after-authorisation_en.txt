to 10%). Patients were randomised to sitagliptin 100 mg 
once daily or placebo for 20 weeks. Mean baseline HbA1c 
was 7.5%. Treatment with sitagliptin 100 mg did not 
provide significant improvement in HbA1c at 20 weeks. The 
reduction in HbA1c in patients treated with sitagliptin 
(N=95) was 0.0% compared to 0.2% in patients treated 
with placebo (N=95), a difference of -0.2% (95% CI: -0.7, 
0.3).   
The pharmacokinetics of sitagliptin (single dose of 50 mg, 
100 mg or 200 mg) were investigated. In this population, 
the dose-adjusted AUC of sitagliptin in plasma was 
approximately 18 % lower compared to adult patients with 
type 2 diabetes for a 100 mg dose. This is not considered 
to be a clinically meaningful difference compared to adult 
patients based on the flat PK/PD relationship between the 
dose of 50 mg and 100 mg. No studies with sitagliptin have 
been performed in paediatric patients with age <10 years. 
In clinical trials with sitagliptin in paediatric patients with 
type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 to17 years, the profile of 
adverse reactions was comparable to that observed in 
adults.  
Sitagliptin should not be used in children and adolescents 
10 to 17 years of age because of insufficient efficacy. 
Sitagliptin has not been studied in paediatric patients under 
10 years of age.

For patients with severe renal impairment (GFR ≥ 15 to

< 15 mL/min), including those requiring haemodialysis or 
peritoneal dialysis, the dose of Januvia is 25 mg once daily. 
Treatment may be administered without regard to the 
timing of dialysis. 
A single dose, open label study was conducted to evaluate 
the pharmacokinetics of a reduced dose of sitagliptin (50 
mg) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal 
impairment compared to normal healthy control subjects. 
The study included patients with mild, moderate, and 
severe renal impairment, as well as patients with ESRD on 
haemodialysis. In addition, the effects of renal impairment 
on sitagliptin pharmacokinetics in patients with type 2 
diabetes and mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment 
(including ESRD) were assessed using population 
pharmacokinetic analyses.  
Compared to normal healthy control subjects, plasma AUC 
of sitagliptin was increased by approximately 1.2-fold and 
1.6-fold in patients with mild renal impairment (GFR ≥ 60 
to < 90 mL/min) and patients with moderate renal 
impairment (GFR ≥ 45 to < 60 mL/min), respectively.

and CV risk factors. The study population included 2,004 
patients ≥ 75 years of age and 3,324 patients with renal 
impairment (eGFR= 30-60 mL/min/1.73 m2). 
Over the course of the study, the overall estimated mean 
(SD) difference in HbA1c between the sitagliptin and 
placebo groups was 0.29 % (0.01), 95 % CI (-0.32, -0.27); 
p < 0.001. After a median follow up of 3 years, sitagliptin, 
when added to usual care, did not increase the risk of 
major adverse cardiovascular events or the risk of 
hospitalization for heart failure compared to usual care 
without sitagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes. The 
overall incidence of serious adverse events in patients 
receiving sitagliptin was similar to that in patients receiving 
placebo.

Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC with the results of 
study MK-0431 PN260 which examined the insulin-
sparing effect of sitagliptin 100 mg once-daily 
compared with placebo over 24 weeks in participants 
with type 2 diabetes mellitus who have inadequate 
glycaemic control on insulin alone or in combination 
with metformin. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the list of local representatives

safety of sitagliptin (100 mg once daily) added to insulin 
glargine with or without metformin (at least 1,500 mg) 
during intensification of insulin therapy. Baseline HbA1c 
was 8.74 % and baseline insulin dose was 37 IU/day. 
Patients were instructed to titrate their insulin glargine 
dose based on fingerstick fasting glucose values. At Week 
24, the increase in daily insulin dose was 19 IU/day in 
patients treated with sitagliptin and 24 IU/day in patients 
treated with placebo. The reduction in HbA1c in patients 
treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without 
metformin) was  1.31 % compared to  0.87 % in patients 
treated with placebo and insulin (with or without 
metformin), a difference of  0.45 % [95 % CI:  -0.60,  -
0.29]. The incidence of hypoglycaemia was 25.2 % in 
patients treated with sitagliptin and insulin (with or without 
metformin) and 36.8 % in patients treated with placebo 
and insulin (with or without metformin).The difference was 
mainly due to a higher percentage of patients in the 
placebo group experiencing 3 or more episodes of 
hypoglycaemia (9.4 vs 19.2%). There was no difference in 
the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia.

Study P128 was a Phase III, multicentre, randomised 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC in order 
to include results from study P128 (sitagliptin in 
combination with pioglitazone and metformin) and to 
remove the information relating to the combination 
of sitaglitptin and rosiglitazone. The Package Leaflet 
is updated accordingly. 
The requested worksharing procedure proposed 
amendments to the Summary of Product 
Characteristics and Package Leaflet. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
double-blind placebo controlled study that evaluated the 
safety and efficacy of sitagliptin in patients with T2DM and 
inadequate glycaemic control on combination therapy with 
metformin and pioglitazone. 
The study showed that for patients with inadequate 
glycaemic control on dual combination therapy with 
metformin and pioglitazone, the addition of sitagliptin 100 
mg provided a statistically significant lowering in HbA1c, 
compared to placebo at Week 26: difference in mean 
change -0.75 (95% CI -0.95, -0.54) (FAS/LOCF). Analyses 
of change from baseline in HbA1c for Completers only were 
in line with the analysis of the FAS/LOCF (-0.60 [-0.80; -
0.39]). 
With respect to fasting plasma glucose, the addition of 
sitagliptin was statistically significantly greater to the 
addition of placebo in lowering FPG at Week 26 (sitagliptin -
21.6 mg/dL vs. placebo -1.5. mg/dL; difference -20.3 [CI-
27.0, -13.6]). The profile over time for this group showed a 
Page 21/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
reduction in FPG levels within the first 6 weeks of treatment 
with sitagliptin; and generally stable FPG was observed 
over the remaining double blind treatment period with only 
a minor trend towards baseline between Weeks 12-26.  
Body weight was increased in both treatment groups: 1.3 
kg in the sitagliptin group vs. 1.1 kg in the placebo group. 
The difference was not statistically significant. 
In this 26-week, there was a numerically higher incidence 
of adverse events in patients treated with sitagliptin in 
combination with pioglitazone and metformin; however, the 
95% CI for the between-group difference included 0. The 
incidences of drug-related adverse events and serious 
adverse events were numerically lower in the sitagliptin 
group relative to the placebo. In addition, the proportion of 
patients who discontinued from study drug due to adverse 
events was numerically lower in the sitagliptin group 
relative to the placebo group. Some specific adverse events 
occurred at a slightly higher incidence in the sitagliptin 
group relative to the placebo group. The adverse events 
were generally mild to moderate in intensity and did not 
lead to discontinuation of study drug.  
There was a low incidence of hypoglycaemia with no 
statistically significant or clinically meaningful differences 
between groups; this is reflected in section 5.1 of the 
SmPC. The few events reported in the sitagliptin group 
were mild, none required assistance for treatment, and 
none caused interruption or discontinuation of study drug. 
Numerically lower incidences of peripheral oedema were 
reported in the sitagliptin group than in the placebo group. 
The table of ADRs in section 4.8 of the SmPC has been 
updated to reflect the results of study P128. The adverse 
drug reactions associated with the combination of

these adverse events of pain in extremity were non-serious 
in nature. Based on the accumulated reports of pain in 
extremity, including 33 serious reports, and 11 positive 
rechallenges, an association between pain in extremity and 
use of sitagliptin and sitagliptin/metformin FDC cannot be 
excluded.

Renewal of the marketing authorisation. 
17/11/2011 
20/01/2012 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit risk balance, 
the CHMP was of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk profile of Xelevia continues 
to be favourable.  
The CHMP recommended the renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Xelevia, subject to the conditions as laid 
down in Annex II to the Opinion. The CHMP was also of the 
opinion that the renewal can be granted with unlimited 
validity. 
The renewal required amendments to the terms of the 
Community Marketing Authorisation based on the CHMP’s 
request to implement the latest QRD template and to 
update section 4.8 with new safety information.  The main 
changes in the SmPC section 4.8 are inclusion of interstitial 
lung disease as adverse reactions and hypoglycaemia, 
constipation, flatulence and vomiting when sitagliptin is 
used in combination with Metformin. A number of minor 
changes have been introduces throughout SmPC. PL has

Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with 
the current Agency/QRD template, SmPC guideline and

Therefore, the CHMP recommended the following annexes

worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
Update of sections 4.2, 4.4, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC 
in order to remove the restrictions on the use of 
sitagliptin in patients with moderate to severe renal 
insufficiency or end stage renal disease (ESRD) on 
dialysis. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. 
C.I.4 - Variations related to significant modifications 
of the SPC due in particular to new quality, pre-
clinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
for the treatment of patients with T2DM and normal or 
mildly impaired renal function (creatinine clearance ≥50 
ml/min).  At that time the CHMP considered the clinical 
experience with sitagliptin in patients with T2DM and 
moderate or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance 
<50 ml/min) to be too limited and the use of sitagliptin in 
these patients was therefore not recommended.  There 
were in particular, concerns about the cardiovascular safety 
in these patients, as in study P028 (a study in renally 
impaired patients) more patients died in the sitagliptin 
group compared to the placebo/glipizide group (5 vs. 1). 
The difference was higher than expected on the basis of the 
randomisation ratio. In the sitagliptin group, 4 of the 5 
patients died due to cardiac adverse experiences, while 
there was no cardiac death in the glipizide group. As a 
result of this the MAH agreed to a post approval 
commitment to further assess the efficacy and safety of 
sitagliptin in these patients in a study of at least 24 weeks 
duration.   
In support of the application two studies were submitted, 
one (P063) in patients with moderate to severe renal 
impairment (eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2), and one study 
in patients with ESRD on dialysis (study P073). Treatment 
Page 26/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
naive patients, patients on a single oral AHA or on low dose 
dual combination treatment could participate in the study. 
Patients were randomised to receive sitagliptin or glipizide. 
Study duration was 54 weeks. 
The doses of sitagliptin used in the two new studies 
supporting this Type 2 variation were 50 mg q.d. for 
patients with moderate renal insufficiency and 25 mg q.d. 
for patients with severe renal insufficiency or ESRD on 
dialysis. 
In both studies a clinically relevant reduction in HbA1c was 
seen after 54 weeks of treatment, both in the sitagliptin 
group (-0.76 and -0.72 in study P063 and P073 
respectively) and the glipizide group (-0.62 and -0.87, 
respectively). The criteria for non-inferiority were met in 
study P063. Secondary endpoints were in line with these 
results. 
In general sitagliptin was well tolerated, and the incidences 
of adverse events were not meaningfully different between 
treatment groups.  
There was a difference in the Metabolism and Nutrition 
disorders SOC and Investigations SOC, but the difference 
was in favour of sitagliptin. Differences were primarily due 
to a higher incidence of hypoglycaemia or blood glucose 
decreased in the glipizide group. 
Incidences of cardiovascular serious adverse events were 
generally similar in both treatment groups in both 
populations (moderate to severe renal impairment, and 
ESRD). In addition, a second analysis, including serious and 
non-serious events, did not reveal differences between 
treatment groups.  
Renal function was not affected by sitagliptin, and 
laboratory measurements and vital signs did not show 
Page 27/38 
 
 
 
 
 
meaningful changes or differences. 
There was a higher incidence of adverse experiences in the 
Neoplasms Benign, Malignant, and Unspecified (incl. cysts 
and polyps) SOC, with 8 cases in the sitagliptin group and 
none in the glipizide group. All cases occurred in the first 
six months of therapy and represent different type of 
tumours, making a causal relationship unlikely. 
The overall incidence of hypoglycaemia was lower in the 
sitagliptin group compared to the glipizide group. Although 
a finger stick was not required, a value was reported for 
most (92-94%) of the patients with adverse events of 
symptomatic hypoglycaemia. This does not necessarily 
mean that there was a value for every event. However, in 
nearly all cases the blood glucose value was below 3.9 
mmol/L (70 mg/dL). 
The conclusion of the assessment is that the benefit/risk for 
treatment of patients with renal impairment is positive.

The MAH has provided a cumulative review of cases 
Package Leaflet to include the side effects 
pancreatitis and cutaneous vasculitis. 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
reporting pancreatitis and cutaneous vasculitus while on 
sitagliptin therapy. 
In clinical trials the number of pancreatitis cases is very 
low. However, since market introduction, 108 cases of 
(acute) pancreatitis were reported. For 38 of the cases, the 
lack of information did not allow full assessment. Two 
fatalities were reported, but the cases are confounded by 
several serious co-morbidities and concomitantly used 
medication. Based on the provided data, a causal relation 
between the use of sitagliptin and the occurrence of 
pancreatitis cannot be ruled out. Therefore, the inclusion of 
pancreatitis to section 4.8 of the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SPC) is acceptable.  
A total of 15 cases of cutaneous vasculitis were reported 
spontaneously and in clinical trials. In the majority of these 
Page 34/38 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
cases, patients were suffering from multiple co-morbidities 
and using many drugs concomitantly. Taking into account 
the fact that hypersensitivity reactions are known for 
sitagliptin-containing products (labeled in the current SPC) 
and the positive de- and rechallenge in an extensively 
documented case report, a causal relation between the use 
of sitagliptin and the occurrence of vasculitis is considered 
to be likely. The addition of cutaneous vasculitis to section 
4.8 is therefore acceptable.

glycaemic parameters.  
The decrease in body weight with the combination of 
sitagliptin and metformin was similar to that observed with 
metformin alone or placebo; there was no change from 
baseline for patients on sitagliptin alone.  
The overall incidence of adverse reactions considered as 
drug-related in patients treated with the combination of 
sitagliptin and metformin compared to patients treated with 
placebo was 14.0 % and 9.7 %, respectively. The overall 
incidence of adverse reactions considered as drug-related 
in patients treated with the combination of sitagliptin and 
metformin was comparable to metformin alone (14.0 % 
each) and greater than sitagliptin alone (6.7 %), with the 
differences relative to sitagliptin alone primarily due to 
gastrointestinal adverse reactions. 
Sections 4.8 and 5.1 of the SPC have been updated to

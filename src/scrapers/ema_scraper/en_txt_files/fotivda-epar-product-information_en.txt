CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Fotivda is indicated for the first line treatment of adult patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma 
(RCC) and for adult patients who are VEGFR and mTOR pathway inhibitor-naïve following disease 
progression after one prior treatment with cytokine therapy for advanced RCC. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Fotivda should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer therapies. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of tivozanib is 1340 microgram once daily for 21 days, followed by a 7-day 
rest period to comprise one complete treatment cycle of 4 weeks.  
This treatment schedule should be continued until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No more than one dose of Fotivda must be taken per day. 
Dose modification 
The occurrence of undesirable effects may require temporary interruption and/or dose reduction of 
tivozanib therapy (see section 4.4). In the pivotal study, the dose was reduced for grade 3 events and 
interrupted for grade 4 events. 
When dose reduction is necessary, the tivozanib dose can be reduced to 890 microgram once daily 
with the normal treatment schedule of 21 days of dosing, followed by a 7-day rest period. 
Missed dose 
In the case of a missed dose a replacement dose must not be taken to make up for a forgotten dose. 
The next dose should be taken at the next scheduled time. 
In the case of vomiting a replacement dose should not be taken; the next dose should be taken at the 
next scheduled time. 
Special populations 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of tivozanib in children and adolescents aged below 18 years have not been 
established. No data are available. There is no relevant use of tivozanib in the paediatric population in 
the indication advanced renal cell carcinoma. 
Elderly patients 
No dose adjustment is required in patients 65 years of age or older (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).  
Patients with renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment (see section 5.2). 
Caution is advised in patients with severe renal impairment due to limited experience and in patients 
undergoing dialysis as there is no experience of tivozanib in this patient population. 
Patients with hepatic impairment  
All patients should have liver function tests evaluated, including alanine aminotransferase (ALT), 
aspartate aminotransferase (AST), bilirubin, and alkaline phosphatase (AP), to determine hepatic 
function before starting and during treatment with tivozanib.  
Tivozanib is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment. Patients with moderate 
hepatic impairment should only be treated with one tivozanib 1340 microgram capsule every other day 
as they may be at an increased risk of adverse reactions due to increased exposure with the dose of 
1340 microgram every day (see section 4.4 and section 5.2). No dose adjustment is required when 
administering tivozanib to patients with mild hepatic impairment. Tivozanib should be used with 
caution in patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment with close monitoring of tolerability.  
Method of administration 
Fotivda is for oral use. 
Fotivda may be taken with or without food (see section 5.2). The capsules must be swallowed whole 
with a glass of water and must not be opened. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Co-administration with herbal preparations containing St. John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum) 
(see section 4.5).

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypertension 
In clinical studies with tivozanib, hypertension (including persistent severe hypertension) has occurred 
(see section 4.8). In approximately one-third of the patients, hypertension developed within the first 
2 months of treatment. Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating tivozanib. During 
treatment, patients should be monitored for hypertension and treated as needed with anti-hypertensive 
therapy according to standard medical practice. In the case of persistent hypertension despite use of 
anti-hypertensive therapy, the tivozanib dose should be reduced, or the treatment interrupted and 
re-initiated at a lower dose once the blood pressure is controlled, according to clinical judgment (see 
section 4.2). Discontinuation of treatment should be considered in cases of persistent severe 
hypertension, posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (see below), or other complications of 
hypertension. Patients receiving anti-hypertensive medicinal product should still be monitored for 
hypotension when tivozanib is either interrupted or discontinued.  
Arterial thromboembolic events 
In clinical studies with tivozanib, arterial thromboembolic events (ATEs) have occurred (see section 
4.8). Risk factors for ATE include malignant disease, age > 65 years, hypertension, diabetes mellitus, 
smoking, hypercholesterolaemia, and prior thromboembolic disease. Tivozanib has not been studied in 
patients who had an ATE within the preceding 6 months of clinical study initiation. Tivozanib must be 
used with caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of these events (such as 
myocardial infarction, stroke). 
Venous thromboembolic events 
In clinical studies with tivozanib, venous thromboembolic events (VTEs) have been reported including 
pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis (see section 4.8). Risk factors for VTEs include major 
surgery, multiple trauma, prior VTEs, advanced age, obesity, cardiac or respiratory failure, and 
prolonged immobility. Tivozanib has not been studied in patients who had a VTE within the preceding 
6 months of clinical study initiation. Treatment decision, especially in patients who are at risk for 
VTEs, should be based on individual patient benefit/risk assessment. 
Cardiac failure 
In clinical studies with tivozanib as monotherapy for the treatment of patients with RCC, cardiac 
failure has been reported (see section 4.8). Signs or symptoms of cardiac failure should be periodically 
monitored throughout treatment with tivozanib. Management of cardiac failure events may require 
temporary interruption or permanent discontinuation and/or dose reduction of tivozanib therapy, plus 
treatment of potential underlying causes of cardiac failure, e.g. hypertension. 
Haemorrhage 
In clinical studies with tivozanib, haemorrhagic events have been reported (see section 4.8). Tivozanib 
must be used with caution in patients who are at risk for, or who have a history of bleeding. If any 
bleeding requires medical intervention, tivozanib should be temporarily interrupted. 
Proteinuria 
Proteinuria has been reported in clinical studies with tivozanib (see section 4.8). Monitoring for 
proteinuria before initiation of, and periodically throughout treatment is recommended. For patients 
who develop Grade 2 (> 1.0-3.4 g/24 hours) or Grade 3 (≥ 3.5 g/24 hours) proteinuria (National 
Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [NCI CTCAE]), the dose of 
tivozanib has to be reduced or the treatment temporarily interrupted. If the patient develops Grade 4 
proteinuria (nephrotic syndrome) tivozanib has to be discontinued. Risk factors for proteinuria include 
high blood pressure. 
Hepatotoxicity 
In clinical studies with tivozanib, elevations of ALT, AST, and bilirubin have been reported (see 
section 4.8). The majority of AST and ALT elevations were not accompanied with concomitant 
elevations of bilirubin. AST, ALT, bilirubin, and AP should be monitored before initiation of and 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
periodically throughout treatment with tivozanib because of the potential risk of hepatotoxicity (see 
section 4.2).  
Tivozanib is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic impairment.   
Posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome (PRES) 
In clinical studies, one case of PRES was confirmed after treatment with tivozanib (see section 4.8). 
PRES is a neurological disorder which can present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, 
blindness and other visual and neurologic disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present. 
Magnetic Resonance Imaging is necessary to confirm the diagnosis of PRES. Tivozanib must be 
discontinued in patients developing signs or symptoms of PRES. The safety of re-initiating tivozanib 
therapy in patients previously experiencing PRES is not known and tivozanib should only be used 
with caution in these patients.  
Hand foot skin reaction (HFSR) 
In clinical studies with tivozanib, hand foot skin reaction (palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia) has 
been reported. Most events in the five renal cell carcinoma monotherapy studies were CTC 
Grade 1 or 2 (≥ CTC Grade 3 was observed in < 2% of patients treated with tivozanib) and there were 
no serious events (see section 4.8). Management of patients experiencing HFSR may include topical 
therapies for symptomatic relief with consideration of temporary interruption and/or reduction in 
treatment dose or, in severe or persistent cases, permanent discontinuation of treatment. 
QT interval prolongation 
In clinical studies with tivozanib, QT/QTc interval prolongation has been reported (see section 4.8 and 
section 5.1). QT/QTc interval prolongation may lead to an increased risk for ventricular arrhythmias. 
It is recommended that tivozanib be used with caution in patients with a history of QT interval 
prolongation or other relevant pre-existing cardiac disease and those receiving other medications 
known to increase the QT interval. Baseline and periodic monitoring of electrocardiograms and 
maintenance of electrolytes (e.g. calcium, magnesium, potassium) within the normal range is 
recommended.  
Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation/fistula 
It is recommended that symptoms of GI perforation or fistula should be periodically monitored 
throughout treatment with tivozanib and that tivozanib should be used with caution in patients at risk 
for GI perforation or fistula. 
Wound healing complications 
For precautionary reasons, temporary interruption of tivozanib therapy is recommended in patients 
undergoing major surgical procedures. The decision to resume tivozanib therapy after surgery should 
be based on clinical judgment of adequate wound healing. 
Hypothyroidism 
In clinical studies with tivozanib, hypothyroidism has been reported (see section 4.8). Hypothyroidism 
has been observed to occur at any time during treatment with tivozanib, developing as early as within 
two months of treatment initiation. Risk factors for hypothyroidism include prior history of 
hypothyroidism and use of anti-thyroid medications. Thyroid function should be monitored before 
initiation of, and periodically throughout treatment with tivozanib. Hypothyroidism should be treated 
according to standard medical practice. 
Elderly patients 
Dysphonia, diarrhoea, fatigue, weight decreased, appetite decreased and hypothyroidism occurred 
more commonly in patients ≥ 65 years of age. Healthcare professions should be aware that elderly 
patients may be at increased risk of adverse reactions. 
Tartrazine 
Fotivda 890 microgram hard capsules contain tartrazine (E102) which may cause allergic reactions. 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Aneurysms and artery dissections  
The use of VEGF pathway inhibitors in patients with or without hypertension may promote the 
formation of aneurysms and/or artery dissections. Before initiating Fotivda, this risk should be 
carefully considered in patients with risk factors such as hypertension or history of aneurysm. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Contraindication of concomitant use 
Herbal preparations containing St. John's wort (Hypericum perforatum) are contraindicated.  If a 
patient is already taking St John’s wort, this should be stopped before starting tivozanib treatment. The 
inducing effect of St John’s wort may persist for at least 2 weeks after cessation of treatment with St 
John’s wort (see section 4.3). 
Strong CYP3A4 inducers 
In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, co-administration of a single 1340 microgram dose of 
tivozanib with a strong CYP3A4 inducer at steady-state (rifampin 600 mg once daily) decreased the 
average half-life of tivozanib from 121 to 54 hours which was associated with a decrease in the single 
dose AUC0-∞ of 48% compared with AUC0-∞ in the absence of rifampin.  Average Cmax and AUC0-24hr 
were not significantly affected (8% increase and 6% decrease respectively). The clinical effects of 
strong CYP3A4 inducers on repeated daily dosing of tivozanib has not been studied but potentially the 
average time to reach steady-state and the average steady-state serum concentration of tivozanib may 
be reduced, due to the reduction in half-life.  It is recommended that concomitant administration of 
tivozanib with strong CYP3A4 inducers, if used, should be undertaken with caution.   
Moderate CYP3A4 inducers are not expected to have a clinically relevant effect on tivozanib 
exposure.  
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In a clinical study in healthy volunteers, co-administration of tivozanib with a potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor, ketoconazole (400 mg once daily), had no influence on tivozanib serum concentrations (Cmax 
or AUC); therefore, tivozanib exposure is unlikely to be altered by CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Medicinal products for which intestinal absorption is restricted by BCRP 
Tivozanib inhibits the transporter protein BCRP in vitro, but the clinical relevance of this finding is 
unknown (see section 5.2).  Caution should be exercised if tivozanib is co-administered with 
rosuvastatin. Alternatively, a statin not subject to restriction of intestinal absorption by BCRP should 
be considered. Patients taking an oral BCRP substrate with a clinically-relevant efflux interaction in 
the gut should ensure that a suitable time window (e.g. 2 hours) is applied between administration of 
tivozanib and the BCRP substrate. 
Contraceptives 
It is currently unknown whether tivozanib may reduce the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives, 
and therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should add a barrier method (see section 4.6). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential should avoid becoming pregnant while on tivozanib. Female partners 
of male patients taking tivozanib should also avoid pregnancy. Effective methods of contraception 
should be used by male and female patients and their partners during therapy, and for at least one 
month after completing therapy. It is currently unknown whether tivozanib may reduce the 
effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives and therefore women using hormonal contraceptives should 
add a barrier method. 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of tivozanib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tivozanib should not be used during pregnancy. If tivozanib is used during pregnancy, or if the patient 
becomes pregnant while receiving tivozanib, the potential hazard to the foetus must be explained to 
the patient. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether tivozanib is excreted in human milk, but the potential exists. Because of the 
potential for tivozanib-mediated adverse reactions in breastfed infants, women should not breast-feed 
while taking tivozanib. 
Fertility 
Animal studies indicate that male and female fertility may be affected by treatment with tivozanib (see 
section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Tivozanib may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Patients should be 
advised to be cautious when driving or using machines if they experience asthenia, fatigue, and/or 
dizziness during treatment with tivozanib (see section 4.8). 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Pooled data of 674 patients with advanced RCC who continued to receive tivozanib as their initial on 
trial therapy in the five core RCC monotherapy studies have been evaluated in the overall assessment 
of safety and tolerability of tivozanib. 
The most important serious adverse reaction is hypertension. 
The most common adverse reactions of any grade include hypertension (47.6%), dysphonia 
(26.9%), fatigue (25.8%) and diarrhoea (25.5%). 
In the five core RCC monotherapy studies tivozanib was discontinued in a total of 20 patients (3%) 
owing to adverse reactions, most commonly due to hypertension (0.4%), persistent severe 
hypertension (0.3%), or acute myocardial infarction (0.3%). The most frequent adverse reactions 
leading to tivozanib dose reduction/ interruption were hypertension (4.7%), diarrhoea (3.1%), fatigue 
(1.8%). 
In patients receiving tivozanib as initial therapy, there were three adverse reactions with outcome 
death; one was uncontrolled hypertension in the setting of a suspected overdose (see section 4.9) and 
two were reported simply as death. 
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions 
Adverse reactions occurring in patients who continued to receive tivozanib as their initial on trial 
therapy in the five RCC monotherapy studies were pooled and are listed below by MedDRA body 
system organ class (SOC) and frequency. Frequencies are defined as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); 
common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100), rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000) and not 
known (cannot be estimated from available data). Within each SOC, adverse reactions are presented in 
order of decreasing seriousness.

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Hypertension 
Hypertension was reported as an adverse reaction in 47.6% of patients receiving tivozanib as initial 
therapy; in 23.0% the hypertension was CTC ≥Grade 3. Persistent severe hypertension (‘hypertensive 
crisis’) was an adverse reaction in 1.0%, CTC Grade 3 or higher in 0.9%. One patient died as a result 
of uncontrolled hypertension in the setting of a suspected overdose. 
Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) 
PRES (also known as reversible posterior leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS)) was confirmed in 
one non-RCC patient after approximately 8 weeks on tivozanib. PRES is a neurological disorder that 
may present with headache, seizure, lethargy, confusion, blindness and other visual and neurologic 
disturbances. Mild to severe hypertension may be present (see section 4.4).  
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Venous thromboembolism 
Pulmonary embolism was reported in patients (0.7%) receiving tivozanib as initial therapy in the five 
core RCC monotherapy studies, with the majority CTC Grade ≥ 3 (see section 4.4). Deep vein 
thrombosis was also reported in two patients (0.3%) and was CTC Grade ≥ 3 in one patient (0.1%) 
receiving initial tivozanib therapy.   
Arterial thromboembolic events 
Arterial thromboembolic adverse reactions in the patients receiving tivozanib as initial therapy were 
ischaemic stroke (1.0%), myocardial infarction (0.7%), transient ischaemic attack (0.7%) and acute 
myocardial infarction (0.4%), the majority of which were at least CTC Grade 3, plus iliac artery 
thrombosis (0.1%). There were no deaths due to arterial thromboembolic adverse reactions in those 
receiving tivozanib as initial therapy but a myocardial infarction in a patient receiving second-line 
tivozanib had a fatal outcome. 
Cardiac failure 
Pulmonary oedema was reported in two patients (0.3%) receiving tivozanib as initial therapy in the 
five core RCC monotherapy studies. Both events were CTC Grade 3 (see section 4.4). 
QT/QTc prolongation 
QT prolongation was reported in two patients (CTC Grade 2 and Grade 3) in the tivozanib cardiac 
safety study, neither reaction was considered serious (see section 4.4 and section 5.1). 
Hypothyroidism 
Hypothyroidism was reported as an adverse reaction for 5.6% of patients during initial therapy and 
was CTC Grade 2 or lower in all cases. It was reported as serious in one patient. 
Haemorrhage 
Haemorrhage adverse reactions were reported in the core monotherapy studies during initial treatment 
(see section 4.4).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Two patients received excessive doses of tivozanib during the monotherapy studies.  A patient with a 
history of hypertension experienced aggravated uncontrolled hypertension that was fatal after taking 
3 doses of 1340 microgram tivozanib in one day (total 4020 microgram).  No adverse reaction was 
experienced by the second patient who took 2 doses of 1340 microgram tivozanib in one day (total 
2680 microgram).   
Blood pressure should be well controlled prior to initiating tivozanib and patients should be monitored 
for hypertension during treatment (see section 4.4). 
In cases of suspected overdose, tivozanib should be discontinued and the patient monitored for 
hypertension and treated as needed with standard anti-hypertensive therapy. 
There is no specific treatment or antidote for tivozanib overdose.

Mechanism of action  
Tivozanib potently and selectively blocks all 3 vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 
and has been shown to block various VEGF-induced biochemical and biologic responses in vitro, 
including VEGF-ligand-induced phosphorylation of all three VEGFR 1, 2 and 3, and proliferation of 
human endothelial cells. The next most potently inhibited kinase is c-kit which is 8-fold less sensitive 
to inhibition by tivozanib compared to VEGFR 1, 2 and 3. VEGF is a potent mitogenic factor that 
plays a central role in angiogenesis and vascular permeability of tumour tissues. By blocking 
VEGF-induced VEGFR activation, tivozanib inhibits angiogenesis and vascular permeability in 
tumour tissues, leading to inhibition of tumour growth in vivo.  
Clinical efficacy and safety  
The efficacy of tivozanib in the treatment of advanced RCC was studied in the following randomised 
clinical study. 
Study AV-951-09-301 
This controlled clinical study was a Phase 3 multi-centre, open-label, international, randomised study 
comparing tivozanib with sorafenib in patients with advanced RCC. Five hundred and seventeen (517) 
patients with recurrent or metastatic RCC with a clear cell component were randomised (1:1) to 
receive either tivozanib 1340 microgram once daily on a schedule of 3 weeks on treatment followed 
by 1 week off (schedule 3/1) or sorafenib 400 mg twice a day. The study included patients who had all 
undergone prior nephrectomy, and who had received either no prior therapy or no more than one prior 
systemic therapy in the metastatic setting (immunotherapy/chemotherapy); prior treatment with VEGF 
or mechanistic Target of Rapamycin (mTOR) targeted therapy was not allowed. Cross-over to the 
tivozanib arm was permitted upon Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumours (RECIST)-defined 
progression on sorafenib according to the protocol of a separate extension study.  
The primary endpoint of the study was progression-free survival (PFS) by blinded independent 
radiology review; key secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS) and objective response rate 
(ORR) by independent radiology review.  
The intent-to-treat (ITT) population included 517 patients, 260 randomised to tivozanib and 
257 randomised to sorafenib. The baseline demographic and disease characteristics were generally 
well balanced across the tivozanib and sorafenib arms with regard to age (mean age 58.2 vs 58.4 years 
respectively), gender (71.2% vs 73.5% male respectively), race (95.8% vs 96.9% white respectively), 
geographic region (88.1% vs 88.7% from Central/Eastern Europe respectively) and prior treatment for 
metastatic RCC (69.6% vs 70.8% treatment naïve respectively). For the 30% of patients receiving 
prior treatment, the predominant therapy was interferon alpha as monotherapy which was received by 
75 patients in the tivozanib arm and 62 patients in the sorafenib arm.  
Tivozanib showed a statistically significant improvement in PFS and ORR over sorafenib by 
independent radiology review (Table 2 and Figure 1).

OS was a key secondary endpoint in the pivotal study and the analysis included data from all 
randomized patients, including those who progressed on sorafenib and crossed over to receive 
tivozanib as part of the extension study.  In the ITT population there was a small numerical difference 
between the two arms in terms of overall survival.  median OS was 28.2 months (95% CI 22.5, 33.0)

in the tivozanib arm compared to 30.8 months (95% CI 28.4, 33.3) in the sorafenib arm (HR=1.147, 
p=0.276).  
Elderly patients 
In a controlled clinical study (AV-951-09-301), in which 25% of patients receiving tivozanib were 
≥ 65 years of age, no overall differences was observed in efficacy between elderly and younger 
patients (see section 4.2).  
In the core RCC studies some adverse reaction occurred more commonly in the elderly (see section 
4.4). 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
In a cardiac safety study of 50 patients with advanced solid tumours treated with tivozanib at 
1340 microgram daily for 21 days, the mean change from baseline in QTcF was 6.8 ms on day 21 of 
dosing. The maximum change in QTcF from baseline was 9.3 ms (90% CI: 5, 13.6), which occurred 
2.5 hours after dosing on Day 21. The central tendency change for all measured days and across all 
time points was 2.2 ms. No subjects had a new > 500 ms change in QTcF; 2 patients (4%) had QTcF 
values > 480 ms. One subject (2%) had a > 60 ms change from baseline in QTcF and 6 subjects (12%) 
had a 30 ms to 60 ms change from baseline (see section 4.4 and section 4.8).  
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
tivozanib in all subsets of the paediatric population in advanced renal cell carcinoma (see section 4.2 
for information on paediatric use).  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Following oral administration of tivozanib, peak serum levels are achieved after approximately 2 to 
24 hours. After a single 1340 microgram dose, mean Cmax was 10.2 to 25.2 ng/mL across healthy 
subject and patient studies. Single dose AUC0-inf for healthy volunteers dosed with 1340 microgram 
tivozanib was 1,950 to 2,491 ng.hr/mL. After once daily dosing of 1340 microgram tivozanib for 21 or 
28 days in RCC patients, Cmax was 67.5 to 94.3 ng/mL and AUC0-24 was 1,180 to 1,641 ng.hr/mL. 
Exposure is dose proportional between 890 and 1340 microgram and dose related over the wider range 
of 450 mg and 1790 microgram.  Accumulation at steady-state is approximately 6- to 7- fold the 
exposure observed at single-dose levels.  Clearance is similar between acute and chronic dosing 
indicating no time dependent changes in PK.   
When tivozanib was evaluated in a food effect study in healthy subjects, a high fat meal decreased the 
peak serum concentrations (Cmax) by 23.4% compared to the fasted state. There was no effect of food 
on the overall exposure (AUC). Based on these data, tivozanib can be dosed with or without food (see 
section 4.2).  
Distribution 
In vitro protein binding studies have shown that tivozanib is > 99% bound to plasma proteins. No 
concentration dependence of plasma protein binding was observed over the range of 0.1 to 5 µmol/L 
tivozanib. Albumin is the major tivozanib binding component in human plasma. In vitro studies have 
shown that tivozanib is neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of the multidrug efflux pump, 
P-glycoprotein. In vitro studies suggest that tivozanib is an inhibitor of intestinal BCRP. 
Biotransformation 
In vitro metabolism studies have shown that CYP3A4 and CYP1A1 are capable of metabolising 
tivozanib. Unchanged tivozanib is the major circulating form of the molecule, and there were no major 
metabolites detected in serum at exposure equal to or greater than 10% of the total radioactivity 
exposure. As CYP1A1 is primarily expressed in extrahepatic tissues such as the lung and intestine, it 
was considered unlikely that this isoform would be extensively involved in hepatic metabolism. 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro studies have shown that metabolites of tivozanib can undergo UGT mediated 
biotransformation via the UGT1A1, UGT1A3, UGT1A7, UGT1A8, UGT1A9, and UGT1A10 
pathways. Direct N-glucoronidation of tivozanib was a minor pathway of metabolism in vitro. 
Elimination 
After chronic dosing of tivozanib in RCC patients for 21 days followed by 7 days without 
administration of tivozanib, tivozanib Cmin is approximately 16.0 to 30.9 ng/mL. 
In studies that evaluated the terminal elimination phase, tivozanib had a mean t½ of 4.5 - 5.1 days. 
After a single dose oral dose of [14C] tivozanib, approximately 79% of the radioactivity was recovered 
in the faeces and approximately 12% was found in the urine as metabolites. There was no unchanged 
tivozanib recovered in the urine indicating that tivozanib does not undergo renal excretion.  [14C] 
Tivozanib was the predominant drug-related material in faeces. There were no [14C]-containing 
metabolites present in faeces at greater than 10% of the dose. 
Special populations 
Age, gender and race 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis, there is no clinically relevant effect of age, gender 
or race on the pharmacokinetics of tivozanib. 
Hepatic impairment 
Results from a single dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of tivozanib 
in subjects with hepatic impairment show that across the entire measurement period, tivozanib was 
eliminated more slowly in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh Class B) or severe (Child-Pugh Class 
C) hepatic impairment. Tivozanib exposure was increased in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
(mean AUC0-∞ by 4.0-fold) and in patients with moderate hepatic impairment (mean 
AUC0-∞ by 2.6-fold).  No significant increase in exposure was observed in patients with mild 
(Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment (mean AUC0-∞ by 1.2-fold). Tivozanib should be used with 
caution in patients with moderate hepatic impairment and the dose reduced to one 1340 microgram 
capsule every other day.  Tivozanib should not be used in patients with severe hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.2 and section 4.4).  
Renal impairment 
Clinical studies with tivozanib were conducted in RCC patients with serum creatinine concentration 
≤ 2 times the upper limit of normal, including those who may have had a prior nephrectomy. Although 
the impact of further impairment of renal function on the overall disposition of tivozanib is unknown, 
a clinical study has shown that no unchanged tivozanib is excreted in the urine indicating that 
tivozanib does not undergo renal excretion. According to the population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
tivozanib exposure, no dose adjustment is required in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Experience of tivozanib use in patients with severe renal impairment is limited and caution is advised.  
CYP and UGT in vitro studies 
In vitro studies with tivozanib indicate that it is not a CYP enzyme inducer. In vitro studies conducted 
in human liver microsomes and hepatocytes evaluating the activity of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2A6, 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 suggested that tivozanib is a weak inhibitor of 
CYP2B6 and CYP2C8.  Based on the in vitro IC50 and in vivo unbound Cmax, tivozanib was unlikely to 
interact in a clinically relevant manner with active substances that are metabolised by these enzyme 
pathways.  
Studies conducted in vitro have shown that tivozanib is not a potent inhibitor of UGT 
(UDP-glucuronosyltransferase) metabolic activities and clinically relevant drug-drug interactions are 
unlikely with medicinal products metabolised by these pathways. 
Transporter in vitro studies 
In vitro studies have shown that tivozanib is neither a substrate nor inhibitor of the transporter proteins 
MDR1 (P-gp), OCT1, OATP1B1, OATP1B3 and BSEP.  Furthermore, tivozanib was not an in vitro 
inhibitor of OAT1, OAT3, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2-K or substrate of MRP2 and BCRP. 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tivozanib inhibits the transporter protein BCRP in vitro, at concentrations that are likely to restrict the 
effect to intestinal BCRP activity in vivo.   
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Adverse reactions not observed in clinical studies, but seen in animals at exposure levels similar to 
clinical exposure levels and with possible relevance to clinical use were as follows. 
In repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, abnormalities were noted in growing incisors (thin brittle teeth, 
tooth loss, malocclusions) at doses approximately 2-fold greater than the calculated human equivalent 
dose and growth plate hypertrophy was observed at doses approximately 0.7- to 7-fold greater than the 
calculated human equivalent dose. Tivozanib was shown to cause growth plate hypertrophy, absence 
of active corpora lutea and no maturing follicles in cynomolgus monkeys at dose levels that produced 
exposures equivalent to those seen at the recommended clinical dose.  
Reproduction, mutagenesis, impairment of fertility 
Tivozanib may impair human fertility. In nonclinical studies assessing mating and fertility parameters 
in male rats, doses > 2-fold higher than the recommended clinical dose, produced increased 
epididymis and testis weights associated with infertility. Increased testis weights were observed at a 
dose 7-fold higher than the recommended clinical dose.  In female rats, an increase in non-viable 
foetuses was noted at a dose 0.7-fold the recommended clinical dose, while dose levels ≥ 2 fold the 
recommended clinical dose produced infertility. 
Tivozanib was shown to be teratogenic, embryotoxic and foetotoxic in pregnant rats at dose levels 
5 times lower than the recommended clinical dose (based on a 60 kg human). Studies in pregnant 
rabbits showed no effect on maternal health or embryo foetal development at doses approximately 
0.6 times the human exposure at the recommended dose. 
Carcinogenesis 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with tivozanib.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Fotivda is and what it is used for  
The active substance in Fotivda is tivozanib, which is a protein kinase inhibitor. Tivozanib reduces the 
supply of blood to the cancer, which slows down the growth and spread of cancer cells. It works by 
blocking the action of a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Blocking the action 
of VEGF prevents the formation of new blood vessels. 
Fotivda is used to treat adults with advanced kidney cancer. It is used where other treatments such as 
interferon-alpha or interleukin-2 have either not yet been used or have not helped to stop your disease. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Fotivda  
Do not take Fotivda:  
• 
If you are allergic to tivozanib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6);  
If you are taking St. John’s Wort (also known as Hypericum perforatum, a herbal remedy used 
for treatment of depression and anxiety). 
• 
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Fotivda:  
• 
if you have high blood pressure 
Fotivda can increase your blood pressure. Your doctor will monitor your blood pressure 
regularly and, if it is too high, may either give you a medicine to lower it, or reduce your dose of 
Fotivda. However, if your blood pressure remains too high, your doctor may decide to interrupt 
or to stop treatment with Fotivda. If you are already taking a medicine to treat high blood 
pressure, and your doctor reduces the dose of Fotivda or interrupts or stops treatment, you will 
be regularly checked for low blood pressure.  
• 
if you have or have had an aneurysm (enlargement and weakening of a blood vessel wall) or a 
tear in a blood vessel wall.

• 
• 
• 
if you have had problems with blood clots  
Treatment with Fotivda may raise the risk of developing a blood clot (thrombus) in your blood 
vessels that could break loose and be carried by the blood stream to block another blood vessel.  
Tell your doctor if you have ever had one of the following:  
o 
a blood clot in your lungs (with cough, chest pain, sudden shortness of breath or coughing 
up blood) 
blood clot in your legs or arms, eye, or brain (with pain or swelling in your hands or feet, 
reduced vision, or changes in your mental state) 
a stroke, or signs and symptoms of a ‘mini-stroke’ (transient ischaemic attack) 
a heart attack 
high blood pressure 
diabetes 
major surgery 
multiple injuries such as broken bones and damage to internal organs 
inability to move for a long period 
heart failure which can cause shortness of breath or ankle swelling

Swelling (oedema) in your legs, ankles and feet 
o 
Reduced ability to exercise 
o 
Persistent cough or wheezing with white or pink blood-tinged phlegm 
Signs and symptoms of heart failure will be monitored whilst you are taking your medicine. If 
necessary, your doctor may reduce your dose of Fotivda, or interrupt or stop this treatment. 
If you have or are treated for an abnormal rate and rhythm of the heartbeat (arrhythmia) 
Your doctor will monitor the effect of Fotivda on your heart by recording the electrical activity 
of your heart (an electrocardiogram) or by measuring your blood calcium, magnesium and 
potassium levels during your treatment.  
if you have problems with your liver  
Your doctor will regularly monitor how well your liver is working before and during treatment 
with Fotivda (e.g. with blood tests), and if necessary may need to reduce how often you take 
Fotivda.  
if you have problems with your thyroid gland or use medicines to treat thyroid disease 
Treatment with Fotivda may cause your thyroid gland to work less well than usual. Your doctor 
will regularly monitor how well your thyroid gland is working before and during treatment with 
Fotivda (e.g. with blood tests).  
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse while taking Fotivda:  
• 
if you get shortness of breath or ankle swelling 
Tell your doctor right away as these may be symptoms of heart failure. Your doctor will 
monitor this, and depending on the severity may reduce your dose of Fotivda, or interrupt or 
stop treatment with Fotivda. 
• 
if you have had problems with bleeding 
Treatment with Fotivda may increase the risk of bleeding. If you get bleeding problems (with 
painful swollen stomach (abdomen), vomiting blood, coughing up blood, black stools, blood in 
your urine, headache or changes in your mental state), tell your doctor right away. Treatment 
with Fotivda may need to be temporarily stopped.

if you suffer from a disease of the brain, called posterior reversible encephalopathy 
syndrome (PRES) 
Tell your doctor right away if you have symptoms such as headache, seizure (fit), lack of 
energy, confusion, blindness or other visual and neurologic disturbances such as weakness in an 
arm or a leg. If PRES is diagnosed, your doctor will stop treatment with Fotivda.  
if the skin on the palms of your hands and the soles of your feet become dry, cracked, 
scaling, or peeling, or is stinging or tingling 
These may be symptoms of a condition called hand foot skin reaction. Your doctor will treat the 
condition and, depending on the severity, the doctor may reduce your dose of Fotivda, or 
interrupt or stop this treatment. 
if you have symptoms of gastrointestinal perforation or fistula formation (developing a hole 
in the stomach or intestine or abnormal passages forming between parts of the intestine) such as 
severe stomach pain, chills, fever, nausea, vomiting or painful bowel obstruction, diarrhoea or 
rectal bleeding.  
Your doctor will regularly monitor you for these symptoms during your treatment with Fotivda. 
if you need to have an operation or another form of surgery 
Your doctor may recommend that you temporarily stop taking Fotivda if you have an operation 
or surgery, as it could affect wound healing.

studied in children and adolescents.

medicines. This includes herbal medicines and other medicines you have bought without a 
prescription.

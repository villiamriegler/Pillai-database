Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Trixeo Aerosphere 
Formoterol / glycopyrronium bromide/ budesonide 
On 15 October 2020, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Trixeo 
Aerosphere, intended for maintenance treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) in 
adults whose disease is not adequately controlled. The applicant for this medicinal product is AstraZeneca 
AB. 
Trixeo Aerosphere will be available as a pressurised inhalation suspension; each actuation will contain 
5 micrograms of formoterol fumarate dihydrate, glycopyrronium bromide 9 micrograms, equivalent to 
7.2 micrograms of glycopyrronium, and budesonide 160 micrograms. Formoterol is a long-acting beta2 
receptor agonist (LABA), glycopyrronium bromide is a long-acting muscarinic receptor antagonist (LAMA) 
and budesonide is an inhaled glucocorticoid. Formoterol and glycopyrronium bromide produce relaxation 
of bronchial smooth muscle helping to dilate the airways and make breathing easier, whereas budesonide 
reduces inflammation in the lungs (ATC code: R03AL11). 
The benefits of Trixeo Aerosphere are its ability to reduce the rate of moderate or severe COPD 
exacerbations as defined by rate of moderate or severe COPD exacerbations over 52 weeks and improve 
lung function measured as change from baseline in morning pre-dose trough FEV1 over 24 weeks. 
The most common side effects are pneumonia (4.6%), headache (2.7%) and urinary tract infection 
(2.7%). 
The full indication is: 
Trixeo Aerosphere is indicated as a maintenance treatment in adult patients with moderate to 
severe chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who are not adequately treated by a 
combination of an inhaled corticosteroid and a long-acting beta2-agonist or combination of a 
long-acting beta2-agonist and a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (for effects on symptoms 
control and prevention of exacerbations see section 5.1). 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
1 Summaries of positive opinion are published without prejudice to the Commission decision, which will normally be issued 67 
days from adoption of the opinion

Rationale for Submitting an Updated RMP
The glofitamab European Union Risk Management Plan (EU RMP) Version 1.2 is
submitted in response to the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Day 180 list of questions for MAA procedure EMEA/H/C/005751. Safety data has been 
updated to include patients within the primary safety population or overall safety 
population who received at least one dose of glofitamab. This update aligns with the 
presentation of glofitamab-exposed patients in the primary safety population in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) (N=145).

References to SmPC updated under rationale for important exclusion 
criteria.
Exposure in special populations updated to include patients within the 
primary safety population or overall safety population who received at least 
one dose of glofitamab. 
Data on safety concerns and risks not considered important updated to 
include patients within the primary safety population or overall safety 
population who received at least one dose of glofitamab. The missing 
information of Long-term Safety was updated to include evaluation of safety 
data by sex as part of the long-term safety data analysis in Study NP30179. 
The missing information of Safety in Patients with Prior CAR-T Therapy was 
updated to specify analysis in Study NP30179 as an additional 
pharmacovigilance activity.
Monitoring and reporting of safety data by sex in the PBRER was added a 
routine pharmacovigilance activity beyond adverse reactions reporting and 
signal detection for the missing information of Long-term Safety.
Study NP30179 was re-classified as a Category 2 PASS. Safety in Patients 
with Prior CAR-T Therapy was included as a safety concern addressed by 
PASS NP30179. Evaluation of safety data by sex was included as part of the 
long-term safety data analysis in PASS NP30179. Milestone dates for Study 
BO43309 were updated.

Brief description of the product
Chemical class:  Glofitamab is a humanized 
anti-CD20 anti-CD3 bispecific monoclonal 
antibody.
Summary of mode of action:  Glofitamab is a 
bispecific monoclonal antibody that binds 
bivalently to CD20 expressed on the surface of B 
cells, and monovalently to CD3 in the T-cell 
receptor complex expressed on the surface of T 
cells. By simultaneous binding to CD20 on the 
B cell and CD3 on the T cell, glofitamab mediates 
the formation of an immunological synapse with 
subsequent T-cell activation and proliferation, 
secretion of cytokines and release of cytolytic 
proteins that results in the lysis of CD20-
expressing B cells.
Important information about its composition: 
Glofitamab is a humanized anti-CD20 anti-CD3 
bispecific monoclonal antibody produced in 
Chinese hamster ovary cells by recombinant DNA 
technology.

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION
PART II: MODULE SI EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE INDICATION(S) AND 
TARGET POPULATION(S)
SI.1 DIFFUSE LARGE B-CELL LYMPHOMA
Incidence
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: According to the International Agency for Research on 
Cancer (IARC), Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma (NHL) is the 11th most common cancer 
worldwide with more than 540,000 incident cases (all ages) estimated in 2020, 
accounting for an age-standardized incidence of 5.8 per 100,000 population worldwide. 
In Europe as well, NHL is the 11th most common cancer among all cancer types, 
accounting for an age-standardized incidence of 8.4 per 100,000 population in 2020. In 
the United States, NHL is the seventh most common cancer with an age-standardized 
incidence of 12.1 per 100,000 population in 2020 (GLOBOCAN 2020). Table 2 describes 
the incidence of NHL worldwide, in the United States, Europe, Asia and Africa (available 
from Global Cancer Observatory [GLOBOCAN] 2020 database, World Health 
Organization [WHO]).
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most 
common type of NHL, representing approximately one-third of all cases worldwide. 
According to the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) cancer statistics, 
the annual age-adjusted incidence of DLBCL in the US was 5.6 per 100,000 for both 
sexes between 2014 and 2018 (SEER Cancer Stat Facts). Based on the data from 
French Network of Cancer Registries, the crude incidence rate of DLBCL in 2018 was 
reported to be 8.8 per 100,000 PY for men and 6.8 per 100,000 PY for women, while the 
age-standardized incidence rate of DLBCL was reported to be 4.7 and 3.2 per 100,000 
PY for men and women respectively (Defossez et al. 2019). According to the 
Hematological Malignancy Research Network, UK, the annual incidence of DLBCL-not 
otherwise specified (NOS) was reported to be 7.3 per 100,000 (7.9 for males vs 6.8 for 
females) between 2010 and 2016 (Hematological Malignancy Research Network). A 
study by Smith and colleagues reported an annual age-standardized incidence of 6.6 per 
100,000 population for DLBCL between 2004 and 2012 using UK’s population-based 
Hematological Malignancy Research Network database (Smith et al. 2015). A study in 
Sweden reported that the incidence of DLBCL increased by 2.2% annually between
2004 and 2016 (Ekberg et al. 2020). Although the curability rate is high for DLBCL 
patients, 30-40% of patients will relapse or exhibit refractory disease (Sarkozy and Sehn 
2018). A study aimed to assess relapsed/refractory (R/R) DLBCL epidemiology in 
Sweden based on the cohort of 4243 DLBCL patients from Swedish Lymphoma Register 
between 2007 and 2014 found that the progression or relapse is 18.9% at 2 years and 
23.1% at 5 years of all DLBCL patients (Harrysson et al. 2021). Another retrospective 
study (REAL-TREND) identified 2778 patients with newly diagnosed DLBCL between 
2010 and 2015 in China. The estimated 5-year cumulative incidence of refractory 
DLBCL patients was 20% (Wang et al. 2021). Throughout the world, the incidence

increases with age; for example, in the US, rates rise from 0.3/100,000/year (in patients 
that are 0−19 years old) to 4.6/100,000/year (20−64 years) and to 33.5/100,000/year 
(ages 65+) (SEER Cancer Statistics Review 1975-2015).
Prevalence
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma: The IARC estimates that over 1.5 million people are living 
with NHL (all ages) globally with a 5-year prevalence proportion of 19.8 per 100,000 
population in 2020. In Europe, the 5-year prevalence was 52.0 per 100,000 population in 
2020, while the prevalence was 72.6 per 100,000 population in the US (GLOBOCAN 
2020). Table 2 describes the prevalence of NHL worldwide, in the US, Europe, Asia and 
Africa (available from GLOBOCAN 2020 database and fact sheets, WHO).
Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: A population-based study (Hematological Malignancy 
Research Network, UK) between 2004 and 2012 reported that the 3-year, 5-year and 
10-year prevalence proportion of DLBCL was 17.6, 25.9 and 43.3 per 100,000 
respectively (Smith et al. 2015). Another population-based study in Sweden reported 
that the 2-year, 5-year and 10-year prevalence of DLBCL in 2016 was 13.0, 28.4 and 
46.2 per 100,000 population respectively. The 5-year prevalence increased by 66% 
between 2004 and 2016 with an average annual increase of 3.9% (Ekberg et al. 2020).

The Main Existing Treatment Options
According to the European Society for Medical Oncology 2015 guidelines (Tilly et al. 
2015) and National Comprehensive Cancer Network 2019 guidelines on DLBCL 
(Zelenetz et al. 2019), the current standard of care for first-line treatment for DLBCL is a 
regimen of cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (CHOP) in 
combination with an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody (mAb) rituximab (R-CHOP). An 
intensification of chemotherapy with rituximab, doxorubicin, vindesine, 
cyclophosphamide, bleomycin and prednisolone, given every 2 weeks followed by 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.2 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd

sequential consolidation is also recommended alternatively in young patients with bulky 
disease.
For patients who are not cured with first-line therapy, high-dose chemotherapy with 
autologous stem cell transplantation (ASCT) is appropriate second-line treatment for R/R
DLBCL that is chemotherapy-sensitive at relapse and in patients who are candidates for 
transplant. Patients not suitable for high-dose therapy may be treated with the same or 
other salvage regimens such as rituximab, gemcitabine, and oxaliplatin. Patients who 
relapse after second-line therapy are unlikely to respond to subsequent therapy and 
therefore generally are not eligible for ASCT (Tilly et al. 2015, Zelenetz et al. 2019). 
Patients who are not candidates for transplant should ideally be treated in the context of 
a clinical trial. Standard options include gemcitabine-based regimens ± rituximab, 
bendamustine ± rituximab, or brentuximab vedotin for CD30-positive disease. 
Lenalidomide ± rituximab and ibrutinib are appropriate options at relapse, particularly for 
patients with non–germinal center B-cell–like DLBCL. Patients who are not candidates 
for transplant and experience a partial response to second-line therapy, those with 
refractory disease during second-line therapy (regardless of transplant eligibility), and 
those who experience disease relapse following high dose chemotherapy plus ASCT or 
allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation should be managed with third-line systemic 
therapy, palliative radiotherapy, or best supportive care (Zelenetz et al. 2019).
Axicabtagene ciloleucel, tisagenlecleucel and lisocabtagene maraleucel are anti-CD19 
chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapies approved by FDA (Food and Drug 
Administration) and EMA (European Medicines Agency) for the treatment of adult 
patients with relapsed/refractory DLBCL (Zelenetz et al. 2019). 
Risk Factors for the Disease
Older age is a strong risk factor for NHL, with most cases occurring in people aged >65 
years. Globally, men have over double the cumulative lifetime risk of developing NHL. 
Greater prevalence of certain risk factors, such as obesity, human immunodeficiency 
virus (HIV), and chemical exposure among men may help explain the increased risk. In 
the United States, white and non-Hispanic people are at highest risk of NHL, while 
Asian/Pacific Islander, American Indian and black populations are at the lowest risk. 
Family history of hematological malignancy, and certain autoimmune diseases such as 
Sjögren’s syndrome, systemic lupus erythematosus, celiac disease, and scleroderma
have been associated with various subtypes of NHL (Thandra et al. 2021).
In a pooled analysis of 4667 DLBCL cases from 19 studies, it was reported that DLBCL 
was associated with B-cell activating autoimmune diseases, hepatitis C virus 
seropositivity, family history of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, higher young adult body mass 
index, higher recreational sun exposure, any atopic disorder, and higher socioeconomic 
status. Additional risk factors for women were occupation as field crop/vegetable farm 
worker, hairdresser, and seamstress/embroider, low adult body mass index, hormone 
replacement therapy started at least at 50 years of age, and oral contraceptive use

before 1970. Additional risk factors for men were occupation as material handling 
equipment operator, lifetime alcohol consumption, and previous blood transfusion 
(Cerhan et al. 2014).
Natural History of the Indicated Condition in the (Untreated) Population
Non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma ranks as the 11th most common cause of death among all 
cancers worldwide. An estimated 259,793 deaths were attributed to NHL in 2020 
worldwide, with an age-standardized mortality rate of 2.6 per 100,000 population. It is 
the 12th most common cancer death in Europe, with 49,684 deaths, and eighth most 
common in the US, with 20,858 deaths in 2020 (GLOBOCAN 2020). Table 2 describes 
the mortality due to NHL worldwide, in the US, Europe, Asia and Africa (available from 
GLOBOCAN 2020 database and fact sheets, WHO). Based on the SEER Explorer 
database, from 2000 to 2017, the 5-year and 10-year survival rate of NHL is 71.5% and 
64.4% respectively, since the time of diagnosis (SEER Explorer Database).
Nearly 40% of patients with DLBCL will eventually die of relapsed disease or disease 
that is refractory to first-line therapy. Per SEER cancer statistics, the 5-year relative 
survival for patients with DLBCL was 63.9% in the US between 2011 and 2017. The 5-
year relative survival was 73.6% for Stage I and Stage II, 63.7% for stage III and 53.2% 
for Stage IV DLBCL (SEER Cancer Stat Facts). In a population-based cohort of 4243 
relapsed/refractory DLBCL patients in Sweden, 5-year overall survival for patients 
treated with curative intent was 65.3% (Harrysson et al. 2021).
Important Co-Morbidities
A retrospective study identified 3905 adult patients diagnosed with DLBCL (2007–2013) 
through the Swedish Lymphoma Register. The most prevalent comorbid conditions were 
cardiovascular diseases (14%), solid cancer (13%), diabetes (10%), cerebrovascular 
diseases (9%), chronic pulmonary disease (7%), and rheumatologic disease (5%) 
(Wasterlid et al. 2019). Another retrospective study identified 181 DLBCL patients 
between 2010 and 2012 in Austria. The most common comorbid conditions were solid 
cancer (3.9%), diabetes (3.9%), chronic pulmonary disease (3.9%), connective tissue 
disease (3.3%), congestive heart disease (2.2%), and cerebrovascular disease (2.2%) 
(Kocher et al. 2020).
PART II: MODULE SII NONCLINICAL PART OF THE SAFETY 
SPECIFICATION
Key findings with glofitamab identified in single- and repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 
4-weeks in duration in cynomolgus monkeys included B-cell depletion, transient post-
dose cytokine release, primarily after the first dose and changes secondary to cytokine 
release (clinical signs, acute phase reactions, changes in leukocytes and an increase in 
heart rate and body temperature).

of
1770
Cynomolgus monkeys with severe cytokine release syndrome (CRS) after a single dose 
( 100 g/mL) without obinutuzumab pretreatment (Gpt) had epithelial degeneration/ 
single cell necrosis in the exocrine pancreas and stomach mucosa or erosions in the 
gastrointestinal tract and inflammatory cell infiltrates in some organs. These findings 
were likely secondary to cytokine release or cytokine-induced immune-cell activation.
Gpt resulted in the attenuation of cytokine release allowing at least a 10x higher initial 
dose in cynomolgus monkeys. Administration of a low-dose prior to administering higher 
doses (step-up dosing) also mitigated the dose-limiting cytokine response.
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with 
glofitamab. The available nonclinical and clinical data for glofitamab and the known risks 
associated with anti-CD20 antibodies indicate an overall risk to pregnancy (due to 
cytokine release and/or infections) but a low risk for teratogenicity.
Key safety findings from nonclinical studies and relevance to human usage
•
Cytokine Release Syndrome 
Post-dose clinical signs were observed following the first dose of glofitamab, and 
included emesis, pale skin, decreased activity, and hunched posture. In most cases 
these clinical signs were mild and reversible, except for some animals given an initial 
dose of  100 mg/kg without Gpt, which did not recover and had to be euthanized. 
Clinical signs correlated with high cytokine levels, increased C-reactive protein, bilirubin 
and triglycerides, and decreased albumin and cholesterol, as well as mildly to 
moderately increased fibrinogen, partial thromboplastin time, and activated partial 
thromboplastin time, consistent with an acute phase response. 
Relevance to human usage: Yes
Discussion: The mechanism of action of glofitamab is driven by B cell-dependent T-cell 
activation and subsequent T-cell-mediated B-cell killing. As observed with other CD3 
engagers such as blinatumomab and CAR T-cell therapy, T-cell activation may lead to 
an excess of systemic cytokine release which may lead to serious and even fatal events 
(Blinatumomab United States Product Insert [USPI] and Summary of Product 
Characteristics [SmPC]; Hopfinger 2019). Signs or symptoms of CRS most frequently 
reported ( 5% of patients who experienced CRS of any grade [by American Society for 
Transplantation and Cellular Therapy {ASTCT} 2019 grading] in glofitamab-treated 
patients in the primary safety population) in Study NP30179 include pyrexia, tachycardia, 
hypotension, chills, hypoxia, headache, and nausea (Annex 7B.1). Cytokine release 
syndrome is an important identified risk for glofitamab. Serious and life-threatening CRS 
events occurred in patients treated with glofitamab; however, none were fatal 
(Module SVII.3). The majority of CRS events occurred in the first cycle of glofitamab 
administration, mostly associated either with the Cycle 1 Day 8 or Cycle 1 Day 15 doses.

B cell depletion and hematologic effects
Consistent with the pharmacological mechanism of action, a reduction of B lymphocytes 
as well as activation and expansion of T-cell subsets (memory CD8  naïve 
CD8  CD4  Treg) was observed. Animals dosed with glofitamab had dose-dependent 
decreased cellularity of lymphoid follicles of the spleen, mesenteric, and mandibular 
lymph nodes, correlating immunohistochemically with decreased numbers of CD20+ B 
cells. 
Concurrent with T-cell activation and cytokine release, a transient decrease in total white 
blood cell counts, lymphocytes, neutrophils, monocytes, basophils, and platelets could 
be observed, consistent with immune cell activation, margination, and redistribution. In 
addition, a decrease in red blood cells and an increase in reticulocytes was evident.
Relevance to human usage: Yes
Discussion: Neutropenia is a known class effect with other CD20-targeted therapies. 
Patients with severe neutropenia have an increased risk of infection. Neutropenia has 
been very commonly reported as an adverse drug reaction in patients treated with 
glofitamab, which may be attributed to the mechanism of action of glofitamab. 
Neutropenia is clinically manageable and reversible with Granulocyte Colony Stimulating 
Factor use. Neutropenia is an identified risk for glofitamab (Module SVII.1).
•
Cardiovascular effects
Administration of glofitamab was associated with sustained dose-dependent increases in 
heart rate (beginning as early as 30 minutes post dose up to 20 hours post dose) and 
body temperature in nonhuman primates. These findings are consistent with cytokine 
release and acute phase reactions. There was no effect of glofitamab administration on 
QRS duration or QTc interval.
Relevance to human usage: Yes
Discussion: Hypotension and tachycardia have been reported as symptoms of CRS in 
patients treated with glofitamab. In Study NP30179, among patients in the primary safety 
population who received at least one dose of glofitamab and had at least one post-
baseline QTcF value (N  141), 125 patients (88.7%) had maximum QTcF values post-
baseline  450 ms. Thirteen patients (9.2%) had post-baseline QTcF values  450 ms -
 480 ms, 1 patient (0.7%) had post-baseline QTcF values   480 ms -  500 ms, and 2 
patients (1.4%) had a post-baseline QTcF value  500 ms. (Annex 7B.2, Annex 7B.3). 
All but one of the post-baseline QTcF values >450 ms were assessed as not of clinical 
significance by the investigator. The one patient with a clinically significant post-baseline 
QTcF value had heavily confounding factors at baseline and immediately prior to the 
QTcF being reported.

Systemic inflammatory cell infiltration

1770
Mononuclear cell infiltrates in some organs (heart, salivary gland, kidney, perivascular 
spaces of meninges, choroid plexus, and parenchyma of the brain - some with minimal 
gliosis) were increased in incidence among glofitamab-dosed animals as compared to 
controls. 
Histopathological changes associated with the modality (independent of the tumor 
associated antigen) are mononuclear or mixed cell infiltrates, which may occur in any 
tissue (Saber et al., 2017; Kamperschroer et al., 2020).
Animals with very high levels of proinflammatory cytokines following doses 100 g/kg 
without Gpt had epithelial degeneration/ single cell necrosis in the exocrine pancreas 
and stomach mucosa or erosions in the gastrointestinal tract and mixed-cell and/or 
neutrophilic infiltrates in the spleen, sinusoids of the liver and sporadically in some other
organs including lung interstitium, choroid plexus, and adrenal gland. 
Relevance to human usage: Yes
Discussion: Described or characterized by data from CD19-directed CAR-T therapies, 
symptoms of immune effector cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) include 
tremor, dysgraphia, expressive aphasia, impaired attention, and apraxia (Lee et al. 
2019). The etiology of toxicity in these settings is not well known and may not be 
responsive to cytokine-directed therapy such as tocilizumab, but has generally improved 
with treatment discontinuations and corticosteroids (Kochenderfer et al. 2015). 
Endoscopy biopsy of the colon revealed T-cell infiltration and lymphangiectasis in a
patient treated with glofitamab from Study NP30179.
Neurologic adverse events (defined as Preferred Terms [PTs] in MedDRA System 
Organ Classes [SOCs] Nervous system disorders and Psychiatric disorders) have 
occurred in patients treated with glofitamab. Neurologic adverse events are considered a 
potential risk for glofitamab. Colitis has also been observed in Study NP30179
(Module SVII.1)

Reproductive/developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have not been conducted with 
glofitamab. A risk assessment for embryofetal development has been performed, using a 
weight-of-evidence approach. Based on a low placental transfer of antibodies during the 
first trimester, the mechanism of action and available nonclinical and clinical data, and 
available data on the anti-CD20 antibody class, the risk for teratogenicity is low. 
Prolonged B-cell depletion can lead to increased risk of opportunistic infection, which 
may cause fetal loss (obinutuzumab [Gazyvaro] SmPC ocrelizumab [Ocrevus] SmPC,
rituximab [MabThera SmPC). Transient cytokine release associated with glofitamab 
administration may also be harmful to pregnancy.

Discussion: No clinical studies have been performed in pregnant women. Women of 
childbearing potential are advised to use highly effective contraception to avoid 
pregnancy while undergoing glofitamab treatment and for at least three months after the 
last dose. Contraception use in male patients receiving glofitamab is not required. No 
pregnancies have been reported in patients treated with glofitamab.
 Genotoxicity
In accordance with the current ICH guidance on the preclinical safety evaluation of 
biotechnology-derived pharmaceuticals (ICH S6(R1) 2011), genotoxicity studies have 
not been conducted with glofitamab. It is not expected that glofitamab would interact 
directly with DNA or other chromosomal material.

Carcinogenicity
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted with glofitamab.
PART II: MODULE SIII CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE
Study NP30179 is a Phase I/II, multicenter, open-label, dose-escalation study evaluating 
the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of glofitamab administered by IV 
infusion as a single agent and in combination with obinutuzumab following pretreatment 
with a fixed dose of obinutuzumab (Gpt) in patients with R/R NHL. Patients with a history 
of a R/R hematologic malignancy that is expected to express the CD20 antigen, 
including DLBCL and follicular lymphoma, are being enrolled. Multiple dosing schedules 
are being explored in Study NP30179 with the goal of minimizing treatment-emergent 
toxicities and maximizing the benefit/risk profile of glofitamab (see Figure 1 and Table 3).
Safety data from Study NP30179 presented in this RMP support the use of glofitamab 
monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with R/R DLBCL, after two or more lines 
of systemic therapy.  
Safety and exposure data in the RMP are presented up to the clinical cut-off date 
(CCOD) of 15 June 2022 from the monotherapy cohorts of Study NP30179 (Figure 1) for 
patients within the populations listed below (R/R DLBCL [patients treated with   2 prior 
lines of systemic therapy], Table 4, and R/R NHL, Table 5) who received at least one

30 mg of glofitamab (Table 12). A summary of the doses for each cohort group is 
appended (Annex 7B.4). The majority of patients who received glofitamab in the primary
safety population received all doses in accordance with the planned dose and cycles;
only 9.0% of patients (13/145 patients) received at least one dose of glofitamab outside 
of the planned cycle or at an unplanned dose level (different from the intended dose)
(Table 14).
Overall Safety Population
Of the patients who received glofitamab in the overall safety population (N  450), 56.0% 
(252/450 patients, 87.9 patient-years of exposure) received the highest dose of 30 mg of 
glofitamab (Table 13). A summary of the doses for each cohort group is appended 
(Annex 7B.5). Of the subgroup of patients in the overall safety population assigned to 
receive glofitamab step-up dosing 2.5/10/30 mg in Cohorts D2 [Sub. 2], D3 and D5 and 
who received at least one dose of glofitamab (N  185), the majority received all doses in 
accordance to the planned dose and cycles; only 15.1% (28/185 patients) received at 
least one dose outside of the planned cycle or at an unplanned dose level Table 15.

PART II: MODULE SVI ADDITIONAL E.U. REQUIREMENTS FOR THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION
POTENTIAL FOR MISUSE FOR ILLEGAL PURPOSES
Drugs that have a potential for misuse for illegal purposes are expected to share general 
characteristics such as psychoactive, stimulant, or sedative effects, or less commonly, 
anabolic effects or enhancement of hemoglobin levels. 
For glofitamab, there is neither nonclinical nor current clinical evidence supporting 
psychostimulatory effects or dependency, which would induce misuse for illegal 
purposes. 
A review of safety information obtained in patients exposed to glofitamab concluded that 
there was no indication of abuse or dependence-related adverse events (AEs).
Therefore, the potential for glofitamab to be misused for illegal purposes is low.
PART II: MODULE SVII IDENTIFIED AND POTENTIAL RISKS
SVII.1 IDENTIFICATION OF SAFETY CONCERNS IN THE INITIAL RMP 
SUBMISSION
SVII.1.1Risks not considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP
Reason for NOT including an identified or potential risk in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP:
Risks with minimal clinical impact on patients (in relation to the severity of the 
indication treated): 

Pyrexia
Pyrexia occurring within 24 hours from administration of glofitamab should be recorded 
as CRS. Pyrexia is an identified risk, and was reported in 23 patients (15.9%) who 
received glofitamab in the primary safety population (N  145); all events were Grade 2
(Annex 7B.9). Pyrexia is common in patients with DLBCL.

Infusion Related Reactions
Infusion related reactions (IRRs) are expected based on experience of other CD20 
agents (Gazyvaro, Polivy, MabThera /Rituxan Summaries of Product Characteristics 
[SmPCs]). For glofitamab, IRRs may be clinically indistinguishable from manifestations 
of CRS. For all events with clinical presentation of IRR/CRS with onset within 24 hours 
from the end of glofitamab infusion (e.g., fever, nausea, chills, headache, hypotension, 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.2 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd

hypoxia or organ toxicity) investigators were instructed to report using the preferred term 
“cytokine release syndrome”, unless no systemic increase of cytokines was detected 
(IRR could be recorded if no systemic increase of cytokines was detected). Therefore,
the number of IRRs reported are minimal.
Among patients in the primary safety population who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab, IRR was reported for 10/145 patients (6.9%); all events were Grade 2 
(Grade 1, 4 patients [2.8%], Grade 2, 6 patients [4.1%]). Of the ten patients with IRRs, 
five experienced IRRs after Gpt and prior to the first glofitamab dose (assessed as 
related to Gpt); the remaining five patients experienced IRRs after glofitamab use (four 
assessed as related to glofitamab). Of the four patients with IRRs related to glofitamab, 
one patient had IRR reported concomitantly with CRS (the same onset date); cytokine 
levels for the other three patients were within normal ranges. These IRRs resolved on 
either the same day or the day after glofitamab use. (Annex 7B.9, Annex 7B.10 ). A 
serious IRR was reported in one patient (the event was not considered related to 
glofitamab but related to Gpt). IRR led to dose modification in one patient (Annex 7B.11, 
Annex 7B.12).

Immunogenicity 
A key immunogenicity risk factor for glofitamab includes its novel bispecific antibody 
structure. Since the expected mechanism of action for glofitamab is to deplete B-cell 
production, it should limit the development of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs). Therefore, the 
overall immunogenicity risk for glofitamab is considered low. A total of 442 patients were 
evaluable for immunogenicity assessment with a baseline sample and at least one post 
dose sample. The majority of patients (418/442 patients [94.6%]) were negative at 
baseline and remained negative on treatment. Nineteen patients (4.3%) had a positive 
ADA sample at baseline and became negative after glofitamab treatment. Three patients 
(0.7%) positive at baseline had at least one subsequent positive ADA sample on 
treatment. Two patients (0.5%) that were negative at baseline, developed ADAs while on 
study, one at Treatment Completion/ET Visit and one at Follow Up till Progression visit 
of 12 months. It is important to note that in both cases the ADA titer was <10 which is 
reported for samples that were screening positive and could be confirmed; however, in 
the titer assay, the value was below the minimum required dilution.
Adverse reactions with clinical consequences, even serious but occurring with a 
low frequency or not occurring, and considered to be acceptable in relation to the 
severity of the indication treated:

Risk of bleeding/ hemorrhage due to thrombocytopenia
A total of 35/145 patients (24.1%) who received at least one dose of glofitamab in the 
primary safety population reported an event under the grouped terms of 
thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased. Thrombocytopenia was reported in 30

patients (20.7%), of whom 22 patients (15.2%) reported Grade 1-2 events and 8 patients
(5.5%) reported Grade 3-4 events. A total of 5 patients (3.4%) reported platelet count 
decreased, of whom 3 patients (2.1%) reported Grade 1-2 events, and 2 patients
reported Grade 3-4 events (Annex 7B.13). Thrombocytopenia (Grade 4) was reported as 
a serious AE in one patient. No platelet count decreased AEs were reported as serious 
(Annex 7B.11). 
In the primary safety population, hemorrhagic events are defined as preferred terms 
from 'Haemorrhagic central nervous system vascular conditions [SMQ]', 'Haemorrhage 
laboratory terms [SMQ]' or 'Haemorrhage terms [excl laboratory terms] [SMQ]’) 
concurrent with thrombocytopenia/platelet count decreased. A hemorrhagic event was 
reported in only one patient (0.7%) (Annex 7B.14) who experienced Grade 4 
gastrointestinal hemorrhage (resolved; treatment received for the AE [octreotide and
RBC transfusions]) concurrent with Grade 1 thrombocytopenia (resolved; no treatment 
received for the AE).

Risk of hepatic injury 
Among patients in the primary safety population who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N145), liver and pancreatic AEs were reported in 18 patients (12.4%); 5 
patients (3.4%) reported events of Grade 3-4 severity (Annex 7B.15). No events were 
reported as serious (Annex 7B.11). One patient reported a liver or pancreatic AE which 
required their glofitamab dose to be interrupted. (Annex 7B.16).
Liver function test (LFT) AEs reported as signs/symptoms concurrently with CRS in
patients who received at least one dose of glofitamab in the primary safety population
were reported in 6/145 patients (4.1%) (Annex 7B.17). Grade 1-2 LFT AEs were 
experienced by 4 patients (2.8%). At the CCOD, Grade 1-2 LFT AEs were unresolved in 
1 patient. Two patients experienced a Grade 3 event; one patient experienced Grade 3 
aspartate amino transferase (AST) increased and one patient experienced Grade 3 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased. At the time of the CCOD, both Grade 3 
events had resolved (Annex 7B.18). One patient in the primary safety population who 
experienced an LFT AE concurrent with CRS, had elevated liver laboratory parameter 
values consistent with a potential Hy’s Law case (Annex 7B.16). 
Analysis of laboratory results identified 6 patients who had received at least one dose of 
glofitamab in the primary safety population as potential Hy’s law cases due to 
corresponding laboratory results  3 x upper limit of normal (ULN) for AST and ALT 
and/or  2 x ULN for total bilirubin. All these potential Hy’s law cases occurred either in 
the context of the reported CRS, or occurred concurrently with disease progression. 
Therefore there were no confirmed Hy’s law cases (Annex 7B.19, Annex 7B.20).


Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis 
No events of suspected hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis were reported in Study 
NP30179 at the time of the CCOD. Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH) is a rare 
condition characterized by inappropriate immune activation and cytokine release. HLH
shares clinical features with severe CRS, and has been reported with blinatumomab as 
well as CAR T-cell therapy (Teachey 2013; Lee et al. 2014; Blinatumomab United States 
Package Insert [USPI] and SmPC). HLH should be included in the differential diagnosis 
for patients who develop a sepsis-like syndrome or severe or prolonged CRS. 
Based on the mechanism of action of glofitamab and data available from the primary 
safety population, HLH is considered a potential risk that will be followed up by routine 
pharmacovigilance.

Colitis
Among patients in the primary safety population who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N145), one patient reported a Grade 4 colitis serious adverse event (SAE). 
The SAE was considered related to glofitamab study treatment by the investigator. The 
time to onset from the first glofitamab dose was 104.0 days (Annex 7B.9, Annex 7B.21). 
There was no interruption to glofitamab study treatment as a result of the event and, at 
the time of the CCOD, the event was ongoing and considered to be resolving/recovering.
A Good Laboratory Practices toxicity study has shown changes in gastrointestinal tract 
(erosions and single cell necrosis) occurred in 3 cynomolgus monkeys following 
100 g/kg of glofitamab (without Gpt) (Module SII). Adverse events of colitis occurred at 
very low frequency in patients exposed to glofitamab and will be followed up by routine 
pharmacovigilance.
Known risks that require no further characterization and are followed up via 
routine pharmacovigilancenamely, through signal detection and adverse 
reaction reportingand for which the risk-minimization messages in the product 
information are adhered by prescribers (e.g., actions being part of standard 
clinical practice in each EU Member state where the product is authorized):

Neutropenia /Febrile Neutropenia
Among patients in the primary safety population who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab, 58 of 145 patients (40.0%) reported at least one neutropenia/neutrophil 
count decreased AE. Grade 3-4 events were reported in 42 (29.0%) patients
(Annex 7B.27). The median time to onset of the first neutropenia AE overall was 
29.0 days (range: 1203) (Annex 7B.28). Neutropenia AEs lasting longer than 30 days 
occurred in 17 patients (11.7%) (Annex 7B.29). 
Among patients in the primary safety population who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab, 14 patients (9.7%) experienced infections concurrent with neutropenia
(infections which started on or after the onset/start date, and before the end date of the 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.2 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd

neutropenia event) (Annex 7B.25). Four patients (2.8%) reported febrile neutropenia, 
including 3 patients (2.1%) with serious febrile neutropenia (Annex 7B.9; Annex 7B.11).
Neutropenia is included in the SmPC Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects.
Known risks that have a low impact on the risk-benefit profile:

Tumor lysis syndrome
Tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) occurred with a low frequency in patients treated with 
glofitamab, i.e., 2 of 145 patients (1.4%) in the primary safety population experienced 
TLS, both reporting Grade 3 events. No Grade 4 events were reported. The time to 
onset from the first glofitamab dose was 2.0 days. At the time of the CCOD, both events 
had resolved (Annex 7B.21).
In the overall safety population among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N  450), Grade  3 TLS was reported by 10 patients (2.2%); 8 patients 
(1.8%) reported a Grade 3 event and 2 patients (0.4%) reported a Grade 4 event 
(Annex 7B.30).
While TLS can be life threatening/fatal, the impact on the benefit-risk balance of 
glofitamab is considered low, since the incidence of severe TLS is low and the risk is 
well characterized, the concept of TLS well understood. Measures to prevent/reduce 
TLS are described in the SmPC Section 4.4 (Warnings and Precautions), and include 
prophylaxis: adequate hydration, premedication with allopurinol or rasburicase per local 
guidelines. TLS is further presented in Section 4.8 (Undesirable Effects). Therefore, the 
known risk of TLS will be followed up via routine pharmacovigilance which, together with 
adherence by prescribers to risk-minimization messages in the product information 
(routine risk minimization measures), are considered sufficient for this risk.
Potential risks that are followed up via routine pharmacovigilance

Neurological adverse events
Neurologic toxicity has been reported frequently with other T-cell engaging therapies 
such as blinatumomab and CAR T-cell therapy. Some of these events were 
life-threatening or fatal (Blincyto [blinatumomab] SmPC and USPI, Maude et al. 2014 
Kochenderfer et al. 2015). The etiology of toxicity in these settings is not well known and 
may not be responsive to cytokine-directed therapy such as tocilizumab, but has 
generally improved with treatment discontinuations and corticosteroids (Blincyto
(blinatumomab SmPC and USPI; Maude et al. 2014; Kochenderfer et al. 2015).
In Study NP30179, neurologic AEs (NAEs) include PTs reported from the Nervous 
system disorders and Psychiatric disorders SOCs. Neurologic AEs (of any grade) were 
reported in 58/145 patients who received at least one dose of glofitamab (40.0%) in the 
primary safety population (Annex 7B.31). Neurologic AEs reported as signs/symptoms 
concurrently with CRS were reported in 10/145 patients (6.9%). 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.2 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
glofitamab
67
of
1770
Seven patients (4.8%) reported Grade 1-2 NAEs concurrently with CRS, and 3 patients 
(2.1%) reported at least one Grade 3 event (Annex 7B.32 ). One patient reported 
Grade 3 somnolence (considered unrelated to study treatment by the investigator), one 
patient reported Grade 4 myelitis (considered related to study treatment by the 
investigator) and one patient had a Grade 5 NAE (delirium; considered unrelated to 
study treatment by the investigator). At the time of the CCOD, NAEs concurrent with 
CRS were resolved in the majority of patients; in 4 patients events were ongoing 
(myelitis, muscular weakness, hyperventilation and somnolence in the same patient, and 
peripheral neuropathy).
A similar frequency of neurologic AEs of any grade (40.9%) was reported in patients who 
received at least one dose of glofitamab in the overall safety population, as compared to 
the primary safety population (Annex 7B.33).
NAEs consistent with ICANS event rates (non-concurrent and concurrent with CRS) are 
generally low, and the majority were Grade 1-2 and considered unrelated to glofitamab 
study treatment. NAEs consistent with ICANS events concurrent to CRS also occurred 
infrequently (2.8%) in the primary safety population, mainly in the first cycle of glofitamab 
treatment (Annex 7B.34). 
Considering the low frequency of NAEs consistent with ICANS events and the fact that 
the CAR-T-cell-therapy-associated toxicity 10-point (CARTOX10) and immune effector-
cell encephalopathy (ICE) scoring systems were not used in Study NP30179, the 
neurological adverse events with PTs reported from the nervous system disorders and 
psychiatric disorders SOCs above represent a more appropriate characterization of the 
adverse events.
Despite the total frequency of NAEs, events that were Grade 3 or higher were reported 
in 1.4% of patients. This risk is considered to have minimal clinical impact on patients (in 
relation to the severity of the indication treated). NAEs such as headache, somnolence, 
tremor, confusional state and myelitis are included in Section 4.8 of SmPC. Therefore, 
NAE is considered a potential risk for glofitamab that will be followed up by routine 
pharmacovigilance.
SVII.1.2Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety 
concerns in the RMP
Important Identified Risk of Cytokine Release Syndrome
Risk-benefit impact: 
The mechanism of action of glofitamab is driven by T-cell activation against 
CD20-expressing cells. T-cell activation may lead to an excess of systemic cytokine 
release from cells targeted by antibodies, immune effector cells recruited to the tumor 
area and the subject’s immune cells activated during this process.
In the primary safety population, 98 of 145 patients (67.6%) who received at least one 
dose of glofitamab experienced a total of 168 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) events, 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.2 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
glofitamab

1770
on the basis of ASTCT 2019 grading criteria (Lee et al. 2019) (Table 22). The majority of 
patients with CRS had events of Grade 1 as the maximum grade (50.3% of patients), 
which were fever with/without constitutional symptoms. Grade 2 CRS was reported in 
13.1% of patients, Grade 3 CRS in 2.8%, and Grade 4 CRS in 1.4%. There were no 
Grade 5 CRS events. All CRS events except one ASTCT Grade 4 event had resolved at 
the CCOD (the patient died due to progressive disease with CRS still ongoing at time of 
death). One patient had glofitamab treatment withdrawn and one patient interrupted 
glofitamab treatment due to a CRS event (0.7% each). 
In the primary safety population among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N  145), the vast majority of CRS events resolved with appropriate 
management, including use of tocilizumab (31/98 patients with CRS; 31.6%), 
corticosteroids (28.6%), tocilizumab and corticosteroids (16.3%), and oxygen (10.2%). 
Rates of intensive care unit (ICU) admission were low (7/99 patients with CRS; 7.1%) 
and no patient required the use of multiple pressors (Annex 7B.35).
Grade ≥2 CRS was reported in 17.2% of patients and the frequency of Grade 3-4 CRS 
was low (4.1%); however, due to the potential impact of higher grade CRS events on the 
benefit-risk balance of glofitamab, appropriate comprehensive labeling and patient 
educational materials as a risk-minimization activity are proposed to increase the 
likelihood of an early diagnosis of CRS followed by appropriate treatment.
In glofitamab-treated patients who received dexamethasone premedication (n=39) 
versus another glucocorticoid premedication (n=106), CRS of any grade occurred in 
48.7% vs. 56.6% of patients, Grade 1 CRS in 38.5% vs 43.4% of patients, Grade 2 CRS 
in 7.7% vs 9.4% of patients, Grade 3 CRS in 2.6% vs 1.9% of patients and Grade 4 CRS 
in 0% vs 1.9% of patients after the 2.5 mg dose of glofitamab at Cycle 1 Day 8. After the 
10 mg dose at Cycle 1 Day 15 (n=36 for dexamethasone premedication, n=99 for 
another glucocorticoid premedication), any grade CRS occurred in 22.2% vs 37.4% of 
patients, Grade 1 CRS in 22.2% vs 30.3% of patients, Grade 2 CRS in 0% vs 6.1% of 
patients and Grade 3 CRS in 0% vs 1% of patients. After the 30 mg dose at Cycle 2 Day 
1 (n=32 for dexamethasone premedication, n=95 for another glucocorticoid 
premedication) any grade CRS occurred in 6.3% vs 33.7% of patients, Grade 1 CRS in 
6.3% vs 32.6% of patients, and Grade 2 CRS in 0% vs 1.1% of patients (Annexes 7B.36, 
7B.37, 7B.38). 
Important Identified Risk of Tumor Flare
Risk-benefit impact: 
Tumor flare (TF) is likely due to the influx of T-cells into tumor sites following glofitamab 
administration. Manifestations include localized pain at sites of lymphoma lesions, and 
possible volumetric increase of lymphoma lesions leading to local compression and 
accompanying organ dysfunction.
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.2 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
glofitamab
69

1770
As of the 15 June 22 CCOD, seventeen patients (11.7%) experienced any grade TF in 
the primary safety population among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N145) (Table 26). Eleven patients (7.6%) experienced 11 events of Grade 
2 TF (Annex 7B.21). All 11 events were assessed as related to glofitamab by the 
investigator (Annex 7B.10); 7 patients (4.8%) had Grade 2 events and 4 patients (2.8%) 
had Grade 3 events. Most of the events of tumor flare occurred in the inguinal node and 
maxillary lymph node and were associated with/characterized by localized pain, swelling, 
and worsening pleural effusion. 
Among the 6 patients with Grade 1 tumor flare, 3 patients received treatment with 
analgesics, and no treatment was reported for the remaining 3 patients with Grade 1 
tumor flare; all patients recovered from this event at CCOD (Annex 7B.39)
Among the 11 patients with Grade  2 tumor flare, 9 patients received treatment. Of the 
9 patients who received treatment, 2 patients received analgesics only, 6 patients 
received corticosteroids and analgesics including morphine derivatives, and 1 patient 
received corticosteroids and anti-emetics as treatment. Two Grade  2 events did not 
require treatment. None of the patients who experienced tumor flare needed prophylactic 
intubation for safe administration of glofitamab due to the critical location of their 
lymphoma (as recommended in Study NP30179 protocol, v11.0). At the 15 June 2022 
CCOD, Grade  2 tumor flare events were resolved in 10 of the 11 patients.
None of the TF events led to withdrawal of glofitamab treatment or dose interruption. 
One patient required the glofitamab dose to be modified due to TF events. Overall, the 
median time to onset of ‘any grade’ TF was 2.00 days (range: 1.0-16.0 days). The 
median duration of TF was 3.50 days (range: 1.0 – 35.0) (Annex 7B.40).
Considering the low incidence of TF events, and that the majority of events resolved 
without glofitamab treatment modification, the impact on the benefit-risk profile is 
considered to be minimal. However, there is a potential for clinically significant impact 
based on anatomical site of lesions secondary to mass effect. Patients with bulky tumors 
located in close proximity to airways and/or a vital organ are at heightened risk, of which 
prescribers should be warned. Therefore, TF represents an important identified risk for 
glofitamab. Appropriate comprehensive labeling and prescriber educational materials as 
a risk-minimization activity, increase the likelihood of early recognition and allow
planning for mitigations in patients with tumors at critical anatomic locations, reducing 
the impact of TF on the benefit-risk balance of the glofitamab.
Important Identified Risk of Serious Infections
Risk-benefit impact:
In the primary safety population among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N145), adverse events from the grouped terms of infections and infestation
were reported in 57 patients (39.3%) (Annex 7B.22). The median time to onset of the 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.2 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
glofitamab
70
of
1770
first infection and infestation event from the first glofitamab dose (Cycle1 Day 8) was 
5.0 days (range: 2.015.0), and the median duration of the first infection and infestation 
AE from the first glofitamab dose (Cycle 1 Day 8) was 6.0 days (range: 3.059.0) 
(Annex 7B.23). 
Under the grouped terms of infections and infestations AEs, 23 patients (15.9%) 
reported SAEs. The SAEs reported in  2% patients were sepsis (6 patients [4.1%]), 
COVID-19 (5 patients [3.4%]), and COVID-19 pneumonia (4 patients [2.8%]). Grade 1-2 
SAEs were reported in 3 patients (2.1%), Grade 3-4 SAEs in 13 patients (9.0%), and 
Grade 5 SAEs in 7 patients (4.8%) (Annex 7B.11). Serious AEs related to glofitamab 
were reported in four patients (2.8%) (Annex 7B.24). No Grade 5 AEs were considered 
related to glofitamab treatment. Four patients (2.8%) reported a serious infection 
concurrent with Grade 34 neutropenia (Annex 7B.25).
In the overall safety population among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N  450), AEs in the Infections and infestations SOC were reported in 45.6% 
of patients (Annex 7B.26).
Due to its anticipated mode of action (MoA) resulting in profound B-cell depletion,
glofitamab may be associated with an increased risk of infections. Infections have been 
reported in other CD20 directed therapies. The concept of serious infections is well 
understood with oncology treatments. Although the risk is expected/known due to MoA, 
some infections could be life threatening and/or fatal. Consequently, serious infections 
has been discussed and presented in SmPC Section 4.4 Warning and Precautions, and 
further presented in Section 4.8 Undesirable Effects. Patients with a history of chronic or 
recurrent infection or those who have conditions or had treatment that may predispose 
them to infections should be monitored before and during glofitamab treatment for the 
emergence of new or reactivated infections. Therefore, the known risk of infections will 
be followed up via routine pharmacovigilance which, together with adherence by 
prescribers to risk-minimization messages in the product information (routine risk
minimization measures), are considered sufficient for this risk.
Important Potential Risks

Missing Information of Long-term safety
Risk-benefit impact:
At the 15 June 2022 CCOD, all patients in the primary safety population had either 
completed initial study treatment or had discontinued initial study treatment. Median 
duration of follow-up for patients in the primary safety population who had received at 
least one dose of glofitamab was 13.5 months (range: 028 months) (Annex 7B.45).
Limited data are available in terms of long-term safety of patients treated with
glofitamab; long-term safety is therefore considered missing information. Long-term

safety data is being collected from the ongoing NP30179 study that is included as an 
additional pharmacovigilance activity for long-term safety. To address this missing 
information, a minimum of two years follow-up from the end of treatment of the last 
patient enrolled in the primary safety population of Study NP30179, including an analysis 
of safety by sex shall be provided.  
Missing Information of Safety in Patients with Prior CAR-T Therapy
Risk-benefit impact:
Based on the 15 June 2022 CCOD, among patients in the primary safety population who 
had received at least one dose of glofitamab (N145), more patients had not received 
prior CAR-T therapy (N98 [67.6%]) compared to patients who had received prior CAR-
T therapy (N47 [32.4%]).
Serious AEs were reported in a higher proportion of patients who previously received 
CAR-T therapy compared with those who had not (55.3% vs. 44.9%; Annex 7B.41). 
Conversely, in patients who had not received prior CAR-T therapy compared to those 
who had, a higher proportion of patients reported AEs leading to dose 
modification/interruption (21.4% vs. 12.8%). However, the difference in the sample sizes 
of these subgroups could potentially be a reason for the observed imbalances. The 
incidence of Grade 3-5 AEs was comparable across both groups (65.3% in patients who 
had not received prior CAR-T therapy vs. 61.7% in those who had) and there were 
similar rates of CRS (65.3% in patients who had not received prior CAR-T therapy vs. 
72.3% in those who had).
Characterization of the safety profile of patients with prior CAR-T therapy is limited and
is therefore considered missing information. Analysis of future safety information in this 
patient population in Study NP30179, as an additional pharmacovigilance activity, is 
planned.

CAR T-cell therapy, T-cell activation may lead to an excess of systemic cytokine
release which may lead to serious and even fatal events (Blincyto [blinatumomab]
SmPC and USPI; Hopfinger 2019).
Characterization of the risk:
Overview of CRS by ASTCT 2019 Grading Criteria
 Primary safety population
In the primary safety population, 98 of 145 patients (67.6%) who received at least one 
dose of glofitamab experienced a total of 168 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) events 
(Table 22), on the basis of ASTCT 2019 grading criteria (Lee et al. 2019). The majority 
of patients with CRS had events of Grade 1 maximum severity (50.3% of patients), 
which were fever with/without constitutional symptoms. Grade 2 CRS was reported in 
13.1% of patients, Grade 3 CRS in 4 patients (2.8%), and Grade 4 CRS in 2 patients 
(1.4%). There were no Grade 5 CRS events. Of a total of 168 CRS events, all were 
considered related to glofitamab. At least one serious event of CRS was experienced by
32 patients (22.1%). All CRS events except one ASTCT Grade 4 event had resolved at 
the CCOD (the patient died due to progressive disease with CRS still ongoing at time of 
death). One patient had glofitamab treatment withdrawn and one patient had glofitamab 
treatment interrupted due to a glofitamab-related CRS event (0.7% each). 
In the subpopulations comprising the primary safety population among patients who 
received at least one dose of glofitamab, i.e., patients with R/R DLBCL with  2 prior 
therapies who received 2.5/10/30 mg step-up dosing in Part II Cohort D2 [Sub. 2] and 
Part III Cohort D3 (N108), and in Part III Cohort D3 (N101), the profile of CRS events 
was consistent with the primary safety population (Table 22). However, at the CCOD, 
patients in Cohort D5 showed a trend to reduction in the incidence of all grade and 
Grade  2 CRS with each glofitamab step-up dose, as compared to patients in Cohort D3
(Annexes 7B.42 and 7B.43).
Premedication with corticosteroids prior to glofitamab was mandatory for all patients in 
the study. In Cohort D5, dexamethasone was pre-specified per protocol while in the other 
cohorts, the type of corticosteroid was at the discretion of the investigator who had the

option to use any of the following agents: methylprednisolone, prednisone or 
dexamethasone.
In patients who received dexamethasone premedication (n=39) versus another 
glucocorticoid premedication (n=106), CRS of any grade occurred in 48.7% vs. 56.6% of 
patients, Grade 1 CRS in 38.5% vs 43.4% of patients, Grade 2 CRS in 7.7% vs 9.4% of 
patients, Grade 3 CRS in 2.6% vs 1.9% of patients and Grade 4 CRS in 0% vs 1.9% of 
patients after the 2.5 mg dose of glofitamab at Cycle 1 Day 8. After the 10 mg dose at 
Cycle 1 Day 15 (n=36 for dexamethasone premedication, n=99 for another 
glucocorticoid premedication), any grade CRS occurred in 22.2% vs 37.4% of patients, 
Grade 1 CRS in 22.2% vs 30.3% of patients, Grade 2 CRS in 0% vs 6.1% of patients 
and Grade 3 CRS in 0% vs 1% of patients. After the 30 mg dose at Cycle 2 Day 1 (n=32 
for dexamethasone premedication, n=95 for another glucocorticoid premedication) any 
grade CRS occurred in 6.3% vs 33.7% of patients, Grade 1 CRS in 6.3% vs 32.6% of 
patients, and Grade 2 CRS in 0% vs 1.1% of patients (Annexes 7B.36, 7B.37, 7B.38) .
 Overall safety population
In the overall safety population, among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N=450), CRS events of any grade were reported in 299 patients (66.4%) by 
ASTCT 2019 grading (Table 23). The majority of patients who reported CRS had events 
of Grade 1-2 maximum severity by ASTCT 2019 grading (275 patients [61.1%]). Grade 
34 CRS AEs were reported in 24 patients (5.3%). No Grade 5 CRS AEs were reported. 
Of a total of 522 CRS events, 516 were considered related to glofitamab. At least one 
serious event of CRS was experienced by 146 patients (32.4%). Only one patient had 
glofitamab treatment withdrawn due to a glofitamab-related CRS event. Glofitamab-
related CRS events led to dose modification/interruption in 15 (3.3%) patients. At the 
time of the CCOD, 3 patients had CRS events that had not resolved.
In the subgroup of patients with R/R NHL treated with glofitamab step-up dosing
2.5/10/30 mg in Cohort D3, Cohort D2 [Sub. 2] and Cohort D5 (N185), the CRS profile 
was generally consistent with the overall safety population.

CRS events by Dose Cycle 
In the primary safety population among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab, CRS events occurred predominantly in Cycle 1 and were mainly associated 
with Day 8 and Day 15 dose administrations, with a higher frequency of CRS of any 
grade observed following the Day 8 (2.5 mg) dose (79 of 145 patients who received the 
Day 8 dose [54.5%]) compared with the Day 15 (10 mg) dose (45 of 135 patients who 
received the Day 15 dose, [33.3%]) (Table 24). CRS events occurred less frequently in 
Cycle 2 (34 of 127 patients who received glofitamab doses in Cycle 2 [26.8%]), and 
infrequently in Cycle 3 and beyond (3 of 107 patients who received glofitamab doses in 
Cycle 3 and beyond [2.8%]). Serious CRS events also occurred predominantly in Cycle 
1, with a higher frequency observed following the Day 8 (2.5 mg) dose (21 of 145 
patients who received the Day 8 dose [14.5%]) compared with the Day 15 (10 mg) dose 
(9 of 135 patients who received the Day 15 dose [6.7%]) (Table 24). Nine of 127 patients 
who received glofitamab doses in Cycle 2 (7.1%) and 2 of 107 patients who received 
glofitamab doses in Cycle 3 and beyond (1.9%) experienced serious CRS events. 
Glofitamab-related CRS events leading to withdrawal of glofitamab treatment occurred 
only following the Cycle 1 Day 8 dose (1 patient). Glofitamab-related CRS events 
leading to dose interruption were observed only following the Cycle 1 Day 15 dose (1 
patient). 
Similar results were observed in patients from all NHL histologies who received at least 
one dose of glofitamab and were treated at the proposed registrational dose (2.5/10/30 
mg) in Cohort D3, Cohort D2 [Sub. 2], and Cohort D5 (N  185) (Table 25).
Note that CRS events by dose cycle have not been shown for the 0.6 mg and 10 mg 
cohorts that combine groups with fixed and step-up dosing regimens. As fixed dosing 
regimens are not given on the same cycle days as step-up dosing, combined data is not 
an accurate description of the CRS event.  
Risk factors and risk groups:
The risk of CRS may be influenced by factors related to the type of therapy and 
treatment dose, the underlying disease (type, tumor burden, and tumor cell location 
[e.g., peripheral blood vs. bone marrow]), patient characteristics (age, general health 
status, and comorbidity burden; basal inflammatory state), and degree of T-cell 
activation and expansion (Shimabukuro-Vornhagen et al. 2018, Wang and Han 2018). 
Disease burden is among the most important predictors of severe CRS after CAR T-cell 
therapy and the bispecific T-cell engager blinatumomab (Teachey et al. 2016; Topp et al. 
2015). 
Preventability:
To reduce the occurrence of CRS with glofitamab use, patients must be pretreated with 
obinutuzumab seven days prior to initiation of glofitamab step-up dosing, and should be

premedicated with an anti-pyretic, antihistamine, and a glucocorticoid. As described in 
the SmPC (section 4.2), all patients must be monitored for signs and symptoms of 
potential CRS during infusion and for at least 10 hours after completion of the infusion of 
the first glofitamab dose (2.5 mg on Cycle 1 Day 8). Patients who experienced Grade 2 
CRS with their previous infusion should be monitored after completion of the infusion.
Data on the time to CRS onset of Grade 2 CRS following 10 mg and 30 mg doses is 
provided in the SmPC (section 4.8) to inform prescribers.
Healthcare professionals (HCPs) should have immediate on-site access to tocilizumab. 
At least one dose of tocilizumab must be available prior to glofitamab infusion for use in 
the event of CRS. Access to an additional dose of tocilizumab within 8 hours of each 
previous tocilizumab dose must be ensured.
All patients must be given a Patient Card (Table 41), counselled on the risk and signs 
and symptoms of CRS, and advised to contact the healthcare provider immediately,
should they experience signs and symptoms of CRS.
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
CRS events have been manageable and reversible with supportive measures. The 
impact on benefit/risk balance is considered low. Grade 2 events require medical 
intervention. Grade 3 CRS events require hospitalization for more aggressive 
treatment, and patients may need ICU admission. The impact on the benefit/risk balance 
might be considered significant for Grade 2 CRS.
The majority of CRS events were of Grade 1-2 intensity and resolved with appropriate 
management. Although the frequency of severe and life-threatening CRS events of 
Grade 3-4 intensity was low, the impact on the benefit-risk balance of glofitamab may 
differ depending on the grade and severity of CRS. Guidance regarding premedication, 
careful monitoring, and management provided in the product label reduce the risk of 
CRS.
In addition to comprehensive product labeling, additional risk-minimization measures 
include educational material for patients in the form of a Patient Card. These measures, 
together with routine pharmacovigilance activities and the survey for prescribers to 
measure effectiveness of additional risk minimization measures, are considered 
adequate to manage the risk of CRS.
Public health impact:
No public health impact is envisaged in view of the population treated and the limitations 
placed upon administration of glofitamab by virtue of the warnings and precautions and 
dosage instructions in the product label. Use outside of controlled environments by 
non-healthcare professionals is not anticipated.

Tumor Flare
Potential mechanisms:
Adverse events associated with TF have been reported with some anti-cancer therapies 
(e.g. immunomodulating agents, T-cell engaging therapies, checkpoint inhibitors), where 
the mechanism of action that includes redirecting the immune response towards tumor
killing results in the activation and trafficking of immune cells to tumor sites. Tumor flare 
is a phenomenon whereby symptoms present due to effects of influx of immune cells in 
response to treatment with glofitamab. Tumor pseudoprogression is primarily a 
radiological diagnosis, in contrast to the clinical manifestations with relatively short onset 
and duration that characterize tumor flare (Taleb 2019). Manifestations of tumor flare 
include localized pain at sites of lymphoma lesions, and possible volumetric increase of 
lymphoma lesions leading to local compression and accompanying organ dysfunction. 
Patients with tumors at critical anatomic locations should be closely monitored for TF, 
and considerations dependent on the anatomic locations of lymphoma lesions need to 
be applied and specific mitigations planned with collaboration of multidisciplinary teams.
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:
Tumor flare has been observed in clinical data (Study NP30179) with glofitamab. It is a 
known risk with other immunomodulating agents, T-cell engaging therapies, checkpoint 
inhibitor therapies (Taleb 2019).
Characterization of the risk:
Overview of Tumor Flare Events

Primary safety population
Seventeen patients (11.7%) experienced any grade TF among patients in the primary 
safety population who received at least one dose of glofitamab (N145) (Table 26). 
Eleven patients (7.6%) experienced 11 events of Grade 2 TF (Annex 7B.21). All 11 
events were assessed as related to study treatment by the investigator (Annex 7B.10); 
7 patients (4.8%) had Grade 2 events and 4 patients (2.8%) had Grade 3 events. Tumor 
flare events resolved in the majority of patients (94.1%); in one patient, events were
unresolved at the time of reporting. None of the TF events led to withdrawal of 
glofitamab treatment or dose interruption. One patient required the glofitamab dose to be 
modified due to TF events. Overall, the median time to onset of any grade tumor flare 
was 2.0 days (range: 1.0-16.0 days). The median duration of tumor flare was 3.5 days 
(range: 1.0 – 35.0) (Annex 7B.40).
Tumor flare was reported involving lymph nodes in the head and neck presenting with 
pain, and involving lymph nodes in the thorax with symptoms of breathlessness due to 
development of pleural effusion.

 Overall safety population
In the overall safety population, among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N  450), TF events of any grade were reported in 44 patients (9.8%) 
(Table 27). The majority of patients who reported TF had events of Grade 1-2 maximum 
severity (34 patients [7.6%]). Grade 3 TF AEs were reported in 10 patients (2.2%). No 
Grade 4 or Grade 5 TF AEs were reported. Of a total of 53 TF events, 51 were 
considered related to glofitamab, as assessed by the investigator. At least one SAE was 
experienced by 10 patients (2.2%). At the time of the CCOD, two patients (4.5%) had TF
events that had not resolved. 
In the subgroup of patients treated with glofitamab step-up dosing 2.5/10/30 mg in 
Cohort D3, Cohort D2 [Sub. 2], and Cohort D5 from all histologies (N185), frequencies of 
tumor flare events and serious tumor flare events were comparable with the overall 
safety population.
Tumor Flare Events by Dose Cycle
In the primary safety population, among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N145), TF events occurred predominantly in Cycle 1. Tumor flare was
mainly associated with Day 8 dose administrations, with 13 of 145 patients who received 
a glofitamab dose at Day 8 (9.0%) reporting TF events of any grade following the Day 8 
dose (2.5 mg) compared with 3 of 135 patients who received a glofitamab dose at Day 
15 (2.2%) reporting events following the Day 15 (10 mg) dose (Table 28). Tumor flare
events occurred infrequently in Cycle 2 (3 of 127 patients who received glofitamab doses 
in Cycle 2 [2.4%]) and were not observed in Cycle 3 and beyond. Serious TF events 
occurred only in Cycle 1, with 4 of 145 patients who received a glofitamab dose at Day 8 
(2.8%) reporting serious TF events of any grade following the Day 8 dose (2.5 mg) 
compared with 1 of 135 patients who received a glofitamab dose at Day 15 (0.7%) 
reporting serious events following the Day 15 (10 mg) dose. Tumor flare events leading 
to dose modification occurred only following the Cycle 1 Day 8 dose (1 patient). 
Similar results were observed in patients from all R/R NHL histologies treated at the 
proposed registrational dose (2.5/10/30 mg) in Cohort D3, Cohort D2 [Sub. 2], and Cohort
D5 (Table 29). 
Note that tumor flare events by dose cycle have not been shown for the 0.6 mg and 
10 mg cohorts that combine groups with fixed and step-up dosing regimens. As fixed 
dosing regimens are not given on the same cycle days as step-up dosing, combined 
data is not an accurate description of the TF event.
Risk factors and risk groups:
Treatment with immunomodulatory agents is associated with TF, and more frequent with 
hematologic malignancies than in patients with solid tumors (Taleb 2019).

Preventability:
Patients with tumors at critical anatomic locations should be closely monitored for tumor 
flare, and considerations dependent on the anatomic locations of lymphoma lesions 
need to be applied and specific mitigations planned with collaboration of multidisciplinary 
teams. Depending on the nature of the tumor inflammation, further medical and/or 
surgical management may be necessary (e.g., anti-inflammatory agents, airway 
management, decompression, prolonged hospitalization, etc.). Important differential 
diagnosis needs to be made with disease progression. 
In Study NP30179, tumor flare was broadly managed with simple interventions, including 
events that resolved without any treatment, and no patients had prophylactic intubation 
for safe administration of glofitamab. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC provides monitoring and management advice for tumor flare,
and Section 4.8 provides a description of tumor flare to reduce the potential for negative 
outcomes in patients experiencing the event. Additionally, the Applicant proposes to 
provide supplementary information in the HCP brochure to further increase awareness 
around tumor flare.
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
Based on safety data collected, TF associated with glofitamab administration has
manifested as new or worsening pleural effusions, and localized pain and swelling at 
sites of lymphoma lesions. Considering the low incidence of TF events, and that the 
majority of events resolved without glofitamab treatment modification, the impact on 
benefit/risk balance is considered to be minimal. 
To enhance the early recognition and management of TF, additional risk-minimization 
measures include educational material in the form of a HCP brochure, and the SmPC 
provides comprehensive guidance for patient management of TF. These measures are 
considered adequate to manage the risk.
Public health impact:
Given the low frequency of serious events, coupled with the responsiveness to TF
management, the impact of TF on public health is considered to be low.

Serious Infections
Potential mechanisms:
The mechanism of action of glofitamab results in B-cell depletion, which is associated 
with an increased risk of infections. Infections have been reported in patients receiving 
other CD20-directed therapies. Serious, life-threatening, and fatal infections occurred in 
patients receiving glofitamab, and contributory factors may include glofitamab-induced 
B
cell depletion, as well as the patient’s immunocompromised status due to the 
underlying disease, and prior immunosuppressive treatment that may predispose to 
infections.
-
Evidence source(s) and strength of evidence:
Serious infections have been observed in clinical data (Study NP30179) with glofitamab.
Characterization of the risk:
Overview of Serious Infections 

Primary safety population
In the primary safety population among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N145), adverse events from the grouped terms of infections and infestation 
were reported in 57 patients (39.3%) (Annex 7B.22). The median time to onset of the 
first infection and infestation event from the first glofitamab dose (Cycle1 Day 8) was 
5.0 days (range: 2.015.0), and the median duration of the first infection and infestation 
AE from the first glofitamab dose (Cycle 1 Day 8) was 6.0 days (range: 3.059.0) 
(Annex 7B.23). 
Under the grouped terms of infections and infestations AEs, 23 patients (15.9%) 
reported SAEs. The SAEs reported in  2% patients were sepsis (6 patients [4.1%]), 
COVID-19 (5 patients [3.4%]), and COVID-19 pneumonia (4 patients [2.8%]). Grade 1-2 
SAEs were reported in 3 patients (2.1%), Grade 3-4 SAEs in 13 patients (9.0%), and 
Grade 5 SAEs in 7 patients (4.8%) (Annex 7B.11). Serious AEs related to glofitamab 
were reported in four patients (2.8%) (Annex 7B.24). No Grade 5 AEs were considered 
related to glofitamab treatment. Four patients (2.8%) reported a serious infection 
concurrent with Grade 34 neutropenia (Annex 7B.25). Serious infection and infestation 
events resolved in the majority of patients (69.6%); in two patients, events were 
unresolved at the time of reporting and seven patients experienced fatal events. One 
patient had treatment withdrawn and one patient interrupted glofitamab treatment due to
glofitamab-related serious infection and infestation events, that were myelitis and 
peritonitis, respectively.

 Overall safety population 
In the overall safety population among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N  450), AEs in the Infections and infestations SOC were reported in 205 
patients (45.6%) (Annex 7B.26); 79 patients (17.6%) reported SAEs. Most patients with 
infection and infestation SAEs had Grade 3 events (47 patients [10.4%]); Grade 4 SAEs 
were reported in 6 patients (1.3%) and Grade 5 in 13 patients (2.9%). The SAEs 
reported in  1% of patients included: COVID-19 (11 patients [2.4%]), pneumonia (10 
patients [2.2%]), COVID-19 pneumonia (9 patients [2.0%]), and sepsis (7 patients 
[1.6%]) (Annex 7B.46). Only one patient had treatment withdrawn due to a glofitamab-
related SAE (Table 30). Glofitamab-related SAEs led to dose interruption in 5 patients
(1.1%). At the time of the CCOD, 6 patients had SAEs that had not resolved. 
In the subgroup of patients with R/R NHL treated with glofitamab step-up dosing 
2.5/10/30 mg in Cohort D3, Cohort D2 [Sub. 2] and Cohort D5 (N185), the profile of 
infection and infestation SAEs was generally consistent with the overall safety population
(Table 31).
Serious Infections by Dose Cycle
In the primary safety population, among patients who received at least one dose of 
glofitamab (N145), infection and infestation SAEs occurred predominantly in Cycle 3 
and beyond. Of 107 patients who received glofitamab doses in Cycle 3 and beyond, 11 
patients (10.3%) reported infection and infestation SAEs. In Cycle 1, of 145 patients who 
received a glofitamab dose at Day 8 (2.5 mg), 4 patients (2.8%) reported infection and 
infestation SAEs following the Day 8 dose; of 135 patients who received a glofitamab 
dose at Day 15 (10 mg), 4 patients (3.0%) reported infection and infestation SAEs 
following the Day 15 dose. Among 127 patients who received glofitamab doses in Cycle 
2, 3 patients (2.4%) reported infection and infestation SAEs (Table 32). 
Similar results were observed in patients from all R/R NHL histologies treated with 
glofitamab at the proposed registrational dose (2.5/10/30 mg) in Cohort D3, Cohort D2
[Sub. 2], and Cohort D5 (Table 33).
Note that infection and infestation SAEs by dose cycle have not been shown for the 0.6 
mg and 10mg cohorts that combine groups with fixed and step-up dosing regimens. As 
fixed dosing regimens are not given on the same cycle days as step-up dosing, 
combined data is not an accurate description of the infection and infestation event.
Risk factors and risk groups:
Serious infections is a recognized risk associated with B-cell depletion treatment effect 
and a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological 
malignancies. Underlying medical conditions in the patient population including history of 
recurring or chronic infections (e.g., chronic, active Epstein-Barr Virus) and prior 
immunosuppressive treatment are risk factors that may predispose to infections.

Preventability:
Guidance is provided in the SmPC that glofitamab should not be administered to 
patients with an active infection. Patients with a history of chronic or recurrent infection 
or those who have conditions or had treatment that may predispose them to infections 
should be monitored before and during glofitamab treatment for the emergence of new 
or reactivated infections. 
Impact on the benefit-risk balance of the product:
Serious infections are anticipated with glofitamab administration due to its mode of 
action resulting in B-cell depletion.  However, the risk is well recognized by healthcare 
professionals for the patient population in view of underlying conditions and/or prior 
immunosuppressive treatment that may predispose to infections. The management of 
serious infections in the patient population does not differ from routine oncology practice 
and the standard of care. 
The known risk of infections will be followed up via routine pharmacovigilance which, 
together with adherence by prescribers to risk-minimization messages in the Product 
Information (routine risk minimization measures), are considered sufficient for this risk. 
Public health impact:
Given that the appropriate guidance associated with glofitamab treatment is included in 
the SmPC and that serious infection and infestation events resolved in 69.6% of patients
who received at least one dose of glofitamab in the primary safety population, the impact 
of serious infections on public health is considered to be low.

Information on Missing Information
Long-term safety
At the 15 June 2022 CCOD, all patients in the primary safety population had either 
completed initial study treatment or discontinued initial study treatment. Median duration 
of follow-up for patients in the primary safety population who had received at least one 
dose of glofitamab was 13.5 months (range: 028 months) (Annex 7B.45). Limited data 
are available in terms of long-term safety of patients treated with glofitamab; long-term 
safety is therefore considered missing information. 
Evidence Source:
Population in need of further characterization
The assessment of long-term safety of glofitamab is not fully understood and ongoing 
analysis of future safety information is needed. Thus, long-term safety data is being 
collected from the ongoing NP30179 study (see Part III.2). To address this missing 
information, a minimum of two years follow-up from the end of treatment of the last 
patient enrolled in the primary safety population of Study NP30179, including an analysis 
of safety by sex shall be provided.
Safety in Patients with Prior CAR-T Therapy
Based on the 15 June 2022 CCOD, among patients in the primary safety population who 
received at least one dose of glofitamab (N145), more patients had not received prior 
CAR-T therapy (N98 [67.6%]) compared to patients who had received prior CAR-T 
therapy (N47 [32.4%]).
Serious AEs were reported in a higher proportion of patients who previously received 
CAR-T therapy compared with those who had not (55.3% vs. 44.9%; Annex 7B.41). 
Conversely, in patients who had not received prior CAR-T therapy compared to those 
who had, a higher proportion of patients reported AEs leading to dose 
modification/interruption (21.4% vs. 12.8%). However, the difference in the sample sizes 
of these subgroups could potentially be a reason for the observed imbalances. The 
incidence of Grade 3-5 AEs was comparable across both groups (65.3% in patients who 
had not received prior CAR-T therapy vs. 61.7% in those who had) and there were 
similar rates of CRS (65.3% in patients who had not received prior CAR-T therapy vs. 
72.3% in those who had).
Characterization of the safety profile of patients with prior CAR-T therapy is limited and 
is therefore considered missing information. Analysis of future safety information in this

Study/activity short name and title: 
BO43309 Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Additional Risk Minimisation Measures for 
Glofitamab: A Survey Among Healthcare Professionals in 10 Countries in the European 
Economic Area.
Rationale and Study Objectives: 
This non-interventional study will assess effectiveness of additional risk minimization 
measures (HCP Brochure, Patient Card). These measures will be implemented to intensify 
communication and medical and patient education around the important identified risks of 
CRS (Patient Card) and tumor flare (HCP Brochure).
The main objective of the study is to evaluate the following process and behavioural 
indicators: receipt of the educational materials (EMs), i.e., HCP Brochure and Patient Card,
by the target population (glofitamab prescribers) and distribution of the Patient Card by 
prescribers to their patients; awareness, knowledge, comprehension, and self-reported 
adherence of prescribers with respect to TF information included in the HCP brochure.
Study design: 
The survey will be conducted in selected countries among HCPs who prescribed glofitamab 
according to the label at least once in the six months prior to taking the survey. The survey 
will be sent to the participating HCPs to collect information on their awareness, knowledge, 
comprehension, and adherence with respect to TF information included in the HCP 
brochure. Therefore, the survey will have different types of questions (Awareness, 
Knowledge/ Comprehension and Adherence). In order to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
risk-minimization measures, the following process and behavioural indicators will be 
considered:




Receipt of the EMs, i.e., HCP brochure and Patient Card, by the target population 
(glofitamab prescribers) and the distribution of Patient Card by prescribers to their 
patients (metrics on implementing steps of additional risk minimization measures).
Awareness questions will involve collection of HCPs’ self-reported awareness of the 
risk of TF described in the HCP brochure and assess if HCPs have used the HCP 
brochure to gain awareness and knowledge of the risk of TF and whether HCPs have 
used the Patient Card to educate their patients about the risk of CRS associated with 
glofitamab and the risk mitigation measures for CRS.
Knowledge and comprehension questions will measure HCP 
knowledge/comprehension of the risk of TF that may occur with glofitamab use and on 
the specific guidance for risk minimization for TF, as described in the HCP brochure. 
In the adherence questions, HCPs will be asked to self-assess their adherence to the 
guidance provided in the HCP brochure. 
Study populations: 
A sample of HCPs who prescribed glofitamab according to the label, at least once in the six 
months prior to taking the survey.

measure
Objective(s)
Healthcare Professional Brochure
The HCP brochure will aim to educate and raise HCPs’ awareness 
and comprehension of the risk of TF, such that HCPs can detect and 
manage TF in a timely and appropriate manner. Optimizing the time to 
intervention and appropriate management of TF will prevent it from 
worsening and maximize recovery potential.
The HCP brochure will provide a description of TF, and information on 
early recognition, appropriate diagnosis, and monitoring of TF.
Rationale for the 
additional 
risk-minimization 
activity
Based on the characterization of TF, additional risk-minimization 
measures in the form of the HCP Brochure can increase the likelihood 
of an early diagnosis followed by appropriate treatment, thereby 
reducing the impact of TF on the patient.

Objective(s)
Patient Card
Based on the characterization of CRS, the Patient Card will 
enable the patient to receive education facilitated by the treating 
physician, on the key recommendations to be followed during the 
treatment with glofitamab, with the aim of minimizing the 
worsening of adverse reactions relevant to the risk of CRS. The 
intent is that the Patient Card will remind patients of the signs and 
symptoms of CRS and encourage patients to seek immediate
medical attention if signs and symptoms of CRS present.
Optimizing the time to intervention, and appropriate management 
of the adverse reactions or preventing further worsening of the 
adverse reactions will maximize recovery potential.
Furthermore, the Patient Card will alert HCPs that the patient is 
taking glofitamab (particularly useful if the patient is presenting at 
the emergency room).
Rationale for the 
additional 
risk-minimization 
activity
The Patient Card will promote awareness of the key signs and 
symptoms of CRS, thereby enabling early recognition of CRS by 
patients and timely reporting to their physicians, encouraging 
prompt intervention.

SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR COLUMVI
(GLOFITAMAB)
This is a summary of the risk-management plan (RMP) for Columvi. The RMP details 
important risks of Columvi, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Columvi’s risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Columvi’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Columvi should be 
used. 
This summary of the RMP for Columvi should be read in the context of all this 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all of which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Columvi’s RMP.
I.
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Columvi as monotherapy is authorized for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed 
or refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, after two or more lines of systemic therapy
(see SmPC for the full indication). It contains glofitamab as the active substance and is 
administered as an intravenous infusion.
Further information about the evaluation of Columvi’s benefits can be found in Columvi’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA Web site, under 
the medicine’s Web page. 
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS
Important risks of Columvi, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Columvi’s risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use,
in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging
 The authorized pack sizeThe amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly.
 The medicine’s legal statusThe way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
EU Risk Management Plan, Version 1.2 - F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd
glofitamab
116
of
1770
In the case of Columvi, these measures are supplemented with additional 
risk-minimization measures mentioned under relevant risks below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse events is collected 
continuously and regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment, so that immediate
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Columvi is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing Information” below.
II.A List of Important Risks and Missing Information
Important risks of Columvi are risks that need special risk-management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks 
are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Columvi. Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information about the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-
term use of the medicine).

Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups



Non-clinical studies, showing transient T-cell 
activation and cytokine release, primarily limited to 
the first dose
Phase I/II clinical trial data (Study NP30179)
Class effect: As observed with other CD3 engagers 
such as blinatumomab and CAR T-cell therapy, T-cell 
activation may lead to an excess of systemic cytokine 
release which may lead to serious and even fatal 
events
The risk of CRS may be influenced by factors related to 
the type of therapy and treatment dose, the underlying 
disease (type, tumor burden, and tumor cell location 
[e.g., peripheral blood vs. bone marrow], patient 
characteristics (age, general health status, and 
comorbidity burden; basal inflammatory state), and degree 
of T-cell activation and expansion. Disease burden is 
among the most important predictors of severe CRS after 
CAR T-cell therapy and the bispecific T-cell engager
blinatumomab.
Risk-minimization measures Routine risk-minimization measures:
SmPC section 4.2, 4.4 and 4.8
Recommendation for monitoring for the development of 
CRS is included in SmPC section 4.2.

Important Identified Risk: Tumor Flare
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Risk-minimization measures
Tumor flare has been observed in clinical data (Study 
NP30179) with glofitamab. It is a known risk with 
other immunomodulating agents, T-cell engaging 
therapies, checkpoint inhibitor therapies.
Treatment with immunomodulatory agents is 
associated with tumor flare, and more frequent with 
hematologic malignancies than in patients with solid 
tumors.

Important Identified Risk: Serious Infections
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Serious  infections  have  been  observed in  clinical  data 
(Study NP30179) with glofitamab.
Risk factors and risk groups
Serious infections is a recognized risk associated with B-
cell depletion treatment effect and a major cause of 
morbidity and mortality in patients with hematological 
malignancies. Underlying medical conditions in the patient 
population including history of recurring or chronic 
infections (e.g., chronic, active Epstein-Barr Virus) and 
prior immunosuppressive treatment are risk factors that 
may predispose to infections.
Risk-minimization measures Routine risk-minimization measures: 
SmPC section 4.4 and 4.8
Recommendation for monitoring for the development of 
Serious Infections is included in SmPC section 4.4.

1.  Introduction 
On 04/06/2015, the MAH submitted the final study report   FUTURE 4 extension (AC-052-392), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These data are also submitted as part of the post-authorisation measure(s)  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  FUTURE  4  Extension  (Study  AC-052-392):  Multicenter,  non-drug-interventional 
extension study to assess long-term safety and effects on growth in patients who received bosentan or 
placebo  as  adjunctive  therapy  to  inhaled  nitric  oxide  (iNO)  for  persistent  pulmonary  hypertension  of 
the newborn (PPHN) in FUTURE 4 ( (AC-052-391), is a stand-alone study. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
FUTURE 4 Extension was a non-drug-interventional study.  
During  the  core  study  FUTURE  4,  study  drug  was  bosentan  at  doses  of  2  mg/kg  b.i.d.  and  2  mg/kg 
t.i.d.,  provided  as  a  32  mg  dispersible  tablet  for  oral  administration.  Each  tablet  was  quadrisectible, 
clover shaped, and breakable into 4 parts of 8 mg each. (Tracleer 32 mg dispersible tablets, batches 
FP014, CXFC, DTHD, and GTXF). 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In  February  2002,  the  CPMP  recommended  the  granting  of  a  Marketing  Authorisation  (MA)  for  the 
medicinal  products  Tracleer  62.5  mg  and  125  mg  film-coated  tablet.  In  April  2009,  Tracleer  32  mg 
quadrisecable dispersible tablets were approved by CHMP as  a line extension for patients who cannot 
take the film coated tablets (registration procedure EMEA/H/C/000401/X/0039) 
The active substance of Tracleer is bosentan which is an oral, dual endothelin (ET)-receptor antagonist 
with  affinity  for  both  ETa  and  ETb  receptors.  Bosentan  competes  with  the  binding  of  ET-1  to  both 
receptors.  
The current indication for the 3 strengths is: 
Treatment  of  pulmonary  arterial  hypertension  (PAH)  to  improve  exercise  capacity  and  symptoms  in 
patients with WHO functional class III. Efficacy has been shown in: 
• 
• 
• 
Primary (idiopathic and familial) PAH 
PAH secondary to scleroderma without significant interstitial pulmonary disease 
PAH associated with congenital systemic-to-pulmonary shunts and Eisenmenger’s physiology 
Some improvements have also been shown in patients with PAH WHO functional class II (see section 
5.1).

Tracleer is also indicated to reduce the number of new digital ulcers in patients with systemic sclerosis 
and ongoing digital ulcer disease (see section 5.1)." 
The FUTURE 4 pediatric studies in PPHN patients was conducted as part of the PIP: 
• 
• 
FUTURE  4  study  (AC-052-391):  Exploratory,  multicenter,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled, 
randomized,  prospective  study  to  evaluate  pharmacokinetics,  safety  and  efficacy  of  bosentan 
as  add-on  therapy  to  inhaled  nitric  oxide  in  the  management  of  persistent  pulmonary 
hypertension of the newborn.” (FUTURE 4). 
FUTURE 4-extension study (AC-052-392): Multicenter, non-drug-interventional extension study 
to assess long-term safety and effects on growth in patients who received bosentan or placebo 
as adjunctive therapy to iNO for PPHN in FUTURE 4 (FUTURE 4 Extension). 
Background:  
Core FUTURE 4 (AC-052-391) was submitted as part of a Type II variation in April 2014 
(EMEA/H/C/000401/II/0066). The Day 80 and Day 150 Rapporteur's Assessment reports were 
circulated in June 2014 and October 2014, respectively with final CHMP opinion on November 2014. 
FUTURE 4 (AC-052-391) was the first randomized, placebo-controlled trial performed to investigate the 
effect of bosentan as add-on therapy to inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) in neonates with PPHN and who did 
not adequately respond to iNO, no additional benefit of bosentan treatment was observed.  
Subjects with persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN) had been treated in the 
FUTURE 4 core study for a maximum of 10 days with bosentan (2 mg/kg body weight twice a day 
[b.i.d.]) or placebo as adjunctive treatment to inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy. Results of the 
FUTURE 4 core study did not indicate additional benefit of an endothelin receptor antagonist in this 
setting. A total of 23 patients were randomized in a 2:1 ratio to bosentan 2 mg/kg b.i.d. (N = 15) or 
placebo (N = 8). The median age (days, min–max) at first dosing with the study treatment was similar 
in the bosentan group (1.4 days, 0.6–5.6 days) and in the placebo group (1.7 days, 0.6–5.9 days). 
The median exposure (days, min–max) in this short-term study was similar in the bosentan (4.5 days, 
0.5–10.0 days) and placebo groups (4.0 days, 2.5–6.5 days). Approximately 60.0% of patients in the 
bosentan and placebo groups had at least 4 days of exposure to study treatment. This study showed 
that there was no benefit in adding bosentan on top of inhaled NO in infants who did not adequately 
respond to inhaled NO. The mean time to complete weaning from iNO and from mechanical ventilation 
appeared longer in the bosentan group as compared to the placebo group. 
The MAH now submits a final report(s) for: 
• 
FUTURE 4 Extension (AC-052-392); 
The  present  submission  complies  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No.  1901/2006  (the  ‘Paediatric 
Regulation’).

Methods 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted in accordance with article 46 of 
regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as amended

Objectives 
To assess long-term safety and effects on growth in subjects who received bosentan or placebo in the 
FUTURE 4 core study 
Study design 
This  was  a  multi-center,  non-drug-interventional,  exploratory,  Phase  3,  extension  study,  which 
enrolled the subjects from the FUTURE 4 core study who had received at least one dose of study drug 
(bosentan 2 mg/kg twice a day [b.i.d.] dispersible tablet formulation or matching placebo). 
The  enrollment  in  FUTURE  4  extension  study  was  performed  after  the  FUTURE  4  core  End-of-Study 
(EOS)  visit  and  within  6  months  after  approval  of  the  FUTURE  4  study  extension  protocol  at  the 
respective  study  site.  The  observation  period  for  all  subjects  enrolled  into  the  FUTURE  4  extension 
study started from the FUTURE 4 core EOS and lasted up to 12 months (+ 2 months’ time window) 
thereafter.  The  observation  period  concluded  with  an  End-of-observation  period  (EoOP)  assessment 
visit, which included collection of growth variables. 
At  Month  4  (±  1  month)  and  at  Month  8  (±  1  month)  after  the  FUTURE  4  core  EOS,  subjects  were 
either  brought  to  the  site  or  the  investigator  contacted  the  health  professional  (e.g.,  pediatrician) 
taking  care  of  the  subject  to  record  AEs  or  SAEs  (if  any),  and  to  collect  other  data  (i.e.,  bosentan 
administration). 
CHMP's comment:  
Actelion  and  the  investigator  remained  blinded  to  the  treatments  administered  in  the  FUTURE  4  core 
study until the closure of the FUTURE 4 core study database i.e. before the end of FUTURE 4 extension. 
Study population /Sample size 
The  study  included  male  and  female  subjects  who  had  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  drug 
(bosentan  2  mg/kg  b.i.d.  dispersible  tablet  formulation  or  matching  placebo)  in  the  FUTURE  4  core 
study. Subjects treated in the FUTURE 4 core study were term or near-term newborns (gestational age 
> 34 weeks) between ≥ 12 h and < 7 days of age with idiopathic PPHN (100% bosentan, 62.5% n=5 
placebo)  or  PPHN  secondary  to  parenchymal  lung  diseases  (n=  3  patients  placebo)  with  no  or 
insufficient response to inhaled nitric oxide (iNO) therapy.

CHMP's comment:  
The median exposure (days, min–max) in FUTURE 4 study was similar in the bosentan (4.5 days, 0.5–
10.0  days)  and  placebo  groups  (4.0  days,  2.5–6.5  days).  Approximately  60.0%  of  patients  in  the 
bosentan and placebo groups had at least 4 days of exposure to study treatment. 
Treatments 
No study drug was administered. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The safety endpoints of the study were the following: 
•  Serious adverse events (SAEs) occurring more than 60 days after the End-of-Treatment (EOT) 
in the FUTURE 4 core study and up to EoOP. 
•  Non-serious  adverse  events  (AEs)  occurring  during  the  observation  period  (i.e.,  from  EOS  of 
FUTURE 4 core study and up to EoOP). 
•  Change  from baseline (birth weight and length) to EoOP in growth variables (i.e., weight and 
length). 
Statistical Methods 
There was no hypothesis testing and all statistical analyses were descriptive in nature. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
Of  the  23  randomised  neonates,  21  patients  received  the  study  drug,  20  (12  bosentan,  8  placebo) 
completed the study treatment.  
In  total,  15  of  the  21  subjects  treated  in  the  FUTURE  4  core  study  were  enrolled  into  the  FUTURE  4 
extension study; 6 were not enrolled due to refusal or inability to participate (n = 5) or lost contact (n 
= 1). 
All  15  subjects  enrolled  into  the  FUTURE  4  extension  study  completed  the  12-month  observation 
period. 
Baseline data 
Of the 21 subjects treated in the FUTURE 4 core study, 20 were successfully weaned from iNO at study 
completion (i.e., EOS); 1 subject was on extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation but recovered within 
60 days. 15 of these 21 subjects entered the extension study.  
In these 15 subjects (7 ex-bosentan, 8 ex-placebo), median gestational age (median, min-max) was 
41 weeks (37.0–41.0 weeks) in the ex-bosentan group and 38.5 weeks (36.0–42.0 weeks) in the ex-
placebo group. The median age (days, min–max) at first dosing with the study treatment was 1.1 days 
(0.6–2.6 days) in the ex-bosentan group and 1.7 days, (0.6–5.9 days) in the ex-placebo group. 
Median baseline oxygenation index (OI) (min–max) for the 21 subjects of the FUTURE 4 core study 
indicated that the disease condition was more severe in the bosentan group (OI=18.3 [5.9–44.3]) than 
in the placebo group (OI=13.2 [7.1–39.4]). However, in the 15 subjects who entered the extension

study, median baseline OI values (min-max) were similar in the ex-bosentan (14.0 [7.6, 37.8]) and 
ex-placebo groups (13.2 [7.1, 39.4]).

Growth curves 
Subjects’ growth curves (length and weight) remained within 5th to 95th WHO growth percentiles, 
which indicated sustained growth. 
Safety results 
Overall adverse event profile: 
The FUTURE 4 extension study protocol allowed prospective and retrospective data collection: 7 
subjects were enrolled within the observation period (i.e., within 12 + 2 months after FUTURE 4 core 
EOS) and had both prospective and retrospective data. In 8 subjects, enrollment was after the end of 
observation period, and thus data obtained were fully retrospective. 
A total of 8 subjects (4 each, ex-bosentan and ex-placebo) experienced AEs during the 12-month (+ 2 
months) observation period (i.e., from FUTURE 4 core EOS up to FUTURE 4 extension end of 
observation period) [Table 3]. Overall, AEs reported were of the nature that was expected for infants. 
Respiratory infections were the most frequently reported AEs, whose incidence was similar in the ex-
bosentan and ex-placebo groups (3 subjects, each). 
In the ex-bosentan group, 4 subjects experienced AEs. Upper respiratory tract infection was reported 
in 2 subjects. 1 of these subjects also experienced urinary tract infection and anemia. Bronchitis and 
ear infection was reported in 1 subject each.  
In the ex-placebo group, 4 subjects experienced AEs. 1 subject who simultaneously experienced 
respiratory tract infection and wheezing also experienced vomiting, had rash and was further reported 
with viral gastroenteritis and tonsillitis without any temporal association to the earlier infections. 1 
subject who experienced bronchitis was also reported with constipation, seborrhea, alopecia, 
gastroesophagal reflux disease and diaper dermatitis. 1 subject experienced croup infection and had a 
scar on the right heel. 1 subject experienced positional plagiocephaly. 
Anemia in 1 subject was assessed by the investigator as unrelated to previous bosentan 
administration. All AEs resolved except anemia, scar and positional plagiocephaly.

Death and other serious adverse events: 
No deaths occurred during the observational period and there were no serious adverse events (SAEs) 
reported.  The  vital  status  of  the  6  subjects  who  did  not  participate  in  this  study  is  also  known:  4 
subjects are alive and 2 subjects have no death records in a publicly available registry. 
Safety topics of special interest: 
AEs  known  to  be  associated  with  bosentan  treatment,  such  as  abnormal  liver  tests  data,  anemia  or 
edema,  are  not  expected  to  occur  once  the  treatment  is  terminated  and  the  drug  is  eliminated  from 
the body. In the FUTURE 4 extension study, mild anemia was reported 7 months after discontinuation 
of  bosentan  treatment,  following  repetitive  infections.  However,  the  AE  was  considered  by  the 
investigator as unrelated to the study drug. 
Safety topics of special interest: 
The change from baseline to end of observation period in growth variables (i.e., weight and length) did 
not  indicate  any  apparent  difference  between  ex-bosentan  and  ex-placebo  subjects.  Overall  subject

growth  curves  (length  and  weight)  remained  within  5th  to  95th  WHO  growth  percentiles,  which 
indicated sustained growth. 
CHMP comment:  
Results of this extension phase study did not raised any new safety concern. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Bosentan is not indicated in PPHN and the development of bosentan in PPHN is no longer ongoing due 
to lack of benefit in this population. The results from the 12 months observational period of the 
FUTURE 4 extension study, though with limitations, did not suggest safety concerns or growth 
impairment during a 1-year follow-up.

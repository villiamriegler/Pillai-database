Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Rasilez, Rasilez HCT and 
Rasilamlo the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
“In 36 reported cases of nausea, out of which all were with de-challenge positive, 7 with re-challenge 
positive, there is strong evidence that a causal association between aliskiren treatment and nausea 
cannot be ruled out. In randomized controlled studies the incidence of nausea in the aliskiren 
treatment group (3.1%) was similar to Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and slightly 
higher than that of other available treatment groupings (that is Hydrochlorothiazide (2%) and 
Angiotensin Receptor Blocker (1.3%). In the SmPC of ACE inhibitors nausea is a listed adverse drug 
reaction (ADR).  
Nausea is a listed as an ADR in hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine SmPCs with a frequency 
“uncommon” but not in aliskiren containing products’ SmPCs. 
Out of 274 reported cases of vomiting, analysed by the MAH from post marketing data, in 14 cases a 
causal association between aliskiren treatment and vomiting could not be ruled out due to 12 cases 
with de-challenge positive, 1 case with re-challenge positive, and a plausible time to onset (TTO). The 
SmPCs of hydrochlorothiazide and amlodipine, but not aliskiren, contain vomiting as an ADR with a 
frequency “uncommon” and “common” respectively. 
Out of 144 cases of vertigo, reported cumulatively, there were 4 cases where the causal relationship 
cannot be ruled out. All of them reported positive de-challenge and 2 of them reported positive re-
challenge. For the 35 cases that did not have enough information a definitive relationship cannot be 
excluded. 
Therefore, in view of available data regarding nausea, vomiting and vertigo the PRAC considered that 
changes to the product information were warranted.” 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for Rasilez, Rasilez HCT and Rasilamlo, the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal products containing the active substance 
ALISKIREN is favourable subject to the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisations should be varied.

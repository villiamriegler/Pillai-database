Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for cenobamate, the scientific 
conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
In view of available data from clinical trials and spontaneous reports, including 11 Individual Case 
Safety Reports with a close temporal relationship and a positive de-challenge, the PRAC considers a 
causal relationship between cenobamate and “suicidal ideation” is at least a reasonable possibility. The 
PRAC concluded that the product information of products containing cenobamate should be amended 
accordingly. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for cenobamate the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-
risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing cenobamate is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Merck Europe B.V. submitted to 
the European Medicines Agency on 29 November 2019 an application for a variation. 
The following changes were proposed: 
Variation requested 
Type 
Annexes 
affected 
C.I.4  
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to new 
Type II 
I, II and IIIB 
quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance data 
Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to update efficacy information following results from study 
EMR100070-003 Part B listed as a specific obligation in the Annex II; this is a Phase II, open-label, 
multicenter trial to investigate the clinical activity and safety of avelumab (MSB0010718C) in subjects 
with Merkel cell carcinoma. With this submission the company is also taking the opportunity to update 
annex-II proposing deletion of the specific obligation and proposing the switch from conditional to full 
marketing authorisation. The package leaflet and the RMP (version 2.1) are updated accordingly. The 
requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
In accordance with the SOB, the MAH submitted the final results of the primary analysis for part B of 
study EMR100070-003 (May 2019).  
The primary analysis demonstrated that the effect of avelumab monotherapy in 1L metatstaic Merkel 
Cell Carcinoma (mMCC), based on the interim analysis evaluation of 29 patients for a minimum of 13 
weeks’ follow-up in March 2017, was overestimated: the durable response rate  (DRR objective 
responses lasting at least 6 months) dropped from 83% to 30%; Objective Response rate (ORR) from 
62% to 40%; and median Progression Free Survival (mPFS) from 9.1 to 4.1 months. The safety profile 
remains unchanged 
Despite the lower effect estimates, the data still support a positive Benefit/Risk (B/R) for Bavencio 
both in the first line and the previously treated mMCC. In this context it is noted that avelumab 
remains to the date of this assessment the only approved drug for mMCC in EU, and the only non-
chemotherapy option. 
The MAH provided answers to the request of supplementary information. The differences in ECOG and 
PD-L1 status between the 29 patients in the IA and the 87 accrued afterwards until EOS are 
highlighted. It seems reasonable that the difference may be at least partially explained by the baseline 
characteristics of early versus late recruited patients. 
The relevant specific obligation is considered fulfilled and the data confirm that the benefits of 
Bavencio both in the first and next line treatment of mMCC continue to outweigh the risks. On that 
basis, the CHMP is of the view that there are no remaining grounds for the marketing authorisations to 
remain conditional and therefore recommends the granting of a marketing authorisation no longer 
subject to specific obligations.   
The SmPC has been updated to include the data from study EMR100070-003 in section 5.1 and is 
considered acceptable.

The RMP version 2.2.1. is considered acceptable. 
The benefit-risk balance of Bavencio remains positive.

Annex: Rapporteur’s assessment comments on the type II 
variation 
5.  Introduction 
The application dossier for avelumab monotherapy in mMCC, which yielded a CMA for a line-agnostic 
indication, consisted of one single-arm, two-cohort study (EMR100070-003): 
- 
- 
Part A: a study in mMCC patients previously treated with at least one line of chemotherapy and 
progressing after the most recent regimen. Primary endpoint: ORR 
Part B includes treatment naïve MCC patients in the metastatic setting who may have received 
adjuvant systemic therapy >6 months prior to study start. The primary endpoint is durable 
response rate, DRR, with a minimum duration of 6 months. Assuming a true DRR of 45% the 
probability to observe lower bound of the exact 95% CI above 20% would be >99% and above 
30% would be 90%.  The study has been designed to have 1 planned interim analysis at 3 
months after the accrual of the 25th subject, with additional interim analyses possible. The 
primary analysis was planned to be conducted 15 months after the accrual of the last subject 
(object of this submission in fulfilment of the SOB). Subject follow-up for progression and 
survival is planned to continue until 5 years after the last subject receives the last dose of 
avelumab or the last subject dies, whichever occurs first.   
At the time of the CMA (2017), there were no approved therapies for mMCC. The most commonly used 
first-line chemotherapy regimen in disseminated disease is a platinum compound ± etoposide, 
resulting in high response rates (60-70%), but poor duration of response. With respect to relapsed 
disease, study data are sparse, but the ORR is much lower than in the first-line setting and duration is 
brief. Historic control in the JRAR: Iyer et al. Cancer Medicine 2016:

6.  Clinical Pharmacology aspects 
Study EMR100070-003 is an ongoing global Phase II, open-label, single-arm study of avelumab 10 
mg/kg in subjects with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (mMCC) conducted in 2 parts (Parts A and B). 
Part B enrolled 116 subjects with MCC who are treatment-naïve to chemotherapy in the metastatic 
setting and were treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks. The clinical pharmacology results 
Assessment report

Page 6/25 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
are only for part B, as part A had been reported previously in the initial submission in support of the 
initial Marketing Authorisation. 
For EMR100070-003 Part B, sparse blood samples were collected prior to each drug infusion through 
Week 7, then at 6-week intervals until Week 25 (Day 169), and afterwards at 12-week intervals while 
on treatment for determination of Ctrough. Post-infusion samples were collected at the end of infusion on 
Weeks 1, 7, and 25 for determination of CEOI. 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Quantification of avelumab in human serum 
An addendum to the previously validated bioanalysis method for the quantification of avelumab in 
human serum was provided (report 15-GR023-V0, 218-1407 Addendum 4). To assess the selectivity in 
the paediatric  population,  blank  human serum samples from ten healthy paediatric volunteers was 
measured. Acceptance criteria were met at 750 ng/mL and ULOQ but failed at 250 ng/mL (125% 
LLOQ) due to over-recovery in many of the individual lots (103.2-176.0%). Method 218-1407 is not 
suitable to analyse paediatric samples. Selectivity at 750 ng/mL passed, and the method may be 
suitable for analysing paediatric samples with a truncated assay range and an appropriate validation 
will be performed (218-1823). 
Amendment 2 (report 15-GR023-V0, 218-1407) demonstrated stability for up to 8 freeze/thaw cycles. 
The impact of the presence of PD-L1 (target) was evaluated at the LLOQ, LQC, and ULOQ with 5 
concentrations of PD-L1:  0, 5, 10, 25, and 50 ng/mL. At the 0 ng/mL level, all results were BQL. At 
the LLOQ and ULOQ levels, all samples recover within 20% of the nominal concentration. At the LQC 
level, in the presence of 0, 10, 25, and 50 ng/mL PD-L1, the samples recovered within 20% of the 
nominal concentration, but not at 5 ng/mL PD-L1. Overall,  this  indicates  that  there  is  no 
interference from PD-L1 up to 50 ng/mL. 
A bioanalytical study report (218-1502) was provided containing the study results and within study 
validation which all passed the acceptance criteria, including incurred sample reproducibility which was 
passed for 176 out of 184 reportable ISR results (95.7%). 
Immunogenicity – Anti drug antibodies (ADA) 
Two ADA methods were used for study EMR100070-003 and were split between two  laboratories 
(Covance [Covance, New Jersey, United States] and QPS [QPS LLC, Delaware, United States]) Parts A 
and B, respectively. To afford clarity of interpretation of the ADA titer results, it was decided to retiter 
at  QPS all screened and confirmed positives previously determined at Covance. Therefore, all titer 
results for Study EMR100070-003 are provided by QPS; the screening and confirming results were split 
between Covance and QPS, Part A and Part B, respectively. The respective method validations are 
summarised in Table 1.  
Step-wise method (Covance) 
Samples from studies EMR100070-001, EMR100070-002, and EMR100070-003 Part A were analysed 
using the step-wise ECL assay at Covance beginning 18 July 2014. Samples from studies EMR100070-
001 and EMR100070-003 previously evaluated against the NHV cut point factor were reprocessed 
using the ST cut point factor in 2017, and additional confirmatory and titer assays were performed on 
the new screen positive samples as applicable.  
The validated method is a step-wise electrochemiluminescence (ECL) assay. In brief, biotinylated 
avelumab is captured on the streptavidin-coated plates. The samples and quality controls are 
incubated with acid to dissociate complexes of antibody and avelumab, then neutralized, and then 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/333708/2020  
Page 7/25 
 
 
 
incubated with the coated plates, where the analyte is specifically captured with Ruthenium sulfo-tag-
labelled avelumab, and then quantified by ECL detection. Samples that test positive in the screening 
assay are subsequently tested in a confirmatory assay to ensure that signal is decreased in the 
presence of excess avelumab. Samples that confirm positive are further characterized to determine the 
titer of ADA present. 
Homogenous method (QPS)[new] 
Samples from study EMR100070 003 Part B were analysed using the homogeneous ECL assay at QPS 
beginning 15 May 2018. 
The validated method is a homogeneous bridging format ECL assay. In brief, unknown and control 
samples, after minimal required dilution, are mixed and incubated with acid buffer to dissociate 
complexes of antibody and avelumab, improving the drug tolerance of the assay. Subsequently, a mix 
of capture/detection reagents (i.e., avelumab conjugated with Biotin and SULFO-TAG) is added along 
with neutralization buffer allowing the bridging binding between ADA and labeled-drugs to be formed. 
The bridged ADA-avelumab complexes are captured on a streptavidin pre-coated/pre-blocked MSD 
microplate allowing for detection after a wash step.  
The assay result is based on the comparison between sample readout and a plate-specific screening 
cut-point. The screening assay results are reported as “putative positive” (equal or above cut-point) or 
“negative” (below cut-point). Positive (“putative”) samples are tested for specificity where these 
samples undergo competition testing in the presence and absence of avelumab. Titers are determined 
for confirmed positive samples. 
Drug tolerance enabled detection of 20 ng/mL of antibody in the presence of 25 µg/mL avelumab and 
both 250 and 500 ng/mL of antibody was detected in the presence of 100 µg/mL avelumab. Based on 
the median concentration at trough, the level of drug tolerance was anticipated to be sufficient to 
support the clinical development program.  
Selectivity was established in both adult and paediatric patient serum (see Table 1).

6.2.  Results 
Pharmacokinetics (EMR100070-003 Part B) 
In patients treated with avelumab 10 mg/kg every 2 weeks, the geometric means of CEOI (end of 
infusion) and Ctrough of avelumab after the first dose were 237 μg/mL and 22.2 μg/mL, respectively 
(Table 2 and Table 3). CEOI appeared to be stable over time. The geometric mean and mean of Ctrough 
appeared to increase with time and reach plateau at Week 25, which was in line with previous 
observations. Observed geometric coefficients of variation (CV%) for CEOI ranged from 27.7% to 32.1% 
(Table 2). There was a large interindividual variability in observed Ctrough. The geometric CV% for Ctrough 
ranged from 21.4% to 130.4% (Table 3). The values and variability of CEOI and Ctrough were consistent 
with those observed in Part A (CEOI 252μg/mL, range 107 - 1108μg/mL, 13.8 - 34.7%; Ctrough 
23.8μg/ml, range 1.58 - 245μg/mL, CV% 12.8 - 101.6% ).

Immunogenicity 
Immunogenicity incidence for study EMR100070-003 is presented in Table 4 (data cut-off 02 May 
2019). Samples for evaluation of ADA response using the homogeneous bridging format assay were 
available for 116 subjects. One subject had a positive ADA response at baseline, but the response was 
not boosted upon treatment. Eight of 110 subjects (7.3%) had treatment-emergent ADA response. 
Three of those 8 subjects were transient positives and the remaining 5 were persistent positives. The 
titers were generally low, with two notable exceptions: one transient positive had a titer of 14,580 on a 
single occasion, and a second persistent positive had a maximum titer of 43,740 but by end of 
treatment the titer was only 180. Three of 9 ADA ever-positive subjects with mMCC responded to 
avelumab treatment in Study EMR100070-003 Part B, all with partial responses.  
Due to the low incidence of immunogenicity and few PK assessments after onset due to sparse 
sampling, the potential association of immunogenicity with PK was not analysed in the current study 
but will be evaluated in an integrated assessment across clinical studies.

samples, 6 samples screened positive for neutralizing antibody, and 1 sample was insufficient volume 
(ISV) for analysis and a backup aliquot was analysed. A recently developed competitive ligand-based 
neutralizing antibody assay with improved drug tolerance was validated and results from this assay will 
be reported at the completion of this study.   
6.3.  Discussion 
Bio- and immuno- analytical methods and reports were provided and are considered adequate for the 
intended use. 
The concentrations measured at the end of infusion and trough in part B are similar to previous 
observations for part A. The interindividual variability, which is high, in particular for Ctrough, is also in 
the same range as in part A. Of note, data of part A was included in the population PK model in the 
original application, and overall inter individual variability was considered moderate. Given that the 
clinical pharmacology profile of avelumab did not change in Study EMR100070-003 Part B, the new 
clinical pharmacology data has no impact on the benefit/risk profile. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/333708/2020  
Page 11/25 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the updated analysis for Part B is consistent with data previously reported from Part A, with a 
low incidence of immunogenicity. Since only sparse sampling was available, no new analyses of the 
impact of immunogenicity on PK were provided. The impact on PK remains low. 
This new data does not result in a change to SmPC section 5.2, which is acceptable. 
7.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
EMR100070-003 is an ongoing, multicenter, international, single-arm, open-label, Phase II study in 2 
parts (Part A and Part B) that was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of avelumab in subjects 
with metastatic Merkel Cell Cancer (mMCC). In Part B (subject of this report), patients were treatment-
naïve to systemic therapy in the metastatic setting. 
The primary objective for Part B was to evaluate the clinical activity of avelumab as first-line treatment 
for metastatic or distally recurrent Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) as determined by the durable response 
rate (DRR), defined as an objective response lasting at least six months. Up to 112 patients were 
planned to be enrolled.

Results 
Avelumab as first-line therapy in subjects with mMCC produced durable responses in a clinically 
meaningful proportion of subjects with 35 of 116 patients, for a DRR of 30.2% (95% CI: 22.0, 39.4). 
ORR was 39.7% (95% CI: 30.7, 49.2) according to IERC assessment.  
The median duration of response of 18.2 months (95% CI: 11.3, -); the maximum duration as of the 
cutoff date was ongoing at 28.3 months.

Issue 1, CMA 
The underlying arguments for the CMA approval were at the time: 
• 
The first-line data were very limited, but the response rate (back then similar to 
chemotherapy) and the apparent durability of responses were considered favourable in a 
comparison with intensive chemotherapy. 
As part of the SOB, the primary analysis for part B (May 2019) has been submitted by the MAH.  
The effect of avelumab monotherapy in 1L mMCC, based on the evaluation of 29 patients for a 
minimum of 13 weeks’ follow-up in March 2017, was overestimated compared to the final outcome: 
the DRR dropped from 83% to 30%; ORR from 62% to 40% and mPFS from 9.1 to 4.1 months.  
The effect estimate for the primary analysis is thus substantially lower than at the interim analysis. 
The  B/R estimation is revised and narrowed, yet remains positive.

combination should be discussed by the MAH. The MAH should discuss biomarker subgroups of patients 
for whom avelumab therapy should not be indicated.  
Discussion 
The primary analysis demonstrated that the effect of avelumab monotherapy in 1L mMCC, based on 
the interim analysis evaluation of 29 patients for a minimum of 13 weeks’ follow-up in March 2017, 
was overestimated: the durable response rate  (DRR objective responses lasting at least 6 months) 
dropped from 83% to 30%; ORR from 62% to 40%; and mPFS from 9.1 to 4.1 months in the final 
primary analysis provided with the SOB data. The safety profile remains unchanged. 
Despite the lower effect estimates, the data still support a positive B/R for Bavencio both in the first 
line and the previously treated mMCC. In this context it is noted that avelumab remains to the date of 
this assessment the only approved drug for mMCC in EU, and the only non-chemotherapy option. 
The MAH provided answers to the request of supplementary information. The differences in ECOG and 
PD-L1 status between the 29 patients in the IA and the 87 accrued afterwards until EOS are 
highlighted. It seems reasonable that the difference may be at least partially explained by the baseline 
characteristics of early versus late recruited patients. 
8.  Clinical Safety aspects 
The safety profile of avelumab as a single agent in systemic therapy-naïve subjects with recurrent or 
metastatic MCC was well characterized in 116 subjects with at least 15 months of follow up in Part B of 
Study EMR100070-003. 
The most frequently reported TEAEs of any grade were constipation, cough, fatigue, and asthenia. 
TEAEs were generally manageable and mild to moderate in severity. Grade ≥ 3 treatment-related 
TEAEs were reported for 21 subjects (18.1%), and 12.1% of subjects discontinued avelumab 
treatment permanently due to a treatment-related TEAE. There were no avelumab-related Grade 5 
TEAEs. 
Based on the mechanism of action and the known safety profile of avelumab, irAEs were expected. 
Immune-related AEs occurred in 35 subjects (30.2%). In all treated subjects, most irAEs were 
reported in the subcategories of immune-related rash (18 subjects, 15.5%) and immune-related 
endocrinopathies: thyroid disorders (7 subjects, 6.0%). The number of subjects with high-grade 
(Grade ≥ 3) irAEs was low (7 subjects, 6.0%) and most were reported for the subcategory of immune-
related hepatitis. A single subject was reported with a Grade 4 irAE of dermatitis psoriasiform. There 
were no Grade 5 irAEs. 
Infusion-related reactions were reported in 34 subjects (29.3%). Most IRRs were either mild or 
moderate in severity. Only 1 subject reported a Grade 3 IRR, and there were no Grade 4 or 5 IRRs. In 
most subjects the initial IRR was associated with the first infusion of avelumab and resolved within 1 
day after onset of the event. All IRRs resolved except for one which resolved with sequelae. Three 
subjects (2.6%) permanently discontinued study treatment due to IRRs. 
These updated safety analysis results are consistent with those reported previously. The overall safety 
profile of avelumab in mMCC also remains consistent with the overall safety profile of the pooled data 
set based on 1738 subjects with advanced solid tumor malignancies (refer to Module 2.7.4 in the initial 
MAA). These data continue to confirm a manageable safety profile of avelumab in mMCC. 
In conclusion the data do not raise any new safety concerns for avelumab.

9.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. The main proposed RMP changes 
were the following: 
- 
- 
Part IV and Part VI.II.C.1 are no longer applicable after the submission of the primary analysis 
of study report EMR 100070-003/Part B 
Annex 5 is no longer applicable after the submission of the primary analysis of study report 
EMR 100070-003/Part B 
9.1.  Overall conclusion on the RMP 
 The changes to the RMP could be acceptable provided an updated RMP and satisfactory responses 
to the request for supplementary information in section 11 are submitted.  
The RMP Version 2.1 (PDF format) has not been updated in Part IV with the proposed deletion of Table 
21, as in the RMP working document.  
1.  The MAH is required to update the RMP with all changes as proposed in the working document. 
2.  The RMP Version 2.1 contains outdated information in multiple sections, and a general 
revision/update of the RMP is required. 
Examples of outdated information in the RMP Version 2.1 
The removal of educational material for HCPs was approved as part of the assessment of the RMP 
Version 2.0 (EMEA/H/C/004338/II/0009/G).  
The reclassification of immune-related pancreatitis to an important identified risk was approved as part 
of the assessment of the RMP Version 2.0 (EMEA/H/C/004338/II/0009/G). 
10.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, section 5.1.  of the SmPC is being updated to add efficacy information 
following results from study EMR100070-003 Part B listed as a specific obligation in the Annex II. 
Please refer to the attached, annotated SmPC.

11.1.  Other concerns 
Clinical aspects 
1.  In part B of the pivotal study, the estimated DRR and ORR differs widely between the patients 
(n=29) included in the March 2017 interim analysis, and the primary analysis results (n=116) 
for which patients were subsequently accrued. Please present data for outcomes in that 
complementary subgroup of 87 patients that were not included in the IA, and discuss the 
baseline disease and demographic characteristics, including prognostic and predictive factors 
(such as PD-L1 expression), or any other aspects of study conduct, with respect to potential 
reasons for the difference in outcomes between these two subsets of the study population.

Clinical aspects 
Comment 1 
In Part B of the pivotal study, the estimated DRR and ORR differ widely between the patients (n=29) 
included  in  the  March  2017  interim  analysis,  and  the  primary  analysis  results  (n=116)  for  which 
patients  were  subsequently  accrued.  Please  present  data  for  outcomes  in  that  complementary 
subgroup  of  87  patients  that  were  not  included  in  the  IA,  and  discuss  the  baseline  disease  and

or any other aspects of study conduct, with respect to potential reasons for the difference in outcomes 
between these two subsets of the study population. 
Response 
The estimated ORR and DRR were higher for the group of subjects included in the March 2017 interim 
analysis than in the complementary subgroup (Table 1 and Table 2).

The  evaluation  of  the  group  of  subjects  included  in  the  March  2017  interim  analysis  and  the 
complementary  subgroup  revealed  a  comparable  distribution  of  demographic and  baseline  disease 
characteristics  (Table  3  and  Table  4)  such  as  age  and  sex.  A  more  unbalanced  distribution  was 
observed for ECOG, PD-L1 expression status, and the geographic region where subjects were enrolled.

Baseline  performance  status  varied  substantially  between  the  two  groups  with  79.3%  of  subjects 
included in the March 2017 interim analysis being assessed as ECOG 0 at baseline versus 56.3% of 
subjects in the complementary subgroup. Improved baseline performance status has been associated 
with  better  outcomes  in  clinical  trials  of  solid  tumors  with  both  immunotherapy  as  well  as 
chemotherapeutic agents. In the overall study population, subjects with a performance status of ECOG 
1 overall showed a lower objective response rate compared to subjects assessed as ECOG 0 (27.3% 
vs. 47.2%; Refer to Table 15.2.1.8) as well as a lower durable response rate (22.7% vs. 34.7%; Refer 
to Table 15.2.5.7). 
Comparison  of  the  two  study  groups  also  showed  a  considerable  difference  in  the  distribution  of 
subjects whose tumors expressed PD-L1 with a cutoff of ≥ 1% tumor cell staining. The prevalence of 
subjects with PD-L1 ≥ 1% in the subset of subjects evaluated in the March 2017 interim analysis was 
31.0%  vs.  13.8% in  the  complementary  subgroup.  PD-L1  expression  has  been  widely discussed 
as  a  predictive  biomarker in  immuno-oncology  trials,  however,  its effect  in  metastatic  MCC  has  not 
been validated. The overall study results show numerically higher response rates in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% 
subgroup compared to the PD-L1-negative subgroup with an objective response rate of 61.9% (95% 
CI:  38.4,81.9)  vs  33.3%  (95%  CI:  23.6,44.3)  and  durable  response  rate  of  47.6%  (95%  CI: 
25.7,70.2) vs 25.3% (95% CI: 16.6, 35.7), respectively. 
In summary, the imbalances in PD-L1 ≥1% status and ECOG performance status between the subsets 
defined by date of enrollment could in part explain the observed difference in ORR and DRR for the 
two subsets of subjects. 
It should be noted though that the number of subjects within the two subgroups varied substantially, 
with only a quarter of the total study population being reflected in the March 2017 interim analysis. As 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/333708/2020  
Page 22/25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
the absolute number of subjects was low with only 29 of 116 subjects evaluated at the interim, the 
direct comparison of the two subsets of subjects is impacted by the wide confidence intervals pertaining 
to the analyses of the 29 subjects. 
Assessment 
The Applicant provided the information as requested. The differences in ECOG and PD-L1 status 
between the 29 patients in the IA and the 87 accrued afterwards until EOS are highlighted. It seems 
reasonable that the difference may be at least partially explained by the baseline characteristics of 
early versus late recruited patients.  
Issue solved. 
Comment 2 
The  differential  effect  of  avelumab  (DRR,  ORR)  by  biomarker  subgroup  (PD-L1  expression in  tumor 
cells,  density  of  CD8+  T  cells  at  invasive  margin  and  Merkel  cell  virus  tumor  status)  and  their 
combination should be discussed by the MAH.  Please discuss implications for  clinical utility in these 
subpopulations, including the potential value of such biomarkers for making treatment decisions. 
Response 
Avelumab  displays  efficacy  in  Merkel  cell  carcinoma  in  all  subjects  regardless  of  PD-L1  expression, 
Merkel  cell  polyoma  virus  status,  or  %  CD8+  T  cells  at  the  invasive  margin.  Clinically  meaningful 
objective response rate (ORR) and durable response rate (DRR) results were observed in all analyzed 
subgroups. 
As  discussed  in  Sponsor’s  Response  No.  1  above,  observed  response  rates  in  the  overall  study 
population are higher in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% subgroup compared to the PD-L1-negative subgroup, with 
an ORR of 61.9% (95% CI: 38.4,81.9) vs 33.3% (95% CI: 23.6, 44.3) and DRR of 47.6% (95% CI: 
25.7,70.2) vs 25.3% (95% CI: 16.6,35.7). Despite this trend, the ORR and DRR in the PD-L1-negative 
subgroup are also substantial and clinically meaningful, obviating the value of PD-L1 as a biomarker 
for making treatment decisions. As such, the statement, “The clinical utility of PD-L1 as a predictive 
biomarker in MCC has not been established" is appropriate and the Sponsor proposes that it remains 
in the EU SmPC as currently included. 
Similarly, clinically meaningful results were obtained for all subjects regardless of Merkel cell polyoma 
virus (MCV) status. The ORR and DRR for subjects with IHC-MCV-positive tumors (n = 70) were 34.3% 
(95%  CI:  23.3,46.6)  and  27.1%  (95%  CI:  17.2,39.1),  respectively.  Although  response  rates  were 
lower  than  those obtained  for  the  subgroup  with IHC-MCV-negative  tumors  (n  =  37),  which  had  an 
ORR of 48.6% (95% CI: 31.9,65.6) and a DRR of 35.1% (95% CI: 20.2,52.5), the IHC-MCV-positive 
subgroup  still  derived  substantial  benefit  from  treatment  and  the  use  of  MCV  status  for  making 
treatment decisions is not supported in Merkel cell carcinoma. 
Subjects with a percentage of CD8+ T cells at the invasive margin that was greater than or equal to 
the median (n = 43) had a higher ORR of 51.2% (95% CI: 35.5,66.7) and DRR of 39.5% (95% CI: 
25.0,55.6) compared to subjects with a percentage of CD8+ T cells at the invasive margin less than 
the median (n = 42) (ORR of 28.6% (95% CI: 15.7,44.6) and DRR of 21.4% (95% CI: 10.3,36.8). As 
is the case for PD-L1 and MCV, the results for both invasive margin CD8+ T cell density subgroups are 
clinically meaningful and do not support the use of percentage of CD8+ T cells at the invasive margin 
as a biomarker for making treatment decisions. 
The highest ORR was reported for subjects with PD-L1-positive and IHC-MCV-negative tumors (n = 10) 
with  an  ORR  of  70.0%  (95%  CI:  34.8,93.3);  the  DRR  for  this  subgroup  was  50.0%  (95%  CI: 
18.7,81.3).  However,  each  subgroup  combining  PD-L1  expression  and  IHC-MCV  status  that  was 
examined demonstrated efficacy of treatment as evidenced by their DRR and ORR results:

Again,  there  is  substantial  treatment  benefit  to  all  subgroups  for  which  the  combined  PD-L1 
expression  and  MCV  status  were  evaluated.  The  use  of  PD-L1  and  MCV  status  in  combination  for 
making treatment decisions is not appropriate. 
Moreover, it is important to note that sample sizes within the subgroups presented are small, leading 
to wide and overlapping confidence intervals in most cases. Because clinically meaningful response 
rates are observed for all subgroups, the clinical utility of PD-L1, Merkel cell virus tumor status, and 
density of CD8+ T cells at the invasive margin as biomarkers has not been established and associated 
diagnostic testing is not indicated for Merkel cell carcinoma. 
Finally, the overall study population was dominated by subjects whose tumors were negative for PD-
L1 expression at the 1% cutoff. Despite the estimated differences in ORR and DRR when compared 
against the PD-L1 ≥ 1% subgroup, the observed median overall survival time of 15.9 months (95% 
CI:  9.6,  not  estimable  (NE))  in  subjects  with  PD-L1  <  1%  tumors,  versus  NE  (95%  CI:  11.3,  not 
estimable (NE)) in subjects with PD-L1 ≥ 1% tumours, suggests that clinical activity of avelumab in 
both  subgroups  defined  by  PD-L1  status  translates  into  favourable  survival  time  when  referenced 
against reported historical data (refer to Table 5 - Clinical Overview Addendum- Datacut May 2019) 
in this disease setting. 
Assessment 
It is reasonable and of interest to the prescriber to know the impact of PD-L1 on efficacy, as this 
seems to be an important effect modifier.  
This is not a claim that the clinical utility of PD-L1 as a predictive biomarker has been established (in 
fact it is unclear precisely what would be meant by this).  
However, conversely, there is no rationale to introduce a statement to deny this, nor to dissuade a 
clinician that wishes to use PD-L1 status as part of the grounds for clinical decision-making. 
Therefore this statement should be removed from the SmPc. 
The company has provided updated AR addressing the Rapporteurs proposal. The final PI is now 
acceptable 
Issue exhausted. 
Comment 3 
A number of amendments to the proposed changes in section 5.1 of the SmPC are proposed. 
Response 
The MAH revised section 5.1 as well as other sections of the avelumab EU PI accordingly, taking 
the comments from Rapporteur in the EU PI and the responses for the request for supplementary 
information into consideration. Please refer to Module 1.3.1 SmPC, Labelling, and Package Leaflet. 
Assessment

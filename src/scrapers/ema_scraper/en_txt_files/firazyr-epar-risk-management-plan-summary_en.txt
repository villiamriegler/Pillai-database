PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for FIRAZYR (icatibant acetate) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for FIRAZYR. The RMP 
details important risks of FIRAZYR, how these risks can be minimised, and how 
more information will be obtained about FIRAZYR's risks and uncertainties (missing 
information). 
FIRAZYR 's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how FIRAZYR 
should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for FIRAZYR should be read in the context of all this 
information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
FIRAZYR 's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for 
FIRAZYR is authorised for symptomatic treatment of acute attacks of HAE in adults, 
adolescents, and children aged 2 years and older with C1-INH deficiency. It contains 
icatibant acetate as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
For centrally authorised medicinal product only:  
Further information about the evaluation of FIRAZYR’s benefits can be found in 
FIRAZYR’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage link to the EPAR summary landing page.

EPAR summary landing page on the EMA webpage. 
 
 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of FIRAZYR, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about FIRAZYR 's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals; 
•  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. 
with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analysed, including periodic safety update report (PSUR) 
assessment so that immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures 
constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of FIRAZYR is not yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of FIRAZYR are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
administered. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified  
 
 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of 
FIRAZYR. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine). 
The safety information in the proposed Product Information is aligned to the 
reference medicinal product.

Overdose (for iv formulation), not known for sc 
formulation. 
Risk minimisation measures 
None proposed.  
At the currently labelled dose and administration form in 
patients with HAE attacks (30 mg per injection given by sc 
administration, and no more than 3 injections of icatibant 
should be administered in a 24-hour period), no systemic 
bradykinin agonistic reactions are expected. 
Various in vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated 
partial bradykinin agonism only at high icatibant 
concentrations.

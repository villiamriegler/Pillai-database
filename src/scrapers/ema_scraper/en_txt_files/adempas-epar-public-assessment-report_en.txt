2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Both, chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (PAH) are rare and life-threatening forms of pulmonary hypertension (PH). Both 
conditions share similar pathological features, and are characterised by pulmonary arterial micro 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 11/118 
 
  
  
vascular remodelling, deregulation in vascular cell proliferation and in situ thrombosis, leading to 
increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR), abnormal pulmonary vascular tone, progressive 
right ventricular dysfunction/failure and, ultimately, premature death. 
CTEPH is a chronic, debilitating disease characterised clinically by dyspnoea, fatigue, chest pain, 
dizziness, peripheral oedema, coughing, haemoptysis, and, in advanced disease, fainting and 
syncope. It most often results from obstruction of the pulmonary vascular bed by non-resolving 
thromboemboli. 
CTEPH can arise in patients after acute or recurrent pulmonary emboli or deep venous 
thrombosis. Increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) subsequently leads to progressive 
pulmonary hypertension and right heart failure. In the non-occluded areas, a pulmonary 
arteriopathy indistinguishable from that of PAH can develop and contribute to disease 
progression. The incidence of CTEPH is not known, but recent studies suggest that 1% to 3.8% 
of patients develop the condition within two years of acute pulmonary embolism. Without 
intervention, the prognosis of patients with CTEPH is poor and depends on the haemodynamic 
severity of pulmonary hypertension. The only potentially curative treatment is surgical removal 
of the obstructive material by pulmonary endarterectomy (PEA). However, a substantial 
percentage of patients with CTEPH are not operable, and 10% to 15% of operated patients suffer 
from persistent pulmonary hypertension. Currently, there are no approved medicines for patients 
with inoperable CTEPH and persistent or recurrent PH following PEA and, therefore, the unmet 
medical need is high. To-date, there is only one multi-centre, randomised, placebo-controlled 
clinical study in patients with CTEPH that showed an effect of bosentan over placebo for PVR but 
not for the 6-minute walking test (6MWT) or time to clinical worsening (TTCW). Thus, the trial 
was positive for one of the pre-defined independent co-primary endpoints (PVR) and not 
supported by the other (6MWD). Several uncontrolled studies have shown moderate benefit of 
PAH-specific medicines in patients with CTEPH. Additionally, CTEPH registry data indicate that 
PAH specific therapies – including endothelin receptor antagonists (ERA) and phosphodiesterase-
5 (PDE5) inhibitors – are frequently used “off-label” in patients with CTEPH, despite there being 
no compelling evidence to support this approach. 
PAH is characterised by vasculopathy with extensive remodelling of the pulmonary circulation 
that results in narrowing of the arterial lumen and impaired flow-mediated vasodilatation. The 
consequent increase in pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance 
(PVR) limits the ability of the right ventricle to pump blood through the lungs, causing shortness 
of breath and reduced physical performance. PAH is a progressive disease, and ultimately leads 
to right heart failure and death. The pathophysiology of PAH is not fully understood, but is 
thought to involve abnormal interactions between endothelial and smooth muscle cells, leading 
to vasoconstriction, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, vascular endothelial proliferation, 
and in situ thrombosis. An up-regulated Endothelin-1 system, defective prostacyclin synthase 
activity, and abnormalities of the nitric oxide (NO) pathway are considered important mediators 
of these pathological changes, and form the therapeutic targets for currently available PAH-
specific therapies [Chin 2008, McGoon 2009]. 
Available pharmacological therapies for PAH address the three target pathways mentioned above 
as probably implicated in the pathogenesis of the disorder: 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 12/118 
 
  
  
ERAs, by inhibiting the effects of elevated Endothelin-1 levels, reduce vasoconstriction, smooth 
muscle cell proliferation and pulmonary vessel fibrosis. 
Prostacyclin analogues relax and reduce proliferation of vascular smooth muscle cells. 
PDE5 inhibitors potentiate the anti-platelet, antiproliferative, and vasodilatory effects of NO. 
There is significant need to develop data that support the emerging practice of combination 
therapy (combinations of PAH-specific medicines targeting different, complementary pathways). 
While combination therapy has mechanistic and biological plausibility, there remains paucity of 
data to support this and in fact several studies have failed to show the benefit of dual oral 
therapy. To-date, only one product has been authorised for use in combination therapy. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing riociguat as active substance.  
Other ingredients are: cellulose microcrystalline, crospovidone, hypromellose, magnesium 
stearate, lactose monohydrate, sodium lauryl sulfate, hydroxypropylcellulose, propylene glycol 
and titanium dioxide. 
The product is available in PP/Aluminium foil blister packs as described in section 6.5 of the 
SmPC.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The chemical name of riociguat is methyl 4,6-diamino-2-[1-(2-fluorobenzyl)-1H-pyrazo-lo[3,4-
b]pyridin-3-yl]-5-pyrimidinyl(methyl)carbamate and has the following structure: 
Figure 1: Chemical structure of riociguat. 
Riociguat is a white to yellowish crystalline powder, not hygroscopic. It is practically insoluble in 
water and shows a strong pH-dependent solubility in aqueous media with a maximum around 
pH 2, slightly soluble in acetone and methanol and freely soluble in dimethylsulfoxide and 
dimethylformamide.  
Riociguat has a non-chiral molecular structure. Polymorphism has been observed for the active 
substance. Riociguat exists in two modifications, i.e. modification I and modification II. 
Modification I is the thermodynamically stable form at room temperature. There are also three 
pseudo-polymorphous solvate forms. The manufacturing process consistently produces the same 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 13/118 
 
  
  
 
                                                     
 
polymorphic form, modification I. The polymorphic form is controlled in the specification of 
riociguat micronized drug substance by XRPD analysis. 
The structure of riociguat is derived from the route of synthesis, from experimental analysis and 
spectral data: IR, Raman, UV VIS, 1H NMR, 13C NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry. In 
addition, elementary analysis and x-ray structural analysis were performed. Full characterization 
of the produced solid state form has been performed. Modifications I and II as well as the 
pseudo-polymorphs and the amorphous form are distinguishable.  
Manufacture 
Micronised riociguat manufacturing process consists of three synthetic steps, two crystallisation 
and one milling step using well defined starting materials with acceptable specifications.  
Due to the low water solubility of riociguat, the milling step of the manufacture of the active 
substance is also a critical step. Therefore, the particle size distribution of the active substance is 
a critical quality attribute controlled in the specification for the active substance. The 
manufacturing process has been developed using elements of Quality by Design (QbD) such as 
risk-assessment, OVAT (One Variable At a Time) experiments and design of experiments.  The 
results of these studies were used to define proven acceptable ranges (PARs) for the different 
steps of the riociguat manufacturing process.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU 
guideline on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well 
discussed with regards to their origin and characterised.  
Impurities presented at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were 
qualified by toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control 
methods for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for: appearance (visual examination), identity 
(IR, HPLC and X-ray Powder Diffractometry), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents 
(GC), heavy metals (ICP-MS) and particle size distribution (Ph. Eur.).  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines.    
Batch analysis data on four commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
The active substance specifications are based on the active substance critical quality attributes 
(CQA). The CQA identified were assay, identity, appearance, particle size distribution, 
polymorphous form, palladium, organic purity, residual solvents and genotoxic impurities. 
Stability 
Stability data on six pilot scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in the intended commercial package 36 months under long term conditions at 25 ºC / 
60% RH and for up to 12 months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following ICH guideline Q1B was 
performed on one batch. The results showed that solid riociguat is not sensitive to light since 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 14/118 
 
  
  
there was no discolorations of the solid, no decrease in the assay and no increase of any 
degradation products. Based on the results obtained, no special protection from light is 
necessary in the production or handling of the solid crystalline active substance. Results on 
stress conditions (thermal, hydrolytic, and oxidative stress conditions) were also provide on one 
batch. The results showed that riociguat is extremely stable under thermal stress conditions in 
solid state and not hygroscopic. In addition, the results showed sufficient stability with regard to 
hydrolytic stress in solution under acidic, neutral and moderate basic conditions in the pH-range 
of pH 7 to pH 9. Only under severe stress test conditions at elevated temperature of 70 °C for 24 
hours at pH 1 some minor degradation was observed. The possible formation of a potentially 
genotoxic impurity under simulated gastric conditions has been specifically investigated. Results 
confirm that the potential formation under the tested conditions would not lead to a daily intake 
of more than 0.5 μg (TTC). Riociguat was less stable under basic conditions. The observed 
degradation is pH-dependent. Under stress test conditions at a pH of 13 (0.1 N NaOH) and 
elevated temperature up to 70°C for 24 hours or time dependent for up to 1 week stored at 25°C 
a complete degradation of Riociguat was observed. Riociguat is sufficiently stable related to 
oxidative stress. Under normal oxidative stress conditions at 25°C/24 hours in presence of 3 % 
H2O2 no degradation was observed.The following parameters were tested: appearance, impurities 
and assay. 
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed 
manufacturer is sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the 
proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The objective of the pharmaceutical development was to provide an oral formulation containing 
riociguat micronized with high convenience and patient compliance. Immediate release tablet 
formulations of small size have been selected as dosage form. The different dose strengths were 
all based on the same basic qualitative composition (with differences only in pigment composition 
of film-coating) and manufacturing process. All dose strengths have been formulated to same 
tablet weight (85 mg plus 2.5 mg film coat) and same size (6 mm diameter). Riociguat tablets 
are film-coated to facilitate swallowing and a colour code design was used to distinguish between 
the different dose strength and to facilitate tablet identification. 
The physicochemical characteristics relevant to the performance of the finished product are 
particle size and dissolution. To facilitate drug dissolution riociguat is micronized by air-jet 
milling. Fast and complete in vitro dissolution has been demonstrated for tablets manufactured 
with micronized riociguat within the specified limits of particle size distribution, whereas tablets 
manufactured with riociguat particle size outside the specified limits showed slower and 
incomplete drug dissolution. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. 
Eur. standards, with the exception of ferric oxide yellow and red which comply with Directive 
2008/128/EC. The excipients have been chosen based on preliminary formulation development 
experience and excipient compatibility studies. Lactose monohydrate and microcrystalline 
cellulose are used as fillers, crospovidone as disintegrant, hypromellose as binder, magnesium 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 15/118 
 
  
  
stearate as lubricant and colloidal silicon dioxide as glidant. Sodium lauryl sulfate improves 
wetting of the active substance and therefore facilitates the granulation process. There are no 
novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
The pharmaceutical development of the finished product contains QbD elements. 
The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as an immediate release dosage form, 
which can be swallowed easily, allows flexible dose adjustments for patients, can be 
distinguished between the different dose strength, that meets compendial and other relevant 
quality standards. 
A risk analysis was performed using the failure mode effect analysis (FMEA) method in order to 
define critical process steps and process parameters that may have an influence on the finished 
product quality attributes. The risk identification was based on the prior knowledge of products 
with similar formulations and manufacturing processes as well as on the experience from 
formulation development, process design and scale-up studies. The critical quality attributes 
(CQAs) identified were assay, uniformity of content and appearance. Critical process parameters 
(CPPs) have also been adequately identified. 
In addition, it has been demonstrated that a change of the polymorphic form under the 
established manufacturing conditions and during storage under climate zone I-IV was not 
expected.  
The dissolution method has been adequately developed and its discriminating capability 
demonstrated. The discriminatory power of the method was monitored using product batches 
manufactured from drug substance with different particle size. The use of surfactant and the 
dissolution medium was justified.  
The formulation development from Phase I to Phase III clinical trials has been adequately 
described. The tablet composition and manufacturing principles were not changed with only one 
exception regarding the colour of the film-coat: the tablets used in clinical studies phase I and II 
were coated in red (titanium dioxide and ferric oxide red as pigment) and in clinical phase III 
studies the colour was changed to pale orange (titanium dioxide, ferric oxide yellow and ferric 
oxide red as pigment). The dissolution profiles obtained for the batches used in the Phase I and 
II and those used in the phase III, using the proposed dissolution method, are comparable.  
The primary packaging is PP/Aluminium foil blister as stated in the SmPC. The material complies 
with Ph.Eur.and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated 
by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition 
as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared 
without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance 
on Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human 
and veterinary medicinal products. 
Manufacture of the product 
The manufacturing process consists of seven main steps: (1) blending, (2) wet-granulation, (3) 
drying,  (4)  post-blending,  (5)  compression,  (6)  coating  and  (7)  packaging.  The  process  is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 16/118 
 
  
  
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  by  a  number  of  studies.  It  has 
been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product 
of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible  manner.  The  in-process  controls  are  adequate  for  this 
pharmaceutical form.  
Proven acceptable ranges have been defined for all steps of the medicinal product. The available 
development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial scale 
batches fully support the proposed PARs. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  tests  for  appearance  (visual  examination), 
identification of riociguat (HPLC and NIR or TLC), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), uniformity of 
dosage unit (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC) and microbial purity (Ph.Eur.).  
Batch analysis results are provided for six pilot scale batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
Stability of the product 
Stability data of 3 pilot scale batches of each strength of the finished product stored under long 
term conditions for 36 months at 25 ºC / 60% RH, under intermediate conditions for 36 months 
at 30 ºC / 75% RH and for up to six months under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of riociguat are identical to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, impurities, assay, microbial purity and dissolution. The 
analytical methods used are stability indicating. 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The results showed that the 
product is stable to light.  
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant has applied Quality by Design (QbD) principles in the development of the active 
substance and finished product and their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces 
were claimed for the manufacturing process of the active substance or finished product. 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished 
product has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to 
the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical 
use.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory 
way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Riociguat (BAY 63-2521) is a soluble guanylate cyclase (sGC) stimulator, a key enzyme in the 
NO-sGC-cGMP pathway. sGC activation increases cellular cGMP concentration which in turn 
activates specific downstream effectors including kinases, phosphodiesterases and ion channels, 
resulting e.g. in vasorelaxation, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation and migration.  
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In multiple in vitro studies it was shown that riociguat is a potent stimulator of sGC (as measured 
increase in the cellular cGMP concentration) in the nM to low µM concentrations. Further 
increases in cellular cGMP can be induced by combination of riociguat with a NO donor. Riociguat 
also has vasorelaxing effect on isolated vessels (including nitrate tolerant vessels), various 
tissues and perfused heart. Relatively large variations in inhibitory concentration (50% inhibition) 
(IC50) values are seen between studies, however in most studies IC50 values ranged between 
high nM, sub-µM concentrations. Available data suggests that the main action of riociguat is 
through reversible stimulation of the α1/β1 subunit of sGC with a smaller contribution by the 
α2/β1 isoform. It appears that disease state of the tissue does not lead to a reduction in in 
sGCα1/β1 expression, and may even increase sGCα1/β1 expression, and thus will not negatively 
affect the potential beneficial effect of riociguat on the disease 
The in vivo hemodynamic effects of riociguat have been investigated in healthy animals, 
spontaneous hypertensive rats (SHR) and three models of progressive pulmonary arterial 
hypertension, (i.e. the hypoxia-induced PAH in mice, monocrotaline injection in rats and 
combined hypoxia and VEGF receptor inhibition in rats (SUHx model)). In healthy rats, dogs and 
spontaneous hypertensive rats, riociguat-mediated effects were dose-dependent reduction in 
systemic blood pressure and a compensatory increase in heart rate. In dog more parameters 
were evaluated and the additional treatment-related effects were: reduced left ventricle pressure 
and pulmonary pressure and increases in cardiac output, coronary blood flow, oxygen saturation 
and contractility. In all three animal models of progressive PAH disease, decreased progression 
or full inhibition of disease progression was observed, but no improvement of disease parameters 
to levels seen in healthy controls. Compared to untreated disease-controls riociguat-treatment 
resulted in a decrease in pulmonary vascular resistance, right ventricular systolic pressure and 
right heart hypertrophy. In all three models, riociguat had no effect on systemic blood pressure.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 18/118 
 
  
  
Hemodynamic effects of riociguat (e.g. systemic blood pressure lowering, cardiac output 
increase, reduction in peripheral resistance, heart rate increase) are expected in all different 
disease models of PAH. Such effects were shown in the model of “PH induced by hypoxia and 
SU5416” and U46619-induced PH. The hemodynamic assessment was performed 24h after the 
last oral administration of riociguat (at trough levels) and not continuously during the course of 
the study. This might explain the missing data on the decrease in systemic blood pressure in the 
experimental PAH models under riociguat treatment. 
In the animal model that most closely mimics the human PAH pathology (SUHx), a reduction in 
disease-related pulmonary remodelling (vascular muscularization, occlusive lesions, medial wall 
thickening) was observed following riociguat treatment. Of note, the dose commonly used in the 
disease model was 10 mg/kg/day, which is relatively high based on effects seen in healthy 
animals. This result, taken together the pharmacodynamic effect seen in the in vivo studies with 
riociguat, is consistent with its mechanism of action, i.e. stimulation of the NO-sGC-cGMP 
pathway, leading to vasodilatation. 
The pharmacodynamic effects of the main metabolite (M-1, or BAY 60-4552) have also been 
investigated in in vitro and in vivo studies, and have also been investigated in clinical 
development. The data indicate that M1 has the same pharmacodynamics effects as the parent 
albeit somewhat less potent (pharmacological activity: 1/10th to 1/3rd of riociguat).  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
As part of the secondary pharmacology studies, specificity studies have been performed for 
riociguat and its metabolite M1. Data indicate that riociguat and M1 are specific for sGC, do not 
interfere with other enzymes of the NO-sGC-cGMP pathway, and do not stimulate membrane-
bound guanylate cyclase receptors at to concentrations up to 10 µM. 
Signalling through sGC has been implicated in other physiological processes such as 
antiaggregation and neuronal signalling. Indeed, activation of the sGC-cGMP pathway by 
riociguat in human and rat platelets has been demonstrated in vitro.  
Furthermore, in vivo studies indicate that riociguat can prolong bleeding time and reduce clot 
formation. In vitro, riociguat shows effects on platelet function at high, in vivo non-relevant 
concentrations. Thus, the slight effects on rat tail transection bleeding time is considered not to 
be related to the cGMP-related effects on platelets, but rather a consequence of the strong 
vasodilative effects of riociguat. Furthermore, investigation of platelet aggregation, bleeding time 
and interaction of riociguat and warfarin in healthy human volunteers did not show any anti-
platelet effects as seen in preclinical investigation. Therefore, it is considered highly unlikely that 
the observed bleeding events in riociguat-treated patients are caused by an anti-platelet effect of 
riociguat.  
It is known that sGC signalling also plays a role in neuronal signalling. No attempt to test the 
effect of riociguat in neurological models functions has been made. Based on the results in the 
safety pharmacology studies, it appears that riociguat does not have an immediate detrimental 
effect on CNS. Furthermore, no behaviour effects were noted in the repeated dose toxicity 
studies. Therefore, based on the assessment of the current data, riociguat does not have a 
significant biological effect on neuronal signalling. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 19/118 
 
  
  
It has been suggested that the NO-sCG-cGMP signalling pathway is also involved in migration of 
smooth muscle cells, and riociguat –inhibited the migration of human coronary artery vascular 
smooth muscle cells in vitro. 
As may be expected based on the mechanism of action, riociguat was found to have an effect on 
the erectile response in rabbits. Riociguat treatment reduced the atherosclerotic plaque formation 
in Apo E-deficient mice. Furthermore, riociguat reduced blood pressure in several animal models 
of hypertension and decreased hypertension-related tissue damage or tissue remodelling in the 
used animal models. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
The effect of riociguat and its main metabolite M-1 on vital organs (cardiovascular system 
including electrocardiogram (ECG), respiratory system and central nervous system) as well as on 
supplemental organ functions (gastrointestinal function, renal function, metabolism (glucose, 
lipids) and blood) was investigated in several in vitro and single dose in vivo studies. 
In vitro studies (hERG assay and a rabbit cardiac Purkinje fibre action potential assay) do not 
indicate potential adverse effect at clinical relevant concentrations.  
In in vivo studies in dogs, shortening of QT was seen due to increased heart rate. Correction of 
the QT interval for the increased heart rate was performed using several formulae. QT interval 
was corrected for heart rate (QTc) using Bazett’s (QTcB), Fridericia’s (QTcF) and van de Water’s 
(QTcV) formula. A small but significant increase in QTcB and QTcF was seen but not QTcV. Thus, 
the interpretation of the potential of riociguat to prolong QT interval in dogs depends on the used 
formula. While overall the data suggest that the QTc prolongation potential is not high, the dog 
data do not unambiguously show a lack of potential for QTc prolongation.  
However, in humans no increased risk of QT prolongation was observed, but the data set was 
quite limited.  
No substantial effects on respiration and lung mechanics or CNS parameters were seen. Riociguat 
treatment did reduce gastric motility in vivo and ilial contraction in vitro. A slight increase in 
blood glucose and a clear decrease in urine volume were noted immediately following a single 
dose of riociguat. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Several in vivo studies have been performed on the effects on hemodynamic parameters of the 
combination of riociguat with a PDE5 inhibitor (vardenafil or sildenafil). In general, co-
administration of riociguat with vardenafil/sildenafil resulted in additive effects on 
haemodynamics. In an acute model of PAH, sildenafil appeared more selective in reducing 
pulmonary arterial hypertension vs. systemic blood pressure than riociguat, and the combination 
of sildenafil with riociguat appeared to have an even improved pulmonary selectivity. In dogs it 
was found that glycerol trinitrate maintains its acute blood pressure lowering effect in presence 
of riociguat. 
Riociguat further increased the acetylsalicylic acid-associated prolonged bleeding time, but did 
not further prolong the bleeding time when combined with rivaroxaban, clopidogrel or iloprost.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption  
Absorption of riociguat is rapid and around 60-65% in rat and about 80% in dog. The 
bioavailability is high in humans (94%) and lower in dogs (approximately 50-70%) and rats 
(approximately 35-65%). At comparable doses, exposure to riociguat is higher in dog than in rat. 
Pharmacokinetics of riociguat are linear with dose in dog over the dose range 0.03 to 2 mg/kg 
and less than dose-proportional in the dose range 2 to 6 mg/kg. In rats, more than dose-
proportional kinetics are seen over the dose range 0.3 to 3 mg/kg, and linear kinetics up to 40 
mg/kg. Regarding the metabolite M-1, exposure in rats increases proportionally with dose in the 
dose range 2.5 to 40 mg/kg. In dogs the exposure increases proportionally in the dose range 0.3 
to 1 mg/kg. Less than dose-proportional increases are seen in dogs up to 3 mg/kg. Generally, a 
slight or moderate accumulation in riociguat and M-1 exposure after repeated dosing is observed 
in rat and dog.  
Distribution 
Plasma clearance is moderate in rat and dog and accompanied by a moderate volume of 
distribution, indicating distribution into tissues. The plasma half-lives are short in both rat and 
dog with ~1-2 hours. The half-life of the pharmacologically active metabolite M-1 
(pharmacological activity 1/10th to 1/3rd of parent) is determined in dog and amounts to ~5 
hours. The terminal half-life of the total radioactivity is much longer (90 hours in dog and 9 to 17 
hours in rat) indicating the presence of metabolites with longer half-lives. 
The free fraction of riociguat in plasma is moderate to low with an unbound fraction (fu) in rat, 
dog and mouse of 15-20% and of 4-5% in human and rabbit. The plasma protein binding is pH 
and NEFAs-presence dependent; it increases with decreasing pH and decreases with NEFAs. In 
addition, when co-administered with salicylic acid, riociguat free fraction increases 1.5-fold. In 
rat and dog, riociguat was almost equally distributed between plasma and erythrocytes. In 
humans on the other hand, the plasma to blood ratio of riociguat indicates the presence of more 
riociguat in plasma compared to the erythrocytes. 
Riociguat is rapidly and widely distributed to tissues, except in seminal vesicles and testes 
revealing a delayed uptake of radioactivity. Organs with the highest radioactivity 24 hours after 
administration were organs/tissues involved in riociguat and its related radioactivity elimination. 
Accumulation in human skin and eye could occur. Repeated versus single dosing revealed an 
increase in radioactivity for most organs, with a possible risk for accumulation after repeated 
dosing in adrenal tissue, kidney, liver, lung, skin, spleen, thyroid, bone marrow, testes, and 
aorta wall. The blood-to-brain and blood-to-testes penetration of radioactivity was low. 
Riociguat-related radioactivity is able to cross the placenta in rats.  
Metabolism 
Riociguat is metabolised to various metabolites in vitro and in vivo. The major metabolites in 
human plasma are M-1 (N-demethylation of riociguat) and M-4 (N-glucuronide of M-1).  
In vitro experiments using clinically relevant concentrations of riociguat showed that 4 CYP 
isoforms are involved in the biotransformation of riociguat to M-1, namely CYP1A1, 2J2, 3A4 and 
3A5. CYP1A1 is the major enzyme involved in the M-1 formation. A high inter-individual 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 21/118 
 
  
  
variability in the plasma concentration-time curves of riociguat was observed in man. This could 
be explained by the involvement of the highly inducible CYP1A1. In section 4.4 of the SmPC, it is 
stated that “concomitant use of riociguat with strong CYP1A1 inhibitors, such as the tyrosine 
kinase inhibitor erlotinib, and strong P-gp/ breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) inhibitors, 
such as the immuno-suppressive agent cyclosporine A, may increase riociguat exposure. These 
drugs should be used with caution. Blood pressure should be monitored and dose reduction of 
riociguat be considered (see SmPC sections 4.5 and 5.2)”. In individuals without or with a low 
CYP1A1 activity, the same kinetics of riociguat can be observed as in individuals with normal 
CYP1A1 activity that also use strong CYP1A1 inhibitors. 
The ratio between the active metabolite M-1 and parent compound differs largely across the 
non-clinical species.  
Excretion 
Drugs inhibiting UGT1A1 and UGT1A9 may lead to significant changes in the elimination 
pathways of M-1, , and as a consequence in the pharmacology. Drug-drug interactions via UGTs 
can therefore not be excluded. The inhibitory potency of potential co-medications including 
mefenamic acid, diflunisal and atazanavir on the glucuronidation of M-1 was determined and 
IC50 values amounted to 47 μM, 24 μM and >10 μM. DDI potential was assessed by using 
Cmax,u/IC50 ratios. These values are not reassuring, since IC50 values should be compared to 
50 × Cmax,unbound as is stated in the EMA guideline on drug-drug interactions. In the absence of 
further data, the applicant has added a warning to section 4.5 of the SmPC stating the possibility 
of interactions with drugs that are inhibitors of UGT1A1 and/or 1A9. 
Noticeable differences in excretion and metabolic profile in the excreta were observed between 
the species. Riociguat is primarily excreted via the faecal/biliary route (approx.70-80%) in rat 
and dog, mainly as parent compound in rat and as M-1 and M-4 in dog. The renal route 
accounted for approx. 10-20%, and active secretion of parent and metabolites by 
gastrointestinal mucosa is another possible route of excretion observed in rats. Enterohepatic 
recirculation cannot be ruled out. Riociguat is also secreted in rat milk. In humans, excretion of 
riociguat occurred almost equally via the renal (approx. 30-45%) and faecal/biliary (approx. 45-
60%) route, mainly as parent compound or as M-1. This ratio and the metabolic profile vary per 
individual subject and are dependent on the biotransformation rate.  
Riociguat is a substrate for P-glycoprotein, BCRP and OCT2 but not a substrate for OATP1B1, 
OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, and OCT3 at the investigated concentrations. M-1 is a substrate 
for P-glycoprotein and BCRP but not a substrate for OCT1, OCT2 and OCT3 at the investigated 
concentrations.  
The applicant indicated that riociguat and M-1 are not substrates for OAT1 and OAT3 at 
concentrations of 0.3 μM and 3 μM. For riociguat, this is in line with the fact that the renal 
clearance of riociguat in humans was approximately the normal glomerular filtration rate (when 
considering a fraction unbound of 5% in human plasma). Thus, riociguat is not actively secreted 
via the kidneys. The applicant has agreed to determine the substrate characteristics towards 
OAT1 and OAT3 at the lowest feasible concentration using 3H-labelled compound, under the 
prerequisite that the synthesis of 3H-labeled compound is successful. In addition, the applicant 
agrees to determine the substrate characteristics towards OCT1, OCT3 (riociguat and M-1) and 
OCT2 (M-1) at the lowest feasible concentrations. Based on current results, lowest achievable 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 22/118 
 
  
  
test concentrations are in the range of 150 nM, but lower concentrations might be feasible when 
3H labelled compound is available. The reports are expected to be available by end of 2014. 
According to the EMA Drug-Drug-Interaction (DDI) guideline the provision of the studies for M1 is 
imperative. The outcome of the study directly relates to predicting DDI in clinical practice and is 
relevant for warnings in the SmPC. The applicant has included this study as a category 3 study in 
the RMP (see also the Obligation to complete post-authorisation measures in the 
Recommendations section of this report). 
The concentrations used to test the inhibitory potential of M-1 covered the clinically relevant 
plasma concentration range. No inhibition of the OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 
transporters at these clinically relevant concentrations by M-1 was observed. At clinical relevant 
concentrations of riociguat and M-1 no significant inhibition of BSEP is expected. 
The applicant will provide a study to determine the inhibitory potential of M-1 towards MATE1 
and MATE2 in overexpressing cells. The report will be available in May 2014. The applicant 
further agrees that if this study indicates that riociguat and M-1 are inhibitors of one of these 
transporters, the SmPC will be changed accordingly. According to the EMA Drug-Drug-Interaction 
guideline the provision of this study is imperative. The study outcome directly relates to 
predicting DDI in clinical practice and is relevant for warnings in the SmPC. The applicant has 
therefore included this study as a category 3 study in the RMP (see also the Obligation to 
complete post-authorisation measures in the Recommendations section of this report). 
Riociguat and M-1 are no inhibitors of UGTs and SULT at clinically relevant concentrations.  
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
After intravenous administration, mortality occurred at 30 mg/kg in mice. After oral 
administration, the acute toxicity in mice and rats was low. Lethality occurred at 2000 mg/kg, 
whereas 300 mg/kg was the highest non-lethal dose. Overt symptoms, which preceded 
mortality, were piloerection, remotility, uncoordinated gait, hunched posture, laboured breathing, 
narrowed palpebral fissure, closed eyelids, diarrhoea and reduced body weight gain. Necropsy 
revealed no specific cause of death, but pathology findings in rats (gas-filled stomach; dark-red 
discolorations of lung and adrenal glands) suggest that smooth muscle cell relaxation and 
exaggerated haemodynamic effects of riociguat have also contributed to the high-dose mortality. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat-dose toxicity studies by oral gavage were conducted up to 26 weeks in rats and in dogs 
up to 52 weeks at exposures of riociguat up to 10-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively, when 
compared to human exposure at the MRHD. In addition, in rats and mice, dose-range findings 
studies up to 13 weeks were performed to support dose selection for the carcinogenicity studies. 
Diet admixture was chosen in these studies to obtain constant plasma levels. In addition, for M-1 
metabolite, a complete set of oral repeat-dose toxicity studies up to 13 weeks in mice, 26 weeks 
in rats and 39 weeks in dogs was performed.  
In mice, the dose-limiting effect was reduced gastro-intestinal tract mobility. Overt symptoms 
(distended abdomen, increased girth and reduced general conditions) indicated that the mode of

action is related to exaggerated pharmacodynamic effects of riociguat, i.e. smooth muscle 
relaxation in the gastro-intestinal tract. Motility disturbances in the intestine, accompanied by 
diarrhoea, dysbiosis and by the prominent presence of vacuolated Paneth cells (which produce 
antimicrobial products) along the gastro-intestinal mucosa, led to chronic erosive and ulcerative 
typhlitis and colitis with regenerative mucosal hyperplasia in the jejunum, ileum and caecum. In 
the high dose range, effects were observed in the liver (centrilobular hypertrophy, dilated gall 
bladder), bone marrow (increased myelopoiesis), hematopoietic system (slight anaemia), leading 
to increased haematopoiesis in the liver and spleen, adrenal glands (reduced vacuolation of de 
zona fasciculate), thymus (atrophy), testes (slightly increased apoptosis), ovaries (less corpora 
lutea) and uterus (atrophy). The number of thrombocytes was not increased, or only moderately 
increased. Coagulation times were not measured, but thrombotic events were not reported. In 
the 13-week study, the NOAEL was established at 16 ppm (≈6 mg/kg/day) for females and at 80 
ppm (≈24 mg/kg/day) for males. At these NOAELs, the exposure of riociguat is in the same 
range as compared with that in human at the maximum recommended human dose (MRHD), 
based on AUC. 
In rats, the NOAEL was established at 10 mg/kg/day for females and at 2.5 mg/kg/day for 
males, based on the results of the 26-week study. At these NOAELs, the exposure of riociguat is 
in the same range as compared with that in human at the MRHD, based on AUC. At higher 
exposures, the observed effects were essentially the same as those in mice. Pharmacodynamic 
effects related to smooth muscle relaxation included overt symptoms (penile erection, reddening 
of the ears and extremities), increased girth, reduced gastrointestinal mobility, accompanied by 
Paneth cell hypertrophy, dilated intestine and vasodilatation of the mesenteric veins. There were 
no inflammatory reactions. Other effects included effects on the adrenals (increased zona 
glomerulosa), thymus (variability in weight), prostate (slightly decreased weight), and seminal 
vesicles (slightly decreased weight). Other findings, not seen in mice, included bile duct 
hyperplasia and periportal inflammation in the liver. Haematological investigation showed slightly 
increased counts of leucocytes and lymphocytes. The spleen showed slightly increased 
haematopoiesis, but blood cell parameters and blood coagulation were without toxicologically 
relevant changes. Other target organs than those in mice included the heart (swelling of the 
arterial media of the left ventricle) and kidney (increased weight, pigmented proximal tubules, 
tubular casts). Rats also showed hypertrophy of the parathyroid gland, leading to increased 
calcium levels in plasma. Other findings included bone (diaphysal) remodelling and hyperosteosis 
in growing adolescent rats upon repeated administration of riociguat or M-1. In addition, 
hyperplasia of the parathyroid glands was observed in the rat carcinogenicity study. Although 
parathyroid hormone levels have not been measured, the findings could not be no correlated 
with changes in calcium and phosphate levels plasma. These data do not suggest that treatment 
with riociguat could lead to demineralization of bone. A risk of osteoporosis in human by 
treatment with riociguat is not expected. However, the implications of the adverse effects on 
bone encountered in growing rats on paediatric patients in whom the epiphysis is not yet closed 
are not clear. Therefore, based on the assessment of the current data, the use of riociguat in 
children and in growing adolescents should be avoided (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC).  
In rats the thyroid is one of the organs that show accumulation of riociguat and/or its 
metabolites. In a 26-week mechanistic study addressing the effect of riociguat on bone 
morphology and bone mineral density, there were slight, but significant effects on the thyroid at 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 24/118 
 
  
  
the mid dose and higher, including decreased thyroid weight and decreased T3 levels in plasma. 
Reduced T3 relative to the control group was also reported in the rat 26 week study and the dog 
52 week study. In 13 and 28-weeks repeated dose toxicity in rats focussed on the metabolite 
M1, decreases in T3 were often accompanied by increased T4 and TSH levels in plasma. There 
was no histological correlate for these findings. 
Adverse effects on thyroid function are not expected in the clinical setting, as the 
feedback/control of thyroid hormone works quite well in human. Rats are particularly sensitive to 
changes in T3 and T4, as in the blood of this species contains no thyroxin binding globulin, in 
contrast to most other mammals, including humans. Thyroxin binding globulin binds more than 
90% of the thyroid hormone in the blood and in this way form a buffer against large fluctuations 
in the T3 and T4 production. With this knowledge, the lack of relevant changes in plasma T3 and 
T4 in the dog studies could be explained.  
In dogs, the toxicology profile was dominated by the exaggerated hemodynamic effects of 
vasodilation. These effects started at human therapeutic exposure levels. The gastro-intestinal 
system and the cardiovascular system were the most sensitive. The effects on the gastro-
intestinal system included vomiting and diarrhoea. Effects on the cardiovascular system included 
reduced blood pressure and reflex tachycardia, accompanied by morphological changes in the 
myocardium (oedema, endocarditis) and coronary arteries (vascular hypertrophy).  Although 
considered to be adverse, the effects on cardiovascular system are considered to be the result of 
exaggerated pharmacodynamic effect of blood pressure reduction in healthy animals. Dogs are 
particularly sensitive to hemodynamic changes and related coronary vascular and myocardial 
effects. In patients with pulmonary hypertension consequent pathology in the heart and 
vasculature would not arise by riociguat, since riociguat is intended to correct pulmonary 
vascular resistance, systolic blood pressure and cardiac output.  
The adrenal hypertrophy of the zona glomerulosa may be the result of the vasodilatory 
properties of riociguat through activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, a reflex 
response to a prolonged reduction in blood pressure. In the 13- and 26-weeks study, there was a 
slight QT prolongation after correction for heart rate. Considering that in vitro and in vivo safety 
pharmacology investigations did not reveal evidence for a cardiovascular risk, the slight QT 
prolongation is considered to reflect an incomplete correction for the reflex tachycardia. There 
were no relevant changes in red and white blood cell parameters and in blood coagulation. At the 
high dose, there was a transient decrease in T4 (week 6) which returned to normal later on, 
whereas T3 levels, being significantly low in week 13, stayed low for the males, but returned to 
normal for females. The relevance of this finding for human is not clear. Based on the results of 
the 52-week study, the NOAEL in dogs was established at 0.5 mg/kg/day in males and females. 
At these NOAELs, the exposure of riociguat is in the same range as compared with that in human 
at the MRHD, based on AUC.  
Genotoxicity 
Riociguat is considered not to be genotoxic. It was non-mutagenic in in-vitro mutation tests in 
bacteria (Ames test). It did not induce chromosomal aberrations in mammalian cells in vitro 
(Chinese hamster V9 cells) and in vivo in a bone marrow micronucleus test and a bone marrow 
cytogenetic assay, both in mice. The major metabolite of riociguat (=M1) was not mutagenic in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 25/118 
 
  
  
bacteria (Ames test) and not clastogenic in mammalian cells in vitro (Chinese hamster V9 cells) 
and an in vivo micronucleus test in mice.  
Carcinogenicity 
The carcinogenic potential of riociguat was tested in 2-year oral studies in mice and rats by diet 
administration.  
Mice showed low gastro-intestinal tract tolerability. Due to the mode of action-related smooth 
muscle cell relaxation, reduction in motility, dysbiosis and subsequent chronic inflammation as 
well as mucosal degeneration and regenerative hyperplasia developed. These changes resulted in 
an increased intercurrent mortality in high dose males as well as large bowel adenocarcinomas in 
two females at the mid dose (two times human exposure at MRHD) and in one male at the high 
dose (three times human exposure at MRHD). The tumours were localized in the caecum 
(females) or in the colon infiltrating the caecum (males). Considering that the underlying 
gastrointestinal lesions were mouse-specific, these tumours are not relevant for human. Other 
major reasons for non-treatment-related intercurrent mortality and evenly distributed throughout 
all groups were fatal amyloidosis in several organs and systemic tumours as common 
background. In testes, the low incidence of benign Leydig cell tumours was covered by data from 
historical controls.  
In rats, gastrointestinal inflammation and reactive hyperplasia were not observed and, 
consequently, gastro-intestinal tumours were not found. Neoplastic and hyperplastic lesions were 
randomly distributed among all groups, including the controls. However, as in mice, low 
incidence of benign Leydig cell tumours was covered by data from historical controls.  
There was a slight increase in the number of benign tumours in the adrenal medulla. Since this 
increase was statistically not significant, this finding is not considered to be relevant for human. 
The most common causes of death were chronic progressive nephropathy, tumours (benign and 
malignant), inflammation and thrombosis (heart, kidneys and other organs). In the decedent 
animals, there was an increased incidence of cardiac enlargement and atrial thrombosis in the 
high-dose males as compared to data from historical controls. The cause of the atrial thrombotic 
events is not clear. There were no relevant changes in blood cell parameters and blood 
coagulation, but there was an association with cardiac enlargement. Patients with pulmonary 
hypertension generally have generally an enlarged heart. An enlarged atrium is susceptible to 
thrombosis, if atrial fibrillation occurs.  
Available data on safety pharmacology do not point to a proarrhythmic potential of riociguat. At 
three different functional levels, e.g. by in-vitro hERG assay, ex vivo Langendorf assays in rat 
hearts and in vivo in anesthetized telemetry as well as conscious telemetered dogs, there was no 
proarrhythmic potential of riociguat and/or the metabolite M1 at clinical relevant concentrations 
Atrial fibrosis is one of the common motives seen with clinical atrial fibrillation is, often in 
association with aging. In the 26-week repeated-dose toxicity in rats, ventricular fibrosis has 
been seen, but at a low incidence and only in the high-dose males (1 out 20 animals at 40 
mg/kg/day). In the rat carcinogenicity study, focal fibrosis in the heart was observed at low 
incidences in mid- and high-dose males and females, but without a clear dose relationship (1 out 
50 males at 10 mg/kg/day and 20 mg/kg/day; 1 out 50 females at 10 mg/kg/day and 2 out 50 
females at 20 mg/kg/day). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 26/118 
 
  
  
Based on these nonclinical data, there is no clear basis to conclude that the small increase in 
number deaths by atrial thrombosis in the rat carcinogenicity is study is related to atrial 
thrombosis. The CHMP and PRAC agreed that atrial fibrillation is not an identified risk, but did 
classify it as a potential risk which has been included in the in the Risk Management Plan.  
Pharmacokinetics show higher concentrations of riociguat and/or its metabolites in the kidney. 
This can be explained by the excretory function of the kidney. However, the possibility cannot be 
excluded that the enrichment of [14C]riociguat-induced radioactivity in the kidneys of rats 
represents a substance accumulation in the kidneys. The effects of riociguat have been 
investigated in various experimental models of kidney disease. These data show that riociguat 
has renoprotective, but not renotoxic, effects in animals. Metabolite M-1 demonstrated kidney 
toxicity only at high doses in rats, but not in mice or dogs. Overall, the preclinical data give no 
indication for a nephrotoxic effect of riociguat at therapeutically relevant doses. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
In Segment I studies in rats, there were no effects on male and female fertility. At the high dose, 
the time to insemination was prolonged; absolute testes weights were slightly decreased, 
whereas relative testes weight was unaffected.  
In Segment II studies in rats and rabbits, the profile of riociguat was mainly related to the 
haemodynamic effects of riociguat. In rats, at dose levels showing clear-cut maternal toxicity due 
to blood pressure reduction, an increase in cardiac malformations (ventricular septal defects) and 
an increase in the overall percentage of foetuses with skeletal malformations per group were 
observed. Placental hypoperfusion and obstruction may cause a reduced supply of nutrients to 
the embryonic tissues, which can affect development and growth of embryonic structures or 
result in tissue loss. The increase in cardiac malformations in the rat is therefore considered to 
be an impact of exaggerated pharmacodynamics rather than a separate teratogenic potential of 
the molecule itself.  
In rabbits, increased placental weights and a higher incidence of partly necrotic placentas were 
seen. In addition, abortion and total resorption were observed. The low safety margin at the 
NOAEL's (AUC unbound 1.7-fold in the rat and 1.2-fold in the rabbit of the human MRHD) can be 
accepted as riociguat is contraindicated in pregnancy (see sections 4.3, 4.6 and 5.3 of the 
SmPC). 
Riociguat may be secreted into rat milk. However, the absolute amount is low, i.e. in the range 
of a few % of the dose. In the absence of human data, due to the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in nursing infants riociguat should not be used during breast-feeding (see section 4.6 of 
the SmPC).  
Juvenile toxicity 
The exposure to neonatal rats to riociguat and the metabolite M-1 was clearly higher compared 
to juvenile and adult rats.  
In juvenile rats, riociguat-related effects on bone morphology were observed. In juvenile rats 
treated at doses of > 10 mg/kg/day with riociguat treatment starting at postnatal day (PND) 6 
over a treatment period of about 3 weeks, thickening of trabecular bone and hypercellularity 
consisting of activated osteoblasts and osteoclasts were observed, and in addition hyperostosis 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 27/118 
 
  
  
and remodelling in the metaphyseal and diaphyseal bone was found. In contrast, in juvenile rats 
treated for 14 weeks starting at PND 6 with riociguat doses of up to 3 mg/kg/day, no 
histopathological observations were made in the femur. The effects on bone metabolism and 
morphology in juvenile rats seem to be due to the sGC stimulating effects of Riociguat. In studies 
on endothelial NO synthase gene-deficient mice, it has been demonstrated that eNOS is involved 
in the postnatal regulation of bone mass, and lack of the eNOS gene results in reduced bone 
formation and volume which is related to impaired osteoblast function (Aguirre et al. 2001). 
Furthermore, cGMP is involved in chondrocyte differentiation via activation of protein kinase G II 
(PKGII). The PKGII knockout mice are dwarfs that develop short bones due to a defect in 
endochondral ossification at the endochondral plate of bones during development (Pfeifer et al. 
1996). Additionally, PKGII-deficient rats exhibited an expanded growth plate, impaired bone 
healing, and an accumulation of postmitotic but nonhypertrophic cells (Chikuda H. et al 2004). 
Until more is known about the implications of these findings, the use of riociguat should be 
avoided in children and in adolescents that are still growing. This is reflected in sections 4.2, 4.4 
and 5.3 of the SmPC.  
Phototoxicity 
Riociguat shows light absorption in the range of 290 to 720 nm and it reaches the skin. The 
outcome of the 3T3 NRU (Neutral Red Uptake) Phototoxicity Assay was equivocal, but, based on 
the negative outcome of the LLNA test in mice, riociguat is not considered to be phototoxic in 
vivo. 
Immunotoxicity 
No specific immunotoxicity studies were performed, since repeat-dose toxicity studies did not 
reveal any specific concerns. Antigenicity has also not been studied. 
Metabolites 
The toxicological profile of metabolite M-1 was comparable to the profile of riociguat, except that 
the M-1 showed a higher nephrotoxic potential as compared to riociguat.  
The renal toxicity of M-1 was restricted to very high exposure levels in rats and consisted of 
tubular degeneration and regeneration followed by tubular hyperplasia affecting predominantly 
the collecting ducts. In dogs metabolite M-1 did not induce renal toxicity. In the mouse and rat 
carcinogenicity studies performed with metabolite M-1 and terminated preterm, no evidence of 
treatment-related effects on the kidneys was seen.  
In conclusion, metabolite M-1 demonstrated kidney toxicity only at high doses in rats, but not in 
mice or dogs. Overall, the preclinical data give no indication for a nephrotoxic effect of riociguat 
at therapeutically relevant doses. 
Impurities 
All unspecified impurities are below the limit of quantitation (0.05%) and all specified impurities 
are below or equal to 0.1%. The specified impurities were evaluated for genotoxic concern by in-
silico QSAR analyses for genotoxic alerts. The results of these analyses showed no concerns.

2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Riociguat (Mw 422.42 g/mole) is an organic molecule containing ionisable N atoms, with a 
reported (single) pKa value of 4.34. The molecule is predominantly neutral at pH values of ≥ 7 
and positively charged at lower pH values. Water solubility (Sw) at 25°C: 4 mg/L in water and 
in pH 6 buffer. At pH 7, 8 and 9, Sw is 3 mg/L, while at lower pH, Sw increases, up to 980 mg/L 
at pH 2. Riociguat is hydrolytically stable at pH 4, 7 and 9 (50°C); the hydrolysis half-life at 25°C 
is estimated to be >1 year. Its log Dow at pH 4 is 1.77 and log Kow is 2.30 at pH 9 and 2.30 at 
pH 7. This is below the B screening criterion, hence riociguat is neither PBT nor vPvB.  
For refinement of Fpen, prevalence data from the Orphan designation were used. Summed 
prevalence for CTEPH and PAH for the EU is 19.2 per million, resulting in a PECsw of 0.075 ng/L, 
which is below the EMA action limit. Further studies were nevertheless submitted, results of 
which are summarised in the following. Riociguat is not readily biodegradable. In a 
water/sediment simulation study (OECD 308) at 20°C, riociguat showed no degradation during 
the 100 d test period, no metabolites were detected in water and sediment. At day 100, 9 and 
15% bound residue was determined in two sediments, while 93-96% of the substance was 
present in sediment and 3.3-3.8% in water. Riociguat is very persistent. The organic carbon 
normalized partition coefficient (Koc) determined in an OECD 121 screening assay, is 380 L/kg. 
The toxicity to algae (D. subspicatus; effect on growth rate) resulted in a 72 h NOEC of 0.96 
mg/L, EC10 of 3.8 mg/L and an EC50>4.8 mg/L. Chronic toxicity to Daphnia magna resulted in a 
NOEC reproduction of 0.073 mg/L (EC10 0.28 mg/L). NOEC for the endpoints mortality, nr. of 
broods and time to 1st brood were all ≥  0.57 µg/L. Larvae and adults of the sediment dwelling 
midge Chironomus riparius were not affected in development rate and emergence; NOEC ≥ 350 
mg/kg d.w. (normalized to 10% organic carbon and corrected for extractable fraction) for both 
endpoints.

2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP concluded that the non-clinical data presented by the applicant support the use of the 
product, and therefore recommend the approval of Adempas. The CHMP however considered that 
the following measures were necessary to address the outstanding non-clinical issues regarding 
potential drug-drug interactions: 
 
The Applicant will test if synthesis of 3H-labelled compound is feasible. If feasible, the 
Applicant will investigate at clinically relevant concentrations a) whether riociguat is a 
substrate for OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, and OCT3 and b) whether M-1 is a substrate for OAT1, 
OAT3, OCT1, OCT2 and OCT3. The reports are expected by December 2014. 
 
The study reports on the inhibition potential of M-1 towards MATE1 and MATE2 have to be 
submitted by the Applicant by May 2014. In addition, if these studies indicate that riociguat 
and M-1 are inhibitors of one of these transporters, the Applicant is requested to change the 
SmPC accordingly. 
The SmPC appropriately reflects the non-clinical data submitted with riociguat.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
The clinical pharmacology program for riociguat is comprised of 32 studies, including 768 healthy 
subjects or patient-volunteers (with renal or hepatic impairment, respectively), and 26 PH 
patients. 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 30/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
An overview about the Audit findings and the inspection reports from the FDA was reviewed 
during the procedure. Overall the number and the nature of the findings did not raise concerns 
with regard to overall adherence to GCP and the validity of the pivotal studies. 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
Pharmacokinetics of riociguat were investigated in 8 phase I bioavailability studies, 2 phase I 
bioequivalence studies (with Japanese subjects), 27 studies pertinent to pharmacokinetics using 
biomaterials and 11 clinical phase I pharmacokinetics studies. Additional pharmacokinetic data 
originate from 9 clinical phase I and II pharmacokinetics / pharmacodynamics studies. 
Methods 
The analytical methods used for the determination of riociguat and metabolite M-1 were 
acceptable and sufficiently validated. A cross validation was performed for the method performed 
at the different analytical sites. The methods for pharmacokinetic data analysis and statistical 
methods are acceptable. The POP-PK methods are acceptable and sufficiently described and 
validated for their purposes as these are exploratory only. 
Absorption  
Riociguat is rapidly absorbed with maximum concentrations (Cmax) appearing 1-1.5 hours after 
tablet intake. The absolute bioavailability of riociguat is high, approximately 94%. Absorption of 
riociguat is dependent on the site of drug release in the gastrointestinal tract. Bioavailability of 
riociguat decreased when administered to the deeper parts of the gastrointestinal tract. 
The Applicant performed several bioavailability/bioequivalence studies with IR tablets and oral 
suspensions including paediatric formulations. No major differences were found between oral IR 
formulations and suspension formulations of riociguat. The proposed commercial formulation is 
identical to the clinical phase III formulations, only the ratio of the pigments was varied. This 
change in pigments was expected not to influence bioavailability, as was confirmed by two 
Japanese studies. The manufacturing process was comparable throughout the clinical 
development and for the commercial formulations. Additionally, it was shown that the 0.5, 1.0, 
1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 mg phase III tablets demonstrate dose proportional pharmacokinetic 
parameters. 
There is no food effect on the extent of exposure of riociguat, however, there is a food effect on 
the rate of absorption as it demonstrates a postponed tmax and a reduced Cmax (minus 35%). 
Distribution 
The volume of distribution at steady-state (Vss) was determined to be approximately 30 L for 
riociguat, indicating its low affinity to tissues which is in agreement with animal data. 
The fraction not bound to plasma proteins (fu) of riociguat was approximately 3-5% in human 
plasma, with no concentration dependency. Riociguat was mainly bound to serum albumin and 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 31/118 
 
  
  
α1-acidic glycoprotein in human plasma. There was low binding to LDL, gamma-globulin, and 
alpha-globulin. 
The free fraction of metabolite M-1 in human plasma was comparable with riociguat (3.6%), with 
no concentration dependency. The main binding protein for M-1 in human plasma was serum 
albumin. The plasma to blood ratio (Cp/ Cb) of riociguat was approximately 1.5. Riociguat 
penetrated the placental barrier to a moderate extent in pregnant rat and the blood/ brain 
barrier to a low extent.    
Elimination and metabolism 
Elimination half-life is about 7 hours in healthy subjects and about 12 hours in patients. 
Combined excretion of the parent compound riociguat and metabolites is both renal (33 to 45%) 
and biliary/faecal (48 to 59%). Unchanged riociguat was excreted with (passive) glomerular 
filtration in the kidneys by approximately 4 to 19% of the administered dose and via biliary/ 
faecal routes by about 9 to 44%. The metabolite M-1 was found in the urine by 7 to 23% and 
faeces by 15 to 43%. Riociguat and metabolite M-1 are excreted both by renal and biliary/faecal 
routes. 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
Metabolite M-1 is the major metabolite of importance. M-1 demonstrates pharmacological activity 
at one tenth to one third the activity of riociguat. As shown in pre-clinical studies, M-1 is linked 
with renal toxicity at exposure levels more than 10-fold of human exposure in terms of unbound 
AUC. The enzymes CYP2C8, CYP2J2, CYP3A4, and CYP1A1 play a role in the formation of this 
metabolite. CYP1A1 is of particular importance as smoking increases activity of this enzyme, and 
two- to threefold higher riociguat clearance has been observed in smokers. In light of this, 
patients are advised to stop smoking when starting treatment due to the risk of a lower response 
(see section 4.2 and 4.5 of the SmPC). 
In general, the pharmacokinetic parameters of the main metabolite M-1 have adequately been 
assessed in the studies and data of M-1 are provided alongside riociguat throughout the report. 
The metabolite M-1 demonstrates on average a Cmax of 25%, a longer tmax, a similar AUC and 
a longer half-life than the parent compound. No pharmacokinetics of the other metabolites is 
provided except for the mass balance study, which is acceptable. 
Genetic polymorphisms were investigated in the light of pharmacokinetic variability. There were 
no genetic polymorphisms identified by the Applicant to contribute to the variability. 
Other pharmacokinetic properties 
Dose linearity was demonstrated over the therapeutic range of 0.5 (1.0) and 2.5 mg. 
The compound riociguat demonstrated dose linearity with only minor accumulation after 10 days 
of 3 times daily dosing (up to 157%). Accumulation for metabolite M-1 was 482% to 685%, 
which is in line with expectations based on t1/2 (~14 h) and dosing interval. 
Inter-individual variability in riociguat exposure (AUC) across all doses was approximately 60%. 
The intra-individual variability measured by Ctrough in PH patients was 35%.

The elimination phase was prolonged in pulmonary hypertension (PH) patients with 
approximately 5 hours compared to young healthy subjects, resulting in exposure (AUC) being 
approximately threefold higher at steady state compared to healthy subjects. 
Special populations 
Mean dose- and weight- normalised area under the curve (AUC) of riociguat in non-smoking 
individuals was 53% higher in subjects with mild renal impairment, 139% higher in subjects with 
moderate renal impairment and 54% higher in subjects with severe renal impairment compared 
to subjects with normal renal function. Smokers had a higher metabolic clearance of riociguat. 
Hepatic impairment affects riociguat hepato-biliary clearance resulting in clinically relevant 
increases in exposure for non-smoking subjects with moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh 
B) by 50% (total) to 70% (unbound). There are no data in patients with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child Pugh C), therefore use of riociguat is contraindicated in this population (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.3 of the SmPC). 
The CHMP agreed with the applicant that there are no clinically significant changes in riociguat 
pharmacokinetics due to race or age to be expected in patients as presented in the data. The 
changes in riociguat pharmacokinetics due to gender or body weight are not clinically relevant 
(see section 4.2 of the SmPC). 
Interactions 
In vitro 
Riociguat and its main human metabolite M-1 are neither inducers (CYP1A2, CYP3A4) nor 
inhibitors (CYP1A2, 2A6, 2B6, 2C8, 2C9, 2C19, 2D6, 2E1, 2J2, and 3A4) of any major CYP 
isoforms or human UGTs or SULTs (sulfotransferases) in vitro at therapeutic plasma 
concentrations. 
No clinically relevant drug-drug interactions due to inhibition of transporters such as P-gp or 
BCRP, or BSEP, or organic anion transporting polypeptides OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or organic anion 
transporters OAT1, OAT3, or organic cation transporters OCTs by riociguat are expected. 
Furthermore, metabolite M-1 is not an inhibitor of P-gp, BCRP, BSEP, OATPs, OATs and OCTs at 
relevant therapeutic concentrations. 
Riociguat and M-1 revealed an inhibitory potency on CYP1A1 in vitro with an inhibition constant 
(Ki) value of 0.6 µM, each. 
To evaluate the CYP-mediated drug-drug interaction potential for riociguat as victim, a series of 
87 drugs from various compound classes (e.g., anticancer drugs, analgesics, antiviral drugs, 
antibiotics, antifungal azoles, etc.) were part of a broad in vitro screening with common co-
medications tested regarding their potential to affect riociguat oxidative metabolism in vitro 
applying human liver microsomes or human recombinant CYP1A1: 
• 
N-demethylation, i.e. metabolite M-1 formation in human liver microsomes was 
considerably inhibited by protease inhibitors (ritonavir, atazanavir > indinavir and 
antifungal azoles (ketoconazole > clotrimazole, miconazole). 
• 
Pronounced inhibition of recombinant human CYP1A1 – an important CYP isoenzyme in 
riociguat metabolism, especially in smokers – was observed by the antifungal azoles 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 33/118 
 
  
  
ketoconazole, clotrimazole and miconazole as well as carvedilol, ebastine, quercetin and 
tyrosine kinase inhibitors like erlotinib, gefitinib, imatinib, sorafenib and sunitinib. 
In Vivo 
Pre- and co-treatment with 40 mg omeprazole led to a decrease in riociguat bioavailability with a 
mean Cmax decrease of approximately 35% and a mean AUC decrease of 26%. 
The data indicate a PK interaction between Maalox and riociguat by reducing its extent and rate 
of absorption from the gastro-intestinal tract. With reduced riociguat Cmax by 56%, bioavailability 
(AUC) of riociguat and consecutively exposure to M-1 were reduced by 34% and by 33% in 
comparison to administration of riociguat alone. 
Pre- and co-treatment with the multi-pathway CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitor ketoconazole led to 
an increase in riociguat exposure with a mean Cmax increase by 46% and a mean AUC increase 
by 150%, indicating a relevant PK interaction. 
A four-day pre-treatment and subsequent co-administration of clarithromycin resulted in an 
altered riociguat exposure with an increase in mean AUC by 41% but no significant change in 
mean Cmax. Similarly, for M-1 a mean AUC increase by 19% but no significant change in mean 
Cmax was observed. While riociguat renal clearance remained almost unaffected, a small decrease 
for M-1 mean renal clearance by 18% was observed. 
The pharmacokinetics of midazolam are not altered by concomitant administration of riociguat. 
There were no relevant PK interactions between riociguat and the oral anti-coagulant warfarin 
(Coumadin), Aspirin, nitroglycerin or sildenafil. 
The above interactions are adequately reflected in section 4.5 of the SmPC. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
The pharmacodynamics of riociguat were evaluated in several of the clinical pharmacology 
studies in a) healthy subjects (studies 11258, 11260) b) healthy Japanese and Chinese subjects 
(studies 14361, 12640, 12639) and c) patients with PAH (study 11874). 
Mechanism of action 
A wide body of literature suggests that chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) 
and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) are associated with impaired NO-sGC-cGMP signalling 
in the vascular endothelium and consequent reduction of cGMP concentrations in the pulmonary 
vascular smooth muscle. Inhibitors of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) specific 
phosphodiesterase type 5 (PDE5), the enzyme that is responsible for degradation of cGMP, have 
been utilised in PAH. Riociguat is evaluated as the first member of a novel class of compounds, 
the sGC stimulators. 
sGC is a key enzyme in the cardiopulmonary system and the receptor for NO. It catalyses the 
generation of the signalling molecule cGMP that plays a pivotal role in regulating cellular 
processes, such as vascular tone, proliferation, fibrosis, and inflammation. With its dual mode of 
action riociguat directly stimulates sGC and synergises with NO, this way restoring the NO-sGC-

cGMP pathway. Riociguat exerts its biological effects independently of NO, which is present in low 
levels in some patients with CTEPH and PAH (figure PD1).

Primary pharmacology 
Repeat-dose studies in healthy volunteers show that riociguat administration is associated with a 
systemic blood pressure lowering effect. On the diastolic blood pressure, this is dose dependant 
and increases after repeated dosing. A less pronounced effect is seen on the systolic blood 
pressure after a single dose. There are compensatory mechanisms like increased heart rate (HR) 
and renin secretion, but these are attenuated by time. The cGMP increases further over time, 
which probably contributes to the durability of the effect. 
Study 11874 was the proof of concept study to investigate safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics 
of riociguat and its impact on pulmonary- and systemic haemodynamic and gas exchange in 
patients with pulmonary hypertension (PAH, CTEPH or interstitial lung disease (ILD)) in a non-
randomised, non-blinded design. The vast majority of patients suffered from PAH or CTEPH. Only 
one subject with ILD was included. Therefore, the study population is considered sufficiently 
representative for the target population. The study investigated escalating (part A) and fixed 
doses (part B) of riociguat. Administering riociguat 1 mg and 2.5 mg, resulted in reduction of 
both pulmonary and systemic pressures; the dose response is more obvious in the systemic 
pressure measurements. However, the numbers are small, precluding robust results (n=15) 
(table PD1). 
Importantly, an effect on the pulmonary haemodynamics comparable to NO was demonstrated 
(table PD2). The haemodynamic effects observed in this study lasted for more than five hours 
supporting the proposed 6- to 8-hour dosing interval corresponding to a three times a day (t.i.d.) 
dosing regimen (Figure PD2).

Secondary pharmacology 
Influence of Riociguat on Bone Metabolism, and laboratory findings 
In juvenile as well as in adolescent rats, riociguat-related effects on bone morphology were 
observed. Since intracellular cGMP levels are known to be involved in regulation of bone 
homeostasis, these findings are considered secondary to the pharmacological mode of action. 
Study 13790 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 2-fold crossover study to 
investigate the effects of multiple-dose riociguat (2.5 mg t.i.d. over 14 days) on bone resorption 
and formation markers in sixteen healthy male non-smoking subjects. The main results are 
shown in table PD3. 
CHMP assessment report

Table PD3: Summary of the main factor "treatment" of the ANCOVA on 
pharmacodynamic parameters (all subjects valid for PD; n=16) (Study 13790) 
Results show increased bone resorption parameters in urine, which the Applicant explained by 
the increased GFR due to vasodilatation. This applies also to calcium excretion. However, there is 
an associated decrease in bone formation parameters such as N-terminal propeptide of type I 
collagen (PINP), bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (bAP), and osteocalcin. The long-term risk of 
bone changes and fractures are listed as a potential risk in the RMP.  
Red blood cell count (0.15 109/mL, 3.17%), haematocrit (0.01, 3.57%), and haemoglobin (5g/L, 
3.56%) decreased significantly in this study. This was associated with a significant increase in 
reticulocyte count after 6-7 days. Further analysis of the Phase III data showed that 
haemodilution caused by an increase in intravascular volume due to vasodilating effect of 
riociguat is likely the cause of the observed anaemia. The submitted data does not indicate that 
the anaemia represents a clinically relevant risk for the outcome of the patients treated 
chronically with riociguat. Anaemia is listed as a common TEAE in the SmPC.   
The small observed increase in GFR (3.2%) in all pivotal phase 3 studies after 12/13 weeks is 
unlikely to affect plasma electrolyte concentrations in a clinically relevant fashion.   
Effect on Cardiac depolarisation 
Due to the drug exposure being higher in patients than in healthy subjects, a thorough QT study 
according to pertinent guidelines could not be conducted in healthy subjects. The influence of 
riociguat on ECG parameter was investigated within the phase III trials (see the Clinical safety 
section of this report).

Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
Riociguat has the potential to interact with other vasodilators acting on the NO-cGMP pathway. 
Thus, an additive effect on pulmonary and systemic circulation might have been expected. This 
was investigated with nitroglycerin and sildenafil. Based on the results of a phase I study 
showing significant hypotensive effects and syncope, a contraindication regarding the co-
administration of riociguat with nitrates or NO- donors (such as amyl nitrite) in any form is 
implemented in the SmPC (see section 4.3 and 4.5 of SmPC). 
The Applicant investigated the co-administration of riociguat with sildenafil in PAH patients in two 
studies (11917 and 15096).  
Study 11917 was an open-label, non-controlled study in 7 subjects (3 men and 4 women) with 
PAH, stable for the last 6 weeks and treated with 20 mg sildenafil t.i.d. The study investigated 
safety, tolerability, PK of sildenafil, riociguat and M1, and the impact on pulmonary and systemic 
haemodynamics of single doses of 0.5 mg riociguat (administered 3 hours after 20 mg sildenafil) 
and 1 mg of riociguat (administered after another 2 hours to the same subjects). 
Study 15096 was an interaction study to evaluate changes in blood pressure following 1, 1.5,2, 
and 2.5 mg riociguat t.i.d (dose titration) compared to placebo treatment on the background of 
stable sildenafil pre-treatment in subjects with symptomatic pulmonary arterial hypertension. 
Both studies showed additive systemic hypotensive action. Study 15096 deserves attention 
considering that it is comparable to clinical practice. This study investigated patients on stable 
and authorised doses of sildenafil (20 mg t.i.d.), and then allowed co-administration of riociguat 
for 12 weeks. The study recruited few patients (n=18). The baseline values of blood pressure in 
both groups were largely discrepant, confounding the results. The addition of riociguat on top of 
stable doses of sildenafil led to further reduction in blood pressure in the first weeks compared to 
the placebo group, but on the long term the values were comparable. However, the safety issues 
encountered are worth mentioning. The discontinuation rate in the long-term extension (LTE) 
was high (6/17), clearly pointing to a tolerability issue; probably the associated hypotension. 
These additive haemodynamic effects on the systemic circulation might culminate in single 
patients leading to a clinically relevant event. Importantly, during the LTE phase (cut-off date 18 
December 2012) three death cases had been reported. In one case a 67-year-old female subject 
experienced fatal ‘cardiac arrest’, which was assessed by the investigator and company as not 
related to riociguat. In the second case a 46-year-old female died following acute 
‘decompensation of chronic right heart failure’. The investigator and the sponsor assessed the 
event as not related to riociguat. In the third case a 53-year-old white female experienced ‘fall’ 
and ‘subdural haematoma’ leading to death. As a causal involvement of riociguat in the fall, via a 
decrease in blood pressure, could not be excluded with certainty the causal relationship was 
assessed as related to riociguat. The EMA was notified on 19 December 2012 by the Applicant 
about their intention to stop the LTE phase of the study. This decision was endorsed. This 
interaction is implemented as a contraindication in the proposed SmPC (see section 4.3 and 4.5; 
and section 2.6.4 of this report, Adverse events of special).

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics  
Absorption of riociguat is dependent on the site of drug release in the gastrointestinal tract. 
Bioavailability of riociguat decreased when administered to the deeper parts of the 
gastrointestinal tract, which is probably due to limited solubility at neutral pH. Influence of P-gp 
and BCRP substrate characteristics is less likely due to the dose proportionality of riociguat. Dose 
linearity is demonstrated from 0.5 to 2.5 mg in single and multidose studies in respect to Cmax 
and AUC.  
Food effect 
There is no food effect on the extent of exposure of riociguat, however, there is a food effect on 
the rate of absorption which is demonstrated by a postponed tmax and a reduced Cmax (minus 
35%). This is reflected in the SmPC section 5.2. Metabolite M-1 is the major metabolite of 
importance. M-1 demonstrates pharmacological activity at one tenth to one third the activity of 
riociguat. As shown in pre-clinical studies, M-1 is linked with renal toxicity. The enzymes CYP2C8, 
CYP2J2, CYP3A4, and CYP1A1 play a role in the formation of this metabolite. CYP1A1 is of 
particular importance as it is the main M-1 forming enzyme and smoking increases activity of this 
enzyme; two- to threefold higher riociguat clearance has been observed in smokers. 
Special population (smokers) 
In the phase III trial all included patients who are smokers were up-titrated to the 2 highest 
strengths t.i.d.  
Renal impairment 
Mean renal clearance of both riociguat and the metabolite M1 decreased with decreasing renal 
function compared to results in healthy controls. Although exposures observed in subjects with 
renal impairment were highly variable, it can be concluded that riociguat exposure increased in 
all groups of renal impairment, but did not increase proportionally to decreasing renal function. 
Mean dose- and weight-normalised AUC of riociguat in non-smoking individuals was 53% higher 
in subjects with mild renal impairment, 139% higher in subjects with moderate renal impairment 
and 54% higher in subjects with severe renal impairment compared to subjects with normal 
renal function. Smokers had a higher metabolic clearance of riociguat to M-1 due CYP1A1 
induction and therefore lower exposure to riociguat than non-smokers. Smokers with severe 
renal impairment (n=2) showed low AUCnorm comparable to healthy controls. The Applicant 
concluded that, the influences of renal impairment on riociguat PK to be expected in PH patients 
were clinically relevant, however, did not merit any dose adjustment beyond the individual dose 
titration. Based on the lack of clinical data in severe renal impaired patients with creatinine 
clearance below 30 mL/min or being on dialysis, Adempas is not recommended in these patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
Hepatic impairment affects riociguat hepato-biliary clearance resulting in clinically relevant 
increases in exposure for patients with moderate hepatic insufficiency (Child Pugh B) by 51% 
(total) to 70% (unbound). The influences of hepatic impairment on riociguat PK to be expected in 
PH patients were moderate and do not merit any dose adjustment beyond the individual dose 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 41/118 
 
  
  
titration. Based on the lack of clinical data in Child Pugh C patients, there is a contraindication for 
therapeutic use in this special group of patients at risk (see section 4.3 of the SmPC). 
Interactions 
Pre- and co-treatment with the multi-pathway CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitor ketoconazole led to 
an increase in riociguat exposure with a mean Cmax increase by 46% and a mean AUC increase 
by 150%, indicating a relevant PK interaction. The interaction was markedly more pronounced in 
those subjects exhibiting per se a higher clearance for riociguat (i.e. shorter half-life, lower AUC), 
reflecting the strong inhibitory potential of ketoconazole towards CYP1A1. The exposure of M-1 
decreased with regard to mean Cmax by approximately 49% and mean AUC by 24%. A single 
dose of riociguat did not affect the bioavailability of ketoconazole (see section 4.5 of the SmPC). 
A four day pre-treatment and subsequent co-administration of clarithromycin resulted in an 
altered riociguat exposure with an increase in mean AUC by 41% but no significant change in 
mean Cmax. Similarly, for M-1 a mean AUC increase by 19% but no significant change in mean 
Cmax was observed. While riociguat renal clearance remained almost unaffected, a small 
decrease for M-1 mean renal clearance by 18% was observed. The data indicate a moderate PK 
interaction between clarithromycin, a strong inhibitor of CYP3A4 and weak-to-moderate inhibitor 
of P gp, and riociguat. As riociguat renal clearance remained almost unaffected, an inhibition of 
the CYP3A4-mediated part of the riociguat metabolic clearance by clarithromycin pre- and co-
administration is most probable. The unexpected increase in M1 exposure following CYP3A4 
inhibition is probably a result of the multi-pathway biotransformation. These results were not 
considered to have any clinically relevant consequences. 
The pharmacokinetics of midazolam are not altered by concomitant administration of riociguat. 
Midazolam is a recommended sensitive probe substrate when investigating in vivo any CYP3A4 
interaction potential of investigational drugs. The midazolam PK are known to be markedly 
altered by the co-administration of CYP3A4 inhibitors. Thus, based on this study the CHMP 
agreed with the Applicant that riociguat does not affect the activity of CYP3A4. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Riociguat is the first member of a novel class of compounds, the sGC stimulators which act by 
directly stimulating the synthesis of cGMP and enhancing the action of NO. Like other 
vasodilators used in PAH, riociguat administration is associated with a systemic blood pressure 
lowering effect; 5 mg riociguat is not well tolerated due to the associated drop in blood pressure. 
Riociguat 1 mg and 2.5 mg, resulted in reduction in both pulmonary and systemic pressure 
measurements; with comparable effects to NO on the pulmonary haemodynamics. Administration 
of riociguat for 14 days to healthy volunteers resulted in general vasodilatation and 
haemodilution that can explain some observed changes. However, there is a decrease in bone 
formation parameters such as N-terminal propeptide of type I collagen (PINP), bone-specific 
alkaline phosphatase (bAP), and osteocalcin. It is generally accepted that the NO-sGC-cGMP and 
the natriuretic peptide- particulate (membrane-bound) guanylate cyclase (pGC)-cGMP pathway 
play an important role in regulation of bone and cartilage homeostasis. The long-term 
consequences of these changes are unknown; this is reflected in the RMP.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics of riociguat are well described by the Applicant. Metabolism and excretion 
of riociguat is complex. Riociguat is cleared by a wide range of enzymes, and substrate for 
various transporters. Main intrinsic factors: smoking, renal impairment (increase up to 100%), 
hepatic impairment and weight (40% higher exposure in subjects <60kg compared to subjects 
60-90 kg). Subjects with impaired renal and hepatic function and subjects weighing <60 kg 
showed a higher exposure to riociguat and are more at risk for hypotension. Particular care 
should be exercised during individual dose titration.  
Pharmacodynamics 
Riociguat causes vasodilatation through a new mechanism of action. Dose titration is an 
important step and the achieved dose appears to be mainly determined by the ensuing 
hypotension. Vasodilatation is accompanied by haemodilution and a reduction in some serum 
chemistry parameters. The co-administration with PDE5 inhibitors was considered a plausible 
pharmacological option to augment the effect on the NO-GC pathway; however, this was 
associated with an unfavourable safety profile, such that a contraindication is implemented in 
section 4.3 of the SmPC. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
This application is based on the results of efficacy data obtained from the clinical study program 
conducted until 03 May 2012, and comprises data from the following studies (table E1): 
-  2 Phase II studies: study 12166 and its long-term extension study 12166 LTE. 
-  4 Phase III studies: study 11348 (CHEST-1) and its long-term extension study 11349 
(CHEST-2) to support the CTEPH indication; and study 12934 (PATENT-1) and its long-term 
extension study 12935 (PATENT-2) to support the PAH indication.

Phase III studies 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
The choice of the dose range of 1.0 mg to 2.5 mg t.i.d to be further investigated in phase II/III 
studies is based on the results shown in healthy subjects and the proof of concept study.  
Study 12166 
Design 
This phase II study was an open-label, multi-centre, non-randomised, non-blinded, non-
controlled study of 12-week t.i.d. dosing of riociguat in patients with PH due to either PAH or 
CTEPH. The primary study objective was to investigate the safety, tolerability and feasibility of 
individual dose titration (IDT) of riociguat according to peripheral systolic blood pressure. 
Methods 
An individualised dose titration scheme is employed based on the systolic blood pressure (SBP) 
response. The patient is initially administered 1 mg t.i.d and depending on the SBP the dose is 
adapted every two weeks if necessary, for a period of eight weeks. 
Results 
Most of the patients (68%) could tolerate the highest dose of 2.5 mg tid, which is reassuring. 
Adverse events (AE) related to hypotension were reported, but none led to discontinuation of the 
medication. Blood pressures normalised in all but two cases without a change in drug regimen. In 
these two cases, a lower dose of riociguat was started and tolerated. The results show that 
indeed this individual dose titration (IDT) appears to adapt the systemic haemodynamics to the 
vasodilatory effect of riociguat.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 44/118 
 
  
  
 
With regard to the practical feasibility of this dose-titration scheme, there appears to be no delay 
in attaining efficacy although the effect is not maximal in some patients. The time course of the 
effect on 6MWD in the Phase-III trials confirms this: In PATENT (PAH), after 4 weeks the change 
from baseline was 25.6 and 12.6 m in the IDT and placebo arms respectively; In CHEST 
(CTEPH), after 4 weeks the change from baseline was 27.2 and 12.5 m in the IDT and placebo 
arms respectively. 
It is agreed that the proposed dose titration is sufficiently justified by inter-individual differences 
in PK/PD and susceptibility. In addition to a visit after 4 weeks (as in the ESC guideline), the 
titration scheme requires 2 additional visits, after week 2 and after week 6. This may be 
cumbersome if the riociguat treatment is overseen by a referral centre which is far away; 
however, this is left to the perceived benefit risk assessment of riociguat. 
In general, the vasodilatory effect appears to be more pronounced in PAH patients than CTEPH 
patients, on both the systemic and pulmonary blood pressure (table E4) and eventually on the 
6MWT (table E5). These differences are attributed to the different baseline characteristics; PAH 
subjects presenting a sicker study population compared to CTEPH subjects. Study 12166 included 
an adequate number of subjects with PAH or CTEPH to achieve the study objectives of this proof-
of-concept study. The 2 subgroups were however too small to demonstrate subgroup-specific 
effects of riociguat. Additionally, differences in pathophysiology between CTEPH and PAH may be 
important. So far, experience with the therapeutic response in CTEPH is limited; some agents 
that were effective in PAH were not effective in CTEPH suggesting that CTEPH may be less 
sensitive to vasodilatation.

Conclusion 
The dose range between 1.0 mg and 2.5 mg covers the range from the minimum effective dose 
to the maximum tolerated dose in healthy volunteers based on the effects seen for heart rate, 
blood pressure and plasma renin activity. Therefore, 1.0 mg was selected as the starting dose 
and 2.5 mg as the maximum dose in the clinical phase II study 12166.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
2.5.2.1.  Study 11348 (CHEST-1) 
Methods 
This was a Phase III, double-blind, randomised, multi-centre, placebo-controlled study of the 
efficacy and safety of oral riociguat in subjects with CTEPH (Figure E1). 
Figure E1: Trial Design and dose titration. 
Study Participants  
To be eligible for inclusion, subjects had to have a diagnosis of inoperable or postoperative 
CTEPH and an eligibility and baseline 6MWD test between 150 m and 450 m. Subjects with 
inoperable CTEPH had to have a PVR >300 dyn∙s∙cm-5 measured at least 90 days after start of 
full anticoagulation and a PAPmean >25 mmHg; inoperability was diagnosed by an experienced 
surgeon or a central adjudication committee. Criteria to define inoperability can vary per centre, 
which may have implications for a global trial. The criteria of inoperability were established by an 
experienced surgeon, the definition of whom is acceptable. The inoperability assessment focused 
on the assessment of the technical operability under consideration of surgical accessibility of the 
organised thrombi and concordance between surgical accessible vascular obstruction and PVR. 
This is plausible. In CHEST-1, subjects with postoperative CTEPH (persisting or recurrent PH after 
pulmonary endarterectomy) had to have a PVR >300 dyn∙s∙cm-5 measured at least 180 days 
after surgery. There is no consensus on the definition of post-operative CTEPH, but the used 
definition in CHEST-1 is defendable. 
Treatments 
After a pre-treatment phase of approximately four weeks, eligible subjects were randomised in a 
2:1 ratio to receive riociguat TID as an individual dose titration (IDT, between 1.0 mg and 2.5 
mg TID) or placebo TID in an 8-week titration phase (from Visit 1 to Visit 5) (fig E1). The SBP 
was measured at trough before intake of the morning dose under consideration of the following 
algorithm: 
- 
If trough SBP ≥95 mmHg, increase dose (+0.5 mg TID) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 47/118 
 
  
  
 
- 
- 
- 
If trough SBP 90 – 94 mmHg, maintain dose 
If trough SBP <90 mmHg without symptoms of hypotension, reduce dose (-0.5 mg TID) 
If any SBP <90 mmHg with clinical symptoms of hypotension such as dizziness or 
presyncope, stop study treatment; restart after 24 hours with reduced dose (-0.5 mg TID). 
The titration phase was followed by an 8-week main study phase (from Visit 5 to Visit 7). The 
titration scheme follows that employed in study 12166, but with more relaxed cut-off values to 
indicate hypotension: trough SBP ≥95 mmHg allowed increasing the dose, instead of 100 mmHg 
(study 12166). In CHEST-1 and PATENT-1 the rate of syncope was slightly lower on treatment as 
compared to placebo, whereas the rate of presyncope was slightly higher. Albeit riociguat has 
major effects on systolic blood pressure, the treatment algorithm of the pivotal trials including 
the target blood pressures did not raise concerns.   
Objectives 
To assess the efficacy and safety of oral riociguat in subjects with inoperable CTEPH or recurrent 
or persisting PH after surgical treatment. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was change from baseline in 6MWD after 16 weeks. Secondary 
efficacy endpoints included: 
-  Change from baseline in PVR after 16 weeks 
-  Change from baseline in NT-proBNP after 16 weeks 
-  Change from baseline in WHO functional class after 16 weeks 
- 
Time to clinical worsening (TTCW: the first occurrence of death, heart/lung transplantation, 
rescue PEA due to persistent worsening of PH, hospitalisation due to persistent worsening of 
PH, start of new PH-specific treatment, persistent decrease of more than 15% from baseline 
or more than 30% compared to the last study-related measurement in 6MWD, persistent 
worsening of functional class) 
This design is generally acceptable for a claim of improvement in exercise capacity in an 
indication where no other medicinal product is registered. As the relevant CHMP guideline 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008) does not specifically address CTEPH, developing a clinical 
program in line with that recommended for PAH products is acceptable due to the disease 
similarities. In this guideline, hard endpoints measuring clinical outcomes are favoured over 
investigating improvements in exercise capacity. This was already communicated to the Applicant 
in the scientific advice (EMEA/H/SA/814/1/FU/1/2008/P A/II). During the assessment the 6MWT 
was still considered a valid endpoint, however, investigations of clinical outcomes would have 
been more relevant and TTCW should have been the preferred choice as primary or key 
secondary endpoint. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 48/118 
 
  
  
The investigated secondary endpoints are relevant; however the importance of measuring time 
to clinical worsening could have been emphasized more, for instance by placing it higher in the 
hierarchical testing 
The components defining clinical worsening are not all equally robust. For example, the criteria 
for heart and lung transplantation vary per country and may be subjective in a global trial. 
Likewise, the criteria to justify the need for an additional PH therapy are not clearly shown. The 
endpoint is also not adjudicated which should have been done in this trial. 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy outcome was defined as the change in 6MWD from baseline to week 16 (last 
observation until week 16). 
Assuming an SD of 70 m, it was calculated that 261 subjects valid for ITT (174 in the riociguat 
1.0-2.5 mg group, 87 in the placebo group, 2:1 randomization) would be required to detect a 
placebo-adjusted difference of 30 m in 6MWD with a power of 90% and a two-sided significance 
level of 5%. 
Allowing for an invalidity rate of 3%, a total of 270 randomized subjects were required 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomly allocated to the riociguat 1.0-2.5 mg group (180 subjects 
planned) or the placebo group (90 subjects planned) using an interactive voice response system 
(IVRS). Randomization took place at Visit 1 and was done in a 2:1 ratio in accordance with a 
computer-generated random code. Subjects were randomized in blocks of size 6, reflecting the 
2:1 allocation ratio. Separate blocks were used for country groupings within each region 
Blinding (masking) 
The study was conducted as a double-blind trial. In general, subjects, investigators, and 
sponsor/contract research personnel remained blinded until the study database was frozen. 
Study medication and packaging were identical in appearance for each treatment group.  
Subjects from the placebo group underwent sham titration from Visit 1 onwards, following the 
same rules of the individual dose titration scheme. Independently of the investigator’s decision to 
increase, maintain or decrease the dose of study medication, the IVRS always allocated blinded 
placebo medication. 
From Visit 2 onwards, the 6MWD test, Borg Scale assessment, and evaluation of WHO functional 
class had to be performed by a second physician or person who was not involved in the process 
of study drug titration and was unaware of the immediate reaction of the subject’s blood 
pressure and heart rate after dosing. 
To allow for ongoing safety monitoring during the conduct of the study, members of the Data 
Monitoring Committee (DMC) received unblinded safety data. The involvement of an external 
statistical analysis centre in this process ensured that unblinded information was not available for 
third parties. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 49/118 
 
  
  
Statistical methods 
The primary analysis set for efficacy was the intent-to-treat (ITT) set, which included all 
randomised subjects who received at least one dose of study medication. The primary efficacy 
outcome was the analysis of the change in 6MWD from baseline to week 16 (last observation 
until week 16) in the ITT set. The riociguat IDT and placebo groups were compared using 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), with baseline 6MWD as a covariate and treatment group and 
region (North America, South America, Europe, China, Asia/Pacific) as main effects. If the 
Shapiro-Wilk test for normality of residuals was statistically significant, the stratified Wilcoxon 
test was used as the primary statistical method instead of the ANCOVA. Superiority of the 
riociguat IDT group over the placebo group was to be declared if the two-sided significance level 
was less than or equal to 0.05. A per protocol analysis was performed as a supportive analysis. 
To minimise bias and include all randomised and treated subjects in the ITT analysis, imputation 
for missing values was necessary if a subject died, withdrew or had no measurement for some 
reason at the planned end of the study (week 16). Where a subject died or withdrew due to 
clinical worsening with no termination visit, the following rules will be used: 6MWD worst possible 
value (0 m). Death or withdrawal due to clinical worsening were components of time to clinical 
worsening, so were included as an event by definition. In the case of withdrawal for other 
reasons with no post-baseline measurements, the baseline was taken. If the subject completed 
the study as planned, but there is no efficacy measurement at the end of the study, the last 
post-baseline value was used. To assess the robustness of the results of the primary analysis, a 
per protocol analysis and several sensitivity analyses were performed. 
The statistical methods were considered acceptable.  
Results 
Participant flow 
The participant flow in the CHEST-1 study is shown in Figure E2.

Figure E2: Participants flow in CHEST-1 
Recruitment 
This study enrolled 446 patients in 89 study centres in 26 countries worldwide, of which 262 
were randomised.184 patients were not randomised; the most frequent primary reasons for non-
randomisation were protocol violation and withdrawal by subject. 18 randomised subjects 
prematurely discontinued study medication or did not receive the study medication (1 subject). 
Discontinuation rates are slightly higher in the riociguat group (8%) compared to the placebo 
group (5.7%). Discontinuations due to AEs (2.3% for each arm) and discontinuations due to 
death (1.1% vs. 2.3% respectively) were comparable, which is reassuring. There was a 
difference in the rate of subjects not completing the final 6MWD (riociguat 9, placebo 1). The 
applicant imputed these data by LOCF, which may not be completely conservative. However, this 
is not believed to influence the robustness of the trial results. 
Conduct of the study 
The study was subject to 7 supplier audits and 11 investigator site audits. The reports are not 
provided but the applicant stated that the study met all local legal and regulatory requirements 
and was conducted in compliance with the ethical principles of the declaration of Helsinki and 
CHMP assessment report

with GCP. The study had a Steering Committee (SC) to supervise the conduct of the study and a 
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). 
There were 7 protocol amendments, 4 of them were valid for all countries.  
Overall the study report did not indicate that there are relevant issues of concern related to the 
conduct of the study.  
Baseline data 
Table E6: Main baseline features of recruited patients in CHEST-1 
The main baseline characteristics of the recruited patients are depicted in table E6. The baseline 
characteristics of the recruited patients generally reflect the known disease distribution and

baseline PVR and 6MWD (Pepke-Zaba, Circulation. 2011;124:1973-1981). There is adequate 
representation of patients in functional class (FC) II/III, allowing an adequate assessment in 
these specific FCs. There is also a good representation of both inoperable and operable CTEPH. 
There is some reassurance regarding the tolerability of the dose: 77% of subjects were on the 
highest dose of 2.5 mg, 13% were on 2.0 mg and the rest on lower doses including 1/173 (1%) 
subject on 0.5 mg. However, it was considered also important to analyse efficacy (primary and 
secondary endpoints) per dose level to ensure benefit in patients with all dose levels. In this 
analysis, no obvious dose response differences would be expected as the dose was not 
randomised but related to an efficacy parameter (blood pressure) and thus to individual PK 
properties. It is shown the 2.5 mg tid dose is accompanied by the most consistent response 
regarding the different endpoints measured. 
Numbers analysed 
The following table provides an overview of analysis set assignments. 
Number of subjects in analysis sets 
Of the 446 subjects enrolled in the study, 262 were randomized and 261 received at least one 
dose of study medication. 
In accordance with the definitions of analysis sets, all 261 treated subjects were valid for safety 
analysis and for ITT analysis. In this study, the safety analysis set and the ITT analysis set were 
identical in size. One subject was randomized but not treated. 
A total of 43 treated subjects had a major protocol deviation and were not valid for per protocol 
analysis. Therefore the per protocol analysis set comprised 218 subjects.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Treatment with riociguat IDT resulted in a significant and clinically relevant improvement in 
6MWD from baseline to week 16 (last observation until week 16) as compared to placebo in the 
ITT analysis set (45.69 m; 95% CI: 24.74 m to 66.63 m; p<0.0001). Results of the per protocol 
analysis showed comparable results (52.24 m (95% CI: 30.53 m to 73.95 m, p<0.0001). Further 
sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the main analysis.

EMA/144673/2014

Subgroup analyses 
An improvement of the 6MWD from baseline to last visit was observed for the pre-defined 
subgroups of types of CTEPH, WHO FC at baseline, baseline 6MWD, age and race as well as other 
subgroups (Figure E3). Results were not always statistically significant, due to different reasons.

pre-specified subgroups (ITT analysis set CHEST-1) 
Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The results of the secondary efficacy variables are shown in Table E7.

Pulmonary haemodynamics are improved; specifically PVR shows a reduction of around 30%. 
The results of the postoperative CTEPH are less impressive than inoperable CTEPH (Table E8). 
The improvement seen for the haemodynamic variable PVR was consistent with other relevant 
haemodynamic variables, including CO (improvement of 0.9 L/min over placebo (difference of LS 
means) without a clinically relevant change of heart rate), SVR (reduction of 478 dyn∙s∙cm-5 over 
placebo), PAPmean (reduction of 5 mmHg over placebo) and mean arterial pressure (reduction of 
9 mmHg over placebo). 
Table E8: Change in PVR (dyn∙s∙cm-5) from baseline to last visit by pre-specified 
subgroups - ITT analysis set 
There was also a significant reduction in NT-proBNP. Most of the patients in both treatment arms 
did not show change in their WHO FC, however, more patients in the riociguat group improved 
by one (30.6%) or two levels (2.3%) compared to placebo (14.9% and none). Likewise, more 
patients on placebo deteriorated in FC. There was no significant improvement in TTCW, as 
expected due to the shortness of the study duration. The results do not indicate a deleterious 
effect of riociguat on the clinical outcomes of the patients, which is reassuring. The applicant has 
clarified that the statistical analysis of clinical worsening was based on a first event analysis that 
excluded some mortality events, but that mortality after a first event was analysed and 
presented in the respective tables. Additional analyses of TTCW using the CHMP definition 
corroborate the results of the analyses of the definitions used in CHEST-1. The number of 
patients experiencing clinical worsening according to the CHMP definition, were in CHEST-1 
(riociguat) 3 (1.7%) and placebo 5 (5.7%) (p = 0.09).

2.5.2.2.  Study 12934 (PATENT-1) 
Methods 
The methods in PATENT-1 were similar to those described in CHEST-1, but the study duration 
was 12 weeks (Figure E4). 
Study Participants 
To be eligible for inclusion, subjects had to have a diagnosis of symptomatic PAH (Group 1, 
Venice Clinical Classification of PH: idiopathic, familial, associated PAH due to connective tissue 
disease or congenital heart disease (i.e. atrial septal defect, ventricle septal defect, persistent 
ductus arteriosus), if patients underwent surgical correction more than 12 months before study 
inclusion, associated PAH due to portal hypertension with liver cirrhosis CHILD-Pugh class A (B 
and C excluded) and associated PAH due to anorexigen or amphetamine use); 6MWD test 
between 150 m and 450 m, a PVR >300 dyn∙s∙cm-5, and a PAPmean >25 mmHg. Both 
treatment-naïve patients and patients on stable pre-treatment with an ERA or a prostacyclin 
analogue (inhaled or subcutaneous; oral administration permitted in Japan, as per amendment 
7) could be included. These inclusion/exclusion criteria are generally acceptable.  
 Treatments 
Subjects were randomised into one of the three study arms (4:2:1): 
1. Placebo Arm (planned sample size: 132 subjects). 
2. Riociguat Individual Dose Titration (IDT) Arm (same as CHEST-1): (planned sample size: 264 
subjects) 
3. Riociguat 1.5 mg Capped Titration Arm (figure E4): intended dose 1.5 mg based on a dose 
titration scheme with titration from 1.0 mg to 1.5 mg (planned sample size: 66 subjects). If 
during the titration phase the subject reached the 1.5 mg dose level, no further up-titration was 
possible. From that point in time on, the subject underwent a sham titration that only allowed 
dose maintenance or decrease (figure E4). 
Figure E4: Titration scheme: Study 12934 (PATENT-1), riociguat 1.0-1.5 mg group 
The utility of the addition of the arm with capped titration without formal statistical 
considerations is questioned as it does not allow any robust interpretation of the results of the 
different dose levels. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 56/118 
 
  
  
 
Outcomes/endpoints are the same as those measured in CHEST-1, but at 12 weeks. The 
definition used for TTCW in PATENT-1 generally follows that employed in CHEST-1, with the 
exclusion of rescue pulmonary endaterectomy (PEA) due to persistent worsening of PH, which is 
not relevant in PAH. In both studies transient deteriorations of clinical status requiring 
hospitalisation, treatable by, for example, short-term administration of i.v. diuretics, positive 
inotropic agents or non-invasive ventilation and allowing subject discharge within 48 hours, were 
not considered as “persistent” and not included as TTCW event. This definition is rather 
restrictive, and may not capture short-term PH related hospitalisations, which are also important 
events.   
Objectives 
To assess the efficacy and safety of oral riociguat in treatment-naïve subjects and subjects pre-
treated with an endothelin receptor antagonist or a prostacyclin analogue with symptomatic PAH. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy variable was the 6MWD. 
Secondary efficacy variables were PVR, NT-proBNP, WHO functional class, time to clinical 
worsening, Borg CR 10 Scale or Modified Borg Dyspnoea Scale (subjects enrolled before 
amendment 4 only), EQ-5D questionnaire, and LPH questionnaire. 
The main analysis of the secondary variables was performed in subjects valid for ITT. A per 
protocol analysis of these variables was performed as a supportive analysis. 
Sample size 
The primary efficacy outcome was defined as the change in 6MWD from baseline to week 12 (last 
observation until week 12). 
Assuming an SD of 70 m, it was calculated that 375 subjects valid for ITT (250 in the riociguat 
1.0-2.5 mg group, 125 in the placebo group, 4:2 randomization) would be required to detect a 
placebo-adjusted difference of 25 m in 6MWD with a power of 90% and a two-sided significance 
level of 5%. 
In addition, the exploratory riociguat 1.0-1.5 mg group would have a sample size of one half that 
of the placebo group, approximately 63 patients. Hence, the total number of subjects valid for 
ITT was to be 438. Allowing for an invalidity rate of 5%, a total of 462 randomized subjects were 
required. 
Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomly allocated to the riociguat 1.0-2.5 mg group (264 subjects 
planned), or the placebo group (132 subjects planned), or the riociguat 1.0-1.5 mg group (66 
subjects planned) using an IVRS. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 57/118 
 
  
  
The randomization was done in a 4:2:1 ratio in accordance with a computer-generated random 
code. 
Randomization took place at Visit 1 and was stratified according to previous PAH treatment 
(treatment-naïve subjects and subjects pre-treated with an endothelin receptor antagonist or a 
prostacyclin analogue).   
Blinding (masking) 
The blinding in PATENT-1 followed the same approach used in CHEST-1.   
Statistical methods 
The statistical methods of study 12934 (PATENT-1) were similar to the methods of study 11348 
(see CHEST-1), and were considered acceptable by the CHMP.

Recruitment 
The participant flow in the PATENT-1 is shown in Figure E5. In PATENT-1, 586 patients were 
enrolled in 124 study centres in 30 countries worldwide. Of these, 141 patients were not 
randomised. The most frequent primary reasons for non-randomisation were protocol violation 
and withdrawal by subject. Of the 586 subjects, 445 were randomised, of whom 443 received 
study medication (254 in the riociguat IDT group, 126 in the placebo group, 63 in the riociguat 
1.0-1.5 mg group). Of the 445 randomised subjects, 405 (91.0%) completed the treatment 
phase. The remaining 40 randomised subjects prematurely discontinued study medication (38 
subjects) or did not receive the study medication (2 subjects). Discontinuation rates were slightly 
higher in the placebo arm (12.6%) compared to riociguat IDT and riociguat 1.0-1.5 mg arms 
(6.7% and 10.9% respectively). There was a higher rate of AEs reported with the placebo group 
than the other two groups, which is surprising. Deaths were equally reported in the placebo and 
riociguat (1.6% each) while no deaths were reported in the riociguat IDT arm, which is 
reassuring. 
Conduct of the study 
Overall there were no major concerns regarding the conduct of the study but there is one issue 
to be discussed here. A number of 8 subjects which tested positive for riociguat at some time 
point in the PK analyses out of 126 assumed to receive placebo is rather high. Such a high 
number identified post hoc raises the question, whether there were relevant unidentified 
concerns related to GCP. The applicant provided data that showed that there was no regional 
preference for the mistakes. However, since there was no clue for an explanation, it is unclear, 
whether similar mistakesin patients on treatment occurred.  
According to the applicant the studies were conducted in compliance with GCP. In addition, a 
summary of the results of GCP inspections conducted by the FDA at 5 sites is available, partially 
based on preliminary results. There were deviations from regulations but no significant or 
relevant deviations were identified. The applicant submitted further data regarding these 
inspections, and the data are reassuring regarding the conduct of the trials.

Baseline data 
The main baseline characteristics of the recruited patients are depicted in Table E9. The 
demographics and baseline characteristics of the recruited patients generally reflect the known 
disease distribution, with middle-aged females, with idiopathic and APAH, of FC II/III 
predominating the picture. There is an equal distribution of treatment naïve patients and patients 
pre-treated with PAH medications, mainly ERAs; there is limited representation of patients on 
prostacyclins (5.6% to 7.9% per group). Most of the patients on the riociguat IDT arm (90%) 
were on 2-2.5 mg showing that these doses are well tolerated for at least 12 weeks. 
Numbers analysed

Number of subjects in analysis sets. 
Of the 586 subjects enrolled in the study, 445 were randomized and 443 received at least one 
dose of study medication.  
In accordance with the definitions of analysis sets, all 443 treated subjects were valid for safety 
analysis and for ITT analysis. In this study, the safety analysis set and the ITT analysis set were 
identical in size. Two subjects were randomized but not treated. 
A total of 64 treated subjects had a major protocol deviation and were not valid for per protocol 
analysis. Therefore the per protocol analysis set comprised 379 subjects.  
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
In the primary efficacy analysis, treatment with riociguat IDT resulted in a significant 
improvement in 6MWD from baseline to week 12 as compared to placebo in the ITT analysis set. 
The estimated overall treatment effect from the ANCOVA was 35.78 m (95% CI: 20.06 m to 
51.51 m). The per protocol analysis showed comparable results (estimate of 33.52, 95% CI: 
18.99 m to 48.04 m). Further sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the main analysis.  
Results observed in patients administered riociguat in doses of 1-1.5 mg in the ‘capped titration’ 
arm show comparable results (change from baseline to last visit mean 31.1 m compared to 29.6 
m for the riociguat IDT). Pre-trial it was anticipated that the riociguat capped titration (CT) group 
would confirm the rationale for the individual dose titration (IDT) regimen and that the riociguat 
IDT group would out-perform the riociguat CT group across all endpoints evaluated. However, 
this was not the case. Significant differences are already observed in riociguat CT versus placebo 
for 6MWD (p<0.0001), PVR (p<0.0001), NT proBNP (p<0.0001), but not observed for WHO 
functional class (p=0.0674), time to clinical worsening (p=0.3939) or Borg CR 10 (p=0.1068). 
The latter 2 endpoints are significantly better using the IDT regimen, implying that the full 
therapeutic effect is probably only achieved by that higher dose. The haemodynamic response is 
more obvious (PVR and CO) in the IDT regimen compared to the CT. The value of improvement 
of haemodynamic parameters per se on long term clinical outcomes is not established. However, 
a possible additive value of doses above 1.5 on these parameters cannot be excluded. In 
addition, efficacy in the different subgroups is more consistently observed with the IDT regime, 
specifically in patients with PAH associated with CTD, patients co-administered ERA and smokers 
probably benefit more from the IDT regimen. The fact that most subjects continued the dose 
they were titrated to, speaks to the safety and tolerability of the IDT regimen. As requested, 
efficacy data stratified to the main dose groups are also provided for CHEST 1 and PATENT 1. In

this analysis, no obvious dose response differences would be expected as the dose was not 
randomised but related to an efficacy parameter (blood pressure) and thus to individual PK 
properties. However, it is shown the 2.5 mg TID dose is accompanied by the most consistent 
response regarding the different endpoint measured. 
Based on the above, it can be agreed that available data show robustly the efficacy of the 
proposed maximum dose of 2,5 mg t.i.d in most of the examined subgroups. However, it cannot 
be excluded that in some PAH patients a dose of 1,5 mg t.i.d appears quite adequate as well, 
with no justification for further dose escalation. This is mentioned in section 4.2 of the SmPC. 
Subgroup analyses 
Comparable improvements in 6MWT were observed in treatment naïve (38.36 m; 95% CI: 
14.46-62.26) and combination therapy (35.65 m; 95% CI: 15.04-56.26) (Figure E6). This is a 
surprising observation, considering that the gain in 6MWT shown with combination therapies is 
usually quite limited compared to monotherapy. The result is driven by the small group of 
subjects who had prostanoids background therapy, while those on ERA background therapy 
responded more in line with published trials. The combination with prostacyclin appears to yield 
better results than when riociguat is combined with ERAs. It should be remembered that IV 
prostanoids were excluded in this trial and the Applicant did not specify how many used inhaled 
or subcutaneous prostanoids. Breakdown of the subgroup of patients co-administered 
prostanoids (n=31) shows that one third (n=10) was administered beraprost, which is only 
authorised in Japan. The remaining patients were administered iloprost or treprostinil. Regarding 
the results, it can be agreed with the applicant that generally comparable efficacy in this 
subgroup co-administered prostanoids was shown to that of the whole cohort. However, due to 
their limited representation (n= 21), their explicit mention in the indication is not supported. The 
results are mentioned in section 5.1 of the SmPC.

(meter) by pre-specified subgroups (ITT analysis set PATENT-1]) 
Efficacy in the subgroup of idiopathic PAH appears to be better than in the subgroups associated 
with connective tissue disease, or other forms. For the 6MWD the difference of means in favour 
of riociguat IDT was 42.8 m (95% CI: -23.4 to 62.2) for patients with idiopathic/familial PAH and 
28.1 m (95% CI: -4.4 to 60.6) for patients with connective tissue disease associated PAH. 
Comparable results are however shown in the results of WHO FC. It can be agreed that 
experience with other PAH medications confirm these same findings, possibly related to the 
underlying co-morbidity in PAH associated with CTD. As discussed above, associated PAH is one 
of the groups that clearly benefit from IDT compared to the capped dosing regimen.  
The presented analysis of patients of WHO FC II showed lower results for the 6MWT compared to 
patients with WHO FC III ( least square difference in favour of riociguat IDT of 9.9 m (95% CI: -
11.3 to 31.0) compared to 58.0 m (95% CI: -34.8 to 81.2). The applicant attributes this large 
variability to the difference in the placebo response; the placebo group in WHO FC II showed an 
improvement of 19.4 from baseline to last visit, the placebo group in WHO FC III shows 
deterioration by -27.2 m from baseline to last visit. However, the applicant maintains that as 
long as improvement from baseline to last visit in the riociguat groups is 29.4 m for patients of 
WHO FC II and 30.5 m for patients of WHO FC III, efficacy can be considered comparable in both 
subgroups. Please see discussion regarding WHO FC II in PAH below. 
Limited treatment effect estimates were observed in the regions North America (4.1 m) and 
South America (-4.0 m). This was also recorded in the CTEPH study. Since this was a consistent 
finding in both studies, a chance finding appears unlikely. However, the Applicant has provided a 
thorough evaluation of factors potentially explaining the small/lack of effect of riociguat in North 
and South America. No single factor could be identified explaining this finding. It is, however, 
reassuring that efficacy has been demonstrated in the European population. Furthermore the 
applicant showed that there was no regional clustering of patients in the placebo groups with 
positive plasma levels of riociguat.

Secondary Efficacy Variables 
The results of the secondary efficacy variables are shown in Table E10. 
Table E10 Secondary efficacy variables: Summary of hierarchical testing - Study 12934 
(PATENT-1), ITT analysis set 
Significant improvements in PVR were observed in the riociguat IDT arm compared to placebo. 
Improvements are also shown in relevant subgroups like treatment naïve/pre-treated patients, 
WHO II/WHO III and PAH due to different aetiologies, though with variable degrees. Other 
pulmonary and systemic haemodynamic parameters were also affected. The effects on systemic 
haemodynamics are more of a safety concern, although obviously they cannot be separated from 
the beneficial effects.  
Significant improvements were also seen in NT-proBNP, WHO FC, time to clinical worsening and 
Borg CR 10 score. These results further support the primary efficacy endpoint.  
Significant improvements in TTCW were mainly driven by lesser hospitalisations and starting of 
new PH medications (Table E11). Additional analyses of TTCW using the CHMP definition 
corroborate the results of the analyses of the definitions used in both CHEST-1 and PATENT-1. 
The pivotal studies used a broader definition including administration of a new PAH medication. 
The final differences between the analyses are small and only two patients are excluded when 
using the CHMP definition. The number of patients experiencing clinical worsening according to 
the CHMP definition, were in CHEST-1 (riociguat) 3 (1.7%) and placebo 5 (5.7%) (p = 0.09); in 
PATENT-1 (riociguat) 3 (1.2%), (riociguat capped dose) 2 (3.2%), (placebo) 7 (5.6%); p = 0.01

2.5.3.  Supportive studies 
Study 11349 (CHEST-2)  
Study 11349 (CHEST-2) is an on-going Phase III, open-label, multi-centre, multinational, 
extension study of the long-term safety and efficacy of oral riociguat in subjects with CTEPH. At 
the end of study CHEST-1 subjects who had completed the double-blind part could be entered 
into study CHEST-2. The study includes an interim analysis which comprises 194 subjects (long-
term safety analysis set): 129 subjects from the former riociguat IDT group and 65 from the 
former placebo group. Twelve patients had prematurely discontinued study medication at the 
time of the visit cut-off (03 May 2012) for the interim analysis. The most frequent primary 
reason was death (5/194 [2.6%]). 
The mean change in 6MWD from baseline in study 11348 to week 12 of study 11349 (last 
observation by week 12; 28 weeks total in/on study for 11348 + 11349) was 63.3m in the 
former riociguat group and 35.3 m in the former placebo group. Mean change from baseline in 
study 11348 for the total group (N=194) was 56.5 m at 6 months (n=149), 54.0 m at 9 months 
(n=113), 47.6 m at 12 months (n=93), and 60.7 m at 18 months (n=63) (figure E7).

safety analysis set from study 11349 [CHEST-1]) 
Study 12935 (PATENT-2)  
Study 12935 (PATENT-2) is an on-going Phase III, open-label, multi-centre, extension study of 
the long-term safety and efficacy of oral riociguat in subjects with PAH. At the end PATENT-1, 
subjects who had completed the double-blind part could be entered into study PATENT-2. This 
interim analysis comprises 363 subjects (long-term safety analysis set): 215 subjects from the 
former riociguat IDT group, 52 subjects from the former riociguat capped titration group and 96 
subjects from the former placebo group. Fifty-five patients had prematurely discontinued study 
medication at the time of the visit cut-off (16 April 2012) for the interim analysis, most of them 
either due to adverse event (55/363 [7.2%]) or due to death (14/363 [3.9%]).

The mean change in 6MWD from baseline in study 12934 to week 12 (last observation until week 
12) in study 12935 (24 weeks on-study for 12934 + 12935) was 45.0 m in the former riociguat 
IDT group and 36.5 m in the former placebo group. Mean change from baseline in PATENT-1 for 
the total group (N=363) was 51.2 m at 6 months (n=289), 53.7 m at 9 months (n=247), 48.4 m 
at 12 months (n=214), and 47.3 m at 18 months (n=151)(Figure E8).

2.5.4.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Dose response studies 
The choice of the dose range of 1.0 mg to 2.5 mg t.i.d to be further investigated in phase II/III 
studies was based on the results shown in healthy subjects and the proof of concept study. Dose 
titration is necessary in order to improve tolerability (e.g. hypotension) and also takes into 
consideration the large inter-individual variability in PK. Dose selection is based on systemic 
blood pressure response. As pointed out in the SA procedure EMEA/H/SA/814/I/2006/III, this 
approach takes tolerability mainly into consideration but does not identify the least effective 
dose. A dose based on the response of the pulmonary haemodynamics or 6MWT would have 
been considered a more feasible approach to investigate the efficacy of riociguat. However, it is 
recognised that dosing based on systemic blood pressure response was employed in other PAH 
trials, and therefore the use of systolic blood pressure as a surrogate for the titration endpoint 
was accepted. 
Patients with CTEPH 
In CHEST-1, treatment with riociguat IDT for CTEPH resulted in a significant and clinically 
relevant improvement in 6MWD from baseline to week 16 (last observation until week 16) as 
compared to placebo in the ITT analysis set (45.69 m; 95% CI: 24.74 m to 66.63 m; p<0.0001). 
The robustness of the result is confirmed by the per protocol analysis which showed comparable 
results and sensitivity analyses. The placebo corrected increase of walking distance of 45.69 m is 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 68/118 
 
  
  
 
in line with increases reported in early PAH studies. The results are also more convincing 
compared to those reported with bosentan using a comparable study design and resulting in a 
placebo corrected increase of walking distance of only 2.2 m (BENEFIT, Jais et al, JACC 2008; 
52: 2127-34). A non-significant increase of +18 m was reported with sildenafil in yet another 
study (Suntharalingam et al., Chest 2008).  
Benefits shown for the postoperative CTEPH (26.72 m; 95% CI: -9.68 - 63.13) appear to be of a 
lesser magnitude compared to the inoperable CTEPH (53.92 m; 95% CI: 28.53 - 79.31) in the 6 
MWT, and also in the PVR. The Applicant explained that this smaller gain in 6MWD in patients 
with the postoperative CTEPH compared to inoperable CTEPH is still of clinical importance 
especially as other secondary efficacy parameters corroborate the benefit seen. There was no 
difference between postoperative and inoperable patients with respect to change in WHO FC. 
Albeit changes in NT-pro BNP were favourable, these are not an accepted surrogate for clinical 
benefit. The applicant has discussed baseline characteristics such as PVR and location of thrombi 
which could influence the results. Accordingly, it is agreed that confounding by indication may 
confuse the interpretation of the results, as (1) subjects that are selected for surgery are 
different from all (inoperable) CTEPH patients and (2) subjects that do not respond well to 
surgery are different from all surgically treated patients. Considering the overall positive result, 
the consistency in both subgroups, the expected higher variability of results in subgroups and the 
consistent results in secondary endpoints, it is agreed that patients with postoperative CTEPH 
should not be excluded from the overall indication in patients with CTEPH.  
In a re-analysis of the data, the applicant presented the results of WHO FC II and III separately. 
As expected, patients with less severe disease have a smaller gain than patients with more 
advanced disease: with a least square difference in favour of riociguat of 25.4 m (95% CI: -9.9 
to 60.6) for WHO FC II at baseline compared to 56.0 m (95% CI: -29.4 to 82.6) for patients with 
WHO FC III. This limited efficacy was not further supported by improvements in WHO status or 
improvement in clinical worsening events; although for PVR and NT pro-BNP the benefits were 
almost equal for WHO FC II and III. 
The applicant attributes the differences at least in part, due to improvements in the WHO II 
placebo group. The placebo group improved in FC II (+19m) but worsened in FC III ( 16.9m), 
while the changes in the active groups were similar (+45.3m and +37.8m respectively). If non-
specific effects of placebo are more relevant in WHO II, the treatment effect is actually lower. 
Similarly, in PATENT-1, efficacy in terms of 6MWT was limited in patients with WHO FC II. Please 
see the discussion on WHO FC II below. 
Female CTEPH subjects showed a higher estimated treatment effect in analyses by gender 
compared to male subjects (54.21 m; 95% CI: 27.73 m to 80.70 m vs. 39.80 m; 95% CI: 8.60 
m to 71.00 m). Summary statistics showed that male CTEPH subjects treated with placebo 
showed an increase in 6MWD although having relatively high baseline values. The treatment 
group by gender interaction test did not indicate that the observed difference in 6MWT between 
men and women is significant. Even in case where a true difference in the effect on the 6MWD 
was observed, such a difference was not reflected in relevant secondary endpoints as change in 
WHO class. Overall the data are consistent with a clinically relevant effect in male and female 
patients. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 69/118 
 
  
  
The reported results of the secondary endpoints further support the benefits shown in the 6MWT. 
Pulmonary haemodynamics are improved; specifically PVR shows a reduction of around 30%. 
This is line with results observed with bosentan (around -24%) (Jais et al., 2009) and sildenafil 
(around -27%) (Suntharalingam et al., 2008).  
Patients with PAH 
PATENT-1 investigated riociguat in the treatment of PAH. In this trial, the inclusion of both 
treatment naïve patients and patients on other PAH therapies was already a point of discussion in 
the scientific advice given to the Applicant in 2008. It was communicated to the Applicant that 
the inclusion of both these populations in one study is not encouraged as the benefit/risk 
assessment in each population could differ. As there is lack of authorised combination therapies, 
this would have been the preferred subgroup to be examined. Surprisingly, the estimate for the 
primary efficacy outcome in pre-treated and naïve patients was quite similar. 
The study design follows that of pivotal studies that were the base of registration of the available 
medicinal products, e.g. bosentan, sildenafil and ambrisentan. This design was considered 
adequate at that time, but is becoming obsolete nowadays. Improvement of exercise capacity is 
still acceptable in the CHMP guideline (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/356954/2008) as an evidence of 
efficacy; however, this should be demonstrated in a comparative design and not placebo-
controlled. For the treatment naïve patients, there are already around seven medicinal products; 
the investigation of a new medicinal product using the 6MWT with a placebo comparator raises 
ethical concerns. Besides withholding an effective therapy, it is observed that even when these 
placebo patients are switched to the active therapy in the long term extension studies, a lag in 
response is noticed compared to the patients randomised to the active arm from the beginning.  
In the latest scientific advice requested by the company, following the publishing of the above 
guideline, it was clarified that the 6MWT was still a valid endpoint, however, investigations of 
clinical outcomes would be more relevant and TTCW should have been the preferred choice as 
primary or key secondary endpoint.  
The estimated overall treatment effect from the ANCOVA was 35.78 m (95% CI: 20.06 m to 
51.51 m). The per protocol analysis showed comparable results (estimate of 33.52, 95% CI: 
18.99 m to 48.04 m). Further sensitivity analyses confirmed the results of the main analysis. 
This increase is also considered clinically relevant as it compares to results of pivotal studies of 
registered products for PAH. 
In PATENT-1 the LS mean difference of the treatment effect for PVR was –225.72 dyn∙s∙cm-5. 
The reduction in PVR was of the same magnitude as reported for sildenafil (SUPER: -122 to -261 
in the active groups; tadalafil (PHIRST: -254 to -209), and bosentan (EARLY: -141). These 
results are comparable, taking into account the inherent difficulties of cross comparison between 
trials. Improvements are also shown in relevant subgroups like treatment naïve/pre-treated 
patients, WHO II/WHO III and PAH due to different aetiologies, though with variable degrees. 
Other pulmonary and systemic haemodynamic parameters were also affected.  
The improvement in TTCW also reached statistical significance (riociguat: 3 events (1.2%), 
placebo 8 events 6.3%). This result was mainly driven by lesser hospitalisations and starting of 
new PH medications. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 70/118 
 
  
  
Significant improvements were also seen in NT-proBNP, WHO FC, and Borg CR 10 score. These 
results further support the primary efficacy endpoint.  
WHO FC II (CTEPH and PAH).  
In order to determine efficacy in this subgroup, the applicant was requested to further analyse 
the data regarding benefits in treatment naïve vs. patients on combination therapy (PATENT-1), 
and inoperable vs. post-operative CTEPH (CHEST-1). Long term data of these patients were also 
considered. Analysis did not reveal consistent results, with wide confidence intervals, which could 
be expected from the limited number of patients, the un-even distribution at baseline (which 
could be a chance finding) and the post hoc nature of the analysis. Also some subgroups showed 
unexplained placebo responses. However, clinical trial experience indicates that it is always 
difficult to show robust improvements in such patients as the margin in improvement is limited. 
Also, there was quite some improvement in the placebo group limiting the difference and there 
are wide confidence intervals in the results. In fact maintaining a patient to FC II is a goal of PAH 
therapy. It also does not appear plausible that riociguat would only work in the more ill patients 
and it can be assumed that at least in some less diseased patients a beneficial effect may occur. 
Considering that patients can shift between FC II and III, it does not appear practical to 
specifically exclude FC II patients from the indication; this would probably only lead to the off-
label use of the drug in this subgroup. The proposed indication reflects the studied subgroups 
which were mainly FC II and III, rather than the efficacy shown in each subgroup (which is 
discrepant depending on the subgroup). There is a cross reference to section 5.1, where the 
results are described, allowing the prescriber to make an informed decision.  
2.5.5.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of riociguat in CTEPH and PAH is supported mainly by two pivotal studies in adult 
patients, and their long-term extensions. There are no data in children. The starting dose of 
1 mg three times daily up to maximum total daily dose of 7.5 mg were seen to be well tolerated. 
However, in some PAH patients it cannot be excluded that lower doses (1.5 mg three times a 
day) would still be effective. This is mentioned in section 4.2 of the SmPC. Significant efficacy is 
observed in terms of improvement in exercise capacity; which although accepted in the relevant 
guideline is not the preferred endpoint due to lack of correlation with clinical outcomes. However, 
CHEST-1 is the only study to demonstrate a significant benefit for a pharmacological therapy for 
inoperable and persistent CTEPH after operation.  
In PAH, PATENT-1 showed the efficacy of riociguat as monotherapy and in combination, mainly 
on top of ERAs. The results pertaining combination therapy are especially important. 
In conclusion the CHMP agreed to grant an indication in both CTEPH and PAH populations. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Main safety information for riociguat is based on the pivotal studies (CHEST-1 and PATENT-1; 
POOL-1 DB) and their on-going long term extensions (CHEST-2 and PATENT-2; POOL-1 LTE; cut-
off date April/May 2012). In addition, pooled analysis of studies conducted in CTEPH and PAH 
was done and forms POOl-2. POOl-3 represents safety data from all completed phase II and 
CHMP assessment report

phase III clinical studies. In this report, focus is given on the analysis of POOL-1, in addition to 
results of each pivotal study. Reference is also made as appropriate to the other safety data. 
2.6.1.  Patient exposure 
Safety data are presented per study and also as pooled data. Pooling of the main clinical studies 
CHEST-1 and PATENT-1 is supported due to the somewhat comparable patient populations. 
Controlled data are available for 490 patients administered riociguat compared to 214 patients 
administered placebo for at least 12 weeks (table S1). Although these numbers are limited, this 
safety database can be accepted in an orphan indication. Long term exposure (around one year) 
data available for 557 patients are considered adequate to assess long-term safety. These 
studies are on-going.

2.6.2.  Adverse events 
The system organ class (SOC) disorders mostly seen and with a higher rate of reported adverse 
events in the riociguat treatment group were gastrointestinal disorders (53% riociguat vs. 35% 
placebo) and nervous disorders (46% vs. 33%). The most frequently reported adverse events 
with a higher rate in the riociguat treatment group were headache (27% vs. 17%) followed by 
dizziness (19% vs. 12%) and dyspepsia (18% vs. 8%) (see table S3). This profile is in line with 
the mechanism of action as a vasodilator.

Table S3: Summary of adverse events 
Table S4: Most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events and their assessment for 
drug-relationship (safety analysis set from controlled clinical studies in the claimed 
indication)  
In general, the profile of drug-related AEs is similar to the profile of adverse events overall (table 
S4). The exceptions are the PTs dyspnoea, chest pain, anaemia and nasopharyngitis, which the 
investigators mostly assessed as not drug-related. 
The incidence rate of AEs in the long-term extension studies was 91%. The most common AEs 
were nasopharyngitis (21%), dizziness (18%), peripheral oedema (17%), diarrhoea (13%), 
cough (13%), headache (13%), nausea (11%), and dyspepsia (10%).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 74/118 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The rate of riociguat nasopharyngitis reported with riociguat is comparable to those seen with 
ERA treatment. Nasal congestion is a typical event related to mode of action, and was identified 
as an ADR for riociguat. Nasopharyngitis per se is an infectious disease, and considered 
implausible to be caused by riociguat. Notably, nasopharyngitis was reported for over 10% of 
placebo subjects. The imbalance for nasopharyngitis reported as an adverse event for PATENT-1 
and CHEST-1 might be caused by a certain degree of misreporting, e.g. if a patient had the 
feeling of a “stuffed nose” under verum caused by nasal congestion.  
The rate of common adverse events per 100 person years during long-term treatment was lower 
than in the initial double-blind treatment phase; this probably indicates some adaptation to the 
haemodynamic changes induced by riociguat. However, the rate of pulmonary artery 
hypertension AEs increases during the long-term treatment phase from 2 events/100 person 
years in the riociguat treatment group during double-blind treatment (4 events/100 person years 
in the placebo group) to 7 events/100 person years. The incidence rate of adverse events 
reported as of severe intensity was higher during the long-term extension phase (22%) than 
reported in the riociguat treated subjects during the shorter double-blind treatment phase 
(11%). 
2.6.3.  Serious adverse events and deaths 
2.6.3.1.  SAEs 
In POOL-1 DB, serious adverse events SAEs were reported for 15% of the riociguat groups and 
for 17% of placebo patients. The most common serious adverse events with an incidence rate ≥ 
1% were syncope (1.4% [7/490] riociguat vs. 3.7% [8/214] placebo), right ventricular failure 
(2.2% [11/490] riociguat vs. 1.9% [4/214] placebo), and haemoptysis (1.0% [5/490] riociguat 
vs. 0% [0/214] placebo)(see table S5).  
Table S5: Serious TEAEs: Most frequent MedDRA preferred terms – safety population of 
controlled Phase III studies 
Specifically in CHEST-1, serious pulmonary hypertension and respiratory failure were more 
frequent in the riociguat-group than in placebo-group. Clarification of “deterioration of pulmonary 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 75/118 
 
  
  
 
function” is based on an analysis of the occurrence of serious adverse events in the MedDRA SOC 
“Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders”, for which 4 events were seen in the riociguat 
group compared to none in placebo. A detailed by-case evaluation revealed no identifiable reason 
for deterioration of respiratory function, apart from clinical worsening which is not uncommon in 
this patient population on the background of the disease and/or comorbidities. The serious TEAEs 
(PT) pulmonary hypertension were reported in 2 (1.2%) patients in riociguat versus 0 in placebo 
and serious respiratory failure events were reported in 2 (1.2%) patients in riociguat vs. 0 in 
placebo. A total of 4 patients experienced these SAEs, all in the riociguat arm. These events are 
generally expected in these patients, and the results of the TTCW analysis support that disease 
progression was not accelerated in the riociguat group. 
Although the incidence of SAE appears comparable in both groups, there are a number of serious 
events that appear only in the riociguat treatment arm: haemoptysis (n=5) and acute renal 
failure (n=3) (see later). The rest of the reported serious events appear to be in line with the 
vasodilatation profile of riociguat. 
The number of SAEs in the respective long-term extension studies was 36% and approximately 
two-fold higher than for any of the treatment groups during the shorter double-blind treatment 
phase. This is normalised if treatment duration is taken into consideration (event rate per 100 
person years: 92 in all riociguat vs. 103 in placebo POOL-1 DB and 65 in riociguat POOL-1 LTE). 
The most common SAEs with an event rate of at least 2% from the long-term extension were 
syncope (5.4%), pulmonary arterial hypertension (4.5%), right ventricular failure (4.1%), 
pulmonary hypertension (2.9%), cardiac catheterisation (2.7%), and pneumonia (2.0%). The 
event rate per 100 person years increased for the PTs pulmonary arterial hypertension, right 
ventricular failure, pulmonary hypertension, and cardiac catheterisation.  
2.6.3.2.  Deaths 
In POOL-1 DB, the incidence rate of death was numerically higher in the placebo group (3.3%; 
7/214) compared to riociguat treated patients (1.0%; 5/490).  
In CHEST-1, two deaths were reported in the riociguat group: one case was attributed to cardiac 
failure. The other case had an acute renal failure and deterioration of right heart failure 
complicated thereafter by a haemorrhage from the catheter site of the haemodialysis and 
consecutive anaemia. The subject died ten days after onset of renal failure. The investigator 
classified death as caused by renal impairment, bleeding and anaemia. In the placebo group 
three deaths were reported: cardiac arrest (n=2), and cardiopulmonary failure (n=1).  
In PATENT-1, three deaths in the riociguat group were reported: one due to sepsis (riociguat IDT 
group), one due to right ventricular failure and pulmonary arterial hypertension (riociguat capped 
titration group) and one case due to haemoptysis. The subject had one event of haemoptysis 
already directly prior to enrolment in the study, another one two days after start of study 
medication with outcome resolved, was continued in the study and had a third event with fatal 
outcome 55 days after start of study medication. The investigator assigned death to 
haemoptysis. In the placebo group, the following causes were reported: pulmonary arterial 
hypertension (n=1), anxiety (n=1), and respiratory failure and circulatory collapse (n=1). (One 
patient on placebo died in PATENT-2). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 76/118 
 
  
  
During the long-term extension phase (mean treatment duration 14 months) 23/557 (4.1%) 
deaths were reported. The majority of deaths were sequelae of the underlying disease which 
include right ventricular failure (1), cardiac failure chronic (1), cardiac failure (1), pulmonary 
hypertension (5), pulmonary arterial hypertension (3), pneumonia (2), pulmonary haemorrhage 
(3), cardiac arrest (3), sudden cardiac death (1), cardiogenic shock (1) and shock (1) – note that 
more than one event could have a fatal outcome. 
2.6.4.  Adverse events of special interest 
1. Hypotension 
Hypertension was identified as an adverse event linked to the mode of action and was also used 
to guide the individual dose titration. Overall, treatment-emergent hypotension events 
(documented as AE or recorded SBP<90 mmHg) were reported in 23.3% of subjects in the 
pooled riociguat group and 12.1% in the pooled placebo group. Most of the treatment-emergent 
hypotension events were non-serious: hypotension (AE or SBP<90 mmHg) was reported as a 
serious TEAE in only two subjects (0.4%) in the riociguat group. Only one discontinuation due to 
hypotension as a TEAE was reported, also in the riociguat group. Comparing the rates recorded 
in the riociguat IDT with the capped titration (AR; table S4), an advantage in the incidence of 
hypotension is observed with the lower dose (3.2% capped dose vs. 9.8% with the IDT). This 
shows that even if patients can tolerate the higher doses by titration, they are still at risk of AEs 
related to hypotension during drug administration. 
For age subgroups, the difference in incidence of hypotension (AE or SBP<90 mmHg) between 
the treatment groups was larger in the ≥75 years subgroup (29.5% for riociguat vs. 10.0% for 
placebo) than overall; in this subgroup hypotension was not reported as a serious TEAE, and no 
subjects discontinued study medication due to hypotension (AE or SBP<90 mmHg). 
For renal function subgroups, the incidence of hypotension (AE or SBP<90 mmHg) in the pooled 
riociguat group was higher in subjects with moderate renal impairment (baseline eGFR (≥ 30 to 
<50 mL/min) than overall, and the difference in incidence between the treatment groups was 
larger in this subgroup (31.6% for riociguat vs. 8.3% for placebo) than overall. A smaller 
difference between treatment groups was observed in subjects with mild renal impairment 
(baseline eGFR (CGF) ≥50 to <80 mL/min): 23.3% for riociguat vs. 14.7% for placebo. These 
subgroups appear to be more vulnerable to the hypotensive effect of riociguat than other and 
such risk is highlighted in SmPC section 4.4. In addition, as the clinical studies excluded patients 
with SBP below 95 mm Hg and due to the risk of hypotension, this is currently a contraindication 
in the SmPC (this is also in line with the SmPC of sildenafil and tadalafil). 
For subgroups on combination therapy, the difference in incidence of hypotension (AE or SBP<90 
mmHg) between the treatment groups was smaller in the ERA pre-treated subgroup (21.7% for 
riociguat vs. 17.0% for placebo) than in the other subgroups for pre-treatment. The overall 
incidence of hypotension (AE or SBP<90 mmHg) in the pooled riociguat group was higher in 
subjects pre-treated with PCA (40.9%) than in subjects pre-treated with ERA (21.7%), but the 
total number of subjects in the pre-treated with PCA subgroup was small. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 77/118 
 
  
  
There could be some adaptation to the vasodilatory effects as shown by a lower incidence of AE 
in the longer term (15 events per 100 person years for placebo during double-blind treatment vs. 
7 for all riociguat in LTE). For further discussion see the section “Discussion on clinical safety” of 
this report.  
2. Syncope 
Syncope can be a sign of the disease or related to the drug (e.g. through hypotension). Overall, 
syncope was reported in a slightly lower rate in the pooled riociguat group (n=16; 3.3%) 
compared to the pooled placebo group (4.7%). These events were assessed as serious in eight 
subjects (1.6%) in the pooled riociguat group and ten subjects (4.7%) in the pooled placebo 
group. Two subjects discontinued study medication because of syncope TEAEs (one with riociguat 
and one with placebo). 
The overall rate of syncope declined in the pooled LTE studies (8.06 events per 100 person years 
in the LTE compared to 14.79 events per 100 person years for riociguat, 20.55 for placebo in the 
DB phase). Syncope events were assessed as serious in 31 subjects (5.6%). No subject 
discontinued study medication because of a syncope TEAE. The vast majority of subjects in both 
treatment groups had a single syncope event. Syncope events were not related to drug exposure 
or a change of riociguat dose during the titration phase, thus not directly connected to the intake 
of riociguat. Many of the syncope events occurred as exertional syncopes, which is typically 
observed in subjects with PH. There is no indication that syncope should be regarded as an 
adverse drug reaction related to administration of riociguat, as such syncope is not listed in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
3. Bleeding events 
The overall incidence rate of bleeding events in all riociguat treated subjects 15.7% (77/490) 
was comparable to placebo subjects in POOL-1 14.5% (33/214). Most of the subjects in both 
groups had an outcome of recovered or resolved. However, SAEs (12/490 [2.4%] riociguat vs. 
none placebo), AE related deaths (2/490 [0.4%] riociguat vs. none placebo) and discontinuations 
due to AE (2/490 [0.4%] riociguat vs. none placebo) were reported for the riociguat group only. 
The two death cases comprise one subject with haemoptysis and one subject with catheter site 
haemorrhage. The investigators assessed both fatal events as not related to the study 
medication. The most frequent TE bleeding events in the pooled controlled studies were: 
  Riociguat treatment group: epistaxis (2.9%), haemoptysis (2.0%), haematoma (1.2%), 
vaginal haemorrhage (0.8%), gingival bleeding (0.6%). 
 
Placebo treatment group: epistaxis (1.4%), haematoma (1.4%), conjunctival 
haemorrhage (0.9%), puncture site haemorrhage (0.9%), vessel puncture site 
haemorrhage (0.9%), menorrhagia (0.9%), and haemoptysis (0.9%). 
Haemoptysis, reported with riociguat at a rate of 2.0% (10/490) vs. the placebo rate of 0.9% 
(2/214), was assessed as SAE in riociguat treated subjects only (5/490 [1.0%] riociguat vs. none 
placebo). One subject had a fatal outcome (see before), all other events had an outcome of 
recovered or resolved. During LTE additional 21/557 events were reported, 7 of them assessed 
as SAEs, 18 of them with an outcome of recovered or resolved and 3 not recovered or resolved. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 78/118 
 
  
  
In terms of the event rate per 100 person years haemoptysis decreased during the LTE phase (9 
events per 100 person years in all riociguat vs. 6 in placebo and 5 for all riociguat during LTE). In 
POOL-3 haemoptysis was reported as AE in 13/754 (1.7%) riociguat vs. 2/289 (0.7%) placebo) 
and as SAEs in 5/754 (0.7%) riociguat vs. none placebo. No additional fatal outcome occurred in 
POOL-3; all other events had an outcome of recovered or resolved. During LTE additional 24/642 
events were reported, 9 of them assessed as SAEs, 20 of them with an outcome of recovered or 
resolved and 4 not recovered or resolved. In terms of the event rate per 100 person years 
haemoptysis decreased during the LTE phase (8 events per 100 person years in all riociguat vs. 4 
in placebo and 4 for all riociguat during LTE). 
Pulmonary haemorrhages were reported with an incidence of 3/642 [0.5%] in POOL-1, all of 
them occurred during the long-term extended treatment; all of them had a fatal outcome. The 
data of POOL-3 did not contain additional events of pulmonary haemorrhage. 
The Applicant informed the CHMP about this bleeding risk through a safety communication in 
November 2012. Investigators involved in the LTE studies were informed as well. These events 
are reported in both PAH and CTEPH.  
For further discussion see the section “Discussion on clinical safety” of this report. 
4. Anaemia 
Anaemia was reported with a higher rate in the riociguat group (7.8% [38/490]) compared to 
placebo (1.9% [4/214]) (POOL-1 DB). This is reflected in the observed decrease of haemoglobin 
(approximately 0.5 mg/dL whereas the values in the placebo group remained stable) and of 
haematocrit (approximately 2% whereas the values in the placebo group remained stable). The 
decrease seen during the double-blind period tended to be lower during the LTE phase (23 
events per 100 person years in all riociguat vs. 9 in placebo and 7 for all riociguat during LTE).   
For further discussion see the section “Discussion on clinical safety” of this report. 
5. GI disorders 
GI disorders were reported in a higher frequency in the riociguat pool (255/490; 52%) compared 
to the placebo pool (72/214; 34%) in POOL-1 DB. AEs leading to discontinuation were reported 
in the riociguat group at 2/490 [0.4%] compared to 1/214 [0.5%] in placebo. The most frequent 
PTs with a higher rate in riociguat group compared to placebo were: dyspepsia (18% riociguat 
vs. 8% placebo), nausea (14% vs. 11%), diarrhoea (12% vs. 8%) and gastro-oesophageal reflux 
disease (5% vs. 2%). Serious cases of gastritis were only recorded in the riociguat group in 
POOL-1 DB.  
Gastrointestinal disorders as SOC were observed both in riociguat and placebo groups. Serious 
adverse events of gastritis (4x) and bleedings (2x) as treatment-emergent SAEs were observed 
only in riociguat treated patients. 
For further discussion see the section “Discussion on clinical safety” of this report. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 79/118 
 
  
  
6. Atrial fibrillation 
Atrial Fibrillation was reported in a higher rate in the riociguat pooled arm [5/490 (1.0%) vs. 
none placebo in POOL-1 DB, and more so in POOL-3 (riociguat:13/754; 1.7% vs. none in 
placebo). AF was assessed as SAE in 4 out of the 13 events. In both long-term extension studies, 
CHEST-2 and PATENT-2, AF was observed at lower rate per 100 person years than during the 
double-blind phase (10/100 person years for all riociguat during double-blind treatment vs. 
2/100 for all riociguat in LTE).  
For further discussion see the section “Discussion on clinical safety” of this report. 
7. Renal Impairment 
There are conflicting data regarding the possible effects of riociguat on renal function. On one 
hand, analyses of respective laboratory parameters did not indicate a trend for renal function to 
worsen,  but rather a small improvement compared to placebo was seen during the double-blind 
treatment phase (blood creatinine increased (8/754 [1.1%] for all riociguat and 11/289 [3.8%] 
for placebo), blood urea increased (3/754 [0.4%] for all riociguat and 7/289 [2.4%] for placebo), 
and creatinine renal clearance decreased (2/754 [0.3%] for all riociguat and 3/289 [1.0%] for 
placebo). On the other hand, there was an imbalance for AE relating to serious renal impairment: 
POOL-1 (3/490 [0.6%] all riociguat for each renal failure and renal failure acute; 2/490 [0.4%] 
all riociguat for renal failure chronic versus none in placebo subjects for any of these PTs. This 
imbalance was also apparent in POOL-3 (SAE of renal failure were observed in ten subjects 
(1.3%) in the riociguat group versus one subject (0.3%) in the placebo group).  
For further discussion see the section “Discussion on clinical safety” of this report. 
8. Bone disorders 
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies, riociguat-related effects on the skeletal system consistent 
with stimulation of osteoblasts were restricted to juvenile and adolescent rats and mice (see 
“Non-clinical Toxicology” section of this report). The implications of the adverse effects on bone 
encountered in growing rats on paediatric patients in whom the epiphysis is not yet closed are 
not clear. Until more is known, the use of riociguat in children and in growing adolescents should 
be avoided (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.3 of the SmPC).  
According to the Applicant results of serum calcium, phosphate, and 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D 
and the biomarkers type I collagen C-telopeptides (CTX) and osteopontin were evaluated in the 
study program and did not show a clinically meaningful change during treatment and no 
difference was observed between the riociguat and placebo groups. This view is not totally 
supported in view of the results of study 13790. In addition, the rate of bone fractures was 
overall low but was higher in the riociguat-group compared to the placebo-group. This risk is 
adequately addressed in the RMP as an important potential risk. 
9. QT prolongation 
No thorough QT study was performed. Pre-clinical data show possible QT prolongation in dogs, 
but this is considered a consequence of an inadequate correction rather than an intrinsic QT 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 80/118 
 
  
  
prolonging effect of riociguat. Pooled analysis of PATENT-1 and CHEST-1 provides data on a 
sample which comprises 283 riociguat subjects and 100 placebo subjects. Mean changes from 
baseline do not indicate prolongation of QTcB (e.g. mean change from baseline to week 12/13 of 
0 msec in the riociguat group compared to + 2 msec in the placebo group) (table S6) and QTcF 
(e.g. mean change from baseline to week 12/13 of +1 msec in the riociguat group compared to 
+1 msec in the placebo group). 
Further supportive data regarding the QT assessment come from LEPHT Study (riociguat in 
patients with PH related to left hear failure). The database is limited (14 subjects of the 0.5 mg 
riociguat treatment group, 9 subjects of the 1.0 mg riociguat treatment group, 18 subjects of the 
2.0 mg riociguat treatment group, and 22 subjects of the placebo group). The mean changes of 
the QT duration was clinically not different between the treatment groups (as indicated by the 
mean change from baseline to last visit of -16 msec in the riociguat 2.0 mg group compared to + 
5 msec in the placebo group). Similar results were seen for QTcB.  
In view of the available data QT prolongation is not considered an adverse drug reaction related 
to administration of riociguat, and as such is not listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC.   
2.6.5.  Laboratory findings 
Haematology. 
 Imbalances in the mean changes from baseline to Week 12 were observed for: 
- haemoglobin: riociguat group: –0.58 g/dL, placebo group: 0.13 g/dL 
- haematocrit: riociguat group: –1.66%, placebo group: 0.45% 
For the pooled non-controlled extension studies, changes in group values from baseline were 
again small for most of the haematology and coagulation parameters. For haemoglobin, mean 
change from baseline was –0.24 g/dL at Month 9 (n=254) and –0.28 g/dL at Month 21–23 
(n=207). For haematocrit, mean change from baseline was –0.62% at Month 9 (n=253) and –
0.78% at Month 21–23 (n=207). In the pooled controlled phase III studies, 80/443 subjects 
(18.1%) in the riociguat group, and 7/190 subjects (3.7%) in the placebo group reported 
haemoglobin abnormalities. In the pooled non-controlled extension studies, 141/504 subjects 
(28.0%) reported haemoglobin abnormalities (see above comments on anaemia). 
Coagulation 
In  the  pooled  controlled  phase  III  studies,  imbalances  in  high  laboratory  abnormalities  (a 
threefold increase compared to the upper limit of normal range18) were seen for: 
- aPTT: riociguat group: 3/172 subjects (1.7%), placebo group: 6/71 subjects (8.5%)

(7.8%) 
Results  are  reassuring  and  do  not  raise  concerns.  However,  for  the  pooled  non-controlled 
extension  studies,  high  laboratory  abnormalities  were  reported  for  aPTT  and  prothrombin  INR: 
CHMP assessment report

10/181 subjects (5.5%) reported a threefold increase for aPTT, and 28/200 subjects (14.0%) for 
prothrombin INR.  At  follow up, there  was still  an  increase noticed in the terms  "INR increased" 
and  "aPTT  prolonged"  in  the  LTE  compared  to  data  with  cut-off  May  2013:  2.91  compared  to 
3.88; 1.91 compared to 2.79 per 100 person-years respectively. As anticoagulation is part of the 
routine management  of  PAH and CTEPH  patients, the risk of bleeding  is adequately  reflected in 
the RMP as an important potential and also included as a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Vital signs. 
Blood Pressure. In the pooled controlled phase III studies, the mean change in SBP at Week 12 
was –6.83 mmHg (SD±12.85) in the riociguat group, and –1.80 mmHg (SD±13.14) in the 
placebo group. For the pooled non-controlled extension studies, the mean change was –4.39 
mmHg at Month 9 (n=280), and –3.93 mmHg at Month 21-23 (n=221). The mean DBP change 
from baseline to Week 12 was –5.91 mmHg (SD±10.20) in the riociguat group, and -0.26 mmHg 
(SD±10.15) in the placebo group. In the pooled non-controlled extension studies, the mean DBP 
change from baseline to Month 9 (n=280) was –4.90 mmHg, and –5.24 mmHg at Month 21-23 
(n=221) (see comments before in hypotension). 
No relevant changes in heart rate or body weight were observed in the short controlled or 
longer term extension studies: 
Heart rate. In the pooled controlled phase III studies, the mean change from baseline to Week 
12 was 0.22 beats/min (SD±10.50) in the riociguat group, and 0.93 beats/min (SD±10.40) in 
the placebo group. In the pooled non-controlled extension studies, the mean change from 
baseline to Month 9 (n=280) was 1.33 beats/min, and 0.02 beats/min at Month 21-23 (n=220). 
Body weight. The mean change from baseline to Week 12 was –0.30 kg (SD±2.84) in the 
riociguat group, and 0.26 kg (SD±2.26) in the placebo group. In the pooled non-controlled 
extension studies, the mean change from baseline to Month 9 (n=277) was –0.57 kg, and –0.55 
kg at Month 21-23 (n=221). 
ECG. See section QT prolongation, and atrial fibrillation before. 
2.6.6.  Safety in special populations 
Renal impairment 
Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment were adequately represented in the pivotal 
studies. More than 35% (189/490 [39%] for POOL-1 DB and 210/557 [38%] for POOL-1 (LTE) of 
riociguat treated subjects had mild renal impairment at baseline and approximately 20% 
(101/490 [21%] POOL-1 DB and 106/557 [19%] for POOL-1 LTE) of subjects had a moderate 
renal impairment. Event rates for TEAEs, TESAEs and most of the MedDRA PTs did not 
substantially increase with decreasing renal function in the riociguat treatment group when 
compared to placebo. Although the dose is individually titrated, there is still a higher incidence of 
hypotension reported in these patients (see before under hypotension). This is currently reflected 
as a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Subjects with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/min at 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 82/118 
 
  
  
baseline were excluded. Patients with severe renal impairment are generally more at risk for 
haemodynamic AEs and the use of riociguat should not be recommended in these patients. 
Hepatic impairment 
There is no clinical experience in the pivotal studies in patients with different degrees of hepatic 
impairment in general. In cirrhotic patients (non-smokers) with mild hepatic impairment 
(classified as Child Pugh A) riociguat mean AUC was increased by 35% compared to healthy 
controls which is within normal intra-individual variability, whereas riociguat mean AUC was 
increased by 51% compared to healthy controls in patients with moderate hepatic impairment 
(Child Pugh B). It is agreed with the Applicant that dose titration can be sufficient guidance for 
the balance of efficacy and safety in these patients.  
There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh C), and 
considering available PK data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, these patients are 
contraindicated. Likewise, use of riociguat in other patients with significant liver disease (e.g. 
cirrhosis, acute clinical or chronic active hepatitis, ALT > 3 x ULN, bilirubin > 2 x ULN) should not 
be recommended, due to lack of clinical experience. 
Elderly 
The frequency of SAEs, cardiac disorders (palpitation/tachycardia), vascular disorders (mostly 
hypotension), dizziness, peripheral edema and vomiting tended to increase with increasing age. 
Increased rate of hypotension did not lead to increased rate of syncope.  
For further discussion see the section “Discussion on clinical safety” of this report. 
2.6.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Background PAH therapy 
Hypotension among ERA-pre-treated patients occurred at a similar rate in the riociguat (5.8%) 
and placebo groups (5.7%), but among therapy-naive patients, hypotension was reported in the 
riociguat group only (9.7%).  
The interaction with sildenafil was investigated in two studies. Both studies showed additive 
systemic hypotensive action. In study 15096, the combination resulted in a higher rate of 
discontinuation, more AEs related to hypotension and one case of death related to hypotension 
cannot be ruled out. The interaction is listed as a contraindication (see section 4.3 of the SmPC). 
The interaction with PDE5 inhibitors is discussed in the Pharmacodynamics section. 
Peripheral oedema among both ERA-pre-treated and therapy-naive patients occurred more 
frequently in the riociguat (21% and 16.8% respectively) compared to the placebo group (9.4% 
and 12.1% respectively).   
For further discussion see the section “Discussion on clinical safety” of this report.

2.6.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the pooled controlled studies, TEAEs leading to discontinuations were reported less frequently 
in the riociguat group (n=14; 2.9%) than the placebo group (n=11; 5.1%). This is reassuring 
regarding the tolerability of riociguat. The most frequent TEAEs leading to discontinuations in the 
riociguat group across both studies were in the MedDRA primary system organ classes cardiac 
disorders (three subjects), gastrointestinal disorders (two subjects), general disorders and 
administration site conditions (two subjects) and nervous system disorders (two subjects). The 
most frequent TEAEs leading to discontinuations in the placebo group across both studies were in 
the primary system organ classes cardiac disorders (two subjects) and respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders (5 subjects). 
In the pooled LTE studies, TEAEs leading to discontinuations were reported in 31 subjects 
(5.6%). The most frequent TEAEs leading to discontinuations by preferred term were: pulmonary 
hypertension (1.0%) in CHEST-2 and pulmonary arterial hypertension (1.1%) and pulmonary 
hypertension (0.8%) in PATENT-2. These reasons for discontinuation probably signify disease 
progression. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Riociguat belongs to a new pharmacological class, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators; so there 
is no previous safety experience. Safety data is presented per study and also as pooled data. 
Pooling of the main clinical studies CHEST-1 and PATENT-1 is supported due to the somewhat 
comparable patient populations. Controlled data is available for 490 patients administered 
riociguat compared to 214 patients administered placebo for at least 12 weeks. Though limited 
numbers, it can be accepted in an orphan indication. Long term exposure (around one year) 
available for 557 patients; this exposure is considered adequate to reveal possible long term 
safety.  
The reported adverse event profile in the placebo-controlled trials is in line with the mechanism 
of action as a vasodilator; the most common drug related AE are headache, dyspepsia, dizziness 
and nausea and hypotension. Results are comparable to those reported with PDE5 inhibitors. The 
rate of reported AE declines in the long term extensions, which probably indicates some 
adaptation to the haemodynamic changes induced by riociguat. The increased incidence of AE 
related to PAH in the long-term extension studies may be related to disease progress. 
Although the incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) appears comparable in both groups, 
there are a number of serious events that appear only in the riociguat treatment arm: 
haemoptysis (n=5) and acute renal failure (n=3). The rest of the reported serious events appear 
to be in line with the vasodilatory profile of riociguat. The overall higher rate of serious events in 
the long term extension studies is normalised once it is corrected to the duration. This could also 
signify deterioration in the disease process rather than reflecting the AE profile of riociguat. 
In the controlled studies, the rate of death was higher in the placebo group (3.3%) compared to 
the riociguat groups (1%). In the long-term extension studies, the rate of death was 4.1%, 
which is comparable to that reported in controlled studies with other PAH agents. The causes of 
death in both the placebo and riociguat were generally in line with would be expected in this 
population, e.g. cardiac failure, PAH. However, the deaths due to haemoptysis, pulmonary 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 84/118 
 
  
  
haemorrhages and acute renal impairment deserve accurate follow-up and are adequately 
reflected in the RMP.  
Hypertension was identified as an adverse event linked to the mode of action and was also used 
to guide the individual dose titration. For renal function subgroups, the incidence of hypotension 
(AE or SBP<90 mmHg) in the pooled riociguat group was higher in subjects with moderate renal 
impairment (baseline eGFR (≥ 30 to <50 mL/min) than overall, and the difference in incidence 
between the treatment groups was larger in this subgroup. A smaller difference between 
treatment groups was observed in subjects with mild renal impairment. These subgroups appear 
to be more vulnerable to the hypotensive effect of riociguat than other and such risk is 
highlighted in SmPC section 4.4. In addition, as the clinical studies excluded patients with SBP 
below 95 mm Hg and due to the risk of hypotension, this is currently a contraindication in the 
SmPC. This is also in line with the SmPC of sildenafil and tadalafil. 
Some other reported AEs are of concern considering the reported imbalance with the placebo 
group, e.g. haemoptysis, pulmonary haemorrhages and renal impairment. Apart from the 
pathology of the pulmonary vessels, the co- administration of anticoagulants or PAH medications 
can also increase this bleeding risk. It can be agreed that a direct PK/PD interaction is not the 
main mechanism: there is no evidence for an influence of riociguat on platelet function in 
humans (aspirin interaction study 14204), nor evidence for an interaction with warfarin (warfarin 
interaction study 11918). One hypothesis proposed by the Applicant is that this might be related 
to riociguat’s strong vasodilatory effect on bronchial arteries, influencing vasocontractility in case 
of severe lung bleeding, which the CHMP considered plausible.  
During the procedure the Applicant provided additional discussion on this subject. Treatment-
emergent respiratory tract bleeding events (haemoptysis and pulmonary haemorrhage) occurred 
in a total of 12 subjects in the riociguat treatment arms in PATENT-1 and CHEST-1 (10/490 
[2.0%]) vs. 2/214 [0.9%] from the placebo groups. In the LTE studies PATENT-2 and CHEST-2 
the frequency was 33/633 [5.2%]. Serious events were recorded in 5 subjects during PATENT-1 
and CHEST-1 (all in the riociguat treatment groups) and 14 subjects during the LTE phase. In 
total, there were 4 fatal outcomes recorded with riociguat (one in the DB phase, and 3 in LTE). 
The rate of respiratory tract bleeding events per 100 person years did not increase during long-
term treatment (9 events per 100 person years in CHEST-1/PATENT-1 and 5 events per 100 
person years in LTE. 
The causality of these respiratory bleedings is difficult to assess. Respiratory bleedings, although 
rare, are a known complication of the underlying disease of PH. In accordance with clinical 
guidelines a high percentage of patients were anti-coagulated (more than 90% of the patients in 
the CHEST-1 trial, and more than 50% of the patients in the PATENT-1 trial). In addition, some 
of the patients in PATENT-1 were on prostacyclins, where haemoptysis is reported as a very 
common AEs (Ventavis (iloprost) SmPC). CTEPH patients seem even more susceptible than the 
general PAH population, explained in part by higher use of anti-coagulants, and also by the 
pathology of the lesions. 
The applicant investigated several risk factors that could have contributed to this higher risk of 
respiratory bleeding reported with riociguat. These included demographic, medical history, 
baseline and disease characteristics and co-medications; none appeared to be of consistent risk. 
For example, in the DB studies and the LTE 10/12 and 28/33 respiratory tract bleeding events 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 85/118 
 
  
  
occurred in subjects without a history of respiratory bleeding. However all the cases reported in 
patients with serious events had a previous history of respiratory bleeding. A tendency was 
observed for respiratory tract bleeding events to occur rather in younger patients, particularly in 
patients with higher PAPmean and PVR. However, the data did not indicate that PAPmean and PVR 
could be used to predict the individual risk. In addition, there was a tendency for higher rates 
occurring in Asian patients. A link to respiratory tract infections cannot be ruled out; concomitant 
respiratory tract infections were recorded in 5/10 subjects in the riociguat group vs. 0/2 subjects 
in the placebo group. Co-administration of prostacyclins may be another associated risk factor, 
but no temporal association between administration of clopidogrel, ERAs and vasodilators was 
seen. 16% of subjects who had received any antithrombotic agent had a haemorrhagic event in 
both treatment groups (riociguat and placebo) in CHEST-1 and PATENT-1. The administration of 
VKAs or the quality of the INR did not result in an increased rate of any bleeding event in 
riociguat treated subjects: 18% of subjects who had received VKAs had a haemorrhagic event in 
both treatment groups (riociguat and placebo) in the DB studies.  
The Applicant acknowledges that the risk of serious and fatal respiratory tract bleeding may be 
further increased under treatment with riociguat, especially in the presence of risk factors, such 
as recent episodes of serious haemoptysis including those managed by bronchial arterial 
embolisation. The SmPC states that riociguat should be avoided in patients with a history of 
serious haemoptysis or who have previously undergone bronchial arterial embolization. In case 
of respiratory tract bleeding, the prescriber should regularly assess the benefit-risk of treatment 
continuation. 
Ultimately, this increased risk of (potentially fatal) respiratory tract bleeding must be weighed 
against the benefits of increased exercise tolerance as shown in the trials. Serious 
haemoptysis/pulmonary haemorrhage is adequately listed as important identified risks in the 
RMP and the risk is adequately reflected in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Anaemia was reported with a higher rate in the riociguat group compared to placebo. These 
increased rates of anaemia and the associated laboratory changes were not accompanied by 
differences between the treatment groups in therapy directed to counteract anaemia or in 
obvious differences of bleeding events as an explanation of the observation. Anaemia, probably 
dilutional, is also reported with bosentan and sildenafil.  
The applicant further discussed the improvement of the pulmonary hypertension with consequent 
erythropoietin decrease and neocytolysis as a possible explanation for the occurrence of anemia 
in the clinical studies; however, the observed reticulocytosis in these studies does not fit into this 
scheme. On the other hand the reticulocytosis is consistent with the conclusion that bone-
marrow toxicity is not the cause of the anemia. Also the submitted data analysis does not point 
at bone-marrow toxicity. It is realized that anemia was a common (>5%) baseline medical 
history finding in the study population (CHEST and PATENT) with 11.5% in the riociguat group 
vs. 7.5% in the placebo group. It could be shown that Hb decrease occurred in patients with high 
baseline hemoglobin (14-16g/dl) and not in patients with low baseline values (< 12g/dl). In 
addition, no correlation between anemia and bleeding events could be established. The 
Applicant´s opinion is endorsed that haemodilution caused by an increase in intravascular 
volume due to vasodilating effect of riociguat is likely the cause of the observed anemia. The 
submitted data does not indicate that the anemia represents a clinically relevant risk for the 
CHMP assessment report

Page 86/118 
 
  
  
outcome of the patients treated chronically with riociguat. Anaemia is listed as a common 
treatment emergent adverse event in section 4.8 of the SmPC.   
GI disorders were reported in a higher frequency in the riociguat pool compared to the placebo 
pool in POOL-1 DB. GI related AEs are also reported in preclinical studies. Smooth muscle 
relaxation in an otherwise unaffected GI tract explains rather the typical adverse events such as 
reflux disease, diarrhea or vomiting, which especially in combination with gastritis/enteritis could 
lead to GI bleedings. Serious adverse events of gastritis and bleeding were low in number; 
however, for the future use of riociguat in the daily practice, this issue is clinically important as 
many patients with PH receive concomitant anticoagulation. These adverse events are reflected 
in section 4.8 of the SmPC.   
Atrial Fibrillation was reported in a higher rate in the riociguat pooled arm vs. none placebo in 
POOL-1 DB, and more so in POOL-3. In a further analysis of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter 
(AF/AFL) in the main and LTE studies the rate of AF/AFL reported as TEAEs was slightly higher in 
the riociguat group (1.2%) compared to the placebo group (0.5%); whereas the reported SAE 
were comparable (0.4% and 0.5% respectively). The applicant explained that in 2 of 6 reported 
TEAE with riociguat the arrhythmia was recorded before the administration of riociguat. This 
balances the incidence between the 2 treatment arms. In addition, 3 of these 6 patients had a 
medical history of arrhythmia. In the LTE, the incidence of AF/AFL reported as TEAEs was 2.5%, 
with 2.3% reported as serious. The incidence of treatment-emergent atrial fibrillation or atrial 
flutter events was 2.8 per 100 patient-years. It can be agreed that the reported incidence rate in 
the riociguat-treated group is consistent with published data in patients with PH, (e.g. 5.6% in a 
cohort of 231 patients, Tongers et al., Am Heart J 2007;153:127-32). Atrial fibrillation is 
therefore not regarded as an adverse drug reaction related to administration of riociguat, and as 
such is not listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC. Treatment of patients with pre-existing atrial 
fibrillation is however considered as an important potential risk which is captured in the RMP. 
There are conflicting data regarding the possible effects of riociguat on renal function. On one 
hand, analyses of respective laboratory parameters did not indicate a trend for renal function to 
worsen, but rather a small improvement compared to placebo was seen during the double-blind 
treatment phase. On the other hand, there was an imbalance for AE relating to serious renal 
impairment. The Applicant attributes this to the associated co-morbidities at the time of the 
event explaining the events rather than a drug-effect. One out of these subjects with a fatal 
outcome had received dialysis, whereas most other subjects had an outcome of 
recovered/resolved.  
In an additional case-by-case analysis, the Applicant could not identify a specific signal for a 
potential negative impact of riociguat on renal function after analysis of all AEs and laboratory 
parameters. Creatinine, creatinine clearance and urea are rather stable over the course of 3 to 4 
months of treatment in riociguat and placebo-treated patients, and even show a trend to a slight 
improvement of renal function in the riociguat group when compared with placebo.  
Overall, in patients in the CHEST and PATENT studies, events of renal impairment were very 
often associated with inter-current medical conditions. In all cases, contributing factors were 
present without uncovering a particular risk pattern. 
The Applicant’s conclusion, pointing out that other factors contribute to the cases of renal 
insufficiency that were seen, was agreed by the CHMP. However, the numerical imbalance 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 87/118 
 
  
  
between the active and the placebo groups shows that ‘riociguat use’ may well be one of the 
factors contributing to renal failure. The mechanism for this may be hypotension in some or all 
cases; however this hypotension may have other contributing factors. Patients with renal disease 
are especially prone to haemodynamic instability. There is currently a warning regarding the 
associated hypotension in patients with renal impairment in section 4.4 of the SmPC. In addition, 
renal failure is adequately address in the RMP and captured as an important potential risk.  
In the repeat-dose toxicity studies, riociguat-related effects on the skeletal system consistent 
with stimulation of osteoblasts were restricted to juvenile and adolescent rats and mice (see 
“Non-clinical Toxicology” section of this report). The implications of the adverse effects on bone 
encountered in growing rats on paediatric patients in whom the epiphysis is not yet closed are 
not clear. Until more is known, the use of riociguat in children and in growing adolescents should 
be avoided (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.3 of the SmPC). 
The data from the clinical programme is not fully conclusive with regards to bone disorders. 
Therefore, in light of the additional non-clinical data the risk is included in the RMP as an 
important potential risk. 
No thorough QT study was performed. Pre-clinical data show possible QT prolongation in dogs, 
but this is considered a consequence of an inadequate correction rather than an intrinsic QT 
prolonging effect of riociguat. QT prolongation is not considered an adverse drug reaction related 
to administration of riociguat, and as such is not listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
Patients with mild or moderate renal impairment were adequately represented in the pivotal 
studies. Although the dose is individually titrated, there is still a higher incidence of hypotension 
reported in these patients. This is currently reflected as a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC. 
Subjects with a creatinine clearance <30 mL/min at baseline were excluded. Patients with severe 
renal impairment are generally more at risk for haemodynamic AEs, and the use of riociguat 
should not be recommended in these patients (see section 4.4 of the SmPC). 
There is no clinical experience in the pivotal studies in patients with different degrees of hepatic 
impairment in general. It is agreed with the Applicant that dose titration can be sufficient 
guidance for the balance of efficacy and safety in patients with mild hepatic impairment.  
There are no data in patients with severe hepatic impairment (classified as Child Pugh C), and 
considering available PK data in patients with moderate hepatic impairment, these patients are 
contraindicated. Likewise, use of riociguat in other patients with significant liver disease (e.g. 
cirrhosis, acute clinical or chronic active hepatitis, ALT > 3 x ULN, bilirubin > 2 x ULN) should not 
be recommended, due to lack of clinical experience. 
The frequency of SAEs, cardiac disorders (palpitation/tachycardia), vascular disorders (mostly 
hypotension), dizziness, peripheral edema and vomiting tended to increase with increasing age. 
Increased rate of hypotension did not lead to increased rate of syncope. The applicant has 
included in section 4.2 of the SmPC information regarding the use of riociguat in elderly 
population, stating that “In elderly patients (65 years or older) there is a higher risk of 
hypotension and therefore particular care should be exercised during individual dose titration 
(sees section 5.2)”. In the section 5.2 of the SmPC it is stated that the AUC values are ca. 40% 
higher in elderly patients due to reduced clearance. This information is considered adequate by 
the CHMP. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 88/118 
 
  
  
The reported higher rates of some AEs like headache and nausea in patients co-administered 
riociguat on top of ERA is expected. Hypotension among ERA-pre-treated patients occurred at a 
similar rate in the riociguat and placebo groups, but among therapy-naive patients, hypotension 
was reported in the riociguat group only. According to the applicant, this can be explained by a 
potential selection bias: ERA-pre-treated patients had tolerated their vasodilator pre-treatment 
for at least 90 days, whereas therapy-naive patients experienced the vasodilator effect for the 
first time. The CHMP considered this explanation plausible.  
The interaction with sildenafil was investigated in two studies. Both studies showed additive 
systemic hypotensive action. In study 15096, the combination resulted in a higher rate of 
discontinuation, more AEs related to hypotension and one case of death related to hypotension 
cannot be ruled out. The interaction is listed as a contraindication (see section 4.3 of the SmPC). 
The interaction with PDE5 inhibitors is discussed in the Pharmacodynamics section. 
Peripheral oedema among both ERA-pre-treated and therapy-naive patients occurred more 
frequently in the riociguat compared to the placebo group. This finding was explained by the 
applicant as an additive vasodilatory effect of the combination of 2 compounds with vasodilatory 
effects, ERAs and riociguat. The CHMP considered this explanation acceptable. Peripheral oedema 
is included as an ADR in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included 
in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Riociguat belongs to a new pharmacological class, soluble guanylate cyclase stimulators; so there 
is no previous safety experience, but it can be predicted from other vasodilatation which increase 
cGMP. The safety database is limited, but this can be expected in an orphan indication. Relevant 
long term data are available which is reassuring. Generally, the AE associated with riociguat use 
reflect its mechanism of action as a vasodilator, e.g. headaches, hypotension, GI AEs. However, 
some reported AEs are of concern considering the reported imbalance with the placebo group, 
e.g. haemoptysis, pulmonary haemorrhages and renal impairment. Implemented SmPC and RMP 
changes are considered adequate to reflect and manage these risks. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) should be submitted in line with the standard PSUR cycle 
(i.e. six-monthly, yearly and thereafter three-yearly). The international birth date (IBD) will be 
used as basis for calculating the Data Lock Point.

PRAC Advice 
Based  on  the  PRAC  review  of  the  Risk  Management  Plan  version  1.2,  the  PRAC  considers  by 
consensus that the risk management system for Riociguat (Adempas) in the treatment of chronic 
thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is 
acceptable. The following points should be taken into account in the next update:  
- The applicant is requested to submit the adapted riociguat-specific questionnaire, which will be 
added to the standard pregnancy monitoring forms, for review.  
- The applicant has agreed to undertake a feasibility evaluation to examine if, and how far it may 
be  possible  to  distinguish  different  clinical  classes  of  pulmonary  hypertension,  using  additional 
medical  and  procedural  information  recorded  in  the  statutory  health  insurance  data.  The 
applicant is requested to submit the results of this feasibility study upon completion. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-
authorisation PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the 
product. 
The PRAC also considered that routine PhV is sufficient to monitor the effectiveness of the risk 
minimisation measures.

Dose titration 
The recommended starting dose is 1 mg three times 
daily for 2 weeks. Tablets should be taken three times 
daily approximately 6 to 8 hours apart. 
Dose should be increased by 0.5 mg three times daily 
every two weeks to a maximum of 2.5 mg three times 
daily, if systolic blood pressure is ≥ 95 mmHg and the 
patient has no signs or symptoms of hypotension. In 
some pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) patients, 
an adequate response on the 6MWD may be reached 
at a dose of 1.5 mg three times a day. If systolic blood 
pressure falls below 95 mmHg, the dose should be 
maintained provided the patient does not show any 
signs or symptoms of hypotension. If at any time during 
the up-titration phase systolic blood pressure decreases 
below 95 mmHg and the patient shows signs or 
symptoms of hypotension the dose should be 
decreased by 0.5 mg three times daily. 
Maintenance dose 
The established individual dose should be maintained 
unless signs and symptoms of hypotension occur. The 
maximum total daily dose is 7.5 mg, i.e. 2.5mg three 
times daily. If a dose is missed, treatment should be 
continued with the next dose as planned. 
If not tolerated, dose reduction should be considered at 
any time. 
Treatment discontinuation

more, restart treatment at 1 mg three times daily for 2 
weeks, and continue treatment with the dose titration 
regimen as described above. 
Special populations 
Elderly population 
In elderly patients (65 years or older) there is a higher 
risk of hypotension and therefore particular care should 
be exercised during individual dose titration. 
Renal impairment 
Patients with moderate renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance <50–30 mL/min) showed a higher exposure 
to this medicine. There is a higher risk of hypotension in 
patients with renal impairment, therefore particular care 
should be exercised during individual dose titration. 
Posology described in section 4.2: 
Tablets can generally be taken with or without food. For 
patients prone to hypotension, as a precautionary 
measure, switches between fed and fasted Adempas 
intake are not recommended because of increased 
peak plasma levels of riociguat in the fasting compared 
to the fed state. 
Contraindications in section 4.3: 
Co-administration with nitrates or nitric oxide donors 
(such as amyl nitrite) in any form. 
Co-administration with PDE-5 inhibitors (such as 
sildenafil, tadalafil, vardenafil). 
Patients with systolic blood pressure < 95 mmHg at 
treatment initiation. 
Warnings in section 4.4: 
Riociguat has vasodilatory properties which may result 
in lowering of blood pressure. Before prescribing 
riociguat, physicians should carefully consider whether 
patients with certain underlying conditions, could be 
adversely affected by vasodilatory effects (e.g. patients 
on antihypertensive therapy or with resting hypotension, 
hypovolaemia, severe left ventricular outflow 
obstruction or autonomic dysfunction). 
Riociguat must not be used in patients with a systolic 
blood pressure below 95 mmHg. Patients older than 65

years are at increased risk of hypotension. Therefore, 
caution should be exercised when administering 
riociguat in these patients.  
Renal impairment 
Data in patients with severe renal impairment 
(creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min) are limited and 
there are no data for patients on dialysis, therefore 
riociguat is not recommended in these patients. 
Patients with mild and moderate renal impairment were 
included in the pivotal studies. There is increased 
riociguat exposure in these patients. There is a higher 
risk of hypotension in these patients; particular care 
should be exercised during individual dose titration.  
Concomitant use with other medicinal products 
The concomitant use of riociguat with strong multi-
pathway CYP and P-gp/BCRP inhibitors such as azole 
antimycotics (e.g. ketoconazole, itraconazole) or human 
immunodeficiency virus (HIV) protease inhibitors (e.g. 
ritonavir) is not recommended, due to the pronounced 
increase in riociguat exposure. 
The concomitant use of riociguat with strong CYP1A1 
inhibitors, such as the tyrosine kinase inhibitor erlotinib, 
and strong P-gp/BCRP inhibitors, such as the immuno-
suppressive agent cyclosporine A, may increase 
riociguat exposure. These medicinal products should be 
used with caution. Blood pressure should be monitored 
and dose reduction of riociguat be considered.

Warning in section 4.4: 
In pulmonary hypertension patients there is increased 
likelihood for respiratory tract bleeding, particularly 
among patients receiving anticoagulation therapy. A 
careful monitoring of patients taking anticoagulants 
according to common medical practice is 
recommended. 
The risk of serious and fatal respiratory tract bleeding 
may be further increased under treatment with 
riociguat, especially in the presence of risk factors, such 
as recent episodes of serious haemoptysis including 
those managed by bronchial arterial embolisation. 
Riociguat should be avoided in patients with a history of 
serious haemoptysis or who have previously undergone 
bronchial arterial embolisation. In case of respiratory 
tract bleeding, the prescriber should regularly assess 
the benefit–risk of treatment continuation with each 
individual patient. 
Serious bleeding occurred in 2.4% (12/490) of patients 
taking Adempas compared to 0/214 of placebo patients. 
Serious haemoptysis occurred in 1% (5/490) patients 
taking Adempas compared to 0/214 patients taking 
placebo, including one event with fatal outcome. 
Serious haemorrhagic events also included 2 patients 
with vaginal haemorrhage, 2 with catheter site 
haemorrhage, and 1 each with subdural haematoma, 
haematemesis, and intra-abdominal haemorrhage.

contraindicated during pregnancy. Monthly pregnancy 
tests are recommended. 
Women of childbearing potential 
Women of childbearing potential must use effective 
contraception during treatment with Adempas. 
Breast-feeding 
No data on the use of riociguat in breast-feeding 
women are available. Data from animals indicate that 
riociguat is secreted into milk. Due to the potential for 
serious adverse reactions in nursing infants Adempas 
should not be used during breast-feeding. A risk to the 
suckling child cannot be excluded. Breast-feeding 
should be discontinued during treatment with Adempas.  
Described in section 5.3: 
Moderate passage across the placental barrier was 
observed. Developmental toxicity studies in rats and 
rabbits have shown reproductive toxicity of riociguat. In 
rats, an increased rate of cardiac malformation was 
observed as well as a reduced gestation rate due to 
early resorption at maternal systemic exposure of about 
7-fold of human exposure (2.5 mg three times daily). In 
rabbits, starting at systemic exposure of about 3-fold of 
human exposure (2.5 mg three times daily) abortion 
and fetal toxicity were seen.

The safety and efficacy of riociguat in children and 
adolescents below 18 years have not been established. 
No clinical data are available. Non-clinical data show an 
adverse effect on growing bone. Until more is known 
about the implications of these findings the use of 
riociguat in children and in growing adolescents should 
be avoided. 
Described in section 5.2: 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the 
pharmacokinetics of riociguat in paediatric patients.  
Described in section 5.3: 
In growing juvenile and adolescent rats, effects on bone 
formation were seen. In juvenile rats, the changes 
consisted of thickening of trabecular bone and of 
hyperostosis and remodeling of metaphyseal and 
diaphyseal bone, whereas in adolescent rats an overall 
increase of bone mass was observed.  No such effects 
were observed in adult rats.

Current smokers should be advised to stop smoking 
due to a risk of a lower response. Plasma 
concentrations of riociguat in smokers are reduced 
compared to non-smokers. A dose increase to the 
maximum daily dose of 2.5 mg three times daily may be 
required in patients who are smoking or start smoking 
during treatment. 
A dose decrease may be required in patients who stop 
smoking. 
Warning in section 4.4: 
Plasma concentrations of riociguat in smokers are 
reduced compared to non-smokers. Dose adjustment 
may be necessary in patients who start or stop smoking

Described in section 4.5: 
Smoking 
In cigarette smokers riociguat exposure is reduced by 
50–60%. Therefore, patients are advised to stop 
smoking. 
Described in section 5.2: 
CYP1A1 catalyses the formation of riociguat’s main 
metabolite in liver and lungs and is known to be

Warning in section 4.4: 
The safety and efficacy of riociguat in children and 
adolescents below 18 years have not been established. 
No clinical data are available. Non-clinical data show an 
adverse effect on growing bone. Until more is known 
about the implications of these findings the use of 
riociguat in children and in growing adolescents should 
be avoided. 
Described in section 5.2: 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the 
pharmacokinetics of riociguat in paediatric patients.  
Described in section 5.3: 
In growing juvenile and adolescent rats, effects on bone 
formation were seen. In juvenile rats, the changes 
consisted of thickening of trabecular bone and of 
hyperostosis and remodeling of metaphyseal and 
diaphyseal bone, whereas in adolescent rats an overall 
increase of bone mass was observed.  No such effects 
were observed in adult rats.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk 
minimisation measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed 
indications. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes. These changes concerned a request for the 
following in vitro studies be included in the RMP (category 3 studies): 
 
The applicant agrees to test if synthesis of 3H-labeled compound is feasible. When 3H 
labelled compound is available the applicant will determine the substrate characteristics of 
M-1 for OAT1 and OAT3 at the lowest feasible concentration. For riociguat, the applicant 
will determine the substrate characteristics towards OAT1 and OAT3 at the lowest feasible 
concentration using 3H-labelled compound, under the prerequisite that the synthesis of 
3H-labeled compound is successful. In addition, the applicant agrees to determine the 
substrate characteristics towards OCT1, OCT3 (riociguat and M-1) and OCT2 (M-1) at the 
lowest feasible concentrations. Based on current results, lowest achievable test 
concentrations are in the range of 150 nM, but lower concentrations might be feasible 
when 3H labeled compound is available. The reports, which are expected to be available 
by end of 2014, are awaited. 
 
The concentrations used to test the inhibitory potential of M-1 covered the clinically 
relevant plasma concentration range. No inhibition of the OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1 and 
OATP1B3 transporters at these clinically relevant concentrations by M-1 was observed. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 108/118 
 
  
  
 
The inhibitory potential of riociguat and M-1 towards BSEP was evaluated in human 
sandwich-cultured hepatocytes with taurocholic acid (TCA) as probe substrate and 
potential effects of riociguat and M-1 on the BSEP-mediated efflux of TCA were 
determined. Riociguat is not an inhibitor of BSEP at clinically relevant concentrations (IC50 
>20 µM and 50 × Cmax,unbound = 50 × 0.05 × 0.5 µM = 1.25 µM). M-1 is also not an 
inhibitor of BSEP at clinically relevant concentration (IC50 >10 µM and Cmax,unbound = 
50 × 0.04 ×0.3 µM = 0.6 µM). In conclusion, at clinical relevant concentrations of 
riociguat and M-1 no significant inhibition of BSEP is expected. 
The applicant agrees to provide a study to determine the inhibitory potential of M 1 
towards MATE1 and MATE2 in overexpressing cells. The report will be available in May 
2014. If these studies indicate that riociguat and M-1 are inhibitors of one of these 
transporters, the Applicant is requested to change the SmPC accordingly. 
The CHMP justified these changes as follows: 
According to the EMA Drug-Drug-Interaction guideline the provision of these studies is 
imperative. The study outcome directly relates to predicting DDI in clinical practice, and even 
though the outcome of the studies will not lead to changes in the benefit/risk they are relevant 
for warnings in the SmPC. As such they should form part of the RMP as category 3 studies. The 
studies will be classified as post-authorisation RMP measures. 
In addition to the above, the CHMP also considered that the applicant should take the following 
minor points into consideration when an update of the Risk management Plan is submitted: 
- The applicant is requested to submit the adapted riociguat-specific questionnaire, which will be 
added to the standard pregnancy monitoring forms, for review.  
- The applicant has agreed to undertake a feasibility evaluation to examine if, and how far it may 
be  possible  to  distinguish  different  clinical  classes  of  pulmonary  hypertension,  using  additional 
medical  and  procedural  information  recorded  in  the  statutory  health  insurance  data.  The 
applicant is requested to submit the results of this feasibility study upon completion. 
2.9.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted 
by the applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the 
Guideline on the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
Both pivotal studies investigated the same primary endpoint of change from baseline in the 6-
minute walk distance (6MWD); at 16 weeks in CHEST-1 (CTEPH indication) and at 12 weeks in 
PATENT-1 (PAH indication).

CTEPH  
Results: In CHEST-1, riociguat resulted in a significant improvement in 6MWD from baseline to 
week 16 as compared to placebo in the ITT analysis set (45.69 m; 95% CI: 24.74 m to 66.63 m; 
p<0.0001). The results were confirmed by multiple sensitivity analyses. 
Subgroups: In CHEST-1, benefits shown for postoperative CTEPH (26.72 m; 95% CI: -9.68 to 
63.13) were less compared to the inoperable CTEPH (53.92 m; 95% CI: 28.53 to 79.31). For the 
other investigated subgroups (WHO FC, age, sex, region) the response was generally consistent, 
though results were not always statistically significant.  
Secondary endpoints: The same secondary endpoints were investigated in both studies, for 
which a hierarchical testing procedure was defined. In CHEST-1, significant improvement in 
riociguat individual dose titration (IDT) treatment group was shown for pulmonary vascular 
resistance (PVR) (LS mean difference –246.43 dyn∙s∙ cm-5), NT-proBNP (-444 pg/ml) and WHO 
FC (32.9% riociguat IDT vs. 14.9% placebo subjects with improvement of at least one FC). The 
hierarchical test procedure stopped with time to clinical worsening (TTCW) due to lack of 
significance (p>0.05). 
Long-term non-controlled data: Interim data from the on-going non-controlled long-term 
extension study CHEST-2 was submitted (cut-off April/May 2012).  
The mean change in 6MWD from baseline in study CHEST-1 to week 12 of study CHEST-2 (last 
observation by week 12, with a 28-week total in study for CHEST 1 and 2) was 63.3 m in the 
former riociguat group and 35.3 m in the former placebo group. The mean change from baseline 
in CHEST-1 for the total group (N=194) was 56.5 m at 6 months (n=149), 54.0 m at 9 months 
(n=113), 47.6 m at 12 months (n=93), and 60.7 m at 18 months (n=63).  
In patients continuing treatment in CHEST-2 efficacy in terms of 6MWD is maintained in later 
interim analyses (up to 30 months). 
PAH 
Results: In PATENT-1 riociguat resulted in a significant improvement in 6MWD from baseline to 
week 12 as compared to placebo in the ITT analysis set (35.78 m; 95% CI: 20.06 m to 51.51 m; 
p<0.0001). The results were confirmed by multiple sensitivity analyses. 
Subgroups: In PATENT-1, comparable improvements in 6MWT were observed in treatment 
naïve patients (38.36 m; 95% CI: 14.46 to 62.26) and patients receiving combination therapy 
(35.65 m; 95% CI: 15.04 to 56.26).  
Secondary endpoints: In PATENT-1, significant improvement for the riociguat IDT treatment 
group was shown for PVR (LS mean difference - 226 dyn∙s∙cm-5), NT-proBNP (- 432 pg/mL), 
WHO FC (20.9% riociguat IDT vs. 14.4% placebo subjects with improvement of at least one FC), 
time to clinical worsening (1% riociguat and 6% placebo) and Borg CR 10 score (-0.4 for 
riociguat IDT vs. +0.1 for placebo). The significant improvements in TTCW were mainly driven by 
events of hospitalisations and starting of new PH medications. The original results using a broad 
definition for TTCW were confirmed by an analysis using the CHMP definition of TTCW. 
Long-term non-controlled data: Interim data from the on-going non-controlled long-term 
extension study PATENT-2 were submitted (cut-off Mar 2013).   
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 110/118 
 
  
  
In the PAH studies, the mean change in 6MWD from baseline in PATENT-1 to week 12 (last 
observation until week 12) in PATENT-2 (24 weeks on-study for PATENT-1 &2) was 45.0 m in the 
former riociguat IDT group and 36.5 m in the former placebo group. Mean change from baseline 
in PATENT-1 for the total group (N=363) was 51.2 m at 6 months (n=289), 53.7 m at 9 months 
(n=247), 48.4 m at 12 months (n=214), and 47.3 m at 18 months (n=151).  
In patients continuing treatment in PATENT-2, efficacy in terms of 6MWD is maintained in later 
interim analyses (up to 30 months). 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects. 
Primary Endpoint: The choice of the 6MWD as the primary endpoint is in line with the relevant 
CHMP guideline. However, the same guideline underscores the importance of investigating more 
clinically relevant endpoints like TTCW as a primary endpoint. If the 6MWT is investigated, an 
actively-controlled study design should have been used, also in line with the relevant guideline. 
Subgroups:  In CTEPH, the clinical relevance of the effect in the 6-MWD is less clear in WHO II 
as compared to WHO III patients. The borderline improvement by 25 m is not supported by 
results on quality of life, WHO status or clinical worsening events.  
In PATENT-1, patients with a better WHO FC (II) benefit much less [9.9 m (95% CI: -11.3 to 
31.0)] than patients with worse WHO FC (III) (58.0 m (95% CI: -34.8 to 81.2). 
Secondary Endpoints: Only results of TTCW in PATENT-1 were significant. Although it is 
acknowledged that these are different disease populations, results were expected to be 
comparable. In addition, the results would have been expected to be positive in the longer study, 
i.e., CHEST-1 of 16 weeks, rather than the 12-weeks PATENT-1 study. This discrepancy casts 
some doubts on the robustness of the results. 
Posology: In both studies, a slow titration procedure over 8 weeks was employed to ensure a 
better tolerability and was justified by the PK/PD relationship. This is supported. However, the 
approach may impose practical disadvantages due to the extra clinic visits it may imply. 
In the pivotal studies, most of the patients could be up-titrated to 2.5 mg tid, which is reassuring 
with regards to tolerability. However, in the exploratory arm in PATENT-1, where patients (n=63) 
were administered a capped titration (CT) (1 to 1.5 mg), efficacy results appear comparable to 
the riociguat arm titrated to 2.5 mg (mean change from baseline= 31.1±79.3 m vs. 29.6±65.8 
m respectively). Significant differences are already observed in riociguat CT versus placebo for 
6MWD (p<0.0001), PVR (p<0.0001), NT proBNP (p<0.0001), but not observed for WHO 
functional class (p=0.0674), time to clinical worsening (p=0.3939) or Borg CR 10 (p=0.1068). 
The latter 2 endpoints are significantly better using the IDT regimen, implying that the full 
therapeutic effect is probably only achieved by that higher dose. Efficacy in the different 
subgroups is more consistently observed with the IDT regime, specifically, patients with PAH 
associated with CTD, patients co-administered ERA and smokers probably benefit more from the 
IDT regimen. Nevertheless, the need to uptitrate all patients to the maximum dose is questioned.

Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Riociguat belongs to a new therapeutic group, sGC stimulators. As such its safety profile is 
limited to data from the current application, but generally this can be predicted to be in line with 
other agents which increase cGMP. However, the interaction with other therapies used in PAH, 
and the disease characteristics may add complexity to the safety profile. 
Although quite usual in orphan products, the extent of the safety database is limited and only the 
common adverse events (AEs) are well characterised. 
Bleeding events: The incidence rate of all bleeding events was comparable in the treatment 
groups, e.g. 15.7% (77/490) in all riociguat treated subjects vs. 14.5% (33/214) in placebo 
subjects in POOL-1. Most of the subjects in both groups had an outcome of recovered or 
resolved. However, there is a slight imbalance in the more serious events which were reported in 
the riociguat group only: SAEs (12/490 [2.4%] riociguat vs. none placebo, including two cases of 
GI bleeding), AE related deaths (2/490 [0.4%] riociguat vs. none placebo) and discontinuations 
due to AE (2/490 [0.4%] riociguat vs. none placebo). The two death cases comprise one subject 
with haemoptysis and one subject with catheter site haemorrhage. The investigators assessed 
both fatal events as not related to the study medication.  
The risk of bleedings is aggravated by the concomitant use of anticoagulants, which is the 
standard of care in CTEPH and recommended in PAH.  
Haemoptysis was reported with a higher incidence with riociguat (10/490 [2.0%]) vs. the 
placebo rate (2/214 [0.9%]), and was assessed as a SAE in riociguat treated subjects only 
(5/490 [1.0%] vs. none placebo). One subject had a fatal outcome. 
During long term extension (LTE) phase an additional 21/557 events were reported, 7 of them 
assessed as SAEs, 18 of them with an outcome of recovered or resolved and 3 not recovered or 
resolved. However, the rate of haemoptysis decreased during the LTE phase (9 events per 100 
person years in all riociguat vs. 6 in placebo and 5 for all riociguat during LTE).  
In POOL-3 (phase II and phase III studies), haemoptysis was also reported at a higher rate in 
the riociguat (13/754; 1.7%) vs. (2/289; 0.7%) placebo and as SAEs (riociguat: 5/754; 0.7%) 
vs. none in placebo. No additional fatal outcome occurred in POOL-3. During LTE phase an 
additional 24/642 events were reported, 9 of them assessed as SAEs, 20 of them with an 
outcome of recovered or resolved and 4 not recovered or resolved. This rate is less than the 
placebo controlled period (8 events per 100 person years in all riociguat vs. 4 in placebo and 4 
for all riociguat during LTE). 
Pulmonary haemorrhages were reported with an incidence of 3/642 [0.5%] in the long-term 
extension studies; all of them had a fatal outcome. No other events were reported in other 
studies. 
Further analysis of the reported cases did not reveal any specific risk factors that could have 
contributed to the causality (see below). 
Renal impairment: There was an imbalance for the preferred terns (PTs) renal failure, renal 
failure acute and chronic as well as renal impairment, which was small in POOL-1 (3/490 [0.6%] 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 112/118 
 
  
  
all riociguat for each renal failure and renal failure acute; 2/490 [0.4%] all riociguat for renal 
failure chronic and none in placebo subjects for any of these PTs; no AE renal impairment in all 
riociguat vs.1/214 [0.5%] placebo). This difference was also present in POOL-3: (5/754 [0.7%] 
all riociguat for each renal failure acute, renal failure chronic, and renal impairment plus 6/574 
[0.8%] for renal failure vs. none of each for placebo. A case-by-case analysis showed that renal 
impairment in these patients occurred in complex situations with many contributing factors, but 
riociguat use was associated with more of these situations than placebo, possibly through 
hypotension. 
Bone: Preclinical data show a variable effect depending on the species and the age of the animal 
tested. For example, chronic administration of riociguat in adolescent rats, growth plate 
alterations, epiphyseal cartilage thickening and increases in bone mass of the primary and 
secondary spongiosa were observed. However, these findings have not been further explored in 
other species. Until further data are available, the use in children and growing adolescents should 
be avoided.  
According to the Applicant results of serum calcium, phosphate, and 1.25-dihydroxyvitamin D 
and the biomarkers type I collagen C-telopeptides (CTX) and osteopontin were evaluated in the 
study program and did not show a clinically meaningful change during treatment and no 
difference was observed between the riociguat and placebo groups. However, data from the PD 
study 13790 do not exclude an effect of riociguat on bone metabolism. Long-term data are also 
missing currently. 
Anaemia was reported with a higher rate in the all riociguat group (7.8% [38/490]) compared 
to placebo (1.9% [4/214]) which is reflected in the observed decrease of haemoglobin 
(approximately 0.5 mg/dL) and of haematocrit (approximately 2%) during double blind 
treatment in the all riociguat group compared to a stable placebo values. This decrease tended to 
normalise during the LTE phase (23 events per 100 person years in all riociguat vs. 9 in placebo 
and 7 for all riociguat during LTE). Haemodilution may explain this finding, at least partially. 
Atrial fibrillation: In the controlled studies, there was an imbalance for AF, (5/490 [1.0%] all 
riociguat vs. none placebo). This was also observed in POOL-3 resulting in a total of 13/754 
(1.7%) events of atrial fibrillation vs. none reported from placebo subjects respectively. An 
analysis of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter (AF/AFL) in the main and LTE studies showed that the 
rate of AF/AFL reported as TEAEs was slightly higher in the riociguat group (1.2%) compared to 
the placebo group (0.5%); whereas the reported SAE were comparable (0.4% and 0.5% 
respectively). The applicant explains that in 2 of 6 reported TEAE with riociguat the arrhythmia 
was recorded before the administration of riociguat. This balances the incidence between the 2 
treatment arms. In addition, 3 of these 6 patients had a medical history of arrhythmia. In the 
LTE phase, the incidence of AF/AFL reported as TEAEs was 2.5%, with 2.3% reported as serious. 
The incidence of treatment-emergent atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter events was 2.8 per 
100 patient-years, in line with registry data for PAH. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
CTEPH: CHEST-1 is the first randomised controlled study to show significant results in terms of 
improvement in exercise capacity and pulmonary haemodynamics in adult patients with CTEPH. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 113/118 
 
  
  
Previous studies with bosentan or sildenafil failed to show significant results. Benefits in terms of 
the 6MWT are clinically relevant compared to results observed in PAH studies. Secondary 
endpoints further support efficacy demonstrated by significant improvements in pulmonary 
haemodynamics, NT-proBNP and WHO FC. However, improvement in time to clinical worsening 
was not shown, as would have been expected with the short study duration. 
PAH: The study design of PATENT-1 follows that used in most of the previous PAH drug 
applications. However, several recent metanalyses illustrate the limitations of investigating the 
6MWT. It was communicated to the Applicant during the scientific advice given in 2009 that 
clinical outcome/endpoints were preferred to the 6MWT. The advice given was that if the 6MWT 
was chosen as the primary outcome, it should rather be studied in a comparative setting with 
one of the established therapies and not in placebo-controlled design, as also indicated in the 
CHMP guideline. This would have clarified the position of riociguat in the treatment 
armamentarium, at least when given as monotherapy. Using historical comparisons, the 
improvement in exercise capacity observed in treatment-naïve subjects is of the same magnitude 
as that observed in monotherapy clinical studies with registered PAH specific drugs (SUPER 
[sildenafil] 45 m to 50 m; BREATHE-1 [bosentan] 44m; ARIES-1 and ARIES-2 [ambrisentan] 
31m to 59m; SERAPHIN [macitentan 6MWD after 6 months]: 17m to 22m). Such data regarding 
efficacy are reassuring. 
For the combination therapies in PAH patients, there are very limited controlled data, although 
different combinations are described by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guideline and 
are practiced clinically. As such, the presented data for combination therapy appears additive and 
reassuring. In PATENT-1, there is adequate representation of patients administered riociguat on 
top of ERAs and relevant efficacy has been shown. There was limited representation of patients 
administered prostanoids (n=31), and of whom one third were on an un-authorised prostanoid 
(beraprost). The relevance of the results are accordingly doubtful.  
In both CTEPH and PAH, there is limited benefit demonstrated for patients in WHO FC II in terms 
of improvement of exercise capacity. In order to address this issue, the applicant was requested 
to further analyse the data regarding benefits in treatment naïve vs. patients on combination 
therapy (PATENT-1), and inoperable vs. post-operative CTEPH (CHEST-1). Also long term data of 
these patients were considered. Analysis did not reveal consistent results, with wide confidence 
intervals, which could be expected from the limited number of patients, the uneven distribution 
at baseline (which could be a chance finding) and the post hoc nature of the analysis. Also some 
subgroups showed unexplained placebo responses.  
Safety data are based on the pivotal controlled studies as well as their long-term extensions, 
providing a mean exposure for around 550 patients for a year. Though limited, it can be 
acceptable for an orphan indication. The common AEs are mainly related to the mechanism of 
action of vasodilatation and reflected as neurological and gastrointestinal AEs. Most of these AEs 
are observed with a lower frequency in the long-term extensions, which is reassuring.  
Haemoptysis and acute renal failure were SAEs only reported in the riociguat group, which is of 
concern, especially for haemoptysis. The Applicant informed the CHMP about the possible higher 
incidence of haemoptysis and pulmonary haemorrhage through a safety communication in 
November 2012. Further analysis of the reported cases of haemoptysis did not reveal any 
specific risk factors that could have contributed to the causality. However, all the cases reported 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/144673/2014 
Page 114/118 
 
  
  
in patients with serious events had a previous history of respiratory bleeding. A tendency was 
observed for respiratory tract bleeding events to occur more often in younger patients, 
particularly in patients with higher PAPmean and PVR. However, the data did not indicate that 
PAPmean and PVR could be used to predict the individual risk. In addition, there was a tendency 
for higher rates occurring in Asian patients. A link to respiratory tract infections cannot be ruled 
out. The co-administration of vitamin K antagonists or the quality of the INR did not result in an 
increased rate of any bleeding event in riociguat treated subjects: 18% of subjects who had 
received VKAs had a haemorrhagic event in both treatment groups (riociguat and placebo) in the 
double blind studies. 
In general, these SAEs did not cause an unfavourable outcome in time to clinical worsening. 
The observed anaemia in association with riociguat use is also noted with endothelin receptor 
antagonists. The mechanism of this adverse event can be attributed to vasodilatation.  
Benefit-risk balance 
For both the CTEPH indication and the PAH indication, the overall benefit/risk is considered to be 
positive. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
In this application, riociguat administered in a dose range of 1-2.5 mg t.i.d., is shown to have 
beneficial effects in two different forms of pulmonary hypertension: CTEPH and PAH. The dose is 
up-titrated every 2 weeks during 8 weeks guided by systemic blood responses. Though the 
titration scheme was complicated it was successfully applied in the phase II and phase III clinical 
studies ensuring that patients reached their optimal and well-tolerated, individualized dose of 
riociguat. It was also is sufficiently justified by inter-individual differences in PK/PD and 
susceptibility. Importantly, dose titration process did not lead to a delay in attaining efficacy 
(usually shown by week 4 in both studies).  To avoid medication errors, due to the five available 
strengths, adequate preventive measures will be in place as soon as riociguat is commercially 
available. This was considered adequate by the CHMP. 
Based on the favourable data with the capped dose regimen of 1.5 mg tid in PAH, it cannot be 
excluded that this dose could be adequate for some patients; with no need for further up-
titration to the maximum dose of 2.5 mg tid. This is clarified in the SmPC.  
Benefits are investigated in short-term studies, and shown in terms of improvement of exercise 
capacity; improvement in clinical outcomes was investigated as a secondary endpoint, and 
results were positive in only one study (PATIENT-1 in PAH). However, the duration of the studies 
was too short to be conclusive. Efficacy is limited in patients with WHO FC II (both in PAH and 
CTEPH). However, clinical trial experience indicates that it is always difficult to show robust 
improvements in such patients as the margin in improvement is limited. There was also a 
substantial improvement in the placebo group limiting the difference, with wide confidence 
intervals in the results. In fact maintaining a patient to FC II is a goal of PAH therapy. It also 
does not appear plausible that riociguat would only work in only the more severely diseased 
patients and it can be assumed that at least in some patients a beneficial effect may occur. 
Considering that patients can shift between FC II and III, it does not appear practical to 
specifically exclude FC II patients from the indication; this would probably only lead to the off-
label use of the drug in this subgroup. Therefore, as reflected in the indication, riociguat is

indicated in patients with both FC II and III (both in PAH and CTEPH) with a cross reference to 
section 5.1, where the results are separately described for each functional class. This allows the 
prescriber to make an informed decision.  
These benefits are coupled to unfavourable effects related to the ensuing vasodilatation, in the 
form of headache, dizziness and hypotension or reflected on the gastrointestinal tract. There is 
an observed risk of haemoptysis and pulmonary haemorrhages, for which the underlying 
mechanism or possible riociguat causality is not yet clear. Haemoptysis is a rare complication of 
PAH, more seen in congenital forms than idiopathic PAH. In CTEPH, haemoptysis occurs more 
often and may be recurrent, as a result of dilated and hypertrophied bronchial collateral 
circulation. Survival rates of 60%, 43% and 36% at 1, 3 and 12 months respectively were 
documented in registries following an episode of haemoptysis. It can be agreed with the 
Applicant that a direct PK/PD interaction is not the main mechanism: there is no evidence for an 
influence of riociguat on platelet function in humans (aspirin interaction study 14204), nor 
evidence for an interaction with warfarin (warfarin interaction study 11918). A case-by-case 
analysis did not identify risk factors except for previous respiratory tract bleeding event. One 
hypothesis proposed by the Applicant is that this might be related to riociguat’s strong 
vasodilatory effect on bronchial arteries, influencing vasocontractility in case of severe lung 
bleeding, which is plausible. This hampers implementation of further risk minimisation measures. 
The SmPC includes data regarding the risk of other types of serious bleeding. 
As can be expected the safety experience with riociguat is quite limited, especially when 
compared with both PDE5 inhibitors and ERAs, whose safety profile is well established. Still the 
analysis of time to clinical worsening suggests that these disadvantages have only limited 
consequences, and the safety data from the long-term extension phases are reassuring. 
CTEPH is an orphan disease; the treatment is mainly surgical by pulmonary endarterectomy. 
However, some patients are considered inoperable, or have recurrent pulmonary hypertension 
post-operative. Considering the similarities between CTEPH and PAH, medicinal products 
authorised for PAH are often administered and even have a class IIb-C recommendation, as no 
randomised clinical trial (RCT) has shown a significant benefit. In one RCT (BENEFIT) bosentan 
was shown to have significant effects on pulmonary haemodynamics, but not on 6MWT. In 
another study, sildenafil resulted in a non-significant increase in 6MWT. As such, CHEST-1 is the 
only study to show both statistically and clinically relevant improvements in 6MWT, pulmonary 
haemodynamics, pro-PNB, and FC WHO.  
For the PAH indication, the application addresses two sub-indications: monotherapy and 
combined therapy. Efficacy in both sub-populations appears comparable. For monotherapy, 
although direct comparative data are lacking, the benefits in terms of improvement in exercise 
capacity appear to be in line to those already observed for the authorised ERAs and PDE5 
inhibitors. Riociguat's mechanism of action is comparable to that of PDE5 inhibitors, e.g. 
sildenafil and tadalafil in the sense that both compounds increase cGMP. The difference is that 
riociguat does not require NO for activity, but it is not clear if this is an advantage clinically. It 
would have been very informative to have a head-to-head comparison with one of the PDE5 
inhibitors to help assess the whole B/R profile of riociguat and identify its place in the treatment 
of PAH in clinical practice.

Regarding combination therapy, direct comparative data with other combinations are also 
lacking. Although different combinations are described by the ESC guideline and practiced 
clinically, these combinations may be complicated and one specific reference therapy is difficult 
to identify. As such, the current positive clinical results in PATENT-1 addressing the combination 
of riociguat with ERAs in comparison with placebo with ERAs are considered reassuring and 
sufficient to include in the indication.  
Taking into account the above considerations the CHMP concluded that based on the current level 
of data the benefit/risk balance of riociguat is positive in the proposed indications.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Adempas is not similar to Volibris, Revatio, 
Ventavis and Opsumit within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 
847/200. See appendix 1. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of Adempas in the treatment of adult patients with 
inoperable chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH), or persistent or recurrent 
CTEPH after surgical treatment, and adult patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) is 
favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the Marketing Authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this 
product within six months following authorisation. Subsequently, the marketing authorisation 
holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this product in accordance with the 
requirements set out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 
107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal 
product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the 
agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the Marketing Authorisation and any agreed 
subsequent updates of the RMP.

An updated RMP should be submitted: 
At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of 
an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
If the dates for submission of a PSUR and the update of a RMP coincide, they can be submitted 
at the same time. 
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of data on the quality properties of the active substance, the CHMP 
considers that riociguat is qualified as a new active substance.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Prophylaxis of influenza in adults 50 years of age and older. 
Fluad Tetra should be used in accordance with official recommendations. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
One 0.5 ml dose. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Fluad Tetra in children from birth to less than 18 years has not been 
established. Currently available safety and immunogenicity data in children from 6 months to less than 
6 years of age are described in sections 4.8 and 5.1 but no recommendation on posology can be made.  
Method of administration  
For intramuscular injection only. 
The preferred injection site is the deltoid muscle of the upper arm. 
The vaccine must not be injected intravenously, subcutaneously or intradermally and must not be 
mixed with other vaccines in the same syringe. 
For instructions for preparation of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substances, to any of the components of the adjuvant, to any of the 
excipients listed in section 6.1, or to possible trace residues such as ovalbumin, kanamycin and 
neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and hydrocortisone. 
A severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to previous influenza vaccination. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of an 
anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
Vaccination should be postponed in patients with febrile illness until the fever is resolved. 
As with all injectable vaccines, Fluad Tetra must be administered with caution to individuals with 
thrombocytopenia or a bleeding disorder since bleeding may occur following an intramuscular 
administration. 
Syncope (fainting) can occur following, or even before, any vaccination as a psychogenic response to 
the needle injection. This can be accompanied by several neurological signs such as transient visual 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
disturbance, paraesthesia and tonic-clonic limb movements during recovery. It is important that 
procedures are in place to avoid injury from faints. 
Antibody response in patients with endogenous or iatrogenic immunosuppression may be insufficient 
to prevent influenza. 
A protective immune response may not be elicited in all vaccine recipients. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
No clinical data on concomitant administration of Fluad Tetra with other vaccines are available. If 
Fluad Tetra is to be used at the same time as another vaccine, it should be administered at separate 
injection sites and preferably on different limbs. It should be noted that the adverse reactions may be 
intensified by any co-administration. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential 
This medicine is not indicated in women of childbearing potential (see section 4.1). It is not to be used 
in women who are, or may be, pregnant or breast-feeding.  
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Fluad Tetra in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate 
direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Fluad Tetra has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
Adults 50 years of age and older 
The safety of Fluad Tetra has been evaluated in three clinical studies in which 1027 adults 50 to less 
than 65 years of age (Study V118_23) and 4269 elderly subjects 65 years of age and older (Studies 
V118_20 and V118_18) received Fluad Tetra.  
In all studies, solicited local and systemic adverse reactions were collected for 7 days after 
vaccination. Unsolicited adverse reactions were collected for 21 days after vaccination.  
Commonly reported (≥10%) adverse reactions in adults 50 to less than 65 years of age were injection 
site pain (47.1%), fatigue (29.5%), headache (22.2%), arthralgia (13.7%) and myalgia (13.0%) 
(V118_23). 
Commonly reported (≥10%) adverse reactions across both studies in elderly subjects 65 years of age 
and older were injection site pain (16.3% and 31.9%), fatigue (10.5% and 16.0%) and headache 
(10.8% and 12.0%) (for V118_18 and V118_20, respectively).  
Most solicited reactions were reported as mild or moderate in intensity and resolved within the first 3 
days after vaccination.  
Paediatric population 
Fluad Tetra is not indicated for use in children, see section 4.2. Safety information in the paediatric 
population is presented in section 5.1.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Influenza vaccine, ATC code: J07BB02 
Mechanism of action 
Fluad Tetra provides active immunisation against four influenza virus strains (two A subtypes and two 
B types) contained in the vaccine. Fluad Tetra induces humoral antibodies against the 
haemagglutinins. These antibodies neutralise influenza viruses. Specific levels of haemagglutination 
inhibition (HI) antibody titres post-vaccination with inactivated influenza vaccine have not been 
correlated with protection from influenza virus, but the HI antibody titres have been used as a measure 
of vaccine efficacy. Antibody against one influenza virus type or subtype confers limited or no 
protection against another. Furthermore, antibody to one antigenic variant of influenza virus might not 
protect against a new antigenic variant of the same type or subtype. Fluad Tetra contains the adjuvant 
MF59C.1 (MF59), which is designed to increase and broaden the antigen-specific immune response 
and to extend the duration of the immune response. Annual revaccination is recommended because 
immunity declines during the year after vaccination and circulating strains of influenza virus change 
from year to year. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Immunogenicity 
Adult population 50 to less than 65 years of age 
Immunogenicity of Fluad Tetra in adults 50 to less than 65 years of age was evaluated in Study 
V118_23. This was a randomised, observer-blind, controlled, multi-centre clinical trial conducted in 
the US, Germany and Estonia, during the 2021-22 Northern Hemisphere season. In this study, adults 
50 to less than 65 years of age who were healthy or had comorbidities that increased their risk of 
hospitalisation for influenza-associated complications, were enrolled to receive one dose of either 
Fluad Tetra (N=1027) or a non-adjuvanted quadrivalent comparator influenza vaccine (N=1017). The 
mean age of subjects enrolled in the Fluad Tetra group was 57.8 years and females represented 62% of 
subjects.  
The immunogenicity endpoints assessed 3 weeks after vaccination were HI GMT and HI 
seroconversion rate (pre-vaccination HI titre <1:10 and post-vaccination HI titre ≥ 1:40 or at least a 4-
fold increase in HI from pre-vaccination HI titre ≥ 1:10).  As was seen in studies in older adults with 
aTIV (see below study V70_27), Fluad Tetra elicited higher immune responses compared to a non-
adjuvanted quadrivalent comparator influenza vaccine although superiority of Fluad Tetra versus non-
adjuvanted vaccine was not achieved for all four homologous strains. The HI GMT ratios 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(comparator/Fluad Tetra) ranged from 0.80 to 0.99 with the highest limit of the 95% CI of 1.07 and 
differences in HI seroconversion rates (comparator – Fluad Tetra) ranged from -4.5% to -1.8% with 
the highest limit of the 95% CI of 2.5%. 
Elderly population (65 years and older) 
The immunogenicity of Fluad Tetra was evaluated in clinical study V118_20, a multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind, comparator controlled study conducted during the 2017-2018 Northern 
Hemisphere influenza season. Elderly subjects 65 years of age and older were randomised (2:1:1) to 
receive Fluad Tetra, the licensed adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine (Fluad, aTIV-1) or an 
adjuvanted trivalent influenza vaccine containing the alternate B strain (aTIV-2). 
Eligible subjects were men or women ≥65 years of age who were healthy or had comorbidities that 
increased their risk of influenza complications. The mean age of subjects at enrolment who received 
Fluad Tetra was 72.4 years. Female subjects represented 58.2% of the study population. 
The immunogenicity endpoints assessed 3 weeks after vaccination were HI GMT and HI 
seroconversion rate (pre-vaccination HI titre <1:10 and post-vaccination HI titre ≥ 1:40 or at least a 4-
fold increase in HI from pre-vaccination HI titre ≥ 1:10). Fluad Tetra met non-inferiority for all 4 
influenza strains and superiority to the alternate B strain not included in the Fluad aTIV comparators. 
The non-inferiority data are summarised in Table 3.

Immunogenicity of aTIV 
The immunogenicity of Fluad (trivalent formulation) is relevant to Fluad Tetra because both vaccines 
are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions. 
Study V70_27 was a large Phase 3, randomised, controlled, observer-blind, multicentre study to 
evaluate the immunogenicity and the safety of Fluad in comparison to non-adjuvanted vaccine and it 
was conducted in 2010-2011. Subjects were randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive a single 0.5 ml dose 
of Fluad or a single dose of a non-adjuvanted influenza vaccine. All subjects were followed for 
approximately one year post-vaccination. 
A total of 7082 subjects were randomised and vaccinated, including 3541 subjects in each of the 
pooled Fluad and non-adjuvanted vaccine groups. A total of 2573 subjects (1300 in Fluad and 1273 in 
non-adjuvanted vaccine group) were regarded as “high risk” subjects (underlying chronic diseases 
including congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, asthma, hepatic disease, 
renal insufficiency and/or neurological/neuromuscular or metabolic disorders including diabetes 
mellitus). 
The primary objective of a superiority of Fluad versus non-adjuvanted vaccine was not achieved for 
all homologous strains. GMT ratios ranged from 1.15 to 1.61 with the lowest limit of the 95% CI of 
1.08 and differences in seroconversion rates ranged from 3.2% – 13.9% with the lowest limit of the 
95% CI of 1.1%.  
Fluad elicited higher antibody titres for A/H3N2 that persisted up to 12 months post-vaccination. The 
results were similar for high-risk subjects with predefined comorbidities.  
Effectiveness 
No effectiveness studies have been performed with Fluad Tetra. The observational effectiveness 
studies performed with Fluad (trivalent formulation) are relevant to Fluad Tetra because both vaccines 
are manufactured using the same process and have overlapping compositions.  
Paediatric Population (6 months to less than 6 years) 
Fluad Tetra is not indicated for use in children, see section 4.2.  
Efficacy, immunogenicity and safety of Fluad Tetra was evaluated in clinical study V118_05, a 
multicentre, randomised, observer-blinded, controlled study conducted in the 2013-14 (season 1) and 
2014-15 (season 2) Northern Hemisphere seasons in children of 6 months to less than 6 years. 
Children less than 3 years of age received 0.25 ml vaccine, older children received 0.5 ml vaccine. 
Children naïve to prior influenza vaccination received two doses of vaccine, at least 4 weeks apart. 
10,644 children were enrolled and randomised to receive Fluad Tetra or the non-adjuvanted 
comparator vaccine in a 1:1 ratio: 5,352 children were enrolled in the Fluad Tetra group and 5,292 
children in the non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine group. 
Immunogenicity  
A subset of children enrolled in this study was evaluated for their immunological response to Fluad 
Tetra and the non-adjuvanted comparator. Immunogenicity assessments were performed prior to 
(each) vaccination and 3 weeks after the last vaccination. A total of 2886 children were included in the 
subset for immunogenicity evaluation (Fluad Tetra: N=1481; non-adjuvanted comparator vaccine: 
N=1405).  
Fluad Tetra demonstrated a higher immune response compared to the non-adjuvanted comparator 
vaccine. In addition, in children naïve to influenza vaccination antibody titres 4 weeks after the first 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
vaccination as well as 3 weeks after the second vaccination were greater in subjects who received 
Fluad Tetra.  
At 12 months post-vaccination, persistence of the immune response was higher in the Fluad Tetra 
group compared to the non-adjuvanted comparator group.  
Efficacy  
Vaccine efficacy was assessed for the prevention of first-occurrence laboratory confirmed influenza 
associated with symptomatic influenza-like illness (ILI). Influenza-like illness was defined as fever of 
37.8°C or above along with any of the following: cough, sore throat, nasal congestion, or runny nose 
occurring at ≥ 21 days and ≤ 180 days after the last vaccination or until the end of the influenza 
season, whichever was longer. Subjects with ILI had nasopharyngeal swabs collected and tested for 
influenza A (A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and B (both lineages) by Reverse Transcription-Polymerase 
Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). A total of 508 cases of first-occurrence RT-PCR confirmed influenza 
occurred during the study; 10 during season one and 498 during season two. The majority of influenza 
cases were A/H3N2. Based on antigenic typing, more than ninety percent of A/H3N2 strains from 
season two were determined to be antigenically distinct from egg-propagated A/Texas/50/2012, the 
H3N2 vaccine strain. 
Vaccine efficacy compared to the non-adjuvanted influenza comparator vaccine was assessed. The 
relative vaccine (rVE) efficacy between Fluad Tetra and the comparator vaccine group in subjects ≥6 
to <72 months of age was -0.67 [95% CI: -19.81; 15.41]), which did not meet the primary objective of 
the study. 
Safety 
Safety data were collected up to 12 months after receipt of the last vaccination. 
A higher incidence of local and systemic reactions was reported in subjects who received Fluad Tetra 
compared to the non-adjuvanted comparator influenza vaccine.  
The most commonly reported adverse reactions (>10%) were tenderness (43.2%), irritability (27.1%), 
sleepiness (26.3%), change in eating habits (22.5%), fever (19.1%), diarrhoea (12.3%) and vomiting 
(10.3%).  
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Fluad Tetra in one or more subsets of the paediatric population in prevention of influenza infection. 
See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Not applicable.  
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose 
toxicity, toxicity to reproduction and development, local tolerance and sensitisation.

1.  What Fluad Tetra is and what it is used for 
Fluad Tetra is a vaccine against flu (influenza).  
When a person is given the vaccine, the immune system (the body’s natural defence system) will 
produce its own protection against the influenza virus. None of the ingredients in the vaccine can 
cause flu.  
Fluad Tetra is used to prevent flu in adults 50 years of age and older. 
The vaccine targets four strains of influenza virus following the recommendations by the World 
Health Organisation for the 2023/2024 season. 
2.  What you need to know before you receive Fluad Tetra 
You should not receive Fluad Tetra 
- 
if you are allergic to  
•  the active substances or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in section 6)  
•  egg or chicken proteins (such as ovalbumin), kanamycin and neomycin sulphate, formaldehyde, 
cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) and hydrocortisone, which are trace residues from 
the manufacturing process. 
- 
If you have had a severe allergic reaction (e.g. anaphylaxis) to previous influenza vaccination. 
Warnings and precautions

such as difficulty in breathing, dizziness, a weak and rapid pulse and skin rash) following the 
administration. This reaction may occur with Fluad Tetra as with all vaccines that are injected. 
•  You should tell your doctor if you have an illness associated with fever. Your doctor may decide 
to delay your vaccination until your fever is gone. 
•  You should tell your doctor if your immune system is impaired, or if you are undergoing treatment 
which affects the immune system, e.g. with medicine against cancer (chemotherapy) or 
corticosteroid medicines (see Section “Other medicines and Fluad Tetra”). 
•  You should tell your doctor if you have a bleeding problem or bruise easily. 
•  Fainting can occur following, or even before, any needle injection, therefore tell the doctor or 
nurse if you fainted with a previous injection.

Other sources of information 
Detailed information on this medicine is available on the European Medicines Agency web site: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu.  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Appropriate medical treatment and supervision should always be readily available in case of a rare 
anaphylactic event following the administration of the vaccine. 
Gently shake before use. After shaking, the normal appearance of the vaccine is a milky white 
suspension. 
The vaccine should be visually inspected for particulate matter and discoloration prior to 
administration. In the event of any foreign particulate matter and/or variation of physical aspect being 
observed, do not administer the vaccine. 
When using a pre-filled syringe supplied without a needle, remove the tip cap from the syringe and 
then attach a suitable needle for administration. For Luer Lock syringes, remove the tip cap by 
unscrewing it in a counter-clockwise direction. Once the tip cap is removed, attach a needle to the 
syringe by screwing it on in a clockwise direction until it locks. Once the needle is locked in place, 
remove the needle protector and administer the vaccine.

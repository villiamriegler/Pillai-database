Lenalidomide Accord will be available as capsules (2.5 mg, 5 mg, 7.5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, 20 mg and 25 
mg). The active substance of Lenalidomide Accord is lenalidomide, an immunomodulating agent (ATC

cell proliferation, anti-proliferation of multiple myeloma cells and inhibition of angiogenesis. 
Lenalidomide Accord is a generic of Revlimid which has been authorised in the EU since 14 June 2007. 
Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Lenalidomide Accord and its bioequivalence to the 
reference product Revlimid. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be found here.

Lenalidomide Accord as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients 
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell 
transplantation.

adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Lenalidomide Accord in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of

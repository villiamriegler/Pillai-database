1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Celgene Europe BV submitted on 30 April 2020 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Abecma,  through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 9 November 2017. 
Abecma,  was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/17/1863 on 20 April 2017 in the 
following condition: treatment of multiple myeloma. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion on this marketing authorisation, the Committee for Orphan 
Medicinal Products (COMP) reviewed the designation of Abecma as an orphan medicinal product in the 
approved indication. More information on the COMP’s review can be found in the Orphan maintenance 
assessment report  published under the ‘Assessment history’ tab on the Agency’s website: 
ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/abecma. 
Abecma was granted eligibility to PRIME on 10 November  2017 in the following indication:  treatment 
of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma. 
Eligibility to PRIME was granted at the time in view of the following: 
Based on the claims, the justification for such claims and the description of the available data provided 
by the applicant, the CHMP is of the view that: 
•  Despite available treatments, there is still a need for new options in the intended initial 
indication for the treatment of relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma patients whose prior 
therapy included a proteasome  inhibitor, an immunomodulatory agent and an anti-CD38 
antibody. The unmet medical need is agreed. 
• 
• 
• 
In vitro studies were conducted using human tumour cell lines, primary  cells, and tumour 
biopsies to demonstrate BCMA (target) expression, bb2121 anti-BCMA CAR (effector) 
expression, specificity, activity, and potency, as well as CAR-to-target binding. In vivo studies 
used animal models of human MM using immunodeficient mice with human tumour cell line 
xenografts. Overall, data suggest potential therapeutic activity and are supportive of the proof 
of principle. 
The applicant provided data from Study CRB-401, an ongoing non-randomised, open-label, 
phase 1 study and particularly,  data from the dose escalation part of the study. The subjects 
enrolled in Study CRB-401were heavily pre-treated including 71.4% of patients who received 
prior  daratumumab in addition to PI and IMID. 
Preliminary results show a high overall response rate (ORR), across all dose cohorts of 86% 
(18/21). This includes several patients with CR, sCR, VGPR and PR that had been previously 
treated with PI, IMID and daratumumab. 
•  Although follow-up is limited in some patients, responses appear durable, with median DOR for 
15 subjects treated with >50 x 106 CAR+ T cells with at least 3 months follow-up not yet 
reached (range of follow-up: 4.3-14.9 months). 
•  Overall, the high ORR reported suggest the product has the potential to bring a major 
therapeutic advantage to relapsed/refractory MM patients that have received prior  lines of 
therapies included IMID, PI and daratumumab. 
Access to support through the PRIME scheme was therefore confirmed. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Abecma is indicated for the treatment of adult 
Assessment report

Page 8/164 
 
 
 
patients with multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior therapies, including an 
immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti CD38 antibody. 
The legal basis for this application refers to: 
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application. The applicant indicated 
that idecabtagene vicleucel was considered to be a new active substance. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information  on Paediatric  requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0387/2019 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.   
Information  relating to orphan market  exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No.  141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity  with authorised 
orphan medicinal products. 
Applicant’s requests for consideration 
Conditional  marketing  authorisation  and Accelerated assessment 
The Applicant applied for a full marketing authorisation, but during the assessment, in response to CAT 
and CHMP concerns on the comprehensiveness of the data, requested consideration of its application 
for a conditional marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned 
Regulation. 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article  14 (9) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance idecabtagene vicleucel contained in the above medicinal 
product to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent 
of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union 
Scientific recommendation  on Classification 
The developer, Bluebird bio France, submitted on 17 August 2017 an application for Scientific 
recommendation on Classification to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Abecma,  which was 
designated as an Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product in accordance with Regulation (EC) No 
1394/2007 on 13 October 2016. Abecma was classified as a gene therapy medicinal product.

PRIME  support 
Upon granting of eligibility to PRIME, Helga Haugom Olsen was appointed by the CHMP as rapporteur. 
Subsequently the Rapporteur was changed to Rune Kjeken. 
A kick-off meeting was held on 14 March 2018. The objective of the meeting was to discuss the 
development programme  and regulatory strategy for the product. The applicant was recommended to 
address the following key issues through relevant regulatory procedures:  
• 
The Rapporteur  and EMA confirmed that Vector Copy Number (VCN) was a topic of ongoing 
discussion with CAR T therapies and encouraged the Applicant to seek Scientific Advice on this 
topic. 
•  Comparability  package and justification for not including clinical data using the commercial  LVV 
and drug product manufacturing sites in the pivotal study would need justification and 
recommendation for seeking Scientific Advice on the proposed approach was given 
• 
Pivotal study: the applicant was suggested to further explore aspects of the MAA package and 
the use of external controls as follow: 
o  The Rapporteur  and EMA stated that a follow-up of 9-12 months may be more 
appropriate  to assess longer term outcome data such as PFS and durability of 
response. 
o  The Rapporteur  had concerns that the proposed population of BB2121-MM-001 had not 
exhausted all treatment options as patients were not specifically required to have 
received various marketed regimens available in the EU. The Applicant will need to 
justify this at the time of the MAA. 
o 
the Rapporteur and EMA had concerns around the Applicant’s intention to provide a 
literature review summary but not an external control containing patient level data. 
This approach not to include an external control may result in difficulties quantifying 
the magnitude of the benefit. Specifically, how the activity of bb2121 in the post-
daratumumab patient population would compare  to established MM treatment 
regimens in this setting may be challenging to demonstrate. Scientific Advice was 
recommended on this topic. 
o  The Applicant acknowledged that DPd is not a currently approved regimen in the EU 
and explained that Scientific Advice on this study was not currently considered. The 
Rapporteur  acknowledged this position and recommended that Scientific Advice be 
sought for the study, especially due to the choice of comparator  arm given the multiple 
regimens available for the treatment of multiple myeloma  in the EU. A more 
appropriate  choice of comparator  may be to allow a limited number of options 
(investigator’s choice). 
o  Due to the number of products approved, the Applicant was advised to consider an 
external control group for demonstration of significant benefit as lack of control arm 
poses a challenge with establishment of significant clinical benefit based on a single 
arm trial.  The Applicant highlighted that this presents a difficulty in a post 
daratumumab population due to the current lack of data and obtaining this through 
retrospective literature review or prospective collection in a registry is not without 
challenges and limitations. One option may be to compare the clinical outcome of the 
treatment regimen received immediately prior to bb2121 in the MM-001 trial to the 
patient’s response to bb2121. It was acknowledged that this approach had been 
acceptable for other MAAs although the EMA/Rapporteur were not able confirm 
whether this would be suitable in this specific case. Protocol Assistance on the topic of 
demonstrating Significant Benefit was advised.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem  statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The present application concerns the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma (MM) who have received at least three prior  therapies, including an immunomodulatory 
agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression 
on the last therapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology   
Multiple myeloma (MM) accounts for about 10% to 18% of hematologic malignancies (Moreau, 2017) 
and primarily  affects older individuals (Howlader, 2019). In Europe, the median age at onset of MM is 
72 years (Moreau, 2017). MM is very rare in patients younger than 40 years old (Howlader, 2019). 
Overall, the estimated prevalence of MM in the EU in 2018 ranged from 1.79 to 3.61 in 10,000 
persons. In Europe, 48,297 new cases of MM and 30,860 deaths due to MM were estimated in 2018 
(International Agency for Research on Cancer [IARC], 2019). The course of MM is characterised by a 
period of disease control after initial therapy followed by progression, typically with subsequently 
shorter periods of response and relapse with each successive therapy (Moreau, 2017). According to 
CancerMPact®, approximately  27% of patients in Western Europe who have received 3 prior lines of 
antimyeloma therapy (AMT) will receive a fourth line of systemic AMT (Kantar, 2019).

2.1.3.  Biologic  features, aetiology  and pathogenesis 
Multiple myeloma (MM) is an incurable blood cancer characterised by the clonal proliferation of 
malignant plasma cells both within the bone marrow  (BM) and at localised extramedullary sites termed 
plasmacytomas.  B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) was selected as a therapeutic target, because BCMA 
is consistently expressed on plasma cells and myeloma cells from patients with MM, where the 
expression of BCMA is thought to support tumour cell survival in the BM niche (Carpenter, 2013). 
Normal,  nonhematopoietic tissues do not express BCMA (Carpenter, 2013). In contrast, benign and 
malignant plasma cells contain high levels of BCMA messenger ribonucleic acid, and concentrations of 
soluble BCMA (sBCMA) within serum correlate with disease status (ie, disease burden), response to 
therapy, and overall survival (OS) (Sanchez, 2012). 
2.1.4.  Clinical  presentation,  diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
In MM, the malignant proliferation of the plasma cell clone causes increasing levels of monoclonal 
protein (M-protein) in the serum and urine and may result in BM failure, suppression of uninvolved 
immunoglobulin levels, and skeletal destruction. Clinical complications of progressive MM include 
recurrent infections, cytopenias, renal failure, hyperviscosity syndrome, hypercalcaemia, bone pain, 
and pathologic fractures (Munshi, 2012). 
The criteria for diagnosis of MM as defined by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG), 
requires 10% clonal BM plasma cells or biopsy proven bony or extra-medullary plasmacytoma  and 
evidence of end organ damage that can be attributed to the underlying plasma cell proliferative 
disorder, or biomarkers  of malignancy (60% clonal BM plasma cells or involved/uninvolved serum-free 
light chain ratio >100 or > 1 focal lesion on magnetic resonance imaging studies). 
The Revised International Staging System (R-ISS) is a widely accepted classification used for 
prognostic evaluation. It relies on the combination of serum levels of b2-microglobulin and albumin, 
cytogenetics by fluorescence in situ hybridisation and lactate dehydrogenase. 
Despite progress in its current treatment and management, MM remains incurable. Although 
autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT) has extended survival in newly diagnosed MM, practically all 
patients eventually relapse. Historical data report  an OS of 8 to 13 months in studies of 
relapsed/refractory MM patients who received ≥ 3 prior lines of therapy and were refractory to an 
immunomodulatory agent and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) (Kumar, 2017). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Many factors influence the choice of therapy in the relapsed/refractory MM setting, including age, 
performance status (PS), comorbidities,  the type, efficacy, and tolerability of the prior AMT, the 
number of prior  treatment lines, the available remaining treatment options, the interval since the last 
therapy and the type of relapse (clinical versus biochemical) (Moreau, 2017).  
The treatment landscape for relapsed/refractory MM has changed in recent years. Since the beginning 
of 2015, 8 relapsed/refractory MM indications (all for regimens evaluated in second or third line) have 
been approved for 6 products (including panobinostat, carfilzomib, ixazomib,  daratumumab, 
pomalidomide, and elotuzumab) through the centralised procedure. In addition, two marketing 
authorisations have recently been granted one for Blenrep and one for Nexpovio both in the 5th line 
RRMM indication. 
For relapsed/refractory MM patients with second or subsequent relapses, European Society for Medical 
Oncology (ESMO)-recommended options are a triplet regimen based on a backbone of pomalidomide 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021

and dexamethasone (Pd) (plus bortezomib,  cyclophosphamide, daratumumab, elotuzumab, or 
ixazomib),  daratumumab (single agent or in combination), or enrolment in a clinical trial. For 
relapsed/refractory MM patients who cannot be considered for initiation of treatment with a 3-drug 
regimen, a 2-drug regimen, with a third drug added once performance improves, may be an option 
(NCCN-MM, 2020). 
As most patients receive frontline therapy with a backbone of an immunomodulatory agent and/or a 
PI, the development of disease that is refractory to both of these classes represents a major 
therapeutic challenge. Furthermore, the progressive incorporation of daratumumab-based therapy, has 
led to a subset of patients being exposed to these 3 AMT classes. Relapsed/refractory MM, particularly 
in patients exposed to multiple prior  AMTs, those exposed to an anti-CD38 antibody, or those 
refractory to major classes of AMT, is life threatening and is associated with low response rates, short 
duration of response (DoR), and poor  survival. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for more 
treatment options capable of achieving deep and durable responses that afford the opportunity for 
treatment-free intervals and improved quality of life (QoL) for patients with relapsed/refractory MM 
who have received ≥ 3 prior  therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a PI, and an anti-CD38 
antibody. 
About the product 
Idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel) is a gene therapy product consisting of modified autologous T cells 
transduced with an anti-BCMA02 chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) lentiviral vector (LVV). The 
autologous T cells transduced ex vivo with the anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV express the anti-BCMA CAR on 
the T cell surface. Antigen-specific activation of ide-cel results in CAR+ T cell proliferation, cytokine 
secretion, and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells. 
Ide-cel is provided as a single dose for intravenous (IV) infusion containing a dispersion of CAR+ T 
cells in one or more  infusion bags. The proposed target dose is 420 x 106 anti-BCMA CAR+ viable T 
cells, within a range of 260 to 500 x 106 anti-BCMA CAR+ viable T cells. 
The development  programme/compliance  with CHMP guidance/scientific 
advice 
The clinical development programme  for ide-cel consists of one Phase 1 dose-finding study (CRB-401), 
three ongoing, uncontrolled Phase 2 studies (MM-001, MM-001 - Japan and MM-002), one Phase 3 
randomised controlled trial (RCT) (MM-003) and two long-term safety follow up studies (GC-LTFU-001 
and LTF-305). 
The primary  data for this marketing authorisation application come from the Phase 2 study, MM-001. 
Supportive efficacy data are provided from Study CRB-401. In the remaining ongoing studies (MM-
001-Japan, MM-002, and MM-003) a small number of subjects with limited follow-up time have been 
treated with ide-cel. These studies provide supportive data for the safety assessment only. 
Ide-cel has been the subject of one prime kick-off meeting (March 2018), four scientific advices 
concerning quality and two scientific advices concerning the clinical efficacy of the product 
development.  
The applicant did not amend the clinical development programme  based on the concerns raised over 
the single arm trial approach and the limited duration of follow up. Furthermore, advice concerning the 
use of the ITT population as the primary  efficacy population was not followed. However, results for 
both the enrolled (ITT) and infused (mITT) analyses set were generally presented in the marketing 
authorisation application (MAA).

Type of Application  and aspects on development 
Accelerated Assessment 
The CHMP and CAT agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major  public health interest. This was based on the fact that currently patients with 
relapse/refractory multiple myeloma have only limited treatment options with insufficient clinical 
outcome. An unmet medical need was substantiated by the applicant and was acknowledged. Data 
were presented to support that Ide-cell may address that unmet need. Though limited clinical data 
were submitted in support of the accelerated assessment request, the promising ORR and CR rate 
observed, and the possibility for long-term disease control suggested that Ide-cell might indeed 
represent a major therapeutic advantage over existing therapies. As such Ide-cell was considered to be 
of major interest from the point of view of public health. However,  during the assessment a GMP 
inspection and provision of a GMP certificate were considered necessary which did not allow 
maintenance of the accelerated assessment timetable.    
Conditional Marketing Authorisation 
In light of the concerns raised during assessment on the comprehensiveness of the data set, the 
applicant requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing Authorisation in 
accordance with Article 14-a of the above-mentioned Regulation, based on the following criteria: 
• 
• 
The benefit-risk balance is positive in a patient population consistent with the MM-001 study 
population. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data. In the ongoing 
randomised study (MM-003), ide-cel is compared to SOC triplet regimens in an overlapping 
patient population i.e. relapsed and refractory MM with 2-4 prior therapies and this study is 
considered to be suitable as a specific obligation to the MA. As of 06 Jan 2021, 261 subjects have 
been randomised, and patient enrolment is currently targeted to be completed by Q2 2021. Thus, 
a CMA granted in 2021 would most probably  not interfere with the completion of this phase 3 
study and data can be expected to be available within an appropriate  timeframe. The data from 
study MM003 are estimated to be received by Q2 2023. In addition, updated efficacy and safety 
data (24 months after the last subject has received ide-cel) from the ongoing Study BB2121-MM-
001 will be provided as a SOB to the CMA. These data will be provided by December 2021 
• 
Unmet medical needs will be addressed, as Abecma would provide a new treatment option with a 
new MoA for these patients. In patients who have received at least 3 prior  therapies and are 
refractory to at least one immunomodulatory drug, one proteasome  inhibitor, and one anti-CD-38 
antibody, and whose disease has progressed on the last therapy, available treatment options offer 
limited clinical benefit, and the unmet medical need can be agreed. In the setting where patients 
are not triple refractory, the greater availability and efficacy of SOC treatment options introduces 
higher uncertainty as to the true magnitude of the effect. Nevertheless, the response rates 
achieved with ide-cel in this less refractory population seem compelling. In addition ide-cel may 
provide a major contribution to patient care, acting through a different mechanism of action and 
thus providing a treatment alternative addressing the unmet need. More comprehensive and 
robust data in patients with less advanced disease (Study MM-003) will be a part of the 
obligations for the CMA. 
• 
The benefits to public health of the immediate availability outweigh the risks inherent in the fact 
that additional data are still required.  Ide-cel has a unique mechanism of action leveraging the 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021

patient’s modified T cells to kill myeloma  cells targeting a uniformly expressed plasma cell 
antigen. To date, there is no approved BCMA-targeting CAR T cell therapy available for the 
treatment of patients with relapsed and refractory MM. In addition, ide-cel as a 1-time therapy 
offers the opportunity for treatment-free intervals and improved quality of life as the need for 
frequent visits is reduced compared with standard treatments given continuously. 
The clinically meaningful efficacy observed including frequent, deep, and durable clinical responses 
together with a manageable and well-characterised safety profile, confirm the positive benefit-risk 
assessment for ide-cel, which, represents a major therapeutic advantage. This positive benefit-
risk assessment supports the fact that the immediate availability of ide-cel to MM patients in need 
of alternative AMTs outweighs the risks related to the requirement for additional confirmatory 
data. 
2.2.  Quality  aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Abecma (Idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, bb2121)) is a genetically modified autologous T cell 
immunotherapy product consisting of T cells transduced with an anti-BCMA chimeric antigen receptor 
(CAR) lentiviral vector (LVV). The autologous T cells transduced ex vivo with the anti-BCMA CAR LVV  to 
express the anti-BCMA CAR on the T cell surface. The B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) is a 
transmembrane protein selectively expressed in both normal and malignant plasma  cells and blasts. 
Binding of ide-cel to BCMA-expressing target cells results in CAR+ T cell proliferation, cytokine 
secretion, and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells.  
Ide-cel finished product (FP) is formulated as a single dose cell suspension (dispersion for infusion) for 
intravenous administration contained in ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) cryopreservation bag(s).  
The finished product is formulated and cryopreserved in a solution containing Plasma-Lyte A (sodium 
chloride, sodium gluconate, sodium acetate trihydrate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, water 
for injections) and CryoStor CS10, resulting in a final dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) concentration of 5%.  
A single dose of ide-cel contains a cell suspension of 260 to 500 x 106 CAR+ viable T cells in one or 
more infusion bags of the same size and fill. The quantitative information regarding CAR+ T cells/mL 
and volume are presented in the release for infusion certificate accompanying the final product. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Idecabtagene vicleucel (ide-cel, bb2121) is produced from leukapheresis material obtained from 
individual patients, and therefore the product is unique to each patient. The patient’s T cells are 
engineered ex vivo to express the anti-BCMA CAR on the T cell surface. 
The section on the active substance is separated into two parts; part 1 for the anti-BCMA02 CAR 
lentiviral vector (LVV) and part 2 for the transduced cells resulting in the active substance 
Idecabtagene vicleucel. 
2.2.2.1. Part 1: Anti-BCMA02 CAR lentiviral vector (LVV) 
General Information (Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV (LVV)) 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 17/164 
 
 
 
 
 
The anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV (LVV) is considered as a starting material for the manufacturing of ide-cel. 
The LVV is derived from the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and is replication 
incompetent and self-inactivating (SIN). It is manufactured using a third-generation vector design in 
which the necessary viral genes are expressed from four separate plasmids to minimise the risk of 
generating replication competent lentivirus (RCL). 
Manufacture, process controls and characterisation (Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV (LVV)) 
Manufacturing process (Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV) 
Manufacturing of the LVV starts with thawing of one vial of HEK293T producer cells, which are then 
expanded to multilayer cell cultures (MLCCs). This results in a crude vector harvest. The single crude 
harvest pool is purified and concentrated to final LVV product filled into vials, which is the definition of 
one lot of anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV. The final LVV pool is automatically filled to a target volume of 5 mL in 
10 mL  vials within a Grade A isolator environment. The vector is stored at -65°C.  
The single steps of the LVV manufacturing process are sufficiently described. Acceptable ranges/action 
limits are defined for critical process parameters  (CPPs) and in-process controls (IPCs) and listed for 
each unit operation. In addition to action limits and acceptance criteria, ongoing process verification 
(OPV) establishes and assesses internal control limits for process monitoring across multiple lots 
indicating that the manufacturing process is performing in a state of control. The OPV programme  is 
acceptable. Process parameters  are listed in the manufacturing process description. Assays used for 
IPCs and in process monitoring are sufficiently described. 
The overall control strategy including in-process controls and testing of starting materials is adequate 
to control the process resulting in an LVV of consistent quality.  
Control of materials (Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV) 
All raw materials and key consumables are listed. The materials of biological origin are accepted for 
use in the manufacture of anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV based on the Certificate of Analysis (CoA) from the 
supplier. Representative certificates of analysis for each materials of biological origin are provided.  
The generation of the starting plasmids is sufficiently described, including full listing of all genetic 
elements. The testing performed to qualify each packaging plasmid is sufficiently documented. All 
results met acceptance criteria. Certificate of analysis of all plasmids are provided. The cell banks are 
sufficiently documented. 
The origin and preparation of the cell banks have been set out in sufficient detail. Adequate 
information on the qualification of the current master cell bank (MCB) is presented, including a 
comprehensive adventitious agent testing programme  in accordance with ICH Q5A, covering relevant 
human, porcine and bovine viruses.  
Process validation (Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV) 
The LVV commercial  manufacturing process was validated. All process validation acceptance criteria, 
including critical quality attributes (CQAs), critical process parameters  (CPPs), and performance 
attributes were met for the PPQ batches. Additionally, all non-CPP proven acceptable ranges (PARs) 
were met, indicating that the LVV manufacturing process performs  in a consistent manner. Deviations 
occurring during the execution of the PPQ runs were investigated, corrective and preventative actions 
determined, and their impact to PPQ are sufficiently addressed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 18/164 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Following execution of the PPQ batches, the criticality of process parameters  and IPCs was re-
evaluated along with the corresponding acceptance criteria to define the commercial  manufacturing 
control strategy. The re-evaluation of CPPs and IPCs are justified.  
An OPV programme  has been implemented for commercial  production to provide evidence that the 
process and product quality remains in a validated state of control during routine commercial 
manufacturing by monitoring, at minimum, the CQAs, CPPs, and IPCs. The OPV plan includes the 
parameters  and attributes to be monitored, their limits,  and the frequency of reporting. The OPV 
programme  is endorsed. The normal operation range (NOR) of the manufacturing process has been 
established and will be monitored and updated as appropriate  as part of product life cycle management 
for subsequent commercial  lots. Lists of CPPs with NORs in addition to the PARs are provided. 
A buffer and media microbial  hold time qualification study was executed to establish hold times for 
commercial  manufacturing. The hold times suggestions for the applied media and buffers based on 
these studies seem reasonable. The temperature-controlled dry ice shipping systems used for shipping 
LVV were sufficiently validated.  
Additional validation consisted of the validation of the sterility of the filling process with media fill 
simulations exceeding the maximum  vial fills of standard batches, shipping validation for LVV and 
media storage time evaluation. All presented data show sufficient performance of the processes. 
The provided risk assessment in respect of extractables and leachables concluded that the LVV 
manufacturing process does not pose additional risks to the product and is considered acceptable. 
Manufacturing process development (Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV) 
An evaluation of product quality attributes for LVV was conducted following quality risk management 
principles. LVV quality attributes are categorised as CQAs and non-CQAs based on the predicted 
severity of impact to patient safety and finished product efficacy. The determination of quality 
attributes seems reasonable.  
LVV manufacturing data are analysed through testing of in-process pools from LVV batches produced 
using the commercial  process (Process IV). Average performance recovery data are presented for 
process steps indicating good performance. Likewise, impurity clearance summary levels are provided. 
Impurity concentration results indicate consistent ability of the process to meet IPC criteria.  
In general, the PARs set during the process characterisation are reasonably justified.  
Characterisation (Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV) 
The applicant conducted a comprehensive characterisation of the LVV with respect to structure and 
composition. The assays used were able to positively detect the presence of major  species for all lots, 
as well as expression of viral proteins critical to the formation of functional LVV.   
Impurities (Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV) 
A comprehensive description and characterisation data for all product and process related impurities 
has been provided.

The release and stability specifications for anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV are provided. Overall, the tests 
conducted for LVV batch release and the specifications are considered adequate.  
Analytical methods (Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV) 
Validation reports were presented for all analytical assays. The validation parameters were selected in 
accordance with ICH Q2(R1) based on the intended use of the method and were assessed to confirm 
the suitability of the method. Verification details for pharmacopeial  procedures are also included.  
The validation of the analytical methods in use for control of LVV is considered acceptable.  
Batch analysis (Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV) 
Several batches of anti-BCMA-LVV have been manufactured. Overall, the batch data provided are 
considered sufficient and support LVV-consistency.  
For LVV-batch release, an LVV-reference standard is used as internal control. This reference standard 
is qualified according to batch release tests and additional characterisation assays.  
Container closure system (Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV) 
The LVV is filled in vials that are stoppered and capped with aluminium seals.  
The vials, stoppers, and seals are supplied in a sterile, ready-to-use state to represent a primary 
packaging that complies with Ph. Eur. standards.  
Stability  (Anti-BCMA02  CAR LVV) 
Several Anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV lots have been placed on stability at the intended long-term storage 
condition to demonstrate the biological and physical stability throughout the proposed shelf-life.  
In addition, several stability lots were placed on stability at an accelerated storage condition to 
evaluate biological and physical stability during potential temperature excursions outside the intended 
long-term storage condition. In addition, freeze/thaw and thermal stress stability were also evaluated. 
Based on the presented data and justifications, the proposed shelf life at the recommended storage 
condition is acceptable.  
2.2.2.2. Part 2: Active substance (Idecabtagene vicleucel) 
General Information 
Idecabtagene vicleucel consists of T cells transduced with the anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV encoding a CAR 
that recognises BCMA. The CAR is comprised of a murine extracellular single-chain variable fragment 
(scFv) specific for recognising BCMA followed by a human CD8α hinge and transmembrane domain 
fused to the T cell cytoplasmic signalling domains of CD137 (4-1BB) and CD3ζ chain, in tandem. 
Antigen-specific activation induces signalling initiated by CD3ζ and 4-1BB domains and subsequent 
CAR+ T cell activation.  
Details on the CAR protein construct within the transduced T cell together with a description of the 
different CAR domains and their main function have been provided. Information on the nucleotide and 
amino acid sequence of the CAR construct annotating the major components has been also presented.

Manufacturers 
The ide-cel active substance (AS) manufacturing process consists of two steps: PBMCs (intermediate) 
and cell culture. The cryopreserved PBMC is shipped to the ide-cel manufacturing and testing facility in 
USA, Celgene Corporation, Building S12, 556 Morris Avenue, Summit, New Jersey 07901, USA,  which 
holds a valid EU GMP certificate.  
Celgene Distribution B.V.  in Utrecht in the Netherlands is responsible for importation and batch release 
of ide-cel product into EU/EEA and holds a valid EU GMP certificate and a valid manufacturing 
authorisation. 
Manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacture of ide-cel is a continuous process from active substance (AS) to final product (FP). 
The patient’s PBMCs are obtained via a standard leukapheresis procedure followed by a PBMC isolation. 
At the Celgene S12 manufacturing facility, the PBMC bags are thawed for cell culture expansion.  
IPCs, critical and non-critical process parameters,  and processing times are listed for each unit 
operation for the manufacturing process. Compositions of cell culture media and solutions have been 
provided. 
Control of materials 
Raw materials are purchased sterile from approved suppliers and are accepted based on suppliers’ 
certification documentation and testing following approved specifications. The suppliers, grade and 
specifications for the raw materials  are provided as well as representative certificates. 
The applicant confirms that apheresis procurement and testing is controlled according to the 
requirements of the relevant European Commission Directives in each Member State, and that an 
apheresis centre qualification programme  is in place to ensure proper  oversight of the apheresis 
process and to initiate and maintain both chain of custody (COC) and chain of identity (COI).  
Controls of critical steps and intermediates 
Performance parameters  for ide-cel manufacturing are classified as critical process parameter  (CPP) or 
non-critical process parameter  (nCPP) and are evaluated as controllable within PARs.  
Microbial contamination control within the manufacturing process is ensured by using aseptic 
techniques and closed system manipulations, whenever possible. A mycoplasma release test at harvest 
day is performed. Manufacturing facilitates are designed to prevent microbial  contamination, and 
microbial  contamination controls are in place. Raw materials used are procured sterile or sterile filtered 
prior  to use in manufacture.  
Process validation 
Process validation was based on site-specific and product-specific validation studies.  
Validation of the manufacturing route intended for the EU/EEA market covered leukapheresis receipt to 
manufacturing of cryopreserved PBMCs followed by final product manufacturing at the Celgene S12 
facility.  
Manufacturing process development 
Critical quality attributes were identified according to ICH Q8, Q9, and Q10 utilising a risk-based 
approach to assess and categorise product quality attributes. Justifications for each attribute’s 
designation are provided.  
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021

Overall, adequate process parameters,  process time and hold time studies were performed for different 
operations of the manufacturing process. 
Overall, the manufacturing process development is considered satisfactory. 
Characterisation 
Characterisation of the ide-cel CAR, vector integration, mechanism of action and clinical finished 
product batches were performed.  
The characterisation test methods are sufficiently described. 
Impurities 
Potential product-related impurities in ide-cel product are provided. Summaries of impurity 
characterisation analytical methods are provided, including the determined limit of quantification. 
Analytical methods were qualified to detect process-related impurity levels (in the required matrices) 
and demonstrated to be suitable for their intended use. 
Specification, analytical procedures, reference standards, batch analysis, and container 
closure 
The ide-cel active substance immediately enters the finished product process, the transition from 
active substance to finished product does not include any hold steps. Therefore, there are no 
specifications, batch analyses or justification of specification or description of container closure systems 
for ide-cel active substance. Ide-cel is controlled at the level of the finished product. Considering the 
nature of the product, the applicant’s approach is considered acceptable. 
Stability 
Due to the continuous manufacturing process, there are no stability data presented for ide-cel active 
substance. As no hold step is foreseen at active substance level before manufacturing of finished 
product, no stability studies have been performed at that level and this is acceptable.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development   
Ide-cel is formulated as a cell suspension (dispersion) for IV administration. The finished product is

Pharmaceutical development 
The excipients used in the formulation of finished product are Plasma-Lyte A (sodium chloride, sodium 
gluconate, sodium acetate trihydrate, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride, water for injections), 
which provides the source of electrolytes and CryoStor CS10, which is the cryopreservative agent. The 
formulation with a final DMSO concentration of 5% (v/v) was demonstrated to be suitable for the 
intended use. There are no novel excipients used. There has been no formulation change during ide-cel 
manufacturing development history.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
In general, the finished product manufacturing process is well described. Manufacturing for ide-cel is a 
continuous process. 
Process validation 
The process validation for the entire manufacturing process, from apheresis material to cryopreserved 
ide-cel, is adequately described.  
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
Specification 
The release and stability specifications for ide-cel finished product are provided. The potential presence 
of elemental impurities in the active substance and finished product has been assessed on a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D guideline for elemental impurities.  The risk of carryover of elemental 
impurities from reagents and materials used for manufacture is considered negligible and no additional 
control is required. 
Based on a review of the manufacturing process, a risk analysis and the information received from 
both the raw material and the single use component suppliers, no actionable risk for the presence of 
nitrosamine impurities in ide-cel finished product was identified. The applicant will assess the risk for 
the presence of nitrosamines in the event of process and/or material changes and will initiate 
confirmatory testing as required if a risk is identified.  
Analytical procedures and reference standards 
The principle of each method and the most relevant information for performance of the methods used 
for finished product release are provided.  
A summary of validation data for the non-compendial methods, as well as verification information for 
the compendial method are provided. In addition, full validation reports are also provided. History of 
analytical method development and finished product specification has been presented.  
Analytical methods have been transferred. Assay transfer was monitored by testing several batches at 
both sites, respectively, and monitoring the results against predefined acceptance criteria.   
The information provided is sufficient and adequate. 
Batch analysis 
Release data for ide-cel batches manufactured during clinical trials is included in the dossier and reveal 
no inconsistencies or safety concerns.

Container closure system 
The primary  container closure systems for distribution of ide-cel, are commercially  available and 
designed for storage of blood and blood components and are made from ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) 
film. Each infusion bag contains 10-30 mL (50 mL bag), 30-70 mL (250 mL bag) or 55-100 mL (500 
mL bag) of cell dispersion for infusion. The secondary packaging is an aluminium cassette, designed to 
protect the product during storage, shipment, and handling. A vapour phase liquid-nitrogen shipping 
container is used to ship ide-cel to the treatment site. The suitability of the container closure system 
including discussion of extractables and leachables has been demonstrated. 
Stability of the product 
A 12 months shelf-life when stored at the recommended long-term storage condition in the vapour 
phase of liquid nitrogen (≤ -130°C) is claimed for the finished product. 
The presented stability protocol reflects the commercial  finished product release and stability 
specifications.  
Based on the stability data presented the claimed shelf life for the finished product of 12 months when 
stored in the vapour phase of liquid nitrogen (≤ -130°C) is acceptable. Each bag must be infused 
within 1 hour from start of thaw. After thawing, the volume of the product intended for infusion should 
be kept at room  temperature (20°C – 25°C). The product must not be refrozen following thaw.

Virus safety 
The virus safety of the ide-cel final product relies solely on the selection and quality of the raw 
materials,  testing of starting materials and adherence to GMP. 
The anti-BCMA02 lentiviral vector is produced by transient transfection of HEK293T cells. The cell line 
genealogy has been sufficiently described and tested sufficiently for adventitious viruses according to 
Ph. Eur. 5.2.3 and ICH Q5A. No viruses were found by any assay in any cell bank.  
The autologous PBMCs are obtained from the patients by leukapheresis. Each patient/PBMC donor is 
tested at minimum  according to Directive 2006/17/EC with CE-marked test kits.  
No materials of direct animal origin are used in the manufacture of ide-cel. None of the excipients are 
of animal or human origin. Sufficient information on virus safety is provided for the other raw materials 
of biological origin and is supported by respective certificates. In summary, virus safety has been 
sufficiently assured.  
TSE compliance 
Raw materials of animal or human origin are used in the ide-cel manufacturing process. Valid 
certificates of suitability issued by the EDQM are provided. Compliance with the TSE guideline for all 
raw materials of direct animal origin and with EU Directives for human-derived materials has been 
demonstrated.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical  and biological  aspects 
Overall, adequate quality documentation is provided for the anti-BCMA02 LVV and ide-cel product.  
All relevant manufacturing and testing sites hold valid manufacturing authorisations and/or valid EU 
GMP certificates.  
The ide-cel manufacturing process is sufficiently described, and CPPs and intermediates are 
demonstrated to be overall adequately controlled. Starting and raw materials for ide-cel are also 
considered appropriately  controlled.  
The LVV commercial  manufacturing process was sufficiently validated. The criticality of process 
parameters  and IPCs was re-evaluated along with the corresponding acceptance criteria to define the 
commercial  manufacturing control strategy. An OPV programme  has been implemented for commercial 
production. The determination of quality attributes is reasonable. Average performance recovery data 
and impurities concentration are presented for several process steps and indicate good performance.  
Process parameter  risk assessment and process characterisation has been performed. Comprehensive 
validation reports  were presented for all analytical assays. Critical quality attributes (CQAs) were 
identified utilising a risk-based approach, and justifications for each attribute’s designation are 
provided. Both product-related as well as process-related impurities are demonstrated to be overall 
sufficiently controlled.  
The final product composition preserves quality attributes throughout formulation, cryopreservation, 
thawing and administration, and is deemed suitable for the intended use. The production process for 
final product is considered validated and demonstrates that the manufacture of finished product is of 
acceptable quality.  
Long-term stability data have been provided for a sufficient number of batches supporting the 
proposed shelf life of 12 months when stored at ≤ -130°C.  
The TSE and virus safety of Abecma has been sufficiently shown.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions  on the chemical, pharmaceutical  and biological  aspects 
The overall quality of Abecma is considered acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions as 
defined in the SmPC. The different aspects of the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
documentation comply with existing guidelines. The manufacturing process of the active substance is 
adequately described, controlled and validated. The active substance is well characterised and 
appropriate  specifications are set. The manufacturing process of the finished product has been 
satisfactorily described and validated. The quality of the finished product is controlled by adequate test 
methods and specifications. Adventitious agents’ safety including TSE have been sufficiently assured.

the CAT recommended several points for further investigation. 
2.3.  Non-clinical  aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary  pharmacodynamic  studies 
Ide-cel is an autologous gene-engineered T cell therapy expressing BCMA-specific CAR. The principal 
mechanism of action is cytolysis of BCMA+ cells through specific recognition and binding to BCMA 
expressing cells, signalling through the CAR to activate the CAR+ T cells, release of cytokines such as 
IFN-γ, and stimulation of cell proliferation to increase the population of CD3+/CAR+ T cells and 
cytolysis of BCMA+ tumour cells. 
In vitro studies 
The in vitro pharmacology studies used human tumour cell lines, primary  cells, and tumour biopsies to 
determine BCMA expression, ide-cel anti-BCMA CAR expression, CAR-to-target binding, specificity, 
activity and potency.  
In vitro correlation between BCMA expression, cell surface BCMA and CAR T cell activation 
When correlating tumour cell line BCMA mRNA  expression and IFN-γ release, it was shown (Figures 1 
and 2) that there is a threshold for BCMA mRNA level above which the anti-BCMA CAR T cells are 
activated and start releasing IFN-γ. In particular, cell lines HDLM-2, NALM-6 and NALM-16 express 
BCMA but have mRNA  levels below the threshold and do not produce detectable cell surface BCMA. 
Other tumour cell lines, such as MEC-1, Daudi and RPMI-6666, have BCMA mRNA levels above the 
threshold and sufficient cell surface BCMA receptor expression to activate the anti-BCMA CAR T cells. 
Similarly,  when using biopsied primary  human CLL tumour cells, only BCMA-positive tumour cells 
trigger activation of the anti-BCMA CAR T cells and start releasing IFN-γ (figure 3).

Figure 1: Ide-cel IFN-gamma release correlates with tumour cell line BCMA mRNA 
expression 
Anti-BCMA CAR T cell (ide-cel) activation and IFN-γ release correlates with BCMA m RNA expression in human B cell tumour cell 
lines. The relative BCMA m RNA expression () was assessed by RT-qPCR assay, and expressed as the difference in am plification 
cycle times (ΔCt) relative to a “housekeeping” gene. ΔCt levels are inversely proportional to the am ount of BCMA m RNA in the 
sam ple. The BCMA-negative (BCMA-) m yelogenous leukaemia cell line K562 was used as a control. Control or tumour cell lines were 
co-cultured for 24 hours with anti-BCMA CAR T cells and IFN-γ release () was quantified by ELISA. No, or very little, IFN-γ was 
released upon co-culture with BCMA- tumour cell lines representing m yelogenous (K562) or acute lym phoblastic (NALM-6 and NALM-
16) leukaemia and Hodgkin’s (HDLM-2) lym phoma. In contrast, substantial am ounts of IFN-γ were released upon co-culture with 
BCMA+ tum our cell lines representing B cell chronic lymphoblastic (MEC-1) leukaemia and Mantle cell (JeKo-1), Hodgkin’s (RPMI-
6666) or Burkitt’s (Daudi) lym phomas. BCMA m RNA expression correlated with BCMA receptor density. Substantial IFN-γ release 
was observed for tumour cell lines expressing BCMA m RNA at a threshold (- - -) of ΔCt ≤ 2.

Figure 2: ide-cel IFN-gamma release correlates with tumour cell line BCMA receptor density 
Anti-BCMA CAR T cell (ide-cel) activation and IFN-γ release correlates with BCMA receptor density on human m ultiple myeloma and 
B cell tum our cell lines. Tumour cell surface BCMA expression () was determined by flow cytometric analysis using a m ouse anti-
hum an BCMA m onoclonal antibody. The relative BCMA receptor density was assessed by correlating the fluorescence intensity to a 
known number of bound antibodies (antibody binding capacity, ABC). Controls included the BCMA- m yelogenous leukaemia cell line 
K562, and K562 cells transduced to express BCMA at low (clone 16) or high (clone B5) densities. Control or tumour cell lines were 
co-cultured for 24 hours with anti-BCMA CAR T cells and release () was quantified by ELISA. No, or very little, IFN-γ was released 
upon co-culture with BCMA- tum our cell lines representing myelogenous (K562) or acute lymphoblastic (NALM-6 and NALM-16) 
leukaemia and Mantel cell (REC-1) or Hodgkin’s (HDLM-2) lym phomas. In contrast, substantial am ounts of IFN-γ were released 
upon co-culture with BCMA+ K562-BCMA transductants (clones 16 [m oderate] and B5 [high]) and BCMA+ tum our cell lines 
representing B cell chronic lymphoblastic (MEC-1) leukaemia, Mantle cell (JeKo-1), Hodgkin’s (RPMI-6666) or Burkitt’s (Daudi, 
Ram os) lymphomas, and MM (RPMI-8226). IFN-γ release and BCMA receptor density correlated with tumour cell BCMA m RNA 
expression. Note: BCMA receptor density of ‘0’ (not detectable) is shown as ‘1’ on log scale.

Anti-BCMA CAR T cell (ide-cel) activation and IFN-γ release correlates with specific recognition of BCMA on B cell CLL (MEC-1) 
tum our cell lines and primary CLL PBMCs. In two separate experiments, anti-CD19Δ (control, ) or anti-BCMA CAR T cells (, ) 
were co-cultured with PBMCs from healthy donors or from patients with BCMA- (top) or BCMA+ (bottom) CLL, as determined flow 
cytometry. Additional controls included CAR T cells alone or co-cultured with BCMA- K562 cells, BCMA+ K562-BCMA transductants 
(clone B5), or the BCMA+ MEC-1 CLL cell line. As determined by ELISA, IFN-γ was released only by anti-BCMA CAR T cells co-
cultured with the BCMA+ K562-BCMA transductants, CLL MEC-1 cells or CLL PBMCs. No IFN-γ was released spontaneously (CAR cells 
alone) or in the presence of healthy PBMCs or BCMA- CLL PBMCs 
In vitro BCMA-specific cytolysis of tumour cells 
Flow cytometry analysis showed that the anti-BCMA CAR T cells specifically killed the BCMA-positive 
cells while little or no cytolysis occurred upon co-culture with the negative control, anti-CD19Δ CAR T 
cells (figure 4).

Figure 4: BCMA-specific cytolysis of tumour cells by ide-cel 
Anti-BCMA CAR T cells (ide-cel) specifically kill BCMA+ tum our cells. BCMA- K562 and BCMA+ K562-BCMA transductants were each 
labelled with unique florescent dyes and mixed in equal numbers, prior to co-culture for 4 hours in the presence of anti-CD19Δ 
(control, ) or anti-BCMA CAR T cells () that were added to achieve different effector cell-to-target cell ratios (fold excess T cells). 
After incubation, the numbers of BCMA+ and BCMA- tum our cells surviving were determined by flow cytometry. The percentage (%) 
of BCMA+ tum our cells undergoing cytotoxicity was calculated as 100% m inus the number of surviving BCMA+ tumour cells divided 
by the number of surviving BCMA- tum our cells, after correcting for spontaneous cytolysis. Anti-BCMA, but not anti-CD19Δ, CAR T 
cells, induced specific cytolysis of BCMA+ K562-BCMA transductants, but not BCMA- K562 cells (left). Ide-cel, but not bb612 anti-
CD19Δ, CAR T cells induced specific cytolysis of BCMA+ MM RPMI-8226 cells (right). 
In vitro BCMA-specific proliferation of ide-cel CAR T cells 
T cells are activated and proliferate when adequately stimulated by professional antigen presenting 
cells (APCs). Similar,  CAR T cells activate and proliferate when appropriately  triggered by target cells, 
but without the need for APCs. As expected, the anti-BCMA CAR T cells proliferated only when the 
target cells expressed BCMA (Figure 5).

Figure 5: BCMA-specific proliferation  of ide-cel CAR+ T cells 
In vitro - BCMA mRNA and receptor expression on tumour cell lines and primary human tissues  
Most of the lymphomas with substantial BCMA mRNA  expression were non-Hodgkin’s lymphomas 
(NHL), while only a few of the Hodgkin’s lymphomas expressed a significant amount of BCMA mRNA. 
Some non-lymphoma tissues, such as spleen and samples from patients with ulcerative colitis, had 
significant expression of BCMA mRNA.  These tissues are enriched with normal mature B-lymphocytes, 
which are known to express BCMA. In the current MAA for Abecma  (ide-cel), only treatment of multiple 
myeloma (MM) is applied for. Notably, BCMA mRNA  levels in MM tumours were not investigated. 
However,  BCMA receptor  expression on human MM was investigated using immunohistochemistry 
(IHC). IHC staining of BCMA were performed on human MM and lymphoma tumour cell lines, and on 
primary  human MM and lymphoma biopsies.  BCMA staining was less prevalent within human 
lymphoma biopsies than in MM biopsies. BCMA+ cells represented ≥50% of the tumour tissue in 41% 
of the MM biopsies evaluated, while no lymphoma biopsy displayed > 30% BCMA+ cells (figure 6).

Studies were performed with BCMA+ RPMI-8226 multiple myeloma  tumour cell line xenografts. RPMI-
8226 multiple myeloma  tumour cells with relatively high level of BCMA expression were 
subcutaneously injected into immunocompromised  NSG mice, and ide-cel treatment was started at day 
18 (study B4-14-011) or 39 (Study B4-14-043) post-tumour implantation. In both studies, an

additional group received 1 mg/kg bortezomib  (Velcade® - positive control) IV twice weekly for 4 
weeks starting at day 18 (study B4-14-011) or 1 mg/kg bortezomib  (Velcade® - positive control) IV 
twice weekly for 2 weeks  starting at day 49 (Study B4-14-043). In both settings, ide-cel treatment 
rapidly eliminated RPMI-8226 tumours. Treatment was well tolerated, and survival was 100% in the 
ide-cel groups, Figures 7 and 8.

Pharmacological dose responses of ide-cel was investigated with BCMA+ RPMI-8226 human MM SC 
xenografts. A single IV administration of ide-cel at doses ≤6.16 x 104 CAR+ T cells had no effect on 
tumour growth, while doses ≥6.16 x 105 CAR+ T cells resulted in clearance of all tumours (Figure 9).

These results indicate that treatment with ide-cel is either fully effective or not effective at all, and that 
the number of injected CAR+ T cells has to exceed a certain level for a successful outcome.  
In vivo studies using BCMA+/CD19+ Daudi human Burkitt’s lymphoma xenografts 
In vivo studies were performed by intravenously injecting BCMA+/CD19+ Daudi human Burkitt’s 
lymphoma tumour cells into NSG mice. The applied indication for ide-cel includes only treatment of 
multiple myeloma,  and not lymphoma. However,  the Daudi lymphoma  cell line represents cells with 
lower BCMA expression than the RPMI-8226 multiple myeloma  cell line, thus giving information about 
how a low surface level of BCMA affects treatment.  
In the first study (Study B4-14-050), a single IV administration of 6.16 x 106 CAR+ ide-cel on Day 8 or 
18 post-tumour injection was well tolerated, and resulted in inhibition of tumour growth, increasing

body weights and 100% survival at Day 51. Tumours were not totally eliminated, but mean tumour 
size was still decreasing at D51 when the study was terminated (data not shown). 
The second study (Study B4-14-065) was conducted to investigate the dose-response relationship. 
Female NSG mice received IV injections of BCMA+/CD19+ Daudi BL FFLuc-transduced tumour cells to 
establish systemic xenografts. At 9 days post-tumour cell injection, mice received a single IV injection 
of either the vehicle alone (vehicle control) or total T cell doses of 1 x 103 to 1 x 107 ide-cel (test 
article). Because the percentage of CAR+ T cells in ide-cel was 70.1%, the respective CAR+ T cell 
doses were 7.0 x 102 to 7.0 x 106 CAR+ T cells. Ide-cel doses of ≥3.5 x 106 CAR+ T cells resulted in 
near elimination of BCMA+ tumours and 100% survival until the end of study, while doses of ≤7.0 x 
104 CAR+ T cells had no effect on tumour growth or survival. Doses of ide-cel between these resulted 
only in temporary  tumour reductions, since tumour size initially decreased and then increased 1-2 
weeks after start of treatment (data not shown). 
In vivo – pharmacologic activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, biodistribution and general 
safety 
The pharmacologic activity, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, biodistribution, and general safety 
of ide-cel anti-BCMA CAR T cells were investigated in NSG mice with and without BCMA+ RPMI-8226 
human multiple myeloma  subcutaneous xenografts (Study B4-15-090 – Table 1). Female NOD-Cg-
Prkdcscid IL2rgtm1Wjl/SzJ (NSG) mice received SC injections of 0.2 mL of a 5 x 107 cell/mL 
suspension containing 1 x 107 BCMA+ RPMI-8226 MM tumour cells to establish SC xenografts. At 25 
days post-tumour implantation, one group each of mice with and without xenografts received a single 
intravenous (IV) injection of 0.2 mL of a cell suspension containing either the vehicle alone (vehicle 
control) or an identical CAR+ T cell dose of 3 x 106 CAR+ bb612 anti-CD19Δ CAR T cells (negative 
control) or 3 x 106 CAR+ ide-cel anti-BCMA CAR T cells (test article). Because the percentages of CAR+ 
T cells in bb612 and ide-cel were 38.2% and 60.4%, respectively, the respective total T cell doses 
were 7.9 x 106 and 5.0 x 106 CAR+ T cells for bb612 and ide-cel. bb612 anti-CD19Δ CAR T cells lack T 
cell signalling domains and are therefore an inactive CAR T cell control. The bb612 and ide-cel CAR T 
cells were manufactured from T cells from the same healthy human donor (Donor No. 800499) by 
transduction with lentiviral vector (LVV) Lot Nos. 11913 and 11213, respectively. Mice were monitored 
until Day 29.

Ide-cel reduced the growth of MM tumour xenografts similar  to the other in vivo studies with RPMI-
8226. Further, the level of CD3+ T cells in peripheral blood went through several phases, with an initial 
peak the first days after injection of ide-cel, followed by a decline before an antigen-triggered 
proliferation, and lastly a steady decline after the tumour cells were cleared. Only up to 60% of the 
cells in the xenograft expressed BCMA. It is not clear if the remaining tumour cells are RPMI-8226 cells 
not expressing BCMA or if they are other cells recruited to the tumour. Nonetheless, after ide-cel 
treatment, the whole tumours rapidly were eliminated. Within liver,  kidney or BM, CD3+ T cells were 
generally not present or very rare.  Within spleen and lung, CD3+ T cells peaked at a frequency of rare 
to rare-to-occasional on Days 8 and 15, suggesting that these tissues provided temporary  residence 
for these cells after dosing (Figure 10 and 11).

Secondary pharmacodynamic  studies 
Studies of unintended off-target binding of anti-BCMA antibodies on cellular microarrays expressing 
BCMA-related and non-BCMA-related human proteins, and tissue cross-reactivity of anti-human BCMA 
antibody immunostaining of normal human tissues showed no evidence for secondary PD effects (data 
not shown). 
Safety pharmacology  programme  and Pharmacodynamic  drug interactions   
No dedicated Safety pharmacology and Pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been 
performed. Based on the nature of the product and in line with the Guideline on the quality, non-
clinical and clinical aspects of gene therapy medicinal products (EMA/CAT/80183/2014), this was 
considered acceptable.

2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics  (PK) 
Conventional PK studies were not conducted as ide-cel is an autologous human cell-based product. The 
PK and biodistribution of ide-cel were evaluated in NSG mice with and without BCMA+ xenografts. 
Because ide-cel-derived CAR+ T cells proliferate only upon binding to BCMA+ tumour cells, the use of 
animals with and without xenografts allowed an understanding of the kinetics of CD3+ T cells within 
tumour and non-tumour tissues, and of the BD of ide-cel. 
In NSG mice administered ide-cel, mean peripheral  blood CD3+/CAR+ T cell counts initially peaked on 
Day 2 and then declined; the peak on Day 2 was similar in all mice and may represent the movement 
of T cells from tissues where they temporarily  resided after dosing. A second peak (≈20-fold higher) on 
Day 11 in mice with xenografts is consistent with proliferation of the CAR+ T cells upon recognition of 
the BCMA+ tumour cells; these circulating T cells declined after the tumour was cleared (figure 16 
above). For mice with xenografts administered ide-cel, the CD3+ T cell kinetics within non-tumour 
tissues mirrored  the proliferation of CD3+ T cells within peripheral blood, suggesting that the increased 
T cell frequencies in tissues reflected T cell movement in blood. These PK results for mice with BCMA+ 
xenografts administered ide-cel indicated that the peripheral  blood CAR+ T cell count correlated with 
relative numbers of CD3+ T cells within MM tumour xenografts and with the biodistribution of CD3+ T 
cells within other tissues and is a useful PK marker. 
No other nonclinical PK, biodistribution (BD), metabolism,  excretion, or PK interaction studies were 
conducted with ide-cel. Such studies for this type of human cell therapy in nonclinical species have 
limited utility for translational purposes or understanding exposure-effect relationships in humans. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Conventional animal studies employing common toxicology study designs are not appropriate  for ide-
cel since autologous human T cells do not graft in immunocompetent animals and thus, in vivo 
nonclinical general safety, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, developmental safety or reproductive safety 
studies were not conducted. 
The safety of ide-cel was assessed by evaluating the potential genotoxic effects of the vector via 
insertional mutagenesis, and the potential transformation of transduced cells. 
Single and repeat-dose toxicity 
No single or repeat-dose toxicity studies were conducted with ide-cel as traditional animal studies 
employing common toxicology study designs are not appropriate  for ide-cel since autologous human T 
cells do not graft in immunocompetent animals.  
Genotoxicity 
Ide-cel is an autologous human cellular product and therefore, standard genotoxicity studies eg, Ames 
assay, clastogenicity assessments were not conducted. However, vector insertion site analysis (ISA) 
was conducted to assess the potential risk for insertional mutagenesis due to lentiviral vector (LVV) 
integration into the genome resulting in the theoretical potential to disrupt the function of normal 
genes and/or activate oncogenes, potentially driving malignant transformation.   
The LVV was identical for all studies. The design safety features of the anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV 
considerably reduce both the likelihood of mobilisation of the provirus from the host genome and the 
potential to activate transcription of adjacent oncogenes which might be localised near the proviral

insertion site. The integrated anti-BCMA02 LVV is flanked by identical HIV-1 based ΔU3 regions that 
contain a deletion of the U3 enhancer/promoter, conferring the self-inactivating (SIN) property that 
prevents LTR- driven transcription of the transgene and neighbouring genes reducing the probability  of 
oncogenesis related to insertional mutagenesis. However,  the potential genotoxic risk associated with 
transduction of T cells with the anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV was assessed by evaluating the vector 
integration pattern of the anti-BCMA02 transgene in the genome of CAR T cells from clinical ide-cel 
drug product (DP)_ lots. 
Twenty clinical ide-cel DP lots were selected based on their respective surface CAR expression (% 
CAR+) and vector copy number (VCN) characteristics, that were representative of the range of clinical 
manufacturing experience. All the tested drug product lots were infused into patients in pivotal Study 
BB2121-MM-001 or supportive Study CRB-401. 
The  insertion  site  analysis of  ide-cel  lots  from  healthy donors  and patients  indicated no  concerns  of 
oncogenicity. There was no preferred integration in or near genes previously involved in severe adverse 
events in gene therapy trials (eg, CCND2, LMO2, MDS1/EVI1 [MECOM], MN1. The insertion site analysis 
data  suggest  an  LVV  insertion  preference  consistent  with  WT  HIV  and  other  LVV  described  in  the 
literature. The analyses revealed no concerns related to integration site, polyclonality, or site preference.  
Insertion site  analyses of all  tested drug product samples  were  representative  of the  range of vector 
copy  number  in  ide-cel  clinical  studies to  date.  High  Confidence -Insertion  Sites  showed  statistically 
significant correlation with VCN (Spearman’s  ρ values of 0.8256 and 0.4797 for copies/diploid genome 
and copies/CAR+ T cell, respectively) (data not shown).  
The  insertion  profile  of  anti-BCMA  LVV  demonstrated preference  for  the  coding regions  of  expressed 
genes  versus  regulatory  elements,  which  decreases  the  likelihood  of  insertions  that  disrupt  gene 
regulation and therefore the probability of oncogenesis via malignant transformation (data not shown). 
A highly polyclonal vector integration profile was observed across all samples.  
Also, the vector exists as a single proviral  sequence in 99.7% of vector containing reads indicating that 
the majority of vector genomes present are not in concatemeric orientation. There was no specificity of 
vector integration relative to the transcription start sites of known oncogenes. 
Carcinogenicity 
The potential of ide-cel to transform transduced T cells was assessed in an in vitro study of T cell 
growth in the presence of and absence of IL-2 (study report RPT-018530). The transition from IL-2-
dependent to IL-2-independent T cell growth is known to arise following the malignant transformation 
of HTLV-I-infected T cells (Ahsan, 2006; Maeda, 1985; Migone, 1995; Yoshida, 2001) and is used as 
an indication of mutagenesis and transformation. 
VCN/transduced cell in patients and normal healthy donor T cells, expanded with or without 
transduction with anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV, were cultured in the presence or absence of IL-2. The cells 
were harvested at various time points and evaluated for phenotypic composition (by flow cytometry) 
and T cell receptor clonal diversity (by T cell receptor [TCR] sequence analysis). Cells cultured with 
supplemental IL-2 were used as controls for homeostatic maintenance. The primary  indicator of 
transformation was considered to be the expansion of cells without IL-2; secondarily, changes in 
phenotypic characteristics and TCR clonality provided supporting data. 
For all T cell cultures (transduced or untransduced) without IL-2, the total cell numbers decreased and 
population doubling levels (PDLs) were negative (Figure 12). On Day 22, analysis of the culture 
confirmed no detectable cells. There were no increases in CAR+ expression frequency in cultures

without IL-2; changes in cultures with IL-2 were variable and donor-dependent). An overall decrease in 
clonal diversity was observed for all cultures, including untransduced cells but this was not considered 
indicative of transformation but rather a consequence of the decreasing heterogeneity over time in 
culture as overall T cell numbers decreased.

Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
No reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted.  
Local tolerance 
Although no dedicated local tolerance studies in nonclinical species were conducted, ide-cel was 
administered to mice as a single IV injection via tail vein with no abnormal observations recorded at 
the injection site. 
The absence of local tolerance studies was acceptable. 
Other toxicity studies 
The unintended off-target binding of four anti-human BCMA antibodies to BCMA-related and non-
BCMA-related proteins was assessed using a cellular microarray  of HEK293 cell lines, each transfected 
with a vector coding for a green fluorescent protein that confirms transfection efficiency, and a single, 
specific transgenic human protein, which is expressed on the cell plasma  membrane surface. The 
results indicated that HEK293 cells do not normally express BCMA or other related TNFRSF member 
proteins, or unrelated proteins that would be recognised by an anti-BCMA antibody, and that the tested 
anti-human BCMA Abs specifically bind to BCMA/TNFRSF17 only. These Abs did not bind to any of the 
22 tested TNFRSF member  proteins, or to any of 358 unrelated proteins (data not shown). 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 44/164 
 
 
 
 
 
Furthermore, BCMA does not appear to share cross-reactive epitopes with other TNFRSF member 
proteins (data not shown). 
A GLP-compliant tissue cross-reactivity study was conducted to address the target and off-target 
binding in normal human tissues. Target and off-target binding studies of anti-BCMA antibodies and a 
tissue reactivity study confirmed the expression and distribution of BCMA in normal human tissues. 
Staining of plasma membrane and cytoplasm was observed of resident, migrating, and/or infiltrating 
mononuclear cells in several human tissues including colon, Fallopian tube, oesophagus, small 
intestine, stomach, lymph node, parathyroid, prostate, salivary gland, thymus, and tonsil (data not 
shown). In addition, staining of spindle cells in thyroid and tonsil were also seen. The spindle cell 
staining was considered unexpected due to lack of supportive literature, but since staining was 
observed in only two tissues, nonspecific staining of this cell type cannot be ruled out. The staining of 
the membrane and cytoplasm of resident, migrating, and/or infiltrating mononuclear cells in human 
tissues was expected, based on supportive literature reports of BCMA expression on plasma cells in 
normal human tissues (Bellucci, 2005; Carpenter, 2013; Kalled, 2005; Laabi,  1994; Laabi,  1992; Ng, 
2004; O’Connor, 2004). 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental  risk assessment 
For ide-cel drug product, the criteria listed in the “Good Practice on the assessment of genetically-
modified organism (GMO)-related aspects in the context of clinical trials with human cells genetically 
modified by means of retro/lentiviral vectors, Version 3” are considered fulfilled. The submission of a 
simplified environmental risk assessment (ERA) report is therefore appropriate.   
Environmental risk associated with ide-cel is considered negligible. Human cells cannot proliferate in 
the environment and the applicant has demonstrated the absence of replication competent lentivirus 
(RCL) in the ide-cel final drug product as well as for in-process controls. Potential hazards is therefore 
only related to human health and thus potential exposure of, in particular, immune-incompetent 
persons. Potential hazards to animal health or the environment are not applicable. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on the non-clinical  aspects 
Pharmacology 
The pharmacological data show that ide-cel has a BCMA antigen-specific dose-dependent activity 
against both low and high BCMA+ expressing tumours, and that it secretes cytokines, proliferates and 
kills a variety of multiple myeloma  and lymphoma tumour cell lines. Collectively, 
immunohistochemistry data demonstrate the ability of ide-cel to express the anti-BCMA CAR, to 
specifically recognise and bind to BCMA on MM and B cell malignancy tumour cells, and then undergo 
signalling of the CAR and activation of the CAR+ T cells. This ide-cel activity resulted in BCMA specific 
release of IFN-γ, BCMA-specific cytolysis of BCMA+ tumour cells but not BCMA-negative cells, and 
subsequent BCMA-specific proliferation of the CAR+ T cells. The primary  pharmacodynamics activity ie. 
cytolysis of BCMA+ tumour cells, was demonstrated by reduction in tumour volume, elimination of 
BCMA+ tumour xenografts, and decreases of tumour-associated serum soluble BCMA. Rapid 
elimination of both subcutaneous and systemic tumours and increased survival was demonstrated in 
NSG mice with BCMA+ xenografts after a single dose of ide-cel. Ide-cel activity was shown in both high 
and low BCMA+ tumour cell lines. In mice, the minimum effective dose (MED) for a single dose of ide-
cel to eliminate multiple myeloma tumours was 6.16 x 105 CAR+ T cells with relatively high BCMA 
expression which represents the human equivalent dose (HED) of 2.05 x 108 CAR+ T cells for a 100-kg 
human. Collectively, the pharmacological data provide sufficient evidence for pharmacological activity 
and a proof of concept for the use of ide-cel in the treatment of patients with multiple myeloma.  As 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 45/164 
 
 
 
well, the in vivo pharmacology studies indicated that a single dose of ide-cel has potent, dose-
dependent activity against both low and high density BCMA+ expressing tumours and provides a 
strong mechanistic basis for the use of ide-cel in BCMA+ malignancies. The data support the 
hypothesis that all primary  human MM should be recognised and killed by ide-cel, as ide-cel is able to 
secrete cytokines, proliferate and kill tumours cell lines with low receptor density. It is also expected 
that ide-cel will deplete healthy plasma cells that express BCMA. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Conventional pharmacokinetics evaluation was not conducted with ide-cel. However,  sufficient 
characterisation of CAR T cell kinetics and biodistribution to selected organs was performed. 
Toxicology 
Lack of toxicity studies 
Due to the lack of appropriate  animal models for toxicity evaluation, no conventional toxicity studies 
were conducted. 
Risk of insertional mutagenesis and tumorigenic transformation 
A tailored safety evaluation was conducted which focused on the investigation of the risk of insertional 
mutagenesis due to lentiviral integration in the genome of ide-cel CAR T cells and the potential of 
tumorigenic transformation induced in the manufacture of the product.  
The insertion site analysis data indicated no concerning observations related to integration, 
polyclonality, or insertion site preference across the range of vector copy number (VCN) observed in 
clinical studies. The results for the lentiviral vector insertion preference were consistent with wild type 
HIV virus and other described lentiviral vectors. There was also no preferred integration in or near 
genes previously involved in severe adverse events in gene therapy trials (eg, CCND2, LMO2, 
MDS1/EVI1, or MN1.) 
No tumorigenic transformation of T cells following transduction in the ide-cel manufacturing process 
was observed in the IL-2 independent growth study. Moreover, there were no substantial changes in 
CAR T cell phenotypes or CD4:CD8 ratio, or substantial decreases in clonal diversity under any 
condition tested. These indicate that the tumorigenic risk related to the ide-cel manufacturing process 
is negligible. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
It is argued that germline transmission is unlikely since residual infectious anti-BCMA02 CAR LVV 
particles were not detected in ide-cel drug product, and it has been demonstrated that VSV-G 
pseudotyped lentiviral vectors can be expected to be inactivated by the human serum complement. 
Further, the Guideline on non-clinical testing for inadvertent germline transmission of gene transfer 
vectors, EMEA/273974/2005 indicates that the risk of germline transmission associated with the 
administration of genetically modified human cells is considered to be low and, as animal testing of 
human cells may be difficult or not meaningful, non-clinical germline transmission studies of human 
genetically modified cells are not recommended. 
ERA 
Environmental risk associated with ide-cel is considered to be negligible. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT discussion on the non-clinical aspects as described above.

2.3.7.  Conclusion  on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the primary  pharmacodynamic in vitro and in vivo studies provided adequate evidence that 
ide-cel specifically target BCMA which leads to CAR+ T cell activation, proliferation, cytokine secretion, 
and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-expressing cells. 
Ide-cel comprises engineered human T cells, therefore there are no representative in vitro assays, 
ex vivo models, or in vivo models that can accurately address the toxicological characteristics of the 
human product. Hence, traditional toxicology studies used for drug development were not performed. 
Genotoxicity assays and carcinogenicity studies were not conducted. 
In vitro expansion studies from healthy donors and patients showed no evidence for transformation 
and/or immortalisation  and no preferential integration near genes of concern in ide-cel T cells. 
Given the nature of the product, non-clinical studies on fertility, reproduction and development were 
not conducted. 
In conclusion the non-clinical data provided are considered acceptable. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusions on the non-clinical aspects as described above.

Analytical methods 
Bioanalytical methods used in the clinical studies for Ide-cel include a qPCR to detect Ide-cel Transgene 
in  Whole  Blood  and  CD3-Enriched Blood  as  well  as  an  electrochemiluminescent  (ECL)  assay  for  the 
detection of Anti-drug Antibodies to Ide-cel in Serum.  In addition, an ELISPOT assay for determination 
of cellular immunogenicity is presented. 
Assessment report

A real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) assay was used to quantify ide-cel transgene 
in gDNA isolated from CD3+ cells for pharmacokinetic exposure/effect analysis in clinical studies MM-001 
and  CRB-401.  In  this  method  Ide-cel  transgene  copies  per  reaction  are  determined  through  the 
quantification of Psi-Gag, which is a gene that is present in the lentiviral vector that is used to transduce 
cells. Human RNaseP, a housekeeping gene, is used to normalise gDNA input for each sample. The assay 
has been validated to quantify ide-cel transgene copies in genomic DNA (gDNA) isolated from enriched 
CD3-positive (CD3+) cells and/or directly from whole blood.  
An  electrochemiluminescent  (ECL)  immunoassay  on  MSD  platform  was  used  to  detect  Antidrug 
antibodies in human serum samples in clinical studies MM-001 and CRB-401. Detection of ADA was based 
on the bivalent nature of antibodies and the assay utilises a reagent that corresponds to the extracellular 
domain of the ide-cel CAR, BB2121-CAR-ECD. In this assay, samples are pre-incubated with biotinylated 
BB2121-CAR-ECD and  ruthenylated  BB2121-CAR-ECD, and  any  anti-drug  antibodies  present  in  the 
serum  sample  will  form  a  bridge  between  the  conjugated reagents. The  complex  is  then bound to  a 
blocked  MSD-Streptavidin (MSD-SA)  plate,  and detected by  a  chemiluminescent signal.  The  resulting 
electrochemiluminescent signal (ECL or relative lights units, RLU) is directly proportional  to the amount 
of ADA present in the human serum.  
Cell-mediated immune responses were evaluated using an IFN-γ ELISPOT assay in clinical study 
MM-001. In this assay, the subject’s PBMC samples were stimulated ex-vivo using peptides that 
spanned the extracellular domain of the CAR construct. An antigen-specific cellular immune response 
and the resulting production of IFN-γ were detected by ELISPOT where the secreted IFN-γ is captured 
by the anti-IFN-γ antibody immobilised on PVDF surface, detected using a biotinylated second 
anti-IFN-γ antibody, and visualised as coloured spots using streptavidin-HRP conjugate and BCIP/NBT 
substrate. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  application  dossier  consisted  of  interim  results  from  two  clinical  trials,  CRB-401  and  MM-001. 
Study CRB-401 was a first-in-human, 2-part, nonrandomised, open-label, multicentre, Phase 1 study in 
subjects  with  relapsed  or  refractory  multiple  myeloma  (RRMM).  An  exploratory  objective  of  study 
CRB-401 was to characterise the expansion of CAR+ T cells in the peripheral blood. 
Study MM-001 was an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, multinational, Phase 2 study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of ide-cel in subjects with relapsed or refractory MM. One of the secondary objectives 
of  MM-001  was  to  characterise  the  expansion  of  CAR+  T  cells  in  the  peripheral  blood.  The 
pharmacokinetic  (PK)  analysis population  included 127 subjects.  The  time  course  data for  these  two 
trials is shown in Figures 13 and 14 the relevant PK parameters  are shown in Tables 3 and 4.

Table 4: 
 Summary of Study MM-001 Ide-cel Pharmacokinetic Parameters (PK Analysis Population) 
Regarding persistence of ide-cel over time,  study CRB-401 found that 4/18 samples had detectable ide-
cel transgene copy numbers at 12 months, and the respective number was 4/11 for study MM-001. This 
suggests that ide-cel can persist in peripheral blood for up to 1 year post-infusion, or longer.  
As of the data cutoff dates, 17 subjects in study CRB-401 and 29 subjects in study MM-001 received a 
second dose of ide-cel at  a target dose ranging from  150 to 450 × 106  CAR+  T  cells.  Comparing cell 
expansion parameters  after first and second fusion in retreated study CRB-401 subjects, AUC0-28days and 
Cmax  were  21-fold and 16-fold lower,  respectively,  when subjects  were  retreated  (data not  shown). 
Similarly,  cell  expansion parameters  after the first and second infusion in the 29 retreated study MM-
001 subjects, the AUC0-28days and Cmax were 7-fold and 6-fold lower,  respectively,  when subjects were 
retreated.  Figure 15 displays  the  individual AUC0-28days  for  the  first  and second infusion, stratified by 
objective  response.  Cellular  expansion  parameters  after  first  infusion  in  retreated  subjects  were 
comparable  with the overall population.

Study MPK-001: Covariate-exposure, exposure-response and exposure-efficacy analyses 
A  PK  characterisation  analysis  was  performed  using  data  from  the  Pivotal  Study  MM-001  through 
characterisation  of  impact  of  covariates  on  cellular  expansion  and  estimation  of  the  PK  exposure 
parameters  for  relevant  subject  subgroups.  Individual  exposure  parameters  were  obtained  through 
noncompartmental  analysis  methods  from  the  cellular  expansion  time  course  data.  The  specific 
parameters  that were  included as part  of the evaluations were:  Cmax,  AUC0-28days  and AUC0-3M.  All  PK 
parameters  were dose-normalised prior to analysis, unless stated otherwise. 
Several pre-specified covariates were explored for graphical trends with cellular expansion parameters. 
Briefly, the evaluated covariates were in the following major categories: 
•  Baseline demographic factors, including sex, age, body weight, body surface area (BSA), race, 
and ethnicity; 
•  Disease factors, such as number of prior  multiple myeloma  (MM) regimens, last prior  multiple 
myeloma (MM) therapy (such as corticosteroids), extramedullary disease, Eastern Cooperative 
Oncology  Group  (ECOG)  performance  status,  concomitant  medications  of  tocilizumab  or 
corticosteroids administered to manage cytokine release syndrome (CRS), bridging therapy 
•  Baseline/Preinfusion variables,  for  instance,  serum  sBCMA  levels,  urine  monoclonal  protein 
(m-protein); serum m-protein; and

•  Antidrug antibody (ADA)  status: Development  of postinfusion ADAs (as  binary  variable)  was 
evaluated on cell expansion kinetics. 
A graphical assessment of all covariate-parameter combinations was performed (data not shown). Based 
on these evaluations, covariates, such as age, race, ethnicity, sex, ADA status, and number of prior anti-
MM therapies were not found to influence the cell expansion parameters. 
Table  5  shows  the  results  of  statistically  significant (continuous) covariates  for  AUC0-28days,  for  each 
attempted functional form of the model. Since BSA is highly correlated with body weight, these effects 
are  considered  secondary  to  the  effects of  body  weight,  and  any  further  assessment  of  the  clinical 
relevance of these effects focused on body weight. 
Table 5: 
Univariate Correlations between Dose-Normalised AUC0-28days and Statistically Selected 
Continuous Covariates: Study MM-001 
When stratified by target dose, there was an apparent graphical relationship between body weight and 
absolute  (i.e.  not dose-normalised) AUC0-28days and AUC0-3M  following 300 x  106 target dose (p<0.01), 
but no trend of any relationship at the 450 x 106 target dose level (p>0.84). 
Retreatment baseline sBCMA for subjects in MM-001 had an approximate range between 0-1200 ng/mL, 
and  showed  comparable  distribution  as  baseline  before  the  initial  infusion There  was  a  statistically 
significant relationship between retreatment baseline sBCMA and AUC0-28days (r=0.50, p=0.014), but not 
Cmax (r=0.15, p=0.44). 
The  exposure-response  (ER)  analyses  characterised  the  relationship  between  individual  observed 
exposures  (and  other  covariates)  and efficacy endpoints from  Study MM-001. The  exposure-efficacy 
analyses were performed using a data cutoff date of 19 Apr 2019, corresponding to ≥ 3 months of follow-
up  after  the  last  subject  was  infused with  ide-cel.  Subject-level  exposures  were  calculated  through 
noncompartmental  methods.  A  total  of  127 subjects  had both  evaluable  PK  parameters  and efficacy 
endpoints.  The  objective  of  these  analyses  was  to  evaluate  the  ER  of  ide-cel  efficacy endpoints and 
characterise established ER relationships through model-based simulations and provide support for the 
proposed  dose  range.  The  key  efficacy endpoints examined  for  relationship  to  exposure  parameters

summarised in this document include overall response rate (ORR), very good partial response (VGPR) or 
better, complete response (CR) rate, and progression-free survival (PFS). 
Both  a  linear  and  (sigmoid)  Emax  functional  form  was  attempted  in  the  logistic  regression  E-R 
framework. Figure 16 shows observed mean ORR, VGPR and CR at each quartile of log(AUC0- 28days) along 
with model predicted curves from  linear and (sigmoid) Emax models.  For ORR  and VGPR,  the sigmoid 
Emax model was selected as the final model to perform model-based simulations. Sex (M/F) was included 
as a covariate into the ER model for ORR because it was identified as a statistically significant predictor 
of  ORR  from  the  stepwise  covariate  selection  process.  Race  and  ethnicity  were  not  considered  for 
inclusion in the final model, and were excluded from the covariate selection process, because they were 
unknown for more  than 10% of the subjects in the ER analysis. For CR,  the linear model was selected 
as  the  final  model  to  perform  model-based  simulations.  The  stepwise  covariate  selection  process 
identified baseline serum m-protein level as a significant covariate. This covariate was dichotomised to 
≤10 g/L and >10  g/L in  the  current analysis.  The  model  indicates a  higher CR  rate  for  subjects with 
baseline serum m-protein level ≤10 g/L at baseline than for subjects with baseline serum m-protein level 
>10 g/L at baseline.

dose levels. 
Similar to the analyses for efficacy endpoints, exposure safety analyses were performed using data from 
the Pivotal  Study MM-001. Safety events that were  evaluated in relation  to  AUC0-28days  included: CRS 
requiring  tocilizumab  (tCRS),  CRS  requiring  corticosteroids  (sCRS),  higher  grade  CRS  (defined  as 
CRS ≥ Grade 3), investigator identified neurotoxicity (iiNT), and cytopenia. Subject-level exposures were 
calculated through noncompartmental methods. The exposure-safety analyses were performed using a 
data cutoff date of 19 Apr  2019, corresponding to ≥ 3 months of follow-up after the last subject was 
infused with ide-cel.  
For exposure-response analyses of tCRS  and sCRS,  subjects were  categorised based on occurrence of 
CRS that required treatment with tocilizumab (n=66) or steroids (n=18), respectively, and subjects who 
experienced CRS  but did not require treatment  with these medications and subjects who did not have 
CRS. All subjects who experienced an sCRS event also required treatment with tocilizumab, and the ER

characterisation for tCRS would therefore be identical to the results of an analysis using a combined CRS 
end point.  Graphical evaluation showed an exposure-response  trend for  AUC0.28d  and Cmax  vs.  tCRS, 
primarily  driven by lower  rates in the first exposure quartile. There appeared to be no further increase 
in  tCRS  rates  in  the higher three  exposure  quartiles.  An  apparent  ER  relationship  for  sCRS  was  also 
observed with  a lower  proportion  of subjects with this adverse event (AE) in the lowest  two  quartiles 
(Q1, Q2); events appeared to plateau in the highest two (Q3, Q4) exposure quartiles.  
For higher grade CRS (Grade ≥ 3), given the limited number of events observed in the study, an 
exposure-response trend was not observed. Neurotoxicity was defined as iiNT. With the limited number 
of these safety events, graphical evaluation of Grade 2 or higher iiNT and iiNT requiring treatment with 
corticosteroids, showed no clear relationship to exposures. Graphical evaluation of thrombocytopenia 
and neutropenia recovery (for subjects who experienced this safety event) showed no apparent 
relationship to exposure. Subsequently, no exposure-response modeling was attempted for higher 
grade CRS, iiNT,  or thrombocytopenia and neutropenia recovery. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Various pharmacodynamics parameters  were explored. The assessments included 
-  Characterisation of immune-related soluble factors (cytokine levels) 
-  Blood and Bone Marrow Analysis for CAR and BCMA. 
- 
Transgene Levels: Transgene levels were determined from DNA in whole blood, blood T cells, 
and bone marrow  to monitor for persistence of vector sequences. 
-  Blood Lymphocyte Subset Analysis: Blood was collected and analysed for immune cell subsets, 
including B cells, natural killer (NK) cells, and T cell subsets. 
-  CAR T Cell Phenotyping, including the analysis of CAR T cell subsets and markers of memory, 
activation, trafficking, and/or markers of T cell exhaustion. 
Cytokine expression and BCMA expression are discussed in this section as pharmacodynamic markers 
of Abecma activity. 
Immune-related Soluble Factors  
The cytolytic mechanism of action of Abecma relies on antigen-dependent activation and proliferation 
of CAR T cells via engagement of BCMA expressed on the cell surface of normal or tumour plasma 
cells. An analysis was conducted to evaluate 27 soluble factors (including markers of inflammation, 
CRP and ferritin) as markers of activation to understand pharmacodynamic changes post Abecma 
infusion. Soluble factors characteristic of T cell activation were induced, with most soluble factors 
showing a dose dependent relationship. Peak elevation of most of the soluble factors was generally 
observed within the first 7 days after Abecma infusion and returned to baseline levels within the first 
month after infusion.  
Increases in interleukin-2 (IL-2), IL-6, interferon- γ (IFN-γ), and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) levels as 
examples are shown in Error!  Reference source not found..  
No significant associations of immune-related soluble factors at screening, or baseline were found 
between subjects with low versus high tumour burden (≥ 50%, < 50% bone marrow  CD138+ 
expression by immunohistochemistry), by tumour BCMA expression level or presence of 
extramedullary plasmacytoma.  Some differences in Cmax concentrations were observed by sBCMA 
levels (higher levels of ferritin and MIP-1α were observed in subjects with high baseline sBCMA and 
higher levels of IL-4 were observed in subjects with low baseline sBCMA).

Page 57/164 
 
 
 
Table 6: Baseline and Cmax IL-2, IL-6, IFN-γ, and TNF Levels Up to Month 1 by Target Dose 
(MM-001 ) 
Cytokine levels and CRS 
Pre-infusion soluble factor levels were investigated for potential prognostic value to subjects 
developing CRS. There was no association of pre-infusion soluble factor levels at screening, at 
baseline, or the fold change between screening/baseline for any grade CRS. 
Ten immune-related soluble factors: GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-13, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, Ang-2, IL-15 and 
IL-2Rα were rapidly induced to significantly higher levels in subjects with any grade CRS (≥ 1) 
compared with subjects with no CRS within the first day after infusion, and 9 factors (all but IL-15) 
remained significantly higher through peak concentration (Cmax). At the time of peak concentrations, 
seven additional soluble factors, including CRP and TNF, were significantly elevated.  
Ang-2 is released upon endothelial cell activation. Post-infusion, the Cmax of Ang-2 (among other 
factors) was associated with CRS requiring tocilizumab or corticosteroids. Ang-2 also trended higher in 
subjects with Grade 1 + 2 (N = 18) iiNT but not Grade ≥ 3 iiN (N = 4), but the low number of patients 
prohibits reliable comparisons. There was no difference in baseline Ang-2 levels based on CRS grade, 
but higher peak levels were seen in patients with Grade ≥3 CRS. The plasma concentration peak was 
observed approximately  two days after ide-cel treatment. Ang-2 levels were similar  in patients with 
grade 0-2 CRS, and small differences and high variation were observed. Only levels in Grade ≥3 CRS 
were clearly higher, but the number of patients is small (n=7) and variation is considerable. Thus, 
Ang-2 plasma levels seem to correlate to CRS severity, but do not appear  to be a useful tool to identify 
patients at high risk of severe CRS. 
Cytokine concentrations and neurotoxicity 
Several soluble factors, reported in literature to correlate with CRS and neurotoxicity, were highly 
induced within 24 hours after Abecma infusion and significantly associated with CRS and iiNT. Early 
Assessment report

post-infusion, GM-CSF, IFN-γ, IL-10, IL-15, IL-2, IL-6, and IL-8 concentration on D1 and the fold 
change between D1/baseline were associated with Grade ≥ 1, Grade ≥ 2, and Grade ≥ 3 investigator 
identified neurotoxicity (iiNT). In addition, the fold change between D1/baseline of IL-13, IL-2Rα,  MIP-
1β, and TNF were also associated with Grade ≥ 1, Grade ≥ 2, and Grade ≥ 3 iiNT.  
Soluble BCMA 
Soluble BCMA is a peripherally accessible biomarker  of myeloma disease burden that correlates with 
the total number of normal and malignant plasma  cells. As a marker of plasma cell abundance, serum 
sBCMA may provide a composite biomarker  of disease burden for patients. Median serum sBCMA levels 
decreased from baseline values following Abecma infusion. Overall, the median concentration over 
time decreased from 276.0 ng/mL at baseline to below LLOQ (4.4 ng/mL) at Month 2; after that time, 
the median concentration remained relatively stable. A summary of levels of circulating sBCMA at 
baseline and over time following Abecma infusion is shown by best response in Figure 17. 
Figure 17: sBCMA median concentration across the target dose levels by best overall 
response over time (MM-001) 
Soluble BCMA concentration at screening, baseline, and nadir were evaluated for non-responders 
versus responders and further compared between non-responders and best overall response of PR, 
VGPR, or ≥ CR. Higher median sBCMA concentrations were observed in non-responders compared to 
responders at screening and baseline, but there was no discreet pre-infusion threshold of sBCMA 
concentration prognostic of nonresponse, and overlap of the quartile ranges were observed. Post-
infusion, minimum median concentration of sBCMA at nadir was below LLOQ in responders (4.40 
ng/mL) compared to non-responders (283.00 ng/mL). 
The association of sBCMA concentration to various factors was studied, and the results can be 
summarised as follows: 
- 
Subjects with low tumour burden had lower levels of pre-infusion sBCMA at screening and 
baseline compared to subjects with high tumour burden. Elimination of sBCMA post-infusion 
was not associated with baseline tumour burden. 
- 
There was no association of pre or post infusion sBCMA levels with low versus high baseline 
BCMA expression on tumour in bone marrow  biopsies, although it should be noted that 
only 3 (2.7%) out of 112 subjects had < 50% CD138+ plasma cells expressing BCMA. 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 59/164 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
Post infusion, subjects with lower baseline sBCMA (< 75th percentile) achieved a minimum 
median concentration to below LLOQ (4.4 ng/mL) at nadir, while subjects with high (≥ 75th 
percentile) sBCMA maintained a measurable level of sBCMA at nadir (25.00 ng/mL). 
- 
Subjects with EMP had higher levels of sBCMA at baseline compared to subjects without EMP 
(p = 0.0339). Post infusion, there was no difference in median sBCMA concentration, as both 
subgroups achieved a minimum  median concentration to below LLOQ (4.4 ng/mL) at nadir. 
Preinfusion sBCMA concentration at screening and baseline were not associated with CRS Grade ≥ 1, 
Grade ≥ 2, or Grade ≥ 3. There was no association of sBCMA levels pre or post infusion with any grade 
iiNT.  
BCMA expression and lack or loss of response 
The status of BCMA target antigen expression, through levels of serum sBCMA as well as by expression 
on CD138+ tumour cells by IHC, was evaluated at time of disease progression to understand the 
prevalence of antigen loss or escape as a mechanism of relapse. 
BCMA expression on CD138+ cells 
Pre-infusion evaluation of tumour-associated BCMA expression was performed by IHC on CD138+ 
MM cells. All subjects demonstrated BCMA expression on CD138+ cells pre-infusion with 97.3% of 
subjects expressing ≥ 50% and the median percentage of CD138+ cells that expressed BCMA being 
100%. Most patients had ≥ 50% of the CD138+ plasma  cells expressing BCMA: 109 (97.3%) out of 
112 baseline bone marrow  biopsies had ≥ 50% CD138+BCMA+ plasma cells and only 3 (2.7%) out of 
112 subjects had < 50% CD138+BCMA+ plasma cells. There was no correlation of percent 
BCMA-expressing CD138+ plasma cells and response, but it should be noted that only three patients 
had BCMA expression on <50%, precluding reliable comparisons. 
Bone marrow  biopsies were evaluated for BCMA expression on CD138+ plasma cells at baseline, post 
infusion, and at the time of disease progression in subjects who achieved PR or ≥ VGPR and had a 
disease progression biopsy available. At baseline 12 out of 12 (100%) bone marrow  biopsies collected 
from subjects who achieved PR, and 11 out of 11 (100%) bone marrow  biopsies collected from 
subjects who achieved ≥ VGPR presented with CD138+ tumour cells that were ≥ 90% positive for 
BCMA expression.  
CD138+ BCMA tumour expression by IHC was available for a total of 38 of the 91 progressing 
subjects. Five patients showed low or no BCMA expression on CD138+ cells at the time of PD, and 
thus, 13% of the patients with evaluable BCMA expression results demonstrated antigen loss.  
Soluble BCMA 
At time of progressive disease, serum soluble BCMA (sBCMA) concentrations were available for 90 of 
91 subjects. sBCMA was measurable in 95.5% (N = 44) of responders compared to 100% (N = 27) of 
non-responders (N = 27). sBCMA was below the LLOQ (4.4 ng/mL) at the time of disease progression 
in 4.5% (N = 2) subjects who achieved a response suggestive of antigen loss.  
Results of the three patients with potential antigen loss are presented in Table 7.

with potential antigen escape (MM-001) 
Loss of antigen expression does not appear to be the principal mechanism for loss of efficacy. 
Mechanism of action 
Abecma is a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-positive T cell therapy targeting B-cell maturation antigen 
(BCMA), which is expressed on the surface of normal and malignant plasma cells. The CAR construct 
includes an anti-BCMA scFv-targeting domain for antigen specificity, a transmembrane domain, a CD3-
zeta T cell activation domain, and a 4-1BB costimulatory domain. Antigen-specific activation of Abecma 
results in CAR-positive T cell proliferation, cytokine secretion and subsequent cytolytic killing of BCMA-
expressing cells. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Bioanalytics 
In  general,  the bioanalytical  methods  to  quantify ide-cel  transgene in  gDNA  and to  detect anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) to the CAR have been appropriately  described and validated at PPD Laboratories, USA, 
according  to  relevant  guidelines.  In  addition  to  the  two  validated  methods,  the  qualification of  an 
ELISPOT  assay  for  determination of cellular  immunogenicity is  presented. The  ELISPOT  assay  data is 
provided as supportive data and not intended to be used to support any clinical claims.  
Pharmacokinetics 
As the treatment consists of modified living cells, the ide-cel PK markedly differs from the PK  of small-
molecule drugs or from  the PK  of monoclonal antibodies. After infusion, the cells start to proliferate  in 
the body and undergo rapid multi-log expansion  (rate  of proliferation  exceeds the rate of cell death), 
which  is  then followed  by  a  bi-exponential  decline(cell death rate  exceeds cell  duplication  rate).  The 
median  time  of  maximal  expansion  in  peripheral  blood  (Tmax)  occurred  11  days after  infusion. The 
expansion phase may  be considered a part  of the “response” and therefore parameters  such as Cmax 
and AUC do not necessarily reflect PK alone; they can be interpreted to reflect PD as well.  Variability  in 
Cmax and AUC is high compared  to  the variability  observed in the respective  parameters  after small-
molecule or monoclonal antibody administration.  
The analytical method measures number of transgene copies in µg of CD3-positive genomic DNA (gDNA). 
The total amount of copies in blood is therefore dependent on the amount of relevant CD3-positive cells,

from which the DNA is extracted. The ide-cel covariate-exposure relationships found thus far have been 
modest compared  to the overall  inter-individual variability.  This suggests that the data transformation 
would likely not significantly improve the power to detect covariate-exposure relationships for ide-cel.  
Dose-proportionality  was  tested by  fitting a  linear  regression model  of  ide-cel  PK  parameters  (Cmax, 
AUC0-28 days,  AUC0-3M,  AUC0-6M  and  AUC0-9M)  as  a  function of  dose.  The  p-value  for  the  slope  of  the 
regression line being other than zero was consistently greater than 0.1. In general, the PK parameters 
(Cmax and AUC) showed dose-related increases in the studied dose range.  
Abecma can persist in peripheral  blood for up to 1 year post-infusion. 
No distribution data were presented in the dossier, and given that the treatment consists of living cells, 
which start to expand immediately upon administration, it would be difficult to study ide-cel distribution 
kinetics of the treatment via traditional compartmental PK modelling methods.  
In 17 study CRB-401 patients who received a second dose of ide-cel, the one-month AUC after the 
second dose was reduced by 21-fold on average, when compared to the values after the first dose. In 
29 study MM-001 patients, the AUC after the second dose was reduced by 6-fold. These data suggest 
that after subjects receive a second infusion, subsequent cellular expansion is substantially limited. 
There was a positive relationship between increasing retreatment baseline sBCMA levels and AUC0-
28days,  but no apparent relationship for Cmax. However, there was no discernible relationship between 
baseline retreatment sBCMA and objective response, but this could be due to the low number of 
retreatment responders (6/29). Subjects were also retreated regardless of ADA status, and it is 
unknown if this affected exposure after the second dose. The proposed SmPC does not propose 
multiple doses of ide-cel, however neither does the SmPC strictly forbid the administration of a second 
dose.  
Overall, it seems that variability is higher at lower doses. In a cross-study comparison, the manufacturing 
process was not found to be a significant predictor of PK parameters Cmax and AUC0-28 days. In study MM-
001, all of the drug product was prepared with the same manufacturing process.  
Coadministration of  tocilizumab  or  corticosteroids  was  associated with  higher  ide-cel exposures.  This 
association can potentially be explained by subjects with higher initial exposures having a greater risk 
of CRS,  which is  treated with tocilizumab  and corticosteroids. Nonetheless, the available  data indicate 
that tocilizumab and corticosteroids at least do not dramatically suppress the ide-cel expansion, and the 
potential effect of immunostimulant G-CSF is not high enough to stand out from the overall variability in 
PK parameters. 
The  applicant  has  performed  analyses  of  dose-exposure,  covariate-exposure,  exposure-efficacy and 
exposure-safety relationships on the basis of data from study MM-001. The data of study CRB-401 are 
only used for external validation. Of these, the exposure-efficacy analyses are not considered particularly 
important.   
The absolute exposure data stratified by dose level showed that body weight was  inversely associated 
with one-month AUC and three-month AUC for 300 x 106, but not the 450 x 106 CAR+T cell target dose. 
The baseline soluble BCMA was positively associated with absolute three-month AUC (but not one-month 
AUC) for both 300 and 450 x 106 dose levels. However, the impact  of these covariates was  modest in 
the  presence  of  high  overall  variability  with  geometric  CV  in  the  range  of  100-500% in  most  PK 
parameters.  While the relationship  with sBCMA  may  theoretically  reflect more  extensive expansion  in 
patients with higher tumour burden, the mechanism by which body weight may  affect exposure  is not 
clear, and it is also unknown why only exposure following 300 x 106 CAR+T doses was affected. Again, 
these effects are considered relatively modest in the context of the overall variability observed in ide-cel 
exposures.      The  available  data  do  not  indicate  that  dose  adjustments  are  necessary  in  specific 
subpopulations.   
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 63/164 
 
 
 
The exposure-efficacy analyses found a positive association between one-month AUC and the response 
variables. The usefulness of this analysis is unclear because the ide-cel expansion, which affects the one-
month  AUC,  may  already  be  considered a  part  of  the “response”,  and therefore  the analysis  may  be 
considered to predict response with another form of response. The exposure-efficacy analyses also found 
that females have a higher overall response rate. Lower serum m-protein levels were predictive of higher 
complete  response rates.  The  models are  descriptive and data-driven, without mechanistic elements, 
and should not be used for prediction or simulation purposes.  
Abecma transgene levels were positively associated with objective tumour response (partial response or 
better). The median Cmax levels in responders (N = 93) were approximately  4.5 fold higher compared 
to the corresponding levels in non-responders (N = 34). Median AUC0-28days in responding patients (N 
= 93) was approximately  5.5 fold higher than non responders (N = 32). 
For  the exposure-safety relationship, the relevant  adverse effect cytokine release syndrome seems  to 
occur during the first days after ide-cel treatment, i.e. before ide-cel Tmax. As such, the exposure-safety 
relationship  uses  exposure  parameters  to  predict  safety  events  that  occur  before  the  exposure 
parameters; future data are used to predict past data. It seems more relevant to assume that the current 
transgene levels  predict  the  risk  of  e.g.  cytokine  release  syndrome  than  to  assume  that  the  future 
transgene levels would predict  the risk.  Therefore,  these apparent  relationships  should be interpreted 
with caution.  
The  proposed  target dose (450 x  106 CART+  cells) is  the highest dose tested in  the pivotal  study. It 
showed overall  greater expansion than the two  lower  doses tested (150 and 300 x 106 cells),  and the 
exposure-efficacy relationship appears  not  to have  achieved plateau  (for the  CR and PFS  end points) 
while  the  exposure-CRS  relationship  appeared  relatively  flat  at  higher expansion values.  Thus,  these 
preliminary analyses support the selection of the highest tested dose as the target dose among the doses 
tested. It is unknown whether a higher dose could have further improved the treatment effect without 
compromising on safety. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Dose-proportional  increases were  observed in concentrations of various soluble  factors and cytokines. 
However, no association with tumour characteristics, and there was no association of pre-infusion soluble 
factors  at  screening  or  baseline  with  response.  No  markers  useful  for  patient  selection  or  tumour 
characterisation were  identified.   Many soluble factors and cytokines reported in literature to correlate 
with CRS and neurotoxicity, were highly induced within 24 hours after Abecma infusion and significantly 
associated with  CRS  and iiNT.  Early  post-infusion, GM-CSF, IFN-γ,  IL-10,  IL-15,  IL-2,  IL-6,  and IL-8 
concentrations were increased. However,  the concentration ranges were largely overlapping in patients 
with and without CRS/NT,  and no  marker  that could be used to identify patients at high risk  of these 
events was identified.  
Soluble BCMA is a peripherally accessible biomarker  of myeloma  disease burden that correlates with the 
total number of normal and malignant plasma cells. Higher median sBCMA concentrations were observed 
in non-responders compared to responders at screening and baseline. Soluble BCMA was not associated 
with tumour characteristics apart from presence of extramedullary plasmacytoma. sBCMA concentration 
at screening and baseline were not associated with CRS Grade ≥ 1, Grade ≥ 2, or Grade ≥ 3. There was 
no association of sBCMA levels pre or post infusion with any grade iiNT. Therefore, sBCMA concentrations 
did not provide significant new information that could guide patient selection or help to identify patients 
at high risk of adverse events (CRS or NT). 
Loss  of detectable levels  of sBCMA in peripheral  blood,  despite  documented disease progression,  was 
reported  in two  patients. This may  indicate loss of target antigen as a  potential mechanism of loss  of 
response.  
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 64/164 
 
 
 
BCMA  was  consistently expressed  on  CD138+ cells,  and in  majority  of  the  patients,  expression  was 
observed  on  ≥50%  of  CD138+  cells  in  the  BM.  The  mean  expression  level  (percentage 
BCMA+CD138+cells) was  91.3% in non-responders and 95.9% in responders at  baseline.  In  patients 
with loss of response (PD), loss of BCMA expression on CD138+ cells was documented in three patients, 
and very low expression (1-5%) in two patients. Due to large proportion  of missing data, loss of BCMA 
expression was thus documented in 5/38 (13%) of patients with evaluable BM samples available.  
The pharmacodynamics markers thus describe the time course of Abecma activation and describe the 
anti-tumour activity of Abecma,  but do not provide tools to guide patient selection, identification of 
high-risk patients in terms of toxicities, or clinically relevant new tools for monitoring Abecma 
treatment.  
Finally, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic data support a dose range of 260 to 500 x 106 CAR 
positive viable T cells. There are tendencies of inferior expansion and PD responses in the limited 
number of patients who received the lowest dose in the pivotal study (150 x 106 cells), conferring 
uncertainty to whether this dose should be used and indeed it has not been included as part of the 
proposed posology range. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions  on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of ide-cel seem to be adequately characterised for the proposed indication. 
Preliminary  exposure-response analyses support the 450 x 106 CAR+ T cell dose and is considered the 
preferred target dose (within a dose range of 260 to  500 x 106 CAR  positive viable T  cells) among the 
doses tested in the pivotal study.  
The available data do not indicate that dose adjustments are necessary in specific subpopulations.  
The pharmacodynamics of Abecma have been adequately characterised. The selected methods are 
considered adequate, and the results demonstrate both induction of cytokine response and anti-tumour 
activity of Abecma. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT assessment regarding the conclusions on the Clinical pharmacology as 
described above.  
2.5.  Clinical  efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
The CRB-401 study is described in more detail under supportive studies. A brief summary is provided 
below. 
Study CRB-401 was a 2-part, nonrandomised, open-label, multicentre, dose escalation plus dose 
expansion cohort study of ide-cel in subjects with RRMM. The study was ongoing at the data cutoff 
date (22 Jul 2019) with enrolment complete.  
Part A (3+3 dose escalation) was designed to determine the maximum  tolerated dose (MTD) of ide-cel, 
and to select a recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D). Part A enrolled RRMM subjects with ≥50% BCMA 
expression, who had received at least 3 different prior  lines of therapy, including an 
immunomodulatory agent and a PI, or were double-refractory to both classes of drugs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021

Part B was designed to confirm the safety of the doses chosen in Part A, and enrolled RRMM subjects 
with previous exposure to an immunomodulatory agent, a PI, and daratumumab, and who were 
refractory (based on IMWG criteria) to their last line of therapy.

Results 
Part A: A total of 24 subjects were enrolled and 21 subjects received ide-cel at a target dose of 50 (N 
= 3), 150 (N = 6), 450 (N = 9), or 800 (N = 3) x 106 CAR+ T cells (± 20% of the respective target 
dose as allowed per the study protocol). 
The safety review committee (SRC) met on 16 Jun 2017 to review the available safety and efficacy 
data from Part A and to select the Abecma doses (ie, RP2D) for Part B of the study based upon an 
overall risk-benefit assessment. 
Efficacy data from Part A of the study were summarised using a data cutoff date of 4 May 2017. As of 
this date, 18 of the 21 Abecma  infused subjects had completed their first 4-week tumour assessment 
and were evaluable for response. 
The SRC declared the dose range of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells as the RP2D for further testing, 
based on the following key findings: 
• 
Only 1 transient PR was observed at a target dose of 50×106 CAR+ T cells and all 3 subjects in 
this dose cohort had progressive disease. In addition, CAR+ T cell expansion was lower at this 
target dose. Therefore, the 50×106 CAR+ T cells dose was considered a suboptimal dose. 
• 
Among the 15 evaluable subjects treated with ide-cel target doses ≥ 150×106 CAR+ T cells, 
the ORR was 100% (95% CI: 78, 100) and no subjects had shown disease progression after a 
follow-up period ranging from 8 to 54 weeks.

• 
One out of the 3 subjects with low tumour burden had a Grade 3 CRS event at the highest ide-
cel target dose of 800 x 106 CAR+ T cells. 
Part B: Part B included 3 cohorts, using two different manufacturing processes. Cohort 3 was added 
through a Protocol Amendment (v. 5.0, dated 09 May 2018) to evaluate ide-cel CAR+ T cells at the 
450 x 106 dose-level, using the updated manufacturing process. Across the three cohorts, a total of 43 
subjects were enrolled and 41 subjects received ide-cel at the target dose levels of 150 x 106 (N=12) 
and 450 × 106 (N=29) CAR+ T cells (± 20%).

Note: One  subject dosed at 205  × 106 CAR+  T cells in  Part B Cohort 1 and  1 subject dosed at 305  × 106  CAR+ T 
cells  in  Part B Cohort  3 are included  under  the target dose of  450  × 106  CAR+ T cells. 
After 18 Oct 2017, an updated manufacturing process was implemented in both CRB-401 and MM-001 
studies. Given the lack of clinical experience with this updated manufacturing process, the dose range 
for initiation of the MM-001 study was determined at 150 to 300 x 106 CAR+ T cells, with the intent of 
treating 80 subjects. Based on an emerging dose response relationship observed in the CRB-401 study 
and acceptable ongoing safety at both the 150 and 300 x 106 target dose levels in MM-001, the dose 
range in MM-001 was subsequently modified to a dose range of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells along 
with an expansion of the total sample size, with the intent of targeting the remaining subjects at 450 x 
106 CAR+ T cells.

Methods 
Study MM-001 was an open-label, single-arm, multicentre, multinational, Phase 2 study to evaluate 
the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in subjects with RRMM who had received at least 3 prior regimens 
including an immunomodulatory agent, a PI, and an anti-CD38 antibody, and who were refractory to 
their last prior  treatment regimen. The study consisted of 3 stages: pretreatment (screening, 
leukapheresis, and bridging therapy [if administered]), treatment (lymphodepleting chemotherapy 
[LDC] and ide-cel infusion) and posttreatment (post-ide-cel infusion) (ongoing). Ide-cel was 
administered across a dose range of 150, 300 and 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells.

9. 
Subjects with second malignancies in addition to myeloma if the second malignancy had 
required therapy in the last 3 years or was not in complete remission. 
Treatments 
The ide-cel pre-treatment/treatment phase included leukapheresis, bridging chemotherapy (optional) 
and lymphodepletion chemotherapy (LDC). Retreatment with ide-cel could be considered after disease 
progression. 
Leukapheresis 
Manufacturing slots for ide-cel product generation were allocated to the study sites prior to subject 
leukapheresis. Once screening eligibility was met, subjects were enrolled and a leukapheresis collection 
was performed. Subjects who had a product manufacturing failure or a product manufactured with a 
dose of less than 150 x 106 CAR+ T cells could proceed to a second leukapheresis procedure for a 
second attempt at ide-cel manufacturing. 
Bridging therapy 
Per investigator discretion, subjects could receive bridging therapy for myeloma disease control while 
ide-cel was being manufactured, as long as the last dose of bridging therapy was administered ≥ 14 
days prior  to the initiation of LDC. Bridging therapies could include corticosteroids, alkylating agents, 
immunomodulatory agents, PIs, and/or anti-CD38 antibodies as single agents or in combination. 
Experimental agents and myeloma  therapies to which the subject had not been previously exposed 
were not to be used as bridging therapy. A new baseline evaluation including disease restaging was 
performed within 72 hours of initiating LDC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 69/164 
 
 
 
Lymphodepletion 
Subjects received a conditioning regimen consisting of IV cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 and 
fludarabine 30 mg/m2 given concurrently in a 3-day cycle starting 5 days prior  to ide-cel infusion. 
To be eligible to start LDC patients were required to have adequate renal, hepatic and BM function, 
International normalized ratio (INR) and PTT ≤ 1.5 x upper limit normal (ULN), no active urinary 
outflow obstruction, no presence of active infections and no intercurrent illness or toxicity that would 
place the subject at undue risk.  
Ide-cel treatment 
Ide-cel was administered IV on Day 04 (+ 7-day window) at a target dose of 150, 300, or 450 x 106 
CAR+ T cells/infusion, corresponding to 133, 260 and 420 x 106 viable cells. The maximum dose (540 
x 106 CAR+ T cells) was defined by the upper limit of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells plus 20%, as detailed in 
the study protocol.  The target dose was modified to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells starting with Protocol 
Amendment 2.0. 
To proceed with ide-cel infusion, subjects must not have had a significant worsening in clinical status 
compared to initial eligibility criteria, suspected or active systemic infection, onset of fever (≥ 38ºC) not 
related to underlying disease, requirement for supplemental oxygen, uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmias, 
hypotension requiring vasopressor support, new onset or worsening of nonhematological dysfunction ≥ 
Grade 3 and in subjects taking any prohibited medications. If infusion could not occur by Day 7, 
subjects could receive ide-cel infusion following a second round of LDC after a minimum of 4 weeks 
from last LDC. 
Retreatment 
Subjects were eligible to receive a second infusion of ide-cel if there was evidence of disease 
progression (according to the IMWG criteria), at least 8 weeks had passed since the first ide-cel 
infusion and the best response to initial ide-cel infusion was stable disease (SD) or better. 
Starting with protocol Amendment 4.0, retreatment required sufficient cryopreserved ide-cel drug 
product to be available (i.e. re-manufacture of ide-cel from cryopreserved PBMCs and repeat 
leukapheresis was not allowed). Furthermore, starting with protocol Amendment 4.0 (see Section 
9.8.1), there was no drug class restriction for bridging therapy used prior  to retreatment, but bridging 
therapy was to be completed at least 14 days prior to start of LDC 
Prohibited medications 
Systemic steroids were not allowed unless used for the treatment of CRS or neurotoxicity. Therapeutic 
doses of corticosteroids (> 20 mg/day prednisone or equivalent) were allowed within 72 hours prior to 
LDC. Therapeutic doses of steroids may be used in life-threatening situations and for other medical 
conditions when indicated, or after loss of detectable bb2121 cells. 
Any systemic MM therapy within 14 days prior  to leukapheresis and within 14 days of LDC was 
prohibited. As was any concurrent chemotherapy, immunotherapy, biologic, experimental or hormonal 
therapy following bb2121 infusion (follow-up period) for treatment of MM prior  to documentation of PD.  
Live vaccines during and for 3 months following fludarabine treatment was also not allowed. 
Objectives 
The primary  objective was to evaluate the efficacy, defined as ORR of ide-cel in subjects with RRMM. 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 70/164 
 
 
 
The secondary objectives included the assessment of safety, as well as the evaluation of additional 
efficacy outcomes, including CR rate, time to response (TTR), DoR, PFS, time to progression (TTP), 
minimal residual disease (MRD), OS and changes in health-related quality of life (HRQoL). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary  Endpoint  
Overall Response Rate (ORR), defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved partial response 
(PR) or better (stringent CR (sCR) + CR + VGPR + PR) as assessed by an Independent Response 
Committee (IRC) according to International IMWG response criteria (Kumar,  2016). The primary 
efficacy analysis was conducted based on the mITT  (infused) patient population.  
Secondary Endpoints 
•  Complete response (CR) rate (key secondary) defined as the percentage of subjects who 
achieved CR or sCR as assessed by the IRC according to IMWG response criteria (Kumar, 
2016). 
• 
Time to response (TTR) defined as the time from ide-cel infusion to the first date of 
documented response (PR or better).  
•  Duration of response (DoR) defined as the time from the date of the first documented response 
(PR or better) to the first documentation of PD or death, whichever was earlier. 
• 
• 
Progression-free survival (PFS) defined as the time from ide-cel infusion to the first date of 
documented PD or death from any cause during the study, whichever occurred earlier. 
Time to progression (TTP) defined as time from ide-cel infusion to the first documented 
progression. 
•  Overall survival (OS) defined as time from ide-cel infusion to death due to any cause. 
•  Minimal residual disease (MRD) in the BM defined as the proportion of subjects who achieved ≥ 
CR and MRD-negative status at any timepoint within 3 months prior  to achieving ≥ CR until the 
time of PD/death, using a sensitivity level of 10-5 nucleated cells. 
•  Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) defined as changes over time in European Organization 
for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC)-QLQ-C30, European Quality of Life-5 
Dimensions health state classifier to 5 levels (EQ-5D-5L), and EORTC-QLQ-MY20. 
Randomisation  Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
For the primary  efficacy endpoint, ORR, the sample size was based on one sample binomial test with 
normal approximation.  The null hypothesis to be tested was that the ORR (defined as the proportion  of 
subjects with at least a PR based on all bb2121 treated subjects) was ≤ 50%; the alternative 
hypothesis was that the ORR is > 50%, with a target ORR of 70%. With these hypotheses, a sample 
size of 119 bb2121-Treated subjects would provide more than 99% power at a one-sided 0.025 alpha 
Assessment report

Page 71/164 
 
 
 
 
level. This criterion required that the lower limit of the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for the ORR was 
greater than 50%. Assuming a dropout rate of 15% between the time of study enrollment and bb2121 
infusion, a total number of up to 140 could be enrolled.  
The selection of a null hypothesis of 50% ORR was based on the observed clinical activity of the best 
available single agent therapy in a heavily pretreated RRMM patient population. Daratumumab 
demonstrated a response rate ranging from 29% to 36% in RRMM patients who had received at least 3 
prior  lines of therapy including an immunomodulatory drug (IMiD) and a proteasome inhibitor (PI) or 
who were double refractory. The null hypothesis of 50% ORR represented an approximately  50% 
improvement  over daratumumab. The target ORR of 70% was based on the preliminary  efficacy 
observed with bb2121 in the Phase 1 study, including an ORR of 81% in 36 evaluable patients 
receiving bb2121 doses of 150 - 800 x 106 CAR+ T cells. A target ORR of 70% was considered 
achievable based on the existing clinical efficacy data with bb2121 and also represented an 
approximately  100% improvement over daratumumab.  
If the ORR was tested positive, CR rate (CRR) would be tested using a stepdown approach to control 
the overall alpha level, which remained at the one-sided 0.025 level. For CR rate, the null hypothesis 
was ≤ 10%, with a target CR rate of 20%. The null hypothesis of 10% CRR represented an 
approximately  100% improvement over daratumumab, and the target of 20% CRR was considered 
clinically meaningful. With these hypotheses, also using one-sample binomial test, the same sample 
size of 119 bb2121 treated subjects would provide approximately  89% power at a one-sided 0.025 
alpha level. This criterion required that the lower limit of the two-sided 95% CIs for the CR rate was 
greater than 10%. 
Subgroup analyses 
Subgroup analyses were performed where an adequate number of subjects were available in each 
subgroup to allow for meaningful interpretation of results. Analyses were performed within a number of 
subgroups described further in the Results section. 
ORR, CR rate, and DOR were evaluated for each subgroup. The exact 95% CI (Clopper-Pearson) was 
provided for ORR and CRR together with the forest plot for ORR and CRR. 
Subgroup analyses for the following subgroups could be performed for PFS: 
• 
bb2121 target dose level (150, 300, and 450x106 cells), Bridging anti-MM therapies (Yes, no), 
Prior anti-myeloma regimen per year (≤ 1 per year, > 1 per year). 
•  Subgroup analysis by bb2121 target dose level (150, 300, and 450x106 cells) were also 
performed for OS. 
Adjustment for Multiplicity 
A stepdown procedure was used to control the family-wise Type I error rate. The primary  efficacy 
endpoint ORR was tested first. The key secondary efficacy endpoint CR rate was only to be tested if the 
test of primary  efficacy endpoint was positive. There was no adjustment for multiplicity for other 
secondary or exploratory endpoints. 
Interim analyses 
There was no planned interim analysis. The primary  analysis for efficacy and safety was to be 
performed at approximately  10 months after last subject was infused with bb2121 (approximately  9 
months after the first response assessment) to allow for sufficient follow-up time. The hypothesis 
testing for the primary  and key secondary endpoints were based on the analysis at this timepoint. In 
addition to analysis at the specified time point of 10 months post last infusion, analyses (including 
those on the primary  and secondary endpoints) could be performed at other time points as needed, 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 72/164 
 
 
 
and an updated analysis will be performed at 24 months after the last subject has received bb2121 
infusion. Such additional analyses may not be used for decision making or conclusion for the trial, and 
therefore no alpha adjustment was made.  
Censoring 
Censoring rules based on FDA and EMA guidance for cancer trial endpoints were applied for PFS. The 
PFS analysis based on the FDA censoring rules was considered as primary.  Additional sensitivity 
analyses could be performed to account for other scenarios as appropriate.  PFS was summarised for 
the bb2121-Treated population using KM statistics. The median PFS along with the two-sided 95% CI 
for the median was estimated. In addition, the event-free rates at specific time-points was computed. 
PFS for Enrolled population was also analyzed. For this analysis, PFS started from the date of the 
enrollment (i.e.,  leukapheresis). For enrolled but not bb2121-Treated population, the censoring rules 
remained the same, except for subjects enrolled but not treated with bb2121, if there is no response 
assessment or documented event after enrollment, they were to be censored at the date of 
leukapheresis instead of date of bb2121 infusion. For enrolled and bb2121-Treated population, the 
event/censoring date was the same as bb2121- Treated population, just changed to the start date to 
be leukapheresis date instead of bb2121 infusion date.

Of the 158 screened patients, 140 patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria and were enrolled (underwent 
leukapheresis). As of the data cutoff date 16 October 2019 for the primary  analysis, a total of 128 
subjects received ide-cel infusion and 70 (54.7%) of these subjects were ongoing in the study.  
As latest data cut off of 7 Apr 2020, 55 (39.3%) of subjects had died and 58 (41.4%) were still 
ongoing in study without an event, 23 were withdrawn whereof 21 still in follow-up for OS, and 4 were 
lost to follow- up.  
Recruitment 
Study initiation date was 16 Oct 2017 (first subject first visit). First subject was enrolled 03 Jan 2018 
(leukapheresis) and last subject’s first infusion was 20 Dec 2018. DCO date for the primary  analysis

was 16 Oct 2019 (the study is ongoing). The study is conducted at 20 sites (9 in the United States, 1 
in Canada, 2 in Spain, 2 in Italy, 3 in Germany, 2 in France, and 1 in Belgium).  
Conduct of the study 
Summary of main protocol amendments 
The original protocol dated 25 Aug 2017 was amended 4 times prior to the data cutoff date of 16 Oct 
2019. Protocol Amendment 1.0, dated 09 Nov 2017 was implemented prior to enrolment of any study 
subjects.  
A summary of the key changes implemented with the remaining three amendments is described 
below: 
Protocol Amendment 2.0, dated 14 Jun 2018 
This amendment was implemented to 1) increase the ide-cel dose range, 2) increase the sample size, 
3) modify the ide-cel overdose definition, and 4) incorporate feedback from health authorities: 
• 
The dose range was expanded from 300 x 106 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, based on the 
preliminary  safety and efficacy results observed in the ide-cel Phase 1 Study CRB-401, suggesting a 
dose response across the 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cell dose range. 
• 
Sample size was increased to allow up to 140 subjects to be enrolled with up to 119 subjects 
treated with ide-cel.  
• 
The protocol definition of overdose for ide-cel was changed from > 10% to > 20% of the 
protocol-specified dose. 
• 
Incorporation of feedback received from health authorities in order to clarify selected screening 
exclusion and LDC criteria.  
• 
The option for repeat leukapheresis was removed due to the risk of repeat transduction of 
bb2121 CAR+ T cells in the manufacture of bb2121 product from a repeat leukapheresis for subjects 
considering re-treatment. 
Protocol Amendment 3.0, dated 28 Sep 2018 
Amendment was implemented in response to a death within 28 days of ide-cel infusion in Study MM-
001 to provide further guidance on intercurrent illness or toxicity that is considered to place the 
subject at undue risk of proceeding to ide-cel infusion and for which ide-cel infusion should be delayed.  
Protocol Amendment 4.0, dated 18 Jul 2019 
Amendment was implemented primarily  to change the MRD assessment by EuroFlow from a secondary 
objective and endpoint to an exploratory objective and endpoint.  
Important protocol deviations are summarised in Table 9.

Bridging Antimyeloma Therapies; 
The majority of subjects (87.5%) received bridging therapy for myeloma  control during the ide-cel 
manufacturing period, with the most common therapies being corticosteroids (73.4%), PIs (42.2%), 
alkylating agents (40.6%), monoclonal antibodies (29.7%) and immunomodulatory agents (22.7%). 
The mean treatment duration of bridging therapy (N=112) was 12.8 days (SD 6.02) with a median of 
14.5 days (range 1-33). 
Of the 112 subjects in the ide-cel-treated population who received bridging therapy, 5 subjects had an 
unconfirmed response to bridging therapy of PR (4 subjects) or VGPR (1 subject) based on investigator 
assessment. A total of 6 (4.7%) subjects overall no longer had measurable disease at baseline prior  to 
LDC.  
Post-ide-cel infusion, these subjects were to be assessed by the IRC only for at least a CR or disease 
progression in accordance with IMWG 2016 guidelines. 
Lymphodepletion Chemotherapy 
In the ide-cel treated population all the subjects (128) were dosed with fludarabine for 3 days, with a 
median daily dose of 29.5 mg/m2 received (range: 17.8 to 31.9). All subjects were dosed with 
cyclophosphamide for 3 days, with a median daily dose of 298.6 mg/m2 received (range: 274 to 
318.9). 
Ide-cel Infusion 
All ide-cel-treated subjects received an actual dose between 150.5 and 518.4 x 106 CAR+ T cells, 
which was within the allowance of 20% over the target dose of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells (ie, less than 
540 x 106 CAR+ T cells). The median time from leukapheresis to ide-cel administration was 40 days 
(range 33-79 days), with a median time from leukapheresis to product release of 32 days (range 24-
55 days) and time from product release to ide-cel administration of 7 days (range 5-44 days).

be considered the primary  efficacy analyses. 
Outcomes  and estimation 
The primary  analysis was performed using a data cutoff date of 16 October 2019, which is 
approximately  10 months after the last subject was infused with Abecma.  Data from later data cut-off’s 
i.e. 14 Jan 2020 and 7 Apr  2020, were also provided. 
As of the 16 Oct 2019 data cutoff date, the median duration of follow-up after ide-cel infusion, which 
includes duration up to death for subjects who died and duration up to last date known alive for 
surviving subjects, was 11.3 months (range: 0.2, 18.6), with 54 (42.2%) subjects having been 
followed for ≥ 12 months from infusion. The median follow-up durations were 17.8 months, 13.9 
months, and 9.7 months in subjects who received target doses of 150, 300, and 450 x 106 CAR+ T 
cells, respectively. 
At the time of the 7 April 2020 data cut-off, the median duration of follow-up was 15.4 months for the 
whole study population. By dose level, the patients who received 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells had the 
shortest follow-up time (15.0 months). 
Primary  efficacy endpoint - ORR 
The ORR in the enrolled population was 67.1% (95% CI: 59.4, 74.9) (p < 0.0001) across the target 
dose levels of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells. At the later data cut-off’s i.e. 14 Jan 2020 and 7 Apr 
2020 (table 17) there was no change in ORR in the enrolled population relative to the 16 Oct 2019 
data cutoff. 
Complete response (CR) (key secondary) and Very good partial response (VGPR) 
In the enrolled population 28.6% (40/140, 95% CI: 21.1, 36.1) of subjects achieved a response of CR 
or better and 47.1% of subjects achieved a response of VGPR or better.  At the 7 April  2020 data cutoff 
the CR rate (CR or better) increased to 30.0% (95% CI: 22.4, 37.6) (table 17).  
The response rates were consistent based on investigator assessments: ORR was 69.3% (95% CI: 
61.6, 76.9), and 29.3% of patients achieved a response of CR or better in the enrolled population.

At the updated data cut-off’s (14 Jan 2020 and 7 Apr 2020), results were similar,  with 2 additional 
subjects, both at the target dose of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, achieving MRD-negative status and ≥ CR 
(25.8%) (table 17). 
Time to Response 
Median TTR based on IRC according to IMWG Criteria was 1.0 months (range 0.5 – 8.8 months), with 
96.8% of patients responding within the first two months of infusion.  
Duration of Response 
As of the 16 Oct 2019 data cutoff date, the median duration of follow-up after ide-cel infusion for all 
ide-cel-treated subjects was 11.3 months (range: 0.2, 18.6), increasing to 13.3 months (range: 0.2, 
21.2) at the data cutoff 14 Jan 2020. The median follow-up durations were 18.0, 15.8, and 12.4 
months in subjects who received target doses of 150, 300, and 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, respectively. 
As of the DCO date 16 Oct 2019 the KM estimate for median DoR among responders was 10.5 months 
(95% CI: 8.0, 11.3) with only a minor change at the data cut off 07 Apr 2020 (Error!  Reference 
source not found.5). 
Applying FDA censoring rules showed similar results to the analyses applying EMA censoring rules.

Progression-Free Survival 
In the enrolled population PFS was calculated from enrolment (i.e. date of leukapheresis). At the 16 
Oct 2019 data cutoff the median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI: 6.7, 12.0), across the target dose 
levels of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+T cells.

Data cut–off 7 Apr2020 
At the 07 Apr  2020 data cutoff date, 105 (75.0%) of subjects had progressed/died and 35 (25.0%) 
were censored. The most common reason for censoring was that subjects were ongoing without an 
event at the data cutoff date 29 (20.7%) subjects and 6 (4.3%) had discontinued in the study without 
progression/death.

Note: Overall survival was m easured from the day of infusion for the ide-cel-treated population and from the day of enrolment (ie, 
leukapheresis) for the enrolled population. 
At the latest data cut off 07 Apr  2020, with a median follow-up time for all surviving subjects of 17.0 
months, the reported median OS in the enrolled population was 21.4 months (95% CI: 19.3, NE); 
39.3% of subjects had died and 85 (60.7%) were censored . The estimated survival rate at 18 months 
from leukapheresis was 64%. 
Figure 25: Kaplan-Meier Curve of Overall Survival (Enrolled Population) 
Data cut-off 7 Apr  2020 
The most common reason for censoring was that subjects were ongoing without an event at the data 
cutoff date i.e 58 (41.4%). A total of 23 patients were withdrawn from the study (subject decision or 
physician), whereof 21 patients were still in follow-up for OS. In addition to the 23 withdrawn patients 
4 were lost to follow-up. 
Patients retreated with ide-cel 
Of the 128 subjects who received ide-cel treatment, 31 (24.2%) were screened for retreatment and 29 
subjects received ide-cel retreatment (07 April  2020 data cutoff date). 
During ide-cel manufacture for retreatment, 6 (20.7%) of the 29 subjects who received ide-cel 
retreatment received bridging therapy for myeloma  control prior  to their repeat course of LDC before 
ide-cel retreatment. Of the 29 subjects who received retreatment, 28 had a target dose of 450 x 106 
CAR+ T cells and 1 had a target dose of 300 x 106 CAR+ T cells for their second ide-cel infusion. 
The ORR for retreated subjects based on investigator assessment was 20.7% (N=6, 95% CI: 8.0, 
39.7), of which 5 patients achieved a best overall response of PR (17.2%) and one patient achieved a 
best overall response of VGPR (3.4%). All patients who achieved a response were ADA negative before 
retreatment (6/12 ADA negative patients) while none of the 17 ADA positive patients achieved a 
response.

As of the 07 Apr 2020 data cutoff date, all of the twenty-nine (29) ide-cel-retreated subjects had a PFS 
event after ide-cel retreatment (28 subjects progressed and 1 died). The KM estimate for median PFS 
starting from time of retreatment was 1.0 month (95% CI: 0.95, 1.97).  
Subsequent antimyeloma therapies 
As of the 16 Oct 2019 data cutoff date, 56 (43.8%) subjects received subsequent AMT (including ide-
cel retreatment, bridging AMT for retreatment,  or LDC prior  to retreatment). The KM estimate for 
median time to subsequent AMT was 13.2 months (95% CI: 10.9, 15.1). Eight (14.3%) of the 56 
subjects in the treated population who received subsequent AMT had a reported response of PR or 
better on subsequent AMT. 
HRQoL 
Patient-reported outcomes was assessed in the MM-001 study by the EORTC QLQ-C30, the EQ-5D-5L 
and the EORTC QLQ-MY20 instruments.  
Results are reported until Month 15 since few subjects (>10) had responded to the questionnaires 
after Month 15 (16 Oct 2019 data cutoff). Only five domains from the EORTC QLQ-C30 (Fatigue, Pain, 
Physical Functioning, Cognitive Functioning, and Global Health/QoL) and two subscales of the EORTC 
QLQ-MY20 (Disease Symptoms  and Side Effects) were analysed. The minimal important difference 
(MID) for mean changes from baseline was predefined for each subscale, based on the 
recommendation from the published literature (Cocks, 2012 1). 
For the EORTC QLQ-C30 Fatigue and Pain subscales clinically meaningful decreases (improvement) in 
mean scores from baseline to Month 9 were seen. Both in the EORTC QLQC30 Physical Functioning 
Subscale and in the Global Health/QoL domain a clinically meaningful increase (improvement) in mean 
score from baseline were seen. For the EORTC QLQ-MY20 Side Effects subscale scores a gradual 
increase (deterioration) in mean scores was observed from baseline to Month 9 but increases were not 
statistically significant nor clinically meaningful. In the EORTC QLQ-MY20 Disease Symptoms  Subscale 
scores small clinically meaningful decreases (improvements) were observed from baseline to Months 4 
through 15 posttreatment. The EORTC QLQ-C30 Cognitive Functioning subscale scores generally 
demonstrated stability from baseline to Month 9 and beyond with baseline mean scores close to that of 
the general population. 
The applicant has compared the baseline scores on the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQMY20 domains 
only with the scores for the general population (Nolte, 2019 2). Since no data for comparison of HRQoL 
in RRMM patient treated with standard of care is provided, contextualisation of the HRQoL data based 
on this single arm study is limited. 
Ancillary analyses 
Exploratory Multivariable Analysis for Efficacy 
Baseline and disease characteristics identified as potential prognostic factors for response (ORR and CR 
rate), DoR, and PFS were investigated in exploratory regression analyses, including the effect of ide-cel 
dose on efficacy endpoints after controlling for some baseline variables.  Contrasting results were 
observed on the potential roles of some baseline characteristics across the different endpoints. In

particular, a number of prognostic factors seem to have an impact on dose-effect, albeit any significant 
interactions between these baseline covariates and dose effect uncovered by the multivariate modeling 
tools may be of little statistical meaning due to multiplicity issues and small sample sizes. Overall, the 
relationship between dose and efficacy endpoints may be considered robust.  
Comparison of Ide-cel to Real World Evidence: Study NDS-MM-003 
NDS-MM-003: A global, non-interventional, retrospective, multi-center study to generate 
real-world evidence of subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma with prior 
exposure to an anti-CD38 antibody  
Study NDS-MM-003 was a global, non-interventional, retrospective study set up to generate an 
external comparison arm for study MM-001. Data from sources including clinical sites, registries, and 
research databases were collated in a single data model, and further analysed.  
The patient eligibility period started in November  2015 and ended in September 2018. A data cutoff 
date of 30 Oct 2019 was used for the collection of the RW data. 
Methods  
Subject-level data were collected on 1949 RW subjects who had RRMM and who had received at least 3 
prior  regimens, including an immunomodulatory agent, a PI, and an anti-CD38 antibody (Broad RRMM 
cohort). From this cohort, subjects were subsequently selected based on having met eligibility criteria 
for Study MM-001 as closely as possible,  including initiation of a new therapy after becoming refractory 
to the last regimen and lack of co- morbidities. Subject selection based on these criteria identified 190 
subjects (eligible RRMM cohort) with similar characteristics to the MM-001 population.

Figure 26: Construction of the RWD cohort 
Primary Objectives 
• 
Describe demographic and selected clinical characteristics of RW subjects with RRMM who 
received at least 3 prior myeloma  regimens, including a PI, an immunomodulatory agent, and an anti-
CD38 antibody (RRMM cohort). 
• 
Describe demographics, disease characteristics, treatment patterns, and clinical outcomes of 
the above RW subjects and for the cohort of RW subjects who met eligibility criteria for Study MM 001 
(Eligible RRMM cohort). 
Endpoints 
The primary  endpoint was ORR,  which was defined as the percentage of subjects who achieved a 
partial response (PR) or better.  A PR was defined according to IMWG uniform response criteria for MM. 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 93/164 
 
 
 
 
The secondary endpoints were VGPR rate, CR rate, TTR,  DoR, OS and PFS. 
Endpoints were calculated relative to each subject’s baseline date (T0) defined as the date that the 
subject becomes refractory to the last regimen with refractory defined as documented PD during or 
within 60 days (measured from the last dose) of completing treatment with the last regimen of 
antimyeloma drug therapy before study entry. The index date (Study Day 1) was the start date of the 
first AMT after T0. 
The ORR was calculated as the percentage of subjects who achieved PR or better according to the 
(IMWG Criteria) following the first treatment after baseline (T0).  
The comparison of ORR for the Balanced RRMM cohort to the BB2121-MM-001 cohort was based on the 
relative risk regression with adjustment for confounding using PS produced with stabilised inverse 
probability  of treatment weights (IPTW) for each balanced imputed dataset. 
Other secondary endpoints were also analyzed (VGPR, OS, TTR and DoR, PFS). No safety data were 
collected. 
Propensity score methods 
Propensity score (PS) methodology was used to ensure that RW subjects in the Eligible RRMM cohort 
were comparable  to the ide-cel cohort 
The selected cohort of 190 RW subjects for the Eligible RRMM cohort provided an adequate match for 
only about 80 subjects in the Abecma  cohort. As a result, the primary  analysis method had to be 
changed. Trimmed  stabilised IPTW was used as the primary  analysis method for the effectiveness 
endpoints and are the data presented throughout this report. Matched-pair and untrimmed stabilised 
IPTW analyses were utilised as supporting analyses. 
Covariates considered included age, sex, bone lesions, time from initial diagnosis, number of prior 
regimens, cytogenetic high risk/low risk, refractory to immunomodulatory agents, refractory to PI, 
refractory to anti-CD38 antibody, and baseline lab tests (platelet, hemoglobin, albumin, and calcium). 
As a conservative measure, the analysis allowed for as much as 30% missing data for highly 
prognostic covariates in the Eligible RRMM cohort. Covariates considered very important predictors of 
outcome by the scientific steering committee (ie, age, albumin, number of prior  regimens) were forced 
into the model irrespective of a lack of association with group membership. 
PSs were calculated on subject-level data to summarise the impact of covariates on treatment 
selection into a scalar value. These PS values were then used, through weighting individual subjects 
both in the Eligible RRMM cohort and the respective ide-cel cohort. 
Results 
In the Eligible RRMM cohort, the median duration of follow-up for all treated subjects, which includes 
duration up to death for subjects who died and duration up to last date known alive for surviving 
subjects, was 10.2 months (range: 0.2 to 24.0), as of the 30 Oct 2019 data cutoff date. 
Compared to the ide-cel cohort, patients in the Eligible RRMM cohort (n=190) were older (median age: 
64.0 vs. 60.5 years), somewhat less heavily pre-treated (median number of prior  AMTs 5.0 vs. 6.0 and 
proportion  of patients with at least one prior  ASCT 70.5% vs. 93.8%) and had a lower degree of 
refractoriness to prior  AMTs (53.7% vs. 89.1% were double-class refractory).  
The eligible RRMM cohort were treated with currently available therapies as the next-line study 
treatment which typically consisted of combinations of immunomodulatory agents, PIs, monoclonal 
antibodies, corticosteroids, and cytotoxic agents. There were more  than 90 different regimens and 
74.7% were able to receive 3 or more drug combinations as their index therapy.

Based on the logistic regression equation, covariates that needed to be included in the stabilised 
inverse probability  weighting and in the matched analysis are summarised in Table 18.  
Table 18: Summary of Covariate Balance Adjusted for Trimmed Stabilised Inverse 
Probability of Treatment Weighting of Eligible RRMM and Ide-cel Cohorts 
PI = proteasome inhibitor; RRMM = relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma; RW = real-world. 
Notes: Multiple imputation procedures created 30 datasets. Overall estimates were obtained using Rubin’s rules to combine the 
individual estimates. Means are presented for continuous variables and proportions are presented for categorical variables. 
Standardised mean difference was obtained from the ide-cel cohort m inus the Eligible RRMM cohort and used trimmed stabilised 
weights when combining the mean and standard deviation.A covariate was not included in the balancing if the covariate had more 
than 30% m issing for the Eligible RRMM cohort. The stabilised inverse probability treatment weighting was trimmed at the maximum 
of the m inimum weight and the m inimum of the maximum weight for the ide-cel cohort and the Eligible RRMM cohort. 
ORR and VGPR 
A summary of ORR and VGPR rate adjusted for trimmed stabilised IPTW for subjects in the Eligible 
RRMM and ide-cel enrolled cohorts (Data cut off 16 Oct 2019) is presented in Table 19.

a Index date for ORR was start of new therapy for Eligible RRMM cohort and start of leukapheresis for ide-cel cohort.,b 2-sided 95% 
CI,c Relative risk, p-value, and CI are based on a Poisson regression with robust error variance, adjusted for theunbalanced 
covariates in the propensity score model. The primary analysis used a log link function and stabilisedIPTWs trimmed at the 
m axim um of the minimum weight and the minimum of the maximum weight for the ide-cel cohort and Eligible RRMM cohort. 
Note: Overall response rate: Rate of subjects who achieved a best response of partial response (PR) or better. VGPR or better 
response rate: Rate of subjects who achieved a best response of VGPR or better. Very good partial response for the RWE data may 
not have a bone m arrow sample confirmation. Multiple imputation procedures created 30 datasets. Estimates were then obtained 
using Rubin’s rules to combine the individual estimates from each dataset. 
Duration of Response (DoR);  
The median adjusted DoR by trimmed stabilised IPTW for subjects who achieved at least a PR was 9.0 
months (95% CI: 7.5, 10.4) for 30.5% responders in the Eligible RRMM cohort versus 11.0 months 
(95% CI: 10.7, 11.3) for 73.4% responders in the ide-cel responder cohort. 
The median adjusted PFS was lower  in the Eligible RRMM cohort compared with the ide-cel enrolled 
cohort (3.5 months versus 12.0 months, respectively). A comparison between the 2 groups yielded a 
PFS HR of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.62, p < 0.0001), favouring the ide-cel enrolled cohort compared with 
the Eligible RRMM cohort (Figure 27).

comparison between the 2 groups yielded an HR of 0.46 (95% CI 0.29, 0.73, p = 0.001). 
Systematic Literature Review (SLR) 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 97/164 
 
 
 
 
 
An SLR was conducted to identify clinical trials and real-world studies (RWS) of patients with RRMM 
who had received ≥3 prior  lines of therapy including a PI, an immunomodulatory drug, and an anti-
CD38 antibody. Studies that did not explicitly require previous anti-CD38 treatment but did report the 
proportion  of patients who had received such an agent were also included. For further information, 
please refer to bb2121-mm-001-slr-protocol-original.docx. 
Results 
A total of 36 publications, representing 24 unique studies, were included in the SLR.  Eleven were RW 
studies and 13 were clinical trials, evaluating approved (1) and unlicensed (12) therapies.  
All RWS studies were conducted in the US, except for Brioli 2019 that was carried out in Germany. 
MAMMOTH (N=275) and Richardson 2019 (N=36) were multicentre studies, while the other studies 
were mostly small (sample size ranging from 9 to 126) and conducted in a single centre. All studies 
were similar to one another with regard to patient demographics, with median age ranging from 60 to 
67 years and the populations being predominantly Caucasian. ORR ranged from 23% to 90%, median 
PFS (when reported) ranged from 2.2 months to 7 months, and OS (when reported) ranged from 5.6 
to 16 months.  
There were four clinical trials of CAR-T therapies, three trials of BCMA targeted agents and five trials of 
non-BCMA targeted agents, including the STORM part 1 and 2 trials,  supporting the FDA approval  of 
Selinexor combined with dexamethasone. ORR for the CAR-T therapies ranged from 27% to 100%, 
and for the non-CAR-T therapies ORRs of 21% to 48% were reported. 
For further characteristics of the 11 RWS and 13 clinical trials identified by the systematic literature 
search, see summary tables below.

Adjusted indirect treatment comparisons 
Population Matching-adjusted indirect comparisons (MAICs), using PS weights to adjust for cross-study 
differences, were undertaken using individual subject-level data from Study MM-001 for ide-cel and 
aggregated summary data from STORM part 2 (selinexor) and DREAMM-2 (belantamab mafodontin) 
primary  publications (MAIC – STORM-II; MAIC-DREAMM-2).  
For the enrolled population, the effective sample size (ESS) was reduced by 56.3% and 57.7% for the 
Selinexor and Belantamab comparisons, respectively.

The null hypothesis to be tested was that the ORR (primary  efficacy endpoint) 
is ≤ 50%; the alternative hypothesis was that the ORR is > 50%. If the ORR 
tested positive, CR rate (key secondary efficacy endpoint) was to be tested 
using a stepdown approach. For CR rate, the null hypothesis was ≤ 10%. 
Subjects will be monitored in a LTFU study for up to 
15 years from the date of their last ide-cel infusion.

Treatments groups 
This was a single-arm study.  
A leukapheresis collection was performed on each subject to obtain a sufficient 
quantity of PBMCs for the production of ide-cel. If necessary, per investigator 
discretion, subjects could have received bridging therapy for myeloma disease 
control while ide-cel was being manufactured.  
Subjects received one 3-day cycle of LDC starting 5 days prior to ide-cel 
infusion: 
•  Cyclophosphamide 300 mg/m2 IV infusion over 30 minutes on Days -5, 
-4, and -3 
• 
Fludarabine 30 mg/m2 IV infusion over 30 minutes administered 
immediately after cyclophosphamide on Days -5, -4, and -3 
Ide-cel was administered IV at a target dose of 150, 300, or 450 x 106 CAR+ T 
cells. The clinical dose range was 150 to 540 x 106 CAR+ T cells. The maximum 
dose (540 x 106 CAR+ T cells) was defined by the upper limit of 450 x 106 
CAR+ T cells plus 20%, as detailed in the study protocol.

Supportive study 
Study CRB-401 dose-escalation study 
Methods 
This was a first-in-human, 2-part, nonrandomised, open-label, multicentre, Phase 1 study in subjects 
with relapsed or refractory MM. The study included 2 parts i.e dose-escalation (Part A) and dose- 
expansion (Part B).   
• 
• 
• 
The primary  objective of Part A of the study (dose escalation) was to determine the MTD of 
ide-cel in subjects with multiple myeloma (MM) whose tumours expressed BCMA and to select 
a RP2D for future studies.  
The primary  objective of the Part B of the study (dose expansion) was to confirm the safety of 
the doses chosen in Part A.  
The secondary objective of the study was to provide preliminary  efficacy data on the antitumor 
effects of treatment with ide-cel in subjects with MM whose tumours expressed BCMA. 
•  Several exploratory objectives were defined including evaluation of OS and PFS and MRD.  
For further information on the dose-escalation and dose-expansion part of the study, see section Dose 
response studies above. 
Study participants  
In Part A (dose escalation), subjects had been diagnosed with relapsed or refractory MM and received 
at least 3 different prior  lines of therapy including an immunomodulatory agent (eg, lenalidomide or 
pomalidomide) and proteasome inhibitor (PI; eg, bortezomib  or carfilzomib), or had double refractory 
disease to an immunomodulatory agent and PI. In Part B (dose expansion), subjects had been 
diagnosed with RRMM and had previous exposure to an immunomodulatory agent (eg, lenalidomide or 
pomalidomide), PI (eg, bortezomib  or carfilzomib),  and daratumumab, and were refractory to their last 
line of therapy.  
A summary of key eligibility criteria and treatment by dose cohort is provided in Table 25.

Outcomes/endpoints 
• 
• 
• 
The primary  endpoints of the study were the incidence of AEs and abnormal laboratory  test 
results, including dose-limiting toxicities. 
The secondary endpoints of the study were disease-specific response criteria including ORR, 
CR, VGPR, and PR as assessed by the investigator according to the IMWG uniform response 
criteria for MM. 
The most relevant exploratory efficacy endpoints were DoR, PFS, OS, and MRD. 
Results 
Subject disposition: A total of 67 subjects were enrolled into Study CRB-401 (ie, underwent 
leukapheresis), including 24 subjects in Part A (dose escalation) and 43 subjects in Part B (dose 
expansion). Of the 67 subjects who underwent leukapheresis, 5 discontinued prior to LDC and ide-cel 
administration due to physician decision (n = 2), progressive disease (PD) (n =1), AE (n = 1), and 
withdrawal prior  to ide-cel dosing (n = 1). No subjects discontinued after starting LDC but prior  to 
receiving ide-cel. 
The median follow-up duration for subjects who received ide-cel target doses of 150 and 450 × 106 
CAR+ T cells was 14.47 months and 9.77 months, respectively.  The median follow across the target 
doses at the latest data cut (7 April 2020) was 15.95 months (95% CI 1.5, 44.5) 
Extent of exposure to bridging AMT, LCD and ide-cel:  
The median time from leukapheresis to Abecma administration was 33.0 days, and approximately  half 
of subjects (51.6%) in the treated population overall received bridging AMT for disease control during 
Abecma manufacturing. The most commonly received (≥ 5%) bridging AMTs in the Abecma-treated 
population included dexamethasone (46.8%), cyclophosphamide (14.5%), bortezomib  (14.5%), 
carfilzomib (9.7%), pomalidomide (9.7%), and daratumumab (8.1%). A total of 3 (4.8%) subjects

overall no longer had measurable disease in the week prior  to LDC. Such subjects were to be assessed 
by the IRC only for CR or disease progression in accordance with IMWG criteria. 
All subjects received LDC (flu/cy) before ide-cel infusion as per protocol, except for 1 subject (Part B 
Cohort 1) who did not receive fludarabine due to inadequate renal function. 
A total of 62 (92.5%) enrolled subjects received ide-cel infusion. Of the 62 ide-cel-treated subjects, 45 
(72.6%) discontinued from study after receiving ide-cel, with the most common reasons being due to 
PD (32 subjects; 51.6%) and death (6 subjects; 9.7%). 
Ide-cel was successfully manufactured and released for all enrolled subjects.  
Recruitment:  
The first subject signed ICF for the study on 22 Dec 2015, underwent leukapheresis on 14 Jan 2016, 
and was administered ide-cel on 16 Feb 2016. The last subject underwent initial ide-cel infusion on 07 
Jan 2019. Enrolment in study CRB-401 is complete; a total of 62 subjects received ide-cel infusion, 
with 17 subjects ongoing and 8 subjects ongoing in Study GC-LTFU-001 for posttreatment follow-up. 
The data cutoff date for the results reported is 22 Jul 2019, approximately  7 months after the last 
subject was infused with ide-cel. An updated analyses for OS with data cut-off 7 April  2020 is reported. 
Baseline characteristics:  
In the enrolled population, across the target dose-levels, the median age of subjects was 61.0 years 
(range: 37 to 80) with more than half (64.2.%) being < 65 years of age. The majority  of subjects were 
male (64.2%) and white (88.1%).  Almost all subjects had a baseline ECOG PS of 0 (25.4%) or 1 
(70.1%).  
Approximately  half (43.3%) were defined as having high tumour burden (≥ 50% BM CD138+ plasma 
cells) and 24 subjects (37.3%) had clinical and/or radiological extra medullary plasmacytomas (EMP). 
More than half (62.7%) were assessed as having R-ISS Stage II disease; 16.4% had R-ISS  Stage III 
disease. Approximately  one-fourth of the subjects (28.4%) had at least 1 high-risk cytogenetic 
abnormality (defined as del[17p], t[4;14], or t[14;16]), with cytogenetic risk unknown in 28.4% of the 
ide-cel-treated population overall, 46.3 % of subjects had received > 6 prior  regimens. The baseline 
characteristics of the enrolled population were similar to the ide-cel-treated population (N=62). 
Data on prior therapies and on refractory status was reported for the ide-cel treated population only. 
In these patients the median number of prior antimyeloma regimens was 6.0 (range: 3 to 18), 91.9% 
of subjects had received at least 1 prior  ASCT (25.8% received at least 2 prior  ASCTs) and the median 
time from initial diagnosis to ide-cel administration was 5.51 years (range: 0.8 to 35.7). Patients had a 
high degree of refractoriness to prior  AMTs, with 88.7% being refractory to immunomodulatory agents, 
83.9% being refractory to PIs, 80.6% being refractory to anti-CD38 antibody, 80.6% of subjects being 
double-refractory (ie, refractory to an IMiD and a PI) and 69.4% of subjects being triple-refractory (ie, 
refractory to an IMiD, a PI, and anti-CD38 antibody). Approximately  75% of subjects were refractory 
to their last prior therapy.  
ORR: Results from response assessment for the ide-cel-treated and enrolled populations in CBR-401 
are presented by ide-cel target doses, i.e. RP2D (150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells) and in the enrolled 
population together with data from the MM-001 study. Due to limited number of patients in the 150 x 
106 dose group a pooled analysis including results from the MM-001 (n=4) and CRB-401 (n=18) 
studies was performed (Table 26).

For subjects who were enrolled (ie, leukapheresed), but not infused, minimal efficacy assessment data 
following IMWG criteria were collected; therefore, PFS and OS was not analysed for the enrolled 
population in the CBR-401 study. 
In the CBR-401 study the analyses of PFS as assessed by the IRC using the EMA censoring rules the 
KM estimate for median PFS in subjects who received the ide-cel i.e. RP2D population was 8.8 months 
(95% CI: 5.9, 11.1), identical to the median PFS as assessed using FDA censoring rules.

Note: For the ide-cel-treated population, OS was defined as tim e from ide-cel infusion to death due to any cause. Overall survival for 
the enrolled population was calculated from the date of enrolment (ie, leukapheresis). 
Data Cutoff: 16 Oct 2019 (Study MM-001) and 22 July 2019 (Study CRB-401) 
In updated analyses (Data cut off 7 Apr 2020) in the total study population in CBR-401 (across the 
dose groups) a median OS of 36.6 months (23.2, NE) was reported with a median follow-up of 15.95 
months (95% CI 1.5, 44.5). 
In updated analyses in the pooled 150 x 106 dose cohort (N=22) across the studies (Data cut off 7 Apr  
2020 for both studies) the ORR, DoR and PFS did not change. At the last data cut-off, the median OS 
was Not Estimable (NE) (95%CI 10.8, NE) with an event-free rate at 36 months of 50.6% (SE 12.39) 
Efficacy following retreatment with ide-cel 
Of the total 62 subjects included in CBR-401, 17 (35.5%) did receive ide-cel retreatment at target 
dose levels ranging from 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells. As of the 22 Jul 2019 data cutoff date, the 
ORR (ie, best confirmed response of PR or better) as determined by the investigator was 11.8% (2/17) 
(95% CI: 1.5, 36.4) for subjects retreated with ide-cel, the subjects confirmed best overall response of 
VGPR. After first infusion of ide-cel the two patient achieved sCR and SD. The median duration from 
initial infusion to retreatment was 8.31 months (range: 2.8, 18.7). 
Comparison of Efficacy for Ide-cel and Other Therapies for the Treatment of RRMM 
The efficacy of an ide-cel target dose of 150 × 106 CAR+ T cells was compared to that from other 
therapies tested in subjects with RRMM who had been previously exposed to an immunomodulatory 
agent, a proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody using a systematic literature review.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The primary  evidence of efficacy comes from an ongoing, open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre, 
multinational, Phase 2 study, BB2121-MM-001 (MM-001), based on a primary  data cut-off of 16th Oct 
2019. More mature data based on two updated cut-offs (14th Jan 2020 and 07th April 2020) have also 
been provided. 
The uncontrolled study design was the subject of Scientific Advice where concerns were raised that the 
target population was not representative of a “last line population”, for which an uncontrolled trial 
approach would be acceptable. In the current MAA, the lack of alternative therapies to provide a SOC 
control arm in an RCT has not been justified. Nevertheless, in light of the rather compelling efficacy 
data, further substantiated by adjusted indirect comparisons to external controls, the provided clinical 
data package is considered sufficient to allow a benefit/risk assessment. 
The main uncertainties relate to the single arm study design, the limited sample size in addition to a 
rather short duration of follow-up, especially for OS. Furthermore, the robustness of the adjusted 
indirect treatment comparison based on the RWS is difficult to verify, considering the rather selected 
study population, and the missing data of several important prognostic factors. Thus, although the 
ORR/DoR benefit is considered sufficiently compelling in the context of a single arm  trial, the true 
magnitude of the treatment effect, including to what extent the observed responses will be reflected in 
long term benefit in OS, cannot be reliably ascertained. The patient population in the pivotal MM-001 
study was heterogenous. 
Per inclusion criteria,  patients had received at least 3 prior  regimens including an immunomodulatory 
agent, a PI, and an anti-CD38 antibody, and had to be refractory to their last treatment regimen. Data 
on the less refractory patients are limited i.e only 16.4% (n=23) were mono or double refractory. The 
greater availability and benefit of SOC options in these less refractory patients, introduces uncertainty 
as to the true magnitude of the effect size, as robust comparative data on the benefit of ide-cel vs SOC 
options in this population are lacking. Due to these deficiencies, the clinical data package was not 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 112/164 
 
 
 
 
 
considered comprehensive to fulfil the requirements for a full MA, and the applicant submitted a formal 
request for conditional marketing authorisation. More comprehensive data in the less refractory 
patients will be part of the obligations for a full MA i.e. results from the MM-003 study comparing ide-
cel to SOC triplet regimes in patients with 2-4 prior  anti-myeloma therapies.  
Further key eligibility criteria included PS of 0-1 and no major  co-morbidities or organ dysfunction. 
Although exclusion of patients with significant comorbidities is understood from the safety perspective, 
the criteria applied selected untypically healthy patients, and thus tolerability of the treatment, ability 
of the patients to withstand the delay from treatment decision to ide-cel infusion, and the extent of 
clinical benefit in a less fit, older patient population is not known. Rephrasing the indication is unlikely 
to be sufficient to ensure that clinical use is restricted to a similarly  fit patient population for which a 
positive benefit/risk has been demonstrated. However, patient populations that were excluded from 
the clinical study are described in the Product Information. 
The primary  efficacy endpoint was ORR according to the IMWG criteria (Kumar, 2016) assessed by an 
IRC. This is acceptable in the context of an uncontrolled trial.  CR rate was defined as a key secondary 
endpoint. The remaining secondary outcomes included endpoints conventional for oncology trials such 
as DOR, PFS and OS and are considered acceptable. 
As per Scientific Advice, a global, non-interventional, retrospective study (NDS-MM-003) was set up to 
generate an external comparison arm for study MM-001 including patient level data from 190 eligible 
RRMM subjects treated with currently available therapies. Propensity score methodology was used to 
ensure that RW subjects were comparable  to the ide-cel cohort. A SLR was also performed to further 
understand the efficacy of ide-cel in the context of the current treatment landscape. Two studies from 
the SLR were selected for MAIC comparisons (selinexor and belantamab mafodontin). 
Study CRB-401 investigated the efficacy of ide-cel in a similar  patient population and at the same 
target dose levels as those used in study MM-001, and it’s use as a supportive study for the MAA is 
considered acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses  
Of the total 140 subjects enrolled in MM-001, 128 subjects received ide-cel infusion and were included 
in the ide-cel-treated population. This was defined as the primary  efficacy population by the applicant. 
However,  for the purpose of this assessment, the analyses based on the ITT (enrolled) population is 
considered the main efficacy analyses. 
The drop-out rate of 8.5% from enrolment to infusion was lower  than the anticipated 15%, indicating 
the majority of patients are able to tolerate the treatment delay required for product manufacturing 
and LDC. 
Included patients were young (median age 60.5 years), and heavily pre-treated (median of 6 (range 3-
17) previous lines of therapy) with 83.6% being triple refractory. As expected in this advanced patient 
population, participants with ISS stage III disease, extramedullary disease, and high-risk cytogenetic 
features were well represented. The European population is represented by the inclusion of 33 patients 
from several EU countries. 
The majority of subjects (87.5%) received bridging therapy, to which only five subjects achieved a 
response (i.e. “unconfirmed” PR (4 subjects) or VGPR (1 subject)) prior  to LDC. A total of 6 (4.7%) 
subjects in the pivotal study and three patients in the CRB-401 no longer had measurable disease at 
baseline prior  to LDC after bridging. Pre-lymphodepletion disease status indicate that these patients 
were responders to bridging chemotherapy. For the purpose of the efficacy analyses, these subjects 
were to be assessed by the IRC only for at least a CR or disease progression in accordance with IMWG 
2016 guidelines. Three CR/sCR responses after ide-cel infusion were observed in these patients,

Page 113/164 
 
 
 
indicating that deep responses were not disproportionally driven by patients who did not have 
measurable disease at baseline. Thus, bridging therapy is considered to have had a limited impact on 
the efficacy outcomes. 
The study met its primary  endpoint for ORR as assessed by IRC; In the enrolled population, the ORR 
across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+T cells was 67.1%, 95% CI: 59.4, 74.9 (p < 
0.0001) (Data Cut Off day 7 April 2020), statistically significantly higher than the pre-specified 50% 
cut-off. After 3 months further follow-up, two additional subjects received stringent complete response 
(sCR) (previously with PR and VGPR) and MRD negative status, with the ORR unchanged. 
The CR rate (CR or better) in the enrolled population was 28.6% (95% CI: 21.1, 36.1), rejecting the 
null hypothesis of ≤ 10%. At a later data cut-off date (7 April  2020) the result has been confirmed 
being 30.0% (95% CI: 22.4, 37.6). 
The majority of the subgroups evaluated achieved a response rate in line with the ORR of the overall 
patient population. 
The benefit of ide-cel was supported by secondary endpoints. At the primary  data cut off (16 October 
2019), across the three dose levels, a median DoR of 10.5 months (95% CI: 8.0, 11.3) was reported 
among the 94 ide-cel responders. This DoR was confirmed at the latest data-cuf off (i.e median DoR of 
10.6 months (95% CI: 8.0, 11.4, 07 April  2020). The DoR is over twice as long as the TTP on previous 
treatment regimen received (4.6 months), and comparable  to that observed for belantamab mafodotin 
(11 months) and the RWD Eligible RRMM cohort (9.0 months). This is considered clinically relevant, 
especially in the context that approximately  2/3 of the patients respond to the treatment. 
At the latest data cut-off (07 April 2020) the median PFS was 8.3 months (95% CI: 6.7, 12.0) and  
75.0% of the subjects had progressed/died. At the target dose of 450 x 10 6 CAR+ T cells, the median 
PFS was 12.1 months (95% CI: 7.5, 12.4) with a 63.0% event rate. The median OS was 21.4 months 
(95% CI: 19.3, NE; 39.3% of subjects had died), and the estimated survival rate at 18 months from 
leukapheresis was 64%. At the target dose of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, the median OS was NE (95% 
CI: NE, NE) and the survival rate at 18 months from infusion was 69%.  
No curative potential can be concluded based on available data. Thus, the duration of response has to 
be weighed against the long delay from treatment decision to administration of therapy, and risks 
associated with the relatively harsh treatment procedures including bridging therapies likely required 
and the LDC. 
The adjusted indirect comparisons to the NDS-MM-003 study demonstrated a clinically relevant and 
statistically significant benefit for ide-cel across all pre-defined efficacy endpoints, with an ORR of 
69.4% (95% CI: 60.3, 80.0) for the ide-cel enrolled population vs 32.0% (95% CI: 24.1, 42.5) for the 
RW eligible cohort. The HR for PFS (0.43 (95% CI: 0.30, 0.62, p < 0.0001) was also compelling in 
favour of ide-cel. However, despite extensive efforts to match the patient populations, the comparisons 
are limited by several factors including the rather long time period (up to 60 days from the index date) 
allowed for the collection of baseline data, the overlapping recruitment periods for the RWS and the 
MM-001 at the same study centres, the large proportion of missing data (up to 30%) for some included 
co-variates and several co-variates excluded from the PS model due to >30% missing data.  
The SLR mostly identified studies that were small, single centre and/or Phase I/II. Across the RWS 
(n=11), ORR ranged from 23% to 90%, probably  reflective of the heterogeneity of the included patient 
populations and the small sample sizes. With the exception of belantamab mafodotin and selinexor the 
clinical trials (n=13) reported outcomes for unapproved therapies, and are as such not considered 
immediately relevant for the current application. For the two MAIC comparisons, the study populations 
were generally more  heavily pre-treated and more refractory than that of the MM-001 study, leading to 
a substantial reduction in the ESSs (close to 60%). Results following matching showed a benefit of ide-

cel in terms of ORR, PFS and OS (Selinexor only). However, the unanchored comparisons may produce 
biased estimates, due to the lack of adjustment for all important co-variates and the inability to adjust 
for unknown confounders. 
Nevertheless, despite the limitations of the indirect treatment comparisons, the results indicate that 
ide-cel treatment is associated with responses that are well above those reported with current 
standard of care. The durability of responses is confirmed, with ongoing responses observed in 29 of 
the 94 responders (30.9%) at the last data cut off. Results from PFS and OS also appear  compelling in 
the context of the external data provided, lending further support for the sustained benefit of ide-cel. 
To what extent the observed responses will be reflected in long term benefit in OS is not known. The 
follow-up for OS is short (i.e. the median follow-up duration for all surviving subjects in the ide-cel 
enrolled population was only 17 months at the latest DCO) and the OS estimates especially beyond 
median follow-up are considered to be encumbered with high uncertainty. 
The proposed ide-cel dose range was 150 to 540 x 106 CAR+ T cells. The actual ide-cel dose 
administered to the patient will be driven by feasibility (ie, the success of leukapheresis and 
manufacturing), with a target dose for all patients of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells. To support the approval 
of this dose range, pooled efficacy results from study MM-001 and from study CRB-401 were provided.  
Compared to MM-001, fewer subjects in CBR-401 were triple-refractory (75.0% vs 84.4%), were 
refractory to anti-CD 38 antibodies (87.5% vs 93.5% and had received AMT bridging therapy for 
disease control during ide-cel manufacturing (53.6% vs 87.5%). Otherwise, the baseline 
characteristics of the patient populations were relatively well aligned across the two studies. In both 
studies, allocation to the dose-groups was not randomised and some imbalances in prognostic factors 
hampers the comparison across the dose categories both within and across the studies. 
In both study MM-001 and CRB-401, there was a numerically increase in response rates for each dose 
level. The highest response rates were observed at the target dose of 450 x 106 CAR T+ cells, with 
consistent results across the two studies (ORR of 81.5 %, CR rate of 35.2% in study MM-001 
compared to ORR of 84.2% and CR of 36.8% in CBR-401). The dose of 300 x 106 CAR+ T cells was 
only investigated in study MM-001 with response rates close to those observed for the 450 x 106 CAR+ 
T cell target dose (ORR 68.6%, 95%CI:56.4, 79.1) and the lower bound of the 95% CI above the pre-
specified cut off of ORR >50%. For the 150 x 106 CAR+ T cells dose level, however, the pooled 
analysis indicate substantially lower response rates of 54.5% with the lower bound of the 95% CI 
below the pre-specified cutoff of 50% (95% CI: 32.2, 75.6) for ORR an 31% (95% CI: 13.9, 54.9 ) for 
CR or better. A similar trend for dose response was observed for PFS, with the median PFS time at the 
lowest dose level of only 3.8 months (95% CI: 1.9, 10.9). The dose response relationship is further 
supported by the PK data as well as by the multivariate analyses. 
Thus, the limited data provided indicates reduced clinical responses at the 150 x 106 dose level across 
both the supportive and the pivotal study, and a positive benefit/risk for the 150 x106 dose level in the 
context of the external data cannot be concluded. Therefore, the dose-range was restricted to 300 to 
450 x 106 CAR+ T cells corresponding to 260 to 420 x 106 viable CAR+T cells (with the allowance of 
20% over the target dose of 420 x 106 viable CAR+ T cells). The data on the lowest dose level will be 
kept under the summary of efficacy in section 5.1 SmPC as the data was part of the primary  efficacy 
analysis and as it is considered the information may be useful for the prescriber  (i.e. in case 
administration of an out of specification dose is considered).  
In both the pivotal and supportive studies retreatment was allowed for eligible subjects (achieving a 
best response to initial ide-cel infusion of SD or better). Responses reported in the re-treated 
population in study MM-001 were infrequent i.e. only 5 PRs (17.2%) and one VGPR (3.4%) reported in 
the 29 retreated patients, and a limited PFS was observed (1.0 month, 95% CI: 0.95, 1.97). In the 
supportive study (CRB-401) 17 patients received retreatment with a reported ORR of 11.8% (2/17) 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 115/164 
 
 
 
(95% CI: 1.5, 36.4), both subjects confirmed with VGPR as best overall response. In study MM-001, all 
patients who achieved a response were ADA negative before retreatment (6/12 ADA negative patients) 
while none of the 17 ADA positive patients achieved a response. Adverse events leading to death were 
reported in 9 (31.0%) subjects. Considering the safety profile, and lack of responses in ADA positive 
patients, a warning is included in the SmPC. 
Additional  efficacy data needed in the context of a conditional MA 
The original MAA was for a full MA. However, the clinical data package consisting of one uncontrolled 
pivotal trial (MM-001 n=140) and one uncontrolled Phase 1 supportive study (CRB 401, n=67) was not 
considered to provide comprehensive data to fulfil the requirements for a full MA. Although the size of 
the clinical efficacy and safety database as well as the duration of follow up were considered adequate, 
there are outstanding uncertainties; The patient population in the pivotal MM-001 study was highly 
selected in terms of performance status and co-morbidities,  and can thus not be considered 
representative of a “real world” RRMM patient population. The main concern, therefore, is related to 
the lack of a concurrent control arm to establish the magnitude of the PFS and OS gain, in this highly 
selected study population. The external data provides contextualisation of the study results, however, 
there are several limitations impacting on the validity of the indirect treatment comparisons. 
Furthermore, the limited sample size hampers the subgroup analyses. Data on less refractory (i.e. 
mono- or double-refractory) patients are limited and robust comparative data on the benefit of SOC 
options in this population are lacking.  
The applicant therefore requested consideration of its application for a Conditional Marketing 
Authorisation: 
The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 concerning 
conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-threatening disease.  
Furthermore, it is considered that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation: 
The benefit/risk is considered to be positive in a patient population consistent with the MM-001 study 
population. Ide-cel has a mechanism of action that is different from that of authorised treatments and 
has shown to be associated with a 67.1% objective response rate and a median duration of response 
of 11 months in this group of highly pre-treated patients. The toxicity profile of ide-cel is largely in line 
with the known adverse effect profile of CAR T cell therapies. The main safety concerns are cytokine 
release syndrome, cytopaenias and neurotoxicity, and the treatment is tolerated when adverse effects 
are closely monitored and actively managed. 
It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data by post-approval  specific 
obligations. The ongoing randomised study (MM-003) comparing ide-cel with SOC and conducted in an 
overlapping patient population (received 2-4 prior anti-myeloma regimens) is considered to be suitable 
as a specific obligation to the MA. These data will be provided by June 2023. Updated efficacy and 
safety data (24 months after the last subject has received ide-cel) from the ongoing Study BB2121-
MM-001 will also be provided as a SOB to the CMA. These data will be provided by December 2021. 
An unmet medical need exists in the target MM population, as available therapies in this setting offer 
limited clinical benefit. Almost all patients eventually relapse and become resistant to available 
treatments, where the remission duration generally decreases with each subsequent treatment 
regimen, and where the toxicity of different regimens is significant and quite different between 
products. In this context, medicinal products with a positive benefit-risk balance and new mechanism 
of action can provide a major therapeutic advantage to patients if they offer possible alternative or 
additional treatment options based on a different safety profile, or based on therapeutic efficacy.  
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021

Recently approved products for RRMM include lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib,  carfilzomib, 
ixazomib,  panobinostat, daratumumab, isatuximab, and elotuzumab. All of these treatments are set 
from first line to second line or beyond also in different combinations. Belantamab mafodotin and 
selinexor have been recently granted authorisation for treatment of multiple myeloma  in adult patients 
in forth line and beyond. 
Refractoriness to prior  therapies largely defines the available treatment options for RRMM patients in 
late line setting in which several different treatment combinations may be used. Although indirect 
comparisons of efficacy are challenging in this heterogeneous population, based on high response rate, 
durability of responses and manageability of the safety profile, ide-cel can be considered to address 
the unmet medical need to a similar or greater extent than other approved medicinal products. 
Therefore, Abecma  can be considered to represent a major  therapeutic advantage vis-à-vis existing 
treatments and fulfil an unmet medical need in the approved indication as monotherapy for the 
treatment of multiple myeloma in adult patients, who have received at least three prior  therapies 
including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome inhibitor and an anti CD38 antibody and have 
demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions  on the clinical efficacy 
In this heavily pre-treated RRMM population ide-cel showed response rates considered clinically 
meaningful and well above those reported with current standard of care. The durability of the 
responses is confirmed, with still ongoing responses observed in 29 of the 94 responders at the last 
data cut off (07 April  2020).  
Results for the secondary endpoints were consistent with the primary  endpoint, and overall the results 
compare favourably to those observed in the matched real world (RW) historical cohort as well as 
those reported in the literature.  
Concerning the proposed ide-cel dose range (a target dose of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, within the dose 
range of 150 to 540 x 106 CAR+ T cells), the limited data for the 150 x 106 dose indicates efficacy may 
be substantially reduced, and a positive B/R for this dose level cannot be concluded. Therefore, the 
dose-range was restricted to 300 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells corresponding to 260 to 420 x 106 viable 
CAR+T cells (with the allowance of 20% over the target dose of 420 x 106 CAR+ T cells).  
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to ensure the follow-up of efficacy: 
• 
In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Abecma in adult patients 
with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior 
therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome  inhibitor and an anti CD38 
antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy the MAH shall 
conduct and submit the results of a prospective study based on data from a registry, according 
to an agreed protocol.  Interim reports to be submitted in accordance with the RMP. Final report 
expected by 30 September  2042. 
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address the missing efficacy data in the 
context of a conditional marketing authorisation: 
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Abecma in adult patients with relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma  who have received at least three prior  therapies, the MAH should 
submit 24 months post-Abecma infusion follow-up data (in the enrolled and treated 
population) of the pivotal study KarMMa (MM-001). Expected date for submission is 31 
December 2021. 
Assessment report

• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Abecma in adult patients with relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma  who have received at least three prior  therapies, the MAH should 
submit the results of the Phase 3 study KarMMa-3 (MM-003) comparing the efficacy and safety 
of Abecma vs. standard triplet regimens in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma.  Expected date for submission is 30 June 2023. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical efficacy as described above 
2.6.  Clinical  safety 
Patient  exposure 
The evaluation of safety includes data from 7 ongoing clinical studies (5 interventional studies and 2 
LTFU studies). The primary  focus of the safety analysis is on the pivotal Study MM-001 (Phase 2, 
N=128) with supportive safety data from the dose escalation Study CRB-401 (Phase 1, N=56), in total 
184 patients (pooled analysis). Based on cut-off date 07 Apr 2020, the follow-up time is 15.5 months 
across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells and 15.2 months for the target dose of 
450 x 106 CAR+ T cells in the pooled analysis of the pivotal study MM-001 and the supportive study 
CRB-401. Part of the patients in both studies have been re-exposed by one additional treatment 
consisting of LDC followed by one dose of ide-cel; 27 retreated patients in the pivotal study and 17 in 
the supportive study.  
The following subject populations (i.e., analysis sets) were evaluated and used for presentation of the 
safety data: 
• 
• 
Enrolled population: All subjects who signed informed consent and underwent leukapheresis.  
Abecma-treated population. 
The patient population consists of heavily pretreated patients with relapsed/refractory MM and who had 
been previously exposed to a wide range of available therapies. Based on baseline characteristics the 
patients can be considered to represent of very special population of MM patients being younger and 
having good performance status.  
The exclusion criteria include several criteria to mitigate the risk of neurotoxicity. Patients with CNS 
involvement or CNS pathologies were excluded from the study. No contraindications are currently 
proposed. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events are presented from the pivotal study MM-001 and the supportive phase 1 study CRB 
401 in tables below.  The safety data are also presented as pooled analysis. In addition, AEs have been 
presented by target doses and time period (≤ 8 weeks and > 8 weeks after infusion). In general, the 
frequencies presented from the pivotal study and pooled analysis, are quite similar for most variables. 
The frequencies from the pivotal study are presented in the product information.

The most common adverse reactions included neutropenia (91.3%), CRS (81.0%), anaemia (70.7%), 
thrombocytopenia (66.8%), Infections – Pathogen Unspecified (53.8%), leukopenia (48.4%), fatigue 
(39.1%), diarrhoea (36.4%), hypokalaemia (34.2%), hypophosphatemia and nausea (32.6% each), 
lymphopenia (31.5%), pyrexia (28.8%), cough (27.2%), hypocalcaemia (26.6%), Infections – Viral 
(26.1%), headache (23.9%), hypomagnesemia (22.3%), upper respiratory tract infection (21.7%), 
arthralgia (20.7%), oedema peripheral (20.1%), decreased appetite and hypogammaglobulinaemia 
(19.6%), and febrile neutropenia (16.3%). Other common adverse reactions occurring at lower 
frequency and considered clinically important included pneumonia (10.3%); tremor  (8.2%); 
somnolence (5.4%); and aphasia, encephalopathy, and syncope (4.3% each). 
Grade ≥3 AEs 
The most common Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were neutropenia (88.6%); anaemia (58.2%);  
thrombocytopenia (53.3%); leukopenia (45.1%); lymphopenia (30.4%); Infections – Pathogen 
Unspecified (17.9%); hypophosphatemia (17.4%); febrile neutropenia (14.7%); hypocalcaemia and 
Infections – Viral (7.1% each); pneumonia (6.0%); and CRS, hypertension, and hyponatremia (5.4% 
each). Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions were more often observed within the initial 8 weeks postinfusion 
(97.8%) compared to after 8 weeks postinfusion (60.8%).  
Grade 3 or 4 Adverse Events in the First 8 Weeks Across Target Dose Levels by Period 
The most frequently reported Grade 3 or 4 adverse reactions reported within the first 8 weeks after 
infusion were neutropenia (87.0%), anaemia (56.0%), thrombocytopenia (48.4%), leukopenia 
(44.0%), and lymphopenia (27.7%), and hypophosphatemia (16.3%). 
The majority of Grade 3 or 4 AEs were hematologic events, and the frequency of all Grade 3 or 4 AEs 
increased slightly across the cumulative periods, which is not unanticipated as any subject with data 
for the first period would also be included throughout the other 3 periods. 
Grade 5 adverse events 
In the pooled analysis, ≥ 1 Grade 5 AE was reported in 34 (18.5%) subjects who received ide-cel 
across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 x106 CAR+ T cells. The most frequently reported Grade 5 
AE was general physical health deterioration (19 [10.3%] subjects), followed by pneumonia and 
respiratory  failure (2 [1.1%] subjects each). All other Grade 5 AEs were reported for 1 (0.5%) subject 
each: bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, cardiac failure congestive, cardio-respiratory arrest, cerebral 
haemorrhage, CRS, death, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, lung adenocarcinoma, pneumonia 
cytomegaloviral, sepsis, and toxicity to various agents. In the interval between the MAA and the 
updated data cutoff date, 2 additional subjects (1 subject in Study MM-001 and 1 subject in Study 
CRB-401) had a Grade 5 AE (general physical health deterioration and disease progression, 
respectively) reported after ide-cel retreatment. The majority of the verbatim terms for the Grade 5

AEs that were mapped to the PT of general physical health deterioration were related to the worsening 
of the subjects’ health or general condition due to multiple myeloma  (MM). 
Among the 34 subjects with grade 5 AEs, five cases were considered related to ide-cel infusion: 
bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, cytokine release syndrome [CRS], death [from an unknown cause], 
and gastrointestinal [GI] haemorrhage and pneumonia cytomegaloviral one case each. CRS and 
infections are well known serious adverse events that can be potential fatal. The SmPC gives 
recommendation to minimise the risk for these AEs. Gastrointestinal haemorrhage is listed as a 
common AE in SmPC section 4.8; it is considered related to thrombocytopenia and in section 4.4 it is 
said that blood counts should be monitored prior to and after Abecma  infusion. Cytopenias should be 
managed with myeloid growth factor and blood transfusion support according to institutional 
guidelines. 
Deaths 
In the pooled analysis, deaths from all causes were reported for 64 (34.8%) of 184 subjects who 
received ide-cel (including initial treatment and retreatment) across the target dose levels of 150 to 
450 x 106 CAR+ T cells. Of the 64 deaths, 45 occurred after initial ide-cel infusion and 19 deaths 
occurred after ide-cel retreatment.  For more  information, see separate section below. 
Serious AEs 
In the pooled analysis, serious adverse reactions were reported in 70.1% of subjects. The most 
common serious adverse reactions included CRS (17.4%), pneumonia (7.1%), and febrile neutropenia 
and pyrexia (6.0% each). Other serious adverse reactions occurring at lower frequency and considered 
clinically important included neutropenia (4.3%); sepsis and thrombocytopenia (3.8% each); 
confusional state and dyspnoea (2.2% each); and encephalopathy, hypoxia, and mental status 
changes (1.6% each). For more information, see separate section below.

Cytokine release syndrome (CRS) 
At cutoff date 16 Oct 2019 CRS was seen in 83.6% of subjects in the pivotal study, with increasing 
frequency with increasing dose: 50.0%, 75.7%, and 96.3% of subjects at a target dose of 150, 300, 
and 450 x 106 CAR T cells, respectively. In the pooled analysis the frequency of CRS was 81.0% of 
subjects with increasing frequency with increasing dose: 40.9%, 75.7% and 94.6% of subjects at a 
target dose of 150, 300, and 450 x 106 CAR T cells, respectively. Overall there were no obvious 
differences in those patients who developed CRS compared to those who did not, except the exposure 
to ide-cel treatment. The increased frequency of CRS (any grade) was observed with increasing ide-cel 
dose and that was considered consistent with the mechanism of action and the expected effect of ide-
cel, which was already reported in the original submission. No obvious predisposing factors concerning 
CRS development was thus observed.   Most subjects with CRS had a maximum Grade 1 (47.4%) or 2 
(30.5%) event, 5 (3.9%) subjects had a maximum  Grade 3 CRS, and 1 (0.8%) subject each had a 
maximum  Grade 4 or Grade 5 event.   There was a higher frequency in Grade ≥3 with the higher dose 
levels of 300 and 450 x 106 CAR+T cells compared to 150 x 106 CAR+T cells  (pivotal study:0%, 5.7%, 
and 5.6% with 150, 300 and 450 x 106 CAR+T cells respectively), but the frequencies at the highest

dose levels are indeed low. The frequencies of CRS in the dose escalation study confirmed the lower 
frequency at the lowest dose of 150 x 106 CAR+ T cells seen in the pivotal study.  
In study MM-001 CRS was reported as an SAE for 22 (17.2%), and in CRB-401, CRS was reported as 
an SAE for 10 (17.9%) subjects. In MM-001 study, hospitalisation was required for 20 (15.6%) of 
subjects. There was one (0.8%) death due CRS SAE   at a dose of 300 x 106 CAR+T cells. 
In the pooled analysis, based on cutoff date 07 Apr  2020, CRS occurred in 81.0% of subjects receiving 
ide-cel. Grade 3 or higher CRS occurred in 10 (5.4%) subjects, with fatal CRS reported in 1 (0.8%) 
subject. The median time to onset of CRS, any grade, was 1 day (range: 1 to 17) and the median 
duration of CRS was 5 days (range: 1 to 63). The most common manifestations of CRS included 
pyrexia (78.3%), hypotension (32.1%), tachycardia (25.5%), chills (23.4%), hypoxia (16.3%), C-
reactive protein increased (16.3%), headache (14.7%) and fatigue (10.9%). Grade 3 or higher events 
that may be observed in association with CRS included atrial fibrillation, capillary leak syndrome, 
hypotension, hypoxia and HLH/MAS. Of the 184 subjects, 45.1% of subjects received tocilizumab for 
treatment of CRS; 32.6% received a single dose while 12.5% received > 1 dose of tocilizumab. 
Overall, across the target dose levels, 15.8% of subjects received ≥ 1 dose of corticosteroids for 
treatment of CRS. Of 92 subjects at the target dose of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, 54.3% of subjects 
received ≥1 dose of tocilizumab and 22.8% received ≥1 dose of corticosteroids for treatment of CRS. 
Neurologic toxicology 
Neurologic AEs in the pivotal study were reported in 18.0%, 39.1% and 68.0% of subjects (almost the 
same in the pooled analysis, see table above) as reflected with three methods of reporting, 
respectively (cutoff date 16 Oct 2019): 
• 
Investigator-identified neurotoxicity (iiNT) - included only the single AE PT of “neurotoxicity” as 
identified by the investigator in Study MM-001. In Study MM-001, iiNT was the primary  safety 
assessment for neurotoxicity. 
•  Neurotoxicity focused - included selected PTs of neurologic toxicity events as determined by 
the sponsor with consideration of biological/pharmacological plausibility for a drug-event 
relationship. This is consistent with published guidelines for CAR T cell-associated 
encephalopathy (Lee DW et al , Biol Blood Marrow Transplant 25 (2019) 625-638).  
•  Neurotoxicity broad - In addition to reporting the AE term of “neurotoxicity” in Study MM-001, 
the investigators were instructed to report  individual signs and symptoms associated with the 
iiNT separately. The individual signs or symptoms of iiNT were converted to AEs, and these PTs 
were combined with all AEs and replaced the AE PT of “neurotoxicity”. Included all PTs within 
the primary  or secondary MedDRA SOCs of nervous system disorders and psychiatric disorders. 
iiNT method: 
In the pivotal study the frequency of neurotoxicity was 18%, time to onset was 2.0 days (range: 1 to 
10), duration was 3.0 days (range: 1-26), frequency of Grade≥3 neurotoxicity was 3.1%, time to 
onset was 4.0 days (range: 2-5) and duration was 4.0 days (range: 2-5). 
Focused method: 
Pivotal study: The frequency of neurotoxicity was 39.1%, time to onset was 4.0 days (range: 1 to 
282), duration was 4.0 days (range: 1-242), frequency of Grade≥3 neurotoxicity was 5.5%, time to 
onset was 4.0 days (range: 2-226) and duration was 2.0 days (range: 2-26). 
Pooled analysis: The frequency of neurotoxicity was 40,2%, time to onset was 4.5 days (range: 1 to 
481), duration was 4.0 days (range: 1-360), frequency of Grade≥3 neurotoxicity was 4.8%, time to 
onset was 6.0  days (range: 2-226) and duration was 3.5 days (range: 2-32). 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 122/164 
 
 
 
Broad method:  
Frequency of neurotoxicity in the pivotal study was 68.0%, in the pooled analysis the frequency was 
72.8% 
“Neurotoxicity focused” seems to reflect study drug related AEs and is highlighted in this assessment. 
A comparison has been presented by the applicant of the iiNT method and “focused method” which 
concluded that the median onset time was longer (4.0 versus 2.0 days) with Neurologic Toxicity – 
Focused compared with iiNT.  The severity, median duration, and management of these events 
(including the use of corticosteroids) were similar.  The time to first onset of neurologic toxicity event 
was shorter with the higher doses. The median time to onset of the first Neurologic Toxicity – Focused 
AE was 4.5 days (range: 1 to 481) and the median duration was 4.0 days (range: 1 to 360), thus 
there are clearly patients with long-term neurological toxicity. However, only 9 subjects (4.8%) had 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 AE. 
In the pooled analysis 33 (19.5%) subjects have neurological events lasting > 10 days, and the event 
was ongoing at data cut-off in 18 (10.7%) subjects.  
The applicant has presented detailed analysis of Neurologic Toxicity – Focused AE in relation to AE 
duration, comorbidities or other predisposing factors (such as demographics or baseline disease 
characteristics). In general, the demographic and baseline disease characteristics were similar among 
the subjects regardless of the duration of neurologic toxicity.

Table 32: 
A total of 21 subjects had at least 1 Neurologic Toxicity – Focused AE that lasted > 10 days in the 
pooled analysis, of which 14 in the pivotal Study MM-001. The only notable differences were that for 
those events lasting > 30 days, there was a lengthier time to onset from ide-cel infusion, with a 
median time to onset of 36 days, compared to a median time to onset of 6 days for those events with 
a duration of > 10 to ≤ 30 days.  
A greater percentage of subjects who had Neurologic Toxicity – Focused AEs lasting > 10 to ≤ 30 days 
received steroid treatment compared to those subjects with events lasting > 30 days (50.0% versus 
7.1%, respectively). However, as the numbers are small, no meaningful conclusions can be drawn on 
these observations at this stage. 
Independent of the method approach, the frequencies were similar at the target doses of 300 and 450 
x 106 CAR+ T cells, and higher than with the target dose of 150 x 106 CAR+ T cells (17.1% and 20.4% 
versus 0%, respectively, for iiNT; 40.0% and 38.9% versus 25.0% for Neurologic Toxicity – Focused). 
The frequency of “focused AEs” was 39.1% across the target doses in the pivotal study, but only 5.5% 
of subjects had AEs of maximum Grade 3, and none with Grade 4 or 5. There was an increase in 
frequency of Grade 3 or higher events with increased dose levels; 0%, 2.9%, and 9.3% across the 
target dose levels of 150, 300, and 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, respectively. The frequencies of 
neurological AEs were a bit higher in the supportive study (42.9% overall “focused AEs”), than in the 
pivotal study (39.1%). Neurological AEs reported for ≥ 5% of subjects according to “focused AEs” were 
confusional state and dizziness (13.3%), insomnia (8.6%), tremor  (7.8%), somnolence and 
encephalopathy (6.3% each), and aphasia (5.5%). In the non-focused, broader analysis of neurologic 
AEs the most frequently reported events were headache (28.8%), dizziness (15.2%), and confusional 
state (13.0%). Overall, there was no dose-dependent toxicity, and the Broad toxicity took place in 
64.1% of subjects within the first 8 weeks.

Independent of investigator attribution of neurotoxicity, the most frequent neurologic or psychiatric 
adverse reactions included headache (28.8%), dizziness (15.2%), confusional state (13.0%), insomnia 
(9.8%), anxiety and tremor (8.2% each), and somnolence (6.5%). Other neurological reactions 
occurring at a lower frequency and considered clinically important included aphasia and 
encephalopathy (4.3% each). 
The biomarker  analyses suggested that the iiNT method may provide better specificity of neurotoxicity 
events in comparison to the Neurologic Toxicity – Focused and Neurologic Toxicity – Broad methods. 
The iiNT method, the primary  safety assessment for neurotoxicity in Study MM-001, is the same 
approach being used for ongoing ide-cel clinical studies. 
Cytopenias 
Almost all patients in the pivotal study (96.9%, 95.7% in the pooled analysis), had cytopenia 
(anaemia, lymphopenia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia or pancytopenia) first 8 weeks and most of 
them were of Grade 3 or 4, none of Grade 5. After first 8 weeks, 50% still had cytopenias, of which 
35.2% were of Grade 3 or 4. No cases of Grade 5 cytopenia were reported, but several subjects had 
persistent neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia at death or loss of follow-up (cutoff date 16 Oct 
2019). There was no clear dose dependent increase in frequency of cytopenia with increasing dose 
across the targeted dose levels of 300 and 450 x 106. The frequency was in general higher for the 
lowest dose of 150 x 106, but there were few subjects treated with this dose, so the interpretation of 
safety profile at this dose level is uncertain. The frequency of cytopenia overall was a bit lower in the 
supportive study (92.9%).  
In the pooled analysis, Neutropenia AEs were reported for 94.0% subjects, and almost all (169 
[91.8%]) had ≥ 1 Grade 3 or 4 Cytopenia. Roughly one third (34.8%) of these subjects had persistent 
neutropenia, where the median time to recovery in these subjects was 1.9 months (range: 1.2 to 5.6). 
For 11 of 62 subjects, their persistent Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia did not recover. Of these patients, 
9/11 died and 2/11 were lost to follow-up. It is likely that the cytopenias are derived from the LDC, 
and therefore it is difficult to compare  the frequencies between other CAR-T therapies due to 
differences in patient populations and different treatments.  
Based on cutoff date 07 Apr  2020, the pooled analysis, 34.8% of the 178 subjects who had Grade 3 or 
4 neutropenia and 72.7% of the 110 subjects who had Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia during the first 
month following ide-cel infusion had not resolved by last assessment during the first month. Among 
the 62 subjects with neutropenia not resolved by Month 1, 82.3% recovered from Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia with a median time to recovery from ide-cel infusion of 1.9 months. Of the 80 subjects 
with thrombocytopenia not resolved by Month 1, 71.3% recovered from Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia with the median time to recovery of 2.2 months. 
Febrile neutropenia (Grade 3 or 4) was observed in 14.7% of subjects after ide-cel infusion and may 
be concurrent with CRS. 
Cytopenias were the most frequently reported AESI that the investigators considered related to both 
LDC or ide-cel on or after ide-cel infusion, though the frequency was higher for those related to LDC 
compared to those related to ide-cel. Cytopenias are common in advanced MM patients, especially a 
heavily pretreated population and as such, it is difficult to ascertain the relative effect of LDC and ide-
cel on cytopenias. In patients treated with CAR T cell therapy and LDC, both can impact early and late 
cytopenia. Though LDC is one of the contributing factors to early and late cytopenias, they are likely 
driven by multiple aetiologies based on data from CAR T cell products in other malignancies (Fried, 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 125/164 
 
 
 
 
2019; Munshi, 2012; Brudno, 2016; Schaefer, 2019). The high frequency of cytopenias and persistent 
cytopenias can be considered expected in this heavily pre-treated patient population with several 
previous treatment modalities.  
Cytopenias were managed primarily  with the use of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), RBC 
transfusions, and platelet transfusions. Most subjects (87.5%) received CSFs (e.g., filgrastim and 
pegfilgrastim) during the study for management of neutropenia. 
Infections 
Infections are usually a complication to cytopenias and was observed in 68.8% in the pivotal study, in 
70.7% in pooled analysis. The most frequently (≥ 5% of subjects) reported infections in the pooled 
analysis were upper respiratory  tract infection (20.7%), pneumonia (9.8%), urinary tract infection 
(9.2%), influenza (6.5%), sinusitis (6.0%), and nasopharyngitis (5.4%) (cutoff date 16 Oct 2019) . 
The frequencies were almost the same across the dose levels, but highest at dose 150 x 106 CAR+ T 
cells (75.0%, in the pivotal study, 72.7% in the pooled analysis. The frequencies of infections did not 
change much over time: 39.1% of subjects within the first 8 weeks, 24.6% of subjects > 8 to ≤ 16 
weeks after infusion, and 30.1% of subjects > 16 weeks to ≤ 6 months after infusion. Nor did the 
frequency of Grade 3 or 4 infections change much over time: 6.0% in the first 8 weeks, 9.1% of 
subjects > 8 to ≤ 16 weeks, and 6.2% of subjects > 16 weeks to ≤ 6 months, and 7.7% of subjects > 6 
months after infusion. Five (2.7%) subjects had Infection AEs that led to death (Grade 5). These were 
pneumonia (2 [1.6%] subjects) and bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, pneumonia cytomegaloviral, and 
sepsis, (1 [0.5%] subject each). In Study MM-001, bacterial infections were reported for 14.8% of 
subjects, viral infections for 27.3%, fungal infections for 7.8% of subjects and Infections with 
unspecified pathogen were reported for 48.4% of subjects.  
Almost all subjects (99.5%) received anti-infectives for systemic use as concomitant therapy, primarily 
antibiotics (96.2%) and antivirals (95.7%) with 54.3% of subjects receiving antimycotics.  
Data based on cutoff date 07 Apr 2020: Infections (overall) occurred in 71.2% of subjects. Grade 3 or 
4 infections with an unspecified pathogen occurred in 17.9%, viral infections in 7.1%, bacterial 
infections in 3.8%, and fungal infections in 0.5% of subjects; no subject had a Grade 3 or 4 fungal 
infection. Fatal (Grade 5) infections of unspecified pathogen were reported in 1.6% of subjects, and 
0.5% of subjects had a fatal fungal or viral infection. 
Overall, the observed high frequency of infections - including even opportunistic infections as seen in 
the treated patients - are expected in subjects with MM who have been heavily pre-treated and have 
received LDC prior  to Abecma treatment. The similar frequencies of infections and Grade 3-5 infections 
across different Abecma doses can be considered expected, as all the patients have received the same 
LDC.  
Macrophage activation syndrome (PT of haemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) was reported for 4 
subjects in in study MM-001: 1 (1.4%) subject who received ide-cel at a target dose of 300 x 106 
CAR+ T cells and 3 (3.3%) subjects who received ide-cel at a target dose of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells. 
Two of the 4 subjects had a Grade 4 MAS. All 4 events were reported within the first 8 weeks after 
infusion. No cases were seen in the supportive study. 
Hypogammaglobulineaemia was reported in 26 subjects (20.3%) in study MM-001. The frequency 
was 25.0%, 20.0% and 20.4% across the target dose levels 150, 300, and 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, 
respectively. The frequencies were a bit lower in the supportive study, but also in this study it was 
highest at the lowest dose. Hypogammaglobulinaemia  was reported in 19.6% of patients treated with 
Abecma in the pooled studies with a median time to onset of 100 days (range 15 to 326). Monitoring 
and management guidance on this adverse event is included in the SmPC.

Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) was reported for 1 (0.5%) subject in the supportive Study CRB-401 
following a dose of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells. 
The presence of Replication Competent Lentivirus was not detected.   
Secondary malignancies 
In the pooled analysis (N =184), across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, no 
secondary malignancies from insertional oncogenesis have been reported after ide-cel infusion, 
including initial infusion and retreatment, as of the data cutoff date of 07 Apr 2020.  
Other secondary malignancies (not of T cell origin) were reported for 17 (9.2%) of 184 ide-cel-treated 
subjects after ide-cel infusion, including initial infusion and retreatment. These secondary malignancies 
were basal cell carcinoma (6 subjects); myelodysplastic syndrome (3 subjects); Bowen’s disease (2 
subjects); and anal cancer, bladder cancer, breast cancer, lung adenocarcinoma, malignant melanoma, 
plasmablastic lymphoma,  and squamous cell carcinoma (1 subject each). One subject in Study CRB-
401 had multiple malignancies of both basal cell skin carcinoma and bladder cancer.  
Secondary malignancies were reported for 2 subjects within the first 8 weeks after initial infusion and 
for 15 subjects > 8 weeks after initial infusion.  
Except for plasmablastic lymphoma and myelodysplastic syndrome (1 subject each), other secondary 
malignancies were considered unrelated to ide-cel. The investigator assessed the plasmablastic 
lymphoma (Grade 4 with an onset 110 days after ide-cel retreatment [250 days after initial ide cel 
infusion]) and myelodysplastic syndrome (Grade 4 with an onset 369 days after initial ide-cel infusion) 
as possibly related to ide-cel. 
Secondary malignancies were reported more frequently in subjects who were ADA positive after initial 
ide-cel infusion (8/68 subjects [11.8%]), primarily  basal cell carcinoma (5/68 subjects [7.4%]), 
compared to ADA negative subjects (1/59 subjects [1.7%]). All subjects with secondary malignancies 
in Study MM-001 had at least 9 months of follow-up from ide-cel infusion independent of ADA status. 
Based on the longer follow-up observed in these subjects, the likelihood of falling in the ADA-positive 
group was higher, consistent with the observed data.     
Ide-cel manufacturing leads to high vector copy number (VCN) / cell as compared to approved CAR T 
cell products. The release criteria for VCN are proposed to be broad, allowing a VCN of up to 15. High 
VCN may be a potential concern for insertional mutagenicity resulting in development of secondary 
malignancies in subjects with long-term survival. The applicant has indicated that based on the 
published literature, in vitro characterisation studies, clinical manufacturing data, nonclinical studies, 
and available updated clinical safety data in 184 subjects from Studies MM-001 and CRB-401 who 
received ide-cel therapy across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, VCN does not 
appear to be a risk factor for the development of secondary malignancies, which is the key AE 
mediated by insertional oncogenesis. With the more recent data cutoff date of 07 Apr 2020, 6 tumour 
samples sufficient for evaluation were available and received from 5 of the 17 subjects who reported 
secondary malignancies. All 6 tumour samples were negative for CAR transgene in Studies MM-001 
and CRB-401. 
AEs in retreated subjects 
For subjects who received ide-cel retreatment, AEs that occurred following lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy (LDC) for retreatment and after ide-cel retreatment were analysed separately from 
those following initial treatment and thus were not included in the primary  safety analyses. 
There was a trend in lower frequency of AEs in the retreated subjects. In the pivotal study a total of 23 
(85.2%) subjects had at least 1 AE assessed by the investigator as related to ide-cel following the 
Assessment report

retreatment infusion. The most frequently reported related events after ide-cel retreatment (≥ 20% of 
subjects) were neutropenia (59.3%), CRS (51.9%), anaemia (44.4%), thrombocytopenia (29.6%), 
and leukopenia (22.2%). Similar  frequencies were observed in the supportive study where 70.6% of 
retreated subjects had at least 1 AE considered related to the ide-cel retreatment, CRS in 35.3% of 
subjects and neurological toxicity (“focused”) in 41.2% of subjects. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other  significant events 
Serious adverse events (SAEs) 
A summary of SAEs reported for ≥ 2% of subjects on or after Abecma infusion in Studies MM-001 and 
CRB-401 is presented by SOC and PT in Table below (cuttoff date 16 Oct 2019). 
Table 33: Serious Adverse Events by System Organ Class and Preferred  Term Reported for at 
Least 2% of Subjects

Page 128/164 
 
 
 
 
 
In the pivotal study 67.2% (69.0% in the pooled analysis) of subjects across the targeted dose levels 
had ≥1 SAE.  The most frequently reported (≥ 5%) SAE was CRS (17.2%, 17.4% in pooled analysis), 
followed by general physical health deterioration (10.2%, 9.2% in pooled analysis), pneumonia (8.6%, 
6.5% in pooled analysis) and febrile neutropenia (7.0%, 6.0% in pooled analysis). Overall, the 
frequencies of subjects with SAEs were high (100%, 62.9% and 70.4% in the pivotal study, 77.3%, 
62.9% and 71.7% in the pooled analysis) across the target dose levels 150, 300 and 450 x106 CAR+ T 
cells respectively. 
In the pivotal study a total 44.5% (44.6% pooled analysis) of subjects had SAEs reported within the 
first 8 weeks and 43.4% (45.5% in pooled analysis) of subjects had SAEs reported > 8 weeks after 
infusion. All SAEs of CRS and C-reactive protein (CRP) increased were reported within the first 8 weeks 
after infusion. 
Serious Adverse Events in the First 8 Weeks Across the Target Dose Levels by Period 
An analysis of SAEs reported within the first 8 weeks by discrete time period (≤ 1 week, > 1 week to ≤ 
2 weeks, > 2 weeks to ≤ 4 weeks, and > 4 weeks to ≤ 8 weeks after ide-cel infusion) is presented in 
table below. As noted above there were no SAEs reported from the infections and infestations SOC 
within the first week, while 2 subjects (1.1%) experienced an infection and infestation SAE between > 
1 to ≤ 2 weeks, and 7 subjects each (3.8%) experienced an infection and infestation SAE during the 
latter 2 time periods. Otherwise, there were no consistent trends of SAEs occurring during the discrete 
time periods, and no clinically meaningful conclusions of SAE occurrence by discrete time period can be 
made.

With few exceptions, most AEs and Grade 3 or 4 AEs are reported during the first week following ide-
cel infusion. A notable exception was hypogammaglobulinaemia, which has a later onset beyond the

first 2 weeks. The majority of events of CRS occurred within the first week. In the analysis of events 
reported in the first 8 weeks after ide-cel infusion, the cumulative frequency of events across time 
periods generally remains the same or slightly increases, as any subject with data for the first period is 
also included throughout the other 3 periods.  
The updated data presented with a cutoff date of 07 Apr  2020, confirm that the majority of 
hospitalisations happen during the early postinfusion period, and adverse events were reported as the 
main reason for most hospitalisations. Within the seriousness criteria of inpatient hospitalisation or 
prolongation of existing hospitalisation, the most commonly reported AEs were CRS (15.6%), 
pneumonia (9.4%), and febrile neutropenia (7.0%).  
The results of subgroup analyses of hospitalisation (including those for target dose, ECOG PS, and age 
subgroups) were generally consistent with those of the overall MM-001 ide-cel-treated population. The 
median duration of hospitalisation for the subgroups generally ranged from 4 to 6 days.  
The results of these analyses did not show any unexpected findings, and the data presented do not 
have any implications for SmPC 
Serious AEs in retreated subjects 
In total 44 subjects in the pivotal study and the supportive study were retreated (cutoff date 16 Oct 
2019) Serious adverse events occurred in 11 (64.7%) retreated subjects, but only 3 (17.6%) subjects 
had SAEs considered related to ide-cel by the investigator (cough, pyrexia,  neurotoxicity, and CRS in 1 
subject each).  
Death /grade 5 AEs 
In Study MM-001, 34 (26.6%) deaths (all causes) were reported for subjects who received Abecma 
(including treatment and retreatment), see table below.  Of the 34 deaths, 25 deaths occurred after 
initial Abecma infusion and 9 deaths occurred after retreatment.  The investigator attributed most of 
the 34 deaths to the primary  cause of death category of malignant disease under study or complication 
due to malignant disease under study (24 [18.8%] subjects), and most of these deaths were due to 
plasma cell myeloma  (21 [16.4%] subjects). 
In Study CRB-401, 14 (25.0%) deaths were reported (including initial treatment and retreatment). Of 
the 14 deaths, 8 occurred after initial infusion and 6 occurred after retreatment. Thus, in the pooled 
analysis, 33/48 deaths occurred after initial Abecma  infusion and 15 deaths occurred after 
retreatment.

Grade 5 (fatal) AEs were reported in 22 (17.2%, 15.8% in the pooled analysis) subjects. The most 
frequently reported Grade 5 AEs in the pivotal study was general physical health deterioration (13 
[10.2%] subjects), followed by pneumonia (2 [1.6%] subjects). All other Grade 5 AEs were reported 
for 1 [0.8%] subject each: bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, CRS, disease progression, gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage, pneumonia cytomegaloviral, respiratory  failure, and sepsis. The one subject with Grade 
5 CRS (fatal) had been treated with a dose of 300 x 106 CAR+T cells. 
Death in retreated subjects 
As of 07 Apr  2020, 47 subjects received ide-cel retreatment, which includes 29 subjects from Study 
MM-001 and 18 subjects from Study CRB-401. All but 1 subject were initially treated with ide-cel at 
target dose levels of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells; 1 subject in Study CRB-401 initially received ide-
cel at a target dose of 800 x 106 CAR+ T cells. Of all of those that were retreated at target dose levels 
of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, 20 subjects have died. Nineteen of the 20 subjects who died

following ide-cel retreatment had documented disease progression following ide-cel retreatment; 13 of 
these 20 subjects received at least 1 subsequent AMT following documented disease progression and 
prior  to death. 
The investigators attributed the primary  cause of death category as due to adverse event (AE) in 4 
retreated subjects, of which 1 each was due to PTs of fungal infection, mucormycosis, respiratory  tract 
infection, and subdural hematoma. 
In review of the 20 deaths in retreated subjects by time period, 3 subjects died within the first 8 weeks 
after the retreatment infusion (all due to malignant disease under study/plasma cell myeloma),  8 
subjects died after 8 weeks through 6 months, 8 died after 6 months through 24 months, and 1 died 
after 24 months. 
There were no new safety signals identified regarding deaths after retreatment compared to deaths 
after initial infusion based on updated data with cutoff date 07 Apr 2020. 
Laboratory  findings 
Shifts in haematology, blood chemistry, and coagulation laboratory parameters  were generally 
consistent with the reported AE profile of Abecma across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 x 106 
CAR+ T cells. 
The most frequently reported shifts from baseline in the haematology laboratory parameters  were to 
low values post-baseline (decrease). The shifts in haematology laboratory parameters  were generally 
consistent with the reported hematologic AEs, except for leukopenia, which was reported as a Grade 4 
AE for 32.6% of subjects. 
Shifts in chemistry laboratory  parameters from Grade 0 to 2 at baseline to Grade 3 post-baseline were 
reported for < 10% of subjects, most frequently reported for Hb (73.4%).  Shifts from Grade 0 to 3 at 
baseline to Grade 4 were reported for < 4% of subjects, most frequently reported for lymphocytes 
(99.2%), leukocytes and neutrophils (86.5% each), and platelets (49.2%).  
Shifts in hepatic and renal function, electrolytes, and metabolic laboratory  parameters  were generally 
consistent with the reported AE profile:  
•  Hepatic function: Increased: Alanine aminotransferase (ALT increased) 8.7%, Alkaline 
phosphatase (ALP increased) 5.4%, Aspartate aminotransferase (AST increased) 5.4% and 
Bilirubin (hyperbilirubinaemia) 4.9%. Decreased: Albumin (hypoalbuminaemia): 7.1%   
•  Renal function: Creatinine (creatinine increased) 1.1%. 
•  Electrolytes: Increased: Magnesium (hypermagnesemia) 2.8%.  Decreased: Calcium corrected 
(hypocalcaemia) 2.3%, Phosphate (hypophosphataemia) 37.4%, Potassium (hypokalaemia) 
7.6% and Sodium (hyponatremia) 10.5%. 
•  Metabolism: Increased: Creatine kinase (CK increased) 1.1% and Glucose (hyperglycaemia) 
7.1%. Decreased: Glucose (hypoglycaemia) 0.5%. 
Inflammatory Markers: Mean CRP levels were increased at baseline, continued to increase to Day 2 
(consistent with the median time to onset for CRS), and then decreased steadily thereafter. Mean 
ferritin levels were increased at baseline, continued to increase until Day 7, and then decreased 
steadily thereafter.

Coagulation: Increase: Activated partial  thromboplastin time (aPTT increased) in 10.6%, INR increased 
1.6% and Fibrinogen (hyperfibrinogenaemia) none subjects. Decrease: Fibrinogen 
(hypofibrinogenaemia) 2.7%. 
Safety in special populations 
Age: The specified AE categories (all grades) reported on or after initial ide-cel infusion across the 
target dose levels of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells are presented by the requested age subgroups in 
Table below. Of the 184 subjects included in the pooled analysis, the majority (118 [64.1%]) were < 
65 years old, 61 (33.2%) were 65 to < 75 years old, and 5 (2.7%) were 75 to < 85 years old. No 
subjects 85 years of age or older were enrolled in Studies MM-001 or CRB-401; therefore, this age 
subgroup is not relevant for inclusion in this analysis.

The only difference among age categories <65 and 65- to < 75-year-old subgroup were seen in AEs in 
SOC Cardiac disorders (PT oedema peripheral) and SOC Vascular disorders (hypertension) and for the 
PT pyrexia. 
From the table overview based on SOCs, it can be seen an overall small increased frequency in AEs in 
almost all SOCs in the subgroups 65 to <75 years of age and 75 to <85 years of age compared to the 
age group <65 years old..

No consistent trends in the AE profile were observed that would suggest clinically meaningful effect by 
age group. Adverse events reported with ≥ 10% higher frequency for subjects ≥ 65 compared with 
subjects < 65 years were fatigue (47.0% versus 34.7%), oedema peripheral (28.8% versus 15.3%), 
and hypertension (19.7% versus 8.5%). Grade 3 or 4 AEs reported with ≥ 5% higher frequency for 
subjects ≥ 65 compared with subjects < 65 years were Grade 3 or 4 hematologic AEs of anaemia 
(66.7% versus 53.4%), leukopenia (50.0% versus 42.4%), lymphopenia (36.4% versus 27.1%), and 
neutrophil count decreased (6.1% versus 0.8%) and non-hematologic AEs of fatigue (7.6% versus 
0.8%) and hypertension (10.6% versus 2.5%). Serious AEs: Confusional state was the only serious AE 
reported with ≥ 5% higher frequency for subjects ≥ 65 compared with subjects < 65 years (6.1% 
versus 0%). Overall, SAEs were reported with ≥ 5% higher frequency for subjects ≥ 65 years compared 
with subjects < 65 years (77.3% versus 64.4%, pooled analysis). However,  no dose adjustment has 
been suggested for patients over 65 years of age. 
AESIs/Selected AEs: Infections – Pathogen Unspecified AEs were reported with ≥ 10% higher frequency 
for subjects < 65 years compared with subjects ≥ 65 years (58.5% versus 43.9%, pooled analysis). 
Sex: There was a higher frequency of CRS reported as an SAE for female compared with male subjects 
(23.6% versus 13.4%). 
Race: Most subjects (83.2%, 153/184 subjects) were white.  
Ethnicity: Most subjects (84.8%, 156/184 subjects) were not Hispanic/Latino. The data available is 
too small to look at trends in other ethnic groups. 
Anti-CD38 Antibody Refractory: Most subjects (91.8%, 169/184) subjects were anti-CD38 antibody 
refractory.   
Tumour BCMA Expression at Baseline: There were 22 subjects with < 50% BCMA+ expression and 
139 subjects with ≥ 50% BCMA+ expression at baseline. Although numerical differences in the 
frequencies of subjects with AEs, Grade 3 or 4 AEs, SAEs, and AESIs/selected AEs were observed, no 
consistent trends in the AE profile were observed that would suggest a clinically meaningful effect by 
baseline tumour BCMA+ expression.  
Tumour Burden at Baseline: There were 88 subjects with low tumour burden (BM CD138+ plasma 
cells < 50%) and 89 subjects with high tumour burden (BM CD138+ plasma cells ≥ 50%) at baseline. 
Serious AEs were reported for 61.4% of subjects with low tumour burden at baseline and for 76.4% of 
subjects with high tumour burden at baseline. Adverse events, Grade 3 or 4 AEs, and AESI/selected 
AEs of thrombocytopenia and serious CRS were reported more frequently for subjects with high tumour 
burden compared with subjects with low tumour burden at baseline.  
Bridging Antimyeloma Therapies (AMT): Different AMTs used are well known for a wide spectrum 
of AEs. It will in general be difficult to differ or interpret what AEs are related to the bridging/LDP 
therapy and ide-cel infusion. There was no clear trend, but leucopenia and transaminases increased 
were among AEs more  frequent in those not being exposed for bridging AMT. There were no notable 
differences in the overall frequency of Grade 3 or 4 AEs between subjects who received and those who 
had not received bridging AMTs. Serious AEs were reported for 71.8% of subjects who received 
bridging AMTs and 59.5% of subjects who had not received bridging AMTs. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation: There are no available data with ide-cel use in pregnant women. 
No animal reproductive and developmental toxicity studies have been conducted with idecabtagene 
vicleucel to assess whether it can cause foetal harm when administered to a pregnant woman. It is not 
known if idecabtagene vicleucel has the potential to be transferred to the foetus. Based on the 
mechanism of action, if the transduced cells cross the placenta, they may cause foetal toxicity, 
including plasma cell aplasia or hypogammaglobulinaemia. Relevant warnings on this matter are

reflected in the SmPC. There is no information regarding the presence of ide-cel in human milk, the 
effect on the breastfed infant, and the effects on milk production. Relevant warnings are included in 
the SmPC. 
Immunological  events 
Idecabtagene vicleucel construct 
The CAR is comprised of a BCMA-specific murine extracellular single-chain variable fragment followed 
by a human CD8α hinge and transmembrane domain fused to the cytoplasmic signalling domains of 
CD137 (4-1BB) and CD3ζ chain, in tandem. Autologous T cells transduced ex vivo with the anti-
BCMA02 CAR LVV  express the anti-BCMA CAR on the T cell surface (see illustration of construct below).  
Sampling  
Potential immunogenicity to ide-cel was evaluated by determining both humoral as well as cell-
mediated responses. Serum samples collected from subjects post-infusion were evaluated for the 
formation of antidrug antibodies (ADAs) using an immunoassay designed and validated to detect 
antibodies to the extracellular CAR domain. Cell-mediated immune responses were evaluated using an 
Interferon-gamma ELISPOT assay that was performed on PBMCs derived from subjects.  
Antidrug antibody formation 
In both studies, the proportion of ADA-evaluated subjects who were ADA-positive increased over time 
from month 3.

Effect of antidrug antibody on pharmacokinetics – MM-001 study 
Of 127 subjects evaluable for PK, exposure parameters  for five subjects who were ADA-positive prior 
to ide-cel infusion, were generally comparable  to the PK parameters  of all subjects treated at the 
respective dose level.  
A total of 65 subjects had at least one sample  with detectable ADAs post-infusion. The geometric mean 
Cmax and AUC0-28 days for subjects who had at least one visit with detectable ADA post-infusion (pooled 
across dose levels) was 280,862 (131%) copies/μg and 3,433,112 (141%) copies*days/μg, 
respectively. These values are comparable to the overall geometric mean Cmax of 231,278 (178%) 
copies/μg and AUC0-28days of 2,860,340 (197%) copies*days/μg, respectively, observed in subjects 
irrespective of ADA status. 
ADA formation versus selected efficacy endpoints in study MM-001 
Among the 65 subjects in the ide-cel-treated population who were post-positive for ADAs (these 
include also the five subjects who were pre-positive as of the 16 Oct 2019 data cut-off date), the ORR 
based on IRC assessments was 89.2% (95% CI: 79.1, 95.6) and the CR rate was 41.5% (95% CI: 
29.4, 54.4). Among the 62 subjects who were post-negative for ADAs, the ORR was 58.1% (95% CI: 
44.8, 70.5) and the CR rate was 21.0% (95% CI: 11.7, 33.2). Median TTR  was 1.0 month regardless 
of whether or not ADAs developed after ide-cel infusion. 
Assessment report

A KM estimate for median PFS was 11.3 months (95% CI: 8.9, 12.2) among subjects who were post-
positive for ADAs versus 4.9 months (95% CI: 2.9, 8.2) among subjects who were post-negative for 
ADAs.  
The KM estimate for median DoR was 10.7 months (95% CI: 9.2, 11.3) among responders who were 
post-positive for ADAs versus 10.3 months (95% CI: 5.0, NE) among responders who were post-
negative for ADAs. 
Antidrug Antibody formation versus selected safety endpoints in study MM-001 
Among the 65 subjects in the ide-cel-treated population who were post-positive for ADAs, 59 (90.8%) 
had CRS on or after ide-cel infusion. Among the 62 subjects in the ide-cel-treated population who were 
post-negative for ADAs, 47 (75.8%) had CRS on or after ide-cel infusion.  
Among subjects who were post-positive for ADAs, the frequency of CRS AEs was 100% at the target 
dose of 450 x 106 CAR+T cells versus 84.2% at the target dose of 300 x 106 CAR+T cells. Among 
subjects who were post-negative for ADAs, the frequency of CRS AEs was 92.9% at the target dose of 
450 x 106 CAR+T cells versus 64.5% at the target dose of 300 x 106 CAR+T cells.  
Among the 65 subjects in the ide-cel-treated population who were post-positive for ADAs, 9 (13.8%) 
had iiNT events on or after ide-cel infusion. Among the 62 subjects in the ide-cel-treated population 
who were post-negative for ADAs, 13 (21.0%) had iiNT events on or after ide-cel infusion. 
Among subjects who were post-positive for ADAs, the frequency of iiNT events was 11.5% at the 
target dose of 450 x 106 CAR+T cells versus 15.8% at the target dose of 300 x 106 CAR+ T cells.  
Among subjects who were post-negative for ADAs, the frequency of iiNT events was 28.6% at the 
target dose of 450 x 106 CAR+T cells versus 16.1% at the target dose of 300 x 106 CAR+T cells.  
Development of positive ADA post-ide-cel infusion did not increase the frequency or severity of CRS or 
iiNT. 
Immunogenicity in study CRB-401 
In Study CRB-401, there were 5.4% subjects across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+T 
cells who had pre-existing ADAs before infusion of ide-cel. The immunogenicity analyses were 
performed using a data cut-off date of 22 Jul 2019.  
The proportion of subjects who were ADA-positive increased over time: 5.2% at Month 1, 39.6% at 
Month 3, 64.9% at Month 6, 69.2% at Month 9, and 83.3% at Month 12. 
PK–data from the CRB-401 study, indicated that ADA development is not going to impact cellular 
expansion of ide-cel, since the majority of which occurred in the first month after infusion, and the 
ADAs developed firstly after about three months. These results are supporting data from the MM-001 
study. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions  and other interactions 
Ide-cel is a cellular product that is not cleared by the usual mechanisms that apply to small molecules 
or antibodies. No drug-drug interaction studies have been performed. 
Discontinuation  due to adverse events 
As ide-cel is a single-dose treatment, no adverse events (AEs) leading to treatment discontinuation 
were reported. Therefore, an analysis of AEs leading to treatment discontinuation in these studies was 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 139/164 
 
 
 
not conducted. Reasons for discontinuing study participation (rather than treatment discontinuation) 
were recorded. No ide-cel-treated subjects in Studies MM-001 or CRB-401 discontinued the studies due 
to an AE after starting lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC) but prior to receiving ide-cel, and no ide-
cel-treated subjects discontinued the studies due to an AE. 
In study MM-001 a total of 58 (45.3%) of the 128 ide-cel-treated subjects discontinued from different 
phases of the study after initial infusion. The most common reasons were reported as death (31 
subjects [24.2%]) and withdrawal by subject (26 subjects [20.3%]). Of the 27 subjects who 
discontinued the study due to reasons other than death, 5 subjects entered the LTFU study (GC-LTFU-
001) for continued follow-up. 
Although there were 26 withdrawals by subject, only 2 subjects were censored for PFS due to 
discontinuing study without PD/death. Of the 27 subjects who discontinued the study due to reasons 
other than death, 5 subjects entered the LTFU study (GC-LTFU-001) for continued follow-up. 
In study CRB-401 Forty (71.4%) subjects discontinued the study. The most commonly reported reason 
for discontinuation was PD (27 [48.2%] subjects); 6 (10.7%) subjects died, 6 (10.7%) subjects 
withdrew consent, and 1 (1.8%) subject discontinued due to other reasons. Of the 34 subjects who 
discontinued the study due to reasons other than death, 21 subjects entered the LTFU study (GC-
LTFU-001 or LTF-305) for continued follow-up. 
Post marketing  experience 
No post-marketing data are available at this time 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, the AEs observed are anticipated toxicities consistent with the mechanism of action of CAR T 
cell therapies with main safety concerns related to CRS, neurological toxicity and cytopenias. With 
proper  use of management guidance and use of proposed additional risk minimisation measures 
(controlled distribution programme  including HCP educational programme  and a patient educational 
programme),  these safety concerns should be manageable across all dose levels. The safety looks in 
general similar  to the safety profile known for other CAR-T products. 
The safety assessment is based on 184 subjects and the majority  of subjects included are <65 years of 
age. Based on the number of subjects exposed, only common AEs have been detected. In addition, the 
single arm study brings uncertainties in the safety assessment and does not allow separation of AEs 
attributable to Abecma vs. e.g., lymphodepleting chemotherapy (LDC).  
A non-interventional, post authorisation, registry-based study (BB2121-MM-006) is proposed to further 
characterise the incidence and severity of ADRs.  
The patient population consists of heavily pre-treated patients with relapsed/refractory MM and who 
have previously been exposed to a wide range of available therapies. Based on baseline characteristics 
the patients can be considered to represent a very special population of MM patients being younger 
and having good performance status.  
The short follow-up time (15.5 months for the pooled analysis of the pivotal study and the supportive 
study) means that long-term safety cannot be assessed, and therefore more long-term follow-up data 
from other studies are required to be able to assess long-term safety of the product. Particular 
concerns in this respect are secondary malignancies and long-term neurological AEs, many of which 
were still ongoing at the data cut-off date. A 15 years follow-up of patients that have been included in 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 140/164 
 
 
 
the clinical trials (Long-term follow-up study GC-LTFU-001) are proposed together with the registry 
study (BB2121-MM-006) to monitor long-term safety.  
General description of the safety data 
AEs were generally similar  across the target dose levels. The frequency of subjects with SAEs and AEs 
leading to death varied across the target dose levels, although no dose-response is evident. However, 
regarding doses, in the pivotal study there were only 4 (and in the pooled dataset 22) subjects in the 
150 x 106 CAR+ T dose group. Therefore, it is impossible to make conclusions for the B/R for the lower 
dose.    
Cytokine Release Syndrome and Macrophage Activation Syndrome 
CRS was seen in 81.0% in the pooled analysis of subjects with increasing frequency with increasing 
dose. CRS occurs in the first days following treatment, median time to onset was 1.0 day (range: 1 to 
17 days) and the median duration was 5.0 days (range: 1 to 63). The median time to onset was 
shorter and the median duration was longer for the highest dose level. All cases were observed within 
first 8 weeks following ide-cel infusion. CRS was the most common SAE reported, 17.2% and 17.9% of 
subjects in study MM 001 and CRB-401, respectively. No clear predisposing or preventive medications 
or conditions concerning CRS could be identified by the applicant, except the Abecma dose. Further 
investigations on this topic are considered important  in context of ongoing and planned clinical studies. 
A proper management guide, including treatment with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids, was used in 
the clinical trials and is also included in the SmPC. 
MAS is a very rare and potentially life-threatening condition. MAS was reported for 4 (3.1%) subjects 
in MM-001 study: 1 (1.4%) subject at a target dose of 300x 106 CAR+ T cells and 3 (3.3%) subjects 
at a target dose of 450x 106 CAR+ T cells. Two of the 4 subjects had a Grade 4 MAS. 
Neurologic toxicity 
Neurologic AEs were reported in 18.0% (iiNT), 39.1% (focused method) and 68.0% (broad method) of 
subjects as reflected by the three different methods of reporting. It is not clear what method of 
reporting neurotoxicity is the most optimal  or what method is most comparable  to how neurotoxicity is 
reported in other CAR-T products. However, as the iiNT method is the approach being used for ongoing 
ide-cel clinical studies with ide-cel, it will be useful to have these data from the pivotal study available 
in the SmPC and RMP documents.  Nevertheless, independent of investigator attribution of 
neurotoxicity, neurologic or psychiatric adverse reactions have been reported as indicated by the data 
in the safety section above.  
The exclusion criteria include several criteria to mitigate the risk of neurotoxicity. Patients with CNS 
involvement or CNS pathologies were excluded from the study. No contraindications are currently 
proposed.  
Overall, based on limited data and a different target patient population, the neurological events 
reported with ide-cel are comparable  to those reported with other products in the same class. 
Neurological events were also long-lasting, or ongoing at the data cut-off, which emphasises the need 
for follow-up of these events in long-term studies.   
A proper management guide including treatment with tocilizumab or corticosteroids, was used in the 
clinical trials and is also included in the SmPC.   
Cytopenias 
Almost all patients in 95,7% in the pooled analysis had cytopenia first 8 weeks and most of them were 
of Grade 3 or 4, none of Grade 5. Patients may exhibit prolonged cytopenias following lymphodepleting 
chemotherapy and ide-cel infusion.  
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 141/164 
 
 
 
There was no clear dose dependent increase in frequency of cytopenia with increasing dose across the 
dose levels of 300 and 450 x 106. The frequency was in general higher for the lowest dose of 150 x 
106. Cytopenias were managed primarily  with the use of CSFs, RBC transfusions, and platelet 
transfusions.  
It is likely that the cytopenias are derived from the LDC, and therefore it is difficult to compare  the 
frequencies between other CAR-T therapies due to differences in patient populations and different 
treatments. This persistent neutropenia needs to be further followed up in further studies and also in 
other lines of treatment outside R/R MM. 
The high frequency of cytopenias and persistent cytopenias can be considered expected in this heavily 
treated patient population. As LDC was an instrumental part of the treatment, given only few days 
before ide-cel-treatment, it is obviously impossible  to evaluate, how much these cytopenia (or other 
AEs) were related to ide-cel and how much to LDC.  
Infections 
Overall, the observed high frequency of infections - including the opportunistic infections - as seen in 
the treated patients - are expected in subjects with MM who have been heavily pretreated and have 
received LDC prior  to ide-cel treatment. Further, the similar frequencies of infections and Grade 3-5 
infections across different ide-cel doses can be considered expected, as all the patients have received 
the same LDC. 
Secondary malignancies 
In the pooled analysis (N =184), across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 × 106 CAR+ T cells, no 
secondary malignancies from insertional oncogenesis have been reported after ide-cel infusion as of 
the data cutoff date of 07 Apr 2020.  
Other secondary malignancies (not of T cell origin) were reported for 17 (9.2%) of 184 ide-cel-treated 
subjects after ide-cel infusion, including initial infusion and retreatment.  
Secondary malignancies were reported more frequently in subjects who were ADA positive after initial 
ide-cel infusion, compared to ADA negative subjects (1/59 subjects [1.7%]). Outside of the 
confounding effect of follow-up times, no other biologic casual explanation for clustering of subjects 
with secondary malignancies in the ADA positive group was found. In addition to postmarketing 
surveillance, subjects in all ide-cel clinical studies will be monitored for potential delayed toxicities of 
gene therapy, which includes ADRs of secondary malignancies, for up to 15 years from last ide-cel 
infusion.   
Secondary malignancies are a well-known risk in MM patients. It has to be considered that patients 
treated in Study MM-001 have been exposed to a median of 6 previous treatments each potentially 
carrying attributable risk for secondary malignancies. Secondary malignancies from ide-cel are 
considered an important potential risk based on the theoretical risk of vector insertional mutagenesis 
leading to oncogenesis (Risk Management Plan). Importantly,  no insertional mutagenesis or 
malignancies of T cell origin have been reported or identified to date in the clinical study setting. 
All ide-cel-treated subjects will be asked to enrol in a separate LTFU study (GC-LTFU-001) to be 
monitored for survival and long-term safety effects, including secondary malignancies, for up to 15 
years from the last ide-cel infusion, as per health authority guidelines. In both the parent study or the 
LTFU study protocol,  testing for ide-cel transgene will be conducted on all secondary malignancies 
where tissue is available. 
A post-authorisation safety study (PASS),  BB2121-MM-006, is planned to be conducted following the 
grant of the MAA. This registry based study will characterise the incidence and severity of selected

adverse drug reactions, including secondary malignancies, in patients treated with ide-cel in the 
postmarketing setting and monitor for potential clinically important adverse events that have not yet 
been identified as part of the ide-cel safety profile. The applicant has informed that in the planned 
postmarketing surveillance study (PASS BB2121-MM-006) only secondary malignancies of T cell origin 
will be tested for ide-cel transgene, whereas in previous and ongoing clinical studies testing for ide-cel 
transgene is performed for all secondary malignancies. This is acceptable, as there would be no 
biological rational for how malignant cells of non T-cell origins could be positive for ide-cell transgene. 
In Study BB2121-MM-006, if a secondary malignancy of T cell origin occurs, testing for ide-cel 
transgene will be conducted on all secondary malignancies of T cell origin where tissue is available. 
Furthermore, SmPC Section 4.4 specifies that in the event that a secondary malignancy of T cell origin 
occurs, the company should be contacted to obtain instructions on the collection of patient samples for 
testing.  
Upon receipt of a report of secondary malignancy, a questionnaire directed to assist in characterizing 
the event will be sent to healthcare professionals. 
For the post-authorisation safety Study BB2121-MM-006, and postmarketing commercial  use, 
transgene testing will be conducted for all secondary malignancies of T cell origin where a tissue 
sample is available. The reporting health care professional will be asked for additional information to 
help characterize the report of secondary malignancy, including, but not limited to, history of prior 
malignancies, previous cancer therapies or radiotherapy, other relevant exposures, family history, and 
biopsy report.  The applicant will assist prescribers in coordinating transfer of tumour tissue samples 
from patients for ide-cel transgene testing. 
Deaths 
Overall, the incidence of deaths during the study was high. However, the death rate is understandable 
taking into account the heavily treated patient population with no further treatment options. In most 
cases, the cause of death was related to the baseline disease condition, one patient died due to CRS 
and few patients due to infections.  
Other safety findings 
Shifts in haematology, blood chemistry, and coagulation laboratory parameters  were generally 
consistent with the reported AE profile of ide-cel across the target dose levels of 150 to 450 x 106 
CAR+ T cells and were also generally consistent with the reported frequencies of hematologic AEs, 
except for leukopenia, which was reported as a Grade 4 AE for 28.1% of subjects. These laboratory 
findings can be considered expected in the current study population consisting of heavily pre-treated 
patients. There was no specific safety concern related to laboratory data presented. 
No relevant pharmacodynamic biomarkers  for safety have been identified. However, the development 
of PD biomarkers for safety and efficacy is considered to be of prime  importance and further work on 
this recommended.  
Except for CRS (female 23.6% versus 13.4% in male),  there were no notable differences in the 
frequency of subjects with Grade 3 or 4 AEs and SAEs for female and male subjects.  In general, based 
on the experiences so far, there seems to be no specific safety concern related to age groups. It is 
agreed though, that the number in subgroup ≥85 is very limited. Furthermore, the interpretation of 
safety in subjects in the 75- to < 85-year-old subgroup (N = 5) is limited, and it is difficult to make 
meaningful comparisons with the other age subgroups; thus, the results in this specific age 
subpopulation should be interpreted with caution.   
The data set available is too small to look for trends in other race groups. As well, data are too few to 
look for trends in subjects being not anti-CD38 antibody refractory at baseline.

Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the lentivirus used to make ide-cel have limited, short spans 
of identical genetic material (RNA). Therefore, some commercial  HIV nucleic acid tests may yield false-
positive results in patients who have received ide-cel. This is reflected in the SmPc section 4.4 with the 
subheading “Interference with serological testing”. 
The SmPC includes: The safety of immunisation with live vaccines during or following Abecma 
treatment has not been studied. Vaccination with live vaccines is not recommended for at least 6 
weeks prior  to the start of lymphodepleting chemotherapy, during ide-cel treatment, and until immune 
recovery following treatment with ide-cel. 
AEs in retreated subjects 
There is limited experience of retreating patients with a second dose of Abecma.  Responses after 
Abecma retreatment were infrequent and less durable when compared to initial treatment. 
Additionally, fatal outcomes were observed in retreated patients. this has been added as a warning in 
the SmPC. 
Immunogenicity 
ADAs are likely to be induced by the ide-cel construct in patients, since a murine BCMA-binding site is 
a central part.   
Available data suggest that the impact of pre-existing ADAs on cellular expansion is limited. However, 
a substantial number of patients generated post-infusion ADAs towards ide-cel (after three and 
monitored up to twelve months). At month 12, the fraction of patients present with ADAs were 62.1% 
in the MM-001 study and 80% in the CRB-401-study.  
Results showed that exposures (AUC0-28days; AUC0-3 months) were very similar between ADA-
positive and ADA-negative subjects. In addition, most antibodies were generated after about three 
months (both studies) and the majority of CAR+T cell expansion occurred in the first month after 
infusion. This may suggest that formation of ADAs following ide-cel infusion has limited impact on 
CAR+T cell expansion after the first infusion. 
Potential impact of ADA’s on efficacy is not clear. Particularly since there is a substantial time lag from 
administration to onset of immunresponses, impact on cellular expansion would be limited. However, 
negative impact on ide-cell persistence and long-term outcome cannot be ruled out. Furthermore, 
updated analysis indicate blunting of ide-cell expansion and tumour response in subjects that are ADA 
positive when receiving a second administration of ide-cell. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
In conclusion, the patient population consists of heavily pre-treated R/R MM patients who have 
previously been exposed to a wide range of available therapies. The efficacy assessment mainly relies 
on one pivotal single arm  study with 128 ide-cel-treated patients. Based on baseline characteristics, 
the patients represent a very special population of MM patients being younger and having good 
performance status and hence the representativeness of the safety data for the actual, less fit and 
older patient population remain unknown. The long term follow up study GC-LTFU-001 together with 
post-authorisation safety study (PASS), BB2121-MM-006 will collect relevant data on safety to 
complete the safety profile of the product.

The imposed specific obligations in the frame of the conditional Marketing Authorisation will provide 
further efficacy data and will also collect further long-term safety data for the product. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions  on the clinical safety 
The safety profile is consistent with the mechanism of action and what is known for other CAR+ T cell 
products. The main concerns are CRS, neurotoxicity, cytopenias and infections. The overall frequency 
of CRS increased with increasing dose, the frequency of Grade 3 or higher CRS was low and similar 
across the target dose levels of 300 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells. The frequency of subjects with 
neurologic toxicity (focused) Grade 3 or 4 was also low,  and dose-dependent. In general, AEs were 
reported at higher frequencies in the first 8 weeks after ide-cel infusion compared with > 8 weeks after 
ide-cel infusion, with some exceptions such as infections and hypogammaglobulinaemia.  
Overall, the AEs were generally manageable across the dose range of 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells 
with management guidelines proposed for the SmPC and additional risk minimisation measures in the 
RMP for CRS and neurotoxicity including a controlled distribution programme  with educational 
programme  at all treatment sites and a patient educational programme.   
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to safety: 
• 
In order to further characterise the long-term efficacy and safety of Abecma in adult patients 
with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma who have received at least three prior 
therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome  inhibitor and an anti CD38 
antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy the MAH shall 
conduct and submit the results of a prospective study based on data from a registry, according 
to an agreed protocol.  Interim reports to be submitted in accordance with the RMP. Final report 
expected by 30 September  2042. 
The CAT considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the context 
of a conditional MA under exceptional circumstances: 
• 
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Abecma in adult patients with relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma  who have received at least three prior  therapies, the MAH should 
submit 24 months post-Abecma infusion follow-up data (in the enrolled and treated 
population) of the pivotal study KarMMa (MM-001). Expected date for submission is 31 
December 2021. 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Abecma in adult patients with relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma  who have received at least three prior  therapies, the MAH should 
submit the results of the Phase 3 study KarMMa-3 (MM-003) comparing the efficacy and safety 
of Abecma vs. standard triplet regimens in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma.  Expected date for submission is 30 June 2023. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on clinical safety as described above.

2.8.  Pharmacovigilance   
Pharmacovigilance  system 
The CHMP and CAT considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant 
fulfils the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic  Safety Update Reports submission  requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 26 March 2021. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that idecabtagene vicleucel has not been previously authorised in a medicinal 
product in the European Union. 
The CAT/CHMP, based on the available data, considers idecabtagene vicleucel to be a new active 
substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has 
been submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons.  
The applicant  requested  the omission of certain particulars  on the  outer (metal cassette) and immediate 
(infusion  bag) packaging. On the outer packaging the Group  accepted omissions  pertaining  to the 
statements  to keep the medicinal  product  out of the sight and reach of children,  and  to see the leaflet 
for further  information, the inclusion  of the strength  as part of the active substance, and  the 
pharmaceutical  form. The omissions  of strength  and  pharmaceutical  form could be accepted as both 
elements  can be found  as part of section 1 of the labelling. The Group  accepted omissions  on the 
immediate  packaging related  to the active substance,  excipients, pharmaceutical  form and  warning 
statements  in line with  the omissions on the outer packaging, in addition  to a warning on irradiating  the 
product.  The Group  did  not accept requests  to omit warnings  on the use of leukodepleting  filters, and 
the special precautions  for disposal  which reflect the need to comply with  the local guidelines  on 
handling  of waste of human-derived  material.

The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included 
in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will 
appear in grey-shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following 
reasons: 
The applicant requested the Release for infusion certificate (RFI), which is part of Annex IIIA,  to be 
provided in English only. The QRD group concluded that the proposal was acceptable based on the 
orphan status of the product, operational challenges linked to the translation the document into 
multiple languages, and the fact that the product will only be administered in qualified treatment 
centres by specialised and trained healthcare professionals.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) is included 
in the additional monitoring list as: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
It is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 
January 2011; 
It has a PASS imposed either at the time of authorisation or afterwards; [REG Art 9(4)(cb), 
Art 10a(1)(a), DIR Art 21a(b), Art 22a(1)(a)]; 
It is approved under a conditional marketing authorisation [REG Art 14-a]  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic  Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The present application concerns the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma who have received at least three prior  therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a 
proteasome inhibitor, and an anti-CD38 antibody. 
MM is a incurable blood cancer characterised by the clonal proliferation of malignant plasma cells both 
within the bone marrow  (BM) and at localised extramedullary sites. Despite progress in its current 
treatment, MM remains largely incurable and in a such multiple relapsed disease, refractoriness to 
several drug classes represents a major  therapeutic challenge. The aim of the treatment is to achieve 
deep and durable responses that extend patient survival and afford the opportunity for treatment-free 
intervals and improved quality of life. 
3.1.2.  Available  therapies and unmet medical need 
The treatment landscape for relapsed/refractory MM has changed in recent years. Since the beginning 
of 2015, 8 relapsed/refractory MM indications (all for regimens evaluated in second or third line) have 
been approved for 6 products (including panobinostat, carfilzomib, ixazomib,  daratumumab, 
pomalidomide, and elotuzumab) through the centralised procedure. In addition, an MA has recently 
been granted for Blenrep and for Nexpovio in the 5th line RRMM indication. 
For relapsed/refractory MM patients with second or subsequent relapses, ESMO-recommended options 
are a triplet regimen based on a backbone of pomalidomide and dexamethasone (Pd) (plus 
bortezomib,  cyclophosphamide, daratumumab, elotuzumab, or ixazomib), daratumumab (single agent 
or in combination), or enrollment in a clinical trial.   
In relapsed/refractory MM patients exposed to multiple prior  AMTs, or refractory to major classes of 
AMT, the disease is life threatening and is associated with low response rates, short DoR, and poor 
survival. Thus, there is an unmet medical need for more treatment options capable of achieving deep 
and durable responses. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal data comes from an open-label, uncontrolled, multicentre, multinational, Phase 2 study 
(MM-001), evaluating the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in subjects with RRMM who had received at 
least 3 prior regimens including an immunomodulatory agent, a PI, and an anti-CD38 antibody, and 
who were refractory to their last prior treatment regimen (N=140). The study consisted of 3 stages: 
pre-treatment (screening, leukapheresis, and bridging therapy [if administered]), treatment (LDC and 
ide-cel infusion) and posttreatment (post-ide-cel infusion). Experimental agents and myeloma 
therapies to which the subject had not been previously exposed were not to be used as bridging 
therapy. A new baseline evaluation including disease restaging was performed within 72 hours of 
initiating LDC. Ide-cel was administered across a dose range of 150 (N=4), 300 (N=70) and 450 
(N=54) x 106 CAR+ T cells, with the highest dose level being added through a protocol  amendment, 
due to emerging dose response data in the dose finding study, CRB-401. 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 151/164 
 
 
 
The primary  endpoint was ORR per IRC according to the IMWG response criteria. Secondary endpoints 
included CR rate (key secondary), TTR, DoR, PFS, OS, MRD and HRQoL.  The applicant defined the ide-
cel infused patient population as the primary  analyses population, whereas for the purpose of this 
assessment the main focus was put on the enrolled (ITT) population. Data were reported based on a 
primary  data cutoff of 16th Oct 2019. Two updates based on later data cutoffs were also provided (14th 
Jan 2020 and 7th April  2020). 
The cut-off defining study success was set at ORR >50%, based on the observed activity of 
daratumumab in triple exposed/double refractory RRMM patients, reporting response rates ranging 
from 29% to 36%. Contextualisation of the data was provided in terms of an adjusted, indirect 
treatment comparisons to an external control arm,  based on a global, non-interventional, retrospective 
study (NDS-MM-003, N=190). In addition, a SLR was provided to further understand the efficacy of 
ide-cel in the context of the current treatment landscape. 
The supportive Study CRB-401 was nonrandomised, open-label, multicentre Phase 1 study. Part A 
(dose escalation) enrolled subjects who had received at least 3 prior lines of AMT, including an 
immunomodulatory agent and a PI, or were double-refractory to an immunomodulatory agent and a PI 
(N=24). Part B (expansion) the ide-cel target dose levels were from 150 to 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells and 
the enrolled subjects had received an immunomodulatory agent, a PI, and daratumumab, and were 
refractory to their last line of therapy (N=43). 
3.2.  Favourable  effects 
The pivotal study (MM-001) met its primary  endpoint with an ORR of 67.1% (95% CI: 59.4, 74.9 (p < 
0.0001)) across the target dose levels in the enrolled population. For the individual doses, the point 
estimate for ORR increased with each dose level, with an ORR of 50% (95% CI: 6.8, 93.2) for the 150 
x 106 dose, 68.6% (95% CI: 56.4, 79.1) for the 300 x 106 dose, and 81.5% (95% CI: 68.6, 90.7) for 
the 450 x 106 dose. 
The benefit of ide-cel was supported by the secondary endpoints, with a CR rate in the enrolled 
population (CR or better, key secondary endpoint) of 28.6% (95% CI: 21.1, 36.1), rejecting the null 
hypothesis of ≤ 10%. 
At the latest data cut off (07 April  2020), across the three dose levels, the median DoR was 10.6 
months (95% CI: 8.0, 11.4) among the 94 ide-cel responders. The median PFS was 8.3 months (95% 
CI: 6.7, 12.0) in the overall population and 12.1 months at the target dose of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells). 
The median OS was 21.4 months (95% CI: 19.3, NE) in the overall population, and at the target dose 
of 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, the median OS was NE (95% CI: NE, NE). 
The response rates were generally consistent across various evaluable subgroups, with the majority  of 
subgroups achieving a lower limit of the 95% CI above the pre-specified historical control ORR of 50% 
(infused population). 
3.3.  Uncertainties  and limitations  about  favourable effects 
The inclusion criteria defined a rather selected patient population with RRMM, including only patients 
with a PS of 0-1 and no major co-morbidities or organ dysfunction. While the exclusion of such patients 
is understood from a safety perspective, it affects the external validity of the trial and complicates the 
contextualisation with external data. 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 152/164 
 
 
 
 
The lack of a comparator  arm in MM-001 makes it difficult to determine the true effect size with 
respect to ORR, and the interpretation of time-to-event endpoints is intrinsically limited. The 
representativeness of the historical control rate for the ORR cutoff defining study success is uncertain, 
considering the strict inclusion criteria imposed in the pivotal trial. Furthermore, although adjusted 
comparisons were conducted against an external control arm,  several uncertainties remain as to the 
representativeness of the historical cohort for the study population in MM-001. 
The limited sample size (N=140), to some extent precludes interpretation of subgroup analyses. 
Furthermore, the somewhat short duration of follow up (median of 17 months for OS at the latest 
DCO), lends uncertainty to the long-term OS data. To what extent the observed responses will be 
reflected in long term OS benefit is not known. Data on less refractory patients are limited i.e only 
16.4% (n=23) were mono or double refractory. The greater availability and benefit of SOC options in 
these less refractory patients, introduces uncertainty as to the true magnitude of the effect size, as 
robust comparative  data on the benefit of ide-cel vs SOC in this population are lacking. These 
remaining uncertainties will be addressed by the confirmatory controlled MM-003 study included as a 
SOB to the CMA. 
The B/R of retreatment with ide-cel is uncertain, as the responses reported in the re-treated population 
were infrequent (5 PR and one VGPR reported in 29 retreated patients in study MM-001), and a limited 
PFS was observed. Particularly, in ADA positive retreated patients, the B/R appears negative, 
considering the safety profile, and lack of responses. A warning has been included in the SmPC. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The main safety concerns are related to CRS, neurological toxicity, cytopenias and infections. 
CRS occurs in the first days following treatment, median time to onset was 1.0 day (range: 1 to 17) 
and the median duration was 5.0 days (range: 1 to 63), with median time to onset shorter for the 
highest dose level. There was a higher frequency in Grade ≥3 with the higher dose levels of 300 and 
450 x 106 CAR+T cells compared to 150 x 106 CAR+T cells  (0%, 5.7%, and 5.6%), but the 
frequencies at the highest dose levels are indeed low.  The one subject with Grade 5 CRS (fatal) 
received a dose of 300 x 106 CAR+T cells. Other cases were all reversible with use of the management 
guide, including treatment with tocilizumab and/or corticosteroids or other interleukin receptor 
antagonists like anakinra or silituximab. 
Neurotoxicity identified by the investigators, which was the primary  method of assessing CAR T 
cell-associated neurotoxicity in the KarMMa study only, occurred in 18.0% of the 128 patients receiving 
Abecma,  including Grade 3 in 3.1% of patients (with no Grade 4 or 5 events). The median time to 
onset of the first event was 2 days (range: 1 to 10). The median duration was 3 days (range: 1 to 26). 
There was an increase in frequency of Grade 3 or higher events with increased dose levels; 0%, 2.9%, 
and 9.3% across the target dose levels of 150, 300, and 450 x 106 CAR+ T cells, respectively. The 
neurological AEs seem to be reversible  with use of the management guide including treatment with 
tocilizumab, corticosteroids or anakinra. 
Almost all patients in the pivotal study (96.9%), had cytopenia first 8 weeks and most of them were of 
Grade 3 or 4, none of Grade 5. After first 8 weeks, 50% still had cytopenias, of which 35.2% were of 
Grade 3 or 4. No cases of Grade 5 cytopenia were reported, but several subjects had persistent 
neutropenia and/or thrombocytopenia at death or lost to follow up. There was no clear dose dependent 
increase in frequency of cytopenia with increasing dose across the targeted dose levels of 300 and 450 
x 106. Cytopenias were managed primarily  with the use of CSFs, RBC transfusions, and platelet 
transfusions. Infections are usually a complication to cytopenias and was observed in 70.7% for any 
grade, 21.2% for Grade 3 or 4, and 2.7% for Grade 5.  
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 153/164 
 
 
 
In addition, Hypogammaglobulinaemia was reported in 19.6% of patients treated with Abecma in the 
pooled studies with a median time to onset of 100 days (range 15 to 326). 4 cases of Macrophage 
Activation Syndrome and one case of Tumour Lysis Syndrome were seen. 
Secondary malignancies were reported for 17 (9.2%) of patients in the pooled analysis. Particularly the 
incidence of basal cell carcinomas (n=7) was high. No secondary malignancies from insertional 
oncogenesis have been reported after ide-cel infusion, including initial infusion and retreatment, as of 
the data cutoff date of 07 Apr 2020. 
In the pivotal study, 34 (26.6%) deaths were reported. Of the 34 deaths, 25 deaths occurred after 
initial ide-cel infusion and 9 deaths occurred after ide-cel retreatment. Most of the 34 deaths were 
related to malignant disease under study or complication due to malignant disease under study (24 
[18.8%]) and 6 deaths (4.7%) due to AE. Frequencies and severity of AEs were in general higher 
among subjects >65 years of age compared to younger.  
Overall, the safety profile is similar  to other CAR-T products as to main AEs observed, severity and 
seriousness. The frequency may be a bit different, but that can also be related to different indications. 
3.5.  Uncertainties  and limitations  about  unfavourable effects 
Safety assessment is based on a single arm study. The patient population enrolled is highly selected: 
relatively young and fit, yet heavily pre-treated and largely refractory to other treatments. This raises 
concerns about generalizability of the safety results to real world RRMM patient population. 
Main limitations for the safety assessment are that few subjects are included (184 subjects) and the 
majority of subjects included are <65 years of age (median age 61 years), meaning that the safety 
assessment of the target population is based on very few subjects. This means that only common AEs 
have been detected. A registry study (BB2121-MM-006) is proposed to further characterise the 
incidence and severity of selected ADRs. 
The follow-up time is short 15.5 months, meaning that long-term safety cannot be assessed. This is 
particularly important for the observed long-term toxicities. These include:  
- 
- 
The persistent cytopenias, particularly neutropenia 
The long-lasting neurotoxicity 
-  Secondary malignancies   
A 15 years follow-up of patients that have been included in the clinical trials (Long-term follow-up 
study GC-LTFU-001) are proposed together with the registry study (BB2121-MM-006) to monitor long-
term safety.. 
The bridging therapies, and more  importantly LDC, will lead to AEs that cannot be separated from 
those resulting from ide-cel infusion.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance  of favourable  and unfavourable  effects 
MM remains incurable, with significant therapeutic challenges in subjects with multiple 
relapsed/refractory disease. As such this patient population has a clear unmet medical need for novel 
therapies. Across the target dose-levels, ide-cel demonstrated a significant anti-tumour activity, with 
an ORR of 67.1% (95% CI: 59.4, 74.9) and CR 30.0 % (95% CI 22.4, 37.6). This is well above, the 
pre-specified ORR cutoff for study success, as well as the response rates reported with current 
standard of care in the RWS and in the literature (32% ORR with recently approved belantamab 
mafodotin). Responses were durable (median DoR of 10.6 months), with ongoing responses observed 
in 29 of the 94 responders at the last data cutoff. Again, this compares favourably to that observed 
with current standard of care and is considered clinically meaningful in this heavily pre-treated patient 
population.  
The main uncertainties regarding the benefit/risk assessment relate to the non-comparative nature of 
the data, and the limited sample size, in addition to a somewhat short duration of follow-up, especially 
for OS. 
Contextualisation of the effect is challenging. The robustness of the adjusted indirect treatment 
comparison based on the RWS is difficult to verify, considering the rather selected study population, 
and the missing data of several important prognostic factors. Thus, although the ORR/DoR benefit is 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021

considered sufficiently compelling in the context of a single arm trial,  the true magnitude of the 
treatment effect, including to what extent the observed responses will be reflected in long term benefit 
in OS, cannot be reliably ascertained. Data on less refractory patients are limited i.e only 16.4% 
(n=23) were mono or double refractory. The greater availability and benefit of SOC options in these 
less refractory patients introduces uncertainty as to the true magnitude of the effect size, as robust 
comparative data on the benefit of ide-cel vs SOC in this population are lacking. Due to these 
deficiencies, the clinical data package is not considered comprehensive and a formal request for a CMA 
was submitted. 
The B/R of retreatment is uncertain since the responses reported in the retreated patients were 
infrequent with limited PFS. Particularly, in ADA positive patients, the B/R appears negative, 
considering the safety profile, and lack of responses. A warning has been included in the SmPC. 
Overall, the AEs observed are anticipated toxicities consistent with the mechanism of action of CAR T 
cell therapies with main safety concerns related to CRS, neurological toxicity, cytopenias and infection. 
There was a higher frequency in Grade ≥3 of CRS and neurological toxicity with the higher dose levels 
of 300 and 450 x 106 CAR+T cells compared to 150 x 106 CAR+T cells  (CRS: 0%, 5.7%, and 5.6%, 
neurological toxicity: 0%, 2.9%, and 9.3%). There are few subjects treated with the lowest dose of 
150 x 106 CAR+T cells, in particular in the pivotal study, bringing some uncertainties in the 
interpretation of safety profile at this dose level. With proper  use of management guidance and use of 
proposed additional risk minimisation measures (controlled distribution programme  including HCP 
educational programme  and a patient educational programme),  these safety concerns are considered 
adequately manageable across all dose levels.  
Main limitations for the safety assessment is that few subjects are included (184 subjects) and the 
majority of subjects included are <65 years of age, meaning that the safety assessment of the target 
population of MM is based on very few subjects. Based on the number of subjects exposed, only 
common AEs have been detected. A non-interventional, post authorisation, registry-based study 
(BB2121-MM-006) is proposed to further characterise the incidence and severity of selected ADRs.  
The short follow-up time means that long-term safety cannot be assessed. A 15 years follow-up of 
patients that have been included in the clinical trials (Long-term follow-up study GC-LTFU-001) are 
proposed together with the registry study (BB2121-MM-006) to monitor long-term safety.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Ide-cel treatment lead to a compelling ORR,  substantially higher than the pre-specified ORR cutoff as 
well as the response rates reported with current standard of care in the RWS and in the literature. 
Responses are considered durable.  
Uncertainty remains with reference to the true magnitude and duration of the treatment effect, which 
cannot be reliably ascertained based on the uncontrolled data. Furthermore, the limited follow-up 
especially for OS in the highest target dose cohort, preclude the characterisation of the long-term 
effects. Data on less refractory patients (i.e mono or double refractory only) are limited and the 
greater availability and benefit of SOC options in these less refractory patients introduces uncertainty 
as to the true magnitude of the effect size. 
Due to these deficiencies, the clinical data package is not considered comprehensive and a CMA is 
proposed. 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 158/164 
 
 
 
 
Limited data indicating efficacy may be substantially reduced at the lowest dose level (150 x 106 CAR+ 
T-cells), and a positive B/R for this dose cannot be concluded. Therefore, the 150 x 106 CAR+ T cell 
dose level was excluded from the label.   
The safety profile seems to be similar to what is known for other products in the same class. 
Management guidelines used in the clinical trials have shown to manage the serious AEs adequately at 
the dose levels proposed. Management guidelines for CRS and neurological toxicity and close 
monitoring of patients in the SmPC and additional risk minimisation measures (controlled distribution 
programme  including HCP educational programme  and a patient educational programme)  have been 
proposed to manage serious AEs in clinical practice. Studies are proposed to further characterise the 
incidence and severity of selected ADRs and long-term safety. 
3.7.3.  Additional  considerations  on the benefit-risk balance 
Conditional marketing authorisation 
As comprehensive data on the product is not available, a conditional marketing authorisation was 
proposed, and the applicant submitted a formal request for a CMA in accordance with Article 14-a of 
the above-mentioned Regulation. The product falls within the scope of Article 14-a of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004 concerning conditional marketing authorisations, as it aims at the treatment of a life-
threatening disease.  
Furthermore, it is considered that the product fulfils the requirements for a conditional marketing 
authorisation, as follows: 
- The benefit/risk is considered positive in a patient population consistent with the MM-001 study 
population. Ide-cel has a mechanism of action that is different from that of authorised treatments and 
has been shown to be associated with a 67.1% objective response rate and a median duration of 
response of 10.6 months in this group of highly pre-treated patients. The toxicity profile of Abecma is 
largely in line with the known adverse effect profile of products in the same class. The main safety 
concerns are cytokine release syndrome, cytopenias and neurotoxicity, and the treatment is tolerated 
when adverse effects are closely monitored and actively managed.   
- It is likely that the applicant will be able to provide comprehensive data by post-approval specific 
obligations as follow: 
• 
• 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Abecma in adult patients with relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma  who have received at least three prior  therapies, the MAH should 
submit 24 months post-Abecma infusion follow-up data (in the enrolled and treated 
population) of the pivotal study KarMMa (MM-001). Expected date for submission is 31 
December 2021. 
In order to confirm the efficacy and safety of Abecma in adult patients with relapsed and 
refractory multiple myeloma  who have received at least three prior  therapies, the MAH should 
submit the results of the Phase 3 study KarMMa-3 (MM-003) comparing the efficacy and safety 
of Abecma vs. standard triplet regimens in subjects with relapsed and refractory multiple 
myeloma.  Expected date for submission is 30 June 2023. 
In the ongoing randomised study (MM-003), ide-cel is compared to SOC triplet regimens in an 
overlapping patient population i.e. relapsed and refractory MM with 2-4 prior  therapies and this study 
is considered to be suitable as a specific obligation to the CMA. As of 06 Jan 2021, 261 subjects have 
Assessment report  
EMA/409800/2021  
Page 159/164 
 
 
 
 
been randomised, and patient enrolment is currently targeted to be completed by Q2 2021. Thus, a 
CMA granted 2021 would most probably  not interfere with completion of this phase 3 study and data 
can be expected to be available within an appropriate  timeframe. Updated efficacy and safety data (24 
months after the last subject has received ide-cel) from the ongoing Study BB2121-MM-001 will also 
be provided as a SOB to the CMA. 
- An unmet medical need exists in the target MM population, as available therapies in this setting offer 
limited clinical benefit. Current therapies in the RRMM setting aim to achieve durable disease 
control/remission but are not curative. Almost all patients eventually relapse and become resistant to 
available treatments, where the remission duration generally decreases with each subsequent 
treatment regimen, and where the toxicity of different regimens is significant and quite different 
between products. In this context, medicinal products with a positive benefit-risk balance and new 
mechanism of action can provide a major therapeutic advantage to patients if they offer possible 
alternative or additional treatment options based on a different safety profile, or based on therapeutic 
efficacy.  
Recently approved products for RRMM include lenalidomide, pomalidomide, bortezomib,  carfilzomib, 
ixazomib,  panobinostat, daratumumab, isatuximab, and elotuzumab. All of these treatments are set 
from first line to second line or beyond also in different combinations. Belantamab mafodotin was 
recently granted a CMA for treatment of multiple myeloma  in adult patients who have received at least 
four prior therapies and whose disease is triple refractory and who have demonstrated disease 
progression on the last therapy. Selinexor recently received a positive opinion (CMA) for use in 
combination with dexamethasone for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or refractory 
multiple myeloma (RRMM) who have received at least four prior  therapies and whose disease is 
refractory to two proteasome  inhibitors, two immunomodulatory agents and an anti-CD38 monoclonal 
antibody.  
Refractoriness to prior  therapies largely defines the available treatment options for RRMM patients in 
late line setting in which several different treatment combinations may be used. Although indirect 
comparisons of efficacy are challenging in this heterogeneous population, based on high response rate 
and durability of responses, ide-cel can be considered to address the unmet medical need to a similar 
or greater extent than other approved medicinal products. 
Abecma has a mechanism of action that is different from that of authorised treatments and has shown 
to be associated with a 67% objective response rate and a median duration of response of 10.6 
months in this group of highly pre-treated patients who received at least three classes of agents. 
Abecma has a distinct toxicity profile including significant toxicities like cytokine release syndrome 
(CRS), neurological toxicity, cytopenias and infections. Adverse effects of idecabtagene vicleucel are 
mostly clinically manageable and considered reversible.  The pivotal study population was heavily pre-
treated (median 6 prior  therapies 6, 84% were triple refractory), nonetheless the response rates 
achieved with ide-cel in less refractory small population included in study MM-001 seem compelling 
leading to the proposed indication only requiring prior exposure to an immunomodulatory agent, a PI, 
and an anti-CD38 antibody and that patients have progressed on the last treatment. The MM-003 
study is also expected to enrol patients who are less refractory (ie, mono- or double-refractory only), 
allowing for a more robust assessment of the efficacy and safety of ide-cel in these patients when 
compared to SOC.  
Therefore, Abecma  can be considered a major therapeutic advantage and will fulfil an unmet medical 
need in the approved indication as monotherapy for the treatment of multiple myeloma in adult 
patients, who have received at least three prior therapies including an immunomodulatory agent, a 
proteasome inhibitor and an anti CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the 
last therapy.

-The benefit-risk assessment supports that the benefits to public health of the immediate availability of 
ide-cel in the proposed indication would outweigh the risks inherent in the fact that additional data are 
still required. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Abecma is positive. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on Benefit Risk balance as described above.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity  with authorised  orphan medicinal  products 
The CAT/CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Abecma (idecabtagene vicleucel) is not similar to 
Darzalex, Farydak, Imnovid, Kyprolis,  Ninlaro and Blenrep within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No.  847/200. 
Outcome 
Based on the CAT review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CAT considers by consensus that 
the benefit- risk balance of Abecma is favourable in the following indication: 
Abecma is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma 
who have received at least three prior  therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome 
inhibitor and an anti CD38 antibody and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy. 
The CAT therefore recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the 
following conditions:  
Based on the draft CHMP opinion adopted by the CAT and the review of data on quality, safety and 
efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the benefit- risk balance of Abecma in the treatment of 
adult patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma  who have received at least three prior 
therapies, including an immunomodulatory agent, a proteasome  inhibitor and an anti CD38 antibody 
and have demonstrated disease progression on the last therapy  is favourable and therefore 
recommends the granting of the conditional marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CAT review of the available data, the CAT considers that idecabtagene vicleucel is a new 
active substance as it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the 
European Union. 
The CHMP endorse the CAT conclusion on the new active substance status claim.

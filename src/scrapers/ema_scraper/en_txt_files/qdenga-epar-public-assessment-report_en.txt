2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Dengue fever is an infectious disease caused by the dengue virus, a member of the flavivirus family. 
Dengue fever is a continuously global public health threat due to the increasing co-circulation of the 
four antigenically distinct Dengue virus serotypes (DENV 1-4) in most endemic areas. DENV infections 
are mostly asymptomatic but can also cause the Dengue fever acute febrile illness defined by two or 
more of the following manifestations:  
headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, haemorrhagic manifestations, and/or 
leucopenia.  
The most severe forms of dengue infection – Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock 
syndrome (DSS) – are life threatening. These severe forms manifest most often with plasma leakage 
but may also include clinically significant bleeding; the potential result of both is decreased 
intravascular volume, decreased organ perfusion, and the potential for shock and death.   
It is not completely understood why some people experience no disease and others severe disease, but 
there is strong evidence that sequential infections with different DENV types separated by more than 
18 months significantly increases the risk for a severe disease outcome. Primary infection with any of 
the 4 dengue serotypes is thought to result in decades of protection from re-infection by the same 
serotype but may not protect against a secondary infection by 1 or more of the other dengue 
serotypes and may lead to an increased risk of severe disease over the course of secondary infection 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
These dengue viruses are transmitted from human to human by mosquitoes (primarily by Aedes 
aegypti but also by Aedes albopictus). There are an estimated 390 million dengue infections per year 
worldwide, of which 100 million are symptomatic. Every year, around 500,000 cases of dengue 
haemorrhagic fever (DHF) require hospitalization with an estimated death rate of 2.5%, primarily in 
children. It is estimated that 3.9 billion people are at risk of dengue infection, with an estimated death 
rate of approximately 20,000 to 25,000 per year, primarily in children. 
The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades. This increase has 
been associated with societal changes such as population growth and increasing urbanization, 
particularly in tropical cities with poor waste and water management, leading to proliferation of the 
domestic and peri-domestic mosquito species (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus). Human migration 
and international trade and travel are constantly introducing new vectors and pathogens into novel 
geographic areas. In addition, it has been suggested that rising temperatures and global climate 
change may lead to the expansion of the major mosquito vectors into new areas, extension of the 
transmission season in areas with currently circulating dengue viruses, decrease in extrinsic incubation 
periods, and increase in the mosquito spp. vectorial capacity. 
Before 1970, only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics. The disease is now endemic 
in more than 100 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) regions of Africa, the Americas, 
the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The America, South-East Asia and 
Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected, with Asia representing approximately 70% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 10/254 
 
 
 
 
the global burden of disease. Not only is the number of cases increasing as the disease spreads to 
areas including Europe, but outbreaks are occurring. The threat of a possible outbreak of dengue now 
exists in Europe; local transmission was reported for the first time in France and Croatia in 2010 and 
imported cases were detected in 3 other European countries. In 2012, an outbreak of dengue on the 
Madeira islands of Portugal resulted in over 2000 cases and imported cases were detected in mainland 
Portugal and 10 other countries in Europe. Autochthonous cases are now observed on an almost 
annual basis in many European countries. 
Among travellers returning from low- and middle-income countries, dengue is the second most 
diagnosed cause of fever after malaria. A secondary dengue vector in Asia, Aedes albopictus, has 
spread to more than 32 states in the United States (US) and more than 25 countries in the European 
Region. 
In 2020, dengue continues to affect several countries, with reports of increases in the numbers of 
cases in Bangladesh, Brazil, Cook Islands, Ecuador, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Mauritania, Mayotte 
(Fr), Nepal, Singapore, Sri Lanka, Sudan, Thailand, Timor-Leste and Yemen. Severe dengue affects 
most Asian and Latin American countries and has become a leading cause of hospitalization and death 
among children and adults in these regions. Dengue fever is clinically defined as an acute febrile illness 
with 2 or more of the following manifestations: headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, 
haemorrhagic manifestations, and/or leucopenia. The most severe forms of dengue infection – DHF 
and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) – are life threatening. Primary infection with any of the 4 dengue 
serotypes is thought to result in decades of protection from re-infection by the same serotype but may 
not protect against a secondary infection by 1 or more of the other 3 dengue serotypes and may lead 
to an increased risk of severe disease over the course of secondary infection (DHF/DSS). In 2009, the 
WHO issued a new guideline that classifies clinical dengue as dengue (with and without warning signs) 
and severe dengue. 
In the absence of standardized global serotype surveillance, the most systematic data on the relative 
frequency of the 4 dengue serotypes may be from the placebo groups of the phase 3 dengue vaccine 
trials, which captured dengue serotypes for medically attended paediatric dengue cases over time 
across study sites in Latin America and Asia. Combining cases from the placebo groups in the Takeda 
phase 3 trial with up to 36 months of follow-up after vaccination (period from 2016 to 2020; conducted 
in The Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Brazil, Colombia, The Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and 
Panama) and in the Sanofi phase 3 trials (2011 to 2014; conducted in Indonesia, Malaysia, The 
Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam, Brazil, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, and Puerto Rico) results in an 
overall background serotype distribution of: DENV-1: 36%; DENV-2: 28%; DENV-3: 22%; DENV-4: 
15%. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Clinical presentation  
As stated by WHO (https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/dengue-and-severe-dengue),  
symptoms usually last for 2–7 days, after an incubation period of 4–10 days after the bite from an 
infected mosquito. The World Health Organization classifies dengue into 2 major categories: dengue 
(with / without warning signs) and severe dengue. The sub-classification of dengue with or without 
warning signs is designed to help health practitioners triage patients for hospital admission, ensuring 
close observation, and to minimise the risk of developing the more severe dengue (see below). 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 11/254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Dengue 
Dengue should be suspected when a high fever (40°C/104°F) is accompanied by 2 of the following 
symptoms during the febrile phase: 
− 
severe headache 
−  pain behind the eyes 
−  muscle and joint pains 
−  nausea 
−  vomiting 
− 
− 
swollen glands 
rash.  
Severe dengue 
A patient enters what is called the critical phase normally about 3-7 days after illness onset. It is at 
this time, when the fever is dropping (below 38°C/100°F) in the patient, that warning signs associated 
with severe dengue can manifest. Severe dengue is a potentially fatal complication, due to plasma 
leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment.  
Warning signs that doctors should look for include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
severe abdominal pain 
persistent vomiting 
rapid breathing 
bleeding gums 
fatigue 
restlessness  
blood in vomit.  
If patients manifest these symptoms during the critical phase, close observation for the next 24–48 
hours is essential so that proper medical care can be provided, to avoid complications and risk of 
death. 
Diagnostics 
Several methods can be used for diagnosis of DENV infection. These include virological tests (that 
directly detect elements of the virus) and serological tests, which detect human-derived immune 
components that are produced in response to the virus). Depending on the time of patient 
presentation, the application of different diagnostic methods may be more or less appropriate. Patient 
samples collected during the first week of illness should be tested by both serological and virological 
methods (reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, RT-PCR).  
Virological methods 
The virus may be isolated from the blood during the first few days of infection. Various RT–PCR 
methods are available. In general, RT–PCR assays are sensitive, but they require specialised 
equipment and technical training for staff implementing the test, therefore they are not always 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 12/254 
 
 
 
 
available in all medical facilities. RT–PCR products from clinical samples may also be used for 
genotyping of the virus, allowing comparisons with virus samples from various geographical sources. 
The virus may also be detected by testing for a virus-produced protein, called Nonstructural protein-1 
(NS1). There are commercially produced rapid diagnostic tests available for this; it takes only ~20 
mins to determine the result, and the test does not require specialized laboratory techniques or 
equipment.  
Serological methods 
Serological methods, such as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), may confirm the 
presence of a recent or past infection, with the detection of Immunoglobulin M (IgM) and 
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) anti-dengue antibodies. IgM antibodies are detectable ~1 week after infection 
and are highest at 2 to 4 weeks after the onset of illness. They remain detectable for about 3 months. 
The presence of IgM is indicative of a recent DENV infection. IgG antibody levels take longer to develop 
than IgM, but IgG remain in the body for years. The presence of IgG is indicative of a past infection. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Treatment of dengue fever is based solely on the clinical signs and symptoms, with fluid replacement 
required for haemorrhagic or shock cases. An antiviral therapy for dengue virus infection is not 
available. Most of the current preventive measures that rely on mosquito control and individual 
protection are of limited efficacy, complex to implement, and questionable in terms of cost-
effectiveness. While the malaria transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes predominantly feed during the 
night, the dengue transmitting Aedes mosquitoes feed predominantly at dusk and bed nets are 
therefore not effective. Dengue continues to spread despite the use of vector control measures. New 
technologies under development appear to be effective at stopping local dengue transmission, such as 
where mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia (which reduces a mosquito’s ability to transmit human 
viruses) are released into the environment. 
Vaccine development has assumed the need for tetravalent vaccines against all 4 serotypes to avoid 
any potential risk of vaccine induced immune enhancement, as has been well documented with natural 
(wild-type, wt) infection. A first tetravalent dengue vaccine (chimeric Yellow Fever [YF] virus-Dengue 
virus Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine) has been approved since 2015 in several Asian and Latin American 
countries as well as in the US and in the European Union (EU). This vaccine was initially authorised for 
use in vaccine recipients ≥9 years of age because clinical data indicated an unfavourable risk benefit 
profile for children <9 years of age [15]. More recent analyses found that individuals who were dengue 
seronegative before vaccination had a higher risk of getting severe disease and/or getting hospitalized 
when they were infected by dengue virus after vaccination than individuals who were already 
seropositive. In a revised recommendation from April 2018, the Scientific Advisory Group for 
Emergencies (SAGE) concluded that for countries considering vaccination as part of their dengue 
control program, a “pre vaccination screening strategy” would be the preferred option, and only 
dengue seropositive individuals should be vaccinated. 
Hence, having regard to the epidemiology of dengue, the lack of available antiviral treatments and the 
limitations of the vaccine, there is a continued unmet public health need for a safe and effective 
vaccine that will protect populations not covered by currently available vaccine option (children aged 
<9 years and individuals with no previous exposure to dengue virus) against dengue infection. 
The WHO has defined and reconfirmed dengue vaccines as high priority vaccines for WHO 
prequalification, i.e., dengue is included in the list of High Priority Vaccines in the WHO vaccines 
prequalification priority list 2018-2020.

To address this unmet medical need, the applicant has developed a tetravalent vaccine that protects 
against dengue irrespective of baseline dengue serostatus and that can be administered to children as 
young as 4 years of age. 
2.2.  About the product 
In this document, please note that Qdenga (dengue tetravalent vaccine [live, attenuated]), the Takeda 
dengue vaccine candidate also known as TAK-003, is referred to as TDV. 
TDV comprises 4 dengue virus strains: a molecularly characterized, attenuated dengue serotype 2 
strain (TDV-2), a dengue serotypes 2/1 recombinant strain (TDV-1), a dengue serotypes 2/3 
recombinant strain (TDV-3), and a dengue serotypes 2/4 recombinant strain (TDV-4) (see Figure 1). 
The dengue serotype 2 vaccine strain (TDV-2) is based upon the attenuated laboratory-derived 
primary dog kidney (PDK) virus DENV-2 PDK-53 (parental strain: DENV-2 16681), originally isolated in 
Thailand in 1964. The attenuated vaccine strains for dengue serotypes 1, 3, and 4 were engineered by 
substituting the structural pre-membrane (prM) and envelope (E) genes of TDV-2 with the prM and 
E genes of the dengue virus strains, DENV-1 16007 (isolated in Thailand in 1964), DENV-3 16562 
(isolated in The Philippines in 1964), or DENV-4 1036 virus (isolated in Indonesia in 1976), 
respectively. 
Figure 1: Diagram of the Genetic Structure of the 4TDV Vaccine Strains 
The primary mechanism of action of TDV is to replicate locally and elicit neutralizing antibodies to 
confer protection against dengue disease caused by any of the 4 dengue virus serotypes. TDV activates 
multiple arms of the immune system, including binding antibodies, complement fixing antibodies, 
functional antibodies to dengue NS1, and cell mediated immune responses (cluster of differentiation 4 
– T-Cell co-receptor [CD4+], cluster of differentiation 8 – T-Cell co-receptor [CD8+], and natural killer 
cells) 
The Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical Classification System (ATC) code for TDV has not been assigned 
yet and the pharmacotherapeutic group is “Vaccines, Viral vaccines”.

2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP agreed to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment as the product was 
considered to be of major public health interest. This was based on the following reasons: 
To have a vaccine for the prevention of dengue disease that is safe and efficacious is a major interest 
from the point of view of public health, taking into account that: 
o 
o 
o 
o 
Dengue cases have increased in the past decades. Today, dengue is the most common and 
rapidly spreading mosquito-borne viral disease in the world. 
WHO has listed dengue as one of the ten threats to global health in 2019 and dengue is listed as 
High Priority Vaccine in the WHO vaccines prequalification priority list 2018-2020. 
Aggressive mosquito control efforts in endemic areas have been largely ineffective in preventing 
dengue outbreaks or in preventing further geographic spread of the disease. 
There are no specific treatment for dengue approved anywhere in the world. The only available 
dengue vaccine (CYD-TDV) has important limitations in addressing the medical need, as has 
been discussed above. 
The recombinant dengue vaccine presented by the applicant has the potential to overcome the 
limitations previously discussed for existing vaccine option, since it could be used to vaccinate 
seronegative subjects and a broader age group including young children. There are attributes in this 
vaccine that justify that it is of major interest from the point of view of public health and in particular 
from the point of view of therapeutic innovation: 
o 
TDV contains four live attenuated dengue serotypes (TDV-1 to TDV-4) based on a molecularly 
characterized, attenuated DENV-2 strain (TDV-2) providing for exposure to all DENV antigens 
including those that elicit a cellular immune response. The genetic structure results in an 
immunogenicity profile that is unique to TDV and that has the potential to not elicit an increased 
risk for seronegative subjects. 
o 
There are promising safety and efficacy data already submitted by the applicant and discussed in 
previous sections that point to the applicant’s vaccine as a solid candidate to cover the actual 
unmet medical need and the WHO priorities. 
However, during assessment the CHMP concluded that it was no longer appropriate to pursue 
accelerated assessment, due to the complexity of the dossier, with quite a few issues outstanding, 
including Major objections, at major assessment milestone (Day 90). 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a powder and solvent for solution for injection. The powder 
contains a mixture of the four serotype of live, attenuated dengue vaccine viruses as active 
substances: 
•  Dengue virus serotype 1 (live, attenuated): ≥3.3 log10 PFU/dose, 
•  Dengue virus serotype 2 (live, attenuated): ≥2.7 log10 PFU/dose, 
•  Dengue virus serotype 3 (live, attenuated): ≥4.0 log10 PFU/dose, 
•  Dengue virus serotype 4 (live, attenuated): ≥4.5 log10 PFU/dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

Other ingredients (powder) are: α,α-trehalose dihydrate, poloxamer 407, human serum albumin 
(HSA), potassium dihydrogen phosphate, disodium hydrogen phosphate, potassium chloride, and 
sodium chloride. The solvent consists of sodium chloride and water for injections. 
The powder’s primary packaging is a borosilicate Type-I glass vial with a 13 mm neck. Vials are 
stoppered with dark grey bromobutyl rubber ‘Type I’ lyophilization stoppers and sealed with flip-off 
aluminum/plastic 13mm green, caps. 
The solvent’s primary packaging is glass vial (Type-I glass), with a stopper (bromobutyl rubber) and 
aluminium seal with purple flip-off plastic cap, or a pre-filled syringe (Type-I glass), with a plunger 
stopper (bromobutyl) and a tip cap (polypropylene). A Notified Body opinion is provided for the PFS. 
At the time of administration, the lyophilized vaccine is reconstituted with the entire contents of the 
Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine (Live, Attenuated) (TDV) diluent in either a vial or pre-filled syringe (PFS) 
so that upon withdraw of the reconstituted finished product a 0.5 mL dose of vaccine can be 
administered. 
Two needles, 23 Gauge (for reconstitution) and 25 Gauge (for injection), will be supplied based on the 
market/country requirement and will be co-packaged along with the TDV finished product and diluent 
in the pre-filled syringe presentation. The needles are CE marked.  
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The active substances in tetravalent dengue vaccine (TDV) are the four serotypes of live, attenuated, 
dengue viruses (TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3, and TDV-4). Each of the four serotypes expresses the antigenic 
prM and Envelope protein (E) from each of the four serotypes and share a common attenuated 
dengue-2 genetic backbone. Each virus serotype is produced and released as individual bulk active 
substance. 
Whole genome sequencing and molecular genetics techniques have demonstrated that the mutations 
identified by red triangles in Fig 1 are necessary and sufficient for attenuation of DENV-2, lie outside 
the structural genes in the 5' non-coding region (5’NCR) at nucleotide 57, and are within NS1 at amino 
acid position 53 and NS3 at amino acid position 250 (Table 1).

The serotype 2 strain is based upon the attenuated laboratory-derived virus, DEN-2 PDK-53, originally 
isolated at Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand. The recombinant genetically modified organism 
(GMO) TDV strains TDV-1, TDV-3 and TDV-4 express the surface antigens of the DENV-1, DENV-3 or 
DENV-4 viruses, respectively, and retain the genetic alterations responsible for the attenuation of the 
TDV-2 strain.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, process controls and characterisation  
The active substance is manufactured and released by IDT Biologika GmbH, Germany. Good 
Manufacturing Practice (GMP) compliance has been documented for all sites involved in the production 
and testing of the active substance.  
2.4.2.3.  Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance manufacturing process has been adequately described. It follows an appropriate 
approach for live attenuated viral vaccines, including cell culture expansion, viral culture, clarification, 
purification, stabilization, and final filling and storage of the active substance. 
The active substance manufacturing process is divided into upstream (Module 1) and downstream 
(Module 2) operations, which have been adequately described. Module 1 describes the cell expansion 
steps. Module 2 describes inoculation and virus harvest through purification and storage of bulk active 
substance.  
The manufacturing process of TDV-1 and TDV-2 is identical, while the manufacturing processes for 
TDV-3 and TDV-4 differ downstream from the harvest and TDV-4 is produced at a larger scale than the 
other serotypes. In-process controls and critical parameters are listed and presented in the flowchart 
included in the dossier. No reprocessing options are considered for this manufacturing process. The 
provided information is considered acceptable.  
Control of materials 
The list of raw materials used in the manufacture of the Takeda’s live attenuated dengue tetravalent 
vaccine active substances is described in detail. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance 
with the corresponding monograph, while specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial 
raw materials are presented. Foetal bovine serum, human serum albumin and porcine trypsin are the 
only biological materials used for active substance manufacture. These raw materials are properly 
controlled and the Vero master cell bank (MCB) and working cell bank (WCB), as well as each dengue 
serotype pre-Master virus seed (MVS), working virus seed (WVS) and bulk active substance have been 
tested negative for adventitious agents. Refer to section on adventitious agents for further details. 
Source, History and Generation of the Cell Substrate  
The applicant has implemented a two-tiered cell banking system in which the Vero MCB was 
manufactured, characterized in compliance with ICH Q5D, and was subsequently expanded to produce 
the first WCB for use in routine active substance manufacturing process.  
The generation of the Vero MCB and WCB is well described. The number of passages is particularly well 
taken into consideration. An extensive characterization of MCB and WCB was performed including 
analysis of sterility, morphology, identity, test for extraneous viral agents, and in vivo tumorigenicity 
test.  
Source, History and Generation of the Viral Vaccine Strain 
A description for the attenuated TDV-2 as well as the recombinant TDV-1, TDV-3 and TDV-4 viruses 
and their generation is provided and considered adequate. The generation of the MVS and WVS for 
each serotype is well described.  
Extensive characterization of virus seed banks for all serotypes was performed including analysis of: 1) 
genetic characterization; 2) phenotypic characterization; and 3) test for adventitious agents. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 17/254 
 
 
 
 
Genetic stability studies for the three attenuating mutations were performed and demonstrated that 
only the 5’NC-57-T mutation show a propensity to revert during passage. However, the percentage 
reversion at the 5'NC-57 locus among the four MVS stocks is considered acceptable.  
In conclusion, the MCB, WCB, MVS and WVS are suitable for use in pharmaceutical production of the 
Takeda’s live attenuated dengue tetravalent vaccine active substances. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Critical steps have been identified through a series of risk assessments (PFMEA), process validation 
and characterization of the process after each validation exercise.  
All process parameters identified as critical (CPPs) and quality attributes identified as critical (CQAs) 
must remain within their pre-determined acceptance criteria/specifications. All results that fall outside 
of their respective pre-determined acceptance criteria are identified as deviations or Out of 
specification (OOS) and will be investigated with regards to root cause and impact to the process and 
product, and appropriate corrective and preventive actions will be implemented as required.  
The control approach is deemed acceptable.  The test methods are relevant for this type of production. 
The acceptance criteria are well described and acceptable.  
Process validation 
The applicant has undertaken a detailed process validation including manufacture of consecutive lots 
for the general as well as the serotype specific processes.  
Results are presented for all manufacturing steps and processes and have been shown to be within the 
proposed acceptance criteria. These results support the reproducibility of the different manufacturing 
processes used for manufacturing of active substance for each serotype. 
Manufacturing process development 
As a result of process development efforts, changes have been implemented from phase 1 
manufacturing process, referred to as Process 1, to the commercial process, referred to as Process 3b 
(post-PPQ) (for TDV-1, TDV-2, and TDV-3) and Process 4 (for the manufacture of TDV-4). While the 
general process steps for the manufacture of all four serotypes are the same, there are differences in 
the process and process scale across serotypes (for the active substance component) with the largest 
concentration in the finished product (TDV-4), requiring an increased scale of production to maintain 
product supply.  
In order to demonstrate comparability between the active substances from the different processes, the 
applicant performed the following comparability studies: 
- TDV-1: comparability for Process 3a to Process 3b and for Process 3b to Commercial (Process 3b 
Post-PPQ) process. 
- TDV-2: comparability for Process 3a to Process 3b and for Process 3b to Commercial (Process 3b 
Post-PPQ) process. 
- TDV-3: comparability for Process 3a to Process 3b and for Process 3b to Commercial (Process 3b 
Post-PPQ) process. 
- TDV-4: comparability for Process 3a to Process 3b and for Process 3b to Process 4. 
The active substance comparability study encompasses the conformity to the release testing 
specifications, the stability along the product shelf-life and the active substance comparison based on a 
battery of selected tests for appropriate attributes including potency, pH, impurities, identity, 
appearance, genomic RNA content, and attenuating genotype. All batches complied with the release 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 18/254 
 
 
 
 
and stability specifications. Overall, all batches showed comparable results for the battery of selected 
tests. 
The comparability exercise is focused on process 3a, 3b and 4 as batches produced with these 
manufacturing processes were used for the efficacy study as well as the lot to lot consistency study. 
In conclusion, these studies showed that the quality of Takeda’s live attenuated dengue virus vaccine 
active substances manufactured by the commercial processes proposed by the applicant is highly 
comparable to the material used for Phase 3 clinical trials even though it is not possible to assess the 
comparability with active substance lots produced with earlier processes. 
2.4.2.4.  Characterisation 
The structure, biophysical characteristics and potency of the TDV viruses were investigated and a 
summary of the studies and conclusions was provided. The following attributes of TDV virus were 
evaluated: 
•  Structure, by genotypic and phenotypic evaluation 
• 
Potency 
•  Non-structural protein characteristics 
•  Virus maturation  
Particular attention was given to the structure of the viral particles. The genotypic evaluation seeks to 
ensure that the correct genetic sequences are retained in the four viral serotypes that are part of the 
TDV, with a low frequency of mutation and without losing the important attenuating mutations. It was 
found that for each serotype there were consistent numbers of intact and infectious viral particles. 
In addition, a phenotypic evaluation was undertaken using different techniques including visualization 
of the viral particles differentiating their maturation state by their smooth, bumpy or spiky structure 
(the smooth particles are the mature, infective ones). Viral attenuation studies were carried out in 
mosquito cells to demonstrate the retention of the attenuating mutations in the TDV (these assays 
include plaque size and in vitro growth on mosquito cells). 
Other characteristics studied were the potency, measurement of levels of non-structural protein 1 
(NS1), a diagnostic immunogenic target of Dengue infection (this protein is identical in the four 
components of the vaccine, as all share the DEN-2 NS1 backbone), and virus maturation was 
investigated (presence of prM signifies an immature/partially immature particle), showing varied 
results between serotypes, but consistent for each of them. 
The impurities analysed are all relevant process-related impurities and were present in product used in 
clinical studies.  
The absence of adventitious agents has been confirmed. 
2.4.2.5.  Specification 
An appropriate set of release and stability specifications with tests, methods and acceptance criteria 
were provided for each monovalent active substance to adequately control the release of active 
substance and ensure quality through the end of shelf-life. The specification includes physico-chemical, 
identity, potency, purity and safety tests. The specifications are the same for all serotypes, with the 
only difference being potency. In addition, safety specifications were provided for control cells. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 19/254 
 
 
 
 
Appearance, bioburden, potency and pH are tests performed on stability samples. Potency 
specifications are serotype specific. The setting of specifications was informed by data obtained during 
development and stability studies.  The applicant proposed to change the specification for Host Cell 
DNA. This is considered acceptable. These specifications are endorsed, however, Takeda has 
committed to some improvements to the specifications and/or acceptance criteria.   
Analytical methods 
Analytical procedures used for release and stability testing of TDV-1 to TDV-4 bulk drug substance 
(BDS) have been adequately described and are considered acceptable. 
TDV potency (active substance and finished product) is measured by a validated in vitro cell based 
assay. This assay is based on measuring the number of infectious particles that form plaques on a 
culture plate and allows identification of the virus serotype.  Potency is reported as log10 plaque 
forming units (PFU) /mL. Compendial methods were verified to be suitable for use, while non-
compendial test methods developed specifically for TDV have been validated taking into account ICH 
Q2(R1).  
Reference materials 
There is no compendial or international reference standard for TDV, therefore the applicant established 
in-house reference standards as positive control for the potency and identity methods for both BDS 
and finished product release testing and stability testing. 
The current reference standard is a tetravalent finished product batch and it is used for release and 
stability testing of active substance and finished product. The dossier provides the list of tests 
performed for qualification of the existing reference standards and also includes the plan for 
qualification of all future primary/working reference standards. 
Batch analysis 
Release testing data have been presented for a sufficient number of lots representative of the 
commercial process. 
Along the history of this vaccine development, the specifications have changed (some tests have been 
abandoned or replaced by others, new tests have been added and some acceptance criteria have been 
modified), but in all cases the BDS lots meet the specifications set at the time. 
Container closure 
The TDV BDS is stored in a sterile container. The container is described in sufficient detail and complies 
with relevant European guidance. The use of this container is considered acceptable. 
The compatibility of the container closure system for all 4 serotypes has been confirmed by stability 
studies undertaken with relevant containers. Extractables and leachables testing and results were 
provided. 
2.4.2.6.  Stability 
To support the proposed shelf life, data are presented for serotype TDV-1 and TDV-2 active substance 
manufactured with validated commercial Process. Results indicate that specifications are met through 
the proposed shelf-life at the long-term storage condition. Data support the shelf life claim and the 
consistency between batches. 
For serotype TDV-3, the shelf life claim is supported by primary validation lots manufactured using the 
validated commercial process, and meeting the specifications when stored at the long-term conditions. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 20/254 
 
 
 
 
Data with stress storage conditions and from additional batches manufactured with the same process 
and with the previous process, support the shelf life claim and the consistency between batches.  
In the case of serotype TDV-4, the shelf life claim is supported by data meeting the specifications for 
primary validation batches stored at the long-term conditions. Supporting data came from stress 
conditions and from additional batches manufactured with the validated commercial manufacturing and 
stored at the long-term and stress conditions.  
In addition, the applicant indicates that as more stability data becomes available, shelf life extensions 
will be evaluated for the active substances. The potency declines under accelerated/stress conditions 
for all serotypes. 
The stability protocols for each serotype and storage condition are presented. The stability protocols 
and the shelf life claims for the different active substance serotypes of Takeda Dengue vaccine are 
supported. 
The provided stability data is considered sufficient to support the claimed shelf life of the TDV-1, TDV-
2, TDV-3 and TDV-4 active substances.  
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Takeda’s Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine (TDV) is a sterile lyophilized compact cake that is reconstituted 
prior to injection. At the time of administration, vials are reconstituted with diluent (supplied as 37 mM 
sodium chloride solution) so that a 0.5 mL dose of vaccine can be withdrawn and administered.  
TDV finished product contains four monovalent bulk drug substances (BDS) (TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3 and 
TDV-4) and multiple excipients. It is presented as an off-white lyophilized powder in a Type I, 2 mL 
glass vial. The active substance contains approximately 15% (w/v) trehalose (dihydrate basis), 1% 
(w/v) Pluronic F127, and 0.1% (v/v) HSA in a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) matrix. Upon 
reconstitution with the diluent (37 mM sodium chloride), the finished product forms a clear solution, 
essentially free of foreign particulate. Each finished product vial provides an extractable 0.5 mL dose of 
reconstituted vaccine. 
The applicant has provided a comprehensive description of the pharmaceutical development. Due to 
the labile nature of the live viruses, modifications in the formulation were implemented throughout the 
development of TDV finished product with the aim to optimize and maintain the activity of the virus to 
ensure potency and stability throughout the product shelf-life. Early development studies were 
conducted to determine a combination of pharmaceutically accepted excipients that would provide 
better stability of the vaccine candidate. Four major processes can be identified in the development: 
Process 1 represents early formulations, Process 2 represents the introduction of the lyophilization 
process, Process 3 represents the scale-up to commercial scale, Process 4 is the commercial 
manufacturing process. The relationship of each step of the manufacturing stages with regard to titre 
loss and variability was studied and these data were used to develop the formulation strategy.  
The physicochemical and biological properties of the formulation are monitored routinely as part of 
product release testing. 
Product and process knowledge in combination with quality risk management (ICH Q9), supported the 
process controls that are in place to ensure delivery of TDV finished product commercial material which 
consistently meets the required finished product specifications. The applicant has satisfactorily 
presented the quality characteristics that the product should have to ensure the desired quality taking 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 21/254 
 
 
 
 
into account safety and efficacy. The applicant has also presented comparability exercises for the 
different process changes implemented during late manufacturing development. This is acceptable.  
The applicant has applied Quality by Design principles in the development of the finished product and 
their manufacturing process. However, no design spaces were claimed for the manufacturing process 
of the finished product. 
Finished product manufactured, in most early development through commercial phase, has been filled 
into 2 mL Type I glass containers closed with grey butyl rubber lyophilization stoppers. The selected 
vial was chosen because it is highly resistant to hydrolysis. Compatibility of the finished product with 
the contact materials it is exposed to during dose preparation has also been presented. 
Overall, the level of information presented by the applicant for the pharmaceutical development of TDV 
finished product is deemed appropriate. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
TDV finished product is manufactured, tested, packaged and released for commercial distribution at 
IDT Biologika GmbH (Dessau-Rosslau, Germany) and Takeda GmbH (Singen, Germany). A valid proof 
of GMP compliance has been provided. 
The finished product manufacturing process is designed to provide sterility assurance through process 
and facility controls. The manufacture of finished product includes strict controls surrounding the 
amount of each serotype to ensure the target potency of each batch, the buffer content to ensure 
appropriate composition of the formulated product and the duration of each operational unit to manage 
the loss in viral titer during manufacturing processing. The volume of each serotype used in the 
formulation varies based on the release active substance potency, considering the minimum 
manufacturing release specifications for the potency of each serotype within the final formulated 
finished product. 
The criticality of process steps is assessed through a risk assessment which considers the development 
data. Based on validation exercises performed to date and process characterization data, parameters 
in specific manufacturing steps are critical because of the potential impact on the product critical 
quality attributes (CQA). The risk mitigation measures include accurate daily calibration of equipment 
(where applicable), specified ranges of operation within the batch record as well as second person 
verification. The failure to comply with the critical process parameters specifications/ranges will lead to 
an investigation and may lead to rejection of the batch. In general, relevant process parameters 
quality attributes have been properly described in the process description with justified set points or 
ranges.  
Released bulk finished product vials are shipped to the labelling and packaging facility for long-term 
storage. The vials are labelled and packed in appropriate presentations depending on the intended 
market for distribution. Finished product vials are placed in shipping cases and transferred to long-
term storage prior to being transported to distribution centre with validated shipping lane and 
transport mode. This approach is deemed acceptable.  
A description of the process validation strategy has been provided. Process performance qualification 
(PPQ) was performed to demonstrate manufacturing process control and robustness across different 
batches and process (i.e., a process validation series). Each PPQ series covered a minimum of three 
consecutive manufacturing runs. Performance of three batches for each of the PPQ campaigns was 
evaluated for inter-batch consistency and reproducibility. Three batches meeting the definition of 
consecutiveness were completed for each PPQ campaign. Consecutive batches are defined as a series 
that does not include a batch assigned the outcome of Fail. The process validation is presented clearly 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 22/254 
 
 
 
 
and the validation strategy is properly justified. Upon completion of each validation, the process was 
evaluated and summarized in a report. Overall, the information provided by the applicant in the 
manufacture section is considered adequate. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The TDV finished product is appropriately controlled by release and end of shelf-life specifications. The 
specification includes physico-chemical, identity, potency, purity and safety tests. Some of the tests 
are in compliance with pharmacopoeial methods and therefore analytical validation data were not 
provided, and this is considered acceptable.  
For analytical procedures not described in pharmacopoeias descriptions of the analytical methods and 
relevant analytical validation results were provided. 
TDV finished product is filled into glass vials and lyophilized as part of the manufacturing of the 
finished product. No new impurities are expected to be contributed by the finished process 
manufacturing steps.   
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed on a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. 
A risk assessment for nitrosamines presence has been presented. The risk evaluation performed by 
Takeda have determined that there is no risk for the presence of N-nitrosamines in DTV finished 
product. The assessment is deemed approvable.  
The justification of the specifications proposed for TDV finished product at release and stability are in 
general considered acceptable.  
The rationale for the control strategy for potency during finished product manufacturing is aimed to 
assure that the labile active substances will consistently meet the manufacturing release specifications 
and thus maintain the expected end of shelf-life potency following 18 months of storage at 2°C-8°C. 
The potency specifications considered information from nonclinical and clinical studies, method 
performance, product stability and serotype specific decay rates, while ensuring immunogenicity of the 
product even at lower levels of potency. This is endorsed.  
Overall, the level of information presented by the applicant is deemed appropriate. 
Analytical methods 
For analytical procedures not described in pharmacopoeias, description of the analytical methods is 
provided and a summary of its validation has been provided, stating that the validations were executed 
according to ICH guidelines.  
As for the active substance specification, a potency assay is performed at release of the TDV finished 
product. The assay is based on measuring the number of infectious particles that form plaques on a 
culture plate and allows identification of the virus serotype. Potency is reported as log10 plaque forming 
units (PFU) per dose. 
Batch analysis 
The proposed specifications were met on the batches analysed. Batch to batch consistency has also 
been demonstrated across all batches.

Reference materials 
Takeda has implemented a product-specific in-house reference material (PC) which is used to 
continuously monitor method performance for measuring the potency, and as reference material for 
confirmation of the identity of Takeda’s TDV finished product.  
The applicant indicates that the potency of the material is not susceptible to change on long-term 
storage. Stable performance of the material used for release and stability testing of commercial 
finished product and associated active substance lots is continuously monitored during routine testing 
via the respective assay validity criteria. Information about the historical lots of PCs and qualification of 
future lots of PCs have been included and is deemed acceptable. 
Container Closure System 
The finished product primary container closure system includes a 2 mL Type 1 glass vial, elastomeric 
stopper, aluminium seal with plastic flip-off cap. The vial and the elastomeric stopper comply with 
pharmacopeial standards. Following fill/finish manufacture, the bulk unlabelled finished product vials 
are stored at long-term storage conditions until packaging. The in-process secondary packaging 
components do not come in contact with the product. 
The labelled finished product will be co-packaged with the diluent (37 mM saline solution) in several 
combinations. Needles may be included in the secondary pack for PFS diluent images depending on 
individual country requirements. Two needles (23 gauge and 25 gauge) may be included. The needles 
are CE marked. Sufficient information is provided about the container closure system. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Storage and distribution of the lyophilized TDV finished product are deemed acceptable. Dual long-
term and stress stability studies have been conducted to examine the effects of temperature on the 
stability of the finished product over time. Long term and accelerated data have been presented with a 
suitable number of batches representative of the commercial process to support the shelf life of the 
finished product. A commitment post-approval stability protocol in compliance with the ICH Guidance 
on Stability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products Q1A (R2) and Quality of Biotechnological 
Products (Q5C), has been included. A stability study at temperatures above the long-term storage 
condition (5°C±3°C) has been provided to evaluate the impact to potency from accidental exposures 
beyond Climatic Zone II. The applicant has also implemented a temperature excursion model based on 
the decay profile. 
The packaged product is photostable. An in-use compatibility study has been performed. The product is 
to be used within 2 hours of reconstitution for the final commercial product (see section 6.3 of the 
SmPC). This is endorsed.  The applicant has provided transportation validation studies for the bulk 
unlabelled finished product. To evaluate the impact of movement stress (shock/vibration and low air 
pressure) during the transportation on the product, container closure integrity tests were executed. 
After the tests the container closure integrity of the product was shown not to be affected.  
The approved finished product shelf-life is 18 months at the refrigerated (5±3°C) storage condition.

2.4.4.  Finished Product (Diluent) 
2.4.4.1.  Description of the diluent and Pharmaceutical Development  
Takeda’s Dengue Tetravalent Vaccine (TDV) is reconstituted with diluent (supplied as 37 mM sodium 
chloride solution) so that 0.5 mL dose of vaccine can be withdrawn and administered. The diluent is 
provided in either a PFS or a glass vial. 
The diluent is presented in either vials or pre-filled syringes but the composition is the same, i.e. 37 
mM sodium chloride (NaCl) solution. 
Different manufacturers are responsible for the diluent presentations. GMP certificates covering the 
importation and quality control testing of the diluent presentations is provided for all sites. 
A Notified Body Opinion (Article 117 of the Medical Device Regulation (EU) 2017/745) for the PFS is 
provided. 
A diluent manufacturing comparison and evaluation showed that while there are some differences 
between diluent manufacturing sites with respect to manufacturing processes, scales, equipment, 
facilities and in-process controls, these differences do not have an appreciable impact on the resulting 
diluent. The TDV 37 mM saline diluent has been shown to be comparable across all manufacturers. The 
density used in calculations for filling across all three diluent sites is within the range of 0.999 to 1.000 
g/mL.  
The two primary containers (vials and syringes) have been shown to be suitable for the diluent. All 
components were tested for leachables, extractables and elemental impurities. Finally, container 
closure integrity is tested as in-process control and at some stability time points, which is adequate.  
2.4.4.2.  Manufacture of the diluent and process controls 
A batch numbering system is in place at each site. Critical steps and intermediates have been defined 
for each manufacturing site, together with acceptance limits. A high-level summary of these control 
strategy at each site has been included. In general, the control strategy is considered adequate.  
Alternate validation approaches were taken at the different sites based on site procedures and 
differences in the processes and development history. Multiple batches were manufactured at each site 
in accordance with local procedures.  
In conclusion, the process is considered validated at the manufacturing sites. 
2.4.4.3.  Diluent specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The components of the diluent are considered excipients. Both sodium chloride and WFI are of 
compendial quality.  
Release and stability specifications were provided. The specifications for the diluent are harmonized 
across all attributes except for image-specific differences. Only reference to USP methods are 
presented for tests such as identity (sodium and chloride), content, iron or container closure based on 
a comparison of USP and Ph. Eur. methods. Compendial methods were shown to be fit for purpose at 
each manufacturing site. The proposed specifications are considered well justified. All batches 
manufactured complied with the specifications.

2.4.4.4.  Stability of the diluent 
A harmonized shelf-life is proposed across both long-term storage conditions at all manufacturing 
locations.  
Stability studies are on-going at all manufacturing sites and data are available from multiple batches 
that support of the proposed shelf-life. The shelf-life assigned to diluent co-packaged with the vaccine 
will not exceed the remaining shelf-life of the first component to expire.

2.4.4.6.  Adventitious agents 
CONTROL OF VIRAL ADVENTITIOUS AGENTS 
The TDV is a live attenuated viral vaccine, therefore, viral inactivation/clearance steps are not 
applicable to this product. Thus, the risk mitigation strategy for control of viral adventitious agents for 
the TDV relied on: 
• Qualification of raw materials. 
• Qualification of biological starting materials. 
• Comprehensive testing (viral) for verifying the absence of contaminants in the raw and biological 
materials, unprocessed bulk, end of production (EOP) cells, bulk drug substance. 
CONTROL OF NON-VIRAL ADVENTITIOUS AGENTS 
The control of non-viral adventitious agents was achieved with qualification of the starting materials 
(master and working cell banks, master and working viral seeds) and materials of biological origin. 
Animal origin materials were sourced from appropriate locations and documentation was provided. In 
addition, all lots were gamma-irradiated to further reduce the risk of viral contamination. 
Comprehensive testing was performed to verify the absence of potential contaminants in the raw and 
biological test materials, unprocessed bulk, end of production (EOP) cells, bulk drug substance and the 
finished product similar to the viral adventitious agent control. 
Bioburden testing is performed on the bulk finished product. Endotoxin and sterility release testing are 
performed on the finished product. 
In the case of human serum albumin, which is used as a component of the formulation for the 
tetravalent bulk finished product. Human serum albumin was obtained from Octapharma GmbH 
(Dessau-Rosslau, Germany) as Albumin (Human). This product is authorised in the European Union 
(License No. PEI.H.04333.02.1 for Albunorm 20% (DE/H/0480/002/DC), and PEI.H.04333.06.1 for 
Albunorm 25% (DE/H/0480/004/DC)). Certificates of Compliance and CoA were provided showing the 
risk of adventitious agent contamination to be low. 
2.4.4.7.  GMO 
The Applicant conclude that the overall risk for human health and the environment is negligible. This 
conclusion is endorsed.

2.4.5.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Major Objections raised during the review of the application related to the GMP status of the 
manufacturing sites have been resolved.  
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were a number of minor unresolved quality issues having no 
impact on the Benefit/Risk ratio of the product, which pertain to characterization, validation of 
analytical methods, specifications, comparability and stability. These points have been agreed as 
recommendations for future quality development. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.7.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommended some points for investigation. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The  nonclinical  pivotal  safety  studies  and  biodistribution  were  conducted  in  compliance  with  Good 
Laboratory Practice (GLP). There are some minor deviations from the GLP principles in the safety studies, 
but they do not affect the overall integrity of the studies and their results.

Primary pharmacodynamics was assessed in C3/36 mosquito cells, mosquitoes, AG129 mice and Non-
Human Primates (NHPs). 
The Applicant has conducted a study in mosquito cells to address the replication competence of the 
vaccine candidates. The data provided indicate that in all the cases, the replication potential was 
reduced for the vaccine candidates, but at a different extent. Important differences were detected for 
the GMP-produced TDV-3, which are also more prominent considering that the C6/36 cells were 
infected at a lower starting multiplicity of infection (MOI) compared with the counterparts, TDV-1, 
TDV-2 and TDV-4. In this case, the viral titres compared to the wild-type virus (DEN-3 16562) are only 
10-100-fold lower, which is unexpected considering the lower starting MOI which should results in even 
a larger difference when compared with the other TDV candidates.  It was clarified in this regard that 
DENV-3 16562 was used at a lower MOI compared to the other wild-type viruses. Upon revision of the 
data, MOI used for DENV-3 was only 0.77x that of DENV-1, a really small difference. This lower MOI, in 
theory, would compensate for the lower starting MOI used for TDV-3. In addition, it appears that 
DENV-3 wild-type replicates itself at a lower rate compared to the other wild-type viruses. All this 
could justify the lower attenuation on replication compared to the other constructs. Still, the 
differences observed are of great magnitude, but this issue will not be followed as in vivo assays in 
mosquitoes have been conducted by the applicant, showing attenuation in replication for the TDV-3 
constructs. 
The studies provided by the Applicant demonstrate reduced vector competence for the vaccine 
candidates when addressing infection, dissemination and transmission in mosquitoes, both primary and 
secondary vectors (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, respectively) following infection by 
intrathoracic and/or oral infection. This is an important safety feature of the vaccine candidate, in the 
sense that attenuated vectors have low chances to be transmitted by mosquitoes from vaccinees to the 
unvaccinated population, through the natural infection route. 
Neurovirulence studies were performed in newborn ICR mice. Advice was sought from CHMP in this 
regard, which confirmed that based on the genetics of the vaccine candidates (considered as 
homogenous dengue compared to the previously authorised dengue vaccine, based upon Yellow Fever 
backbone) and the well-known profile (in terms of no or limited neurovirulence) of both the wild type 
dengue viruses and the parental strains (DEN-2 PDK-52) used for the generation of the TDV vaccine 
candidates, there was no need to test for neurovirulence in NHP. Neurovirulence is then discussed 
based on the literature references and the results from the study in newborn ICR mice. In this regard, 
data with ChiDEN candidates were already generated in the same animal model (newborn ICR mice), 
indicating no neurovirulence. The only difference between the current and previous studies resides on 
the origin of the mice employed: while the ICR mice used in the testing of TDV were purchased from 
Taconic, the mice employed in the ChiDEN testing corresponded to an ICR mouse colony maintained at 
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). 
Taconic mice were much more susceptible to infection with the candidates than were the ICR mice of 
the CDC colony, resulting in 68% of mortality for TDV-2 at a lower dose of 10E3 pfu. Similarly, the 
average mortality for ChiDEN-2 was 64%, at the same lower dose. For TDV-4, the mortality at 10E3 
pfu resulted in 18.5%. When higher dose levels were used (10E4 pfu), no mortality was seen with 
TDV-1 and TDV-3, but TDV-2 and TDV-4 turned out in 100% mortality. Although completely 
unexpected, the results at the lower dose are of lower magnitude compared to the neurovirulence of 
the wild type DEN-2 16681, which resulted in 100% mortality at 10E3 pfu, suggesting that indeed the 
vaccine candidates are attenuated for neurovirulence. However, the results are unforeseen compared 
to either the published literature and the previous results with ChiDEN viruses that showed no 
neurovirulence.

In addition, at the time advice was given, the biodistribution study was not yet completed. The results 
from the single dose biodistribution study showed that TDV2 was found in the brain of one animal at 
Day 42, the last time point addressed. In toxicity studies conducted in the same animal model (AG129 
mice) TDV was safe and well tolerated, with no other central nervous system (CNS) TDV-related 
findings. Neurovirulence of TDV, and in more detail TDV-2, was further analysed and discussed, 
contextualizing the findings from the biodistribution study and the additional histopathological 
assessment requested. The conclusions are summarized in the toxicology section.  
In vivo immunogenicity and challenge studies 
Several non-clinical in vivo studies were carried out to evaluate the immunogenicity and efficacy of 
subcutaneous (SC) administration of monovalent TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3 and TDV-4 and tetravalent TDV 
formulations. Most of the studies conducted employed the AG129 mouse model (deficient in interferon 
alpha/beta and gamma receptor signalling). In addition, a pilot study in a limited number of animals to 
assess immunogenicity and efficacy of different levels of all TDV components in cynomolgus macaques 
was also carried out. While both models have drawbacks, immunodeficiency in the former and the lack 
of overt DENV pathogenesis in the latter, they are considered relevant for the PD assessment of the 
vaccine candidate. 
Protection against DENV-3 challenge has not been assessed in AG129 mice. Although some protection 
data is available in NHPs, the number of animals assessed (N=2) in a pilot study is considered 
insufficient for a proper assessment. Of note, successful DENV-3 challenge studies have been described 
in the literature with the same animal model by the time of MAA submission. The Applicant claims that 
by the time this model was available, clinical immunogenicity data was already available, and therefore 
no additional challenge studies were carried out. Nonetheless, the challenge model in NHPs was 
available but no justification was provided for not carrying out the pivotal challenge study in this 
species. Since substantial clinical data is already available, carrying out additional challenge studies is 
not considered necessary. 
Immunogenicity of DENVax master virus seeds was assessed for monovalent TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3 
and TDV-4 MVS in the AG129 mouse model. Animals received a SC dose of 5.0 log10 PFU/per or 
control (PBS) on Day 0 and Day 42. Serum samples were analysed at Days 40 and 56 by a plaque 
reduction neutralization test (PRNT50). All vaccines elicited strong response against its wild type 
homolog, and to a lesser extent to other serotypes, although cross-reactive response was higher for 
DENV-3. Neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) increased approximately 2-fold with a second immunization 
only for TDV-1 and TDV-4 for its wild type homolog. TDV-2 and TDV-3 showed little or no variation 
after boost dose administration. Of note control animals also displayed low level response for DENV-3. 
The Applicant’s attributes this issue to the neutralization assay controls unexpected response only in 
DENV-3 as a result to a specific matrix interference which only occurs with DENV-3 and not with other 
serotypes. Since no pre-vaccination sera is available, this hypothesis cannot be confirmed or ruled out. 
DENV-1 or DENV-2 challenge assessment in AG129 mice after single dose monovalent immunization 
with all four serotypes (SC) resulted in protection against lethal challenge with DENV-1, while only 
TDV-1 and TDV-2 protected against lethal DENV-2 challenge. TDV-3 conferred only partially protection 
while TDV-4 only delayed onset of death. DENV-3 or DENV-4 serotypes were not included in this study. 
The Applicant could not provide this information since, according to the Applicant’s claims the 
information is not available since the study was carried out by another company prior to the acquisition 
of the product by Takeda, 
Different ratios of the monovalent vaccine components (TDV-2, TDV-2, TDV-3, TDV-4) impact on 
AG129 mice immunogenicity were assessed in a separate study. TDV 5:5:5:5 and 3:3:5:5 formulations 
administration to appears to result in the highest neutralization antibodies, although a high variability 
was observed in the data submitted. After two immunizations, increasing TDV-3 and TDV-4 dose from 
Assessment report

3.0 to 5.0 log10 PFU while maintaining unchanged the TDV-1 and TDV-2 dose in study DEN-009 
resulted in a more balanced neutralizing antibody response, nonetheless increasing the dose for all 
TDVs did not result in any marked increases with the exception of TDV-4. The Applicant claims that “it 
is likely that it is the degree of local replication (even in the absence of detectable viraemia), rather 
than the absolute amount of input virus, that significantly drives the resulting neutralizing antibody 
responses to each vaccine component”, nonetheless this statement was not adequately justified or 
supported with data. In the same line the claim that the dose administered is insensitive to changes 
once the minimal replication dose is achieved, is unsupported by data. 
When assessing single immunization in mice (Study SR-15-010) with quadrivalent TDV at 
approximately the same doses as in the previous study (Study DEN-009), data provided shows that 
the levels of neutralizing antibodies elicited for DENV-4 measured at Day 56 were more than 2 times 
higher than those reported after double immunization (single dose 279 GMT vs double dose 113). In 
addition, single dose elicited antibodies were also significantly higher than those reported after two 
immunizations for DENV-2 and DENV-3 but measured at different time points (Day 30 and Day 56 
respectively). Since Study SR-15-010 was a challenge study and because of immunization all mice 
were protected against DENV-4, the Applicant concluded that there was no interference. Nonetheless, 
this claim is not supported as the only issue that can be concluded is that all animals were protected in 
both groups in the conditions tested regardless the existence of any degree of interference or not.  
The question of uneven neutralizing antibodies and disproportional response to various tetravalent 
vaccine formulations remains unresolved from a non-clinical perspective and the Applicant’s response 
is deemed insufficient to clarify this concern. Since this issue can be better addressed in the clinical 
scenario, the concern will be not further pursued from a non-clinical perspective (see Clinical AR). 
Viraemia assessment shows increased levels for TDV 5:5:5:5 in all instances while no viraemia was 
reported using 3:3:5:5 formulation for TDV-1 and TDV-4. The number of viraemic animals and levels 
reported correlates with overall NAbs data. TDV-4 viraemia was detected in only one animal from the 
TDV 5:5:5:5 group. Clinical data obtained in exploratory immunogenicity analyses show that DENV-4 
type specific neutralizing antibodies were detected in the majority of samples from baseline 
seronegative trial participants. Although no relevant supporting data were provided for the lack of 
viraemia observed, clinical data (Trial DEN-301) shows that participants developed neutralizing 
antibodies to all 4 serotypes tested.  
Mice immunized with all vaccine formulation levels were also challenged with either DENV-1 strain 
Mochizuki at 6.0 log10 PFU or DENV-2 strain New Guinea C at 4.0 log10 PFU. All control mice but one 
(DENV-2 strain) succumbed to infection while all vaccinated animals survived. Immunization with TDV, 
TDV-2 and TDV-4 shows protection to lethal challenge to DENV-1 and DENV-2 strain in the conditions 
tested. 
Single dose immunization and protection to DENV-4 challenge was assayed also in the same mice 
species dosed SC with 0.2 mL of TDV (4.3 log10, 4.7 log10, 5.0 log10 and 5.5 log10 PFU/mL for TDV 
1-4, respectively), monovalent TDV-4 (5.5 log10 PFU/mL), monovalent TDV-2 (4.7 log10 PFU/mL) or 
FTA. TDV-2 elicited neutralizing antibodies to both DENV-3 and DENV-4. DENV-1 and 2 were not tested 
for monovalent assessment. TDV vaccine administration elicited neutralizing antibodies to all DENV 
strains. As seen in other presented data, NAbs against DENV-4 have shown the lowest levels 
regardless the type of vaccine administered. 
All DENV-4 challenged animals immunized with TDV-4 survived infection with no relevant clinical signs. 
One animal vaccinated with TDV-2 died on Day 27 post-challenge. Another vaccinated animal in the 
TDV group displayed reversible weight loss (>10%) and clinical signs. Viral ribonucleic acid (vRNA) 
(qRT-PCR) was only reported in some vaccinated animals by Day 3 post challenge, and all were VRNA 
negative by Day 5. All control animals remained positive to vRNA in all time points and all succumbed

to infection. Of note, TDV-4 monovalent administration resulted in a much higher level of DENV-4 
neutralizing antibodies as compared to the same dose level of the TDV vaccine which adds to the 
concern of the potential of interference among vaccine components. 
However, the detailed interference study data submitted by the Applicant (SR-15-010) show that the 
mean of DENV-4 neutralization antibody titres was slightly higher in the TDV vaccinated mice than in 
the mice vaccinated with the monovalent TDV-4. The presence of DENV-4 viral RNA could not be 
detected in the serum of any vaccinated mice after challenge, indicating that the immune response 
generated by the TDV vaccine is sufficient to clear DENV-4 virus. It is suggested that the cause of the 
weight loss that was observed in an animal in the TDV-vaccinated group after DENV-4 challenge could 
be an injury from handling or natural causes and it is not considered related to the viral infection. In 
addition, the death of an animal in the TDV-2 group is also not attributed to the DENV-4 challenge as it 
happened 19 days after the last death in the control group and no DENV-4 vRNA was detected in TDV-
2 vaccinated mice after Day 2 post challenge. 
An investigational study in order to select the most adequate species for DART evaluation, concluded 
that NZW rabbit was the optimal species of those tested (mice (CD1, Balb/C and C57Bl/6) or Sprague 
Dawley rats) since little to no antibody response was observed after immunization with TDV (Days 0, 
23 and 57) in rodents. All NZW rabbits elicited NAbs response also after the second TDV immunization. 
A pilot study in adult cynomolgus macaques vaccinated on Day 0 and 60 with a total of two SC doses 
of TDV formulations, composed of various ratios of TDV-1, -2, -3 and -4 viruses or FTA control, was 
carried out to assess immunogenicity and protection to all DENV serotypes. Animals were challenged 
on Day 90. This was the only study where protection against a DENV-3 challenge was evaluated.  
Immunogenicity data shows that neutralizing antibodies to all four dengue virus serotypes are detected 
following single and boost dose SC administration. Immunogenicity response was variable. Before the 
second boost dose administration, the formulation with higher percentage of seroconversion was the 
3:3:3:3 group for DENV-1 and DENV-2, but the 5:5:5:5 and 3:3:5:5 groups seroconversion 
percentages were higher for the latter. The 3:3:3:3 group PRNT50 values were also the highest for 
DENV-2 only throughout the study. The 3:3:5:5 group was the group that displayed an overall 
immunogenicity profile for all serotypes. The lowest NAbs titre and percentage of seroconversion was 
observed for DENV-4 while complete seroconversion in all animals was reported for the other three 
serotypes. FTA control animals on the DENV-1 immunogenicity assessment group displayed a 
significant Nabs titre. The low number of animals included precludes reaching any conclusion.  
The administration of TDV vaccine in this species shows also protective effects in challenged animals as 
compared to controls nonetheless the disease clinical signs induced are absent or too mild in order to 
take conclusions regarding protection to the clinical manifestations of the disease and protection 
assessment relied on plaque titration and vRNA detection which is considered acceptable. Viraemia 
duration post challenge was reduced in all vaccinated groups as compared to controls and did not last 
more than 3 days in vaccinated animals when plaque titration was used for the assessment. vRNA 
revealed longer viraemia duration in all groups, due to the higher sensitivity of the assay. The mean 
peak serum virus titre in vaccinated groups was lower than controls with levels ranging from 0-1.8 
log10 PFU/mL. Due to the low number of animals (2 animals per challenge per formulation), no clear 
conclusions can be drawn from this study. The 5:5:5:5 group animals did not present infectious virus 
particles following challenge in contrast with positive detection in two animals presenting infectious 
virus in blood for 3:3:5:5 for DENV-1 and DENV-2 and another positive detection for 3:3:3:3 for 
DENV-2. Viral RNA could be detected in all positive animals with evidence of infectious virus in the 
blood. The lack of detection of live virus in vaccinated animals suggests that the RNA detection was 
potentially associated to non-infectious virus.

No nonclinical assessment of different circulating dengue strains was included in the immunogenicity 
assessment. However, sera obtained in vaccinated participants is able to neutralize vaccine-matched 
and genetically diverse DENV strains. The Applicant proposes to use in patients the following serotypes 
and concentrations: 
TDV-1: ≥ 3.3 log10 PFU/dose; TDV-2: ≥ 2.7 log10 PFU/dose; TDV-3: ≥ 4.0 log10 PFU/dose; TDV-4: ≥ 
4.5 log10 PFU/dose. This formulation with the precise concentrations of each TDV component for use in 
human subjects has not been assessed in nonclinical PD studies. In study DEN-009 the concentration 
of TDV-1 was lower than the clinical formulation, whereas the concentration of TDV-2 was higher than 
the clinical formulation, and this study also supported the development of clinical formulations 
containing higher concentrations of TDV-3 and TDV-4. The formulation used in other pharmacology 
studies included higher concentrations of all TDV serotypes than the clinical formulation. Although the 
precise formulation was not evaluated in non-clinical studies, this is not considered a major concern 
since the limitations of animal testing in reflecting clinical efficacy in humans are acknowledged. 
Infection of vaccinated subjects with circulating wildtype virus may pose a risk of antibody-dependent 
enhancement based on observations of severe dengue disease in individuals following CYD-TDV 
dengue vaccination. This potential risk may be due to a lack of adequate immune response to all four 
serotypes, or due to waning antibody titres against one or several serotypes. The Applicant has not 
provided any studies to address the potential risk of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). 
Considering models to assess ADE have been described in the literature, the lack of such investigations 
is a limitation of the dossier. Although these data would have been welcomed, it is accepted that 
current ADE models are not necessarily predictive of the human situation and may be dispensable if 
the risk of ADE has been sufficiently considered and evaluated in the clinical development. The 
applicant provided a justification why small animal models are not appropriate (not permissive to a 
productive and symptomatic infection). Moreover, additional information regarding possible non-clinical 
antibody-dependent disease enhancement (ADE) has been incorporated in the RMP (SII). Overall, this 
is acceptable from a non-clinical point of view.  
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The absence of secondary pharmacodynamics studies is deemed acceptable. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
While no dedicated safety pharmacology studies were performed, CNS effects were evaluated as part 
of neurovirulence studies (Report DEN-014). CNS-associated organs (brain and spinal cord) were 
assessed histopathologically as part of the biodistribution (Report 5002340 and Module 2.6.4) and 
toxicology (Reports DEN-004, 5001168, 5001446) studies. There were no adverse findings reported. 
The lack of these studies was considered acceptable for the proposed vaccine and in line with the WHO 
guideline on the nonclinical evaluation of vaccines (Annex 1, WHO TRS 927) as well as the Guidelines 
on the quality, safety and efficacy of dengue tetravalent vaccines (Annex 2, WHO TRS 979). 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Dedicated pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies, such as the investigation of co-administration 
with other vaccines were not performed.  This is deemed acceptable.

2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
BIODISTRIBUTION 
No standard pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted by the Applicant, which is in line with the 
WHO guideline on nonclinical valuation of vaccines. Nonetheless, due to the nature of the product, the 
biodistribution assessment of the product is considered relevant. Dedicated absorption, metabolism 
and excretion studies were not performed as is appropriate for a product such as the Dengue 
Tetravalent Vaccine (TDV). 
TDV was investigated for Biodistribution and viral shedding of TDV in a GLP-compliant single dose 
study in AG129 mice. This study included toxicity assessment and used a validated quantitative assay 
(TDV serotype-specific, tetraplex RT-qPCR). 
According to validation report, the following parameters were validated: range of response, intra- and 
inter-assay precision and accuracy, specificity and selectivity, limit of detection, recovery, multiplex 
interference, and short-term, long-term and freeze-thaw stabilities of the isolated viral RNA. The 
sensitivity and specificity of the assay were satisfactory. The RT-qPCR method for quantification of viral 
RNA for TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3 and TDV-4 is deemed acceptable. 
In this study, a multiple of the highest clinical trial dose of TDV was administered to AG129 mice 
through clinically intended route (SC). TDV administration did not result in deaths or severe adverse 
findings. The dose information provided in 2.6 section corresponds to:   TDV 1: 5.1 log10 PFU/dose; 
TDV 2: 4.5 log10 PFU/dose; TDV 3: 5.4 log10 PFU/dose; TDV 4: 5.9 log10 PFU/dose. Five 
mice/sex/group were euthanized on Days 2 (24 hours post-dose), 6, 14, and 42 for the genomic viral 
RNA of each serotype in selected samples including the bone marrow, brain, heart, the injection site 
skin and muscle, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node (inguinal, axillary, mandibular), spleen, thymus, 
ovary, testis, saliva, serum, faeces, and urine. No other tissues (e.g. Peyer’s patches, gastrointestinal) 
were analysed and thus distribution to such lymphoid and non-lymphoid tissues cannot be excluded. 
Following SC product administration, all TDV serotypes were detected in the injection site on Day 2 and 
to a lesser extent in several lymph node samples. Maximal viraemia was observed by Day 6, being 
TDV-2 the serotype with higher levels of detection and to a lesser extent in TDV-3, TDV-1 and TDV-4. 
At Day 6, the maximal levels of TDV viral genomic RNA in the serum with widespread distribution to all 
tissues and organs analysed were evidenced. The main target tissues were the injection site (skin, 
muscle), spleen, the lymph nodes and liver. The viral RNA levels in other samples were apparently 
lower. As expected, TDV levels and distribution rapidly decreased over time. At Day 14, all samples of 
serum, spleen and liver which represent main target tissues became negative for TDV, and other TDV-
positive samples (injection site, lymph nodes) had significantly lower levels, which further decreased at 
Day 42, compared to values obtained at Day 6. These results demonstrated viral clearance occurring 
between Days 14 and 42. 
Shedding of viral vRNA was not reported in faeces, although low levels have been reported on Day 6 in 
urine in a single animal and a low level of vRNA was detected in saliva of 3 animals (TDV-2 group 
(1/10); TDV-3 (2/10).  
By Day 42 a substantial clearance has been observed. Positive samples were reported in the thymus 
(2/10) and also brain for TDV-2 (2/10). The levels vRNA levels were reduced in the thymus as 
compared to Day 14 but levels and number of positive animals remained unchanged for brain samples 
only for TDV-2 (Day 42). Four samples were also positive for TDV-2 (1/10) and TDV-3 (3/10) at Day 
42 in samples from the mandibular LN and only the one related to TDV-3 was >lower limit of 
quantification (LLOQ). In addition, only one injection site sample was positive for vRNA for TDV-2 but 
also >LLOQ at the last day of sampling.

The biodistribution profile observed for TDV could be considered expected for a live-attenuated vaccine 
in the immunocompromised AG129 mice. The potential mechanism for the TDV distribution to brain of 
AG129 mice is not fully understood and may partially be ascribed to the sensitivity of the species to 
distribution or persistence of vRNA in brain, due to lack of interferon responses and increased vascular 
permeability. Based on the integrated nonclinical studies (toxicology, neurovirulence) and clinical trial 
safety data, the Applicant states that the potential neurological risk associated with this finding was 
minimal. However, considering the unexpected neurovirulence and toxicological findings, this issue was 
further explored, and the conclusions are summarized in the toxicology section. The observation of the 
injection site, lymph nodes, spleen and liver as potential target tissues for high TDV exposure was also 
supportive of toxicological findings. Interestingly, TAK-003-related increase in spleen (males) weight 
was noted at Day 2 (24 hours post dose), while no vRNA were detectable in this tissue at this time 
point, and development of adaptive immune response within 24 hours post dose is also unlikely. The 
applicant assumed that the increases in spleen weight on Day 2 are likely to be related to increased 
cellularity, described as extramedullary haematopoiesis that this is not an unexpected outcome in the 
spleen. This reasoning could be acceptable, since TDV is designed to stimulate an immune response 
and the time course, as represented by the incidence and severity of the findings in the spleen, is 
consistent with a typical response to an immunomodulatory agent. In the absence of virus mediated 
inflammation, the observed change at 24 hours in the spleen weight might result from haematopoiesis-
related factors secondary to immune stimulation. 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
AG129 mice and NZW rabbits were selected as animal models for the general toxicity studies and 
reproductive toxicity studies, respectively. Although both species have limitations it is acknowledged 
that they are the most suitable species considering the almost negligible antibody response observed 
in other mouse strains and rats after TDV administration (see study SR-15-011 in section 2.1). Rabbits 
developed antibody response after 2 TDV doses but they are not permissive for viral replication. 
Therefore, the relevance of the results of the reproductive toxicity studies are limited (see additional 
discussion below). 
Different TDV batches were used in four safety studies.  Therefore, The Applicant clarified the 
composition and nature of each batch used in the pivotal toxicity studies and justified their 
representativeness with respect to the clinical batches.  Upon clarification, it can be confirmed that 
batches DToxB0010115 and DToxB0020115 (studies 5001168 and 5001446 respectively) were 
representative of Phase 2 clinical trials while batch PPQ0010617 (study 20129939) was representative 
of Phase 3 clinical trials.  
2.5.4.1.  Single and repeat dose toxicity 
A series of nonclinical general toxicity studies were conducted with TDV in AG129 mice. One pilot 
single-dose toxicity study (non-GLP) was conducted in AG129 mice to evaluate acute toxic effects of 
the vaccine. After subcutaneous injection of 5.6x10^5 PFU TDV, animals were observed for 11 days. In 
most of the vaccine-treated animals, transient minimal to mild inflammation in skin, haematopoiesis in 
spleen, transient increase of white blood cells and platelets were noted. In general, the findings were 
less severe than in wild-type DENV-2 treated animals. Three vaccinated mice developed testicular 
teratoma and one animal showed a testicular infarct with necrosis. In contrast, only one DENV-2 
treated mouse developed a teratoma and none were observed in the control group. AG129 mice are 
known to be susceptible for testicular teratoma. Nonetheless, TDV-treated mice showed a tendency of 
increased testicular teratoma, compared to the control animals. Although the applicant could not 
provide any in-house historical background data regarding testicular teratoma in AG129 mice, a 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 34/254 
 
 
 
 
published scientific article (Stevens and Little 1954) mentions a 1% mean incidence of testicular 
teratomas in this mice strain. Recent data about teratomas in AG129 mice were not provided. In 
contrast to this publication from 1954, TDV-treated AG129 mice showed a 0.68% incidence of 
testicular teratomas compared to a 0% incidence in control AG129 mice. It is considered that the 
higher incidence of testicular teratomas in the TDV-treated mice compared to control mice is not 
toxicological relevant because this incidence is still below the historical background incidence of 1%. 
Viraemia was also addressed in this study. Upon a single dose, AG129 mice treated with TDV or the 
wild type strain DENV-2 showed detectable viraemia through Day 7 in DENV-2 infected animals and 
Day 5 in TDV-vaccinated animals. Viraemia was highest on Day 3 post treatment in both groups with 
peak titres lower in the TDV group than in the DENV-2 group. Virus was isolated from clarified brain 
homogenates of the DENV-2 group primarily at Day 5 and no virus was detected in brain homogenates 
of any TDV-vaccinated animals.  
The Applicant conducted three different GLP repeat toxicity studies in AG129 mice with TDV. In the 
first study (DEN-004), wild type parental DENV-2 strain was included as a comparator to establish the 
suitability of the AG129 mice as a relevant species for toxicity testing of TDV. Marked differences in the 
severity of treatment-related effects were observed between the TDV and DENV-2 groups, with organ 
weight changes and histopathology observations more extensive in the wild type DENV-2 strain-
treated animals, including histological signs of encephalitis in the brain of two DENV-2 treated mice. In 
addition, clinical signs (rough fur coat) were observed in the DENV-2 group only. Therefore, it is 
acknowledged that the AG129 mouse is an appropriate model for detection of dengue virus-mediated 
pathological effects.  
In each GLP toxicity study a different TDV dose was administered (3.1x105, 5.93x106 and 1.07x107 
pfu/dose, corresponding to 5.5log10, 6.8log10 and 7.0log10 pfu/dose), these viral concentrations were 
equal to or above the human clinical dose. In all studies TDV was immunogenic and well tolerated. 
Replication of all four vaccine components was detected after the first administered dose, and 
treatment-related effects observed after the first administration were reversible or partially reversible 
and in most cases were considered expected observations following vaccination: increased in spleen 
weight that correlated with increased haematopoiesis, bone marrow myeloid cellularity, mild 
alterations in haematology and clinical chemistry, and inflammation at the injection site/skin.  
However, in all three studies there were histological signs of lung inflammation, apparently with 
greater severity after the last dose, although in study 5001446 the incidence and severity of 
histopathological findings in the lung were greater in the control group than in the treated group when 
a concurrent control group was available for comparison (Days 8 and 76). Unfortunately, there was no 
control group for the assessment of the findings on Day 49.  In addition, per protocol histopathological 
assessment was not conducted in the two mice found dead in this study with dark discoloration of the 
lung accompanied by dark fluid accumulation in the thoracic cavity in one of them and a conclusion 
cannot be drawn. 
Taken together, a relationship between the vaccine and the lung findings in mice cannot be entirely 
ruled out, even though in the clinical assessment of TDV, no safety signals regarding lung toxicity were 
observed.  
Another unexpected finding in the histopathology report was the presence of findings in the brain of a 
female animal (No. 2508) in study 5001446 (neutrophilic infiltration and mild multifocal, white 
matter/grey matter, with micro-abscesses/neuron degeneration/malacia). This finding was not 
adequately discussed by the Applicant in the toxicology written summary although there is a review of 
CNS data in toxicity studies including this finding in the Pharmacokinetic written summary of the 
dossier. The Applicant has provided an additional histopathology report concerning animal 2508 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 35/254 
 
 
 
 
(euthanized at D49). The conclusions of the new report are in accordance with the previous pathology 
analysis and stated that findings within the brain consisted of inflammation, necrosis, perivascular 
cuffing, meningeal inflammatory cell infiltration, and endothelial cell hypertrophy and were of uncertain 
relationship to administration of TDV. In addition, several points in support of this conclusion are also 
raised in the pathology report: the absence of detectable vRNA in blood beyond D8 post dose, no 
comparability between the observed histopathological lesions and characteristic viral or immune-
mediated encephalitis (although similarities were detected when the comparison was performed 
against Zika infection in AG129 mice), and the absence of acute liver failure (as a leading factor in 
dengue-associated CNS pathology). However, microscopic findings in the brain from this single test 
article-administered animal could not be ruled out as potentially test article-related, even in the 
absence of any other findings in this animal or in other vaccinated animals.   
In this regard, it should be noted that the biodistribution study (5002340), with single SC 
administration of TDV in AG129 mice showed presence of TDV-2 in brain in animals at Day 6, 14 and 
42. TDV-1 and TDV-3 were also detected in brain at Day 6, but not beyond that time point. This result 
indicated that TDV could reach the brain. Regarding the neurovirulence study, discordant results were 
found when different mouse colonies were used, which are presumably linked to the mice background. 
Although less virulent than the respective wild-type virus, 10^3 PFU of DENVax-2 still resulted in 
approximately 68% neurovirulence in ICR newborn mice, being this the lowest result obtained in three 
experimental rounds (Report DEN-014).  
The applicant concludes after examination of all the data that the risk for clinical neurovirulence for 
TDV is negligible and substantiates this conclusion on the inherent permissive features of the non-
clinical models used. The rationale for the animal model selection with the purpose of non-clinical 
assessment has been justified by the applicant in several sections of the dossier. However, the 
relevance of both models, suckling mice and AG129 mice can be considered as limited with the 
purpose of safety assessment of candidate dengue vaccines following WHO guidelines (Annex 2 
Guidelines on the quality, safety and efficacy of dengue tetravalent vaccines (live, attenuated) 
Replacement of Annex 1 of WHO Technical Report Series, No. 932). 
The pathologist report concludes on an uncertain relationship to the administration of the vaccine and 
indicates that the findings cannot be ruled out as potentially test-article related. This conclusion is 
supported even though no neurological symptoms were found in the clinical trials following 
administration of TDV.  
2.5.4.2.  Genotoxicity 
No genotoxicity studies were conducted with TDV, which is acceptable. 
2.5.4.3.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies were conducted with TDV, which is acceptable. 
2.5.4.4.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
The reproductive toxicity assessment, pilot study 20153701 was conducted according to the CHMP 
recommendation (Scientific Advice EMA/CHMP/SAWP/629331/2014) to consider the vaccination of a 
group of animals during gestation period only, without pre-mating dose, to assess the potential risk 
associated with TDV vector infection and replication during gestation period and TDV vector 
transmission into the foetus. In this study no significant or adverse inflammation was observed in 
Assessment report

rabbits after vaccine administration and therefore in the pivotal reproductive toxicity study an 
additional group vaccinated shortly after mating was not included.   
A combined embryo-foetal and pre/post-natal reproductive toxicity study was conducted in the New 
Zealand White rabbits. The test article was clinical lot TAK-003, which was produced using the final 
manufacturing process. A multiple (i.e. 2 times) of highest clinical dose of TAK-003 was administered 
subcutaneously (SC) to female rabbits on Study Days (SDs) 1, 21 and 42 (day of mating), and then on 
Gestation Days (GDs) 7 and 28 for a total of 5 occasions. The dose level and schedule were selected 
according to the pilot studies in this species and strain and is acceptable. The Caesarean sectioning 
group was terminated on GD29 and the natural delivery group was terminated at Lactation Day (LD) 
29. TAK-003-specific antibodies were detected in all F0 female rabbits and in 100% of foetuses at the 
end of gestation (GD29) and the natural delivery kits were 95%, 100%, 83% and 93% seropositive to 
DENV-1, -2, -3 and -4, respectively, at the end of lactation (LD29). 
Administration of TAK-003 caused transient grade 1 or 2 erythema and grade 1 oedema, but did not 
increase the incidence of clinical signs, maternal gross lesions or have an adverse effect on body 
weights, food consumption, and mating, fertility, or reproductive performance of the F0 generation 
does, as compared with the group administered the saline control. There were 5 unscheduled deaths of 
F0 generation does: 2 in saline control group euthanized on GD29 or LD26, and 3 in TAK-003 group all 
found dead on LD2, LD21 or LD25. Regarding the cause of death, the applicant reasoned that they 
may have been related to the reduced food consumption and bodyweight loss. The observed rate of 
unscheduled deaths of F0 generation falls into the historical range of variability in the testing facility. 
Histopathology analysis has not been conducted on these unscheduled deaths of animals and reasons 
for these deaths or abortions are not typically documented. 
Intrauterine examination or litter parameters evaluated at GD 29 were not adversely affected by 
maternal administration of TAK-003. No adverse effects were observed on foetal weight and no foetal 
gross external, soft tissue, or skeletal abnormalities related to administration of TAK-003. 
Maternal administration with TAK-003 did not result in adverse effects on clinical observations, body 
weights, organ weights, gross pathology observations or pre-weaning developmental observations in 
the F1 generation kits. At natural delivery, there were a total of 19 stillborn kits from 7 (29.2%) out of 
24 does in the TAK-003 group, which was higher than a total of 4 stillborn kits from 3 (15.8%) out of 
19 does in saline control group. However, the observed rate of does with stillborn in both study groups 
falls into historical range of variability in the testing facility for the tested species. Therefore, the 
observed imbalance is considered incidental and not TAK-003 related. It is also agreed that stillbirth is 
common and its rate is high in NZW rabbits.  
In addition, a total of 43 kits in saline control and 44 kits in TAK-003 group were found dead or 
euthanized early and necropsied. Only a fraction of them were found with no milk in the stomach as 
potential cause of death (22 in saline and 15 in TAK-003).  According to the Applicant, the cause for 
death of F1 kits is not limited to no milk in stomach, but may also include insufficient feeding of the 
kits or abandonment of the kits, etc. Death of F1 kits due to malformation was not mentioned but an 
imbalance in this aspect appears unlikely, given the foetal examination data from the Caesarean 
section of the study. In compliance with the study protocol, histopathology analysis was not conducted 
in these kits found dead or euthanized. 
TDV excretion in milk was not assessed in rabbits. 
As rabbits are not permissive for dengue virus replication, the relevance of the fertility and 
reproductive toxicity assessment in this species is limited.  
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

2.5.4.5.  Local Tolerance  
Local tolerance was assessed in repeat-dose studies in AG129 mice and in the reproductive and 
developmental toxicity study in rabbits. In these studies, non-adverse transient findings related to 
administration of TDV were observed both macroscopically (abnormal appearance) and 
microscopically (mixed cellular inflammation, necrosis, oedema, haemorrhage, vascular 
degeneration/necrosis, thrombosis, fibrosis, epidermal hyperplasia, hyperkeratosis, and cellular 
crusts) at the site of administration. These findings are consistent with vaccine administration and, 
generally, TDV was well tolerated. 
A separate local tolerance study is not warranted. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The characterization of the risk scenarios in relation to both seriousness and probability of harm as well 
as benefit of the TDV product, in the context of release of the GMO in endemic and non-endemic areas 
justify the use of TDV. The assessment did not identify any risks that require further control. The 
reasons for this include: 
• Safe history of evaluation of TDV in conventional studies of single dose, local tolerance, repeated 
dose toxicity, and toxicity to reproduction and development in AG129 mice and New Zealand White 
rabbits. 
• TDV viruses are dengue viruses, and as such are not known to be transmitted by shedding, but 
rather by bite from an infected mosquito vector. In a GLP-compliant single dose biodistribution and 
shedding study in AG129 mice, no shedding of TDV vRNA was detected in faeces and urine, and TDV-3 
was detected in saliva from one animal at day 6 only, confirming a low risk for vaccine shedding to the 
environment or transmission from vaccinees by shedding. 
• No serious allergic reactions or toxicity in people and other organisms have been observed to date.  
• TDV was generally well tolerated in clinical trials. To date, an estimated total of more than 19,000 
subjects have received more than 38,000 doses of different formulations of TDV. This included adults 
and children in both endemic and non-endemic areas and in these trials the TDV vaccine has been 
generally well tolerated, with an overall adverse event profile that is considered acceptable. 
• Limited ability of TDV to replicate in humans, nonhuman primates and AG129 mice. 
• Limited ability of TDV to replicate in the mosquito vectors Ae. aegypti and Ae. Albopictus and in 
C6/36 cells (Ae. albopictus derived) compared to wild type dengue viruses. 
• Highly unlikely contribution of maternal-foetal or mother to infant transmission of TDV to 
dissemination of the attenuated vaccine viruses in the environment. 
• Based on the MID50 for both Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus and the vaccine viral RNA levels present 
in TDV vaccinees, there is very limited potential for human-to-human TDV transfer by mosquito vector. 
• Limited ability and opportunity for TDV to undergo recombination with other viruses based on low 
levels of viral RNA present in vaccinees, and thereby transferring the introduced prM and E genes or 
transferring genes from the attenuated TDV-2 backbone. 
• TDV viruses have been shown to be genetically stable in vitro through the cell culture passages 
required for vaccine manufacture and in vivo in humans and animals. Limited reversion events have 
been observed for TDV, most often the 5 prime non-coding region locus and rarely at the NS1 locus. In

all cases, two of the three attenuation loci were maintained which are sufficient to retain the TDV 
attenuation phenotype 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Several experimental models were used for the assessment of the pharmacology of TDV vaccine 
candidates. Mosquitoes were employed for addressing the attenuation of TDV: the studies provided by 
the Applicant demonstrate reduced vector competence for the vaccine candidates when addressing 
infection, dissemination and transmission in mosquitoes.  
Neurovirulence was tested in newborn ICR mice. Although almost absent neurovirulence was expected, 
that was not the case for either ChiDEN-2 and TDV-2, but the percentage of mortality was reduced 
compared with wild-type DENV-2. Several non-clinical in vivo studies were carried out to evaluate the 
immunogenicity and efficacy of subcutaneous (SC) administration of monovalent TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3 
and TDV-4 and tetravalent TDV formulations. Most of the studies conducted employed the AG129 mice 
model (deficient in interferon alpha/beta and gamma receptor signalling). In addition, a pilot study in a 
limited number of animals to assess immunogenicity and efficacy of different levels of all TDV 
components in cynomolgus macaques was also carried out.  
Although the overall assessment of the immunogenicity elicited by the TDV vaccine and monovalent 
components and protection to wild-type DENVs infection in mice and cynomolgus macaques is 
promising, some other concerns have been identified. Those issues were further clarified and 
addressed below. 
Protection against DENV-3 challenge has not been assessed in AG129 mice. Although some protection 
data is available in NHPs, the number of animals assessed (N=2) is considered insufficient for a proper 
assessment. No adequate discussion has been provided. Successful DENV-3 challenge studies have 
been described in the literature with the same animal model (DENV-3). However, since substantial 
clinical data is already available, carrying out additional challenge studies is not considered necessary. 
The Applicant’s attributes this issue to the neutralization assay controls unexpected response only in 
DENV-3 as a result to a specific matrix interference which only occurs with DENV-3 and not with other 
serotypes. Since no pre-vaccination sera is available, this hypothesis cannot be confirmed or ruled out. 
The assessors could not locate the full report of the study titled “Immunogenicity and Efficacy of 
Chimeric Dengue Vaccine (DENVax) Formulations in Interferon-Deficient AG129 Mice”.  This report was 
not made available since, according to the Applicant’s claims, the information is not available as the 
study was carried out by another company prior to the acquisition of the product by Takeda. The Nabs 
response to various tetravalent vaccine formulations across pharmacology studies, is uneven and not 
proportional to the doses administered but no relevant justification has been submitted by the 
Applicant. This issue remains unresolved from a non-clinical perspective and the Applicant’s response 
is deemed insufficient to clarify this concern. Since this issue can be better addressed in the clinical 
scenario, the concern will be not further pursued from a non-clinical perspective (see Clinical AR). 
Although TDV-4 viraemia was detected in only one animal from the TDV 5:5:5:5 group (Report DEN-
009), clinical data (Trial DEN-301) shows that participants developed neutralizing antibodies to all 4 
serotypes tested. TDV-4 monovalent administration resulted in a much higher level of DENV-4 NAbs as 
compared to the same dose level of the TDV vaccine which adds to the concern of the potential of 
interference among vaccine components that should be discussed by the Applicant. In addition, one 
TDV vaccinated animal displayed weight loss, which contrasts with the lack of clinical effects in those 
animals vaccinated with monovalent TDV-4.  
No assessment of different circulating dengue strains was included in the immunogenicity assessment; 
however, sera obtained in vaccinated participants is able to neutralize vaccine-matched and genetically

diverse DENV strains.  The Applicant proposes to use in patients the following serotypes and 
concentrations: TDV-1: ≥ 3.3 log10 PFU/dose; TDV-2: ≥ 2.7 log10 PFU/dose; TDV-3: ≥ 4.0 log10 
PFU/dose; TDV-4: ≥ 4.5 log10 PFU/dose. Although the precise formulation proposed for clinical use 
was not evaluated in non-clinical studies, this is not considered a major concern. Infection of 
vaccinated subjects with circulating wildtype virus may pose a risk of antibody-dependent 
enhancement based on observations of severe dengue disease in individuals following CYD-TDV 
dengue vaccination. This potential risk may be due to a lack of adequate immune response to all four 
serotypes, or due to waning antibody titres against one or several serotypes. The Applicant has not 
provided any studies to address the potential risk of antibody dependent enhancement (ADE). 
Considering that models to assess ADE have been described in the literature, the lack of such 
investigations are a limitation of the dossier. Although these data would have been welcomed, it is 
accepted that current ADE models are not necessarily predictive of the human situation and may be 
dispensable if the risk of ADE has been sufficiently considered and evaluated in the clinical 
development. The applicant provided a justification why small animal models are not appropriate (not 
permissive to a productive and symptomatic infection). Moreover, additional information regarding 
possible non-clinical antibody-dependent disease enhancement (ADE) has been incorporated in the 
RMP. No standard pharmacokinetic studies have been conducted by the Applicant, which is in line with 
the WHO guideline on nonclinical evaluation of vaccines. A GLP-compliant study to assess the 
biodistribution and shedding of the four serotypes of the vaccine candidate in AG129 mice was 
performed in support of the biodistribution of the product. In this study, a multiple of highest clinical 
trial dose of TDV was administered to AG129 mice through clinically intended route (SC). TDV 
administration did not result in deaths or relevant clinical adverse findings. Upon administration, TDV-
1, TDV-2, TDV-3 and TDV-4 were detected in the injection site at Day 2 and in several lymph nodes. 
Maximal viraemia was achieved at Day 6 being TDV-2 and TDV-4 the serotypes with the highest and 
lowest levels, respectively. During the course of the study, several microscopic and microscopic 
findings of minor or moderate relevance were found in some tissues, including bone marrow, spleen, 
mandibular lymph nodes and injection site; however, at Day 42, the last study day, those findings 
were reported as recovered or partially recovered, indicating a transient nature. By Day 42 most 
tissues were negative for vRNA, with several exceptions. These results demonstrated viral clearance 
occurring between Days 14 and 42. It should be noted that TDV-2 was detected in brain in one animal 
at Day 42 but this finding was not associated with clinical observations of histological hallmarks. 
Interestingly, TDV-related increase in spleen (males) weight was noted at Day 2 (24 hours post dose), 
while no vRNA were detectable in this tissue at this time point, and development of adaptive immune 
response within 24 hours post dose is also very unlikely.  The applicant assumed that the increases in 
spleen weight on Day 2 are likely to be related to increased cellularity, described as extramedullary 
haematopoiesis that this is not an unexpected outcome in the spleen. This reasoning is accepted since 
TDV is designed to stimulate an immune response and the time course, as represented by the 
incidence and severity of the findings in the spleen, is consistent with a typical response to an 
immunomodulatory agent. In the absence of virus mediated inflammation, the observed change at 24 
hours in the spleen weight might result from haematopoiesis-related factors secondary to immune 
stimulation. 
Regarding the shedding, vRNA was not detected in faeces, albeit lower levels were seen in urine and 
saliva for some animals. 
AG129 mice and NZW rabbits were selected as animal models for the general toxicity studies and 
reproductive toxicity studies, respectively. Although both species has limitations it is accepted that 
they are suitable species considering the almost negligible antibody response observed in other mouse 
strains and rats after TDV administration.

A series of non-clinical general toxicity studies were conducted with TDV in AG129 mice. Wild type 
DENV-2 was used as a comparator in the single dose study and one of the repeat-dose studies in order 
to establish the suitability of the AG129 mice as a relevant species for toxicity testing of TDV. Marked 
differences in the severity of treatment-related effects were observed between the TDV and DENV-2 
groups, including histological signs of encephalitis in the brain of some DENV-2 treated mice. 
In all general toxicity studies TDV was immunogenic and well tolerated. Replication of all four vaccine 
components was detected after the first administered dose, and treatment-related effects were 
observed after the first administration that were reversible or partially reversible and in most cases 
were considered expected observations following vaccination: increased in spleen weight that 
correlated with increased haematopoiesis, bone marrow myeloid cellularity, mild alterations in 
haematology and clinical chemistry and inflammation at the injection site/skin.  
The parental AG129 sub-strain is known to be susceptible to spontaneous occurrence of testicular 
teratoma, and in this respect, great caution needs to be exercised to interpret the finding of testicular 
teratoma in the TDV-treated AG129 mice in the single dose toxicity study. Although it is considered 
that the higher incidence of testicular teratomas in the TDV-treated mice compared to control mice is 
not toxicological relevant because this incidence is still below the historical background incidence of 
1%, a vaccine-related effect cannot be fully excluded.   
In all three studies there were histological signs of lung inflammation, apparently with greater severity 
after the last dose. Although some control animals showed similar findings, a relationship with the 
treatment cannot be excluded. In addition, two TDV-treated mice found dead in study 5001446 
showed dark discoloration of the lung accompanied by dark fluid accumulation in the thoracic cavity in 
one of them.  Although in this study the incidence and severity of histopathological findings in the lung 
were greater in the control group than in the treated group, no control group at Day 49 was available.  
Moreover, per protocol histopathological assessment was not conducted in the two mice found dead in 
this study and a conclusion cannot be drawn. However, no safety signal related to lung toxicity was 
detected in the clinical trials. 
Also, as unexpected finding in the histopathology report was the presence of findings in the brain of a 
female animal (No. 2508) in study 5001446 (neutrophilic infiltration and mild multifocal, white 
matter/grey matter, with micro-abscesses/neuron degeneration/malacia). There was no vRNA detected 
in serum on Day 49 (vRNA was not detectable in serum past Day 8, even with repeated dosing), 
indicating a low likelihood of infectivity. In addition, there were no correlative clinical observations or 
haematology changes indicative of infection, neuro-manifestations, or any adverse effects in Animal 
2508.  However, taking into account that encephalitis is an atypical manifestation of dengue and the 
unexpected results obtained in the neurovirulence study (68.8% neurovirulence of 10^3 PFU DENVax-
2), further discussion of this issue was requested, contextualizing the findings from the biodistribution 
study and the additional histopathological assessment requested for Animal 2508. The additional 
pathology report provided in the responses concludes on an uncertain relationship to the 
administration of the vaccine and indicates that the findings cannot be ruled out as potentially test-
article related, even in the absence of any other findings in this animal or in other vaccinated animals. 
It should be noted as well that the biodistribution study (5002340) showed presence of TDV-2 in brain 
and despite being less virulent than the respective wild type virus, 10^3 PFU of DENVax-2 still resulted 
in approximately 68% neurovirulence in ICR newborn mice. The applicant concludes on a negligible 
risk for neurovirulence, which is supported by the absence of neurological signs in the clinical trial and 
ascribes the observed results to the inherent permissive features of the non-clinical models used 
although some uncertainties remain regarding the potential relationship of the described findings with 
vaccine administration.

The developmental and reproductive toxicity of TDV vaccine was assessed in NZW rabbits, according to 
the feedback of the CHMP/EMA. There were a few positive findings including unscheduled deaths of F0 
generation of animals and imbalanced number of stillborn kits at natural delivery. Regarding the 
unscheduled deaths of F0 generation, this could be due to reduced food consumption and bodyweight 
loss with the observed rate of deaths falling into the historical range of variability in the testing facility. 
The observed rate of does with stillborn also falls into the historical range of variability. 
TDV elicited an immune response in 100% of the rabbits prior to mating, and antibodies were detected 
in >83% of kits delivered by Caesarean section or natural delivery. However, as rabbits are not 
permissive for dengue virus replication the relevance of the fertility and reproductive toxicity 
assessment in this species is limited.  
The omission of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies with TDV vaccine is acceptable due to the 
nature of the product. Local tolerance of TDV vaccine was assessed in GLP-compliant repeat-dose 
toxicity studies, which is acceptable. 
All potential hazards for both unintended recipients and the environment have been identified. Given 
the nature of the GMOs (four live attenuated virus strains), the manufacturing controls, the stability of 
the attenuating genotype, the lack of shedding, the need for a mosquito vector to transmit, the limited 
ability to replicate in humans, animals and mosquito vectors, etc, it is concluded that any risks of harm 
from the proposed use of TDV and release into the environment are considered negligible to either 
people and animals or the environment. 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
From a non-clinical point of view, there are no outstanding issues precluding a Marketing authorisation.

Table 3: Ongoing Clinical Studies Included in Safety Snap Shot (CSRs not included in 
submission) 
A total of 18 trials (7 phase 3 trials, 6 phase 2 trials, and 5 phase 1 trials) with more than 
27,000 subjects (19,980 subjects received any TDV) from dengue-endemic and non-endemic regions, 
and covering an age range from 1.5 to 60 years comprise the overall clinical development program of 
TDV. 
Data from these 18 clinical trials are included in this submission: phase 1 Trials DEN-101, DEN-102, 
DEN-103, DEN-104, and DEN-105; phase 2 Trials DEN-106, DEN-203, DEN-313, DEN-204, DEN-205, 
and DEN-210 (preliminary safety data only); phase 3 Trials DEN-301, DEN-304, DEN-315, DEN-305, 
DEN-314, DEN-303 (preliminary safety data only), and DEN-307 (preliminary safety data only). 
The seven trials described in the Pharmacology section that contributed to the selection of TDV 
formulation, the selection of the lyophilized formulation and the selection of the subcutaneous route of 
administration (DEN-101, DEN-102, DEN-103, DEN-104, DEN-106, DEN-203, DEN-205). Other trials

described in this section contributed to selection of the dosing schedule and the characterization of the 
immune response induced by TDV (DEN-204, DEN-205, and DEN-313).  The pivotal Phase 3 (efficacy 
and safety) was DEN-301, and additional phase 3 Trials (DEN-304 and DEN-315) allowed 
characterizing the immunogenicity induced by the vaccine in subjects from non-endemic areas. An 
assessment of immunogenicity when TDV is co-administered with a vaccine against the yellow fever 
(YF) virus (DEN-305) or hepatitis A virus (DEN-305 and DEN-314) are also included in this MAA.  
For 3 ongoing trials (DEN-307, DEN-303 and DEN-210) only preliminary safety data are available. 
Overall, cumulative safety data up to a cut-off date of 01 October 2020 (approximately 6 months prior 
to first filing) are presented in this clinical overview. 
Additionally, booster dose evaluations are planned in 2 studies (within dengue-endemic and 
non-endemic areas) with data becoming available at later date (ie, not included in this submission). 
This includes a protocol amendment for Trial DEN-301 and a planned booster dose as part of the 
ongoing phase 3 Trial DEN-303. Trial DEN-301 will investigate a booster injection in the subset of 
approximately 10,500 subjects aged 4 to 11 years at the time of enrolment into Trial DEN-301, to be 
given 4 to 4.5 years after the second dose of the primary vaccination in endemic regions, and safety 
follow-up will continue up to approximately 2 years after the booster dose. 
Trial DEN-303 will investigate a booster injection given 36 months after the first dose of the primary 
vaccination in non-endemic regions, and follow-up for safety and immunogenicity will continue until 
6 months after the booster dose. 
2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics 
Clinical pharmacology trials, including pharmacokinetic trials, were not appropriate for this vaccine and 
were therefore not performed. Pharmacodynamic studies for this vaccine, as it is usual for many other 
vaccines, consists of the analyses of the immune response induced, and these data are described 
below.

Validated Assays 
The bioanalytical methods used for characterization of TDV can be grouped into 2 major categories 
depending on the assessed clinical objective; immunogenicity evaluation by using the functional 
dengue microneutralization (MNT) assay and various enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) 
versus efficacy and viraemia evaluation by means of molecular real-time polymerase chain reaction 
(RT-PCR) and sequencing assays. 
Dengue MNT 
The plaque reduction neutralization test titre resulting in a reduction of at least 50% (PRNT50) as 
described in the WHO Guidelines is a standardized method to test immunogenicity of dengue vaccine 
candidates. While other serological tests (eg, complement fixation and hemagglutinin inhibition) are 
available, only neutralizing antibody (NAb) tests, including PRNT, measure functional antibody 
responses. The PRNT is currently considered the gold-standard assay for the measurement of 
functional, dengue neutralizing antibodies in human serum. 
The dengue MNT assay represents the primary assay for assessing the immune response following TDV 
administration. All trials included in this submission used this MNT assay format for assessing the 
immunogenicity endpoints. In the context of evaluating vaccine efficacy, the MNT assay is also used to 
determine subject serostatus at baseline. Furthermore, MNT results are used to support 
immunobridging across age groups, with the exploratory Anti-dengue NS1 IgG assay providing 
supportive data.  
The MNT assay is applied to quantify virus-neutralizing antibodies (i.e., antibody titres) present in 
human sera following vaccination with TDV. In order to best measure the neutralizing response against 
the vaccine, the four wild-type virus strains representing TDV parental components are used in the 
assay. 
The MNT assay is based on the inactivation of the dengue virus in the presence of NAbs in the serum of 
subjects dosed with a dengue vaccine or subjects infected with the DENV. The inactivation of the virus 
by these antibodies prevents the virus from replicating. This causes a reduction in the number of 
immunofoci in a dengue virus-susceptible cell culture, which is quantitatively related to the amount of 
NAbs in the serum. 
The MNT assay was qualified during the end of phase 1 and beginning of phase 2 development. The 
MNT assay was validated prior to the start of the phase 3 trials.  
RT-PCRs  
RT-PCR was used to detect dengue viraemia either as an outcome of dosing (within 30 days of dosing) 
or as a means of detecting DENV during the period designated for evaluation of various efficacy 
endpoints. While TDV viraemia was evaluated using the validated vaccine screening RT-PCR, the 
validated, quantitative dengue detection RT-PCR served as primary tool for laboratory diagnosis of 
dengue infection and hence for evaluation of TDV efficacy in phase 3. 
Dengue Detection RT-PCR 
This tetraplex RT-PCR assay is designed to detect all 4 dengue serotypes testing virus RNA after 
purification from human serum. Both the qualitative and quantitative dengue detection RT-PCR 
methods are used to reverse transcribe and amplify a portion of the type-specific dengue virus 
genome.  
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 49/254 
 
 
 
 
 
To discern between wild type and vaccine virus Dengue RNA every positive RT-PCR result for febrile 
illness samples collected within 30 days of vaccination triggered the downstream sequencing of the 
affected samples by TDVSeq. 
Vaccine Screening RT-PCR 
This tetraplex RT-PCR assay is designed to detect and quantify all 4 serotypes testing virus RNA after 
purification from human serum. RT-PCR technology is used to reverse transcribe and amplify a portion 
of the serotype-specific dengue vaccine virus genome. 
The technique is the same in terms of the assay steps as previously described for Dengue Detection 
RT-PCR. 
This method was validated. 
Sequencing Assays 
As revealed experimentally, the dengue detection RT-PCR as well as the vaccine screening RT-PCR 
showed some level of cross-reactivity in detecting dengue wild-type and TDV strains. Thus, samples 
that tested positive within 30 days after vaccination for either of the 2 RT-PCR assays were subject to 
sequencing. To differentiate between wild-type and vaccine dengue virus as well as to reveal genetic 
TDV stability, 2 assays that sequence TDV unique regions were employed: Vaccine Confirmation 
Sequencing (the validated vaccine confirmation sequencing assay was designed to sequence the 
dengue genome at 3 known TDV attenuation sites in the 5′-noncoding region) and the TDV Sequencing 
(this validated assay was designed to sequence and identify certain TDV RNA regions. 
Serology ELISAs 
The validated IgG, IgM, and NS1 ELISA assays were used to assess the serological profile of suspected 
dengue cases to support evaluation of exploratory clinical endpoints. All 3 ELISA assays were 
performed using commercially available kits that were validated for their specific application in 
measuring clinical samples. All three methods were validated and the corresponding validation reports 
have been submitted. 
IgG and IgM ELISA 
The principle of the IgG and IgM ELISA assays is based upon exposing sera to dengue antigens that 
are attached to the surface of the ELISA plate. Dengue-specific IgG or IgM antibodies bound to the 
dengue antigens are detected by the addition of an anti-IgG or anti-IgM NAb complexed to HRP, which 
following addition of a substrate effects a colorimetric change that is detected by the ELISA reader. 
NS1 Antigen 
The dengue virus NS1 antigen ELISA is designed to detect dengue NS1 protein present in human 
serum.  
Assays for Coadministration Trials 
Yellow Fever 
The PRNT for yellow fever (YF) virus was used to determine the NAb levels following the administration 
of an YF vaccine (YFV) or in conjunction with trials for vaccines to be administered in YF virus endemic 
regions, such as dengue vaccines. 
This assay was validated. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 50/254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hepatitis A 
Since there are currently no commercially available anti-hepatitis A ELISA kits that are validated to 
meet the international clinical standard for hepatitis A virus (HAV) seroprotection, an ELISA kit was 
developed.  
This assay was validated.  
Cellular Immunity 
To further characterize the immune response induced by TDV, CMI was assessed using an enzyme-
linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay. The ELISPOT assay measured the production of antiviral cytokine 
interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) by dengue-specific T-cells. 
This method was qualified.  
An intracellular cytokine staining (ICS) assay was used to further characterize the CMI induced by TDV. 
During early clinical development the applied ICS assays were designed to measure antigen-specific T-
cell responses by stimulating cryopreserved, peripheral blood mononuclear cells in vitro using dengue 
virus-specific peptide pools matching relevant virus-specific antigens. After stimulation, cells were fixed 
and permeabilized before staining for selected intracellular cytokines, which finally allowed measuring 
the frequency of activated, antigen-specific CD4 and CD8 cells. 
This assay was optimised in order to make it fit-for-purpose, but it has not been qualified nor 
validated. 
Other Exploratory Assays 
Exploratory immunology testing of samples from Good Clinical Practice-compliant clinical phase 2 and 
3 trials was performed in non-Good Laboratory Practice (GxP) laboratories to broadly characterize 
immune responses elicited by TDV in seronegative children and adults, and in seropositive children. 
Many of these assays have not been qualified nor validated. They are briefly described below. 
Dengue 2 Depletion and Reporter Virus Particle Assay 
To assess the type-specific neutralizing antibody response to the other serotypes, antibody depletion 
was used to remove antibodies against DENV-2 from human serum samples with neutralizing antibody 
titres of >20 for all 4 dengue serotypes. The DENV-2 antibody depleted samples were then assessed 
for type specific neutralizing antibody response to DENV-1, DENV-3 and DENV-4 using an RVP assay. 
Dengue IgG Avidity Assay 
A Bio-Layer Interferometry (BLI) based avidity assay was developed to characterize avidity of 
polyclonal sera, as an indicator of affinity maturation of the polyclonal antibody response following 
vaccination.  
Anti-Dengue NS1 IgG Assay 
An indirect ELISA was developed to quantitate the IgG response to NS1 of DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, 
and DENV-4.  
Dengue Microneutralising Assay for Breadth of Neutralization 
This dengue virus neutralization assay was used to measure the level of neutralizing antibodies 
(MNT50) to antigenically diverse DENV strains in order to determine the breadth of the neutralizing 
antibody response elicited by TDV. Three strains representing 3 distinct genotypes within each 
Assessment report

serotype (DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV-4) were used in this assay: the parental TDV wild-type 
strains and 2 other antigenically distinct strains. 
Anti-Dengue Complement Antibody Assay 
This assay was designed to simultaneously determine the magnitude of anti-dengue virus complement-
fixing antibody responses directed against all 4 vaccine components.  
Trials that contributed to the selection of TDV formulation, route of administration and 
vaccination schedule

SUMMARY OF IMMUNOGENICITY RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL TRIALS 
For the sake of brevity figures are only shown for the first trial (DEN-101) and for the rest of the trials 
the results are explained in text. 
Trial DEN-101 
This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 1 dose-escalation trial conducted at a 
single site in the United States (a non-endemic region) to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of 
TDV in healthy adult subjects. The trial evaluated LD TDV and HD TDV when given subcutaneous (SC) 
or intradermal (ID). 
A total of 72 healthy baseline seronegative male and female subjects (48 receiving TDV and 
24 receiving placebo), 18 to 45 years of age were randomised in 1:1 ratio in four groups.  
The primary objective was to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a 2-dose schedule of TDV given 
either SC or ID. The secondary objectives were to assess the immunogenicity of TDV to all 4 serotypes 
and to assess the viraemia derived from the attenuated vaccine viruses measured on Days 0 
(baseline), 2, 4, 5/6, 7, 9, 11, and 14 after each dose.

Results 
HD TDV and LD TDV elicited neutralizing antibodies against all 4 serotypes; MNT GMTs were overall 
highest against DENV-2 and lowest against DENV-4 (see Figure 3). The MNT GMTs against DENV-1 and 
DENV-2 were notably higher in the HD TDV groups than in the LD TDV groups. There was no 
meaningful difference in the MNT GMTs based on the route of administration (SC or ID). MNT GMTs at 
Months 6 and 9 were lowest for DENV-4.

The seropositivity rates varied between the HD TDV and LD TDV groups at the different visits, but overall, 
the seropositivity rates were higher in the HD TDV groups than in the LD TDV groups for DENV-1 and 
DENV-2.  
More subjects in the HD TDV groups (40.0% when given ID and 50.0% when given SC) had antibodies 
to at least 3 serotypes at Month 9 (ie, 6 months after the second dose) than subjects in the LD TDV 
groups (22.2% when given ID and SC).

DEN-101 
In conclusion, immunogenicity to all 4 serotypes was observed when administered as LD TDV or 
HD TDV and given SC or ID. The MNT GMTs were generally higher in the HD TDV groups than in the 
LD TDV groups, especially against DENV-1 and DENV-2. The SC route of administration was better 
tolerated than ID. 
Trial DEN-102 
This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 1, dose-escalation trial conducted at a 
single site in Colombia (a non-endemic region of the country) to investigate the safety and 
immunogenicity of LD TDV and HD TDV when given SC or ID in healthy adult subjects. 
A total of 96 healthy baseline seronegative male and female subjects (79 receiving LD TDV or HD TDV 
and 17 receiving placebo), 18 to 45 years of age were randomised in a 23:5 ratio in four groups.  
The primary objective of this trial was to assess the safety and tolerability of LD TDV and HD TDV 
administered SC or ID. The secondary objectives were to assess the immunogenicity of TDV. The 
assessment of viraemia derived from the attenuated vaccine viruses was performed on 
Days 0 (baseline), 2, 4, 5/6, 7, 9, 11, and 14 after each dose.

In general, the HD TDV groups (administered SC or ID) had higher MNT GMTs and seropositivity rates 
to at least 2 serotypes compared with the LD TDV groups. MNT GMTs in the HD TDV, SC group were 
higher against DENV-1 and DENV-2 and were lower against DENV-3 and DENV-4 compared with MNT 
GMTs in the HD TDV, ID group. However, results were similar between the ID and SC administration 
routes within the LD TDV or HD TDV groups, respectively. 
At 1 month after the second dose, ie, Month 4 (Day 120), the HD TDV SC group had higher MNT GMTs 
compared with the LD TDV SC group against DENV-1 (181.8 vs 128.6) and DENV-2 (1536.1 vs 206.6). 
The responses against DENV-3 and DENV-4 were generally lower and varied between the doses and 
routes of administration. 
Seropositivity rates were generally higher in the HD TDV groups than in the LD TDV groups). The 
durability of response was low against DENV-4. Seropositivity rates at Month 9 were highest in the HD 
TDV SC and ID groups against DENV-1 and DENV-2 (89.5%-100.0%), highest in the HD TDV ID group 
against DENV-3 (88.2%), and highest in the LD TDV ID group against DENV-4 (57.1%). 
At Month 4, both LD TDV and HD TDV given ID returned higher seropositivity rates for all 4 serotypes 
compared with SC dosing (71.4% and 70.6%, respectively [ID] compared with 57.9% in the LD TDV, 
SC group and 47.4% in the HD TDV, SC group). 
In conclusion, at Month 4, higher seropositivity rates for DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 were seen in 
the HD TDV groups, when given ID or SC, compared with the LD TDV groups. Higher seropositivity 
rates for DENV-4 were seen when HD TDV was given ID compared with SC. Higher seropositivity rates 
for all 4 serotypes were reported in subjects receiving ID compared with SC administration at Month 4. 
Results from this trial supported the use of HD TDV over LD TDV, but with a need to identify a viral 
content that elicits a stronger response against DENV-4.  
Trial DEN-103 
This was a partially blinded (ie, the subjects, investigators, and other staff were blinded to the trial 
vaccine [LD TDV or placebo], but not to the delivery device), randomised, parallel-group, phase 1b 
trial conducted at multiple sites in the United States (a non-endemic region) to investigate the safety 
and immunogenicity of LD TDV in healthy adult subjects. The trial evaluated various dose schedules of 
LD TDV: 2 injections given 3 months apart, 2 simultaneous injections in different arms, and 
3 injections administered as 2 simultaneous injections in different arms and a single injection 3 months 
later; and when administered with 2 different devices: a PharmaJet needle-free injector and a 
needle-syringe. 
However, enrolment for Trial DEN-103 was closed early when significant local reactogenicity was seen 
after ID administration compared to the SC administration in Trials DEN-101 and DEN-102. It was then 
decided not to pursue the ID route of administration for further development. 
Prior to closing enrolment, a total of 67 healthy adult male and female subjects, 18 to 45 years of age 
were randomised in a 1:1:1:1 ratio in four groups.  
The primary objective was to compare the safety and tolerability of various dose schedules and 
different devices for ID administration and to compare the immunogenicity to each of the 4 serotypes 
between these dose schedules and devices. The secondary objectives were to assess the MNT GMTs in 
a population without previous exposure to dengue or other known flaviviruses after each immunization 
and to assess the incidence of viraemia on Days 0 (baseline), 7, 10, 14, 21, 90, 97, and 104.

Results 
The highest MNT GMTs after the first dose were observed for DENV-2 in all trial groups. MNT GMTs for 
DENV-2 were higher after 2 simultaneous injections of LD TDV than after a single LD TDV injection, 
regardless of the device. MNT GMTs for DENV-2 were also higher following administration with the 
PharmaJet needle-free injector than with the needle-syringe after a single LD TDV injection. MNT GMTs 
for DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4 remained low in all trial groups. 
A noticeable increase in MNT GMTs was observed for all 4 serotypes following second LD TDV injection 
at Month 3. Overall, MNT GMTs for each of the 4 serotypes decreased over time but GMTs for DENV-2 
remained substantially above baseline at the end of the follow-up period in all groups. 
Two simultaneous injections of LD TDV at Month 0, followed by a third LD TDV injection at Month 3 
with the PharmaJet needle-free injector resulted in higher maintained seropositivity rates for DENV-1 
and DENV-2 at Month 4 and Month 9 compared with the group which followed the same dose schedule, 
but with placebo instead of LD TDV at Month 3. 
A single LD TDV injection at Month 0 with the PharmaJet needle-free injector resulted in higher 
seropositivity rates for DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 at Month 1 and Month 3 than injection by 
needle-syringe. Conversely, the seropositivity rates for DENV-4 were higher with the needle-syringe 
than with the PharmaJet needle-free injector at all time points. 
A third injection of LD TDV at Month 3 induced higher seropositivity rates for DENV-2 at Month 3, 
Month 4, and Month 9 than a second LD TDV injection, regardless of the device. 
In conclusion, two simultaneous injections of LD TDV showed the potential to improve seropositivity 
rates for DENV-1 and DENV-2 and to increase the MNT GMTs for DENV-2. A noticeable increase in 
MNT GMTs was observed for all 4 serotypes following second LD TDV injection at Month 3. Due to the 
higher local reactogenicity following ID administration observed in other trials without consistent 
improvement of immune responses, the ID administration route was not pursued for further 
development. 
Trial DEN-104 
This was a randomised, 3-part, multicentre, phase 1b trial conducted in the United States 
(a non-endemic region) to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of HD TDV in healthy adult 
subjects. The trial evaluated 2 potential strategies to improve immune responses against DENV-4, by 
increasing the content of TDV-4 in the product (named, HD2 TDV), and by administering 2 doses (one 
in each arm on the same day), to possibly activate immune cells and antigen presenting cells that 
traffic to 2 different sets of lymph nodes. The trial also explored the impact of a 10-fold reduction in 
potency of TDV by administering a 1/10 dilution of the HD TDV product (named, HD/10 TDV). All doses 
were given SC. 
A total of 140 healthy male and female subjects, 18 to 45 years of age were randomised to the several 
trial groups. 
The primary objective was to compare the safety and tolerability of different dose schedules and to 
compare the immunogenicity to all 4 serotypes between these dose schedules. The secondary 
objectives were to assess the viraemia derived from the attenuated vaccine viruses measured on 
Days 0 (baseline), 7, 9, 11, 14, 17, 21, 90, 97, and 104, to assess the MNT GMTs to all 4 serotypes, 
and to assess the immune response induced in a population with no previous exposure to dengue.

Substantial increases in MNT GMTs against DENV-1 and DENV-2 were observed following the first dose, 
regardless of the number of injections (single or 2 simultaneous). To address the low response against 
DENV-4 seen in previous trials, the DENV-4 dose was increased. However, this increase did not result 
in higher MNT GMTs for this serotype and no dose effect could be observed. 
An additional dose at Month 3 with either HD TDV or HD2 TDV did not result in an increase of MNT 
GMTs for any of the serotypes, regardless of whether 1 or 2 injections were given at Month 0. Results 
from HD/10 TDV were similar to HD TDV  
The seroconversion rates at Month 4 (the primary endpoint visit) for DENV 1 (84.2%-100%), DENV 2 
(95.8%-100.0%), and DENV 3 (83.3%-100.0%) were high in all trial groups, while seroconversion for 
DENV 4 was lower (33.3%-76.5%). The seroconversion rates for DENV 1, DENV 2, and DENV 3 were 
also high at Month 1 for all trial groups. Even though MNT GMTs against DENV 1 and DENV 2 
decreased following the first dose, a high percentage of subjects maintained seropositivity prior to the 
second dose at Month 3. 
At Month 4, the seroconversion rates for DENV 4 were higher in the HD2 TDV groups (>70.0% 
compared with ≤60.0% in other groups) but was still not as high as for the other serotypes and no 
dose effect was observed. 
A 3-injection dose schedule with HD TDV did not have an effect on seroconversion rates compared with 
a 2-injection dose schedule. 
In conclusion, HD2 TDV did not result in a meaningful difference in the response against DENV-4 
compared with HD TDV. Results from this trial supported the use of HD TDV administered 3 months 
apart. 
A 10-fold reduction in overall viral content (ie, HD/10 TDV) resulted in improved immune responses 
against DENV-4, compared with HD TDV. The resulting hypothesis from these data was that the TDV-2 
in HD TDV was interfering with the replication of the other vaccine viruses and thus inhibiting the 
immune response to the remaining serotypes.  
Trial DEN-106 
This was a double-blind, randomised, 4-parallel groups, phase 2 trial conducted at multiple sites in the 
United States (a non-endemic region) to investigate the safety and immunogenicity of HD TDV in 
healthy adult subjects. The trial evaluated the equivalence of 3 formulations: liquid and lyophilized 
formulations, which was developed to meet World Health Organization (WHO) prequalification storage 
conditions, to the liquid formulation manufactured by Shantha Biotechnics. The Shantha liquid 
formulation was used in all phase 1 trials and in 1 other phase 2 trial, Trial DEN-203. All doses in Trial 
DEN-106 were given SC. 
A total of 996 healthy baseline seronegative male and female subjects, 18 to 49 years of age were 
randomised in a 2:1:1:6 ratio in four groups.   
The primary objective was to test the equivalence of the IDT lyophilized formulation to the Shantha 
liquid formulation at Month 1. The secondary objectives were to assess the immunogenicity of the IDT 
lyophilized formulation compared with 2 doses of the Shantha liquid formulation to all 4 serotypes at 
Month 4 and to compare the safety of these formulations. 
Results 
Equivalence in MNT GMTs was demonstrated between the IDT lyophilized formulation and the Shantha 
liquid formulation (combined groups) after the first dose for DENV-2 (CI, 0.90-1.26), but not for

DENV-1 (CI, 0.23-0.36), DENV-3 (CI, 1.13-1.89), or DENV-4 (CI, 0.57-0.95). The MNT GMTs for 
DENV-1 were approximately 71% lower for the IDT lyophilized formulation than for the Shantha liquid 
formulation (combined groups) at Month 1, MNT GMTs for DENV-2 were similar (only 6% higher), MNT 
GMTs for DENV-3 were 46% higher, and MNT GMTs for DENV-4 were 26% lower.  
For the secondary endpoint, MNT GMTs were equivalent between the IDT lyophilized formulation and 
the 2-dose Shantha liquid dose schedule for DENV-2 (CI, 0.70-1.15) after the first dose and for 
DENV-2 (CI, 0.75-1.09) and DENV-4 (CI, 0.70-1.18) after the second dose. The differences in the MNT 
GMTs between the formulations were less pronounced at Month 4 than at Month 1.  
Given that differences in MNT GMTs between formulations were not consistent for each of the 
serotypes, it is possible that the failure to demonstrate equivalence was not related to the 
lyophilization process. 
The seropositivity rates for DENV-1 was notably lower for the IDT lyophilized formulation compared 
with the Shantha liquid formulation (combined groups) after the first dose (p = 0.024. Seropositivity 
rates for DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 were similar between the formulations. Seropositivity rates 
were similar between the IDT lyophilized formulation and the 2-dose Shantha liquid schedule after both 
the first and the second dose.  
In conclusion, the immune response against DENV-2 was equivalent between the IDT lyophilized and 
the Shantha liquid formulations.  
Trial DEN-203 
This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, 2-part, multicentre, age-descending and 
expansion, phase 2 trial conducted in Puerto Rico, Colombia, Singapore, and Thailand (all endemic 
regions) to investigate safety and immunogenicity of HD TDV in adult and paediatric male and female 
subjects, 1.5 to 45 years of age. Both baseline seronegative and baseline seropositive subjects were 
enrolled. The trial evaluated 2 HD TDV doses, given SC and 3 months apart, in different age groups 
and was conducted in 2 parts. 
Adult and paediatric subjects in Part 1 were enrolled into 1 of 4 age cohorts and randomised in a 2:1 
ratio to receive HD TDV (90 subjects) or placebo (58 subjects) as follows: 
•  21 to 45 years cohort: HD TDV (N = 24) at Month 0 (Day 0) and at Month 3 (Day 90). 
•  12 to 20 years cohort: HD TDV (N = 22) at Month 0 (Day 0) and at Month 3 (Day 90). 
•  6 to 11 years cohort: HD TDV (N = 21) at Month 0 (Day 0) and at Month 3 (Day 90). 
•  1.5 to 5 years cohort: HD TDV (N = 23) at Month 0 (Day 0) and at Month 3 (Day 90). 
Part 2 comprised only 1 age cohort and subjects were randomised in a 3:1 ratio to receive HD TDV 
(159 subjects) or placebo (53 subjects): 
•  1.5 to 11 years cohort: HD TDV at Month 0 (Day 0) and at Month 3 (Day 90). 
The primary objectives were to assess the safety and tolerability of a 2-dose schedule of HD TDV 
administered SC, and to assess the immunogenicity to all 4 serotypes. The secondary objectives were 
to assess the viraemia due to the attenuated vaccine viruses measured on Days 0 (baseline), 7, 14, 
90, 97, and 104 in Part 1, to assess the safety and immunogenicity of HD TDV during long-term follow-

up (up to 36 months post-first dose), and to assess the immune response induced in a population with 
previous exposure to dengue. 
Results 
The number of subjects seropositive to at least 1 serotype at baseline increased with age (see Table 
7).  
Table 7: Trial DEN-203: Number (%) of Subjects Seronegative or Seropositive at Baseline 
(Full Analysis Set) 
MNT GMTs at each time point have been presented for all subjects (both baseline seropositive and 
baseline seronegative) Overall, the MNT GMTs for DENV-2 were the highest in the 21 to 45 years 
cohort. The lowest MNT GMTs were observed for DENV-4. The MNT GMTs for each of the 4 serotypes 
decreased over time. 
Seropositivity rates for DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-3 ranged from 95.5% to 100.0% at Month 4. 
Notably, these high seropositivity rates persisted up to 36 months after the first dose and was 
observed regardless of the presence of dengue antibodies at baseline.  
In conclusion, this trial showed that HD TDV induced a response in MNT GMTs and high seropositivity 
to all 4 serotypes, regardless of the presence of dengue antibodies at baseline. In addition, the trial 
demonstrated persistence of vaccine-induced titres throughout the 36-month trial duration. 
Trial DEN-205 
This was a double-blind, randomised, single dose, phase 2 trial conducted at multiple sites in 
Singapore (an endemic country) to investigate the safety and compare the immunogenicity of 
lyophilized TDV (named, TDV) with a 10-fold lower viral content of TDV-2 with that of HD TDV liquid 
formulation. Both baseline seronegative and baseline seropositive (to at least 1 dengue serotype) 
subjects were enrolled. 
A total of 351 male and female subjects 21 to 45 years of age were randomised in a 1:1 ratio in two 
groups.   
The primary objective was to assess the immunogenicity of the two vaccine formulations to all 
4 serotypes. The secondary objectives were to assess the safety of HD TDV and TDV by baseline

serostatus and to assess the viraemia derived from the attenuated vaccine viruses on Days 1, 5, 7, 9, 
11, 15, 17, 21, and 30.  
Results 
Subject recruitment was stopped after 351 subjects were randomised, before the target of 
400 subjects had been reached. The decision to stop the recruitment prematurely was due to difficulty 
in the recruitment of subjects who were seropositive at baseline (the required number of subjects 
seronegative at baseline had already been enrolled) which resulted in a risk of not meeting the target 
enrolment of 400 subjects before the expiry date of the vaccine. The decision to stop enrolment was 
considered to have limited impact on the evaluation of the trial objectives and scientific integrity of the 
trial because >85% of the planned subjects had been randomised. The percentage of subjects 
seropositive to at least 1 serotype at baseline was similar between the trial groups (52.6% in the HD 
TDV group and 54.6% in the TDV group). 
Table 8: Trial DEN-205: Number (%) of Subjects Seropositive at Baseline (Per-Protocol Set) 
Peak MNT GMTs were higher for DENV-1 and DENV-3 in the HD TDV group than in the TDV group). The 
decrease between Month 1 and Month 3 was smaller for the TDV than HD TDV. MNT GMTs in the 
HD TDV group were higher for DENV-2 and marginally lower for DENV-4 than in the TDV group at most 
visits. 
By baseline serotype, differences between HD TDV and the TDV were more pronounced in baseline 
seronegative subjects. These results suggest that a different balance of the immune response was 
achieved with the TDV compared with HD TDV. In subjects who were seronegative at baseline, the 
response against DENV-2 was less prominent with a lower incidence of DENV-2 viraemia in the TDV 
group than the HD TDV group, while DENV-4 seropositivity rates and MNT GMTs were higher in the 
TDV group.  
Seropositivity rates were similar between HD TDV and TDV for DENV-1 and DENV-3, higher in the 
HD TDV group for DENV-2 than the TDV group, and lower in the HD TDV group for DENV-4 than the 
TDV group.  
The seropositivity rates were higher in the HD TDV group than in the TDV group for DENV-2 and lower 
for DENV-4 in subjects seronegative at baseline. 
In conclusion, vaccine viraemia following HD TDV administration has most commonly been associated 
with TDV-2, suggesting a greater potential for TDV-2 to replicate, theoretically inhibiting replication of 
the other serotypes and interfering with the overall immune response. The results of the trial 
supported the selection of the TDV (viral content in the lyophilized TDV product with a 10-fold lower 
viral content of TDV-2) for future clinical development since they suggest that a different balance of 
the immune response was achieved with the TDV compared to HD-TDV. The results showed a less 
dominant response to DENV-2 (including lower incidence of TDV-2 viraemia) in the TDV group

compared to the HD TDV group. In addition, DENV-4 seropositivity rates and GMTs were improved in 
the TDV group. 
Trial DEN-204 
This was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, phase 2 trial conducted in The Dominican 
Republic, Panama, and The Philippines (all endemic regions), to investigate the safety and 
immunogenicity of different dose schedules of TDV, given SC. The trial compared three dose 
schedules: 2 doses given 3 months apart, a single dose followed by a booster at Month 12, and a 
single dose only. The trial aimed to support the use of the lyophilized TDV product and the final dose 
schedule, including long-term persistence of immunogenicity. All analyses presented were descriptive 
with no statistical comparisons. Both baseline seronegative and baseline seropositive (to at least 
1 dengue serotype) subjects were enrolled. 
Only the data contributing to the dose schedule selection (ie, through Month 18) are described in this 
summary document. The complete immunogenicity results from this trial (ie, through Month 48) are 
described (after discussion on pivotal trial DEN-310). 
A total of 1794 male and female subjects (1596 TDV and 198 placebo), 2 to 17 years of age were 
randomised in a 1:2:5:1 ratio into 4 groups. 
The primary objective was to assess the humoral immune responses to TDV administered SC on 
different dosing schedules. The secondary objectives were to assess the immunogenicity of TDV to all 4 
serotypes and to assess the safety of this formulation. 
Results 
The percentage of subjects seropositive to at least 1 serotype at baseline varied from 49.4% to 57.3% 
between the trial groups. Results from the 18-month interim analysis showed that TDV induced a 
response to all 4 serotypes regardless of serostatus at baseline and dosing schedule. 
In the overall population, no major differences were noted in MNT GMTs or seropositivity rates 
between subjects who received 1 or 2 doses of TDV. A second dose at Month 3 improved the immune 
responses in subjects without a serotype-specific response to the first dose (ie, increased the 
seropositivity rate). A dose at Month 12 led to higher GMTs to all serotypes than when the second dose 
was given at Month 3. Seropositivity rates were similar whether the second dose of TDV was 
administered at Month 3 or Month 12, and this was observed regardless of serostatus at baseline.  
Therefore, the dose schedule which results in the highest percent of tetravalent seropositivity 
regardless of serostatus at baseline, was selected for further development. 
In conclusion, the decision on dose schedule to be used in the pivotal Trial DEN-301 was made based 
on 6-month data, however, the 18-month data ultimately validated this decision. Even though the 
second dose given at 12 months after the first dose resulted in higher GMTs compared to the second 
dose given at 3 months, the seropositivity rates were comparable and validated the decision on 
optimal dosing schedule, as tetravalent seropositivity is achieved in a higher proportion of subjects 
more rapidly after the 0, 3 months schedule. 
Exploratory Immunogenicity Characterization 
The applicant has characterized the immune responses elicited by TDV in a broad way in order to 
analyse the range of immune responses encompassing multiple arms of the immune system that may 
contribute to prevention and clearance of viral infections, in addition to serum neutralizing antibodies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 63/254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For that aim, exploratory immunology testing of samples from Good Clinical Practice-compliant clinical 
trials was performed in non- Good Practice (GxP) laboratories to broadly characterize immune 
responses elicited by TDV in seronegative children and adults, and in seropositive children.  
Most of the serum samples tested in the post-hoc exploratory immunology assays were collected from 
subjects who were included in the immune subsets (randomly selected at enrolment) for Trials DEN-
203, DEN-204, DEN-205, and DEN-301. For Trial DEN-304, the samples tested were collected from the 
group including subjects who received TDV Lot 3). Cellular immunology analyses were also conducted 
on samples from Trials DEN-204, DEN-205 and DEN-313 as part of the primary or secondary trial 
objectives as specified in the respective trial protocols and clinical study reports (CSRs).

All the trials in which exploratory immunogenicity was assessed have been described above except 
study DEN-313, which is described below: 
Trial DEN-313 
Trial DEN-313 was an open-label, single-arm, phase 2 trial, designed to evaluate the cell mediated 
immunity after vaccination with TDV in healthy children and adolescents aged 4 to 16 years from 
Panama and The Philippines (endemic regions). All subjects were vaccinated with TDV administered at 
Month 0 and Month 3, and were to be followed up for immunogenicity and safety assessments for 3 
years after the second TDV dose. Both baseline seropositive and seronegative subjects were enrolled, 
and subjects were screened prior to enrolment to ensure that each site enrolled at least 40% of 
subjects with each serostatus. 
The aim of this study was to assess the cellular immune responses to 2 doses of TDV at 1 month post 
second vaccine dose. Additionally, further characterization of the immune response was carried out 
including to assess the cellular immune responses up to 3 years post second vaccination, overall and 
by region and baseline serostatus, to characterize the phenotype of cellular immune responses to TDV 
by intracellular cytokine staining and to assess the post-vaccination neutralizing antibody response 
against each dengue serotype and against multiple dengue serotypes. These objectives were assessed 
by measuring the frequency and the magnitude of IFN-γ ELISPOT responses to TDV, by phenotype 
characterization of cellular immune responses to TDV by intracellular cytokine staining and by 
evaluating GMTs of neutralizing antibodies (by MNT50) and seropositivity rates. 
Cellular immunogenicity data from the DEN-313 study confirm that TDV elicits a potent cross-reactive 
T cell response against all 4 dengue serotypes that is maintained through Month 9, irrespective of the 
subject’s baseline dengue serostatus (as investigated using the IFN γ ELISpot assay). A multifunctional 
CD8+ and CD4+ T cell response against the NS targets of DENV-2 was observed at Month 4 (as 
investigated using the ICS assay). GMTs of neutralizing antibodies against dengue and dengue 
seropositivity rates (tetravalent responses after the second dose of 99.5% at Month 4 and 93.0% at 
Month 9) showed good maintenance of dengue neutralizing antibody titres for all serotypes through 
Month 9, irrespective of the baseline dengue serostatus. 
It follows a brief description of the exploratory immunogenicity characterization and their results: 
Early immune response 
To study the molecular events that trigger NAb responses following TDV vaccination, a comprehensive 
analysis was conducted to examine differential expression of coding and noncoding genes and isoform 
expression changes. Samples were selected from Trial DEN-102 subjects who developed low and high 
titre NAbs and the results were then compared. 
The results showed that the early events that occur after vaccination with TDV, that lead to potent 
Nabs, include type I IFN signalling and expansion of immune cells; these events are similar to those 
triggered by YFV 17D vaccination and DENV infection. The early events leading to effective CD8+ TCRs 
elicited by TDV vaccination have also been investigated. 
Humoral Immune Responses to DENV Structural Proteins 
Several humoral immune response parameters elicited by TDV that might contribute to preventing 
DENV infection were characterized, including: NAbs, (type-specific [TS] and cross-reactive [CR]), 
neutralization of diverse DENV genotypes, binding antibodies, complement-fixing antibodies and 
polyclonal antibody avidity. 
NAbs are generally regarded as the most relevant marker for protective immunity against DENV. DENV 
NAbs are most measured using the plaque reduction neutralization test. DENV NAbs can be type-

specific (TS) ie, neutralize a single serotype only, or cross-reactive (CR) ie, neutralize more than one 
DENV serotype. Amino acid homology of the envelope (E) protein, the major surface protein, ranges 
from 66% to 78% among DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. Determination and quantitation of 
TS NAbs is complicated by the serological relationship among the 4 DENV serotypes. 
• 
TS and CR Nabs 
Samples from 3 clinical trials (DEN-203, DEN-204, and DEN-301) were selected for characterization of 
NAb specificity following vaccination with TDV.  The results showed that in exploratory, non-GxP 
analyses of baseline seronegative vaccinated subjects, TDV elicits tetravalent NAbs that are a 
combination of TS and CR for DENV-1 and DENV-4, and primarily CR for DENV-3. In baseline 
seropositive vaccinated subjects, results were variable and likely influenced by prior DENV exposure. 
Further studies are required to characterize DENV-2 TS NAbs in more detail, but the available results 
suggest that vaccination can elicit DENV-2 TS NAbs in the majority of subjects. Specificity of DENV 
NAbs is complex and available methods have significant technical limitations. The relationship between 
TS or CR NAbs and the outcome of infection has not been established. 
• 
TS and CR MBCs 
The results demonstrate TS MBC responses against all 4 DENV serotypes after tetravalent TDV 
vaccination in both baseline seronegative and baseline seropositive individuals. Therefore, the pattern 
of MBC specificity after tetravalent TDV vaccination is different from the pattern after primary or 
secondary DENV infection. DENV infection only activates TS MBCs to 1 serotype at a time (eg, during 
each sequential infection). These results demonstrate that all 4 components of TDV contribute to the 
DENV-specific MBC response. The repertoire of tetravalent DENV TS and CR MBCs generated by 
vaccination represent a pool of MBCs primed to produce anamnestic antibody responses upon 
subsequent DENV exposure. 
• 
Neutralization of Diverse Genotypes 
DENV strains are categorized into genotypes within each serotype. Despite the complex serological 
relationships among DENV strains, genotype can be employed as an indicator of the antigenic 
differences among strains within a serotype.  
For the neutralization of diverse genotypes studies, sera from Trial DEN-205 were selected. A limitation 
of the data is the small number of samples that were tested against a small panel of DENV strains. 
Overall, exploratory, non-GxP analyses demonstrate that TDV can elicit NAbs capable of neutralizing 
diverse DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 strains across multiple genotypes. 
• 
Binding Antibodies 
Exploratory, non-GxP analyses demonstrate that TDV elicits DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 
virion-binding antibodies that persist for at least 450 days post-vaccination. The relationship between 
titres in the DENV Total Binding IgG ELISA and the iELISA or the relationship between specific levels of 
virion-binding antibodies and the outcome of infection have not been established. 
• 
Complement-Fixing Antibodies 
Non-GxP analyses demonstrate that TDV elicits complement-fixing antibodies to DENV-1, DENV-2, 
DENV-3, and DENV-4 that persist for at least 360 days post-vaccination in baseline seronegative and 
seropositive subjects. The correlation observed between DENV total binding IgG and complement-
fixing antibodies suggests that the DENV total binding IgG produced in response to TDV vaccination 
includes antibodies with functional complement-fixing activity.

• 
Antibody Affinity Maturation and High Avidity Antibodies 
The results demonstrate that TDV can elicit DENV-specific antibody affinity maturation, with high 
affinity antibodies generated to all 4 DENV serotypes that persist through 450 days post-vaccination. 
Immune Responses to Nonstructural Proteins 
• 
Anti-Nonstructural Protein 1 IgG Antibodies 
In vitro and in vivo studies have demonstrated that antibodies to NS1 can block the pathogenic 
mechanism of DENV NS1. Although the relationship between NS1-specific IgG elicited by vaccination 
and the outcome of DENV infection is not known, results of exploratory non-GxP studies demonstrate 
that TDV can elicit an IgG response in baseline seronegative subjects and boosts responses in baseline 
seropositive subjects to DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4 NS1 that persist through Day 450 
post-vaccination.  
Cell-Mediated Immunity  
Trials that used earlier TDV formulations and only included flavivirus-naïve adults have shown that like 
natural DENV infection, TDV elicits broad IFN-ɣ ELISpot responses in adults against TDV components, 
including the structural proteins of DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4, the DENV-2, in addition to CR responses 
against the non-structural proteins of DENV-1, -3, and -4, as measured by IFN-γ ELISpot using DENV 
peptide pools. To study CMI with the final TDV formulation, samples have been collected from 
participants in studies DEN-205, DEN-204 and DEN-313.  
These CMI analyses represent an extensive dataset clearly showing that TDV elicits cellular immune 
responses in adults, adolescents and children. IFN-ɣ ELISpot assays with peptide pools spanning the 
DENV proteome demonstrate that cellular immune responses were elicited to all of the TDV 
components, this included responses to the structural proteins of DENV-1, -2, -3, and -4, responses to 
the non-structural proteins of DENV-2, and CR responses against the non-structural proteins of DENV-
1, -3, and -4. NS1, NS3, NS5 and prM/E were the most frequently recognized proteins. The magnitude 
of responses to DENV-2 was higher than to the other 3 serotypes. ICS identified a higher magnitude of 
CD8+ T cells compared to CD4+ T cells in addition to multi-functional CD4+ and CD8+ responses, with 
IFN-γ+/TNF-α+ or IFN-γ+ CD8+ cells being the most frequent phenotype. Similar responses were 
seen in all CMI assessments in baseline seropositive and seronegative subjects. 
Other immunogenicity data 
Results from humoral immunogenicity from pivotal trial DEN-301 are detailed at the end of the 
following section. Similarly, comparison of humoral immunogenicity results from studies that used the 
final formulation, the analysis of humoral immune response in endemic and non-endemic areas as well 
as in dengue seronegative subjects is described following discussion of pivotal trial DEN-301. 
Mechanism of action 
The primary mechanism of action of TDV is to replicate locally and elicit neutralizing antibodies to 
confer protection against dengue disease caused by any of the 4 dengue virus serotypes. TDV activates 
multiple arms of the immune system, including binding antibodies, complement fixing antibodies, 
functional antibodies to dengue non-structural protein 1 (NS1), and cell mediated immune responses 
(CD4+, CD8+, and natural killer cells).

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Analytical tests 
A comprehensive collection of assays has been used for the analysis of the endpoints throughout the 
clinical development plan of TDV. Overall, the assays performed by the applicant are suitable for their 
purpose and the scientific rationale for their selection is endorsed. 
The assays involved in the analysis of the primary and secondary endpoints of the phase 2 and 3 
clinical studies have all been qualified or validated. Validated assays include the dengue MNT, the 
dengue detection RT-PCR, the vaccine screening RT-PCR, the vaccine confirmation sequencing, the 
TDV sequencing, the IgG, IgM and NS1 ELISAs, the Yellow Fever PRNT and the anti-hepatitis A ELISA. 
It is noted that the Vaccine Screening RT-PCR is designed to detect and quantify the RNA of TDV 
strains, a characteristic that is utilized for both TDV efficacy evaluations within 30 days after 
vaccination and determination of TDV viraemia following vaccination. The only qualified assay used for 
the analysis of primary or secondary endpoints was the ELISPOT assay used to characterize cellular-
mediated immunity. For the validated or qualified assays, the corresponding validation/qualification 
reports have been submitted. 
The two most important tests for the primary endpoints of the phase 3 pivotal study DEN-301 are the 
MNT test and the dengue detection RT-PCR, used for case confirmation by detecting the presence of 
wild type dengue RNA from serum samples of subjects suffering from febrile illness. Both these tests 
are well described and validated. Nonetheless, in relation to these two assays, there was no 
information on the handling and storage of the samples to ensure its integrity until final testing. Details 
on these procedures were requested and have been provided, showing that there were precise 
instructions to ensure the integrity of the samples until final testing. 
The applicant has developed the MNT assay with reference to the WHO guidance specific to PRNT for 
dengue. Compared to the PRNT50, the MNT allows a higher throughput and better performance than 
the classical PRNT50. The Takeda MNT assay used during the entire clinical development of TDV is in 
line with the WHO Dengue PRNT testing guidance, although it was not validated against the PRNT, as 
was indicated in the WHO guidance. The applicant states that this is because the WHO Dengue PRNT 
guideline allows for many different assay variations, and assay methodologies and critical reagents 
have not been standardized between laboratories. Additionally, a well characterized reference sample 
panel resulting from either natural dengue infection or generated serum samples is not available. Since 
many variables such as reagents, virus and cell line that have been shown to have an impact on the 
assay and have not been standardized and harmonized between laboratories, the applicant has not 
considered meaningful an experimental comparison between a large format PRNT and the Takeda MNT 
assay. This approach for using the MNT was already accepted in the final Scientific advice letter sent 
by CHMP and therefore the assay validation provided is considered sufficient.  
Several assay-specific questions were raised for the PRNT50 but have been resolved after the 
Applicant’s answers. In addition to validated and qualified assays, exploratory immunity testing was 
performed with assays in the research status. These assays were used for the analysis of the 
exploratory endpoints of phase 2 and 3 studies in the clinical development of TDV. These assays are 
ICS, dengue 2 depletion and reported virus particle assay, dengue total binding IgG assay, dengue IgG 
avidity assay, anti-dengue NS1 IgG assay, dengue MNT assay for breadth of neutralization, and anti-
dengue complement antibody assay. It is considered that the exploratory nature of these trials did not 
require using validated assays.

Selection of TDV formulation and dosing schedule 
Overall, the total number of subjects that were enrolled in the phase 1 trials was 1371 participants for 
studies DEN-101, DEN-102, DEN-103, DEN-104 and DEN-106. Phase 2 studies enrolled 2485 subjects 
in trials DEN-203, DEN-204 and DEN-205. All the phase 1 studies were carried out in non-endemic 
settings and the phase 2 studies were done in endemic countries and therefore included both 
seropositive and seronegative participants. All these trials were carried out to determine the final 
formulation, number of doses, schedule and route of administration. All phase 1 studies enrolled adult 
subjects, and children (aged 1.5 years and above) were included in the phase 2 studies. All trials, 
except DEN-203, DEN-204 and DEN-205 were carried out in non-endemic areas.  
The first trials DEN-101 and DEN-102 explored two formulations [LD (low dose) and HD (high dose)] 
using with two different administration routes (SC and ID) in a 2-dose schedule with 3 months 
separation. Regarding the route of administration, the results from these initial trials showed that the 
intradermal administration presented a higher reactogenicity in studies DEN-101 and DEN-102, and 
thus the subcutaneous route was selected for future trials. This selection is sensible. The results from 
these two trials showed that TDV was immunogenic, although neutralizing antibody GMTs induced were 
not equally high for all serotypes. Based on these immunogenicity results, the applicant continued the 
clinical program with this vaccine aimed to determine in additional trials the formulation and schedule 
that yielded a balanced strong response against the four dengue virus serotypes.  
In order to achieve the highest and more balanced immune response, several options were assayed in 
additional phase 1 trials: vaccines containing high and low doses of the 4 viral components (Trial DEN-
103), formulations with different ratios of the four dengue virus (trial DEN-104), lyophilized and the 
liquid formulation (DEN-106) and also the administration of two simultaneous doses in separate arms 
(Trial DEN-103, DEN-104). It was also hypothesized that administering 2 doses at the same visit would 
increase compliance by reducing the number of visits required. However, this did not result in an 
improved response. These trials fixed the lyophilized formulation for future development.  The 
selection of the optimal formulation was complex, since it appeared that TDV-2 had a higher replication 
rate than the others and specially interfered with TDV-4 replication. These data were used in the 
design of trials DEN-203, DEN-204 and DEN-205, which were carried out in endemic areas and 
therefore included both dengue seropositive and seronegative subjects. 
Trial DEN-203 was the first study to include children 1.5 years of age and older and seropositive adult 
subjects, and was carried out in endemic regions (Puerto Rico, Colombia, Singapore, and Thailand). 
The trial evaluated 2 HD TDV doses, given SC and 3 months apart. This trial provided support for a 2-
dose schedule with 3 months interval between doses. This schedule was further supported from data 
from trials DEN-204 and DEN-205.  
The final formulation for the TDV was decided in trial DEN-205, in which the immunogenicity of HD 
TDV formulation and a TDV with 10-fold lower content of the TDV-2 component (named TDV) was 
compared. This study was carried out in Singapore (endemic region). The results showed that 
participants in the TDV group (10-fold lower content of the TDV-2) presented higher MNT GMTs and 
seroconversion rates against DENV-4 than those in the HD TDV group. Therefore, the applicant 
selected the TDV (viral content with a 10-fold reduction of TDV-2) for future clinical development and 
this decision is supported. 
The final schedule for further phase 3 development was based on data from trial DEN-204 in which 
three schedules were compared: 2 doses with 3 months interval; 2 doses given as primary vaccination 
and a booster at 12 months; and a single dose. The study was conducted in endemic regions (The 
Dominican Republic, Panama, and The Philippines). The criterion used to decide the final schedule was 
seroconversion rates rather than MTN GMTs, since seropositivity is likely to be a prerequisite for 
protection.  In the absence of a correlate of protection, this approach is supported. Results from an 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

interim analysis performed at month 6 showed that a second dose at month 3 enhanced 
immunogenicity against DENV-3 and to a lesser extent against DENV4 in subjects who were 
seronegative at baseline. Because a 0–3-month schedule ensured a more rapid vaccine response and 
higher tetravalent seropositivity response in baseline seronegative subjects compared to the 0-12 
months schedule, the applicant chose the two doses vaccination 3 months apart for the Phase 3 
studies. The applicant’s decision is endorsed. 
The results of trial DEN-205 supported the selection of the TDV (viral content in the lyophilized TDV 
product with a 10-fold lower viral content of TDV-2) for future clinical development since this 
formulation results in a more balanced immune response with the TDV compared to HD-TDV. The 
results showed a less dominant response to DENV-2 (including lower incidence of TDV-2 viraemia) in 
the TDV group compared to the HD TDV group. 
In conclusion, the results of the phase 1 and 2 studies led to the selection for the Phase 3 trials of a 
lyophilized TDV formulation in which the Dengue virus 2 component is reduced 10-fold as compared to 
the initial HD-TDV formulation. The vaccine should be administered subcutaneously, with a 2-dose 
schedule given three months apart. The final formulation of TDV at release is ≥ 3.3; ≥ 2.7; ≥ 4.0; ≥ 
4.5 log10 PFU/dose for TDV-1, TDV-2, TDV-3, and TDV-4, respectively. 
Overall, the rationale that supports the formulation, number of doses, schedule and route of 
administration to be used for phase 3 development, is supported. No safety concerns were raised.  
Exploratory Immunogenicity Characterization 
The immune response to dengue infection is complex and involves both the humoral and cellular arms 
of the immune system; however, the exact mechanisms that underlie protective immunity are not yet 
fully understood. TDV was specifically designed to activate multiple arms of the immune response; 
therefore, the applicant has carried out a very comprehensive collection of immunologic assays to 
characterize the immune response elicited by TDV. This exploratory immunogenicity characterization 
was done by testing of samples from Good Clinical Practice-compliant clinical trials but performed in 
non-Good Practice (GxP) laboratories. This approach is considered acceptable considering the 
exploratory nature of the assays. The samples have been obtained from subjects who were included in 
the immune subsets for Trials DEN-203, DEN-204, DEN-205, DEN-301, DEN-304 and DEN-313.  
The exploratory immunogenicity characterization includes the following analysis: Type-specific (TS) 
and cross-reactive (CR) neutralizing antibodies, TS and CR MBCs, neutralization of diverse genotypes, 
binding antibodies, complement-fixing antibodies, antibody affinity maturation and high avidity 
antibodies, anti-NS1 IgG antibodies and cell-mediated immunity. 
There were some issues that needed to be solved in relation to the functional role of the complement 
binding antibodies in disease mitigation (trial DEN-204); the ADE-inducing potential of cross-reactive 
and binding antibodies; and the role of CD8+ and CD4+ T cell responses in disease mitigation. These 
issues have been appropriately addressed by the Applicant. 
Taken together, the results obtained showed that TDV induces a diverse antibody response that 
includes both type-specific and cross-reactive between DENV serotypes, binding antibodies, and 
complement fixing antibodies to all 4 DENV serotypes in addition to DENV-2 NS1-specific antibodies 
that are cross-reactive with NS1 from DENV-1, -3, and -4. Cellular immunity was elicited to all the 
structural and non-structural proteins of the four DENV serotypes. The magnitude of the response was 
higher for CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cells, being IFN-γ+/TNF-α+ or IFN-γ+ CD8+ cells the most 
frequent phenotype. These results agree with evidence from the literature that suggests that each of 
the studied components of the immune response can contribute to protection against dengue infection.

Nonetheless, there were some issues, specifically regarding cellular immunogenicity (study DEN-313) 
that were requested to be addressed by the applicant. The applicant has now provided valuable 
additional information and explanations for the specific points that were raised regarding the 
evaluation of the vaccine induced cellular immune response.  
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In total, eight Phase I and II trials tested different formulations, administration routes and schedules of 
the Takeda dengue vaccine. From these trials, a lyophilized TDV formulation (in which the Dengue 
virus 2 component is reduced 10-fold as compared to the initial formulation) to be administered 
subcutaneously, with a 2-dose schedule given three months apart was selected for the pivotal efficacy 
trial DEN-301. 
An extensive analysis on the humoral and cellular immune response induced by the vaccine has been 
made. It has been shown that TDV induces: i) a diverse antibody response that is both type-specific 
and cross-reactive between DENV serotypes, binding antibodies, and complement fixing antibodies to 
all 4 DENV serotypes; ii) a cellular immunity to all the structural and non-structural proteins of the four 
DENV serotypes. The magnitude of the response was higher for CD8+ compared to CD4+ T cells, being 
IFN-γ+/TNF-α+ or IFN-γ+ CD8+ cells the most frequent phenotype.

2.6.5.2.  Main studies 
Study DEN-301: Phase III, Double-Blind, Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Trial to 
Investigate the Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of a Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine (TDV) 
Administered Subcutaneously in Healthy Children Aged 4–16 Years Old. 
Trial Design 
Pivotal Trial DEN-301 is a phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial with 5 trial parts 
(Parts 1-5) for surveillance of febrile illness with potential dengue etiology in subjects aged 4 to 
16 years living in endemic regions.  
The age range of 4 to 16 years of age at trial entry was chosen based on the epidemiology of dengue 
in the endemic Asia Pacific and Latin American countries included in the trial and to have sufficient 
subjects who were seronegative at baseline to allow an analysis of vaccine efficacy (VE) by serostatus. 
Symptomatic dengue is most common during a second infection, less common during a primary 
infection, and unusual during a third or fourth infection. An efficacy assessment based on the detection 
of symptomatic dengue is therefore best performed in age groups for which a secondary infection is 
likely. An age range of 4 to 16 years is an age range for which febrile surveillance and long-term 
follow-up is more successful.  
The trial is conducted in 3 countries of the Asia Pacific region (The Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand) 
and in 5 countries of Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, The Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and 
Panama). Eligible subjects aged 4 to 16 years were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either TDV or

placebo (normal saline for injection) by a subcutaneous (SC) injection into the upper arm (planned 
number of subjects: 13,400 TDV; 6700 placebo).  
The trial comprises 5 consecutive trial parts (see next Figure): Part 1 was the primary analysis period, 
a 15-month period lasting until 12 months post second dose and included the primary efficacy 
analysis. This part started on the day of vaccination and ended once both of the following 2 criteria had 
been fulfilled: i) 120 cases of confirmed dengue fever; ii) minimum duration of subject follow-up of 12 
months post-second vaccination. The end of Part 1 was defined for each subject so that the duration of 
follow-up after the second vaccination was approximately the same for all subjects. Virologically 
confirmed cases in Part 1 counted towards the primary efficacy objective if they occurred at least 30 
days post-second vaccination. Part 2 was a 6-month period lasting until 18 months post second dose, 
at the end of which the secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed. In fact, virologically confirmed 
cases in Parts 1 and 2 contributed towards the secondary efficacy objectives; Part 3 is a 2.5- to 3-year 
period for the assessment of long-term efficacy and safety; and Parts 4 and 5 comprise the booster 
phase of at least 25 months for the assessment of the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety following 
an additional placebo or TDV booster dose administered 48 to 54 months (4-4.5 years) after the 
second vaccine dose. 
Figure 5: Trial DEN-301: Trial Schematic 
Subjects could have been enrolled into a dry-run to commence and test the febrile surveillance 
methodology. This dry-run involved pre-vaccination surveillance for dengue and was conducted for up 
to 10 months prior to vaccination on Day 1. The need for and duration of the dry-run at an individual 
site depended on the experience of the site in conducting similar trials.  
At baseline, blood samples were taken from all subjects to determine the dengue serostatus. During 
Parts 1 and 2 (as well as the dry-run), active surveillance was applied (see Table 10). Any subject with 
febrile illness (defined as fever ≥38°C on any 2 of 3 consecutive days) was asked to return to the site 
for dengue fever evaluation by the investigator. Subjects/guardians were contacted at least weekly to

ensure robust identification of febrile illness and to remind them of their obligation to return to the site 
in the event of febrile illness. 
During Part 3 and the booster phase (Parts 4 and 5), modified active surveillance is applied to detect 
dengue cases of any severity in a tiered approach based on the need for hospitalization (see Table 10). 
The active surveillance was modified for Parts 3 to 5 to enable detection of symptomatic dengue while 
minimizing the burden on subjects and their guardians to maintain compliance and subject retention 
during this long period of follow-up. Any subject with febrile illness is asked to return to the site for 
evaluation by the investigator. Subjects presenting with febrile illness not requiring hospitalization are 
to be screened for dengue disease (by RT-PCR) unless there is an alternative laboratory confirmed 
etiology (note: only occasionally an acute sample for RT-PCR was not taken because of an alternative 
laboratory confirmed diagnosis). Subjects with febrile illness requiring hospitalization are evaluated as 
during active surveillance. During modified active surveillance, subjects/guardians are contacted at 
least weekly. Thus, consistency with the active surveillance in Parts 1 and 2 is maintained in terms of 
frequency of contact and the definition of febrile illness. The principal difference between the 
surveillance methods is that clinical chemistry (alanine aminotransferase and aspartate 
aminotransferase), hematology (hematocrit and platelets), and dengue serology (IgG, IgM, and NS1) 
in acute or convalescent samples are not mandated by the protocol during Parts 3 to 5 unless the 
subject requires hospitalization. Any relevant clinical data, however, were to be collected where testing 
was performed as part of clinical care regardless of hospitalization. 
Table 10: Trial DEN-301: Differences Between Active Surveillance (Dry-Run, Parts 1 and 2) 
and Modified Active Surveillance (Parts 3-5) 
The trial protocol, which initially included Parts 1 to 3 only, has been amended to introduce a booster 
phase comprising Parts 4 and 5, to assess the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety following an 
additional placebo or TDV booster dose administered 48 to 54 months (4-4.5 years) after the second 
vaccine dose. Only subjects who were 4 to 11 years of age at the time of randomization in the trial 
(Month 0) are eligible to participate in the booster phase. 
Parts 1, 2and 3 have been completed; the remainder of the trial (parts 4 and 5) is still ongoing. In this 
MAA, the unblinded data from Part 1, Part 2, and until 12 months after the end of Part 1 were initially

Efficacy Measurements: Handling of Febrile Illness Cases (Suspected Dengue Cases)  
Subjects presenting with febrile illness (defined as temperature ≥38°C on any 2 of 3 consecutive days) 
or clinically suspected dengue during the dry-run, Parts 1 and 2 or requiring hospitalization during 
Parts 3, 4, or 5 had/will have 2 blood samples taken to confirm dengue infection. These were/will be in 
addition to those taken as part of the clinical care of the subject. 
The main trial assessment/measurement of febrile illness was defined as fever ≥38°C on any 2 of 3 
consecutive days was chosen rather than “2 consecutive days” to increase the likelihood of capturing 
more dengue cases. This approach was considered to be the most appropriate to maximize the 
likelihood of capturing all dengue cases. All dengue cases were confirmed by dengue detection RT-PCR 
and severity was assessed by the Dengue Case Adjudication Committee (DCAC). All other 
measurements were made according to standard methods. Each local laboratory provided their 
reference ranges to the Sponsor and centralized laboratory analyses were performed in validated 
laboratories designated by the Sponsor.  
The first or acute blood sample was taken during the acute phase of the disease (ie, as soon as 
possible and preferably within 5 days after the onset of fever). Testing included dengue IgM and IgG 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), dengue NS1 antigen ELISA, dengue detection RT-PCR, 
haematocrit, platelet count, and liver function tests (LFTs [aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT)]). 
The second or convalescent blood sample was taken during the convalescent phase of the disease (ie, 
between 7 and 14 days after the acute sample) and tested for dengue IgM/IgG ELISA, haematocrit, 
platelet count, and LFTs. 
Local standards of care may have required additional tests, based on clinical presentation and at 
medical discretion. Additional dengue neutralizing antibody and other laboratory tests could have been 
performed. In addition to blood tests, clinical evaluation was performed for signs of haemorrhage or 
plasma leakage as well as any other abnormal signs or symptoms. 
In addition, during Parts 3, 4, and 5, subjects presenting with febrile illness (defined as temperature ≥
38°C on any 2 of 3 consecutive days) or clinically suspected dengue and not requiring hospitalization 
had/will have a blood sample taken for dengue infection confirmation by dengue detection RT-PCR 
unless there was an alternate laboratory-confirmed aetiology. The blood sample was/will be taken 
Assessment report

during the acute phase of the disease (ie, as soon as possible and preferably within 5 days after the 
onset of fever). Febrile illness cases within 30 days after vaccination were investigated for the 
presence of wild-type or vaccine-derived dengue virus. Clinical evaluation was/will be performed for 
signs of haemorrhage or plasma leakage as well as any other abnormal signs or symptoms. Local 
standards of care could have required additional tests, based on clinical presentation and at medical 
discretion. Approximate blood volumes and analyses for febrile surveillance are presented in Table 11. 
A febrile illness as described above required/will require an interval of at least 14 days from a previous 
febrile illness to avoid overlap of acute and convalescent visits from 1 episode with those from a second 
episode. 
Table 11: Blood Volumes and Analyses for Febrile Surveillance    
Severity of VCD Fever Assessed by Independent DCAC  
The criteria used for the assessment of VCD fever severity by the independent DCAC, which assessed 
all hospitalized VCD cases based on criteria pre-defined in a charter are summarized below: 
i. Bleeding abnormality 
• For a case to be considered severe there must have been a significant intervention needed in 
response to the bleeding episode, such as: - Blood transfusion, - Nasal packing, or - Hormonal 
therapy. 
or, 
• Bleeding occurred into critical organs such as the brain. 
ii. Plasma leakage 
• For a case to be considered severe there must have been evidence of both plasma leakage AND 
functional impairment. 
- Plasma leakage includes clinical evidence, radiological evidence, or haematocrit elevated >20% 
above normal levels or baseline. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 80/254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- Functional impairment is defined as: ▪ Shock; ▪ Respiratory distress.;  
Liver 
• For a case to be considered severe, there must have been evidence of both hepatitis and functional 
impairment. 
- Hepatitis was defined as AST or ALT >10 × the upper limit of normal. 
- Functional impairment was defined as prothrombin time >1.5 × the upper limit of normal or 
hypalbuminaemia. 
iv. Renal 
• Serum creatinine >2.5 × the upper limit of normal. 
or, 
• Requiring dialysis. 
v. Cardiac 
• Abnormalities intrinsic to the heart (ie, not resulting from intravascular volume depletion) and with 
evidence of functional impairment. 
- Examples of intrinsic abnormality: myocarditis, pericarditis, myoepicarditis. 
- Example of functional impairment: new conduction abnormality resulting in irregular heart rhythm 
(ie, not transient first degree heart block). 
vi. Central nervous system 
• Any abnormality with the exception of a simple febrile convulsion or brief delirium. 
vii. Shock 
• All shock cases were considered severe. 
All non-hospitalized VCD cases were considered “non-severe” for the corresponding endpoint (ie, VE 
of 2 doses of TDV in preventing severe VCD dengue). 
Severity of VCD fever assessed according to the WHO criteria (1997) for dengue haemorrhagic fever 
(DHF) 
According to the WHO criteria (1997) for DHF, VCD fever severity was analysed programmatically 
without applying medical judgment. 
According to the WHO, typical cases of DHF are characterized by four major clinical manifestations: 
high fever, haemorrhagic phenomena, and often, hepatomegaly and circulatory failure. 
Immunogenicity Measurements 
Blood samples for serological immunogenicity testing were collected from all subjects in Part 1 at pre-
vaccination on Day 1 (M0) and on Day 120 (post-second vaccination [M4]) and will be collected from 
all subjects in the booster phase at pre -booster vaccination on Day 1b (M0b) and post-booster 
vaccination on Day 30b (M1b). 
Additional samples were collected from the subset in Part 1, 2, and 3 post-first vaccination on Day 30 
(M1), pre-vaccination on Day 90 (M3), post-second vaccination on Day 270 (M9) and Day 450 (M15), 
and then every 12 months until the end of Part 3 and will be collected from the booster

immunogenicity subset post-booster vaccination on Day 180b (M6b), Day 395b (M13b), and Day 760b 
(M25b). 
Blood samples taken at pre-vaccination on Day 1 (M0) of all subjects were analysed for dengue 
serostatus at baseline. Samples taken at Day 120 (M4) for subjects not in the subset were stored for 
future analysis.  
For immunogenicity endpoints including seropositivity (SP) rate and geometric mean titres (GMTs) for 
dengue neutralizing antibodies (and geometric mean ratios [GMRs] for the booster phase), descriptive 
statistics and 95% CIs are provided. 
• 
Sample size  
This was a partially case-driven trial. 
Assuming true VE of 60% and a randomization ratio of 2:1 (TDV: placebo) a total of 120 cases of VCD 
fever induced by any dengue serotype occurring from 30 days post-second vaccination (Day 120 [M4]) 
until the end of Part 1 would provide at least 90% power to rule out a vaccine effect of ≤25% (with a 
2-sided significance level of 0.05). 
Assuming a background incidence rate of 1.0% by the end of Part 1 (minimum 12 months after the 
second vaccination for each subject), randomization of 20,100 subjects in a 2:1 ratio with follow-up for 
a minimum of 12 months would allow the accrual of at least 120 dengue fever cases. Exclusion of 
subjects from the PPS was compensated for by a potentially longer duration of Part 1. 
For the booster phase, no formal sample size calculations were performed.  
• 
Randomisation  
The Investigator or designee accessed the IWRS at subject enrolment to obtain the subject number, 
which was used throughout the trial, and to randomize the subject into the trial on the first day of 
dosing (Day 1 [M0]). Subjects assigned to participate in the booster phase of the trial will receive a 
single dose of TDV or placebo, depending on the assignment at the randomization performed on Day 1 
(M0) by IWRS/IVRS.  
The Investigator or designee accessed the IWRS at each dispensing visit to obtain the Vaccination 
Identification number for the vaccine dose. The vaccines were prepared and administered by the 
unblinded pharmacist or unblinded administrator according to the instructions in the Pharmacy Manual 
or per manufacturer´s instructions. 
The Investigator or designee was responsible for overseeing the administration of vaccine to subjects 
randomised in the trial according to the procedures stipulated in this trial protocol. All vaccines were 
administered only by unblinded personnel who were qualified to perform that function under applicable 
laws and regulations for that specific trial. The unblinded personnel who administered the vaccine did 
not assess AEs.  
Randomization by using an interactive system (Interactive Web Response System [IWRS] or 
Interactive Voice Response System [IVRS]) was stratified by region (Asia Pacific and Latin America) 
and age range (children aged 4-5 years, 6-11 years, and 12-16 years) to ensure that each age range 
had the appropriate ratio of TDV to placebo in each region. In addition, recruitment followed an 
enrolment plan to ensure representative enrolment across the age ranges and regions. This was 
considered necessary to mitigate the relative difficulty of recruiting subjects at the extremes of the age 
ranges in this trial.

• 
Blinding (masking)  
As a double-blind trial, the subjects, data collectors (eg, investigators), designated 
pharmacists/vaccine administrators and data evaluators (eg, trial statisticians) were blinded to TDV or 
placebo administration until the time of randomization code break.

Table 12: Criteria for Exclusion from the PPS and PPSI 
Efficacy analysis 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary efficacy endpoint in this trial was VE of 2 doses of TDV in preventing VCD fever induced by 
any dengue serotype occurring from 30 days post-second vaccination (Day 120 [M4]) until the end of 
Part 1, with VE defined as 1 - (λV/λC) (where λV and λC denote the hazard rates for the TDV and 
placebo arms, respectively). 
The primary analysis of VE was done after the 2 criteria for the end of Part 1 had been fulfilled, ie: (1) 
at least 120 cases of VCD fever had accrued, and (2) the minimum duration of subject follow-up was 
at least 12 months post-second vaccination. 
The primary efficacy objective was considered to have been met if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% 
CI for the VE was above 25%. The following hypotheses were tested in a confirmatory manner 2-sided 
at a significance level of 5%: 
H0: 1 - λV/λC ≤0.25 
H1: 1 - λV/λC >0.25 
For the primary efficacy evaluation, a case of VCD fever was defined as febrile illness with a positive 
serotype-specific dengue detection RT-PCR (ie, positive dengue detection RT-PCR) and occurring at any 
time starting from 30 days post-second vaccination (Day 120 [M4]) through the end of Part 1. 
The primary analysis was performed on the PPS (ie, for the primary analysis at the end of Part 1). 
Vaccine efficacy and the 2-sided 95% CI were estimated using the Cox proportional-hazard model with 
trial vaccine group as a factor and age at baseline as a continuous covariate, with stratification by 
region. A p-value associated with the primary objective was also calculated. 
Subjects who withdrew consent or were lost to follow-up were censored at the time of last contact. 
Cases of VCD fever reported in the dry-run period were not taken into account for censoring. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 84/254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the analyses based on the PPS and FAS, discontinued subjects were censored at the day of 
discontinuation. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint included: 
1. Analysis using exact 95% CIs calculated as described by Breslow & Day. 
2. Analysis based on the FAS. 
3. Analysis in which cases of VCD fever were observed at any time post-second vaccination. 
Subgroup analyses were performed based on the PPS in analogy to the primary analysis of the primary 
efficacy endpoint with a null hypothesis of 1 - λV/λC ≤0 and included analyses by (only the most 
relevant are listed here):Age group (4-5 years/6-11 years/12-16 years).;  Region (Asia Pacific/Latin 
America);  Baseline seropositivity status (seropositive for at least 1 dengue serotype/seronegative for 
all dengue serotypes);  Combination of age group and region;   Combination of age group and baseline 
seropositivity status;  Combination of baseline seropositivity status and region and Prior vaccination 
against Yellow Fever (YF) or Japanese encephalitis (JE). 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint in this trial is VE of two doses of TDV in preventing hospitalization 
due to VCD fever induced by any dengue serotype occurring from 30 days post second vaccination 
(Day 120 [M4]) until the end of Part 2 (see Section 9.5.3.2). 
A hierarchical testing strategy was used and the key secondary efficacy endpoint was only to be tested 
in a confirmatory manner if statistical significance for the primary efficacy endpoint was achieved. 
Thus, the family wise Type I error rate was strongly controlled for the primary endpoint and the key 
secondary endpoint. 
After demonstration of statistical significance for the primary endpoint, the following hypotheses were 
tested in a confirmatory manner 2-sided at a significance level of 5%: 
H0: 1 - λV/λC ≤0 
H1: 1 - λV/λC >0 
The analysis of the key secondary efficacy endpoint was based on the PPS and assessed using data 
from Parts 1 and 2. The same analysis method as for the primary efficacy endpoint was used but the 
objective was considered to have been met if the lower bound of the 95% CI was >0. Subgroup 
analyses were performed for the key secondary efficacy endpoint in a similar fashion to the subgroup 
analyses for the primary endpoint. 
Additional Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Other secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed (including subgroup analyses) based on the PPS 
similar to the key secondary efficacy endpoint. The null hypotheses for these endpoints was 1 - λV/λ
C ≤0. Consistent with other multivalent vaccines, efficacy against individual serotypes was analysed 
without formal adjustment for multiplicity. 
Severity of VCD fever was determined in two different ways, according to the independent DCAC and 
according to the WHO criteria (1997) for DHF, as described below.

Figure 6: Disposition of Subjects (End of Part 2) for the Efficacy and Immunogenicity 
Analyses (All Subjects) 
Of the 20,099 randomised subjects, 20,071 subjects received at least one vaccination. Of these 
subjects, 98.4% received 2 vaccinations in Part 1. Overall, 97.4%, 96.9%, and 96.3% of subjects 
completed Part 1, Part 2, and until 12 months after end of Part 1, respectively, with no important 
difference in premature discontinuations between placebo and TDV. 
The reasons for discontinuation of subjects before receiving the second vaccination were mainly 
withdrawal of consent by either the subject or a parent(s)/guardian(s) (83.0% and 78.9% for placebo 
and TDV). Similarly, in Part 1 overall the most frequent reason for discontinuation was withdrawal of 
consent by either the subject or a parent(s)/guardian(s) (72.6% and 70.6% for placebo and TDV). 
For Part 2, the most frequent reason for discontinuation was also withdrawal of consent by either the 
subject or a parent(s)/guardian(s) (37.5% and 45.8% for placebo and TDV) but there was an 
increased proportion of withdrawals due to pregnancy (34.4% and 23.6% for placebo and TDV).  
A total of 6573 (placebo) and 13,164 (TDV) subjects received two vaccinations, 6519 (placebo), 
13,033 (TDV) subjects completed Part 1, and 6487 (placebo) and 12,961 (TDV) subjects completed 
Part 2. 
Overall, significant protocol deviations were reported for 7.4% of subjects, with most occurring in Part 
1 (overall 6.8% of subjects at the end of Part 1 vs 7.4% at the end of Part 2 and 2.6% at 12 months 
after end of Part 1) and there was no difference between placebo and TDV. 
The most common significant protocol deviations that occurred at an incidence of >1% were study 
procedures and assessments, which occurred in 5.1% of subjects overall to the end of Part 1, 5.7% of 
subjects overall to the end of Part 2, and 1.1% of subjects overall to 12 months after end of Part 1. 
There was no difference between placebo and TDV, however these occurred more frequently in Latin 
America. The only other significant protocol deviation that occurred at an incidence of >1% in Part 1 
and Part 2 was “other GCP deviation” (1.1% of placebo subjects in Asia Pacific in Part 1 and Part 2).  
These were most commonly temperature excursions (excursions in IP storage temperatures), data

Conduct of the study  
The original protocol had 4 amendments, which are summarised below.  
There have been in total four protocol amendment 1. The first one was implemented before trial 
initiation and regarding the other three, the protocol Amendment 4 (dated 18 May 2020) was the only 
with a substantial amendment: Modification of the trial design to include a booster vaccination in a 
subgroup of subjects aged 4-11 years at trial entry. As detailed in the Clinical trial protocol the 
rationale is the following.  This protocol amendment is due to the fact that, although a generally 
consistent overall efficacy and continued protection against hospitalized dengue is observed after a 2-
dose vaccination regimen with TDV (2 single doses 3 months apart), data also indicate a trend towards 
a reduction in overall vaccine efficacy in the second year after vaccination. This observation suggests a 
waning in vaccine efficacy and therefore the present ongoing phase III trial will evaluate the effect of a 
booster dose. Due to the absence of a correlate of protection in dengue, the booster effect can only be 
demonstrated by efficacy data. Adding a booster phase to the present ongoing DEN-301 trial gives the 
opportunity to administer a booster dose of TDV to assess vaccine efficacy against virologically 
confirmed dengue.

Baseline Dengue Serostatus: Baseline seropositivity was defined as seropositive (reciprocal neutralizing 
titre ≥10) for at least 1 dengue serotype or seronegative (reciprocal neutralizing titre <10 for all 
dengue serotypes). Baseline dengue serostatus data are summarized for the PPS in Table 15 (all 
subjects), Table 16 (by region and country), and Table 17 (by age group).

Overall,  27.7%  of  subjects  were  seronegative  (ie,  seronegative  against  all  4  dengue  serotypes)  and 
72.3% seropositive at baseline, with similar proportions per trial group.

Table 16: Summary of Baseline Seropositivity Status (Per-Protocal Set) (by Region and 
Country) 
As expected, the proportion of baseline seropositive subjects was lower in subjects aged 4 to 5 years 
(58.7%) compared with those aged 6 to 11 years (68.9%) or 12 to 16 years (83.7%). The overall 
baseline serostatus was similar for subjects in Asia Pacific (74.2% seropositive, 25.8% seronegative) 
and Latin America (70.7% seropositive, 29.3% seronegative).  
Table 17: Summary of Baseline Seropositivity Status (Per-Protocol Set) (By Age Group) 
The history of prior vaccinations against JE or YF also varied by region. Prior vaccination against JE 
only occurred in the Asia Pacific region (53.2% of subjects), primarily in Sri Lanka (95.6%) and 
Thailand (91.9%) where subjects are routinely vaccinated against JE; only 1.4% of subjects in The 
Philippines were vaccinated against JE. Prior vaccination against YF only occurred in Latin America 
(38.2% of subjects overall; in Colombia [81.7%], Brazil [49.1%], and Panama [6.5%]), with the 
exception of 1 subject in Sri Lanka.

The number of subjects included in the Dry-Run Set, Randomised Set, SS, FAS, FASI, PPS, and PPSI 
are summarized in Table 18. 
Table 18: Analysis Sets Overall and by Region 
Of 23,401 screened subjects, 16,129 subjects were included in the dry-run and 20,099 subjects were 
randomised, of whom 20,071 subjects (99.9%) were included in the FAS and SS and 19,021 subjects 
(94.6%) were included in the PPS. Overall, 4000 subjects (19.9%) were included in the

Outcomes and estimation  
Efficacy 
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Case and Serotype Distribution 
Incidence rates and the dengue serotype distribution for VCD fever from first dose to 18 months post 
second vaccine dose (Parts 1 and 2 combined) varied by region and country, as shown in Table 20 for 
the safety set.

The serotype distribution for VCD fever cases in the placebo group, ie, unaffected by active vaccine 
administration, from the first placebo dose to 18 months post second placebo dose is depicted in 
Figure 7, showing the varying distribution of serotypes in the participating countries.

Primary Efficacy Analysis 
The primary objective to show efficacy in the prevention of VCD fever caused by any serotype (ie, all 4 
serotypes combined) from 30 days to 12 months post second vaccine dose (until the end of Part 1; 
primary endpoint) was met. Rates of VCD fever were 2.4% in the placebo group and 0.5% in the TDV 
group, with an associated VE of 80.2% (95% CI: 73.3%, 85.3%; p<0.001). The lower bound of the 
2-sided 95% CI for the VE was above 25%, and thus the criterion to meet the primary objective was 
fulfilled. As shown in the placebo group, all 4 dengue serotypes contributed to the primary efficacy 
result.

The cumulative incidence of VCD fever and associated 95% CIs are presented over time during Part 1 
(up to 12 months post second vaccine dose) in Figure 8, showing a steady increase in the cumulative 
incidence in both groups, with a steeper slope in the placebo group and the separation between curves

Three  sensitivity  analyses  of  the  primary  endpoint  were  performed  (analysis  using  exact  95%  CIs 
calculated as described by Breslow & Day on the PPS; analysis based on the FAS, and analysis in which 
cases of VCD fever were observed at any time post-second vaccination). The results are shown in the

Secondary Efficacy Analyses 
Hospitalization due to Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From 30 Days to 18 Months Post Second 
Vaccine Dose (Key Secondary Endpoint) 
After successfully meeting the primary objective of the trial, the VE of TDV in the prevention of 
hospitalization due to VCD fever from 30 days to 18 months post second vaccine dose (until the end of 
Part 2), the key secondary endpoint of the trial, was tested. The rates of hospitalization due to VCD 
fever were 1.0% in the placebo group and 0.1% in the TDV group, with an associated VE against 
hospitalization due to VCD fever of 90.4% (95% CI: 82.6%, 94.7%; p<0.001) (see Table 22). The 
lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the VE was above 0%, and thus the criterion to meet this key 
secondary objective was fulfilled.

The cumulative incidence of hospitalized VCD fever and associated 95% CIs are presented over time in 
Figure 9 showing a separation of curves after Month 1, with a steeper increase in the placebo group, in 
particular from Month 3 to Month 6, which was due to a rapid acquisition of cases during an outbreak 
of DENV-2 in Sri Lanka in 2017.

To help interpreting the VE data against hospitalized VCD, the following Tables describe the number of 
hospitalized cases observed in the different countries (and also according to each dengue serotype) for 
the placebo group for the time period 30 days post second dose until end of Part 2. The tables also 
include the “Percent of hospitalized VCD Cases Among VCD Cases”

analysis by serotype and by country 
Table 24:  Hospitalised VCD (from 30 Days post-2nd vaccination to end Part 2)- Subgroup 
analysis by country 
The country with more hospitalized VCD cases was Sri Lanka (44 out 66 cases in the placebo group) 
followed by Thailand with 11 cases. When examining the “Percent of hospitalized VCD Cases Among 
VCD Cases”, the country with the highest percentage was Sri Lanka (72.1%) again followed by 
Thailand (47.8%). It is noted that 41 out of the 44 cases in Sri Lanka were due to DENV-2, whereas in 
Thailand (5, 4, 1 and 1 cases were due to DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3 and DENV4, respectively). Thus, 
the main contributors to the estimate of VE against hospitalized VCD were cases in Sri Lanka due to an 
outbreak of DENV-2.

Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever Caused by Each Individual Serotype From 30 Days to 18 Months 
Post Second Vaccine Dose  
Analyses of VCD fever from 30 days to 18 months post second vaccine dose (until end of Part 2) showed 
varying efficacy of TDV against each individual dengue serotype (see Table 27).

Fever by Each Individual Serotype From 30 Days to 18 Months Post Second Vaccine Dose 
(Per-Protocol Set) 
Severe Forms of Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From 30 Days to 18 Months Post Second 
Vaccine Dose 
From 30 days to 18 months post second vaccine dose (until end of Part 2), 1 subject in the placebo 
group (N evaluated: 6316), who was seropositive at baseline, and 2 subjects in the TDV group (N 
evaluated: 12,700), who were seronegative at baseline, had severe VCD fever as determined by the 
Dengue Case Adjudication Committee (DCAC) (see Table 31 below for individual subject details). Due 
to these low rates, VE could not be demonstrated for DCAC-defined severe VCD fever (VE: 2.3%; 95% 
CI: -977.5%, 91.1%). All of these 3 cases, which occurred in The Philippines, were caused by DENV-3 
and had functional impairment among the clinical presentations (reduced pulse pressure, hypotensive 
shock, or respiratory distress).

Seven subjects in the placebo group compared with 2 subjects in the TDV group had DHF based on 
WHO criteria (1997) from 30 days to 18 months post second vaccine dose (see Table 28). The efficacy 
of TDV against DHF was shown with an associated VE of 85.9% (95% CI: 31.9%, 97.1%). In the 
placebo group, 1 of these cases occurred in a baseline seronegative subject and was caused by DENV-
3, while the remaining 6 cases occurred in baseline seropositive subjects and were caused by either 
DENV-1 (2 cases) or DENV-2 (4 cases) (see Table 31 for individual subject details). The 2 cases in the 
TDV group were both caused by DENV-3; one of these cases occurred in a baseline seronegative 
subject and the other in a baseline seropositive subject. Of note, 1 of the 2 cases in the TDV group was 
classified as both DHF and DCAC-defined severe VCD and was therefore included in both respective 
analyses. Thus, taking both definitions together, there were 8 cases in the placebo group versus 3 
cases in the TDV group who had severe forms of dengue.

Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
In the following subsections, results from additional efficacy analyses are summarized focusing on the 
data collected up to 24 months post second vaccine dose. These exploratory analyses have not been 
powered to draw any confirmatory conclusions, and results are descriptive only. It should also be 
noted that in several sub-analyses (eg, by time period, dengue serotype, or baseline serostatus) and 
the combination thereof, sample sizes and incidence rates became small, often precluding any robust 
conclusions due to the limited data. 
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From 30 Days to 24 Months Post Second Vaccine Dose 
Exploratory analyses of the incidence of VCD fever from 30 days to 24 months post second vaccine 
dose support the results seen for the primary and secondary endpoints as described before, 
substantiating the efficacy of TDV.

Table 33: Trial DEN-301: Virologically Confirmed Dengue From First Vaccine Dose to 24 
Months Post Second Vaccine Dose (Safety Set) 
From First Vaccine Dose Until Second Vaccine Dose 
During the 3 months between the first and second vaccine dose, the incidence of VCD fever was 
34/6317 cases (0.5%) in the placebo group and 13/12,704 (0.1%) in the TDV group, with an 
associated VE of 81.1% (95% CI: 64.1%, 90.0%), indicating a rapid onset of the effect of TDV from 
the first vaccine dose onwards. Among the VCD cases reported between the first and second vaccine 
doses there were 8 cases leading to hospitalization (6 in the placebo group and 2 in the TDV group). In 
addition, it is important to note that all 4 dengue serotypes were reported to have induced VCD fever 
in this 3-month period.  
Characteristics of Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever Based on Clinical Signs, Symptoms, and 
Laboratory Data 
Results from an analysis of clinical signs and laboratory data of subjects with VCD fever during the 
period from first vaccine dose to 24 months post second dose suggested some impact on the dengue 
pathophysiology. There were higher proportions of subjects in the placebo group than in the TDV group 
with evidence of bleeding (8.0% versus 4.6%), a positive tourniquet test (11.8% versus 9.2%), 
plasma leakage (5.4% versus 2.3%), hematocrit increase ≥20% (10.1% versus 4.3%), and platelet 
count ≤100 × 109/L (22.0% versus 5.8%) or ≤50 109/L (10.5% versus 2.6%) (Table not included). 
These differences were more pronounced in baseline seropositive subjects than in baseline 
seronegative subjects, or only seen in baseline seropositive subjects. However, the data in baseline 
seronegative subjects did not suggest any change in the severity in presentation of VCD fever. Similar 
findings were seen for the period from first vaccine dose until 18 months post second dose, ie, for 
Part 1 and 2 of the trial combined. 
Subgroup Analyses of Efficacy 
Comprehensive subgroup analyses were performed to better understand the VE data and to identify 
potential determinants of VE. In general, VE in the subgroups as described in the following sections 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 109/254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
could largely be explained by the serotype distribution in respective subgroups and the associated 
variation of efficacy across the 4 serotypes. In the following sections, results from subgroup analyses 
by age group (4-5, 6-11, and 12-16 years), region (Asia Pacific region, Latin America), country, and 
prior vaccination against YF or JE are summarized.  
In addition, regression models assessed the potential impact of confounding variables. These models 
included factors for vaccine group, age group, baseline serostatus, prior YF or JE vaccination, region, 
and gender, as well as various interaction terms between these factors. Results were largely consistent 
with those from the preplanned subgroup analyses described in the following sections (Figures not 
shown in this assessment report). 
It should be noted that these subgroup analyses are exploratory, and results are descriptive only. 
Furthermore, due to multiple levels of subgroup analyses (eg, by prespecified subgroup, dengue 
serotype, and baseline serostatus), sample sizes and incidence rates were sometimes small, which 
does not allow for any robust conclusions. 
Vaccine Efficacy by Age Group 
The VE of TDV in preventing VCD fever, from 30 days to 24 months post second dose, across 
predefined age groups (4 to 5 years, 6 to 11 years, and 12 to 16 years) is shown in Figure 13.

Exploratory Analyses by Individual Age 
To further explore the above described results from the prespecified subgroup analyses by age 
category, the VE of TDV against VCD fever was analysed by individual age from 4 to 16 years. It 
should be noted that the number of cases were very small in this exploratory sub-analysis, precluding 
any robust conclusions from these data.

Virologically Confirmed Dengue (Overall) 
Vaccine Efficacy by Region and Country 
Results from subgroup analyses by region and country were reflective of the respective epidemiological 
setting, ie, the serotype distribution, in the respective country and region.  
During Year 1, 181 VCD fever cases (placebo: 127 [4.3%]; TDV: 54 [0.9%]) occurred in the Asia 
Pacific region and 29 (placebo: 22 [0.7%]; TDV: 7 [0.1]) in Latin America. During Year 2, 126 cases 
(60 [2.1%] and 66 [1.1%], respectively) occurred in the Asia Pacific region and 77 (46 [1.4%] and 31 
[0.5%], respectively) in Latin America. 
A descriptive comparison of the incidence density (incidence per 100 person-years) between Year 1 
and Year 2 in the Asia Pacific region showed a decrease in the incidence density for any VCD in the 
placebo group (ie, unaffected by the administration of an active vaccine) from 4.9 in Year 1 to 2.2 in 
Year 2 (see Table 35). Such decreases in the placebo group were seen in The Philippines (5.4-3.1) and 
especially in Sri Lanka (9.9-1.0), but not in Thailand where the incidence density increased from 0.9 to 
1.8. The marked decrease in the VCD incidence in the placebo group in Sri Lanka is attributable to an 
outbreak during Year 1 that led to a rapid acquisition of VCD cases. In Latin America, the incidence 
density increased in all countries from Year 1 to Year 2, with the exception of Panama where it 
decreased. In Nicaragua, where no VCD cases were reported during Year 1 (incidence density of 0), 
VCD reports led to incidence densities of 4.8 (placebo) and 1.2 (TDV) during Year 2, which were the 
highest rates among the Latin American countries during Year 2.

The serotype distribution for VCD fever cases from 30 days to 24 months post second vaccine dose in 
the placebo group, ie, unaffected by active vaccine administration, is depicted in Figure 16, showing the 
varying distribution of serotypes in the participating regions and countries.

In the period from 30 days to 24 months post second vaccine dose, VE of TDV was seen in both the Asia 
Pacific region and Latin America, overall as well as in subgroups by baseline serostatus (see Figure 17).

The exploratory year-by-year analysis of VE by region also showed the VE of TDV in each of the time 
periods, with slightly lower VE values in Year 2 compared with Year 1 (see Figure 18)

Latin America (94.5%) as shown in Table 36.

Vaccine Efficacy by Country 
Similar to the efficacy results by region, results from subgroup analyses by country were reflective of 
the varying epidemiological setting in each country, mainly the serotype distribution, and the observed 
efficacy of TDV by serotype and baseline serostatus as described previously. It should be noted that 
due to multiple levels of subgroup analyses (eg, by country, dengue serotype, and baseline 
serostatus), sample sizes and incidence rates were sometimes small, which does not allow for any 
robust conclusions.  
The VE of TDV in preventing VCD was seen in each of the 8 participating countries (see Figure 19). 
Results also suggest the efficacy of TDV in subgroups by baseline serostatus within each country, with 
the exception of baseline seronegative subjects in The Philippines where the VE value was negative. 
This finding can be explained by the serotype distribution in The Philippines where the majority of VCD 
cases were caused by DENV-3 and the efficacy results by dengue serotype that suggested no efficacy 
of TDV against VCD caused by DENV-3 in baseline seronegative subjects.

Where estimable,  VE  values for  the prevention  of  VCD  fever leading to hospitalization were generally 
higher than for overall VCD. However, due to the very low number of cases in each country no robust 
conclusions can be drawn from these data (Table 37).

Data taken from Table 37 and Figure 19   
Vaccine Efficacy by Prior Vaccination Against Yellow Fever or Japanese Encephalitis 
Subgroup analyses by prior vaccination against YF or JE showed VE values of 86.1% in those subjects 
previously vaccinated against JE, 68.8% in those previously vaccinated against YF, and 60.6% in those 
not previously vaccinated against either JE or YF (see Table 38), suggesting an impact of prior JE or YF 
vaccination on the VE of TDV. However, this finding can be explained by regional differences in JE and 
YF vaccination as well as by the serotype distribution. 
A vast majority of subjects vaccinated against JE were from Sri Lanka and Thailand, where subjects 
are routinely vaccinated against JE. Because VCD cases in Sri Lanka and Thailand were predominantly 
caused by DENV-2, also the cases in the subgroup of subjects with prior JE vaccination were 
predominantly caused by DENV-2, which resulted in the high VE in this subgroup. Similarly, as almost 
all subjects vaccinated against YF were from Latin America, predominantly from Colombia and Brazil, 
VCD cases in this subgroup were predominantly caused by DENV-1. As a result, in the subgroup of 
subjects who were not vaccinated against either JE or YF, the largest proportion of VCD fever cases 
were caused by DENV-3, which were predominantly reported in The Philippines. 
The changes between Year 1 and Year 2 were reflective of the changes in the serotype distribution in 
these subgroups in Year 2 compared with Year 1, as shown for the placebo group in Figure 20.

Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From First Dose to 36 Months Post Second Vaccine Dose. 
The overall VE in preventing VCD fever from 30 days post second vaccination up to 36 months is 59.6% 
(95%CI: 53.6, 64.9), according to the PP set.

Efficacy results from first dose until 36 months post second dose are briefly summarized using the 
safety set (to reflect the real-life clinical setting as close as possible): 
•  VCD caused by any serotype: The efficacy of TDV against overall VCD was seen in the total 
safety set (VE: 62.0%; 95% CI: 56.6%, 66.7%) as well as in baseline seronegative subjects (VE: 
54.3%; 95% CI: 41.9%, 64.1%) and baseline seropositive subjects (VE: 65.0%; 95% CI: 58.9%, 
70.1%). 
•  VCD leading to hospitalization: For VCD leading to hospitalization, the VE of TDV was 83.6% 
(95% CI: 76.8%, 88.4%) for the total safety set, 77.1% (95% CI: 58.6%, 87.3%) for baseline 
seronegative subjects, and 86.0% (95% CI: 78.4%, 91.0%) for baseline seropositive subjects. 
•  Efficacy against individual dengue serotypes varied by serotype, largely consistent with the results 
based on data up to 24 months post second dose: 
−  VCD caused by individual serotypes: VE estimates were 51.8% for DENV-1 
(95% CI: 41.1%, 60.5%), 86.0% for DENV-2 (95% CI: 80.9%, 89.8%), and 41.9% for DENV-
3 (95% CI: 25.2%, 55.0%). Due to the lower incidence of VCD caused by DENV-4 compared 
with other dengue serotypes, the results for this serotype were inconclusive, but the VE 
estimate of 41.5% (95% CI: -11.7%, 69.4%) was similar to that for DENV-1 or DENV-3 and 
thus suggested efficacy. In baseline seropositive subjects, efficacy was seen against each 
individual dengue serotype. In baseline seronegative subjects, efficacy was seen for DENV-1 
and DENV-2, while for DENV-3, results did not suggest efficacy (VE: -23.4; 95%CI: -125.3, 
32.4); the small number of 10 cases of VCD caused by DENV-4 in baseline seronegative 
subjects as well as their occurrence in time over the 3-year period do not allow for a robust 
conclusion. It is however noted that in the safety set for dengue seronegative subjects at 
baseline, there were more cases of VCD due to DENV-4 in the TDV group (8 cases) than in the 
control group (2 cases) which resulted in a negative VE although with very wide CI. (VE -
105%; 95%CI: -867; 56).  
−  VCD leading to hospitalization caused by individual serotypes: VE estimates were 
72.0% for DENV-1 (95% CI: 50.1%, 84.3%), 96.7% for DENV-2 (95% CI: 91.8%, 98.7%), 
and 41.1% for DENV-3 (95% CI: -14.6%, 69.7). There were only 3 cases of DENV-4 induced 
VCD leading to hospitalization (all in the placebo group). Results for VCD leading to 
hospitalization by baseline serostatus were in line with those for overall VCD as described 
above, with generally higher VE estimates. There were no DENV-4 induced VCD cases leading 
to hospitalization in baseline seronegative subjects.  
Severe forms of dengue: A total of 8 cases of DCAC-defined severe VCD were reported in the safety

set, 5 cases in the placebo group and 3 in the TDV group (VE: 70.2%; 95% CI: -24.7%, 92.9%). In 
the same period, 13 cases of DHF occurred in the placebo group and 9 cases in the TDV group (VE: 
65.4%; 95% CI: 19.0%, 85.2%), including 3 cases (1 in the placebo group, 2 in the TDV group) that 
were classified as both DCAC-defined severe and DHF. Thus, taken together, there were 17 cases of 
DCAC-defined severe VCD or DHF in the placebo group and 10 such cases in the TDV group (the 
randomization ratio of 1:2 [placebo:TDV] should be considered. As can be seen in the next two Tables 
(further discussed in the safety section) the efficacy in terms of prevention of DHF and severe cases is 
only observed in Dengue seropositive subjects at baseline and not in those seronegative.

•  Characteristics of VCD fever based on clinical signs, symptoms, and laboratory data: 
Results from an exploratory analysis of clinical signs and laboratory data of subjects with VCD 
fever showed no major changes in the trend seen in the period up to 24 months post second dose. 
The favorable impact of TDV on the dengue pathophysiology (eg, signs of plasma leakage, 
bleeding, or thrombocytopenia) was mainly seen in baseline seropositive subjects). In baseline 
seronegative subjects, an imbalance was noted for the key parameter of plasma leakage, mainly 
explainable by the local clinical practices at a site in Sri Lanka (ie, high hospitalization rate and 
close monitoring with serial ultrasonography) that prevent a robust treatment comparison. Four of 
the 7 VCD cases in the TDV group with plasma leakage were reported from this Sri Lankan site. In 
addition, the low frequencies (3 of 138 VCD cases in the placebo group vs 7 of 130 VCD cases in 
the TDV group) prevent a robust comparison between the 2 groups. It is also important to consider 
that the comparisons are based on the smaller denominator of the number of VCD cases and not 
based on all subjects in the analysis set, and thus do not consider the vaccine efficacy. Review of 
overall clinical symptomatology along with potential confounding factors did not suggest a 
worsening in severity of VCD cases in the TDV group.  
•  Subgroup analyses by age group and country: Exploratory analyses by age group (4-5, 6-11, 
and 12-16 years) of efficacy against overall VCD or VCD leading to hospitalization did not show 
clear evidence of an age effect. Exploratory subgroup analyses of efficacy by country showed 
positive VE values across all countries, ranging from 39.6% to 84.4% for overall VCD and from 
64.6% to 100% for VCD leading to hospitalization. As seen in the data up to 24 months post 
second dose, differences between countries were mainly attributable to the serotype distribution in 
the respective country. Although frequencies of VCD leading to hospitalization varied between 
countries, as evident in the placebo group, likely due to the local clinical practices, the VE 
estimates for VCD leading to hospitalization were consistently higher than for overall VCD in each 
participating country. 
•  Second episodes of VCD: During the period from first dose to 36 months post second dose, a 
total of 11 subjects reported a second VCD episode after having had a previous episode: 9 of 
6687 subjects in the placebo group, including 1 whose second episode was caused by the same 
dengue serotype as the first episode (DENV-3), and 2 of 13,380 subjects in the TDV group, 
resulting in a relative risk of 0.11 based on the total safety set (95% CI: 0.02, 0.51). None of 
these second episodes led to hospitalization. Of note, second episodes were not considered in 
analyses of overall VCD, but in cumulative analyses by dengue serotype except for the 1 case of a 
homotypic second episode. 
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From 25 to 36 Months (Year 3) Post Second Vaccine Dose 
In this section, efficacy results are briefly summarized based on data from 25 to 36 months (Year 3) 
post second dose (based on the PPS). Results from a year-by-year analysis of the data up to 24 
months post second dose have been summarized above. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 123/254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During Year 3 post second dose, efficacy results were as follows:  
•  VCD caused by any serotype: The protection against overall VCD continued, in the total PPS 
(VE: 44.7%; 95% CI: 32.5%, 54.7%) as well as in baseline seronegative subjects (VE: 35.5%; 
95% CI: 7.3%, 55.1%) and seropositive subjects (VE: 48.3%; 95% CI: 34.2%, 59.3%). 
Compared with Year 2, some decline in the efficacy against overall VCD was observed during 
Year 3, which was mainly driven by VCD that did not lead to hospitalization.  
•  VCD leading to hospitalization: Little change from Year 2 to Year 3 was observed in the efficacy 
against VCD leading to hospitalization with VE values during Year 3 of 70.8% (95% CI: 49.6%, 
83.0%) for the total PPS, 45.0% (95% CI: -42.6%, 78.8%) for baseline seronegative subjects, and 
78.4% (95% CI: 57.1%, 89.1%) for baseline seropositive subjects. Differences in the VE estimates 
against VCD leading to hospitalization between baseline seronegative and seropositive subjects are 
mainly attributable to the efficacy seen against VCD caused by DENV-3 (see next bullet); it should 
also be noted that the overall number of cases was small in baseline seronegative subjects, 
resulting in wide CIs. 
•  VCD caused by individual serotypes: With regard to the efficacy against VCD (overall and 
leading to hospitalization) caused by individual dengue serotypes and by baseline serostatus in 
Year 3 compared with Year 2, results were as follows:  
−  DENV-1: For any VCD caused by DENV-1, in baseline seronegative subjects, the vaccine 
efficacy estimate was marginally positive (VE: 17.2%; 95% CI: -31.8%, 47.9%), while in 
baseline seropositive subjects, efficacy was observed with only a modest decline (VE: 45.4%; 
95% CI: 24.5%, 60.6%). For VCD leading to hospitalization, high VE estimates similar to those 
in Year 2 were seen without any decline in efficacy in both baseline seronegative and 
seropositive subjects. 
−  DENV-2: For both DENV-2 induced overall VCD and VCD leading to hospitalization, robust 
efficacy was seen in Year 3 compared with Year 2 without any decline in both baseline 
seronegative and seropositive subjects. 
−  DENV-3: For any VCD caused by DENV-3, a marginally positive efficacy estimate was seen in 
both baseline seronegative subjects (VE: 9.5%; 95% CI: -144.7%, 66.5%) and seropositive 
subjects (VE: 15.2%; 95% CI: -46.1%, 50.8%). Of note, in baseline seronegative subjects, 
the VE value was positive in Year 3 whereas it was negative in the 2 preceding years. For VCD 
leading to hospitalization during Year 3, in baseline seronegative subjects, an imbalance in the 
number of cases was seen in the TDV group (7 hospitalizations of 11 VCD cases) compared 
with the placebo group (1 hospitalization out of 6 VCD cases) (the randomization ratio of 2:1 
[TDV:placebo] should be considered). This imbalance is likely impacted by the different 
thresholds for hospitalization at the sites in The Philippines and Sri Lanka, the 2 countries 
where the 17 VCD cases occurred: 6 in Sri Lanka (all in the TDV group and at 1 site and all 
leading to hospitalization) and 11 in The Philippines (1 of 6 in the placebo group and 1 of 5 in 
the TDV group leading to hospitalization). In the cumulative data from first dose onwards 
(safety set), high rates of hospitalization have been observed in the placebo group in Sri Lanka 
(68 of 100 VCD cases [68.0%]) compared with The Philippines (17 of 181 VCD cases [9.4%]. 
The high rate of hospitalization in Sri Lanka is likely for enhanced clinical monitoring as per 
local clinical practice. In baseline seropositive subjects, high efficacy similar to Year 2 was seen 
for VCD leading to hospitalization in Year 3.  
-DENV-4: In baseline seronegative subjects, there were too few cases of VCD caused by DENV-
4 (5 cases in total) to allow for meaningful conclusions. In baseline seropositive subjects, there 
was little change in the VE estimate compared to Year 2, although frequencies were lower

compared to the other dengue serotypes. In a cumulative analysis from the first dose onwards 
(safety set), a VE value of 60.7% (95% CI: 16.0%, 81.6%) was seen in baseline seropositive 
subjects. Only 1 case of DENV-4 induced VCD led to hospitalization in Year 3 (in the placebo 
group). 
The following two Tables have been prepared to illustrate the number of hospitalized cases observed in 
the different countries (and also according to each dengue serotype) for the placebo group for the time

Seronegative Subjects. 
In response to the outstanding MO raised at D180 that questioned the indication of the TDV vaccine for 
baseline seronegative subjects, the applicant provided the final data of pivotal Trial DEN-301 after 
completion of the pre-booster phase until 54 months post second dose (Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the trial), 
focusing on the benefit-risk profile in baseline seronegative subjects. 
Of the total of 20,071 subjects in the safety set, 18,260 subjects (91.0%) completed Part 3 of the trial, 
ie, 4 to 4.5 years of follow-up after the second vaccine dose; this percentage was similar in the 2 trial 
groups.  
The following analyses were made: 
• 
Incidences of Virologically Confirmed Dengue Cases: Compared with the 36 months data, the 
additional 18-month follow-up period, including 7 cases leading to hospitalization, 1 case of 
DHF, and no DCAC-defined severe cases.

It  follows  further  detailed  analyses  regarding  the  results  obtained  in  baseline  seronegative  and 
seropositive subjects from 30 days to 54 months post second vaccine dose. 
•  Vaccine Efficacy in Baseline Seronegative Subjects.  
The benefit of TDV against overall VCD in baseline seronegative subjects was confirmed in the analysis 
of VCD from first dose to 54 months post second vaccine dose with a VE estimate of 53.5% (95% CI: 
41.6%, 62.9% [safety set]) (see Figure 21). The VE against VCD leading to hospitalization was 79.3% 
(95%  CI:  63.5%,  88.2%).  Detailed  analysis  according  to  the  infecting  dengue  virus  serotype,  and 
different periods of time are shown in Figure 21. Because of these different hospitalization rate of VCD 
cases, analyses were repeated excluding the data from Sri Lanka (Figure 22).

During the last 18 months up to 54 months post second dose in TDV Trial DEN-301, there was 1 case 
of a severe form of dengue (DCAC-defined severe VCD or DHF) in baseline seronegative subjects 
(Figure 22): a case of DHF caused by DENV-1 in the placebo group. Thus, during the entire period 
from first dose to 54 months post second dose, 2 cases of DHF occurred in the placebo group versus 4 
cases in the TDV group (VE:  3.4%; 95% CI: -464.7%, 81.1%), the 1:2 randomization (placebo:TDV) 
should be considered. For severe forms of dengue combined (DCAC-defined severe VCD and/or DHF), 
the frequencies were 2 versus 5 cases (VE: -29.2%; 95% CI:  566.1%, 74.9%). Of note, 1 case was 
classified as both DHF and DCAC-defined severe VCD (during Year 2 post second dose in the TDV 
group;Table 43). 
Because 2 of the DHF cases in the TDV group were from Sri Lanka (both occurred during Year 3 post 
second dose; Table 43), incidences in corresponding sensitivity analyses excluding Sri Lanka changed to 
2 versus 2 DHF cases (VE: 47.5%; 95% CI: -272.9%, 92.6%) or 2 versus 3 cases of severe forms of 
dengue (VE: 21.3%; 95% CI: -371.6%, 86.9%).

•  Vaccine Efficacy by Trial Interval in Baseline Seronegative Subjects 
Results from the year-by-year analysis across dengue serotypes showed continued VE against VCD and 
VCD leading to hospitalization during Year 4, ie, 37 to 48 months post second vaccine dose, in baseline 
seronegative subjects with VE estimates of 60.2% and 100%, respectively (Figure 23).

In the last 18 months of the cumulative period (including Year 4), the VE against overall VCD was 
46.9% and against hospitalized VCD 100% (Figure 23). It should be noted that not all subjects 
completed the last 6 months following Year 4, as some were enrolled into the booster phase. Also, not 
all subjects will have passed through the peak dengue season during the months following Year 4, 
which may have introduced bias.

Protocol Set) (continued) 
Additional data provided now by the Applicant describe VE covering the period from 30 days to 54 
months post second dose (PP set). It is shown that VE against VCD was high in the three age groups 
analysed, with the lowest VE estimate [41% (95%CI: 21%, 55%)] observed in the youngest age group 
(4-5 years of age). VE estimates were always positive when VE was calculated, for each age group, 
according to the baseline serostatus, and also when calculated, for each age group, according to the 
serotype of the infected Dengue virus. It is noted, however, that 95%CI of the VE estimates were 
wide, and in some cases crossed zero, due to the few cases that were observed in some of the 
subgroups analysed. 
Similarly, VE estimates against hospitalized VCD were positive (with wide CI), for both baseline 
seropositive and seronegative subjects when each age group was analysed, from 30 days to 54 months 
post second dose (PP set), according to the baseline serostatus. Importantly, no evidence of increased 
hospitalized VCD for any age group was observed when the data were analysed by one-year intervals.

Analyses of VCD Caused by DENV-3 or DENV-4 in Baseline Seronegative Subjects  
VCD Caused by DENV-3 
The data up to 54 months post second dose did not suggest efficacy against VCD caused by DENV-3 in 
baseline  seronegative  subjects,  both  in  the  cumulative  and  the  year-by-year  analysis).  This  is  also 
reflected in the cumulative incidence curve (see Figure 30).

VCD Caused by DENV-4. 
Up to 54 months post second dose, a total of 12 cases of VCD caused by DENV-4 were observed in the 
TDV group, of which 4 occurred during the last 18 months. Importantly, none of these 12 cases led to 
hospitalization, indicating no risk for severe disease. In comparison, there were 3 cases caused by 
DENV-4 observed in the placebo group, 1 of which occurred during the last 18 months and led to 
hospitalization. It should be noted that this hospitalized VCD case in the placebo group was removed 
from the interval analysis (ie, Year 4 or last 18 months) because of the prespecified censoring rule as it 
was a second episode but is included in the cumulative analysis. 
Of note, 3 of the 4 VCD cases in the last 18 months in the TDV group occurred in the last 6 months 
which was not uniform for all subjects; this may have introduced bias (as mentioned above). 
Virologically confirmed dengue fever from First Dose to 54 Months Post Second Dose in Baseline 
Seropositive  Subjects. 
The VE against overall VCD from first dose to 54 months post second dose in baseline seropositive 
subjects was 64.2% (95% CI: 58.4%, 69.2%) and against VCD leading to hospitalization 85.9% (95% 
CI: 78.7%, 90.7%). Analyses of overall VCD and VCD leading to hospitalization by dengue serotype 
demonstrated the efficacy against each of the 4 dengue serotypes in baseline seropositive subjects. 
During the last 18 months, the VE against overall VCD in baseline seropositive subjects was 59.6% 
(95% CI: 34.2%, 75.2%) and against VCD leading to hospitalization 90.4% (95% CI: 56.4%, 97.9%). 
Year-by-year analyses showed continued VE in Year 4 post second vaccine dose for overall VCD (VE: 
64.1%; 95% CI: 37.4%, 79.4%) and VCD leading to hospitalization (VE: 94.0%; 95% CI: 52.2%,

Immunogenicity  
Geometric Mean Titres of Neutralizing Antibodies Against Dengue 
GMTs in the TDV group of Trial DEN-301 corresponding to month 1 following the first vaccine dose, and 
second vaccine dose as well to Month 15 are shown in Figure 31. The magnitude of the response was 
comparable for DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4, and was higher for DENV-2. 
Figure 31: Trial DEN-301: Geometric Mean Titers (95% Confidence Interval) of Neutralising 
Antibodies for Each Dengue Serotype After First Vaccination by Visit (Per-Protocol Set-
Immunogenicity Subset) 
Dengue Seropositivity Rates 
For baseline seronegative subjects, in the TDV group, seropositivity rates for each serotype increased 
from baseline to 90.5% to 98.6% at Month 1. Rates continued to increase to Month 4 (≥99.5%) and 
remained high through Month 15 (≥92.7%) and Month 27 (≥90.4%). At Month 1, multivalent 
seropositivity rates were 96.5% (at least trivalent) and 85.3% (tetravalent), peaked at Month 4 
(99.8% and 99.5%, respectively), and remained high at Month 27 (92.7% and 85.9%, respectively). 
In the placebo group, at Month 27, 16.5% of baseline seronegative subjects were seropositive against 
at least 1 dengue serotype and the at least trivalent and tetravalent seropositivity rates were 13.1% 
and 12.3%, respectively. 
For baseline seropositive subjects, in both the placebo and TDV groups, seropositivity rates for each 
serotype were high at baseline (87.4% to 97.2% across trial groups and serotypes). For the TDV 
group, rates had increased at Month 1 to ≥99.5% for each serotype and remained high remained high 
(≥99.2%) at all subsequent time points. Most subjects in the TDV group showed at least trivalent or 
tetravalent seropositivity at baseline (87.5% and 83.5%, respectively), which increased in the TDV 
group to 99.8% (at least trivalent) and 99.1% (tetravalent) by Month 1 and remained high throughout. 
Exploratory Immunogenicity Analyses Based on 36-Month Data 
At Month 39 (36 months post second vaccine dose), GMTs in the TDV group remained well above 
baseline with little change compared with the preceding time point at Month 27 for both baseline

seronegative subjects and baseline seropositive subjects. Similarly, there were little changes in 
seropositivity rates in the TDV group at Month 39 compared with Month 27 in both subgroups by 
baseline serostatus. At Month 39, the tetravalent seropositivity rate in the TDV group was 80.5% in 
baseline seronegative subjects and 98.4% in baseline seropositive subjects. 
Correlate of Protection 
In a descriptive approach to evaluate a potential correlate of protection, GMTs were compared between 
subjects who had VCD fever until end of Part 2 (18 months post second dose), referred to as “cases”, 
and those who did not have VCD fever, referred to as controls, overall and by baseline serostatus. The 
correlate of protection subset of the PPS used for the correlate of protection analyses included 
1404 subjects in the placebo group and 2603 subjects in the TDV group (see Table 45). 
In general, and as expected, GMTs for both cases and controls were higher in the TDV group than in 
the placebo group, for each serotype and irrespective of baseline serostatus. In both trial groups, GMTs 
were higher for DENV-2 compared with the other 3 dengue serotypes. Overall, for each serotype and in 
both trial groups, antibody titres at Month 4 were higher for controls, ie, subjects who had no VCD 
fever, than for cases, ie, subjects who had VCD fever (see Table 45), indicating a potential association 
between the neutralizing antibody titre and the efficacy outcome of preventing VCD fever. These 
differences between controls and cases were more pronounced in baseline seropositive subjects, while 
in baseline seronegative subjects, GMTs were similar or only marginally higher in controls compared 
with the cases. In general, there was considerable overlap in antibody titres between cases and 
controls, particularly in the seronegative group.

Table 45: Trial DEN-301: Geometric Mean Titres of Neutralizing Antibodies in Dengue Cases 
and Controls at Month 4 (Per-Protocol Set-Correlate of Protection Subset) 
In preliminary exploratory analyses, various statistical models were applied to evaluate whether the 
neutralizing antibody titre is a predictive factor for the VE observed. Results suggested that there could 
potentially be a correlate of protection for DENV-1, but not for DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4. TDV 
elicits a broad range of immune responses which may also contribute to protection from infection or 
severe disease. 
•  Ancillary analysis  
Summary of Immunogenicity Results From Other Studies Using the Final TDV Formulation 
In addition to pivotal phase 3 Trial DEN-301, 6 further trials, phase 3 Trials DEN-304 and DEN-315, 
co-administration phase 3 Trials DEN-305 and DEN-314, and phase 2 Trials DEN-313 and DEN-204 
provide immunogenicity data in support of TDV as vaccine for the prevention of dengue disease. 
Phase 3 Trial DEN-304 
Trial Design 
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial with 923 healthy subjects aged 
18 to 60 years, conducted in non-endemic regions of the United States to investigate lot-to-lot 
consistency of 3 consecutive TDV lots in terms of equivalence of the induced immunogenicity. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate the lot-to-lot consistency of 3 consecutive TDV lots in terms 
of equivalence of immune responses at 1 month post second dose.  
The secondary objectives pertaining to immunogenicity were: 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 145/254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
To describe the seropositivity (reciprocal neutralizing titre ≥10) rates for all dengue serotypes at 1 
month and 6 months post second TDV dose (ie, at Months 4 and 9 of the trial). 
• 
To describe the persistence of the immune response at 6 months post second dose of TDV or 
placebo in subjects who were seronegative for dengue at baseline. 
Subjects were randomised (2:2:2:1 ratio) to 1 of 4 trial groups to receive TDV (Groups 1 to 3 
corresponding to Lots 1-3) or placebo, administered at Month 0 and Month 3 via SC injection. A subset 
of subjects was randomly selected for the immunogenicity evaluation (immunogenicity subset). 
All subjects were followed-up for 6 months post second vaccine dose at Month 3 through Month 9. 
Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the GMT of neutralizing antibodies (by MNT50) for each of the 4 dengue 
serotypes at Month 4 in the immunogenicity subset. 
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints included (DEN-304 CSR, Section 9.5.3): 
• 
The seropositivity (defined as a reciprocal neutralizing titre ≥10) rates for each of the 4 dengue 
serotypes at Month 4 and Month 9. 
• 
The GMT of neutralizing antibodies (by MNT50) for each of the 4 dengue serotypes at Month 9. 
Statistical Methods 
Analyses were based on the PPS, which included all randomised subjects in the immunogenicity subset 
who received at least 1 dose of trial vaccine (TDV or placebo) and for whom a valid pre-dose and at 
least 1 valid post-dose blood sample was taken, and who had no major protocol violations.   
The primary endpoint analysis evaluated the lot-to-lot consistency at Month 4. For each serotype, an 
analysis of variance (ANOVA) model on the natural logarithms of titres of dengue neutralizing 
antibodies was fitted. The model included trial group as a factor, including data from subjects in 
Groups 1 to 3 (TDV vaccinated subjects) only; 95% CIs for the 3 pairwise comparisons were computed 
and equivalence of immune responses was established if the 95% CI for the ratio was contained 
between the equivalence margins of 0.5 and 2.0. Therefore, since TDV is a tetravalent vaccine, it 
necessitated 12 pairwise comparisons to establish lot-to-lot consistency, which was concluded if 
equivalence of immune responses was established for all pairwise comparisons. The equivalence 
margins were chosen to account for the variability inherent to both the live attenuated tetravalent 
vaccine TDV as well as the MNT50 assay used to determine immune response, and the variability 
inherent to individual subjects, as evidenced from immune response data in phase 1 and phase 2 TDV 
trials. 
For the secondary endpoint of seropositivity, the difference in proportions between trial groups was 
estimated for each dengue serotype at each applicable visit. 
Trial Results 
Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics 
A total of 923 subjects were randomised (placebo: 132 subjects; TDV Lot 1: 263 subjects; 
TDV Lot 2: 264 subjects; and TDV Lot 3: 264 subjects), and 615 subjects were included in the 
immunogenicity subset (placebo: 88 subjects; TDV Lot 1: 175 subjects; TDV Lot 2: 176 subjects; and

TDV Lot 3: 176 subjects). More than 86% of subjects in any group completed the trial. The PPS used 
for immunogenicity analyses included a total of 442 subjects (71.9% of the immunogenicity subset). 
Demographic and baseline characteristics were similar for all 4 groups. Overall, subjects had a mean 
age of 41.4 years, 45.9% were male, and 79.2% of subjects were white. Baseline seropositivity rates 
were relatively high for all trial groups (placebo: 16.7%; TDV Lot 1: 14.7%; TDV Lot 2: 13.8%; and 
TDV Lot 3: 16.3%), which was unexpected given the trial was based in a dengue non-endemic region 
where subjects are assumed to be predominantly dengue seronegative at baseline. 
Immunogenicity  
Lot-to-Lot Consistency 
Based on the PPS that only included subjects who were dengue seronegative at baseline, the 95% CI 
of the GMT ratios was within pre-specified equivalence margins of 0.5 and 2.0 for all pairwise 
comparisons for DENV-2 and DENV-3, and for 1 comparison each for DENV-1 (TDV Lots 2 vs 3) and 
DENV-4 (TDV Lots 1 vs 3). Therefore, lot-to-lot consistency in terms of equivalence of immune 
responses at 1 month post second vaccine dose (Month 4) could not be demonstrated statistically.

Geometric Mean Titres and Seropositivity Rates 
Overall, an increase in GMTs of neutralizing antibodies titres was observed between baseline and 
Month 4 for all serotypes across all TDV groups. Between Month 4 and Month 9, GMTs decreased for all 
serotypes for all 3 TDV lots but remained well above baseline values. GMTs were consistently higher 
for DENV-2 than for the other 3 serotypes. 
There were no relevant differences in seropositivity rates between the 3 TDV lots. At Month 4, the 
percentage of seropositive subjects in the PPS had risen from 0% to between 94.6% and 100% of 
subjects for each serotype in the TDV lots. 
Phase 3 Trial DEN-315  
Trial Design 
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial planned in 400 healthy 
adolescent subjects aged 12 to 17 years in a dengue non-endemic region of Mexico (Mexico City) with 
2 parallel groups to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of TDV.  
The primary objective was to describe the neutralizing antibody response against each dengue 
serotype at 1 month post second dose (Month 4) of TDV or placebo in adolescent subjects who were 
seronegative for dengue.  
The secondary objectives pertaining to immunogenicity were: 
-To describe the persistence of the immune response at 6 months post second dose (Month 9).  
-To describe the seropositivity (reciprocal neutralizing titre ≥10) rates for all dengue serotypes 
at 1 and 6 months post second dose. 
Subjects were randomised (3:1 ratio) to receive either TDV or placebo, administered at Month 0 and 
Month 3 via SC injection. All subjects were followed-up for 6 months post second dose, ie, up to 
Month 9. 
Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the GMT of neutralizing antibodies (by MNT50) for each of the 4 dengue 
serotypes at 1 month post second dose (Month 4).  
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints included: 
-GMTs of neutralizing antibodies (by MNT50) for each of the 4 dengue serotypes at 6 months 
post second dose (Month 9). 
-Seropositivity (defined as a reciprocal neutralizing titre ≥10) rates for each of the 4 dengue 
serotypes and for multiple (2, 3, or 4) dengue serotypes at 1 month and 6 months post second dose 
(Month 4 and Month 9, respectively). 
Statistical Methods 
Analyses were based on the PPS, which included all enrolled subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
TDV or placebo, for whom a valid pre-dose measurement and at least 1 valid post-dose measurement 
was available for immunogenicity evaluation, who were not seropositive to any dengue serotype at 
baseline, and who had no major protocol violations. 
Assessment report

For GMTs, descriptive statistics including 95% CIs were provided for each dengue serotype and for 
each applicable visit. Seropositivity rates were presented for each dengue serotype and multiple 
dengue serotypes, along with an exact 2-sided 95% CI based on the Clopper-Pearson method. 
Trial Results 
Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics 
A total of 400 subjects were randomised, 300 into the TDV group and 100 into the placebo group. Of 
these, 296 (98.7%) in the TDV group and 95 (95.0%) in the placebo group completed the trial. The 
PPS used for analyses of immunogenicity included 271 subjects (90.3%) in the TDV group and 82 
subjects (82.0%) in the placebo group. The most common reason for exclusion from the PPS was that 
the subject was seropositive to at least 1 dengue serotype at baseline, which affected 36 subjects in 
the TDV group and 12 in the placebo group.  
Demographic and baseline characteristics were well balanced between the TDV and placebo groups of 
the PPS. In both groups, the mean age was 14.3 years with an age range of 12 to 17 years. More than 
half of the subjects were female (57.6% in the TDV group and 52.4% in the placebo group). All 
subjects were of Hispanic or Latino ethnicity and of either American Indian/Alaska Native. As per the 
definition of the PPS, all subjects were dengue seronegative at baseline. 
Immunogenicity 
TDV was shown to be immunogenic in baseline dengue seronegative adolescents aged 12 to 17 years. 
GMTs of neutralizing antibodies (MNT50) had increased to 327.9 against DENV-1, 1742.5 against DENV-
2, 119.5 against DENV-3, and 142.7 against DENV-4 at 1 month post second dose of TDV (Month 4). 
Six months post second dose of TDV (Month 9), GMTs had decreased compared with Month 4 but 
remained well above baseline level with values of 134.7, 740.9, 45.8, and 37.5, respectively. 
At 1 month post second dose (Month 4), in the TDV group, the seropositivity rate increased from 0% 
at baseline to ≥99.6% for all serotypes. All subjects in the TDV group had at least trivalent 
seropositivity and almost all subjects (99.6%) had tetravalent seropositivity. At 6 months post second 
dose (Month 9), in the TDV group, the percentage of seropositive subjects was still high (≥89.4% 
across serotypes), with at least trivalent seropositivity reached by 94.5% of subjects and tetravalent 
seropositivity by 85.8% of subjects. 
Phase 3 Co-Administration 
The Applicant also performed 2 co-administration studies (DEN-305 and DEN-314) in nonendemic 
countries with Yellow fever and Hepatitis A vaccines with the intention to study the possible 
interactions of TDV vaccine with the most common vaccines used for travellers.  CHMP considers 
adequate the choice of these vaccines and that these studies will be included in the Marketing 
Authorisation application.  
Trial DEN-305 
Trial Design 
This was a phase 3, observer-blind, randomised, multicenter trial in 900 healthy adults aged 18 to 
60 years living in regions non-endemic for both dengue and YF, to investigate the immunogenicity and 
safety of TDV and a YF vaccine (YF-17D) administered concomitantly or sequentially. The trial was 
conducted in the United States. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

Subjects were randomised (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment groups:  
•  Group 1 (denoted as YF-17D/TDV/TDV): YF-17D vaccine + placebo concomitantly administered at 
Month 0, TDV administered at Months 3 and 6. 
•  Group 2 (denoted as TDV/TDV/YF-17D): first dose of TDV + placebo concomitantly administered at 
Month 0, second dose of TDV administered at Month 3, and YF-17D vaccine administered at 
Month 6. 
•  Group 3 (denoted as TDV + YF-17D/TDV/PBO): first dose of TDV + YF-17D vaccine concomitantly 
administered at Month 0, second dose of TDV administered at Month 3, and placebo administered 
at Month 6. 
All subjects were followed-up for 6 months post third vaccination at Month 6 through Month 12. 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the YF seroprotection rate response to 
1 dose of YF-17D vaccine, 1 month following concomitant administration of 1 dose of TDV, compared 
with placebo administered concomitantly with the YF-17D vaccine (Group 1 vs Group 3).  
The secondary objectives pertaining to immunogenicity were: 
• 
To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the GMT response to TDV for all dengue serotypes combined 
at 1 month post second dose of TDV following concomitant administration of the first dose of TDV 
with YF-17D vaccine or with placebo (Group 2 vs Group 3). 
• 
To demonstrate the non-inferiority of the GMT response to 1 dose of YF-17D vaccine 1 month 
following concomitant administration with 1 dose of TDV compared with placebo administered 
concomitantly with the YF-17D vaccine (Group 1 vs Group 3). 
• 
To describe seropositivity rates for all 4 dengue serotypes 1 month post second dose of TDV 
following concomitant administration of the first dose of TDV with YF-17D vaccine or placebo. 
• 
To describe the GMTs of neutralizing antibodies and the seropositivity rates for all 4 dengue 
serotypes 1 month post first dose of TDV administered concomitantly with YF-17D vaccine or 
placebo. 
• 
To describe the GMT and seroprotection rate response to YF-17D vaccine 1 month after sequential 
administration of a 2-dose regimen of TDV at Months 0 and 3, followed by YF-17D vaccine 3 
months later. 
• 
To describe the GMTs of neutralizing antibodies and the seropositivity rates for all 4 dengue 
serotypes, 1 month after sequential administration of YF-17D vaccine at Month 0, followed by a 2-
dose regimen of TDV 3 months later at Months 3 and 6. 
The trial was powered to meet the primary as well as the first 2 secondary objectives listed above. 
Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects YF and dengue naive at baseline who were 
seroprotected against YF at Month 1 as measured by PRNT. YF seroprotection was defined as reciprocal 
anti-YF neutralizing antibody titre ≥10. Immunological naivety to YF and dengue virus was defined as 
baseline reciprocal neutralizing antibody titres <10 for YF and for the 4 dengue serotypes. 
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints were: 
Assessment report

•  GMT of neutralizing antibodies (by MNT50) for each of the 4 dengue serotypes at pre-second and 
pre-third vaccine doses and 1 month post first, second, and third vaccine doses. 
•  GMTs of neutralizing anti-YF antibodies (by PRNT) at 1 month post first and third vaccine doses. 
•  Seropositivity rates for each of the 4 dengue serotypes at pre-second and pre-third vaccine doses 
and 1 month post first, second, and third vaccine doses. Seropositivity was defined as a reciprocal 
neutralizing antibody titre ≥10. 
•  Seropositivity rates for multiple dengue serotypes at pre-second and pre-third vaccine doses and 1 
month post first, second, and third vaccine doses. 
• 
Proportion of subjects YF and dengue naive at baseline who were seroprotected against YF at 
1 month post third vaccination (PRNT). 
Statistical Methods 
Analyses were based on the PPS which included subjects of the FAS (all randomised subjects who 
received at least 1 dose of the trial vaccine and for whom a valid pre-dose [baseline] and at least 
1 post-dose measurement were available for immunogenicity assessments) who had no major protocol 
violations. It was differentiated between the YF PPS for YF immunogenicity analyses and the PPS for 
TDV immunogenicity analyses. Per definition, all subjects in the YF PPS or PPS were not seroprotected 
against YF virus and were seronegative for any dengue serotype at baseline. 
As primary analysis, the non-inferiority of the immune response to the YF-17D vaccine when 
concomitantly administered with TDV (Group 3) compared with concomitant administration of the YF-
17D vaccine with placebo (Group 1) was assessed in terms of YF seroprotection rates at Month 1. Non-
inferiority was concluded if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the seroprotection rate difference 
(Group 1 minus Group 3) was less than the non-inferiority margin of 5% as requested by the US FDA. 
The non-inferiority of the immune response to TDV when concomitantly administered with YF-17D 
vaccine (Group 3) compared with concomitant administration of TDV with placebo (Group 2) was 
assessed in terms of the GMTs of neutralizing antibodies for all 4 dengue serotypes at Month 4. Non-
inferiority was concluded if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (Group 2/Group 3) was 
less than the non-inferiority margin of 2.0. The non-inferiority of the immune response to YF-17D 
when concomitantly administered with TDV (Group 3) compared with concomitant administration of 
YF-17D with placebo (Group 1) was assessed in terms of the GMTs of anti-YF neutralizing antibodies at 
Month 1. Non-inferiority was concluded if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio 
(Group 1/Group 3) was less than the non-inferiority margin of 2.0. This non-inferiority margin aligns 
with the equivalence margin used in Trial DEN-304. 
Trial Results 
Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics 
A total of 900 subjects were randomised, 300 subjects to each group. A total of 161 subjects (17.9%) 
discontinued the trial, with similar proportions across groups. The most frequent reason for trial 
discontinuation was loss to follow-up. Consequently, 739 of the 900 randomised subjects (82.1%) 
completed that trial. The YF PPS used for analyses of YF seroprotection rates and YF GMTs included 
715 subjects (79.4% of randomised subjects). The most common reasons for exclusion from the YF 
PPS were seropositivity to dengue virus at baseline (82 subjects) and seroprotection to YF virus at 
baseline (78 subjects). Analyses of dengue seropositivity rates and GMTs of neutralizing antibodies 
against dengue were based on the PPS, which included 589 subjects (65.4%) overall (192 subjects 
[64.0%] in Group 1, 208 [69.3%] in Group 2, 189 [63.0%] in Group 3). The most common reasons for 
exclusion from the PPS were not having received all 3 vaccinations (148 subjects [17.0% of the FAS]), 
Assessment report

seropositivity to dengue virus at baseline (84 [9.6%]), and seroprotection to YF virus at baseline (78 
[9.0%]). 
Overall, demographic and baseline characteristics for the YF PPS were well balanced across groups. 
The mean age was 41.9 years in Group 1, 40.0 years in Group 2, and 41.6 years in Group 3. The 
majority of subjects were female: 57.8% in Group 1, 58.4% in Group 2, and 60.8% in Group 3. There 
were more Black/African American subjects in Group 2 (34.5%) than in the other groups (25.6% and 
27.0%, respectively).  
Immunogenicity 
Yellow Fever Seroprotection Rates and Yellow Fever Geometric Mean Titres 
At Month 1, all but 1 subject in Group 1 (YF-17D/TDV/TDV) (99.5%) and all but 2 subjects in Group 3 
(TDV + YF-17D/TDV/PBO) (99.1%) had achieved YF seropositivity. The primary objective of 
demonstrating the non-inferiority between YF seroprotection rates was met with a 95% CI for the 
seroprotection rate difference of (-1.85%, 2.69%).  
Similarly, at Month 1, the YF GMT response in Group 3 (TDV + YF-17D/TDV/PBO) was non-inferior to 
that in Group 1 (YF-17D/TDV/TDV), with the upper bound of the 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio 
in MNT response being below the predefined non-inferiority margin of 2.0 (geometric mean ratio: 1.0; 
95% CI: 0.77, 1.26). 
At Month 6 (6 months after YF-17D vaccination in Group 1 and Group 3, a high YF seroprotection rate 
of ≥98.9% was seen in Groups 1 and 3, and the YF GMTs were 2712.2 and 1184.6, respectively. In 
Group 2 (TDV/TDV/YF-17D), where subjects had not yet received the YF-17D vaccination, the 
YF seroprotection rate was 12% and the YF GMT was close to the baseline level (6.0). At Month 7 (7 
months after YF-17D vaccination in Group 1 and Group 3 and 1 month after YF-17D vaccination in 
Group 2, YF seroprotection rates were ≥98.4% across groups, and YF GMTs were 2341.6 for Group 1, 
1089.1 for Group 3, and 3078.2 for Group 2. 
Geometric Mean Titres of Neutralizing Antibodies Against Dengue and Dengue Seropositivity Rates 
At Month 4 (30 days after the second dose of TDV in Group 2 and Group 3), the non-inferiority in TDV 
GMTs between Groups 2 and 3 was shown for DENV-2 (GMTs of 2616.1 in Group 2 vs 1947.7 in 
Group 3), DENV-3 (131.4 vs 104.5), and DENV-4 (111.8 vs 97.7). For DENV-1 (GMTs of 297.1 in 
Group 2 vs 182.6 in Group 3), the upper bound of the 95% CI for the GMT ratio (Group 2/Group 3) 
was 2.22 and thus above the predefined non-inferiority margin of 2.0. Therefore, non-inferiority of the 
TDV GMT response between Group 3 and Group 2 at Month 4 was demonstrated for DENV-2, DENV-3, 
and DENV-4, but not for DENV-1. 
At 1 month post first TDV dose (Month 4 for Group 1; Month 1 for Group 2 and Group 3), the 
seropositivity rate for at least 1 dengue serotype was 99.4% in Group 1, 99.0% in Group 2, and 96.2% 
in Group 3, and remained above 99% for the remainder of the trial. Seropositivity rates were generally 
highest for DENV-2 in all groups. Lowest seropositivity rates (<85%) post first TDV dose were seen in 
Group 2 (TDV/TDV/YF-17D) at Month 3 for DENV-3 and DENV-4 (84.6% each) and in Group 3 (TDV + 
YF-17D/TDV/PBO) at Month 1 for DENV-3 (80.5%) and DENV-4 (78.4%). 
At 1 month post first TDV dose (Month 4 for Group 1; Month 1 for Group 2 and Group 3), the at least 
trivalent seropositivity rate was 99.4% in Group 1, 91.7% in Group 2, and 81.6% in Group 3, and the 
tetravalent seropositivity rates were 98.9%, 79.3%, and 65.9%, respectively. In Group 1 
(YF-17D/TDV/TDV), these rates were at least 99% at subsequent time points. In Group 2 
(TDV/TDV/YF-17D) and Group 3 (TDV + YF-17D/TDV/PBO), rates were in the range of 75.5% to 
88.9% at Month 3 and at least 88% at Month 4 or later time points, ie, after subjects had received the 
second TDV dose.

Phase 3 Co-Administration Trial DEN-314 
Trial Design 
This was a phase 3, observer-blind, randomised trial in 900 healthy adult subjects aged 18 to 60 years 
living in regions non-endemic for both dengue and hepatitis A, to investigate the immunogenicity and 
safety of the co-administration of SC TDV and an intramuscular (IM) HAV vaccine. The trial was 
conducted in the United Kingdom. 
At trial entry, subjects had to be HAV-naive (no prior HAV infection or vaccination) as well as DENV-
naive, ie, seronegative for Hepatitis A and for dengue. 
Subjects were randomised (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment groups:  
•  Group 1 (denoted as HAV + placebo/placebo): HAV vaccine (IM) and placebo (SC) concomitantly 
administered at Month 0, placebo (SC) administered at Month 3. 
•  Group 2 (denoted as placebo + TDV/TDV): TDV (SC) and placebo (IM) concomitantly administered 
at Month 0, TDV (SC) administered at Month 3. 
•  Group 3 (denoted as HAV + TDV/TDV): TDV (SC) and HAV vaccine (IM) concomitantly 
administered at Month 0, TDV (SC) administered at Month 3. 
All subjects were followed-up for 6 months post second vaccine dose at Month 3 through Month 9.  
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of the immune response to 1 dose of HAV 
vaccine in HAV/DENV-naive subjects, 1 month following co-administration with 1 dose of TDV (Group 
3) compared with 1 dose of HAV vaccine co-administered with placebo (Group 1). 
The secondary objectives pertaining to immunogenicity were: 
-To describe the immune response to the HAV vaccine in HAV/DENV-naïve subjects 1 month 
following 1 dose of HAV vaccine co-administered with TDV (Group 3) or placebo (Group 1). 
-To describe the immune response to TDV in HAV/DENV-naive subjects 1 month following a second 
dose of TDV given 3 months after a first dose of TDV co-administered with HAV vaccine (Group 3) 
or placebo (Group 2). 
-To describe the immune response to TDV in HAV/DENV-naive subjects 1 month following a first 
dose of TDV co-administered with HAV vaccine (Group 3) or placebo (Group 2). 
Immunogenicity Endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the proportion of subjects HAV/DENV-naive at baseline who were 
seroprotected against HAV at Month 1 (seroprotection rate) in a subset of 120 subjects per group 
(immunogenicity subset).  
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints were: 
-The geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) of anti-HAV antibodies at Month 1 in subjects 
HAV/DENV-naive at baseline. 
-GMT of neutralizing antibodies (by MNT50) for each of the 4 dengue serotypes at Month 1 and 
Month 4 in subjects HAV/DENV-naive at baseline.

-The proportion of subjects HAV/DENV-naive at baseline who were seropositive for each of the 4 
dengue serotypes at Month 1 and Month 4 (seropositivity rate). 
Statistical Methods 
A subset of 360 subjects (120 in each group), the immunogenicity subset, was randomly selected for 
the immunogenicity analyses. Analyses were based on the PPS which included subjects of the FAS (all 
randomised subjects who received at least 1 dose of the trial vaccine and for whom a valid pre-dose 
[baseline] and at least 1 post-dose measurement were available for immunogenicity assessments) who 
had no major protocol violations. It was differentiated between the HAV-PPS for HAV immunogenicity 
analyses and the TDV-PPS for TDV immunogenicity analyses. 
Descriptive statistics including 95% CIs for the primary and secondary endpoints, including 
seroprotection or seropositivity rates and GMCs or GMTs, were computed by trial group and visit for 
subjects in the immunogenicity subset for all available assays at all relevant time points. The 95% CIs 
were calculated by the exact (Clopper-Pearson) method. 
The non-inferiority of the immune response to the HAV vaccine when co-administered with TDV, 
compared with its co-administration with placebo, was assessed in terms of seroprotection rates at 
Month 1. Non-inferiority of immunogenicity was concluded if the upper bound of the 95% CI for the 
seroprotection rate difference (Group 1 minus Group 3) was less than the non-inferiority margin of 
10%. A non-inferiority margin of 10% is commonly used and accepted in vaccine co-administration 
trials and was selected for this trial based on other similar co-administration trials with HAV vaccines. 
Trial Results 
Subject Disposition and Baseline Characteristics 
A total of 900 subjects were randomised, 300 subjects to each group. Of these, 897 subjects (99.7%) 
received at least 1 dose of trial vaccine and 778 subjects (86.7%) completed all trial visits. The 
immunogenicity subset included 359 subjects: 119 subjects in Group 1, 120 each in Groups 2 and 3. 
The HAV-PPS used for analyses of HAV seropositivity rates and HAV GMCs included 226 subjects 
(63.0% of the immunogenicity subset) overall (74 subjects [62.2%] in Group 1, 71 [59.2%] in 
Group 2, and 81 [67.5%] in Group 3). The most common reasons for exclusion from the HAV-PPS 
were seroprotection against HAV at baseline (95 subjects) and seropositivity to dengue virus at 
baseline (27 subjects). The TDV-PPS used for analyses of TDV seropositivity rates and TDV GMTs 
included 196 subjects (54.6%) overall (66 subjects [55.5%] in Group 1, 63 [52.5%] in Group 2, and 
67 [55.8%] in Group 3). The most common reason for exclusion from the TDV-PPS were 
seroprotection against HAV at baseline (97 [27.0% of the immunogenicity subset]), not having 
received both vaccine doses (37 [10.3%]), and seropositivity to dengue virus at baseline (27 [7.5%]).  
Overall, the demographic and baseline characteristics of the HAV-PPS (the primary analysis set) were 
in line with the safety set; the mean age was 34.8 years and 96.5% of subjects were white. There was 
however an unexpected imbalance for gender across the groups in the HAV-PPS that was not observed 
to this extent in the safety set, with a higher proportion of females in Group 2 (42.3%) compared with 
Group 1 (31.1%) and Group 3 (21.0%). The demographic and baseline characteristics for the TDV-PPS 
were similar to those in the HAV-PPS.

was met: in the primary analysis, the seroprotection rate difference (Group 1 minus Group 3) was -
1.68 and the associated 95% CI was (-8.91%, 4.28%). The upper bound was less than the pre-defined 
non-inferiority margin of 10%, demonstrating non-inferiority of the immune response following co-
administration of HAV + TDV/TDV (Group 1) versus administration of HAV + placebo/placebo 
(Group 3). 
Geometric Mean Titres of Neutralizing Antibodies Against Dengue and Dengue Seropositivity Rates 
For all 4 dengue serotypes, an increase in GMTs was seen at 1 month post first TDV dose, ie, at 
Month 1, in Group 2 (placebo + TDV/TDV) and Group 3 (HAV + TDV/TDV). Overall, GMTs were slightly 
higher in Group 3 (HAV + TDV/TDV) than in Group 2 (placebo + TDV/TDV). The highest GMTs were 
observed for DENV-2 (2897.9 for Group 2 and 3960.0 for Group 3); GMTs were 108.2 and 152.5, 
respectively, for DENV-1, 95.4 and 140.5, respectively, for DENV-3, and 74.3 and 142.1, respectively, 
for DENV-4. Post second TDV dose, ie, at Month 4, for both TDV groups, GMTs of dengue neutralizing 
antibodies for DENV-1 were higher compared with Month 1 (171.3 in Group 1, 173.7 in Group 2), 
whereas for the other 3 dengue serotypes they were slightly lower compared with Month 1 (DENV-2: 
2064.1 and 1764.3, respectively; DENV-3: 83.8 and 92.6, respectively; DENV-4: 56.1 and 81.4, 
respectively), but well above baseline levels. In Group 1 (HAV + placebo/placebo), where no TDV was 
administered, GMTs of neutralizing antibodies against dengue fever at Month 1 and Month 4 remained 
at baseline levels. 
At Month 1, seropositivity rates for individual dengue serotypes varied between 85.0% and 91.7% in 
Group 2 and between 90.8% and 96.9% in Group 3. The at least trivalent seropositivity rate at 
Month 1 was 90.0% in Group 2 and 95.4% in Group 3, and the tetravalent seropositivity rates were 
71.7% and 84.6%, respectively. At Month 4, 1 month post second TDV dose, seropositivity rates were 
consistently higher for all serotypes in both Group 2 (placebo + TDV/TDV) and Group 3 (HAV + 
TDV/TDV) compared with Month 1 (100% for DENV-1 and DENV-2 in both groups, >92% for DENV-3, 
and >96% for DENV-4), and the at least trivalent seropositivity rate was 98.2% in Group 2 (placebo + 
TDV/TDV) and 98.4% in Group 3 (HAV + TDV/TDV), and the tetravalent seropositivity rates were 
90.9% and 96.8%, respectively. In Group 1 (HAV + placebo/placebo), at both Month 1 and Month 4, 
none of the subjects were seropositive for at least 3 dengue serotypes. 
In summary, the primary objective of this trial was met, demonstrating that co-administration of the 
HAV vaccine with TDV does not have a negative impact on the immune response to the HAV vaccine.

Ancillary analyses- Immunogenicity Summary  
Trials Contributing to Immunogenicity 
Data in support of the immunogenicity of TDV in its final formulation are available from the pivotal 
phase 3 Trial DEN-301 and from the phase 3 and phase 2 trials that used the final clinical, lyophilized 
TDV formulation administered 3 months apart (DEN-304, DEN-315, DEN-305, DEN-314, DEN-313, and 
DEN-204). Trials conducted in endemic regions (DEN-301, DEN-313, and DEN-204) provide data for 
both baseline seropositive (reciprocal neutralizing titre ≥10 for at least 1 dengue serotype) subjects 
and baseline seronegative (reciprocal neutralizing titre <10 for all 4 dengue serotypes) subjects in the 
age group of 2 to 17 years. Trials conducted in non-endemic regions (DEN-304, DEN-315, and 
co-administration Trials DEN-305 and DEN-314) provide data for baseline seronegative subjects in the 
age groups of 12 to 17 years (DEN-315) and 18 to 60 years.  
In this section, immunogenicity results across all trials are summarized for the endemic region and the 
non-endemic region. For Trials DEN-305, DEN-314, and DEN-204, the data from those trial groups in

which TDV was administered 3 months apart (and without other concomitant vaccination) were used, 
ie, from Groups 2 in Trials DEN-305 and DEN-314 and from Group 1 of DEN-204. 
By far the most subjects were included in pivotal phase 3 Trial DEN-301, where 13,380 subjects were 
vaccinated with TDV, 12,704 of whom were included in the PPS used for efficacy analyses and 2518 in 
the PPS used for immunogenicity analyses. Immunogenicity was assessed in all these trials, mostly in 
a randomly selected subset of subjects: 3717 subjects in total, 2796 in the endemic region and 
921 subjects in the non-endemic region. 
Immunogenicity Assessment Criteria 
In each trial, vaccine immunogenicity endpoints included GMTs of neutralizing antibodies measured by 
dengue MNT resulting in a titre reduction of at least 50% (MNT50) for each dengue serotype and 
seropositivity rates for each of the 4 dengue serotypes and for multiple serotypes (eg, at least trivalent 
or tetravalent seropositivity). Seropositivity was defined as a reciprocal neutralizing titre (determined 
by MNT50) of ≥10 (for at least 1 dengue serotype), which is the lowest detectable level. Seropositivity 
rates in initially seronegative trial subjects were used to measure the proportion of responders to the 
vaccine, with tetravalent seropositivity providing a measure of response to all 4 dengue serotypes. For 
dengue fever, a seroprotective titre against dengue has not been established to date, but a titre of <10 
is unlikely to be protective against dengue. In each trial, immunogenicity endpoints were summarized 
using descriptive statistics. 
Immunogenicity Results 
Endemic Regions 
In general, the GMT profile of TDV administered in 2 doses 3 months apart was consistent between 
pivotal phase 3 Trial DEN-301 (subjects aged 4-16 years), phase 2 Trial DEN-313 (4-16 years), and 
phase 2 Trial DEN-204 (Trial Group 1; 2-17 years) conducted in endemic regions.  The results from 
trial DEN-301, as a representative example, are shown in Figure 32. In both baseline seronegative and 
seropositive subjects of pivotal phase 3 Trial DEN-301, a gradual decline in GMTs was observed for 
DENV-2 from Month 9 onwards, whereas for the other dengue serotypes, GMTs remained relatively 
constant.

Among baseline seronegative subjects in all 3 trials conducted in the endemic regions, after the second 
dose (administered at Month 3), rates were ≥97.6% across all serotypes, with the exception of DENV-
4 in Trial DEN-204 (88.1%). At later time points up to Month 27 in Trial DEN-301 and Month 48 in 
Trial DEN-204, seropositivity rates remained high (DEN-301: ≥90.4% for all dengue serotypes; 
DEN-204 [Group 1]: ≥89.2% for DENV-1, DENV-2, DENV-3; ≥78.0% for DENV-4). Tetravalent 
seropositivity rates at the evaluated time points after the second dose were high (99.5% in DEN-301 
and 98.7% in DEN-313 at Month 4 and 85.7% at Month 6 in DEN-204).  
Among baseline seropositive subjects, seropositivity rates for each dengue serotype were high already 
at baseline, increased at Month 1, and remained high at all subsequent time points.  
Non-Endemic Regions 
In general, the GMT profile of TDV administered in 2 doses 3 months apart was consistent across the 
trials conducted in non-endemic regions, ie, Trials DEN-304 (subjects aged 18-60 years), DEN-315 
(12-17 years), DEN-305 (Group 2; 18-60 years), and DEN-314 (Group 2; 18-60 years). 
In both trials DEN-304 and DEN-315 GMT titres had increased at Month 4 from levels below the limit of 
detection at baseline and had slightly decreased at Month 9 compared with Month 4 but remained well 
above baseline levels showing immune persistence of antibody response) (see Figure 33). 
The GMT profiles in these trials conducted in the non-endemic region were also similar to those seen in 
the baseline seronegative subjects of the trials conducted in the endemic region. 
Figure 33: Trials DEN-304 and DEN-315: Geometric Mean Titers (95% Confidence Interval) 
of Dengue Neutralising Antibody for Each Serotype (Per-Protocol Set) 
In general, seropositivity rates following the administration of TDV were consistent across the trials 
conducted in non-endemic regions (DEN-304 and DEN-315). The patterns of seropositivity rates over 
time seen in these trials were also similar to those seen in the baseline seronegative subjects of the 
trials conducted in the endemic region. 
In both Trials DEN-304 and DEN-315, at Month 4 (1 month post second vaccine dose), seropositivity 
rates had increased from baseline, mostly to levels well above 95%; tetravalent seropositivity was 
achieved in 95.6% of subjects in Trial DEN-304 and 99.6% in Trial DEN-315, demonstrating a high 
Assessment report

proportion of vaccine responders. At Month 9, seropositivity rates had slightly decreased compared 
with Month 4 but remained high, mostly above 90%. In Group 2 (TDV administered at Months 0 and 3) 
of Trials DEN-305 and DEN-314, at Month 4, 1 month post second TDV dose, seropositivity rates for 
individual dengue serotypes had increased to >92%. 
In all 4 trials, seropositivity rates were generally higher for DENV-1 and DENV-2 than for DENV-3 and 
DENV-4. 
Immunogenicity in Subgroups 
Because of its importance and size with 20,071 treated subjects, subgroup analyses of immunogenicity 
data were only planned and performed in pivotal Trial DEN-301, which was conducted in different 
regions with different epidemiological settings and where the number of subjects within each of the 
prespecified subgroups was large enough to allow for interpretable results.  
Results from subgroup analyses of immunogenicity by age group (4-5, 6-11, and 12-16 years) were 
dependent on the different proportions of baseline seropositive and seronegative subjects within each 
age group, as confirmed by exploratory analyses within each baseline serostatus subgroup that did not 
show any notable difference in GMTs or seropositivity rates between the 3 age groups. Results from 
the overall PPS showed that baseline GMTs were lowest in subjects aged 4 to 5 years and highest in 
those aged 12 to 16 years for each serotype, which is related to the lower proportion of seropositive 
subjects in the youngest subgroup (58.7%) compared with the older subgroups (68.9% and 83.7%, 
respectively). In each age group, the pattern over time was similar. 
Trends seen in subgroup analyses of GMTs and seropositivity rates by region (Asia Pacific region vs 
Latin America) or by country were similar to those described overall, indicating no relevant difference 
in immune response between these subgroups. Similarly, previous vaccination against YF or JE did not 
appear to have a marked effect on the GMT response or seropositivity rates.  
Immunobridging 
TDV is developed for the prevention of dengue disease caused by any dengue virus serotype in 
individuals 4 years and above. Pivotal Trial DEN-301 was conducted in subjects 4 to 16 years of age in 
endemic regions to allow for the inclusion of a reasonably large proportion of subjects who were 
seronegative at baseline, and for the collection of sufficient VCD cases for the various subgroup 
analyses. In endemic countries, the peak incidence of dengue fever tends to be in children and 
adolescents while the adult population tends to be pre-exposed to dengue. This limits the evaluation of 
VE particularly in a dengue naive adult population in a reasonably sized trial conducted in endemic 
regions. Therefore, the extension to the age range of >16 years is based on the available 
immunogenicity data through a prespecified immunobridging analysis. 
The primary analysis for this extension of age range compared the immune response data in baseline 
seronegative subjects between Trials DEN-301 (pediatric subjects aged 4-16 years, endemic region) 
and DEN-304 (adult subjects aged 18-60 years, non-endemic region; data from the 3 TDV groups, 
corresponding to the 3 TDV lots, were combined). From both trials, immunogenicity data at 1 and 
6 months post second vaccine dose, ie, at Months 4 and 9, were used. 
The scientific principle of the applied analysis was to demonstrate similar levels of immune response, in 
terms of neutralizing antibodies, elicited in both trial populations and thereby to conclude similar levels 
of expected protection.  
The analysis population for the primary immunobridging evaluation was restricted to baseline 
seronegative subjects to minimize the influence of confounding factors. Dengue exposure increases 
with age in endemic areas and is known to positively influence subsequent immune response, both in 
magnitude and quality. The use of baseline seronegative subjects for this analysis is considered 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 158/254 
 
 
 
 
appropriate because it ensures that the 2 populations, ie, subjects aged 4 to 16 years (DEN-301) and 
subjects aged 18 to 60 years (DEN-304), are comparable except for the age factor. Additionally, the 
group of baseline seronegative subjects also represents a population that is universal across all 
regions, and thus independent of endemicity. It is reasonable to assume that the efficacy in baseline 
seropositive subjects will be at least the same as that in baseline seronegative subjects. In Trial DEN-
301, the overall VE of TDV was shown to be similar between baseline seronegative and baseline 
seropositive subjects. 
The number of subjects from each of Trials DEN-301 and DEN-304 included in the PPS used for 
immunobridging analyses were as follows: 
-DEN-301 (4-16 years of age): 2518 subjects, of whom 1816 were seropositive and 
702 seronegative at baseline. 
-DEN-304 (18-60 years of age): 447 subjects, of whom 68 were seropositive and 379 seronegative 
at baseline. Overall, 109 subjects were 18 to 30 years, 153 subjects were 31 to 45 years, and 185 
subjects were 46 to 60 years of age. 
In the primary immunobridging analysis, differences in GMTs between the age range of 4 to 16 years 
(DEN-301) and the age range of 18 to 60 years (DEN-304) were estimated using an analysis of 
variance (ANOVA) model with natural logarithms of titres as a response variable and age group as 
factor. Non-inferiority was concluded for a given serotype if the upper bound of the respective 95% CI 
for the geometric mean ratio was below 2.0, which corresponds to the same criterion as was used for 
the lot-to-lot consistency Trial DEN-304. This margin was chosen to account for the variability inherent 
to both the live attenuated tetravalent vaccine TDV as well as the MNT50 assay to determine immune 
response.  
The non-inferiority criterion (upper bound of the 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio <2.0) for the 
comparison of GMTs at Month 4 was fulfilled for serotypes DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4, but 
marginally missed for DENV-3 with an upper bound of the associated 95% CI of 2.04 (see Table 47). 
Thus, overall non-inferiority, ie, in all 4 serotypes, could not be shown statistically in the primary 
immunobridging analysis of immunogenicity data at Month 4. At Month 9, however, the non-inferiority 
criterion was fulfilled for all 4 dengue serotypes, with upper bounds of the 95% CI for the geometric 
mean ratios not having exceeded 1.18.

Furthermore, similarity between the age groups of 4 to 16 years (DEN-301) and 18 to 60 years (DEN-
304) was shown in the reverse cumulative distribution curves of dengue neutralizing antibodies and 
the analysis of seropositivity rates with more than 95% of subjects having reached tetravalent 
seropositivity at Month 4, irrespective of age group.

Phase 3, double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled trial with 2 parallel 
groups conducted in 3 countries in Asia Pacific (Philippines, Sri Lanka, and 
Thailand) and 5 countries in Latin America (Brazil, Colombia, Dominican 
Republic, Nicaragua, and Panama). 
All subjects were randomised to receive two doses, 3 months apart, of either 
Takeda’s tetravalent dengue vaccine candidate (TDV) or 0.9% normal saline 
placebo in a 2:1 ratio and a subgroup of subjects is to receive a booster dose 
according to the same randomisation for the first two doses. The planned 
sample size was 20,100 subjects (13,400 TDV:6700 placebo). Randomisation 
was stratified by region (Asia Pacific and Latin America) and age range 
(4-5 years, 6-11 years, and 12-16 years). 
The trial includes 5 time periods (Parts 1, 2, and 3 for all subjects and Parts 4 
and 5 for subjects participating in the booster phase) for surveillance of febrile 
illness with potential dengue etiology. 
Part 1 (completed) consisted of active surveillance until 120 dengue cases had 
been confirmed and a minimum duration of 12 months follow-up post-second 
vaccination had been completed. 
Part 2 (completed) consisted of an additional 6 months of active surveillance 
following completion of Part 1. 
Virologically confirmed cases of dengue fever (VCD) in Part 1 counted towards 
the primary efficacy objective, and VCD in Parts 1 and 2 contributed towards 
the secondary efficacy objectives. 
Part 3 is ongoing and consists of modified active surveillance, lasting 
approximately 3 years after completion of Part 2. 
Part 4 is planned and consists of modified active surveillance for 13 months 
following a booster dose of TDV or placebo (only in subjects from the per 
protocol set who were aged 4 to 11 years at the time of randomisation in 
Part 1).

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Pivotal Phase 3 trial DEN-301 
Design and conduct  
Trial (DEN-301) was developed in two regions (Asia Pacific and Latin America). Results based on 
efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety data up to 24 months post second vaccine dose were initially

submitted and they are summarised in detail for this submission. Moreover, data up to 54 months post 
second vaccine dose became available during assessment of this vaccine application and the results 
are also described.  
Study DEN-301 is a Phase III, Double-Blind, Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Trial to investigate the 
efficacy, safety and immunogenicity of a Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine (TDV) administered 
subcutaneously in healthy children aged 4–16 years old. The trial is conducted in 3 countries of the 
Asia Pacific region (The Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Thailand) and in 5 countries of Latin America 
(Brazil, Colombia, The Dominican Republic, Nicaragua, and Panama). It is considered adequate to have 
chosen two different regions with 8 different countries to run this trial since this approach should allow 
getting an overall picture of vaccine efficacy against dengue disease, considering the varying and 
unpredictable epidemiology (in terms of attack rates and circulating Dengue serotypes) in different 
countries and regions. 
Eligible subjects aged 4 to 16 years were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either TDV or placebo 
(normal saline for injection) by a subcutaneous (SC) injection into the upper arm (planned number of 
subjects: 13,400 TDV; 6700 placebo). It is agreed with the Applicant to have recruited subjects in the 
age range of 4 to 16 based on the epidemiology of dengue in the endemic Asia Pacific and Latin 
American countries. This approach allowed including sufficient subjects who were seronegative at 
baseline to allow an analysis of VE by serostatus. Moreover, it was anticipated that this population 
would include a relevant number of subjects who had passed only one dengue infection. This is 
considered adequate as to assess vaccine efficacy since symptomatic dengue is most common during a 
second dengue infection.   
The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the efficacy of 2 doses of TDV in preventing 
symptomatic dengue fever of any severity and caused by any of the 4 dengue virus serotypes that 
occurred at least 30 days post-second vaccination. The key secondary objective of the trial was to 
assess the efficacy of TDV in preventing hospitalization due to VCD fever. These two objectives were 
endorsed in the CHMP scientific advice. It was noted in the advice that it would have been unfeasible to 
ask for demonstrating VE against every serotype due to the varying and unpredictable epidemiology of 
dengue virus.   
The trial comprises 5 consecutive trial parts: Part 1 was the primary analysis period, a 15-month 
period lasting until 12 months post second dose and included the primary efficacy analysis. This part 
started on the day of vaccination and ended once both of the following 2 criteria had been fulfilled: i) 
120 cases of confirmed dengue fever; ii) minimum duration of subject follow-up of 12 months post-
second vaccination. Part 2 was a 6-month period lasting until 18 months post second dose, at the end 
of which the secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed. Part 3 is a 2.5- to 3-year period for the 
assessment of long-term efficacy and safety; and Parts 4 and 5 comprise the booster phase of at least 
25 months for the assessment of the efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety following an additional 
placebo or TDV booster dose administered 48 to 54 months (4-4.5 years) after the second vaccine 
dose. The trial protocol, which initially included Parts 1 to 3 only, has been amended to introduce a 
booster phase comprising Parts 4 and 5. The design of parts 1, 2 and 3 were agreed by CHMP in two 
scientific advices. The duration of Part 3 is considered long enough to detect the possibility that in the 
long term, vaccination could induce the undesirable effect of more severe cases in vaccinated subjects 
as compared to non-vaccinated ones, as it has been observed in young baseline seronegative children 
that received the already licensed dengue vaccine (Hadinegoro et al, New Engl J Med. 2015;373 
(13):1195-206). Parts 4 and 5 were not previously discussed by CHMP in scientific advice. In fact, as 
detailed in this report, parts 4 and 5, that would assess the impact of the administration of an 
additional booster dose, have been included after detecting that VE wanes (especially for some 
serotypes) two years after vaccination.

At baseline, blood samples were taken from all subjects to determine the dengue serostatus. During 
Parts 1 and 2, active surveillance (subjects/guardians were contacted at least weekly) was applied. 
Any subject with febrile illness (defined as fever ≥38°C on any 2 of 3 consecutive days) was asked to 
return to the site for dengue fever evaluation by the investigator. Febrile episodes were confirmed 
virologically by dengue detection RT-PCR to detect specific serotypes. During Part 3 and the booster 
phase (Parts 4 and 5), modified active surveillance is applied to detect dengue cases of any severity in 
a tiered approach based on the need for hospitalization. The active surveillance was modified for 
Parts 3 to 5 to enable detection of symptomatic dengue. Subjects presenting with febrile illness not 
requiring hospitalization are to be screened for dengue disease (by RT-PCR) unless there is an 
alternative laboratory confirmed etiology (note: only occasionally an acute sample for RT-PCR was not 
taken because of an alternative laboratory confirmed diagnosis). The principal difference between the 
surveillance methods is that clinical chemistry, hematology, and dengue serology in acute or 
convalescent samples are not mandated by the protocol during Parts 3 to 5 unless the subject requires 
hospitalization.  
Parts 1, 2, and 3, have been completed; the remainder of the trial is still ongoing. Efficacy data up to 
24 months post second vaccine dose are discussed in this MAA, and in addition, recent data up to 54 
months post second vaccine dose are also discussed. It is noted that results of part 4 and 5 of the 
study (as amended to incorporate a booster doses) are not provided in this MAA. 
The Applicant detailed that for the first 18 months of Part 3 in only 3 of the 9792 febrile illness cases a 
sample for RT-PCR confirmation was not collected. Therefore, this situation had a negligible impact on 
the VE estimate for this part of the trial.  
The clinical trial vaccine material used for the two doses (at Month 0 and Month 3) was intentionally 
formulated at a lower potency than that intended for commercial lots as to demonstrate clinical 
effectiveness of TDV at or near the predicted end of shelf-life of TDV.  This approach was endorsed by 
CHMP in a scientific advice.  
Subjects presenting with febrile illness (defined as temperature ≥38°C on any 2 of 3 consecutive days) 
or clinically suspected dengue during the dry-run, Parts 1 and 2 or requiring hospitalization during 
Parts 3, 4, or 5 had/will have 2 blood samples taken to confirm dengue infection (the first or acute 
blood sample was taken during the acute phase of the disease -preferably within 5 days after the onset 
of fever- and the second or convalescent blood sample was taken 7-14 days after the acute sample. 
These samples were tested for analysis of dengue IgM and IgG (by ELISA), dengue NS1 antigen ELISA, 
dengue detection RT-PCR, haematocrit, platelet count, and liver function tests (LFTs [aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT)]). In addition to blood tests, clinical 
evaluation was performed for signs of haemorrhage or plasma leakage as well as any other abnormal 
signs or symptoms. The Applicant states that “each local laboratory provided their reference ranges to 
the Sponsor and centralized laboratory analyses were performed in validated laboratories designated 
by the Sponsor”.  The efficacy objectives and endpoints are agreed upon.  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was determining VE in preventing hospitalizations due to VCD 
fever by any dengue serotype. Upon request the Applicant clarified that hospitalization criteria were 
not stipulated in the protocol of Trial DEN-301, due to operational difficulty to implement criteria in the 
absence of universally accepted hospitalization criteria in the setting of a global trial in 8 countries 
across 26 sites.  
The Applicant has provided the clinical criteria to adjudicate a dengue case as severe, and a Dengue 
Case Adjudication Committee (DCAC) evaluated the severity of dengue cases. This approach is 
endorsed.

It is considered adequate to stratify by region (Asia Pacific and Latin America) and age range (children 
aged 4-5 years, 6-11 years, and 12-16 years) to ensure that each age range had the appropriate ratio 
of TDV to placebo in each region. The Applicant states that “recruitment followed an enrolment plan to 
ensure representative enrolment across the age ranges and regions”, and upon request, it was clarified 
that the planned and actual enrolment is very similar.  
The population sets defined for efficacy analysis are considered adequate. The primary analysis of VE 
was to be made after the 2 criteria for the end of Part 1 had been fulfilled, ie: (1) at least 120 cases of 
VCD fever were accrued, and (2) the minimum duration of subject follow-up was at least 12 months 
post-second vaccination. The primary analysis method was based on a Cox proportional hazard model 
with trial vaccine as a factor, adjusted for age and stratified by region in the PPS. The analysis 
reported in the study report is conform with the analysis planned in the protocol and SAP. Multiplicity 
adjustment over the primary and key secondary endpoint using a hierarchical approach is endorsed. 
Further exploratory secondary endpoints were not controlled for multiplicity, which is considered 
acceptable. The adjustment for age and stratification for region in the primary analysis is considered 
acceptable. As agreed by CHMP in the letter of advice, the primary efficacy objective was considered to 
have been met if the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the VE was above 25%. VE was calculated 
from the HR obtained from the Cox model.  
The statistical methods are generally acceptable. There were some issues which needed further 
clarification, such as inconsistencies in the time of collection for the primary endpoint (part 1), 
unblinding and some methodological details on the randomisation procedures. These aspects were 
resolved on the assessment of the applicant’s responses. It is noted that the protocol and study report 
mention the existence of a DMC Charter containing information on the adjudication of adverse events 
and severity of dengue cases, which has been submitted on request. Moreover, the applicant has 
provided additional information regarding handling of missing data, dropouts/withdrawals, and other 
intercurrent events with respect to the primary and key secondary endpoints.  
The applicant has planned and initiated a part 4 and 5 of the study to evaluate the effect of a booster 
dose. An interim CSR (end of Part 4) is expected for Q4 2024, and the Final Report (Final CSR Parts 1, 
2, 3, 4 and 5) for Q1 2026. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The trial initiation date was 26 April 2016 and the data lock points were 15 November 2018 (Part 1), 1 
April 2019 (Part 2), 25 October 2019 (12 months after end of Part 1), and 5 October 2020 (18 months 
after end of Part 2), 21 March 2022 (end of Part 3). 
Overall, as planned, the 2:1 ratio for TDV: placebo was achieved (13,401:6698) and this ratio was also 
maintained in each age group and region as planned, although it varied slightly by age group. In 
general, there was good compliance in completing parts 1 and 2 of the trial since 97.4%, 96.9%, and 
96.3% of subjects completed Part 1, Part 2, and until 12 months after end of Part 1, respectively. It is 
noted that discontinuations were equally distributed between TDV and Control groups. In total 6573 
(placebo) and 13,164 (TDV) subjects received two vaccinations; 6519 (placebo), 13,033 (TDV) 
subjects completed Part 1; and 6487 (placebo) and 12,961 (TDV) subjects completed Part 2. Protocol 
deviations were also limited (7,4%) and with similar frequency in both TDV and the control group. The 
most common significant protocol deviations were study procedures and assessments, which therefore 
do not question the reliability of the trial.  
There were no important differences in demographic data between the placebo and TDV groups. 
Overall, the mean age was 9.6 years; with most of the subjects being between 6 to 11 years (12.7% 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 167/254 
 
 
 
 
 
of subjects were aged 4 to 5 years, 55.2% were aged 6 to 11 years, and 32.1% were aged 12 to 16 
years).  
According to Baseline Dengue serostatus, 27.7% of subjects were seronegative (ie, seronegative 
against all 4 dengue serotypes) and 72.3% seropositive (ie, at least for one dengue serotypes) at 
baseline, with similar proportions per trial group. As expected, the proportion of baseline seropositive 
subjects was lower in subjects aged 4 to 5 years (58.7%) compared with those aged 6 to 11 years 
(68.9%) or 12 to 16 years (83.7%). As anticipated, considering the varying epidemiology of dengue 
virus, the proportions by baseline serostatus also varied by country. The history of prior vaccinations 
against JE or YF varied by region since prior vaccination against JE only occurred in the Asia Pacific 
region (where subjects are routinely vaccinated against JE) and prior vaccination against YF only 
occurred in Latin America. 
The Applicant did not determine the baseline serostatus regarding the closely related flavivirus Zika 
virus. Hence, the importance of such analysis was questioned since a recent publication (Katzelnick eta 
al, Science 369, 1123-1128 (2020) indicates that a previous Zika virus infection enhances future risk 
of severe dengue disease. The Applicant has adequately indicated several limitations of the paper by 
Katzelnick et al, which questions the conclusions reached that indeed, a previous Zika infection may 
enhance dengue disease.   
Importantly, 94.6% (19,021) of the randomised subjects were included in the PPS. Similarly, as 
planned, 4000 subjects (19.9%) were included in the immunogenicity subset and 98.9% (3954 
subjects) were included in the safety set of immunogenicity. 
Overall, from the first vaccination to the end of Part 2, acute samples were taken for 98.4% of febrile 
illness cases, and within 5 days for 93.6% of cases. The overall incidence of samples taken was similar 
in Asia Pacific (99.5%) and Latin America (97.1%), although the percentage taken within 5 days was 
higher in Asia Pacific (98.5%) than Latin America (88.0%). Percentages of samples taken from febrile 
illness cases were similar for TDV and placebo. These figures provide confidence on the results 
obtained from the vaccine efficacy analysis since acute sample were taken from practically all (around 
98%) febrile illness cases, mostly during within five days (90%) as stated in the clinical trial protocol.  
As expected from the varying dengue epidemiology, the incidence of VCD cases and the circulating 
dengue serotypes varied across regions and countries. In fact, a total of 390 cases were confirmed by 
serotype-specific RT-PCR to be VCD fever from first dose to 18 months post second vaccine dose 
(Parts 1 and 2 combined) and a higher proportion of VCD cases was observed in the Asia Pacific region 
(307/390 cases [78.7%]) than in Latin America (83/390 cases [21.3%]). Moreover, the serotype 
distribution for VCD fever cases in the placebo group, ie, unaffected by active vaccine administration, 
from the first placebo dose to 18 months post second placebo dose shows that DEN-2 caused 42.1 % 
of the cases followed by DEN-1 (30.1%), DEN-3 (25.1%) and DEN-4 (2.7%) was poorly represented 
among cases in the placebo group.  
Primary endpoint 
The primary objective to show efficacy in the prevention of VCD fever caused by any serotype (ie, all 4 
serotypes combined) from 30 days to 12 months post second vaccine dose (until the end of Part 1; 
primary endpoint) was met since the pre-established criterion (the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI 
for the VE was above 25%) was fulfilled. In fact, VE was 80.2% (95% CI: 73.3%, 85.3%; p<0.001). 
Three sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were performed (analysis using exact 95% CIs 
calculated as described by Breslow & Day on the PPS; analysis based on the FAS, and analysis in which 
cases of VCD fever were observed at any time post-second vaccination), and they supported the 
results from the primary analysis since the VE estimates determined were very close to that 
determined for the primary analysis. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 168/254 
 
 
 
 
The cumulative incidence of VCD fever shows a steady increase in the cumulative incidence in both 
groups, with a steeper slope in the placebo group and the separation between curves starting during 
the first month. It is noted that the curve of the TDV group is almost horizontal after one month of first 
dose (due to the accumulation of very few cases), and thus the presumed additional protection 
conferred by the second dose cannot be observed. It is also noted that the slope of the TDV group 
changes around month 9 suggesting that VE wanes from this time point onwards. 
Key secondary endpoint 
VE against the key secondary endpoint (Hospitalization due to Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever 
From 30 Days to 18 Months Post Second Vaccine Dose) was very high:  90.4% (95% CI: 82.6%, 
94.7%; p<0.001). The lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the VE was above 0%, and thus the 
criterion to meet this key secondary objective was fulfilled. Secondary infections by a Dengue serotype 
different from that of the first infection are those with higher severity and that course with high rates 
of hospitalization. Thus, prevention of hospitalization is a very relevant clinical endpoint. 
However, the high VE determined for prevention of hospitalized VCD is questioned as representative of 
the true VE for all four dengue serotypes. As stated by the Applicant, the hospitalization criteria were 
not stipulated in the protocol of Trial DEN-301, due to operational difficulty to implement criteria in the 
absence of universally accepted hospitalization criteria in the setting of a global trial in 8 countries 
across 26 sites. Thus, as it would have been expected the percent of hospitalized VCD Cases Among 
VCD Cases up to 18 months after the end of part 2 was very high in Sri Lanka (68%) as compared to 
the other 7 countries where the trial was developed (2.5 - 37%). In the placebo group data for 30 days 
post second dose to end of Part 2, Sri Lanka contributed with 44 hospitalized cases (66.6 % of total 
hospitalised cases), and it is noted that 41 of these 44 cases are due to DENV-2 and that VE against 
VCD fever was highest (95.1%) against DENV-2. Hence, the major contributor to the VE determined 
against hospitalized VCD are prevention of DENV-2 cases derived from only one country (Sri Lanka) 
and thus this does not necessarily reflect VE against the other Dengue serotypes. 
It is also noted that in trial DEN-301, VE against hospitalized VCD caused by DENV-3 was negative 
[VE: -51 (-1356; 84)] in dengue seronegative subjects at baseline when analysed from 30 days to 18 
months post second vaccination (further discussed below).  The Applicant provided analyses including 
and excluding Sri Lanka data. The VE estimates for the key secondary endpoint (prevention of 
hospitalized cases) were 90.4% (95%CI: 82 – 94) including Sri Lanka data, and 73.4% (46.3 -86.8%) 
excluding the data from this country.  
Secondary endpoints  
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From 30 Days to 18 Months Post Second Vaccine Dose, Overall 
and by Serostatus. VE in preventing VCD fever caused by any serotype (ie, all 4 serotypes combined) 
decreased slightly from 80.2% (95% CI: 73.3%, 85.3%) determined at 12 months post second dose 
(primary endpoint) to 73.3% (95% CI: 66.5%, 78.8%) when the period of observation was extended 
by 6 additional months (18 months post second vaccine dose). Similar high VE was observed in 
subgroups by baseline serostatus, although it was slightly lower in baseline seronegative subjects as 
compared to baseline seropositive ones. In fact, VE in baseline seropositive subjects was 76.1% (95% 
CI: 68.5%, 81.9%) and in baseline seronegative subjects was 66.2% (95% CI: 49.1%, 77.5%). 
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever Caused by Each Individual Serotype From 30 Days to 18 Months 
Post Second Vaccine Dose. When assessing VE against VCD fever from 30 days to 18 months post 
second vaccine dose, there were varying VE of TDV against each individual dengue serotype. The 
highest VE was shown for DENV-2 (95.1%; 95% CI: 89.9%, 97.6%), and then for DENV-1 (VE of 
69.8%; 95% CI: 54.8%, 79.9%), and DENV-3 (48.9%; 95% CI: 27.2%, 64.1%). The VE against VCD 
fever caused by DENV-4 was inconclusive (51.0% (95% CI: -69.4%, 85.8%) due to the lower 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 169/254 
 
 
 
 
incidence rates of cases due to this serotype. The high VE shown against DENV-2 is in line with the 
highest immune response (in terms of neutralizing antibodies) being raised against this same serotype 
in vaccinated subjects. This result is also in accordance with previous studies indicating a positive trend 
between neutralizing antibody titres and protection against clinical disease.  
Severe Forms of Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From 30 Days to 18 Months Post Second 
Vaccine Dose. There were only three cases that were adjudicated as severe by the DCAC whereas 
there were 9 cases meeting the DHF definition (7 in the placebo and 2 in the TDV group), and only one 
of the DHF cases was considered a severe case by DCAC. VE could not be demonstrated for DCAC-
defined severe VCD fever due to the few numbers of cases. It is noted that DHF cases were 
determined using a programmed algorithm without applying medical judgment. On the other hand, the 
efficacy of TDV against DHF from 30 days to 18 months post second vaccine dose was shown with an 
associated VE of 85.9% (95% CI: 31.9%, 97.1%).  The Applicant provided details on case definitions 
for DHF and DCAC-defined severe case. The difference between rate of hospitalization and severe 
forms of dengue observed in DEN-301 trial was adequately addressed.  References to published data 
from different sources are in line with the observed differences between hospitalized VCD, DHF as per 
the WHO 1997 criteria, and DCAC-defined severe dengue in Trial DEN-301. 
Exploratory Efficacy Analyses  
It is noted that these exploratory analyses have not been powered to draw any confirmatory 
conclusions, and results are descriptive only. Moreover, in several sub-analyses sample sizes and 
incidence rates became small, often precluding any robust conclusions due to the limited data.  
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From 30 Days to 24 Months Post Second Vaccine Dose. In terms 
of VE against VCD fever from 30 days to 24 months there was a slight decrease from 73.3% (95% CI: 
66.5%, 78.8%) determined up to 18 months as compared to 70.2% 95% CI: 63.7%, 75.6%) up to 24 
months. The same pattern is observed in both baseline seropositive and seronegative subjects and a 
similar conclusion was reached when the analysis was done in relation to preventing VCD leading to 
hospitalization and in preventing DHF (VE: 81.4%; 95% CI: 30.0%, 95.1%). 
An additional exploratory subgroup analysis estimated VE against VCD fever according to each dengue 
serotype by baseline serostatus. VE was found to be similar between baseline seropositive and 
seronegative subjects for both DENV-1 (66% and 63%) and DENV-2 (89% and 94%). The efficacy of 
TDV was also seen for VCD fever caused by DENV-3 in baseline seropositive subjects (62%). For the 
rest of the subgroups (DENV-4 baseline seropositive subjects; and DENV-3 and DENV-4 seronegative 
subjects) no conclusive evidence of VE was shown, since in all cases the 95% CI of the VE figures 
crossed zero. There were very few cases caused by DEN-4 (7 cases in the placebo and 5 cases in the 
TDV group) so that calculation of VE for this subgroup yielded inconclusive results. When analyzing the 
VCD fever cases caused by DENV-3 in baseline seronegative subjects, there was a higher incidence of 
cases in the TDV (23/3531) than in the placebo (9/1726) group, and thus the VE determined was -
29.0 (-178, 40.3). Although this negative VE figure cannot be taken as a robust result given the wide 
CI, it is worrisome since it indicates that TDV induces more cases of VCD fever than those that would 
occur in the absence of vaccination.  
These observations made in the previous paragraph are also reflected in the incidence cumulative 
curves according to Dengue serotype and baseline serostatus. For cases caused by DENV-1 and DENV-
2 the same overall pattern was observed, showing that both for placebo and TDV groups, higher VE 
was seen for seropositive than for seronegative subjects during the time period of analysis. It is also 
noted that VE against DENV-1 wanes faster than against DENV-2 since the curve for TDV starts 
converging with the placebo curve at a faster rate. In relation to DENV-3 it is clearly seen that the 
curve corresponding to placebo seronegative individuals accumulates less cases than the TDV 
seronegative ones over the whole period analysed, thus suggesting a negative effect of TDV in 
Assessment report

seronegative subjects over the whole period of time analysed. The Applicant has now incorporated data 
in the SmPC describing VE along time. 
The same situation is observed when VE against VCD leading to hospitalization was calculated by 
dengue serotype and by baseline serostatus. The highest VE observed for hospitalization was against 
cases caused by DENV-2 (100%) since there were no hospitalized cases in the TDV group (for both 
seropositive and seronegative subjects) vs 17 cases in placebo seronegative subjects and 33 in placebo 
seropositive individuals. Positive VE estimates were observed for hospitalized cases due to DENV-1 
(seropositive and seronegative) and DENV-3 (seropositive) but with very wide CI intervals for DENV-1 
seronegative (LL of 95%CI: 1.5%) and DENV-3 seropositive (LL of 95%CI: 5.9%) to conclude on a 
clear VE in these two cases. Again, although it was not statistically significant, it was worrying to 
observe negative vaccine efficacy estimate of -101% (-1706, 77) for hospitalizations due to VCD fever 
caused by DENV-3 in baseline seronegative subjects (there was 1 case in the placebo group and 4 
cases in the TDV group). There was only one case of VCD caused by DENV-4 that led to hospitalization 
(in a baseline seropositive subject in the placebo group), so no conclusion could be reached on 
prevention of hospitalization caused by this dengue serotype.  
In conclusion, analyses from data from 30 days up to 24 months post second vaccine dose, showed 
robust evidence of VE against VCD leading to hospitalization only against cases due to DENV-2 (both 
seropositive and seronegative), and evidence of a significant VE (i.e, LL of 95%CI >20%) was obtained 
only for cases due to DENV-1 (seropositive at baseline). A worrying observation was the negative VE 
estimate (non statistically significant) for DENV-3 baseline seronegative subjects.  
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From 30 Days to 12 Months (Year 1) and From 13 to 24 Months 
(Year 2) Post Second Vaccine Dose. Compared with Year 1, a decline in efficacy of TDV was observed 
during Year 2. The VE for overall VCD decreased from 80.2% (95% CI: 73.3%, 85.3%) in Year 1 to 
56.2% (95% CI: 42.3%, 66.8%) in Year 2. To some extent, a factor contributing to these changes 
between Year 1 and Year 2 was the varying serotype distribution across the VCD cases in the 
respective time period and the fact that the VE against each serotype was different.  A decline was 
observed against each of the serotypes, both in seronegative and seropositive subjects although the 
extent of the decline was not uniform against each of the 4 dengue serotypes. 
A similar trend was observed for VCD fever leading to hospitalization, with lower VE in year 2 (VE: 
76.1%; 95% CI: 50.8%, 88.4%) as compared to year 1 (VE: 95.4%; 95% CI: 88.4%, 98.2%). 
Subgroup analyses of VCD leading to hospitalization by baseline serostatus showed VE decreasing both 
in the baseline seropositive and seronegative subjects. Incidences of severe forms of dengue were low, 
both during Year 1 (DCAC-defined VCD: 1 case per intervention arm; DHF: 4 cases in the placebo 
group vs 1 case in the TDV group) and Year 2 (DCAC-defined VCD: 1 case per intervention arm; DHF: 
4 vs 2 cases), with associated VE estimates of >50% in both periods. With all the limitations due to the 
limited number of hospitalized VCD cases in Year 2, these data do not indicate a clear trend towards 
increased number of hospitalized/severe/DHF cases in seronegative subjects in the second year as 
compared to the first one. 
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From First Vaccine Dose Onwards. VE against VCD fever of 
81.1% (95% CI: 64.1%, 90.0%) was determined during the 3 months between the first and second 
vaccine dose. This is indicative of a rapid onset of the effect of TDV from the first vaccine dose 
onwards. A similar trend is observed for VCD cases reported between the first and second vaccine dose 
leading to hospitalization (6 in the placebo group and 2 in the TDV group) during this 3-month period. 
Therefore, these results do not indicate that the first dose, - due to raising a low immune response -, 
could predispose the recipients to a more severe dengue disease. 
Characteristics of Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever Based on Clinical Signs, Symptoms, and 
Laboratory Data. Overall, a trend for of more severe clinical signs were observed in the placebo group

than in the TDV group, and these differences were more pronounced in baseline seropositive subjects 
than in baseline seronegative subjects.  
Subgroup Analyses of Efficacy 
Results from subgroup analyses by age group (4-5, 6-11, and 12-16 years), region (Asia Pacific region, 
Latin America), country, and prior vaccination against YF or JE are summarised. 
Vaccine Efficacy by Age Group. Results from subgroup analyses by age group (4-5, 6-11, and 12-
16 years), from 30 days to 24 months post second dose, showed that VE of TDV in preventing VCD 
fever was seen across all predefined age groups with VE lower values in subjects aged 4 to 5 years 
(51.0%), and higher values, in subjects aged 6 to 11 years (71.8%) and in subjects aged 12 to 
16 years (79.3%). Further analyses by baseline serostatus showed the VE values of ≥67.0% across all 
subgroups by baseline serostatus within age group, with the only exception of baseline seronegative 
subjects in the youngest subgroup of 4 to 5 years (VE: 4.6%). Moreover, some decline in VE was seen 
from Year 1 to Year 2, with a higher persistence of efficacy suggested in the older age groups. 
Additional data provided by the Applicant describe VE covering the period from 30 days to 54 months 
post second dose (PP set). It is shown that VE against VCD was high in the three age groups analysed, 
with the lowest VE estimate [41% (95%CI: 21%, 55%)] observed in the youngest age group (4-5 
yoa). VE estimates were always positive when VE was calculated, for each age group, according to the 
baseline serostatus, and also when calculated, for each age group, according to the serotype of the 
infected dengue virus. It is noted, however, that 95%CI of the VE estimates were wide, and in some 
cases crossed zero, due to the few cases that were observed in some of the subgroups analysed. These 
results provided support for the use of the vaccine in children from 4 to 16 years of age. 
Vaccine Efficacy by Region and Country. Results from subgroup analyses by region and country are 
mainly driven by the respective epidemiological setting (serotypes that circulate) in the respective 
country and region and the different VE efficacy shown for the Dengue serotypes, particularly high for 
DENV-2 and the variable VE against DENV-3 by baseline serostatus.  
The VE against VCD fever leading to hospitalization (from 30 days after second injection up to 24 
months) was high in both the Asia Pacific region (88.9%) and Latin America (94.5%). It is however 
noted that most of the hospitalized cases were from Asia Pacific (81 cases) vs Latin America (10 
cases). In fact, when examined by country in the placebo group, 60% of the hospitalized cases (45 out 
of 75) were from Sri Lanka. These data that cover the period from 30 days after second injection up to 
24 months only included 11 additional cases of hospitalized VCD in the placebo group as compared to 
the previous analysis (from 30 days after second injection up to 18 months). In line with the previous 
data, 60% of hospitalized VCD cases were from Sri Lanka, which was the country with the highest rate 
of hospitalized VCD cases based on the number of VCD fever cases.  
Vaccine Efficacy by Prior Vaccination Against Yellow Fever or Japanese Encephalitis. Subgroup analyses 
by prior vaccination against YF or JE showed VE values of 86.1% in those subjects previously 
vaccinated against JE, 68.8% in those previously vaccinated against YF, and 60.6% in those not 
previously vaccinated against either JE or YF, suggesting an impact of prior JE or YF vaccination on the 
VE of TDV. However, subgroup analysis results by prior vaccination against JE or YF were highly 
confounded by differences between regions and countries and their underlying serotype distribution, 
and thus when examined in detail, overall, the data did not suggest a clear and consistent impact of 
prior JE or YF vaccination on the efficacy of TDV.  
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From First Dose to 36 Months Post Second Vaccine Dose. The 
overall VE in preventing VCD fever from 30 days post second vaccination up to 36 months was 59.6% 
(95%CI: 53.6%, 64.9%), which is lower than that observed from 30 days post second vaccination up 
to 24 months (VE: 70.2%; 95% CI: 63.7%, 75.6%).

The Applicant shows also initial results based on the entire period from first dose until 36 months post 
second vaccine dose using the safety set instead of the PPS. The results are in line with those 
described before based on data up to 24 months post second dose. It is however noted that in the 
safety set (from first dose up to 39 months):  i) for dengue seronegative subjects at baseline, there 
were more cases of VCD due to DENV-4 in the TDV group (8 cases) than in the control group (2 cases) 
which resulted in a negative VE although with very wide CI (VE -100%; 95%CI: -867; 56) and ii) the 
efficacy in terms of prevention of DHF and severe cases is only observed in dengue seropositive 
subjects at baseline and not in those seronegative. In line with previous results, a similar observation 
was made for DENV-3 (VE: -23.4; 95%CI: -125.3, 32.4).  
The Applicant provided analyses including and excluding Sri Lanka data. These analyses indicated that 
VE against VCD fever, from first dose to 36 months post second vaccine dose in baseline seronegative 
subjects (safety set), was shown clearly for cases due to DENV-1 and DENV-2 both when including and 
excluding Sri Lanka data. The evaluation of VE against VCD fever caused by DENV-3 yielded negative 
VE estimates both when including and excluding Sri Lanka data (-23% and -3%, respectively). 
Nonetheless, the CIs were wide and included 0, so the actual VE could not be determined. It is noted 
that for cases due to DENV-4, there were 2 cases in the placebo group and 8 cases in the TDV group, 
both when including and excluding Sri Lanka data, thus the estimate of VE was negative in both cases 
[(VE: -105% (-867; 56) when including Sri Lanka and very similar (-107%) when excluding this 
country]. Thus, overall, Sri Lanka data did not appear to act as a confounding factor regarding 
estimation of VE for VCD fever cases. When considering VE against hospitalized VCD due to DENV-1, a 
similar estimate (around 77%) was observed both when including and excluding Sri Lanka data. 
However, for cases due to DENV-2, clear VE was only shown when Sri Lanka data were included, but 
no evidence of VE was obtained when these data were excluded (since in this case there were 2 cases 
in the placebo group vs zero in the TDV group). For DENV-3, both when Sri Lanka data were included 
or excluded, VE estimates against hospitalized VCD were negative (-183% and -28%, respectively) 
again with 95% CIs including zero. Nothing can be concluded about VE against hospitalized cases due 
to DENV-4, since no hospitalized cases occurred in trial DEN-301. Thus, regarding VCD hospitalized 
cases, Sri Lanka data only had an important effect when calculating VE for cases due to DENV-2.  
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From 25 to 36 Months (Year 3) Post Second Vaccine Dose. 
During Year 3 post second dose, the VE against overall VCD in the total PPS was 44.7% (95% CI: 
32.5%, 54.7%) as well as in baseline seronegative subjects (VE: 35.5%; 95% CI: 7.3%, 55.1%) and 
seropositive subjects (VE: 48.3%; 95% CI: 34.2%, 59.3%). Compared with Year 2 (VE: 56.2% (95% 
CI: 42.3%, 66.8%), there was a decline in the efficacy against overall VCD.  Efficacy against VCD 
leading to hospitalization in Year 3 was 70.8% (95% CI: 49.6%, 83.0%) for the total PPS, 45.0% 
(95% CI: -42.6%, 78.8%) for baseline seronegative subjects, and 78.4% (95% CI: 57.1%, 89.1%) for 
baseline seropositive subjects. With regard to the efficacy against VCD (overall and leading to 
hospitalization) caused by individual dengue serotypes and by baseline serostatus in Year 3 the results 
show a marginal VE against VCD fever caused by DENV-1 in baseline seronegative subjects (VE: 
17.2%; 95% CI: -31.8%, 47.9%), while in DENV-1 baseline seropositive subjects, efficacy was 
observed although lower than in the previous year (VE: 45.4%; 95% CI: 24.5%, 60.6%). For any VCD 
caused by DENV-3, a marginally positive efficacy estimate was seen in both baseline seronegative 
subjects (VE: 9.5%; 95% CI: -144.7%, 66.5%) and seropositive subjects (VE: 15.2%; 95% CI: -
46.1%, 50.8%). There were few VCD cases caused by DENV-4 to allow for meaningful conclusions. 
These results are indicative of waning of immune response. Importantly, for VCD caused by DENV-3 
leading to hospitalization during Year 3, in baseline seronegative subjects, an imbalance in the number 
of cases was seen in the TDV group (7 hospitalizations of 11 VCD cases) compared with the placebo 
group (1 hospitalization out of 6 VCD cases) (the randomisation ratio of 2:1 [TDV: placebo] should be 
considered). This result appears to be linked to the high rate of hospitalization of VCD cases in Sri 
Lanka as compared to other countries.  The Applicant discussed this worrying result that indicates that 
Assessment report

vaccinated seronegative subjects are at higher risk of hospitalization if infected by DENV-3 (particularly 
in Year 3 after second vaccination) than those that received placebo. Moreover, considering that the 
trial DEN-301 was still ongoing, it was required to provide further data, up to 54 months post second 
vaccine dose, to re-examine the B/R in light of these new data (see below). 
As already demonstrated for the period 30 days post second doses until end of part 2 (18 months post 
second dose), the situation is repeated when the period is extended to month 36, in that there is a 
large difference in the percent of VCD cases that are hospitalized, being again Sri Lanka the country 
with the highest percentage (72%). Again, most of hospitalized cases were due to DENV-2 (56%).  
It was also considered that despite the observation that VE declines with time, it remains high for 
dengue seropositive subjects at baseline for at least three years and that there is no clear indication 
that it translates into an increased risk of severe disease for seronegative subjects.  
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Fever From First Dose to 54 Months Post Second Vaccine Dose. The 
Applicant has provided the final data from pivotal Trial DEN-301 after completion of the pre-booster 
phase until 54 months post second dose (Parts 1, 2 and 3 of the trial), focusing on the benefit-risk 
profile in baseline seronegative subjects. 
A substantial number of subjects (91.0%) of those in the safety set completed Part 3 of the trial and 
this percentage was similar in the 2 trial intervention groups. This is a remarkable result that provides 
reassurance on the obtained results. Moreover, it is also noted that more than 96% of the dengue 
seronegative subjects that were included in the analysis of Year 1 remained at the study at Year 4 
(from 37 to 48 months post second dose). It is noted that in the overall population the incidence of 
febrile illnesses was lower during the last 18 months of Part 3 (15.2 cases per 100 person years in the 
placebo group and 13.4 cases in the TDV group) compared with the entire follow-up period since first 
dose (31.7 and 29.4 cases, respectively). The Applicant argues that this is likely due to the fact that 
the trial period after 36 months post second vaccine dose mostly occurred during the coronavirus 
disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. 
Compared with the 36-month data in baseline seronegative subjects (268 cases of VCD; 51 cases 
leading to hospitalization, 5 DHF cases and 2 DCAC-defined severe VCD), a total of 40 VCD cases 
occurred during the additional 18-month follow-up period, including 7 cases leading to hospitalization, 
1 case of DHF, and no DCAC-defined severe cases. The 7 cases of VCD leading to hospitalization 
included 6 cases in the placebo group, 1 of which was the DHF case. It is noted that of the 7 additional 
cases leading to hospitalization, 4 were caused by DENV-1, and 1 each caused by DENV-2, 3 and 4. 
The additional case of DHF was caused by DENV-1. Of note, 2 of the 7 hospitalized cases (1 DENV-4 
case in the placebo group and 1 DENV-1 case in the TDV group) were not included in the yearly 
analyses because of the censoring rules as they were a second episode, but they are included in the 
cumulative analyses (safety set). It is noted that not all subjects completed the last 6 months following 
Year 4, as some were enrolled into the booster phase thus, the results based on these six last months 
have to be viewed with caution. It is noted that the new data do not help to completely address the MO 
raised at D180 due to the few cases caused by DENV-3 and DENV-4 in the 18-month follow-up period. 
In particular, 1 hospitalized VCD and no severe dengue cases caused by DENV-3 have been observed 
and only 1 case of hospitalized VCD (a second episode) and 5 cases of VCD caused by DENV-4 have 
been observed (4 of them in the last 6 months period). 
The benefit of TDV against overall VCD in baseline seronegative subjects was confirmed in the analysis 
from first dose to 54 months post second vaccine dose with a VE estimate of 53.5% (95% CI: 41.6%, 
62.9%. The VE against VCD leading to hospitalization was 79.3% (95% CI: 63.5%, 88.2%). These VE 
estimates were very similar to those reached from first vaccine dose to 36 months post second vaccine 
dose.  
Assessment report

VE against VCD fever, from first dose to 54 months post second vaccine dose in baseline seronegative 
subjects (safety set), was shown clearly for cases due to DENV-1 and DENV-2 both when including and 
excluding Sri Lanka data (VE estimates higher than 44%, with CI excluding zero).  
The evaluation of VE against VCD fever caused by DENV-3 yielded VE estimates of -15% (95%CI: -108 
, 36) and 3.4% (95%CI: -77 , 47), when including and excluding Sri Lanka data, respectively, and it is 
noted that in both cases, the 95%CI was very wide and included 0. Thus, these data do not suggest VE 
of TDV against VCD cases due to DENV-3, in baseline seronegative subjects.  
Regarding cases due to DENV-4, the estimate of VE was negative when including Sri Lanka (VE: -105 
(-628; 42) and very similar (-106%) when excluding this country. Considering the few VCD cases due 
to DENV-4, which resulted in a large 95%CI, VE against cases due to DENV-4 cannot be assessed, 
precluding a meaningful conclusion on the performance of TDV against this dengue serotype. Thus, 
overall, Sri Lanka data did not appear to act as a confounder regarding estimation of VE for VCD fever 
cases according to the different dengue serotypes. 
Regarding VE against hospitalized VCD, identical VE estimates (78%) against hospitalized VCD due to 
DENV-1 were observed both when including and excluding Sri Lanka data (the LL of the 95%CI of VE 
were 63 and 28%, respectively). However, for cases due to DENV-2, VE was only shown when Sri 
Lanka data were included VE 100% [(23 vs 0 cases)], but no clear evidence of VE was obtained when 
Sri Lanka data were excluded (3 cases in the placebo group vs zero cases in the TDV group). However, 
it is pointed out that these results are not indicative of an increased risk of hospitalized VCD cases due 
to DENV-2 in baseline seronegative subjects. 
For DENV-3, both when Sri Lanka data were included or excluded, VE estimates against hospitalized 
VCD were -87.9% and 15%, respectively; again, with wide 95% CIs that include zero. The Company 
interpreted the negative VE estimate observed when Sri Lanka cases are included to be confounded by 
the high hospitalization rate of VCD cases in Sri Lanka.  
The interpretation of VE results in dengue baseline seronegative subjects by year and infecting dengue 
serotype is difficult due to the few numbers of cases to be compared for each analysis. No obvious 
pattern is observed that would indicate that hospitalized cases increase with time, a result that appears 
to rule out the possibility that waning of VE drives an increase in hospitalized cases. As already 
discussed above, the clearest imbalance was observed in Y3 for cases due to DENV-3, where 1 vs 7 
cases of hospitalized VCD were observed for the placebo and TDV groups, respectively. The applicant 
indicates that these data appear to be confounded by the high hospitalization rates of Sri Lanka, since 
when the cases from this country are excluded, only 1 case each for the placebo and TDV groups are 
observed. Thus, it appears that the imbalance in hospitalizations in Year 3 cannot be reliably linked to 
waning of VE. 
As indicated above, in dengue seronegative subjects there were no additional cases of severe Dengue 
(DHF and DCAC-defined severe VCD cases) caused by DENV-3. Thus, during the 54-month follow-up 
period, in baseline seronegative subjects infected by DENV-3 there was 1 severe case in the placebo 
group and 5 cases in the TDV group (that corresponded to 1 vs 4 cases of DHF, and 0 vs 2 cases of 
DCAC-defined severe VCD cases in the placebo and TDV groups, respectively). It is noted that one 
case was classified both as DHF and DCAC-defined severe VCD cases. the Applicant indicated that DHF 
detection in Sri Lanka was almost 3 times the rate of other countries (5.8% vs 2.0% across serotypes) 
in the placebo group. This is likely because of the conservative hospitalization criteria and the close 
monitoring with frequent platelet count evaluation and ultrasonography, a sensitive method which can 
detect subclinical plasma leakage. Notably, thrombocytopenia and plasma leakage are 2 of the 4 
defining criteria of DHF, and thus the rate of DHF detection can be sensitive to frequency and nature of 
investigations. Moreover, it is noted that the 2:1 randomization also predisposes an imbalance towards 
the TDV group. In conclusion, it is agreed with the Company that the increased number of severe 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 175/254 
 
 
 
 
dengue cases due to DENV-3 in seronegative subjects is confounded by the small number of DCAC-
defined severe and DHF cases, the higher rate of DHF detection in Sri Lanka, and additional statistical 
considerations, and thus there is no robust evidence of increased risk of severe dengue disease caused 
by DENV-3 in baseline seronegative subjects.  
The benefit from TDV vaccination in baseline seropositive subjects, as demonstrated based on the data 
up to 18 months post second dose, is maintained. The VE against overall VCD from first dose to 
54 months post second dose in baseline seropositive subjects was 64.2% (95% CI: 58.4%, 69.2%) 
and against VCD leading to hospitalization 85.9% (95% CI: 78.7%, 90.7%).  
Immunogenicity  
Geometric Mean Titres of Neutralizing Antibodies Against Dengue 
Overall, GMTs in the TDV group increased for each serotype (independently of baseline serostatus) to 
Month 1 following the first vaccine dose, declined to the second vaccine dose (Month 3), increased 
again following the second vaccine dose to Month 4, and thereafter slightly declined to Month 15. The 
magnitude of the response was comparable for DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4, and was higher for 
DENV-2. The fact that the highest VE was found for DENV-2 fits with the GMTs against this serotype 
being also the highest induced by TDV, in accordance with general knowledge in that higher 
neutralizing antibodies are associated with clinical protection. 
For baseline seronegative subjects, in the TDV group, seropositivity rates for each serotype increased 
from baseline to 90.5% - 98.6% at Month 1, and rates continued high up to month 27 (≥90.4). At 
Month 39 (36 months post second vaccine dose), GMTs and seropositivity rates in the TDV showed 
little change compared with the preceding time point at Month 27 for both baseline seronegative 
subjects and baseline seropositive subjects. VE declined from 12 to 36 months from second dose 
(particularly during the last year), and despite that, the immunogenicity analysis indicates that in 
terms of GMTs and seropositivity rates that decline was not so evident.  These results are indicative 
that other elements of the immune system, apart from neutralizing antibodies, are important in 
maintaining long-term VE.  
In a descriptive approach to evaluate a potential correlate of protection, it was found that GMTs for 
both cases and controls were higher in the TDV group than in the placebo group, for each serotype and 
irrespective of baseline serostatus. However, not specific cut-off titre was identified as predictive of 
clinical protection since in fact there was considerable overlap in antibody titres between cases and 
controls, particularly in the seronegative group. 
Other Phase 3 trials  
In addition to pivotal phase 3 Trial DEN-301, 6 further trials, phase 3 Trials DEN-304 and DEN-315, 
co-administration phase 3 Trials DEN-305 and DEN-314, and phase 2 Trials DEN-313 and DEN-204 
provide immunogenicity data in support of TDV as vaccine for the prevention of dengue disease. 
It is noted that the CHMP agreed, in a scientific advice letter, with the design of the lot-to-lot 
consistency study (study DEN-304), the 2 co-administration studies with Yellow fever and Hepatitis A 
vaccines (DEN-305 and DEN-314) in non-endemic countries, and with the design of the DEN-315 trial 
to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of 2 doses of TDV, in healthy adolescent subjects aged 
12 to 17 years in a non-endemic area. 
Study DEN-304. Phase 3 Trial DEN-304 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled phase 3 
trial with 923 healthy subjects aged 18 to 60 years, conducted in non-endemic regions of the United 
States to investigate lot-to-lot consistency of 3 consecutive TDV lots in terms of equivalence of the 
induced immunogenicity. The primary endpoint analysis evaluated the lot-to-lot consistency at 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 176/254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Month 4. Therefore, since TDV is a tetravalent vaccine, 12 pairwise comparisons were made.  Lot-to-lot 
consistency could be demonstrated statistically for only 8 of the 12 pairwise comparisons, and thus, 
the primary endpoint was not met since it was required to show equivalence of immune responses for 
all pairwise comparisons. The Applicant considered that the lower-than-expected size of the PPS, and 
high level of variability observed in the GMTs for DENV-1 could in fact have influenced the failure to 
meet the primary endpoint. As to complete the data of the trial, the Applicant has provided reverse 
cumulative distribution curves of MNT50 titres by lot and serotype. 
It is noted, however that the high levels of at least trivalent and tetravalent positivity rates (between 
94.6% and 100% of subjects for each serotype in the TDV lots) were observed for up to 6 months 
after the second dose in all TDV lots for all dengue serotypes. Considering the explanations given by 
the Applicant and the fact that lot-to-lot consistency is not currently (EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 
Rev. 1) a requirement for approval, the lack of fulfilment of the primary endpoint for this trial is not 
raised as a major objection.  
Study DEN-315. Trial DEN-315 was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3 trial 
planned in 400 healthy adolescent subjects aged 12 to 17 years in a dengue non-endemic region of 
Mexico (Mexico City) with 2 parallel groups to investigate the immunogenicity and safety of TDV in a 
dengue non-endemic area.  
TDV was shown to be immunogenic in baseline dengue seronegative adolescents aged 12 to 17 years 
since GMTs of neutralizing antibodies (MNT50) increased to 327 against DENV-1, 1742 against DENV-2, 
119 against DENV-3, and 142 against DENV-4 at 1 month post second dose of TDV (Month 4). Six 
months post second dose of TDV (Month 9), GMTs had decreased by around two-fold as compared with 
Month 4. In line with other studies the highest GMTs were reached against DENV-2. At 1 month post 
second dose (Month 4), in the TDV group, the seropositivity rate increased up to ≥99.6% for all 
serotypes, and a very similar figure was observed two months later.  
In conclusion, this study showed that TDV was immunogenic both in terms of GMTs and seropositivity 
rates in adolescent (12 -17 years) seronegative population. Nonetheless, at six months post second 
dose the GMTs have decreased overall by more than 50%. 
The Applicant also performed 2 co-administration studies (DEN-305 and DEN-314) in non-endemic 
countries with Yellow fever and Hepatitis A vaccines with the intention to study the possible 
interactions of TDV vaccine with the most common vaccines used for travellers.   
Study DEN-305. DEN-305 was a phase 3, observer-blind, randomised, multicentre trial in 900 healthy 
adults aged 18 to 60 years living in regions non-endemic for both dengue and YF, to investigate the 
immunogenicity and safety of TDV and a YF vaccine (YF-17D) administered concomitantly or 
sequentially. The trial was conducted in the United States. The primary objective was met since the 
difference between YF seroprotection rates 1 month after vaccination of subjects that received 
concomitant administration of 1 dose of TDV +YF vaccine, compared to those that received 
concomitantly YF vaccine +placebo was of 0.40 (-1.85%, 2.69%), being the upper bound of the 95% 
CI below the pre-established non-inferiority margin of 5%.  
However, one of the secondary objectives aimed to demonstrate the non-inferiority of the GMT 
response to TDV for all dengue serotypes combined at 1 month post second dose of TDV following 
concomitant administration of the first dose of TDV with YF-17D vaccine or with placebo, was not met. 
In fact, the non-inferiority in TDV GMTs was shown for DENV-2, DENV-3, and DENV-4, but not for 
DENV-1 (GMTs of 297.1 vs 182.6). Moreover, lower seropositivity rates 1 month post first TDV dose 
were seen in the group that received TDV and YF concomitantly vs the group that received TDV and 
placebo for DENV-3 (80% vs 88%) and DENV-4 (78% vs 89%). This same pattern was maintained at 
month 7 (when the three doses of vaccines, 2 TDV and 1 YF, had been administered) since the 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 177/254 
 
 
 
 
seropositivity rates were 99% (for DENV-1 and DENV-2) and 93% (DENV-3) and 94% (DENV-4), 
respectively.   
The applicant further discussed the data from study DEN-305 and showed that the GMT levels and the 
seropositivity rates in the group that received concomitant administration of TDV and YF-17D vaccine 
in study DEN-305 are comparable with the results obtained in the other trials.  The applicant’s 
justification is endorsed and thus it is considered that there is support for co-administration of TDV 
with 17D yellow fever vaccine. 
Study DEN-314. DEN-314 was a phase 3, observer-blind, randomised trial in 900 healthy adult 
subjects aged 18 to 60 years living in regions non-endemic for both dengue and hepatitis A, to 
investigate the immunogenicity and safety of the co-administration of subcutaneous (SC) TDV and an 
intramuscular (IM) HAV vaccine. The trial was conducted in the United Kingdom. At trial entry, subjects 
had to be seronegative for Hepatitis A and for dengue. The primary objective of demonstrating 
non-inferiority of the immune response following co-administration of HAV + TDV/TDV as compared to 
sequential administration was met. In terms of GMTs and seropositivity rates for the four Dengue virus 
serotypes, the co-administration of TDV with HAV did not show any negative impact as compared to 
subjects that received the two vaccines sequentially.  
Other immunogenicity analysis across trials 
The Applicant prepared an immunogenicity report comparing humoral immunogenicity (measured by 
the MNT assay) in terms of GMTs and seropositivity rates, achieved in response to TDV from subjects 
from the seven trials in which TDV in its final formulation was administered as 2 SC doses 3 months 
apart. In total immunogenicity was assessed in 3717 subjects, 2796 in endemic regions and 
921 subjects in the non-endemic regions. Trials conducted in non-endemic regions (DEN-304, 
DEN-315, and co-administration trials DEN-305 and DEN-314) provide data for baseline seronegative 
subjects in the age groups of 12 to 17 years (DEN-315) and 18 to 60 years. 
Endemic Regions 
In general, the GMT profile was consistent between trials (DEN-301, DEN-313 and DEN-204) 
performed in subjects from 2 to 17 years conducted in endemic regions. GMTs increased after first 
vaccine dose from baseline to Month 1 and decreased slightly from Month 1 to Month 3. One month 
after the second dose an increase was observed. At subsequent time points (the longest Month 48 in 
Trial DEN-204), GMTs remained well above baseline levels. In all 3 trials and in both subgroups by 
baseline serostatus, GMTs were generally lower for baseline seronegative subjects than for baseline 
seropositive subjects, and GMTs were highest (about 10-fold) for DENV-2 compared with the other 
serotypes. Although there is no antibody threshold to serve as a correlate of protection, the highest 
GMT titres observe against DENV-2 correlate well with the highest VE showed against VCD fever for 
this serotype in trial DEN-301.  Overall, the same correlation is seen for Dengue serotypes 1, 2 and 3 
in that higher titres and VE are observed in baseline seropositive subjects vs seronegative ones. No 
dramatic decrease in titres is observed from 24 to 36 moth post vaccination that would explain the 
clear reduction in VE in this period of time observed in trial DEN-301.  This reflects that not only MNT 
titres but other elements of the immune system are involved in long-term VE.  
Among baseline seronegative subjects after the second dose, seropositivity rates were generally high 
(≥97% across all serotypes). Similarly high values (around 10% lower) were observed up to Month 27 
in Trial DEN-301 and up to Month 48 in Trial DEN-204. Among baseline seropositive subjects, 
seropositivity rates for each dengue serotype were high already at baseline, increased at Month 1, and 
remained high (around 99%) at all subsequent times.  
All these data indicate a strong immune response in both seropositive and seronegative dengue 
subjects living in endemic areas following TDV administration. It should be noted, however, that the 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 178/254 
 
 
 
 
GMTS and seropositivity rates determined in both groups in the long term are most likely influenced by 
additional natural booster doses due to natural infection with Dengue viruses from of one or more 
different serotypes.  
Non-Endemic Regions 
In general, the GMT profile and seropositivity rates of TDV administered in 2 doses 3 months apart was 
consistent across the trials conducted in non-endemic regions (DEN-304, DEN-315 and DEN-314) 
which included subjects aged 18-60 years. No negative effect of age was observed. 
Overall, GMT titres had increased at Month 4 and had slightly decreased at Month 9 compared with 
Month 4 but remained well above baseline levels showing immune persistence of antibody response. As 
observed in endemic areas about 10-fold higher GMTs were observed against DENV-2 than against the 
other 3 dengue serotypes.  
In general, at Month 4 (1 month post second vaccine dose), seropositivity rates had increased from 
baseline, mostly to levels well above 95%. At Month 9, seropositivity rates had slightly decreased. No 
information on long-term (more than 9 months post second dose) persistence of antibody response is 
known from trials DEN-304, DEN-315 and DEN-314. 
Immunobridging 
The product will be indicated for prevention of dengue disease caused by any dengue virus serotype in 
individuals 4 years of age and above. In endemic countries the adult population tends to be pre-
exposed to dengue, which makes it not feasible to evaluate VE in a dengue naive adult population. 
Thus, the Applicant proposed the extension to the age range of >16 to 60 years based on the available 
immunogenicity data through a pre-specified immunobridging analysis. The primary analysis compared 
the immune response data in baseline seronegative subjects from Trials DEN-301 (702 pediatric 
subjects aged 4-16 years, endemic region) and DEN-304 (379 adult subjects aged 18-60 years, non-
endemic region; data from the 3 TDV groups, corresponding to the 3 TDV lots, were combined).  
From both trials, immunogenicity data (in terms of neutralizing antibodies) at 1 and 6 months post 
second vaccine dose, ie, at Months 4 and 9, were used for the comparisons. The analysis population for 
the primary immunobridging evaluation was restricted to baseline seronegative subjects. The applicant 
used as the non-inferiority criterion for the immunobridging analysis that the upper bound of the 
95% CI for the geometric mean ratio <2.0. There is not much explanation on the rationale to choose 
this limit of 2 instead of a more restrictive one (1.5) used also in many immunobridging studies. The 
non-inferiority criterion (upper bound of the 95% CI for the geometric mean ratio <2.0) for the 
comparison of GMTs at Month 4 was fulfilled for serotypes DENV-1, DENV-2, and DENV-4, but 
marginally missed for DENV-3 with an upper bound of the associated 95% CI of 2.04. Thus, overall 
non-inferiority, ie, in all 4 serotypes, could not be shown statistically in the primary immunobridging 
analysis of immunogenicity data at Month 4. At Month 9, however, the non-inferiority criterion was 
fulfilled for all 4 dengue serotypes, with upper bounds of the 95% CI for the geometric mean ratios not 
having exceeded 1.18. It is noted that the analysis of seropositivity rates with more than 95% of 
subjects having reached tetravalent seropositivity at Month 4, irrespective of age group. Considering 
the general variability in GMTs, these immunobridging results in their totality support the proposed 
indication of TDV to prevent dengue disease caused by any dengue virus serotype in individuals 
4 years to 60 years of age.  
An important difference is to be made for seronegative subjects from 4 to 60 years of age living in 
endemic areas from those not living in endemic areas. On one hand, VE against VCD fever has been 
demonstrated in trial DEN-301 for subjects from 4-16 years of age living in endemic areas. Thus, taken 
into account the immunobridging exercise, it is considered that the VE observed in seronegative 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 179/254 
 
 
 
 
subjects from trial DEN-301 could be extrapolated to dengue seronegative subjects from 17-60 years 
of age and thus the indication can be extended from 17 to 60 years. 
In addition, the CHMP concurred with the Applicant that healthy subjects over 60 years of age could 
also benefit from vaccination with TDV and therefore agreed to remove the upper age limit of 60 years 
from the therapeutic indication. A detailed analysis of the safety and immunogenicity data collected in 
the development program from subjects aged up to 60 years did not suggest relevant age effects; 
hence, a similarly favourable benefit-risk profile is anticipated for subjects aged>60 years. 
Additional expert consultation 
Q1. Concerning the lack of demonstration of vaccine efficacy, in baseline dengue 
seronegative subjects,  against VCD fever in infections due to DENV-3 and the small increase 
in the number of VCD hospitalized/severe cases in subjects vaccinated with TDV as 
compared to placebo recipients:  Does the SAG consider that these limited set of data 
actually indicate a higher risk of hospitalized/severe dengue cases in TDV vaccinated 
seronegative subjects or that these results could be due to a confounding factor or be the 
consequence of random variability due to low number of hospitalized/severe dengue cases 
analysed? 
The scientific advisory group (SAG) reached consensus that the existing data do not provide clear 
evidence on a higher risk of severe disease / hospitalisation in baseline seronegative vaccinees infected 
with DENV-3 serotype. In view of non-conclusive data, the applicant’s proposal to conduct a post-
authorisation observational effectiveness Study (DEN-401), assessing the risk of hospitalisation 
associated with dengue infection by serotype in vaccinated baseline seronegative participants is 
supported. 
Q2. During the DEN-301 clinical trial, there were very few cases due to DENV-4 to get any 
reliable measure of vaccine efficacy of TDV against this serotype. Taking into account the 
current knowledge of infections caused by DENV-4 and the immunogenicity data of the TDV 
clinical development program, does the SAG expect a higher risk of VCD fever, hospitalized, 
or severe cases due to DENV-4 in dengue baseline seronegative recipients of TDV? 
The SAG considered that there seems to be no clear increased risk. Nevertheless, the SAG considered 
the data to be limited to derive a definite conclusion on higher risk of VCD fever, hospitalised or severe 
diseases due to DENV-4 in dengue baseline seronegative recipient of Takeda’s Tetravalent Dengue 
Vaccine (TDV).  On reviewing immunological data, for DENV-4, geometric mean neutralising antibodies 
titres were at par with data for vaccine serotypes DENV-1 and DENV-3, but these data are not helpful 
if viewed against different clinical outcomes noted per serotype. On current knowledge of infection 
though, the SAG indicated that serotype DENV-4 is less prevalent and typically associated with milder 
disease.  Observational study data (DEN-401) as proposed by the applicant will provide further 
assurance on absence of increased risk. 
Q3.  If in response to questions 1 and 2, the SAG considers that there is an increased risk of 
hospitalized/severe dengue cases in baseline dengue seronegative subjects:  Does the SAG 
consider that limiting the use of the vaccine in baseline positive serostatus subjects could 
be an adequate strategy to minimize the risk of severe dengue occurring in vaccinated 
subjects? 
In view of the advice provided for the above questions 1 & 2, the SAG concluded that the totality of 
data for TDV supports a broad indication, for both baseline seronegative and seropositive 
subjects.  The assertion of the applicant that a broad indication is important for practical 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

implementation of community vaccination and is in the interest of global public health, is 
acknowledged. 
Q4. In relation to the use of TDV for travellers to endemic areas (taking into account that 
most travellers will be seronegative at baseline): 
a) 
Does the SAG consider that TDV could be used in individuals living in non-endemic 
areas traveling to endemic areas?  
b) 
Does the SAG have any specific considerations for those who travel frequently to 
dengue endemic areas as compared to those who travel only occasionally to these areas? In 
both cases, are there any specific considerations or precautionary measures that should be 
taken into account for these individuals? 
The SAG took various factors into account during the discussions, such as regional serotype specific 
endemicity, length of stay, frequency of visit to endemic areas and evidence of previous dengue 
infection. Although no specific guidance could be formulated, as a general recommendation, TDV could 
indeed be useful in individuals living in non-endemic areas travelling to endemic regions. The SAG 
expressed a strong recommendation for use of TDV in those travellers who previously suffered dengue 
(on history; laboratory confirmed). For all, the vaccination decision should be guided in concert with 
recommendations from their Public Health Authorities and their health care provider, taking account of 
individual circumstances (e.g. regions to visit, time spent at risk). The SAG agreed that there is no 
need to include the requirement to perform a pre-travel serostatus determination to be vaccinated. 
Q5. The applicant proposes to carry out an observational study (a Nested Case-Control post-
authorization effectiveness study) post-authorization.  In this regard: 
Does the SAG have any recommendations regarding the requirements of additional 
sponsored studies and or if the above-mentioned potential risks could be monitored 
adequately in post-approval vaccine effectiveness studies such as the proposed Nested 
Case-Control post authorization effectiveness study? 
Does the SAG consider feasible to assess the impact of TDV, on prevention of cases due to 
DENV-3 and DENV-4, by introducing TDV in the national vaccination program of country 
where DEN-3 and DEN-4 are circulating widely and if so, would the SAG advice to include 
these countries in the post-marketing effectiveness study? 
The SAG was in general agreement with the proposed nested case-control post-authorisation 
effectiveness study (DEN-401) as a means to monitor the potential risks and obtain vaccine 
effectiveness estimates DENV-3/DENV-4 serotypes. The SAG emphasized that the site selection should 
aim to maximize chance to include cases of DENV-3/DENV-4 serotypes, i.e. sites in South-East Asian 
countries with background circulation of DENV-3 and DENV-4. The importance of sampling of baseline 
serostatus in study, immediately prior to vaccination was stressed to assure there is no change of 
serostatus between sampling and vaccination.  
In addition, particularly in reference to areas with circulating DENV-3/ DENV-4, the SAG advised to 
perform a phase 2 study with TDV, to be conducted in baseline seronegative individuals, allowing 
further characterisation of humoral and cellular immune responses, such as neutralising antibodies, 
binding antibodies to study the potential risk of antibody disease enhancement, B-cell memory and T-
cell responses. 
Q6.   Does the SAG have any additional observations from the data on factors that might 
predispose to severe dengue after vaccination with TDV, e.g., with respect to the intended 
use in the paediatric or elderly population? 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 181/254 
 
 
 
 
The SAG did not formulate specific recommendation on additional factors which might predispose to 
severe dengue after vaccination with TDV.  It is however noted that the pivotal efficacy study was 
conducted in paediatric subjects from 4 years of age and above, whilst the burden of dengue is equally 
problematic in a younger age group. The SAG expressed the desirability for a future clinical 
investigation to be conducted in this regard, covering the youngest cohorts. 
Q7.   What is the SAG view - based on current knowledge - on the potential impact of TDV 
on the severity of disease caused by Zika and other flaviviruses, and vice-versa the impact 
of such flaviviruses on TDV protection from Dengue disease? 
The SAG concluded that although interactions between flaviviruses are complex, there are insufficient 
data in the literature to assess the impact of TDV on severity of Zika and other flavivirus 
infections.  Additionally, there are no data to assess the negative impact of such flaviviruses on TDV 
protection from dengue. 
Q8. 
Taking into account the frequently severe course after secondary dengue virus 
infection (by DENV-1 and DENV-2) without vaccination, would efficacy shown against 
serotype 1 and 2 outweighs the lack of efficacy, with the potential risk of disease 
enhancement, by serotype 3/possibly serotype 4, in seronegative subjects. 
The SAG was of the view that efficacy against DENV-1 and DENV-2 (together causing most of dengue 
burden globally) outweighs any remaining uncertainty on lack of efficacy against DENV-3/4 and 
potential risks, in seronegative subjects. 
Q9. Dengvaxia data suggest an increased risk of disease against serotype 2 that peaks 
around the third year after vaccination and declines thereafter. What is the scientific 
rationale for this temporal pattern, including the subsequent drop-off? Does the SAG see 
parallels for Qdenga regarding such a temporal pattern? 
The SAG commented that the temporal pattern of risk seen for Dengvaxia cannot easily be explained, 
but a similar pattern has not been observed for TDV quadrivalent vaccine. 
Nevertheless, reference was made to the Kaplan Meier Curves demonstrating cumulative efficacy of 
TDV against [hospitalised] VCD presentation over 57 months. It was remarked that for vaccinees, a 
divergence of curves for baseline seropositives and seronegatives is noted around 33 months, 
providing rationale for booster administration around that period.  In that regard, it was noted that the 
effect of booster vaccination is further assessed in ongoing phase 3 Trial DEN-301 (Parts 4 & 5) in the 
subset of approximately 10,500 subjects aged 4 to 11 years with booster given 4 to 4.5 years after the 
second dose of the primary vaccination in endemic regions. 
Specific considerations on efficacy data for an EU vs. a non-EU context of use 
In the context of a parallel EU MAA and EU-M4all application, the claimed indication is the same in 
principle.  TDV has demonstrated efficacy in baseline seronegative subjects and hence can be used in 
individuals living in non-endemic areas and travelling to endemic areas. 
Its use should be guided in concert with recommendations from their Public Health Authorities and 
their health care provider, taking account of individual circumstances (see SAG advice; above).  The 
proposed SmPC (section 4.4.) and Package leaflet (section 2) both include statements about the 
limitations of the TDV effectiveness profile and recommend continuing personal protection measures 
against mosquito bites after vaccination as precautionary measures.

2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In relation to the Pivotal Phase 3 trial DEN-301, carried out in subjects from 4-16 years of age, the 
primary objective to show efficacy of Takeda Dengue Vaccine (TDV) in the prevention of Virologically 
Confirmed Dengue (VCD) fever caused by any serotype (ie, all 4 serotypes combined) from 30 days to 
12 months post second vaccine dose was met and the vaccine efficacy estimate determined was 
80.2% (95% CI: 73.3%, 85.3%; p<0.001). 
Similarly, VE against the key secondary endpoint (Hospitalization due to Virologically Confirmed 
Dengue Fever From 30 Days to 18 Months Post Second Vaccine Dose) was very high:  90.4% (95% CI: 
82.6%, 94.7%; p<0.001). VE against VCD fever decreased rapidly, so that in Year 2 post second dose 
was 56.2% (95% CI: 42.3-66.8%) and in year 3 was 44.7% (95%CI: 32.5-54.7). This decrease was 
higher in dengue seronegative subjects at the time of vaccination as compared to those seropositive.  
VE was also analysed according to the serotype of the infecting Dengue virus. When assessing VE 
against VCD fever from 30 days to 18 months post second vaccine dose, there were varying VE of TDV 
against each individual dengue serotype. The highest VE was shown for DENV-2 (95.1%; 95% CI: 
89.9%, 97.6%), and then for DENV-1 (VE of 69.8%; 95% CI: 54.8%, 79.9%), and DENV-3 (48.9%; 
95% CI: 27.2%, 64.1%). The VE against VCD fever caused by DENV-4 was inconclusive (51.0% 
(95% CI: -69.4%, 85.8%) due to the lower incidence rates of cases due to this serotype. Importantly, 
significant VE estimates (higher than 42.8%, with the 95% CI always higher than 0), were reported 
against individual serotypes when VE was determined from 30 days to 54 months post second vaccine 
dose (PP set).  
The benefit from TDV vaccination in baseline seropositive subjects, that was demonstrated based on 
the data up to 18 months post second dose, is maintained when analysed against VCD from first dose 
to 54 months post second dose [64.2% (95% CI: 58.4%, 69.2%)] and against VCD leading to 
hospitalization [85.9% (95% CI: 78.7%, 90.7%)] 
The benefit of TDV against overall VCD in baseline seronegative subjects (mainly derived from cases 
due to DENV-1 and DENV-2) was also confirmed in the analysis from first dose to 54 months post 
second vaccine dose with a VE estimate of 53.5% (95% CI: 41.6%, 62.9%. The VE against VCD 
leading to hospitalization was 79.3% (95% CI: 63.5%, 88.2%).  
A number of subgroup and exploratory analyses were performed to determine VE (against VCD and 
hospitalized VCD) according to dengue serostatus and the infecting dengue serotype (in total 16 
comparisons). It should be remarked that the trial was not powered to obtain robust estimates of VE 
from these analyses.  
In subgroup analysis, it was noted that VE against VCD caused by DENV-3 in baseline dengue 
seronegative subjects was not demonstrated. In fact, the VE estimate was negative [VE: -51% 
(95%CI: -1356; 84)] when analysed from 30 days to 18 months post second vaccination. Moreover, 
VE against VCD fever caused by DENV-3, from first dose to 54 months post second vaccine dose in 
baseline seronegative subjects (safety set), yielded VE estimates of -15 % (95%CI: -108, 36) and it is 
noted that the 95%CI was very wide and included 0.  
Regarding cases due to DENV-4, the estimate of VE was also negative (VE: -105 (-628; 42) when 
analysed in the time period from first dose to 54 months post second vaccine dose in baseline 
seronegative subjects (safety set). Considering the few VCD cases due to DENV-4, which resulted in a 
large 95%CI, VE against cases due to DENV-4 cannot be assessed, precluding a meaningful conclusion 
on the performance of TDV against this dengue serotype.  
Other exploratory analysis showed that VE estimate against hospitalized VCD due to DENV-3 in 
seronegative subjects, from first doses to 54 months post second dose (safety set), was -87.9% 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 183/254 
 
 
 
 
(95%CI: -573%, 47.6%); however, VE was 15% (95%CI -254%, 79%) when data from Sri Lanka (the 
country with the highest hospitalization rate of VCD cases) were excluded. These data are interpreted 
in that there is no clear evidence of higher hospitalization of cases due to DENV-3 since the results are 
confounded by the high hospitalization rate of VCD cases in Sri Lanka.  
Only one case of hospitalized VCD caused by DENV-4 was observed in Baseline Seronegative Subjects 
from First Vaccine Dose to 36 and to 54 Months Post Second Dose, preventing obtaining a meaningful 
estimate of VE against hospitalized VCD caused by DENV-4.  
The interpretation of VE results in dengue baseline seronegative subjects by year and infecting dengue 
serotype is difficult due to the few numbers of cases to be compared for each analysis. However, no 
obvious pattern is observed that would indicate that hospitalized cases increase with time, a result that 
appears to rule out the possibility that waning of VE drives an increase in hospitalized cases.  
Analysis of severe dengue cases (DHF and DCAC-defined severe VCD cases) identified an imbalance in 
baseline seronegative subjects infected by DENV-3. During the 54-month follow-up period, there was 1 
severe case in the placebo group and 5 cases in the TDV group (that corresponded to 1 vs 4 cases of 
DHF, and 0 vs 2 cases of DCAC-defined severe VCD cases in the placebo and TDV group, respectively; 
it is noted that one case was classified both as DHF and DCAC-defined severe VCD cases). However, 
the Applicant indicated that DHF detection in Sri Lanka was almost 3 times the rate in other countries 
(5.8% vs 2.0% across serotypes) in the placebo group. This is likely because of the conservative 
hospitalization criteria and the close monitoring with frequent platelet count evaluation and 
ultrasonography, a sensitive method which can detect subclinical plasma leakage. Notably, 
thrombocytopenia and plasma leakage are 2 of the 4 defining criteria of DHF, and thus the rate of DHF 
detection can be sensitive to frequency and nature of investigations. Moreover, it is noted that the 2:1 
randomization also predisposes an imbalance towards the TDV group. Hence, it is agreed with the 
Applicant that the increased number of severe dengue cases due to DENV-3 in seronegative subjects is 
confounded by the small number of DCAC-defined severe and DHF cases, the higher rate of DHF 
detection in Sri Lanka, and additional statistical considerations, and thus there is no robust evidence of 
increased risk of severe dengue disease caused by DENV-3 in baseline seronegative subjects. 
In conclusion, it is considered that the results from primary and secondary analyses provide strong 
support of vaccine efficacy against VCD and hospitalized VCD. Nonetheless, it was not possible to 
conclude on the VE regarding DENV-4, due to the lack of cases due to this serotype in the pivotal trial, 
and the lack of demonstration of VE against VCD cases due to DENV-3 in seronegative subjects. It is 
noted, however, that VE against hospitalisation due to DENV-1 and DENV-2, in baseline seronegative 
subjects, was demonstrated.  On the other hand, although VE against hospitalisation due to DENV-3 
and DENV-4 could not be demonstrated, from the current data, although limited, there is no clear 
evidence of higher risk of severe disease/hospitalisation in baseline seronegative subjects infected with 
DENV-3 or DENV-4. From the efficacy point of view, there are no outstanding issues precluding a 
Marketing Authorisation.   
However, to better define the VE, particularly with reference to seronegative individuals, the CHMP 
considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy: 
1. The Applicant is requested to submit the final updated protocol as well as the interim status update 
reports and final CSR for study DEN-401. 
2. The applicant is asked to provide yearly updates describing and discussing any effectiveness study 
published in scientific journals. 
3.The applicant is also asked to perform a study to investigate the potential benefit of an early booster 
dose (e.g. at about 12 months after dose 2) in seronegative individuals. [Trial DEN-301; Trial DEN-
303].

2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
A total of 18 clinical trials (7 phase 3 trials, 6 phase 2 trials, and 5 phase 1 trials) including 27,573 
subjects from dengue-endemic and non-endemic regions, covering an age range from 1.5 to 60 years 
were provided.  
Indication is “for the prevention of dengue disease in individuals from 4years of age”. The indication is 
irrespective of serostatus and geographical region of residence for the prevention of dengue disease 
caused by any dengue virus type. Cumulative safety data have been submitted up to an overall safety 
cut-off date of 01 October 2020 (approximately 6 months prior to the first filling). Long-term safety 
data up to approximately 4.5 years after the second vaccine dose from the pivotal phase 3 trial (DEN-
301) are available. From all subjects, 27,118 were aged 4 to 60 (target population). Of these, 19,589 
subjects received at least 1 dose of any TDV, irrespective of the formulation, viral content, or regimen 
used, and irrespective of concomitant or subsequent co-administration of HAV or YF vaccine. 
The pooled analysis of all phase 2 and phases 3 trials. The phase 2 and phase 3 trial data were used to 
create 2 different safety analysis pools:  
• 
Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (22,002 subjects total): Included placebo-controlled safety 
data from 5 randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials, 2 phase 2 (DEN-203 and DEN-204) and 3 
phase 3 trials (DEN-301, DEN-304 and DEN-315) 
• 
All Studies Safety Pool (25,236 subjects total): Included safety data from 10 clinical trials, 5 
phase 2 (DEN-203, DEN-204, DEN-205, DEN-106, DEN-313) and 5 phase 3 trials (DEN-301, DEN-304, 
DEN-305, DEN-314, DEN-315). 
The data from 5 phase 1 trials in adults (455 subjects total) were not included in the pooled analysis 
because the trials were mainly designed to explore different doses, schedules, vaccine formulations, 
and methods or routes of administration. And data from subjects <4 years were not included in the 
pooled dataset because they were not part of the proposed age indication.  
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
The integrated evaluation of the safety profile of final formulation (TDV) was based primarily on the 
Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (22,002 subjects total randomised 2:1; 14,627 subjects who received 
at least 1 dose of TDV, and 7,167 subjects who received at least 1 dose of placebo).  
In All Studies Safety Pool, 16,689 subjects received at least 1 dose of TDV, and 8,381 subjects 
received at least 1 dose of placebo.

received at least 1 dose of TDV, HD TDV, or placebo, and were included in the pooling. In Trials DEN-204 and DEN-106, 
subjects may have received both TDV (or HD TDV) and placebo at different time points. In Trial DEN-301, 4 subjects 
erroneously received 1 dose of TDV and 1 dose of placebo. For Trials DEN-314 and DEN-305, only subjects from Group 2 
(received TDV at Month 0 and Month 3) were included in the pooling, to avoid confounding by co-administered yellow fever 
or hepatitis A virus vaccine. 
Trials marked in bold include paediatric subjects.

Methodology for collection of AEs 
The pooled safety data were used to summarize the following:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Solicited local and systemic adverse events (AEs) within the first 30 minutes after each vaccine 
dose (in clinic assessment). 
Solicited local AEs up to 7 days after each vaccine dose (diary-recorded). 
Solicited systemic AEs up to 14 days after each vaccine dose (diary-recorded). 
Unsolicited AEs up to 28 days after each vaccine dose. 
AEs leading to trial and/or vaccine discontinuation up to the end of trial. 
Medically attended AEs (MAAEs, defined as AEs leading to a medical consultation with 
healthcare professionals without fulfilling any seriousness criteria). 
Deaths and other serious AEs (SAEs). 
Vital signs data. 
The evaluation of VCD, including severe dengue, vaccine viraemia, and clinical laboratory test were not 
part of the pooled safety analysis. The VCD was evaluated in pivotal trial DEN-301, the vaccine 
viraemia was evaluated mainly in DEN-205 and the reactogenicity in Phase 1 and 2 Phase 2 pooled, 
and laboratory findings in Phase 1 and 2 Phase 2 studies. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
In the overall population (4-60 years) no important differences between the TDV and placebo groups 
were observed regarding the demographic and baseline characteristics in the Placebo-Controlled Safety 
Pool. More than 90% of all subjects in the Placebo-controlled Safety Pool came from the pivotal Trial 
DEN-301 in children and adolescents aged 4 to 16 years (20,071 subjects, 91.2%).  Placebo-controlled 
data in adults were available for a smaller set of 940 subjects enrolled in trials DEN-304 and DEN-203 
and higher proportion of adults (18-60 years) was included in the TDV group than in the placebo group 
(5.4% vs 2.1%). In addition, >90% of all subjects in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool came from 
endemic regions, and the majority of subjects in both groups were seropositive at baseline. Moreover, 
a higher proportion of subjects from North America were included in the TDV group than in the 
placebo.

(b) 
Regarding the baseline demographics for the 2 paediatric age groups of children (4-11 years) and 
adolescents (12-17 years), exposure between the TDV and placebo groups were balanced. For the 4 to 
11 years age group, no data are available for subjects from non-endemic regions. 
In adults (18-60 years group), baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced in the 
TDV and placebo groups, except for the baseline serostatus (seropositive: 9.5% in TDV vs 20.4% in 
placebo and seronegative: 56.7% vs 48.7%, respectively) and the region of enrolment (100% from 
non-endemic region in TDV vs 86.2% from non-endemic region in placebo group). 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Adverse events (solicited and unsolicited) were summarized for a subset in placebo-controlled trials. 
The results of All Studies Safety Pool were consistent with the standard analyses based on the Placebo-
Controlled trials. 
Solicited Adverse Events 
All solicited local AEs were considered to be related to trial vaccine. The relatedness of solicited 
systemic AEs to trial vaccine was based on investigator assessment.

Solicited adverse events in target population (4-60 years) 
Solicited AE data from placebo-controlled trials were available for a subset of 5,555 participants (3,830 
subjects receiving TDV and 1,725 subjects receiving placebo). Overall, after any dose, the incidences 
of solicited local and systemic AEs were higher in the TDV group (43.4 % and 46.1%, respectively) 
than in the placebo group (25.7% and 40.1%, respectively). Solicited local and systemic AEs were 
generally less frequent after the second than after the first vaccine dose, both in the TDV and in the 
placebo groups (See Table 50).

Trials included for TDV and placebo groups: DEN-301, DEN-304, DEN-315, DEN-204 (Group 1 and Group 4, data up to Month 12), and DEN-203 (placebo 
group only because the trial investigated HD TDV).  
Sol cited local AEs include inject on site pain, erythema, and swelling.  
Sol cited systemic events may include headache, myalgia, malaise, and asthenia (adult/children panel) as well as irritabil ty/fussiness, drowsiness, and 
loss of appet te (infant/toddler panel), and fever (both panels). 
Related AEs: Solicited local AEs were cons dered to be related by default. For solicited system c related AEs, the investigator assessed the event as related 
to trial vaccine. Note: Relatedness was not recorded in Trial DEN-203. 
(a) 
In Trials DEN-301 and DEN-204, solicited AEs were collected in the randomly selected immunogenicity subset only. 
Solicited Local AE in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (4-60 years) 
Within 30 minutes after any vaccination, a 5.7% of participants who received TDV and a 4.5% in 
placebo group reported any solicited local AEs. These AEs were lower after the second dose than after 
the first. 
The most frequently solicited AE within 30 minutes reported after any vaccination was injection site 
pain (5.5% vs 4.5%), followed by erythema (0.2% vs 0) and swelling (0.1% vs 0). No severe solicited 
local AEs were reported within the first 30 minutes after any vaccine dose. 
Up 7 days after any dose, the frequencies of solicited local AEs were 43.4% in TDV and 25.7% in 
placebo. The most frequently solicited local AEs reported was injection site pain in both groups (41.8% 
vs 25.4%), followed by erythema (7.1% vs 0.3%) and swelling (3.4% vs 0.6%).   The majority of 
solicited local AEs (within 7 day) were mild. The frequency of severe (grade 3) solicited local AEs was 
1.3% in TDV and 0.7% in placebo group, mainly due to injection site pain (1.3% vs 0.6%). The time to 
onset was, mainly, on day of vaccination in both groups and resolved with a median duration of 2-3 
days in TDV groups and in 1 day in placebo group. 
Overall, the solicited local AEs reported after the second dose (28.9% in TDV vs 13.5% in placebo) 
were lower than after the first dose (34.4% vs 19.3%, respectively). However, there was a trend of 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 189/254 
 
 
 
 
 
 
increased frequency of Grade 3 injection site pain after the second dose compared to the first one 
(0.8% after second dose, 0.3% after first dose, respectively), although these percentages are very low 
and probably not significant. 
Solicited Systemic AE in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (4-60 years) 
Within 30 minutes after any vaccination, the solicited systemic AEs (excluding fever) were observed in 
1.3% in the TDV and in 1.2% in the placebo. Headache was the most frequently reported (0.8% in 
TDV vs 1.0% in placebo), followed by myalgia and asthenia (0.3% each in TDV). No severe solicited 
systemic AEs were reported. Fever (≥38°C) within the first 30 minutes after any dose were reported 
by 0.1% of participants in TDV and <0.1% in placebo. No fever ≥39°C was reported.  
Up to 14 days after any dose, the frequencies of solicited systemic AEs were 46.1% in TDV vs 40.1% 
in placebo. The solicited systemic AE after any dose most frequently reported was headache in both 
groups (33.8% vs 30.1%), followed by myalgia (28.0% vs 20.5%), malaise (22.9% vs 20.7%) and 
asthenia (19.7% vs 17.5%). Loss of appetite was reported by 17.0% and 12.4%, drowsiness by 
13.2% and 12.4%, and irritability/fussiness by 12.4% and 9.6%. It should be noted that 
irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, and loss of appetite were part of the infant/toddler panel of AEs that 
was used for subjects <6 years only. The majority of the solicited systemic AEs (within 14 day) were 
considered related with TDV group (35.8% vs 28.2%) and mild in severity. The frequency of severe 
(grade 3) solicited systemic AEs was 4.1% in TDV and 3.5% in placebo group, mainly due to headache 
(2.8% vs 2.4%) and malaise (2% and 1.7%). The time to onset was, mainly, on the day or 1 day after 
the vaccination in both groups and resolved with a median duration of 3-4 days in TDV and 2-3 day in 
placebo groups. 
The incidence of fever was lower in the TDV group (8.9%) than in the placebo group (10.5%). The 
incidence of severe fever (≥Grade 3) was 2.1% in TDV and 3% in placebo. Fever events generally 
resolved within a single day. 
The applicant submitted a table summarising individual vaccine related solicited systemic AEs within 14 
days after the first, the second, and any vaccine dose in the target population 4-60 years of age 
(overall population, Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool), together with corresponding references to source 
data in the dossier. In the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool, the proportion of all subjects (4-60 years) 
reporting vaccine-related solicited systemic events (excluding fever) was higher in the TDV group 
compared with the placebo group (34.2% versus 27.9% of subjects). This numerical difference was 
mainly due to small differences for each systemic AE symptom, rather than due to a large difference 
for specific AE symptoms. After any vaccination, headache (24.4% vs 21.1% of subjects) and myalgia 
(22.8% vs 16.5% of subjects) were the most frequently reported related solicited systemic AEs in both 
groups. Vaccine related fever was not reported by a higher proportion of subjects in the vaccine group 
compared with the placebo group (5.4% versus 6.1% after any vaccination). The systemic AEs 
irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, and loss of appetite were part of the infant/toddler panel of AEs that 
was used for subjects <6 years only. The incidence of irritability/fussiness and loss of appetite were 
numerically only slightly higher in the vaccine group, while the incidence of drowsiness tended to be 
little higher in the placebo group (i.e. irritability/fussiness was reported for 8.6% versus 6.2% of 
subjects, drowsiness by 8.9% versus 9.6% of subjects, and loss of appetite by 11.2% versus 8.4% of 
subjects). Except for fever, vaccine-related solicited systemic AEs were consistently less frequent after 
the second than after the first vaccine dose. The majority of vaccine related systemic AES was mild to 
moderate. Severe solicited systemic ARs were reported for 3.0% of subjects in the vaccine and for 
2.1% in the placebo group. 
Overall, the solicited systemic AEs after the second dose (25.3% in TDV vs 19.7% in placebo) were 
less frequently reported than after the first dose (36.3% vs 30.7%, respectively). The incidence of 
Grade 3 events decreased from first to second vaccine dose in the TDV and placebo groups alike. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 190/254 
 
 
 
 
incidences in the TDV group after the first and second dose were 1.8% and 1.3% for headache, 1.2% 
and 1.0% for malaise, and 1.0% and 0.7% for asthenia, respectively. In addition, for the infant/toddler 
panel, the proportion of subjects with severe (Grade 3) events remained <1% for each individual 
event, and there was no clinically relevant change in severe (Grade 3) events from first to second 
vaccine dose in the TDV and placebo groups. 
Solicited local and systemic prolonged AE in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (4-60 years) 
The incidence of prolonged solicited local (after 7 days) or systemic (after 14 days) AEs was higher in 
the TDV group than in the placebo group (prolonged local AEs: 3.8% in TDV vs 0.6% in Placebo; 
prolonged systemic AEs: 1.9% in TDV vs 1.5% in placebo after any dose). The events were mostly 
mild, and all subjects recovered from these events. Injection site erythema was the most frequent 
prolonged solicited local AE (2.8% vs 0.3%) and the most often recorded prolonged solicited systemic 
AE was headache (1.0% vs 0.9%). 
In the TDV group, the incidence of prolonged solicited local and systemic AEs was lower after the 
second than after the first vaccine dose (prolonged local AEs: 3% after dose 1 and 1.4% after dose 2; 
prolonged systemic AEs: 1.1% after dose 1 and 0.8% after dose 2)   
The majority of these events were mild or moderate in severity. In TDV group, 2 subjects (<0.1%) 
reported severe prolonged local AEs and 1 subject (<0.1%) in placebo. A total of 11 subjects (0.3%) 
reported severe prolonged systemic AEs, and 4 subjects (0.2%) in placebo. No severe events of 
prolonged fever were reported. The median duration of prolonged local ARs was 10 days in the TDV 
vaccine group. 
Solicited adverse events in Children and Adolescents (4-17 years) 
Solicited AE data from placebo-controlled trials were available for a subset of 2,882 participants aged 
4-11 years (1,865 subjects receiving TDV and 1,017 subjects receiving placebo) and 1,733 participants 
aged 12-17 years (1,177 in TDV and 556 in placebo).  
Overall, after any dose, the incidences of solicited local and systemic AEs were higher in the TDV group 
than in the placebo group in both paediatric groups. Higher frequencies of solicited local and systemic 
AEs in subjects aged 12-17 than in subjects aged 4-11 were observed. Additionally, in both age groups 
the incidence of any solicited local and systemic, after the second dose was lower than after the first 
dose (See Table 51). 
The majority of the solicited local and systemic AEs in both age groups were mild. There were no 
clinically important differences regarding the onset or duration of these AEs between the 2 age groups, 
or between the TDV and placebo groups. Most of the AEs started on the day of vaccination or the day 
after and were resolved within 1 to 2 days for solicited local AEs, and within 1 to 3 days for solicited 
systemic AE in most of the subjects (no clinically important differences between TDV and placebo, or 
between the different paediatric age groups).

Solicited Local AE in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (4-17 years) 
Within 30 minutes after any vaccination, the incidence of solicited local AEs observed was higher in the 
TDV group (5.1% in 4-11 years and 8.7% in 12-17 years) than in the placebo group (4.3% and 5.8%, 
respectively) and mainly were due to injection site pain (4-11: 5.0% vs 4.3% and 12-17: 8.5% vs 
5.8%). The solicited local AEs were mostly mild in both age groups and there were no severe events 
within 30 minutes after any dose. 
Up 7 days after any dose, the frequencies of solicited local AEs were 36.5% in TDV vs 25.3% in 
placebo in subjects aged 4-11 years and 45.8% vs 28.0% in 12-17 years, respectively. The most 
frequently solicited local AE was injection site pain in both 4-11 years and 12-17 years group (TDV: 
36.1% and 45.4% vs placebo: 25% and 27.8%, respectively), followed by erythema and swelling. 
Severe solicited local AEs after any dose were reported by 1.0% in 4 to 11 years and 2.1% in 12 to 17 
years in the TDV group, compared with 0.9% and 0.5% in the placebo group respectively 
Solicited Systemic AE in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (4-17 years) 
Different panel of solicited systemic AEs was used for subjects <6 years (infant/toddler panel 
[irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, and loss of appetite]) and subjects aged ≥6 years (adult/children 
panel [headache, myalgia, malaise, and asthenia]). It should be noted, that for a total of 121 children 
aged 4 to <6 years in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (122 in the All Studies Safety Pool) from 
Trials DEN-301, DEN-204, and DEN-203, solicited systemic AEs were recorded erroneously using the 
adult/children panel of symptoms. 
Within 30 minutes after any vaccination, no clinically important differences between the TDV and 
placebo groups were observed (4-11: 0.9% vs 0.8% and 12-17: 2.0% vs 2.0%). These data were 
consistent with the reported in the overall population. Headache was reported most frequently in both 
age groups. All the solicited systemic AE within 30 minutes were mild or moderate, and non-severe 
immediate solicited systemic AEs were reported.   
Up 14 days after any dose, the frequencies of solicited systemic AEs were 39.2% in TDV vs 36.4% in 
placebo in subjects aged 4-11 years and 54.4% vs 45.5% in 12-17 years, respectively.  
In 4 to 11 years of age, the most frequent systemic AE for adult/children panel (subjects ≥6 years: 
1,488 in TDV and 822 in placebo) was headache (27.4% vs 26.9%), followed by myalgia (22.7% vs 
16.2%) and malaise (19.2% vs 17.3%). In the infant/toddler panel (subjects <6 years: 341 in TDV 
and 177 in placebo) loss of appetite (17% vs 12.4%) was the most frequently reported, followed by 
drowsiness (13.2% vs 12.4%) and irritability (12.4% vs 9.6%). Fever was reported by 10.5% and 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

11.6% in TDV and Placebo group, respectively. No case of fever ≥39°C was reported in subjects aged 
4-11 years.  
In 12 to 17 years of age, the most frequent systemic AE was headache (41.4% vs 34.2%), followed by 
myalgia (33.3% vs 27.3%) and malaise (29.8% vs 26.3%). Fever was reported by 10.6% and 10.1% 
of participants in TDV and Placebo group, respectively. No case of fever ≥39°C was reported in 
subjects aged 12-17 years. 
Overall, the incidence of severe solicited systemic AEs in both age group was <2% for each individual 
event after the first or second dose of either TDV or placebo, with exception of headache. For 4-11 
years group, the frequencies of severe headache were 1.3% (vs 1.3% for placebo) after the first 
vaccine dose and 1.1% (vs 0.7% for placebo) after the second vaccine dose and for 12-17years group, 
were 2.7% (vs 2.2% for placebo) and 1.9% (vs 1.9% for placebo), respectively. 
Prolonged solicited local and systemic AEs in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (4-17 years) 
The incidence of prolonged AEs after any dose was higher in the 12 to 17 years age group (prolonged 
local AEs: 2.5% in TDV vs 0.5% in Placebo; prolonged systemic AEs: 2.3% in TDV vs 2.7% in placebo) 
than in the 4 to 11 years age group (prolonged local AEs: 0.9% in TDV vs 0.6% in Placebo; prolonged 
systemic AEs: 1.4% in TDV vs 0.8% in placebo). In both age groups, the incidence of prolonged 
solicited local and systemic AEs in the TDV groups was lower after the second than after the first 
vaccine dose. 
In both paediatric age groups, the majority of the prolonged solicited local AEs were mild. Severe 
prolonged local AEs were observed in 2 subjects (prolonged injection site erythema in a 13-year-old 
subject in the TDV group and a 4-year-old subject in the placebo group). 
The majority of the prolonged solicited systemic AEs were mild or moderate in severity. In the 4 to 11 
years age group, 3 subjects in the TDV group (0.2%) and 0 in placebo had severe prolonged AEs. In 
the 12 to 17 years age group, 6 subjects in the TDV group (0.5%) and 4 subjects in the placebo group 
(0.7%) had severe prolonged AEs.  
Solicited adverse events in Adults (18-60 years) 
Solicited AE data from placebo-controlled trials were available for a subset of 940 participants (788 
subjects receiving TDV and 152 subjects receiving placebo). The incidence of solicited local and 
systemic AEs, including solicited events within 30 minutes after vaccination, was higher in the TDV 
group than in the placebo group. The majority of the solicited local and systemic AEs were mild. 
Additionally, the incidence of any solicited local and systemic after the second dose was lower than 
after the first dose (See Table 52). 
The solicited local AEs reported by adults started most frequently on the day of vaccination and the 
solicited systemic AEs started most frequently within 1 to 2 days. The median duration of solicited local 
AEs were longer in the TDV (4 days) than in placebo (1 day) group. In addition, the solicited systemic 
AEs were mainly resolved within 3 days for most of the adults.

DEN-205 (TDV group), and DEN-203 (placebo group only because the trial investigated HD TDV). DEN-106 (although included in the 
All Studies Safety Pool) is not included since it investigated HD TDV (not TDV) and had no separate placebo arm. 
Solicited local AEs include injection site pain, erythema, and swelling.  
Solicited systemic events may include headache, myalgia, malaise, and asthenia (adult/children panel) as well as 
irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, and loss of appetite (infant/toddler panel), and fever (both panels). 
Related AEs: Solicited local AEs were considered to be related by default. For solicited systemic related AEs, the investigator 
assessed the event as related to trial vaccine. Note: Relatedness was not recorded in Trial DEN-203. 
Solicited Local AE in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool Adults (18-60 years) 
Within 30 minutes after any dose, the incidence of any solicited local AEs was 2.5% in the TDV group 
and 0.7% in the placebo group, injection site pain being the most frequently reported in both groups 
(2.0% vs 0.7%, respectively). 
Up 7 days after any dose, the frequencies of solicited local AEs were 56.3% in TDV and 19.0% in 
placebo. The most frequent solicited local AE after any dose reported was injection site pain (50% vs 
18.4%), followed by erythema (26.5% vs 0.7) and swelling (8.9% vs 0.7%).  
The solicited local AEs were mostly mild and transient. The frequency of severe local AEs was 0.8% in 
TDV (all for injection site pain) and 0 in placebo. 
Solicited Systemic AE in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (18-60 years) 
Within 30 minutes after any dose, the incidence of any solicited systemic AEs was 1.4% in the TDV 
group; there were no events in the placebo group. Except for 1 headache AE of moderate severity, the 
other systemic AEs within 30 minutes reported were mild in severity. Fever was reported by 0.1% (1 
subject) in TDV and no case in placebo group.  
Up 14 days after any dose, the frequencies of solicited systemic AEs were 49.7% in TDV and 45.6% in 
placebo. Headache and myalgia were the most frequent solicited systemic AEs reported after any dose 
in TDV (35% and 30.5%) and placebo (33.3% and 19.7%) group, followed by malaise (19.6 in TDV vs 
17.5% in placebo) and asthenia (17.2% in TDV vs 14.3% in placebo). The majority of these events 
were mild and transient. The frequency of severe solicited systemic AEs were 4.0% in the TDV and 
1.4% in the placebo group. Fever was reported by 2.8% in TDV and 4.8% in placebo. Of these, 0.5% 
in TDV and 2.7% in placebo reported fever ≥39°C.

Solicited local and systemic prolonged AEs in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (18-60 years) 
In adults, the incidence of prolonged solicited local and systemic AEs was higher in the TDV group than 
in the placebo group (prolonged solicited local: 12.6% in TDV vs 0.8% in placebo, prolonged systemic 
AEs: 2.3% vs 0.8% respectively). The incidence of prolonged solicited local and systemic AEs in adults 
in the TDV groups was lower after the second than after the first vaccine dose. 
The prolonged solicited local and systemic AEs were mostly mild in severity. Only 1 subject in TDV 
group reported 1 severe solicited prolonged local injection site pain, and no prolonged fever was 
reported.  
Unsolicited adverse events 
Unsolicited adverse events in target population (4-60 years) 
The incidence of unsolicited AEs, including any AEs and any SAEs reported up to 28 days after any 
vaccine dose, revealed no clinically important differences between the TDV and placebo groups (21.3% 
vs 22.8%, respectively). The frequencies of severe unsolicited AEs were 0.5% in TDV and 0.2% in 
placebo.  
The majority of unsolicited AEs were considered as not related to the trial vaccine and most were mild 
or moderate in severity The incidence of related unsolicited AEs was higher in the TDV group (3.0%) 
than in the placebo group (1.7%). Of these, 0.1% (5 subjects) in TDV and <0.1% (1 subjects) were 
severe unsolicited related AE. No related unsolicited AEs (within 28 days after any vaccination) were 
considered as SAE. 
The unsolicited AEs by SOC most frequently reported was infections and infestations in both groups 
(13.4% in TDV and 16.3% in placebo after any vaccine dose), followed by General disorders and 
administration site conditions (2.8% vs 1.7%) and Gastrointestinal disorders (2% and 1.5%). 
At the PT level, the most frequently reported unsolicited AEs in both groups were nasopharyngitis 
(2.6% vs 3.2% of subjects) and upper respiratory tract infection (2.3% vs 3.4% of subjects). The only 
unsolicited AEs reported by ≥0.5% of subjects that were reported with ≥2-fold higher incidences in the 
TDV group than in the placebo group were injection site bruising (0.7% vs <0.1% of subjects) and 
injection site pruritus (0.7% of subjects vs no subjects). Of note, all of these events were reported by 
adult subjects (Table 53). A table containing all unsolicited AEs included into the placebo-controlled 
safety pool, irrespective of causality, did not reveal any safety signal. A numerical imbalance was 
observed for the AEs rhinitis (1 subject, <0.1% in the placebo, and 8 subjects, 0.2% in the TDV 
group), and abdominal pain (recorded by 1 subject, <0.1% and 8 subjects, 0.2%).

Trials included for TDV and placebo groups: DEN-301, DEN-304, DEN-315, DEN-204 (Group 1 and Group 4, data up to Month 12), and DEN-
203 (placebo group only because the trial investigated HD TDV).  
(a) 
In Trials DEN-301 and DEN-204, unsolicited AEs up to 28 days after each vaccine dose were recorded in the randomly selected 
immunogenicity subset only.  
Regarding related unsolicited AEs, injection site bruising and pruritus were the most frequently 
reported, followed by pyrexia (0.2% vs 0.2%) and systemic viral infection, fatigue and headache 
(<0.1% vs 0.2%) in all PT.  
By PT, the grade 3 related unsolicited AEs in TDV were one case of myalgia, anhedonia, malaise, upper 
tract infection and pyrexia; in the placebo group the grade 3 related unsolicited AEs was pyrexia.  
There was 1 additional severe and related AE of severe vomiting in the TDV group of the All Studies 
Safety Pool. 
Unsolicited adverse events in Children and Adolescents (4-17 years) 
The incidence of unsolicited AEs showed no clinically important differences between the TDV and 
placebo groups and between the 2 age groups (4-11 and 12-17 years). In aged group 4 to 11 the 
incidence of unsolicited AEs was 19.1% in TDV and 23.2% in placebo. In the group aged 12 to 17 the 
incidences were 23.9% and 22.1%, respectively. The frequencies of severe (Grade 3) unsolicited AEs 
in subjects aged 4-11 were 0.4% in TDV vs <0.1% in placebo and in subjects aged 12-17, 0.4% in 
TDV and 0 in placebo.  
A majority of these events were considered as not related to the trial vaccine (in 4-11: 1% in TDV vs 
1% in placebo and in 12-17: 1.6% vs 2.3%, respectively were considered as related). Three related 
Severe AEs were reported by 3 subjects from the 4-11 years group (pyrexia and upper respiratory 
tract infection in the TDV group, and pyrexia in the placebo group). There were no severe and related 
AEs reported in the 12 to 17 years age group. No related unsolicited AEs (within 28 days after any 
vaccination) were considered as SAE. 
The majority of unsolicited AEs were reported by SOC infections and infestations in both age groups (in 
4-11:  15.1% vs 17.9%, and in 12-17: 15.2% vs 15.3%), followed by gastrointestinal disorders (in 4-
11:  1% vs 1.5%, and in 12-17: 3.1% vs 0.9%). The rest of unsolicited AEs by SOC were reported by 
≤1.5% in both ages and vaccine groups. 
At the PT level, the most frequently reported unsolicited AE in both age groups was nasopharyngitis, 
followed by upper respiratory tract infection (4-11 years) or viral upper respiratory tract infection (12-
17 years), with no clinically important differences between the TDV and placebo groups. The only 
unsolicited AEs reported by ≥0.5% of subjects and with ≥2-fold higher incidences in the TDV group than 
in the placebo group were reported only in the 12 to 17 years age group: abdominal pain (0.6% vs 0), 
diarrhoea (0.6% vs 0), gastritis (0.5% vs 0), and vomiting (0.5% vs 0).

Unsolicited adverse events in Adults (18-60 years) 
The incidence of any unsolicited AEs after any vaccine dose showed no clinically important differences 
between the TDV and placebo group in adults (22.5% vs 23.0%) while the incidence of unsolicited AEs 
considered to be related to the trial vaccine was higher in the TDV group (9.6% vs 4.6% of subjects). 
Most of these unsolicited AEs were mild or moderate in severity. The incidences of severe unsolicited 
AEs were 0.8% in TDV and 1.3% in placebo. Of these, a 0.4% in TDV was considered as related severe 
unsolicited AEs, but none were reported in the placebo group. No related unsolicited AE was considered 
SAE. 
By SOC, the most frequently unsolicited AEs reported was general disorders and administration site 
conditions (8.4% vs 4.6%). The incidence of AEs in most other frequently reported SOC was 
numerically lower in the TDV group than in the placebo group (<7% in TDV vs <9.5% in placebo).

group), and DEN-203 (placebo group only because the trial investigated HD TDV). DEN-106 (although included in the All Studies Safety Pool) 
is not included since it investigated HD TDV (not TDV) and had no separate placebo arm. 
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Overall, 20 deaths occurred throughout the clinical program, and none was related to vaccine 
administration. Of the 20 deaths, 12 deaths occurred up to database lock for the pooled analyses and 
8 deaths occurred in Trial DEN 301 after database lock for the pooled analysis (during the period 25-36 
months [5 deaths] and post 36 months [3 deaths]). 
Of the 12 deaths, 6 deaths (0.04%) occurred in the TDV group and 4 (0.05%) in the placebo group. 
Two additional deaths from the TDV group were not included because 1 subject was aged <4 years 
(Trial DEN-204, death from septic shock) and 1 subject received a sequential dose of YF vaccine (Trial 
DEN-305, death from cardiac arrest).  
Serious adverse events in the target population (4-60) 
For both analysis pools, >95% of all SAEs occurred >30 days after the first or the second vaccine 
dose, and the majority resolved within 1 to 2 weeks. The overall incidence of SAEs (Placebo-Controlled 
Safety Pool) was lower in the TDV group than in the placebo group (4.60% in TDV vs 5.57% in 
placebo). Expressed as follow-up time adjusted SAE rates per 100 person-years (FTAR), the incidence

rate was 2.84 in the TDV group and 3.26 in the placebo group after any vaccine dose. In the 
supportive All Studies Safety Pool, the corresponding incidence rates were consistent with those of the 
placebo-controlled pool.  
In the TDV and placebo groups of both analysis pools, SAEs were most frequently reported from the 
SOC infections and infestations.  
At the PT level, SAEs reported with a higher incidence in the TDV group than in the placebo group were 
gastroenteritis (0.25% vs 0.17%), asthma (0.12% vs 0.06%), cellulitis (0.11% vs 0.03%), and lower 
respiratory tract infection (0.10% vs 0.06%). None of these SAEs was considered to be related to TDV 
by the investigator. The results for the All Studies Safety Pool were consistent with those for the 
Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool. 
There was a single, non-fatal related SAE in TDV (suspected dengue illness, not VCD), compared with 
4 related SAE cases in the placebo group (hypersensitivity in 2 subjects, dengue fever, DHF). The 
related SAE in the TDV group (Trial DEN-301) was reported by a baseline dengue seropositive teenage 
female. The event started on Day 12 after the first vaccine dose, the subject was hospitalized, and was 
considered as related based on the temporal association with the expected time window of vaccine 
viraemia. The sponsor also considered the event as possibly related. The central laboratory RT PCR 
test was negative for wild-type dengue. However, because the subject was afebrile, no blood sample 
was collected to test for vaccine viraemia. The event resolved within 5 days. The case was not referred 
to the DCAC because this suspected dengue illness was not a VCD. 
Serious adverse events in children and adolescents (4-17) 
In both paediatric age groups, the incidences of any SAEs were lower in the TDV than in the placebo 
groups (4-11: 5.04% in TDV vs 5.75% in placebo and 12-17: 4.17% vs 5.38%). 
No SAE was reported as related to TDV in age group 4- to 11 years. One non-fatal related SAE 
(suspected non-confirmed dengue illness) was reported in age group 12-17 years in TDV vs 4 in 
placebo. 
At the PT level, SAEs in age group 4-11 that were reported with a ≥2-fold higher incidence in the TDV 
group than in the placebo group were asthma (0.17% vs 0.04%), lower respiratory tract infections 
(0.13% vs 0.06%), humerus fracture (0.14% vs 0.06%), cellulitis (0.13% vs 0.04%), lymphadenitis 
(0.10% vs 0.02%), and road traffic accident (0.05% vs 0). In the 12 to 17 years age group, 
pneumonia (0.09% vs 0.04%), cellulitis (0.09% vs 0), road traffic accident (0.11% vs 0.04%), and 
lymphadenitis (0.06% vs 0) were reported with a ≥2-fold higher incidence in the TDV group than in the 
placebo group. For either age group, none of these SAEs with a notably higher incidence in the TDV 
group were considered to be related to TDV by the investigator. 
Serious adverse events in adults (18-60) 
In both, the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool, and the All Studies Safety Pool, the overall incidence of 
any SAE irrespective of causality was comparable in the TDV and the placebo group. Slightly lower 
incidence of SAEs was reported in the TDV than in placebo group (2.03% vs 2.63%). The incidence of 
SAEs after any vaccine dose was 4.17 and 4.90 events per 100 person-years in the TDV and placebo 
group, respectively.  No SAEs were reported that were considered to be related to trial vaccine. 
Medically Attended Adverse Events  
MAAE data are available from 1088 subjects who received TDV and from 231 subjects who received 
placebo aged 12-60 years (from DEN-304 and DEN-3015) for the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool. No 
MAAE data is available from children in the 4 to 11 years age group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 199/254 
 
 
 
 
The overall incidence of MAAEs showed no clinically important difference between the TDV and placebo 
groups. Expressed as MAAEs per 100 person-years to adjust for differences in duration of follow-up 
(FTAR), the overall incidence of MAAEs was 56.4 events per 100 person-years in the TDV group and 
53.0 events per 100 person-years in the placebo group. Higher incidences were observed in 
adolescents than in adults in TDV group (110.0 versus 34.4 events per 100 person-years after any 
vaccine dose) and in placebo group (78.7 versus 32.1 events per 100 person-years after any vaccine 
dose.  
In All Studies Safety Pool, the MAAEs per FTAR in TDV (70.4 per 100 person-year) was higher than in 
Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (56.4 per 100 person-years). The imbalance could be explained by the 
fact that the 190 children aged 4 to 11 years in the TDV group of the All Studies Safety Pool had a high 
rate of 194.5 MAAEs per 100 person-years. The FATAR in adolescent and Adults were similar in both 
pools. 
The majority of all MAAEs were not related to trial vaccine in both pools (related: ≤0.9% of subjects) 
and were mild or moderate in severity. The incidence of related MAAEs was similar between the TDV 
and placebo groups. However, the incidence of severe MAAEs was higher in the TDV group than in the 
placebo group in both analysis pools. None of these severe MAAEs was related to trial vaccine, and 
subjects fully recovered except for 4 subjects (back pain, pneumonia, hepatitis C, and wrist fracture 
who were still recovering at the time of database lock). Additionally, one MAAE (moderate pain in 
extremity) led to vaccine and trial discontinuation after the first TDV dose in DEN-304. 
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Including Hospitalized VCD and Severe Forms of Dengue 
The approach to assess severe forms of dengue varied across trials, and therefore, this evaluation was 
not part of the pooled safety analysis. The evaluation of VCD cases, including hospitalized VCD cases 
and severe forms of dengue, from the safety perspective was based primarily on the data from pivotal 
Trial DEN-301. Data from Trials DEN-204 and DEN-313 were considered as supportive because no 
predefined dengue severity criteria were used. 
In the pivotal Trial DEN-301, all subjects presenting with febrile illness or presenting with clinical 
symptoms of dengue were centrally assessed for VCD by serotype-specific RT-PCR. 
Among all cases of VCD, severe forms of dengue were determined in 2 different ways: 
• 
All hospitalized VCD cases evaluated for classification as severe dengue by the blinded DCAC 
(using severe dengue DCAC predefined criteria). All non-hospitalized VCD cases were 
considered non-severe. 
• 
All VCD cases meeting the WHO 1997 criteria for DHF, were identified using a programmed 
algorithm (without applying medical judgment) and including DHF of Grade I-IV. 
Initially, the applicant submitted the data of VCD, including hospitalised VCD cases, and severe forms 
of dengue up to 12, 24 and 36 months after the second dose caused by all serotypes.  However, the 
applicant submitted only the data of VCD, including hospitalized VCD caused by DEN-3.  During 
assessment, the applicant submitted overall VCD data (all serotypes together) up to 54 months after 
the second dose and the cases of hospitalizations and severe forms of dengue caused by DENV-3 and 
DENV-4 in seronegative subjects at baseline. Also, the applicant submitted new summary tables from 
DEN-301 including data of VCD, hospitalized cases and severe forms up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 months 
after the second dose caused by all serotypes combined or by each serotype individually, in the overall 
population or by baseline serostatus.

Virologically confirmed dengue including hospitalised VCD cases, all serotypes combined 
Overall, the incidences of VCD and of hospitalized VCD (all 4 serotypes combined) up to 12, 24, 36 and 
54 months after the second vaccine dose were lower in the TDV group versus placebo. Same results 
were observed in the baseline seropositive and seronegative subgroups for all 4 serotypes combined. 
For the overall population, the incidence of VCD were 0.6% in TDV and 3.0% in placebo up to 12 
months after second dose; 1.3% vs 4.6% up to 24 months; 2.9% vs 7.4% up to 36 months; 3.3% vs 
8.2% up to 54 months, respectively (RR of VCD were <0.5 up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 months after the 
second dose). And the incidence of Hospitalized VCD were <0.1% vs 1.0% up to 12 months after 
second dose; 0.1% vs 1.4% up to 24 months; 0.3% vs 1.9% up to 36 months; and 0.3% vs 2.1 up to 
54 months, respectively (RR of hospitalized VCD were <0.2 up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 months after the 
second dose). 
In baseline seropositive subjects, the incidence of VCD were 0.6% in TDV and 3.0% in placebo up to 
12 months after second dose; 1.2% vs 4.7% up to 24 months; 2.7% vs 7.4% up to 36 months; 3.1% 
vs 8.1% up to 54 months, respectively (RR of VCD in seropositive subjects were <0.5 up to 12, 24, 36 
and 54 months after the second dose). And the incidence of Hospitalized VCD were <0.1% vs 0.9% up 
to 12 months after second dose; 0.1% vs 1.3% up to 24 months; 0.3% vs 1.9% up to 36 months; and 
0.3% vs 2.1% up to 54 months, respectively (RR of hospitalized VCD in seropositive subjects were 
<0.2 up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 months after the second dose). 
In baseline seronegative subjects, the incidence of VCD were 0.6% in TDV and 2.9% in placebo up to 
12 months after second dose; 1.5% vs 4.5% up to 24 months; 3.4% vs 7.4% up to 36 months; 3.96% 
vs 8.35% up to 54 months, respectively (RR of VCD in seronegative subjects were <0.5 up to 12, 24, 
36 and 54 months after the second dose). And the incidence of Hospitalized VCD were <0.1% vs 1.1% 
up to 12 months after second dose; 0.2% vs 1.5% up to 24 months; 0.4% vs 1.9% up to 36 months; 
0.46% vs 2.24% up to 54 months, respectively (RR of hospitalized VCD in seronegative subjects were 
≤0.2 up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 months after the second dose).

•  Virologically confirmed dengue including hospitalised VCD cases by DENV-3 
In the overall population, the RR for VCD and for hospitalized VCD by DENV-3 up to 54 months after 
second dose were <1 (including upper limit) in both cases. Depending on baseline serostatus, some 
differences were found. In seropositive subjects the RR for VCD and Hospitalized VCD by DENV-3 were 
<1 (including upper limit), in line with the overall population. However, in seronegative subjects the 
relative risk of VCD (TDV vs placebo, irrespective of hospitalization) caused by DENV-3 was 1.11 (0.62, 
1.99) through month 54. This result, there was also observed up to 12 months (1.60 [0.52, 4.91]), 24 
months (1.37 [0.64, 2.93]) and 36 months after the second dose (1.18 [0.65, 2.16]).

Regarding hospitalized VCD up to 54 months in seronegative subjects, there were 11 cases in the TDV 
group (0.3%) compared with 3 cases in placebo group (0.1%), with a relative risk of 1.81 (95% CI: 
0.51, 6.48). These, data should be interpreted with caution, as there are confounding factors like 
different standards of care at different trial sites like “thresholds for hospitalization” (Sri Lanka site had 
higher hospitalization rates [67.4%] than Philippines [6.6%] and Thailand [44%] and “differences in 
assessment of clinical severity, including methods used to assess plasma leakage and 
thrombocytopenia.” All hospitalized cases of VCD in Sri Lanka were considered mild forms of dengue by 
DCAC (Dengue Case Adjudication Committee) and were not severe based on the DCAC assessment. 
The incidence of VCD and/or hospitalized VCD by DENV-3 was impacted by local epidemiology and 
hospitalization practices. Overall, incidences of VCD (including Sri Lanka) caused by DENV-3 in 
seronegative subjects were 1% in TDV and 0.9% in placebo with RR of 1.11 (95% CI 0.62, 1.99). 
However, incidence of VCD (excluding Sri Lanka) by DENV-3 in seronegative subjects were 0.9% vs 
1% with RR of 0.92 (95% CI 0.50, 1.69), in TDV and placebo respectively.  
In addition, no new hospitalized cases caused by DENV-3 occurred in the TDV group since the last 
interim analysis at the end of Year 3 (36 months post second dose). The incidences of hospitalized VCD 
caused by DENV-3 in baseline seronegative subjects (including Sri Lanka) up 54 months after second 
dose were 11 cases in the TDV group and 3 cases in the placebo group with RR of 1.81 (95% CI 0.51, 
6.48). However, the incidences of hospitalized VCD caused by DENV-3 in baseline seronegative 
subjects (excluding Sri Lanka) were 5 cases in the TDV and 3 cases in the placebo with RR of 0.82 
(95% CI 0.20, 3.42).

Virologically confirmed dengue including hospitalised VCD cases by DENV-4 
In the overall population and in seropositive subjects, the RR for VCD by DENV-4 was <1 (including 
upper limit) up to 54 months after second dose. However, in seronegative subjects, the RR for VCD 
caused by DENV-4 up to 54 months (TDV vs placebo, irrespective of hospitalization) was 1.97 (95% 
CI: 0.56, 6.98) with 12 cases (0.3%) in TDV and 3 cases (0.2%) in placebo). Importantly, 0 of 12 VCD 
cases in the TDV group resulted in hospitalization while 1 of 3 VCD cases in the placebo group was

Severe Forms of Dengue (DCAC-Defined Severe Dengue and DHF)  
In the overall population up to 12 months post second vaccination in the TDV group there were 2 cases 
(0.01%) of DCAC-defined severe Dengue and DHF (1 each) vs 5 cases (0.07%) in placebo (1 DCAC-
defined severe dengue and 4 DHF). Up to 24 months, there were 4 cases (0.03%) in TDV (1 DCAC-
defined severe dengue, 2 DHF and 1 was considered both DCAC-defined severe dengue and DHF) vs 
11 cases (0.16%) in placebo (3 DCAC-defined severe dengue and 8 DHF). Up to 36 months, there 
were 10 cases (0.07%) in TDV (1 DCAC-defined severe dengue, 7 DHF and 2 considered both) and 17 
cases (0.25%) in placebo (4 DCAC-defined severe dengue, 12 DHF and 1 considered both).  
Finally, up to 54 months, there were no additional cases of DCAC-defined severe Dengue and DHF in 
the TDV. However, two new cases (both DHF) were reported in placebo group. Therefore, up to 54 
months, there were 10 cases of DCAC-defined severe Dengue and DHF (0.07%) in TDV and 19 cases 
(0.28%) in placebo.

The relative risk was calculated as the number of events divided by the number of subjects evaluated in the TDV group, 
over the number of events divided by the number of subjects evaluated in the placebo group. 
(a) One baseline seronegative subject in the TDV group had both DCAC-defined severe dengue and DHF 
(refer to DEN-301 54M CSR, Table 11.ggg and Table 11.hhh). 
(b) Two of the 9 subjects in the TDV group had both DCAC-defined severe dengue and DHF (refer to DEN-301 54M CSR, 
Table 11.ggg and Table 11.hhh). 
(c) One of the 13 subjects in the placebo group had both DCAC-defined severe dengue and DHF (refer to DEN-301 54M 
CSR, Table 11.ggg and Table 11.hhh). 
Up to 54 months, the 3 of the 10 severe cases in TDV group were DCAC-defined severe dengue, all of 
them were caused by DENV-3. Two of the 3 cases were in seronegative subjects and one in 
seropositive. In addition, the 5 of the 19 severe cases in placebo group were DCAC-defined severe 
dengue, all of them were in seropositive subjects at baseline (1 case by DENV-1 and DENV-2 and 3 
cases by DENV-3). 
Additionally, of the 9 cases of DHF in TDV group, 4 cases occurred in seronegative subjects (all caused 
by DENV-3) and 5 in seropositive (2 cases by DENV-1 and 3 cases by DENV-3).  In comparison, in the 
placebo group 13 of 15 cases were in seropositive subjects (3 cases by DENV-1, 7 cases by DENV-2, 2 
cases by DENV-3 and 1 case by DENV-4) and 2 in seronegative (1 case by DENV-1 and case by DENV-
3).  
Specifically for the serotype DENV-3, the incidences of DHF (including Sri Lanka) or severe dengue 
caused remained very low at the end of Part 3 (4 versus 1 DHF and 2 versus 0 severe dengue cases in 
the TDV and placebo group, respectively). Considering the impact of dengue case management 
practices in Sri Lanka and the absence of any new hospitalized VCD, DHF and/or severe dengue cases 
by DENV-3 during the last 1.5 years of follow-up in the trial, the data do not indicate worsening or 
increased severity over time. The two cases in TDV recipients that were assessed as severe by the 
DCAC occurred early in the trial during Parts 1 and 2 (i.e., before 18 months post second dose). 
Moreover, no cases of DHF and/or severe dengue were caused by DENV-4 throughout the trial up to 54 
months post second dose 
Supportive information from DEN-204 (1596 subjects in TDV and 198 subjects in placebo groups) 
showed a total of 50 cases of VCD up 48 months after the first dose (2.3% in TDV vs 6.6% in placebo, 
with RR 0.35 [95%IC: 0.19-0.65]). No significant difference of incidence was identified between 
seropositive and seronegative subjects. Of the 50 cases, only 3 were considered a SAE by the sponsor 
(2 in TDV groups and 1 in placebo). Additionally, in 200 subjects received TDV, in the single-arm Trial 
DEN-313, no cases of VCD requiring hospitalization or meeting the WHO 1997 criteria for DHF have 
been reported up to 9 months after the first dose. 
Long-Term Safety Follow-Up  
The long-term safety follow-up data focused on AEs; VCD long-term follow-up data are described in 
the previous section.  
The long-term SAE data from DEN-301 (up to 36 months after second dose) was available for a total of 
20,071 subjects aged 4 to 16 years. There were 13 deaths reported (10 in TDV and 3 in placebo) and 
none was related to trial vaccine. SAEs were reported by 4.8% in TDV and 4.8% in placebo up to 18 
Assessment report

months (single SAE in TDV and 5 SAEs in 4 subjects in Placebo were considered as related) and 2.9% 
vs 3.5% during the period 19-36 month (none considered related SAEs). 
The long-term SAE data from DEN-204 (up to 48 months after first dose) was available for a total of 
1794 subjects aged 2 to 17 years. SAEs were reported by 5.83% in TDV and 5.05% in placebo. None 
of these SAEs was considered to be related to trial vaccine, and the majority of events resolved 
completely. Additionally, no clinically important differences between seropositive and seronegative 
subjects of the TDV groups were observed. 
Vaccine Viraemia 
The vaccine viraemia was evaluated at predefined time points on 775 subjects from 6 different clinical 
trials receiving different vaccine formulations (DEN-101, DEN-102, DEN-103, DEN 104, DEN-203 [Part 
1], and DEN 205). Serum samples were collected at 2-to-3-day intervals after each vaccine dose for 
approximately 3 weeks, depending on the trial design. Moreover, the trials used different routes of 
administration, age ranges, and different grading for severity assessment of AEs. All analyses in every 
single trial were post-hoc, exploratory, and descriptive. Since the integrated (pooled) analyses are 
based on different methods of data collection, post-hoc and descriptive, they should be interpreted 
with caution. 
The majority of subjects in the pooled were therefore dengue seronegative at baseline (495 baseline 
seronegative, 237 baseline seropositive, and 23 subjects’ baseline serostatus unknown).  
The trial DEN-205 was the only trail analysed for vaccine viraemia where one group receiving final TDV 
formulation compared to HD TDV. Vaccine viraemia was observed in 54 of 175 subjects (30.9%) 
receiving final TDV formulation and in 110 of 176 subjects (62.5%) receiving HD TDV. In both groups, 
vaccine viraemia mainly occurred for vaccine strain TDV-2. Viraemia peaked at Day 11 and the mean 
duration of TDV-2 viraemia was similar (4.0 days in TDV vs 4.8 days in HD TDV). Independent of HD 
TDV or TDV use, the incidence of vaccine viraemia was higher in baseline seronegative than in baseline 
seropositive subjects and the mean duration was also longer for seronegative than for seropositive 
subjects in each vaccine group. No difference of reversion of attenuation loci were observed in TDV or 
HD TDV (14.8% and 13.6%, respectively). 
In Trials DEN-101, DEN-102, DEN-103, DEN 104, and DEN 203 (Part 1), sequencing of the viral 
genomes was performed for all 129 subjects with replication-competent vaccine virus; 44 subjects had 
single reversions. Except for a single partial reversion in the NS1 locus in a subject from Trial DEN-104 
(presence of both attenuated and reverted nucleotide), all reversions affected the 5' NCR attenuation 
locus. 
Adverse Events in Subjects With and Without Vaccine Viraemia  
Vaccine viraemia occurred most frequently during the period between 7 and 13 days after the first TDV 
dose and was rarely detected after the second vaccine dose; the incidence of solicited and unsolicited 
AEs in subjects with vaccine viraemia, replication-competent vaccine virus, or reversion of attenuation 
loci was analysed descriptively after the first vaccine dose in 775 subjects with vaccine viraemia and 
418 subjects without vaccine viraemia. 
Regarding solicited AEs, higher incidence of injection site pain, injection site erythema, rash, 
arthralgia, fatigue and fever in viraemic participants (47.4%, 24.4%, 10.2%, 11.4%, 35.8% and 
6.2%, respectively) than non-viraemic (41.7%, 18.5%, 5.9%, 8.2%, 29.4% and 4.8%, respectively) 
receiving different vaccine formulations of TDV. No differences were observed in other solicited AEs 
between viraemic and non-viraemic subjects. Of note, most episodes of rash, fever, and arthralgia in 
viraemic subjects showed a temporal relationship with viraemia.  
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 209/254 
 
 
 
 
Additionally, in viraemic subjects there was difference in the incidence in some solicited AEs between 
with/without replication-competent vaccine virus. Solicited AEs with a ≥2-fold higher incidence in 
viremic subjects with replication-competent vaccine virus than in subjects without replication-
competent vaccine virus included fatigue (23.4% vs 11.1%), myalgia (13.3% vs 4.8%), arthralgia 
(10.2% vs 4.8%), nausea (7.8% vs 2.4%), and photophobia (7.8% vs 3.2%) 
Regarding subjects with or without attenuation locus, solicited AEs with a ≥2-fold higher incidence in 
subjects with reversion in attenuation locus compared with those without reversion included pain at the 
injection site (7 of 43 subjects [16.3%] vs 4 of 85 subjects [4.7%]), arthralgia (7 of 43 subjects 
[16.3%] vs 6 of 85 subjects [7.1%]), fever (3 of 43 subjects [7.0%] vs 3 of 85 subjects [3.5%]), 
nausea (6 of 43 subjects [14.0%] vs 4 of 85 subjects [4.7%]), and vomiting (1 of 43 subjects [2.3%] 
vs none of 85 subjects).  
Regarding unsolicited AEs, higher incidence was observed in viraemic participants (62.0%) than in 
non-viraemic (52.1%). Unsolicited AEs reported by ≥5% of subjects and with approximately ≥2-fold 
higher incidences in subjects with than without vaccine viraemia were headache (20.1% vs 10.9%), 
fatigue (11.2% vs 3.1%), myalgia (8.9% vs 3.1%), arthralgia (6.0% vs 2.0%), nausea (6.0% vs 
3.4%), and upper respiratory tract infection (5.0% vs 3.4%). In addition, most episodes of rash 
(75.0%) and all episodes (100%) of rash erythematous, rash papular, rash maculo-papular, rash 
generalized, rash macular, and rash pruritic showed a temporal relationship with vaccine viraemia. The 
incidence of rash (PT) was 3.8% vs 1.4% in subjects with and without viraemia. 
Higher incidence of unsolicited AEs in subjects with replication-competent vaccine virus or with 
reversion in attenuation locus than in subjects without replication-competent vaccine virus or without 
reversion in attenuation locus. Unsolicited AEs with a ≥2-fold higher incidence were fatigue (in both), 
myalgia (in replication-competent vaccine virus) and arthralgia (in reversion in attenuation locus).  
Vaccine Viraemia and Febrile Illness 
In Trial DEN-301, subjects presenting with febrile illness within 30 days after each dose of trial vaccine 
were assessed for the presence of vaccine viraemia.  
Vaccine viraemia was detected in 34 of 479 febrile illness subjects (7.1%) after the first TDV dose and 
in 1 of 503 subjects (0.2%) after the second vaccine dose. Most of viraemic case occur between 7 and 
13 days after the first vaccine dose. Subjects with febrile illness and with vaccine viraemia detected 
showed a similar pattern of symptoms as those with febrile illness but without vaccine viraemia. In 
addition, the incidence of vaccine viraemia with febrile illness was higher in baseline seronegative than 
in baseline seropositive subjects (8.9% vs 6.5%). 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Routine laboratory safety data (haematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis) were recorded in the 5 
phase 1 trials and in 2 phase 2 trials, DEN-203 and DEN-106. Of note, none of these trials used the 
final formulation TDV intended for commercial lots. 
The assessment of changes from baseline, individual subjects’ shift data, and clinically significant 
abnormalities revealed no clinically important changes of laboratory parameters from baseline and no 
clinically important differences between the various TDV formulations assessed and placebo. Abnormal 
test results for parameters of special relevance in the context of the symptomatology associated with 
dengue fever, such as platelet count, haematocrit, or liver function tests, were infrequently reported, 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 210/254 
 
 
 
 
 
with no differences between any TDV and placebo, and did not reveal any relevant trends or potential 
safety risks.  
Because these data did not indicate any consistent pattern of vaccine-related abnormalities, safety 
objectives related to clinical laboratory analyses were not included in the subsequent phase 2 and 
phase 3 trials, and no pooling of clinical laboratory data of the 5 phase 1 and 2 phase 2 trials was 
performed. 
2.6.8.5.  Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy and Lactation 
TDV has not been studied in pregnant women because pregnancy was an exclusion criterion in all 
clinical trials. However, there were limited data of vaccine administration in women who were pregnant 
or who became pregnant shortly after vaccination. 
As of 01 October 2020, a total of 405 pregnancies were reported by 374 women who participated in 
clinical phase 2 and phase 3 trials. The majority of these pregnancies (84.2%) occurred in subjects 
from pivotal Trial DEN 301 and the 78.8% of pregnancies were in seropositive at baseline women. 
Most of the pregnancies were considered as non-exposed (89.1%), i.e., the last menstrual period had 
occurred ≥6 weeks after a dose of trial vaccine and thus beyond the typical period for vaccine viraemia. 
There were 44 pregnancies receiving vaccine at any time between 6 weeks before the last menstrual 
period up to the outcome of pregnancy. Most had a normal outcome (79.4% in any TDV group and 
50.0% in placebo). Spontaneous abortions were reported in 11.8% of pregnancies, and no differences 
in frequencies were observed between women exposed to any TDV and placebo.  
In addition, there were 8 women who became pregnant during the trial and had births with neonatal 
deaths, all from Trial DEN-301 (including the 4 women who discontinued the trial due to pregnancy). 
One neonatal death (TDV group) occurred after an exposed pregnancy, and the remaining 7 cases 
(TDV group 1, placebo group 3; vaccination group still blinded for 3 cases) occurred after non-exposed 
pregnancies. None of the neonatal deaths were assessed as causally related to TDV. 
It is unknown whether TDV is excreted in human milk. There are limited data on the excretion of wild-
type dengue via breast milk. In a small study, dengue virus was detected in breast milk samples from 
9 (75%) of 12 infected breastfeeding mothers. 
Intrinsic Factors 
Age group 
The data for the different age groups within the proposed target population (4-60 years) are presented 
in detail in the previous section.  
Additional data for 401 subjects aged <4 years from Trial DEN-204 did no shown important safety 
finding and overall safety profile of TDV was considered satisfactory. High variability of the incidence of 
solicited AEs was observed in different vaccination regimen. The majority of solicited and unsolicited 
AEs were mild or moderate in severity. SAEs were reported by 6.5% participants receiving at least one 
dose of TDV and 1 death in placebo group. None of these events was considered related to trail 
vaccine.

In Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool baseline serostatus information was available for 21,318 subjects. Of 
these, 14,783 were seropositive subjects (9,808 received TDV and 4,975 received placebo) and 6,535 
seronegative subjects (4,472 TDV and 2,063 placebo). 
Overall solicited AEs, including AEs within 30 minutes and prolonged solicited AEs, and unsolicited AEs 
in TDV were more frequently in higher in seronegative than in seropositive. The frequencies of solicited 
local AEs were 51.9% in seronegative and 36.2% in seropositive; the frequencies of solicited systemic 
were 50.1% in seronegative and 42.6% in seropositive and the frequencies of unsolicited AEs were 
23.7% in seronegative and 19.0% in seropositive (of theses 0.7% and 0.3% were considered related, 
respectively). 
The difference observed of solicited local and unsolicited AEs were most pronounced in adolescent 
group. The results observed are driven by adolescents from Trial DEN 315 who predominantly were 
seronegative (Mexico City) and generally reported higher rate of solicited local AEs and unsolicited than 
the adolescent subjects from pivotal Trial DEN-301.  
Gender 
In the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool, 10,954 subjects were male (7,295 in TDV and 3,659 in placebo) 
and 10,840 were female (7,332 in TDV and 3,508 in placebo). 
Overall solicited AEs, including AEs within 30 minutes and prolonged solicited AEs, and unsolicited AEs 
were more commonly experienced by female subjects. The frequencies of solicited local AEs in TDV 
were 52.3% in female and 34.0% in male; the frequencies of solicited systemic were 51.4% in female 
and 40.5% in male and the frequencies of unsolicited AEs were 23.2% in female and 19.1% in male 
(of theses 4.2% and 1.7% were considered related, respectively). 
The incidences of solicited and unsolicited AEs in male and female subjects followed the pattern 
observed in the overall target population. 
Race 
No clinically important differences were noted between the AE profile observed in Asian, American 
Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, and White subjects. The only notable difference 
was that solicited local AEs (pain, erythema, swelling) were reported more frequently by White 
subjects (mainly adults from the US and the United Kingdom) than by the other race subgroups.  
The other race subgroups (Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, Multiracial or Other, and 
Unknown) were too small to reach any conclusion. 
Extrinsic Factors 
Endemic and non-endemic 
The solicited local AEs in TDV appeared to be more frequently reported in subjects from non-endemic 
regions (60.4%/59.5% after any dose) than by subjects from endemic regions (36.7%/36.8% after 
any dose). However, the underlying reasons for this finding data are probably the different age group 
distributions in both subgroups (endemic subgroup dominated by children and adolescents from Trial 
DEN-301 and non-endemic subgroup comprised adult subjects from Trial DEN-304 and adolescents 
from Trial DEN-315). In contrast, the evaluation of unsolicited AEs and SAE revealed no clinically 
important differences between the TDV in the subjects from endemic and non-endemic regions. 
Unsolicited AEs of injection site bruising and injection site pruritus were reported mainly in subjects 
from non-endemic regions.

Region and countries 
In Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool there were 919 participants from North America (all US), 11,769 
from Latin America and 7,036 from Asia Pacific. The age distribution by region was different, in North 
America there were only adults, and in Latin America and Asia Pacific were mainly children and 
adolescents (range of 65.7%-68.3% aged 4-11 and range of 31.4%-34.3% aged 11-17) with only 
<0.5% adult participants in placebo group.  
The incidence of solicited local AES was higher in TDV participants from North America (56.3%) than 
from Latin America (43.2%) and Asia Pacific (35.5%). The incidence of related unsolicited AEs was also 
higher in participants from North America (9.6%) than from Latin America (1.1%) and Asia Pacific 
(1.4%). No clinically important differences were identified regarding the safety profile of TDV in the 
different regions.  
Of note, participants from Europe were in All Studies Safety Pool (300 adult subjects from United 
Kingdom only) and reported solicited local AEs similar to the US subjects. 
Previous Flavivirus vaccination 
In Placebo-controlled Safety Pool, approximately 40% of subjects had documented previous 
vaccination against YF or JE (6,060 in TDV and 2,995 in placebo) compared to approximately 60% no 
previously vaccinated (8,597 and 4,172, respectively). The age distribution by previous flavivirus 
vaccination was different, adult participants were limited and only in not-previous vaccinated (9.2% in 
TDV vs 3.6% in placebo). 
No clinically important differences in TDV were identified regarding the incidence of solicited local 
(41.5% in previously vaccinated and 44.3% not previously vaccinated) and systemic AEs (46.5% and 
45.9%, respectively) in subjects with and without previous flavivirus vaccinations. However, 
differences of frequencies of unsolicited AEs were observed in subjects with and without previous 
flavivirus vaccinations (16.4% and 23.5%, respectively).   
2.6.8.6.  Immunological events 
For either of the analysis pools, no vaccine-related anaphylactic reactions or anaphylactic shock events 
were reported within 28 days after vaccine dosing (there was 1 unrelated, serious, and severe 
anaphylactic reaction after ingestion of mefenamic acid starting 18 days after the second TDV dose).  
For both analysis pools, the incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was ≤0.1% for both TDV and 
placebo recipients. None of these hypersensitivity events was serious or severe or considered to be 
related to trial vaccine. 
2.6.8.7.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Co-administration of TDV with YF and HAV vaccines was evaluated in 2 phase 3 trials, DEN-305 and 
DEN-314.  
In DEN-305, solicited local AEs after the first dose in the co-administration group (TDV plus YF) were 
reported by 160 of 282 participants (56.7%) compared to 140 of 185 participants (49.1%) receiving 
TDV plus placebo or 53 of 289 participants (18.3%) receiving YF vaccine plus placebo. Similar pattern 
was observed for solicited systemic AEs, although group differences were less pronounced (52.1%, 
51.2% and 43.6%, respectively). And no clinically important differences between groups were noted 
regarding the incidence and profile of unsolicited AEs. The proportion of subjects with any SAEs was 
low and none was considered as related. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 213/254 
 
 
 
 
In DEN-314, solicited local AEs after the first dose in the co-administration group (TDV plus HAV) were 
reported by 196 of 258 participants (68.8%) compared to 152 of 292 participants receiving TDV plus 
placebo (52.1%) or 141 of 289 participants receiving HAV vaccine plus placebo (48.8%). Similar 
pattern was observed in solicited systemic AEs (49.5%, 45.2% and 48.1%, respectively). And no 
clinically important differences between groups were noted regarding the incidence and profile of 
unsolicited AEs. The proportion of subjects with any SAEs was low and none was considered as related. 
2.6.8.8.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool, the incidence of AEs leading to vaccine and/or trial 
discontinuation was ≤0.20% in both groups (TDV 0.16% or 0.12%, placebo 0.13% or 0.11%). Results 
for the supportive All Studies Safety Pool were consistent with the results based on the Placebo-
Controlled Safety Pool. Most events occurred in 1 subject only and were considered as not related to 
trial vaccine. 
In TDV, 6 subjects had 8 related AEs leading to vaccine discontinuation (of these, 3 subjects 
discontinued the trial) compared with 2 subjects with 3 events in placebo (of these, 1 discontinued the 
trial). The incidence of AEs leading to vaccine and/or trial discontinuation that were considered to be 
related by the investigator was <0.1% for both groups. The majority of these AE were no serious or 
severe, except for 2 SAEs of hypersensitivity in the placebo group and 1 non-serious but severe AE of 
myalgia in the TDV group. 
The following AEs in the TDV group leading to trial or vaccine discontinuation were considered being 
vaccine related by the investigator: Rash pruritic, angioedema, arthralgia, injection site pruritus, 
myalgia, and urticaria. 
2.6.8.9.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data were available for this application. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Eighteen trials (7 phase 3 trials, 6 phase 2 trials, and 5 phase 1 trials) with overall more than 27,000 
subjects from dengue-endemic and non-endemic regions, covering an age range from 1.5 to 60 years, 
were used for the overall safety evaluation of TDV. Nonetheless, only phase 2 and 3 trials were pooled 
for safety assessment, as the time points and main safety endpoints remained similar in these trials. 
Two different safety analysis pools were created from phase 2/3 trials: “Placebo-Controlled Safety 
Pool” from 5 randomised placebo-controlled clinical trials and supportive “All Studies Safety Pool” from 
10 clinical trials.  
The integrated evaluation of the safety profile of TDV in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool was based 
on 22,002 subjects (mainly from pivotal Phase 3 trial DEN-301, randomised 2:1, aged 4-60) (14,627 
subject who received at least 1 dose of TDV and 7167 subjects who received at least 1 dose of 
placebo). A total of 25,236 subjects aged 4-60, were evaluated in the All Studies Safety Pool as 
supportive safety data. The analysis of solicited and unsolicited AEs recorded for TDV compared with 
placebo within the placebo-controlled safety pool has been performed only in a subset of 5,555 
participants (3,830 subjects receiving TDV and 1,725 subjects receiving placebo). 
The methodology for safety analysis was descriptive; safety parameters pooled in the assessment were 
solicited AEs, including immediate AEs and prolonged solicited AEs, unsolicited AEs, SAEs, MAAES, and 
AEs Leading to Vaccine and/or Trial Discontinuation. The pooling method is deemed appropriate to 
Assessment report

allow consistent evaluation of AEs and the safety profile of TDV in the target population. The applicant 
submitted an overview and summary of the different severity assessment definitions used for recording 
the solicited local adverse events and the different panels for assessment of solicited systemic AEs in 
toddlers and young children (<6 years) versus older children (≥6 years) and adults. The rational for 
adapting the severity assessment criteria for the two age ranges is appropriate and it could be agreed. 
Moreover, it can be concurred that the adapted diameter criteria erythema and swelling for the <6-
year-old age group is conservative and any bias that might be introduced would not favor TDV. The 
severity criteria used to assess solicited AEs during the TDV trials paralleled the criteria used in clinical 
trials of the approved CYD-TDV dengue vaccine, although different age cut-off ranges were used in the 
CYD-TDV dengue vaccine. In summary, the explanation and assessment of the applicant is 
comprehensive.   
The evaluation of VCD, including severe dengue, vaccine viraemia, and clinical laboratory tests were 
not part of the pooled safety analysis. The VCD was evaluated in pivotal trial DEN-301, the vaccine 
viraemia was evaluated mainly in DEN-205 and the reactogenicity was evaluated in a small pool of one 
phase 1 and two phase 2 trials. In addition, the laboratory findings were evaluated in pooled data of 
one phase 1 and two phase 2 trials. 
Demographic and baseline characteristics 
In the overall population in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool, more than 90% of all subjects came 
from the pivotal Trial DEN-301 and were children and adolescents aged 4 to 16 years (20,071 subjects, 
91.2%). There were no important demographic differences between the TDV and placebo groups. Only, 
in the TDV group there was a higher proportion of adults (5.4% vs 2.1%), a higher proportion of white 
participants (6.4% vs 3.5%), a higher proportion of participants from North America (5.4% vs 1.8%) 
and a higher proportion of participants from non-endemic region (7.4% vs 3.2%) than in the placebo 
group. The supportive All Studies Safety Set enlarged the adult sample size; it included 1563 and 314 
adult subjects in the vaccine and the placebo group. Though dominated by paediatric subjects the 
safety data base is deemed adequate for the overall target population. 
Regarding the baseline demographics by age group in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool, in the 2 age 
groups of children (4-11 years) and adolescents (12-17) there were no important differences between 
the TDV and placebo groups.  Of note, there were no participants from non-endemic regions in the 4-
11 years group and there was a higher proportion of participants from non-endemic regions in TDV 
than in placebo group in subjects aged 12-17 years (6.5% vs 4.4%). 
In adults (18-60 years group), there were no important differences between the TDV and placebo 
groups except for region and baseline serostatus.  In TDV group all adult participants came from North 
America (non-endemic region), while in placebo group 86.2% come from North America and 13.8% 
came from Asia Pacific and Latin America (endemic regions). In addition, there were 9.5% of 
participants seropositive in TDV compared to 20.4% in the placebo group.  
Solicited Adverse events 
Solicited AEs data in overall population (4-60 years were available for a subset of 5,555 participants 
(3,830 subjects receiving TDV and 1,725 subjects receiving placebo):  
Overall, solicited local and systemic AEs, including solicited within 30 minutes and prolonged solicited 
AEs reported after the second dose were lower than after the first dose and the majority of them were 
mild in severity. 
Solicited AEs within 30 minutes were higher in the TDV group than in the placebo group (6.7% vs 
5.2%). No severe reactions were reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

The most frequently solicited local AE within 30 minutes reported after any vaccination was injection 
site pain, and the most frequently solicited systemic immediate AEs reported was headache, followed 
by myalgia and asthenia. Fever (≥38 °C) was reported by 0.1% of participants in TDV and <0.1% in 
placebo.  
After any dose, as it can be expected, the incidences of solicited local AE (within 7 days) were higher in 
the TDV group than in the placebo group (43.4% vs 25.7%, respectively), including severe solicited 
local AEs (1.3% vs 0.6%). The most frequently solicited local AE reported after any dose was injection 
site pain in both, followed by erythema and swelling. The grade 3 solicited local AEs were mainly due 
to injection site pain. The time to onset was, mainly, on day of vaccination in both groups and resolved 
with a median duration of 2-3 days in TDV groups and in 1 day in placebo group. The local adverse 
reaction of itching is included in the PL (frequency uncommon) and SmPC section 4.8 Table (pruritis). 
There was a trend of increasing frequency of Grade 3 injection pain after the second dose compared to 
the first one, although these percentages are very low and probably not significant. 
After any dose, as it can be expected, the incidences of solicited systemic AEs (within 14 days) were 
reported to be higher in the TDV than in the placebo group (46.1% and 40.1%, respectively) including 
severe forms (4.1% vs 3.5%). The most frequently solicited systemic AE reported after any dose was 
headache in both groups, followed by myalgia, malaise and asthenia. Lower frequencies were reported 
of loss of appetite, drowsiness and irritability/fussiness. It should be noted that irritability/fussiness, 
drowsiness, and loss of appetite were part of the infant/toddler panel of AEs that was used for subjects 
<6 years only.  The Grade 3 solicited systemic AEs were mainly due to headache and malaise. Fever 
and severe fever were less frequently reported in the TDV group than in the placebo group. The time 
to onset of all solicited systemic AEs was, mainly, on the day or 1 day after vaccination in both groups 
and resolved with a median duration of 3-4 days in the TDV and 2-3 day in the placebo groups (with 
the exception of fever with a median duration of one day).  
The applicant reported the incidence of grade 3 solicited systemic AEs after one or a second dose.  The 
incidence of Grade 3 events decreased from first to second vaccine dose in the TDV and placebo 
groups alike. The incidences in the TDV group after the first and second dose were 1.8% and 1.3% for 
headache, 1.2% and 1.0% for malaise, and 1.0% and 0.7% for asthenia, respectively. In addition, for 
the infant/toddler panel, the proportion of subjects with severe (Grade 3) events remained <1% for 
each individual event, and there was no clinically relevant change in severe (Grade 3) events from first 
to second vaccine dose in the TDV and placebo groups. A table containing safety data for solicited 
systemic AEs considered being vaccine related could not be found in the ISA or elsewhere. The 
applicant provided a table summarising individual vaccine related solicited systemic AEs within 14 days 
after the first, the second, and any vaccine dose in the target population 4-60 years of age (overall 
population, Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool), together with corresponding references to source data in 
the dossier. In the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool, the proportion of all subjects (4-60 years) reporting 
vaccine-related solicited systemic events (excluding fever) was higher in the TDV group compared with 
the placebo group (34.2% versus 27.9% of subjects). This numerical difference was mainly due to 
small differences for each systemic AE symptom, rather than due to a large difference for specific AE 
symptoms. After any vaccination, headache (24.4% vs 21.1% of subjects) and myalgia (22.8% vs 
16.5% of subjects) were the most frequently reported related solicited systemic AEs in both groups. 
Vaccine related fever was not reported by a higher proportion of subjects in the vaccine group 
compared with the placebo group (5.4% versus 6.1% after any vaccination). The systemic AEs 
irritability/fussiness, drowsiness, and loss of appetite were part of the infant/toddler panel of AEs that 
was used for subjects <6 years only. The incidence of irritability/fussiness and loss of appetite were 
numerically only slightly higher in the vaccine group, while the incidence of drowsiness tended to be 
little higher in the placebo group (i.e. irritability/fussiness was reported for 8.6% versus 6.2% of 
subjects, drowsiness by 8.9% versus 9.6% of subjects, and loss of appetite by 11.2% versus 8.4% of 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

subjects). Except for fever, vaccine-related solicited systemic AEs were consistently less frequent after 
the second than after the first vaccine dose. The majority of vaccine related systemic AES was mild to 
moderate. Severe solicited systemic adverse reactions were reported for 3.0% of subjects in the 
vaccine and for 2.1% in the placebo group. 
In Trial DEN-203, additional solicited systemic AEs were recorded (muscle pain, joint pain, eye pain, 
sensitivity to light, tiredness, rash, nausea, vomiting-number of episodes) that were not recorded in 
any of the other trials. Tiredness (fatigue) and nausea have been added to Table of Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. The AEs muscle pain (myalgia), joint pain (arthralgia), rash, and vomiting were already 
adequately covered in the SmPC. Sensitivity to light (no events of photophobia in placebo-controlled 
trials) and eye pain (no related events in TDV in placebo-controlled trials) are not included. The 
incidence of prolonged solicited local (after 7 days) or systemic (after 14 days) AEs was higher in the 
TDV group than in the placebo group (prolonged local AEs: 3.8% in TDV vs 0.6% in Placebo; prolonged 
systemic AEs: 1.9% in TDV vs 1.5% in placebo after any dose).  
Solicited AEs data by age groups (Placebo-controlled trials) were available for 2,882 subjects aged 4-
11 years (1,865 in TDV and 1,017 in placebo); 1,733 subjects aged 12-17 years (1,177 in TDV and 
556 in placebo) and 940 subjects aged 18-60 years (788 in TDV and 152 in placebo).  
Overall, the incidence of solicited local and systemic AEs, including solicited events within 30 minutes 
after vaccination and prolonged solicited AEs, were higher in the TDV than in placebo group in all age 
groups and the incidence was lower after the second dose than after the first one, in line with the 
results observed in the overall population.     
Solicited AEs within 30 minutes after any dose were higher reported in the adolescent group than in 
children or adults. The most frequently solicited local AE within 30 minutes reported after any 
vaccination was injection site pain in all the age groups, followed erythema and swelling. The most 
frequently solicited systemic AE after any dose was headache.  Fever was reported by ≤0.1% of 
participants in TDV group.  
The incidence of solicited local AEs (within 7 days) increased with age but was overall recorded within 
the same frequency range in all 3 age cohorts (i.e. 4-11, 12-17, 18-60 years of age). The most 
frequently solicited local AE reported after any dose was injection site pain in all groups, followed by 
erythema and swelling. Severe solicited local AEs after any dose were reported with higher frequency 
in the adolescent group aged 12-17 than in the paediatric group aged 4-11. Lower frequencies of 
severe solicited local AEs were observed in adults.  
The time of onset of local solicited AEs in TDV participants was, mostly, on the day of vaccination in all 
age groups and had a median duration of 1-2 days in paediatric groups and 4 days in adults.  
The incidences of solicited systemic AEs (within 14 days) were lower in children than in adolescents 
and adults but occurred overall within the same frequency range. The most frequently solicited 
systemic AE after any dose reported in subjects 6 years of age was headache in all age groups, 
followed by myalgia, malaise and asthenia. Fever was reported with similar frequencies in TDV children 
and adolescent group and higher than in adults group. There were no important differences in the time 
to onset and median duration of solicited systemic AEs by age group.  
Frequencies of solicited systemic AEs graded by severity in both paediatric groups were also provided. 
Overall, in both paediatric age groups, the majority of solicited systemic AEs after the first and second 
dose of either TDV or placebo were mild (Grade 1). The incidence of severe solicited systemic AEs in 
both age groups was <2% for each individual event after the first or second dose of either TDV or 
placebo, with the exception of headache (1.3% after first dose and 1.1% after second doses in 4-11 
years group and 2.7% after first doses and 1.9% after second dose in 12-17years group). Additionally, 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

in both age groups, Grade 3 solicited systemic were in general reported with the same incidence after 
the first and second dose of TDV or placebo.  
The incidence of prolonged AEs after any dose was higher in adults than in the 12 to 17 years age 
group and it was higher than in the 4-11 years age group, mainly due to local AEs. The incidence of 
prolonged solicited local and systemic AEs was generally higher in the subjects receiving TDV versus 
those receiving placebo. During procedure the applicant reported the most frequent prolonged solicited 
local and systemic AEs for the overall target population (4-60 years) and for each age sub-group (4-11 
years, 12-17 years, and 18-60 years) to justify the large difference on incidence of prolonged solicited 
local AEs in adults in the TDV group (12,6%) compared to the placebo (0,8%). In adult group, the 
majority of these prolonged solicited AEs were erythema (11.2% vs 0.8%). All of these erythema 
events were mild-moderate in severity.  
With regard to the safety profile description and calculation of ARs/AEs in section 4.8 in the SmPC, the 
applicant compared the frequency (TDV, after any vaccination) for all terms listed in Table 1 of Section 
4.8 of the SmPC between the overall target population (4-60 years) and the adult (18-60 years) and 
paediatric (4-17 years) subpopulations. Adverse Reactions with higher frequency category in any age 
subgroup compared to the overall target population 4 to 60 years of age were summarised. To account 
for frequency differences between the adult and the paediatric subpopulations, conservatively the 
highest frequency category was chosen, and the Product Information was updated accordingly. In 
addition, footnotes and a summarising text have been added to indicate differences in frequency 
categories between the age groups.  
Unsolicited Adverse events 
No difference was observed regarding the frequency of unsolicited AEs between participants who 
received TDV or placebo in the overall population (21.3% vs 22.8%). The frequency of severe 
unsolicited AEs was slightly higher in TDV than in placebo (0.5% vs 0.2%), although the numbers are 
very low and probably not significant.  
The majority of unsolicited AEs were considered as not related to the trial vaccine. The incidence of 
related unsolicited AEs was higher in the TDV group (3.0%) than in the placebo group (1.7%). Of 
these, 0.1% (5 subjects) in TDV and <0.1% (1 subjects) were severe and related unsolicited AE. None 
of the related unsolicited AEs were considered as SAE. 
The most frequently reported (≥1%) unsolicited AEs by PT in both groups were nasopharyngitis (2.6% 
vs 3.2% of subjects), upper respiratory tract infection (2.3% vs 3.4% of subjects) and viral upper 
respiratory tract infection (1.0% vs 0.8%).  
A table containing all unsolicited AEs included into the placebo-controlled safety pool, irrespective of 
causality, has been submitted within the ISA report. This table does not reveal any safety signal. 
However, a numerical imbalance was observed for the AEs rhinitis (1 subject, <0.1% in the placebo, 
and 8 subjects, 0.2% in the TDV group), and abdominal pain (recorded by 1 subject, <0.1% and 8 
subjects, 0.2%). Both are listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
The unsolicited AEs considered as related most reported in TDV were injection site bruising and 
pruritus by 22 and 25 participants respectively (all adults), compared to no cases reported in placebo 
group. Both ADR (injection site bruising and injection site pruritus) have been added to SmPC. The 
applicant included a footnote indicating “collected in adults in clinical trials” in the SmPC.  
The other unsolicited related AEs were pyrexia and systemic viral infection, fatigue and headache in 
TDV. Pyrexia and headache are included in the SmPC as were reported as solicited AEs. In addition, 
fatigue is included in SmPC with “uncommon” frequency. In contrast, the non-inclusion of “viral 
infection” in table 1 of the SmPC is justified because there were no imbalances in the incidence of 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 218/254 
 
 
 
 
subjects experiencing systemic viral infection between the TDV and placebo groups and there were 
also no imbalances in the number of events assessed as related by the investigator.   
Additionally, the applicant reassessed the events of injection site discoloration, chills, and dizziness 
with regard to causality and it is agreed that injection site discoloration and dizziness are added to 
SmPC. 
Severe unsolicited AEs reported in TDV were one case of myalgia, anhedonia, malaise, upper tract 
infection and pyrexia. None of these events was serious and all events resolved completely. All but one 
are included into the SmPC, section 4.8.  
The incidence of unsolicited AEs, including SAEs, showed no clinically important differences between 
the TDV and placebo groups by age groups. However, a significant difference was observed regarding 
the related unsolicited AEs by age groups. Higher incidences were reported in adults (9.6% vs 4.6% of 
subjects) than in paediatrics groups (1.0% vs 1.0% in 4-11 and 1.6% vs 2.3% in 11-17). No 
difference about incidence of severe related unsolicited by age were observed.  
At the PT level there was some difference between age groups. In the paediatric groups, the most 
frequently reported unsolicited AE was nasopharyngitis, followed by upper respiratory tract infection in 
4-11 years or by viral upper respiratory tract infection in 12-17 years (no clinically important 
differences between the TDV and placebo groups). In adults the most frequently reported unsolicited 
AEs were injection site bruising and pruritus, followed by upper respiratory tract infection.   
The only unsolicited AEs reported by ≥0.5% of subjects and with ≥2-fold higher incidences in the TDV 
group than in the placebo group were reported in the 12 to 17 years age group: abdominal pain (0.6% 
vs 0), diarrhoea (0.6% vs 0), gastritis (0.5% vs 0), and vomiting (0.5% vs 0), and in adults: injection 
site bruising (3.4% vs 0.7%), injection site pruritus (3.3% vs 0) and nasopharyngitis (0.6% vs 0). All 
these ADR were included in SmPC, with exception of gastritis.  
Serious adverse events and deaths  
Overall, 20 deaths occurred throughout the clinical program, and none was related to vaccine 
administration. Of these, 12 deaths occurred up to database lock for the pooled analyses. Ten deaths 
were included in the pooled analysis: 6 subjects (0.04%) in the TDV group and 4 subjects in the 
placebo group (0.05%). Two subjects from the TDV group were excluded, 1 subject 4 years from Trial 
DEN-204, death from septic shock and 1 subject who had received a sequential dose of YF vaccine 
from Trial DEN 305, death from cardiac arrest.  
In the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool, the incidence of SAEs in the overall target population 4-60 Years 
was lower in the TDV group than in the placebo group (4.60% vs 5.57% of subjects), owing to fewer 
events reported as SAEs of dengue fever, DHF, and viral infections in the TDV group. 
At the PT level, SAEs with incidences in ≥0.1% of subjects that were reported with a notably higher 
incidence in the TDV group than in the placebo group were gastroenteritis, asthma, cellulitis and lower 
respiratory tract infection. None of these SAEs with a notably higher incidence in the TDV group was 
considered to be related to TDV by the investigator.  
For both analysis pools, unrelated cases of appendicitis, gastroenteritis, dengue fever, and viral 
infections were the most frequently reported SAEs in the TDV group. In the placebo group, SAEs of 
dengue fever, appendicitis, DHF, and unrelated viral infections were most frequently reported.  
For both analysis pools, >95% of all SAEs occurred >30 days after the first or the second vaccine 
dose, and the majority resolved within 1 to 2 weeks. Of the SAEs that occurred within 30 days after 
the first or second vaccine dose, renal and urinary disorders (SOC) after the first dose were reported 
Assessment report

only in the TDV group (4 subjects in All Studies Safety Pool [0.02%]). None of these events considered 
as related to trial vaccine by the Investigator or the applicant.  
A single SAE of suspected dengue illness was considered to be related to TDV, compared with 5 SAEs 
(in 4 subjects) related to placebo. The related SAE in the TDV group in Trial DEN-301 was reported by 
a baseline dengue seropositive teenage female. The event started on Day 12 after the first vaccine 
dose, symptoms included rash, and thrombocytopenia and led to hospitalization. The RT-PCR test was 
negative for wild-type dengue. The SAE was considered as possibly related since occurred within the 
expected time window of vaccine viraemia although a test for vaccine viraemia was not performed. The 
event resolved within 5 days. 
An additional SAE of polyarthritis (PT) was considered to be related to TDV in All Studies Safety Pool 
Trial DEN 205). This SAE was reported by an adult seronegative female that started on Day 16 after a 
single dose of HD TDV and resolved within 8 days. The subject also reported non-serious rash and 
prolonged solicited systemic AEs of asthenia, malaise, and myalgia. The subject had vaccine viraemia 
at the time of the SAE.  
The related SAEs in the placebo group included hypersensitivity (3 SAEs), dengue fever (1 SAE), and 
DHF (1 SAE).  
In all age groups, the incidences of any SAEs were slightly lower in the TDV than in the placebo 
groups. No SAE was reported as related to TDV in age group 4 to 11 years and 17 to 60 years. One 
non-fatal related SAE (suspected dengue illness) was reported in age group 12-17 years in TDV 
(described above) vs 4 in placebo.  
At the PT level, SAEs in age group 4-11 that were reported with a ≥2-fold higher incidence in the TDV 
group than in the placebo group were asthma, lower respiratory tract infections, humerus fracture 
cellulitis, lymphadenitis and road traffic accident. In the 12 to 17 years age group, pneumonia, 
cellulitis, road traffic accident, and lymphadenitis were reported with a ≥2-fold higher incidence in the 
TDV group than in the placebo group. In adults, the only SAEs reported by >1 subject were major 
depression (2 subjects) and sciatica (2 subjects). 
For either age group, none of these SAEs with a higher incidence in the TDV group were considered to 
be related to TDV by the investigator. The majority of SAE (>95%) in both age groups occurred >30 
days after the first or the second vaccine dose, and the majority resolved within 1 to 2 weeks. 
Medically Attended Adverse Events (MAAEs) 
For the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool, MAAE data were available from 1088 subjects who received 
TDV and from 231 subjects who received placebo, aged 12-60 years. No MAAE data is available for 
children in the 4 to 11 years age group. No remarkable difference was observed between the TDV and 
placebo groups although higher incidences were observed in adolescents than in adults. 
In All Studies Safety Pool, (1888 subjects in TDV and 231 in placebo) the MAAEs per FTAR in TDV was 
higher than in Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (70.4 per 100 person-year vs 56.4 per 100 person-years 
respectively). This imbalance is probably due to the fact that 190 children aged 4 to 11 years in the 
TDV group of the All Studies Safety Pool had a high rate of 194.5 MAAEs per 100 person-years. The 
applicant was requested to explain, in the first RSI, the high rate of MAAEs per FTAR in children aged 
4-11 years in TDV. In all three age groups (4-11; 12-17; 18-60 years), the most frequently reported 
MAAEs were infections and infestation events. The most likely explanation for the high follow-up time-
adjusted adverse event rate (FTAR) for MAAEs (and also the high number of MAAEs per subject) 
observed in the 4-11 years group (all of whom received TDV) is that it reflects young children who 
generally experience a high rate of infections that require medical attention, notably in tropical 
countries such as the Philippines or Panama (countries where the clinical trial was conducted). 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

 In both pools the incidence of related MAAEs was low and similar between the TDV and placebo 
groups (≤0.9%) and events were mild or moderate in severity. None of the severe MAAEs was related 
to trial vaccine. 
Virologically Confirmed Dengue Including Hospitalized VCD and Severe Forms of Dengue  
The safety evaluation of VCD cases, including hospitalized VCD cases and severe forms of dengue, was 
based primarily on the data from pivotal trial DEN-301 where all subjects presenting with febrile illness 
or with clinical symptoms of dengue were centrally assessed for VCD by serotype-specific RT-PCR.  
Among all cases of VCD, severe forms of dengue were determined in 2 different ways:  
-All hospitalized VCD cases evaluated for classification as severe dengue by the blinded DCAC, 
using predefined criteria for severe dengue (DCAC-defined severe dengue). All non-hospitalized 
VCD cases were considered non-severe. 
-All VCD cases meeting the WHO 1997 criteria for DHF were identified using a programmed 
algorithm, i.e., without applying medical judgment (DHF of any grade (DHF Grade I-IV) 
Data were provided from DEN-301 of VCD including hospitalized VCD and severe forms of Dengue up 
to 12, 24 and 36 months after the second dose. In addition, the data of VCD including hospitalized 
VCD by DENV-3 were also submitted up to 12, 24 and 36 months after the second dose. Moreover, 
final data from pivotal Trial DEN-301 until 54 months post second dose, focus on the benefit-risk 
profile in baseline seronegative subjects, mainly by DENV-3 and DENV-4. New summary tables from 
DEN-301 including data regarding VCD, hospitalized cases and severe forms up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 
months after the second dose caused by all serotypes together or by each serotype, in overall 
population or by baseline serostatus were submitted. 
Data from Trials DEN-204 and DEN-313 were considered as supportive as not pre-specified criteria for 
dengue severity were defined. 
Trial DEN-301  
The incidences of VCD (all serotypes combined) were lower in TDV group than in placebo up to 12 
months (0.6% vs 3.0%), up to 24 months (0.1% vs 1.4%), up to 36 months (2.9% vs 7.4%) and up 
to 54 months (2.5% vs 5.8%) after the second dose. The relative risk of VCD in the overall population 
and in both baseline seropositive and seronegative subgroups were <0.5 (with superior limit <1). 
Moreover, the incidences of hospitalized VCD up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 months after the second vaccine 
dose (all 4 serotypes combined) were lower in the TDV group versus placebo, with relative risks <0.5 
in the overall population and in the baseline seropositive and seronegative subgroups.  
In seropositive subjects the relative risk of VCD and hospitalized VCD up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 months 
after the second dose were <0.5 and 0.2, respectively. In addition, the relative risk of VCD and 
hospitalized VCD by DENV-1, DENV-2 and DENV-3 up to 54 months after the second dose were 0.5. 
For DENV-4, the RR of VCD was also 0.5; the RR was 0 for hospitalized VCD and the 95%CI cannot be 
calculated (0 cases in TDV vs 3 in placebo through 54 months)  
In seronegative subjects the relative risk of VCD and hospitalized VCD up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 months 
after the second dose were <0.5 and ≤0.2, respectively. For DENV-1 and DENV-2, the relative risk of 
VCD and hospitalized VCD in seronegative subjects were 1 (including upper limit). For serotype DENV-
3 the relative risk of VCD was 1.60 (0.52, 4.91), 1.37 (0.64, 2.93), 1.18 (0.65, 2.16) and 1.11 (0.62, 
1.99) up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 months after the second vaccine dose respectively. This imbalance was 
noted in hospitalized VCD caused by DENV-3 with 11 cases in the TDV group (N=3,714, 0.3%) 
compared with 2 cases in placebo group (N=1,832, 0.1%) up to 36 months after the second dose 
resulting in a relative risk of 2.71 (95% CI: 0.60, 12.23) for seronegative individuals receiving TDV. No 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

additional hospitalized cases caused by DENV-3 occurred in the TDV group up to 54 months after the 
second dose, resulting in a RR of 1.81 (95% CI 0.51, 6.48). 
Imbalance observed in DENV-3´s VCD hospitalized cases in seronegative subjects is explained by the 
different standard of care at a single trial site and other confounding factors. If hospitalized VCD cases 
from Sri Lanka were excluded, the incidences of hospitalized VCD caused by DENV-3 in baseline 
seronegative subjects up 54 months after the second dose would be 5 cases in the TDV and 3 cases in 
the placebo with a RR of 0.82 (95% CI 0.20, 3.42). Importantly, the RR in DENV-3 seronegative 
subjects was 1 including Sri Lanka or 1 excluding Sri Lanka, but in both cases with an upper limit of 
CI greater than 1, indicating that the potential safety risk of TDV by DENV-3 in seronegative individuals 
could not be excluded. For this reason, “Severe and/or hospitalized dengue following vaccination 
caused by dengue virus serotype 3 in individuals not previously infected by dengue virus” as an 
important potential safety risk in the RMP (See Safety Specifications in RMP). 
For DENV-4, in seronegative subjects, the number of cases was small. The relative risk of VCD by 
DENV-4 up to 36 months was 1.97 (95% CI: 0.42, 9.28) with 8 cases (0.2%) in TDV and 2 cases 
(0.1%) in placebo. Up to 54 months, the RR was 1.97 (95%IC 0.56, 6.98) with 12 cases in TDV 
(0.3%) and 3 cases in placebo (0.2%).  Regarding hospitalized VDC by DENV-4 in seronegative 
subjects, there were no cases in the TDV group and there was only 1 subject in placebo group, 
therefore a firm conclusion cannot be drawn.  
Regarding the VE in the seronegative population up to 36 and 54 months against VCD for DEN-4 it 
could not be demonstrated either. A higher incidence of DENV-4 VCD was observed in the TDV group 
than in the placebo. However, given the small number of DENV-4 cases in this trial a potential signal 
towards disease enhancement by DENV-4 in seronegative individuals cannot be conclusively confirmed 
or excluded. In the RMP, “Severe and/or hospitalized dengue following vaccination caused by dengue 
virus serotype 4 in individuals not previously infected by dengue virus” has been included as an 
important potential safety risk (See Safety Specifications in the RMP). 
Of the overall 29 cases of DCAC-defined severe dengue or DHF reported up to 54 months, 10 cases 
were in the TDV group and 19 cases in the placebo group.  
In the TDV group, 3 cases (0.02%) were considered DCAC-defined severe dengue and 9 cases 
(0.07%) of DHF, since two cases were considered both severe and DHF. In the placebo group, there 
were 5 cases (0.07%) of DCAC-defined severe dengue and 15 cases (0.19%) of DHF; one case in 
placebo was considered both severe and DHF. It should be noted that this evaluation is exploratory 
and based on a very low number of severe cases. 
Of the 3 overall cases of DCAC-defined severe dengue in the TDV group, 2 cases occurred in 
seronegative subjects (both were caused by DENV-3) and one in seropositive (caused by DENV-3). In 
placebo group, all 5 DCAC-defined severe dengue cases were seropositive at baseline (1 case by 
DENV-1 and DENV-2 and 3 cases by DENV-3).  
Additionally, of the 9 overall cases of DHF in TDV group, 4 cases occurred in seronegative subjects (all 
caused by DENV-3) and 5 in seropositive (2 cases by DENV-1 and 3 cases by DENV-3).  In comparison, 
in the placebo group 12 of 13 overall cases were in seropositive subjects (3 cases by DENV-1, 6 cases 
by DENV-2, 2 cases by DENV-3 and 1 case by DENv-4) and 1 in seronegative.  
Up to 54 months, the incidences of DHF or severe dengue caused by DENV-3 in both groups remained 
very low (4 versus 1 DHF, and 2 versus 0 severe dengue cases in the TDV and placebo group with a 
2:1 randomization ratio, respectively). The two cases in TDV recipients that were assessed as severe 
by the DCAC occurred early in the trial during Parts 1 and 2 (i.e., before 18 months post second dose). 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022

In addition, no cases of DHF and/or severe dengue were caused by DENV-4 throughout the trial up to 
54 months post second dose. 
Vaccine Viraemia 
Methods of vaccine viraemia evaluation, trial design, dose and route of administration differ in the 
single trials contributing to the pooled analysis of vaccine viraemia. Results are descriptive and 
assessed post-hoc. It is agreed with the applicant, that pooled results should therefore be interpreted 
with caution. The data are however supported by (though only few) non-pooled cases of vaccine 
viraemia from 2 other trials.  
Vaccine viraemia occurred mainly after the first TDV dose, peaked overall at 10 to 12 days after 
vaccine dosing, and was mostly of vaccine strain TDV-2. 
The result of vaccine viraemia in the Trial DEN-205 analysed in final TDV formulation and HD TDV 
groups showed that the vaccine viraemia was higher in HD TDV (62.5%) than in TDV (30.9%). 
Additionally, independent of HD TDV or TDV, the viraemia mainly occurred for vaccine strain TDV-2, 
peaked at Day 11, the mean duration of viraemia was similar for TDV-2 and other serotypes. No 
difference of reversion of attenuation loci were observed in TDV or HD TDV (14.8% and 13.6%, 
respectively). 
The incidence of vaccine viraemia was higher in baseline seronegative (48.8%) than in baseline 
seropositive (15.8%) subjects and the mean duration was also longer for seronegative than for 
seropositive subjects.  
The incidence of solicited and unsolicited AEs in subjects with vaccine viraemia, replication-competent 
vaccine virus, or reversion of attenuation loci was analysed only after the first dose because vaccine 
viraemia was rarely detected after the second dose. 
Overall, there was higher incidence of some solicited and unsolicited AEs in viremic than in non-viremic 
subjects and in viremic subjects with or without replication-competent vaccine virus.  
Of note, the number of evaluated ADRs for viremic subjects was larger than those listed in tables -
Solicited Local AE within 7 day or Systemic within 14 days After First, Second, and Any Vaccine Dose, 
Target Population [4-60 Years]-, as in early clinical development phase, an extended panel of solicited 
AEs was collected, as well as events that are known to occur in the scope of wild type dengue, whilst in 
contrast during the majority of the Phase 2 and 3, the panel of solicited AEs was focused on the 
characterization of reactogenicity to the vaccine.  
Regarding solicited AEs, higher incidences of injection site pain, injection site erythema, rash, 
arthralgia, fatigue and fever were observed in viremic than in non-viremic subjects. Furthermore, in 
subjects with viraemia, a higher incidence of systemic AEs such as fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea, 
and photophobia were observed than in those without replication-competent vaccine virus. Likewise, a 
higher incidence of pain at the injection site, arthralgia, fever, nausea, and vomiting was observed in 
subjects with attenuation locus than in those without it. Most of these ADR, including fatigue and 
nausea were included in SmPC. In addition, the non-inclusion of “photophobia” is justified because the 
photophobia events reported in viremic subjects were collected in early phases clinical trials (using 
different formulations, vaccination schedules and routes of administration) and no events of 
photophobia were reported in the TDV group in placebo-controlled trials. Therefore, a causal 
relationship between TDV and photophobia could not be established.  
Regarding unsolicited AEs, higher incidence of headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea and 
upper respiratory tract infection were observed in with than without viremic subjects. In addition, most 
episodes of rash (75.0%) and all episodes (100%) of rash erythematous, rash papular, rash maculo-
papular, rash generalized, rash macular, and rash pruritic showed a temporal relationship with vaccine 
Assessment report

viraemia. In the SmPC, a footnote is added in the table 1 in section 4.8 in the ADR of rash with “Rash 
includes rash, viral rash, rash maculopapular, rash pruritic”.  
Additionally, in DEN-301, the relationship/association of acute febrile illness (within 30 days) and 
viraemia was assessed. Of note, most febrile illness cases (within 30 days) were not associated with 
detection of vaccine viraemia. Vaccine viraemia was detected in 34 of 479 febrile illness subjects 
(7.1%) after the first TDV dose and in 1 of 503 subjects (0.2%) after the second vaccine dose. 
Subjects with febrile illness and vaccine viraemia showed a similar pattern of symptoms as those with 
febrile illness but without vaccine viraemia. Additionally, the incidence of febrile illness was higher in 
viremic (TDV-2) seronegative than seropositive subjects. 
Due to the limited number of subjects with febrile illness and vaccine viraemia, the pattern on AEs is 
inconclusive. 
Laboratory findings 
Laboratory clinical parameters (haematology, serum chemistry, urinalysis) were analysed 
approximately in 1800 subjects from the 5 phase 1 trials and in 2 phase 2 trials (DEN-203 and DEN-
106). The results did not show any clinical safety concern. In addition, the results for parameters of 
special relevance in the context of the symptomatology associated with dengue fever did not reveal 
differences between any TDV and placebo.  
No pooling of clinical laboratory data was performed they were not evaluated in the rest of clinical 
trials, including phase 3 pivotal trial. 
Safety in special populations 
Pregnancy or lactation:  
TDV has not been studied in pregnant or lactating women. Pregnancy was an exclusion criterion for all 
trials in the TDV clinical development program. As other live viral vaccines TDV is contraindicated 
during pregnancy (see SmPC, section 4.6) and the exposure of TDV in pregnant and lactating women 
is considered as missing information on the safety specification on the RMP. Nevertheless, there is 
limited data of vaccine administration in women who were pregnant or who became pregnant shortly 
after vaccination. 
As of 01 October 2020, a total of 405 pregnancies were reported and most then were considered as 
non-exposed (89.1%). Only 44 of 405 were considered exposed. Of these, 79.4% in any TDV group 
and 50.0% in placebo had a normal outcome and no major differences in frequencies of spontaneous 
abortion were observed between women exposed to any TDV or placebo.  
In addition, there were 8 women who became pregnant during the trial and had births with neonatal 
deaths (all from Trial DEN-301). Only one neonatal death (TDV group) occurred after an exposed 
pregnancy, and the remaining 7 cases occurred after non-exposed pregnancies. None of the neonatal 
deaths were assessed as causally related to TDV. 
Intrinsic and extrinsic factors:  
The safety of TDV in target population was evaluated by intrinsic and extrinsic factors. The safety 
profile by age group has been described previously, in addition, data for subjects aged <4 years were 
provided, and no safety concern was observed. However, due to the limited number of participants the 
high variability of the incidence of solicited AEs makes it difficult to reach a conclusion.  
In general, in the analyses of the different subgroups, the incidence of solicited and unsolicited AEs 
was higher in TDV group than in placebo and they were observed less frequently after the second dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 224/254 
 
 
 
 
than after the first, in line with the profile observed in the overall population.  In addition, no clinically 
important differences of the incidence of SAE by subgroups were observed. 
By intrinsic factor (serostatus, gender and race) no significant demographic differences were observed 
by the different subgroups of TDV and placebo with exception of baseline serological status serostatus 
in which the majority of adults were seronegative.   
The incidence of solicited AEs, including prolonged AEs, events within 30 minutes and unsolicited AEs 
was higher in seronegative than in seropositive subjects and in female than in male. The biggest 
difference was in the local AEs requested. In addition, the differences of solicited and unsolicited AEs 
by serostatus were most pronounced in adolescent age group.  
No clinically important differences were noted between the AE profile observed by race (Asian, 
American Indian or Alaska Native, Black or African American, and White subjects). The only notable 
difference was that solicited local AEs were reported more frequently by White subjects than by the 
other race subgroups. 
No safety data are available for individuals with underlying disease and the frail population. No data 
are available for individuals with immunosuppression (missing information). Like other live viral 
vaccines, the use of TDV is contraindicated for individuals with congenital or acquired immune 
deficiency, including immunosuppressive therapies, and for individuals with symptomatic and 
asymptomatic HIV infection. 
The safety profile by extrinsic factor (endemic/non-endemic region, region/countries and previous 
flavivirus vaccination) is inconclusive because there are underlying reasons that confound the observed 
data, such as important differences by age or baseline serostatus.  
The subgroup of subjects from endemic regions (Latin America and Asia Pacific) is dominated by 
children and adolescents and the non-endemic subgroup (North America) comprised only adults. 
Solicited local AEs, mainly consisting of mild and transient injection site pain, appeared to be more 
frequently experienced by subjects from non-endemic regions than by subjects from endemic regions. 
The same but less pronounced was observed for the incidence of solicited systemic AEs (overall and 
considered to be related). The evaluation of unsolicited AEs reported up to 28 days after vaccine 
dosing for both analysis pools revealed no clinically important differences between the TDV and 
placebo groups in the subjects from endemic and non-endemic regions. Though data are limited for the 
use of TDV in non-endemic regions they did not raise concerns for the use in these regions. 
With respect to previous flavivirus vaccination, the adult participants were limited and only in previous 
unvaccinated subjects. The Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool comprised 14,627 subjects exposed to at 
least 1 dose of TDV and 7167 subjects exposed to at least 1 dose of placebo. In the TDV and placebo 
groups alike, approximately 40% of subjects in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool and approximately 
36% of subjects in the supportive. For both analysis pools, no clinically important differences were 
identified regarding the incidence of solicited and unsolicited AEs in subjects with and without previous 
flavivirus vaccinations. The incidence of unsolicited AEs (related and unrelated) was not higher in the 
previous vaccinated group compared with the not previously vaccinated group. No SAE in the 
previously vaccinated group was considered being vaccine related. No safety concern for the use of 
TDV in previously flavivirus vaccinated individuals (YF and JE) could be raised. 
Immunological events 
No vaccine-related anaphylactic reactions/anaphylactic shock events were reported within 28 days 
after any dose for either safety pools. There was only 1 unrelated anaphylactic shock event after the 
second dose in a TDV subject after ingestion of mefenamic acid. Additionally, the incidence of 
hypersensitivity reactions was ≤0.1% for both TDV and placebo recipients (both pools) and none of 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 225/254 
 
 
 
 
these hypersensitivity events was serious or severe. From the initial submitted information it remains 
unclear, whether hypersensitivity reactions considered being vaccine related were reported or not. The 
applicant has performed a post-hoc analysis to identify any hypersensitivity events that were 
considered vaccine related. In the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool, the overall incidence of vaccine-
related hypersensitivity events reported within the first 28 days after a TDV dose was low (12 events in 
11 of 14,627 subjects [0.08%]) and showed no difference compared with the placebo group (8 events 
in 6 of 7,167 subjects [0.8%]. In the supportive updated All Studies Safety Pool, the incidence was 
higher in the TDV group than in the placebo group (0.14% vs 0.07% of subjects). This is due to higher 
reported rates of skin reactions (rash, rash pruritic, pruritus, urticaria) in the TDV group. A minority of 
vaccine-related hypersensitivity reactions reported in the TDV group occurred within the first 4 days 
after vaccination, i.e. 5 of 12 events in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool, and 15 of 27 events in the 
All Studies Safety Pool. The majority of events identified by the SMQ search were skin reactions such 
as rash, pruritus, or urticaria. These types of hypersensitivity reactions are included in the SmPC as 
ADRs. 
Only one additional notable vaccine-related hypersensitivity reaction was reported within 28 days after 
TDV vaccination (Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool). This was a single event of angioedema in a male 
under age 10 (Trial DEN-301). The child discontinued the trial after receiving the first TDV dose due to 
a non-serious AE of mild angioedema affecting both eyes. The event started on day 1 and was treated 
with systemic antihistamines. The event resolved on the following day. No other AEs and no medical 
history events were recorded for the subject. Applicant and investigator concluded that a causal 
relationship cannot be excluded for this event in the absence of alternative causes. The AE of 
angioedema has been included in SmPC section 4.8 accordingly.  
Co-Administration With Yellow Fever or Hepatitis A virus Vaccine  
Co-administration of TDV with YF and HAV vaccine has been evaluated in trials DEN 305 and DEN-314, 
respectively. In both trials, the incidences of solicited AEs were higher in the co-administration groups 
(TDV+YF or TDV+HAV) than in YF or HAV and placebo but occurred in general in a comparable 
frequency range. No clinically important differences between groups were noted regarding unsolicited 
AEs and SAEs. Generally, the co-administration was well tolerated and no safety concern was 
identified. 
Discontinuation due to AEs  
The incidence of AEs leading to vaccine and/or trial discontinuation was ≤0.20% in both groups and 
incidence of AEs considered to be related by the investigator was <0.1% for both groups (6 subjects in 
TDV and 2 subjects in placebo). 
One event of mild angioedema in the region of both eyes was recorded for a male under age 10. The 
event occurred on the day of the first TDV dose and resolved within 2 days. The event was considered 
being vaccine related by the investigator and listed in the SmPC (see above).  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the

Specific considerations on safety data for an EU vs. a non-EU context of use 
The majority (>90%) of all subjects in the TDV and placebo groups of the Placebo-Controlled Safety 
Pool were from endemic regions. Subjects from non-endemic regions in this analysis pool comprised 
Assessment report

Page 226/254 
 
 
 
 
919 adults from North America (US) enrolled in Trial DEN-304 and 400 adolescents from Mexico City 
enrolled in Trial DEN-315. 
The analysis of the submitted safety data (excluded long-term follow-up data for VCD, hospitalized 
VCD, DCAC-defined dengue, and DHF) revealed no clinically important differences between the TDV 
and placebo groups in the subjects from endemic and non-endemic regions. Though data are limited 
for the use of TDV in non-endemic regions they did not raise concerns for the use in these regions. The 
data from the US trials are deemed appropriate for extrapolation to the EU population. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The method for describing and evaluating the safety profile of TDV for the target population (≥4 years 
of age), is general deemed acceptable. The safety data base (27,118 subjects from dengue-endemic 
(92.6%) and non-endemic regions) is, though dominated by the paediatric population, also acceptable.  
Solicited AEs and unsolicited AEs in target population was evaluated in a subset of 5,555 participants 
randomised 2:1 (TDV: placebo).  
As it can be expected after any dose the incidences of solicited local AE and solicited systemic AEs 
were higher in the TDV than in the placebo group although a majority of them were mild in severity. 
The most frequently solicited local AEs reported were injection site pain, followed by erythema and 
swelling. The most frequently reported solicited systemic AE was headache, followed by myalgia, 
malaise and asthenia. Fever and severe fever were less frequently reported in the TDV group than in 
the placebo group. The time to onset of majority of solicited local and systemic AEs was on the day or 
1 day after the vaccination and resolved with a median duration of 2-3 days for solicited local AEs and 
3-4 days for solicited systemic AEs (with exception of fever with a median duration of one day). 
No difference was observed regarding the frequency of unsolicited AEs between participants who 
received TDV or placebo in the overall population. However, the incidence of unsolicited AEs considered 
related were higher in TDV than in placebo 
Overall, the incidence of solicited and unsolicited AEs was lower after the second dose than after the 
first one and there were higher frequencies in female vs males and in seronegative vs seropositive 
after any dose. Additionally, there was an increasing trend of solicited and unsolicited AEs with age but 
occurred within the same frequency range.  
Only limited data for the use of TDV in pregnant women is available. These data do not allow a 
conclusion on the safety profile of TDV when administered to pregnant women in any state of 
pregnancy. The use of TDV is contraindicated for pregnant and lactating women and it is considered a 
missing information on the safety specification on the RMP.  
In all age groups, the incidences of any SAEs were slightly lower in the TDV than in the placebo group 
owing to fewer events reported as SAEs of dengue fever, DHF, and viral infections in the TDV group. 
Related SAEs were also lower in the TDV group.  
Vaccine viraemia was mainly detected after the first dose and there was higher in baseline 
seronegative than in baseline seropositive subjects. No relationship/association of acute febrile illness 
(within 30 days) and viraemia was detected. However, higher incidence of some solicited and 
unsolicited AEs was observed in viraemic than in non-viraemic subjects and in viraemic subjects with 
replication-competent vaccine virus than without it. 
Importantly, in seronegative subjects the RR of VCD, including hospitalized VCD, caused by DENV-3 
was >1 up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 months after the second vaccine dose. Different standards of care and 
other confounding factors may explain why the RR in DENV-3 seronegative subjects was >1 if Sri 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 227/254 
 
 
 
 
Lanka data were included or <1 if excluding Sri Lanka data, albeit with an upper limit of CI greater 
than 1 in both cases, indicating that a safety concern regarding DENV-3 infection in TDV vaccinated 
seronegative individuals cannot be completely excluded.  
Again, the incidence of VCD by DENV-4 in seronegative individuals was low in both groups. However, 
the RR of VCD by DENV-4 in seronegative subjects up to 54 months after the second dose was >1, 
indicating that a risk of enhanced dengue disease caused by DENV-4 in seronegative subjects cannot 
be conclusively ruled out.  
Finally, the incidence of DCAC-defined severe dengue and/or DHF was low in seronegative subjects at 
baseline. However, there was an imbalance with 5 cases in the TDV group (all caused by DENV-3) 
compared to 2 cases in placebo group (caused by DENV-1 and DEN-3) at month 54 after the second 
vaccination 
In conclusion, the risk of severe VCD caused by DENV-3 and DENV-4 in seronegative subjects are 
considered a safety concern in the Safety specification on the RMP.

the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC.   
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 19.08.2022. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Qdenga (dengue tetravalent vaccine (live, 
attenuated)) is included in the additional monitoring list as it contains new active substance which, on 
1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Dengue is a severe, flu-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults, but seldom causes 
death.  Symptoms usually last for 2–7 days, after an incubation period of 4–10 days after the bite from 
an infected mosquito. The World Health Organization classifies dengue into 2 major categories: dengue 
(with / without warning signs) and severe dengue.  
-Dengue should be suspected when a high fever (40°C/104°F) is accompanied by 2 of the following 
symptoms during the febrile phase: severe headache; pain behind the eyes; muscle and joint pains; 
nausea; vomiting; swollen glands, or rash.  
-Severe dengue: A patient enters what is called the critical phase normally about 3-7 days after illness 
onset. It is at this time, when the fever is dropping (below 38°C/100°F) in the patient, that warning 
signs associated with severe dengue can manifest. Severe dengue is a potentially fatal complication, 
due to plasma leaking, fluid accumulation, respiratory distress, severe bleeding, or organ impairment. 
Warning signs that doctors should look for include severe abdominal pain; persistent vomiting; rapid 
breathing; bleeding gums; fatigue; restlessness or blood in vomit. The most severe forms of dengue 
infection – dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS) – are life 
threatening. 
Primary infection with any of the 4 dengue serotypes is thought to result in decades of protection from 
re-infection by the same serotype but may not protect against a secondary infection by 1 or more of 
the other 3 dengue serotypes and may lead to an increased risk of severe disease over the course of 
secondary infection (DHF/DSS).  
Dengue viruses are transmitted from human to human by mosquitoes (primarily by Aedes aegypti but 
also by Aedes albopictus). There are an estimated 390 million dengue infections per year worldwide, of 
which 100 million are symptomatic. Every year, around 500,000 cases of dengue haemorrhagic fever 
(DHF) require hospitalization with an estimated death rate of 2.5%, primarily in children. It is 
estimated that 3.9 billion people are at risk of dengue infection, with an estimated death rate of 
approximately 20,000 to 25,000 per year, primarily in children. 
The incidence of dengue has grown dramatically around the world in recent decades. This increase has 
been associated with societal changes such as population growth and increasing urbanization, 
particularly in tropical cities with poor waste and water management, leading to proliferation of the 
domestic and peridomestic mosquito species (Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus). Human migration 
and international trade and travel are constantly introducing new vectors and pathogens into novel 
geographic areas. 
Before 1970, only 9 countries had experienced severe dengue epidemics. The disease is now endemic 
in more than 100 countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) regions of Africa, the Americas, 
the Eastern Mediterranean, South-East Asia and the Western Pacific. The Americas, South-East Asia 
and Western Pacific regions are the most seriously affected, with Asia representing approximately 70% 
of the global burden of disease. Not only is the number of cases increasing as the disease spreads to 
areas including Europe, but outbreaks are occurring. The threat of a possible outbreak of dengue now 
exists in Europe; local transmission was reported for the first time in France and Croatia in 2010 and 
imported cases were detected in 3 other European countries. In 2012, an outbreak of dengue on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 233/254 
 
 
 
 
Madeira islands of Portugal resulted in over 2000 cases and imported cases were detected in mainland 
Portugal and 10 other countries in Europe. Autochthonous cases are now observed on an almost 
annual basis in many European countries. 
Among travellers returning from low- and middle-income countries, dengue is the second most 
diagnosed cause of fever after malaria. A secondary dengue vector in Asia, Aedes albopictus, has 
spread to more than 32 states in the United States (US) and more than 25 countries in the European 
Region. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment of dengue fever is based solely on the clinical signs and symptoms, with fluid replacement 
required for haemorrhagic or shock cases. An antiviral therapy for dengue virus infection is not 
available. Most of the current preventive measures that rely on mosquito control and individual 
protection are of limited efficacy, complex to implement, and questionable in terms of cost-
effectiveness. While the malaria transmitting Anopheles mosquitoes predominantly feed during the 
night, the dengue transmitting Aedes mosquitoes feed predominantly at dusk and bed nets are 
therefore not effective. Dengue continues to spread despite the use of vector control measures. New 
technologies under development appear to be effective at stopping local dengue transmission, such as 
where mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia (which reduces a mosquito’s ability to transmit human 
viruses) are released into the environment. 
Vaccine development has assumed the need for tetravalent vaccines against all 4 serotypes to avoid 
any potential risk of vaccine induced immune enhancement, as has been well documented with natural 
(wild type) infection. A first tetravalent dengue vaccine (chimeric Yellow Fever [YF] virus-Dengue virus 
Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine) has been approved since 2015 in several Asian and Latin American 
countries as well as in the US and in the European Union (EU). This vaccine was initially approved for 
use in vaccine recipients ≥9 years of age because clinical data indicated an unfavourable risk benefit 
profile for children <9 years of age. More recent analyses found that individuals who were dengue 
seronegative before vaccination had a higher risk of getting severe disease and/or getting hospitalized 
when they were infected by dengue virus after vaccination than individuals who were already 
seropositive. In a revised recommendation from April 2018, the Scientific Advisory Group for 
Emergencies (SAGE) concluded that for countries considering vaccination as part of their dengue 
control program, a “pre vaccination screening strategy” would be the preferred option, and only 
dengue seropositive individuals should be vaccinated. 
Hence, considering the epidemiology of dengue, the lack of available antiviral treatments and the 
limitations of the available vaccine, there is a continued unmet public health need for a safe and 
effective vaccine that will protect populations not covered by the available option (children aged <9 
years and individuals with no previous exposure to dengue virus) against dengue infection. 
The WHO has defined and reconfirmed dengue vaccines as high priority vaccines for WHO 
prequalification, i.e., dengue is included in the list of High Priority Vaccines in the WHO vaccines 
prequalification priority list 2018-2020. 
To address this unmet medical need, the applicant has developed a tetravalent vaccine that aims to 
protect against dengue irrespective of baseline dengue serostatus and that can be administered to 
children as young as 4 years of age.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant is seeking marketing authorization for TDV with an indication for the prevention of 
dengue disease caused by any dengue virus serotype in individuals 4 years to 60 years of age. The 
vaccine is to be administered following a two-dose (0 and 3 months) schedule. 
Data from a total of 7 phase 3, 6 phase 2, and 5 phase 1 trials, comprising more than 27,000 subjects 
from dengue-endemic and non-endemic regions and covering an age range from 1.5 to 60 years, are 
presented in this submission in support of the proposed indication for TDV.  
The benefit-risk evaluation is based primarily on the efficacy results from pivotal phase 3 Trial DEN-
301, the immunogenicity results from the seven phase 2 and phase 3 trials with available 
immunogenicity data that included TDV in its final lyophilized formulation administered as 2 doses 3 
months apart, and the available safety data pooled across 10 phase 2 and phase 3 trials, with the 
focus on placebo-controlled trials. An assessment of immunogenicity when TDV is co-administered with 
a vaccine against the yellow fever (YF) virus or hepatitis A virus are also included in this application.  
Study DEN-301 is a Phase III, Double-Blind, Randomised, Placebo-Controlled Trial to Investigate the 
Efficacy, Safety and Immunogenicity of a Tetravalent Dengue Vaccine (TDV) Administered 
Subcutaneously in Healthy Children Aged 4–16 Years Old. This trial was developed in 8 countries from 
two regions (Asia Pacific and Latin America) where Dengue is endemic. Eligible subjects 
(aapproximately 20,000) were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive either TDV or placebo (normal 
saline for injection) by a subcutaneous (SC) injection into the upper arm.  
The trial comprises 5 consecutive trial parts: Part 1 was the primary analysis period, a 15-month 
period lasting until 12 months post second dose and included the primary efficacy analysis. 
Virologically confirmed dengue cases in Part 1 counted towards the primary efficacy objective if they 
occurred at least 30 days post-second vaccination. Part 2 was a 6-month period lasting until 
18 months post second dose, at the end of which the secondary efficacy endpoints were analysed. 
Part 3 is a 2.5- to 3-year period for the assessment of long-term efficacy and safety; and Parts 4 and 5 
comprise the booster phase of at least 25 months for the assessment of the efficacy, immunogenicity, 
and safety following an additional placebo or TDV booster dose administered 48 to 54 months (4-
4.5 years) after the second vaccine dose.  
Parts 1, 2 and 3 have been completed; the remainder of the trial (parts 4 and 5) is still ongoing. In this 
Marketing Authorisation Application, results based on efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety data up to 
24 months post second vaccine dose were initially submitted and are summarized in detail in this 
assessment report. Moreover, data up to 54 months post second dose became available during 
assessment and the key results are also discussed. It is noted that results of part 4 and 5 of the study 
(as amended to incorporate a booster dose) are not provided in this MAA. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Several favourable effects for TDV were shown from the pivotal trial DEN-301. 
The primary endpoint for efficacy in the prevention of VCD fever caused by any serotype (i.e., all 4 
serotypes combined) from 30 days to 12 months post second vaccine dose was met since the pre-
established criterion (the lower bound of the 2 sided 95% CI for the VE was above 25%) was fulfilled. 
In fact, VE was 80.2% (95% CI: 73.3%, 85.3%; p<0.001). 
The efficacy of TDV for the key secondary endpoint of hospitalization due to VCD caused by all 
serotypes combined from 30 days to 18 months post second vaccine dose was confirmed with a VE of 
90.4% (95% CI: 82.6%, 94.7%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 235/254 
 
 
 
 
The results from other secondary endpoints, that measured VE from 30 days to 18 months post second 
dose showed: 
-VE against VCD fever in dengue baseline seropositive subjects was 76.1% (95% CI: 68.5%, 81.9%) 
and in baseline seronegative subjects was 66.2% (95% CI: 49.1%, 77.5%). 
-The VE of TDV against VCD fever was analysed for cases due to different dengue serotypes.  The 
highest VE was shown for prevention of DENV-2 infections (95.1%; 95% CI: 89.9%, 97.6%), and then 
for DENV-1 (VE of 69.8%; 95% CI: 54.8%, 79.9%), and DENV-3 (48.9%; 95% CI: 27.2%, 64.1%). 
The VE determined against VCD fever caused by DENV-4 was inconclusive (51.0%; 95% CI: -69.4%, 
85.8%) due to the lower incidence rates of cases due to this serotype. 
In addition to determine VE against hospitalized VCD, the Applicant also performed in trial DEN-301 
other relevant analyses (from 30 days to 18 months post second vaccine dose) in relation to 
preventing severe dengue disease. In particular, VE was determined against:  
DHF (meeting the WHO 1997 criteria for DHF and dengue shock syndrome). DHF cases were identified 
using a programmed algorithm, i.e., without applying medical judgment. Broadly, the criteria include 
presence of fever lasting 2 to 7 days, haemorrhagic tendencies, thrombocytopenia, and evidence of 
plasma leakage”. 
Severe cases as determined by an independent “Dengue Case Adjudication Committee” (DCAC) 
based on the WHO 2009 guidelines. The DCAC assessed all hospitalized VCD cases utilizing agreed 
predefined criteria which included an assessment of bleeding abnormality, plasma leakage, liver 
function, renal function, cardiac function, the central nervous system, and shock.” 
-There were only three cases (1 case in the placebo and 2 cases in the TDV group) that were 
adjudicated as severe by an independent adjudication committee (DCAC) that assessed all hospitalized 
cases. All of these 3 cases were caused by DENV-3. Due to these low rates, VE could not be 
demonstrated for DCAC-defined severe VCD fever (VE: 2.3%; 95% CI: -977.5%, 91.1%).  
-There were 9 cases meeting the DHF definition (7 in the placebo and 2 in the TDV group), and only 
one of the DHF cases was considered a severe case by DCAC. The vaccine efficacy of TDV against DHF 
was 85.9% (95% CI: 31.9%, 97.1%). The 2 cases in the TDV group were both caused by DENV-3. 
When VE in prevention of hospitalized VCD was analysed according to the infecting serotype, the 
estimates of VE calculated were: 77.3 % (95% CI: 40; 91), 100% (46 vs 0 cases); 42.9 % (95% CI: -
69; 80) and undetermined (due to the few casas observed in the trial - only one case in placebo and 
zero in TDV), for Dengue virus serotypes 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.  
Exploratory analyses included determining VE for longer periods of time (up to 24, 36 or 54 months 
counted one month post second dose): 
-The overall VE in preventing VCD fever from 30 days post second vaccination up to 36 months was 
59.6% (95%CI: 53.6, 64.9). 
-VE against prevention of VCD fever decreased from 80.2% (95% CI: 73.3%, 85.3%), to 56.2% (95% 
CI: 2.3, 66.8) and to 44.7% (95% CI: 32.5,54.7), from 30 Days to 12 Months (Year 1) and from 13 to 
24 Months (Year 2) and from 25 to 36 months (Year 3) post second vaccine dose, respectively. A 
similar trend was observed for VE against VCD fever leading to hospitalization for the same periods of 
time with VE estimates of 95.4% (95% CI: 88.4%; 98.2%), 76.1% (95% CI: 50.8; 88.4) and VE:

70.8% (95% CI: 49.6; 83.0). Similarly, VE against DHF were for the same periods of time:  87.3% 
(95% CI: -13.5%, 98.6%), 75.9% (95% CI: -31.3%-95.6%) and 65.4% (19.9-85.2%) VE against 
severe Dengue cases according to the DCAC committee was inconclusive even when counting from 1 
month to 36 months after second dose [VE: 70.2% (-24.7; 92.9%)], since there were very few cases 
(5 cases in the placebo and 3 cases in the TDV group).  
-When analysed from 30 days to 24 months post second dose, VE against VCD fever was found to be 
similar between baseline seropositive and seronegative subjects for cases due to both DENV-1 [66% 
(47;78) and 63% (37;78)]) and DENV-2 [89% (80;94) and 94% (82;98)]. For cases caused by DENV-
3, VE in seropositive subjects was 62.7% (46.6; 74.0). However, when analyzing the VCD fever cases 
caused by DENV-3 in baseline seronegative subjects, there was a higher incidence of cases in the TDV 
(23/3531) that in the placebo (9/1726) group, and thus the VE determined was -29.0 (-178.8; 40.3). 
There were too few cases of VCD fever caused by DENV-4 (8 cases in the placebo and 8 cases in the 
TDV group), and thus the VE results were inconclusive. 
-When analysed from 30 days to 24 months post second dose, positive VE estimates were observed for 
hospitalized cases due to DENV-1 (seropositive and seropositive) and DENV-3 (seropositive) but with 
very wide CI for DENV-1 seronegative (VE: 75.4%; 95% CI: 1.5; 93.8) and DENV-3 seropositive (VE: 
72.5%;95% CI: 5.9; 91.9). In relation to hospitalizations due to VCD fever caused by DENV-3 in 
baseline seronegative subjects, there were 1 case in the placebo group and 4 cases in the TDV group, 
which resulted in a VE of -101% (95% CI: -1706; 77). There was only one case of VCD caused by 
DENV-4 that led to hospitalization (in a baseline seropositive subject in the placebo group), so no 
conclusion could be reached on prevention of hospitalization caused by this dengue serotype. In line 
with the previous mentioned results regarding cases due to DENV-3, during Year 3, in baseline 
seronegative subjects, there were more hospitalized cases in the TDV group (7 hospitalizations of 11 
VCD cases) compared with the placebo group (1 hospitalization out of 6 VCD cases) (the randomization 
ratio of 2:1 [TDV: placebo] should be considered). 
-VE of TDV against of DCAC-defined severe and DHF is shown when the analysis is made on the safety 
set: a total of 8 cases of DCAC-defined severe VCD were reported in the safety set, 5 cases in the 
placebo group and 3 in the TDV group (VE: 70.2%; 95% CI: -24.7%, 92.9%). In the same period, 
13 cases of DHF occurred in the placebo group and 9 cases in the TDV group (VE: 65.4%; 95% CI: 
19.0%, 85.2%), including 3 cases (1 in the placebo group, 2 in the TDV group) that were classified as 
both DCAC-defined severe and DHF. Thus, taken together, there were 17 cases of DCAC-defined 
severe VCD or DHF in the placebo group and 10 such cases in the TDV group (the randomization ratio 
of 1:2 placebo: TDV should be considered).  
-Exploratory analyses included determining VE from first dose up to 54 months post second dose. The 
VE determined in baseline seropositive subjects was 64.2% (95% CI: 58.4%, 69.2%) and against VCD 
leading to hospitalization 85.9% (95% CI: 78.7%, 90.7%). The benefit of TDV against overall VCD in 
baseline seronegative subjects was also confirmed in the analysis from first dose to 54 months post 
second vaccine dose with a VE estimate of 53.5% (95% CI: 41.6%, 62.9%. The VE against VCD 
leading to hospitalization was 79.3% (95% CI: 63.5%, 88.2%).  
Other exploratory analyses indicated: 
-VE against VCD fever of 81.1% (95% CI: 64.1%, 90.0% was determined during the 3 months 
between the first and second vaccine dose. This is indicative of a rapid onset of the effect of TDV from 
the first vaccine dose onwards. A similar trend is observed for VCD cases reported between the first 
and second vaccine dose leading to hospitalization (6 in the placebo group and 2 in the TDV group)

during this 3-month period. Therefore, these results do not indicate that the first dose, due to raising a 
low immune response, could predispose the recipients to a more severe dengue disease. 
-The cumulative incidence curves for the period up to 36 months from first vaccination indicates that 
VE against DENV-1 and DENV-3 wanes faster than against DENV-2. In relation to cases due to DENV-
3, it is observed that the curve corresponding to placebo seronegative individuals accumulates fewer 
cases than the TDV seronegative ones over the whole period analysed.  
-Results from subgroup analyses by age group (4-5, 6-11, and 12-16 years), from 30 days to 
24 months post second dose, showed that VE of TDV in preventing VCD fever was seen across all 
predefined age groups with VE lower values in subjects aged 4 to 5 years (51.0%), and higher values, 
in subjects aged 6 to 11 years (71.8%), and in subjects aged 12 to 16 years (79.3%). Further 
analyses by baseline serostatus showed the VE values of ≥67.0% across all subgroups by baseline 
serostatus within age group, with the only exception of baseline seronegative subjects in the youngest 
subgroup of 4 to 5 years (VE: 4.6%). Moreover, additional data provided by the Applicant describe VE 
covering the period from 30 days to 54 months post second dose (PP set). It is shown that VE against 
VCD was high in the three age groups analysed, with the lowest VE estimate [41% (95%CI: 21%, 
55%)] observed in the youngest age group (4-5 years of age). VE estimates were always positive 
when VE was calculated, for each age group, according to the baseline serostatus, and also when 
calculated, for each age group, according to the serotype of the infected Dengue virus. It is noted, 
however, that 95%CI of the VE estimates were wide, and in some cases crossed zero, due to the few 
cases that were observed in some of the subgroups analysed. These results provided support for the 
use of the vaccine in children  from 4 to 16 yoa.-Subgroup analyses by prior vaccination against YF or 
JE showed, for the period from 30 days to 24 months after second dose, VE values of 86.1% (95% CI: 
78; 91) in those subjects previously vaccinated against JE, 68.8% (95% CI:42 ; 83) in those 
previously vaccinated against YF, and 60.6%  (95% CI: 49 ; 69) in those not previously vaccinated 
against either JE or YF, suggesting an impact of prior JE or YF vaccination on the VE of TDV.  
Other favorable effects were determined from other Clinical trials:  
-Coadministration of TDV and Hepatitis A vaccine in adults 18 to 60 years has been analysed (trial 
DEN-305) in seronegative subjects to Dengue and Hepatitis A. In terms of immune response, no 
interference against any of the two vaccines was shown when the vaccines were administered 
concomitantly.  
-Overall, immune response to TDV was high and consistent in several Phase 2 and 3 trials. GMTs of 
neutralizing antibodies in the TDV group increased for each serotype (independently of baseline 
serostatus) to Month 1 following the first vaccine dose, declined to the second vaccine dose (Month 3), 
increased again following the second vaccine dose to Month 4, and thereafter slightly declined to 
Month 15. The magnitude of the response was comparable for DENV-1, DENV-3, and DENV-4, and was 
higher for DENV-2. Similarly, for baseline seronegative subjects, in the TDV group, seropositivity rates 
for each serotype reached were high (≥99.5%) at Month 4 and remained high through Month 15 
(≥92.7%) and Month 27 (≥90.4) and were maintained at similar levels at month 39 (36 months post 
second vaccine dose). 
-The extension of the indication from subjects from 17 to 60 years was made based on the comparison 
of immune response (in terms of GMTs and seroconversion rates) in baseline seronegative subjects 
from Trials DEN-301 (702 pediatric subjects aged 4-16 years, endemic region) and DEN-304 (379 
adult subjects aged 18-60 years, non-endemic region). In addition, available safety, efficacy, and 
immunogenicity data for TDV do not lead to any reason that would require restriction of the maximum 
age.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The few VCD cases due to DENV-4 observed in pivotal trial DEN-301, which resulted in VE estimates 
with very wide 95%CI, precluded a meaningful conclusion on the performance of TDV against this 
dengue serotype.  
A number of subgroup, exploratory analyses were performed to determine VE (against VCD and 
hospitalized VCD) according to Dengue serostatus and the infecting serotype (in total 16 comparisons). 
It should be emphasised that the trial was not powered to obtain robust estimates of VE from these 
analyses. It was noted that VE against VCD caused by DENV-3 in baseline dengue seronegative 
subjects was not demonstrated. In fact, the VE estimate was negative [VE: -51% (95%CI: -1356; 84)] 
when analysed from 30 days to 18 months post second vaccination. Moreover, VE against VCD fever 
caused by DENV-3, from first dose to 54 months post second vaccine dose in baseline seronegative 
subjects (safety set), yielded VE estimates of -15 % (95%CI: -108; 36) and it is noted that the 95%CI 
was very wide and included 0. Other exploratory analysis showed that VE estimate against hospitalized 
VCD due to DENV-3 in seronegative subjects, from first doses to 54 months post second dose (safety 
set), was -87.9% (95%CI: -573%, 40%); however, the VE was 15% (95%CI -254%, 79%) when data 
from Sri Lanka (the country with the highest hospitalization rate of VCD cases) were excluded. These 
data indicate that there is no clear evidence of higher hospitalization of cases due to DENV-3 since the 
results are confounded by the high hospitalization rate of VCD cases in Sri Lanka.   
Analysis of severe dengue cases (DHF and DCAC-defined severe VCD cases) identified an imbalance in 
baseline seronegative subjects infected by DENV-3. During the 54 months follow-up period, there was 
1 severe case in the placebo group and 5 cases in the TDV group (that corresponded to 0 vs 4 cases of 
DHF, and 1 vs 4 cases of DCAC-defined severe VCD cases; it is observed that one case was classified 
both as DHF and DCAC-defined severe VCD cases). However, the Applicant indicated that DHF 
detection in Sri Lanka was almost 3 times the rate in other countries (5.8% vs 2.0% across serotypes) 
in the placebo group. This is likely because of the conservative hospitalization criteria and the close 
monitoring with frequent platelet count evaluation and ultrasonography, a sensitive method which can 
detect subclinical plasma leakage. Notably, thrombocytopenia and plasma leakage are 2 of the 4 
defining criteria of DHF, and thus the rate of DHF detection can be sensitive to frequency and nature of 
investigations. Moreover, it is noted that the 2:1 randomization also predisposes an imbalance towards 
the TDV group. In conclusion, it is interpreted that the increased number of severe dengue cases due 
to DENV-3 in seronegative subjects is confounded by the small number of DCAC-defined severe and 
DHF cases, the higher rate of DHF detection in Sri Lanka, and additional statistical considerations. It is 
thus considered that there is no robust evidence of increased risk of severe dengue disease caused by 
DENV-3 in baseline seronegative subjects. 
It is acknowledged that in the few VCD hospitalized cases and severe forms of dengue observed over 
the four years of the trial, no clear pattern is observed on whether these cases increase over time. 
Thus, a clear conclusion cannot be reached to indicate that waning of VE drives an increase on 
hospitalized cases.  
Another important limitation of TDV is that VE wanes rapidly (by two 2–fold) from year 1 (counted 
from one month after second dose) to year 3. The same trend (around 25% reduction) was seen when 
VE is determined against hospitalized and DHF cases. It is also observed that this decline is not 
homogeneous for all dengue serotypes since the cumulative incidence curves suggest that VE against 
DENV-1 and DENV-3 wanes faster than against DENV-2. Therefore, this aspect together with the 
different VE of TDV against different serotypes indicates that if this vaccine were used in a mass 
vaccination campaign in one country, the effectiveness results would be highly influenced by the 
dengue serotype(s) circulating in that area. It was considered that despite the observation that VE 
declines with time, it remains high for dengue seropositive subjects at baseline for at least three years 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 239/254 
 
 
 
 
and that there is no clear indication that it translates into an increased risk of severe disease for 
seronegative subjects.  
Although the results obtained indicate that prior vaccination against YF or JE has a favorable effect on 
VE against VCD fever, this interpretation is questioned since these results were highly confounded by 
differences between regions and countries and their underlying serotype distribution. Thus, it is unclear 
whether the impact of prior JE or YF vaccination on the efficacy of TDV.  
Coadministration of TDV and Hepatitis A vaccine in baseline seronegative subjects 18 to 60 years has 
been supported from the results of trial DEN-314. It remains to be known whether these results can be 
extrapolated to younger subjects both dengue seropositive and dengue seronegative at baseline.  
The immunogenicity results in terms of neutralizing antibodies showed a good immune response 
induced by TDV. Nonetheless, these data could not be directly correlated with VE results since there is 
not an established correlate for protection. In fact, while it is observed in trial DEN-301 that VE wanes 
rapidly from year 1 to year 3, a similar strong decline is not seen in terms of GMT titres and 
seroprotection rates. These results are indicative that other elements of the immune system, apart 
from neutralizing antibodies, are important in maintaining long-term VE.  
Trial DEN-305 investigated the immunogenicity and safety of TDV and a YF vaccine (YF-17D) 
administered concomitantly or sequentially in healthy adults aged 18 to 60 years seronegative to both 
viruses. Although coadministration of the two vaccines did not affect the response to YF, the immune 
response to TDV was diminished when co-administered. The clinical significance of this finding is 
unknown.  
Coadministration with other vaccines has only been analysed for the hepatitis A and Yellow Fever 
vaccine. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The integrated evaluation of the safety profile of TDV in the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool was based 
on 22,002 subjects, aged 4-60 randomised 2:1 (14,627 subject who received at least 1 dose of TDV 
and 7167 subjects who received at least 1 dose of placebo). The reactogenicity analyses were available 
for a subset of 5,555 participants (3,830 subjects receiving TDV and 1,725 subjects receiving placebo). 
In the population 4-60 years of age solicited local and systemic AEs were reported more frequently in 
TDV than in placebo group and the difference was more pronounced for local reactogenicity (43.4% vs 
25.7% within the first 7 days following any dose of TDV or placebo for solicited local AEs and 46.1% vs 
40.1% within 14 days for solicited systemic AEs, respectively).    
The most frequently reported solicited local AEs after any dose of TDV was injection site pain (41.8% 
vs 25.4%), followed by erythema (7.1% vs 0.3%) and swelling (3.4% vs 0.6%). Most of the local AEs 
were mild or moderate in intensity, but a 1.3% of subjects experienced grade 3 local AEs, mainly due 
to injection site pain. The time to onset was, mainly, on day of vaccination and resolved with a median 
duration of 2-3 days. 
The most frequently reported solicited systemic AEs after any dose of TDV was headache (33.8% vs 
30.1%), followed by myalgia (28.0% vs 20.5%), malaise (22.9% vs 20.7%) and asthenia (19.7% vs 
17.5%). However, a 4.1% of subjects experienced grade 3 systemic AEs, being headache and malaise 
the most frequently grade 3 solicited systemic AE reported. The time to onset was, mainly, on the day 
or 1 day after the vaccination and resolved with a median duration of 3-4 days. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 240/254 
 
 
 
 
Pyrexia was reported in 8.9% of participants who received any dose of TDV (vs 10.5% in placebo) and 
the incidence of severe ( Grade 3) fever was 2.1%. Fever events generally resolved within a single 
day. 
In addition to solicited AEs, the incidence of immediate solicited AE (within 30 minutes) or prolonged 
solicited AEs (after 7 days for solicited local AEs and after 14 days for solicited systemic AEs) were 
higher in TDV group than in placebo (6.7% vs 5.2% for any solicited AEs within 30 minutes; 3.8% vs 
0.6% of prolonged local AEs and 1.9% vs 1.5% of prolonged systemic AEs in TDV or placebo, 
respectively). No severe solicited AEs within 30 minutes have been reported and most of prolonged 
solicited AEs were mild. Only 2 subjects (<0.1%) and 11 subjects (0.2%) who received TDV reported 
severe prolonged local and systemic AEs, respectively.  
Overall, the incidence of solicited (local and systemic), including prolonged AEs and events within 30 
minutes were lower after the second dose than after the first one and there were higher frequencies in 
female than in male subjects and in seronegative than in seropositive subjects at baseline. It was 
observed that the frequency of each of the solicited local AEs increased with age and that the incidence 
of solicited systemic AEs was lower in children than in adolescents and in these than in adults.  
Any unsolicited AEs after any dose were reported with the same incidence in TDV and placebo (21.3% 
vs 22.8%). However, the incidence of unsolicited AEs considered related were higher in TDV than in 
placebo (3.0% vs 1.7%). Of these, 0.1% (5 subjects) in TDV and <0.1% (1 subjects) were severe 
unsolicited related AEs. No related unsolicited AEs (within 28 days after any vaccination) were 
considered as SAE. 
There was no imbalance observed in the frequency of unsolicited AEs reported by SOC between TDV 
and placebo. The unsolicited AEs after any dose by SOC most frequently reported were infections and 
infestations (13.4% vs 16.3%), followed by general disorders and administration site conditions (2.8% 
vs 1.7%) and gastrointestinal disorders (2% and 1.5%). 
The most frequently reported unsolicited AEs were nasopharyngitis (2.6%) and upper respiratory tract 
infection (2.3%). Injection site bruising and pruritus were the most frequently related unsolicited AEs 
reported (0.7% each), followed by pyrexia (0.2%) and systemic viral infection, fatigue and headache 
(<0.1% each). The grade 3 related unsolicited AEs in TDV were one case each of myalgia, anhedonia, 
malaise, upper tract infection and pyrexia. 
Overall, the incidence of unsolicited AEs was lower after the second dose than after the first one. A 
higher incidence of unsolicited, including related, AEs was observed in seronegative than in 
seropositive subjects, in female than in males and in adults than in children and adolescents. 
The incidence of SAEs was generally low and lower in the TDV group than in the placebo group (4.60% 
vs 5.57%), including related SAEs (a single case in TDV [suspected dengue illness] compared to four 
cases in placebo [2 subjects reported related SAEs of hypersensitivity (with 1 subject experiencing 2 
events), dengue fever and DHF]). By SOC, the SAE most frequently reported were Infections and 
infestations (2.64% vs 3.74%), the rest were reported <1% in both groups. None of the SAEs by PT 
reported with higher incidence in TDV than in placebo was considered as related (gastroenteritis, 
asthma, cellulitis and lower respiratory tract infection). No clinically important differences in the 
incidence of SAEs by serostatus or gender were reported. However, lower incidence of SAEs was 
observed in adults (2.03%) than in children (5.04%) and adolescents (4.17%). 
Similar and low frequencies of participants experienced AEs leading to vaccine and/or trial 
discontinuation in both groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 241/254 
 
 
 
 
No clinically important differences were found of MAAEs between the TDV and placebo groups although 
higher incidences were observed in adolescents than in adults (no MAAE data from the children 4-11 
years group is available). 
In pivotal DEN-301, overall, the incidences of VCD and hospitalized VCD (all serotypes combined) were 
lower in the TDV group than in placebo up to 12, 24, 36 and 54 months after the second dose in the 
overall population and in the baseline seropositive and seronegative subgroups.  
However, there was a numerical imbalance in the incidences of hospitalization and severe forms of 
dengue caused by DENV-3 in baseline seronegative subjects (RR of VCD by serotype DENV-3 was 1.11 
(95% CI 0.62, 1.99) and RR of hospitalized VCD caused by DENV-3 was 1.81 (95% CI 0.51, 6.48) up 
to 54 months after the second vaccine dose).  
In addition, few cases of VCD caused by DENV-4 in seronegative subjects. Up to 54 months after the 
second vaccine dose were reported, there were 12 cases (0.3%) in TDV and 3 cases (0.2%) in 
placebo, with a RR 1.97 (0.56, 6.98). There were no cases of hospitalized VCD by DENV-4 in the TDV 
group and there was only 1 subject in placebo group, therefore the potential increase in severe / 
hospitalized cases by DENV-4 in seronegative subjects is currently unknown. 
Although preliminary an additional safety concern is that in seronegative subjects a higher incidence of 
severe forms of dengue (DCAC-defined severe dengue and/or DHF) from baseline up to 36 months 
after the second dose were reported in TDV (5 cases [0.13%]) than in placebo group (1 case 
[0.05%]). The incidence of DHF or severe dengue caused by DENV-3 up to 54 months after the second 
dose remained very low in both groups (4 versus 1 DHF, and 2 versus 0 severe dengue cases in 
seronegative TDV and placebo group respectively, with a 2:1 randomization ratio) and no cases of DHF 
and/or severe dengue were caused by DENV-4 throughout the trial up to 54 months post second dose. 
Vaccine viraemia was observed in 30.9% (54 of 175 participants) of participants who received final 
formulation of TDV in the trial DEN-205. The viraemia mainly occurred for vaccine strain TDV-2 and 
peaked at Day 11. Of 54 participants with vaccine viraemia, the 14.8% presented single reversion. 
Vaccine viraemia was rarely detected after the second dose and it was higher in baseline seronegative 
than in baseline seropositive subjects. Overall, there was a higher incidence of some solicited (injection 
site pain, injection site erythema, rash, arthralgia, fatigue and fever) and unsolicited AEs (headache, 
fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, nausea and upper respiratory tract infection) in viraemic than in non-
viraemic subjects and in viraemic subjects with replication-competent vaccine virus than without it. 
The relationship/association of acute febrile illness (within 30 days) and viraemia was assessed in trial 
DEN-301 and most febrile illness cases were not associated with detection of vaccine viraemia. Vaccine 
viraemia was detected in 34 of 479 febrile illness subjects (7.1%) after the first TDV dose and in 1 of 
503 subjects (0.2%) after the second vaccine dose. Subjects with febrile illness and vaccine viraemia 
showed a similar pattern of symptoms as those with febrile illness but without vaccine viraemia. 
Additionally, the incidence of febrile illness was higher in viraemic (TDV-2) seronegative than 
seropositive subjects. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In the Placebo-Controlled Safety Pool (Safety Set) the majority of participants (63.0%) was 4 to 11 
years of age (11.9% between 4 and 5 years and 51.1% between 6 to 11 years), followed by 31.6% of 
participants 12 to 17 years of age. Both age groups come from the Latin America and Asia Pacific 
regions; therefore, there were limited safety data on the pediatric population from non-endemic areas. 
Assessment report  
EMA/862552/2022  
Page 242/254 
 
 
 
 
The proportion of adults was limited, only the 5.4% of participants who received TDV were 18-60 years 
of age and all were from North America (US), therefore there are no data in adults from non-endemic 
areas in the Safety Set. There were no data in subjects 60 years of age. 
The proportion of seropositive subjects in the TDV group was 67.1% and the proportion of 
seronegative subjects was 30.6%. However, the age distribution was not homogeneous by baseline 
serostatus. Seropositive participants were aged 4 to 17 years, and seronegative participants were aged 
4 to 60 years.    
The safety profile by extrinsic factors (endemic/non-endemic region, region/countries and previous 
flavivirus vaccination) is inconclusive because there are underlying reasons that confound the observed 
data, such as important differences of age or baseline serostatus. The subgroup of subjects from 
endemic regions (Latin America and Asia Pacific) is dominated by children and adolescents and the 
non-endemic subgroup (USA) comprised only adults. Regarding previous flavivirus vaccination, the 
number of adult participants was limited, and they were all non-vaccinated.  
TDV safety regarding virologically confirmed dengue (VCD) including hospitalized VCD and severe 
forms of dengue was based primarily on the data from pivotal Trial DEN-301 (4 to 16 years). 
Additionally, data from Trials DEN-204 (2 to 17 years) and DEN-313 (4 to 15 years) were considered 
as supportive because no predefined dengue severity criteria were used. Consequently, no data of VCD 
including hospitalized VCD and severe forms of dengue was available from subjects ≥18 years of age.  
The imbalance in the incidences of VCD, including hospitalized VCD caused by DENV-3 in seronegative 
individuals, observed in trial DEN-301, is a concern regarding potential disease enhancement by DENV-
3 in seronegative subjects vaccinated with TDV. However, the increased number of severe dengue 
cases due to DENV-3 in seronegative subjects is confounded by the small number of DCAC-defined 
severe and DHF cases, the higher rate of DHF detection in Sri Lanka, and additional statistical 
considerations, and thus there is no robust evidence of increased risk of severe dengue disease caused 
by DENV-3 in baseline seronegative subjects. In addition, the limited data on VCD, including 
hospitalization and clinically severe forms by DENV-4 in seronegative subjects, makes not possible to 
draw a robust conclusion on the possibility of enhanced disease severity by DENV-4 in that population.  
Therefore, from a safety perspective, the occurrence of DHF and clinically severe forms of dengue 
caused by DENV-3 and DENV-4 in seronegative individuals remains uncertain. Due to these 
uncertainties, DHF and clinically severe forms of dengue by DENV-3 and DENV-4 in TDV vaccinated 
seronegative individuals is included as important potential risks in the RMP.  
Data from supportive trial DEN-204 showed a RR of VCD (all serotypes included) up to 48 months <1 
(with 95% CI superior limit <1). The participant’s baseline serostatus was available only for a subset of 
trial participants, with no data regarding serotype or serostatus at baseline have been provided for 
these VCD cases. This makes data interpretation difficult. No relevant information from DEN-313 was 
obtained, the follow up was only of 9 months after the first dose and there were no cases of VCD 
requiring hospitalization or meeting the WHO 1997 criteria for DHF.  
Pregnant/breastfeeding women and immunocompromised participants were excluded from the studies. 
Safety data regarding these populations are lacking and both safety concerns are considered as 
missing information in the Safety Specifications of the RMP.

The safety database lacks data for pregnant and breast-feeding women, and immunocompromised 
individuals. 
In agreement with the Expert Group (SAG), it is considered that a broad indication, for both baseline 
seropositive and seronegative subjects, will be important for practical implementation of community 
vaccination and is in the interest of global public health. 
The CHMP also agreed that available safety, efficacy, and immunogenicity data for TDV do not lead to 
any reason that would require restriction of the maximum age for vaccine administration. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The high VE against VCD fever and hospitalised VCD caused by any dengue serotype, independently of 
dengue serostatus at baseline, is an important benefit. In addition, in terms of reactogenicity the 
vaccine is well tolerated, and no evidence of SAEs directly related to the vaccine components has been 
shown.   
Specific considerations in relation to an EU context of use 
Though data are limited for the use of TDV in non-endemic regions, they did not raise concerns for the 
use in these regions.  TDV has demonstrated efficacy in baseline seronegative subjects and hence can 
be used in individuals living in non-endemic areas and travelling to endemic areas. The vaccination 
decision should be guided in concert with recommendations from the Public Health Authorities and the 
health care provider, taking account of individual circumstances (e.g. regions to visit, time spent at 
risk).  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Qdenga is positive, subject to the conditions stated in section 
‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Qdenga is favourable in the following indication: 
“Qdenga is indicated for the prevention of dengue disease in individuals from 4 years of age. 
The use of Qdenga should be in accordance with official recommendations.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation.  
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to medical prescription. 
Official batch release 
In accordance with Article 114 Directive 2001/83/EC, the official batch release will be undertaken by a 
state laboratory or a laboratory designated for that purpose.

•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product 
within 6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The marketing authorisation holder (MAH) shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and 
interventions detailed in the agreed RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and 
any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that Dengue virus serotype 1 
(live, attenuated), Dengue virus serotype 2 (live, attenuated), Dengue virus serotype 3 (live, 
attenuated) and Dengue virus serotype 4 (live, attenuated) contained in the medicinal product 
Qdenga, are to be qualified as new active substances in themselves as these are not constituents of a 
medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.

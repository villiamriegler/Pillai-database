Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for pomalidomide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
In view of available data on solid organ transplant rejection from the literature and spontaneous reports 
including in some cases a close temporal relationship, and in view of a plausible mechanism of action, the 
PRAC Rapporteur considers a causal relationship between pomalidomide and solid organ transplant 
rejection can be established. The PRAC Rapporteur concluded that the product information of products 
containing pomalidomide should be amended accordingly. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for pomalidomide the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing pomalidomide is unchanged subject to the proposed 
changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

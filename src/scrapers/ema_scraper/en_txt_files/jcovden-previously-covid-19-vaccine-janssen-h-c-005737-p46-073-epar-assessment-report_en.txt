1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted the final clinical study report (date: 23 August 2022) of the VAC31518COV2001 
Study (involving paediatric participants) and a short critical expert overview in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that VAC31518COV2001 (also referred to as COV2001) is part of a clinical 
development program. VAC31518COV2001 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 
multicenter, Phase 2a study in healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years inclusive, adults in good or stable 
health aged 65 years and older, and in healthy adolescents aged 12 to 17 years inclusive. A line listing 
of all the concerned studies is annexed. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
JCOVDEN  (also  referred  hereafter  as  Ad26.COV2.S)  is  a  monovalent  vaccine  composed  of  a 
recombinant, replication incompetent human adenovirus type 26 (Ad26) vector, constructed to encode 
the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (S) protein, stabilized in its 
prefusion conformation. 
JCOVDEN  is  indicated  for  active  immunisation  to  prevent  COVID-19  caused  by  SARS-CoV-2  in 
individuals 18 years of age and older. The approved posology is a single dose of 5x1010 vp in 0.5 mL, 
to  be  administered  intramuscularly  (IM).  The  conditional  marketing  authorization  was  granted  on  11 
March  2021.  In  December  2021,  JCOVDEN  was  further  authorized  as  homologous  booster  or  as 
heterologous  booster  following  completion  of  primary  vaccination  with  an  approved  mRNA  COVID-19 
vaccine. In November 2022, JCOVDEN was authorized as heterologous booster following completion of 
primary vaccination with an adenoviral vector-based COVID-19 vaccine. 
The posology used in the paediatric population in study COV2001 was 2.5 ×1010 vp dose. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
The MAH submitted in this procedure the final clinical study report (CSR) for study COV2001 and a 
short critical expert overview. 
VAC31518COV2001  was  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter,  Phase  2a  study 
in  healthy  adults  aged  18  to  55  years  inclusive,  adults  in  good  or  stable  health  aged  65  years  and 
older,  and  in  healthy  adolescents  aged  12  to  17  years  inclusive.  Methods  and  results  for  the  sub-
populations  of  adult  participants  of  COV2001  have  already  been  assessed  in  other  procedures 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/0000, EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0033 and EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0053).

Inclusive  and  Adults  Aged  65  Years  and  Older  and  to  Evaluate  2  Dose  Levels  of  Ad26.COV2.S  in 
Healthy Adolescents Aged 12 to 17 Years Inclusive”. 
Study number: VAC31518COV2001, EudraCT 2020-002584-63, NCT04535453 
Sponsors: COV2001 was conducted under the sponsorship of Janssen (Janssen Vaccines & Prevention 
B.V.)  in  collaboration  with  the  United  States  (US)  Government  and  the  COVID-19  Response  Team 
(formerly Operation Warp Speed [OWS]), which also encompasses the Biomedical Advanced Research 
and Development Authority (BARDA), the National Institutes of Health, and the COVID-19 Prevention 
Trials Network. 
Study period: 
Adolescents: 3 March 2021 (Date first participant signed informed consent) to 9 March 2022 (Date of 
last contact of the last participant in the study) 
ICH GCP: 
The  MAH  states  that  COV2001  was  conducted  and  reported  in  accordance  with  the  ethical  principles 
originating  in  the  Declaration  of  Helsinki  and  in  accordance  with  ICH  Good  Clinical  Practice  (GCP) 
guidelines, applicable regulatory requirements, and in compliance with the respective protocols. 
Study design and protocol amendments: 
COV2001 was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, Phase 2a study in healthy 
adults aged 18 to 55 years inclusive, adults in good or stable health aged 65 years and older, and in 
healthy adolescents aged 12 to 17 years inclusive. 
The study was conducted in Germany (3 sites), Spain (3 sites), The Netherlands (3 sites), and United 
Kingdom (4 sites). 
Concerning  the  adolescent  population  (12  to  17  years  of  age,  inclusive),  the aim  of  COV2001  was  to 
evaluate the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of Ad26.COV2.S in a 1- and 2-dose vaccination 
regimen (2.5×1010 vp and 5×1010 vp dose levels, 56-day interval) followed by a booster vaccination 12 
months after the first vaccination. 
The initial planned total sample size was approximately 660 adolescent participants to be enrolled in a 
randomized  and  staggered  manner.  Randomization  was  to  be  stratified  by  study  site  and  age  group, 
with  half  of  the  participants  12  to  15  years,  inclusive,  and  half  of  the  participants  16  to  17  years, 
inclusive. 
The sample size for the adolescent participants was originally calculated based on assessment of non-
inferiority  (NI)  of  immune  responses  as  compared  to  adults.  More  specifically,  demonstrating  NI  of 
immune responses induced by the 1-dose or 2-dose vaccination regimen schedule of Ad26.COV2.S (at 
2.5x1010 vp or 5x1010 vp) in adolescents as compared to 1 dose or 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp 
in adults were among the objectives of COV2001. 
The  safety  profile  of  the  Ad26.COV2.S  vaccine  doses  (2.5×1010  vp  and  5×1010  vp  dose  levels)  in 
adolescents  was  planned  to  be  assessed  separately  by  age  group  and  by escalating  dose,  with  the  2 
adolescent  age  groups  (12  to  15  years  and  16  to  17  years)  assessed  independently  and  enrolment 
progressing  in  a  sequential  manner.  The  safety  and  tolerability  of  the  Ad26.COV2.S  vaccine  was 
assessed  in  the  first  instance  in  a  group  of  sentinels  at  Day  4  post-vaccination,  and  subsequently,  in 
the  larger  safety  cohort  at  Day  8  post-vaccination.  The  Day  4  and  Day  8  post-vaccination  safety 
profiles  of  the  Ad26.COV2.S  vaccine  at  the  2.5×1010  vp  dose  level  in  the  sentinel  and  safety  cohorts 
were  to  be  assessed  in  participants  at  16  to  17  years  of  age,  by  the  Safety  Monitoring  Committee 
(SMC) before progressing to enrolment of the sentinel group of participants at 12 to 15 years of age.

When reactogenicity data after the first vaccination of the initial 33 adolescent participants (sentinels 
as part of the safety cohort) in the 16- to 17-year-old age group at a dose level of 2.5×1010 vp  was 
evaluated,  it  was  concluded  that  reactogenicity  was  higher  in  adolescents  than  in  adults  vaccinated 
with  Ad26.COV2.S  at  the  5×1010  vp  dose  level  but  considered  acceptable  by  the  Independent  Data 
Monitoring  Committee  (IDMC)  (4  April  2021)  and  MHRA  (7  April  2021).  Shortly  thereafter,  the  entire 
Ad26.COV2.S COVID-19 vaccine program was paused to evaluate a safety concern of thrombosis with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome (TTS) in adults. During this pause, the immunogenicity data for these 33 
adolescent participants was evaluated. 
Immunogenicity in adolescent population with 2.5×1010 vp dose was higher than in adults vaccinated 
with Ad26.COV2.S at the 5×1010 vp dose level. Based on the reactogenicity and immunogenicity data 
from the 2.5×1010 vp dose in the adolescent participants, the MAH (sponsor of COV2001) decided to 
not  evaluate  the  5×1010  vp  dose  level  in  the  adolescent  population.  The  MAH  also  decided  to  stop 
enrolment and vaccination of adolescents and to stop to further evaluate vaccination of the paediatric 
population in a separate dose-finding study (Protocol Amendment 6). 
The 33 adolescents already enrolled at the time of protocol Amendment 6 continued to be followed in 
accordance  with  the  planned  schedule  of  activities,  but  further  enrolment  of  adolescent  participants 
was stopped. 
Hence  for  this  procedure,  data  related  to  the  safety,  reactogenicity,  and  immunogenicity  of  a  single 
dose of 2.5×1010 vp of Ad26.COV2.S in the adolescent population 16- to 17-year-old were submitted. 
Objectives: 
Note that due to the recruitment stop for the adolescent population (protocol Amendment 6), only the 
modified  objectives  and  endpoints  as  presented  in  protocol  Amendment  6  were  specified  by  the  MAH 
for this procedure and they are listed below. 
The primary objective for the adolescent participants in this study was: 
• 
To  assess  the  safety  and  reactogenicity  of  a single  dose  of  Ad26.COV2.S,  administered  IM  at 
the 2.5×1010 dose level. 
The secondary objectives for the adolescent participants in this study were: 
• 
• 
To assess the humoral immune response to a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at the 2.5×1010 vp 
dose level, 28 days after vaccination. 
To assess the humoral immune response to Ad26.COV2.S at the 2.5×1010 vp dose level, at all 
blood collection timepoints. 
Data analysed: 
The  submitted  final  analysis  CSR  includes  results  from  the  final  analysis  for  the  adult  and  adolescent 
participants, when all included participants had completed the last visit, or discontinued earlier. 
More specifically for adolescent participants, the submitted final CSR includes 
•  Safety and reactogenicity data for the adolescent participants, which included data collected up 
to the end of study: solicited AEs through 7 days post-dose 1; unsolicited AEs through 28 days 
post-dose 1; deaths, SAEs, AEs leading to vaccine discontinuation, suspected AESIs throughout 
the study. 
•  Available  immunogenicity  data  (wtVNA,  psVNA,  S-ELISA)  for  the  adolescent  participants 
collected up to the end of study: neutralizing antibody responses (wtVNA, psVNA) and binding 
antibody responses (S-ELISA) up to Day 169. Note that the Day 337 time point is not included

in the tables and graphs because all participants were positive for N-serology or were excluded 
from the Per Protocol Immunogenicity (PPI) population due to major protocol deviations at Day 
337 as evidenced in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) dataset. 
•  Available  SARS-CoV-2  infection  data  (PCR  test,  N-ELISA)  for  the  adolescent  participants 
collected  up  to  the  end  of  study:  PCR  tests  were  performed  on  nasal  swabs  collected  by  or 
from  participants  with  COVID-19-like  symptoms  and  N-ELISA  was  performed  at  Days  1,  169, 
and 337. 
Criteria for safety evaluation: 
Adverse  events  and  special  reporting  situations,  whether  serious  or  non-serious,  related  to  study 
procedures or non-investigational sponsor products were reported for all participants from the time a 
signed  and  dated  Informed  Consent  Form  (ICF)  was  obtained  until  the  end  of  the  study/early 
withdrawal. 
There  was  a  1-hour  on-site  post-vaccination  assessment  for  the  presence  of any  acute  reactions  and 
solicited events (listed below). On a daily basis, for 8 days post vaccination (i.e. day of vaccination and 
the subsequent 7 days), participants were asked to record symptoms of the following adverse events 
(AEs) in a diary: 
•  Solicited  local  AEs:  injection  site  pain/tenderness,  erythema  (measured  using  the  ruler 
supplied), and swelling, (measured using the ruler supplied). 
•  Solicited systemic AEs: fatigue, headache, nausea, myalgia, and pyrexia/fever. 
•  Body  temperature  was  to  be  measured  at  approximately  the  same  time  each  day  using  the 
thermometer supplied. 
Unsolicited  AEs  were  recorded  from  the  time  of  each  vaccination  until  28  days  post  vaccination  and 
were captured on the Adverse Event pages of the electronic case report form (eCRF). Unsolicited AEs 
with the onset date outside the timeframe defined above (>28 days after previous study vaccination) 
which were ongoing on the day of the subsequent vaccination were recorded as such. 
All  SAEs  and  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  from  the  study/vaccination  were  recorded  for  all 
participants from the moment of first vaccination until completion of the participant’s last study-related 
procedure. Any respiratory tract infection fulfilling the criteria of an SAE were reported as such during 
the  entire  study.  If  the  molecular  test  was  positive  for  SARS-CoV-2,  the  SAE  was  excluded  from  the 
SAE analysis in the clinical study report and was tabulated separately. 
All AEs were to be followed until resolution or until clinically stable. The outcome of AEs at the end of 
study is provided in participant listings submitted in this procedure. 
In  the  event  of  a  serious  or  unexpected  adverse  event,  the  medical  monitor  was  notified.  Suspected 
unexpected  associated  serious  adverse  reactions  (SUSARs)  were  immediately  reported  to  the 
Independent Ethics Committee (IEC) by the investigator, and to the appropriate health authorities by 
the sponsor. 
Adverse  events  were  graded  for  severity  using  a  modified  version  of  the  Food  &  Drug  Administration 
(FDA) grading table, based on version of September 2007. Adverse events not identified in the grading 
table were graded as described in the protocol. 
From  the  time  of  local  approval  of  protocol  Amendment  5  onwards,  TTS  was  considered  to  be  an 
Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI). Suspected AESIs (thrombotic events and thrombocytopenia 
[defined as platelet count below 150,000/μL]) were recorded from the moment of vaccination until the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

end  of  the  study/early  withdrawal.  An  AESI  Adjudication  Committee  with  appropriate  expertise  was 
established to evaluate each suspected AESI and determine whether it was a case of TTS. 
Testing  for  anti-platelet  factor  4  antibodies  was  added  as  an  exploratory  endpoint  to  fully  evaluate 
coagulation  parameters  in  adult  (Protocol  Amendment  5)  and  adolescent  (Protocol  Amendment  6) 
participants.  The  results  of  activation  of  coagulation  and  APS  assessments  were  presented  in  a 
separate  Hematology  Laboratory  Results  report  as  an  addendum  to  the  primary  analysis  CSR. 
Additional results from this analysis will be reported separately as available. 
Immunogenicity evaluation: 
Planned humoral immunogenicity assays included:  
•  SARS-CoV-2 neutralization antibodies to the reference strain by using: 
o  Wild-type Virus neutralisation assay (WT-VNA) (Victoria/1/2020 strain) of Public Health 
England (PHE): Qualified assay  
o  Pseudovirion VNA (psVNA) (B.1 D614G) of Monogram: Validated assay 
•  Binding antibodies against the SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein by using the validated S-ELISA assay 
of Nexelis. 
•  Binding  antibodies  against  the  SARS-CoV-2  Nucleocapsid  protein  to  detect  previous  infection 
with SARS-CoV-2 by using the validated N-ELISA of Nexelis. 
Humoral 
immunogenicity  assays  have  already  been  assessed 
in  previous  procedures 
(EMEA/H/C/005737/0000, EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0033 and EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0053). 
At  time  of  analysis  of  the  COV2001  adolescent  samples  with  the  WT-VNA,  this  assay  was  qualified. 
However, the validation report of the WT-VNA was assessed in procedure EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0053. 
It  was  concluded 
that 
the  conclusions  obtained 
from  previous  wtVNA  assessments 
in 
VAC31518COV1001,  VAC31518COV1002  and  VAC31518COV2001  are  not  impacted  by  the  wtVNA 
validation and change in LLOQ (refer to EMEA/H/C/005737/II/0033). 
Due  to  poor  correlation  of  the  psVNA  with  the  wtVNA  and  lack  of  sensitivity  of  the  psVNA,  the  MAH 
considered the wtVNA as the main assay to measure virus neutralisation, which is supported. 
Statistical methods: 
Sample  size  for  the  adolescent  participants  was  originally  calculated  based  on  assessment  of  non-
inferiority  of  immune  responses  as  compared  to  adults.  However,  in  view  of  reactogenicity  and 
immunogenicity  data  after  the  first  vaccination  of  the  initial  33  adolescent  participants  (sentinels  as 
part  of  the  safety  cohort)  in  the  16-  to  17-year-old  age  group  at  a  dose  level  of  2.5×1010  vp,  the 
sponsor decided to stop further enrolment. 
Analysis Sets: 
For purposes of analysis, the following populations were defined: 
• 
• 
The  Full  Analysis  Set  (FAS)  included  all  participants  with  at  least  one  vaccine  administration 
documented. 
The  Per  Protocol  Immunogenicity  (PPI)  population  included  all  randomized  and  vaccinated 
participants  for  whom  immunogenicity  data  were  available.  Samples  taken  after  a  participant 
met  the  criteria  for  a  major  protocol  deviation  expected  to  impact  the  immunogenicity 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/738/2023

outcomes  were  excluded  from  the  PPI  analysis.  In  addition,  samples  obtained  after  missed 
vaccinations  or  participants  with  natural  SARS-CoV-2  infection  occurring  after  screening  (if 
applicable)  were  excluded  from  the  analysis.  SARS-CoV-2  infection  was  defined  as  a  positive 
PCR test or positive N-serology. 
Safety: 
No  formal  statistical  testing  of  safety  data  was  planned.  Safety  data  (summaries  of  AEs,  hematology 
results,  vital  sign  measurements,  physical  examinations,  and  pregnancy  testing)  were  analyzed 
descriptively by vaccine group. All safety analyses were done on the FAS. 
Immunogenicity: 
Descriptive  statistics  (geometric  mean  and  confidence  intervals  [CIs],  or  median  and  interquartile 
range  Q1-Q3,  as  appropriate)  were  calculated  for  continuous  immunologic  parameters.  Several 
definitions  of  serological  response  were  applied  (fold  increases  in  GMT  [VNA]  or  GMC  [ELISA]). 
Graphical representations of immunologic parameters were made as applicable. Frequency tabulations 
were calculated for discrete (qualitative) immunologic parameters, as applicable. 
For  the  wtVNA  assay,  a  participant  was  considered  a  responder  if  at  least  one  of  the  following 
conditions was met: 
• 
• 
The baseline sample value was less than or equal to the LLOQ (≤LLOQ) and the post-baseline 
sample was greater than the LLOQ (>LLOQ). 
The baseline sample value was greater than the LLOQ (>LLOQ) and the post-baseline sample 
value represented an at least 4-fold (≥4-fold) increase from the baseline sample value. 
Results 
Participant flow, Recruitment and Baseline data 
Of the 44 participants screened in the adolescent cohort, 33 were randomized, received 1 dose of the 
study  vaccine,  and  were  included  in  the  FAS  (2.5×1010  group  [N=30]  and  PL  group  [N=3]).  None  of 
the participants discontinued study vaccination. 
Within this adolescent group there were more female participants (66.7%) than male participants. The 
majority were white (97%) and BMI ranged from 17.0 to 28.2 kg/m2.  
Number analysed 
Per Protocol Immunogenicity (PPI) set analysis. 
SARS-CoV-2 serostatus at baseline was determined by Day 1 S- or N-serology assessed by ELISA, or 
screening PCR test, with a subject being declared seropositive if one of these tests was positive. 3 
participants were positive using these 3 assays and were removed from the per protocol 
immunogenicity (PPI) set analysis. 
Clinical immunogenicity 
The  MAH  submitted  humoral  immunogenicity  (neutralizing  and  binding  antibody)  results  up  to 
Day 169.  The  MAH  specifies  that  the  Day  337  time  point  was  not  included  in  the  tables  and  graphs 
because all participants were positive for N-serology or were excluded from the PPI population due to 
major protocol deviations at Day 337.

The  data  of  the  immunogenicity  analyses  performed  in  adolescents  (16  to  17  yoa)  at  all  time  points 
measured  (Day  29,  57,  85,  and  169)  collectively  indicate  that  administration  of  a  single  dose  of 
2.5x1010  vp  of  Ad26.COV2.S  elicits  specific  neutralising  and  binding  humoral  responses  up  to  6 
months, which is the last timepoint measured in adolescent participants. 
Based  on  the  data  obtained  using  wtVNA,  an  increase  in  neutralizing  antibody  levels  was  observed 
from baseline up to 6 months post vaccination in Ad26.COV2.S immunised adolescents (responder rate 
of  100%),  while  no  increase  in  neutralizing  antibody  response  was  observed  in  the  placebo  group 
(N=3). IC50 geometric mean titers of 305, 323, 306 and 342 were respectively measured on Days 29, 
57,  85  and  169  (Figure  1).  Detectable  baseline  levels  of  SARS-COV-2  IC50  were  detected  in  2/27 
adolescent  participants  who  received  the  single  dose  of  Ad26.COV2.S,  potentially  indicative  of 
exposure  to  SARS-COV-2  prior  to  enrolment.  Both  participants  were  responders  at  all  timepoints 
measured. 
Based  on  the  data  obtained  using  the  psVNA  assay,  an  increase  in  neutralizing  antibody  levels  was 
observed  from  baseline  up  to  6  months  post  vaccination  in  adolescents  participants  who  received 
Ad26.COV2.S  (2.5x1010  vp).  No  increase  in  (psVNA)  neutralizing  antibody  response  was  observed  in 
the placebo groups. On Days 29, 57, 85 and 169, GMTs of 103, 146, 186 and 168, respectively, were 
observed.  Responder  rates  based  on  psVNA  data  were  respectively  of  59%,  78%,  82%  and  80%  on 
Days 29, 57, 85 and 169.

Binding antibody responses specific to the SARS-CoV-2 S antigen were also measured by ELISA (Table 
1).  Data  obtained  from  the  27  adolescent  participants  who  received  Ad26.COV2.S  (2.5x1010  vp) 
showed  an  increase  in  binding  antibody  concentrations  28  days  post  Ad26.COV2.S  vaccination, 
representing an increase in GMI from baseline of approximately 13-fold. On Days 29, 57, 85 and 169, 
geometric  mean  concentrations  (GMCs)  of  682,  770,  773  and  796  were  respectively  observed  with 
overlapping 95% CI. The responder rate was of 100%. No increase in binding antibody response was 
observed in the placebo groups.

The MAH’s conclusion that administration of a single dose of 2.5x1010 vp of Ad26.COV2.S to 
adolescents 16 to 17 yoa elicits specific neutralising and binding humoral responses up to 6 months is 
endorsed. 
The MAH also performed analyses comparing humoral immunogenicity results from adolescents (16 to 
17 yoa) of COV2001 and young adults (18 to 25 years of age) in other studies. At all timepoints 
compared (Day 29, 57, 85 and 169), SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing and Spike-specific binding antibody

responses in adolescents aged 16 to 17 years after a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 2.5×1010 vp were 
similar to those in young adults aged 18 to 25 years after a single dose of Ad26.COV2.S at 5×1010 vp. 
As specified by the MAH, the small sample size for adolescents and young adults prevents robust 
conclusions from being drawn. This is endorsed and comparative analyses were therefore not detailed 
in this assessment report. 
Concerning the data obtained with the wtVNA as compared to the psVNA, the results question the 
correlation of the results between both methods and the lower sensitivity of the psVNA as previously 
mentioned in other procedures (EMEA/H/C/005737/II/33 and EMEA/H/C/005737/II/53). This is 
exemplified in this procedure by the differences in percentages of responder rates estimated by wtVNA 
(100% at all time-points tested) as compared to psVNA (ranging from 59%, 78%, 82% and 80%). 
Efficacy results 
Efficacy was not assessed in study COV2001. 
Safety results 
Safety data for the small set of 33 adolescents aged 16 to 17 years inclusive were submitted. 
More specifically, the MAH submitted:  
• 
• 
solicited local and systemic AEs reported during the 7-day post-vaccination phase (Table 2), 
unsolicited  AEs  reported  during  the  28-day  post-vaccination  phase  (unrelated  and  related 
events)  and  during  the  follow-up  phase  (>28  days  post  vaccination)  (related  events  only) 
(Table 5). 
Deaths,  SAEs,  and  AESIs  (i.e.,  TTS),  as  well  as  AEs  leading  to  permanent  discontinuation  of 
vaccination, reported during the study were also discussed by the MAH. There were no SAEs, deaths, 
or unsolicited AEs leading to vaccine discontinuation reported in the adolescent participants (Table 5). 
There were no suspected AESIs reported in adolescents. 
Solicited Local and Systemic Adverse Events 
The  majority  of  solicited  AEs  were  of  Grade  1  or  2  severity.  Solicited  AEs  of  Grade  3  or  higher  were 
recorded for 9 (30.0%) participants in the active vaccine group (N=30) and none in the placebo group 
(N=3).

Overall  Summary  of  Solicited  Adverse  Events;  Adolescent  Subjects, 
The majority of solicited local AEs were of Grade 1 or 2 severity. The most common solicited local AEs 
was  vaccination  site  pain,  reported  in  29  (96.7%)  participants  in  the  active  vaccine  group  and  1 
(33.3%) participant in the placebo group (Table 3). Solicited local AEs of Grade 3 severity (vaccination 
site pain) were reported by 3 (10.0%) participants in the active vaccine group and none in the placebo 
group.  No  solicited  local  AE  of  Grade  4  severity  was  reported.  All  solicited  local  AEs  were  considered 
related to the study vaccine by protocol definition.

The majority of solicited systemic AEs were of Grade 1 or 2 severity. All solicited systemic events were 
considered to be related to study vaccine: 28 (93.3%) participants in the active vaccine group and 3 
(100%)  in  the  placebo  group.  The  most  common  solicited  systemic  AEs  were  headache,  fatigue  and 
myalgia, reported in 25 (83.3%), 21 (70.0%) and 16 (53.3%) participants in the active vaccine group, 
respectively  (Table  4).  In  the  placebo  groups,  headache,  fatigue  and  myalgia,  were  reported  in  3 
(100.0%),  1  (33.3)  and  1  (33.3%)  participants,  respectively.  All  solicited  systemic  AEs  of  Grade  3 
were  considered  related  to  vaccination:  7  (23.3%)  participants  in  the  active  vaccine  group  and  none 
was recorded for participants in the placebo group. Four of these 7 participants experienced more than 
1 Grade 3 solicited systemic AE. No solicited systemic AEs of Grade 4 severity were reported.

(Study VAC31518COV2001)  
The MAH has mentioned that, in the active vaccine group, 1 participant had Grade 1 COVID-19 
infection which started at Day 111 during the post-dose 1 follow-up period and lasted for 21 days, and 
1 participant had Grade 1 COVID-19 infection which started at Day 114 during the post-dose 1 follow-
up period and lasted for 15 days. There were no cases in the placebo group. However, that MAH has 
not clarified which AEs were related to COVID-19. This issue is not further pursued.  
Other Safety Observations 
The  most  frequent  vital  sign  abnormalities  in  adolescent  participants  were  increased  respiratory  rate 
and  increased  pulse  rate.  All  reported  abnormalities  were  Grade  1  or  2  in  severity,  except  for  1 
participant  in  the  active  vaccine  group  who  had  a  Grade  3  respiratory  rate  (post-dose  1  follow-up), 
which was not considered as AE by the investigator. 
There were no cases of Grade 3 pyrexia reported in adolescent participants.

No  clinically  relevant  changes  from  baseline  were  identified  for  any  of  the  laboratory  parameters 
examined in the study. 
2.3.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The clinical results submitted by the MAH for this P46 procedure are limited. These results belong to a 
single  phase  2  trial  (COV2001)  that  was  originally  designed  as  a  randomized,  double-blind,  placebo-
controlled, multicenter, Phase 2a study in healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years inclusive, adults in good 
or  stable  health  aged  65  years  and  older,  and  in  healthy  adolescents  aged  12  to  17  years  inclusive. 
The aim was to evaluate safety and immunogenicity of a range of dose levels and vaccination intervals 
of Ad26.COV2.S. 
Concerning  the  adolescent  population  (12  to  17  years  of  age,  inclusive),  the  initial  planned  total 
sample  size  was  approximately  660  adolescent  participants  to  be  enrolled  in  a  randomized  and 
staggered  manner  to  receive  placebo  or  intramuscular  JCOVDEN  at  the  2.5x1010  or  5x1010  vp  dose 
level,  as  a  1-dose  or  a  2-dose  vaccination  regimen  schedule  followed  by  a  booster  vaccination  12 
months after the first vaccination. Randomization was to be stratified by study site and age group, with 
half of the participants 12 to 15 years, inclusive, and half of the participants 16 to 17 years, inclusive. 
Sample  size  for  the  adolescent  participants  was  originally  calculated  based  on  assessment  of  non-
inferiority of immune responses as compared to adults. More specifically, demonstrating NI of immune 
responses induced by the 1-dose or 2-dose vaccination regimen schedule of Ad26.COV2.S (at 2.5x1010 
vp or 5x1010 vp) in adolescents as compared to 1 dose or 2 doses of Ad26.COV2.S 5x1010 vp in adults 
was among the objectives of COV2001. 
Only a very limited number of adolescent participants aged 16 to 17 years inclusive were randomized 
(N=33) to COV2001 and received a single dose of the study vaccine (2.5×1010 vp, N=30) or placebo 
(N=3). 
This  limited  number  of  paediatric  study  participant  is  a  consequence  of  changes  in  the  paediatric 
development  plan  of  JCOVDEN,  as  it  was  decided  to  stop  the  further  clinical  development  supporting 
the paediatric indication. 
Concerning  the  humoral  immunogenicity  results  submitted,  the  conclusion  that  these  indicate  that 
administration of a single dose of 2.5x1010 vp of Ad26.COV2.S elicits specific neutralising and binding 
humoral responses up to 6 months is endorsed. 
The MAH concluded that the reactogenicity in the 30 adolescents aged 16 to 17 years vaccinated with 
the 2.5×1010 vp dose was higher than in adults vaccinated with the 5×1010 vp dose. Solicited local and 
systemic  AEs  were  more  frequently  reported  in  the  adolescents  in  this  study  than  in  adults  (Cf. 
approved  Summary  Product  Characteristics  (SmPC)):  vaccination  site  pain  (96.7%  vs.  54.3%, 
respectively),  headache  (83.3%  vs.  43%),  fatigue  (70%  vs.  44%),  myalgia  (53.3%  vs.  38.1%),  and 
pyrexia (16.7% vs. 7.2%). 
Moreover, the MAH states that “… the results from the safety and reactogenicity analyses suggest that 
Ad26.COV2.S  administered  at  2.5×1010  vp  dose  level  in  adolescents  aged  16  to  17  years  had  an 
acceptable safety and reactogenicity profile”.  
However,  no  conclusion  on  the  reactogenicity  and  safety  of  JCOVDEN  in  the  tested  adolescent 
population can be drawn with the limited available data. 
Overall,  submitted  data  are  only  descriptive  and  do  not  allow  to  draw  robust  conclusions  on  the 
reactogenicity, safety and immunogenicity of JCOVDEN in this paediatric (adolescent) population.

Of note, another phase 2 paediatric study (COV3006) is ongoing to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, 
and  immunogenicity  of  different  dose  levels  of  Ad26.COV2.S  administered  as  a  one-  or  two-dose 
regimen  in  healthy  adolescents  from  12  to  17  years  inclusive.  Part  1  of  this  study  (dose  selection 
cohort)  is  ongoing  but  the  Part  2  (expansion  cohort)  is  not  planned  to  be  conducted  any  longer.  No 
data are yet available.  
The modification of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) (EMEA-002880-PIP01-20-M01) into a waiver 
for the entire paediatric population was recently agreed by the Paediatric Committee (PDCO) based on 
the  grounds  of  lack  of  significant  therapeutic  benefit  over  existing  vaccines.  This  was  based  on  the 
consideration  that  it  will  be  not  feasible  to  clearly  define/quantify  the  risk  of  thrombosis  with 
thrombocytopenia syndrome in the paediatric population, the course of COVID-19 is generally mild in 
the  paediatric  population  and  other  vaccines  with  a  better-known  safety  profile  are  authorised  in  the 
paediatric population. 
3.   Overall conclusion and recommendation 
Only limited reactogenicity, safety and immunogenicity data obtained in adolescents (16-17 yoa) after 
a single dose of 2.5x1010 vp JCOVDEN in study COV2001 were provided. Data are only descriptive, and 
no  robust  conclusions  can  be  drawn.  As  it  was  decided  to  stop  the  further  clinical  development  of 
JCOVDEN to support the paediatric indication, the post authorisation measure is considered fulfilled.

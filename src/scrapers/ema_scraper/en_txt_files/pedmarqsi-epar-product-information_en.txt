4. 
CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Pedmarqsi is indicated for the prevention of ototoxicity induced by cisplatin chemotherapy in patients 
1 month to < 18 years of age with localised, non-metastatic, solid tumours. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Pedmarqsi is intended for hospital use only, under the supervision of an appropriately qualified 
physician. 
Posology 
The recommended dose of sodium thiosulfate for the prevention of cisplatin-induced ototoxicity is 
weight based and normalised to body surface area according to the table below: 
Body Weight 
> 10 kg 
5 to 10 kg 
< 5 kg

Pre-treatment with antiemetics is recommended to reduce the incidence of nausea and vomiting (see 
section 4.4). 
Special populations 
Preterm and term newborn infants from birth to less than 1 month of age 
Sodium thiosulfate is contraindicated in preterm and term newborn infants from birth to less than 
1 month of age (see sections 4.3 and 4.4).

Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with renal impairment (see section 5.2). Due to the 
sodium content of sodium thiosulfate, there is an increased risk of adverse reactions in patients with 
renal impairment (see section 4.4).  
Hepatic impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with hepatic impairment (see section 5.2).  
Method of administration  
For intravenous use.  
Due to the hypertonic formulation, administration through a central vein is recommended.  
For single use only.  
Sodium thiosulfate is administered as a 15-minute infusion. 
Time of administration in relation to cisplatin 
The timing of sodium thiosulfate administration relative to cisplatin chemotherapy is critical.  
If sodium thiosulfate is administered: 
• 
Less than 6 hours after end of cisplatin infusion:  may reduce cisplatin efficacy against the 
tumour 
More than 6 hours after end of cisplatin infusion:  may not be effective in preventing ototoxicity 
• 
Only use sodium thiosulfate following cisplatin infusion duration of 6 hours or less. Do not use 
sodium thiosulfate if: 
• 
• 
Cisplatin infusion exceeds 6 hours, or  
A subsequent cisplatin infusion is planned within 6 hours 
When cisplatin is administered on consecutive days, ensure a minimum 6-hour gap after sodium 
thiosulfate infusion before a subsequent cisplatin infusion is given. 
After end of cisplatin infusion: 
• 
Provide highly effective multi-agent intravenous antiemetic therapy 30 minutes prior to 
administration of sodium thiosulfate i.e. 5.5 hours after completion of cisplatin infusion

4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Hypersensitivity 
Hypersensitivity reactions were reported in clinical studies following the administration of sodium 
thiosulfate (see section 4.8). Symptoms included rash, tachycardia, chills and dyspnoea. 
Sodium thiosulfate may contain a trace amount of sodium sulfite. It may rarely cause several 
hypersensitivity reactions and bronchospasm. Sulfite sensitivity is seen more frequently in asthmatic 
than in non-asthmatic people. 
Antihistamines (e.g. diphenhydramine and steroids) should be immediately available to administer in 
the event of an allergic reaction. If the reaction is such that the patient is to continue with sodium 
thiosulfate after the next cisplatin administration, premedication with antihistamines should be given 
and the patient observed carefully. 
Electrolyte imbalance 
A 12.8 g/m2 dose delivers a sodium load of 162 mmol/m2, a 9.6 g/m2 dose delivers a sodium load of 
121 mmol/m2 and a 6.4 g/m2 dose delivers a sodium load of 81 mmol/m2. Electrolyte balance and 
blood pressure should be monitored carefully, and sodium thiosulfate should not be given if serum 
sodium is > 145 mmol/litre at baseline before sodium thiosulfate is administered within a treatment 
cycle. 
Patients < 1 month of age have less well-developed sodium homeostasis; therefore, sodium thiosulfate 
is contraindicated in neonates (see section 4.3). 
Serum magnesium, potassium and phosphate levels should also be monitored, and supplementation 
given if needed as the combination of fluid loading in association with cisplatin-based chemotherapy 
and the administration of sodium thiosulfate may cause transient electrolyte disturbance. 
Nausea and vomiting 
Transient increases in incidence and severity of nausea and vomiting may be observed with sodium 
thiosulfate infusion, due to the high sodium levels administered over a short time period (see 
section 4.8). In addition to any prophylactic antiemetics administered prior to cisplatin administration, 
additional multi-agent antiemetics should be given in the 30 minutes prior to sodium thiosulfate 
administration. Nausea and vomiting tend to stop soon after the sodium thiosulfate infusion has 
finished. 
Renal impairment 
Sodium thiosulfate is known to be substantially excreted by the kidney (see section 5.2), and the risk 
of adverse reactions of sodium thiosulfate may be greater in patients with impaired renal function. 
Because cisplatin chemotherapy is associated with renal toxicity, renal function should be monitored 
and caution applied with close monitoring of electrolytes if the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) falls 
below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. 
Excipients with known effect 
This medicinal product contains 0.25 mg/mL boric acid as a buffer. Boric acid can affect fertility when 
chronically administered at doses greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day. This medicinal product is administered 
between 6-30 times intermittently over a 6-month period in conjunction with cisplatin chemotherapy. 
Along with boric acid from drinking water, this amounts to 0.17-0.22 mg/kg/day depending on the age 
and size of the child.

This medicinal product contains 23 mg sodium per mL, equivalent to 1.15% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult. This is also equivalent to 1.15-2.1% 
of the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) safe daily intake of 1.1-2 g sodium for children aged 
1 to 17 years and equivalent to 11.5% of the EFSA safe daily intake of 0.2 g in babies aged 7 to 11 
months. This has to be taken into consideration for patients on a controlled sodium diet. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Sodium thiosulfate should only be given at least 6 hours after the end of cisplatin infusion. Sodium 
thiosulfate should not be given when cisplatin is infused for longer than 6 hours or if a subsequent 
cisplatin infusion is planned within 6 hours (see section 4.2). The delayed administration prevents 
potential interference with cisplatin chemotherapy efficacy against the tumour. 
No other interaction studies have been performed. Relevant pharmacokinetic interactions are unlikely 
as administration of thiosulfate is infrequent, only in conjunction with cisplatin and thiosulfate is 
rapidly eliminated within hours after administration. Sodium thiosulfate potentially induces CYP2B6 
(see section 5.2). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited amount of data from the use of sodium thiosulfate in pregnant women. 
Animal studies are insufficient with respect to reproductive toxicity with intravenous infusion of 
sodium thiosulfate (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
sodium thiosulfate during pregnancy.  
Sodium thiosulfate is only intended to be administered in conjunction with cisplatin chemotherapy. 
Cisplatin is not used during pregnancy unless the clinician considers the risk in an individual patient to 
be clinically justified. Patients receiving cisplatin are warned of the need to use appropriate 
contraception during treatment and for 6 months following cisplatin treatment, as cisplatin is 
embryotoxic and fetotoxic.  
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether sodium thiosulfate/metabolites are excreted in human milk. A risk to  
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of 
sodium thiosulfate during breast-feeding. 
Sodium thiosulfate is only intended to be administered in conjunction with cisplatin chemotherapy, 
during which breastfeeding is contraindicated in female patients. 
Fertility 
There are no clinical data available on the effects of sodium thiosulfate on fertility. There is 
insufficient information from animal studies to assess the effects of intravenous infusion of sodium 
thiosulfate on fertility. 
Sodium thiosulfate is only intended to be administered in conjunction with cisplatin chemotherapy. 
Cisplatin treatment is known to adversely affect fertility.  
This medicinal product contains 0.25 mg/mL boric acid which can affect fertility when chronically 
administered at doses greater than 0.2 mg/kg/day (see section 4.4). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Sodium thiosulfate has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The most serious adverse reaction is hypersensitivity, observed at a frequency of ≥ 1 case per 
10 patients (11%) (see section 4.4).  
The most commonly reported adverse reactions with a frequency of ≥ 1 case per 10 patients are 
vomiting (44%), nausea (23%), hypernatraemia (19%), hypophosphataemia (18%) and hypokalaemia 
(21%). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
Table 1 presented below is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and Preferred 
Term Level) and frequency. Frequencies have been evaluated according to the following convention: 
very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare 
(≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of decreasing

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Nausea and vomiting 
Administration of sodium thiosulfate is associated with a high incidence of nausea and vomiting. This 
nausea and vomiting tends to stop soon after the sodium thiosulfate infusion has finished (see section 
4.4).  
Hypernatraemia 
A 12.8 g/m2 dose delivers a sodium load of 162 mmol/m2, a 9.6 g/m2 dose delivers a sodium load of 
121 mmol/m2 and a 6.4 g/m2 dose delivers a sodium load of 81 mmol/m2. In clinical studies doses of 
sodium thiosulfate equivalent to these resulted in a small, transient increase in serum sodium levels, 
independent of age, body surface area, body weight, total daily sodium thiosulfate dose or cisplatin 
cycle. Sodium levels return to baseline by 18 hours or 24 hours after administration.  
Electrolyte imbalance 
Hypophosphataemia  and  hypokalaemia  are  very  common  following  sodium  thiosulfate  treatment. 
Electrolyte balance and blood pressure should be monitored carefully (see section 4.4).  
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Excessive doses of sodium thiosulfate may be expected to produce severe nausea and vomiting as well 
as electrolyte imbalance, changes to blood pressure and acidosis. Treatment of an overdose should 
consist of general supportive measures including administration of fluids and observation of the 
clinical status of the patient. There is no specific antidote for overdose with sodium thiosulfate.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: not yet assigned, ATC code: not yet assigned 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of sodium thiosulfate protection against ototoxicity is not fully understood, but may 
include increasing levels of endogenous antioxidants, inhibition of intracellular oxidative stress, and 
direct interaction between cisplatin and the thiol group in sodium thiosulfate to produce inactive 
platinum species. 
Concurrent incubation of sodium thiosulfate with cisplatin decreased the in vitro cytotoxicity of 
cisplatin to tumour cells; delaying the addition of sodium thiosulfate to these cultures prevented the 
protective effect. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
The is no clinical pharmacodynamic information available beyond that given within the mechanism of 
action section.  
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of sodium thiosulfate (STS) in preventing cisplatin (CIS)-induced ototoxicity was studied 
in two multicentre studies in which 112 paediatric patients with various solid tumour types were 
treated with STS following each administration of CIS. Safety has been established using 1 to 5 doses 
of sodium thiosulfate per chemotherapy cycle, with regimens varying from 1 dose of CIS+STS per 
cycle to 5 doses of CIS+STS per cycle. 
Study 1 – pivotal study 
Study 1 was a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label study to assess the efficacy and safety 
of STS in reducing ototoxicity in children receiving CIS chemotherapy for standard risk 
hepatoblastoma (SR-HB). Children between 1 month and 18 years of age with histologically 
confirmed newly diagnosed HB were eligible. Children were randomised 1:1 to receive STS after each 
CIS dose (CIS+STS arm) or to receive CIS alone. 
CIS was administered as a 6-hour intravenous infusion. Four courses of CIS were given pre-surgery 
and 2 additional courses were given post-surgery.  
In the CIS+STS arm, the STS intravenous infusion was administered over 15 minutes, beginning 
6 hours after completion of each CIS infusion. Doses of STS were dependent on the child’s weight as 
follows: children > 10 kg received an equivalent of 12.8 g/m2 STS, children ≥ 5 to ≤ 10 kg received an 
equivalent of 9.6 g/m2 STS, and children < 5 kg received an equivalent of 6.4 g/m2 STS.

A total of 129 children were registered and 114 children were randomised in the study (61 patients in 
the CIS+STS arm and 53 patients in the CIS Alone arm). Of the 114 patients randomised, 5 patients 
withdrew prior to treatment: 2 patients due to withdrawal of parental consent, 2 patients due to 
reclassification as high risk HB, and 1 due to ineligibility.  
Hearing loss was defined as a Brock Grade ≥ 1 measured using audiologic evaluations after the end of 
study treatment or at an age of at least 3.5 years when a reliable result could be obtained, whichever 
was later. The proportion of children in the CIS+STS arm with hearing loss at age ≥ 3.5 years 
(20 children [35.1%]) was approximately one-half compared with the CIS Alone arm (35 children 
[67.3%] (Table 2). Event free survival and OS were also evaluated.

The risk of having hearing loss was statistically significantly lower in the CIS+STS arm compared 
with the CIS Alone arm, corresponding to a clinically meaningful 48% lower risk after STS treatment. 
At a median of 4.27 years of follow up, the hazard ratio between the treatment arms in Event-free 
survival (EFS) was ([CIS+STS vs CIS Alone]: 0.96; 95% CI: 0.42, 2.23) and in overall survival (OS) 
(hazard ratio: 0.48; 95% CI: 0.09, 2.61). 
Study 2 – supportive study 
Study 2 was a multicentre, randomised, controlled, open-label study to assess the efficacy and safety 
of STS in preventing hearing loss in children receiving CIS chemotherapy for the treatment of newly 
diagnosed germ cell tumour (25.6%), hepatoblastoma (5.6%), medulloblastoma (20.8%), 
neuroblastoma (20.8%), osteosarcoma (23.2%), atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumour (1.6%), choroid 
plexus carcinoma (0.8%), and anaplastic astrocytoma (0.8%); or any other malignancy treated with 
CIS; 7.5% had prior cranial radiation. Children between 1 year and 18 years of age and scheduled to 
receive a chemotherapy regimen that included a cumulative CIS dose of ≥ 200 mg/m2, with individual 
CIS doses to be infused over ≤ 6 hours, were eligible. Children were randomised 1:1 to receive either 
STS 6 hours after each CIS dose (CIS+STS) or chemotherapy that included CIS, without subsequent 
STS (CIS Alone). 
CIS was administered according to the sites’ disease-specific cancer treatment protocols in use at the 
time. When multiple daily doses of CIS were scheduled, the protocol stipulated at least a 10-hour 
delay between any STS infusion and the beginning of the next day’s CIS infusion. 
In the CIS+STS arm, 10.2 g/m2 STS was administered by intravenous infusion over 15 minutes, 
beginning 6 hours after the completion of each CIS infusion. A dose reduction was included for 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
children whose therapeutic protocol administered CIS on a per kg basis due to young age or low body 
weight, which was 341 mg/kg STS.  
The primary endpoint was the proportional incidence of hearing loss between the CIS+STS arm and 
the CIS alone arm, as defined by comparison of American Speech-language-Hearing Association 
(ASHA) criteria assessed at baseline and 4-weeks after the final course of cisplatin. EFS, i.e. presence 
or absence of tumour progression or recurrence or development of subsequent malignant neoplasm, 
and OS were also evaluated. 
A total of 131 children were registered and 125 children were randomised in the study (61 patients in 
the CIS+STS arm and 64 patients in the CIS Alone arm). Of the 125 patients randomised, 2 patients 
withdrew prior to treatment: 1 patient due to withdrawal of parental consent, and 1 due to investigator 
decision.  
In the 104 patients who had both baseline and 4-week follow-up hearing assessments, the proportion 
of children in the CIS+STS arm with hearing loss (14 patients [28.6%]) was approximately one-half of 
the proportion in the CIS Alone arm (31 patients [56.4%]) (Table 3).

The risk of having hearing loss was statistically significantly lower in the CIS+STS arm compared 
with the CIS Alone arm, corresponding to a clinically meaningful 48% lower risk after STS treatment. 
At a median of 5.33 years of follow up, the hazard ratio in EFS between arms was ([CIS+STS vs CIS 
Alone]: 1.27; 95% CI:  0.73, 2.18). A disparity in OS was observed (hazard ratio: 1.79; 95% CI:  0.86, 
3.72). In patients categorised post-hoc with localised disease, the hazard ratio between arms in EFS 
was (hazard ratio: 1.02; 95% CI:  0.49, 2.15) and in OS (hazard ratio: 1.23; 95% CI:  0.41, 3.66). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Sodium thiosulfate is poorly absorbed after oral administration and has to be administered 
intravenously. At the end of a sodium thiosulfate intravenous infusion, plasma levels of sodium 
thiosulfate are maximal and decline rapidly thereafter with a terminal elimination half-life of 
approximately 50 minutes. A return to pre-dose levels occurs within 3 to 6 hours after infusion. More 
than 95% of sodium thiosulfate excretion in urine occurs within the first 4 hours after administration. 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hence, there is no plasma accumulation when sodium thiosulfate is administered on 2 consecutive 
days. 
In children and adults, the maximum sodium thiosulfate plasma levels after a 15-minute infusion of a 
dose equivalent to 12.8 g/m2 was approximately 13 mM. Thiosulfate plasma levels change in a dose 
proportional manner. Age did not appear to influence the maximum plasma levels of sodium 
thiosulfate or the decline afterwards. A population PK model incorporating growth and maturation 
variables for the paediatric population showed that the predicted sodium thiosulfate plasma levels at 
the end of infusion were consistent across the recommended dose levels for the indicated age and body 
weight ranges. 
Distribution 
Sodium thiosulfate does not bind to human plasma proteins. Sodium thiosulfate is an inorganic salt 
and thiosulfate anions do not readily cross membranes. Hence, the volume of distribution appears 
largely confined to extracellular spaces and estimated at 0.23 L/kg in adults. In animals, sodium 
thiosulfate has been found to distribute to the cochlea. Distribution across the blood brain barrier or 
placenta appears absent or limited. Thiosulfate is an endogenous compound ubiquitously present in all 
cells and organs. Endogenous serum thiosulfate levels were 5.5 ± 1.8 µM in adult volunteers. 
Biotransformation 
Metabolites of sodium thiosulfate have not been determined as part of clinical studies. Thiosulfate is 
an endogenous intermediate product of sulfur-containing amino acid metabolism. Thiosulfate 
metabolism does not involve CYP enzymes; it is metabolised through thiosulfate sulfur transferase 
and thiosulfate reductase activity to sulfite, which is rapidly oxidised to sulfate. 
Elimination 
Sodium thiosulfate (thiosulfate) is excreted through glomerular filtration. After administration, 
thiosulfate levels in urine are high, and approximately half of the sodium thiosulfate dose is retrieved 
unchanged in urine, nearly all excreted within the first 4 hours after administration. Thiosulfate renal 
clearance compared well with inulin clearance as a measure for the GFR. 
Excretion of endogenously produced thiosulfate in bile was very low and did not increase after sodium 
thiosulfate administration. No mass balance studies have been performed, but it is expected that 
non-renal clearance will mainly result in renal excretion of sulfates. A small part of the sulfane sulfur 
of sodium thiosulfate may become part of endogenous cellular sulfur metabolism. 
Renal impairment 
In haemodialysis patients, total clearance of sodium thiosulfate was 2.04 ± 0.72 mL/min/kg (off 
dialysis) compared to 4.11 ± 0.77 mL/min/kg in healthy volunteers. This clearance was essentially 
similar to the non-renal clearance observed in the healthy volunteers (1.86 ± 0.45 mL/min/kg). In the 
absence of any glomerular filtration in haemodialysis patients, this only resulted in approximately a 
25% increase in the maximum thiosulfate plasma levels and nearly a 2-fold increase in total exposure. 
The plasma concentration of thiosulfate is deemed to be the most important parameter associated with 
the efficacy of the product. Moreover, the most frequent adverse reactions are considered to be related 
to the sodium load with sodium thiosulfate administration and concurrent electrolyte imbalances (see 
section 4.4). Non-clinical studies indicated that dose limiting acute effects were related to the sodium 
intake. Sodium thiosulfate is only intended to be administered in conjunction with cisplatin 
chemotherapy. Cisplatin is contraindicated in patients with pre-existing renal impairment and, 
therefore, in the absence of cisplatin administration sodium thiosulfate would not be administered. 
Hepatic impairment 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No information is available for use of sodium thiosulfate in patients with hepatic impairment. 
However, thiosulfate sulfur transferase/reductase activity is ubiquitous, including tissue like red blood 
cells, liver, kidney, intestine, muscle and brain. Therefore, the changes in thiosulfate pharmacokinetics 
in hepatically impaired patients are likely limited and without clinical significance.  
Interactions studies 
Sodium thiosulfate does not bind to human plasma proteins. The chemical properties of sodium 
thiosulfate, along with the observations that sodium thiosulfate does not distribute readily across 
membrane barriers and is excreted through glomerular filtration, make an interaction with membrane 
drug transporters unlikely. 
In vitro studies 
Cytochrome P450 enzymes 
Sodium thiosulfate is an inducer of CYP2B6 but not of CYP1A2 or CYP3A4. Sodium thiosulfate is 
not an inhibitor of CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 at 
clinically relevant concentrations. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Genotoxicity 
Sodium thiosulfate was not genotoxic in an in vitro bacterial reverse mutation assay (Ames test) with 
or without metabolic activation and was not clastogenic in an in vitro mammalian cell assay (sister 
chromatid exchange) using human peripheral lymphocytes. 
Carcinogenicity 
Long-term studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the potential carcinogenicity of 
sodium thiosulfate. 
Impairment of fertility 
There is insufficient information from animal studies to assess the effects of intravenous infusion of 
sodium thiosulfate on fertility.  
Developmental toxicity 
There is insufficient information from animal studies to assess developmental risks with intravenous 
infusion of sodium thiosulfate.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Pedmarqsi is and what it is used for 
Pedmarqsi contains the active substance sodium thiosulfate.  
Pedmarqsi is used to reduce the risk of hearing loss from the cancer medicine cisplatin. It is given to 
children and adolescents aged 1 month to 18 years who are being treated with cisplatin for solid 
tumours that have not spread to other areas of the body.  
2.  What you need to know before you or your child receives Pedmarqsi 
Do not give Pedmarqsi 
if the child is: 
- 
allergic to sodium thiosulfate or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6) 
a baby under the age of 1 month 
-  
Warnings and precautions  
Talk to a doctor or nurse before you or your child receives Pedmarqsi if the child: 
- 
has had an allergic reaction like a rash, hives or difficulty breathing after a previous dose of 
sodium thiosulfate 
has a known allergy to chemicals called sulfites – this may mean you or the child is more likely 
to have an allergic reaction to this medicine 
has poor kidney function or serious kidney disease 
needs a low salt diet because of another medical condition 
- 
- 
- 
Other medicines and Pedmarqsi 
Tell the doctor or nurse if you or your child is taking, has recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding  
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
This medicine should not be given if you or your child is pregnant (or could be pregnant), or is breast-
feeding. This medicine is only given after cisplatin chemotherapy and cisplatin can harm your baby. 
Discuss with your doctor whether there is a need for contraception both during treatment and for 
6 months after treatment. 
Pedmarqsi contains boric acid 
This medicine contains boric acid which may impair fertility when given chronically. 
Pedmarqsi contains sodium 
This medicine contains 23 mg sodium (main component of cooking/table salt) in each mL. This is 
equivalent to 1-2% of the safe dietary intake of sodium for children aged 1 to 17 years and 12% in 
babies aged 7 to 11 months.  
3. 
How Pedmarqsi is given 
Before you or your child will receive this medicine, he/she will be given anti-sickness medicines to 
help prevent vomiting. 
This medicine is a solution that is given as an infusion (drip) into a vein by a doctor or nurse. This is 
usually done via a tube inserted into a vein in the chest, known as a central line. The infusion is given 
over 15 minutes. Treatment is started 6 hours after the dose of cisplatin has finished. 
The dose of this medicine is worked out based on your size (body surface area) in m2, which is 
calculated from height and weight. The recommended dose for those weighing 10 kg or more is 12.8 g 
per m2; lower doses are given to those weighing less than 10 kg. Your doctor will work out the dose 
that is right for you or your child.  
If you or your child receives more Pedmarqsi than he/she should 
Because the dose is worked out and checked by healthcare professionals, it is unlikely that you or your 
child will be given the wrong amount. In case of overdose, you or your child may experience nausea, 
vomiting, changes to levels of sodium, phosphate or potassium in the blood, changes to blood pressure, 
or acidic blood (metabolic acidosis) which can cause nausea, vomiting, drowsiness and breathlessness. 
Your doctor may give you or your child symptomatic treatment for these side effects.  
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask the doctor or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
Serious side effects 
If you or your child has a severe allergic reaction to this medicine with symptoms such as a skin rash, 
tight chest, wheezing, shortness of breath or feeling cold you or they should tell a doctor or nurse 
immediately. 
Other side effects 
The other side effects seen with this medicine are usually mild. The side effects you or your child may 
experience are: 
Very common (may affect more than 1 in 10 people) 
• 
•

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only: 
Posology and method of administration 
Time of administration in relation to cisplatin 
The timing of sodium thiosulfate administration relative to cisplatin chemotherapy is critical.  
If sodium thiosulfate is administered: 
• 
Less than 6 hours after end of cisplatin infusion: may reduce cisplatin efficacy against the 
tumour 
More than 6 hours after end of cisplatin infusion: may not be effective in preventing ototoxicity. 
• 
Only use sodium thiosulfate following cisplatin infusion duration of 6 hours or less. Do not use 
sodium thiosulfate if: 
• 
• 
Cisplatin infusion exceeds 6 hours, or  
A subsequent cisplatin infusion is planned within 6 hours. 
When cisplatin is administered on consecutive days, ensure a minimum 6-hour gap after sodium 
thiosulfate infusion before a subsequent cisplatin infusion is given. 
After end of cisplatin infusion: 
• 
Provide highly effective multi-agent intravenous antiemetic therapy 30 minutes prior to 
administration of sodium thiosulfate i.e. 5.5 hours after completion of cisplatin infusion 
This medicine is a ready to use solution for infusion 
Prepare the required mL of sodium thiosulfate, 80 mg/mL, in a syringe or add to an empty, 
sterile infusion bag 
Stop cisplatin hydration fluid and flush line with sodium chloride 0.9% 
Infuse sodium thiosulfate over 15 minutes (6 hours after completion of cisplatin infusion) 
Flush line with sodium chloride 0.9% and restart the cisplatin hydration immediately afterwards

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK-MANAGEMENT PLAN
SUMMARY OF RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR GAVRETO 
(PRALSETINIB)
This is a summary of the risk-management plan (RMP) for Gavreto.  The RMP details 
important risks of Gavreto, how these risks can be minimized, and how more information 
will be obtained about Gavreto risks and uncertainties (missing information).
Gavreto SmPC and its package leaflet give essential information to healthcare 
professionals and patients on how Gavreto should be used. 
This summary of the RMP for Gavreto should be read in the context of all this 
information, including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language 
summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Gavreto RMP.
I. THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
Pralsetinib is indicated as monotherapy for the treatment of adult patients with RET 
fusion-positive advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC).
Further information about the evaluation of Gavreto benefits can be found in Gavreto
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA Web site, under 
the medicine’s Web page. 
II. RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO 
MINIMIZE OR FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS
Important risks of Gavreto, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Gavreto risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific Information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in 
the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging
 The authorized pack sizeThe amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so as to 
ensure that the medicine is used correctly.
 The medicine’s legal statusThe way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g., 
with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.

listed under “missing Information” below.
II.A LIST OF IMPORTANT RISKS AND MISSING INFORMATION
Important risks of Gavreto are risks that need special risk-management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
taken.  Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential.  Identified risks are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Gavreto.  Potential 
risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine is possible 
based on available data, but this association has not been established yet and needs 
further evaluation.  Missing information refers to information about the safety of the 
medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g., on the long-
term use of the medicine).

II.B SUMMARY OF IMPORTANT RISKS
Important Identified Risk: Pneumonitis
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Pneumonitis is considered a class effect of TKIs. Events of 
pneumonitis occurred commonly in the clinical 
development program for pralsetinib, in the overall safety 
population treated with 400 mg QD pralsetinib (10.8%) and 
across indications.  The observed rates for pralsetinib are 
in overall consistent with what would be expected with a 
TKI treatment for this population of patients with advanced 
cancer.
An analysis of the impact of four baseline demographic 
variables, namely age, gender, race and region, on the 
incidence of pneumonitis was performed. The results 
suggest that there does not appear to be a meaningful
difference in the incidence of pneumonitis by any of the 
criteria assessed. The majority of patients within the safety 
population had confounding factors for development of 
pneumonitis, such as prior history of pneumonitis, prior 
therapies (before initiation of pralsetinib) that are known to 
cause pneumonitis (e.g. pemetrexed, pembrolizumab, 
vandetanib, docetaxel, osimertinib), or external beam 
radiation to the chest/back/spine area.

Important Identified Risk: Hypertension
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
The non-clinical studies showed that pralsetinib doses ≥
25 mg/kg resulted in increased blood pressure in rats. 
These findings were confirmed in clinical setting, where 
30.8% of patients within the overall 400 mg QD pralsetinib 
safety population had events of hypertension (grouped 
events including events of hypertension and blood 
pressure increased); hypertension was commonly reported 
across indications. Inhibition of the kinase insert domain 
receptor and VEGFR has previously been associated 
clinically with hypertension, and the effects were seen with 
many TKIs, including cabozantinib, lenvatinib, and 
selpercatinib.
Risk factors and risk groups
No pralsetinib-specific risk factors were established.

Important Identified Risk: Haemorrhage
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
In clinical trial data from study BO42863 thrombocytopenia 
has been observed, and also severe bleeding events 
(although with very low frequency). A clear association has 
not yet been established. In a meta-analysis of small-
molecule VEGFR-TKIs, an increase in the risk of 
developing severe and fatal haemorrhagic events in solid 
cancer patients was observe. Further, gastrointestinal 
epithelial erosion and ulceration has been observed in 
animal studies and described as secondary to VEGFR 
inhibition.
No pralsetinib specific risk factors or risk groups were 
assessed. In general, patients with severe 
thrombocytopenia are in general at higher risk for 
experiencing haemorrhage, including severe 
haemorrhage. Risk of haemorrhage might be higher and 
more relevant in the older and frailer population, in whom 
even a grade 2 haemorrhage is of clinical importance. 
Furthermore, risk of haemorrhage might be increased by 
concurrent use of anti-coagulants.

Important Identified Risk: Transaminase Elevation
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
The clinical studies with pralsetinib showed mainly mild or 
moderate, asymptomatic and transient hepatic laboratory 
abnormalities without any clinical evidence of liver injury.
The risk is based on high incidence of increased 
AST/increased ALT events observed in the clinical 
development program for pralsetinib.
Risk factors and risk groups
The concomitant use of a hepatotoxic drug represents a 
known risk factor for development of hepatic laboratory 
abnormalities. No other specific risk factors of risk groups 
have been established for pralsetinib.
Risk-minimization measures Routine risk-minimization measures:
Additional

Important Potential Risk: Embryo-foetal Toxicity
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
The embryo-foetal toxicity associated with pralsetinib, and 
more specifically, the observed renal malformations in 
rodents, originate from its mechanism of action and are 
attributed to on-target inhibition of RET signalling.
Risk factors and risk groups
Female patients of child-bearing potential is the risk group.
Risk-minimization measures Routine risk-minimization measures:
Sections 4.4, 4.6, and 5.3 of the SmPC “Fertility and

Important Potential Risk: Severe Infections
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Risk factors and risk groups
Non-clinical studies provided information on the potential 
mechanism (haematological abnormalities). In clinical trial 
data from study BO42863 neutropenia has been observed, 
and also infection (including severe), however, a clear 
association has not yet been established. In a meta-
analysis of small-molecule VEGFR-TKIs, an increase in 
the risk of developing severe and fatal infectious events in 
solid cancer patients was observed.
Infections are the most common complications seen in 
cancer patients, and occur as a result of the underlying 
(advanced) malignancy and of the various modalities used 
for treatment. Factors that increase the risk of infection in 
patients with solid cancer in general include damage to 
normal anatomic barriers (skin and mucosal surfaces), 
obstructive phenomena, surgical procedures, prior 
chemotherapy, radiation, nutritional factors, and the 
increasing use of medical devices (catheters, stents, and 
shunts). No pralsetinib specific risk factors or risk groups 
were assessed.

Important Potential Risk: QT prolongation
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
Non clinical studies with pralsetinib did not provide 
evidence for a drug-event association. In the clinical 
setting, few QT prolongation events were seen in patients 
treated with pralsetinib. These were with no apparent 
clinical consequences. From a subset of data of this study 
(BO42863), in patients (n=34 patients) who received 
pralsetinib at repeated doses of 400 mg QD, an exposure-
effect regression analysis was performed. The analysis 
revealed that at the geometric Cmax of pralsetinib, as well 
as at the maximum observed concentration of pralsetinib, 
the ΔQTcF was <20 msec. However, as pralsetinib is a 
small molecule TKI, and many TKIs are associated with an 
increase in QTc interval, this risk is regarded as a potential 
risk for pralsetinib.
Risk factors and risk groups
No pralsetinib-specific risk factors were established.
Risk-minimization measures Routine risk-minimization measures:
 Recommendation to interrupt treatment in case of a 
Grade 3 event, is included in the SmPC section 4.2. 
QTc interval should be monitored until improvement of 
the event to 470 ms or baseline, then treatment can be 
resumed. 
Pralsetinib should be permanently discontinued in 
case of a Grade 4 occurrence.

 Recommendation to monitor QTc interval and 
electrolytes prior to initiating pralsetinib and at the end 
of the first week and of the first month of treatment, 
then periodically, as clinically indicated is included in 
the SmPC section 4.4

Missing Information: Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
In vitro, pralsetinib undergoes limited to moderate 
metabolism in liver microsomes and hepatocytes across 
species. The in vitro metabolism of [14C]-pralsetinib in 
mouse, rat, dog, monkey, and human hepatocytes and 
liver microsomes occurred via oxidation, defluorination, 
glucuronidation, and glutathione conjugation. Excretion of 
pralsetinib occurred mainly as the unchanged parent 
compound via the hepatobiliary route, with a minor role of 
active intestinal epithelial excretion.
As hepato-biliary elimination is a major route of excretion 
for pralsetinib, hepatic impairment may result in increased 
plasma concentrations of pralsetinib. In the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis, pralsetinib oral clearance was 
similar among 18 subjects with mild hepatic impairment, 
and 336 subjects with normal hepatic function. 
Additionally, no clear trends were identified for oral 
clearance by markers of hepatic function (ALT, AST, 
albumin, and bilirubin). No dose adjustment is 
recommended for patients with mild hepatic impairment. 
For patients with moderate or severe hepatic impairment, 
no dose has been established, therefore, pralsetinib use in 
these categories of patients it not recommended.
The pharmacokinetic and safety of pralsetinib in patients 
with moderate or severe hepatic impairment have not been 
studied. However, pralsetinib has a manageable toxicity 
profile, and the data from the clinical development program 
did not identify any trend that would pose as a risk in 
patients with moderate hepatic impairment.

Missing Information: Drug-drug Interactions
Evidence for linking the risk 
to the medicine
In vitro drug transporter studies suggest that pralsetinib is 
a P-gp substrate and, therefore there is a potential that co-
administration of a P-gp inhibitor could increase plasma 
concentrations of pralsetinib.

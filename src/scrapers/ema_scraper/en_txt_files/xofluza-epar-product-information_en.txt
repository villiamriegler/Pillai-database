Products that contain polyvalent cations may decrease plasma concentrations of baloxavir. Xofluza 
should not be taken with products that contain polyvalent cations such as laxatives, antacids or oral 
supplements containing iron, zinc, selenium, calcium or magnesium. 
Immune response to influenza virus 
Interaction studies with influenza vaccines and baloxavir marboxil have not been conducted. In studies 
of naturally acquired and experimental influenza, treatment with Xofluza did not impair the humoral 
antibody response to influenza infection. 
Paediatric population 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited data from the use of baloxavir marboxil in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Xofluza during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir are excreted in human milk. Baloxavir 
marboxil and its metabolites are secreted in the milk of lactating rats. 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from Xofluza therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No effects on male or female fertility were observed in animal studies performed with baloxavir 
marboxil (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Xofluza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the postmarketing setting which include reports of 
anaphylaxis/anaphylactic reactions and less severe forms of hypersensitivity reactions including 
urticaria and angioedema. Of these adverse reactions only urticaria has been observed in clinical 
studies with an estimated frequency category of “uncommon”. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following adverse drug reactions have been identified from postmarketing experience with 
baloxavir marboxil (Table 2) based on spontaneous case reports and cases from non-interventional

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reports of overdoses with baloxavir marboxil have been received from clinical trials and during 
postmarketing experience. In the majority of cases reporting overdose, no adverse reactions were 
reported. Data are insufficient to determine what symptoms may be anticipated as a result of an 
overdose. 
Management 
No known specific antidote exists for Xofluza. In the event of overdose, standard supportive medical 
care should be initiated based on the patient’s signs and symptoms. 
Baloxavir is unlikely to be significantly removed by dialysis due to high serum protein binding.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, other anti-virals. ATC code: J05AX25. 
Mechanism of action 
Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is converted by hydrolysis to baloxavir, the active form that 
exerts anti-influenza activity. Baloxavir acts on the cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN), an influenza 
virus-specific enzyme in the polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the viral RNA polymerase complex 
and thereby inhibits the transcription of influenza virus genomes resulting in inhibition of influenza 
virus replication. 
In vitro activity 
The 50 % inhibition concentration (IC50) of baloxavir was 1.4 to 3.1 nmol/L for influenza A viruses 
and 4.5 to 8.9 nmol/L for influenza B viruses in an enzyme inhibition assay. 
In a MDCK cell culture assay, the median 50 % effective concentration (EC50) values of baloxavir 
were 0.73 nmol/L (n=31; range: 0.20-1.85 nmol/L) for subtype A/H1N1 strains, 0.83 nmol/L (n=33; 
range: 0.35-2.63 nmol/L) for subtype A/H3N2 strains, and 5.97 nmol/L (n=30; range: 
2.67-14.23 nmol/L) for type B strains. 
In a MDCK cell-based virus titre reduction assay, the 90 % effective concentration (EC90) values of 
baloxavir were in the range of 0.46 to 0.98 nmol/L for subtype A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses, 0.80 to 
3.16 nmol/L for avian subtype A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 viruses, and 2.21 to 6.48 nmol/L for type B 
viruses. 
Resistance 
Viruses bearing the PA/I38T/F/M/N/S mutation selected in vitro or in clinical studies show reduced 
susceptibility to baloxavir with changes in EC50 values ranging from 11 to 57-fold for influenza A 
viruses and 2 to 8-fold for influenza B viruses.  
In the three phase 3 studies of treatment of uncomplicated influenza (see below) no resistance to 
baloxavir was detected in baseline isolates. In the two adult and adolescent studies, treatment-
emergent mutations PA/I38T/M/N were detected in 36/370 (9.7 %) and in 15/290 (5.2 %) patients 
treated with baloxavir marboxil but were not detected in any patients treated with placebo.  
In the phase 3 study in paediatric patients, treatment-emergent mutations, PA/I38T/M/S were found in 
11 of 57 (19.3 %) influenza-infected subjects in the baloxavir marboxil treatment group. 
In the phase 3 study of post-exposure prophylaxis (see below), PA/I38T/M were found in 10 of 374 
(2.7 %) baloxavir marboxil-treated subjects. PA/I38 substitutions were not detected in placebo-treated 
subjects, with the exception of 2 subjects who received baloxavir marboxil as rescue medication. 
Baloxavir is active in vitro against influenza viruses that are considered resistant to neuraminidase 
inhibitors, including strains with the following mutations: H274Y in A/H1N1, E119V and R292K in 
A/H3N2, R152K and D198E in type B virus, H274Y in A/H5N1, R292K in A/H7N9.

Capstone 1 (1601T0831), was a phase 3 randomised, double-blind, multicentre study conducted in 
Japan and the US to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral tablet dose of baloxavir marboxil 
compared with placebo and with oseltamivir in healthy adult and adolescent patients (aged ≥ 12 years 
to ≤ 64 years) with uncomplicated influenza. Patients were randomised to receive baloxavir marboxil 
(patients who weighed 40 to < 80 kg received 40 mg and patients who weighed ≥ 80 kg received 
80 mg), oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days (only if aged ≥ 20 years) or placebo. Dosing 
occurred within 48 hours of first onset of symptoms. 
A total of 1436 patients (of which 118 were aged ≥ 12 years to ≤ 17 years) were enrolled in the 2016-
2017 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The predominant influenza virus strain in this study was 
the A/H3 subtype (84.8 % to 88.1 %) followed by the B type (8.3 % to 9.0 %) and the A/H1N1pdm 
subtype (0.5 % to 3.0 %).  The primary efficacy endpoint was time to alleviation of symptoms (cough, 
sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue) 
(TTAS). Baloxavir marboxil elicited a statistically significant reduction in TTAS when compared with 
placebo (Table 4).

*ITTI: The Intention-to-treat Infected population consisted of patients who received the study medicine with a confirmed diagnosis of influenza. 
Confirmation of influenza was based on the results of RT-PCR on Day 1. 
When the baloxavir marboxil group was compared to the oseltamivir group, there was no statistically 
significant difference in TTAS (53.5 h vs 53.8 h respectively). 
The median (95 % CI) TTAS was 49.3 (44.0, 53.1) and 82.1 (69.5, 92.9) hours for patients who were 
symptomatic for > 0 to ≤ 24 hours, and 66.2 (54.4, 74.7) and 79.4 (69.0, 91.1) hours for patients who 
were symptomatic for > 24 to ≤ 48 hours for baloxavir marboxil and placebo, respectively. 
The median time to resolution of fever in patients treated with baloxavir marboxil was 24.5 hours 
(95 % CI: 22.6, 26.6) compared with 42.0 hours (95 % CI: 37.4, 44.6) in those receiving placebo.  No 
difference was noted in duration of fever in the baloxavir marboxil group compared with the 
oseltamivir group. 
Capstone 2 (1602T0832) was a phase 3 randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of a single oral tablet dose of baloxavir marboxil compared with placebo and with 
oseltamivir in adult and adolescent patients (aged ≥ 12 years) with uncomplicated influenza who had 
at least one host factor predisposing to the development of complications. Patients were randomised to 
receive a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil (according to weight as in Capstone 1), oseltamivir 
75 mg twice daily for 5 days, or placebo. Dosing occurred within 48 hours of first onset of symptoms. 
Of the total 2184 patients 59 were aged ≥ 12 to ≤ 17 years, 446 were aged ≥ 65 to ≤ 74 years, 142 
were aged ≥ 75 to ≤ 84 years and 14 were aged ≥ 85 years. The predominant influenza viruses in this 
study were the A/H3 subtype (46.9 % to 48.8 %) and influenza B (38.3 % to 43.5 %). The primary 
efficacy endpoint was time to improvement of influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, 
nasal congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue) (TTIS). Baloxavir marboxil 
elicited a statistically significant reduction in TTIS when compared with placebo (Table 5).

When the baloxavir marboxil group was compared to the oseltamivir group, there was no statistically 
significant difference in TTIS (73.2 h vs 81.0 h respectively). 
The median (95 % CI) TTIS was 68.6 (62.4, 78.8) and 99.1 (79.1, 112.6) hours for patients who were 
symptomatic for > 0 to ≤ 24 hours and 79.4 (67.9, 96.3) and 106.7 (92.7, 125.4) hours for patients who 
were symptomatic for > 24 to ≤ 48 hours for baloxavir marboxil and placebo, respectively. 
For patients infected with type A/H3 virus, the median TTIS was shorter in the baloxavir marboxil 
group compared with the placebo group but not compared with the oseltamivir group (see Table 6). In 
the subgroup of patients infected with type B virus, the median TTIS was shorter in the baloxavir 
marboxil group compared with both the placebo and oseltamivir group (see Table 6).

The median time to resolution of fever was 30.8 hours (95 % CI: 28.2, 35.4) in the baloxavir marboxil 
group compared with 50.7 hours (95 % CI: 44.6, 58.8) in the placebo group.  No clear differences 
between the baloxavir marboxil group and the oseltamivir group were observed.  
The overall incidence of influenza-related complications (death, hospitalisation, sinusitis, otitis media, 
bronchitis, and/or pneumonia) was 2.8 % (11/388 patients) in the baloxavir marboxil group compared 
with 10.4 % (40/386 patients) in the placebo group.  The lower overall incidence of influenza-related 
complications in the baloxavir marboxil group compared with the placebo group was mainly driven by 
lower incidences of bronchitis (1.8 % vs. 6.0 %, respectively) and sinusitis (0.3 % vs. 2.1 %, 
respectively). 
Paediatric patients (aged 1  < 12 years) 
Ministone-2 (CP40563) was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled study, 
designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of granules for 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
oral suspension of baloxavir marboxil compared with oseltamivir in otherwise healthy paediatric 
patients (aged 1 to  < 12 years) with influenza-like symptoms. 
A total of 173 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single oral dose of baloxavir 
marboxil based on body weight (2 mg/kg for patients weighing < 20 kg or 40 mg for patients weighing 
≥ 20 kg) or oseltamivir (dose based on body weight) for 5 days. Patients could receive paracetamo as 
required. Patients with host factors predisposing to the development of complications (14 % (25/173)) 
were included in the study. The predominant influenza virus strain in this study was the A/H3 subtype. 
The primary objective was to compare the safety of a single dose of baloxavir marboxil with 5 days of 
oseltamivir administered twice daily. A secondary objective was to compare the efficacy of baloxavir 
marboxil with oseltamivir based on the efficacy endpoints including time to alleviation of influenza 
signs and symptoms (cough and nasal symptoms, time to return to normal health and activity and 
duration of fever). 
Time to alleviation of influenza signs and symptoms were comparable between the baloxavir marboxil 
group (median 138.1 hours [95 % CI: 116.6, 163.2]) and the oseltamivir group (median 150 hours 
[95 % CI: 115.0, 165.7]) see Table 7.

[95 % CI: 24.5, 45.7]) and the oseltamivir group (46.8 hours [95 % CI: 30.0, 53.5]). 
The overall incidence of influenza-related complications (death, hospitalisation, pneumonia, 
bronchitis, sinusitis, otitis media, encephalitis/encephalopathy, febrile seizures, myositis) was 
7.4 % (6/81 patients) in the baloxavir marboxil group and 7 % (3/43 patients) in the oseltamivir group. 
The incidence of otitis media was 3.7 % (3/81 patients) in the baloxavir marboxil group and 
4.7 % (2/43 patients) in the oseltamivir group. Sinusitis, pneumonia and bronchitis occurred in one 
patient each in the baloxavir marboxil group and febrile seizures occurred in one patient in the 
oseltamivir group. 
Post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza 
Study 1719T0834 was a Phase 3, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study conducted in 
749 subjects in Japan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral tablet dose or a single dose of 
granulesof baloxavir marboxil compared with placebo for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza. 
Subjects were household contacts of influenza-infected index patients. 
There were 607 subjects>12 years, and 142 subjects 1 to < 12 years who received either baloxavir 
marboxil dosed according to weight as in the treatment studies or placebo. The majority of 
subjects(73.0 %) were enrolled within 24 hours of symptom onset in the index patient group. The 
predominant influenza virus strains in the index patients were the A/H3 subtype (48.6 %) and the 
A/H1N1pdm subtype (47.5 %) followed by influenza B (0.7 %). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of household subjects who were infected with 
influenza virus and presented with fever and at least one respiratory symptom in the period from Day 
1 to Day 10.

available among household members of influenza-infected index patients. The mITT population was analysed as randomised 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Xofluza in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of influenza and 
prevention of influenza (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After oral administration, baloxavir marboxil is extensively converted to its active metabolite, baloxavir. 
The  plasma  concentration  of  baloxavir  marboxil  is  very  low  or  below  the  limit  of  quantitation 
(< 0.100 ng/mL). 
Following a single oral administration of 80 mg of baloxavir marboxil, the time to achieve peak 
plasma concentration (Tmax) is approximately 4 hours in the fasted state. The absolute bioavailability 
of baloxavir after oral dosing with baloxavir marboxil has not been established. 
Food effect 
A food-effect study involving administration of baloxavir marboxil to healthy volunteers under fasting 
conditions and with a meal (approximately 400 to 500 kcal including 150 kcal from fat) indicated that 
the Cmax and AUC of baloxavir were decreased by 48 % and 36 %, respectively, under fed conditions. 
Tmax was unchanged in the presence of food. In clinical studies there were no clinically relevant 
differences in efficacy when baloxavir was taken with versus without food. 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
In an in-vitro study, the binding of baloxavir to human serum proteins, primarily albumin, is 92.9 % to 
93.9 % . The apparent volume of distribution of baloxavir during the terminal elimination phase 
(Vz/F) following a single oral administration of baloxavir marboxil is approximately 1180 litres in 
Caucasian subjects and 647 litres in Japanese subjects.  
Biotransformation 
Baloxavir is primarily metabolised by UGT1A3 to form a glucuronide with a minor contribution from 
CYP3A4 to form a sulfoxide. 
Drug-drug interaction studies 
Based on in vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies, baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir 
are not expected to inhibit isozymes of the CYP or UGT families or cause relevant induction of CYP 
enzymes. 
Based on in vitro transporter studies and in vivo DDI studies, no relevant pharmacokinetic interaction 
is anticipated between baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir and medicines which are substrates of the 
following transporters: OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, or MATE2K. 
Excretion 
Following a single oral administration of 40 mg of [14C]-labeled baloxavir marboxil, the proportion of 
total radioactivity excreted in faeces was 80.1 % of the administered dose, with the urine accounting 
for 14.7 % (3.3 % and 48.7 % of the administered dose was excreted as baloxavir in urine and faeces 
respectively). 
Elimination 
The apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2,z) of baloxavir after a single oral administration of 
baloxavir marboxil is 79.1, 50.3 and 29.4 hours in Caucasian adult, adolescent and paediatric subjects, 
respectively. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Following single oral administration of baloxavir marboxil, baloxavir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics 
within the dose range of 6 mg to 80 mg. 
Special populations 
Body weight 
Body weight is a significant covariate for baloxavir pharmacokinetics based on the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. Dosing recommendations for baloxavir marboxil are based on body weight 
in both adult and paediatric patients (see section 4.2). 
Gender 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of gender on the 
pharmacokinetics of baloxavir. No dose adjustment based on gender is required. 
Race 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, race is a covariate on oral clearance (CL/F) of 
baloxavir in addition to body weight; however, no dose adjustment of baloxavir marboxil based on 
race is required. 
Age 
12 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis using plasma baloxavir concentrations from clinical studies in 
subjects aged 1 to 64 years did not identify age as a relevant covariate on the pharmacokinetics of 
baloxavir. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic data of baloxavir collected in patients aged 1 to < 12 years show that the body 
weight-adjusted dosing regimen (2 mg/kg up to 20 kg and 40 mg for ≥ 20 kg) provides similar 
baloxavir exposures across the body weight categories in the paediatric population, as well as similar 
exposure to adults and adolescent receiving a 40 mg dose of baloxavir marboxil. 
The pharmacokinetics of baloxavir in paediatric patients below 1 year of age have not been 
established. 
Elderly 
Pharmacokinetic data collected in 181 patients aged ≥ 65 years show that exposure to baloxavir in the 
plasma was similar to that in patients aged ≥ 12 to 64 years. 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir were observed in patients 
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and B) compared with healthy controls 
with normal hepatic function. 
The pharmacokinetics in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated (see 
section 4.2). 
Renal impairment 
The effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir have not 
been evaluated. Renal impairment is not expected to alter the elimination of baloxavir marboxil or 
baloxavir. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity.  
Prolongation of PT and APTT were observed in rats at exposures at least equal to the human exposure 
based on AUC0-24hr under specific experimental conditions, i.e. when fasted and when the food was 
either autoclaved or radiation-treated, resulting in vitamin K limiting/deficient conditions. These 
effects were not observed in monkey studies up to 4 weeks duration at the highest tested dose 
equivalent to 8-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr. They are considered to be of limited 
clinical relevance. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with baloxavir marboxil. 
The pro-drug baloxavir marboxil, and its active form, baloxavir, were not considered genotoxic as 
they tested negative in bacterial reverse mutation tests, micronucleus tests with cultured mammalian 
cells, and as baloxavir marboxil was negative in an in vivo rodent micronucleus test. 
Baloxavir marboxil had no effects on fertility when given orally to male and female rats at doses 
providing exposure equivalent to 5-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr. 
Baloxavir marboxil did not cause malformations in rats or rabbits. 
The oral embryo-foetal development study of baloxavir marboxil in rats with daily doses from 
gestation day 6 to 17 revealed no signs of maternal or foetal toxicity up to the highest tested dose 
providing exposure equivalent to 5-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In rabbits, a dose providing exposure equivalent to 14-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr 
following the MHRD caused maternal toxicity resulting in miscarriages and significant increase in 
incidence of foetuses with a skeletal variation (cervical rib). The skeletal variations were reabsorbed 
during the growing process of adjacent cervical vertebra. A dose providing exposure equivalent to 6-
times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr in rabbits was without adverse effects. 
The pre- and postnatal study in rats did not show drug-related adverse findings in dams and pups up to 
the highest tested dose providing exposure equivalent to 5-times the human exposure based on 
AUC0-24hr.

4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no or limited data from the use of baloxavir marboxil in pregnant women. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity 
(see section 5.3). 
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Xofluza during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir are excreted in human milk. Baloxavir 
marboxil and its metabolites are secreted in the milk of lactating rats. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A risk to the newborns/infants cannot be excluded.  
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from Xofluza therapy 
taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility 
No effects on male or female fertility were observed in animal studies performed with baloxavir 
marboxil (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Xofluza has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypersensitivity reactions have been observed in the postmarketing setting which include reports of 
anaphylaxis/anaphylactic reactions and less severe forms of hypersensitivity reactions including 
urticaria and angioedema. Of these adverse reactions only urticaria has been observed in clinical 
studies with an estimated frequency category of “uncommon”. 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The  following  adverse  drug  reactions  have  been  identified  from  postmarketing  experience  with 
baloxavir marboxil (Table 2) based on spontaneous case reports and cases from non-interventional study 
programmes. Adverse drug reactions are listed according to system organ classes in MedDRA and the 
corresponding frequency category estimation for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following 
convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1 000 to <1/100); rare 
(≥1/10 000 to <1/1 000); very rare (<1/10 000) and not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data).

Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Reports of overdoses with baloxavir marboxil have been received from clinical trials and during 
postmarketing experience. In the majority of cases reporting overdose, no adverse reactions were 
reported. Data are insufficient to determine what symptoms may be anticipated as a result of an 
overdose. 
Management 
No known specific antidote exists for Xofluza. In the event of overdose, standard supportive medical 
care should be initiated based on the patient’s signs and symptoms. 
Baloxavir is unlikely to be significantly removed by dialysis due to high serum protein binding.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antivirals for systemic use, other anti-virals. ATC code: J05AX25. 
Mechanism of action 
Baloxavir marboxil is a prodrug that is converted by hydrolysis to baloxavir, the active form that 
exerts anti-influenza activity. Baloxavir acts on the cap-dependent endonuclease (CEN), an influenza 
virus-specific enzyme in the polymerase acidic (PA) subunit of the viral RNA polymerase complex 
and thereby inhibits the transcription of influenza virus genomes resulting in inhibition of influenza 
virus replication. 
In vitro activity 
The 50 % inhibition concentration (IC50) of baloxavir was 1.4 to 3.1 nmol/L for influenza A viruses 
and 4.5 to 8.9 nmol/L for influenza B viruses in an enzyme inhibition assay. 
In a MDCK cell culture assay, the median 50 % effective concentration (EC50) values of baloxavir 
were 0.73 nmol/L (n=31; range: 0.20-1.85 nmol/L) for subtype A/H1N1 strains, 0.83 nmol/L  
(n=33; range: 0.35-2.63 nmol/L) for subtype A/H3N2 strains, and 5.97 nmol/L (n=30; range: 
2.67-14.23 nmol/L) for type B strains. 
In a MDCK cell-based virus titre reduction assay, the 90 % effective concentration (EC90) values of 
baloxavir were in the range of 0.46 to 0.98 nmol/L for subtype A/H1N1 and A/H3N2 viruses, 0.80 to 
3.16 nmol/L for avian subtype A/H5N1 and A/H7N9 viruses, and 2.21 to 6.48 nmol/L for type B 
viruses. 
Resistance 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Viruses bearing the PA/I38T/F/M/N/S mutation selected in vitro or in clinical studies show reduced 
susceptibility to baloxavir with changes in EC50 values ranging from 11 to 57-fold for influenza A 
viruses and 2 to 8-fold for influenza B viruses.  
In the three p hase 3 studies of treatment of uncomplicated influenza (see below) no resistance to 
baloxavir was detected in baseline isolates. In the two adult and adolescent studies, t reatment -
emergent mutations PA/I38T/M/N were detected in 36/370 (9.7 %) and in 15/290 (5.2 %) patients 
treated with baloxavir marboxil but were not detected in any patients treated with placebo. In the p 
hase 3 study in paediatric patients, treatment-emergent mutations PA/I38T/M/S were found in 11 of 57 
(19.3 %) influenza-infected subjects in the baloxavir marboxil treatment group. In the phase 3 study of 
post-exposure prophylaxis (see below), PA/I38T/M were found in 10 of 374 (2.7 %) baloxavir 
marboxil-treated subjects.  PA/I38 substitutions were not detected in placebo-treated subjects, with the 
exception of 2 subjects who received baloxavir marboxil as rescue medication. 
Baloxavir is active in vitro against influenza viruses that are considered resistant to neuraminidase 
inhibitors, including strains with the following mutations: H274Y in A/H1N1, E119V and R292K in 
A/H3N2, R152K and D198E in type B virus, H274Y in A/H5N1, R292K in A/H7N9. 
Clinical trials 
Treatment of uncomplicated influenza 
Adult and adolescent patients 
Capstone 1 (1601T0831), was a p hase 3 randomised, double-blind, multicentre study conducted in 
Japan and the US to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral tablet dose of baloxavir marboxil 
compared with placebo and with oseltamivir in healthy adult and adolescent patients (aged ≥ 12 years 
to ≤ 64 years) with uncomplicated influenza. Patients were randomised to receive baloxavir marboxil 
(patients who weighed 40 to < 80 kg received 40 mg and patients who weighed ≥ 80 kg received 
80 mg), oseltamivir 75 mg twice daily for 5 days (only if aged ≥ 20 years) or placebo. Dosing 
occurred within 48 hours of first onset of symptoms. 
A total of 1436 patients (of which 118 were aged ≥ 12 years to ≤ 17 years) were enrolled in the 2016-
2017 Northern Hemisphere influenza season. The predominant influenza virus strain in this study was 
the A/H3 subtype (84.8 % to 88.1 %) followed by the B type (8.3 % to 9.0 %) and the A/H1N1pdm 
subtype (0.5 % to 3.0 %). The primary efficacy endpoint was time to alleviation of symptoms (cough, 
sore throat, headache, nasal congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue) 
(TTAS). Baloxavir marboxil elicited a statistically significant reduction in TTAS when compared with 
placebo (Table 4).

*ITTI: The Intention-to-treat Infected population consisted of patients who received the study medicine with a confirmed diagnosis of influenza. 
Confirmation of influenza was based on the results of RT-PCR on Day 1. 
When the baloxavir marboxil group was compared to the oseltamivir group, there was no statistically 
significant difference in TTAS (53.5 h vs 53.8 h respectively).

The median (95 % CI) TTAS was 49.3 (44.0, 53.1) and 82.1 (69.5, 92.9) hours for patients who were 
symptomatic for > 0 to ≤ 24 hours, and 66.2 (54.4, 74.7) and 79.4 (69.0, 91.1) hours for patients who 
were symptomatic for > 24 to ≤ 48 hours for baloxavir marboxil and placebo, respectively. 
The median time to resolution of fever in patients treated with baloxavir marboxil was 24.5 hours 
(95 % CI: 22.6, 26.6) compared with 42.0 hours (95 % CI: 37.4, 44.6) in those receiving placebo. No 
difference was noted in duration of fever in the baloxavir marboxil group compared with the 
oseltamivir group. 
Capstone 2 (1602T0832) was a p hase 3 randomised, double-blind, multicentre study to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of a single oral tablet dose of baloxavir marboxil compared with placebo and with 
oseltamivir in adult and adolescent patients (aged ≥ 12 years) with uncomplicated influenza who had 
at least one host factor predisposing to the development of complications. Patients were randomised to 
receive a single oral dose of baloxavir marboxil (according to weight as in Capstone 1), oseltamivir 
75 mg twice daily for 5 days, or placebo. Dosing occurred within 48 hours of first onset of symptoms. 
Of the total 2184 patients 59 were aged ≥ 12 to ≤ 17 years, 446 were aged ≥ 65 to ≤ 74 years, 142 
were aged ≥ 75 to ≤ 84 years and 14 were aged ≥ 85 years. The predominant influenza viruses in this 
study were the A/H3 subtype (46.9 % to 48.8 %) and influenza B (38.3 % to 43.5 %). The primary 
efficacy endpoint was time to improvement of influenza symptoms (cough, sore throat, headache, 
nasal congestion, feverishness or chills, muscle or joint pain, and fatigue) (TTIS). Baloxavir marboxil 
elicited a statistically significant reduction in TTIS when compared with placebo (Table 5).

When the baloxavir marboxil group was compared to the oseltamivir group, there was no statistically 
significant difference in TTIS (73.2 h vs 81.0 h respectively). 
The median (95 % CI) TTIS was 68.6 (62.4, 78.8) and 99.1 (79.1, 112.6) hours for patients who were 
symptomatic for > 0 to ≤ 24 hours and 79.4 (67.9, 96.3) and 106.7 (92.7, 125.4) hours for patients who 
were symptomatic for > 24 to ≤ 48 hours for baloxavir marboxil and placebo, respectively. 
For patients infected with type A/H3 virus, the median TTIS was shorter in the baloxavir marboxil 
group compared with the placebo group but not compared with the oseltamivir group (see Table 6). In 
the subgroup of patients infected with type B virus, the median TTIS was shorter in the baloxavir 
marboxil group compared with both the placebo and oseltamivir group (see Table 6).

The median time to resolution of fever was 30.8 hours (95 % CI: 28.2, 35.4) in the baloxavir marboxil 
group compared with 50.7 hours (95 % CI: 44.6, 58.8) in the placebo group.  No clear differences 
between the baloxavir marboxil group and the oseltamivir group were observed.  
The overall incidence of influenza-related complications (death, hospitalisation, sinusitis, otitis media, 
bronchitis, and/or pneumonia) was 2.8 % (11/388 patients) in the baloxavir marboxil group compared 
with 10.4 % (40/386 patients) in the placebo group.  The lower overall incidence of influenza-related 
complications in the baloxavir marboxil group compared with the placebo group was mainly driven by 
lower incidences of bronchitis (1.8 % vs. 6.0 %, respectively) and sinusitis (0.3 % vs. 2.1 %, 
respectively). 
Paediatric patients (aged 1 - < 12 years) 
Ministone-2 (CP40563) was a randomised, double-blind, multicentre, active-controlled study, 
designed to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of a single oral dose of granules for 
oral suspension of baloxavir marboxil compared with oseltamivir in otherwise healthy paediatric 
patients (aged 1 to < 12 years) with influenza-like symptoms. 
A total of 173 patients were randomised in a 2:1 ratio to receive a single oral dose of baloxavir 
marboxil based on body weight (2 mg/kg for patients weighing < 20 kg or 40 mg for patients weighing 
≥ 20 kg) or oseltamivir (dose based on body weight) for 5 days. Patients could receive paracetamol as 
required. Patients with host factors predisposing to the development of complications ((14 % (25/173)) 
were included in the study. The predominant influenza virus strain in this study was the A/H3 subtype. 
The primary objective was to compare the safety of a single dose of baloxavir marboxil with 5 days of 
oseltamivir administered twice daily. A secondary objective was to compare the efficacy of baloxavir 
marboxil with oseltamivir based on the efficacy endpoints including time to alleviation of influenza 
signs and symptoms (cough and nasal symptoms, time to return to normal health and activity and 
duration of fever). 
Time to alleviation of influenza signs and symptoms were comparable between the baloxavir marboxil 
group (median 138.1 hours [95 % CI: 116.6, 163.2]) and the oseltamivir group (median 
150 hours [95 % CI: 115.0, 165.7]) see Table 7.

The median duration of fever was comparable between the baloxavir marboxil group (41.2 hours 
[95 % CI: 24.5, 45.7]) and the oseltamivir group (46.8 hours [95 % CI: 30.0, 53.5]).The overall 
incidence of influenza-related complications (death, hospitalisation, pneumonia, bronchitis, sinusitis, 
otitis media, encephalitis/encephalopathy, febrile seizures, myositis) was 7.4 % (6/81 patients) in the 
baloxavir marboxil group and 7 % (3/43 patients) in the oseltamivir group. The incidence of otitis 
media was 3.7 % (3/81 patients) in the baloxavir marboxil group and 4.7 % (2/43 patients) in the 
oseltamivir group. Sinusitis, pneumonia and bronchitis occurred in one patient each in the baloxavir 
marboxil group and febrile seizures occurred in one patient in the oseltamivir group.   
Post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza 
Study 1719T0834 was a p hase 3, randomised, double-blind, multicentre study conducted in 
749 subjects in Japan to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a single oral tablet dose or a single dose of 
granules of baloxavir marboxil compared with placebo for post-exposure prophylaxis of influenza. 
Subjects were household contacts of influenza-infected index patients. 
There were 607 subjects >12 years and 142 subjects 1 to < 12 years who received either baloxavir 
marboxil dosed according to weight, as in the treatment studies, or placebo. The majority of subjects 
(73.0 %) were enrolled within 24 hours of symptom onset in the index patient group. The predominant 
influenza virus strains in the index patients were the A/H3 subtype (48.6 %) and the A/H1N1pdm 
subtype (47.5 %) followed by influenza B (0.7 %). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of household subjects who were infected with 
influenza virus and presented with fever and at least one respiratory symptom in the period from Day 
1 to Day 10. 
There was a statistically significant reduction in the proportion of subjects with laboratory-confirmed 
clinical influenza from 13.6 % in the placebo group to 1.9 % in the baloxavir marboxil group (see 
Table 8).

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
Xofluza  
in one or more subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of influenza and prevention of 
influenza (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
After oral administration, baloxavir marboxil is extensively converted to its active metabolite, baloxavir. 
The  plasma  concentration  of  baloxavir  marboxil  is  very  low  or  below  the  limit  of  quantitation 
(< 0.100 ng/mL). 
Following a single oral administration of 80 mg of baloxavir marboxil, the time to achieve peak 
plasma concentration (Tmax) is approximately 4 hours in the fasted state. The absolute bioavailability 
of baloxavir after oral dosing with baloxavir marboxil has not been established. 
Food effect 
A food-effect study involving administration of baloxavir marboxil to healthy volunteers under fasting 
conditions and with a meal (approximately 400 to 500 kcal including 150 kcal from fat) indicated that 
the Cmax and AUC of baloxavir were decreased by 48 % and 36 %, respectively, under fed conditions. 
Tmax was unchanged in the presence of food. In clinical studies there were no clinically relevant 
differences in efficacy when baloxavir was taken with versus without food. 
Distribution 
In an in-vitro study, the binding of baloxavir to human serum proteins, primarily albumin, is 92.9 % to 
93.9 %. The apparent volume of distribution of baloxavir during the terminal elimination phase (Vz/F) 
following a single oral administration of baloxavir marboxil is approximately 1180 litres in Caucasian 
subjects and 647 litres in Japanese subjects.  
Biotransformation 
Baloxavir is primarily metabolised by UGT1A3 to form a glucuronide with a minor contribution from 
CYP3A4 to form a sulfoxide. 
Drug-drug interaction studies 
Based on in vitro and in vivo drug-drug interaction (DDI) studies, baloxavir marboxil and baloxavir 
are not expected to inhibit isozymes of the CYP or UGT families or cause relevant induction of CYP 
enzymes. 
Based on in vitro transporter studies and in vivo DDI studies, no relevant pharmacokinetic interaction 
is anticipated between baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir and medicines which are substrates of the 
following transporters: OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1, OCT2, OAT1, OAT3, MATE1, or MATE2K. 
Excretion 
Following a single oral administration of 40 mg of [14C]-labeled baloxavir marboxil, the proportion of 
total radioactivity excreted in faeces was 80.1 % of the administered dose, with the urine accounting 
for 14.7 % (3.3 % and 48.7 % of the administered dose was excreted as baloxavir in urine and faeces 
respectively). 
Elimination 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2,z) of baloxavir after a single oral administration of 
baloxavir marboxil is 79.1, 50.3 and 29.4  hours in Caucasian adults, adolescent and paediatric 
subjects, respectively. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Following single oral administration of baloxavir marboxil, baloxavir exhibits linear pharmacokinetics 
within the dose range of 6 mg to 80 mg. 
Special populations 
Body weight 
Body weight is a significant covariate for baloxavir pharmacokinetics based on the population 
pharmacokinetic analysis. Dosing recommendations for baloxavir marboxil are based on body weight 
in both adult and paediatric patients (see section 4.2). 
Gender 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis did not identify a clinically meaningful effect of gender on the 
pharmacokinetics of baloxavir. No dose adjustment based on gender is required. 
Race 
Based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis, race is a covariate on oral clearance (CL/F) of 
baloxavir in addition to body weight; however, no dose adjustment of baloxavir marboxil based on 
race is required. 
Age 
A population pharmacokinetic analysis using plasma baloxavir concentrations from clinical studies in 
subjects aged 1 to 64 years did not identify age as a relevant covariate on the pharmacokinetics of 
baloxavir. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetic data of baloxavir collected in patients aged 1 to < 12 years show that the body 
weight-adjusted dosing regimen (2 mg/kg up to 20 kg and 40 mg for ≥ 20 kg) provides similar 
baloxavir exposures across the body weight categories in the paediatric population, as well as similar 
exposure to adults and adolescents receiving a 40 mg dose of baloxavir marboxil.  
The pharmacokinetics of baloxavir in paediatric patients below 1 year of age have not been 
established. 
Elderly 
Pharmacokinetic data collected in 181 patients aged ≥ 65 years show that exposure to baloxavir in the 
plasma was similar to that in patients aged ≥ 12 to 64 years. 
Hepatic impairment 
No clinically meaningful differences in the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir were observed in patients 
with mild or moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh class A and B) compared with healthy controls 
with normal hepatic function. 
The pharmacokinetics in patients with severe hepatic impairment have not been evaluated (see section 
4.2). 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
The effects of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics of baloxavir marboxil or baloxavir have not 
been evaluated. Renal impairment is not expected to alter the elimination of baloxavir marboxil or 
baloxavir. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Nonclinical data reveal no special hazards for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, acute and repeated dose toxicity.  
Prolongation of PT and APTT were observed in rats at exposures at least equal to the human exposure 
based on AUC0-24hr under specific experimental conditions, i.e. when fasted and when the food was 
either autoclaved or radiation-treated, resulting in vitamin K limiting/deficient conditions. These 
effects were not observed in monkey studies up to 4 weeks duration at the highest tested dose 
equivalent to 8-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr. They are considered to be of limited 
clinical relevance. 
Carcinogenicity studies have not been performed with baloxavir marboxil. 
The pro-drug baloxavir marboxil, and its active form, baloxavir, were not considered genotoxic as 
they tested negative in bacterial reverse mutation tests, micronucleus tests with cultured mammalian 
cells, and as baloxavir marboxil was negative in an in vivo rodent micronucleus test. 
Baloxavir marboxil had no effects on fertility when given orally to male and female rats at doses 
providing exposure equivalent to 5-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr. 
Baloxavir marboxil did not cause malformations in rats or rabbits. 
The oral embryo-foetal development study of baloxavir marboxil in rats with daily doses from 
gestation day 6 to 17 revealed no signs of maternal or foetal toxicity up to the highest tested dose 
providing exposure equivalent to 5-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr. 
In rabbits, a dose providing exposure equivalent to 14-times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr 
following the MHRD caused maternal toxicity resulting in miscarriages and significant increase in 
incidence of foetuses with a skeletal variation (cervical rib). The skeletal variations were reabsorbed 
during the growing process of adjacent cervical vertebra. A dose providing exposure equivalent to 6-
times the human exposure based on AUC0-24hr in rabbits was without adverse effects. 
The pre- and postnatal study in rats did not show drug-related adverse findings in dams and pups up to 
the highest tested dose providing exposure equivalent to 5-times the human exposure based on 
AUC0-24hr.

bottle adapter, slowly pull back the plunger to 
withdraw the required amount of suspension – 
until the top of the plunger lines up with the 
required syringe graduation mark. 
Remove the syringe 
24.  Hold the plunger in place (it may move otherwise) and turn the bottle and syringe upright on the 
table. 
25.  Remove the oral syringe from the bottle 
adapter. 
Check the volume in the syringe 
26.   With the tip of the syringe pointing up, check 
that:

Note: If you have not withdrawn the correct volume, or if there are large bubbles inside, put the 
syringe into the bottle adapter again, push the medicine back into the bottle and then withdraw the 
medicine again (start at Step 22). 
× Do not overfill the syringes beyond the graduation scale. Give several doses using one syringe twice 
or two syringes.  
STAGE 4: GIVING THE DOSE 
Do not give Xofluza directly into the throat or too fast, as this may cause choking. 
27.  Sit upright to avoid choking on the suspension. 
28.  Place the oral syringe into the mouth with the 
tip along either cheek. 
29.  Slowly push the plunger all the way down. Make sure the medicine is swallowed. 
 Note: When the full dose requires multiple withdrawals, start again at Step 20.

and return it to your pharmacy or to a local 
collection location. 
Dispose of oral syringe(s) in household waste.  
32.  Wash your hands.

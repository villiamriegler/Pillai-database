1.  Introduction 
On November, 10th, 2020, the  MAH submitted  a completed paediatric study (MDCO-CAN-15-01)  for 
KENGREXAL 50 mg Powder for concentrate for solution for injection / infusion, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006,  as amended. 
Kengrexal, co-administered with  acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the reduction of thrombotic 
cardiovascular events in adult patients  with coronary artery disease undergoing percutaneous 
coronary intervention (PCI) who have not  received an oral P2Y12 inhibitor prior to the PCI procedure 
and in whom oral therapy with  P2Y12 inhibitors is not feasible or desirable. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that  study MDCO-CAN-15-01,  is a stand-alone study.  
The paediatric study is not part of an approved Paediatric Investigation Plan, and it  is not performed in 
the approved indication, therefore the  line listing is not included. The results of this study do not fall in 
the authorised indication in any subset of the population.  
The Applicant is planning to submit  a PIP modification request in order to update the  PIP plan. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Cangrelor drug product is supplied in 10 mL vials, each containing 50  mg of cangrelor as the 
tetrasodium salt, plus mannitol,  sorbitol and sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment) as excipients. The 
current drug product formulation is considered adequate for use in the neonatal age group.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Kengrexal contains the active substance cangrelor, a platelet aggregation inhibitor.  It is indicated for 
the reduction of thrombotic cardiovascular events in adult patients  with coronary artery disease 
undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention.   
The MAH submitted  a final report for: 
• 
Study MDCO-CAN-15-01,  A prospective, open-label, single-arm, multi-center  study to assess 
the pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (pk/pd) and safety of different cangrelor doses in neonatal 
subjects at risk of thrombosis. 
No paediatric indication was included in the initial  approval of Kengrexal, but  an approved Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (PIP) is in place (EMEA-001348-PIP01-12).  It was agreed upon, to study Kengrexal 
for the prevention of thrombotic events in paediatric patients  undergoing diagnostic and/or therapeutic 
percutaneous interventional procedures in two non-clinical studies (measure 1  and 2)  and one clinical 
study in the paediatric population undergoing percutaneous intravascular procedures for management 
of congenital heart disease (measure 3).  PK/PD study (Protocol MDCO-CAN-15-01),  is comparable to 
the proposed Measure 3 with the  exception of focusing on a different paediatric population  (only 
neonatal population). 
EMA/105362/2022  
Page 3/35 
 
  
 
 
 
Initially, the Applicant did not  consider it necessary to update section 5.1 of the SmPC, since the 
information is not sufficiently conclusive to be considered relevant to prescribers. 
During the procedure, the Applicant agreed that  considering this  Phase 1 study provides the first, 
although preliminary, PK/PD and safety data on two dosages of cangrelor in a specific neonatal 
population, providing information on this study in the  labelling is clinically relevant. Consequently, 
section 4.2, 5.1  and 5.2  have been updated. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study MDCO-CAN-15-01 
Study Title:   
A prospective, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre study to assess the pharmacokinetics/ 
pharmacodynamics (pk/pd) and safety of different cangrelor doses in neonatal subjects at risk of 
thrombosis 
Objective(s) 
Primary objectives: 
The primary objectives of this  Phase I study were: 
•  To determine the plasma concentrations of cangrelor and its primary metabolite, AR-C69712, 
during administration and after cessation of the infusion in  neonates; 
•  To determine the pharmacodynamics (PD) of cangrelor at various doses in  neonates as 
assessed by light  transmittance aggregometry (LTA); 
•  To assess recovery of platelet function  in neonates by LTA after cessation of the infusion; 
•  To determine the appropriate dose(s) to evaluate in  future safety and efficacy trials in 
neonates; 
•  To evaluate the safety of cangrelor in neonatal subjects by evaluating adverse events (AEs) 
and serious AEs (SAEs). 
Exploratory objective: 
•  To determine the PD of cangrelor and recovery of platelet function  after cessation of the 
cangrelor infusion at various doses in  neonates as assessed by microfluidic flow chamber. 
Study design 
This study was a Phase I prospective, open-label, single-arm, multi-centre  trial in neonatal subjects at 
risk of thrombosis to assess the PK/PD and safety of cangrelor as a platelet inhibitor  to prevent 
(nonsite- specific) thrombotic and thromboembolic events. 
The maximum duration of study participation was approximately 10 days for each subject and 
consisted of up  to 5 visits and 3 periods: 
• 
• 
Pre-treatment Period: informed consent and screening from Day -7 to Day -1;  study 
assessments on Day -1 (24 ±2  hours prior to study surgery); 
Treatment Period: study surgery, cangrelor infusion, and study assessments on Day 1. The 
study surgery occurred on Day 1 before the cangrelor infusion. The cangrelor infusion period 
was the treatment period; 
EMA/105362/2022  
Page 4/35 
 
  
 
 
• 
Follow-up  Period: study assessments on Day 2 (24 ±6  hours after completion of the cangrelor 
infusion) and Day 3 (48  ±6 hours after completion of the cangrelor infusion). 
Eligible subjects were enrolled and dosed in the following Cohorts, listed in order of enrollment: 
•  Cohort 1: a minimum of 5 subjects were enrolled and dosed at 0.5  μg/kg/min of cangrelor; 
•  Cohort 2: a minimum of 5 subjects were enrolled and dosed at 0.25  μg/kg/min of cangrelor; 
•  Cohort 2 expansion (Cohort 2-E): Cohort 2 was expanded to enrol and dose a minimum of 2 
additional subjects; and with  Sponsor approval, a maximum of 5  subjects, at a dose of 0.25 
μg/kg/min of cangrelor; 
•  Cohort 1 expansion (Cohort 1-E): Cohort 1 was expanded to enrol and dose a minimum of 2 
additional subjects; and with  Sponsor approval, a maximum of 5  subjects, at a dose of 0.5 
μg/kg/min of cangrelor. 
Cohort allocation was based on completion of Cohort enrollment. Enrollment proceeded without 
interruption until  the  subjects in each Cohort had been dosed, and all PK and PD samples had been 
obtained and safety review performed. 
An independent Data Monitoring  Committee (DMC) was convened for this  study to review safety data 
following completion of each initial  Cohort. A recommendation was to be provided by the DMC to the 
Sponsor to either continue the  study without  modification, to modify the  study, or to  discontinue the 
study following review of safety data from each Cohort. The DMC was not charged with  a review of 
data from the  Cohort 1  or Cohort 2 expansions. 
Study population /Sample size 
This study included male or female subjects ranging in age from birth to 28  days with congenital heart 
disease (CHD), specifically, postoperative neonatal cardiac subjects who are undergoing surgery for 
placement of systemic-to-pulmonary artery palliative shunts  (e.g., Blalock-Taussig or central shunt), 
right ventricle to pulmonary artery palliative shunts,  or ductus  arteriosus stents who are at  risk of 
thrombotic events after repair for structural congenital heart disease. 
Treatments 
Diluted cangrelor was administered intravenously (IV) as a single-dose continuous infusion for 
approximately 1 hour via a peripheral IV or central venous line. 
•  Cohort 1 (and 1-E): 0.5  μg/kg/min of cangrelor; 
•  Cohort 2 (and 2-E): 0.25  μg/kg/min of cangrelor; 
Infusion of cangrelor was started approximately 6 to 10 hours after the surgery (or whenever the 
Investigator determined it was safe to  proceed). 
For each subject, the  maximum duration of involvement in the study  was approximately 10 days from 
screening through  the 48-hour post-infusion (Day 3) follow-up visit.  
Concomitant therapy (permitted and non-permitted) 
The following medications/treatments were permitted during the  study: 
• Aspirin (given 12  to 24 hours post-operatively as standard of care); 
• Heparin (unfractionated or low molecular weight). 
EMA/105362/2022  
Page 5/35 
 
  
 
 
 
The following medications/treatments were not  permitted during the study: 
• Oral anticoagulants (e.g., warfarin, dabigatran, etc.); 
• P2Y12 inhibitors. 
PK and PD sampling 
Blood samples for PD and PK assessments were collected simultaneously using the  smallest amount  of 
blood possible (maximum of 3 mL/kg in  24 hours), and in accordance with guidelines established by 
the IRB. PD and PK samples were collected according to the sample schedules presented in Table 1.

 1 For the expansion Cohorts, the MF assessment may have been performed at 30 minutes after the cangrelor infusion was 
completed, if blood sample volume was adequate. 
Methods 
Pharmacokinetic variables: 
Initially, no information has been provided on the bioanalytical method that has been used to analyse 
the PK samples. Upon request, the company clarified that  cangrelor and AR-C69712XX concentrations 
were determined by means of a Liquid  chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) 
analytical method and the  bioanalytical report and method validation report were provided. (see 
responses Question 2). The following PK parameters were planned to be presented: maximum 
observed concentration (Cmax), time to peak concentration (tmax), observed terminal elimination  rate 
constant (λZ); observed terminal half-life (t1/2), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 
the start of dosing (zero) until  the time  of the  last measurable concentration (AUC0-t), AUC from the 
start of dosing (zero) until  the end of the dosing interval (AUCtau), AUC from time-zero extrapolated to 
infinity  (AUCinf), the percentage of AUCinf based on extrapolation (AUCextrap), average concentration 
over a dosing interval (Cav), average concentration at  steady-state during the  infusion (Css), clearance 
(CL), volume of distribution  (Vz), dose-normalised Cmax (Cmax/Dose), dose-normalised AUCinf 
(AUCinf/Dose).  
Pharmacodynamic variables: 
Inhibition  of platelet aggregation and recovery of platelet function after cessation of the cangrelor 
infusion were evaluated. Platelet aggregation was measured by LTA (primary) and microfluidic flow 
chamber (exploratory) at baseline (15  to 60 minutes before the  start of the cangrelor infusion), at 15 
minutes before completing the cangrelor infusion,  and at  60 minutes after completing the cangrelor 
infusion. The 3 assessments for the  microfluidics (MF)  were performed if sample volume allowed. In 
addition, a fourth MF  assessment may have been performed at 30 minutes  after completing the 
EMA/105362/2022

cangrelor infusion if the sample volume allowed. If blood volume per collection guidelines allowed, 
additional PD samples may have been taken. 
Safety: 
Safety variables included AEs, SAEs, AEs of special interest (AESIs) (including diagnosed intravascular 
thrombosis; clinically relevant bleeding, bleeding in the  brain, abdomen or urinary tract; and a 
confirmed decrease in either haemoglobin or hematocrit of >20%  from the  most proximate value 
measured at a protocol-required time point), clinical laboratory tests (complete blood count [CBC], 
chemistry panel, arterial blood gases with  lactate, troponin levels, and urinalysis), vital signs, physical 
examinations, chest tube  and mediastinal tube output,  and ultrasound examinations (head and 
abdomen). 
Statistical Methods 
The following populations were defined: 
• 
ITT population: included all subjects enrolled in the trial. Enrollment was defined as occurring 
when informed consent was obtained. Therefore, the ITT population included subjects who did 
not receive cangrelor and subjects who did receive cangrelor. Treatment classification was 
based on the assigned cangrelor dosage. The ITT population was used for the  disposition 
summary to allow a full accounting of enrolled subjects; 
•  PK population: included all subjects who had any valid samples measured for study drug 
concentrations. Treatment classification was based on the actual treatment  received; 
•  Safety population: included all subjects who received any infusion of study drug. Treatment 
classification was based on the actual cangrelor dosage received. This was the primary 
population for the safety analyses. 
Pharmacokinetic and  Pharmacodynamic Assessments 
Pharmacokinetics 
For cangrelor and its primary metabolite, AR-C69712XX, PK concentration-time  data were analysed, if 
feasible, using non-compartmental analysis (NCA).  Actual administered total doses were used in the 
NCA calculations and grouped by a scheduled cohort regimen for mean figures and summary tables. 
Population pharmacokinetic and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic analyses: 
PK concentration-time data were evaluated for cangrelor and metabolite, using  population PK 
modelling. The relationship between plasma concentrations of cangrelor and PD (platelet  aggregation) 
was explored using appropriate models, if data permitted. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Inhibition  of platelet aggregation and recovery of platelet function after cessation of the cangrelor 
infusion were determined by LTA and MF  for all subjects in the  Safety population, provided that  the 
blood volume collected per guidelines was adequate and the sample was correctly processed. 
For PD endpoints,  means and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each Cohort according 
to normal approximation. No inferential comparisons were made among the  Cohorts. Categorisation 
was also performed for PD endpoints using commonly applied cut-off values; then  percentage and the 
exact 95%  CI was estimated according to a binomial distribution.  If the baseline LTA result (maximal 
or final) was ˂10%,  the  data were excluded from the tables summarising the respective LTA PD 
endpoints.

Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
A total of 22 subjects were enrolled (Intent-to-Treat  [ITT] population) consisting  of 20  eligible subjects 
who were assigned to Cohorts and 2 subjects that  failed screening. A total of 15 subjects were treated 
with  cangrelor, completed the  study, and were included in the safety and PK populations: 8 subjects 
received cangrelor at a dose of 0.5  μg/kg/min, and 7 subjects received cangrelor at a dose of 0.25 
μg/kg/min. Five subjects assigned to the  cangrelor 0.5 μg/kg/min Cohort did not receive treatment 
and were excluded from the safety and PK analysis populations. 
Overall, 12 subjects (80.0%)  were white,  and 3 subjects (20.0%)  were Black or African American, and 
the majority were of non-Hispanic/Latino  ethnicity (60.0%).  There were 6 males (40.0%)  and 9 
females (60.0%).  The mean (SD) and median (range) age at the time of consent were 4.2  (2.93)  days 
and 4.0 (1.0;  9.0) days, respectively. 
Consistent with  the study inclusion criteria, all 15 subjects (100.0%)  had a medical history of 
congenital, familial, and genetic disorders. The most common medical history PTs in  this SOC were 
hypoplastic left heart syndrome (11 subjects [73.3%])  and patent  ductus arteriosus (10  subjects 
[66.7%]).  All 15 subjects (100.0%)  also had a medical history in the SOC metabolism and nutritional 
disorders, with  the most common PT being hypokalemia (13 subjects [86.7%]).

Note: The cangrelor primary metabolite is identified as AR-C69712XX in all sections of this document that reference PK results 
while the metabolite is identified as AR-C67912 in all other sections. 
Due to  insufficient measurable concentration-time data after the  end of infusion, the  t1/2 of cangrelor 
could not be estimated. The mean t1/2 for AR-C69712XX was 319 and 238  minutes for Cohorts 1 and 2, 
respectively, while no estimates could be made in Cohorts 1-E and 2-E  due to  shortened blood 
sampling duration for these 2 cohorts. 
Population PK/PD results 
Initially, the population  PK and PK/PD results were not  submitted. Upon request, the population PK and 
PK/PD results were submitted  (see responses Question 3). 
Pharmacodynamic results  
Light  Transmittance Aggregometry (LTA) Assay 
The primary PD endpoints were the proportion of subjects in each Cohort who achieved ≥90% inhibition 
of maximal and final platelet aggregation as measured by LTA using 5 μM  and 20 μM  ADP in platelet-
rich plasma and individual recovery of platelet function in  neonates after cessation of the infusion. The

ADP = adenosine diphosphate; max = maximum; min = minimum; LTA = light transmittance aggregometry; SD = standard

 1Note: If the baseline LTA result (maximal or final) was ˂10%, the data were excluded from the table. 
Platelets from post-operative neonates, unlike platelets from adult  patients, undergo disaggregation 
after achieving maximal aggregation (Figure 1), causing a considerable difference between maximal 
and final platelet aggregation. On the  contrary, maximal platelet aggregation, being not affected by 
disaggregation, represents a better indicator of platelet response to ADP after exposure to cangrelor. 
Indeed, the  higher dose of cangrelor (0.5  μg/kg/min) achieves a notably greater maximal platelet 
aggregation inhibition  compared to the  lower dose (0.25 μg/kg/min).   
In several cases, stimulation with  5 μM  ADP was not sufficient to induce a minimum of 10% platelet 
aggregation required to include the data for analysis. For this reason, 33%  (5/15 patients)  of results 
had to be excluded from the  analysis of the  maximal platelet aggregation inhibition,  and 60%  (9/15 
patients) from that  of the  final platelet aggregation inhibition.  In contrast, fewer patients  had to be 
excluded from the analysis in response to 20 μM  ADP as follows: ~13% (2/15  patients) and ~27% 
(4/15  patients) respectively for maximal and final platelet aggregation inhibition.  Therefore, maximal 
platelet aggregation inhibition  measured with LTA after 20 μM  ADP stimulation is considered the most 
clinically relevant parameter to study platelet behavior after exposure to cangrelor in the studied 
neonatal population. Based on above, it can be concluded that  the higher cangrelor dose of 0.5 
μg/kg/min achieved a notably greater magnitude of maximal platelet inhibition  and a greater 
proportion of subjects with  >90% of maximal platelet  aggregation inhibition,  compared to the lower 
cangrelor dose of 0.25  μg/kg/min.

Microfluidics Assay 
Reduction in platelet aggregation (as measured by fluorescence) at 45 minutes into  the cangrelor 
infusion, using a MF  flow chamber, was >50%  in 5 subjects (71.4%) receiving cangrelor at 0.25 
μg/kg/min and 5 subjects (83.3%)  receiving cangrelor at 0.5 μg/kg/min, and >65%  in 1 subject 
(14.3%)  receiving cangrelor at 0.25 μg/kg/min  and 4  subjects (66.7%)  receiving cangrelor at 0.5 
μg/kg/min. Data were not  available for 2 subjects receiving cangrelor at 0.5 μg/kg/min. 
A total of 5 subjects (83.3%) receiving cangrelor at  0.25 μg/kg/min and 4 subjects (66.7%)  receiving 
cangrelor at 0.5 μg  /kg/min achieved ≥90% recovery in platelet aggregation in the  MF assay 1 hour 
after completion of the cangrelor infusion.  Data were not  available for 2 subjects receiving cangrelor at 
0.5 μg/kg/min  nor for 1 subject receiving cangrelor at 0.25 μg/kg/min. 
Safety  results 
Overall, 51 TEAEs were reported in 14 subjects (93.3%) including  27 TEAEs in 6 subjects (85.7%)  who 
received cangrelor at 0.25 μg/kg/min and 24 TEAEs in 8 subjects (100.0%)  who received cangrelor at 
0.5 μg/kg/min. 
The majority of TEAEs were mild (17 TEAEs in 9 subjects [60.0%])  or moderate (25 TEAEs in 9 
subjects [60.0%])  in intensity. Overall, 7 severe TEAEs were experienced by 3 subjects (20.0%) 
including 3  severe TEAEs (hypervolemia, hypotension, and atrial tachycardia) in 1 subject (14.3%) 
who received cangrelor at 0.25 μg/kg/min and 4 severe TEAEs (hypotension, hemorrhage, peripheral 
artery thrombosis, and supraventricular tachycardia [SVT]) in  2 subjects (25.0%)  who received 
cangrelor at 0.5 μg/kg/min.  Two life-threatening TEAEs were reported in 2 subjects (13.3%):  1 event 
(pneumothorax [bilateral pneumothorax]) reported in 1 subject (14.3%)  who received cangrelor at 
0.25  μg/kg/min and 1 event (respiratory failure) reported in 1 subject (12.5%)  who received cangrelor 
at 0.5 μg/kg/min. 
There were no treatment-related TEAEs reported during the  study. 
There were no TEAEs with  fatal outcome reported during the study.

Overall, 3 treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 2 subjects (13.3%):  1 event (pneumothorax 
[bilateral pneumothorax]) reported in 1 subject (14.3%) who  received cangrelor at 0.25  μg/kg/min 
and 2 events (respiratory failure and SVT) reported in 1 subject (12.5%)  who received cangrelor at 0.5 
μg/kg/min. These events were judged as not related to  study treatment and the subjects had 
recovered from these events at the end of the study 
2.3.3.  Updated discussion on clinical aspects 
This Phase I study assessed the safety and PK of two different dose regimens of cangrelor as a 60- 
minute infusion in  a population  of neonates following palliative surgery for congenital heart defects. No 
efficacy assessments were performed. This paediatric phase I study is currently not part of the 
approved PIP, and is not performed in the approved indication. At the  time of the approval of the 
product, FDA granted a paediatric waiver for the product while EMA granted a PIP. The PIP indication is 
"Use for the  prevention of thrombotic events in paediatric patients  undergoing diagnostic and /or 
therapeutic cardiac catheterization".  
The PK profile of cangrelor and its  primary metabolite were characterised in the neonatal population. 
The maximum concentrations of Cangrelor were detected approximately 45 minutes after start  of the 
1-hour infusion, for both dose levels. The half-life of cangrelor could not be determined as the 
concentrations of cangrelor were often below LLOQ after end of infusion. At 10 minutes  after the end of 
the infusion of the 0.5  μg/kg/min dose, 6 of 8 subjects had cangrelor plasma concentrations <5 ng/mL 
and, at that  time point, all of the 7 subjects who received the 0.25 μg/kg/min  dose had concentrations 
<5 ng/mL.  Cangrelor and AR-C69712XX concentrations were determined by means of an appropriately 
validated Liquid  chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)  analytical method. Upon 
request, the Applicant provided the bioanalytical report and method validation report No.  TMC-R4702.  
Further, The Applicant acknowledges EMA suggestion for improving assay sensitivity for future 
paediatric study and the  advice will be taken into  consideration.   
The PK parameters of neonates who receive a 0.25  μg/kg/min and 0.5 μg/kg/min  dose differ from 
those observed in adults who receive 4 μg/kg/min  dose. In adults, the Cmax was 488ng/mL,  the t1/2 3-6 
min and the PK was linear. Further the  non-active metabolite AR-C69712XX demonstrates a Cmax about 
26% of that  of the parent. In neonates, at low dose levels, the PK does not appear to be linear. The 
Cmax was 19 ng/ml for the 0.25  μg/kg/min dose and 60ng/ml for the 0.5  μg/kg/min, and the 
metabolite AR-C69712XX demonstrates a Cmax about 50% and 31% of that  of the parent respectively.  
The observed nonlinearity should be taken into  account in the interpretation of the PK-PD modelling 
results.  Initially, the population PK and PK/PD report could not  be found in the  dossier. Upon request 
the Applicant submitted  the population report. Further, the Applicant  acknowledges EMA suggestion 
and the advice will  be taken into consideration for improving non-linearity for future paediatric study.  
The population PK model is roughly in  line with previous adult  model. Model development methods 
were acceptable, however, the model has some limitations.  The paediatric dataset is small, and no 
paediatric data have been used to validate model performance. Despite of this it can be concluded that 
the pharmacokinetics in neonatal patients is similar to adults. In adults cangrelor PK concentrations 
were described by a 2-compartment model with  first-order elimination  with allometric scales and the 
same model appears to be applicable to neonatal patients. 
The exposure observed in neonatal patients, who received a 0.25 or 0.5 μg/kg/min dose, was within 
the exposure range observed for adults who  received a dose up to 4  μg/kg/min (8 to 16x higher). A 
similar concentration-time profile was observed in neonatal patients,  including the  fast elimination  and 
metabolism to the primary metabolite AR-C69712XX. In adults,  the cangrelor half-life is 3-6 minutes, 
which results in rapidly reversible platelet inhibition.  In adults platelet responses returned toward 
baseline within  15  minutes of discontinuation of infusion. Although  the half-life in neonates could not 
EMA/105362/2022  
Page 12/35 
 
  
 
 
be determined, the available PK data indicate that cangrelor is also rapidly metabolised in  neonates, 
very low or non-detectable levels of cangrelor were found 5 minutes  post infusion and relatively high 
levels of the primary metabolite were detected. 
The PK/PD model was not stable, most likely due to  the insufficient data and therefore difficult to 
interpret. Simulations predict PK differences between the 0.25  and 0.5 μg/kg/min dose level without 
apparent differences in platelet  aggregation inhibition.  In the paediatric population, the platelet 
aggregation is inhibited  shortly after start  of the  infusion, in the paediatric population and after 
infusion it  is predicted to return to baseline within  several hours. 
The pharmacodynamics of 0.25 μg/kg/min (N=7)  or 0.5 μg/kg/min  (N=8) cangrelor were evaluated by 
light  transmittance aggrometry (LTA). The proportion of subjects in the 0.25  μg/kg/min (N=7)  or 0.5 
μg/kg/min (N=8)  cangrelor dose who  achieved ≥90% inhibition  of maximal and final platelet 
aggregation as measured by LTA using  5 μM and 20 μM  ADP in platelet-rich plasma was a primary PD 
endpoint. The primary PD was based on the  study by Angiolillo et al. (2012)  which used platelet 
aggregation inhibition   ≥  60% in 80% of the patients  as endpoint  to identify the appropriate dose for 
cangrelor. Compared to the study by Angiolillo et al. a higher degree of platelet inhibition,  i.e. ≥90%, 
was chosen based on the  presence of negative trial results which  were high likely caused by 
suboptimal doses and based on consultation  with  an expert in the developmental of anti-platelet 
agents. 
The proportions of subjects who achieved ≥ 90% inhibition  of final platelet aggregation as measured 
by LTA were 4 subjects (80.0%) receiving 0.25  μg/kg/min cangrelor and 3 subjects (50.0%) receiving 
0.5 μg/kg/min  cangrelor in response to ADP 20 µM  and 3 subjects (100.0%)  receiving 0.25  μg/kg/min 
cangrelor and 3 subjects (100.0%)  receiving 0.5 μg/kg/min cangrelor in response to ADP 5 µM.  The 
proportions of subjects who achieved ≥ 90% inhibition  of maximal platelet aggregation as measured by 
LTA were 2 subjects (28.6%)  receiving 0.25 μg/kg/min cangrelor and 3 subjects (50.0%)  receiving 0.5 
μg/kg/min cangrelor in response to ADP 20µM  and 3 subjects (60.0%)  receiving 0.25 μg/kg/min 
cangrelor and 4 subjects (80.0%) receiving 0.5  μg/kg/min cangrelor in response to ADP 5 µM.  The 
magnitude of maximum platelet inhibition  was notably greater with  the higher cangrelor dose of 0.5 
μg/kg/min, whereas with  respect to final platelet inhibition  the lower dose showed better platelet 
aggregation inhibition  compared with  the higher dose. Furthermore, recovery of platelet function 
(aggregation) was documented 1 hour after completion of the cangrelor infusion. 
Platelet aggregation analyses showed that  platelets from post-operative neonates, unlike platelets from 
adult patients,  undergo disaggregation after achieving maximal aggregation. In this  respect, maximal 
platelet aggregation, being not affected by disaggregation, represents a better indicator of platelet 
response to ADP after exposure to cangrelor compared to final platelet aggregation. Furthermore, since 
in several cases stimulation with  5 μM  ADP was not sufficient to induce a minimum of 10% platelet 
aggregation required to include the data for analysis, maximal platelet aggregation after 20 μM  ADP 
stimulation  was considered the  most appropriate. Based on these findings, it can be concluded that  the 
higher cangrelor dose of 0.5 μg/kg/min achieved a greater magnitude of maximal platelet inhibition 
and a greater proportion of subjects with  >90% of maximal platelet aggregation inhibition,  compared 
to the lower cangrelor dose of 0.25  μg/kg/min and that this  dose can be selected in order to be further 
evaluated in future studies.   
With  respect to safety, a total  of 51 TEAEs were reported in 14  subjects (93.3%),  of which the majority 
were mild (17  TEAEs in  9 subjects [60.0%])  or moderate (25 TEAEs in 9 subjects [60.0%])  in 
intensity.  There were 3 serious adverse events reported in 2 subjects (13.3%): 1  event 
(pneumothorax) reported in 1 subject (14.3%)  who received cangrelor at 0.25  μg/kg/min and 2 events 
(respiratory failure and SVT) reported in 1 subject (12.5%)  who received cangrelor at 0.5  μg/kg/min, 
which were assessed as not related to study treatment. Furthermore, none of the  other adverse events 
was considered related to treatment.  No differences in safety findings were apparent between the two 
cangrelor doses evaluated, although  firm conclusions cannot be made due to the limited  number of 
patients.

Upon request, the Applicant agreed that  considering this  Phase 1 study provides the first, although 
preliminary, PK/PD and safety data on two  dosages of cangrelor in a specific neonatal population, 
information on this study in the  labelling is clinically relevant. Consequently the Applicant proposed to 
include information on this study in section 5.1  and 5.2,  which is endorsed. In the previous round, the 
proposed addition to  section 4.2  was however not  considered acceptable and an alternative wording 
was proposed by CHMP.  In this round the company has accepted this  wording. 
3.  Rapporteur’s updated overall conclusion and 
recommendation 
Based on the results of study MDCO-CAN-15-01MDCO-CAN-15-01it  is not possible to  evaluate the 
risk/benefit ratio in  neonates. Consequently, it is not possible to provide clear dosing recommendations 
which is adequately been reflected in section 4.1.  Additionally, clinically relevant information on this 
study are included in section 5.1  and 5.2  of the  SmPC.  See for the wording the attached separate file 
with  the annotated product information.

4.  Additional clarification requested (1st round) 
Based on the data submitted,  the MAH should address the  following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  The Applicant is requested to provide the context of this  paediatric phase I study, since it is 
currently not part of the approved PIP and it is not performed in the approved indication. 
2.  The Applicant is asked to provide a description of the bioanalytical method used (OC) and is 
advised to develop a more sensitive bioanalytical method for the planned paediatric study.  
3.  The Applicant is asked to submit the population  report for study MDCO-CAN-15-01 or to 
indicate where the  information can be found (OC). Further, the  Applicant is advised to consider 
non-linearity in the dose selection of the planned paediatric study. 
4.  The Applicant is requested to justify the chosen primary objective of the proportion of subjects 
in each Cohort who achieved ≥90%, considering that  in the initial  marketing authorisation 
application of cangrelor the pharmacological effect was demonstrated by a mean inhibition  of 
platelet aggregation. Additionally, the Applicant is requested to clarify and justify the most 
clinically relevant PD parameter for platelet aggregation inhibition,  i.e. final or maximal platelet 
aggregation inhibition,  in  the intended indication. Consequently, the Applicant is requested to 
provide a revised table accordingly.  
5.  According to the  revision 1 frequently asked question on SmPC paediatric information 
(EMA/551202/2010  Rev 1),  in line with the  SmPC guideline, results of all pharmacodynamic 
(clinically relevant) conducted in children should be presented in section 5.1, even if there is no 
authorised indication in any subset of the  population (adult and paediatric populations) and/or 
no paediatric investigation plan for the condition covering this non-authorised indication, if the 
information is considered relevant to prescribers. In this context, the Applicant is requested to 
reconsider providing a proposal to include the  results of this  study in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In any case, a scientific discussion is needed addressing whether or not a text proposal may be 
of use to  healthcare professionals. Cross-references should be included with  section 4.2,  which

summarises available information and recommendations in  the paediatric population  through 
the use of the standard statements.

5.  Assessment of MAH responses to request for additional 
clarification 1st round 
Question 1 
The Applicant is requested to provide the context of this  paediatric phase I study, since it is currently 
not part of the approved PIP and it  is not  performed in the approved indication. 
Applicant comments: 
The current PIP indication is "Use for the  prevention of thrombotic events in paediatric patients 
undergoing diagnostic and /or therapeutic cardiac catheterization".  The true incidence of thrombosis 
and/or for thrombosis related complications in diagnostic or interventional setting is unknown [Giglia et 
al 2013],  with definitions  and surveillance methods highly variable among reports of thrombosis. 
However, according to consensus scientific statement,  it is ‘generally accepted’ that  the risk of venous 
or arterial thrombosis after cardiac catheterization in  children can be reduced by procedural 
anticoagulation [Giglia et al 2013] 
Current available therapies (heparins and lytic  agents) successfully meet the medical need for 
antithrombotic  treatment in paediatric patients undergoing diagnostic of percutaneous intervention. 
Periprocedural anticoagulants include heparin (or other thrombin inhibitors), which  may be continued 
for 12 to 48 hours, with  transition to  aspirin for longer-term prophylaxis. Fibrinolytic  agents may be 
used for limb ischemia that persists after heparin therapy. In these catheter-based diagnostic and 
interventional procedures, several mechanisms of thrombosis have been described, i.e., vessel 
injury/trauma, contact activation by instrumentation,  and vessel spasm, which  are appropriately 
addressed by anticoagulation  [Saxena et al 1997],  [Thom KE et al, 2011].  
The product was developed by a company called The Medicines Company (MDCO) – a US based 
company. At the  time of the  approval of the product, FDA granted a paediatric waiver for the product 
while EMA granted a PIP. 
The study MDCO-CAN-15-01 was initiated  by MDCO in  US. MDCO was the former sponsor of the study. 
After the acquisition of the product from MDCO, the  sponsorship of the study was transferred from 
MDCO to Chiesi USA and Chiesi USA continued  the study. 
The study involved only US centres. Only recently we realized that in  March 2019 the sponsorship of 
the IND (and therefore of the study) was further transferred from Chiesi USA to  Chiesi Farmaceutici 
SpA (which  is the Marketing Authorization Holder of the product in EU). 
CHMP  comment 
The Applicant has adequately described the context of the study MDCO-CAN-15-01.  At the time of the 
approval of the product, FDA granted a paediatric waiver for the  product, while EMA granted a PIP. The 
PIP indication  is "Use for the prevention of thrombotic  events in paediatric patients undergoing 
diagnostic and /or therapeutic cardiac catheterization". The approval of the PIP occurred before the 
approval of the waiver in the US, the  study MDCO-CAN-15-01 was initiated  by MDCO in the  US.  
In the opinion of the Rapporteur, considering that in  Study MDCO-CAN-15-01  the use of cangrelor in 
the neonatal population appears effective (based on PD parameters) and safe, it is clinically relevant to 
investigate the use of cangrelor for antithrombotic  treatment in paediatric patients  undergoing 
diagnostic of percutaneous intervention in future studies. In this  context, it should also be taken into 
account that  although heparins are used in paediatric patients in this  setting,  most heparins are not 
approved for the paediatric population; This also applies to aspirin.

Population PK and PKPD Analysis MDCO-CAN-15-01 
OBJECTIVES:  The objectives of this  population pharmacokinetic (PPK) and pharmacokinetic-
pharmacodynamics (PKPD) analysis were: 
EMA/105362/2022  
Page 18/35 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  To develop a PPK model to describe and predict the PK of cangrelor in adult and neonatal 
subjects, including: 
o  To evaluate potential covariates to identify and characterize intrinsic/extrinsic factors 
contributing  to the PK variability, and 
o  To determine the source and magnitude of PK variability and assess model 
performance of the PPK model developed for cangrelor, 
•  To develop population PKPD models in neonatal subjects to describe the concentration effect 
relationship between cangrelor exposure and inhibition  for adenosine diphosphate (ADP)-
induced platelet aggregation using  5 μM or 20 μM  ADP, and 
•  To perform simulations using the population PKPD model for potential  doses/duration of 
injections in neonatal patients to quantify  the selection of doses. 
DATA: Two databases (PPK and PKPD) were created for this  evaluation. The PPK database was pooled 
data from MDCO-CAN-1501  (neonatal subjects, N=15)  and 2  adult studies; SC-931-5014  (N=22)  and 
SC-931-5036  (N=15).  For the PPK model development, MDCO-CAN-1501  and SC-931-5036  were used 
to balance the  number of subjects from adult  and neonatal subjects. SC-931-5014  was used for 
external validation during model performance evaluation. The PKPD database included only MDCO-
CAN-1501  (neonatal subjects, N=15)  with  cangrelor concentrations and ADP-induced platelet 
aggregation using  5 μM or 20 μM  ADP. Subjects were excluded from the  analysis if their baseline 
platelet aggregation is 0%. 
METHODS:  A previously developed PPK model was updated [1]  by fitting  data obtained from MDCO-
CAN-1501  (neonatal subjects, N=15)  and SC-931-5036  (adult subjects, N=15).  Due to the limited 
number of subjects, only body weight  (WT) and creatinine clearance (CrCL) on clearance (CL) and/or 
volume of distribution  terms were tested. A final model was chosen by forward addition,  retaining only 
the statistically  significant covariate effects (p<0.001).  The model performance was evaluated by a 
visual predictive check (VPC) using  the original dataset and SC-931-5014  (N=22)  for external 
validation. 
For the PKPD model, a direct-response model was developed in which the PK parameters were fixed to 
the final parameter estimates obtained from the final PPK model. The effect of cangrelor was described 
as a sigmoid inhibitory maximum effect (Emax) model on the platelet  aggregation induced by either 5 
μM  or 20 μM  ADP. Goodness of fit (GOF)  plots were generated to  assess the adequacy of the model. 
The parameters in the population models were estimated using the NONMEM  software program 
(version 7.3)  using the First  Order Conditional Estimation method (FOCE).  A VPC was conducted to 
evaluate the final PPK and PKPD model performance using R (version 3.5.3). 
RESULTS: The PPK of cangrelor were characterized by a 2-compartment disposition model with zero-
order (intravenous) input and first order elimination. WT and CrCL were retained in the  final PPK 
model. The sigmoid Emax model was selected to describe the  relationship between cangrelor 
concentration and inhibition  of ADP-induced platelet aggregation. The schematic diagram of the model 
is illustrated in Figure  S1 and the final parameter estimates are summarized in Table S1 for PPK model, 
and Table S2 and S3 for PKPD models.

For PPK model evaluation, basic GOF plots along with  other standard metrics such as shrinkage and 
condition number were evaluated. A VPC was conducted with  the final model predictive distributions  of 
the median concentrations within  various time intervals compared with  the observed medians by VPCs. 
Figure S2 depicts the observed and simulated concentration time profiles for MDCO-CAN-1501 
(neonatal subjects), SC-931-5036  (adult subjects) and SC-931-5014 (adult  subjects). The data from 
SC-931-5014  was not used for the PPK model development therefore it  serves as an external 
validation. Figure S3 depicts the dose-normalized VPC for MDCO-CAN-1501  (neonatal subjects received 
0.25  or 0.5 μg/kg/min  over 1-hr infusion). The summary metrics of the observed and simulated data 
(lower 2.5th, 50th and upper 97.5th percentiles) were in good agreement and the observed 
concentrations generally fell within  the  95th percent of the predictive distribution.

Similar to  the PPK model evaluation, basic GOF plots along with  other standard metrics, as well as VPC 
plots, were evaluated for the  PKPD model. Figure S4 and Figure S5 depicts the observed and simulated 
ADP-induced platelet aggregation (5μM  or 20μM  ADP) time profiles. The model predictions for PD Emax 
(around at 0.75 hr) tend  to be under-predicted with  both 5μM  ADP and 20μM  ADP PKPD models. 
However, in  general, the model captures the overall trend and the predictions demonstrate reasonable 
agreement with  the observed data.

aggregation is completely inhibited during the  cangrelor infusion.

CONCLUSIONS: 
The following are the key findings of this  evaluation: 
• The time course of cangrelor PK concentrations were described by a 2-compartment model with 
first-order elimination  with allometric scales (estimated power coefficient of normalized WT by 70kg) 
on clearance parameters [CL and inter-compartmental clearance (Q)] and volume of distributions [ 
central distribution  (Vc) and peripheral distribution  (Vp)]. In addition, CrCL was significant on CL and 
retained in the final PPK model. 
• The direct-response PD model reasonably describes the time course of ADP-induced platelet 
aggregation in  neonatal subjects although the  data is very limited. The PD effect is instantaneous and 
strongly inhibits  the platelet aggregation.  
• The PKPD simulations for a typical neonatal subject with cangrelor treatment  of 24-  or 72-hour 
infusion show that  steady-state cangrelor concentrations are reached quickly, and the platelet 
aggregation is completely inhibited during the  cangrelor infusion with rapid reversible effects. 
CHMP  comment 
As requested, the Applicant submitted  the population PK and PK/PD report. A previously developed 
popPK model was updated by fitting  data obtained from MDCO-CAN-1501 (neonatal subjects, N=15) 
and SC-931-5036  (adult subjects, N=15).  Model development methods were acceptable; however, the 
model has some limitations. The neonatal dataset is small, and no neonatal data have been used to 
validate model performance.  
Despite of this,  it can be concluded that  the pharmacokinetics in neonatal patients is similar to adults. 
In adults cangrelor PK concentrations were described by a 2-compartment model with first-order 
elimination with  allometric scales, and the same model appears to be applicable to neonatal patients. 
EMA/105362/2022  
Page 24/35 
 
  
 
 
 
 
As shown in Figure S2 the exposure observed in pediatric patients, who received a 0.25 or 0.5 
μg/kg/min dose (VPC plot: prot-1501)  was within  the exposure range observed for adults,  who 
received a dose up to 4 μg/kg/min (8 to  16x higher) (VPC plots prot-5014  and prot-5036).  
In adults, cangrelor is rapidly distributed  reaching Cmax within  minutes  after administration of an 
intravenous bolus followed by infusion and after the end of infusion, the cangrelor elimination was 
rapid due to  deactivation by dephosphorylation, with  an estimated elimination half-life of 6  minutes. A 
similar concentration-time profile is observed in neonatal patients, including the  fast elimination and 
metabolism to the primary metabolite AR-C69712XX and apparently with  less variability.  
The PKPD model was not stable, most likely due to the  insufficient data and therefore difficult to 
interpret. As can be observed in Figure S6, simulations predict PK differences between the 0.25 and 
0.5 μg/kg/min  dose level (upper panel), but no apparent differences in platelet  aggregation inhibition 
are predicted (lower panel). In the neonatal population, the  platelet aggregation is inhibited  shortly 
after start of the infusion, and after infusion,  it is predicted to return to baseline within  several hours.  
The PK data are considered sufficiently clear to  support an update of the SmPC. The Applicant is asked 
to update SmPC section 5.2: 
Paediatric population:  
Cangrelor infusion has been evaluated in neonatal patients (age from birth to 28 days) at a dose level of 0.25 and 0.5 
μg/kg/minThe maximum concentrations were 19 ng/mL and 60ng/mL, respectively, and were observed approximately 45 minutes 
following start of infusion. In neonates, cangrelor is rapidly metabolised into its primary metabolite AR-C69712XX. Very  low or 
non-detectable levels of cangrelor were found 5 minutes post-infusion and relatively high levels of the primary metabolite were 
detected. 
PKPD data are insufficiently clear to  support a selection of an optimal dose, although it  appears that 
both dose levels are in the effective and safe range. 
Issue resolved, provided that  the SmPC section 5.2 is updated. 
Issue 4 
The Applicant is requested to justify the chosen primary objective of the proportion of subjects in each 
Cohort who achieved ≥90%, considering that  in the initial  marketing authorisation  application of 
cangrelor the pharmacological effect was demonstrated by a mean inhibition  of platelet aggregation. 
Additionally, the Applicant is requested to  clarify and justify the  most clinically relevant PD parameter 
for platelet aggregation inhibition,  i.e. final or maximal platelet aggregation inhibition,  in the intended 
indication. Consequently, the Applicant is requested to  provide a revised table accordingly. 
Applicant comments: 
Our primary PD endpoint of ≥90%  reduction in maximal platelet aggregation in 60% of patients was 
based on the study entitled  “Bridging Antiplatelet Therapy With  Cangrelor in Patients Undergoing 
Cardiac Surgery” (Angiolillo et al. J Am Med Assoc. 2012). 
Stage 1 of this  study was an open-label phase aimed to identify the dose of cangrelor that  would 
achieve the desirable anti-platelet  effect: cangrelor IV infusion was planned to  be administered to 
cohorts of 5  patients at a time in a step-wise fashion at predetermined doses (0.5, 0.75,  1.0, 1.5  and 
2.0 μg/kg per minute) until  percent platelet inhibition  was greater than 60% in  80% of daily blood 
samples or a dose of 2.0 μg/kg per minute  was reached. 5  patients completed the  first cohort at a 
dose of 0.5 μg/kg per minute; and 5 completed the second at a dose of 0.75  μg/kg per minute.  The 
cangrelor dose of 0.75  μg/kg per minute met the  efficacy end point  of maintenance of platelet 
EMA/105362/2022  
Page 25/35 
 
  
 
 
inhibition  in at least 80% of patient  samples higher than 60% (94.4%  of samples [17 of 18];  95% CI, 
83.9%-100%),  and was chosen for stage 2 of the trial. 
Compared to the study by Angiolillo et al, we chose as a primary objective a higher degree of platelet 
inhibition  (≥90%)  based on the knowledge that: 
1.  Appropriate dose selection appears to be a major problem in past pediatric drug trials and may 
contribute to  the high rate of negative trial results (Torok et al. J Am Heart Assoc 2018). This 
is best exemplified in a review published by the  FDA, which  concluded that  the dose selected 
for the clopidogrel pivotal trial was likely suboptimal to demonstrate efficacy in shunt palliation 
in neonates and infants  with  congenital heart disease (Wang et al. Clin Pharmacol Ther. 2015). 
In particular, dosing for the Clopidogrel in  Infants with Systemic-to-Pulmonary-Artery Shunts 
(CLARINET) trial was based on previous adult studies  where a ceiling effect was noted at 50% 
to 60%  of platelet inhibition  (Wiviott  et al. Circulation. 2004).  There was a false assumption 
that  this level of inhibition  would translate into  efficacy seen in the adult studies.  In fact, 
clopidogrel in this  patient population,  80% of which were also receiving aspirin, did not reduce 
either mortality from any cause or shunt-related morbidity (Wessel et al. New Engl  J Med. 
2013). 
2.  In prior consultation  with an anti-platelet  expert physician, it was suggested that  we attempt 
to achieve as close to 90%  platelet inhibition  as possible. This was based on his experience 
with  the development of the aIIbb3 inhibitor  abciximab (ReoPro). Indeed, pharmacological 
efficacy was achieved with the selection of a >80% level of aIIbb3 integrin  blockade with 
suppression of platelet aggregation to <20% of baseline (Tcheng et al. Circulation 1994). 
CHMP  comment 
The Applicant has clarified that the  primary endpoint of proportion of subjects who achieved ≥90% 
inhibition  of platelet aggregation in Study MDCO-CAN-15-01  was based on the study by Angiolillo et al. 
(2012),  which used platelet inhibition  ≥ 60% in  80% of the patients as an endpoint to identify the 
appropriate dose for cangrelor. Compared to the study by Angiolillo et al., a higher degree of platelet 
inhibition,  i.e. ≥90%,  was chosen based on the presence of negative trial results that  were highly likely 
caused by suboptimal doses and based on consultation  with  an expert in the development of anti-
platelet agents.  
Nevertheless, the Applicant still  has not clarified and justified the most clinically relevant PD parameter 
for platelet aggregation inhibition,  i.e. final or maximal platelet aggregation inhibition,  in the intended 
indication. Identification  of the  most clinically relevant PD parameter in the intended indication  is 
required in order to  select the most appropriate dose to be further evaluated in future studies since the 
magnitude of maximum platelet inhibition  was notably greater with  the higher cangrelor dose of 0.5 
μg/kg/min compared with  the lower dose of 0.25 μg/kg/min,  whereas concerning final platelet 
inhibition  the lower dose showed better platelet aggregation inhibition  compared with  the higher dose. 
Consequently, the Applicant is requested to provide a revised table accordingly.

CHMP  comment 
The Applicant has not  (yet) provided a proposal to include the results of Study MDCO-CAN-15-01  in 
section 5.1 of the SmPC.  
As already argued in the raised OC, according to the  revision 1 frequently asked question on SmPC 
paediatric information (EMA/551202/2010  Rev 1), in line with  the SmPC guideline, results of all 
pharmacodynamic (clinically relevant) conducted in  children should be presented in section 5.1,  even if

6.  Additional clarification requested (2nd round) 
Based on the data submitted,  the MAH should address the  following questions as part of this 
procedure: 
1.  The Applicant is still requested to  clarify and justify the most clinically relevant PD parameter 
for platelet aggregation inhibition,  i.e. final or maximal platelet aggregation inhibition,  in the 
intended indication.  Identification of the  most clinically relevant PD parameter in the intended 
indication is warranted in order to select the most appropriate dose to be further evaluated in 
future studies since the magnitude of maximal platelet inhibition  was notably greater with  the 
higher cangrelor dose of 0.5 μg/kg/min compared with  the lower dose of 0.25 μg/kg/min, 
whereas with  respect to final platelet  inhibition  the lower dose showed better platelet 
aggregation inhibition  compared with  the higher dose. Consequently, the Applicant is 
requested to  provide a revised table accordingly. 
2.  According to the  revision 1 frequently asked question on SmPC paediatric information 
(EMA/551202/2010  Rev 1),  in line with the  SmPC guideline, results of all pharmacodynamic 
(clinically relevant) conducted in children should be presented in section 5.1, even if there is no 
authorized indication in any subset of the  population (adult and paediatric populations) and/or 
no paediatric investigation plan for the condition covering this non-authorised indication, if the 
information is considered relevant to prescribers. In this context, the Applicant is requested to 
reconsider providing a proposal to include the  results of this  study in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
In any case, a scientific discussion is needed addressing whether or not a text proposal may be 
of use to  healthcare professionals. Cross-references should be included with  section 4.2,  which 
summarises available information and recommendations in  the paediatric population  through 
the use of the standard statements

Cangrelor infusion has been evaluated in  neonatal patients  (age from birth to 28  days) at a 
dose level of 0.25  and 0.5 μg/kg/min.  The maximum concentrations were 19  ng/mL and 
60ng/mL,  respectively, and were observed approximately 45 minutes following start  of 
infusion. In neonates, cangrelor is rapidly metabolised into  its primary metabolite AR-
C69712XX. Very low or non-detectable levels of cangrelor were found 5 minutes  post-infusion 
and relatively high levels of the primary metabolite were detected.

7.  Assessment of MAH responses to request for additional 
clarification 2nd round 
Question 1 
The Applicant is still requested to  clarify and justify the most clinically relevant PD parameter for 
platelet aggregation inhibition,  i.e. final or maximal platelet aggregation inhibition,  in the intended 
indication. Identification  of the  most clinically relevant PD parameter in the intended indication  is 
warranted in order to select the most appropriate dose to  be further evaluated in future  studies since 
the magnitude of maximal platelet inhibition  was notably greater with  the higher cangrelor dose of 0.5 
μg/kg/min compared with  the lower dose of 0.25 μg/kg/min,  whereas with respect to final platelet 
inhibition  the lower dose showed better platelet aggregation inhibition  compared with  the higher dose. 
Consequently, the Applicant is requested to provide a revised table accordingly 
Applicant comments: 
The Applicant clarifies that  the most clinically relevant PD parameter for assessing inhibition of platelet 
aggregation by LTA in the studied neonatal population is the  extent to which maximal platelet 
aggregation is altered by cangrelor in  response to stimulation with  20 μM  ADP. Therefore, the Applicant 
believes that the  study findings indicate that  the most appropriate dose to  be selected for further 
evaluation in future studies is 0.5 μg/kg/min.  
We have found that  platelets from post-operative neonates, unlike platelets from adult patients, 
undergo disaggregation after achieving maximal aggregation (please, see the figure below), causing a 
considerable difference between maximal and final platelet  aggregation. To our knowledge, this 
phenomenon is unique to  the studied neonatal population, and affects the  results of the final platelet 
aggregation inhibition,  posing questions on its  interpretability. On the contrary, maximal platelet 
aggregation, being not  affected by disaggregation, represents a better indicator of platelet response to 
ADP after exposure to cangrelor. Indeed, the higher dose of cangrelor (0.5 μg/kg/min)  achieves a 
notably greater maximal platelet aggregation inhibition  compared to the lower dose (0.25  μg/kg/min).

Figure: 1. Representative LTA aggregation  results for platelets isolated from a post-operative neonatal cardiac 
patient prior to administration of cangrelor. Platelet aggregation  in response  to 5 μM and 20 μM ADP is shown. 
The degree of platelet disaggregation  following maximal platelet aggregation is depicted  by the red arrow. 
We have also found that  in several cases stimulation  with 5 μM  ADP was not sufficient to  induce a 
minimum of 10% platelet aggregation required to include the data for analysis. For this  reason, 33% 
(5/15  patients) of results had to  be excluded from the analysis of the maximal platelet  aggregation 
inhibition,  and 60% (9/15  patients) from that  of the final platelet  aggregation inhibition.  In contrast, 
fewer patients  had to be excluded from the analysis in response to  20 μM ADP as follows: ~13%  (2/15 
patients) and ~27%  (4/15  patients) respectively for maximal and final platelet aggregation inhibition.   
According to these findings,  the Sponsor believes that maximal platelet  aggregation inhibition 
measured with  LTA after 20 μM  ADP stimulation  is the most clinically relevant parameter to study 
platelet behavior after exposure to cangrelor in the studied neonatal population. By applying this 
method, the study found that  the higher cangrelor dose of 0.5 μg/kg/min  achieved a notably greater 
magnitude of maximal platelet inhibition  and a greater proportion of subjects with  >90% of maximal 
platelet aggregation inhibition,  compared to the lower cangrelor dose of 0.25 μg/kg/min (please, see 
the table below).

It is also noteworthy to highlight  that  a multi-channel,  low volume microfluidic device was used to 
assess the effects of cangrelor on thrombus growth as an exploratory endpoint. In this system, whole

blood is perfused over surface-immobilized collagen that  supports both  Von Willebrand Factor 
deposition and initial platelet  activation through glycoprotein VI. Subsequent clot  build-up relies on the 
endogenous release of ADP from platelets resulting in P2Y12-mediated aggregation. Thus, this system 
simulates well in vivo conditions found at  sites of vascular injury. We have found that ~70%  of platelet 
accrual in this  system is amenable to P2Y12 inhibition  (maximal inhibition).  Results from the phase 1 
study were as follows: mean (±  SD) % maximal reduction in platelet  aggregation was 64.2 (10.68) 
with  the higher cangrelor dose (0.5  μg/kg/min dose) and 52.8  (11.41) with  the lower cangrelor dose 
(0.25  μg/kg/min dose). The difference between the two dosing cohorts was highly statistically 
significant (P < .0001),  which  was comparable to LTA results using 20 μM  ADP and maximal platelet 
inhibition  values.  
CHMP  comment 
The Applicant has adequately justified that the  “maximal platelet aggregation” is the most appropriate 
PD parameter in order to select the  dose to be further evaluated in future studies. In the response, the 
Applicant argues that  platelets from post-operative neonates, unlike platelets from adults  patients, 
undergo disaggregation after achieving maximal aggregation. This disaggregation phenomenon affects 
the results of final platelet aggregations, which  consequently, become difficult  to interpret.  In this 
respect, it  is acknowledged that maximal platelet aggregation, being not  affected by disaggregation, 
represents a better indicator of platelet  response to ADP after exposure to cangrelor.  
Furthermore, since in  several cases stimulation with  5 μM ADP was not sufficient  to induce a minimum 
of 10% platelet aggregation required to include the data for analysis, maximal platelet aggregation 
after 20 μM ADP stimulation was considered the most appropriate.  
Based on above, it was concluded that the  higher cangrelor dose of 0.5  μg/kg/min achieved a greater 
magnitude of maximal platelet inhibition  and a greater proportion of subjects with >90% of maximal 
platelet aggregation inhibition,  compared to the lower cangrelor dose of 0.25 μg/kg/min. These 
findings were supported by the exploratory endpoint analyses on thrombus growth. 
Issue solved 
Question 2 
According to the  revision 1 frequently asked question on SmPC paediatric information 
(EMA/551202/2010  Rev 1),  in line with the  SmPC guideline, results of all pharmacodynamic (clinically 
relevant) conducted in children should be presented in section 5.1,  even if there is no authorized 
indication in  any subset of the population (adult  and paediatric populations) and/or no paediatric 
investigation plan for the condition covering this  non-authorised indication,  if the information is 
considered relevant to prescribers. In this context, the Applicant is requested to reconsider providing a 
proposal to include the  results of this  study in section 5.1 of the SmPC. In any case, a scientific 
discussion is needed addressing whether or not a text proposal may be of use to healthcare 
professionals. Cross-references should be included with  section 4.2, which summarises available 
information and recommendations in the paediatric population through the use of the standard 
statements. 
Applicant comments: 
The Applicant appreciates the comments raised by the  Agency and, after a further evaluation, agrees 
to provide a text proposal to  include the  results of the study in  section 5.1  of the SmPC and a cross-
reference in section 4.2.   
EMA/105362/2022  
Page 31/35 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Actually, the Applicant has already recognized, in agreement with  the Agency, the limitations  of the 
study, partially inherent in the nature of all phase 1 study, partially specific of this  study such as the 
limited population,  the low sensitivity of the bioanalytical assay which could not  determine all the 
concentrations after the  end of the infusion,  the small dataset for the population PK model.  
For these reasons, the Applicant has acknowledged that the  results of the study cannot be considered 
conclusive.  
Nevertheless, the Applicant believes that  this Phase 1  study is clinically relevant as it provides the first, 
although preliminary, PK/PD and safety data on two dosages of cangrelor in the neonatal population, in 
a peculiar clinical context in which,  unlike for adults, the neonatal use of antiplatelet agents is off-label 
and affected by the shortage of information.  
In particular, we agree with  the Agency that  the pharmacokinetics in neonatal patients is similar to 
adults, that  the PK-PD results of the study cannot provide clear dosing recommendations, that  the use 
of cangrelor appears safe as no adverse event was considered related to  treatment, and no differences 
in safety findings  were apparent between the  two cangrelor doses evaluated, although  firm conclusions 
cannot be made due to the limited  number of patients.  
In conclusion, the Applicant agrees with the  Agency’s position according to which  the findings of this 
study suggest that  “[..] the use of cangrelor in the neonatal population appears effective (based on PD 
parameters) and safe”.  
Therefore, given the relevance for the prescriber and to improve the availability of information on the 
use of medicines for children, the Applicant proposes the following  wording to be included in  sections 
5.1 of the SmPC and cross-referenced in section 4.2: 
Section 4.2 
“Outside its  authorised indication,  Cangrelor has been studied in a Phase 1 study in neonates ≤ 28 
days of life with  congenital heart disease requiring palliation with  a systemic-to-pulmonary artery 
shunt,  a right  ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt,  or a ductus arteriosus stent. The results of this 
study with  PK-PD data in the neonatal population are described in  sections 5.1  and 5.2.” 
Section 5.1 
“In a prospective, open-label, single-arm, multi-center, Phase I study, cangrelor was evaluated at 2 
dose levels of 0.5 and 0.25  µg/kg/min  in 15 neonates ≤ 28 days of life with  congenital heart disease 
requiring palliation with  a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt, a right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery 
shunt,  or a ductus arteriosus stent (see section 4.2).  Platelet aggregation inhibition  was assessed by 
LTA in response to stimulation  with  20 and 5 µM ADP.  The % inhibition  of maximal aggregation 45 
minutes into  cangrelor infusion and the number of subjects who achieved >90% of maximal platelet 
aggregation inhibition  are summarized in the table below.

CHMP  comment 
The Applicant stated that  considering this Phase 1 study provides the first, although  preliminary, PK/PD 
and safety data on two dosages of cangrelor in a specific neonatal population, providing information on 
this study in  the labelling is clinically relevant, which is endorsed.  
In this context, the  Applicant has made two proposals for the SmPC, which are partly accepted: 
- The proposed addition to section 4.2 is not acceptable. Considering that  the results of this  study do 
not fall in the  authorised indication,  specific information on this study in section 4.2  is not acceptable. 
In line with  the SmPC guideline, a more general wording in section 4.2 is requested as follows: 
“Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of cangrelor in children aged less than 18  years has not yet been established. 
No data are available. Currently available  data  are described in section 5.1 and 5.2 but no 
recommendation on a  posology can be made. 
Outside its authorised indication, Cangrelor has been studied in a Phase 1 study in neonates ≤ 28 days 
of life with congenital heart disease requiring palliation with  a systemic-to-pulmonary artery shunt, a 
right ventricle-to-pulmonary artery shunt, or a ductus arteriosus stent.  The results of this  study with 
PK-PD data in the neonatal population are described in sections 5.1  and 5.2.” 
- The proposed addition in section 5.1 is acceptable 
Issue not solved  
Question 3 
The PK data are considered sufficiently clear to  support an update of the SmPC. The Applicant is asked 
to update SmPC section 5.2: 
Paediatric population:   
Cangrelor infusion has been evaluated in  neonatal patients  (age from birth to 28  days) at a dose level 
of 0.25 and 0.5 μg/kg/min.The  maximum concentrations were 19 ng/mL  and 60ng/mL,  respectively, 
and were observed approximately 45 minutes following start of infusion. In neonates, cangrelor is 
rapidly metabolised into its primary metabolite AR-C69712XX. Very low or non-detectable levels of 
cangrelor were found 5 minutes  post-infusion and relatively high levels of the primary metabolite were 
detected. 
Applicant comments: 
The Applicant agrees on the  inclusion of the  proposed wording in section 5.2 of the SmPC.

Nevertheless, we suggest to state 5-10  minutes (instead of 5 minutes) as post-infusion period since 
blood withdrawals for the earliest post-infusion assessments were carried out at 70 min,  i.e. 10 
minutes post-infusion,  for cohort 1 of patients receiving the 0.5  μg/kg/min (please, refer to Table 4 on 
page 35  of the  study CSR).  
“Paediatric population:   
Cangrelor infusion has been evaluated in  neonatal patients  (age from birth to 28  days) at a dose level 
of 0.25 and 0.5 μg/kg/min.  The maximum concentrations were 19 ng/mL  and 60  ng/mL, respectively, 
and were observed approximately 45 minutes following start of infusion. In neonates, cangrelor is 
rapidly metabolised into its primary metabolite AR-C69712XX. Very low or non-detectable levels of 
cangrelor were found 5-10  minutes post-infusion and relatively high levels of the primary metabolite 
were detected.”  
In this respect, an annotated version of the  combined PI, including the additional wording,  is attached 
to the present response document (Annex 1).

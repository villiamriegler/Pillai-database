Extension of Indication for Trumenba to include active immunisation of children 1-9 years old. Sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are updated in parallel based on the results from the two pivotal 
studies B1971017 and B1971035. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. The RMP version 2.0 has 
also been submitted. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to submit a corrected version 
of the final report of study B1971016, which was included in the initial marketing authorisation 
application. 
The variation requested amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet and 
to the Risk Management Plan (RMP).  
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included (an) EMA Decision(s) 
P/0013/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP EMEA-001037-PIP-11 was not yet completed as 
some measures were deferred.  
Completion of study B1971035, which is a randomized, controlled, observer-blind trial to describe 
immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of meningococcal bivalent serogroup B (rLP2086) vaccine for 
healthy toddlers aged 12 to less than 24 months, is deferred until July 2021. 
Furthermore, initiation and completion of study B1971053, which is a dose-finding study to describe the 
immunogenicity, safety and tolerability of rLP2086 vaccine in healthy infants 2 months of age, is deferred 
to respectively July 2020 (initiation) and March 2023 (completion).  
A waiver was granted for infants from birth to less than 2 months of age based on the grounds that the 
specific medicinal product is likely to be unsafe and ineffective in this age group.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Main studies 
The application is based on two clinical studies B1971017 and B1971035.  
Study B1971035 is newly submitted, Phase 2, randomized, active-controlled, observer-blinded (sponsor 
unblinded) multicentre study in children 12 to <24 months of age. This study contains two stages: stage 
1, which evaluates the primary vaccination and stage 2, which assesses the duration of the immune 
response and the response to a booster dose. The first stage of the study was designed to assess the 
immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of bivalent rLP2086 when administered as a 3-dose primary 
series at Months 0, 2, and 6. Children in the control group received two doses of hepatitis A vaccine and 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 7/59 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
one dose of saline in order to maintain the blind. The study was conducted between August 2015 and 
August 2017 at 26 centres in four countries (Australia, Czech Republic, Finland and Poland) in accordance 
with GCP.  
Only data from stage 1 are contained within the current submission. The MAH intends to submit the 
persistence and booster data from stage 2 of this study in the third quarter of 2020. 
B1971017 is a Phase 2, randomized, controlled, observer-blinded study to describe the immunogenicity, 
safety, and tolerability of bivalent rLP2086 in healthy subjects aged ≥24 months to <10 years. This study 
has been assessed within context of an Art 46 submission, that assessment is included in this current AR 
and issues relevant for the extension of indication will be highlighted.  
Study B1971035 
Methods 
Overall Study Plan 
The study design is depicted in figure 1 below. 
Stage 1 consists of the primary vaccination stage and includes a sentinel enrolment phase in which a half 
dose of the vaccine (60 μg) was used evaluated in two cohorts including children aged 12 to <15 months 
and 18 to <24 months of age before moving to a full dose of the vaccine (120 μg) in the same age cohorts. 
Once  the  safety  was  established  in  this  sentinel  enrolment  phase,  the  expanded-enrolment  phase  was 
started which evaluated the 120 μg dose in children aged 12 to <18 months of age and 18 to <24 months 
of  age.  Selection  of  dose  level  for  the  expanded-enrolment  phase  was  based  on  an  internal  review 
committee (IRC) review of the safety profile of the 2 dose levels.   
The current submission includes data from Stage 1 of the study. Subjects participated in Stage 1 of the 
study for up to 18 months. For immunogenicity, all data through 1 month after Vaccination 3 (Visit 7) are 
presented with the exception of secondary MnB test strain data supporting an exploratory objective. For 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 8/59 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
safety, all data through 6 months after Vaccination 3 (Visit 8) are presented. Immunogenicity results from 
blood draws performed beyond 1 month after the third dose are not included. 
Study participants 
Children in the ages of 12-<15 months or 18-<25 months could be enrolled in the sentinel cohort, 
children aged 12-<24 months could be enrolled in the expanded drug cohort. 
Exclusion criteria included previous vaccination with MnB or HAV vaccine, contraindications to HAV 
vaccine, conditions associated with prolonged bleeding time that would contraindicate intramuscular 
injection, forms of immune suppression, history of N. meningitidis or gonorrhoeae, significant neurological 
disorders or neuroinflammatory conditions, a history of seizures, a previous anaphylactic reaction to any 
vaccine or vaccine-related component, chronic use of antibiotics, receipt of blood products. Furthermore, 
in and exclusion criteria common for vaccine trials in children were in place. 
Objectives 
Primary Immunogenicity Objectives 
• 
To  describe  the  immune  response  as  measured  by  hSBA  performed  with  4  primary  MnB  strains,  2 
expressing an LP2086 subfamily A protein and 2 expressing an LP2086 subfamily B protein, measured 
1 month after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086, in healthy toddlers aged 12 to <18 months 
at study entry. 
• 
To  describe  the  immune  response  as  measured  by  hSBA  performed  with  4  primary  MnB  strains,  2 
expressing an LP2086 subfamily A protein and 2 expressing an LP2086 subfamily B protein, measured 
1 month after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086, in healthy toddlers aged 18 to <24 months 
at study entry. 
Primary Safety Objective 
• 
To  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  bivalent  rLP2086  compared  to  a  control  (hepatitis  A  virus  [HAV] 
vaccine),  as  measured  by  local  reactions,  systemic  events,  adverse  events  (AEs),  serious  adverse 
events  (SAEs),  newly  diagnosed  chronic  medical  conditions  (NDCMCs),  medically  attended  events 
(MAEs),  and  immediate  AEs  in  healthy  toddlers  12 to  <18  months  and  18  to  <24  months of  age  at 
study entry, and in both age strata combined. 
Secondary objectives 
These  included  the  measurement  of  the  immune  response  as  measured  by  hSBA  for  both  age  strata 
combined, as well as the immune response hSBA at different time points (6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months 
after the third vaccination and one month after the second vaccination). 
Exploratory objectives included aimed at further describing the immune response at different timepoints in 
both  age  strata  and  strata  combined  against  the  four  primary  MnB  strains  and  against  secondary  MnB 
strains. 
Treatments 
Bivalent rLP2086 (60 μg or 120 μg) was administered as an intramuscular injection into either the deltoid 
muscle or anterolateral thigh muscle 3 times over the course of the study: the first vaccination at Visit 1 
(Month 0), second vaccination at Visit 4 (Month 2), and third vaccination at Visit 6 (Month 6).  
HAV vaccine (at Months 0 and 6) was chosen as the control in this study. In comparison to other 
recommended vaccines for this age group, HAV vaccine has a better tolerability profile. In addition, HAV 
vaccine confers a benefit to subjects who might be at increased risk for hepatitis A viral infection either 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 9/59 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
during future travel or during other exposures. The generally recommended regimen for HAV vaccine is 2 
doses at Months 0 and 6. In this study, saline was given at Month 2 to maintain the study blind. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary immunogenicity endpoints were: 
• 
Proportions of subjects achieving an hSBA titre ≥ lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) 1 month after the 
third vaccination, for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains in healthy toddlers 12 to <18 months of 
age at study entry. 
• 
Proportions of subjects achieving an hSBA titre ≥LLOQ 1 month after the third vaccination, for each of 
the 4 primary MnB test strains in healthy toddlers 18 to <24 months of age at study entry. 
Secondary immunogenicity endpoints 
(note, only immunogenicity endpoints applicable to Visits 1 to 7 (Vaccination 1 to 3 months after 
Vaccination 3) are available at this time) 
For both age strata combined: 
• 
Proportion of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ LLOQ for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains 1 
month after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086. 
For both age strata separately and in both age strata combined: 
• 
• 
• 
Proportions of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ LLOQ for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains at 1 
month after the second vaccination with bivalent rLP2086 and 6, 12, 24, 36, and 48 months after 
the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086. 
Proportions of subjects with hSBA titres ≥LLOQ, ≥1:4, ≥1:8, ≥1:16, ≥1:32, ≥1:64, and ≥1:128 
for each of the 4 primary MnB strains at each applicable blood sampling visit. 
hSBA geometric mean titres (GMTs) for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains at each applicable 
blood sampling visit. 
In addition there were several exploratory endpoints, including proportions with hSBA ≥ different cut-off 
values and GMTs at each blood sampling visit, proportions with a four fold increase, response by baseline 
titre (< or ≥ Limit of Detection (LOD)), and response for those who had the response against all four 
primary strains tested as well as those with responses against secondary strains measured. 
Laboratory assays and time-points 
Blood draws for endpoints included in this submission were performed:  
•  Before Vaccination 1 (Visit 1); 
•  One (1) month after Vaccination 2 (Visit 5); 
•  One (1) month after Vaccination 3 (Visit 7); 
Note that there will be a follow up of the immune response up to four years after primary vaccination. 
Four (4) primary MnB test strains, PMB80 (A22), PMB2001 (A56), PMB2948 (B24), and PMB2707 (B44), 
each expressing a factor H binding protein (fHBP) variant heterologous to the vaccine component 
antigens, were used in the hSBAs for determination of the immunogenicity endpoints in this study.  
The LLOQ was 1:16 for PMB80 (A22), 1:8 for PMB2001 (A56), 1:8 for PMB2707 (B44), and 1:8 for 
PMB2948 (B24). For the calculation of GMTs, hSBA results below the LLOQ were set to 0.5 × LLOQ for the 
primary analysis. 
Once all subjects completed enrolment (Visit 1), the independent statistical centre (ISC), a statistical 
team not involved in the conduct of the study, provided 2 subject listings (randomly selected, 50% of 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 10/59 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
subjects to be tested for PMB80 [A22]/PMB2948 [B24] and the remaining 50% of subjects to be tested 
for PMB2001 [A56]/PMB2707 [B44]) to the sponsor’s sample management team. Both listings followed 
the same randomization ratio (2:1) and age-strata distribution as in the study design. The same strain 
pair (PMB80 [A22]/PMB2948 [B24] or PMB2001 [A56]/PMB2707 [B44]) was tested across all visits for the 
same subjects. 
Once  testing  for  the  primary  analyses  was  completed,  and  if  sufficient  volume  of  sera  was  available, 
additional testing to assess the immune response to bivalent rLP2086 could be considered as follows: PMB80 
(A22) and PMB2948 (B24) could be tested in serum samples from the 50% of subjects who received bivalent 
rLP2086  and  whose  serum  samples  were  originally  tested  for  PMB2001  (A56)  and  PMB2707  (B44). 
Conversely, PMB2001 (A56) and PMB2707 (B44) could be tested in serum samples from the 50% of subjects 
who received bivalent rLP2086 and were originally tested for PMB80 (A22) and PMB2948 (B24). Testing for 
secondary  strains  could  be  performed.  None  of  these  additional  assays  were  performed  for  this  primary 
analysis CSR. 
Sample size 
Approximately 396 subjects were planned to be enrolled in this study. The study sample size was not 
based on hypothesis testing. However, using a 1-sided exact test for 1-sample binomial population, with 
an alpha level of 5% (2-sided), with a true response rate of 65%, 88 evaluable subjects could provide 
about 80% power to detect at least a 50% response rate for 1 strain. Under the same conditions, 176 
subjects could provide about 98% power to detect at least a 50% response rate for 1 strain. Assuming 
that 20% of subjects are not evaluable, about 88 or 176 subjects would be available for immunogenicity 
analysis if 110 or 220 subjects were enrolled in the selected dose/age stratum. 
Randomisation 
396 healthy toddlers stratified by age, 12 to <18 months or 18 to <24 months old, were randomly 
assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive bivalent rLP2086 (either of 2 dose levels [60 μg or 120 μg]) or a 
licensed paediatric HAV vaccine (0.5 mL)/sterile saline solution for injection (0.5-mL of 0.85% sodium 
chloride). 
Allocation of subjects to vaccine groups was through an interactive response technology system.  
Blinding (masking) 
The study was observer blinded. All immunogenicity assays were performed by blinded laboratory staff. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
The primary analyses of immunogenicity were based on the defined evaluable immunogenicity population. 
To be included in the evaluable immunogenicity population, subjects had to meet all the following criteria:

The modified Intent-to-Treat Population (mITT) included all randomized subjects who had at least 1 valid 
and determinate assay result related to a proposed analysis. 
The  safety  population  was  used  for  all  safety  analyses.  The  safety  population  included  all  subjects  who 
received at least 1 dose of an investigational product (bivalent rLP2086, HAV vaccine, or saline) and for 
whom  safety  data  were  available.  For  the  safety  analysis,  subjects  were  analysed  according  to  the 
investigational product received. 
Analysis 
This was not a hypothesis-testing study; thus, an estimation approach was used to assess the primary, 
secondary, and exploratory objectives in this study. 
Analysis of Primary Endpoints 
The primary analysis for the primary objectives was the proportion of subjects with an hSBA titre ≥LLOQ 1 
month after the third vaccination, for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains in healthy toddlers aged 12 to 
<18 months, and 18 to <24 months, at study entry respectively. The evaluable immunogenicity population 
was used for this summary and both percentages and confidence intervals (CIs) are displayed. 
Analysis of Secondary Endpoints 
All of the analyses performed on the mITT population were considered as secondary analyses. 
Analyses for secondary endpoints also included percent of subjects with hSBA titres ≥ LLOQ for each of the 
4 primary MnB test strains 1 month following the third vaccination for both the evaluable immunogenicity 
population and for the mITT population.  
Assessing Missing hSBA With Other Variables 
All of the subjects, for the combined age strata, were dichotomized to 2 categories: missing hSBA or non-
missing hSBA. If a subject was missing data at any blood sampling visit up to 1 month after Vaccination 3 
(Month 7) for any of the 2 selected strains, the subject was categorized as ‘Missing (1)’; if the subject 
had hSBA results for all blood sampling visits up to 1 month after Vaccination 3 (Month 7) for the 2 
selected primary strains, the subject was categorized as ‘Nonmissing (0)’. Summary statistics were 
provided for the following variables by the missing indicator: age, sex, centre, vaccine group, and GMT 
for each strain for each group at each visit. 
A mixed-effect model with repeated measurement will be utilized to assess the effect of race, centre and 
gender, in which both baseline and the post-vaccination titres up until Month 7 (in logarithmic scale) are 
modelled as dependent variables for each primary strain.  
This model is using maximum likelihood estimation; therefore, it also serves as a sensitivity analyses on 
missing data for the GMT. To account for the intra-subject correlation among the repeated measures, an 
unstructured covariance matrix will be used. In case the model does not converge, further covariance 
structures will be explored (ie, First-order autoregressive, compound symmetry). If only 50% of the 
subjects will have 2 strains tested and the remaining 50% have the other 2 strains tested, no sensitivity 
analyses will be planned because the missing assumption is MCAR. 
Log (hSBA) = Group + race + gender + age at randomization +visit+ Group* visit. The intercept will be 
set as random effect. In addition to Type III analysis output, least squares GMTs at each visit will be 
summarized for each strain. These analyses will only be applied to subjects in the combined age strata in 
the mITT population, using ½ LLOQ to impute the hSBA values below LLOQ, for the primary strains only. 
If only 50% of the subjects will have 2 strains tested and the remaining 50% have the other 2 strains 
tested, no sensitivity analyses will be planned because the missing assumption is MCAR.

Results 
Participant flow 
In total, 396 subjects 12 to <24 months of age were randomized in this study. Of the subjects 
randomized, a total of 44 subjects received 60 μg of bivalent rLP2086, 220 subjects received 120 μg of 
bivalent rLP2086, and 132 subjects received HAV vaccine/saline. 
Of the 396 subjects randomised, 385 subjects (97.2%) completed the vaccination phase and 348 
(87.9%) were included in the primary evaluable immunogenicity population. Most of the exclusions were 
due to missing scheduled prevaccination or postvaccination blood drawn (31, 7.8%), due to receiving 
prohibited vaccines or treatment (16, 4.0%), or due to lack of adherence to the vaccination (11, 2.8%) or 
not being eligible for the study (13, 3.3%). 
Recruitment 
The first subject was enrolled 31 August 2015 and the last study visit was on 21 August 2017. 
Most (152) of the 396 subjects were enrolled in Poland followed by 118 in Australia, 100 in Czech Republic 
and in 26 in Finland. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 2 amendments to the original protocol dated 16 June 2014 (03 February 2015, 19 April 2016).  
Baseline data 
The mean age of the subjects in the primary evaluable immunogenicity population was 17.3 months 
(range 12 to 23 months; median 17.5 months) with an equal balance male/female.

Numbers analysed 
Of the 396 subjects randomised, 385 subjects (97.2%) completed the vaccination phase and 348 
(87.9%) were included in the primary evaluable immunogenicity population. Forty-eight (12.1%) subjects 
were excluded from the evaluable immunogenicity population. Most of the exclusions were due to missing 
scheduled prevaccination or postvaccination blood drawn (31, 7.8%), due to receiving prohibited vaccines 
or treatment (16, 4.0%), or due to lack of adherence to the vaccination (11, 2.8%) or not being eligible 
for the study (13, 3.3%). 
The modified Intent-to-Treat Population included 396 randomized subjects. The safety population 
included all 396 randomised persons.

The proportion of subjects in the HAV/saline group achieving an hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ did not change over 
time compared to baseline and varied from 0 to 3 (5%) subjects per stratum (data not shown in this AR). 
Results for the mITT population were similar to those of the evaluable immunogenicity population (data 
not shown in this AR).  
Subgroup analyses of the proportion of subjects achieving an hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ for each of the 4 primary 
MnB test strains are presented for the evaluable immunogenicity population by sex and country. There 
were no clinically important differences observed in the subgroup analyses performed.

Study B1971017 
Methods 
Overall Study Plan 
This was a Phase 2, randomized, controlled, observer-blinded, multicentre study designed to assess the 
immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of bivalent rLP2086 at the 120-μg dose level administered to 
healthy subjects aged ≥24 months to <10 years as part of a Month 0, 2, and 6 schedule. See table 7 
below for details. 
Table 7. 
Study design 
Study participants 
Subjects were eligible to enter the study if they were healthy subjects aged ≥24 months and <10 years 
at the time of randomization and complied to the standard inclusion criteria in vaccine trials.   
In addition to standard exclusion criteria, subjects presenting with any of the following were ineligible to 
be included in the study: 
•  Previous vaccination with any meningococcal serogroup B vaccine or HAV vaccination.  
•  Subjects who were receiving any allergen immunotherapy with an unlicensed product or subjects who 
were receiving allergen immunotherapy with a licensed product and who were not on stable maintenance 
doses. 
•  A known or suspected defect of the immune system that would have prevented an immune response to 
the vaccine, such as subjects with congenital or acquired defects in B-cell function, those receiving 
chronic systemic (oral, intravenous, or intramuscular) corticosteroid therapy, or those receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy. Subjects with terminal complement deficiency could be included.  
•  History of microbiologically proven disease caused by N meningitidis or Neisseria gonorrhoeae. 
•  Significant neurological disorder or history of seizure (excluding simple febrile seizure). 
•  Any neuroinflammatory or autoimmune condition, including but not limited to transverse myelitis, uveitis, 
optic neuritis, and multiple sclerosis. 
•  Receipt of any blood products, including immunoglobulin (Ig), within 6 months before the first study 
vaccination. 
•  Current chronic use of systemic antibiotics.

Objectives 
Primary Immunogenicity Objectives: 
• 
• 
To describe the immune response as measured by serum bactericidal assay using human complement 
(hSBA) performed with 4 primary Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B (MnB) test strains, 2 expressing 
an LP2086 subfamily A protein and 2 expressing an LP2086 subfamily B protein, measured 1 month 
after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086, in healthy subjects aged ≥24 months to <4 years 
at study entry.  
To describe the immune response as measured by hSBA performed with 4 primary MnB test strains, 2 
expressing an LP2086 subfamily A protein and 2 expressing an LP2086 subfamily B protein, measured 
1 month after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086, in healthy subjects aged ≥4 years to <10 
years at study entry.  
Primary Safety Objective: To evaluate the safety profile of bivalent rLP2086 compared to a control 
(hepatitis A virus [HAV] vaccine). 
Secondary Objectives: 
• 
• 
To describe the immune response as measured by hSBA performed with 4 primary MnB test strains, 2 
expressing an LP2086 subfamily A protein and 2 expressing an LP2086 subfamily B protein, measured 
1 month after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086, in healthy subjects aged ≥24 months to 
<10 years at study entry (ie, in the combined age stratum). 
To describe the immune response as measured by hSBA performed with 4 primary MnB test strains, 2 
expressing an LP2086 subfamily A protein and 2 expressing an LP2086 subfamily B protein, measured 
1 month after the second vaccination and 6 months after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086, 
in healthy subjects aged ≥24 months to <4 years at study entry, in healthy subjects aged ≥4 years to 
<10 years at study entry, and in the combined age stratum. 
Exploratory Objectives: The immune response was further described through additional endpoints, as 
measured by hSBA performed with 4 primary MnB test strains, 2 expressing an LP2086 subfamily A 
protein and 2 expressing an LP2086 subfamily B protein, at specified time points, in healthy subjects 
aged ≥24 months to <4 years at study entry, in healthy subjects aged ≥4 years to <10 years at study 
entry, and in the combined age stratum. 
Treatments 
Subjects in Group 1 were administered bivalent rLP2086 by intramuscular injection into the upper deltoid 
muscle of the arm at Months 0, 2, and 6. Subjects in Group 2 were administered HAV vaccine/saline/HAV 
vaccine into the upper deltoid muscle of the arm at Months 0, 2, and 6, respectively. 
HAV vaccine administered at Months 0 and 6 was chosen as the control in this study so that subjects 
randomized to the control group would receive a direct benefit from participating in the study, as the HAV 
vaccine is not a required immunization in either Poland or Finland and most subjects would therefore not 
have received it prior to enrolment. HAV vaccine has a well-established safety and tolerability profile and 
provides protection to subjects who may become at increased risk for hepatitis A infection either during 
travel or other exposures. The generally recommended regimen by the US CDC and the European CDC for 
HAV vaccine is 2 doses at Months 0 and 6. In this study, saline was given at Month 2 to maintain the 
study blind.

Outcomes/endpoints 
For the primary analyses, 2 of the primary test strains (PMB80 [A22] and PMB2948 [B24]) were tested at 
each blood sampling time point for half of the subjects (in both groups), and the other 2 primary test 
strains (PMB2001 [A56] and PMB2707 [B44]) were tested at each blood sampling time point for the 
remaining half of the subjects. 
The primary immunogenicity endpoints were: 
• 
• 
Proportion of subjects aged ≥24 months to <4 years (at study entry) with hSBA titre ≥ lower limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ)1 for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains 1 month after the third vaccination 
with bivalent rLP2086. 
Proportion of subjects aged ≥4 years to <10 years (at study entry) with hSBA titre ≥LLOQ for each of 
the 4 primary MnB test strains 1 month after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086. 
The secondary immunogenicity endpoints were: 
• 
• 
In healthy subjects aged ≥24 months to <10 years at study entry: 
o 
Proportion of subjects with hSBA titre ≥LLOQ for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains 1 month 
after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086. 
In healthy subjects aged ≥24 months to <4 years at study entry, in healthy subjects aged ≥4 years 
to <10 years at study entry, and in the combined age stratum: 
o 
o

Proportion of subjects with hSBA titre ≥LLOQ for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains 1 month 
after the second vaccination and 1 and 6 months after the third vaccination with bivalent 
rLP2086. 
hSBA GMTs for each of the 4 primary test strains at baseline, 1 month after the second 
vaccination, and 1 and 6 months after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086.  
Proportions of subjects achieving hSBA titres of ≥1:4, ≥1:8, ≥1:16, ≥1:32, ≥1:64, and ≥1:128 
for each of the 4 primary test strains at baseline, 1 month after the second vaccination, and 1 
and 6 months after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086. 
Sample size 
The study sample size was not based on hypothesis-testing criteria. Approximately 400 subjects were 
planned to be randomly assigned to one of the two groups in a 3:1 ratio. 
Randomisation 
Randomisation was stratified according to age to ensure that equal numbers of subjects were included in 
the ≥24-month to <4-year age stratum and the ≥4-year to <10-year age stratum. 
Allocation of subjects to vaccine groups proceeded through the use of an interactive response technology 
(IRT) system that was accessible 24 hours a day, 365 days a year. Having logged in, the site personnel 
(study coordinator or specified designee) were required to enter or select certain information including, 
but not limited to, the user’s identification (ID). 
1 The LLOQ was 1:16 for PMB80 (A22), 1:8 for PMB2001 (A56), 1:8 for PMB2707 (B44), and 1:8 for PMB2948 (B24).

Blinding (masking) 
The study was observer blinded. 
Statistical methods 
There were no hypotheses testing for immunogenicity analysis. An estimation approach was used to 
assess the primary, secondary, and exploratory objectives. All of the binary endpoints (including primary 
endpoints) were summarized with 2-sided 95% CIs using the exact method. Geometric mean titre (GMTs) 
on hSBA results were also summarized with 95% CIs. 
The following analysis populations were defined: 
 (primary analysis population) included all subjects who were: 
1.  Randomized into the study; 
2.  Were eligible, ie, satisfied all inclusion/exclusion criteria, through 1 month after Vaccination 3; 
3.  Received all the scheduled investigational products at Visits 1, 3, and 5 as randomized; 
4.  Had baseline blood drawn prior to the first dose of vaccine and had the post-Vaccination 3 blood draw 
(Visit 6) within 28 to 42 days after Vaccination 3 (Visit 5). The interval day was calculated as the 
blood draw date minus the vaccination date; 
5.  Had valid and determinate assay results for the proposed analysis; and 
6.  Had no important protocol deviations 
•  Modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population: All randomized subjects who had at least 1 valid and 
determinate assay result related to a proposed analysis 
•  Safety population: All subjects who received at least 1 dose of the investigational product (bivalent 
rLP2086, HAV vaccine, or saline) and with safety data available were included in the safety 
population. 
Subgroup Analyses 
The following immunogenicity and safety endpoints were descriptively summarized by race (white, black, 
Asian, and other), by sex (male, female), and by country: 
• 
Proportion of subjects with hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains at each time 
point, 
•  GMTs for each of the 4 primary MnB test strains at each time point, 
• 
Primary safety endpoints related to reactogenicity, AEs, SAEs, and MAEs. 
For the calculation of GMTs, hSBA results below the LLOQ were set as 0.5 × LLOQ for the primary 
analysis. Additionally, a sensitivity analysis using a mixed-effects model with repeated measures (MMRM) 
could have been applied to the primary endpoints. The MMRM was to use the maximum likelihood 
estimation, and it was under the assumption that the data were missing at random (MAR). As <50% of 
the subjects had 2 strains tested and the remaining subjects had the other 2 strains tested, no sensitivity 
analyses were performed, as per Section 7.1 of the SAP (Section 16.1.9).

Baseline data 
Overall, 52% of subjects were female, and the majority of the subjects were white (98.8%) and non-
Hispanic/non-Latino (100.0%). The mean age (SD) at first vaccination was 4.3 (2.21) years (range of 2 
to 9 years). Demographic characteristics were similar between groups and age strata. See table 9 below. 
Table 9. 
Demographic characteristics – evaluable immunogenicity population 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 400 subjects aged ≥24 months to <10 years were randomized in this study. Of the subjects 
randomized, 294 subjects were in Group 1 (bivalent rLP2086) and 106 subjects were in Group 2 
(HAV/saline). There were 200 subjects randomized in each of the ≥24-month to <4-year and ≥4-year to 
<10-year age strata. 
Overall, a total of 375 (93.8%) subjects completed all study procedures and completion was similar in 
each age strata. A total of 371 (92.8%) subjects were included in the evaluable immunogenicity 
population, and 29 (7.3%) subjects were excluded from the evaluable immunogenicity population. All 400 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 24/59 
 
 
  
  
  
 
randomized subjects were included in the mITT population. Subjects could have been excluded from the 
immunogenicity populations for more than 1 reason. A total of 21 (5.3%) subjects were excluded from 
the evaluable immunogenicity population because they did not have baseline blood drawn prior to the 
first dose of vaccine or after Vaccination 3, 15 (3.8%) subjects did not have a valid and determinate 
assay result at any visit, 11 (2.8%) subjects were not eligible or became ineligible for the study before or 
at the 1-month post-Vaccination 3 visit, 11 (2.8%) subjects did not receive vaccine as randomized at all 
vaccination visits, and 4 (1.0%) subjects had an important protocol deviation as identified by the medical 
monitor. Overall, the 2 study groups and 2 age strata were comparable with respect to the percentages of 
subjects who were excluded from the evaluable immunogenicity population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary and Secondary Endpoints

Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The MAH submitted two phase II in children aged 1 to 9 years which were agreed in the Paediatric 
Investigation Plan. Study B1971035 is a Phase 2, randomized, active-controlled, observer-blinded, 
multicentre study to assess the immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of bivalent rLP2086 when 
administered as a 3-dose primary series to healthy children 12 to <24 months of age. B1971017 was a 
Phase 2, randomized, controlled, observer-blinded, multicentre study designed to assess the 
immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of bivalent rLP2086 at the 120-μg dose level administered to 
healthy subjects aged ≥24 months to <10 years as part of a Month 0, 2, and 6 schedule. Both studies 
were descriptive in nature. Studies were adequately designed and well conducted.  
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Immunogenicity results from these Phase 2 studies of a 3-dose regimen (0-, 2-, and 6-month schedule) 
of 120 μg bivalent rLP2086 given to toddlers and children aged ≥12 months to <10 years are consistent 
with previous studies in adolescents and young adults.  
Response in children ≥12 - <24 months 
In children aged 12 to <24 months of age, of subjects achieving an hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ for each of the 4 
primary MnB test strains 1 month after the third vaccination ranged from 85.0% to 100.0% for the 60-μg 
group and from 71.6% to 100.0% for the 120-μg group. Responses were similar for the two age groups 
(12-18 months and 18-24 months). These findings are further supported secondary endpoints including 
increases in GMTs.  
The MAH concludes 3 doses of either 60 μg or 120 μg of bivalent rLP2086 administered on a 0-, 2-, 6-
month schedule, induced robust immune responses in toddlers 12 to <24 months of age. This is agreed.  
Half dose for children ≥12 - <24 months 
Interestingly, although numbers were small, there was no marked benefit of the 120 μg dose compared 
to the 60μg dose. Conversely, for some timepoints, strains, and age strata there was a clear benefit of 
the 60 μg dose over the 120 μg dose. For example, the response against strain B24 one month after the 
second dose in children aged 12-18 months was 70% for the 60 μg compared to 24% for the 120 μg 
group. This was not seen in the older age strata (18-24 months), where the rates were 44% vs 43% 
respectively. Moreover, one month after the third dose there was no marked difference in response (% 
>LLOQ) or GMTs. Considering the small numbers, differences might be due to chance. However, as there 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 34/59 
 
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
is no clear benefit of the 120 μg over the 60 μg the CHMP recommended the MAH to further explore the 
60μg dose formulation in children <2 years. The MAH clarified that they have no further plans to evaluate 
the 60μg dose in children aged ≥12 to <24 months but are however planning to further evaluate this 
reduced dose in infants. 
Response in children ≥24 months - <10 years 
In children aged ≥24 months to <10 years, 1 month after the third dose of bivalent rLP2086 the 
proportion of subjects achieving an hSBA titre ≥LLOQ (1:8 for A56, B24 and B44; 1:16 for A22) for each 
of the 4 primary MnB test strains ranged from 80.0% to 100.0% for subjects aged ≥24 months to <4 
years and from 78.3% to 100.0% for subjects ≥4 years to <10 years after 3 doses. These findings are 
further supported secondary endpoints including increases in GMTs.  
Response in children ≥1 – <10 years in relation to response in adolescents 
Considering the hSBA >1:8, which is slightly more conservative than the presumptive correlate for 
protection, there is no consistent effect of age on the response to vaccination. In children aged ≥12 
months to <24 months the response varied from 71.6% to 100.0% dependent on strain, compared to 
80.0% to 100.0% in children aged ≥24 months to <4 years, 78.3% to 100.0% in those ≥4 to <10 years 
and 86.1% to 99.3% in those aged ≥10 to <18 years of age. There is no clear and consistent effect of 
age for subjects ≥24 months of age. Broadly, the response one month after primary vaccination is similar 
in children aged ≥24 months to <10 years of age as compared to adolescents and is slightly lower in 
children aged ≥12 months to <24 months of age.  
Persistence of response: durability of protection 
The low hSBA titres 6 months after Vaccination 3 seen in study B1971017 suggest a steep decline in 
protection for strains A22, B24 and B44 following primary vaccination in children aged 2 to 10 years. The 
proportion of subjects achieving an hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ declined from a range of 87.4% , 88.9% and 
79.1%1 month after Vaccination 3 to 32.5%, 15.5% and 10.4% 6 months after Vaccination 3 for 
strains A22, B24 and B44 respectively.  For strain A56 persistence was better, with the proportion of 
subjects achieving an hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ declining from 100% to 82.4% over the same period. There is 
no persistence data in younger children, aged ≥12 months to <2 years, and it can only be speculated 
that the persistence in these youngest age group will be worse.  
These data show that a substantial proportion (70-90%) of vaccinated children aged ≥2 to <10 years 
could be unprotected within 6 months after completing their primary vaccination schedule against a 
majority of circulating MenB strains. As the decrease in antibody titres was larger in children aged ≥24 
months to <4 years compared to those aged ≥4 years to 10 years, the proportion without protective 
antibody titres 6 months after primary vaccination is expected to be higher in the ≥12 to <24 month old 
age stratum. Therefore, based on the current data it was not possible to conclude on the vaccination in 
children between 1 and 9 years of age as the CHMP was concerned that the proposed vaccination 
schedule would not be adequate to ensure sufficient protection against N. meningitidis group B in children 
of this age group because the level of antibodies declined shortly after vaccination. An additional dose 
seemed to be required to ensure lasting protection, and more data were needed to support such use.  
Results in adolescents (study B1971005) would suggest immune persistence being better in this older age 
group. In study B1971005, where the median age was 14 years, the proportion of subjects achieving an 
hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ declined from 95.3%, 100%, 93.3% and 95.7% one month after the third dose to 
60.2%, 89.4%, 57.1% and 36.7% 6 months after the third dose for strains A22, A56, B24 and B44 
respectively. A similar picture is seen in study B1971012/B1971033, where the mean age was 14.4 years, 
which showed better persistence still at 12 months after the third dose. No 6-month data were available 
for comparison. Potentially higher baseline titres in adolescents contribute to this improved persistence, 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 35/59 
 
 
  
  
  
however there may simply be a better priming response in older children. In any case, a booster dose is 
recommended for adolescents for those who remain at risk of IMD. 
There is no booster data available for children aged ≥ 1 to < 10 years of age. Post-booster response and 
persistence studies are warranted among individuals who received their primary series of bivalent 
rLP2086 as toddlers and children to provide further insights into the utility of a booster dose in providing 
protection against IMD through childhood, adolescence and early adulthood. During the assessment of the 
Art 46 procedure (B1971017) it was concluded that persistence and booster data would be needed for the 
determination of an optimal dosing schedule in toddlers and young children. The MAH stated that they 
intend to submit the persistence and booster data from stage 2 of study B1971035 in the third quarter of 
2020. 
Considering that the posology as was proposed provided only limited benefit as it was of short duration 
for a majority of the strains tested against, the extension of the indication in children under 10 years of 
age was refused. However, the paediatric data related to these studies are included in the SmPC in 
agreement with the Paediatric Regulation. Therefore, the MAH was invited to submit an updated SmPC 
proposal which appropriately reflects the data from the paediatric studies in sections 4.8 and 5.1, as well 
as the statement regarding data in section 4.2 regarding the lack of data in subjects younger than 10 
years, highlighting the limitations of the data. 
2.4.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Based on an hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ for the 4 primary MnB test strains 1 month after Vaccination 3, children 
aged ≥12 months to 10 years had largely similar immune responses compared to adolescents (≥10 years 
to <19 years). A similar picture is seen with other immunogenicity endpoints, albeit based on GMTs the 
response in children aged ≥12 months to <24 months is slightly lower, also as compared to adolescents. 
It can be concluded that bivalent rLP2086 appears to be immunogenic in the ≥12 months to <10 years 
age population and is likely to offer protection against MnB infection similarly to that expected for 
adolescents based on the hSBA correlate of protection one month after the third dose. However, 
considering the rapid decay of antibodies seen in children aged 24 months and older, protection provided 
by the vaccine is expected to be significantly reduced during the first 6 months after primary vaccination. 
This means that protection conferred by the priming doses is insufficient to ensure durable protection, 
and expected benefit from this vaccine at the now proposed dosing regimen (0,2,6 m) is limited for 
children aged ≥12 months to <10 years and therefore a recommendation in this age group was refused. 
However, safety and efficacy findings from the clinical trials in children are being included in the SmPC in 
accordance with the paediatric regulation to especially reflect the persistence data and uncertainties 
around the persistence issue. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The safety profile of Trumenba has been established in children aged 10 years and older, adolescents and 
adults. It is based on analysis of over 15,000 subjects who have been vaccinated with at least 1 dose of 
Trumenba in 11 completed clinical studies. The most common adverse reactions observed were injection 
site pain, redness and swelling at the vaccination site, headache, fatigue, chills, diarrhoea, muscle pain, 
joint pain, and nausea.  
The description of the safety of Trumenba in children aged 12 months to 9 years below is based on the 
summary of safety and integrated analysis of the two clinical studies (B1971017 and B1971035) in 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 36/59 
 
 
  
  
  
support of this application. Further, the MAH refers to safety data collected in adolescents (including 
children aged 10 years and older) as a reference. 
Patient exposure 
The safety dataset for children comprises data derived from the 752 subjects who received 120 µg of 
bivalent rLP2086 or control in the 2 controlled studies (B1971035 and B1971017).  
Subjects aged ≥12-<24 months: 44 subjects received 60 µg of bivalent rLP2086, 220 subjects received 
120 µg of bivalent rLP2086 according to the 0,2,6 month schedule, and 132 subjects received HAV 
vaccine/saline.   
Subjects aged ≥24 months – 10 years:  294 subjects received 120 μg rLP2086 according to the 0,2,6 
month schedule, 106 subjects received HAV/saline.  
Adverse events 
Local reactions 
Subjects aged 12-<24 months 
Overall, tenderness at the injection site was the most commonly reported local reaction for all vaccine 
groups and age strata. Redness at the injection site was the second most commonly reported local 
reaction followed by swelling at the injection site.  
The median onset day for all types of local reactions ranged from 1 to 2 days for all groups. The median 
duration of tenderness at the injection site was 2 days (range of 1 to 9 days) for the 60-μg group, 2 days 
(range of 1 to 9 days) for the 120-μg group, and 1 day (range of 1 to 3 days) for the HAV/saline group 
after all 3 vaccinations. The median duration of redness was 2 days (range of 1 to 8 days) for the 60- μg 
group, 2 days (range of 1 to 11 days) for the 120- μg group, and 1 day (range of 1 to 8 days) for the 
HAV/saline group. The median duration of swelling was between 2 to 3 days (range of 1 to 9 days) for 
subjects in the 60- μg group, 1 day (range of 1 to 15 days) for the 120- μg group, and 1 day (range of 1 
to 2 days) for the HAV/saline group. 
Local reactions were two to three times more common in the 60 μg rLP2086 and 120 μg rLP2086 groups 
compared to the HAV/saline control group. Overall there is no difference in the incidence of local reactions 
between the 60 μg and 120 μg group, however there is a trend for more severe local reactions in the 120 
μg group after all doses. The proportion of subjects reporting potentiation for any local reaction was 0.0% 
to 4.5% and 0.0% to 2.8% for subjects in the 60-μg and 120-μg groups, respectively.

N = number of subjects with known values after the vaccination. n = Number of subjects reporting maximum severity 
of mild, moderate, or severe based on the severity scales. Exact 2-sided CI based upon observed proportion of 
subjects, using the Clopper and Pearson method. 
a. Mild = hurts if gently touched, moderate = hurts if gently touched with crying, severe = causes limitation of limb 
movement. 
b. Mild is 0.5 to 2.0 cm (1 to 4 caliper units), moderate is 2.5 to 7.0 cm (5 to 14 caliper units), and severe is >7.0 cm 
(>14 caliper units). 
c. Any local reaction = any tenderness at injection site, any redness, or any swelling.

Subjects aged ≥24 months to <10 years  
For the combined age stratum, the bivalent rLP2086 group reported more local reactions than those 
subjects receiving HAV/saline. Among bivalent rLP2086 recipients, pain at the injection site (84.4%) was 
the most commonly reported local reaction followed by redness (60.2%) and swelling (46.6%) after any 
vaccination, compared to 33.0%, 17.0% and 9.4% in the HAV/saline group, respectively.  
Table 17.

84.4% 
60.2% 
46.6% 
33.0% 
17.0% 
9.4% 
These differences were similar after each vaccination, regardless of whether the subjects in the 
comparator group received the HAV vaccine (Vaccination 1 and 3) or saline (Vaccination 2).  
The proportion of subjects reporting pain at the injection site was higher in subjects aged ≥4 years to 
<10 years (92.6%) when compared to subjects ≥24 months to <4 years (75.9%). 
Most local reactions were mild or moderate in severity, with ≤7.1% of bivalent rLP2086 recipients 
reporting severe local reactions after any vaccination (compared to 0.0% for HAV/saline recipients). The 
median onset of local reactions after any vaccination was 1 to 2 days after bivalent rLP2086 vaccination 
and lasted a median of 1 to 2 days. The proportion of subjects in both groups with severity increase with 
potentiation for pain at the injection site, redness, and swelling was low, and generally similar between 
subjects in both age strata. After any bivalent rLP2086 vaccination, older children reported more injection 
site pain (92.6%) than their younger counterparts (75.9%).  
Among the combined age stratum, severe local reactions (>14 caliper units) occurred during the study at 
low rates after any bivalent rLP2086 vaccination. There was 1 subject who received HAV/saline and was 
withdrawn from the study because of local reactions (injection site hypersensitivity and injection site 
pruritus). 
Systemic Reactions 
Subjects aged 12-<24 months 
The incidence of systemic events by maximum severity within 7 days after each vaccination and any 
vaccination by investigational product is presented for the combined age stratum (12 to <24 months) in 
Table 16. 
Systemic reactions were more commonly reported in the rLP2086 groups compared to the HAV/saline 
group. There is no clear difference in the rate of systemic reactions between the 60- μg and 120- μg 
group. After the first dose a slightly higher rate in the 120- μg group (75.9% as compared to 70.5% for 
the 60- μg group) reported any systemic reaction, however considering any dose there is no difference 
(85.0% vs 86.4%). Also considering the severity of systemic reactions, there is no clear trend of 
increased severity with the higher dose group. 
The rate of systemic adverse events was lower in children 18 months or older compared to those <18 
months of age. For subjects 12 to <18 months of age, systemic events after any vaccination were 
reported by 95.5% and 89.1% of subjects in the 60-μg and 120-μg groups, respectively compared to 
66.7% of subjects in the HAV/saline group. For subjects 18 to <24 months of age, systemic events after 
any vaccination were reported by 77.3% and 80.9% of subjects in the 60-μg and 120-μg groups, 
respectively compared to 59.1% of subjects in the HAV/saline group.

Fever 
For the combined age stratum (12 to <24 months), fever (≥38°C) after any vaccination was reported by 
36.4% and 37.3% of subjects in the 60- μg and 120- μg groups, respectively compared to 15.2% of 
subjects in the HAV/saline group. The rate of fever in the rLP2086 groups decreased with each dose. 
For subjects 12 to <18 months of age, fever (≥38°C) after any vaccination was reported by 40.9% and 
38.2% of subjects in the 60- μg and 120- μg groups, respectively, compared to 31.8% and 36.4% of 
subjects 18 to <24 months of age.  
Overall one subject (0.5%) in the 120- μg group reported fever >40.0°C.

Subjects ≥24 months to <10 years 
For the combined age stratum, the bivalent rLP2086 group reported higher rates of systemic 
reactogenicity events after any vaccination than subjects receiving HAV/saline. Headache (33.3%) and 
fatigue (59.5%) were the most commonly reported systemic events among recipients of any bivalent 
rLP2086 dose.  
There were substantial differences for fever (24.5% vs 12.3%, respectively), headache (33.3% vs 20.8%, 
respectively), fatigue (59.5% vs 38.7%, respectively), muscle pain (28.2% vs 8.5%, respectively), joint 
pain (14.6% vs 6.6%, respectively), and antipyretic use (51.0% vs 28.3%, respectively) (see table).

Only fever and headache appeared to have differences by age stratum with fever more common in the 
younger age stratum and headache more common in the older age stratum. Fever was more common in 
the children aged ≥24 months to <4 years than children aged ≥4 years to <10 years for both bivalent 
rLP2086 and HAV/saline recipients (30.3% vs 18.8% and 18.2% vs 5.9%, respectively). Headache was 
more common in the children aged ≥4 years to <10 years than children aged ≥24 months to <4 years 
for both bivalent rLP2086 and HAV/saline recipients (45.6% vs 20.7% and 35.3% vs 7.3%, respectively). 
The younger bivalent rLP2086 stratum was more likely to experience vomiting, diarrhea and fatigue than 
the older age stratum. 
Most cases of fever were <39°C, with 6.1% of subjects receiving bivalent rLP2086 and 4.7% of subjects 
receiving HAV/saline reporting fever 38.0°C to <38.5°C, and 6.1% for bivalent rLP2086 1 and 1.9% for 
HAV/saline reporting fever 38.5°C to <39.0°C. Fever >40°C was reported for 1 (0.3%) subject who 
received bivalent rLP2086 but was not reported for any of the subjects receiving HAV/saline. 
Systemic events in the bivalent rLP2086 group were generally mild or moderate in severity, and severe 
systemic events were infrequent (0 to 6.5% after any vaccination). The median onset of systemic events 
after each vaccination was 1 to 3 days after bivalent rLP2086 vaccination and lasted a median of 1 to 4 
days. The severity (potentiation) of systemic reactogenicity did not increase with subsequent dosing for 
subjects aged ≥4 years to <10 years.  Of subjects aged ≥24 months to <4 years, 3.7% reported any 
severity increases with potentiation.

No subject withdrew from the study because of a systemic event. 
Other AEs 
Subjects aged 12-<24 months 
(Non-related) AEs reported by subjects in both age strata and all vaccine groups were consistent with 
those health conditions and illnesses typically observed in the respective age groups in the general 
population, including were upper respiratory tract infection, irritability, bronchitis, gastroenteritis and 
pharyngitis. 
Related AEs 
For subjects 12 to <18 months of age, a total of 0 (0.0%) subjects in the 60-μg group, 13 (11.8%) 
subjects in the 120-μg group, and 3 (4.5%) subjects in the HAV/saline group reported related AEs.  
Related AEs reported in the 120-μg group were pyrexia (5 subjects [4.5%]), diarrhoea (4 subjects 
[3.6%]), irritability (4 subjects [3.6%]), injection site pain (3 subjects [2.7%]), somnolence (2 subjects 
[1.8%]), and chills (2 subjects [1.8%]) and single events of vomiting, postvaccinal irritability, vaccination 
site pain, and decreased appetite.  Related AEs reported in the HAV/saline group were 2 events of 
decreased appetite (1 subject [1.5%]), 2 events of somnolence (1 subject [1.5%]) and single events of 
diarrhoea, postvaccinal irritability, and vaccination site erythema.  
For subjects 18 to <24 months of age, a total of 6 (27.3%) subjects in the 60-μg group, 10 (9.1%) 
subjects in the 120-μg group, and 3 (4.5%) subjects in the HAV/saline group reported related AEs. 
Related AEs reported in the 60-μg group were irritability (3 subjects [13.6%]) and single events of 
injection site erythema, injection site pain, pyrexia, vaccination site pain, and decreased appetite. Related 
AEs reported in the 120-μg group were pyrexia (3 subjects [2.7%]) rash (2 subjects [1.8%]), 2 events of 
irritability (1 subject [0.9%]), and single events of vomiting, chills, injection site bruising, injection site 
nodule, injection site pain, and erythema. Related AEs reported in the HAV/saline group were irritability 
(2 subjects [3.0%]) and single events of crying and vaccination site pain. 
Subjects ≥24 months to <10 years 
For the combined age stratum, the percentages of subjects with AEs occurring within 30 days of each 
vaccination or after any vaccination were similar between bivalent rLP2086 and HAV/saline recipients, 
with overall rates during the vaccination phase of 62.6% and 63.2%, respectively. The rate of AEs 
assessed as related by the investigators was 2.4% vs 0.0% for the bivalent rLP2086 and HAV/saline 
groups in younger children and 2.4% vs 1.9%, respectively in the older age strata. Most AEs were mild or 
moderate in severity and the frequency and severity of AEs did not increase with subsequent 
vaccinations.  
For subjects in the bivalent rLP2086 group, AEs were primarily from the SOC of infections and infestations 
(86 of the 90 subjects reporting AEs in the younger age stratum, and 85 of the 94 subjects reporting AEs 
in the older age stratum), with respiratory infections being the most frequent AEs reported. Two (2) 
subjects in the bivalent rLP2086 group withdrew from the study because of AEs, both of which were 
considered related to investigational product by the investigator. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Other Significant Events 
Subjects aged 12-<24 months 
The proportion of subjects reporting at least 1 MAE within 30 days after any vaccination was 31.8%, 
36.4%, and 35.6% for subjects in the 60-μg, 120-μg, and HAV/saline groups, respectively. The 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 44/59 
 
 
  
  
  
proportion of subjects reporting at least 1 MAE during the vaccination phase was 40.9%, 50.9%, and 
43.2% for subjects in the 60-μg, 120-μg, and HAV/saline groups, respectively. 
For the combined age stratum during the vaccination phase, MAEs deemed related to investigational 
product by investigators were reported by 0.0%, 2.3%, and 0.0% of subjects in the 60-μg, 120-μg, and 
HAV/saline groups, respectively. 
Subjects ≥24 months to <10 years 
Overall, for the combined age stratum, the proportion of subjects with at least 1 Medically Attended Event 
(MAE) occurring throughout the study was 48.6% for the bivalent rLP2086 group and 50.0% for the 
HAV/saline group. Among subjects reporting at least 1 MAE within 30 days after each vaccination or after 
any vaccination during the study, there were only minor differences between those receiving bivalent 
rLP2086 and HAV/saline, and no clinically meaningful differences in the proportion of subjects reporting 
MAEs after each subsequent vaccination. 
During the vaccination phase, the proportions of subjects reporting MAEs were no different between 
children aged ≥24 months to <4 years and children aged ≥4 years to <10 years, and were similar 
between those receiving bivalent rLP2086 and HAV/saline (45.5% vs 40.9% and 41.8% vs 51.0%, 
respectively). This was consistent for MAEs reported throughout the study. Most events were mild or 
moderate after bivalent rLP2086 vaccination. 
Serious adverse events & Deaths 
Subjects aged 12-<24 months 
For the combined age stratum, there was 1 (2.3%) subject in the 60-μg group, 8 (3.6%) subjects in the 
120-μg group, and 4 (3.0%) subjects in the HAV/saline group reporting at least 1 SAE within 30 days 
after any vaccination. Throughout the entire AE collection period, 4 (9.1%) subjects in the 60-μg group, 
19 (8.6%) subjects in the 120-μg group, and 8 (6.1%) subjects in the HAV/saline group reported at least 
1 SAE. None of the SAEs were considered related to vaccine by the investigator what is agreed. 
SAEs during the vaccination phase are presented in the table.  
There were no deaths. 
Subjects ≥24 months to <10 years 
The proportion of subjects in the combined age stratum reporting at least 1 SAE within 30 days of any 
vaccination was similar between bivalent rLP2086 recipients and HAV/saline recipients, 1.0% compared to 
0.9%, respectively. Throughout the study, 5 SAEs (1.7%) were reported in the bivalent rLP2086 group, 4 
during the vaccination phase and 1 during follow-up. One (1) of the SAEs was considered related by the 
investigator - a case of transient hip synovitis in a 2-year-old male subject with onset on Day 1 after 
Vaccination 2.  
One (1) immediate AE was reported during the study - severe injection site pain following Vaccination 3 
with bivalent rLP2086. The injection site pain resolved and did not lead to discontinuation from the study. 
Autoimmune and neuroinflammatory conditions (as defined by a comprehensive list of MedDRA preferred 
terms), deaths, and NDCMCs were not reported in either the bivalent rLP2086 or HAV/saline recipients at 
any time during the study. 
Among subjects from both age strata, those receiving bivalent rLP2086 were more likely to report days of 
missed school because of an AE than the HAV/saline group (23.1% vs 15.1%, respectively). Considering 
days of missed school because of related AEs the rates were 0.3% vs 0.0%, respectively. When school 
was missed, the median number of days missed was 4.5 days versus 4.0 days, respectively. One (1) 
subject in the bivalent rLP2086 group reported missing school (2 days) because of a related AE.

No subjects died during the study. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In children who received 120 μg of bivalent rLP2086, four subjects (0.8%) discontinued due to an 
adverse event. 
Two (1.8%) subjects, both 12 to <18 months of age and in the 120-µg group, were withdrawn for safety-
related reasons during the study period covered in this report.  One subject was withdrawn because of an 
SAE of unrelated, transient (<1 day) eyelid ptosis.  The other subject was withdrawn because of related 
decreased appetite, injection site pain, irritability, and somnolence. 
In children aged 24 months – 10 years, 2 [1.4%] subjects in the bivalent rLP2086 group in the 24 month 
to <4 year age stratum were withdrawn for safety-related reasons for reported AEs that led to 
discontinuation. Both subjects reported synovitis (see above).   
Post marketing experience 
Summary of Post-Marketing Data From the Safety Database: Patients Younger Than 10 Years of Age 
The safety database was searched to identify PM adverse events for patients younger than 10 years of 
age receiving bivalent rLP2086.  The estimated cumulative worldwide unit distribution for bivalent 
rLP2086 from US launch through 23 May 2018 is approximately 2,199,301 doses. Cumulatively a total of 
1645 cases received from spontaneous sources through the cutoff date of 23 May 2018.  Of the cases 
providing patient age, 44 involved children younger than 10.  The majority (39) contained terms 
consistent with off-label use or medication errors but not clinical adverse events.  One of the 5 reports 
reporting associated clinical adverse events was serious.

Cases with No Associated Adverse Events 
Of the total 44 PM cases involving patients younger than 10 years, the majority of patients (39) did not 
experience any clinical adverse events.  These cases can be grouped in 2 subgroups: 
1.  Off-label use 
There were 16 cases reporting off-label use (vaccine administered to patient of inappropriate age) of 
bivalent rLP2086 with no adverse events associated. these cases originated from the US (11), Germany 
(3), Greece, and Portugal (1 each). Of the 16 cases, 9 were infants (ranging from 10 weeks and 18 
months of age); in 1 case a specific age was not provided.   
2.  Medication error 
There were 23 cases  reporting 4 unique PTs indicative of medication errors; more than 1 medication 
error PT was reported in some cases.  There were 17 infants (between 1 and 18 months of age) and other 
6 children (aged between 2 and 9 years).   
Cases Reporting Non-Serious Adverse Events 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 48/59 
 
 
  
  
  
 
 
There were 4 cases (1 off-label and 3 medication error cases) involving patients who developed fever 
following bivalent rLP2086 administration:  
•  One case, from Cyprus, involved an 8-year old female patient who was intentionally administered 
by the physician (off-label use) with bivalent rLP2086 and developed Pyrexia (39°C), Malaise, 
Asthenia, and Fatigue an unspecified number of days after the vaccination.  At the time of the 
report the patient was recovering.   
•  One case, from the US, involved a 12-month-old female patient who received bivalent rLP2086 
instead of the 4th dose of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugated vaccine (13vPnC), along with MMR 
vaccine, and varicella zoster vaccine.  She developed, on the same day, low grade fever and 
fatigue, from which she recovered. 
•  One case, from the US, of a 12-month-old female patient who received bivalent rLP2086 instead 
of the intended vaccine, along with Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, Hepatitis A vaccine, 
MMR vaccine, and varicella zoster vaccine.  On the same day she developed high fever (value not 
provided), and sleep disturbance which began 5 hours after being given bivalent rLP2086.   
•  One case, from the US, of a 5-month-old male patient who received bivalent rLP2086 instead of 
13vPnC along with Hepatitis B vaccine, rotavirus vaccine, and ergocalciferol.  The following day, 
the patient had low grade fever (value not specified), vaccination site pain, and irritability.  The 
outcome of the adverse event was unknown at the time of the report.  
Case Reporting Serious Adverse Events 
A serious case from the US of a 1-month-old female patient who was supposed to receive the second 
dose of Hepatitis B vaccine and was instead inadvertently given bivalent rLP2086 (Medication error).  The 
following day she was admitted to the hospital with high fever (39.6 C), poor feeding, elevated liver 
enzymes, neutropenia, anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and hypertonia.  The cerebrospinal fluid revealed no 
growth after 48 hours. There was no growth from blood or urine cultures either.  The final diagnosis was 
aseptic meningitis secondary to inflammatory response due to the erroneous administration of the 
meningococcal B vaccine.  Ampicillin, ceftazidime, and acyclovir were empirically started at the 
admission, then discontinued.  The patient started recovering and was discharged from the hospital 4 
days later.  A product quality and manufacturing review was unremarkable for batch specification 
deviations. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Bivalent rLP2086 was well tolerated by children aged ≥12 months to <10 years. The data show that 
bivalent rLP2086 is a reactogenic vaccine, with a relatively high proportion of subjects reporting local and 
systemic reactions. Only one subject (n=1, 0.2%) discontinued the vaccine due to reactogenicity 
however; the majority of events were mild to moderate and transient with only very limited number of 
cases with potentiation. 
Reactions in children aged 12 to <24 months and 24 months to <10 years 
Among 120 μg bivalent rLP2086 recipients aged 12 to <24 months, tenderness at the injection site 
(72.7%) was the most commonly reported local reaction followed by redness (62.3%) and swelling 
(46.8%) after any vaccination. The most frequently reported local reaction for children aged 24 months to 
<10 years was pain at the injection site, 84.4%. This was lower as compared to adolescents receiving 
bivalent rLP2086 in Study B1971009, 92.6%. As highlighted by the MAH, this could be related to the 
ability of older individuals to better report pain, resulting in a reporting bias. Redness were more 
prominent among the children aged 12 to <24 months and 2 to <10 years than among the adolescents in 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 49/59 
 
 
  
  
  
Study B1971009, 62.3% and 60.2% vs 24.1%, respectively. Swelling was reported by 46.8% and 46.6% 
vs 27.4%, respectively. 
For children aged 12 to < 24 months, irritability (80.0%), loss of or decreased appetite (64.5%) and 
drowsiness (57.7%) were the most common systemic reactions. Considering the rates of systemic 
reactions in subjects aged 2 to 10 years as compared to subjects aged 10- to 25-years (Study B1971009 
and Study B1971016), headache (33.3% vs 33% to 52%, respectively) and fatigue (59.5% vs 36% to 
54%, respectively) were the most common systemic events reported for bivalent rLP2086 recipients, and 
use of antipyretics to self-treat symptoms during the 7 days following vaccination was 51% vs 12% to 
21%, respectively.  Antipyretic use in children aged 12 to < 24 months was 60.9%. 
Fever (≥38.0°C) was more common in children aged 12 to < 24 months (37.3%) and children aged 24 
months to <10 years (24.5%) compared to 1.2% to 6% for bivalent rLP2086 recipients aged 10 years to 
25 years. Fever was also more common under young children aged 24 months to <4 years, of whom 
30.3% reported fever (≥38.0°C) after any vaccination, compared to children aged ≥4 years to <10 
years, where 18.8% reported fever (≥38.0°C) after any vaccination. Of note, 11.4% of subjects aged 12 
to < 24 months and 9.7% of subjects aged ≥24months to <4 years reported fever ≥39.0°C, this was 
3.3% for children aged ≥4 to <10 years. 0.5% of children 12 to <24 months and 1.4% of children 
24months to <4 years reported fever >40°C, whilst no children aged ≥4 to <10 years reported fever 
>40°C. The majority of fevers were low grade and normalized within 2 days after vaccination. Fever rates 
declined with subsequent vaccinations. There were no febrile seizures reported. As approximately 10% of 
children under 4 will experience a high fever ≥39.0°C following vaccination, which is considered 
significant, this should be mentioned explicitly in the product information. 
60μg vs 120μg in children aged 12 to <24 months 
There is no clear difference in the safety profile with the 60μg dose as compared to the 120 μg dose apart 
from severe local reactions (tenderness, redness and swelling), which – albeit rare – appear to be more 
common following the full dose. 
Other AEs 
The percentages of bivalent rLP2086 recipients reporting AEs and MAEs within 30 days after any 
vaccination were similar to those reported for control recipients. Severe events were rare, as were related 
events. The percentage of subjects reporting AEs was higher (58.2% in children aged 1 to <2 years, 
44.2% in children aged 2 to <10 years) than that reported among the 13,275 bivalent rLP2086 recipients 
in 8 previously reported studies (30.6%). The majority of AEs were infections and infestations common 
for children aged 1 to <10 years. This is within expectation. 
The percentages of children aged 1 to <10 years experiencing SAEs was similar in those who received 
120 μg of bivalent rLP2086 on a 0-, 2-, and 6-month schedule vs those who received control vaccine 
within 30 days after any dose (2.1% vs 2.1%). This was 0.6% vs 0.7% in adolescents, respectively. 
Hip synovitis 
In children, 1 (0.2%) subject who received 120 μg of bivalent rLP2086 was reported with a related SAE - 
a case of transient hip synovitis in a 2-year-old male subject who received bivalent rLP2086. The 
synovitis began 1 day following Vaccination 2, did not require hospitalization, and resolved after 13 days 
without sequelae after the child received anti-inflammatory therapy. The subject was withdrawn from the 
study and did not receive the third dose.  
The 2 additional non serious cases of synovitis also occurred in subjects receiving bivalent rLP2086. One 
(1) case of related hip synovitis was diagnosed in a 3-year-old male subject 3 days after Vaccination 2 
and spontaneously resolved 3 days after the onset of the event without any intervention. The subject was 
withdrawn by the investigator and did not receive the third dose. The subject also had recovered from a 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 50/59 
 
 
  
  
  
viral upper respiratory infection 10 days prior to onset of the synovitis. The third case of synovitis was 
unrelated knee synovitis occurring in a 6-year-old female 16 days after Vaccination 2 and 24 days after 
recovery from a viral upper respiratory infection. It resolved after 5 days with ibuprofen treatment and 
the subject continued participation in the study, receiving Vaccination 3 without incident or recurrence.   
Transient hip synovitis is a usually benign self-limiting condition. Reported annual incidences around 
0.2% and 76.2 per 100,000 person-years in a general population, these would be higher in children aged 
2-10 years as the mean age of onset is 6 years [Asche et al Chiropractic & Manual therapies 2013, 
21:39]. If the indication were to be extended to include children this age, special attention should be 
given to the occurrence of transient hip synovitis following bivalent rLP2086. The MAH is requested to 
provide in the next PSUR a cumulative review the occurrence of transient hip synovitis and related AEs in 
relation to bivalent rLP2086. This cumulative review should include all type of sinovitis and also arthritis 
and reactive arthritis. 
Additional expert consultations 
Advice Vaccines Working Party (VWP)  
The VWP unanimously agreed that in this case there is a combination of factors that requires data on 
duration of protection and response to booster doses to be available pre-approval. Therefore, it was 
recommended to wait until data from study 35 (ongoing) become available. If this study shows that 
children of 1-2 years of age  mount an anamnestic response following a booster at 12 months after the 
third dose, it might be possible to approve use with a booster from 1-9 years even though the booster 
should probably be given between 6-12 months and not at 12 months.  
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Trumenba is a reactogenic vaccine, with higher rates of reactions seen in younger children up to the age 
of 10 as compared to adolescents. Approximately 10% of children aged 1 to <4 years will develop fever 
≥39.0°C following vaccination, which is considered significant and should be mentioned specifically in the 
SmPC. This information is updated in the SmPC. 
In addition, the MAH should submit the following safety data within the next PSUR: a cumulative review 
the occurrence of transient hip synovitis and related AEs in relation to bivalent rLP2086. This cumulative 
review should include all type of sinovitis and also arthritis and reactive arthritis. . If relevant a thorough 
discussion on the need for any updates of the ongoing routine signal evaluation activities (e.g. AE follow-
up forms), RMP or product information should be included.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH submitted an updated RMP version with this application. The variation proposes to lower the 
approved indication for Trumenba to include 1-9 year olds. The MAH submitted an updated RMP version 
(v2.0) with this application. 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 51/59 
 
 
  
  
  
The main proposed RMP changes were the following: 
- 
Product overview: Indication and posology updated to reflect the proposed extension of use in 
individuals from 1 year old.  
-  Addition in Module SIII on clinical trial exposure to include exposure data for children between 1 and 
9 years. 
-  Update of Module SIV on populations not studied in clinical trials to reflect the proposed infant 
variation. 
- 
The updated version is presented in the new EU-RMP format (as per Revision 2 of GVP Module V). 
The MAH has decided to change the scope of the current variation to update the Trumenba SmPC, and 
not to change the indication. Therefore, the RMP version 2 is not reflecting anymore the authorised 
indication and cannot be considered approvable; RMP version 3.0 remains as the latest approved. The 
Rapporteurs’ proposed changes to the list of safety concerns are further assessed in another ongoing 
procedure (EMEA/H/C/004051/II/0023). 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 2.0 is not acceptable. RMP version 3.0 (as 
approved in the later variation II/0023) remains as the latest approved. 
2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.2, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated to include relevant 
data  in  children  aged  1  to  10  years  and  inform  the  use  in  this  age  group.  The  Package  Leaflet  (PL)  is 
updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 3 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Trumenba (bivalent rLP2086) is a bivalent lipoprotein 2086 vaccine that consists of two purified 
recombinant lipoprotein 2086 (rLP2086) antigens, from each of the factor H binding protein (fHBP) 
subfamilies (A and B, A05 and B01). Bivalent rLP2086 is intended for active immunisation to prevent 
invasive meningococcal disease caused by Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. It is currently licensed to 
be used in children aged 10 years or older, adolescents and adults. With the current procedure the MAH 
intends to extend the use to children aged 1 to <10 years.

Since the introduction of conjugated Meningococcal C vaccines in Europe, Neisseria meningitidis 
serogroup B (MnB) has been a leading cause of invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). Risk factors for 
the development of meningococcal disease include age (<5 years of age with a second peak in 
adolescents and young adults), deficiencies in the terminal complement pathway, functional or anatomic 
asplenia and underlying chronic disease. 
In 2016 there were 3280 notified cases of MnB invasive disease in Europe. The notification rate in 
children under the age of 1 was 8.49 per 100.000, compared to 2.67 in children aged 1 to 4 years, 0.61 
per 100.000 in children aged 5 to 14 years and 1.07 per 100.000 in adolescents and young adults aged 
15 to 24 years. While the incidence of endemic disease has decreased in all age groups and is currently at 
a relatively low level globally, the rapid progression to serious illness or death, potentially life-changing 
long-term morbidities associated with IMD, and the shortcomings of mass chemoprophylaxis, emphasize 
the need for availability of safe and effective MnB vaccines to reduce the impact of MnB disease. 
In 2013 Bexsero, a MnB vaccine based on four different MnB antigens: NHBA, NadA, fHbp, and PorA P1.4, 
was approved in Europe for the prevention of MnB disease in individuals 2 months of age and older.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This application is supported by 2 clinical studies: B1971035 and B1971017 
As it is not feasible to demonstrate protective efficacy of MnB vaccines, the licensure is based on a 
serological marker, serum bactericidal antibody. Serum bactericidal antibody assays measure functional 
antibody activity in human sera that results in the complement-dependent killing of the target 
meningococcal strains. An hSBA titre ≥ 1:4 is a presumptive correlate for protection for MnB. Throughout 
the studies the lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) corresponded with an hSBA titre ≥ 1:8 or higher, 
dependent on strain. Therefore, this measure is relatively conservative. 
B1971035 is a phase 2 randomised active (HAV/saline) controlled observer blinded multicentre study in 
396 children 12 to <24 months of age. This study contains two stages: stage 1, which evaluates the 
primary vaccination and stage 2, which assesses the duration of the immune response and the response 
to a booster dose. The first stage of the study was designed to assess the immunogenicity, safety, and 
tolerability of bivalent rLP2086 when administered as a 3-dose primary series at Months 0, 2, and 6. It 
included a sentinel phase in which a sentinel enrolment phase in which a half dose of the vaccine (60 μg) 
was given to children aged 12 to <15 months and 18 to <24 months of age, 44 in total, before moving to 
a full dose of the vaccine (120 μg) in the same age cohorts. Only data from stage 1 are contained within 
the current submission. The MAH intends to submit the persistence and booster data from stage 2 of this 
study in the third quarter of 2020. 
B1971017 is a Phase 2, randomized (3:1), HAV/saline controlled, observer-blinded study to describe the 
immunogenicity, safety, and tolerability of bivalent rLP2086 in 400 healthy subjects aged ≥24 months to 
<4 years and ≥4 years to <10 years.  
In addition, the MAH submitted an extrapolation exercise from children and adolescents aged 10 to 18 
years to children aged 1 to 9 years.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
Subjects aged ≥12 to <24 months 
Of subjects aged 12 to <24 months, one month after the third dose of 120 μg of bivalent rLP2086, 
89.6%, 100.0%, 71.6% and 86.2% had a hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ against primary test strains A22, A56, B24 
and B44, respectively.  In subjects aged 12 to <24 months who received 60 μg of bivalent rLP2086, 
90.0%, 100.0%, 85.0% and 89.5% had a hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ against primary test strains A22, A56, B24 
and B44, respectively. 
The rates of hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ were largely similar to what was previously observed in adolescents (≥10 
years to <19 years), for whom bivalent rLP2086 is authorised, albeit based on GMTs the response in 
children aged ≥12 months to <24 months is slightly lower compared to adolescents.   
Subjects aged ≥24 months to <10 years  
The proportion of subjects aged ≥24 months to <4 years and ≥4 years to <10 years with an hSBA titre ≥ 
LLOQ at 1 month after the third vaccination with bivalent rLP2086 given at 0,2,6 m was 83.8% and 
91.0%, respectively, for A22; 100.0% for both age strata for A56; 85.7% and 92.1%, respectively, for 
B24; and 80.0% and 78.3%, respectively, for B44. The rate of hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ was largely similar to 
what was previously observed in adolescents (≥10 years to <19 years).   
For subjects aged ≥24 months to <4 years 6 months after the third vaccination the proportion of subjects 
with an hSBA titre ≥LLOQ decreased to 19.0% for A22; 80.3% for A56; 9.2% for B24; and 12.1% for 
B44. For subjects aged ≥4 years to <10 years 6 months after the third vaccination the proportion of 
subjects with an hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ had decreased to 46.0% for A22; 84.3% for A56; 21.9% for B24; 
and 8.7% for B44. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In children aged ≥12 months to <24 months, only few subjects have been exposed to the half dose. As a 
result, confidence intervals around point estimates are wide. No inferential testing between the half, 60μg 
dose, and the full, 120 μg, dose was planned for. 
There is no hSBA persistence data for children aged ≥12 to <24 months. For children aged ≥24 months 
to <10 years, there is persistence of hSBA measured at 6 months post third dose however data between 
1 month after the third dose and 6 months after the third dose were not collected so the decay curve is 
unknown.  
There is no booster data available for children aged ≥12 months to <10 years. Without booster response 
data in the young children, aged ≥12 months to <24 months, we do not know whether priming was 
adequate. 
The age-related decline in persistence is not predicted by the antibody response as measured 1-month 
post dose 3. It is unclear which factors of the immune response are responsible for this faster decline in 
antibodies with younger age. Therefore, there is too much uncertainty to extrapolate the immunogenicity 
conclusions from children and adolescents aged 11-18 years to younger children (aged 1-9 years).

3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Subjects aged ≥12 to <24 months 
Among 120 μg bivalent rLP2086 recipients, tenderness at the injection site (72.7%) was the most 
commonly reported local reaction followed by redness (62.3%), and swelling (46.8%) after any 
vaccination, compared to 31.1%, 21.2%, and 15.2% in the HAV/saline group, respectively.   
Subjects in the 120 μg bivalent rLP2086 and HAV/saline groups reported the following systemic reactions: 
fever (≥38°C) (37.3% and 15.2%, respectively), irritability (80.0% and 52.3%, respectively), drowsiness 
(57.7% and 30.3%, respectively), loss of or decreased appetite (64.5% and 37.9%, respectively), and 
antipyretic medication use (60.9% and 34.1%, respectively).   
One subject discontinued from the study because of related decreased appetite, injection site pain, 
irritability, and somnolence. 
There were no SAEs which were considered related to bivalent rLP2086. 
Subjects aged ≥24 months to <10 years  
Pain at the injection site (84.4%) was the most commonly reported local reaction followed by redness 
(60.2%) and swelling (46.6%) after any vaccination, compared to 33.0%, 17.0% and 9.4% in the 
HAV/saline group, respectively.  
The bivalent rLP2086 group reported higher rates of systemic reactogenicity events after any vaccination 
than subjects receiving HAV/saline. These differences were substantial for fever (24.5% vs 12.3%, 
respectively), headache (33.3% vs 20.8%, respectively), fatigue (59.5% vs 38.7%, respectively), muscle 
pain (28.2% vs 8.5%, respectively), and joint pain (14.6% vs 6.6%, respectively). Antipyretic use in the 
bivalent group vs HAV/saline group was 51.0% vs 28.3%.   
One SAE was considered related to bivalent rLP2086 by the investigator - a case of transient hip synovitis 
in a 2-year-old male subject with onset 1 day after Vaccination 2. Two subjects in the bivalent rLP2086 
group withdrew from the study because of the AE of synovitis, both of which were considered related to 
investigational product by the investigator.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety database in children aged ≥12 months to <24 months and ≥24 months to 10 years is 
relatively limited: 514 (120 μg bivalent rLP2086), 44 (60 μg bivalent rLP2086). This includes 294 subjects 
aged ≥24 months to <10 years and 220 subjects aged ≥12 months to <24 months exposed to 120 μg 
bivalent rLP2086. It is insufficient in size to exclude the occurrence of serious but rare adverse reactions.

Notes: Only favourable and unfavourable effects for the 120μg dose given at 0,2,6 months are presented 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Within the main clinical studies, a functional immune response has been demonstrated against four 
primary strains which have been selected from a MnB SBA strain pool of invasive disease isolates 
collected in Europe and the US. The MnB strain pool from which test strains were selected is similar in 
make-up and distribution of fHBP variants compared to contemporary, recently (2011-2014) collected 
MnB strains from the UK, the Netherlands, Canada and the US, therefore results of the main clinical trials 
can be considered relevant to the current situation. 
Responses following three doses given at 0,2 and 6 months were relatively strong against all the strains 
tested against. One month after the third dose of 120μg bivalent rLP2086, 71.6-100.0% of subjects aged 
≥12 to <24 months had an hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ for the 4 primary MnB test strains.  
For subjects aged ≥24 months to <4 years this was 80.0 - 100.0%, and for subjects aged ≥4 years to 
<10 years this was 78.3-100.0%. 
Broadly, the response one month after primary vaccination is similar in children aged ≥24 months to <10 
years of age as compared to adolescents and is slightly lower in children aged ≥12 months to <24 
months of age.

Bivalent rLP2086 is a fairly reactogenic vaccine with a high proportion of subjects reporting local and 
systemic reactions. Approximately 10% of children aged 1 to 4 years developed high fever (≥39°C) 
following vaccination with bivalent rLP2986. This is considered significant. 
The persistence data in children aged ≥24 months to <10 years show that persistence is poor for the 
A22, B24 and B44 strain. After 6 months the proportion of subjects with an hSBA titre ≥ LLOQ had 
decreased to 32.5% for A22, 15.5% for B24 and 10.4% for B44. The decline was sharper in younger 
children, <4 years, as compared to the children ≥4 years of age. Although hSBA levels remained high 
against the A56 strain (declined from 100% to 82.4%), the data show that the priming doses are 
insufficient to ensure durable protection. A primary series of vaccination at 0,2,6 m provides only limited 
benefit as it is of short duration for a majority of the strains tested against for in children aged 2 to 10 
years.   
Results in adolescents (studies B1971005, B1971012/B1971033) would suggest immune persistence 
being better in this older age group. Potentially higher baseline titres in adolescents contribute to this 
improved persistence, however there may simply be a better priming response in older children. In any 
case, a booster dose is recommended for adolescents for those who remain at risk of IMD. 
It was concluded that, with the available data at the moment, the proposed vaccination schedule was 
inadequate to ensure durable protection for the requested indication (≥1 to <10 years). An additional 
dose seems required and data to support such a recommendation are needed.  
It is noted that the MAH is planning an additional Phase 3 clinical study of bivalent rLP2086 in children 1 
to 9 years of age. The MAH is recommended   to include the evaluation of a booster dose earlier than 2 
years post primary vaccination in the target group; considering the waning antibody titres observed it 
would seem sensible to recommend a fourth dose 6 months post primary.  
The response in children aged ≥12 to <24 months was similar following the 60μg dose given at 0,2 and 6 
months as compared to the 120 μg dose, albeit based on very limited data, pointing towards no clear 
benefit of the whole dose over the half dose in this age group.   
As data with the half dose are very limited and as the study was not designed for inferential testing, 
conclusions made based on this data are only preliminary and further confirmation would be needed. 
Moreover, there is no marked difference in the reactogenicity profile of the 60μg dose compared to the 
120μg dose. Fever rates were similar between the two doses, as were the rates for most reactions 
measured. There is some indication however that there might be more severe local reactions with the 
higher dose, although these are rare. The MAH clarified that they have no further plans to evaluate the 
60μg dose in children aged ≥12 to <24 months but are however planning to further evaluate this reduced 
dose in infants. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The overall B/R of Trumenba remains unchanged for children aged 10 years and older for the currently 
proposed vaccination schedule.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Trumenba is positive for children aged from 10 years of age for the currently proposed 
vaccination schedule.  
An extension of indication of Trumenba in children from 1 to 9 years is not approvable at the moment 
with the current data. An update to SmPC 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 to update efficacy and safety data related to 
studies B1971017 and B1971035 were agreed. 
EMA/331550/2020 
Page 57/59 
 
 
  
  
  
The overall B/R of Trumenba is positive. 
In addition, the applicant should submit the following safety data with the next PSUR: 
The MAH is requested to provide in the next PSUR a cumulative review the occurrence of transient hip 
synovitis and related AEs in relation to bivalent rLP2086. This cumulative review should include all type of 
sinovitis and also arthritis and reactive arthritis. If relevant a thorough discussion on the need for any 
updates of the ongoing routine signal evaluation activities (e.g. AE follow-up forms), RMP or product 
information should be included.

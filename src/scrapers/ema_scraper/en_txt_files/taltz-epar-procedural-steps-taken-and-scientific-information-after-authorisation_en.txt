Spondyloarthritis pivotal studies COAST V/W/X (52 weeks) 
were offered participation in a long term extension and

<1.3 at least once, and no ASDAS score ≥2.1, at weeks 16 
and 20), 155 patients exposed to Taltz up to 76 weeks 
were randomised at week 24 of the COAST Y study 
(Placebo, N=53; Taltz Q4W, N=48; and Taltz Q2W, N=54); 
of these, 148 (95.5%) completed the week 64 visit 
(Placebo, N=50; Taltz Q4W, N=47; Taltz Q2W, N=51). The 
primary endpoint was the proportion of patients in the 
randomised withdrawal population who did not experience 
a flare during weeks 24 64 (combined Taltz Q2W and Taltz 
Q4W groups versus placebo). A significantly larger 
proportion of patients (NRI) in the combined Taltz groups 
(83.3% (85/102), p<0.001) and Taltz Q4W (83.3 % 
(40/48), p=0.003) had no flare during weeks 24 64 
compared with those who withdrew from Taltz to placebo 
(54.7 % (29/53)). Taltz (in both combined Taltz groups and 
Taltz Q4W group) significantly delayed the time to flare 
(Log Rank Test p<0.001 and p<0.01, respectively) 
compared to Placebo.  
In patients who received Taltz Q4W continuously (N=157), 
the ASAS40, ASDAS<2.1 and BASDAI50 responses were 
maintained to Week 116. 
In conclusion, data from the randomized placebo-controlled 
withdrawal-retreatment study shows that, in patients who 
achieved sustained remission, continuous treatment with 
ixekizumab reduces the likelihood of experiencing a flare.

The long-term efficacy data from the studies submitted in 
Clinical studies in adult plaque psoriasis: 
Type II- C.I.4 -Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC 
regarding long term data in the treatment of 
psoriasis: RHAZ, RHBA, RHBC (3 studies of the 
“UNCOVER” series) were the pivotal registration 
studies, with response data up to 60 weeks already 
included in the SmPC. The current update relates to 
the extension data available, covering a total of 5 
years. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC has also been updated with 
information from study RHCR (known as “IXORA-R”) 
which is a 24-week head-to-head comparison of Taltz 
vs guselkumab. 
Clinical studies in adult psoriatic arthritis: 
Type II- C.I.4 -Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC 
regarding long term data in the treatment of 
psoriatic arthritis: RHAP and RHBE (also known as 
SPIRIT-P1 and P2) were pivotal registration studies, 
with response data at 24 weeks and up to 52 weeks 
(SPIRIT-P1) already included in the SmPC. The 
current update relates to extension data available 
covering  a total of 3 years. Section 5.1 of the SmPC 
has also been updated with longer-term data from 
study RHCF (“SPIRIT-H2H” Taltz vs adalimumab). 
plaque psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis supports a long term 
sustained efficacy in this adult population treated with 
Taltz. The risk profile from these additional studies is also 
consistent with the known safety profile for Taltz (described 
in the currently approved SmPC), and there were no new 
clinically important safety findings with this long-term data 
submission.

SmPC, 
Based on the review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, 
Labelling and 
the CHMP considered that the benefit-risk balance of Taltz 
PL 
in the approved indication remains favourable and 
therefore recommended the renewal of the marketing 
authorisation with unlimited validity.

Ixekizumab versus Adalimumab in Patients with 
from a drug-drug interaction study in patients with 
moderate-to-severe psoriasis, which determined that 12

metabolized by CYP3A4 (i.e., midazolam), CYP2C9 (i.e.,

In addition, results from a study investigating the efficacy

compared to adalimumab (ADA) in 566 patients with PsA 
who were naïve to biologic disease-modifying anti-
rheumatic drugs (bDMARD) were also reflected in the 
product information.  
Taltz was superior to ADA on the primary study objective: 
simultaneous achievement of ACR 50 and PASI 100 
response at Week 24 (Taltz 36.0% vs ADA 27.9%; 
p=0.036; 95% confidence interval [0.5%, 15.8%]). Taltz 
also showed non-inferiority (pre-specified margin of -12%) 
to ADA on ACR 50 ((ITT analysis: 3.9% difference vs. ADA; 
95% confidence interval [-4.3%; 12.1% ; PPS analysis 
Taltz: 52.3%, ADA: 53.1%, difference: -0.8% [CI: -10.3%;

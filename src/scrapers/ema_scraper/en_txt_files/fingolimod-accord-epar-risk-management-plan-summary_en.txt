Summary of risk management plan for Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg 
hard capsules (Fingolimod hydrochloride) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  Fingolimod  Accord  0.5  mg 
hard capsules. The RMP details important risks of Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg hard capsules, how 
these  risks  can  be  minimised,  and  how  more  information  will  be  obtained  about  Fingolimod 
Accord 0.5 mg hard capsules’ risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
Fingolimod  Accord  0.5  mg  hard  capsule’s  summary  of  product  characteristics  (SmPC)  and 
its package  leaflet  give  essential  information  to  healthcare  professionals  and  patients  on 
how Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg hard capsules should be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Fingolimod  Accord 0.5  mg  hard  capsules  should be  read  in  the 
context  of  all  this  information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its 
plain-language summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates 
of Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg hard capsules’ RMP. 
I. 
The medicine and what it is used for
‘Fingolimod  Accord  0.5  mg  hard  capsules’  is  indicated  as  single  disease  modifying  therapy 
in highly  active relapsing remitting  multiple sclerosis for the following groups of adult patients 
and paediatric patients aged 10 years and older: 
- Patients with highly active disease despite a full and adequate course of treatment with at least
one disease modifying therapy.
or 
- Patients with rapidly evolving severe relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis defined by 2 or
more disabling relapses  in one  year, and with 1 or more Gadolinium enhancing lesions on
brain MRI or a significant increase in T2 lesion load as compared to a previous recent MRI.
It contains fingolimod hydrochloride as the active substance and it is given by oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg hard capsule’s benefits can 
be  found  in  Fingolimod  Accord  0.5  mg  hard  capsule’s  EPAR,  including  in  its  plain-language 
summary, available on the EMA website, under the medicine’s webpage.

Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further
II.
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg hard capsules, together with measures to minimise 
such  risks  and  the  proposed  studies  for  learning  more  about  Fingolimod  Accord  0.5  mg  hard 
capsules’ risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status  - the way a medicine  is supplied to the  patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg hard capsules, these measures are supplemented with 
additional risk minimisation measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment and signal management activity, so that immediate 
action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg hard capsules 
is not yet available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A  List of important risks and missing information
Important  risks  of  Fingolimod  Accord  0.5  mg  hard  capsules  are  risks  that  need  special  risk 
management activities to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can 
be  safely  taken.  Important  risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are 
concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of Fingolimod Accord 0.5 mg 
hard capsules. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine 
is  possible  based  on  available  data,  but  this  association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs 
further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product 
that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients  with  diabetes  and  history  of  uveitis  are  considered  at 
increased  risk  of  developing  macular  edema.  Such  patients 
should  undergo  an  ophthalmic  evaluation  prior  to  initiating 
fingolimod  therapy  and  have  follow-up  evaluations  while 
receiving fingolimod therapy.

Evidence  for  linking  the  risk 
to the medicine 
Considered  ‘important’  as  a  change  in  the  risk  could  have  an 
impact on the risk-benefit balance of the product. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
immunocompromised  patients  (including 
Patients  with  increased  risk  for  opportunistic  infections, 
those 
including 
currently  receiving  immunosuppressive  therapies  or  those 
immunocompromised by prior therapies) and those with severe 
active  infections including active chronic infections (hepatitis, 
tuberculosis) should not receive fingolimod. 
Varicella-zoster virus infections 
Patients  receiving  concomitant  immunosuppressive  therapy 
may be at increased risk for VZV infections. 
The patient who died because of disseminated varicella zoster 
infection reported no history of varicella infection, no previous 
vaccination  against  varicella  zoster  (VZ)  virus  and  was  VZ 
virus-IgG negative. Therefore, patients with negative VZ virus-
IgG results may be at increased risk of developing severe forms 
of primary infection with VZ virus, particularly in the context 
where they receive additional high-dose steroid therapy, e.g. in 
case of an MS relapse. 
Herpes viral infections other than VZV 
Patients  receiving  concomitant  immunosuppressive  therapy 
may be at increased risk for Herpes viral infections other than 
VZV. 
Progressive Multifocal Leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
PML  primarily  affects  individuals  with  suppressed  immune 
systems.  In  recent  years,  the  most  common  underlying 
immunosuppressive illness has been AIDS. However, a variety 
of non-AIDS immunosuppressive illnesses has been associated 
with  the  occurrence  of  PML.  These  include  lymphoreticular 
malignancy, most commonly chronic lymphocytic leukemia or 
non-Hodgkin  lymphoma.  JC  virus  is  a  double-stranded  DNA 
human polyomavirus acquired in childhood. After infection, it 
remains  latent  in  the  body.  50-70%  of  the  adult  population  is 
seropositive.  It  is  believed  that  all  seropositive  individuals 
harbor  latent  virus  in  kidney,  lymphoreticular  tissue, or brain. 
PML  is  considered  a  reactivation  infection.  Whether  the 
reactivation  occurs  systemically,  with  immunosuppression 
causing  dissemination  to  the  brain  at  that  time,  or  the 
reactivation  occurs  from  latent  virus  in  the  brain  remains 
unclear. 
In people who are immunosuppressed, JC virus can reactivate 
and cause PML which is usually fatal. 
Cases  of  PML  have  been  reported  with  another  MS  drug, 
natalizumab,  a  monoclonal  antibody  that  blocks  lymphocyte 
migration into the CNS (i.e. an effect on all lymphocyte subsets, 
including effector memory cells). Additionally, natalizumab has 
effects, such as mobilization of JC virus-carrying bone marrow 
precursor cells and splenic marginal zone B cells, which are not 
seen  with  fingolimod.  The  natalizumab  label  describes  3  risk 
factors that are known to increase the risk of PML in patients 
under therapy with natalizumab: treatment duration longer than 
2  years,  prior  treatment  with  an  immunosuppressant  and 
presence of anti-JCV antibodies. Patients with all 3 known risk 
factors have an estimated risk of PML of 11/1,000. 
When evaluating the potential/theoretical risk with fingolimod, 
the specific risk factors should be considered: 
The presence of anti-JCV antibodies 
Switching to fingolimod after treatment with natalizumab for >2 
years and duration of washout of natalizumab  
Prior  treatment  with  an  immunosuppressant  medication  (e.g., 
mitoxantrone, azathioprine, methotrexate, cyclophosphamide).

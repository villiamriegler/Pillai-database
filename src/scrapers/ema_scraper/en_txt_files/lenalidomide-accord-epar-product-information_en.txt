CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Multiple myeloma 
Lenalidomide Accord as monotherapy is indicated for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with 
newly diagnosed multiple myeloma who have undergone autologous stem cell transplantation. 
Lenalidomide Accord as combination therapy with dexamethasone, or bortezomib and 
dexamethasone, or melphalan and prednisone (see section 4.2) is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for transplant. 
Lenalidomide Accord in combination with dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of multiple 
myeloma in adult patients who have received at least one prior therapy. 
Myelodysplastic syndromes 
Lenalidomide Accord as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with transfusion-
dependent anaemia  due to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with an 
isolated  deletion  5q  cytogenetic  abnormality  when  other  therapeutic  options  are  insufficient  or 
inadequate. 
Mantle cell lymphoma 
Lenalidomide Accord as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with relapsed or 
refractory mantle  cell lymphoma (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Follicular lymphoma 
Lenalidomide Accord in combination with rituximab (anti-CD20 antibody) is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma (Grade 1 – 3a). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Lenalidomide treatment should be supervised by a physician experienced in the use of anti-cancer 
therapies. 
For all indications described below: 
•  Dose is modified based upon clinical and laboratory findings (see section 4.4). 
•  Dose adjustments, during treatment and restart of treatment, are recommended to manage 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or other Grade 3 or 4 toxicity judged to be 
related to lenalidomide. 
In case of neutropenia, the use of growth factors in patient management should be considered. 
If less than 12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose, the patient can take the dose. If more 
than 12 hours has elapsed since missing a dose at the normal time, the patient should not take 
the dose, but take the next dose at the normal time on the following day.

ª At the physician’s discretion, if neutropenia is the only toxicity at any dose level, add G-CSF 
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) or follicular lymphoma (FL)  
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS)  
All patients should receive TLS prophylaxis (allopurinol, rasburicase or equivalent as per institutional 
guidelines) and be well hydrated (orally) during the first week of the first cycle or for a longer period 
if clinically indicated.  To monitor for TLS, patients should have a chemistry panel drawn weekly 
during the first cycle and as clinically indicated. 
Lenalidomide may be continued (maintain dose) in patients with laboratory TLS or Grade 1 clinical 
TLS, or at the physician’s discretion, reduce dose by one level and continue lenalidomide. Vigorous 
intravenous hydration should be provided and appropriate medical management according to the local 
standard of care, until correction of electrolyte abnormalities. Rasburicase therapy may be needed to 
reduce hyperuricaemia. Hospitalisation of the patient will be at physician’s discretion. 
In patients with Grade 2 to 4 clinical TLS, interrupt lenalidomide and obtain a chemistry panel weekly 
or as clinically indicated. Vigorous intravenous hydration should be provided and appropriate medical 
management according to the local standard of care, until correction of electrolyte abnormalities. 
Rasburicase therapy and hospitalisation will be at physician’s discretion. When the TLS resolves to 
Grade 0, restart lenalidomide at next lower dose per physician’s discretion (see section 4.4). 
Tumour flare reaction 
At the physician’s discretion, lenalidomide may be continued in patients with Grade 1 or 2 tumour 
flare reaction (TFR) without interruption or modification. At the physician’s discretion, therapy with 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), limited duration corticosteroids, and/or narcotic 
analgesics may be administered. In patients with Grade 3 or 4 TFR, withhold treatment with 
lenalidomide and initiate therapy with NSAIDs, corticosteroids and/or narcotic analgesics. When TFR 
resolves to ≤ Grade 1, restart lenalidomide treatment at the same dose level for the rest of the cycle. 
Patients may be treated for management of symptoms per the guidance for treatment of Grade 1 and 2 
TFR (see section 4.4).  
All indications 
For other Grade 3 or 4 toxicities judged to be related to lenalidomide, treatment should be stopped and 
only restarted at next lower dose level when toxicity has resolved to ≤ Grade 2 depending on the 
physician’s discretion. 
Lenalidomide interruption or discontinuation should be considered for Grade 2 or 3 skin rash. 
Lenalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, Grade 4 rash, exfoliative 
or bullous rash, or if Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) or Drug 
Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS) is suspected and should not be resumed 
following discontinuation from these reactions.

Special populations 
Paediatric population 
Lenalidomide Accord should not be used in children and adolescents from birth to less than 18 years 
because of safety  concerns (see section 5.1). 
Elderly 
Currently available pharmacokinetic data are described in section 5.2. Lenalidomide has been used in 
clinical trials in multiple myeloma patients up to 91 years of age, in myelodysplastic syndromes 
patients up to 95 years of age and in mantle cell lymphoma patients up to 88 years of age (see section 
5.1).  
Because elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose 
selection and it would be prudent to monitor renal function. 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant 
Patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 75 years and older should be carefully assessed 
before treatment is considered (see section 4.4). 
For patients older than 75 years of age treated with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone, 
the starting dose of dexamethasone is 20 mg once daily on days 1, 8, 15 and 22 of each 28-day 
treatment cycle. 
No dose adjustment is proposed for patients older than 75 years who are treated with lenalidomide in 
combination with melphalan and prednisone. 
In patients with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma aged 75 years and older who received 
lenalidomide, there was a higher incidence of serious adverse reactions and adverse reactions that led 
to treatment discontinuation. 
Lenalidomide combined therapy was less tolerated in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients 
older than 75 years of age compared to the younger population. These patients discontinued at a higher 
rate due to intolerance (Grade 3 or 4 adverse events and serious adverse events), when compared to 
patients < 75 years. 
Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy  
The percentage of multiple myeloma patients aged 65 or over was not significantly different between 
the lenalidomide/dexamethasone and placebo/dexamethasone groups. No overall difference in safety 
or efficacy was observed between these patients and younger patients, but greater pre-disposition of 
older individuals cannot be ruled out.  
Myelodysplastic syndromes 
For myelodysplastic syndromes patients treated with lenalidomide, no overall difference in safety and 
efficacy was observed between patients aged over 65 and younger patients. 
Mantle cell lymphoma 
For mantle cell lymphoma patients treated with lenalidomide, no overall difference in safety and 
efficacy  was observed between patients aged 65 years or over compared with patients aged under 
65 years of age. 
Follicular lymphoma 
For follicular lymphoma patients treated with lenalidomide in combination with rituximab, the overall 
rate of adverse events is similar for patients aged 65 years or over compared with patients under 
65 years of age. No overall difference in efficacy was observed between the two age groups.

Patients with renal impairment 
Lenalidomide is primarily excreted by the kidney; patients with greater degrees of renal impairment 
can have impaired treatment tolerance (see section 4.4). Care should be taken in dose selection and 
monitoring of renal function is advised. 
No dose adjustments are required for patients with mild renal impairment and multiple myeloma 
myelodysplastic syndromes, mantle cell lymphoma, or follicular lymphoma. The following dose 
adjustments are recommended at the start of therapy and throughout treatment for patients with 
moderate or severe impaired renal function or end stage renal disease. 
There are no phase 3 trial experiences with End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) (CLcr < 30 mL/min, 
requiring dialysis).

daily. 
After initiation of lenalidomide therapy, subsequent lenalidomide dose modification in renally 
impaired patients should be based on individual patient treatment tolerance, as described above. 
Patients with hepatic impairment 
Lenalidomide has not formally been studied in patients with impaired hepatic function and there are 
no specific dose recommendations. 
Method of administration  
Oral use.  
Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules should be taken orally at about the same time on the scheduled 
days. The capsules should not be opened, broken or chewed. The capsules should be swallowed 
whole, preferably with water, either with or without food. 
It is recommended to press only on one end of the capsule to remove it from the blister thereby 
reducing the risk of capsule deformation or breakage. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
• 
•  Women who are pregnant.  
•  Women of childbearing potential unless all of the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention 
Programme are met (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
When lenalidomide is given in combination with other medicinal products, the corresponding 
Summary of Product Characteristics must be consulted prior to initiation of treatment.  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Pregnancy warning 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. Lenalidomide induced in monkeys’ 
malformations similar to those described with thalidomide (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). If lenalidomide 
is taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected. 
The conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme must be fulfilled for all patients unless there 
is reliable evidence that the patient does not have childbearing potential. 
Criteria for women of non-childbearing potential 
A female patient or a female partner of a male patient is considered to have childbearing potential 
unless she meets at least one of the following criteria: 
• 
Age ≥ 50 years and naturally amenorrhoeic for ≥ 1 year (amenorrhoea following cancer therapy 
or during breast-feeding does not rule out childbearing potential). 
Premature ovarian failure confirmed by a specialist gynaecologist 
Previous bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy 
XY genotype, Turner syndrome, uterine agenesis. 
• 
• 
• 
Counselling 
For women of childbearing potential, lenalidomide is contraindicated unless all of the following are 
met: 
• 
• 
She understands the expected teratogenic risk to the unborn child 
She understands the need for effective contraception, without interruption, at least 4 weeks 
before starting treatment, throughout the entire duration of treatment, and at least 4 weeks after 
the end of treatment 
Even if a woman of childbearing potential has amenorrhea she must follow all the advice on 
effective contraception 
She should be capable of complying with effective contraceptive measures 
She is informed and understands the potential consequences of pregnancy and the need to 
rapidly consult if there is a risk of pregnancy 
She understands the need to commence the treatment as soon as lenalidomide is dispensed 
following a negative pregnancy test 
She understands the need and accepts to undergo pregnancy testing at least every 4 weeks 
except in case of confirmed tubal sterilisation 
She acknowledges that she understands the hazards and necessary precautions associated with 
the use of lenalidomide. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
For male patients taking lenalidomide, pharmacokinetic data has demonstrated that lenalidomide is 
present in human semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable in human semen 
3 days after stopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a precaution and taking 
into account special populations with prolonged elimination time such as renal impairment, all male 
patients taking lenalidomide must meet the following conditions: 
• 
Understand the expected teratogenic risk if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant woman or 
a woman of childbearing potential 
Understand the need for the use of a condom if engaged in sexual activity with a pregnant 
woman or a woman of childbearing potential not using effective contraception (even if the man 
has had a vasectomy), during treatment and for at least 7 days after dose interruptions and/or 
cessation of treatment. 
Understand that if his female partner becomes pregnant whilst he is taking lenalidomide or 
shortly after he has stopped taking lenalidomide, he should inform his treating physician 
immediately and that it is recommended to refer the female partner to a physician specialised or 
experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. 
• 
• 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The prescriber must ensure that for women of childbearing potential: 
• 
The patient complies with the conditions of the Pregnancy Prevention Programme, including 
confirmation that she has an adequate level of understanding 
The patient has acknowledged the aforementioned conditions. 
• 
Contraception 
Women of childbearing potential must use at least one effective method of contraception for at least 
4 weeks before therapy, during therapy, and until at least 4 weeks after lenalidomide therapy and even 
in case of dose interruption unless the patient commits to absolute and continuous abstinence 
confirmed on a monthly basis. If not established on effective contraception, the patient must be 
referred to an appropriately trained health care professional for contraceptive advice in order that 
contraception can be initiated.  
The following can be considered to be examples of suitable methods of contraception: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Implant 
Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (IUS) 
Medroxyprogesterone acetate depot 
Tubal sterilisation 
Sexual intercourse with a vasectomised male partner only; vasectomy must be confirmed by two 
negative semen analyses 
Ovulation inhibitory progesterone-only pills (i.e. desogestrel) 
• 
Because of the increased risk of venous thromboembolism in patients with multiple myeloma taking 
lenalidomide in combination therapy, and to a lesser extent in patients with multiple myeloma, 
myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma taking lenalidomide monotherapy, combined 
oral contraceptive pills are not recommended (see also section 4.5).  
If a patient is currently using combined oral contraception the patient should switch to one of the 
effective methods listed above. The risk of venous thromboembolism continues for 4−6 weeks after 
discontinuing combined oral contraception. The efficacy of contraceptive steroids may be reduced 
during co-treatment with dexamethasone (see section 4.5). 
Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are associated with an increased risk of 
infection at the time of insertion and irregular vaginal bleeding. Prophylactic antibiotics should be 
considered particularly in patients with neutropenia. 
Copper-releasing intrauterine devices are generally not recommended due to the potential risks of 
infection at the time of insertion and menstrual blood loss which may compromise patients with 
neutropenia or thrombocytopenia. 
Pregnancy testing 
According to local practice, medically supervised pregnancy tests with a minimum sensitivity of 
25 mIU/mL must be performed for women of childbearing potential as outlined below. This 
requirement includes women of childbearing potential who practice absolute and continuous 
abstinence. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same 
day. Dispensing of lenalidomide to women of childbearing potential should occur within 7 days of the 
prescription. 
Prior to starting treatment 
A medically supervised pregnancy test should be performed during the consultation, when 
lenalidomide is prescribed, or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the prescriber once the patient had been 
using effective contraception for at least 4 weeks. The test should ensure the patient is not pregnant 
when she starts treatment with lenalidomide. 
16 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Follow-up and end of treatment 
A medically supervised pregnancy test should be repeated at least every 4 weeks, including at least 
4 weeks after the end of treatment, except in the case of confirmed tubal sterilisation. These pregnancy 
tests should be performed on the day of the prescribing visit or in the 3 days prior to the visit to the 
prescriber. 
Additional precautions 
Patients should be instructed never to give this medicinal product to another person and to return any 
unused capsules to their pharmacist at the end of treatment for safe disposal. 
Patients should not donate blood, semen or sperm during treatment (including during dose 
interruptions) and for at least 7 days following discontinuation of lenalidomide. 
Healthcare professionals and caregivers should wear disposable gloves when handling the blister or 
capsule. 
Women who are pregnant or suspect they may be pregnant should not handle the blister or capsule 
(see section 6.6). 
Educational materials, prescribing and dispensing restrictions 
In order to assist patients in avoiding foetal exposure to lenalidomide, the marketing authorisation 
holder will provide educational material to health care professionals to reinforce the warnings about 
the expected teratogenicity of lenalidomide, to provide advice on contraception before therapy is 
started, and to provide guidance on the need for pregnancy testing. The prescriber must inform male 
and female patients about the expected teratogenic risk and the strict pregnancy prevention measures 
as specified in the Pregnancy Prevention Programme and provide patients with appropriate patient 
educational brochure, patient card and/or equivalent tool in accordance to the national implemented 
patient card system. A national controlled distribution system has been implemented in collaboration 
with each National Competent Authority. The controlled distribution system includes the use of a 
patient card and/or equivalent tool for prescribing and/or dispensing controls, and the collecting of 
detailed data relating to the indication in order to monitor closely the off-label use within the national 
territory. Ideally, pregnancy testing, issuing a prescription and dispensing should occur on the same 
day. Dispensing of lenalidomide to women of childbearing potential should occur within 7 days of the 
prescription and following a medically supervised negative pregnancy test result. Prescriptions for 
women of childbearing potential can be for a maximum duration of treatment of 4 weeks according to 
the approved indications dosing regimens (see section 4.2), and prescriptions for all other patients can 
be for a maximum duration of treatment of 12 weeks. 
Other special warnings and precautions for use 
Myocardial infarction 
Myocardial infarction has been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, particularly in those with 
known risk factors and within the first 12 months when used in combination with dexamethasone. 
Patients with known risk factors – including prior thrombosis – should be closely monitored, and 
action should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable risk factors (eg. smoking, hypertension, and 
hyperlipidaemia). 
Venous and arterial thromboembolic events 
In patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is associated 
with an increased risk of venous thromboembolism (predominantly deep vein thrombosis and 
pulmonary embolism). The risk of venous thromboembolism was seen to a lesser extent with 
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone.  
In patients with multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma, treatment 
with lenalidomide monotherapy was associated with a lower risk of venous thromboembolism 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(predominantly deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism) than in patients with multiple 
myeloma treated with lenalidomide in combination therapy (see sections 4.5 and 4.8). 
In patients with multiple myeloma, the combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone is associated 
with an increased risk of arterial thromboembolism (predominantly myocardial infarction and 
cerebrovascular event) and was seen to a lesser extent with lenalidomide in combination with 
melphalan and prednisone. The risk of arterial thromboembolism is lower in patients with multiple 
myeloma treated with lenalidomide monotherapy than in patients with multiple myeloma treated with 
lenalidomide in combination therapy. 
Consequently, patients with known risk factors for thromboembolism – including prior thrombosis – 
should be closely monitored. Action should be taken to try to minimize all modifiable risk factors (e.g. 
smoking, hypertension, and hyperlipidaemia). Concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or 
previous history of thromboembolic events may also increase thrombotic risk in these patients. 
Therefore, erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as 
hormone replacement therapy, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving 
lenalidomide with dexamethasone. A haemoglobin concentration above 12 g/dl should lead to 
discontinuation of erythropoietic agents. 
Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for the signs and symptoms of thromboembolism. 
Patients should be instructed to seek medical care if they develop symptoms such as shortness of 
breath, chest pain, arm or leg swelling. Prophylactic antithrombotic medicines should be 
recommended, especially in patients with additional thrombotic risk factors. The decision to take 
antithrombotic prophylactic measures should be made after careful assessment of an individual 
patient’s underlying risk factors. 
If the patient experiences any thromboembolic events, treatment must be discontinued and standard 
anticoagulation therapy started. Once the patient has been stabilised on the anticoagulation treatment 
and any complications of the thromboembolic event have been managed, the lenalidomide treatment 
may be restarted at the original dose dependent upon a benefit risk assessment. The patient should 
continue anticoagulation therapy during the course of lenalidomide treatment. 
Pulmonary hypertension  
Cases of pulmonary hypertension, some fatal, have been reported in patients treated with 
lenalidomide. Patients should be evaluated for signs and symptoms of underlying cardiopulmonary 
disease prior to initiating and during lenalidomide therapy. 
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 
The major dose limiting toxicities of lenalidomide include neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. A 
complete blood cell count, including white blood cell count with differential count, platelet count, 
haemoglobin, and haematocrit should be performed at baseline, every week for the first 8 weeks of 
lenalidomide treatment and  monthly thereafter to monitor for cytopenias. In mantle cell lymphoma 
patients, the monitoring scheme  should be every 2 weeks in cycles 3 and 4, and then at the start of 
each cycle. 
In follicular lymphoma, the monitoring scheme should be weekly for the first 3 weeks of cycle 1 
(28 days), every 2 weeks during cycles 2 through 4, and then at the start of each cycle thereafter. A 
dose interruption and/or a dose reduction may be required (see section 4.2).  
In case of neutropenia, the physician should consider the use of growth factors in patient management. 
Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes.  
Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including 
petechiae and epistaxis, especially in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products susceptible to 
induce bleeding (see section 4.8, Haemorrhagic disorders). 
Co-administration of lenalidomide with other myelosuppressive agents should be undertaken with 
caution.

•  Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with 
lenalidomide maintenance 
The adverse reactions from CALGB 100104 included events reported post-high dose melphalan and 
ASCT (HDM/ASCT) as well as events from the maintenance treatment period. A second analysis 
identified events that occurred after the start of maintenance treatment. In IFM 2005-02, the adverse 
reactions were from the maintenance treatment period only. 
Overall, Grade 4 neutropenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance 
arms compared to the placebo maintenance arms in the 2 studies evaluating lenalidomide maintenance 
in NDMM patients who have undergone ASCT (32.1% vs 26.7% [16.1% vs 1.8% after the start of 
maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 16.4 % vs 0.7 % in IFM 2005-02, respectively). 
Treatment-emergent AEs of neutropenia leading to lenalidomide discontinuation were reported in 
2.2 % of patients in CALGB 100104 and 2.4 % of patients in IFM 2005-02, respectively. Grade 4 
febrile neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the lenalidomide maintenance arms 
compared to placebo maintenance arms in both studies (0.4 % vs 0.5 % [0.4 % vs 0.5 % after the start 
of maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 0.3 % vs 0 % in IFM 2005-02, respectively). 
Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes, a treatment interruption and/or dose 
reduction may be required (see section 4.2). 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed at a higher frequency in the lenalidomide maintenance 
arms compared to the placebo maintenance arms in studies evaluating lenalidomide maintenance in 
NDMM patients who have undergone ASCT (37.5 % vs 30.3 % [17.9 % vs 4.1 % after the start of 
maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 13.0 % vs 2.9 % in IFM 2005-02, respectively). 
Patients and physicians are advised to be observant for signs and symptoms of bleeding, including 
petechiae and epistaxes, especially in patients receiving concomitant medicinal products susceptible to 
induce bleeding (see section 4.8, Haemorrhagic disorders). 
•  Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
Grade 4 neutropenia was observed at a lower frequency in the lenalidomide in combination with 
bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) arm compared to the Rd comparator arm (2.7 % vs 5.9 %) in 
the SWOG S0777 study. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the RVd 
arm and Rd arm (0.0 % vs 0.4 %). Patients should be advised to promptly report febrile episodes; a 
treatment interruption and/or dose reduction may be required (see section 4.2). 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed at a higher frequency in the RVd arm compared to the 
Rd comparator arm (17.2 % vs 9.4 %). 
•  Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone 
Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in the lenalidomide arms in combination with dexamethasone to a 
lesser extent than in the comparator arm (8.5 % in the Rd [continuous treatment] and Rd18 [treatment 
for 18 four-week cycles] compared with 15 % in the melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide arm, see 
section 4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were consistent with the comparator arm (0.6 % in 
the Rd and Rd18 lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared with 0.7 % in the 
melphalan/prednisone/thalidomide arm, see section 4.8). 
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed to a lesser extent in the Rd and Rd18 arms than in the 
comparator arm (8.1 % vs 11.1 %, respectively).

multiple myeloma patients is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (34.1 % in 
melphalan, prednisone and lenalidomide arm followed by lenalidomide [MPR+R] and melphalan, 
prednisone and lenalidomide followed by placebo [MPR+p] treated patients compared with 7.8 % in 
MPp+p-treated patients; see section 4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
infrequently (1.7 % in MPR+R/MPR+p treated patients compared to 0.0 % in MPp+p treated patients; 
see section 4.8). 
The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in multiple myeloma patients is 
associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (40.4 % in 
MPR+R/MPR+p treated patients, compared with 13.7 % in MPp+p-treated patients; see section 4.8). 
•  Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients with at least one 
prior therapy is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (5.1 % in 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared with 0.6 % in placebo/dexamethasone-treated 
patients; see section 4.8). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed infrequently (0.6 % in 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 0.0 % in placebo/dexamethasone treated 
patients; see section 4.8). 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with 
a higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9 % and 1.4 %, respectively, in 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3 % and 0.0 % in 
placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients; see section 4.8). 
•  Myelodysplastic syndromes 
Lenalidomide treatment in myelodysplastic syndromes patients is associated with a higher incidence 
of  Grade 3 and 4 neutropenia and thrombocytopenia compared to patients on placebo (see section 
4.8). 
•  Mantle cell lymphoma 
Lenalidomide treatment in  mantle cell lymphoma patients is  associated  with  a higher incidence of 
Grade 3  and 4 neutropenia compared with patients on the control arm (see section 4.8). 
•  Follicular lymphoma 
The combination of lenalidomide with rituximab in follicular lymphoma patients is associated with a 
higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia compared with patients on the placebo/rituximab arm. 
Febrile neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia were more commonly observed in the 
lenalidomide/ rituximab arm (see section 4.8).  
Thyroid disorders 
Cases of hypothyroidism and cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported. Optimal control of 
co-morbid conditions influencing thyroid function is recommended before start of treatment. Baseline 
and ongoing monitoring of thyroid function is recommended. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide, which is known to induce severe peripheral 
neuropathy. There was no increase in peripheral neuropathy observed with lenalidomide in 
combination with dexamethasone or melphalan and prednisone or lenalidomide monotherapy or with 
long term use of lenalidomide for the treatment of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma. 
The combination of lenalidomide with intravenous bortezomib and dexamethasone in multiple 
myeloma patients is associated with a higher frequency of peripheral neuropathy. The frequency was 
lower when bortezomib was administered subcutaneously. For additional information, see Section 4.8 
and the SmPC for bortezomib. 
Tumour flare reaction and tumour lysis syndrome 
Because lenalidomide has anti-neoplastic activity, the complications of tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) 
may occur. Cases of TLS and tumour flare reaction (TFR), including fatal cases, have been reported 
(see section 4.8). The patients at risk of TLS and TFR are those with high tumour burden prior to 
treatment. Caution should be practiced when introducing these patients to lenalidomide. These patients 
20 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
should be monitored closely, especially during the first cycle or dose-escalation, and appropriate 
precautions taken.  
•  Mantle cell lymphoma 
Careful monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended. Patients with high mantle cell lymphoma 
International Prognostic Index (MIPI) at diagnosis or bulky disease (at least one lesion that is ≥ 7 cm 
in the longest diameter) at baseline may be at risk of TFR. Tumour flare reaction may mimic 
progression of disease (PD). Patients in studies MCL-002 and MCL-001 that experienced Grade 1 and 
2 TFR were treated with corticosteroids, NSAIDs and/or narcotic analgesics for management of TFR 
symptoms. The decision to take therapeutic measures for TFR should be made after careful clinical 
assessment of the individual patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
•  Follicular lymphoma  
Careful monitoring and evaluation for TFR is recommended. Tumour flare may mimic PD. Patients 
who experienced Grade 1 and 2 TFR were treated with corticosteroids, NSAIDs and/or narcotic 
analgesics for management of TFR symptoms. The decision to take therapeutic measures for TFR 
should be made after careful clinical assessment of the individual patient (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Careful monitoring and evaluation for TLS is recommended. Patients should be well hydrated and 
receive TLS prophylaxis, in addition to weekly chemistry panels during the first cycle or longer, as 
clinically indicated (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Tumour burden 
•  Mantle cell lymphoma 
Lenalidomide  is  not  recommended  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  high  tumour  burden  if 
alternative  treatment options are available. 
Early death 
In study MCL-002 there was overall an apparent increase in early (within 20 weeks) deaths. Patients 
with high tumour burden at baseline are at increased risk of early death, there were 16/81 (20 %) early 
deaths  in  the  lenalidomide  arm  and  2/28  (7 %)  early  deaths  in  the  control  arm.  Within  52 weeks 
corresponding figures  were 32/81 (40 %) and 6/28 (21 %) (See section 5.1). 
Adverse events 
In  study MCL-002,  during treatment cycle  1,  11/81  (14 %) patients  with  high  tumour burden were 
withdrawn  from therapy in the lenalidomide arm vs. 1/28 (4 %) in the control group. The main reason 
for  treatment  withdrawal  for  patients  with  high  tumour  burden  during  treatment  cycle  1  in  the 
lenalidomide arm was  adverse events, 7/11 (64 %). 
Patients  with  high  tumour burden  should  therefore  be  closely  monitored  for  adverse  reactions  (see 
Section  4.8)  including  signs  of  tumour  flare  reaction  (TFR).  Please  refer  to  section  4.2  for  dose 
adjustments for TFR.  High tumour burden was defined as at least one lesion ≥ 5 cm in diameter or 3 
lesions ≥ 3 cm. 
Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions 
Cases of allergic reactions including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous 
reactions including SJS, TEN and DRESS have been reported in patients treated with lenalidomide 
(see section 4.8). Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of these reactions by their 
prescribers and should be told to seek medical attention immediately if they develop these symptoms. 
Lenalidomide must be discontinued for angioedema, anaphylactic reaction, exfoliative or bullous rash, 
or if SJS, TEN or DRESS is suspected, and should not be resumed following discontinuation for these 
reactions. Interruption or discontinuation of lenalidomide should be considered for other forms of skin 
reaction depending on severity. Patients who had previous allergic reactions while treated with 
thalidomide should be monitored closely, as a possible cross-reaction between lenalidomide and 
thalidomide has been reported in the literature. Patients with a history of severe rash associated with 
thalidomide treatment should not receive lenalidomide. 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Second primary malignancies 
An increase of second primary malignancies (SPM) has been observed in clinical trials in previously 
treated myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide/dexamethasone (3.98 per 100 person-years) 
compared to controls (1.38 per 100 person-years). Non-invasive SPM comprise basal cell or squamous 
cell skin cancers. Most of the invasive SPMs were solid tumour malignancies. 
In clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients not eligible for transplant, a 4.9-fold 
increase in incidence rate of hematologic SPM (cases of AML, MDS) has been observed in patients 
receiving lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone until progression (1.75 per 100 
person-years) compared with melphalan in combination with prednisone (0.36 per 100 person-years).  
A 2.12-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been observed in patients receiving 
lenalidomide (9 cycles) in combination with melphalan and prednisone (1.57 per 100 person-years) 
compared with melphalan in combination with prednisone (0.74 per 100 person-years).  
In patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until progression or for 18 
months, the hematologic SPM incidence rate (0.16 per 100 person-years) was not increased as 
compared to thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (0.79 per 100 person-years).  
A 1.3-fold increase in incidence rate of solid tumour SPM has been observed in patients receiving 
lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone until progression or for 18 months (1.58 per 100 
person-years) compared to thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (1.19 per 100 
person-years). 
In newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide in combination with 
bortezomib and dexamethasone, the hematologic SPM incidence rate was 0.00 – 0.16 per 100 person-
years and the incidence rate of solid tumour SPM was 0.21 – 1.04 per 100 person-years. 
The increased risk of secondary primary malignancies associated with lenalidomide is relevant also in 
the context of NDMM after stem cell transplantation. Though this risk is not yet fully characterized, it 
should be kept in mind when considering and using lenalidomide in this setting. 
The incidence rate of hematologic malignancies, most notably AML, MDS and B-cell malignancies 
(including Hodgkin’s lymphoma), was 1.31 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide arms and 0.58 
per 100 person-years for the placebo arms (1.02 per 100 person-years for patients exposed to 
lenalidomide after ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to lenalidomide after 
ASCT). The incidence rate of solid tumour SPMs was 1.36 per 100 person-years for the lenalidomide 
arms and 1.05 per 100 person-years for the placebo arms (1.26 per 100 person-years for patients 
exposed to lenalidomide after ASCT and 0.60 per 100 person-years for patients not-exposed to 
lenalidomide after ASCT).   
The risk of occurrence of hematologic SPM must be taken into account before initiating treatment 
with lenalidomide either in combination with melphalan or immediately following high-dose 
melphalan and ASCT. Physicians should carefully evaluate patients before and during treatment using 
standard cancer screening for occurrence of SPM and institute treatment as indicated. 
Progression to acute myeloid leukaemia in low- and intermediate-1-risk MDS 
•  Karyotype 
Baseline variables including complex cytogenetics are associated with progression to AML in 
subjects who  are transfusion dependent and have a Del (5q) abnormality. In a combined analysis of 
two clinical trials of  lenalidomide in low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes, 
subjects who had a complex  cytogenetics had the highest estimated 2-year cumulative risk of 
progression to AML (38.6 %). The estimated 2-year rate of progression to AML in patients with an 
isolated Del (5q) abnormality was 13.8 %, compared to  17.3 % for patients with Del (5q) and one 
additional cytogenetic abnormality. 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
As a consequence, the benefit/risk ratio of lenalidomide when MDS is associated with Del (5q) and 
complex  cytogenetics is unknown. 
•  TP53 status 
A TP53 mutation is present in 20 to 25 % of lower-risk MDS Del 5q patients and is associated with 
a higher  risk of progression to acute myeloid leukaemia (AML). In a post-hoc analysis of a clinical 
trial  of  lenalidomide  in  low-  or  intermediate-1-risk  myelodysplastic  syndromes  (MDS-004),  the 
estimated 2-year  rate of progression to AML was 27.5 % in patients with IHC-p53 positivity (1 % 
cut-off level of strong  nuclear staining, using immunohistochemical assessment of p53 protein as a 
surrogate for TP53 mutation  status) and 3.6 % in patients with IHC-p53 negativity (p=0.0038) (see 
section 4.8) 
Progression to other malignancies in mantle cell lymphoma 
In  mantle cell lymphoma,  AML, B-cell  malignancies and  non-melanoma skin  cancer (NMSC) are 
identified  risks. 
Second primary malignancies in follicular lymphoma 
In a relapsed/refractory iNHL study which included follicular lymphoma patients, no increased risk of 
SPMs in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm, compared to the placebo/rituximab arm, was observed. 
Hematologic SPM of AML occurred in 0.29 per 100 person-years in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm 
compared with 0.29 per 100 person-years in patients receiving placebo/rituximab. The incidence rate 
of hematologic plus solid tumour SPMs (excluding non-melanoma skin cancers) was 0.87 per 100 
person-years in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm, compared to 1.17 per 100 person-years in patients 
receiving placebo/rituximab with a median follow-up of 30.59  months (range 0.6 to 50.9 months).  
Non-melanoma skin cancers are identified risks and comprise squamous cell carcinomas of skin or 
basal cell carcinomas. 
Physicians should monitor patients for the development of SPMs. Both the potential benefit of 
lenalidomide and the risk of SPMs should be considered when considering treatment with 
lenalidomide. 
Hepatic disorders 
Hepatic  failure,  including  fatal  cases,  has  been  reported  in  patients  treated  with  lenalidomide  in 
combination therapy: acute hepatic failure, toxic hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, cholestatic hepatitis, and 
mixed  cytolytic/cholestatic  hepatitis  have  been  reported.  The  mechanisms  of  severe  drug-induced 
hepatotoxicity  remain  unknown  although,  in  some  cases,  pre-existing  viral  liver  disease,  elevated 
baseline liver enzymes, and possibly treatment with antibiotics might be risk factors. 
Abnormal liver function tests were commonly reported and were generally asymptomatic and reversible 
upon dosing interruption. Once parameters have returned to baseline, treatment at a lower dose may be 
considered.  
Lenalidomide is excreted by the kidneys. It is important to dose adjust patients with renal impairment 
in order to avoid plasma levels which may increase the risk for higher haematological adverse 
reactions or hepatotoxicity. Monitoring of liver function is recommended, particularly when there is a 
history of or concurrent viral liver infection or when lenalidomide is combined with medicinal 
products known to be associated with liver dysfunction. 
Infection with or without neutropenia 
Patients with multiple myeloma are prone to develop infections including pneumonia. A higher rate of 
infections was observed with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone than with MPT in 
patients with NDMM who are not eligible for transplant, and with lenalidomide maintenance 
compared to placebo in patients with NDMM who had undergone ASCT. Grade ≥ 3 infections 
occurred within the context of neutropenia in less than one-third of the patients. Patients with known 
risk factors for infections should be closely monitored. All patients should be advised to seek medical 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
attention promptly at the first sign of infection (eg, cough, fever, etc) thereby allowing for early 
management to reduce severity. 
Viral reactivation 
Cases of viral reactivation have been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, including serious 
cases of herpes zoster or hepatitis B virus (HBV) reactivation. 
Some of the cases of viral reactivation had a fatal outcome. 
Some of the cases of herpes zoster reactivation resulted in disseminated herpes zoster, meningitis 
herpes zoster or ophthalmic herpes zoster requiring a temporary hold or permanent discontinuation of 
the treatment with lenalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment. 
Reactivation of hepatitis B has been reported rarely in patients receiving lenalidomide who have 
previously been infected with the hepatitis B virus. Some of these cases have progressed to acute 
hepatic failure resulting in discontinuation of lenalidomide and adequate antiviral treatment. Hepatitis 
B virus status should be established before initiating treatment with lenalidomide. For patients who 
test positive for HBV infection, consultation with a physician with expertise in the treatment of 
hepatitis B is recommended. Caution should be exercised when lenalidomide is used in patients 
previously infected with HBV, including patients who are anti-HBc positive but HBsAg negative. 
These patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of active HBV infection 
throughout therapy. 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients 
There was a higher rate of intolerance (Grade 3 or 4 adverse events, serious adverse events, 
discontinuation) in patients with age > 75 years, ISS stage III, ECOG PS ≤ 2 or CLcr < 60 mL/min 
when lenalidomide is given in combination. Patients should be carefully assessed for their ability to 
tolerate lenalidomide in combination, with consideration to age, ISS stage III, ECOG PS≤ 2 or 
CLcr< 60 mL/min (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Cataract 
Cataract has been reported with a higher frequency in patients receiving lenalidomide in combination 
with dexamethasone particularly when used for a prolonged time. Regular monitoring of visual ability 
is recommended. 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) 
Cases of progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), including fatal cases, have been reported 
with lenalidomide. PML was reported several months to several years after starting the treatment with 
lenalidomide. Cases have generally been reported in patients taking concomitant dexamethasone or 
prior treatment with other immunosuppressive chemotherapy. Physicians should monitor patients at 
regular intervals and should consider PML in the differential diagnosis in patients with new or 
worsening neurological symptoms, cognitive or behavioural signs or symptoms. Patients should also 
be advised to inform their partner or caregivers about their treatment, since they may notice symptoms 
that the patient is not aware of.  
The evaluation for PML should be based on neurological examination, magnetic resonance imaging of 
the brain, and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JC virus (JCV) DNA by polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) or a brain biopsy with testing for JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. Additional 
follow-up and evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established.  
If PML is suspected, further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. If PML is 
confirmed, lenalidomide must be permanently discontinued. 
24 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lactose intolerance 
Lenalidomide Accord hard capsules contain lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of 
galactose intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this 
medicinal product.  
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Erythropoietic agents, or other agents that may increase the risk of thrombosis, such as hormone 
replacement therapy, should be used with caution in multiple myeloma patients receiving lenalidomide 
with dexamethasone (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
Oral contraceptives 
No interaction study has been performed with oral contraceptives. Lenalidomide is not an enzyme 
inducer. In an in vitro study with human hepatocytes, lenalidomide, at various concentrations tested 
did not induce CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5. Therefore, induction leading 
to reduced efficacy of medicinal products, including hormonal contraceptives, is not expected if 
lenalidomide is administered alone. However, dexamethasone is known to be a weak to moderate 
inducer of CYP3A4 and is likely to also affect other enzymes as well as transporters. It may not be 
excluded that the efficacy of oral contraceptives may be reduced during treatment. Effective measures 
to avoid pregnancy must be taken (see sections 4.4 and 4.6). 
Warfarin 
Co-administration of multiple 10 mg doses of lenalidomide had no effect on the single dose 
pharmacokinetics of R- and S- warfarin. Co-administration of a single 25 mg dose of warfarin had no 
effect on the pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide. However, it is not known whether there is an 
interaction during clinical use (concomitant treatment with dexamethasone). Dexamethasone is a weak 
to moderate enzyme inducer and its effect on warfarin is unknown. Close monitoring of warfarin 
concentration is advised during the treatment. 
Digoxin 
Concomitant administration with lenalidomide 10 mg once daily increased the plasma exposure of 
digoxin (0.5 mg, single dose) by 14 % with a 90 % CI (confidence interval) [0.52 %-28.2 %]. It is not 
known whether the effect will be different in the clinical use (higher lenalidomide doses and 
concomitant treatment with dexamethasone). Therefore, monitoring of the digoxin concentration is 
advised during lenalidomide treatment. 
Statins 
There is an increased risk of rhabdomyolysis when statins are administered with lenalidomide, which 
may be simply additive. Enhanced clinical and laboratory monitoring is warranted notably during the 
first weeks of treatment. 
Dexamethasone 
Co-administration of single or multiple doses of dexamethasone (40 mg once daily) has no clinically 
relevant effect on the multiple dose pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide (25 mg once daily). 
Interactions with P-glycoprotein (P-gp) inhibitors 
In vitro, lenalidomide is a substrate of P-gp, but is not a P-gp inhibitor. Co-administration of multiple 
doses of the strong P-gp inhibitor quinidine (600 mg, twice daily) or the moderate P-gp 
inhibitor/substrate temsirolimus (25 mg) has no clinically relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
lenalidomide (25 mg). Co-administration of lenalidomide does not alter the pharmacokinetics of 
temsirolimus. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Due to the teratogenic potential, lenalidomide must be prescribed under a Pregnancy Prevention 
Programme (see section 4.4) unless there is reliable evidence that the patient does not have 
childbearing potential. 
Women of childbearing potential / Contraception in males and females 
Women of childbearing potential should use effective method of contraception. If pregnancy occurs in 
a woman treated with lenalidomide, treatment must be stopped and the patient should be referred to a 
physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. If pregnancy occurs in a 
partner of a male patient taking lenalidomide, it is recommended to refer the female partner to a 
physician specialised or experienced in teratology for evaluation and advice. 
Lenalidomide is present in human semen at extremely low levels during treatment and is undetectable 
in human semen 3 days after stopping the substance in the healthy subject (see section 5.2). As a 
precaution and taking into account special populations with prolonged elimination time such as renal 
impairment, all male patients taking lenalidomide should use condoms throughout treatment duration, 
during dose interruption and for 1 week after cessation of treatment if their partner is pregnant or of 
childbearing potential and has no contraception. 
Pregnancy 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. 
Lenalidomide induced malformation in monkeys similar to those described with thalidomide (see 
section 5.3). Therefore, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide is expected and lenalidomide is 
contraindicated during pregnancy (see section 4.3). 
Breast-feeding 
It is not known whether lenalidomide is excreted in breast milk. Therefore breast-feeding should be 
discontinued during therapy with lenalidomide. 
Fertility 
A fertility study in rats with lenalidomide doses up to 500 mg/kg (approximately 200 to 500 times the 
human doses of 25 mg and 10 mg, respectively, based on body surface area) produced no adverse 
effects on fertility and no parental toxicity. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Lenalidomide has minor or moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines. Fatigue, 
dizziness, somnolence, vertigo and blurred vision have been reported with the use of lenalidomide. 
Therefore, caution is recommended when driving or operating machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide 
maintenance 
26 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A conservative approach was applied to determine the adverse reactions from CALGB 100104. The 
adverse reactions described in Table 1 included events reported post-HDM/ASCT as well as events 
from the maintenance treatment period. A second analysis that identified events that occurred after the 
start of maintenance treatment suggests that the frequencies described in Table 1 may be higher than 
actually observed during the maintenance treatment period. In IFM 2005-02, the adverse reactions 
were from the maintenance treatment period only. 
The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥ 5%) with lenalidomide maintenance than 
placebo were: 
•  Pneumonia (10.6 %; combined term) from IFM 2005-02 
•  Lung infection (9.4 % [9.4 % after the start of maintenance treatment]) from CALGB 100104 
In the IFM 2005-02 study, the adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide 
maintenance than placebo were neutropenia (60.8 %), bronchitis (47.4 %), diarrhoea (38.9 %), 
nasopharyngitis (34.8 %), muscle spasms (33.4 %), leucopenia (31.7 %), asthenia (29.7 %), cough 
(27.3 %), thrombocytopenia (23.5 %), gastroenteritis (22.5 %) and pyrexia (20.5 %). 
In the CALGB 100104 study, the adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide 
maintenance than placebo were neutropenia (79.0 % [71.9 % after the start of maintenance 
treatment]), thrombocytopenia (72.3 % [61.6 %]), diarrhoea (54.5 % [46.4 %]), rash (31.7 % 
[25.0 %]), upper respiratory tract infection (26.8 % [26.8 %]), fatigue (22.8 % [17.9 %]), leucopenia 
(22.8 % [18.8 %]) and anaemia (21.0 % [13.8 %]). 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are not eligible for transplant receiving lenalidomide 
in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
In the SWOG S0777 study, the serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥ 5%) with 
lenalidomide in combination with intravenous bortezomib and dexamethasone than with lenalidomide 
in combination with dexamethasone were:  
•  Hypotension (6.5 %), lung infection (5.7 %), dehydration (5.0 %) 
The adverse reactions observed more frequently with lenalidomide in combination with bortezomib 
and dexamethasone than with lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone were: Fatigue 
(73.7 %), peripheral neuropathy (71.8 %), thrombocytopenia (57.6 %), constipation (56.1 %), 
hypocalcaemia (50.0 %).  
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with low dose dexamethasone 
The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥ 5 %) with lenalidomide in combination 
with low dose dexamethasone (Rd and Rd18) than with melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) 
were: 
•  Pneumonia (9.8 %) 
•  Renal failure (including acute) (6.3 %) 
The adverse reactions observed more frequently with Rd or Rd18 than MPT were: diarrhoea (45.5 %), 
fatigue (32.8 %), back pain (32.0 %), asthenia (28.2 %), insomnia (27.6 %), rash (24.3 %), decreased 
appetite (23.1 %), cough (22.7 %), pyrexia (21.4 %), and muscle spasms (20.5 %). 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone 
The serious adverse reactions observed more frequently (≥ 5 %) with melphalan, prednisone and 
lenalidomide followed by lenalidomide maintenance (MPR+R) or melphalan, prednisone and 
lenalidomide followed by placebo (MPR+p) than melphalan, prednisone and placebo followed by 
placebo (MPp+p) were: 
•  Febrile neutropenia (6.0 %) 
•  Anaemia (5.3 %) 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The adverse reactions observed more frequently with MPR+R or MPR+p than MPp+p were: 
neutropenia (83.3 %), anaemia (70.7 %), thrombocytopenia (70.0 %), leucopenia (38.8 %), 
constipation (34.0 %), diarrhoea (33.3 %), rash (28.9 %), pyrexia (27.0 %), peripheral oedema 
(25.0 %), cough (24.0 %), decreased appetite (23.7 %), and asthenia (22.0 %). 
Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy 
In two phase 3 placebo-controlled studies, 353 patients with multiple myeloma were exposed to the 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone combination and 351 to the placebo/dexamethasone combination.  
The most serious adverse reactions observed more frequently in lenalidomide/dexamethasone than 
placebo/dexamethasone combination were: 
•  Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) (see section 4.4) 
•  Grade 4 neutropenia (see section 4.4). 
The observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently with lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone than placebo and dexamethasone in pooled multiple myeloma clinical trials (MM-009 
and MM-010) were fatigue (43.9 %), neutropenia (42.2 %), constipation (40.5 %), diarrhoea (38.5 %), 
muscle cramp (33.4 %), anaemia (31.4 %), thrombocytopenia (21.5 %), and rash (21.2 %). 
Myelodysplastic syndromes 
The overall safety profile of lenalidomide in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes is based on data 
from  a total of 286 patients from one phase 2 study and one phase 3 study (see section 5.1). In the 
phase 2, all 148  patients were on lenalidomide treatment. In the phase 3 study, 69 patients were on 
lenalidomide 5 mg, 69  patients on lenalidomide 10 mg and 67 patients were on placebo during the 
double-blind phase of the study. 
Most  adverse  reactions  tended  to  occur  during  the  first  16 weeks  of  therapy  with 
lenalidomide.  Serious adverse reactions include: 
•  Venous thromboembolism (deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism) (see section 4.4) 
•  Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia and Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (see section 4.4). 
The most commonly observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide 
groups  compared to the control arm in the phase 3 study were neutropenia (76.8 %), thrombocytopenia 
(46.4 %), diarrhoea (34.8 %), constipation (19.6 %), nausea (19.6 %), pruritus (25.4 %), rash (18.1 %), 
fatigue (18.1%)  and muscle spasms (16.7%). 
Mantle cell lymphoma 
The overall safety profile of lenalidomide in patients with mantle cell lymphoma is based on data from 
254  patients from a phase 2 randomised, controlled study MCL-002 (see section 5.1). 
Additionally, adverse drug reactions from supportive study MCL-001 have been included in table 3. 
The serious adverse reactions observed  more frequently in  study MCL-002  (with  a difference of at 
least 2  percentage points) in the lenalidomide arm compared with the control arm were: 
•  Neutropenia (3.6 %) 
•  Pulmonary embolism (3.6 %) 
•  Diarrhoea (3.6 %) 
The most frequently observed adverse reactions which occurred more frequently in the lenalidomide 
arm  compared with the control arm in study MCL-002 were neutropenia (50.9 %), anaemia (28.7 %), 
diarrhoea  (22.8 %),  fatigue  (21.0 %),  constipation  (17.4 %),  pyrexia  (16.8 %),  and  rash  (including 
dermatitis allergic) 
(16.2 %). 
In study MCL-002 there was overall an apparent increase in early (within 20 weeks) deaths. Patients 
with  high tumour burden at baseline are at increased risk of early death, 16/81 (20 %) early deaths in 
the  lenalidomide arm and 2/28 (7 %) early deaths in the control arm. Within 52 weeks corresponding 
figures  were 32/81 (39.5 %) and 6/28 (21 %) (see section 5.1). 
28 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
During treatment cycle 1, 11/81 (14 %) patients with high tumour burden were withdrawn from therapy 
in the  lenalidomide arm vs. 1/28 (4 %) in the control group. The main reason for treatment withdrawal 
for patients  with high tumour burden during treatment cycle 1 in the lenalidomide arm was adverse 
events, 7/11 (64 %).  High tumour burden was defined as at least one lesion ≥ 5 cm in diameter or 3 
lesions ≥ 3 cm. 
Follicular lymphoma  
The overall safety profile of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab in patients with previously 
treated follicular lymphoma is based on data from 294 patients from a Phase 3 randomised, controlled 
study NHL-007. Additionally, adverse drug reactions from supportive study NHL-008 have been 
included in Table 5. 
The serious adverse reactions observed most frequently (with a difference of at least 1 percentage 
point) in study NHL-007 in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm compared with the placebo/rituximab arm 
were: 
•  Febrile neutropenia (2.7 %) 
•  Pulmonary embolism (2.7 %) 
•  Pneumonia (2.7 %) 
In the NHL-007 study the adverse reactions observed more frequently in the lenalidomide/rituximab 
arm compared with the placebo/rituximab arm (with at least 2 % higher frequency between arms) were 
neutropenia (58.2 %), diarrhoea (30.8 %), leucopenia (28.8 %), constipation (21.9 %), cough (21.9 %) 
and fatigue (21.9 %). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The adverse reactions observed in patients treated with lenalidomide are listed below by system organ 
class and frequency. Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in order of 
decreasing seriousness. Frequencies are defined as: very common (≥ 1/10); common (≥ 1/100 to 
< 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000), not 
known (cannot be estimated from the available data). 
Adverse reactions have been included under the appropriate category in the table below according to 
the highest frequency observed in any of the main clinical trials. 
Tabulated summary for monotherapy in MM 
The following table is derived from data gathered during NDMM studies in patients who have 
undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide maintenance. The data were not adjusted according to the 
longer duration of treatment in the lenalidomide-containing arms continued until disease progression 
versus the placebo arms in the pivotal multiple myeloma studies (see section 5.1).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Teratogenicity 
Lenalidomide is structurally related to thalidomide. Thalidomide is a known human teratogenic active 
substance that causes severe life-threatening birth defects. In monkeys, lenalidomide induced 
malformations similar to those described with thalidomide (see sections 4.6 and 5.3). If lenalidomide 
is taken during pregnancy, a teratogenic effect of lenalidomide in humans is expected.

Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who have undergone ASCT treated with lenalidomide 
maintenance 
Lenalidomide maintenance after ASCT is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia 
compared to placebo maintenance (32.1 % vs 26.7 % [16.1 % vs 1.8 % after the start of maintenance 
treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 16.4 % vs 0.7 % in IFM 2005-02, respectively). Treatment-
emergent AEs of neutropenia leading to lenalidomide discontinuation were reported in 2.2 % of 
patients in CALGB 100104 and 2.4 % of patients in IFM 2005-02, respectively. Grade 4 febrile 
neutropenia was reported at similar frequencies in the lenalidomide maintenance arms compared to 
placebo maintenance arms in both studies (0.4 % vs 0.5 % [0.4 % vs 0.5 % after the start of 
maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 0.3 % vs 0 % in IFM 2005-02, respectively). 
Lenalidomide maintenance after ASCT is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 3 or 4 
thrombocytopenia compared to placebo maintenance (37.5 % vs 30.3 % [17.9 % vs 4.1 % after the 
start of maintenance treatment] in CALGB 100104 and 13.0 % vs 2.9 % in IFM 2005-02, 
respectively). 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients who are not eligible for transplant receiving lenalidomide 
in combination with bortezomib and dexamethasone 
Grade 4 neutropenia was observed in the RVd arm to a lesser extent than in the Rd comparator arm 
(2.7 % vs 5.9 %) in the SWOG S0777 study. Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was reported at similar 
frequencies in the RVd arm compared to the Rd arm (0.0 % vs 0.4 %).  
Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in the RVd arm to a greater extent than in the Rd 
comparator arm (17.2 % vs 9.4 %). 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients 
is associated with a lower frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia (8.5 % in Rd and Rd18, compared with 
MPT (15 %). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia was observed infrequently (0.6 % in Rd and Rd18 compared 
with 0.7 % in MPT). 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patients 
is associated with a lower frequency of Grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia (8.1 % in Rd and Rd18) 
compared with MPT (11.1 %). 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma: patients who are not eligible for transplant treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone 
The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma patients is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 4 neutropenia (34.1 % in 
MPR+R/MPR+p) compared with MPp+p (7.8 %). There was a higher frequency of Grade 4 febrile 
neutropenia observed (1.7 % in MPR+R/MPR+p compared to 0.0 % in MPp+p).  
The combination of lenalidomide with melphalan and prednisone in newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma patients is associated with a higher frequency of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia 
(40.4 % in MPR+R/MPR+p) compared with MPp+p (13.7 %).  
Multiple myeloma: patients with at least one prior therapy 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with 
a higher incidence of Grade 4 neutropenia (5.1 % in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients 
compared with 0.6 % in placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients). Grade 4 febrile neutropenia 
episodes were observed infrequently (0.6 % in lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared 
to 0.0 % in placebo/dexamethasone treated patients). 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The combination of lenalidomide with dexamethasone in multiple myeloma patients is associated with 
a higher incidence of Grade 3 and Grade 4 thrombocytopenia (9.9 % and 1.4 %, respectively, in 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone-treated patients compared to 2.3 % and 0.0 % in 
placebo/dexamethasone-treated patients). 
•  Myelodysplastic syndromes patients 
In myelodysplastic syndromes patients, lenalidomide is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 
or  4  neutropenia  (74.6 %  in  lenalidomide-treated  patients  compared  with  14.9 %  in  patients  on 
placebo in the  phase 3 study). Grade 3 or 4 febrile neutropenia episodes were observed in 2.2 % of 
lenalidomide-treated  patients  compared  with  0.0 %  in  patients  on  placebo).  Lenalidomide  is 
associated with a higher incidence of  Grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia (37 % in lenalidomide-treated 
patients compared with 1.5 % in patients on  placebo in the phase 3 study). 
•  Mantle cell lymphoma patients 
In mantle cell lymphoma patients, lenalidomide is associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3 or 4 
neutropenia (43.7 % in lenalidomide-treated patients compared with 33.7 % in patients in the control 
arm  in  the  phase  2  study).  Grade 3  or  4  febrile  neutropenia  episodes  were  observed  in  6.0 %  of 
lenalidomide-treated  patients compared with 2.4 % in patients on control arm. 
•  Follicular lymphoma patients 
The combination of lenalidomide with rituximab in follicular lymphoma is associated with a higher 
rate of grade 3 or grade 4 neutropenia (50.7 % in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared 
with 12.2 % in placebo/rituximab treated patients). All grade 3 or 4 neutropenia were reversible 
through dose interruption, reduction and/or supportive care with growth factors. Additionally, febrile 
neutropenia was observed infrequently (2.7 % in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared 
with 0.7 % in placebo/rituximab treated patients).  
Lenalidomide in combination with rituximab is also associated with a higher incidence of grade 3 or 
4 thrombocytopenia (1.4 % in lenalidomide/rituximab treated patients compared to 0 % in 
placebo/rituximab patients).  
Venous thromboembolism 
An increased risk of DVT and PE is associated with the use of the combination of lenalidomide with 
dexamethasone in patients with multiple myeloma, and to a lesser extent in patients treated with 
lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone or in patients with multiple myeloma, 
myelodysplastic syndromes and mantle cell lymphoma treated with lenalidomide monotherapy 
(see section 4.5).  
Concomitant administration of erythropoietic agents or previous history of DVT may also increase 
thrombotic risk in these patients. 
Myocardial infarction 
Myocardial infarction has been reported in patients receiving lenalidomide, particularly in those with 
known risk factors. 
Haemorrhagic disorders 
Haemorrhagic disorders are listed under several system organ classes: Blood and lymphatic system 
disorders; nervous system disorders (intracranial haemorrhage); respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (epistaxis); gastrointestinal disorders (gingival bleeding, haemorrhoidal haemorrhage, rectal 
haemorrhage); renal and urinary disorders (haematuria); injury, poisoning and procedural 
complications (contusion) and vascular disorders (ecchymosis). 
Allergic reactions and severe skin reactions 
Cases of allergic reactions including angioedema, anaphylactic reaction and severe cutaneous 
reactions including SJS, TEN and DRESS have been reported with the use of lenalidomide. A possible 
cross-reaction between lenalidomide and thalidomide has been reported in the literature. Patients with 
a history of severe rash associated with thalidomide treatment should not receive lenalidomide (see 
section 4.4). 
42 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Second primary malignancies 
In clinical trials in previously treated myeloma patients with lenalidomide/dexamethasone compared 
to controls, mainly comprising of basal cell or squamous cell skin cancers. 
Acute myeloid leukaemia  
•  Multiple myeloma 
Cases of AML have been observed in clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple myeloma in patients 
taking lenalidomide treatment in combination with melphalan or immediately following HDM/ASCT 
(see section 4.4). This increase was not observed in clinical trials of newly diagnosed multiple 
myeloma in patients taking lenalidomide in combination with dexamethasone compared to 
thalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone. 
•  Myelodysplastic syndromes 
Baseline variables including complex cytogenetics and TP53 mutation are associated with progression 
to  AML in subjects who are transfusion dependent and have a Del (5q) abnormality (see section 4.4). 
The  estimated 2-year cumulative risk of progression to AML were 13.8 % in patients with an isolated 
Del (5q)  abnormality compared to 17.3 % for patients with Del (5q) and one additional cytogenetic 
abnormality and  38.6 % in patients with a complex karyotype. 
In a post-hoc analysis of a clinical trial of lenalidomide in myelodysplastic syndromes, the estimated 
rate of progression to  AML was 27.5 % in patients with  IHC-p53 positivity  and 3.6 % in 
2-year 
patients with IHC-  p53 negativity (p=0.0038). In the patients with IHC-p53 positivity, a lower rate 
of progression to AML was  observed amongst patients who achieved a transfusion independence 
(TI) response (11.1 %) compared to a  non-responder (34.8 %). 
Hepatic disorders 
The following post-marketing adverse reactions have been reported (frequency unknown): acute 
hepatic failure and cholestasis (both potentially fatal), toxic hepatitis, cytolytic hepatitis, mixed 
cytolytic/cholestatic hepatitis. 
Rhabdomyolysis 
Rare cases of rhabdomyolysis have been observed, some of them when lenalidomide is administered 
with a statin. 
Thyroid disorders  
Cases of hypothyroidism and cases of hyperthyroidism have been reported (see section 4.4 Thyroid 
disorders). 
Tumour flare reaction and tumour lysis syndrome 
In study MCL-002, approximately 10 % of lenalidomide-treated patients experienced TFR compared 
in  the  control  arm.  The  majority  of  the  events  occurred  in  cycle 1,  all  were  assessed  as 
to  0 % 
treatment-related,  and 
the  majority  of  the  reports  were  grade 1  or  2. Patients  with  high  MIPI  at 
diagnosis or bulky disease (at least  one lesion that is ≥ 7 cm in the longest diameter) at baseline may 
be at risk of TFR. In study MCL-002, TLS  was reported for one patient in each of the two treatment 
arms. In the supportive study MCL-001,  approximately 10 % of subjects experienced TFR; all report 
were grade 1 or 2 in severity and all were  assessed as treatment-related. The majority of the events 
occurred in cycle 1. There were no reports of TLS  in study MCL-001 (see section 4.4). 
In study NHL-007, TFR was reported in 19/146 (13.0 %) of patients in the lenalidomide/rituximab 
arm versus 1/148 (0.7 %) patients in the placebo/rituximab arm. Most TFRs (18 out of 19) reported in 
the lenalidomide/rituximab arm occurred during first two cycles of treatment. One FL patient in the 
lenalidomide/rituximab arm experienced a Grade 3 TFR event versus no patients in the 
placebo/rituximab arm. In study NHL-008, 7/177 (4.0 %) of FL patients experienced TFR; (3 reports 
were Grade 1 and 4 reports were Grade 2 severity); while 1 report was considered serious. In study 
NHL-007, TLS occurred in 2 FL patients (1.4 %) in the lenalidomide/rituximab arm and no FL 
43 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients in the placebo/rituximab arm; neither patient had a Grade 3 or 4 event. TLS occurred in 1 FL 
patient (0.6 %) in study NHL-008. This single event was identified as a serious, Grade 3 adverse 
reaction. For study NHL-007 no patients had to discontinue lenalidomide/rituximab therapy due to 
TFR or TLS. 
Gastrointestinal disorders 
Gastrointestinal perforations have been reported during treatment with lenalidomide. Gastrointestinal 
perforations may lead to septic complications and may be associated with fatal outcome. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no specific experience in the management of lenalidomide overdose in patients, although in 
dose-ranging studies some patients were exposed to up to 150 mg, and in single-dose studies, some 
patients were exposed to up to 400 mg. The dose limiting toxicity in these studies was essentially 
haematological. In the event of overdose, supportive care is advised.  
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Immunosuppressants, Other immunosuppressants, ATC code: L04AX04. 
Mechanism of action 
Lenalidomide binds directly to cereblon, a component of a cullin ring E3 ubiquitin ligase enzyme 
complex that includes deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage-binding protein 1(DDB1), cullin 4 
(CUL4), and regulator of cullins 1 (Roc1). In haematopoietic cells, lenalidomide binding to cereblon 
recruits substrate proteins Aiolos and Ikaros lymphoid transcriptional factors, leading to their 
ubiquitination and subsequent degradation resulting in direct cytotoxic and immunomodulatory 
effects. 
Specifically, lenalidomide inhibits proliferation and enhances apoptosis of certain haematopoietic 
tumour cells (including MM plasma tumour cells, follicular lymphoma tumour cells and those with 
deletions of  chromosome 5), enhances T cell- and Natural Killer (NK) cell-mediated immunity and 
increases the number of NK, T and NK T cells. In MDS Del (5q), lenalidomide selectively inhibits the 
abnormal clone by  increasing the apoptosis of Del (5q) cells. 
The combination of lenalidomide and rituximab increases ADCC and direct tumor apoptosis in 
follicular lymphoma cells. 
The lenalidomide mechanism of action also includes additional activities such as anti-angiogenic and 
pro-erythropoietic properties. Lenalidomide inhibits angiogenesis by blocking the migration and 
adhesion of endothelial cells and the formation of microvessels, augments foetal haemoglobin 
production by CD34+ haematopoietic stem cells, and inhibits production of pro-inflammatory 
cytokines (e.g., TNF-α and IL-6) by monocytes. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Lenalidomide efficacy and safety have been evaluated in six phase 3 studies in newly diagnosed 
multiple myeloma, two phase 3 studies in relapsed refractory multiple myeloma, one phase 3 study and 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
one phase 2  study in myelodysplastic syndromes and one phase 2 study in mantle cell lymphoma and 
one phase 3 and one phase 3b study in iNHL as described below. 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma 
•  Lenalidomide maintenance in patients who have undergone ASCT 
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide maintenance was assessed in two phase 3 multicentre, 
randomised, double-blind 2-arm, parallel group, placebo-controlled studies: CALGB 100104 and IFM 
2005-02 
CALGB 100104 
Patients between 18 and 70 years of age with active MM requiring treatment and without prior 
progression after initial treatment were eligible. 
Patients were randomised 1:1 within 90-100 days after ASCT to receive either lenalidomide or placebo 
maintenance. The maintenance dose was 10 mg once daily on days 1-28 of repeated 28-day cycles 
(increased up to 15 mg once daily after 3 months in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity), and 
treatment was continued until disease progression. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS) from randomisation to 
the date of progression or death, whichever occurred first; the study was not powered for the overall 
survival endpoint. In total 460 patients were randomised: 231 patients to lenalidomide and 229 patients 
to placebo. The demographic and disease-related characteristics were balanced across both arms. 
The study was unblinded upon the recommendations of the data monitoring committee after 
surpassing the threshold for a preplanned interim analysis of PFS. After unblinding, patients in the 
placebo arm were allowed to cross over to receive lenalidomide before disease progression. 
The results of PFS at unblinding, following a preplanned interim analysis, using a cut-off of 17 
December 2009 (15.5 months follow up) showed a 62 % reduction in risk of disease progression or 
death favouring lenalidomide (HR = 0.38; 95 % CI 0.27, 0.54; p < 0.001). The median overall PFS 
was 33.9 months (95 % CI NE, NE) in the lenalidomide arm versus 19.0 months (95 % CI 16.2, 25.6) 
in the placebo arm.  
The PFS benefit was observed both in the subgroup of patients with CR and in the subgroup of 
patients who had not achieved a CR. 
The results for the study, using a cut-off of 1 February 2016, are presented in Table 7

Data cuts: 17 Dec 2009 and 01 Feb 2016  
IFM 2005-02 
Patients aged < 65 years at diagnosis who had undergone ASCT and had achieved at least a stable 
disease response at the time of hematologic recovery were eligible. Patients were randomised 1:1 to 
receive either lenalidomide or placebo maintenance (10 mg once daily on days 1-28 of repeated 28-
day cycles increased up to 15 mg once daily after 3 months in the absence of dose-limiting toxicity) 
following 2 courses of lenalidomide consolidation (25 mg/day, days 1-21 of a 28-day cycle). 
Treatment was to be continued until disease progression. 
The primary endpoint was PFS defined from randomisation to the date of progression or death, 
whichever occurred first; the study was not powered for the overall survival endpoint. In total 
614 patients were randomised: 307 patients to lenalidomide and 307 patients to placebo. 
The study was unblinded upon the recommendations of the data monitoring committee after 
surpassing the threshold for a preplanned interim analysis of PFS. After unblinding, patients receiving 
placebo were not crossed over to lenalidomide therapy prior to progressive disease. The lenalidomide 
arm was discontinued, as a proactive safety measure, after observing an imbalance of SPMs (see 
section 4.4). 
The results of PFS at unblinding, following a preplanned interim analysis, using a cut-off of 7 July 
2010 (31.4 months follow up) showed a 48 % reduction in risk of disease progression or death 
favoring lenalidomide (HR = 0.52; 95 % CI 0.41, 0.66; p < 0.001). The median overall PFS was 
40.1 months (95 % CI 35.7, 42.4) in the lenalidomide arm versus 22.8 months (95 % CI 20.7, 27.4) in 
the placebo arm. 
The PFS benefit was less in the subgroup of patients with CR than in the subgroup of patients who had 
not achieved a CR. 
The updated PFS, using a cut-off of 1 February 2016 (96.7 months follow up) continues to show a PFS 
advantage: HR = 0.57 (95 % CI 0.47, 0.68; p < 0.001). The median overall PFS was 44.4 months 
(39.6, 52.0) in the lenalidomide arm versus 23.8 months (95 % CI 21.2, 27.3) in the placebo arm. For 
PFS2, the observed HR was 0.80 (95 % CI 0.66, 0.98; p = 0.026) for lenalidomide versus placebo. The 
median overall PFS2 was 69.9 months (95 % CI 58.1, 80.0) in the lenalidomide arm versus 
58.4 months (95 % CI 51.1, 65.0) in the placebo arm. For OS, the observed HR was 0.90 (95 % CI 
0.72, 1.13; p = 0.355) for lenalidomide versus placebo. The median overall survival time was 
105.9 months (95 % CI 88.8, NE) in the lenalidomide arm versus 88.1 months (95 % CI 80.7, 108.4) 
in the placebo arm. 
Lenalidomide in combination  with bortezomib and dexamethasone  in patients who are not eligible 
for stem cell transplantation 
The SWOG S0777 study evaluated the addition of bortezomib to a foundation of lenalidomide and 
dexamethasone, as initial treatment, followed by continued Rd until disease progression, in patients 
with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are either ineligible for transplant or eligible for 
transplant with no plan to undertake immediate transplant.  
Patients in the lenalidomide, bortezomib and dexamethasone (RVd) arm received lenalidomide 
25 mg/day orally on days 1-14, intravenous bortezomib 1.3 mg/m2 on days 1, 4, 8, and 11, and 
dexamethasone 20 mg/day orally on days 1, 2, 4, 5, 8, 9, 11, and 12 of repeated 21-day cycles for up to 
eight 21-day cycles (24 weeks). Patients in the lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) arm received 
lenalidomide 25 mg/day orally on days 1-21, and dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on days 1, 8, 15, 
and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles for up to six 28-day cycles (24 weeks). Patients in both arms took 
continued Rd: lenalidomide 25 mg/day orally on days 1-21 and dexamethasone 40 mg/day orally on 
46 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of repeated 28-day cycles. Treatment was to be continued until disease 
progression. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 523 patients 
were enrolled into the study, with 263 patients randomised to RVd and 260 patients randomised to Rd. 
The demographics and disease-related baseline characteristics of the patients were well balanced 
between arms.  
The results of PFS, as assessed by IRAC, at the time of the primary analysis, using a cut-off of 05 
November 2015 (50.6 months follow up) showed a 24 % reduction in risk of disease progression or 
death favouring RVd (HR = 0.76; 95 % CI 0.61, 0.94; p = 0.010). The median overall PFS was 
42.5 months (95 % CI 34.0, 54.8) in the RVd arm versus 29.9 months (95 % CI 25.6, 38.2) in the Rd 
arm. The benefit was observed regardless of eligibility for stem cell transplant. 
The results for the study, using a cut-off of 01 December 2016, where the median follow-up time for 
all surviving subjects was 69.0 months, are presented in Table 8. The benefit favouring RVd was 
observed regardless of eligibility for stem cell transplant.

•  Lenalidomide in combination  with dexamethasone  in patients who are not eligible for stem cell 
transplantation 
The safety and efficacy of lenalidomide was assessed in a phase 3, multicentre, randomised, open-
label, 3-arm study (MM-020) of patients who were at least 65 years of age or older or, if younger than 
65 years of age, were not candidates for stem cell transplantation because they declined to undergo 
stem cell transplantation or stem cell transplantation is not available to the patient due to cost or other 
reason.The study (MM-020) compared lenalidomide and dexamethasone (Rd) given for 2 different 
durations of time (i.e., until progressive disease [Arm Rd] or for up to eighteen 28-day cycles 
[72 weeks, Arm Rd18]) to melphalan, prednisone and thalidomide (MPT) for a maximum of twelve 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
42-day cycles (72 weeks). Patients were randomised (1:1:1) to 1 of 3 treatment arms. Patients were 
stratified at randomisation by age (≤ 75 versus > 75 years), stage (ISS Stages I and II versus Stage III), 
and country. 
Patients in the Rd and Rd18 arms took lenalidomide 25 mg once daily on days 1 to 21 of 28-day cycles 
according to protocol arm. Dexamethasone 40 mg was dosed once daily on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of 
each 28-day cycle. Initial dose and regimen for Rd and Rd18 were adjusted according to age and renal 
function (see section 4.2). Patients > 75 years received a dexamethasone dose of 20 mg once daily on 
days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28-day cycle. All patients received prophylactic anticoagulation (low 
molecular weight heparin, warfarin, heparin, low-dose aspirin) during the study. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 1623 patients 
were enrolled into the study, with 535 patients randomised to Rd, 541 patients randomised to Rd18 
and 547 patients randomised to MPT. The demographics and disease-related baseline characteristics of 
the patients were well balanced in all 3 arms. In general, study subjects had advanced-stage disease: of 
the total study population, 41 % had ISS stage III, 9 % had severe renal insufficiency (creatinine 
clearance [CLcr] < 30 mL/min). The median age was 73 in the 3 arms. 
In an updated analysis of PFS, PFS2 and OS using a cut off of 3 March 2014 where the median 
follow-up time for all surviving subjects was 45.5 months, the results of the study are presented in

Lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone followed by maintenance therapy in 
patients who are not eligible for transplant 
The safety and efficacy of lenalidomide was assessed in a phase 3 multicentre, randomised double 
blind 3 arm study (MM-015) of patients who were 65 years or older and had a serum creatinine 
< 2.5 mg/dL. The study compared lenalidomide in combination with melphalan and prednisone (MPR) 
with or without lenalidomide maintenance therapy until disease progression, to that of melphalan and 
prednisone for a maximum of 9  cycles. Patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to one of 3 treatment 
arms. Patients were stratified at randomisation by age (≤ 75 vs. > 75 years) and stage (ISS; Stages I 
and II vs. stage III). 
This study investigated the use of combination therapy of MPR (melphalan 0.18 mg/kg orally on 
days 1 to 4 of repeated 28-day cycles; prednisone 2 mg/kg orally on days 1 to 4 of repeated 28-day 
cycles; and lenalidomide 10 mg/day orally on days 1 to 21 of repeated 28-day cycles) for induction 
therapy, up to 9 cycles. Patients who completed 9 cycles or who were unable to complete 9 cycles due 
to intolerance proceeded to maintenance therapy starting with lenalidomide 10 mg orally on days 1 to 
21 of repeated 28-day cycles until disease progression. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the study was progression free survival (PFS). In total 459 patients 
were enrolled into the study, with 152 patients randomised to MPR+R, 153 patients randomised to 
MPR+p and 154 patients randomised to MPp+p. The demographics and disease-related baseline 
characteristics of the patients were well balanced in all 3 arms; notably, approximately 50 % of the 
patients enrolled in each arm had the following characteristics; ISS Stage III, and creatinine clearance 
< 60 mL/min. The median age was 71 in the MPR+R and MPR+p arms and 72 in the MPp+p arm. 
In an analysis of PFS, PFS2, OS using a cut-off of April 2013 where the median follow up time for all 
surviving subjects was 62.4 months, the results of the study are presented in Table 10:

Supportive newly diagnosed multiple myeloma studies 
An open-label, randomised, multicentre, phase 3 study (ECOG E4A03) was conducted in 445 patients 
with newly diagnosed multiple myeloma; 222 patients were randomised to the lenalidomide/low dose 
dexamethasone arm, and 223 were randomised to the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm. 
Patients randomised to the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm received lenalidomide 
25 mg/day, days 1 to 21 every 28 days plus dexamethasone 40 mg/day on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 
to 20 every 28 days for the first four cycles. Patients randomised to the lenalidomide/low dose 
dexamethasone arm received lenalidomide 25 mg/day, days 1 to 21 every 28 days plus low dose 
dexamethasone – 40 mg/day on days 1, 8, 15, and 22 every 28 days. In the lenalidomide/low dose 
dexamethasone group, 20 patients (9.1 %) underwent at least one dose interruption compared to 
65 patients (29.3 %) in the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm. 
In a post-hoc analysis, lower mortality was observed in the lenalidomide/low dose dexamethasone arm 
6.8 % (15/220) compared to the lenalidomide/standard dose dexamethasone arm 19.3 % (43/223), in 
the newly diagnosed multiple myeloma patient population, with a median follow up of 72.3 weeks. 
However with a longer follow-up, the difference in overall survival in favour of lenalidomide/ low 
dose dexamethasone tends to decrease. 
Multiple myeloma with at least one prior therapy 
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide were evaluated in two phase 3 multicentre, randomised, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group controlled studies (MM-009 and MM-010) of 
lenalidomide plus dexamethasone therapy versus dexamethasone alone in previously treated patients 
with multiple myeloma. Out of 353 patients in the MM-009 and MM-010 studies who received 
lenalidomide/dexamethasone, 45.6 % were aged 65 or over. Of the 704 patients evaluated in the 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MM-009 and MM-010 studies, 44.6 % were aged 65 or over. 
In both studies, patients in the lenalidomide/dexamethasone (len/dex) group took 25 mg of 
lenalidomide orally once daily on days 1 to 21 and a matching placebo capsule once daily on days 22 
to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in the placebo/dexamethasone (placebo/dex) group took 1 placebo 
capsule on days 1 to 28 of each 28-day cycle. Patients in both treatment groups took 40 mg of 
dexamethasone orally once daily on days 1 to 4, 9 to 12, and 17 to 20 of each 28-day cycle for the first 
4 cycles of therapy. The dose of dexamethasone was reduced to 40 mg orally once daily on days 1 to 4 
of each 28-day cycle after the first 4 cycles of therapy. In both studies, treatment was to continue until 
disease progression. In both studies, dose adjustments were allowed based on clinical and laboratory 
finding. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was time to progression (TTP). In total, 353 patients 
were evaluated in the MM-009 study; 177 in the len/dex group and 176 in the placebo/dex group and, 
in total, 351 patients were evaluated in the MM-010 study; 176 in the len/dex group and 175 in the 
placebo/dex group. 
In both studies, the baseline demographic and disease-related characteristics were comparable between 
the len/dex and placebo/dex groups. Both patient populations presented a median age of 63 years, with 
a comparable male to female ratio. The ECOG performance status was comparable between both 
groups, as was the number and type of prior therapies. 
Pre-planned interim analyses of both studies showed that len/dex was statistically significantly 
superior (p < 0.00001) to dexamethasone alone for the primary efficacy endpoint, TTP (median 
follow-up duration of 98.0 weeks). Complete response and overall response rates in the len/dex arm 
were also significantly higher than the placebo/dex arm in both studies. Results of these analyses 
subsequently led to an unblinding in both studies, in order to allow patients in the placebo/dex group 
to receive treatment with the len/dex combination. 
An extended follow-up efficacy analysis was conducted with a median follow-up of 130.7 weeks. 
Table 11 summarises the results of the follow-up efficacy analyses – pooled studies MM-009 and 
MM-010. 
In this pooled extended follow-up analysis, the median TTP was 60.1 weeks (95 % CI: 44.3, 73.1) in 
patients treated with len/dex (N = 353) versus 20.1 weeks (95 % CI: 17.7, 20.3) in patients treated with 
placebo/dex (N = 351). The median progression free survival was 48.1 weeks (95 % CI: 36.4, 62.1) in 
patients treated with len/dex versus 20.0 weeks (95 % CI: 16.1, 20.1) in patients treated with 
placebo/dex. The median duration of treatment was 44.0 weeks (min: 0.1, max: 254.9) for len/dex and 
23.1 weeks (min: 0.3, max: 238.1) for placebo/dex. Complete response (CR), partial response (PR) 
and overall response (CR+PR) rates in the len/dex arm remain significantly higher than in the 
placebo/dex arm in both studies. The median overall survival in the extended follow-up analysis of the 
pooled studies is 164.3 weeks (95 % CI: 145.1, 192.6) in patients treated with len/dex versus 
136.4 weeks (95 % CI: 113.1, 161.7) in patients treated with placebo/dex. Despite the fact that 170 out 
of the 351 patients randomised to placebo/dex received lenalidomide after disease progression or after 
the studies were unblinded, the pooled analysis of overall survival demonstrated a statistically 
significant survival advantage for len/dex relative to placebo/dex (HR = 0.833, 95 % CI = [0.687, 
1.009], p=0.045).

Myelodysplastic syndromes 
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide were evaluated in patients with transfusion-dependent anaemia 
due  to low- or intermediate-1-risk myelodysplastic syndromes associated with a deletion 5q 
cytogenetic  abnormality, with or without additional cytogenetic abnormalities, in two main studies: a 
phase 3,  multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 3-arm study of two doses of oral 
lenalidomide  (10 mg and 5 mg) versus placebo (MDS-004); and a phase 2, a multicentre, single-arm, 
open-label study of  lenalidomide (10 mg) (MDS-003). 
The results presented below represent the intent-to-treat population studied in MDS-003 and MDS-004; 
with  the results in the isolated Del (5q) sub-population also shown separately. 
In study MDS-004, in which 205 patients were equally randomised to receive lenalidomide 10 mg, 
5 mg or  placebo, the primary efficacy analysis consisted of a comparison of the transfusion-
independence response  rates of the 10 mg and 5 mg lenalidomide arms versus the placebo arm 
(double-blind phase 16 to 52 weeks  and open-label up to a total of 156 weeks). Patients who did not 
have evidence of at least a minor erythroid  response after 16 weeks were to be discontinued from 
treatment. Patients who had evidence of at least a  minor erythroid response could continue therapy 
until erythroid relapse, disease progression or unacceptable  toxicity. Patients, who initially received 
placebo or 5 mg lenalidomide and did not achieve at least a minor  erythroid response after 16 weeks of 
treatment were permitted to switch from placebo to 5 mg lenalidomide  or continue lenalidomide 
treatment at higher dose (5 mg to 10 mg). 
In, study MDS-003, in which 148 patients received lenalidomide at a dose of 10 mg, the primary 
efficacy  analysis consisted of an evaluation of the efficacy of lenalidomide treatments to achieve 
haematopoietic  improvement in subjects with low- or intermediate-1 risk myelodysplastic syndromes.

In MDS-004, a significant larger proportion of patients with myelodysplastic syndromes achieved the 
primary  endpoint  of transfusion  independence (> 182 days)  on  lenalidomide 10 mg  compared  with 
placebo  (55.1 % vs. 6.0 %). Amongst the 47 patients with an isolated Del (5q) cytogenetic abnormality 
and  treated  with  lenalidomide  10 mg,  27 patients  (57.4 %)  achieved  red  blood  cell  transfusion 
independence. 
The  median  time  to  transfusion  independence in  the  lenalidomide  10 mg  arm  was  4.6 weeks.  The 
median  duration of transfusion independence was not reached in any of the treatment arms but should 
exceed 2 years  for the lenalidomide-treated subjects. The median increase in haemoglobin (Hgb) from 
baseline in the 10 mg  arm was 6.4 g/dL. 
Additional endpoints of the study included cytogenetic response (in the 10 mg arm major and minor 
cytogenetic responses were observed in 30.0 % and 24.0 % of subjects, respectively), assessment of 
Health  Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and progression to acute myeloid leukaemia. Results of the 
cytogenetic  response and HRQoL were consistent with the findings of the primary endpoint and in 
favour of  lenalidomide treatment compared to placebo. 
In  MDS-003,  a  large  proportion  of  patients  with  myelodysplastic  syndromes  achieved  transfusion 
independence  (> 182 days)  on  lenalidomide  10 mg  (58.1 %).  The  median  time  to  transfusion 
independence  was 4.1 weeks. The median duration of transfusion independence was 114.4 weeks. The 
median increase in  haemoglobin (Hgb) was 5.6 g/dL. Major and minor cytogenetic responses were 
observed in 40.9 % and  30.7 % of subjects, respectively. 
A  large  proportion  of  subjects  enrolled  in  MDS-003  (72.9 %)  and  MDS-004  (52.7 %)  had 
received prior  erythropoiesis-stimulating agents. 
Mantle cell lymphoma 
The efficacy and safety  of lenalidomide were evaluated in  patients with  mantle cell lymphoma in  a 
phase 2,  multicentre,  randomised  open-label  study  versus  single  agent  of  investigator’s  choice  in 
patients who were  refractory to their last regimen or had relapsed one to three times (study MCL-002). 
Patients who were at least 18 years of age with histologically-proven MCL and CT-measurable disease 
were  enrolled. Patients were required to have received adequate previous treatment with at least one 
prior  combination  chemotherapy  regimen.  Also,  patients  had  to  be  ineligible  for  intensive 
chemotherapy and/or  transplant at time of inclusion in the study. Patients were randomised 2:1 to the 
lenalidomide or the control  arm. The investigator’s choice treatment was selected before randomisation 
and  consisted  of  monotherapy  with  either  chlorambucil,  cytarabine,  rituximab,  fludarabine,  or 
gemcitabine. 
Lenalidomide was administered orally 25 mg once daily for the first 21 days (D1 to D21) of repeating 
28-day cycles until progression  or unacceptable toxicity. Patients with  moderate renal insufficiency 
were to  receive a lower starting dose of lenalidomide 10 mg daily on the same schedule. 
The  baseline  demographic  were  comparable  between  the  lenalidomide  arm  and  control  arm.  Both 
patient  populations presented a median age of 68.5 years with comparable male to female ratio. The 
ECOG  performance status was comparable between both groups, as was the number of prior therapies. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in study MCL-002 was progression-free survival (PFS). 
The efficacy results for the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population were assessed by the Independent Review 
Committee (IRC), and are presented in the table below.

In study MCL-002 in the ITT population, there was an overall apparent increase in deaths  within 20 
weeks in  the lenalidomide arm 22/170 (13 %) versus 6/84 (7 %) in the control arm. In patients with 
high tumour burden, corresponding figures were 16/81 (20 %) and 2/28 (7 %) (see section 4.4). 
Follicular lymphoma 
AUGMENT - CC-5013-NHL-007  
The efficacy and safety of lenalidomide in combination with rituximab versus rituximab plus placebo 
was evaluated in patients with relapsed/refractory iNHL including FL in a phase 3, multicentre, 
randomised, double- blind controlled study (CC-5013-NHL-007 [AUGMENT]). 
A total of 358 patients who were at least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed MZL or 
Grade 1, 2 or 3a FL (CD20+ by flow cytometry or histochemistry) as assessed by the investigator or 
local pathologist were randomised in a 1:1 ratio. Subjects had been previously treated with at least one 
prior systemic chemotherapy, immunotherapy or chemoimmunotherapy. 
Lenalidomide was administered orally 20 mg once daily for the first 21 days of repeating 28-day 
cycles for 12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity. The dose of rituximab was 375 mg/m2 every week 
in Cycle 1 (days 1, 8, 15, and 22) and on day 1 of every 28-day cycle from cycles 2 through 5. All 
dosage calculations for rituximab were based on the patient’s body surface area (BSA), using actual 
patient weight.

The demographic and disease-related baseline characteristics were similar across the 2 treatment 
groups. 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of lenalidomide in combination with 
rituximab to rituximab plus placebo in subjects with relapsed/refractory FL Grade 1, 2 or 3a or MZL. 
Efficacy determination was based upon PFS as the primary endpoint, as assessed by the IRC using the 
2007 International Working Group (IWG) criteria but without positron emission tomography (PET).  
The secondary objectives of the study were to compare the safety of lenalidomide in combination with 
rituximab versus rituximab plus placebo. Further secondary objectives were to compare the efficacy of 
rituximab plus lenalidomide versus rituximab plus placebo using the following other parameters of 
efficacy: 
Overall response rate (ORR), CR rate, and duration of response (DoR) by IWG 2007 without PET and 
OS. 
Results from the overall population including FL and MZL showed that at a median follow up of 
28.3°months, the study met its primary endpoint of PFS with a hazard ratio (HR) (95 % confidence 
interval [CI]) of 0.45 (0.33,0.61) p-value < 0.0001. The efficacy results from the follicular lymphoma 
population are presented in Table 14.

Follicular lymphoma for patients refractory to Rituximab 
MAGNIFY - CC-5013-NHL-008  
A total of 232 subjects who were at least 18 years of age with histologically confirmed FL (Grade 1, 2, 
3a or MZL), as assessed by the investigator or local pathologist, were enrolled into the initial treatment 
period with 12 cycles of lenalidomide plus rituximab. Subjects who achieved CR/CRu, PR, or SD by 
the end of the induction treatment period were randomised to enter the maintenance treatment period. 
All enrolled subjects must have previously been treated with at least one prior systemic antilymphoma 
therapy. In contrast to study NHL-007, the NHL-008 study included patients who were refractory to 
rituximab (no response or relapsed within 6 months of rituximab treatment or who were double-
refractory to rituximab and chemotherapy). 
During the induction treatment period, lenalidomide 20 mg was given on Days 1-21 of repeated 
28-day cycles for up to 12 cycles or until unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal of consent or disease 
progression. The dose of rituximab was 375 mg/m2 every week in Cycle 1 (Days 1, 8, 15, and 22) and 
on Day 1 of every other 28-day cycle (cycles 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) up to 12 cycles therapy. All dosage 
calculations for rituximab were based on the patient body surface area (BSA) and actual weight. 
The data presented are based on an interim analysis focusing on the single-arm induction treatment 
period. Efficacy determinations are based on ORR by best response as the primary endpoint, using a 
modification of the 1999 International Working Group Response Criteria (IWGRC). The secondary 
objective was to evaluate other parameters of efficacy, such as DoR.

Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency (EMA) has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies 
with the reference medicinal product containing lenalidomide in all subsets of the paediatric 
population for mature B-cell neoplasm conditions, (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Lenalidomide has an asymmetric carbon atom and can therefore exist as the optically active forms S(-) 
and R(+). Lenalidomide is produced as a racemic mixture. Lenalidomide is generally more soluble in 
organic solvents but exhibits the greatest solubility in 0.1N HCl buffer. 
Absorption 
Lenalidomide is rapidly absorbed following oral administration in healthy volunteers, under fasting 
conditions, with maximum plasma concentrations occurring between 0.5 and 2 hours post-dose. In 
patients, as well as in healthy volunteers, the maximum concentration (Cmax) and area-under-the-
concentration time curve (AUC) increase proportionally with increases in dose. Multiple dosing does 
not cause marked medicinal product accumulation. In plasma, the relative exposures of the S- and R- 
enantiomers of lenalidomide are approximately 56 % and 44 %, respectively. 
Co-administration with a high-fat and high-calorie meal in healthy volunteers reduces the extent of 
absorption, resulting in an approximately 20 % decrease in area under the concentration versus time 
curve (AUC) and 50 % decrease in Cmax in plasma. However, in the main multiple myeloma and 
myelodysplastic  syndromes registration trials where the efficacy and safety were established for 
lenalidomide, the medicinal product was administered without regard to food intake. Thus, 
lenalidomide can be administered with or without food. 
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that the oral absorption rate of lenalidomide is similar 
among  MM, MDS and MCL patients. 
Distribution 
In vitro (14C)-lenalidomide binding to plasma proteins was low with mean plasma protein binding at 
23 % and 29 % in multiple myeloma patients and healthy volunteers, respectively. 
Lenalidomide is present in human semen (< 0.01 % of the dose) after administration of 25 mg/day and 
the medicinal product is undetectable in semen of a healthy subject 3 days after stopping the substance 
(see section 4.4). 
Biotransformation and elimination 
Results from human in vitro metabolism studies indicate that lenalidomide is not metabolised by 
cytochrome P450 enzymes suggesting that administration of lenalidomide with medicinal products 
that inhibit cytochrome P450 enzymes is not likely to result in metabolic medicinal product 
interactions in humans. In vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide has no inhibitory effect on CYP1A2, 
CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A, or UGT1A1. Therefore, lenalidomide is unlikely to 
cause any clinically relevant medicinal product interactions when co-administered with substrates of 
these enzymes. 
In vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide is not a substrate of human breast cancer resistance protein 
(BCRP), multidrug resistance protein (MRP) transporters MRP1, MRP2, or MRP3, organic anion 
transporters (OAT) OAT1 and OAT3, organic anion transporting polypeptide 1B1 (OATP1B1), 
organic cation transporters (OCT) OCT1 and OCT2, multidrug and toxin extrusion protein (MATE) 
MATE1, and organic cation transporters novel (OCTN) OCTN1 and OCTN2. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In vitro studies indicate that lenalidomide has no inhibitory effect on human bile salt export pump 
(BSEP), BCRP, MRP2, OAT1, OAT3, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, and OCT2. 
A majority of lenalidomide is eliminated through urinary excretion. The contribution of renal 
excretion to total clearance in subjects with normal renal function was 90 %, with 4 % of lenalidomide 
eliminated in faeces. 
Lenalidomide is poorly metabolized as 82 % of the dose is excreted unchanged in urine. Hydroxy-
lenalidomide and N-acetyl-lenalidomide represent 4.59 % and 1.83 % of the excreted dose, 
respectively. The renal clearance of lenalidomide exceeds the glomerular filtration rate and therefore is 
at least actively secreted to some extent. 
At doses of 5 to 25 mg/day, half-life in plasma is approximately 3 hours in healthy volunteers and 
ranges from 3 to 5 hours in patients with multiple myeloma, myelodysplastic syndromes or mantle cell 
lymphoma. 
Older people 
No dedicated clinical studies have been conducted to evaluate pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide in the 
elderly. Population pharmacokinetic analyses included patients with ages ranging from 39 to 85 years 
old and indicate that age does not influence lenalidomide clearance (exposure in plasma). Because 
elderly patients are more likely to have decreased renal function, care should be taken in dose 
selection and it would be prudent to monitor renal function. 
Renal impairment 
The pharmacokinetics of lenalidomide was studied in subjects with renal impairment due to 
nonmalignant conditions. In this study, two methods were used to classify renal function: the urinary 
creatinine clearance measured over 24 hours and the creatinine clearance estimated by Cockcroft-
Gault formula. The results indicate that as renal function decreases (< 50 mL/min), the total 
lenalidomide clearance decreases proportionally resulting in an increase in AUC. The AUC was 
increased by approximately 2.5, 4 and 5-fold in subjects with moderate renal impairment, severe renal 
impairment, and end-stage renal disease, respectively, compared to the group combining subjects with 
normal renal function and subjects with mild renal impairment. The half-life of lenalidomide increased 
from approximately 3.5 hours in subjects with creatinine clearance > 50 mL/min to more than 9 hours 
in subjects with reduced renal function < 50 mL/min. However, renal impairment did not alter the oral 
absorption of lenalidomide. The Cmax was similar between healthy subjects and patients with renal 
impairment. Approximately 30 % of the medicinal product in the body was removed during a single 
4-hour dialysis session. Recommended dose adjustments in patients with impaired renal function are 
described in section 4.2. 
Hepatic impairment  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses included patients with mild hepatic impairment (N=16, total 
bilirubin > 1 to ≤ 1.5 x ULN or AST > ULN) and indicate that mild hepatic impairment does not 
influence lenalidomide clearance (exposure in plasma). There are no data available for patients with 
moderate to severe hepatic impairment.  
Other intrinsic factors  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that body weight (33- 135 kg), gender, race and type of 
haematological malignancy (MM, MDS or MCL) do not have a clinically relevant effect on 
lenalidomide clearance in adult patients.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
An embryofoetal development study has been conducted in monkeys administered lenalidomide at 
doses from 0.5 and up to 4 mg/kg/day. Findings from this study indicate that lenalidomide produced 
external malformations including non-patent anus and malformations of upper and lower extremities 
(bent, shortened, malformed, malrotated and/or absent part of the extremities, oligo and/or 
polydactyly) in the offspring of female monkeys who received the active substance during pregnancy.  
Various visceral effects (discoloration, red foci at different organs, small colourless mass above atrio-
ventricular valve, small gall bladder, malformed diaphragm) were also observed in single foetuses. 
Lenalidomide has a potential for acute toxicity; minimum lethal doses after oral administration were 
> 2000 mg/kg/day in rodents. Repeated oral administration of 75, 150 and 300 mg/kg/day to rats for 
up to 26 weeks produced a reversible treatment-related increase in kidney pelvis mineralisation in all 
3 doses, most notably in females. The no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be 
less than 75 mg/kg/day, and is approximately 25-fold greater than the human daily exposure based on 
AUC exposure. Repeated oral administration of 4 and 6 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 20 weeks 
produced mortality and significant toxicity (marked weight loss, reduced red and white blood cell and 
platelet counts, multiple organ haemorrhage, gastrointestinal tract inflammation, lymphoid, and bone 
marrow atrophy). Repeated oral administration of 1 and 2 mg/kg/day to monkeys for up to 1 year 
produced reversible changes in bone marrow cellularity, a slight decrease in myeloid/erythroid cell 
ratio and thymic atrophy. Mild suppression of white blood cell count was observed at 1 mg/kg/day 
corresponding to approximately the same human dose based on AUC comparisons. 
In vitro (bacterial mutation, human lymphocytes, mouse lymphoma, Syrian Hamster Embryo cell 
transformation) and in vivo (rat micronucleus) mutagenicity studies revealed no drug related effects at 
either the gene or chromosomal level. Carcinogenicity studies with lenalidomide have not been 
conducted. 
Developmental toxicity studies were previously conducted in rabbits. In these studies, rabbits were 
administered 3, 10 and 20 mg/kg/day orally. An absence of the intermediate lobe of the lung was 
observed at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day with dose dependence and displaced kidneys were observed at 
20 mg/kg/day. Although it was observed at maternotoxic levels they may be attributable to a direct 
effect. Soft tissue and skeletal variations in the foetuses were also observed at 10 and 20 mg/kg/day.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lenalidomide Accord is and what it is used for 
What Lenalidomide Accord is  
Lenalidomide Accord contains the active substance ‘lenalidomide’. This medicine belongs to a group 
of medicines which affect how your immune system works. 
What Lenalidomide Accord is used for 
Lenalidomide Accord is used in adults for: 
•  Multiple myeloma 
•  Myelodysplastic syndromes 
•  Mantle cell lymphoma 
• 
Follicular lymphoma 
Multiple myeloma 
Multiple myeloma is a type of cancer which affects a certain kind of white blood cell, called the 
plasma cell. These cells collect in the bone marrow and divide, becoming out of control. This can 
damage the bones and kidneys.  
Multiple myeloma generally cannot be cured. However, the signs and symptoms can be greatly 
reduced or disappear for a period of time. This is called a ‘response’. 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma – in patients who have had a bone marrow transplant 
Lenalidomide Accord is used on its own as a maintenance therapy after patients have recovered 
enough following a bone marrow transplant. 
93 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
a chemotherapy medicine called ‘bortezomib’ 
Newly diagnosed multiple myeloma – in patients who cannot have a bone marrow transplant 
Lenalidomide Accord is taken with other medicines: These may include: 
• 
•  an anti-inflammatory medicine called ‘dexamethasone’ 
•  a chemotherapy medicine called ‘melphalan’ and 
•  an immunosuppressant medicine called ‘prednisone’.  
You will take these other medicines at the start of treatment and then continue to take lenalidomide on 
its own. 
If you are aged 75 years or older or have moderate to severe kidney problems - your doctor will check 
you carefully before starting treatment. 
Multiple myeloma – in patients who have had treatment before 
Lenalidomide Accord is taken together with an anti-inflammatory medicine called ‘dexamethasone’.  
Lenalidomide can stop the signs and symptoms of multiple myeloma getting worse. It has also been 
shown to delay multiple myeloma from coming back following treatment.  
Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) 
MDS are a collection of many different blood and bone marrow diseases. The blood cells become 
abnormal and do not function properly. Patients can experience a variety of signs and symptoms 
including a low red blood cell count (anaemia), the need for a blood transfusion, and be at risk of 
infection. 
you need regular blood transfusions to treat low levels of red blood cells (‘transfusion-
Lenalidomide Accord is used alone to treat adult patients who have been diagnosed with MDS, when 
all of the following apply: 
• 
dependent anaemia’) 
• 
you have an abnormality of cells in the bone marrow called an ‘isolated deletion 5q 
cytogenetic abnormality’. This means your body does not make enough healthy blood cells 
• 
other treatments have been used before, are not suitable or do not work well enough. 
Lenalidomide Accord can increase the number of healthy red blood cells that the body produces by 
reducing the number of abnormal cells: 
• 
will be needed. 
this can reduce the number of blood transfusions needed. It is possible that no transfusions 
Mantle cell lymphoma (MCL) 
MCL is a cancer of part of the immune system (the lymph tissue). It affects a type of white blood cell 
called ‘B-lymphocytes’ or B-cells. MCL is a disease where B-cells grow in an uncontrolled way and 
build up in the lymph tissue, bone marrow or blood. 
Lenalidomide Accord is used alone to treat adult patients who have previously been treated with other 
medicines. 
Follicular lymphoma (FL) 
FL is a slow growing cancer that affects the B-lymphocytes. These are a type of white blood cells that 
help your body fight infection. When you have FL, too many of these B-lymphocytes may collect in 
your blood, bone marrow, lymph nodes and spleen. 
Lenalidomide is taken together with another medicine called ‘rituximab’ for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously treated follicular lymphoma. 
How Lenalidomide Accord works 
Lenalidomide works by affecting the body’s immune system and directly attacking the cancer. It 
works in a number of different ways: 
•  by stopping the cancer cells developing 
94 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
•  by stopping blood vessels growing in the cancer 
•  by stimulating part of the immune system to attack the cancer cells. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Lenalidomide Accord  
You must read the package leaflet of all medicinal products to be taken in combination with 
Lenalidomide Accord before starting treament with Lenalidomide Accord. 
Do not take Lenalidomide Accord: 
• 
if you are pregnant, think you may be pregnant or are planning to become pregnant, as 
lenalidomide is expected to be harmful to an unborn child (see section 2, ‘Pregnancy, breast-
feeding and contraception – information for women and men’). 
if you are able to become pregnant, unless you follow all the necessary measures to prevent you 
from becoming pregnant (see section 2, ‘Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception – 
information for women and men’). If you are able to become pregnant, your doctor will record 
with each prescription that the necessary measures have been taken and provide you with this 
confirmation. 
if you are allergic to lenalidomide or any of the other ingredients of this medicine listed in 
section 6. If you think you may be allergic, ask your doctor for advice. 
If any of these apply to you, do not take lenalidomide. Talk to your doctor if you are not sure. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking lenalidomide 
• 
if you have had blood clots in the past - you have an increased risk of developing blood clots in 
the veins and arteries during treatment 
if you have any signs of an infection, such as a cough or fever  
if you have or have ever had previous viral infection, particularly hepatitis B infection, varicella 
zoster, HIV. If you are in doubt, talk to your doctor. Treatment with lenalidomide may cause the 
virus to become active again, in patients who carry the virus, This results in a recurrence of the 
infection. Your doctor should check whether you have ever had hepatitis B infection 
if you have kidney problems - your doctor may adjust your dose of lenalidomide if you have had a 
heart attack, have ever had a blood clot, or if you smoke, have high blood pressure or high 
cholesterol levels 
if you have had an allergic reaction whilst taking thalidomide (another medicine used to treat 
multiple myeloma) such as rash, itching, swelling, dizziness or trouble breathing 
•  you have experienced in the past a combination of any of the following symptoms: widespread 
rash, red skin, high body temperature, flu-like symptoms, liver enzyme elevations, blood 
abnormalities (eosinophilia), enlarged lymph nodes – these are signs of a severe skin reaction 
called Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms which is also known as DRESS 
or drug hypersensitivity syndrome. (see also section 4 “Possible side effects”). 
If any of the above apply to you, tell your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before starting treatment. 
At any time during or after your treatment, tell your doctor or nurse immediately if you:  
• 
• 
experience blurred, loss of or double vision, difficulty speaking, weakness in an arm or a leg, a 
change in the way you walk or problems with your balance, persistent numbness, decreased 
sensation or loss of sensation, memory loss or confusion. These may all be symptoms of a 
serious and potentially fatal brain condition known as progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you had these symptoms prior to treatment with lenalidomide, 
tell your doctor about any change in these symptoms. 
experience shortness of breath, tiredness, dizziness, pain in the chest, a faster heartbeat, or 
swelling in the legs or ankles. These may be symptoms of a serious condition known as 
pulmonary hypertension (see section 4). 
95 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tests and checks 
Before and during the treatment with lenalidomide you will have regular blood tests. This is because 
Lenalidomide Accord may cause a fall in the blood cells that help fight infection (white blood cells) 
and help the blood to clot (platelets).  
Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test: 
•  before treatment  
• 
• 
every week for the first 8 weeks of treatment 
then at least every month after that. 
You may be evaluated for signs of cardiopulmonary problems before and during the treatment with 
lenalidomide. 
For patients with MDS taking lenalidomide 
If  you have  MDS,  you  may be  more  likely  to get  a  more  advanced  condition  called  acute  myeloid 
leukaemia  (AML). In addition, it is not known how Lenalidomide Accord affects the chances of you 
getting  AML.  Your doctor  may 
therefore  do  tests to  check  for  signs  which  may  better predict  the 
likelihood of you getting AML during your  treatment with Lenalidomide Accord. 
For patients with MCL taking lenalidomide 
Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test: 
•  before treatment 
• 
• 
• 
• 
every week for the first 8 weeks (2 cycles) of treatment 
then every 2 weeks in cycles 3 and 4 (see section 3 ‘Treatment cycle’ for more information) 
after this it will happen at the start of each cycle and 
at least every month. 
For patients with FL taking lenalidomide 
Your doctor will ask you to have a blood test: 
•  before treatment  
• 
• 
•  After this it will happen at the start of each cycle and 
• 
at least every month. 
every week for the first 3 weeks (1 cycle) of treatment 
then every 2 weeks in cycles 2 to 4 (see Section 3 ‘Treatment cycle’ for more information) 
Your doctor may check if you have a high total amount of tumour throughout the body, including your 
bone marrow. This could lead to a condition where the tumours break down and cause unusual levels 
of chemicals in the blood which can lead to kidney failure (this condition is called ‘Tumour Lysis 
Syndrome’).  
Your doctor may check you for changes to your skin such as red spots or rashes. 
Your doctor may adjust your dose of lenalidomide or stop your treatment based on the results of your 
blood tests and on your general condition. If you are newly diagnosed, your doctor may also assess 
your treatment based on your age and other conditions you already have. 
Blood donation 
You should not donate blood during treatment and for at least 7 days after the end of treatment. 
Children and adolescents 
Lenalidomide is not recommended for use in children and adolescents under 18 years.  
Elderly and people with kidney problems 
If you are aged 75 years or older or have moderate to severe kidney problems - your doctor will check 
you carefully before starting treatment. 
96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other medicines and Lenalidomide Accord 
Tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking, or have recently taken any other medicines. This is because 
lenalidomide can affect the way some other medicines work. Also, some other medicines can affect 
the way lenalidomide works.  
In particular, tell your doctor or nurse if you are taking any of the following medicines: 
• 
• 
• 
some medicines used to prevent pregnancy such as oral contraceptives, as they may stop working 
some medicines used for heart problems – such as digoxin 
some medicines used to thin the blood – such as warfarin 
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and contraception - information for women and men 
Pregnancy  
For women taking lenalidomide  
•  You must not take lenalidomide if you are pregnant, as it is expected to be harmful to an unborn 
baby.  
•  You must not become pregnant while taking lenalidomide. Therefore you must use effective 
methods of contraception if you are a woman of childbearing potential (see ‘Contraception’). 
If you do become pregnant during your treatment with lenalidomide, you must stop the treatment 
and inform your doctor immediately. 
• 
For men taking lenalidomide  
• 
If your partner becomes pregnant whilst you are taking lenalidomide, you should inform your 
doctor immediately. It is recommended that your partner seeks medical advice. 
•  You must also use effective methods of contraception (see ‘Contraception’). 
Breast-feeding 
You must not breast-feed when taking lenalidomide, as it is not known if lenalidomide passes into 
breast milk. 
Contraception 
For women taking lenalidomide  
Before starting the treatment, ask your doctor if you are able to become pregnant, even if you think 
this is unlikely. 
If you are able to become pregnant  
•  you will have pregnancy tests under the supervision of your doctor (before every treatment, at 
least every 4 weeks during treatment, and at least 4 weeks after the treatment has finished) except 
where it has been confirmed that the fallopian tubes have been severed and sealed, to stop eggs 
from reaching the uterus (tubal sterilisation) 
AND 
•  you must use effective methods of contraception for at least 4 weeks before starting treatment, 
during treatment, and until at least 4 weeks after stopping treatment. Your doctor will advise you 
on appropriate methods of contraception. 
For men taking lenalidomide  
Lenalidomide passes into human semen. If your female partner is pregnant or able to become 
pregnant, and she does not use effective methods of contraception, you must use condoms during 
treatment and for at least 7 days after the end of treatment, even if you have had a vasectomy. You 
should not donate semen or sperm during treatment and for at least 7 days after the end of treatment.  
Driving and using machines 
Do not drive or operate machines if you feel dizzy, tired, sleepy, have vertigo or blurred vision after

3. 
How to take Lenalidomide Accord  
Lenalidomide Accord must be given to you by healthcare professionals with experience in treating 
multiple myeloma, MDS, MCL or FL. 
•  When lenalidomide is used to treat multiple myeloma in patients who cannot have a bone marrow 
transplant or have had other treatments before, it is taken with other medicines (see section 1 
‘What lenalidomide is used for’).  
•  When lenalidomide is used to treat multiple myeloma in patients who have had a bone marrow 
transplant or to treat patients with MDS or MCL, it is taken alone.

Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.  
Stop taking Lenalidomide and see a doctor straight away if you notice any of the following 
serious side effects – you may need urgent medical treatment: 
•  Hives, rashes, swelling of eyes, mouth or face, difficulty breathing, or itching, which may be 
symptoms of serious types of allergic reactions called angioedema and anaphylactic reaction. 
•  A serious allergic reaction that may begin as a rash in one area but spread with extensive loss of 
skin over the whole body (Stevens-Johnson syndrome and/or toxic epidermal necrolysis). 
•  Widespread rash, high body temperature, liver enzyme elevations, blood abnormalities 
(eosinophilia), enlarged lymph nodes and other body organs involvement (Drug Reaction with 
Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms which is also known as DRESS or drug hypersensitivity 
syndrome). See also section 2. 
Tell your doctor straight away if you notice any of the following serious side effects: 
•

99 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Bone pain, muscle weakness, confusion or tiredness that might be due to high level of calcium in 
the blood.  
Lenalidomide may reduce the number of white blood cells that fight infection and also the blood cells 
which help the blood to clot (platelets) which may lead to bleeding disorders such as nosebleeds and 
bruising.  
Lenalidomide may also cause blood clots in the veins (thrombosis). 
Other side effects 
It is important to note that a small number of patients may develop additional types of cancer, and it is 
possible that this risk may be increased with lenalidomide treatment. Therefore your doctor should 
carefully evaluate the benefit and risk when you are prescribed lenalidomide.

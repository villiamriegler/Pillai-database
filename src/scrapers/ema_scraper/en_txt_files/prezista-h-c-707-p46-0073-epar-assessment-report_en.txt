1.  Executive summary 
This report covers the submission in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 of 
the final clinical study report of an observational study on growth in HIV-infected children and 
adolescents on antiretroviral therapy in Europe, with special reference to Darunavir. 
The submission of the study protocol (EMEA/H/C/000707/MEA 69)  “An observational study on growth 
in HIV-infected children and adolescents on antiretroviral therapy in Europe, with special reference to 
Darunavir” was requested as a post-authorisation commitment during the review of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000707/II/0054 (type II variation to request an extension of the indication in the HIV 
infected treatment naïve patients aged ≥12 to <18 years). 
No SmPC and PL changes are proposed. 
2.  Recommendation 
In conclusion, there was no evidence that initiating a DRV-containing ART regimen had any impact on 
growth, positively or negatively. This lack of effect on growth is similar to that seen for other PIs. 
The data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Prezista (darunavir) which remains 
unchanged. No changes to the current SmPC are warranted. The results of the study should be 
included in the RMP for Darunavir.  
No further action is required.

Introduction 
On 12 September 2017, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for Prezista (darunavir), in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended, on medicinal products for 
paediatric use. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for Prezista 
(darunavir) and that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
An observational study on growth in HIV-infected children and adolescents on antiretroviral therapy in 
Europe, with special reference to darunavir. 
The protocol for this observational study was agreed by PRAC in September 2014 (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000707/MEA 69).  
EMA/21294/2018  
Page 3/14 
 
 
 
 
 
The final study report of the DIONE study was submitted by the MAH to the EMA on 7 November 2012 
as part of a type II variation to request an extension of the indication in the HIV-infected treatment-
naïve patients aged ≥12 to <18 years (procedure EMEA/H/C/000707/II/0054). In the DIONE study, 
the median height-for-age z-score (HAZ) at baseline was -0.4, which is close to but below the HAZ 
expected in uninfected adolescents and there was no significant change in HAZ-score at 48 weeks. 
Therefore, EMA requested the MAH to include “growth abnormalities in the paediatric population” as an 
important potential risk in the Risk Management Plan and to further investigate the effect of DRV on 
growth in HIV-infected children and adolescents. 
The MAH contracted the Paediatric European Network for Treatment of AIDS (PENTA) 
Foundation/European Pregnancy and Paediatric HIV Cohort Collaboration (EPPICC) to conduct an 
observational study on growth in HIV-infected children and adolescents on ARV therapy in Europe. To 
place the potential effect of DRV on growth in context, analyses to investigate the wider effect of ARVs 
and different drug classes on growth in paediatric patients of different ages and treatment histories 
were also planned. 
The DRV growth study in HIV-infected children and adolescents on ARV therapy in Europe conducted 
by PENTAEPPICC, has now been completed and is subject to this Article 46 submission. 
The overall aim of this study was to investigate, among paediatric patients with HIV infection in a  
“real world” setting in 11 countries, how the height of HIV-infected children in Europe aged 
<18 years is affected by exposure to a DRV-based antiretroviral treatment (ART) regimen. 
4.2  Clinical study 
  Description 
The overall aim of this study was to investigate, among paediatric patients with HIV infection in a “real 
world” setting in 11 countries (Belgium, Italy, Netherlands, Poland, Russia, Spain, Sweden, 
Switzerland, Thailand and the UK/Ireland), the following research question: 
  How is the height of HIV-infected children in Europe aged <18 years affected by exposure to a 
darunavir-based ART regimen? 
  Methods 
  Objectives 
1.  To describe characteristics of HIV-infected children aged <18 years in Europe initiating treatment 
with a combination ART (cART) regimen and ever taking a darunavir-containing regimen, including 
a descriptive summary of their drug utilization data. 
2.  To describe the change in height-for-age z-score (HAZ) pre- and post-darunavir exposure. 
3.  If a cohort with similar demographic and clinical characteristics to children taking DRV can be 
identified, to compare the change in HAZ in those taking a darunavir-containing regimen to those 
taking other, non-darunavir protease inhibitor (PI) -containing regimens, adjusting for potential 
confounding factors including pre-regimen HAZ. The characteristics of the children taking the non-
darunavir containing regimens will also be described. Children starting DRV first-line will be 
excluded from this analysis and analysed separately data permitting.

  Study design 
A meta-analysis of individual patient data from longitudinal observational cohort studies participating 
in the European Pregnancy and Paediatric HIV Cohort Collaboration (EPPICC). EPPICC conducts 
epidemiological research on the prognosis and outcome of HIV-infected pregnant women, children and 
children exposed to HIV in utero. 
  Study population /Study size 
Each cohort submitted individual patient data to the 2016 EPPICC data merger for all paediatric 
patients in their study who fulfilled the following inclusion criteria: 
  HIV-infected paediatric patients who initiated on cART (composed of an NNRTI or boosted PI 
with ≥2 NRTIs, or ≥3 NRTIs including abacavir) aged <18 years, 
  who started a DRV-containing regimen aged <18 years, with at least one height measurement 
prior to starting DRV, at the start of DRV and at least one measurement ≥1 year subsequently 
(Objectives 1 & 2) 
or 
  started a PI-containing regimen aged <18 years, with at least one height measurement within 
the 2.5 years prior to starting the PI, and at least one measurement within 2.5 years after PI 
start (Objective 3) 
For Objective 3 a matching process was used to select a control group starting non-DRV PI-containing 
regimens. Matches were identified using propensity scores based on cohort, age at ART initiation, 
initial ART regimen type, ART line number at start of PI and year of starting PI. 
Differences that exceed 0.3 units of height-for-age z-score (HAZ) (approximately 2cm to 3cm in 
height) are considered to be of clinical concern. Assuming a mean change from baseline in HAZ of 0 in 
the comparator arm, 80% power and alpha=0.05, a total of 350 children (175 in each group) would 
give sufficient power to detect a difference in change in HAZ between groups of 0.3 or greater. 
Therefore, a sample size of 175 children on DRV was considered to be the minimum number required 
for the analysis of Objective 3. 
  Variables 
Data collected on patients receiving DRV and other PI-containing regimens included: demographics 
(age, sex, ethnicity, mode of infection); AIDS events and deaths during follow up; ART use (including 
start and stop dates, dosing and reasons for stopping a drug); and height, weight, viral load (HIV-1 
RNA) and CD4 measurements at every visit. No information which could potentially identify patients, 
such as name or address, was collected. 
  Outcomes/endpoints 
The main outcome in this study was change in height, with height standardised using height-for-age z-
scores (HAZ). 
  Statistical Methods 
Main summary measures: Patient characteristics are summarised as frequency (percentage), median 
[interquartile range (IQR)] or mean (standard deviation (SD)), as appropriate. 
Mean changes in HAZ and regression model coefficients are summarised along with their corresponding 
95% confidence intervals (CI) and p-values.

  Results 
  Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The results are based on data from 10 cohorts across 11 countries. 
Overall, 996 patients had ever taken DRV with date of DRV start ranging from 05 March 2004 to 15 
Nov 2016. Please see the patient flow chart for details on numbers of patients excluded and reasons.  
Overall characteristics of patients with incomplete height data (n=117) were broadly similar to those 
with complete data (n=243). The only notable difference was that a higher proportion of patients with 
incomplete height data were naïve compared to patients with complete height data (21% vs. 8%). 
Consequently patients with complete height data tended to be on ART longer prior to DRV start 
(median 6.7 years [3.3,10.1] versus 3.9 years [0.2,7.8]) and were more likely to be exposed to drugs 
in each of the main classes. At the time of starting DRV, patients with complete data also had higher 
EMA/21294/2018  
Page 6/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
CD4 counts (median 619 [373, 868] versus 382 [260, 633]) and CD4% (27% [21, 34] versus 21% 
[15, 29]) than those with missing height data. 
The breakdown of characteristics by initial regimen revealed that patients who initiated on >3NRTIs 
were older at DRV start, started ART much earlier than other patients, and had different treatment 
histories to those starting a PI- or NNRTI-based regimen. As the number of patients in this group was 
relatively small (n=13) they were excluded from the main analysis. 
Further analysis presented by the MAH has therefore been restricted to all patients (n=230) who 
initiated ART on a PI- or NNRTI-based regimen, and who had complete height data; 19 were treatment 
naïve and 211 treatment experienced at the time of starting DRV. 
Rapporteur’s Comments 
The group of patients with three qualifying measurements available at the time of data analyses is 230 
participants, which is higher than the minimum number of patients (175) specified in the agreed 
protocol. 
  Baseline data 
Darunavir group 
Characteristics of the 230 patients: Just under half (46%) were male, the majority (83%) were black 
African, and most (93%) were identified as infected through mother to child transmission (MTCT), with 
similar proportions by treatment status. The large majority of patients (83%) were from the 
UK/Ireland. One patient died during follow up, however the cause of death was accidental and not 
related to HIV. 
Overall, median age at ART initiation was 7.0 years [2.8, 10.6], and higher among the 19 patients who 
were treatment naïve when starting DRV (12.8 years [11.6, 14.7]) than the patients who were 
treatment experienced (6.5 years [2.4, 9.8]). Median age at DRV start was similar across the groups, 
at around 13 years of age. 
Median viral load at ART initiation was similar across the groups, and among those who were treatment 
experienced, 62% had a viral load <400c/ml at DRV start. 
Median CD4 count at ART initiation was similar, and higher at DRV start, among those with who were 
treatment experienced. 
The treatment naïve patients had a mean height-for-age z-score of 0.04 (SD 0.76) at the time of 
ART/DRV initiation while for the treatment experienced patients at ART initiation, height was lower (at 
-0.83 (SD 1.34)) than what would be expected in uninfected children and adolescents of the same age. 
The median time between ART initiation and starting DRV in the treatment experienced patients was 
6.8 years [3.7, 10.1] and during this time HAZ increased to -0.41 (1.17). Likewise, BMI-for-age z-
score was also higher in the treatment naïve group compared to the treatment experienced group. 
Treatment experienced patients were exposed to a median of 6 [4, 7] drugs before starting DRV. In 
this group, 29% initiated ART on a PI-based regimen and 71% on an NNRTI-based regimen. Forty-four 
per cent (44%) started taking DRV as part of their second ART line, 38% as third line and 18% as 
fourth or subsequent line. Overall, 100% had prior exposure to NRTIs, 77% to NNRTIs, 75% to PIs and 
1% to other drug classes. In patients who had been exposed to NNRTIs, most had used one (median 1 
[1,1]), with 60% taking nevirapine and 51% efavirenz, with a cumulative time on an NNRTI before 
starting DRV of 2.2 years [1.1,5.3]. In those who had taken a previous PI the median number of PIs 
was 1 [1, 2], taken for a total of 3.8 years [2.0, 6.1], with lopinavir the most commonly used PI (89%) 
followed by atazanavir (27%). Prior to starting DRV, one third (36%) of patients had a treatment 
EMA/21294/2018

interruption of at least 30 days with the median total time off-treatment of 1.4 years [0.5, 2.7]. Thirty 
per cent (30%) of treatment experienced patients started DRV as part of simplified regimen while 15% 
switched to DRV following failure of the previous regimen dose.  
One patient was prescribed DRV while under three years of age. This patient was female, from the UK 
and started ART at age three months on an NNRTI-based regimen and switched to a PI-based regimen 
containing lopinavir at age six months and then switched to DRV at age two years and two months. At 
DRV start she weighed 11 kg and was taking a 300mg/100mg b.d. dose. The reason for switch to DRV 
is not available.  
Patients were on DRV for a median total time of 2.3 years [1.6,3.3] out of a total follow up time of 2.5 
years [1.8,3.7] since DRV start; 9% had a treatment interruption after start of DRV, spending a total 
of 0.7 years [0.3,1.1] off treatment. 
Rapporteur’s Comments 
As formulated in Objective 1, the MAH described the characteristics of the patients initiating treatment 
with a combination ART regimen and ever taking a DRV-containing regimen, including their drug 
utilization data.  
The HAZ scores in the treatment naïve patients (0.04; SD 0.76) was higher compared to the treatment 
experienced group (-0.83; SD 1.34), however it is noted that there were only 19 naïve patients. The 
MAH further mentioned that during the median time between ART initiation and starting DRV in the 
treatment experienced patients, which was 6.8 years [3.7, 10.1], HAZ increased to -0.41 (1.17), which 
is to be expected. In addition, BMI-for-age z-score was also higher in the treatment naïve group 
compared to the treatment experienced group. 
Control paediatric patients 
A total of 211 propensity score matched controls were selected.  
The baseline characteristics of treatment experienced patients and their propensity score matched 
controls are presented in Table 3 below.

Table 1: Characteristics of treatment experienced patients starting DRV and controls 
starting a PI other than DRV, <18 years of age 
Overall patients on DRV were more likely to be from the UK/Ireland and of black African ethnicity than 
the controls. Otherwise, the two groups were extremely similar. In 95% of those in the control group, 
and 96% of those on DRV, the PI was boosted, and the most common PI used in the control group was 
atazanavir (70%) followed by lopinavir (22%). 
EMA/21294/2018

Rapporteur’s Comments 
The propensity score matched controls were selected according to the agreed protocol. 
It is noted that the HAZ scores at start of ART and PI  in the control group (-0.96 and -0.65, 
respectively) are slightly lower compared to the HAZ scores in the treatment experienced group (-0.83 
and -0.41, respectively). 
  Results of the HAZ scores 
Darunavir group 
Overall, from time of starting ART, patients in the DRV group had a median of 28 height 
measurements [18,40] compared to 28 [17,39] in the control group not taking DRV. Restricting follow-
up time to +/- 2.5 years from start of DRV or other PI, patients in the DRV group had median 12 
height measurements [7.5,14.5] compared to 9.5 [5,14.5] in the control group. 
Height-for-age z-scores (HAZ) in the year before and after starting DRV, in treatment naïve and 
experienced patients are summarised in Table 1. 
Table 2: Changes in height-for-age z scores one year before and after starting darunavir 
In treatment experienced patients, the mean HAZ was -0.40 one year before starting DRV, and  -0.41 
at both DRV start and one year after DRV start, with no evidence of any change in the one year period 
before or after starting DRV (mean change -0.01 (95% CI -0.05, 0.04) and 0.00 
(-0.04, 0.04) respectively) or difference in the rate of change before and after starting DRV (0.01 (-
0.06, 0.07)).  
In treatment naïve patients where the HAZ score was higher at DRV start (mean 0.08), there was no 
evidence of any change in HAZ over the first year on treatment (mean change -0.01 (-0.14, 0.11)) and 
only a very small decrease in the year before starting treatment (mean change -0.04 (-0.16, 0.11)). 
Again there was no evidence that the rate of change differed in the two time periods (difference in rate 
of change 0.02 (-0.13, 0.18)).  
EMA/21294/2018  
Page 10/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In both treatment naïve and experienced patients the median HAZ reduced slightly from one year 
before (treatment naïve; median HAZ 0.22 [-0.56, 0.65], treatment experienced; -0.41 [-1.12. 0.33]) 
to time of DRV start (0.16 [-0.64, 0.68] and -0.50 [-1.16, 0.32]) and to one year after DRV start (-
0.02 [-0.44, 0.86] and -0.56 [-1.09, 0.30]). However, the median change within patients before and 
after DRV start in both groups was approximately 0. 
All HAZ measurements for treatment naïve patients up to 2.5 years before and after 
ART/initiation are shown in Figure 1. Results suggest that this group continued to 
grow at the expected rate (i.e. HAZ remained at roughly the same level), with a slight 
increase in HAZ observed after two years. 
Figure 1: HAZ scores (with fitted mean and 95% CI) among naïve patients within 2.5 years 
of initiation on DRV based first line ART 
To formally test for any changes in HAZ in treatment experienced patients by key characteristics, a 
multivariable mixed effects linear regression model was fitted to the data, which allowed for a 
difference in the rate of change before and after DRV start while controlling for time on ART, age at 
ART start, initial regimen type, starting DRV after second-line, gender and suppressed viral load at 
DRV start. Overall, the regression coefficient for the change in HAZ before DRV start, was -0.004 
([95% CI - 0.040 to 0.030] p=0.800), and after DRV start -0.009 ([95% CI -0.058 to 0.041] 
p=0.723), indicating no change in HAZ in either period. 
EMA/21294/2018  
Page 11/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Rapporteur’s Comments 
In treatment experienced patients, the mean HAZ change in the one year period before or after 
starting DRV was -0.01 (95% CI -0.05, 0.04) and 0.00 (-0.04, 0.04) respectively. The difference in the 
rate of change before and after starting DRV was 0.01 (-0.06, 0.07). 
In treatment naïve patients, the mean HAZ change in the one year period before or after starting DRV 
was -0.04 (-0.18, 0.11) and -0.01 (-0.14, 0.11) respectively. The difference in the rate of change 
before and after starting DRV was 0.02 (-0.13, 0.18). 
Differences that exceed 0.3 units of HAZ score (approximately 2cm to 3cm in height) are considered to 
be of clinical concern. 
It is agreed with MAH’s conclusion that there was no evidence of any change in the growth in the 
patients treated with Darunavir.  
Control paediatric patients 
The HAZ scores at start of protease inhibitors (PI) and at one and two years before and after PI start in 
the DRV group and the control group are summarised in the boxplots in Figure 2. HAZ scores did not 
change over the follow-up time, were extremely similar for the DRV group and the control group. 
Figure 2: Boxplot of HAZ from two years before to two years after start of DRV and other PIs 
To determine whether change in HAZ scores was different before and after PI start in treatment 
experienced patients, and further whether the rate of change differed in those on DRV to the control 
group, a linear mixed effects model was fitted. There was no evidence of a difference in the rate of 
change in HAZ for those on DRV compared to the controls on other PIs (interaction term: PI type * 
EMA/21294/2018  
Page 12/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
time since DRV start = -0.022 [95% CI -0.070, 0.027], p=0.381). The model also allowed for the rate 
of change in HAZ to differ after the start of PI compared to before, and an interaction term included in 
the model to allow the change in slope after PI start to differ between those on DRV and other PIs.  
There was no evidence of any difference between those on DRV and those starting other PIs (beta=-
0.039 [95% CI -0.105, 0.027], p=0.244). In fact, the results of the model indicate no change in HAZ 
across the time points before and after PI start, and across all patients. 
Rapporteur’s Comments 
It is agreed that the HAZ scores were similar for the DRV group and the control group and the height 
of the patients did not change over the follow-up time.  
It is agreed with the MAH that there is no evidence that Darunavir restricts the growth in paediatric 
patients as compared to other PIs. 
Other analyses and adverse events/adverse reactions 
From sensitivity analyses there was no evidence of any changes, or differences in changes, in HAZ 
over time or between PIs. 
This study was designed to assess the association between height change and DRV exposure. Adverse 
events were not reported or analysed as part of this study. The sponsor reports aggregate study 
findings as study reports, not as individual spontaneous reports according to Johnson & Johnson safety 
reporting procedures. 
In this study, it is not possible or appropriate to assess the causality of adverse events identified 
during data review. Additionally, individual patient adverse events attributed to DRV are reported by 
treating physicians according to country and European law. 
Rapporteur’s Comments 
This is acknowledged. As commented in the protocol assessment report, it is accepted that the study 
results will be communicated on an aggregate level and that the epidemiological analysis of EPPICC 
data does not allow for causality assessment on an individual patient level. 
4.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects by the MAH 
Characteristics of 230 HIV-infected children aged <18 years, who initiated ART on a PI-or NNRTI-based 
regimen, and who had complete height data, are presented in the clinical study report: 19 subjects 
were treatment-naïve and 211 were treatment experienced at the time of starting DRV. On average, 
DRV was started when patients were teenagers and had been on ART for a median of five years. 
In treatment-experienced patients, the mean HAZ was -0.40 one year before starting DRV, and  -0.41 
at both DRV start and one year after DRV start, with no evidence of any change in the one (-0.04, 
0.04) respectively. The lack of change in HAZ suggests that those taking DRV were growing at a 
similar rate to what would be expected in an uninfected population, both before and after starting DRV, 
and were neither catching up nor falling further behind from their HAZ at the beginning of the analysis 
window. Furthermore, when data from a control group of patients on non-DRV PI-containing regimens 
were analyzed, similar trends were observed with no differences between DRV and other PIs and no 
evidence of any change in HAZ, before and after the start of a new PI. 
EMA/21294/2018  
Page 13/14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For the 19 treatment-naïve patients included in the study, there was also very little change in HAZ 
over the year before (mean change -0.04) and after (mean change -0.01) starting DRV. However, 
these patients had a baseline HAZ of 0.04, a similar height on average to that of an uninfected 
population. Therefore, any “catch-up” growth would not be expected, and the lack of change in HAZ 
indicates that these patients grew as expected. 
Rapporteur’s Comments 
Overall, from the assessment of the final result of the study there is no evidence of an effect of 
darunavir-based ART regimen on the height of HIV-infected children in Europe aged <18 years. 
5.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
  Overall conclusion 
There was no evidence that initiating a DRV-containing ART regimen had any impact on growth, 
positively or negatively. This lack of effect on growth is similar to that seen for other PIs. 
The data submitted do not influence the benefit-risk balance for Prezista (darunavir) which remains 
unchanged. No changes to the current SmPC are warranted. The results of the study should be 
included in the RMP for Darunavir.  
  Recommendation  
No further action required.

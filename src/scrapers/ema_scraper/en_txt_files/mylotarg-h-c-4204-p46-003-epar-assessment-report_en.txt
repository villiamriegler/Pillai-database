1.  Introduction 
On 9th July 2018 the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study B1761026 for Gemtuzumab 
Ozogamicin (MYLOTARG), in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended.  
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
Study B1761026 is entitled, ‘Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (Mylotarg) Expanded Access Protocol for 
Treatment of Patients in the United States with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia 
(AML) Who May Benefit from Treatment and Have No Access to Other Comparable/Alternative 
Therapy’.  
This was a Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH)-sponsored study of an authorised medicinal product 
where 105 (31.7%) patients who were enrolled were <18 years of age. 
MYLOTARG received marketing approval in the United States on 01 September 2017 and has a US 
indication for the treatment of newly-diagnosed CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in adults, and 
relapsed or refractory CD33-positive acute myeloid leukemia in adults and in paediatric patients 2 
years and older. On 19 April 2018, Mylotarg received marketing authorization in the European Union 
(EU) for use in combination with daunorubicin (DNR) and cytarabine (AraC) for the treatment of 
patients aged 15 years and older with previously untreated, de novo CD33-positive AML, except acute 
promyelocytic leukaemia (APL).  
A Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) has been agreed for MYLOTARG with the European Medicines 
Agency (EMA)/Paediatric Committee (PDCO) (PIP EMEA-001733-PIP02-15-M01). 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
MYLOTARG is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) composed of the CD33-directed monoclonal antibody 
(mAb; hP67.6; recombinant humanized immunoglobulin G4, kappa antibody produced by mammalian 
cell culture in non-secreting null [NS0] cells) that is covalently linked to the cytotoxic agent N-acetyl 
(NAc) gamma calicheamicin. The antibody portion binds specifically to the CD33 antigen, a sialic acid 
dependent adhesion protein found on the surface of myeloid leukaemic blasts and immature normal 
cells of myelomonocytic lineage, but not on normal hematopoietic stem cells. Binding of the anti-CD33 
antibody portion of MYLOTARG to the CD33 antigen results in the formation of a complex, which is 
then internalized. Upon internalization, the calicheamicin derivative is released inside the lysosomes of 
the myeloid cell. The released calicheamicin derivative binds to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) in the 
minor groove resulting in DNA double-strand breaks and cell death. After administration of Hu-M195, 
another CD33-directed antibody, continuous renewed expression of CD33 antigens on the cell surface 
was observed, as measured by the cell mean peak fluorescence.  Mylotarg is available in the form of 
powder for concentrate for solution for infusion (1 mg/mL).

Study B1761026: ‘Gemtuzumab Ozogamicin (Mylotarg) Expanded Access Protocol for Treatment 
of Patients in the United States with Relapsed/Refractory Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML) 
Who May Benefit from Treatment and Have No Access to Other Comparable/Alternative 
Therapy’. 
2.3.2.  Clinical study B1761026 
Description 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
The primary objective of the study was to provide expanded access in accordance with FDA regulations 
to allow compassionate access to MYLOTARG for treatment of patients with CD33 positive acute 
myeloid leukaemia (AML) (including APL and myelodysplastic syndrome with rising or persistent blasts) 
who were thought to have the potential to derive clinical benefit and who had exhausted other 
appropriate and reasonable treatment options including investigational studies. No formal objectives 
were evaluated.  
This paper describes the safety results from this US only study.  
Study design 
This was an open-label (US only) expanded access protocol to treat patients with relapsed or refractory 
AML including myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) or relapsed or refractory acute promyelocytic 
leukaemia (APL). The protocol allowed the investigator to choose for each patient enrolled an optimal 
treatment plan, choosing from several MYLOTARG-containing regimens. The protocol allowed for 
treatment regimens tested in clinical trial settings and reported in peer reviewed journals. Data 
indicated that these treatment regimens could potentially benefit a patient with relapsed/refractory 
AML, MDS, or APL. 
The protocol allowed to use of MYLOTARG as a single agent at ≤9 mg/m2/dose for AML or in 
combination with all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and/or arsenic trioxide for treatment of APL. Other 
doses included the use of MYLOTARG up to 3 mg/m2/dose in combination with anthracycline, 
nucleoside-antagonist containing treatment regimens, or hypomethylating agents. The protocol was to 
remain open to provide compassionate access to MYLOTARG for patients within the US until the clinical 
development of the drug was discontinued, or when MYLOTARG was commercially available within the 
US, whichever occurred first. 
Study population /Sample size 
Patients were eligible for enrolment into the study only if they met all the inclusion criteria outlined in 
the protocol.

Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion: 
Patients aged ≥3 months with confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or refractory AML, including MDS, with 
persisting or rising blasts, and no other comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy available 
(including patients not eligible for or with access to investigational therapies through participation in a 
clinical trial) or confirmed diagnosis of relapsed or refractory APL with persisting or rising leukaemic 
burden (either by morphology, cytogenetic analysis or by molecular techniques), and no other 
comparable or satisfactory alternative therapy available (including patient was not eligible for or with 
access to investigational therapies via a clinical trial) were eligible to be included in this study. Patients 
with documentation that malignant cells expressed CD33 and patients with adequate non-hematologic 
organ function were eligible to be included in this study. 
Patients were allowed to re-enrol into the study and were assigned a different patient identification 
number at re-enrolment 
Treatments 
The following treatment regimens were used to treat patients with a diagnosis of relapsed or refractory 
AML. 
Treatment Regimen 1 – Monotherapy 
  A dose of ≤9 mg/m2 of MYLOTARG was administered on Day 1 and Day 15 of a 28-day 
treatment cycle. In the absence of a complete remission CRa [CRa was defined as ≤5% marrow 
blasts with complete recovery of haematopoiesis, defined as absolute neutrophil count (ANC) 
≥1000/µL and platelets ≥100,000/µL in the absence of growth factor or transfusion support], a 
total of 2 treatment cycles of MYLOTARG was administered. 
  Alternate treatment regimens tested in clinical trial settings and reported in peer reviewed 
journals were permitted where published results demonstrated that the regimen was tolerated 
and effective. 
Treatment Regimen 2 – MYLOTARG in combination with recognized anthracycline and/or nucleoside-
antagonist containing regimens 
  MYLOTARG was administered in combination with tested standard chemotherapy induction and 
consolidation regimens for AML where published results from a clinical trial demonstrated that 
the combination was tolerated and effective. 
Treatment Regimen 3 – Treatment for APL 
 
For APL only, MYLOTARG was administered as a monotherapy or in tested combinations with 
all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) and/or arsenic trioxide. 
 
For APL only, if CRa was achieved utilizing MYLOTARG as monotherapy or in combination with 
ATRA, a total of 5 post-remission treatment cycles of single agent MYLOTARG at a dose of ≤9 
mg/m2/dose on Day 1 of each 28 day post-remission treatment cycle may have been 
administered provided complete hematologic recovery was documented, platelet count 
≥100,000/µL and ANC ≥1000/µL prior to initiation of each MYLOTARG post-remission cycle. 
During such maintenance therapy, safety assessments were completed at least every 2 weeks. 
MYLOTARG as maintenance therapy was only allowed for patients with APL who achieved a CRa 
following the induction treatment regimen.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Safety Evaluations: Safety data were summarized for all patients who received at least 1 dose of 
MYLOTARG. Only Grade 3-5 AEs were recorded. Actual laboratory results were not collected on the 
case report form (CRF); however, laboratory results that met Grade 3-5 criteria were captured as AEs. 
For serious adverse events (SAEs), the active reporting period to Pfizer began from the time that 
patient provided informed consent up through and including 60 calendar days after the last 
administration of MYLOTARG. SAEs occurring after the active reporting period ended were reported to 
the Sponsor if the investigator became aware of them; at a minimum, all SAEs that the investigator 
believed had at least a reasonable possibility of being related to MYLOTARG were reported to the 
Sponsor. Grade 3-5 AEs (serious and non-serious) were recorded on the CRF from the time the patient 
had taken at least 1 dose of protocol treatment through 60 calendar days after last administration of 
MYLOTARG. 
If a patient began a new anticancer therapy, the AE reporting period for non-serious AEs ended at the 
time the new treatment was started. Death was reported if it occurred during the SAE reporting period, 
irrespective of any intervening treatment.

Grade 5 AEs assessed by the investigator as treatment-related occurred in 15 (4.5%) patients: 6 
(4.3%) and 9 (4.9%) patients in the monotherapy and combination groups, respectively. In the 
monotherapy group, treatment-related Grade 5 AEs were Sepsis (4 [2.9%] patients), Febrile 
neutropenia (2 [1.4%] patients), and Disease progression (1 [0.7%] patient). In the combination 
group, all treatment-related Grade 5 AEs were reported in 1 patient each. No treatment-related Grade 
5 AEs were reported in the treatment for APL group. 
Serious Adverse Events 
  All-causality SAEs were reported for a total of 193 (58.3%) patients: 101 (72.7%), 86 
(47.0%), and 6 (66.7%) patients in the monotherapy, combination, and treatment for APL 
groups, respectively. 
 
Treatment-related SAEs were reported for a total of 72 (21.8%) patients: 29 (20.9%), 39 
(21.3%), and 4 (44.4%) patients in the monotherapy, combination, and treatment for APL 
groups, respectively. 
 
In the monotherapy group, the most common treatment-related SAEs were Febrile neutropenia 
(14 [10.1%] patients), Sepsis (5 [3.6%] patients), and Platelet count decreased (3 [2.2%] 
patients). 
 
In the combination group, the most common treatment-related SAEs were Febrile neutropenia 
(11 [6.0%] patients), Septic shock and Sinusitis (3 [1.6%] patients each). 
 
In the treatment for APL group, the SAEs were all Grade 3 Febrile neutropenia (4 [44.4%] 
patients). 
Permanent Discontinuations Due to Adverse Events 
38 (11.5%) patients, with 25 (18.0%) monotherapy group; 11 (6.0%) combination therapy group and 
2 [22.2%] APL groups discontinued from study treatment and/or the study during the study period due 
to AEs. Disease progression, myelosuppression-related PTs such as Febrile neutropenia, Haemoglobin 
decreased, and Platelet count decreased; hepatotoxicity-related PTs such as Alanine aminotransferase 
increased, Aspartate aminotransferase increased, and Blood bilirubin increased; and infection-related 
PTs such as Sepsis were amongst most frequent. MAH states this is consistent with the known safety 
profile of MYLOTARG as well as the complications from the underlying disease.

In the paediatric subgroup, 2 (2.4%) patients had Upper gastrointestinal haemorrhage, 1 (1.2%) 
patient each had Mouth haemorrhage, and Pharyngeal haemorrhage. 3 [3.6%]) patients had 
Pulmonary haemorrhage (1 [1.2%] Grade 3 and 2 [2.4%] Grade 5). One (1 [1.2%]) patient had Grade 
5 Haemorrhage intracranial. All the paediatric patients were from the combination therapy group.  
For APL group, 1 (11.1%) patient had Haemorrhage intracranial. 
Tumour Lysis Syndrome Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) was reported in 3 (2.2%) patients in the 
monotherapy group (Grade 3: 1 [0.7%] patient and Grade 4: 2 [1.4%] patients). In the paediatric 
subgroup, 1 (4.8%) patient had Grade 3 TLS. In the combination therapy, 3 (1.6%) patients had TLS 
(all events of TLS in the combination group were Grade 3 severity). In the paediatric subgroup, 2 
(2.4%) patients had Grade 3 TLS. No patients in the treatment for APL group had TLS. 
Infusion-Related Reactions 
Infusion-related reactions were reported in 5 (3.6%) patients in the monotherapy group with 1 (4.8%) 
patient in the paediatric subgroup. In the combination therapy group, 3 (1.6%) patients had Infusion-
related reactions, none of whom were in the paediatric subgroup. All infusion-related reactions were 
Grade 3 in severity. No patients in the treatment for APL group had an Infusion-related reaction. 
Anaphylactic reaction (Grade 4) was reported in 1 (0.7%) patient in the monotherapy group. 
Renal Toxicity In the monotherapy group, 1 (0.7%) patient reported Grade 5 event of Renal failure 
and in the combination group, 1 (0.5%) patient reported Grade 3 Renal failure. Acute kidney injury 
was reported by 2 (1.4%) patients in the monotherapy group (1 [0.7%] patient each reported Grade 3 
and Grade 4 Acute kidney injury) and 3 (1.6%) patients in the combination group (1 [0.5%] patient 
reported Grade 3 and 2 [1.1%] patients reported Grade 4 Acute kidney injury. 
Neurotoxicity One (1) (0.5%) patient in the combination group reported Grade 3 Neuropathy 
peripheral. 
Second Primary Malignancy In the monotherapy group, 2 (1.4%) patients reported Chloroma (1 
[0.7%] each Grade 3 and Grade 5 [Patient 10461004]), 2 (1.4%) patients reported Neoplasm 
progression (both Grade 5), and 1 (0.7%) patient reported Neoplasm malignant (Grade 5). In the 
combination group, Infected neoplasm and Tumour pain were each reported by 1 (0.5%) patient (both 
Grade 3). No reports within the APL group. It is reported by MAH that PTs do not appear to reflect 
secondary malignancies. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
With regards to the safety conclusions the MAH states: 
Patients with Relapsed/Refractory AML, APL, and MDS have a significant unmet medical need. 
MYLOTARG given in this setting appeared to be generally tolerable with a manageable safety profile. 
The observed AEs were consistent with the known safety profile of MYLOTARG and complications of 
underlying disease, and there were no unexpected major safety findings in this study population. All-
causality AEs in >30% of patients (by treatment group) were Anaemia, WBC count decreased, Platelet 
count decreased, Neutrophil count decreased, and Febrile neutropenia. The frequency and types of 
other significant AEs such as VOD, myelosuppression, infection, haemorrhage, including Grade 5 AEs 
within these categories, were consistent with the known safety profile of MYLOTARG. In the paediatric 
population subgroup <18 years of age, no unexpected AE findings were observed based on the known 
safety profile of MYLOTARG and complications of underlying disease. In the monotherapy group, the 
most common all-causality Grade 3-5 AEs were ALT increased, Platelet count decreased, Anaemia, 
Febrile neutropenia, and WBC count decreased. In the combination therapy group, the most common

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/780336/2018

Grade 3-5 AEs by PT were Platelet count decreased, WBC count increased, Anaemia, Neutrophil count, 
Febrile neutropenia, Lymphocyte count decreased, Hypokalaemia, and AST increased. 
The MAH states that study B1761026 met its primary objective of providing access to MYLOTARG for 
the treatment of paediatric and adult patients with relapsed or refractory CD33-positive AML (including 
APL) or MDS who were good candidates to potentially derive clinical benefit from a CD33-directed 
therapy, and who had exhausted other appropriate and reasonable treatment options. An assessment 
of benefit could not be made, as efficacy and post-MYLOTARG hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
outcomes were not collected as a part of this expanded access study. The safety risks of MYLOTARG 
treatment, used in a broad range of doses and combination regimens were acceptable for this patient 
population with serious, life-threatening disease. Safety risks were generally consistent between the 
paediatric population and the entire safety population (adult and paediatric patients). No new safety 
signals were observed, and the AEs of MYLOTARG were consistent with its known safety profile. 
The SmPC states with respect to the paediatric population specifically:  
4. 2 Posology Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of MYLOTARG in patients less than 15 years of age has not been established. 
Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1, and 5.2 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
4. 8 Undesirable effects: Paediatric population  
The safety and efficacy of MYLOTARG in children and adolescents below the age of 15 years has not 
been established (see section 4.2). 
In the completed randomised paediatric Phase 3 Study AAML0531 (see section 5.1) of gemtuzumab 
ozogamicin combined with intensive first-line therapy in newly diagnosed children, and young adults 
with de novo AML aged 0 to 29 years, the safety profile was similar with that observed in the other 
studies of gemtuzumab ozogamicin combined with intensive chemotherapy in adult patients with de 
novo AML. However, the optimal dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin for paediatric patients was not 
established, since in Study AAML0531 during the second intensification period, a larger proportion of 
patients in the gemtuzumab ozogamicin arm experienced prolonged neutrophil recovery time (> 59 
days) as compared with the comparator arm (12.0% versus 6.3%), and more patients died during 
remission (4.2% versus 2.4%). 
5.1 Pharmodynamic properties   
In a randomised study (COG AAML0531) that evaluated standard chemotherapy alone or combined 
with MYLOTARG in 1,022 newly diagnosed children (94.3% of patients < 18 years of age), and young 
adults (5.7% of patients); median age was 9.7 years (range: 0.003-29.8 years), patients with de novo 
AML were randomly assigned to either standard 5-course chemotherapy alone or to the same 
chemotherapy with 2 doses of MYLOTARG (3 mg/m2/dose) administered once in induction Course 1 
and once in intensification Course 2. The study demonstrated that addition of MYLOTARG to intensive 
chemotherapy improved EFS (3 years: 53.1% versus 46.9%; HR 0.83; 95% CI: 0.70, 0.99; p=0.04) 
in de novo AML owing to a reduced relapse risk, with a trend towards longer OS in the MYLOTARG arm 
which was not statistically significant (3 years: 69.4% versus 65.4%; HR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.74, 1.13; 
p=0.39). However, it was also found that increased toxicity (post-remission toxic mortality) was 
observed in patients with low-risk AML which was attributed to the prolonged neutropenia that 
occurred after receiving gemtuzumab ozogamicin during intensification Course 2 (see sections 4.2 and 
4.8). Thus, the optimal dose of gemtuzumab ozogamicin for paediatric patients was not established 
(see section 4.2).

5.2 PK properties   
The results of the population modelling showed that the PK behaviour of gemtuzumab ozogamicin 
(hP67.6 antibody and unconjugated calicheamicin) is similar between adult and paediatric AML patients 
following the 9 mg/m2 dosing regimen. 
Rapporteurs Comments 
This  study  fulfils  its  primary  aim  of  providing  access  to  MYLOTARG  to  patients  with  life  threatening 
disease who have exhausted all clinical treatments and therefore have a significant unmet need. This is 
an  expanded  access  study  on  compassionate  grounds  and  therefore  cannot  be  expected  to  fulfil  the 
criteria of benefit: risk clinical trials and the data can only be contextualised within those boundaries in 
a  descriptive  manner.  This  study  is  not  mentioned  within  the  SmPC  for  Mylotarg.    The  majority  of 
information detailed in SmPC  is from an adult study (ALFA-0701) and post marketing measures. One 
Phase  3  study  (Study  AAML0531)  including  paediatric  subjects  is  detailed  in  SmPC  (as  above).  This 
product  is  licenced  only  in  patients  older  than  15  years.  Within  the  SmPC  it  is  stated  regarding  the 
paediatric  population  that  ‘the  safety  profile  was  similar  with  that  observed  in  the  other  studies  of 
gemtuzumab ozogamicin combined with intensive chemotherapy in adult patients with  de  novo  AML’. 
Overall the following comments are made:  
Study  design:    The  enrolment  and  re-enrolment  is  not  clear  in  terms  of  how  these  patients  were 
treated  with  respect  to  treatment  assignation.  Both  treatments  and  study  population  are  very 
heterogenous  with  3  broad  treatment  arms,  with  variable  dosing  of  MYLOTARG,  different  drugs 
regimes  used  in populations  with  differing  pathologies.    There  were deviations  from  protocol  detailed 
within abbreviated Case Study Report (aCSR). 
Safety evaluations are limited as only grade 3-5 events were captured for all patients receiving at least 
1 dose of MYLOTARG. Laboratory parameters themselves were not recorded and only captured as part 
of a Grade 3-5 AE. 
Safety  data  Although  the  MAH  states  that  some  of  the  treatment  related  effects  were  thought  by 
investigator  to  be  attributable  to  MYLOTARG,  this  would  have  been  challenging  to  determine  in  the 
context of confounding factors such chemotherapy and underlying disease for some of the AEs.  
MAH  stated  that  there  is  no  overall  difference  between  adult  and  paediatric data  for  ‘deaths,  serious 
adverse events and temporary discontinuation due to AE’ therefore these data were not presented by 
age sub groups. As these data were not presented by age subgroups it is difficult to draw conclusions 
exclusively with respect to the licensed paediatric population.  
Exposure to MYLOTARG was very variable with patients receiving 1 or more doses and dose levels up 
to 9 mg/m2. 
Within the SmPC, AEs are described in tabular form (Table 5 [combination study] and 6 [monotherapy 
study], Section 4.8) as all grades of AEs or grade 3-4 therefore making a direct comparison between 
this study and those adult studies described in SmPC somewhat challenging.  
Overall  95.2  %  AEs  were  reported  and  commonly  included  anaemia,  reduction  in  WBC,  platelets, 
neutrophils and febrile neutropenia. These AEs are included within the Mylotarg SmPC. The MAH states 
that no unexpected safety AEs and no unexpected TAEs were noted.  
Within the paediatric population, commonly reported Grade 3-5 TEAEs were decreased Platelet Count, 
Anaemia,  Febrile  neutropenia,  WBC  reduction,  and  Hypokalaemia  (monotherapy  group);  platelet  and 
WBC  reduction,  Anaemia,  Neutrophil  count  reduction,  Febrile  neutropenia,  Lymphocyte  count 
decreased,  Hypokalaemia,  Hypoxia,  Hyperglycaemia  and  Aspartate  aminotransferase  (AST)  increased 
(combination group). It is reported by MAH that no unexpected TEAEs  were noted based upon safety 
profile of disease and complication of disease and that safety data  were consistent with adult studies.  
Hypoxia  and  hypokalaemia  are  not  mentioned  in  SmPC  for  Mylotarg  but,  however,  are  mentioned  in 
FDA label. The way in which laboratory parameters were collected in this study do not allow a robust 
conclusion  on  these  observed  AEs  to  warrant  a  change  to  SmPC.  However,  it  is  recommended  that 
hypoxia  and  hypokalaemia  should  be  further  assessed  and  reported  in  following  PV  activities  for  this 
drug.

In this study, overall, most common TEAEs included anaemia, reduced WBC, Platelet reduction, febrile 
neutropenia  (monotherapy  group);  anaemia,  febrile  neutropenia,  WBC  reduction,  platelet  and 
neutrophil  count  reduction  (combination  group)  and  febrile  neutropenia  and  platelet  reduction  (APL 
treatment  group).  SmPC  (Section  4.8)  states  that  selected  data  considered  most  important  in 
understanding the drug’s safety profile, including TEAEs of haemorrhages, VOD, and severe infections 
and  all  determined  to  be  ADRs.  Although  AEs  of  special  interest  do  occur  including  VOD  and 
haemorrhage,  in  this  study  haemorrhage  is  much  less  common  with the  exception  of  the  APL group, 
than described in the SmPC. All the paediatric patients with haemorrhage were from the combination 
therapy group.  
Febrile  neutropenia,  although  mentioned  in  the  monotherapy  table  6  of  section  4.8  of  SmPC,  is  not 
described within the combination group of the SmPC and is also a common feature of the combination 
arm of this study.  
Treatment-related AEs, overall in the study population, (AEs that the investigator believed had at least 
a  reasonable  possibility  of  being  related  to  MYLOTARG)  were  reported  for  58.3%  patients 
overall:60.4%,  55.7%,  and  77.8%  patients  in  the monotherapy,  combination,  and  treatment  for  APL 
groups, respectively. Treatment-related SAEs were reported for 21.8% patients. Common TRAEs were 
similar  to  TEAEs  (anaemia,  thrombocytopenia,  febrile  neutropenia,  leukopenia).    Most  common  TRAE 
were  decreased  WBC,  platelet  count  and  Anaemia  (monotherapy  group);  Anaemia  and  Febrile 
neutropenia  (combination  group);  Febrile  neutropenia  and  Platelet  count  decreases  (APL  treatment 
group,). There are no paediatric patients in APL treatment group. It is difficult to determine how these 
AEs  could  be  solely  attributed  to  MYLOTARG  due  to  confounding  factors  of  underlying  disease  and 
treatment. 
Overall in the study population, common treatment related SAEs were febrile neutropenia, sepsis and 
reduced  platelet  (monotherapy  group)  ;  febrile  neutropenia,  septic  shock  and  sinusitis  (combination 
group) and febrile neutropenia (APL treatment group)  Clinically relevant SAEs described in the SmPC 
for  the  adult  studies  are  infusion  related  reactions  (2.5%),  thrombocytopenia  (21.7%),  and 
neutropenia  (34.3%)  for  the  monotherapy  group  and    hepatotoxicity,  including  VOD/SOS  (3.8%), 
haemorrhage  (9.9%),  severe  infection  (41.2%),  and  tumour  lysis  syndrome  (1.5%)  for  the 
combination group. In the SmPC in monotherapy adult studies the most common adverse reactions (> 
30%)  included  pyrexia,  nausea,  infection,  chills,  haemorrhage,  vomiting,  thrombocytopenia,  fatigue, 
headache,  stomatitis,  diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  and  neutropenia;  the  most  common  adverse 
reactions (> 30%) in the combination therapy adult study were haemorrhage and infection.   Keeping 
in mind  that AEs  tables within the SmPC (Section 4.8)  describe either all grades of AEs  or grade 3-4 
and this study does not capture the totality of AEs, a direct comparison between safety findings of this 
study and those already described in SmPC cannot be conducted.  
Deaths Overall 34.4 % of patients died within the reporting period and 20% in paediatric population. 
Although  a  large  number  it  is  not  surprising  given  the  nature  of  population  in  the  study.    Within  the 
paediatric subpopulation, 21 (20.0%) patients died: 7 (33.3%) patients in the monotherapy group and 
14 (16.7%) patients in the combination therapy group. In the monotherapy group, the most common 
Grade  5  AEs  were  Disease  progression  (5  [23.8%]  patients).  In  the  combination  group,  the  most 
common  Grade 5  AEs  were  Respiratory  failure  (3  [3.6%]  patients),  Disease  progression,  Sepsis,  and 
Pulmonary  haemorrhage  (2  [2.4%]  patients  each.  Respiratory  failure  is  not  mentioned  specifically 
within the SmPC, and although the MAH does not recognise it as a TRAE, respiratory failure is defined 
as  a  TEAE  within  the  abbreviated  clinical  summary  report.  Clarity  is  sought  from  the  MAH  as  to 
whether the respiratory failure seen in the paediatric population was thought to be treatment related. 
Multiorgan failure is mentioned in the SmPC.  
Discontinuations  due  to  AE  Overall  11.5%  patients  discontinued  and  MAH  states  that  the  reasons 
were  consistent  within  known  safety  profile  of  MYLOTARG  and  underlying  disease.    Frequently 
observed PTs included Disease progression, myelosuppression-related PTs such as Febrile neutropenia, 
Haemoglobin  decreased,  and  Platelet  count  decreased;  hepatotoxicity-related  PTs  such  as  Alanine 
aminotransferase increased, Aspartate aminotransferase increased, and Blood bilirubin increased; and 
infection-related PTs such as Sepsis.

In  the  SmPC  it  states  that  the  most  frequent  (≥  1%)  adverse  reactions  that  led  to  permanent 
discontinuation in monotherapy studies were infection, haemorrhage, multi-organ failure, and VOD.  In 
the  SmPC  the  most  frequent  (≥  1%)  adverse  reactions  that  led  to  permanent  discontinuation  in  the 
combination  therapy  study  were  thrombocytopenia,  VOD,  haemorrhage  and  infection  and  in  the 
monotherapy,  studies  were  infection,  haemorrhage,  multi-organ  failure,  and  VOD.  These  are 
differences  noted  in  discontinuation,  however,  it  is  difficult  to  make  direct  comparisons  with  SmPC-
included  data  and  this  more  complex  treatment  population  and  therefore  no  changes  to  the  SmPC 
wording is currently proposed. 
Significant adverse events included hepatotoxicity (VOD, SOS). All hepatotoxic (VOD) patients were 
from  the  paediatric  subgroup  and  frequency  ranged  for  0.7-1.2  %  which  appears  overall  to  be  less 
than stated in the SmPC, however it is difficult to make a direct numerical comparison. Similarly, this is 
the  case  for  haemorrhages  with  the  exception  of  the  APL  group  where  there  were  no  paediatric 
patients.  As  a  trend,  paediatric  patients  were  more  affected  by  myelosuppression  compared  to  adult 
patients.  In  the  paediatric  subgroup,  1  (4.8%)  patient  had  Grade  3  TLS  in  monotherapy  and 
combination  therapy,  3  (1.6%)  patients  had  TLS  (Grade  3  severity).  In  the  paediatric  subgroup,  the 
most  commonly  reported  AE  of  serious  infection  was  Device-related  infection  (monotherapy)  and 
sepsis,  sinusitis  and  device  related  infection  (combination  therapy).  Overall  these  significant  SAEs  as 
well as infusion related events are detailed within the current SmPC adult studies.  
Renal  toxicity,  neurotoxicity,  second  primary  malignancy  as  rare  adverse  events  were  found  in  this 
study but are not described within the clinical overview report as TRAEs or TEAEs; equally they are not 
described within the SmPC. It is not clear if these are adult or paediatric patients.  
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall the data presented in this expanded access study are generally consistent with the known 
safety profile of Mylotarg as well as those of the underlying disease.  Febrile neutropenia, although 
mentioned in the monotherapy adult study only (Section 4.8, table 6) of SmPC, is described here in 
the combination arm of this study. As discussed this maybe reflective of the fact that only selected AEs 
were included within Table 5 (combination therapy) of SmPC and this is a study in a very complex and 
heterogenous treatment population compared to the licensed indication. Hypoxia and hyperkalaemia 
are seen in paediatric population; and rare events of second primary malignancy, neurotoxicity, renal 
failure do occur, however it is unclear if these were treatment related and whether they occurred in 
adult or paediatric patients. Respiratory failure is mentioned as a cause of death but the MAH is asked 
to clarify whether this was related to treatment or not.  
Overall, the rapporteur considers that due to the study limitations, changes to the SmPC paediatric 
related safety information based on this study for MYLOTARG are not proposed at this time.

MAH RESPONSE 
For this expanded access study, only Grade 3-5 adverse events (AEs) and Grade 3-5 laboratory results 
that met Grade 3-5 criteria were captured as AEs and reported on the AE Case Report Form (CRF). AEs 
were reported for 315 (95.2%) patients overall: 134 (96.4%), 172 (94.0%), and 9 (100.0%) patients 
in the monotherapy, combination, and treatment for acute promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) groups, 
respectively (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR, Table 14.3.1.2.9.2). 
Deaths of patients in the study were not collected on a separate CRF; however, Grade 5 AEs were 
collected on the AE CRF. All deaths were reported if they occurred during the SAE reporting period 
(from the time the patient had taken at least 1 dose of protocol treatment through 60 calendar days 
after the last administration of Mylotarg) (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR). 
All-causality Grade 5 AEs were reported for 7 (33.3%) and 14 (16.7%) paediatric patients in the 
monotherapy and combination groups, respectively. No paediatric patients were included in the acute 
promyelocytic leukaemia (APL) group. More than 1 Grade 5 AE could have been reported per patient. 
In the monotherapy group, the most common Grade 5 AEs for paediatric patients were Disease 
progression (5 [23.8%] patients), Cardiac arrest, Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome, Chloroma, and 
Respiratory failure (each 1 [4.8%] patients). In the combination group, the most common Grade 5 AEs 
for paediatric patients were Respiratory failure (3 [3.6%) patients), Pulmonary haemorrhage, Sepsis, 
and Disease progression (each 2 [2.4%] patients) (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR, Table 
14.3.1.2.9.2). Narratives were written for all AEs leading to death (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR 
Section 14.3.3). 
Respiratory Failure 
Paediatric patients (in the monotherapy group), (in the combination treatment group) experienced 
Grade 5 respiratory failure. (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR, Table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and Table 16.2.7). Of 
the four reported cases, patient had an event of respiratory failure in the course of disease progression 
that was considered to be possibly related to Mylotarg by the investigator, however considered not 
related by the sponsor. Summaries of each of the events are listed below: 
Patient is an 11 year old male patient with relapsed AML who received Mylotarg as a single agent on 
07Aug2016. The patient was transferred from an outside institution with the inability to extubate him. 
At the time of transfer on 06Aug2016 the patient was stable on the ventilator, awake and alert with 
blood counts showing White blood cell count (WBC) of 7580 and 86% circulating blasts. 
Physical exam was remarkable for decreased breath sounds on the left and massive 
hepatosplenomegaly. His WBC decreased as did his percentage of circulating blasts but his lung 
disease persisted on the left side. WBC dropped from 6350 with 87% blasts to 0.800 with 68% blasts 
on 10Aug2016. A CT of the head/chest/abdomen on 10Aug2016 showed a large chloroma in the left 
frontal brain and in the brain stem, several in the abdomen (liver and kidneys) and a very large one in

the left chest with pleural effusion. After reviewing the CT findings, Mylotarg was stopped and the 
patient died on 10Aug2016. The investigator and company assessed that the events of respiratory 
failure, asystole, left lung pleural effusion, left frontal lobe chloroma, brainstem chloroma and left chest 
chloroma as unrelated to Mylotarg (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR Section 14.3.3.1). 
Patient is a 12 year old female with relapsed/refractory AML who was treated with fludarabine and 
cytarabine from 16Jun2017 to 20Jun2017 with Mylotarg on 17Jun2017 (Day2). On 17Jun2017, prior to 
receiving Mylotarg, the patient had new respiratory symptoms with a possible pneumonia and small 
pleural effusion on X-ray. Subsequent imaging showed worsening pleural effusions, requiring a right 
thoracentesis. The etiology was suspected to be due to prolonged neutropenia prior to the most recent 
therapy. On 26Jul2017, the patient died with a cause of death of disease progression, with pleural 
effusion and respiratory failure as fatal events. The investigator assessed pleural effusion and 
respiratory failure as possibly related to Mylotarg. The company assessed these events as unrelated to 
Mylotarg (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR Section 14.3.3.1). 
Patient is a 10-year-old male with relapsed/refractory AML who was treated with Mylotarg from 
03Apr2017 to 09Apr2017. The patient experienced respiratory failure and sepsis on 01Jun2017. On 
01Jun2017, patient started having altered mental status, difficulty walking and then vomited and likely 
aspirated based on his respiratory decompensation. In the emergency department, he was saturating 
in 80s on room air and was not responsive even to painful stimuli. He was intubated with great 
difficulty and multiple attempts due to copious secretions which had particulates suggestive of 
aspiration. He required high vent settings. Despite transfusions, he continued to have hypotension 
requiring several epinephrine boluses. After much work to stabilize him, he was transported to PICU. 
In the PICU patient continued to be hypotensive despite increasing doses of inotropes and boluses of 
calcium. As his blood pressures continued to decrease, parents elected to remove life support. The 
patient died on 01Jun2017, cause of death was disease progression, respiratory failure and sepsis. 
Autopsy was not done. The investigator and company assessed that the events of respiratory failure 
and sepsis as unrelated to Mylotarg (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR Section 14.3.3.1). 
Patient is a 12 year old male patient with refractory AML who received Mylotarg on 23Nov2016 as part 
of a combination regimen. The patient also received busulfan, IV intermittent, as transplant 
prophylactic at 30 mg every 6 hours (38 mg Q6H from 04Jan2017 to 07Jan2017). The patient was 
found to be in minimal residual disease (MRD) negative remission on 18Jan2017 and was referred for a 
bone marrow transplant. He started conditioning on 03Jan2017 for his procedure with prophylaxis for 
infection as well as veno-occlusive disease (VOD). Three days post transplant, the patient developed 
right upper quadrant pain and was diagnosed with venoocclusive disease. He was intermittently 
admitted to PICU for continuous venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH) for renal failure, hypervolemia and 
respiratory failure. 
He was readmitted to PICU on 21Feb2017 for respiratory failure secondary to a combination of 
idiopathic pulmonary syndrome, cytomegalovirus (CMV) pneumonitis and pulmonary edema requiring 
CVVH. He was started on broad spectrum antibiotics, ruxolitinib, entancercept in addition to 
mycophenolate mofetil (CELLCEPT) after developing air leak syndrome and on 10Mar2017 he was 
place on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (VV-ECMO) to aid in lung healing from air leak 
syndrome. He had improved subcutaneous emphysema but persistent bilateral pulmonary infiltrates on 
chest X-ray (CXR) while on VV-ECMO. On day 15 of VVECMO with multiple days of no clinical or 
radiographic evidence of subcutaneous emphysema, the decision was to increase his ventilator settings 
to challenge his respiratory effort. He then developed radiographic evidence of air leak syndrome again 
with subcutaneous emphysema and pneumomediastinum. Day 21 on VVECMO on 30Mar2017, family 
and multidisciplinary team decided to discontinue ECMO support. The patient died on 30Mar2017 with

withdrawal of support. The cause of death was respiratory failure, autopsy was performed. The 
investigator and company considered there was not a reasonable possibility that the event respiratory 
failure was related to Mylotarg (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR 14.3.3.1). 
Summary 
In all four cases reporting respiratory failure with a fatal outcome the patients suffered severe 
complications associated with the progressive nature of the underlying acute leukaemia or subsequent 
treatment. There were no new safety information or unusual trends identified that would have altered 
the established benefit-risk profile of the product. 
Renal Toxicity 
The following preferred terms are summarized as possibly associated with acute renal failure: 
Acute renal failure, Renal failure, and Acute kidney injury. 
No patients in any group experienced Acute renal failure. 
In the monotherapy group, there were no paediatric patients that experienced renal toxicity. There 
was 1 adult patient that experienced renal failure, and 2 adult patients that experienced acute kidney 
injury: 
Patient was an adult patient that experienced a grade 5 event of Renal failure in the setting of 
refractory AML, pancytopenia, septic arthritis, bacteremia, pneumonia, and ultimately multi-organ 
dysfunction. The Renal failure was not considered to be related to study drug but was attributed to 
disease under study (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR 14.3.3.1 and Table 16.2.7). 
Patient was an adult patient that experienced grade 4 acute kidney injury, following emergency room 
admission for diarrhea, chills, shortness of breath, cough, agitation and symptoms of septic shock. 
Blood culture was positive for Gram positive cocci. The investigator concluded that the event of acute 
kidney injury was not related to study drug. Concurrent grade 4 events of platelet count decreased, 
and tumour lysis syndrome and grade 5 events of febrile neutropenia and sepsis were assessed as 
possibly related to Mylotarg by the investigator (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR 14.3.3.1 and Table 
16.2.7). Patient was an adult patient that experienced grade 3 acute kidney injury in the setting of 
relapsed AML, acute respiratory distress syndrome, hypotension, left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 
<15%) and decreased platelets and white blood cells. The acute kidney injury was attributed to 
disease under study and was not considered related to study drug (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR, 
Table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and Table 16.2.7). 
In the combination group, 1 adult patient experienced renal failure, and 1 adult patient and 2 
paediatric patients experienced acute kidney injury: 
Patient is an adult patient who experienced grade 3 Renal failure concurrent with an event of 
fungaemia and grade 4 neutropenia. The events of fungaemia and renal failure were not considered to 
be related to study drug and were attributed to disease under study (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR, 
Table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and Table 16.2.7). 
Patient is an adult patient who experienced acute kidney injury. This 20-year-old female patient was 
admitted for treatment with Mylotarg plus fludarabine, cytarabine, G-CSF (FLAG) chemotherapy. 
Treatment began on 10May2016 with most recent dose on 04Jun2016. On 05Jun2016, the patient 
developed sepsis (neutropenic with Gram-positive cocci in blood cultures), pulmonary edema and 
respiratory failure / acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). The patient’s status worsened with

intubation required on 10Jun2016. Acute kidney injury started on 11Jun2016 with grade 4 creatinine 
elevation starting from 16Jun2016. Serious adverse event was reported as acute kidney injury (grade 
4 creatinine elevation) with onset date 11Jun2016 and serious as life-threatening and resulted in 
death. The patient started dialysis for acute kidney injury with continuous renal replacement therapy 
(CRRT) on 16Jun2016. The events, multi-organ failure and acute kidney injury overlapped, as acute 
kidney injury never resolved: only worsened and ended at death. The patient started to have multi-
organ failure, and this resulted in death on 19Jun2016. The investigator did not believe that the death 
was related to fatal disease progression. The investigator considered there was a reasonable possibility 
that the event acute kidney injury (grade 4 creatinine elevation) was related to study drug Mylotarg 
and concomitant drug FLAG chemotherapy, but unrelated to clinical trial procedures. Acute kidney 
injury with fatal outcome was considered unrelated by the sponsor (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR 
14.3.3.1, Table 16.2.7). 
Patient is a 17 year old patient who experienced grade 4 acute kidney injury following events of 
neutropenia, decreased platelet count, and hypoxia. Acute kidney injury was attributed to ‘other’ 
cause that was not disease or study drug. (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR, Table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and 
Table 16.2.7). 
Patient is an 8 year old patient who was enrolled in the combination group and experienced an event of 
acute kidney injury that was considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. This patient 
received Mylotarg on 15Sept2017 and on 24Sept2017 was brought to the emergency department with 
febrile neutropenia. The patient developed nausea that was complicated by emesis and subsequent 
fall. While in the emergency department, the patient started complaining of generalized abdominal 
pain, as a result, the patient was transferred to the PICU 24Sep2017 for acute respiratory failure and 
septic shock. Lab results showed that the patient was pancytopenic, acidotic and had hypokalaemia 
and was now in acute renal failure. On early morning 25Sep2017 exam, the patient's breath sounds 
were more diminished and the patient's liver edge became palpable 5-7 cm below the costal margin 
concerning for induced cardiogenic shock in addition to septic shock. Blood culture was positive for 
gram positive cocci and the patient was started on broad spectrum antibiotics. Therapeutic measures 
were taken as a result of sepsis. The patient also experienced pulmonary haemorrhage with onset date 
29Sep2017. He died on 29Sep2017, preliminary cause of death was noted to be pulmonary 
haemorrhage due to acute respiratory failure and coagulopathy in setting of pancytopenia. Cause of 
death was confirmed as pulmonary haemorrhage; no autopsy was performed. The event of renal 
failure was considered to be related to study drug. The investigator and sponsor considered there was 
a reasonable possibility that the events sepsis and pulmonary haemorrhage was related to study drug 
Mylotarg and to concomitant drug azacitidine, but unrelated to clinical trial procedure (Module 5.3.5.4 
B1761026 CSR 14.3.3.1, and Table 16.2.7). 
There were no patients in the APL group who experienced renal toxicity. 
Summary 
In all seven cases reporting renal toxicity, the patients suffered complications associated with 
myelosuppression, infection, and the progressive nature of the underlying AML. There were no new 
safety information or unusual trends identified that would have altered the established benefit-risk 
profile of the product. 
Neurotoxicity 
The following preferred terms are summarized as possibly associated with neurotoxicity: 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/780336/2018  
Page 22/27 
 
 
 
 
 
Demyelination, Neuropathy peripheral, and Cranial nerve disorder. There were no patients in the 
monotherapy group or the APL group who reported a Neurotoxicity preferred term. 
Patient was an adult patient in the combination group who experienced Grade 3 Neuropathy peripheral 
concurrent with events of paraplegia (verbatim term: paralysis from low chest down), low 
lymphocytes, low granulocytes, lymphopaenia, asthenia and clostridium difficile infection. The 
investigator attributed this event of neuropathy peripheral to the disease under study and not to study 
drug. The event of paraplegia (grade 3) resolved and was also attributed to the disease under study 
(Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR, Table14.3.1.2.9.2 and Table 16.2.7). 
Secondary Malignancy 
Preferred terms from the system organ class (SOC) of Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified 
are summarized as possibly associated with second primary malignancy. Acute myeloid leukaemia is 
the disease under study, so was not considered to be a second primary malignancy and is not 
summarized. 
In the monotherapy group, 2 paediatric patients experienced Chloroma: 
Patient is an 18 month old male who experienced grade 3 chloroma in the setting of refractory AML, 
multi-system organ failure due to progressive disease. This event of chloroma was considered to be 
unrelated to study drug and was attributed to AML disease progression (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR 
14.3.3.1, Table 16.2.7). 
Patient is an 11 year old male who experienced grade 5 chloroma in the setting of advanced AML. 
Events are summarized in this document, under the heading of Respiratory Failure. The event of grade 
5 chloroma was not considered to be related to study drug but was attributed to disease progression 
(Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR 14.3.3.1, Table 16.2.7). 
Also in the monotherapy group, 2 adult patients (patients 10131004 and 10661002) experienced 
Neoplasm progression, both of which were grade 5, unrelated to study drug and were attributed to 
disease under study. Both events were summarized in narrative reports as progression of their AML 
(Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR 14.3.3.1, Table 16.2.7). 
One adult patient (patient) in the monotherapy group experienced grade 5 unrelated Neoplasm 
malignant (attributed to disease under study). This event is summarized in the narrative as being 
progression of the patient’s AML (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR 14.3.3.1). 
In the combination group, 1 adult patient (patient) experienced grade 3 Infected neoplasm (infectious 
cervical mass), concurrent with anemia, febrile neutropenia and fungal pneumonia. This event was 
considered to be unrelated to study drug and was attributed to disease under study (Module 5.3.5.4 
B1761026 CSR, Table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and Table 16.2.7). 
Also, in the combination group, paediatric patient experienced grade 3 Tumour pain, which was 
concurrent with neutrophil and lymphocyte count decreased and paraesthesia. The event of tumour 
pain was considered to be unrelated to study drug and attributed to disease under study (Module 
5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR, Table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and Table 16.2.7). 
No patients in the treatment for APL group reported preferred terms in the SOC of Neoplasms benign, 
malignant, and unspecified (Module 5.3.5.4 B1761026 CSR, Table 14.3.1.2.9.2 and Table 16.2.7). 
Summary 
The search for “second primary malignancy” included a broad preferred terms search and thus it 
identified AEs other than second primary malignancies (e.g., non-malignant AEs, primary 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

malignancies). In the study none of the identified AEs were considered to be secondary primary 
malignancies. 
Conclusion 
The observed AEs were consistent with the known safety profile of Mylotarg and there were no 
unexpected major safety findings in this study population. In this study, both adult and paediatric 
patients experienced events of renal toxicity and events that fall under the SOC of Neoplasm benign, 
malignant and unspecified while one adult patient experienced an event associated with neurotoxicity. 
The majority of the events summarized were due to the underlying disease and/or effects of prior 
chemotherapy and in the setting of myelosuppression. There were no new safety information or 
unusual trends identified that would alter the established benefit-risk profile of the product. 
Assessment of MAH response  
Respiratory failure 
Of the 4 patients described within the paediatric population with respiratory failure, the MAH explains 
that 3 out the 4 were not related to MYLOTARG treatment. One case of respiratory failure was possibly 
related to MYLOTARG by the investigator, but the company assessed these events as unrelated to 
MYLOTARG. The explanation provided that this was unrelated to MYLOTARG is acceptable as 
respiratory events occurred prior to commencing MYLOTARG. 
Renal toxicity 
Monotherapy group: 
The MAH provided the following information: 
• 
There were no paediatric cases of renal toxicity.  (1 adult with acute renal failure not attributed 
to MYLOTARG but to disease; and 2 adults with Acute Kidney Injury (AKI), not related to study drug 
but to disease).  
Combination group there were:   
• 
• 
1 adult patient with renal failure not attributable to MYLOTARG but the disease.  
1 adult patient with AKI. The investigator considered that there was reasonable possibility that 
AKI was due to MYLOTARG and concomitant drug chemotherapy. The AKI with fatal outcome was 
considered unrelated by the sponsor. It is recognised that events surrounding this case would be 
difficult to attribute solely to MYLOTARG, however, this potential serious ADRs should be continued to 
be monitored.  
• 
Paediatric patients were a 17 year old with AKI which the MAH reports were unrelated to 
MYLOTARG. An 8 year old with AKI and subsequent renal failure was considered to be related to the 
study drug. The patient died with cause of death noted to be pulmonary haemorrhage due to acute 
respiratory failure and coagulopathy in setting of pancytopenia. The investigator and sponsor 
considered that a reasonable possibility that events of sepsis and pulmonary haemorrhage where 
related to the study drug and to concomitant drug use but unrelated to clinical trial procedure.  
The events surrounding renal toxicity should be continued to be monitored, especially as they are not 
detailed in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.

Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/780336/2018  
Page 24/27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Neurotoxicity 
There were no paediatric patients within this group and the adult patient in the combination group who 
experience neurotoxicity, not related to MYLOTARG. 
Secondary Primary malignancies 
Monotherapy group there were 
• 
2 paediatric patients experienced chloroma, both attributed to disease progression and not 
MYLOTARG.  
• 
3 adult patients experience neoplasm related to disease under study and not MYLOTARG. 
Combination group there were 
• 
• 
1 paediatric patient experienced tumour pain not related to MYLOTARG and related to disease. 
1 adult patient infected neoplasm not related to MYLOTARG but to the disease under study.  
None of the AEs were considered to be secondary primary malignancies. 
Conclusion 
In view of the MAH’s clarification, it is agreed that the majority of events were related to confounding 
factors such as underlying disease, myelosuppression or chemotherapy related effects.  A change to 
the SmPC with regards to this safety information is not recommended at this stage.  
However, this study does provide additional evidence regarding treatment for relapsed or refractory 
AML in the paediatric population; although the MAH does not plan to seek this indication, it is strongly 
recommended, that the totality of available paediatric data from relapsed and refractory AML studies 
are reviewed and submitted to seek a paediatric indication for this patient group. The MAH is 
encouraged to enter a meaningful discussion with regulatory authorities on the details of such a 
submission, overcoming any limitations of bibliography data and taking into account also the current 
clinical experience on the field.  
Finally, the MAH should continue safety monitoring of ADRs including those for renal toxicity, hypoxia, 
hypokalaemia; and febrile neutropenia in the combination therapy.

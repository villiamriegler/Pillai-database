1.  Background information on the procedure 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Swedish Orphan Biovitrum AB 
(publ) submitted to the European Medicines Agency on 17 December 2021 an application for a 
variation. 
The following changes were proposed:

C.I.13: Submission of the final report from study SAVE-MORE, as requested as part of procedure 
EMEA/H/C/000363/II/086. This is a prospective, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of the early start of anakinra treatment guided by suPAR in patients 
with LRTI by SARS-CoV-2 in improving the clinical state of COVID-19 patients over 28 days as 
measured by the ordinal scale of the 11-point WHO-CPS. 
The requested variation proposed no amendments to the Product Information. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The MAH has submitted the final clinical study report (CSR) for the SAVE-MORE study (dated 
07.02.22) as requested in the type II variation procedure for extension of indication of Kineret 
(EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0086). 
The database lock for SAVE-MORE occurred on August 18, 2021 (last patient last visit June 28, 2021) 
and is based on data collected until Day 90 (11-point WHO-CPS data, AE/SAE and study drug 
administration) for all patients. Safety Day 90 data has been submitted as part of the 3rd request for 
supplementary information (RSI) and assessed in the CHMP AR for the procedure II/0086. The interim 
database lock on 29 April 2021 (data submitted in the initial CSR), unblinding, and analysis were 
performed when the last patient had completed Day 28 but prior to the planned study follow-up of 60 
and 90 days.  
This final CSR was based on data collected until Day 90 for all patients. The last Day 90 follow-up was 
completed on June 28, 2021. 
Efficacy (primary and secondary endpoints) were previously reported in the iCSR; the only updates to 
efficacy were time until discharge from the hospital and intensive care unit (ICU) by Day 90. Safety 
data have been updated to include long-term results from the SAVE-MORE study up to Day 90.  
In the final CSR, the number of patients that received dexamethasone during treatment has been 
revised. Revisions have been made to the clinical overview and summary of clinical efficacy. The 
percentage of patients receiving dexamethasone has been amended from 86,4% to 85.9%. The 
dexamethasone percentage in the SmPC (section 5.1) is also proposed by the MAH to be revised in line 
with the final CSR. 
In the final CSR, subgroup analyses including Charlson’s comorbidity index (CCI) ≥2 vs <2, soluble 
urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR) >9 ng/mL vs ≤9 ng/mL, sex, age ≥65 years vs <65 
years, baseline remdesivir use, dexamethasone use, baseline disease severity and the need for 
oxygen, and BMI category were performed on the primary endpoint. Regardless of subgroup category

anakinra treatment was beneficial. 
In the final CSR data on absolute changes of the WHO-CPS scores by day 60 and day 90 from baseline 
Day 1 were submitted. An ordinal regression analysis showed that anakinra treatment was favourable 
in reducing the odds for higher scores on the 11-point WHO-CPS at Days 60 and 90 from baseline Day 
1 (Day 60 adjusted OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.58, p<0.0001; Day 90 adjusted OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 
0.34 to 0.74, p=0.001). 
Safety data submitted in the final CSR are overall in alignment with safety data up to Day 90 that was 
earlier submitted and assessed in CHMP AR for the procedure II/0086. The safety profile remains 
favourable with no new safety signals identified apart from the TEAE hypothermia occurring more 
frequently in the anakinra+SoC group compared to the placebo+SoC group (7.4% vs. 4.2%) not 
reported earlier in the treatment of hospitalised adult patients with COVID-19 (OC). The frequency and 
severity of the subset of ADRs observed (neutropenia, elevated hepatic enzymes, rash, and injection 
site reactions), following the 10-day dosing regimen of anakinra, were consistent with the known 
safety profile of anakinra in the licensed indications.  
Overall, the single pivotal study SAVE-MORE supports that there is a clinical benefit of anakinra in 
adult COVID-19 patients with pneumonia who are at risk of developing severe respiratory failure based 
on suPAR ≥ 6 ng/ml. Also, it was demonstrated that anakinra treatment had a beneficial effect on time 
to progression to severe respiratory failure, on time until hospital discharge and on mortality, as 
compared to SoC treatment in the studied population.  
The safety profile of Kineret for treatment of adult COVID-19 patients with pneumonia who are at risk 
of developing severe respiratory failure is in general positive. The overall occurrence of AEs, SAEs 
including infections, discontinuations and deaths were fewer for Kineret treated patients compared to 
placebo. No new safety signals were identified in the treatment of hospitalised adult patients with 
COVID-19. The safety data are overall consistent with the known safety profile of Kineret for the 
approved indications with no new safety signals. 
The benefit-risk balance of Kineret remains positive.

5.  Introduction 
5.1.  Medicinal product 
Anakinra (Kineret) is currently approved for the treatment of RA in the US (2001), Canada (2002), the 
EU/EEA (2002), Australia (2003), and Israel (2011). Kineret is also approved for all forms of CAPS in 
the EU/EEA (2013), Israel (2014), Australia (2014), and Russia (2021) and for the most severe form 
of CAPS, i.e., NOMID, in the US (2012) and Canada (2017). Additionally, Kineret is approved for Still’s 
disease (including SJIA and AOSD) in the EU/EEA (2018) and for the treatment of SJIA in Australia 
(2015). Kineret is also approved for FMF in the EU/EEA (2020) and Israel (2020) and for DIRA in the 
US (2020). Anakinra is a recombinant human IL-1Ra that blocks the biological activity of cytokine IL-1 
(IL-1α and IL-1β) by competitively inhibiting its binding to the IL-1RI, thereby controlling active 
inflammation 
5.2.  Targeted indication 
Section 4.1 Therapeutic Indications: COVID-19 
Kineret is indicated for the treatment of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in adult patients with 
pneumonia requiring supplemental oxygen (low- or high-flow oxygen) who are at risk of progressing to 
severe respiratory failure determined by plasma concentration of soluble urokinase plasminogen 
activator receptor (suPAR) ≥6 ng/ml (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1). 
Section 5.1 Pharmacodynamic Properties: Clinical efficacy and safety in COVID-19 
The safety and efficacy of Kineret was evaluated in patients with COVID-19 pneumonia ≥18 years of 
age with a risk of developing severe respiratory failure in a randomized doubleblind placebo-controlled 
study. The patient population enrolled into the SAVE-MORE study was hospitalized with confirmed 
COVID-19 pneumonia (LRTI radiologically confirmed by chest X-ray or CT) and was considered to be at 
risk of developing SRF, determined by an elevation in suPAR (≥6 ng/ml). Patients had suPAR level ≥6 
ng/ml measured by the suPARnostic Quick Triage kit. These patients had not yet progressed to SRF 
(i.e., exclusion criteria were: pO2/FiO2 ratio less than 150 mmHg or the requirement of mechanical 
ventilation, NIV, or ECMO). The majority of patients received low- or high-flow supplementary oxygen 
at screening (81.6%). The study enrolled 606 patients and efficacy analysis was performed in the 
intention-to-treat (ITT) population comprising of 594 patients of whom 189 patients were randomized 
to the placebo+SoC arm and 405 patients to the anakinra+SoC arm. The majority of the patients 
(91.4%) had severe COVID-19 pneumonia and 8.6% of patients had moderate COVID-19 pneumonia 
at start of treatment. 85.9% of patients received dexamethasone. The mean (SD) duration of Kineret 
treatment was 8.4 (2.1) days. The primary endpoint of the study was the comparative 11-point WHO 
Clinical Progression ordinal Scale (CPS) between the two arms of treatment by Day 28. The 11-point 
WHO CPS provides a measure of illness severity across a range from 0 (not infected); 1-3 (mild 
disease), 4-5 (hospitalized – moderate disease), 6-9 (hospitalized – severe disease with increasing 
degrees of NIV, MV and ECMO) to 10 (dead). Of the patients randomised in the SAVE-MORE study 
8.6% had a baseline WHO-CPS of 4; 84.7% had a baseline WHO-CPS of 5 and 6.7% had a baseline 
WHO-CPS of 6. In patients treated with Kineret for up to 10 days a significant improvement of the 
clinical status according to the WHO-CPS was demonstrated by Day 28 compared to placebo (OR: 0.36 
[95% CI 0.26 to 0.50] P<0.001). Improvement of the patients’ clinical status was seen by Day 14. The 
treatment benefit of Kineret was supported by increase in the number of patients fully recovered and 
reduction in the number of patients who progressed to severe respiratory failure or death compared to 
placebo. No new safety signals or safety concerns were observed from the use of Kineret for treatment

of COVID-19. 
5.3.  Objective of the submission 
This type II variation is being submitted in order to fulfill the commitment to submit the final CSR for 
the SAVE-MORE study, a Phase 3, pivotal, confirmatory, prospective, multicenter, double-blind, 
randomized, placebo-controlled study conducted at 37 study sites (29 in Greece and 8 in Italy) by the 
Hellenic Sepsis Study Group. This post-authorization measure was agreed with the EMA in procedure 
No. EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0086 for extension of indication for Kineret.  
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of early start of anakinra treatment 
guided by suPAR in patients with LRTI by SARS-CoV-2 in improving the clinical outcome of COVID-19 
over 28 days as measured by the ordinal scale of the 11-point WHO-CPS.  
Secondary study objectives were as follows: 
•  Clinical efficacy of anakinra treatment guided by suPAR in patients with LRTI by SARS-CoV-2 
as assessed by: 
o the changes of the ordinal scale of the 11-point WHO-CPS at Days 14 and 28 
from baseline Day 1 
o the changes of the SOFA score at Days 7 and 14 from baseline Day 1 
o the duration of hospital and ICU stay 
o the association of clinical efficacy with the time of start of anakinra from the onset of 
COVID-19 
•  Effect of anakinra treatment guided by suPAR on biomarkers of patients with LRTI bySARS-
CoV-2 
•  Safety of anakinra in COVID-19 
Efficacy as assessed by the primary and secondary endpoints as well as biomarker data and safety 
data b Day 28 was reported in the previously submitted iCSR. The final CSR provided in this type II 
variation submission includes safety data by Day 90, other efficacy endpoints (e.g., 11-point WHO-CPS 
by Days 60 and 90), and post-hoc subgroup analyses. 
CHMP comments 
The  MAH  has  submitted  the  final  CSR  for  the  SAVE-MORE  study  (dated  07.02.22)  fulfilling  the  post-
authorisation measure according to procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0086 for extension of indication 
of Kineret. 
The database lock for SAVE-MORE occurred on August 18, 2021 (last patient last visit 28th June 2021) 
and  is  based  on  data  collected  until  Day  90  (11-point  WHO-CPS  data,  AE/SAE  and  study  drug 
administration)  for  all  patients.  Safety  Day  90  data  has  been  submitted  as  part  of  the  3rd  RSI  and 
assessed  in  the  CHMP  AR.  The  interim  database  lock  on  29  April  2021(data  submitted  in  the  iCSR), 
unblinding, and analysis were performed when the last patient had completed Day 28 but prior to the 
planned study follow-up of 60 and 90 days.  
This final CSR was based on data collected until Day 90 for all patients. The last Day 90 follow-up was 
completed on 28 June 2021.

Background and overview of clinical efficacy 
An overview of the SAVE-MORE study is presented in Table 2.7.3 - 1. 
Details on the study findings can be found in Section 2.7.3.2.1. 
8.1.  Disposition and demographics 
In the SAVE-MORE study, 1060 patients were screened from December 2020 through March 2021, and 
606 patients were enrolled at 37 study sites (29 in Greece and 8 in Italy): 194 patients were 
randomized to placebo+SoC treatment, and 412 patients were randomized to anakinra+SoC 
treatment. Of these, 189 patients in the placebo+SoC group and 405 patients in the anakinra+SoC 
group were included in the FAS/Safety Analysis Set (N=594). 6 patients allocated to the placebo+SoC 
group and 13 patients in the anakinra+SoC group were reported as lost to follow-up at Day 60. 10

patients allocated to the placebo+SoC group and 17 patients in the anakinra+SoC group were reported 
as lost to follow-up at Day 90. Disposition of patients is summarized in SAVE-MORE CSR, Figure 10-1. 
The overall mean age of the 594 patients in the FAS, as previously reported in the iCSR, was 61.9 
years, 57.9% of patients were male, and the mean BMI was 29.5 kg/m2. The overall mean (SD) 
Charlson’s Comorbidity Index score for all patients was 2.2 (1.6), and the overall mean (SD) SOFA 
score was 2.4 (1.1). As per the WHO pneumonia severity classification at the time of screening, the 
majority of the patients (81.6%) were identified with severe COVID-19 pneumonia, and 18.4% of 
patients were identified with moderate COVID-19 pneumonia. Furthermore, the SOFA score of organ 
dysfunction was similar between the 2 groups at baseline (2.4 for anakinra+SoC and 2.5 for 
placebo+SoC), and the same applied for the WHO-CPS of Day 1 before the start of treatment. The 
overall median time (Q1 to Q3) from symptom onset to enrollment was 9 days, and the median time 
from hospital admission to enrollment was 2 days. 
CHMP comments 
The  FAS  analysis  included  594  patients,  of  these,  189  patients  in  the  placebo+SoC  group  and  405 
patients  in  the  anakinra+SoC  group  with  disposition  and  demographics  as  previously  reported  in  the 
iCSR. 
8.2.  Primary efficacy endpoint 
The primary endpoint of the SAVE-MORE study was the patient’s WHO-CPS score by Day 28 in the FAS 
population and was previously reported in the iCSR. Anakinra treatment demonstrated significant 
improvement of the clinical status of patients with COVID-19 as measured by the WHO-CPS score by 
Day 28 compared to placebo (adjusted OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.50; p<0.0001 in favor of 
anakinra+SoC treatment; SAVE-MORE CSR, Figure 11-1 and Table 11-1). In the multivariate ordinal 
regression analysis, allocation to the anakinra+SoC treatment was the only variable that was 
significantly associated with the final outcome.  
Assessment report  
EMA/609606/2022  
Page 11/30 
 
 
 
 
CHMP comments 
The prespecified primary study endpoint, the comparative 11-point WHO-CPS between the two arms of 
treatment (expressed as the OR for allocation to lower severity after anakinra treatment compared to 
placebo) by Day 28 was previously reported in the iCSR. This was assessed by ordinal regression analysis 
unadjusted  and  adjusted  for  other  factors  as  given  I  table  11-1  (administration  of  dexamethasone, 
severe COVID-19, BMI>30kg/m2 and country). The adjusted (multivariate) analysis anakinra+SoC was 
favourable  (OR  0.36;  95  %  CI  0.26  to  0.50;  P<0.001),  hence  the  primary  endpoint  was  met  and 
statistically significant. No new data was submitted with the final CSR. 
Supportive analyses of the primary endpoint 
The 3 prespecified analyses supported the primary endpoint measured with the WHO-CPS and 
confirmed the clinical benefit of anakinra+SoC treatment as follows: 
•  Significant improvement of the clinical status was already seen by Day 14 in patients 
receiving anakinra+SoC compared to placebo+SoC (adjusted OR of WHO-CPS by Day 14: 
0.58; 95% CI: 0.42 to 0.79; p<0.001; SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 11-3). 
Assessment report  
EMA/609606/2022  
Page 12/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
The treatment benefit of anakinra was demonstrated by the increase in the number of 
patients fully recovered (i.e., discharged and no viral infection) (adjusted OR: 0.36; 95% CI: 
0.25 to 0.53; p<0.0001; SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 11-5) and the reduction in the number of 
patients who progressed to SRF or death (adjusted OR: 0.46; 95% CI: 0.26 to 0.83; 
p=0.010; SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 11-6).  
Assessment report  
EMA/609606/2022  
Page 13/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Anakinra treatment prevented the progression to SRF or death by Day 14 (adjusted HR: 0.67; 
95% CI: 0.47 to 0.93; p=0.017; SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 11-7) and Day 28 (adjusted HR: 
0.66, 95% CI: 0.47 to 0.91; p=0.012; SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 11-8). 
CHMP comments 
Three supportive analyses of the primary endpoint measured by the 11-point WHO-CPS score was carried 
out, as reported in the iCSR. Overall the outcomes were beneficial for anakinra+SoC treatment 
No new data submitted in the final CSR.

Post-hoc survival analysis 
Anakinra+SoC treatment reduced Day 28 mortality compared to placebo+SoC (3.2 % versus 6.9 %; 
adjusted HR: 0.39, 95% CI: 0.18 to 0.86; p=0.020; SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 11-9).  
CHMP comments 
A  post-hoc  analysis  showed  that  the  univariate  Cox  regression  analysis  of  time  to  death  by  Day  28 
showed that anakinra treatment reduced the mortality compared to placebo (HR: 0.45, 95% CI 0.21-
0.98,  P=0.045).  Also,  6.9%  of  patients  in  the  placebo+SoC  group  and  3.2%  of  patients  in  the 
anakinra+SoC group died by Day 28 (data not shown). 
In the final CSR post-hoc subgroup analyses included CCI ≥2 vs <2, suPAR >9 ng/mL vs ≤9 ng/mL, sex, 
age  ≥65  years  vs  <65  years,  baseline  remdesivir  use,  dexamethasone  use,  baseline  disease  severity 
and the need for oxygen, and BMI category were performed on the primary endpoint. These analyses 
demonstrated that patients benefited from anakinra treatment regardless of subgroup category. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint  
All 5 sensitivity analyses confirmed further the analysis of the primary endpoint (SAVE-MORE CSR, 
Table 11-10 to Table 11-14).

CHMP comments 
Five sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoint were carried out. The first four sensitivity analyses were 
univariate and multivariate ordinal regression analyses of the primary study outcome (WHO-CPS) at Day 
28 in e.g. the PP population.  
The first four sensitivity analysis on the primary endpoint were beneficial to anakinra and supported the 
primary endpoint. The fifth sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the estimated treatment effect when 
adjusting for stratifying factors. 
No new data submitted in the final CSR. 
8.3.  Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints up to Day 28 (as previously reported in the iCSR) 
generally showed a significant benefit from anakinra+SoC treatment compared to placebo+SoC 
treatment (SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 11-15):

The absolute decrease of the 11-point WHO-CPS score from baseline by Day 28 was 
significantly greater in the anakinra+SoC group compared to placebo+SoC group (adjusted 
OR: 0.40; 95% CI: 0.29 to 0.55; p<0.0001). 
The absolute decrease of the 11-point WHO-CPS score from baseline by Day 14 was 
significantly greater in the anakinra+SoC group compared to placebo+SoC group (adjusted 
OR: 0.63; 95% CI: 0.46 to 0.86; p=0.003). 
The change from baseline in the absolute SOFA score by Day 14 was not statistically 
significant for the comparison between the anakinra+SoC and placebo+SoC groups (adjusted 
OR: 0.67; 95% CI: 0.39 to 1.15; p=0.150).  
The decrease of the absolute SOFA score from baseline by Day 7 was significantly greater in 
the anakinra+SoC group compared to placebo+SoC group (adjusted OR: 0.64; 95% CI: 0.47 
to 0.88; p=0.007).  
•  By Day 90, anakinra reduced the time to hospital discharge (i.e., 1 day shorter in patients 
treated with anakinra+SoC compared to placebo+SoC) (adjusted HR: 1.26; 95% CI: 0.05 to 
1.52; p=0.013; SAVE MORE CSR, Table 11-25). Anakinra also reduced the time to discharge 
from the ICU by Day 90 (i.e., 7.5 days shorter in patients treated with anakinra+SoC 
compared to placebo+SoC) (unadjusted HR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.08 to 4.93; p=0.031; SAVE-
MORE CSR, Figure 11-16). Outcomes related to the effect of anakinra treatment on 
biomarkers were previously reported in the iCSR; see SAVE-MORE CSR, Section 11.1.2.7 for

CHMP comments 
Analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints up to Day 28 were previously reported in the iCSR. The 
results are in favour of anakinra+SoC treatment. In the final CSR, a table with also adjusted OR’s have 
been included (Table 11-15). 
The decrease of the WHO-CPS score from baseline to Days 14 and 28 were significantly greater in the 
anakinra+SoC  arm  compared  to  the  placebo+SoC  arm,  and  the  absolute  and  relative  changes  of  the 
WHO-CPS at day 14 from baseline Day1, results are also in favour of anakinra.  The absolute and relative 
changes of the SOFA score at day 7 from baseline Day1 were greater in the anakinra arm as compared 
to the SoC arm, but not significant by day 14. 
Analysis of time to hospital discharge by Day 90 was included in the final CSR showing that Anakinra 
reduced  the  time  to  discharge  from  the  ICU  by  Day  90  (7.5  days  shorter  in  patients  treated  with 
anakinra+SoC compared to placebo+SoC) (unadjusted HR: 2.31; 95% CI: 1.08 to 4.93; p=0.031) 
Outcomes  related  to  the  effect  of  anakinra  treatment  on  biomarkers  were  previously  reported  in  the 
iCSR. 
8.4.  Other efficacy endpoints up to Day 90 
The ordinal regression analysis showed that anakinra treatment reduced the odds for higher scores on 
the 11-point WHO-CPS at Days 60 and 90 from baseline Day 1 compared to placebo (Day 60 adjusted 
OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.58, p<0.0001; Day 90 adjusted OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34 to 0.74, 
p=0.001) (SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 11-42 and Table 11-44, respectively). Subgroup analyses including 
CCI ≥2 vs <2, suPAR >9 ng/mL vs ≤9 ng/mL, sex, age ≥65 years vs <65 years, baseline remdesivir 
use, dexamethasone use, baseline disease severity and the need for oxygen, and BMI category were 
performed on the primary endpoint. These analyses demonstrated that patients benefited from 
anakinra treatment regardless of subgroup category.

CHMP comments 
In the final CSR data on absolute changes of the WHO-CPS scores by day 60 and day 90 from baseline 
Day 1 were submitted. An ordinal regression analysis showed that anakinra treatment was favourable 
in reducing the odds for higher scores on the 11-point WHO-CPS at Days 60 and 90 from baseline Day 
1 (Day 60 adjusted OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.58, p<0.0001; Day 90 adjusted OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 
0.34 to 0.74, p=0.001). 
8.5.  Discussion 
CHMP discussion 
The  MAH  has  submitted  the  final  CSR  for  the  SAVE-MORE  study  (dated  07.02.22)  fulfilling  the  post-
authorisation measure according to procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0086 for extension of indication 
of Kineret. The database lock for SAVE-MORE occurred on August 18, 2021 (last patient last visit 28th 
June 2021) and is based on data collected until Day 90 (11-point WHO-CPS data, AE/SAE and study drug 
administration) for all patients. Efficacy (primary and secondary endpoints) were previously reported in 
the iCSR; the only updates to efficacy in the table below were time until discharge from the hospital and 
ICU by Day 90.  
In  the  SAVE-MORE  study  the  efficacy  of  Kineret  had  a  beneficial  effect  in  patients  with  COVID-19 
pneumonia. The SAVE-MORE study met its primary endpoint and showed a reduction in the WHO-CPS 
score in patients treated with anakinra+SoC as compared to patients receiving SoC at Day 28. An effect 
was already present at Day 14.  
A favourable effect of Kineret was also found in the secondary endpoints, however, as no hierarchy was 
predefined  the  results  are  not  tested  for  multiplicity  and  effect  estimated  should  be  interpreted  with 
caution. More patients fully recovered by Day 28 in the anakinra arm 50.5% vs 26.5 % in the placebo 
arm and the proportion of patients with severe outcome (WHO-CP score ≥ 6) was higher in the placebo 
arm than in the anakinra arm. 
Analyses of the secondary efficacy endpoints up to Day 28 were previously reported in the iCSR. The 
results are in favour of anakinra+SoC treatment. In the final CSR, a table with also adjusted OR’s have

been included (Table 11-15). 
The decrease of the WHO-CPS score from baseline to Days 14 and 28 were significantly greater in the 
anakinra+SoC  arm  compared  to  the  placebo+SoC  arm,  and  the  absolute  and  relative  changes  of  the 
WHO-CPS at day 14 from baseline Day1, results are also in favour of anakinra.  The absolute and relative 
changes of the SOFA score at day 7 from baseline Day1 were greater in the anakinra arm as compared 
to the SoC arm, but not significant by day 14. 
In the final CSR Subgroup analyses including CCI ≥2 vs <2, suPAR >9 ng/mL vs ≤9 ng/mL, sex, age 
≥65 years vs <65 years, baseline remdesivir use, dexamethasone use, baseline  disease severity and 
the need for oxygen, and BMI category were updated performed on the primary endpoint. Regardless of 
subgroup category anakinra treatment was beneficial. 
In the final CSR data on absolute changes of the WHO-CPS scores by day 60 and day 90 from baseline 
Day 1 were submitted. An ordinal regression analysis showed that anakinra treatment was favourable in 
reducing the odds for higher scores on the 11-point WHO-CPS at Days 60 and 90 from baseline Day 1 
(Day 60 adjusted OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28 to 0.58, p<0.0001; Day 90 adjusted OR: 0.50, 95% CI: 0.34 
to 0.74, p=0.001). 
Overall  the  SAVE-MORE  pivotal  study  still  supports  the  clinical  benefit  of  anakinra  in  adult  COVID-19 
patients with pneumonia who are at risk of developing severe respiratory failure based on suPAR ≥ 6 
ng/ml. This includes a beneficial effect on time to progression to severe respiratory failure, on time until 
hospital discharge and on mortality, as compared to SoC treatment in the studied population.  
9.  Clinical Safety aspects 
Safety data up to Day 90 are summarized below and provided in the final CSR (SAVE-MORE CSR, 
Section 12). There were no new safety signals identified in the long-term safety data. 
9.1.  Analysis of adverse events 
Overall, the incidence of TEAEs through Day 90 was similar in patients in the anakinra+SoC group (343 
patients,  84.7%)  compared  to  the  patients  in  the  placebo+SoC  group  (161  patients,  85.2%)  (SAVE-
MORE CSR, Table 12-1).  
The TEAEs occurring more frequently in the anakinra+SoC group compared to the placebo+SoC group 
were transaminases increased, hypothermia, hypernatraemia, and gamma-glutamyltransferase 
increased (SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 12-2). TEAEs reported in the majority of patients were suggestive 
Assessment report

of advanced COVID-19 and its complications along with the worsening of patient’s concurrent clinical 
conditions. The majority of TEAEs were considered mild (Grade 1) or moderate (Grade 2) in severity 
(SAVE-MORE CSR, Section 12.1.3). Overall, the Grade 3 severity TEAEs were very few and balanced 
between the 2 treatment groups.  
The incidence of serious TEAEs through Day 90 was lower in patients in the anakinra+SoC group 
(16.3%) compared to the placebo+SoC group (21.7%) (SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 12-6). The most 
commonly reported serious TEAEs in both treatment groups were pneumonia, nosocomial infections, 
Assessment report  
EMA/609606/2022  
Page 22/30 
 
 
 
 
 
bacteremia, and septic shock.  
A total of 35 (5.9%) patients in the study had an SAE with an outcome of death up to 90 days; 17 
(9.0%) patients received placebo+SoC and 18 (4.4%) patients received anakinra+SoC (SAVE-MORE 
CSR, Table 12-5). Deaths were mostly attributed to the SOC Infections and infestations, either 
Pneumonia (COVID-19 or bacterial superinfection), Bacteremia, or Septic shock. The spectrum of fatal 
events was similar between anakinra and placebo treated patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/609606/2022  
Page 23/30 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 5 patients discontinued the treatment due to TEAEs (leukopenia and derangement of LFTs), 2 
(1%) patients from the placebo+SoC group and 3 (0.7%) patients from the anakinra+SoC treatment 
group (SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 12-8). TEAEs reported in the majority of patients were suggestive of 
advanced COVID-19 and its complications along with the worsening of patient’s concurrent clinical 
conditions. No new safety signals were observed in anakinra-treated patients. The TEAEs observed in 
patients with COVID-19 are consistent with the known safety profile of anakinra in other indications, 
especially considering the short treatment course of 10 days.

CHMP comments 
Safety data up to day 90 was reported and assessed in responses to 3rd RSI. The FAS/Safety Analysis 
Set  included  594  patients,  of  these,  189  patients  in  the  placebo+SoC  group  and  405  patients  in  the 
anakinra+SoC group were included in  
The  incidence  of  TEAEs  through  Day  90  reported  in  the  final  CSR  was  similar  in  patients  in  the 
anakinra+SoC group (343 patients, 84.7%) compared to the patients in the placebo+SoC group (161 
patients, 85.2%) (Table 12-1). This is a little higher than reported in responses to the 3rd RSI where 156 
(82.5 %) patients treated with placebo + SoC and 335 (82.7 %) patients treated with anakinra + SoC 
experienced at least 1 TEAE.   
In  the  final  CSR  the  TEAEs  occurring  more  frequently  in  the  anakinra+SoC  group  compared  to  the 
placebo+SoC group were transaminases increased, hypothermia, hypernatraemia, and gamma-glutamyl 
transferase increased (SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 12-2).  
The incidence of serious TEAEs through Day 90 was lower in patients in the anakinra+SoC group (16.3%) 
compared to the placebo+SoC group (21.7%) (Table 12-6). The most commonly reported serious TEAEs 
in both treatment groups were pneumonia, nosocomial infections, bacteremia, and septic shock. This is 
in alignment with earlier reported where 42 patients (22.2 %) treated with placebo + SoC and 66 patients 
(16.3 %) treated with anakinra + SoC experienced at least 1 serious TEAE. There is one patient less in 
the placebo+SoC group in the data submitted in the final CSR. 
In the final CSR a total of 35 patients (5.9 %) in the study had an SAE with an outcome of death up to 
90 days; 17 patients (9.0 %) received placebo + SoC and 18 patients (4.4 %) received anakinra + SoC 
as  reported  earlier.  In  total,  5  patients  discontinued  the  treatment  due  to  TEAEs  (leukopenia  and 
derangement of LFTs), 2 (1%) patients from the placebo+SoC group and 3 (0.7%) patients from the 
anakinra+SoC treatment group as reported earlier. 
9.2.  Adverse drug reactions 
No new safety signals or safety concerns were observed for anakinra for the treatment of COVID-19. 
Following the 10-day dosing regimen of anakinra, the frequency and severity of the subset of ADRs 
observed, which included neutropenia, elevated hepatic enzymes, rash, and injection site reactions, 
were consistent with the known safety profile of anakinra in the licensed indications.

9.3.  Clinical laboratory evaluations 
In the SAVE-MORE study, laboratory measurements were collected during in-patient hospitalization 
and were not collected during the long-term safety portion of the study. Therefore, all data were 
previously reported in the iCSR. There were no clinically meaningful changes in clinical laboratory 
results related to anakinra treatment. Any concerns were attributed to the underlying COVID-19 or 
other comorbidities.

No new data were provided 
9.4.  Discussion 
CHMP comments 
The MAH has submitted the final CSR for the SAVE-MORE study (dated 07.02.22) fulfilling the post-
authorisation measure according to procedure No. EMEA/H/C/000363/II/0086 for extension of 
indication of Kineret. Safety data have been updated to include long-term results from the SAVE-MORE 
study up to Day 90. The database lock for SAVE-MORE occurred on August 18, 2021 (last patient last 
visit 28th June 2021) and is based on data collected until Day 90 (11-point WHO-CPS data, AE/SAE 
and study drug administration) for all patients. Day 90 data has been reported and assessed in the 
CHMP AR for procedure II/0086. 
Safety data submitted in the final CSR are overall in alignment with safety data up to Day 90 that was 
earlier submitted and assessed in CHMP AR for procedure II/0086.  
The safety profile remains favourable with no new safety signals identified apart from the TEAE 
hypothermia occurring more frequently in the anakinra+SoC group compared to the placebo+SoC 
group (7.4% vs. 4.2%) not reported earlier in the treatment of hospitalised adult patients with COVID-
19 (OC).  The frequency and severity of the subset of ADRs observed (neutropenia, elevated hepatic 
enzymes, rash, and injection site reactions), following the 10-day dosing regimen of anakinra, were 
consistent with the known safety profile of anakinra in the licensed indications. Overall the safety 
profile of Kineret for treatment of adult COVID-19 patients with pneumonia who are at risk of 
developing severe respiratory failure is positive with no major concerns. The overall occurrence of AEs, 
SAEs including infections discontinuations and deaths were fewer for Kineret treated patients 
compared to placebo in the pivotal SAVE-MORE study. The safety data are overall consistent with the 
known safety profile of Kineret for the approved indications, including infections, however, TEAEs 
occurring at a higher proportion for Kineret included the increase of liver aminotransferases, 
hypoglycaemia, hypothermia, electrolyte abnormalities (hypernatraemia, hyperkalaemia), constipation, 
nausea/vomiting, anxiety, rash, neutropenia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia. Of these, the increase 
of liver function tests (hepatic enzyme increased), rash at the injection site (injection site reaction), 
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia are already listed ADRs for Kineret, hypernatremia, constipation, 
hyperkalemia, and anxiety are not. Numbers were however small and it is acknowledged that some of 
the numerical imbalances in the given TEAEs can indeed reflect different manifestations of underlying 
disease.

Question 1 
In the final CSR the number of patients that received dexamethasone during treatment has been 
revised. Revisions have been made to the clinical overview and summary of clinical efficacy. The 
percentage of patients receiving dexamethasone has been amended from 86,4% to 85.9%. The 
dexamethasone percentage in the SmPC (section 5.1) is also proposed to be revised in line with the 
final clinical study report. It is somewhat unclear whether the 0.5% difference is driven by 2 patients 
(0.5%) allocated to treatment with anakinra were by mistake entered in the database on the time of 
stratification as in need for dexamethasone intake. These patients in reality did not start 
dexamethasone. These patients were analysed as not under dexamethasone treatment. The applicant 
is invited to clarify this. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH acknowledges this observation and that is the reason why MAH has submitted an amended 
SmPC with the right values, i.e., 85.9%. There was a miscalculation in the original report for the group 
“Dexamethasone over follow-up due to progression” and the corrected total is 24 patients and not 
26 (8+16=24, not 26). Table 1 below is an extract from the interim table 14.1.1 “Baseline 
characteristics of enrolled patients” showing the mistake. 
In the final report, table 14.1.1, the correction for the above patient numbers and the baseline 
subgroups of dexamethasone corresponding to receiving within Day 1 was applied, see Table 2 below. 
Accordingly, the groups “Dexamethasone at enrollment” and “Dexamethasone over follow-up due 
to progression” were merged and the total was corrected to be 510 (486+24; not: 486+26 as 
previously reported), which is 85.9%. The rationale to merge these 2 groups was because all these 
510 patients were receiving dexamethasone on Day 1, no patients started dexamethasone after Day 1, 
thus the terminology originally chosen was not appropriate. 
The MAH would like to provide more information regarding the difference between the dexamethasone 
subgroup including all 510 patients and the 486 patients included in the dexamethasone strata. All 
analysis of the dexamethasone subgroup included all 510 patients. However, only 486 had received it 
before the point of randomisation, therefore only those 486 are included in the dexamethasone strata, 
as it was a stratification factor. Those patients who started dexamethasone on the same day as 
treatment (but soon after treatment), i.e., the N=24, are not in the dexamethasone strata. All the 
analyses were adjusted for dexamethasone using the strata numbers. 
The 2-patient difference in this revision is not related to those who were allocated to treatment with 
anakinra and entered in the database at the time of stratification as in need for dexamethasone by 
mistake. These 2 patients were always correctly reported and analysed as non-dexamethasone.

Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has provided an explanation for the The percentage of patients receiving dexamethasone has 
been amended from 86,4% to 85.9%. It was a miscalculation for 2 patients in the original report. The 
2-patient difference in this revision is not related to those who were allocated to treatment with 
anakinra and entered in the database at the time of stratification as in need for dexamethasone by 
mistake. These 2 patients were always correctly reported and analysed as non-dexamethasone. The 
table with baseline characteristics has been revised accordingly. 
In addition, the MAH has revised section 5.1 in the SmPC to include the correct number 85.9%. The 
MAH has moved the sentence to a more appropriate place in the section on Clinical efficacy and safety 
in COVID-19. This is acceptable. 
Conclusion Issue resolved 
Question 2 
In the fifth sensitivity analysis, numbers given in table 11-14 are in alignment with the numbers given

0.54 as is listed in Table 11-14 of the final CSR. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
The MAH has confirmed that the correct p-value is 0.54. 
Conclusion Issue resolved 
Question 3 
In the final CSR the TEAEs occurring more frequently in the anakinra+SoC group compared to the 
placebo+SoC group were transaminases increased, hypothermia, hypernatraemia, and gamma-
glutamyl transferase increased (SAVE-MORE CSR, Table 12-2). In responses to the 3rd RSI 
hypothermia (7.4% in the anakinra + SoC group vs. 4.2% in the placebo + Soc group) was not 
mentioned as a TEAE. The applicant is invited to discuss how hypothermia is defined and why 
hypothermia was not included in responses earlier. 
Summary of the MAH’s response 
The MAH acknowledges this observation and is confirming that these events were included in the 
listings in the interim CSR but were omitted by mistake in the interim version of the TEAEs table and in 
the responses to the 3rd RSI. This was corrected and they were added in the final TEAEs table (7.4% 
in the anakinra + SoC group vs. 4.2% in the placebo + SoC group). 
Hypothermia was determined by the reporting investigators. The definition of hypothermia was not the 
reason for the omission in the interim version of the TEAEs table. 
All hypothermia events were assessed as non-serious and not related by the investigators. 
Assessment of the MAH’s response 
Hypothermia was determined by the reporting investigators. The MAH has amended the final TEAEs 
table with hypothermia. All events were non-serious and assessed by the investigator as not related

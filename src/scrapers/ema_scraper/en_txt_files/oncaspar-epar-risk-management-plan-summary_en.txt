Part VI: Summary of the Risk Management Plan 
Summary of risk management plan for ONCASPAR (pegaspargase) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  ONCASPAR.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of ONCASPAR, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information will 
be obtained about ONCASPAR's risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
ONCASPAR's summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how ONCASPAR should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for ONCASPAR should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is part 
of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
ONCASPAR's RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
ONCASPAR is authorised for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (see SmPC for the full indication). 
It contains Pegaspargase as the active substance and it is given by an injection of infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of ONCASPAR’s benefits can be found in ONCASPAR’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website. 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further characterise the
risks
Important risks of ONCASPAR, together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about ONCASPAR's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific  information,  such  as  warnings,  precautions,  and  advice  on  correct  use,  in  the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
•
• The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that
the medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with or
without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analysed through signal detection, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action 
can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of ONCASPAR is not yet available, it is listed 
under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of ONCASPAR are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. Important 
risks  can  be  regarded  as  identified  or  potential.  Identified  risks  are  concerns  for  which  there  is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of ONCASPAR. Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association 
has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information 
on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (e.g. on 
the long-term use of the medicine).

II.B Summary of important risks
Table 34. Important Identified Risk– Hypersensitivity (including Severe Hypersensitivity
and Anaphylactic shock) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Hypersensitivity has been reported in clinical trials and scientific and medical 
literature. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
The likelihood of occurrence of allergic reactions increases with the number of 
doses administered. However, rarely, allergic reactions may occur even with the 
first injection of pegaspargase. 
Patients with the previous experience of allergic reaction to L-asparaginase or 
to ONCASPAR are at increased risk of repeated allergic reaction. 
Risk factors for the drug-induced hypersensitivity reactions may be drug-related 
(e.g.,  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs  [NSAIDs]  or  antibiotics  are 
notorious for their immunogenicity), treatment regimen-related (intermittent and 
repeated administrations can be more sensitising than an uninterrupted treatment; 
parenteral route is considered the most immunogenic), host-related (most studies 
show that women are more often affected than men, ratio 2:1; it is often reported 
that children are less affected than adults; however, other studies present similar 
incidences  in  paediatric  and  adults  populations),  or  underlying  disease-related 
(e.g., asthmatics have higher probability of reaction to certain drug groups). [23]

Table 39. Important Identified Risk – Hyperammonaemia 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Hyperammonaemia  has  been  reported  in  clinical  trials,  the  post-marketing 
setting and in scientific literature. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Patients  who  are  older  or  have  hepatic  impairment  may  be  at  greater  risk  of 
developing symptomatic hyperammonaemia. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC  Section  4.4  –  Intravenous  administration  may  cause  serum  levels  of 
ammonia  to  sharply  rise  after  administration.  If  there  are  symptoms  of 
hyperammonaemia, ammonia levels should be monitored closely. 
SmPC Section 4.8 
PL Section 4 – Patients should notify their doctor immediately if they have any 
symptoms of hyperammonaemia 
Additional risk minimisation measures:

Table 40. Important Identified Risk – Embryotoxicity and Teratogenicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity have been reported in scientific and medical 
literature. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Pre-clinical results suggest that exposure during 1st trimester poses the highest 
risk for the foetus. 
Table 40. Important Identified Risk – Embryotoxicity and Teratogenicity 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.6 – ONCASPAR should not be used during pregnancy unless 
clinically required. Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment of 
ONCASPAR. 
SmPC Section 5.3 
PL  Section  2  –  If  patients  are  pregnant  or  breast-feeding,  think  they  may  be 
pregnant, or are planning to have a baby, they should ask their doctor for advice. 
Contraception  (other 
than  oral  contraceptives)  should  be  used  during 
ONCASPAR treatment and for 6 months after discontinuation. Breast-feeding 
should be discontinued during treatment with ONCASPAR. 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
No additional risk minimisation activities. 
Table 41. Important Potential Risk – Immunogenicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
A potential for immunogenicity, defined as development of binding and/or 
neutralising antibodies to the product is associated with all therapeutic proteins. 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Risk minimisation measures 
Prior exposure to native E. coli asparaginase increases the development of anti-
PEG-asparaginase antibodies. It  was reported that > 65% of patients  who had 
developed anti-asparaginase antibodies to native E. coli  asparaginase also had 
antibodies to PEG-asparaginase. However, almost 40% of  these patients  were 
PEG-asparaginase naive, suggesting that the IgG antibodies may crossreact. [54] 
Tong et al. found a  high incidence of inactivation of PEG-asparaginase (22% 
clinical allergy and 8% silent inactivation) in the intensification phase because 
of antibody development against native E coli asparaginase, which was used in 
induction. [55]  
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
SmPC Section 4.4 – Low asparaginase activity levels may be due to potential 
neutralising anti-asparaginase antibodies. In such cases, a switch to a different 
asparaginase preparation should be considered. 
SmPC Section 4.8 
SmPC Section 5.3 
Additional risk minimisation measures: 
No additional risk minimisation activities.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Genzyme Europe BV submitted on 11 September 2020 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Nexviadyme, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 . The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 14 November 2019. 
Nexviadyme, was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/14/1251 on 26 March 2014 in 
the following condition: Treatment of glycogen storage disease type II (Pompe's disease). 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Nexviadyme (avalglucosidase alfa) is indicated 
for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease (acid 
α-glucosidase deficiency). 
1.2.  Legal basis, dossier content  
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
1.3.  Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0174/2020 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0174/2020 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
1.4.  Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
1.4.1.  Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) 
No 847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for 
a condition related to the proposed indication.

1.5.  Applicant’s request(s) for consideration 
1.5.1.  Accelerated assessment 
The applicant requested accelerated assessment in accordance to Article 14 (9) of Regulation (EC) 
No 726/2004. 
1.5.2.  New active Substance status 
At the time of the initial submission, the applicant requested the active substance,  avalglucosidase 
alfa contained in Nexviadyme to be considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims 
that it is not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union.  
During the procedure, following the CHMP request, the applicant submitted data to support a claim 
for the active substance avalglucosidase alfa contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance in comparison to alglucosidase alfa previously authorised in 
the European Union as Myozyme, as the applicant claimed that avalglucosidase alfa differs 
significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from the already authorised active 
substance.  
1.6.  Protocol assistance 
The applicant received the following Protocol assistance on the development relevant for the 
indication subject to the present application:

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The applicant applied for the following indication:  long-term enzyme replacement therapy for the 
treatment of patients with Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase deficiency).  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Pompe disease (also known as acid maltase deficiency or glycogen storage disease [GSD] type II) is 
a  rare,  autosomal  recessive  genetic  disease  caused  by  the  deficiency  of  lysosomal  acid 
alfaglucosidase (GAA), an enzyme that degrades glycogen. The resulting accumulation of glycogen 
in  body  tissues,  especially  cardiac  and  skeletal  muscles,  disrupts  the  architecture  and  function  of 
affected cells leading to a variety of symptoms, clinical decline, and ultimately, death. In addition to 
being  a  lysosomal  storage  disorder,  Pompe  disease  is  also  a  neuromuscular  disease,  a  metabolic 
myopathy, and a glycogen storage disorder.  
The estimated global incidence of Pompe disease is 1:40,000, with variations in incidence reported 
between different ethnic groups (Martiniuk, 1998, Am J Med Genet; Ausems, 1999, Eur J Hum Genet; 
Poorthuis,  1999,  Hum  Genet;  Hirschhorn,  2001,  The  Metabolic  and  Molecular  Bases  of  Inherited 
Disease).  All  presentations  of  Pompe  disease  are  caused  by  the  same  underlying  deficiency  of 
lysosomal  GAA.  However,  there  is  significant  heterogeneity  in  the  clinical  presentation  of  Pompe 
disease, and the disease manifests as a broad clinical spectrum with a continuum of clinical signs 
and symptoms (Chen, 2000, Mol Med Today; Hirschhorn, 2001, The Metabolic and Molecular Bases 
of Inherited Disease; van den Hout, 2003, Pediatrics; Kishnani, 2004, J Pediatr).  
Pompe disease has been classified into different phenotypes based on age at onset of symptoms, 
extent  of  organ  involvement,  and  rate  of  progression  to  death.  These  phenotypes  range  from  a 
rapidly progressive infantile-onset form of the disease to a more slowly progressing late-onset form 
with symptom onset any time after infancy through adulthood; there is considerable variability and 
overlap between these two extremes.  
The majority of patients with Pompe disease are classified with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Defects  in  both  alleles  of  the  gene  for  GAA,  located  on  chromosome  17q25,  result  in  reduced  or 
absent  enzyme  activity.  The  deficiency  in  lysosomal  GAA  in  Pompe  disease  results  in  the 
accumulation of glycogen to a variable extent in all muscles of patients with the disorder, leading to 
impaired contractile function. It is hypothesized that rupture of enlarged lysosomes leads to spill-
over  of  lysosomal  enzymes  into  the  muscle  cell  cytoplasm,  leading  to  eventual  destruction  of  the 
muscle  cell  with  fibrosis  and  fatty  replacement  as  a  consequence  and  progressive  dysfunction  of 
portions of muscle or even entire muscles. Imaging techniques such as total body MRI (magnetic 
resonance imaging) have shown that even Pompe disease patients who do not appear to have clinical 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 17/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
evidence of skeletal muscle involvement may have evidence of fatty replacement of parts of their 
muscles on MRI. T2 imaging can reveal large amounts of fatty infiltration with or without (+/-) fibrosis 
on  MRI  of  their  lower  limbs,  yet  patients  appear  to  be  walking  quite  normally  due  to  adaptive 
compensatory mechanisms. 
Currently, over 500 mutations of GAA, including missense, nonsense, splicing defect, and frameshift 
mutations, have been found. According to the variety of mutations, clinical presentation of Pompe 
disease is heterogeneous in timing, severity, and ranges of symptoms observed.  
Infantile-onset Pompe disease, which represents up to one third of the cases, presents in the first 
months of life and is characterized by virtually complete absence of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)-
activity (GAA activity is less than 1%). Although GAA activity is <1% in all IOPD patients, two groups 
have to be differentiated. Patients may synthesize a non-functional form of GAA or are completely 
unable  to  form  any  kind  of  native  enzyme.  The  former  patients  are  designated  as  cross-reactive 
immunological material (CRIM)-positive, whereas the latter are classified as CRIM-negative. 
The  majority  of  Pompe  patients  become  manifest  after  infancy  with  late-onset  Pompe  disease 
(LOPD), which shows a more variable course as compared with IOPD (Byrne et al., 2011; van der 
Ploeg et al., 2008). Longer disease duration of between 10-15 years, as well as FVC ≤80% predicted, 
are risk factors for more rapidly progressive disease (van der Beek, 2012, Orphanet J Rare Dis) and 
more than half of LOPD patients will eventually require ventilation after 10-15 years of symptomatic 
disease progression.  The main cause of death in this group of patients is respiratory failure, a process 
in  which  dysfunction of  the  diaphragm  is  considered  to  play  an  important  role  (Wens,  2015,  BMC 
Pulm Med). Patients who are symptomatic during childhood have a more rapidly progressive form of 
the  disease  and  will  often  require  ventilation  at  a  younger  age  (van  der  Beek,  2011,  Mol  Genet 
Metab). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Pompe  disease  is  caused  by  biallelic  mutations  of  the  acid  α-glucosidase  (GAA)  gene  located  on 
chromosome 17q25, that result in deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme GAA. 
Severity of disease depends on the amount of residual enzyme GAA activity.  
In  classic  infantile-onset  Pompe  disease  (IOPD),  GAA  activity  less  than  1%causes  marked 
accumulation of glycogen not only in skeletal muscle, but also in heart and other tissues contrary to 
milder  forms  with  later  onset  (LOPD).  Affected  patients  present  with  creatinine  kinase  elevation, 
hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy  (HCM),  failure  to  thrive,  muscular  hypotonia  and  axial  muscle 
weakness during the first six months of life. IOPD is rapidly progressive, and the majority of untreated 
subjects die within the first year of life due to a combination of ventilatory and cardiac failure without 
achieving any motor milestones such as turning, sitting, or standing. Survival beyond the age of 18 
months is exceptional. Classic IOPD should be distinguished from non-classic or late-infantile Pompe 
disease that also manifests during infancy but has no or much less severe cardiac hypertrophy (Hahn 
et al., 2019). 
Although GAA activity is  <1% in all IOPD patients, two groups have to be differentiated. Patients 
may synthesize a non-functional form of GAA or are completely unable to form any kind of native 
enzyme.  The  former  patients  are  designated  as  cross-reactive  immunological  material  (CRIM)-
positive, whereas the latter are classified as CRIM-negative. In the years since approval of ERT, it

Assessment report

has also become clear that IOPD is a multisystemic disorder, and that individuals receiving this kind 
of treatment develop clinical symptoms not known in the pre-ERT era. Features of this new IOPD 
phenotype  include  cardiac,  speech,  hearing,  musculoskeletal,  respiratory,  swallowing,  and 
neurocognitive symptoms. 
Initial  symptoms  of  LOPD  typically  include  muscle  weakness  with  a  limb-girdle  distribution,  which 
often manifests as difficulties in climbing stairs, walking, running, and rising from a chair or lying 
position. Shortness of breath and respiratory dysfunction due to involvement of respiratory muscles, 
fatigue, exercise intolerance, and muscle pain are also common and may present at any time in the 
illness (Müller-Felber et al., 2007; Schüller et al., 2012; van der Beek et al., 2009, 2012; Wokke et 
al., 2008). Over time, progressive loss of muscle strength reduces mobility and interferes with the 
ability to independently complete activities of daily living, including toileting and dressing, resulting 
in decreased quality of life (Hagemans et al., 2004, 2005; Müller-Felber et al., 2007). Many LOPD 
patients  ultimately  end  up  confined  to  a  wheelchair  and  require  ventilation,  and  LOPD  is  also 
associated with increased mortality relative to the general population (Güngör et al., 2011). Although 
Pompe  disease  manifestations  vary  between  individuals,  studies  in  both  IOPD  and  LOPD  patients 
(Ausems et al., 1999) have confirmed that respiratory failure precedes death in nearly all subjects. 
The most common cause of death in patients with Pompe disease, regardless of age of disease onset 
and/or  the  severity  of  skeletal  muscle  weakness  is  respiratory  failure  (Hirschhorn  et  al.,  2001; 
Güngor et al., 2011; Winkel et al., 2005). 
2.1.5.  Management 
Currently the only treatment option for Pompe disease patients and standard-of-care is long-term 
enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with alglucosidase alfa, globally approved for the treatment of 
all subsets of Pompe disease under the tradenames of Myozyme and Lumizyme. Enzyme replacement 
therapy  (ERT)  substitutes  a  deficient  enzyme  by  intravenous  infusion  of  the  recombinant  human 
enzyme  at  regular  intervals.  The  enzyme  is  taken  up  into  the  cells  via  the  mannose-6-phosphate 
receptor and transported to the lysosome.  
Approval of alglucosidase alfa was based on early clinical trials demonstrating its ability to reduce 
cardiac  hypertrophy  and  prolong  invasive  ventilator-free  survival  in  infants  with  IOPD  (Trials 
ALGLU01602 and ALGLU01702) and to stabilize respiratory function and improve walking distance in 
children and adults with LOPD (ALGLU02704). 
Development  and  approval  of  ERT  has  profoundly  changed  the  natural  course  of  the  disease, 
revealing  new  phenotypes  in  patients  with  classical IOPD  who  survive  with  ERT,  and  considerably 
extending productivity and quality of life for patients with LOPD. However, it is recognized that the 
progressive decline in muscle function in patients with Pompe disease is not completely abrogated 
with alglucosidase alfa ERT. 
Studies in LOPD patients suggest that some patients on alglucosidase alfa continue to exhibit some 
decline  in  respiratory  function,  albeit  at  a  slower  pace  than  prior  to  treatment.  Responses  to 
treatment in LOPD patients vary between individuals and there might be room for improvement.  
With respect to IOPD patients, literature data (Chien et al, 2015) indicate that some patients treated 
with  Myozyme  exhibit  declines  in  motor  function  and  mobility  starting  at  18-24  months  of  age, 
despite an initial decrease in CK levels. An effect that is likely due to reduced uptake of alglucosidase 
alfa in skeletal tissue compared to uptake in cardiac tissue. However, the reasons for the variable 
efficacy  of  ERT  and  the  progression  of  disease  with  time  are  manifold  and  only  imperfectly 
understood.  Known  factors  include  age  at  start  of  therapy  and  pre-treatment  muscle  pathology, 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report

CRIM-status and antibody titers, distribution of type I and II fibers, and altered autophagy ( Kishnani 
et al., 2012). 
Implementation of ERT has uncovered multisystemic character of IOPD, not known in the pre-ERT 
era. Although ERT has substantially improved the prognosis of IOPD, mortality is still considerable, 
and decline of motor function with time is frequent in long-term survivors. Thus, further huge efforts 
are necessary to improve the outcome of children affected by this most severe form of Pompe disease 
indicating an unmet medical need in the IOPD patients deteriorating on Myozyme. 
2.2.  About the product 
The rationale for ERT in lysosomal storage disorders in general, and Pompe disease in particular, is 
that lysosomes are accessible to exogenous or extracellular proteins. The feasibility of using ERT in 
Pompe disease has been supported by studies in cultured skeletal muscle cells and fibroblasts, and 
in animal models of Pompe disease and efficacy was established in clinical trials with alglucosidase 
alfa. 
The cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CIM6Pr) plays an essential role in cellular 
binding,  uptake  and  lysosomal  targeting  of  exogenously  administered  alglucosidase  alfa  (Ghosh, 
2003, Nat Rev Mol Cell Biol). This is supported by preclinical studies demonstrating a decrease in 
alglucosidase alfa uptake and reduced glycogen clearance in a muscle specific CIM6Pr/GAA double 
knockout  mouse  (Bali,  2004,  ASHG).  Furthermore,  reports  from  the  literature  indicate  that  the 
CIM6Pr is present in relatively low levels in human skeletal muscle compared to that of cardiac tissue 
(Wenk,  1991,  Biochem  Internat)  and  that  bis-phosphorylated  glycans  have  a  significantly  higher 
affinity  for  the  CIM6Pr  as compared to  the  mono-phosphorylated  forms  (Tong,  1989,  J  Biochem). 
Therefore, greatly increasing the level of bis-M6P on alglucosidase alfa may provide a mechanism to 
drive uptake into the skeletal muscle. 
Avalglucosidase alfa (recombinant human α-glucosidase conjugated with synthetic bis-mannose-6-
phosphate-Man6  glycan)  is  a  second-generation  ERT  for  Pompe  disease  that has  been  specifically 
designed  for  enhanced  receptor  targeting  and  enzyme  uptake  with  the  aim  of  improving  clinical 
efficacy  and  patient  convenience.    Avalglucosidase  alfa  is  a  modification  of  alglucosidase  alfa 
(Myozyme and Lumizyme) that results in the conjugation of a number of hexamannose structures 
containing  two  terminal  synthetic  bis-mannose-6-phosphate-Man6  glycans  (M6P)  conjugated  to 
alglucosidase alfa through an aminoxy nitrogen to carbon double bond. Compared to alglucosidase 
alfa,  which  contains  only  a  single  M6P  molecule  for  each  alglucosidase  alfa  molecule,  each 
avalglucosidase alfa molecule contains approximately 13 to 18 M6P glycans.  
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development 
The CHMP did not agree to the applicant’s request for an accelerated assessment, as the product 
was not considered to be of major public health interest: Like alglucosidase alfa, avalglucosidase alfa 
is an enzyme replacement therapy. It does not exert a novel mechanism of action. Having additional 
therapeutic options for LOPD patients is valuable, but this is not considered sufficient to argue an 
unmet medical need and accelerated access. The subpopulation for whom an unmet need might exist 
(i.e.  IOPD  population  worsening  on  alglucosidase/Myozyme)  was  not  included  in  the  pivotal  trial. 
Moreover, formally, only non-inferiority against the established treatment has been demonstrated; 
superior efficacy was not shown.

2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The finished product (FP) is presented as a powder for concentrate for solution for infusion 
containing 100 mg of avalglucosidase alfa as active substance (AS). Other ingredients are: 
histidine, histidine hydrochloride monohydrate, glycine, mannitol, polysorbate 80. 
The product is available in type I glass vial with a stopper (elastomeric rubber), seal (aluminium) 
and a flip off cap (packs of 1, 5, 10 or 25 vials) as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC.  
2.4.2.  Active Substance 
2.4.2.1.  General information 
The active substance (AS), avalglucosidase alfa (INN) is a recombinant human α-glucosidase 
(alglucosidase alfa, rhGAA) conjugated with multiple copies of glycan E13, a synthetic bis-
mannose-6-phosphate-tetra-mannose glycan (bisM6P). The alglucosidase alfa is the secreted 110 
kDa form of the molecule, which lacks the signal peptide and contains 896 amino acids and seven 
asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. 
The bisM6P moieties are  conjugated to sialic acid residues on  alglucosidase alfa. As a result, 
approximately 7 hexamannose structures, each containing two terminal bis-M6P moieties, are 
conjugated to the oxidized sialic acid residues. Avalglucosidase alfa has on average a 15-fold 
increase in mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) moieties compared to alglucosidase alfa, which contains a 
single mole of M6P for each mole of enzyme. 
Binding to M6P receptors on the cell surface has been shown to occur via carbohydrate groups on 
the acid alpha-glucosidase molecule, after which it is internalised and transported into lysosomes, 
where it undergoes proteolytic cleavage that results in increased enzymatic activity to degrade 
glycogen.  
2.4.2.2.   Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacturing  and  testing  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  AS,  are  performed  by  Genzyme  Flanders  bvba, 
Cipalstraat  8,  2440  Geel,  Belgium.  Good  Manufacturing  Practice  (GMP)  compliance  has  been 
documented for all sites involved.  
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
Glycan E13 intermediate  
Glycan E13 intermediate is manufactured from starting materials applying a synthesis route using 
classical synthetic carbohydrate chemistry. The proposed starting material is acceptable. 
Reprocessing as declared is acceptable; no alternative commercial process is declared. The glycan 
E13 synthesis route remained the same throughout development (relevant changes are outlined in 
the dossier).

During the manufacturing process, Normal Operating Ranges (NORs) are applied. Proven acceptable 
ranges (PAR) were studied only to assess the criticality of the process parameters.  
Overall, the manufacturing process description is acceptable. In-Process Controls (IPCs) are clearly 
defined.  The  quantity  of  each  single  starting  material,  solvent,  reagent,  catalyst  employed  in  the 
synthesis is declared, as well as the operating temperatures. The typical yield of each step is reported 
in the dossier. The final yield of the manufacturing process is reported in the dossier, as well. The 
analytical methods used to monitor the IPCs have been described. 
Avalglucosidase alfa 
The  AS  manufacturing  process  consists  in  the  bioproduction  of  alglucosidase  alfa  by  a  Chinese 
hamster  ovary  (CHO)  cell  culture  in  perfusion  mode  followed  by  purification  steps.  The  purified 
enzyme  is  then  oxidized  and  conjugated  with  an  intermediate  glycan  E13,  which  is  obtained  by 
chemical synthesis. The conjugated enzyme, avalglucosidase alfa, is finally purified and formulated.  
The cell culture process consists of a series of expansion steps (starting from thawing of the WCB 
vial)  providing  sufficient  inoculum  for  the  production  bioreactor  in  which  alglucosidase  alfa  is 
produced  Harvest  may  be  pooled  and  further  processed.  All  the  information  concerning  the 
production of the recombinant enzyme alglucosidase alfa starting from the cell bank system (Master 
Cell Bank (MCB), WCB and End-Of-Production (EOP) cells) is included in the dossier and of sufficient 
quality  (the  construction  of  the  expression  vector,  the  cell  bank  system  and  the  cell  bank 
characterization/  monitoring  have  been  described  in  sufficient  detail).  Genetic  stability  has  been 
confirmed.  
Purification of alglucosidase alfa is performed using a series of chromatographic operations as well 
as  depth  and  membrane  filtration  techniques  starting  from  the  harvest  material  collected  in  the 
harvest pool/depth filtration feed tank.  
The sialic acids on the enzyme are oxidized with periodate before reacting with the reactive group 
(aminooxy)  on  the  purified  synthetic  M6P-glycan  to  obtain  the  oxime  conjugate  which  defines 
avalglucosidase alfa. This conjugation step leads to multiple copies of M6P bearing glycans. Additional 
purification,  filtration  and  formulation  steps  are  included  after  the  conjugation  to  deliver 
avalglucosidase alfa AS. 
Control of materials 
Sufficient information on raw materials used in the active substance manufacturing process has been 
submitted. Compendial raw materials are tested in accordance with the corresponding monograph, 
while Certificate of Analysis (CoAs) or specifications (including test methods) for non-compendial raw 
materials have been presented. CoAs for serum have been submitted.  
Extractable and Leachable risk assessment was performed taking into account concepts and 
principles of ICH Q9 including criticality of the material, place of use in production process, applied 
process parameters. Overall, no high-risk components or materials were identified. The results are 
deemed acceptable. 
As regards cell substrate and cell banking system, alglucosidase alfa is expressed in an 
independently derived CHO cell line. The vector map is provided. The expressing cells were cloned. 
The final clone was selected as it presented appropriate expression and genetic stability. From this 
clone, a  cell banking system was established for commercial production. The generation of the

MCB and the first three WCBs was appropriately described. The results of the tests performed on 
each of these banks were provided. An EOP Cell Bank was constituted in culture Genetic integrity of 
MCB, WCB and EOP cells was confirmed by southern blot, copy number analysis and DNA sequence 
analysis. A protocol has been presented for preparation and qualification of future working cell 
banks. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Analytical methods are in place to control impurities. Potential related substances in the 
intermediates have been discussed. The specification of intermediates includes limits for routine 
control of known, unknown and total impurities in-line with batch data.  
Specification of Glycan E13 intermediate initially proposed by the applicant included appearance, 
identification, quantification of related substances, quantification of residual solvents, quantification 
of elemental impurities, mutagenic impurity assessment and quantification of endotoxins. The 
glycan E13 specification have been updated with regards to the agreed glycan purity and total 
impurities acceptance criteria and aligned with batch data. 
An  overview  of  the  process  controls  (Critical  Control  Parameters  (CPPs)  and  IPCs)  within  the 
avalglucosidase alfa manufacturing process has been provided. IPCs may have acceptance criteria 
or action limits. The manufacturing steps considered critical and controlled by CPPs and IPCs, are the 
following:  harvest  phase  of  production  bioreactor,  followed  by  all  the  downstream  steps.  The 
proposed  avalglucosidase  alfa  control  strategy  (pre-oxidation  intermediate  in  addition  to 
avalglucosidase alfa AS/FP) in comparison to the current commercial alglucosidase alfa AS release 
acceptance  criteria  is  acceptable.  Section  3.2.S.2.4  has  been  updated  to  include  the  proposed 
specification (with acceptance criteria and action limits) and description of the analytical methods 
and  validation  summaries.  Maximum  Holding  times  of  process  intermediate  are  sufficiently 
illustrated.  
Process validation 
The process validation is divided into two major sections of WCB vial thaw to pre-oxidation and 
intermediate and pre-oxidation intermediate to avalglucosidase alfa AS. Due to the complexity and 
length of the process, Process Performance Qualification (PPQ) is performed in several separate 
studies for a single unit operation or a combination of process steps. Validation of the entire 
process is assured through the successful execution of all combined validation studies 
supplemented with process development and comparability data. 
The process from WCB vial thaw to pre-oxidation intermediate was validated in the year 2008. Since 
then, the process was modified several times, and these modifications were validated one by one. 
The  validated  state  was  maintained  with  continued  process  verification  (CPV)  to  ensure  the 
intermediate batches used for the process validation of pre-oxidation intermediate to AS are from 
the validated process. Overall, the validation data for the steps from WCB vial thaw to UF/DF-3 are 
considered sufficient and appropriate. 
The purification process from pre-oxidation intermediate through AS was validated on  PPQ 
batches, derived from  separate validated batches of glycan E13 and separate pre-oxidation 
intermediate batches. The results of successful consecutive PPQ runs provide evidence that the 
avalglucosidase alfa manufacturing process from the pre-oxidation intermediate to DS is 
consistent, reproducible and controlled to generate process intermediates and DS of intended 
Nexviadyme

quality. All evaluated parameters complied with their respective pre-defined validation acceptance 
criteria, action limits and monitoring ranges. 
Overall, the separate validation studies in combination with comparability data demonstrate that 
the manufacturing process for avalglucosidase alfa AS is reproducible, consistent and produces AS 
of intended quality. 
Intermediate  hold  studies  were  performed  to  evaluate  the  in-process  and/or  storage  conditions 
throughout  the  manufacturing  process,  including  both  microbial  control  and  chemical  hold.  Data 
supporting cleaning and storage conditions of the resins and membranes have been provided. The 
shipping  of  the  AS  at  temperature-controlled  conditions  was  validated  by  real  transport  of  three 
consecutive runs.  
Glycan E13 
Justified routine control of organic impurities has been included in the glycan E13 intermediate 
specifications. Results of three batches of the updated intermediate specifications Glycan E13 have 
been provided. All results comply with the proposed limits.  
Manufacturing process development 
Process development history and process characterisation studies: 
The initial small-scale manufacturing process for alglucosidase alfa (rhGAA) was developed on 30 
L/60 L bioreactor scale. Genzyme scaled up the initial 30 L/60 L perfusion process multiple times in 
preparation for commercial manufacture of alglucosidase alfa. The cell culture process was first 
increased to 160 L scale, then to 2000 L scale and subsequently to 4000 L scale. References to 
scale are based on the bioreactor working volume. Only the 4000 L scale is the manufacturing 
scale used for clinical and commercial manufacturing of avalglucosidase alfa. 
The manufacturing process development for the avalglucosidase alfa AS process from the oxidation 
step onwards has been operated at different scales and locations during clinical GMP production, 
with some modifications introduced at each scale. Briefly, changes were made in the upstream 
material, the process has been optimization, and a new salt form of the glycan introduced.  Process 
development and respective process changes were supported by process development studies 
including characterisation studies.  
Control strategy: 
The  Quality  Target  Product  Profile  (QTPP)  for  avalglucosidase  alfa  is  well  defined.  Critical  Quality 
Attributes (CQA) are acceptable. An overview of the CPPs, KPPs (Key Process Parameters), IPCs and 
KPAs  (Key  Process  Attributes)  for  commercial  manufacturing  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  is  given.  The 
rationale and the impact on product quality, is sufficiently elaborated. Overall, the control strategy 
is acceptable.  
Comparability: 
Comparability  studies  were  performed  for  each  process  change.  The  processes  were  found  to  be 
comparable with the respective previous process.   
The results demonstrated the biochemical comparability of avalglucosidase alfa through the 
development process including process transfer and scale-ups.

Characterisation 
Elucidation of structure and other characteristics: 
Summary  of  the  characterization  tests  (primary  structure  confirmation,  post-translational 
modifications, glycosylation, secondary and higher order structure and biological activity) performed 
on  the  PPQ  batches,  the  primary  standard  (PS)  and  historical  batches  are  provided.  Data  show 
comparability to the PS and also consistency over the development.  
Characterization analyses provided further information on:  
- the avalglucosidase alfa protein structure, e.g., peptide mapping, molecular weight determination 
non-reduced and reduced purity,   
-  secondary  and  tertiary  structure  by  circular  dichroism,  solution  structure  by  analytical 
ultracentrifugation; free thiol content, 
-  post-translational  modifications,  e.g.,  oxidation  deamidation  and  glycosylation  including 
oligosaccharide profiling, peptide map and monosaccharide composition,  
- and function, e.g., enzyme kinetic parameters, cellular uptake, and M6P receptor binding.  
The primary structure is consistent with the primary amino acid sequence encoded by the cDNA. 
The avalglucosidase alfa molecule contains 13 cysteine residues, 12 of which are involved in 
disulfide linkages. The disulfide bond configuration of avalglucosidase alfa was confirmed by 
peptide mapping the consistency of the secondary and higher order structure of avalglucosidase 
alfa was confirmed. The 7 asparagine-linked glycosylation sites in avalglucosidase alfa are 
asparagine residues 84, 177, 334, 414, 596, 826, and 869. These are the target conjugation sites 
for the synthetic glycan E13. The molecular weight of the protein after glycan conjugation was 
confirmed. 
All  the  modifications  which  could  lead  to  the  formation  of  charge  variants  (glycosylation, 
phosphorylation,  deamidation)  were  characterized  by  oligosaccharide  profiling,  site  specific 
glycosylation analysis and mannose-6-phosphate content. 
As regards the biological characterisation studies, the enzymatic activity of avalglucosidase as well 
as its ability to bind to the M6P receptor and be internalized by the cell is demonstrated. There is no 
impact of glycan conjugation on enzymatic activity.  
Overall, the active substance has been sufficiently characterized. 
Impurities: 
The actual and potential impurities of avalglucosidase alfa AS, which may arise from raw materials, 
manufacturing process, avalglucosidase alfa variants, and avalglucosidase alfa degradation, are 
separated into process-related and product-related impurities. The purification process for 
avalglucosidase alfa has been designed to produce highly purified avalglucosidase alfa and to 
remove potential impurities. On the whole, the proposed impurity control strategy is endorsed. 
Process related protein impurities have been quantified and confirmed to be decreased at each 
purification column step. For process related impurities related to E13 glycan synthesis, only

impurities specified at levels in E13 glycan above the applicable ICH safety limits are considered 
impurities which require control in the AS. 
Product related impurities of avalglucosidase alfa AS include processed forms of alglucosidase alfa 
which are sufficiently controlled at characterisation level or in the AS specification. 
The  quality  and  toxicological  information  relevant  for  the  evaluation  of  the  actual  and  potential 
mutagenic impurities, as well as the acceptable limit and the control strategy have been defined. 
On the whole, the proposed impurity control strategy is endorsed.  
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The specification for avalglucosidase AS include general tests for, identity, concentration, potency, 
purity, impurities, and safety tests.  
The specification limits are based on results of batches used in clinical trial and batches obtained 
with the final commercial process. Recommendations of NfGs on Production and quality control of 
medicinal products derived by recombinant DNA technology (3AB1a) and Specifications: Test 
procedures and acceptance criteria for biotechnological/biological products (CPMP/ICH/365/96) are 
followed.  
In general, the specification provided is acceptable.  
The potency of avalglucosidase alfa is attributed to the enzymatic activity of the molecule as well 
as its ability to bind to the M6P receptor and be internalized by the cell. 
Based on correlation data as well as a controlled manufacturing process, the proposed release 
assay panel versus the proposed characterization tests, relative to the critical quality attributes of 
the product, was justified. 
Deamidation and isoaspartic acid isomerization were both observed during forced degradation 
studies performed at elevated temperature (37°C) at low and high pH conditions. Since 
deamidation levels for all Processes batches have been very low at the AS storage conditions, 
testing for deamidation as part of release and stability for the commercial process is not proposed. 
This is acceptable. Furthermore, degradation of avalglucosidase alfa is primarily controlled by the 
proposed acceptance criteria for aggregation, which indirectly provides a control for deamidation as 
deamidation only occurs under conditions where avalglucosidase alfa heavily aggregates. Oxidized 
species were assessed during characterization and oxidation conditions are well-controlled during 
the process. In order to establish the acceptance criteria of avalglucosidase AS, lots have been 
used to treat patients in clinical trials have been taken into account,  
The acceptance criteria for bioburden and bacterial endotoxins are acceptable. 
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
Batch  analyses  are  presented  AS  batches  manufactured  according  to  all  processes  used,  The 
information provided on the batches is sufficient. All release results for all avalglucosidase alfa AS 
and  nanofiltrate  batches  (unformulated  bulk)  are  within  the  defined  acceptance  criteria  for  the 
avalglucosidase alfa AS and nanofiltrate.

Reference materials 
The reference standards are sufficiently described. The PS was subjected to full analytical, 
biological and physico-chemical characterization. 
The  primary  standard,  once  established,  is  used  to  qualify  all  future  working  standards  or  a  new 
primary standard if necessary. The primary standard will also be used for analytical testing for the 
purpose of characterization, where necessary. 
The  acceptance  criteria  for  the  annual  (re-)qualification  of  the  primary  standard  are  deemed 
acceptable. 
Container closure system 
Avalglucosidase AS is stored in a single-use polyethylene bag.  
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability studies based on ICH guidelines have been conducted for the active substance. Relevant 
parameters were selected to study the stability profile of the active substance.  
The analytical methods were validated and are described in the relevant sections of the dossier. 
The data from primary stability and supporting stability studies support the proposed shelf life at 
the designated storage condition in the proposed container closure system.  
Any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be reported to the 
Rapporteur and EMA. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Avalglucosidase alfa FP is a sterile lyophilized powder for injection administered by intravenous (IV) 
infusion following reconstitution with WFI and dilution. It is supplied in vials with a nominal 
strength of 100 mg/vial. The AS and the FP consist of the same formulation - an aqueous buffered 
solution, pH 6.2, containing 10 mg/mL avalglucosidase alfa protein, L-histidine, mannitol, glycine, 
and polysorbate 80.  
Prior to lyophilization, the nominal fill volume is 10.0 mL. An overfill is introduced. Each vial is filled 
with a target fill volume of 10.3 mL of AS in order to ensure that 10.0 mL of solution can be 
withdrawn following reconstitution. 
The primary packaging is 20 mL Type I clear colourless glass vial closed with a 20 mm siliconized 
grey elastomeric stopper with an outer FluroTec coating (no product contact) , crimped with an 
aluminium seal and a flip off cap. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The 
choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product.

* Nitrogen (USP, Ph. Eur.) is used following lyophilizer vacuum release at the end of the lyophilization cycle to overlay the drug product 
vials prior to capping. 
The components of the finished product, active substance and excipients, are adequately 
described. The choice of the excipients and their concentrations are justified.  
Development of a buffer and pH system, with specified concentrations of stabilizing/lyoprotectant 
agent and surfactant, is sufficiently described. Compatibility of excipients and the robustness of the 
formulation has been demonstrated by formulation development studies to assess impact of 
excipients on quality attributes. A lyophilisation cycle, based on experience with a similar product 
has been established, which is considered acceptable. The final formulation was shown to be robust 
and to ensure stability of avalglucosidase alfa in liquid (AS) and lyophilized (FP) states when stored 
at recommended storage conditions of 2-8°C. One single formulation has been used over the 
course of development of avalglucosidase alfa. 
No overages have been used for this FP. However, an overfill of 0.3mL is included to withdraw the 
desired amount of 10 mL.  
Physicochemical and biological properties are sufficiently discussed. After reconstitution, the 
product is a clear, colourless to pale yellow solution, and essentially free of visible particles. 
Avalglucosidase alfa has been manufactured according to fiveseveral processes variantsprocesses 
throughout the clinical and commercial development Process characterization studies were 
conducted at laboratory and industrial scales to support the changes and identify critical 
parameters that were relevant for process validation. The CPPs and the applied control strategy are 
described and are considered acceptable. Comparability assessments demonstrated that the lots 
produced by commercial process have characteristics and stability profile comparable to lots 
produced by previous processes. Extractables/Leachables from fill-finish line were tested and a 
filter validation is provided. Bacterial retention test and chemical compatibility of the FP and the 
used filters is provided. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturers 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report

Manufacturing and release activities of avalglucosidase alfa FP is conducted at EU GMP compliant 
sites. The FP is released in the EEA by Genzyme Ireland Limited, Waterford, Ireland.  
A batch range has been defined. The FP manufacturing process is standard and starts with AS 
pooling and mixing. The AS solution is then sterilized by filtration immediately prior to filling. Upon 
completion of the lyophilization cycle, vials are stoppered and capped, and visual inspection is 
performed before secondary packaging and labelling. 
The level of detail in the description of the FP manufacturing process is deemed sufficient. List of 
IPCs is endorsed and process parameter ranges are supported by manufacturing process 
development. Controls of critical steps and intermediates is sufficiently described.  
Validation of the avalglucosidase alfa FP manufacturing process was performed in accordance with 
EMA “Guideline on process validation for finished product –information and data to be provided in 
regulatory submissions” (EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/749073/2016). Process validation (PV) was 
performed on manufacturing process validation, aseptic process validation (including media fills) 
and simulated shipping validation. The process parameters met proven acceptable ranges as 
defined by process development, demonstrating the manufacturing process is consistent 
throughout the different steps. Process maximum holding times for bulks, filtration/filling time and 
transport arrangements have been justified / validated. Efficacy of aseptic processing was 
satisfactorily addressed.  
Control of Excipients 
Pharmacopoeia grade excipients (Ph. Eur.) are used in the production of AS and FP. No novel 
excipients or excipients of human or animal origin are used in the avalglucosidase alfa FP. All 
excipients are tested using analytical procedures to full compendial monograph requirements. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
The  avalglucosidase  FP  specifications  were  established  in  line  with  ICH  Q6B  and  include  general 
testing, tests for protein content, safety,  purity, impurities and potency.  
Acceptance criteria setting is based on a combination of several factors: clinical experience, release 
and stability data, current compendia or regulatory guidelines, and product-specific knowledge. 
Overall the proposed specifications are considered justified and sufficient to deliver product with 
consistent quality.  
A sufficiently detailed release and shelf life specification is presented. Parameters for lyophilized 
and reconstituted product are given in tabular format, including reference to used methods and 
specified limits for release and stability. All parameters are sufficiently justified.  
Impurities  
No elemental impurity above the ICH Q3D limits was detected and no extractable/leachable 
compound was identified to present a risk for the patient.  
A full assessment of the risk for the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the FP has been 
presented, including the intermediates (alglucosidase alfa and glycan E13), the AS, excipients, 
manufacturing process/equipment and packaging. Based on the information provided it is accepted 
that no risk was identified on the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the AS or the 
related FP. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary.

Analytical methods 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines.   
Analytical procedures that are common with the AS are discussed in the AS section. Analytical 
procedures dedicated to FP are mostly compendial and thus do not require specific validation, 
except for Dot Blot and HPLC (M6P content) methods which were validated as per ICH Q2 
requirements. The Dot Blot method can serve as an identity test for FP in lieu of peptide map 
testing for AS, as previously agreed during EMA scientific advice. Compendial methods were 
verified in accordance with compendial requirements. Verification data for sterility and endotoxin 
testing have been provided. 
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data from Process A, Process B, Process C1, Process C2A, and Process C2B, 
respectivelyof the finished product were provided. Among them, four batches were manufactured 
at the commercial site using the intended commercial process. The results are within the 
specifications and confirm consistency of the manufacturing process.  
Reference materials 
The reference standard used is the same as for testing AS.  
Container closure system  
The primary packaging materials consist of a clear colourless glass vial that meets the European 
Pharmacopoeia (Ph. Eur.) specifications for Type I glass and a 20 mm siliconized Type I grey 
elastomeric chlorobutyl stopper. The stoppers are crimped to the vials with an aluminium seal with 
plastic Flip-Off cover (non-product contact).  
The secondary packaging components of FP are vial cartons.  
The suitability of the selected primary packaging material for its intended use is supported by stability 
study results, container closure integrity testing and extractables/leachables studies. Avalglucosidase 
alfa  FP  contains  no  preservative.  Sterility  is  sufficiently  investigated  by  CCIT  testing  after 
manufacture and after storage (stability). Light protection is provided by secondary packaging (vial 
cartons), however the product is not sensitive to photo stress. 
The containers proposed for routine storage are those which have been used in the stability studies 
supporting the shelf life. 
The product is intended to be administered at final concentration of 0.5 mg/mL to 4 mg/mL via 
intravenous infusion using water for injections (for reconstitution) and 5% dextrose solution (for 
dilution). 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
A 4-year shelf life is claimed for avalglucosidase alfa FP, when stored at 2-8°C.  
Stability studies are carried out in accordance with current ICH/CPMP guidelines on a suitable number 
of batches representative of the final commercial product. The containers used in the stability studies 
are the same as those proposed for routine storage. Relevant parameters were selected to study the 
stability of the finished product. The analytical methods were appropriately validated. 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report

Overall, little or no change has been observed for the FP stored under long-term and accelerated 
conditions,  thus  supporting  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  for  routine  storage.  Additionally, 
photostability study was performed and demonstrated that the FP is not sensitive to light exposure. 
Temperature cycling stability study is also ongoing with one batch; up to date (24 months available), 
no change in the stability profile was observed.  
In-use stability studies support the instructions for use and handling in the SmPC which states that 
the reconstituted product can be stored up to 24 hours when refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C and diluted 
product can be stored up to 24 hours when refrigerated at 2°C to 8°C and up to 9 hours (including 
infusion time) when stored at room temperature (up to 25°C).  
A post-approval stability protocol and stability commitment is provided. 
Based  on  available  stability  data,  the  shelf-life  and  storage  conditions  as  stated  in  the  SmPC  are 
acceptable. 
2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
Material of animal origin used in host cell line culture, cell line development, cell banking, and the 
manufacturing process included. Concerning BSE/TSE risk, the data provided are satisfactory, and 
the risk is considered negligible due to the certified suitability or safety of the source materials, as 
well as dilution effects and the poor capability of CHO cells to express prion proteins.  
The cells banks were assayed for adventitious and endogenous agents according to ICHQA5 
guideline. No viral particles were observed other than retroviral-like particles normally seen in the 
MCB and EPC cell types. The starting material does not include any human material.  
The virus validation studies performed in addition to the initial studies of the centralized procedure 
of alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme) have been submitted and support the viral clearance of the 
Avalglucosidase alfa manufacturing process.  
Virus validation studies have been performed to meet the CPMP/BWP/268/95 guideline. The 
reduction factors for all 5 purification steps, using worst case parameters concerning viral 
clearance, were satisfactory regarding the virus removal/inactivation (the choice of model viruses 
complies with CPMP/BWP/268/95 guideline).  
The overall viral safety of avalglucosidase alfa is considered acceptable.

Quality Development 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product 
has been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency 
and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion 
that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.

In response to a major objection raised, the applicant has provided an adequate risk evaluation 
concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product, that there is no risk 
identified. The major objection is therefore considered resolved. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological

The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the 
conditions defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform 
clinical performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
Data has been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Avalglucosidase alfa was evaluated in a series of non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetic, and 
toxicology studies. These studies were conducted to evaluate the nonclinical safety and characterize 
efficacy in the in vivo animal models. Since the clinical route of administration is intravenous (IV) 
infusion, all nonclinical studies also administered avalglucosidase alfa via the IV route. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
A GAA knockout mouse model was used to evaluate safety and efficacy of SAM6 (NeoGAA) (Genzyme 
Corporation,  Framingham,  Massachusetts,  U.S.A.;  Raben,  et  al.  1998;  Raben  et  al.,  2000).  The 
homozygous  disruption  of  the  GAA  gene  (6neo/  6neo)  results  in  lack  of  enzyme  activity,  reduced 
autophagy  and  glycogen  accumulation  in  a  manner similar  to  the  adult  form  of  Pompe  disease  in 
humans. 
Throughout the preclinical programme, four studies were carried out to evaluate efficacy of enzyme 
replacement  therapy  with  SAM6  in  the  GAA  knockout  mouse  model.  The  approved  recombinant 
human (rh)GAA (Myozyme) was used as a comparator.  
The aim of the pharmacodynamics program of SAM6 (neoGAA3) was to evaluate glycogen clearance 
in the clinically relevant target tissues, the heart and skeletal muscle and the diaphragm.  
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
Using the GAA knockout mouse model, the pharmacodynamic effects of SAM6, GAM6 (neoGAA3b) 
and rhGAA were compared in 3-6 months old GAA knockout mice to evaluate the glycogen clearance 
in  the  skeletal  and  cardiac  muscle  (Study-07-1948).  After  four  weekly  administrations  of 
recombinant SAM6, GAM6 or rhGAA tissue specific reduction in glycogen deposition was evaluated. 
Common effects in animals treated with human enzymes are hypersensitivity reactions. In order to 
prevent  the  induction  of  hypersensitivity  by  the  study  medication,  all  groups  received  5  mg/kg 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 32/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
diphenhydramine (DPH) intraperitoneally 10-20 minutes prior to SAM6, GAM6 or rhGAA application. 
SAM6  and  GAM6  were  approximately  3-  to  7-fold more  efficacious  compared  to  rhGAA  on  a  dose 
basis. Comparisons between SAM6 and GAM6 indicate that SAM6 is more potent at equivalent doses 
of GAM6 in the heart and quadriceps muscle. Interestingly, mild multifocal myocardial necrosis was 
seen in a single mouse in the 20mg/kg SAM6 group. Histopathologic examination in other tissues did 
not reveal any SAM6 related adverse effects. A consequence of lysosomal glycogen accumulation in 
GAA  knockout  mice  is  found  in  target  tissues  including  liver,  kidney,  lung,  and  muscle  tissue. 
Cytoplasmic  swelling  and  vacuolation  was  assessed  with  specific  PAS  staining  and  found  to  be 
reduced in hearts of high dose SAM6 treated animals comparable to GAM6 or rhGAA application. No 
appreciable  difference  was  observed  in  other  tissues  at  other  concentrations  of  SAM6,  GAM6  or 
rhGAA.  While  there  is  a  clear  dose  dependent  effect  for  SAM6,  GAM6  and  rhGAA  in  reduction  of 
glycogen  content  in  the  heart,  this  is  not  seen  in  other  tissue.  Interestingly,  there  is  a  3.4  fold 
difference in the reduction of glycogen between the quadriceps and triceps in the highest SAM6 dose. 
Whether these differences in SAM6 distribution are significant for various skeletal muscles has not 
been evaluated.  
Based  on  the  hypothesis  that  higher  amounts  of  mannose-6-phosphate  (bisM6P)  on  rhGAA  will 
improve  absorption  into  target  tissues,  consecutive  enhancement  in  clearance  of  glycogen  was 
investigated in quadriceps, triceps, psoas and diaphragm of in 3-6 month old GAA  knockout mice 
(Study-09-3981).  The  glycogen  clearance  was  compared  between  rhGAA,  and  SAM6  containing 
variable levels of bisM6P in GAA knockout mice following 4-weekly dose administrations. The SAM6 
conjugates  were  dosed  at  20  mg/kg  and  rhGAA  at  100  mg/kg  for  intravenous  administration. 
Hypersensitivity  reactions  were  prevented  by  administration  of  5  mg/kg  diphenhydramine  (DPH) 
intraperitoneally,  10-20  minutes  prior  to  test  article  application  and  repeated  if  necessary.  Seven 
days after the last dose, animals were sacrificed and frozen tissues collected for glycogen content 
analyses. In parallel, blood samples were processed and evaluated for anti-rhGAA antibodies. The 
glycogen clearance in all tissues was comparable between rhGAA and SAM6 conjugates. Consistently, 
20  mg/kg  SAM6-1  was  less  potent  than  100  mg/kg  rhGAA  in  quadriceps,  triceps  and  psoas.  The 
overall  variability  of  tissue  glycogen  clearance  hindered  a  robust  statistic  evaluation.  Anti-rhGAA 
antibodies were detected in all animals of all groups. Taken together, SAM6-1 containing two glycans 
was significantly less potent than the other SAM6-conjugates in all tissues except the diaphragm. 
Conversely,  these  data  indicate  that  three  or  more  glycans  are  required  to  obtain  a  substantial 
increase in potency of SAM6 relative to rhGAA. However, the differences in glycogen clearance were 
not  consistent  across  all  muscle  tissues  examined  in  this  study.  The  variability  of  tissue  glycogen 
levels in the diaphragm hampered establishing a clear and significant pattern of rank order of potency 
among treatment groups. Thus, there were no consistent differences between the potency of SAM6-
2 through SAM6-5.  
Glycogen  clearance  following  administration  of  4-weekly  doses  of  rhGAA  and  neoGAA  was 
investigated  in  GAA  knockout  mice  (Study-10-00587).  Diphenhydramine  was  administered  to 
prevent a test article related hypersensitivity reaction prior to the 4- weekly doses of vehicle, 20, 60, 
or 100 mg/kg rhGAA or 4, 12, 20 mg/kg neoGAA. The study was terminated 7 days after the last 
dose. The heart, quadriceps, triceps, diaphragm and psoas muscles were collected and analysed for 
glycogen  clearance.  Blood  samples  were  used  for  antibody  analysis.  No  statistically  significant 
differences  were  observed  in  glycogen  reduction  in  the  heart,  quadriceps  and  diaphragm  tissue 
following administration of neoGAA (SAM6) compared to rhGAA administered at 5-fold higher doses. 
Dose dependency and comparability were less conclusive in psoas and triceps. The level of glycogen 
reduction in the highest dose group of rhGAA was significantly better than 20mg/kg neoGAA. Taken 
together, the amount of glycogen reduction was strongly dependent on muscle type, and neoGAA 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report

was not superior to rhGAA, in particular in the triceps and psoas. Interestingly, tibialis anterior and 
soleus muscle were collected, but no results were provided in terms of glycogen reduction.  
Anti-rhGAA antibodies were detected in all animals of all groups. Due to expected hypersensitivity 
response, 5 mg/kg DPH was administered intraperitoneally prior to test article administration starting 
from the second administration. Beside this prophylactic administration, a second dose of 5 mg/kg 
DPH  was  given  to  animals  showing  signs  of  hypersensitivity  after  test  article  administration.  Four 
animals died during the study. One animal died of unknown reason when receiving the fourth dose 
of vehicle. Another animal received the second dose of neoGAA (4 mg/kg) and died approximately 
30 minutes thereafter. The third animal received rhGAA (20mg/kg) and died after the second dose. 
Although the cause of death is unknown, the event coincided with the second dose of DPH and maybe 
indicative  for  a  hypersensitivity  reaction.  Lastly,  one  animal  died  the  day  after  the  last  dose  of 
neoGAA (12 mg/kg) and the reason is unknown. The reason for death is unknown in all cases, but 
timing of death is consistent with enzyme administration in two out of four cases, indicating a causal 
relationship to hypersensitivity against the test article. 
Study 11-02367 investigated the effect of different levels of sialic acid in neoGAA on reduction of 
glycogen content in various tissues of the GAA knockout mice. The test articles were applied in 4-
weekly intravenous doses (4 and 12 mg/kg groups), containing either 5.5 mol/mol (neoGAA-5SA) or 
7.2 mol/mol sialic acid (neoGAA - 7SA). The glycogen content was determined in heart, quadriceps, 
and triceps muscle. Dose concentration analysis was performed on dose retains from the first and 
fourth doses. Overall, no differences were found between neoGAA-5SA and neoGAA-7SA in any of 
the examined tissues (heart, quadriceps, and triceps). While there was no glycogen clearance at the 
4 mg/kg dose level in skeletal muscle, at 12 mg/kg glycogen was reduced also in skeletal muscle. In 
triceps,  12  mg/kg  neoGAA-7SA  was  significantly  more  effective  than  12  mg/kg  neoGAA-5SA.  An 
explanation for the latter observation is not provided. Overall, the content of sialic acid (5.5 or 7.2 
mol/mol) in rhGAA had no significant effect on glycogen clearance in this study. 
2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamic studies have been conducted. This was considerable acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
Safety pharmacology was implemented in the 26-week toxicity study of SAM 6 (avalglucosidase alfa) 
in cynomolgus monkeys (Study 0658-11097). The criteria were compatible with the ICH S7A and 
S7B guidelines and represent the core battery. The observations indicated that there were no SAM6-
related  changes  in  neurobehavioral,  electrocardiogram  (ECG)  parameters,  heart  rate,  core  body 
temperature, activity or respiratory rate following administration at the highest dose administered 
200 mg/kg IV. The mean Area Under the concentration time curve (AUC)0-inf exposure following the 
thirteenth infusion at the no observable adverse effect level (NOAEL) was 28161 μg.h/mL. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies have been conducted. This was considered acceptable 
since avalglucosidase alfa is a protein and is expected to be metabolically degraded through peptide 
hydrolysis, thus unlikely to be candidate for cytochrome P450 mediated drug-drug interactions.

2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In order to investigate the pharmacokinetic properties of avalglucosidase three dedicated single dose 
PK  studies  and  two  biodistribution  studies  were  conducted  in  GAA  knockout  mice.  In  addition, 
toxicokinetic data were collected in the scope of the repeat-dose toxicity studies conducted in mice 
and cynomolgus monkeys.  
Qualification  of 
the  4-MUG  (4-  methylumbelliferone-α-D-glycopyranoside)  assay  (Study 
13GSTR088)  to  detect  avalglucosidase  alfa  in  sera  and  tissues  of  non  clinical  species  included 
analysis  of  mouse  and  monkey  serum  as  well  as  tissues  from  CD1  and  GAA  knockout  mice.  No 
avalglucosidase alfa activity was detected in the tissues of GAA knockout mice; however, endogenous 
alglucosidase  alfa  was  detected  in  wild-type  mice.  The  tissue-specific  LLOQ  was  determined  by 
measurement  of  tissue  homogenates  from  GAA  knockout  mice  spiked  with  avalglucosidase  alfa. 
Overall,  the  assay  was  qualified  for  the  quantitation  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  in  mouse  heart, 
quadriceps, triceps, psoas, diaphragm, liver, and serum, rat serum, dog serum, and in monkey liver 
and serum (Study DIV1922). The 4-MUG assay for quantification of avalglucosidase in CD-1 mouse 
(Study DOS1648) and cynomolgus monkey (Study 11GSTR069) serum was validated regarding 
intra-assay  precision,  inter-assay  precision  and  accuracy,  selectivity,  dilution  linearity  and 
freeze/thaw stability. A quantification range from 1000 to 45000 ng/mL and 300 to 4883 ng/mL was 
successfully validated for mouse and monkey serum, respectively. A similar assay was set up for the 
measurement of alglucosidase alfa activity. 
An anti-neoGAA antibody (Ab) ELISA was successfully validated for the determination of anti-neoGAA 
antibody  titers  in  CD-1  or  GAA  knockout  mouse  and  cynomolgus  monkey  serum.  Validation  was 
performed in sera spiked with anti-neoGAA antibodies. The impact of avalglucosidase alfa present in 
the samples was also evaluated and drug tolerance was established at > 10 µg/mL avalglucosidase 
alfa. Similarly, an ELISA assay was successfully set up for the determination of anti-rhGAA antibody 
titers in CD-1 or GAA knockout mouse serum.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters after a single IV administration of 20 mg/kg of avalglucosidase alfa and 
alglucosidase alfa were comparatively evaluated in two separate studies in GAAKO mice (Studies 
08-2344 and 10-00813). Samples were analysed 5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 240 and 360 minutes post 
dose. Although the absolute values of pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters differed between the studies, 
reduced  T1/2  and  VZ  were  observed  in  the  avalgucosidase  alfa  treated  groups  as  compared  to 
alglucosidase. Clearance (CL) tended to be higher in avalglucosidase alfa treated animals. Systemic 
exposure (AUC) was higher in the alglucosidase groups of both studies, whereas no equivocal trend 
could  be  observed  for  Cmax,  which  was  either  higher  or  lower  for  each  of  the  molecules  when 
comparing the results of both studies. 
An additional single dose PK study was conducted in GAAKO mice in order to comparatively evaluate 
the properties of avalglucosidase containing either 5.5 or 7.2 mol/mol sialic acid (Study 10-00540). 
No  significant  differences  in  any  of  the  evaluated  PK  parameters  were  observed  between  the  two 
investigated molecules. 
Toxicokinetic parameters after repeated IV administration (once per week for four weeks) of 4, 40 
and  120  mg/kg  avalglucosidase  alfa  were  evaluated  in  CD-1  mice  in  the  scope  of  an  exploratory 
toxicology study (Study 10-00183). Toxicokinetic analysis was conducted after the first and last 
administration. TK evaluation revealed an increase in exposure, decrease in clearance and increase 
in T1/2 with increasing dose. In addition, T1/2 and VZ were statistically significantly decreased after 
four administrations of 120 mg/kg when compared to the first administration. In the 4 mg/kg and in 
the 40 mg/kg groups no relevant differences between the first and last dose were detected.

Toxicokinetic evaluation was also included in a juvenile toxicity study in Crl:CD1 mice administered 
10, 50 or 100 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa every other week for a total of 9 weeks (in summary 5 or 
6 administrations) (Study JUV0033). An approximate dose relation was observed with regard to 
Cmax for all dose groups. In contrast, AUC increased disproportionally with increasing dose. Slightly 
higher exposure was observed in female animals as compared to males. 
The repeat-dose toxicity studies in cynomolgus monkeys also comprised toxicokinetic evaluation.  
In  an  exploratory  study  (Study  #  1213-004),  cynomolgus  monkeys  were  administered  4,  40  or 
120 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa once weekly for four weeks. Avalglucosidase alfa levels were below 
the detection limit in the 4 mg/kg dose group. Exposure in the 40 mg/kg and 120 mg/kg dose groups 
was dose-related (Cmax: 192 ± 63.3 and 862 ± 302 µg/mL, respectively) and clearly increased in 
the 120 mg/kg group after the fourth infusion (1273 ± 214 µg/mL). Thus, AUC0-inf (3155±911 vs 
5900  ±  660  µg▪hr/mL)  and  AUC0-inf/dose  (26.3  ±  7.59  vs  49.2  ±  5.50  µg▪hr/mL/dose)  were 
statistically significantly elevated after the fourth infusion as compared to the first infusion of 120 
mg/kg. In contrast, Vz and CL decreased with increasing numbers of infusions.  
In  a  26-week,  GLP-compliant,  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  (Study  #  0658-11097)  cynomolgus 
monkeys were administered 0, 50 or 200 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa every second week via 6-hour 
IV infusion. Exposure to avalglucosidase alfa was dose-dependent (Cmax: 566 ± 157 and 3892 ± 
506 μg/mL; AUC0-inf/dose: 48.5 ± 13.6 and 93.6 ± 14.3 µg▪hr/mL/dose after the first infusion) and 
increased with increasing numbers of infusions (Cmax: 861 ± 189 and 5284 ± 1440 µg/mL; AUC0-
inf/dose:  74.2  ±  19.5  and  141  ±  53.5  µg▪hr/mL/dose  after  the  thirteenth  infusion).  In  addition, 
increasing t1/2 and decreasing CL was observed. 
Observations in both studies indicate that saturation has been reached by repeated administrations 
of the high dose. 
In order to investigate the influence of increasing plasma levels of the glycan linker as a consequence 
of avalglucosidase alfa degradation on the toxicity of avalglucosidase alfa, a study was conducted in 
cynomolgus monkeys (Study TXC1530). Animals were administered with 50 mg/kg avalglucosidase 
alfa every other week for 13 weeks, additionally spiked with 0, 3, 6 or 12.55 mg/kg of Genz-669342 
(glycan). No influence of the glycan on T1/2 or exposure was observed. 
Tissue levels after one single administration of 20 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa 
were  evaluated  in  GAA  knockout  mice  (Study  10-00818).  Specifically,  liver,  heart,  triceps, 
quadriceps,  tibialis  anterior,  diaphragm,  brain,  spleen,  and  kidneys  were  investigated  1,  6  or  24 
hours post dose. 51.15% - 68.36% of the injected dose of avalglucosidase alfa were detected in the 
liver within 24 hours. Moreover, avalglucosidase alfa was found in heart (0.32% - 0.38%), quadriceps 
(0.03% - 0.05%) and triceps (0.02%). Comparable alglucosidase levels were detected in the heart 
(0.2%  –  0.37%),  quadriceps  (0.03-0.04%)  and  triceps  (0.01%  -  0.03%).  Overall,  similar  tissue 
distribution  was  observed  for  both  molecules.  Statistically  significantly  higher  tissue  levels  of 
avalglucosidase  alfa  were  only  found  in  the  heart  at  the  6-  and  24-hour  time  points  after 
administration. 
An  additional  tissue  distribution  study  combined  with  an  in  vivo  micronucleus  test  was  conducted 
(Study 09-3559). GAA knock out mice were administered not only a single dose but up to three 
doses of 50 mg/kg avalglucosidase given in 4 hour-intervals. Tissues were evaluated 6 hours after 
administration of 50 mg/kg, or 24 hours after the first dose of 50, 100 or 150 mg/kg. Enzyme activity 
was evaluated in bone marrow only. Liver, heart, triceps, quadriceps, tibialis anterior, diaphragm, 
psoas, spleen, and kidneys were collected, but not analysed. Avalglucosidase activity increased in a 
dose-dependent manner in the bone marrow, from 121.2 ± 27.9 μg/g wet tissue over 218.9 ± 58.2 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 36/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
μg/g  wet  tissue  to  369.1  ±  70.5  μg/g  wet  tissue,  following  one,  two  or  three  administrations, 
respectively. In addition, the tissue activity in the bone marrow increased from 6 to 24 hours after a 
single administration. 
No dedicated studies on the metabolism of avalgucosidase were conducted in animals. However, in 
vitro  studies  with  human  hepatocytes  were  performed  to  investigate  whether  hydrazine-structure 
containing degradation products may be formed upon breakdown of avalglucosidase alfa.  
Excretion  and  pharmacokinetic  drug  interaction  studies  were  not  specifically  investigated  for 
avalglucosidase alfa, which is acceptable considering that the active substance is a protein.  
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The  toxicology  program  was  designed  to  determine  the  safety  profile  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  in  a 
series  of  toxicology  studies  in  the  mouse,  rabbit,  and  monkey.  Completed  studies  include  repeat-
dose  toxicology  studies  of  14-days  (mouse  and  monkey),  1-  (mouse  and  monkey)  and  6-months 
(monkey)  in  duration.  Although  genotoxicity  studies  are  not  required  by  ICH  Guidelines,  an 
exploratory  in  vivo  micronucleus  test  was  conducted  in  mice.  Developmental  and  reproductive 
toxicology studies included fertility (mouse), embryo-fetal toxicity (mouse and rabbit), and pre- and 
post-natal developmental toxicity (mouse) studies. A juvenile toxicity study was conducted in 21-
day old mice. Local tolerance was evaluated in the repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
2.5.4.1.  Single dose toxicity 
No single dose studies have been conducted to evaluate the toxicity of avalglucosidase alfa. Any 
evaluation of acute toxicity was determined after the first dose administration in the repeat-dose 
studies. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.4.2.  Repeat dose toxicity 
In an exploratory, repeat-dose toxicity study (Study # FFA00125), CD-1 mice were dosed 50 mg/kg 
rhGAA,  avalglucosidase  alfa  sialic  acid  modification  (SAM,  corresponds  to  avalglucosidase  alfa)  or 
galactose modification of alglucosidase alfa (GAM) IV every other day for 14  days (n=10/sex and 
group).  Findings  with  unknown  relation  to  the  test  article  were  increased  reticulocyte  counts, 
increased  serum  calcium,  phosphorus,  and  potassium  in  avalglucosidase  alfa-treated  males; 
macroscopic  findings  in  the  male  reproductive  tract  upon  rhGAA  and  avalgucosidase  treatment; 
increased  spleen  weights  in  rhGAA  alfa-treated  male  and  avalglucosidase  alfa-treated  male  and 
female  mice;  multifocal  liver  necrosis  and  inflammatory  infiltrates  upon  treatment  with 
avalglucosidase. 
A  second  exploratory  study  (Study  #  Study  10-00183)  was  conducted  in  order  to  evaluate 
potential toxicities of avalglucosidase. Alfa CD-1 mice were administered 4, 40 or 120 mg/kg neoGAA 
(n=9 animals/sex/group) once weekly for four weeks. Upon occurrence of anaphylaxis, animals were 
treated  with  DPH.  Animals  were  observed  for  clinical  signs,  gross  pathology,  histopathology,  TK 
parameters  and  anti-drug  antibodies.  Three  animals  of  the  4  mg/kg  dose  group  died  or  were 
euthanized on study day 22 after administration of neoGAA. The Applicant attributed the deaths of 
these  animals  to  hypersensitivity  reactions.  It  remains  elusive  why  the  severity  of  the 
hypersensitivity response was exceptionally high in the low dose group while it was manageable by 
DPH administration in other dosing groups. Overall, the hypersensitivity reactions are considered a 
Nexviadyme

phenomenon  related  to  species-specific  reaction  to  the  administered  protein  and  the  related 
observations  are  therefore  not  followed  up  further.  Sporadic  changes  in  organ  weights,  organ-to-
body  weight  ratios  and  organ-to-brain  weight  ratios  in  neoGAA  treated  male  animals  were  not 
accompanied  by  microscopic  changes  and  are  thus  not  considered  of  toxicological  relevance,  in 
accordance with the Applicant’s conclusion. TK evaluation revealed an increase in exposure, decrease 
in clearance and increase in T1/2 with increasing dose. In addition, T1/2 and VZ were statistically 
significantly  decreased  after  four  administrations  of  120  mg/kg  when  compared  to  the  first 
administration.  Anti-neoGAA  antibodies  were  detected  in  all  animals  except  for  the  vehicle  group 
with mean titers of 462,196 (± 494,596), 1,761,493 (± 2,223,027), and 1,862,543 (± 2,731,156) 
for Groups 2, 3 and 4, respectively. 
The  findings  of  Study  #  FFA00125  were  not  confirmed  in  this  second  study.  However, 
administration schemes clearly differed between the two studies, i.e. administration every other day 
versus once weekly. According to the proposed SmPC, avalglucosidase alfa will be administered every 
other week and, thus, the once weekly administration is regarded as a more relevant administration 
scheme. Overall, the proposed NOAEL set to 120 mg/kg is acceptable. 
A non-GLP, 28-day repeat dose toxicity study (Study # 1213-004) was conducted in cynomolgus 
monkeys for exploratory purposes. Animals were administered 4, 40 or 120 mg/kg avalglucosidase 
alfa  once  weekly.  Animals  were  observed  for  clinical  signs,  haematology,  coagulation,  clinical 
chemistry, and urinalysis, gross pathology, histopathology, TK parameters and anti-drug antibodies. 
No  adverse  findings  related  to  avalglucosidase  alfa  were  observed.  With  regard  to  toxicokinetics, 
avalglucosidase alfa levels were below the detection limit in the 4 mg/kg dose group. Exposure in 
the  40  mg/kg  and  120  mg/kg  dose  groups  was  dose-related  (Cmax:  192  ±  63.3  and  862  ±  302 
µg/mL, respectively) and clearly increased in the 120 mg/kg group after the fourth infusion (1273 ± 
214 µg/mL). Thus, AUC0-inf (3155±911 vs 5900 ± 660 µg▪hr/mL) and AUC0-inf/dose (26.3 ± 7.59 
vs 49.2 ± 5.50 µg▪hr/mL/dose) were statistically significantly elevated after the fourth infusion as 
compared  to  the  first  infusion  of  120  mg/kg.  In  contrast,  Vz  and  CL  decreased  with  increasing 
numbers  of  infusions.  These  observations  indicate  that  saturation  has  been  reached  by  repeated 
administrations of the high dose. Anti-drug antibodies were detected at dose-dependent levels in all 
animals that received avalglucosidase alfa. 
A  26-week,  GLP-compliant,  repeat-dose  toxicity  study  (Study  #  0658-11097)  was  conducted  in 
cynomolgus  monkeys.  Animals  were  administered  0,  50  or  200  mg/kg  avalglucosidase  alfa  every 
second  week  via  6-hour  IV  infusion  (n=6/sex/group).  Evaluation  included  mortality,  clinical 
observations, physical examinations, body weight, food consumption, electrocardiographic, central 
nervous  system  and  ophthalmologic  examinations,  respiratory  rates,  heart  rate,  core  body 
temperature,  haematology,  clinical  chemistry,  coagulation  and  urinalysis.  No  test-article  related 
adverse events were observed. Exposure to avalglucosidase alfa was dose-dependent (Cmax: 566 ± 
157 and 3892 ± 506 μg/mL; AUC0-inf/dose: 48.5 ± 13.6 and 93.6 ± 14.3 µg▪hr/mL/dose after the 
first infusion) and increased with increasing numbers of infusions (Cmax: 861 ± 189 and 5284 ± 
1440 µg/mL; AUC0-inf/dose:74.2 ± 19.5 141 ± 53.5 µg▪hr/mL/dose after the thirteenth infusion). 
Together with increasing t1/2 and decreasing CL, the occurrence of saturation kinetics is conceivable. 
Anti-drug antibodies were detected in all animals administered with avalglucosidase alfa with levels 
increasing in dependence of the dose and number of administrations. Overall, the proposed NOAEL 
set to 200 mg/mL is considered acceptable.

2.5.4.3.  Genotoxicity 
Despite not necessarily required for biotechnology derived pharmaceuticals, an exploratory in vivo 
micronucleus test into a biodistribution study was conducted in GAAKO mice receiving 0, 50, 100 or 
150  mg/kg  on  one  single  day.  No  induction  of  micronuclei  by  avalglucosidase  alfa  was  observed 
within 24 hours.  
2.5.4.4.  Carcinogenicity 
No carcinogenicity studies have been conducted. A risk assessment based on literature, data reviews 
and  in  silico  search.  In  addition,  an  evaluation  of  potential  release  of  the  linker  moiety  of  Genz-
669342 and other hydrazine containing compounds from avalglucosidase alfa. Overall, no evidence 
for a carcinogenic potential of avalglucosidase alfa was detected. 
2.5.4.5.  Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
In  order  to  address  potential  effects  of  avalglucosidase  on  reproduction  and  development  the 
Applicant performed a fertility- and early embryonic development to implantation study in mice, an 
embryo-fetal development study in mice and rabbits as well as a pre- and post-natal development 
study in mice. 
A GLP-compliant study of fertility- and early embryonic development was conducted in mice (Study 
FER0511)  administered  10,  20  or  50  mg/kg  avalglucosidase  IV  every  other day  either  10  weeks 
before  mating  through  cohabitation  (male  animals)  or  2  weeks  prior  to  mating  until  G7  (female 
animals). Upon the occurrence of anaphylactic reactions (dose number 6 in male and dose number 
2 in female animals), all animals were administered with DPH. Several male and female animals died 
after  repeated  administrations  of  avalglucosidase  alfa.  However,  no  relation  to  dose  could  be 
established  and  hypersensitivity  reactions  was  assumed  to  be  the  cause  of  death.  Other  clinical 
observations  included  decreased  motor  activity,  hyperreactivity  to  touch  and  ataxia.  Also  these 
findings did not appear to be dose-related, but were definitely related to the test article as no such 
observations were made in the vehicle or DPH control groups. The time needed for mating was higher 
than controls in the groups of male and female animals receiving 50 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa, but 
within the historical range of the testing facility. Some deviations from control groups were observed 
in the weights of male reproductive organs; however, no dose relation was established in the context 
of these findings. Sperm evaluation and histopathology of testes and epididymides did not reveal any 
abnormalities. No avalglucosidase alfa-related effects were observed on female reproductive organs, 
fertility  and  pregnancy  outcomes.  The  NOAEL  set  at  the  highest  dose  of  50  mg/kg  is  therefore 
acceptable.  DPH  administration  started  after  dose  number  6  for  males  and  dose  number  2  for 
females. Thus, as the first deaths of female animals occurred at dosing day 9, i.e. after the fourth 
avalglucosidase alfa dose, all deaths of female animals occurred when DHP treatment was already 
initiated.  
A GLP-compliant study in pregnant CD-1 mice (Study TER0685) was conducted to assess potential 
effects of avalglucosidase alfa on early embryonic development. Mice were dosed with 10, 20 and 50 
mg/kg  once  daily  starting  from  GD  6  through  15.  No  mortality  or  hypersensitivity  reactions  were 
observed throughout the whole study period. In addition, no clinical signs, body weight changes or 
other  macroscopic  findings  related  to  administration  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  were  observed.  With 
regard to ovarian and uterine examinations, no abnormalities were observed in the 10 and 20 mg/kg 
dosing  groups.  In  contrast,  the  number  of  post-implantation  losses  and  late  resorptions  was 
increased in the 50 mg/kg dosing group. No fetal malformations were recorded in any of the dosing 
Nexviadyme

groups.  Toxicokinetic  evaluation  revealed  that  maternal  plasma  levels  for  avalglucosidase  alfa 
increased in a disproportionate manner with increasing dose levels. From the 10 to the 50 mg/kg 
dose level exposure increased by 9.90-fold (Cmax) and 12.8-fold (AUC0-24h). Whereas the tissue 
levels in maternal liver and placenta also increased dose-dependently, no or only very low levels of 
avalglucosidase  alfa  were  detected  in  fetal  livers.  As  fetal  livers  containing  low  levels  of 
avalglucosidase were evenly distributed between control and treatment groups, no placental transfer 
of  avalglucosidase  is  presumed  and  measured  values  are  considered  likely  to  be  endogenous 
alglucosidase. Overall, the maternal NOAEL of 50 mg/kg and the developmental NOAEL of 20 mg/kg 
are agreed upon.  
An additional GLP-compliant embryo-fetal development study was conducted in NZW rabbits (Study 
TER0686).  Two  preceding  dose  range  finding  studies  were  performed  in  non-pregnant  (Study 
DDO1378) and pregnant rabbits (Study TEP0366). For the pivotal embryo-fetal development study 
time-mated NZW rabbits were administered 30, 60 and 100 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa daily via IV 
infusion from gestation day (GD) 6 through 19. Animals were observed until GD 29. Maternal adverse 
effects observed were limited to reduced food consumption and lower mean body weights in the 60 
and 100 mg/kg dosing groups. Body weight loss was statistically significant from GD 19 to 20 in the 
100 mg/kg group and food consumption statistically significantly differed to controls during GD 13 
to 20 in the 60 and 100 mg/kg groups. Thus, the maternal NOAEL was determined at 30 mg/kg/day. 
No  malformations  or  developmental  variations  that  could  be  attributed  to  administration  of 
avalglucosidase  alfa  were  observed.  The  fetal  NOAEL  was  therefore  determined  to  be  the  highest 
administered  dose,  i.e.  100  mg/kg/day.  Toxicokinetic  evaluation  revealed  dose-proportionate  or 
slightly disproportionate exposure, whereby a higher dose-related increase was observed regarding 
AUC0-24 (4 to 6-fold) than regarding Cmax (3-fold). No accumulation was observed when comparing 
samples collected on GD 6 and 19.  
A  pre-  and  postnatal  development  study  (GLP-compliant)  was  conducted  in  CD1  mice  (Study 
DPN0378). Pregnant mice were administered 10, 20 or 50 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa via IV bolus 
every other day from GD 6 through Day 19 or 20 post partum. In addition, starting from dose number 
5, animals were prophylactically given 5 mg/kg DPH via intraperitoneal injection. Administration to 
mice that did not deliver a litter was stopped on GD 22. F1 pups were exposed to avalglucosidase 
alfa exclusively via their mothers (gestation and lactation). Three deaths of F0 female mice occurred 
and were distributed over all three dosing groups. Thus, these deaths were not dose-depended and 
can be considered to be not test article-related. Apart from that no noteworthy clinical observations 
were made in F0 animals. No influence of the test article on the number of pregnancies, litter-size 
and –viability or other related parameters was reported. In the F1 generation no deaths related to 
avalglucosidase  alfa  occurred.  In  addition,  no  clinical  observations  or  any  effects  on  sexual 
maturation,  mating,  behaviour,  reproductive  capacity  or  gross  pathology  were  reported.  Some 
statistically significant differences in body weight gains between various dosing groups occurred but 
were  limited  to  specific  time  intervals  and  not  persistent  and  therefore  not  considered  relevant. 
Overall, the NOAEL of 50 mg/kg every other day for pre- and postnatal development is supported. 
2.5.4.6.  Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic  data  have  been  collected  from  pharmacokinetics,  repeated  dose  toxicity  and 
reproductive and development toxicity studies and are discussed under the corresponding sections.

2.5.4.7.  Local Tolerance  
The  assessment  of  local  tolerability  was  incorporated  into  repeat-dose  toxicology  studies  in 
cynomolgus monkeys by macroscopic and microscopic evaluation of the IV infusion sites. No findings 
related to avalglucosidase alfa administration were observed. 
2.5.4.8.  Other toxicity studies 
Antibody formation to avalglucosidase alfa was evaluated in the scope of various repeat-dose toxicity 
studies.  
Avalglucosidase alfa is not likely to cross the blood brain barrier by its relatively high molecular size. 
This property is intrinsic to lyosomal enzymes, such as alglucosidase alfa or avalglucosidase alfa. In 
addition, no behavioural or CNS-related effects were observed in repeat-dose toxicity studies in mice 
or  monkeys.  Similarly,  in  clinical  studies  no  indications  for  dependence  or  abuse  potential  were 
reported. No specific studies have been conducted to investigate potential for dependence and this 
is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
In  silico  evaluation  was  performed  for  a  number  of  impurities  that  were,  as  a  consequence, 
adequately classified based on their properties as known mutagenic carcinogens or known mutagens. 
Other impurities were classified due to structural alerts for mutagenicity unrelated or related to the 
drug substance. 
An  in  vitro  bacterial  reverse  mutation  assay  was  performed  for  N-hydroxysuccinimide  that  was 
classified class 3 after in silico evaluation. No increase in the number of revertant bacterial colonies 
of 5 Salmonella typhimurium strains was identified with or without S9 activation up to a dose level 
of 5000 µg/plate. Therefore N-hydroxysuccinimide was classified a Class 5 impurity. 
In a series of additional studies, toxicity of the glycan-linker complex Genz-669342 was evaluated. 
These  studies  included  an  in  vivo  repeat-dose  toxicity  evaluation  in  monkeys,  a  bacterial  reverse 
mutation  test  and  an  in  vitro  chromosome  aberration  test  in  human  lymphocytes.  No  concerns 
regarding toxicity, mutagenicity or genotoxicity were identified from the study results. In the in vivo 
repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  no  adverse  effects  were  observed  at  levels  of  up  to  12.5  mg/kg 
administered every other week for 13 weeks. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to "Guideline on the environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for human use" 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2), no ERA studies have been submitted. This is acceptable since 
avalglucosidase alfa, is an enzyme consisting of naturally occurring amino acids linked to a glycan 
molecule.  
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The GAA knock out mouse model is suitable to mimic the adult form of Pompe disease. The reduction 
of  elevated  tissue  glycogen  levels  serves  as  a  solid  parameter  to  document  efficacy  of  enzyme 
replacement  therapy.  In  all  non-clinical  pharmacological  studies  using  the  GAA  knockout  mouse, 
SAM6 (avalglucosidase alfa) revealed glycogen clearance from target tissues, particularly the heart, 
quadriceps and triceps. Based on dose comparison, avalglucosidase alfa is 3 to 7-fold more potent. 
However,  the  amount  of  glycogen  clearance  was  similar  to  that  of  Myozyme  in  two  studies. 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 41/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Importantly,  at  least  a  concentration  of  12  mg/kg  IV  is  considered  to  be  effective  in  glycogen 
reduction in the diaphragm and skeletal muscles. Of note, the reduction of glycogen varies dependent 
on  the  skeletal  muscles  investigated  in  non-clinical  studies  (07-1948).  This  tissue  variability  was 
argued  to  be  dependent  on  the  expression  level  of  the  cation  independent  mannose-6-phosphate 
receptor  (CIMPR),  which  is  most  prominently  expressed  in  the  heart.  Thus,  avalglucosidase  alfa 
triggered glycogen reduction was best seen in the heart followed by quadriceps and diaphragm.  An 
increase  in  SAM6  dosage  from  12  to  20  mg/kg  had  no  influence  on  further  glycogen  reduction  in 
quadriceps  and  triceps.  This  plateau  effect  and  reduced  effects  seen  in  other  skeletal  muscles  is 
referred to lower CIMPR expression levels in type II fibres. 
The amount of sialic acid within avalglucosidase alfa (in the range of 5.5 to 7.2 mol/mol sialic acid) 
does not contribute to significant differences in potency to reduce glycogen accumulations in GAA 
knockout mice. Similarly, at least three glycan residues within avalglucosidase alfa were needed to 
obtain potent glycogen clearance in target tissues in GAA knockout mice. 
Although pharmacologically relevant, the distribution of SAM6 into the brain was not investigated. 
No information on a potential reduction of glycogen or autophagy in the brain is available. 
Pharmacokinetic evaluations after single and repeated administrations of avalglucosidase alfa reveal 
dose-dependent  exposure  in  mice  and  monkeys.  When  comparing  the  doses  administered, 
alterations in pharmacokinetic parameters become only apparent after repeated administrations of 
high  doses  (120  mg/kg),  including  a  more  than  dose-proportional  exposure,  increasing  T1/2  and 
increasing CL, which points towards saturation. High variability was observed in clearance, Vz and 
systemic  exposure  (Cmax  and  AUC)  among  studies  in  which  animals  were  treated  with  the  same 
doses, being these differences higher in study 08-2344 compared to studies 10-00813 and 10-00540 
performed in mice and between studies 1213-004 and 0658-11097 in monkeys. It is acknowledged 
that  the  high  variability  observed  in  PK  parameters  among  studies  might  be  caused  by  the  inter-
study  variability  and,  in  case  of  monkeys,  also  by  the  smaller  number  of  animals  tested  in  Study 
1213-004  compared  to  Study  0658-11097.  The  PK  profile  (prolongation  in  half-life  and  increased 
systemic exposure, with a corresponding decrease in clearance with increased dose levels) is similar 
among studies and high ranges of AUC0-2w and Cmax values were also observed in humans 
Although knockout and wild-type mice have not been administered the same doses of avalglucosidase 
in  the  single  dose  PK  studies,  exposure  in  wild-type  animals  seem higher  when  projecting  results 
from knockout animals to wild-type animals. The CHMP further noted that discrimination between 
endogenous  alglucosidase  alfa  and  administered  avalglucosidase  alfa  is  not  possible  with  the 
employed method of quantification. 
Pharmacokinetic  parameters  after  repeated  dosing  of  avalglucosidase  were  only  analysed  in  CD1, 
and not in GAA knockout mice. The tissue distribution studies involved only single dose administration 
of 20 mg/kg and up to three administrations of 50 mg/kg in 4 hour-intervals. These study designs 
do  not  reflect  the  clinical  dosing  schedule  of  20  or  40  mg/kg  every  other  week  as  a  life-long 
treatment. Especially in the case of avalglucosidase alfa that has been modified to target, among 
other tissues, the skeletal muscles more efficiently, a repeat-dose biodistribution study mimicking 
the clinical dosing schedule might have been useful to elucidate the effectiveness of the modification. 
In such study, potential accumulation of avalglucosidase alfa might have been detected and relevant 
information  would  have  been  collected  on  the  enzyme  levels  to  which  GAA  knock  out  mice  are 
restored as compared to normal levels after chronic treatment. 
Exposure  was  comparable  at  similar  dose  levels  (40  mg/kg  and  50  mg/kg,  however,  once  every 
second  week  in  patients  and  once  weekly  monkeys)  in  monkeys  and  patients.  As  exposure  in 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 42/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
monkeys increased more than dose proportionally exposure at the 200 mg/kg dose level in repeat-
dose toxicity studies is considered a sufficient safety margin. 
Tissue  distribution  in  heart,  quadriceps  and  triceps  after  one  single  administration  of  20  mg/kg 
avalglucosidase  and  alglucosidase,  respectively,  was  similar  for  both  molecules.  Essentially,  the 
amount of the total injected dose detected in the heart was ranged from 0.2-0.38% and from 0.03%-
0.05% in the quadriceps. The percentage detected in triceps ranged from 0.01-0.03%. Statistically 
significantly higher tissue levels of avalglucosidase as compared to alglucosidase were found in the 
heart at the 6- and 24-hour time points after administration. The biodistribution study showed the 
addition  of  bis-M6P  on  alglucosidase  alfa  structure  does  not  alter  the  biodistribution  pattern  of 
alglucosidase alfa, but increments the distribution to organs with higher CIMPR expression levels, as 
heart.  Therefore,  distribution  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  to  other  tissues  may  depend  on  their  CIMPR 
expression levels. Since biodistribution of 83% of the total injected dose of avalglucosidase alfa is 
characterized and no significant differences in target organs of toxicity were observed, biodistribution 
is considered sufficiently characterized.  
Non-clinical  data  reveal  no  special  hazard  for  humans  based  on  conventional  studies  of  repeated 
dose toxicity. Based on the nature of the product, the results of repeat-dose toxicity studies and an 
exploratory in vivo genotoxicity study in mice, as well as, clinical experience with a similar product 
(Myozyme), genotoxic and carcinogenic potential is not suspected for avalglucosidase alfa. 
Overall, avalglucosidase was well tolerated by mice and monkeys in pharmacology and repeat-dose 
toxicity studies employing doses of up to 120 mg/kg or 200 mg/kg, respectively. Unscheduled deaths 
that  occurred  in  mice  were  attributed  to  hypersensitivity  reactions  to  the  administered  human 
protein. Hypersensitivity reactions were in general well manageable by DHP administration. However, 
deaths  related  to  anti-drug  reactions  also  occurred  after  DPH  administration  had  started. 
Nevertheless, no causes of death other than immunologic responses were determined. Based on the 
coincidence with the avalglucosidase alfa administration (3 hours postdose), timing of death is most 
likely related to allergic reaction. Anti-drug antibodies were detected in all PD and toxicity studies. It 
was, however, not specified whether these anti-drug antibodies were of neutralizing character, which 
could have had an influence on the outcome of the PD and toxicity studies.  
Avalglucosidase alfa caused no adverse effects in a combined male and female fertility study in mice 
up to 50 mg/kg IV every  other day (9.4 times the human steady-state AUC  at the recommended 
biweekly dose of 20 mg/kg for patients with LOPD). 
In an embryo-fetal toxicity study in mice, administration of avalglucosidase at the highest dose of 
50 mg/kg/day  (17  times  the  human  steady-state  AUC  at  the  recommended  biweekly  dose  of  20 
mg/kg for patients with LOPD) produced increased postimplantation loss and mean number of late 
resorptions. No effects were seen at 20 mg/kg/day (4.8 times the human steady-state AUC at the 
recommended  biweekly  dose  of  20  mg/kg  for  patients  with  LOPD).  Avalglucosidase  alfa  does  not 
cross the placenta in mice, suggesting that the embryo-fetal effects at 50 mg/kg/day were related 
to maternal toxicity from the immunologic response. No malformations or developmental variations 
were observed.  
No  adverse  effects  were  observed  in  an  embryo-fetal  toxicity  study  in  rabbits  administered 
avalglucosidase  alfa  up  to  100 mg/kg/day  IV  (91  times  the  human  steady-state  AUC  at  the 
recommended biweekly dose of 20 mg/kg for patients with LOPD). 
There were no adverse effects in a pre- and postnatal developmental toxicity study in mice following 
administration of avalglucosidase alfa once every other day. The NOAEL for reproduction in the dams 
and for viability and growth in the offspring was 50 mg/kg every other day IV.

The proposed limits of analysed impurities (residual glycans and E11) were considered acceptable by 
the CHMP and in line with previous scientific advices. 
The  active  substance  is  a  natural  substance,  the  use  of  which  will  not  alter  the  concentration  or 
distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, avalglucosidase alfa is not expected to 
pose a risk to the environment. 
Assessment of paediatric data on non-clinical aspects 
A GLP-compliant juvenile toxicity study was conducted in CD1 mice (Study JUV0033) that received 
a total of 5 doses of 20, 50 or 100 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa every other week from postnatal day 
(PND) 21 through PND 77. A fertility cohort consisting of male animals was administered up to PND 
91. The recovery period ended on PND 111 or 112. Starting from the second dose, animals were also 
administered with 5 mg/kg DPH. 25 unscheduled deaths were reported, of which 21 were classified 
as related to avalglucosidase alfa administration. Although the causes of deaths were not elucidated, 
hypersensitivity  reaction  to  the  test  article  were  considered  as  causative  by  the  applicant.  Dead 
animals were evenly distributed among all dose groups, with slightly more deaths observed in the 
lowest dose group. A significant increase in total leucocytes and specifically lymphocytes, segmented 
neutrophils and basophils was detected in male animals of higher dose groups. No effects on other 
endpoints  evaluated  were  observed.  These  endpoints  included  clinical  observations,  body  weight, 
food  consumption,  macroscopic  and  microscopic  observations,  development,  sexual  maturation, 
male  and  female  reproductive  organs,  mating  and  fertility.  Toxicokinetic  evaluation  of  PND  77 
revealed a dose-dependent, disproportionate increase of avalglucosidase alfa serum levels. Over the 
entire dose range, Cmax was 5.88-fold higher in females and 5.11 fold higher in males. AUC0-24 
was 11.5 fold higher in females and 14.8 fold higher in males of the high dose group as compared 
to the lowest dose. Thus, also a gender difference in terms of exposure was observed. The presence 
of anti-avalglucosidase antibodies was determined on PND 48, 76 and 110/111 in 5 animals of each 
dosing group and each gender. Almost all animals that received avalglucosidase alfa had detectable 
anti-drug  antibodies  at  each  time  point  investigated.  The  NOAEL  of  100  mg/kg  once  every  other 
week  determined  in  the  juvenile  toxicity  study  corresponds  to  exposure  values  of  Cmax  of  3120 
µg/mL and AUC0-24 of 8140 µg▪h/mL in males; Cmax of 2480 µg/mL and AUC0-24 of 5400 µg▪h/mL 
in female. The highest dose tested in juvenile animals is not enough to discard a potential risk for 
IOPD patients at 40 mg/kg based on exposure margin and this has been reflected in the SmPC.   
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
Overall, the non-clinical aspects of avalglucosidase alfa have been adequately documented and meet 
the requirements to support this application.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
In  the  avalglucosidase  alfa  clinical  development  program  to  date,  the  PK  of 
avalglucosidase alfa has been characterized in 3 studies in LOPD patients and in 1 study 
in IOPD (see Table 7). A total of 123 adult and 23 paediatric patients were enrolled in 
the clinical studies.  
Pharmacokinetics was investigated in 75 avalglucosidase alfa treated LOPD patients from 
3 studies (TDR12857, LTS13769 and EFC14028), including only one paediatric patient, 
and  in  16  IOPD  patients,  all  enrolled  in  study  ACT14132.  In  addition,  a  population 
pharmacokinetic (PopPK) analysis was conducted using pooled data from the 3 studies 
in LOPD patients.  
Avalglucosidase  alfa  was  administered  by  IV  infusion  over  the  dose  range  of  5  to  20 
mg/kg  qow  in  LOPD  patients,  and  20  to  40  mg/kg  qow  in  IOPD  patients.  Infusion 
duration  was  dose-dependent  with  a  median  duration  of  4  hours  and  7  hours  at  20 
mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, respectively. 
Blood  sampling  schedules  were  implemented  in  all  clinical  studies  (up  to  48  hours  in 
TDR12857, 24 hours in LTS13769, 8 hours in EFC14028 and 12 hours in ACT14132) to 
allow for a non-compartmental analysis (NCA). 
Although NCA was used to assess the PK of avalglucosidase alfa in each individual study 
conducted in patients with LOPD, population PK modelling (PopPK analysis (POH0703)) 
was 
the  primary  approach 
to  describe 
the  absorption,  distribution  and 
elimination/excretion  profile  in  LOPD  patients  and  determine  the  effect  of  intrinsic 
(baseline  characteristics,  laboratory  parameters,  and  immunogenicity)  and  extrinsic 
(patients  previously  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa  versus  treatment-naïve  patients) 
factors on the PK of avalglucosidase alfa.

Table 2 Avalglucosidase alfa pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic 
assessments in clinical studies and analyses 
The pharmacological (PD) activity of avalglucosidase alfa was assessed during PAP and 
ETP  through  urinary  hexose  tetrasaccharides  (Hex4),  skeletal  muscle  magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI), glycogen content in quadriceps muscle tissue, serum creatine 
kinase (CK), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). The 
PD evaluations are summarized by study in Table 8.

Study TDR12857, as well as the primary analysis periods (PAPs) of studies EFC14028 
and ACT14132 have been completed. The extension study LTS13769 for patients from 
study TDR12857 and ETPs of ACT14132 and EFC14028 are ongoing, and PD results up 
to the cut-off date predefined for each study are also provided.

Absorption  
LOPD population 
Avalglucosidase  alfa  exposure  parameters  in  LOPD  patients  at  20  mg/kg  qow  are 
summarized in Table 9. After a 4-hour IV infusion of 20 mg qow, mean Cmax (CV%) 
and AUC2W were 273 μg/mL (24.2%) and 1220 μg.h/mL (28.6%), respectively.  
For patients previously treated with alglucosidase alfa at 20 mg/kg qow, no accumulation 
of  avalglucosidase  alfa  was  observed  following  5,  10  and  20  mg  qow.  This  finding  is 
consistent with the short t1/2z documented for avalglucosidase alfa. 
The PK parameters obtained from NCA are presented by clinical study in Table 10 and

IOPD population 
Avalglucosidase alfa exposure parameters in IOPD patients at 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg 
qow are summarized in Table 6. After a 4-hour IV infusion of 20 mg/kg, mean Cmax 
and AUC2W ranged from 175 to 189 μg/mL, and 805 to 923 μg.h/mL, respectively. After 
a 7-hour IV infusion of 40 mg/kg, avalglucosidase alfa exposure were in the same range 
in decliners and suboptimal responders with mean Cmax between 250 and 403 μg/mL 
and AUC2W from 1720 to 2630 μg.h/mL. 
Table 7 Avalglucosidase alfa exposures in IOPD patients at 20 mg/kg and 
40mg/kg qow (ACT14132) 
Following 20 and 40 mg/kg qow, Cmax and AUC2W appeared similar after single and 
repeated administrations indicating no accumulation of avalglucosidase alfa over time 
which is consistent with the short documented t1/2z. See Table 12.

LOPD population 
Avalglucosidase  alfa  PK  was  described  by  a  3-compartment  model  (POH0703).  The 
distribution volume of central compartment characterized the main kinetic phase while 
the 2 distribution volumes of concatenated peripheral compartments characterized the 
late kinetic phase. The late phase occurred at very low concentrations (ie, ≤0.05% the 
mean Cmax at 20 mg/kg qow) and had a negligible impact of the overall PK profile of 
avalglucosidase  alfa.  For  this  reason,  the  peripheral  compartment  volumes  of 
distribution  had  a  marginal  contribution  of  the  overall  distribution  volume  of 
avalglucosidase  alfa.  The  typical  population  PK  model  predicted  central  compartment 
volume of distribution of avalglucosidase alfa was 3.35 L. See Table 13. 
Table 8 Avalglucosidase alfa population PK parameter estimates from the final 
model in LOPD patients (P0H0703) 
IOPD population 
After avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg qow, mean steady state volume of 
distribution ranged between 3.5 and 5.4 L (see Table 10). 
Elimination 
No  specific  elimination  and  excretion  studies  were  conducted.  Avalglucosidase  alfa  is 
expected to be cleared from the plasma by cellular uptake. 
The  metabolic  pathway  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  has  not  been  characterized.  As  a 
glycoprotein,  avalglucosidase  alfa  is  expected  to  be  degraded  into  small  peptides  or 
amino acids via non-saturable catabolic pathways. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
LOPD population 
Following  5,  10  and  20  mg/kg  qow,  no  major  deviation  in  dose  proportionality  was 
observed  for  Cmax  and  AUC2W  (see  Table  14).  This  is  consistent  with  the  limited 
contribution of the non-linear clearance in the overall clearance of avalglucosidase alfa.

IOPD population 
Following  20  and  40  mg/kg  qow,  no  major  deviation  in  dose  proportionality  was 
observed for Cmax and AUC2W (see Table 10). 
Intra and inter-individual variability 
LOPD population 
In LOPD patients receiving 20 mg/kg qow, the total variability (CV%) of avalglucosidase 
alfa  based  on  individual  estimates  using  PopPK was  24.2%  and  28.6%  for  Cmax  and 
AUC2W,  respectively  (see  Absorption,  Table  5).  Based  on  PopPK  analysis  of 
avalglucosidase  alfa  in  LOPD  patients,  inter-patient  variability  in  avalglucosidase  alfa 
clearance, distribution volume of central compartment, Km, Vm and QPC was moderate 
to  large  (coefficient  of  variation  of  30.2%,  12.7%,  43.1%,  36.6%  and  234%, 
respectively).  The  residual  (intra-individual)  variability  was  small  with  a  coefficient  of 
variation of 12.5%. 
IOPD population 
In  IOPD  patients  receiving  20  and  40  mg/kg  qow,  the  total  variability  (CV%)  of 
avalglucosidase alfa, determined in a small number of patients per group (4 to 5), Cmax 
and AUC2W ranged from 18% to 43%, and from 15% to 38%, respectively (see Table 
10). 
Special populations 
Considering intrinsic factors such as renal and hepatic impairment, gender, weight, race 
and age, no major differences in terms of drug exposure could be observed. The PopPK 
analysis included 75 LOPD patients aged 16 to 78 years (with 1 patient <18 years of 
age and 16% of patients ≥65 years of age). Data are presented in Table 15.

Table 10 Avalglucosidase alfa exposure by age category at 20 mg/kg qow in 
the LOPD (P0H703) 
The  lack  of  further  studies  in  severe  and  renal  hepatic  impairment  is  considered 
acceptable by the CHMP since the main pathway of elimination of avalglucosidase alfa is 
catabolism. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No interaction studies have been performed. Because it is a recombinant human 
protein, avalglucosidase alfa is an unlikely candidate for cytochrome P450 mediated 
drug-drug interactions. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials 
See above. 
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Avalglucosidase alfa is a recombinant human acid α-glucosidase (rhGAA) that provides 
an exogenous source of GAA. Avalglucosidase alfa is a modification of alglucosidase alfa 
in which approximately 7 hexamannose structures each containing 2 terminal mannose-
6-phosphate  (bis-M6P)  moieties  are  conjugated  to  oxidized  sialic  acid  residues  on 
alglucosidase alfa. Avalglucosidase alfa has a 15-fold increase in mannose-6-phosphate 
(M6P) moieties compared with alglucosidase alfa. Binding to M6P receptors on the cell 
surface has been shown to occur via carbohydrate groups on the GAA molecule, after 
which it is internalised and transported into lysosomes, where it undergoes proteolytic 
cleavage that results in increased enzymatic activity.   
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
LOPD population 
In the Phase 1/2 TDR12857 study, urinary Hex4 was assessed on a bimonthly basis in 
LOPD patients after administration of avalglucosidase alfa at 5, 10 and 20 mg/kg qow 
for 25 weeks. As illustrated in Figure 4 for patients naïve to alglucosidase alfa treatment, 
decrease in urinary Hex4 was initiated within 2 weeks after the first avalglucosidase alfa 
administration (Week 3). At Week 25, mean decreases by 13.2% to 36% were observed 
in  naïve  patients  with  no  clear  relationship  to  dose  level.  The  greatest  reduction  was 
observed in the group of patients (10 mg/kg) with the highest baseline values (mean ± 
SD: 13.0 ± 4.75 mmol/mol versus 7.0 ± 3.92 and 5.4 ± 4.3 mmol/mol at 5 mg/kg and 
Nexviadyme

20  mg/kg,  respectively).  A  similar  response  was  documented  in  patients  previously 
treated with alglucosidase alfa with mean decreases of the same magnitude (7.5% to 
20.5%) and no evidence of dose response. In the long-term safety study LTS13769, the 
decrease in Hex4 levels was maintained with a same magnitude up to 6 years in patients 
treated with avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow. 
Figure 1 Mean (SD) urinary Hex4 over time after 5,10 and 20 mg/kg qow in 
LOPD patients naïve to alglucosidase alfa treatment (TDR12857) 
In the PAP of Phase 3 study EFC14028, urinary Hex4 was assessed on a quarterly basis 
in LOPD patients after administration of avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa at 20 
mg/kg qow for 49 weeks. In the extension treatment period (ETP), patients treated with 
alglucosidase alfa in the PAP switched to avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow with urinary 
Hex4 assessed on a quarterly basis for 6 months and then every 6 months. A slightly 
higher  mean  baseline  value  of  urinary  Hex4  was  observed  in the  avalglucosidase  alfa 
group (mean ± SD: 12.71 ± 10.10 mmol/mol) than in the alglucosidase alfa group (8.74 
±  5.04  mmol/mol)  but  median  values  were  similar  (8.55  mmol/mol  versus  7.30 
mmol/mol). Mean (SE) percentage changes from baseline in urinary Hex4 are illustrated 
for the PAP and ETP in Figure 5. In the PAP, a greater mean decrease in urinary Hex4 
was reported in patients treated with avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow than in patients 
treated with alglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow reaching -53.9% as compared to -10.8% 
at Week 49. In patients with available data up to Week 121 in the ETP, alglucosidase 
alfa patients switching to avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg qow reached within 6 months same 
levels of decrease in Hex4 as patients already treated with avalglucosidase alfa during 
PAP.

patients (primary analysis and extension treatment periods – EFC 14028) 
IOPD population 
In the PAP of Phase 2 ACT14132 study, urinary Hex4 was assessed on a bimonthly basis 
in IOPD patients after administration of avalglucosidase alfa at 20 and 40 mg/kg qow or 
alglucosidase alfa at previously received stable dose (range: 20 mg qow up to 40 mg/kg 
qw) for 25 weeks. In the ETP urinary Hex4 was assessed every 6 months. Of note, all 
patients had shown incomplete responses to alglucosidase alfa while receiving a stable 
dose for a minimum of 6 months immediately prior to study entry. Mean value of urinary 
Hex4 levels at baseline was higher in clinical decliners to alglucosidase alfa treated with 
avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow (80.25 mmol/mol) compared to clinical decliners and 
suboptimal responders to alglucosidase alfa treated with avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg 
qow  (63.43  and  54.81  mmol/mol,  respectively)  (Table  16).  In  suboptimal  responders 
treated with a stable alglucosidase alfa qow or qw dose, the mean value of urinary Hex4 
levels at baseline was 52.16 mmol/mol.

A  trend  for  greater  mean  decreases  were  observed  in  decliners  and  suboptimal 
responders  to  alglucosidase  alfa  treated  with  avalglucosidase  alfa  40  mg/kg  qow  as 
compared to decliners to alglucosidase alfa treated with avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg

At Week 25, the mean decrease ranged from 37% to 41% at 40 mg/kg qow as compared 
to 0.34% at 20 mg/kg qow. All patients treated with avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg qow 
showed decreases in Hex4 from baseline to Week 25 while decrease was less pronounced 
and  response  more  variable  at  20  mg/kg  qow.  Patients  treated  with  40  mg/kg  qow 
showed also a more pronounced and less variable decrease in urinary Hex4 as compared 
to clinical decliners treated with a stable dose of alglucosidase alfa (range: 20 mg qow 
up to 40 mg/kg qw).  
Decliners to alglucosidase alfa treated with avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow showed 
a similar response to that of suboptimal responders treated at a stable alglucosidase alfa 
dose  of  20  mg/kg  qow  to  40  mg/kg  qw  (ie,  including  higher  than  recommended 
dosages). This is consistent with a stabilization of the pathological process in muscles 
that is observed in IOPD patients previously treated with alglucosidase alfa. 
In  both  LOPD  and  IOPD  population,  no  results  considering  secondary  pharmacologic 
parameters were submitted. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A 3-compartment model with linear and non-linear Michaelis Menten kinetics was used 
to investigate the PK profile of avalglucosidase alfa. In a typical LOPD patient receiving 
avalglucosidase alfa qow, the PK is characterized by a linear plasma clearance of 0.869 
L/h, a half-life (associated to linear clearance) of 2.7 hours, and a distribution volume 
of the central compartment of 3.35 L. A shorter terminal half-life ranging between 1.34 
and 1.55 hour was documented with the NCA after avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow. 
Avalglucosidase alfa PK characterization was performed in patients with IOPD using NCA. 
Following avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg qow, mean steady state volume 
of distribution ranged from 3.5 to 5.4 L and mean plasma clearance from 0.526 to 0.696 
L/h. Mean t1/2z ranged from 0.60 to 1.19 h at 40 mg/kg.  
The  PK  data  obtained  from  patients  with  IOPD  and  LOPD  so  far  demonstrate  similar 
exposure  to  avalglucosidase  alfa  upon  repeated  injection  (no  accumulation). 
Pharmakokinetic dose-proportionality has been sufficiently examined (5, 10, 20 mg/kg 
in  LOPD,  and  20  and  40  mg/kg  in  IOPD)  and  also  PK  data  in  special  populations 
considering  renal/hepatic  impairment,  gender,  race,  weight  and  age  have  not  shown 
major differences. However, the population PK analysis did not include patients below 
16 years, mainly due to lack of recruitment in the LOPD studies. This is further discussed 
under 2.6.6. 
Inter-patient variability of Cmax and AUC2W ranged from 18% to 43%, and from 15% 
to 38%, which is probably linked to the small number of subjects investigated in these 
studies. During the procedure, direct comparison of PK data from both avalglucosidase 
and  alglucosidase  treated patients  were  requested  by  the  CHMP  to  conduct  a  reliable 
assessment regarding the exposure relevant for safety evaluation... In study ACT14132, 
no PK samples were collected in the IOPD patients treated with alglucosidase alfa (20 - 
40 mg/kg every week) and thus no direct comparison could be performed with patients 
treated  with  avalglucosidase  alfa  20  mg/kg  or  40  mg/kg  qow.  Therefore,  inter-study 
comparison  data  for  IOPD  patients  have  been  provided.  Exposure  levels  of 
avalglucosidase alfa (AVAL) and alglucosidase alfa (ALGLU) were found similar for both 
Nexviadyme

doses (20 and 40 mg/kg every week) indicating a similar PK profile of avalglucosidase 
and alglucosidase in LOPD patients. 
PD  biomarkers  of  Pompe  disease  used  in  these  studies  showed  the  ability  of 
avalglucosidase alfa to reduce the burden of glycogen accumulation (Hex4) and muscle 
damage (CK, ALT and AST) and support the pharmacological activity of avalglucosidase 
alfa in the intended population. In treatment-naïve LOPD patients aged 16 to 78, the 
mean  percentage  (SD)  change  in  urinary  hexose  tetrasaccharides  from  baseline  for 
patients  treated  with  Nexviadyme  20 mg/kg  every  other  week  and  alglucosidase  alfa 
20 mg/kg every other week was  -53.90% (24.03) and -10.8% (32.33), respectively, in 
week 49.  In  paediatric IOPD patients (<18 years of age) treated with Nexviadyme at 
40 mg/kg  every  other  week,  the  mean  percentage  (SD)  change  in  urinary  hexose 
tetrasaccharides 
from  baseline  was  -40.97%  (16.72)  and  -37.48%  (17.16), 
respectively, after 6 months. In patients previously declining treated with Nexviadyme 
at  20 mg/kg  every  other  week,  mean  (SD)  percentage  change  was  0.34%  (42.09). 
These results were considered clinically relevant and reported in the SmPC.  
Based on supporting data from study TDR12857 as well as experience from alglucosidase 
alfa, other ERT used in the same disease, a dose of 20 mg/kg qow was used in the Phase 
3  study  EFC14028  conducted  in  LOPD  patients,  which  is  justified.  Accordingly,  in  the 
phase 2 study ACT14132, which was conducted in IOPD patients, the dosing regimen 
was aligned to the 20 mg/kg qow. A higher dose of 40 mg/kg qow was also used mainly 
driven by an observation of current medical practice with Myozyme  without providing 
any further justification. According to literature, the measurement of urinary Glc4/Hex4 
levels represents a robust biomarker of disease burden, and additionally, a reduction of 
Hex4  concentrations  correlates  also  with  a  better  clinical  outcome.  Even  though  the 
effect is not statistically significant, the 40 mg/kg dose tested in IOPD patients showed 
a  sustained  and  less  variable  reduction  of  urinary  Hex4  levels  in  long  term  follow-up 
data observed during the ETP. However, the lack of statistical significance together with 
the  small  sample  size  (see  number  of  patients  investigated)  still  remains  a  strong 
limitation in the interpretation of these results. This is further discussed in section 2.6.6. 
Immunogenicity assay 
A  sufficiently  thorough  programme  was  conducted  to  establish  proper  qualification 
and/or  validation  of  the  immunogenicity  assays  employed  to  analyse  avalglucosidase 
alfa patient sera for anti-drug antibodies (ADA’s) and neutralising antibodies (NAb’s).  
Originally, ADA’s were assessed in the Phase 1/2 trial ( and its initial long-term extension 
(Study  LTS13769,  until  June  2016)  by  employing  a  qualified  enzyme  linked 
immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  .Positive  results  were  confirmed  by  a  separate  radio-
immunoprecipitation assay.Samples that were confirmed positive for ADA’s were then 
titered by employing the same qualified ELISA approach . To support the Phase 3 study 
EFC14028,  the  long-term  extension  study  LTS13769  (samples  obtained  after  June 
2016), and the IOPD Phase 2b study ACT14132, the previously developed ELISA format 
was updated to utilize a floating cut point and a drug competition confirmatory assay. A 
bridging  study  was  conducted  that  demonstrated  high  comparability  between  the 
original and the later ADA assays; concordance between the different approaches was 
97%.  
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 60/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Samples that were positive for ADA’s were subsequently evaluated for the NAb’s. This 
was accomplished by testing the inhibition of the catalytic activity of avalglucosidase alfa 
(by cleavage of the fluorophore 4-MU from the avalglucosidase alfa substrate 4-MU-α-
D-glucoside),  and  by  testing  the  inhibition  of  cellular  uptake  of  fluorophore-labelled 
avalglucosidase alfa in human fibroblasts. The enzymatic approach for analysing NAb’s 
was first qualified, and then validated. Cellular avalglucosidase alfa uptake was originally 
quantified by flow cytometry. This NAb assay was employed for analysing ADA-positive 
patient  sera  obtained  from  the  Phase  1/2  trial  TDR12857  and  its  initial  long-term 
extension (LTS13769, samples collected until June 2016). Because of the high variability 
that was observed with this first generation assay, cellular avalglucosidase alfa uptake 
and its inhibition by NAb’s in patient sera obtained from the phase 3 study EFC14028, 
the  long-term  extension  study  LTS13769  (after  June  2016),  and  the  IOPD  Phase  2b 
study ACT14132, was then analysed by a validated cellular imaging approach. Bridging 
between  these  two  cellular  uptake  approaches  was  conducted,  with  concordance 
established in 5 out of 6 historic NAb-positive patient sera.  
Furthermore, a method that allows to discriminate whether ADA’s specific to Myozyme 
also cross-react with avalglucosidase alfa was qualified. In this assay, ADA’s specific to 
Myozyme were at first depleted (by fixing Myozyme-specific ADA’s that had complexed 
biotinylated  Myozyme  to  streptavidin  magnetic  beads  and  then  selectively  removing 
these complexes; depletion was then tested in a previously validated ELISA to screen 
for  Myozyme-ADA’s).  Subsequently,  sera  were  tested 
for  ADA’s  specific  to 
avalglucosidase  alfa  by  employing  ELISA.  Finally,  an  assay  to  detect  symptom-driven 
IgE-ADA was validated.  
Overall, the qualifications and validations of the assays employed to analyse patient sera 
for avalglucosidase alfa ADA’s (IgM + IgG and, when symptom driven, IgE) and NAb’s 
are acceptable; no concerns were identified.  
The impact of immunogenicity and ADA development on the risk of Infusion Associated 
Reactions (IARs)/hypersensitivity is further discussed in 2.6.8.7. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the pharmacological profile of avalglucosidase alfa in human studies has been 
adequately documented and meet the requirements to support this application. 
2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The primary support for the efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa in the treatment of Pompe 
disease comes from the pivotal randomized phase 3 study EFC14028 comparing 
avalglucosidase alfa to alglucosidase alfa in treatment naïve LOPD patients. Additional 
evidence of efficacy comes from the phase 2 study ACT14132 in previously treated 
IOPD patient > 6 months. Phase 1/2 TDR12857 and LTS13769 studies provide 
supportive efficacy data on the long-term effect of avalglucosidase alfa.

2.6.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No formal dose-finding studies have been conducted. 
LOPD population 
The dose selected for the LOPD Phase 3 Study EFC14028 (20mg/kg) is based on results 
from the ascending-dose study TDR12857. This clinical study was intended to assess in 
man the safety and tolerability of AVAL, and characterize its PD and PK profiles following 
repeated-dose administrations. Additionally, the effect of AVAL on exploratory efficacy 
endpoints  was  assessed.  TDR12857  was  a  multicenter,  multinational,  open-label, 
ascending  dose,  repeated  every  other  week  (qow)  intravenous  (IV)  infusion  study  of 
AVAL (3 dose levels) in late-onset Pompe disease patients ≥18 years of age  naïve to 
treatment  (Group  1,  n=10)  or  previously  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa  ≥  9  months 
(Group  2,  n=14).  The  groups  were  initiated  simultaneously.  Eligible  patients  in  each 
group received an IV infusion of AVAL at doses of 5, 10, or 20 mg/kg of body weight 
every  other  week  (qow)  for  24  weeks.  AVAL  was  generally  safe  and  well tolerated  at 
dose levels of 5, 10, and 20 mg/kg in both treatment-naïve late-onset Pompe disease 
patients  (Group  1)  and  in  late-onset  Pompe  disease  patients  previously  treated  with 
alglucosidase alfa (Group 2) in this study. No deaths or life-threatening serious adverse 
events (SAEs) were reported. Six-minute walk test distances were generally stable or 
tended to increase with AVAL without relationship to patient group or dose level. There 
were  increases  across  all  Group  1  dose  levels  for  percentage  predicted  force  vital 
capacity  (FVC),  MEP  (maximum  expiratory  pressure),  and  maximum  inspiratory 
pressure (MIP) at Week 25 relative to baseline, with the exception of the 5 mg/kg dose 
group  where  FVC  values  remained  stable.  In  Group  2,  FVC,  MEP,  and  MIP  either 
remained  stable  or  displayed  small  increases,  with  no  clear  dose-relationship.  Across 
both groups, patients remained stable or demonstrated improvements via a number of 
functional assessments. Improvements in scores were observed for both groups in the 
QMFT  and  HHD  evaluations  without  relationship  to  patient  group  or  dose  level; 
decreased  general  and  cognitive  fatigue  was  observed  at  20  mg/kg  AVAL  in  Group  1 
patients. The GSGC and GMFM-88 assessments showed minimal changes for both groups 
and all dose levels.

IOPD population 
The proposed dose of 40 mg/kg in IOPD patients is based on the results from the 
paediatric Phase 2 study ACT14132 (Mini-COMET) and recent publications of clinical 
experience in IOPD patients receiving alglucosidase alfa doses greater or at higher 
frequency than the label dose of 20 mg/kg qow (Chien, 2015, J Pediatr; Case, 2015, 
Neuromusc Disord). Literature generally indicates good tolerance and safety 
experience of alternate dosing regimen.  
Study ACT14132 is a multistage (stage 1: declining patients, stage 2: insufficient 
clinical response) phase 2 open-label, ascending dose (20 or 40 mg/kg qow) cohort 
study. The patient must have a documented GAA deficiency, age <18 years, 
cardiomyopathy at the time of Pompe disease diagnosis, and having received a stable 
dose of alglucosidase alfa regularly for a minimum of 6 months immediately prior to 
study entry, with documented evidence of clinical decline (Stage 1) or suboptimal 
clinical response (Stage 2).  
All patients were treated for 25 weeks during the PAP, thereafter, all patients had the 
option to receive long term treatment with avalglucosidase alfa in an ETP at a dose of 
20 mg/kg qow (Cohort 1) or 40 mg/kg qow (Cohorts 2 and 3). While stage 1 can be 
considered as a limited dose-finding study for patients with severe forms of IOPD, the 
second stage allowed a direct treatment comparison of the highest acceptable dose of 
AVAL (40 mg/kg qow, based on data from cohorts 1 & 2) and alglucosidase alfa at the 
at the current stable dose in patients with advanced disease.  
During the PAP, GMFM-88 mean scores increased modestly from baseline to Week 25 
in all 4 treatment groups. Of note, the highest increase was seen in Cohort 3, the 
alglucosidase alfa group. According to the Applicant, this may be attributed to younger 
patient age and a smaller proportion of subjects within the group with suboptimal 
motor response at baseline. Consistently with the results of the Gross Motor Function 
Measure-88, the greatest degree of change in the QMFT – total score was observed in 
the alglucosidase alfa group. All patients remained within the normal ranges or 
improved their left ventricular mass (LVM) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) 
echocardiography Z-scores. A trend for improvement of the eyelid position 
measurement could potentially be observed in the 40 mg/kg qow avalglucosidase alfa 
groups as compared to the 20 mg/kg qow or alglucosidase alfa groups, which showed 
stabilization or decline in the measurements. Pulmonary function tests were performed 
only in few patients able to reliably undergo testing, and no trends were observed for 
the patients with available data.

2.6.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
EFC14028/COMET 
The study design is represented in Figure 7. 
Study EFC14028 is a Phase 3, multicenter, multinational, randomized, double blinded 
study comparing the efficacy and safety of avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa 
(Myozyme/Lumizyme, both 20 mg/kg qow) in treatment-naïve patients aged 3 years or 
older with late onset Pompe disease (LOPD).  
The  study  includes  two  main  periods:  a  blinded  treatment  period  (primary  analysis 
period  [PAP])  and  an  open-label  avalglucosidase  alfa  long-term  follow  up  phase 
(extension treatment period [ETP]). Patients in the alglucosidase alfa arm were switched 
to avalglucosidase alfa treatment at the end of the PAP. Patients remained blinded to 
the  randomized  treatment  until  after  database  was  locked  and  the  primary  analysis 
completed.  Randomization  in  a  1:1  ratio  employed  stratification  factors  based  on 
baseline FVC, gender, age, and country (Japan or ex-Japan).

Methods 
•  Study Participants  
A total of 100 patients were randomized; 51 patients received AVAL, 49 patients 
received ALGLU. All eligible patients had a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe’s disease 
(GAA deficiency and/or two GAA gene mutations), were 3 years of age or older, able to

walk 40 m on the 6-minute walk test without stopping and without an assistive device 
and had a % predicted FVC within the range of 30% to less than 85% in the upright 
position. Patients were excluded if they required any invasive ventilation or if they had 
previous treatment with alglucosidase alfa or any investigational therapy for Pompe 
disease. 
Main inclusion criteria 
The patient must have signed informed consent prior to performing any study-related 
procedures. If the patient was legally minor, signed written consent was obtained from 
parent(s)/legal guardian and assent obtained from patients, if applicable. 
The patient must have had confirmed GAA enzyme deficiency from any tissue source 
and/or 2 confirmed GAA gene mutations. 
Main exclusion criteria 
Patient was/had: <3 years of age, Pompe-specific cardiac hypertrophy, wheelchair 
dependent, not able to ambulate 40 meters without stopping and without an assistive 
device, invasive ventilation, not able to successfully perform repeated FVC 
measurements in upright position of ≥30% predicted and ≤85% predicted, previous 
treatment with alglucosidase alfa or any investigational therapy for Pompe disease, 
pregnant or breast feeding. 
•  Treatments 
Route of administration: Intravenous (IV) 
Dose regimen: 20 mg/kg once every 2 weeks (qow) for both treatment groups 
(avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa). 
•  Objectives 
The primary objective of study EFC14028 was to determine the effect of 
avalglucosidase alfa treatment on respiratory muscle strength as measured by forced 
vital capacity (FVC)% predicted in the upright position, as compared to alglucosidase 
alfa.  
The primary statistical objective was to test the non-inferiority (NI) of avalglucosidase 
alfa versus alglucosidase alfa at 5% level of significance. The non-inferiority (NI) of 
avalglucosidase alfa to alglucosidase alfa was to be investigated first before 
progressing to investigation of superiority. 
Secondary objectives were to determine the safety and effect of avalglucosidase alfa 
treatment on functional endurance (6MWT), inspiratory muscle strength (MIP), 
expiratory muscle strength (MEP), lower extremity muscle strength (HHD), motor 
function (QMFT), and health related quality of life (SF-12). Other objectives were to 
determine the PK, exploratory PD, pharmacogenetics and effect of avalglucosidase alfa 
treatment on motor function (GMFM-88 and GSGC), upper extremity muscle strength 
(HHD), health related quality of life (EQ-5D-5L and PedsQL Generic Core Scale), and 
patient-reported outcomes (PDSS/PDIS, R-PAct, and PGIC).

Core Scale) 
•  Patient reported outcomes (PDSS/PDIS, R-PAct, and PGIC) 
•  Sample size 
Sample  size  calculations  were  based  on  non-inferiority  test  of  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint of change from baseline to Week 49 in FVC (% predicted) upright position, with 
the  following  assumptions:  primary  endpoint  is  normally  distributed  with  a  common 
standard deviation (SD) of 5.1% predicted, which is estimated based on the data from 
previous  Phase  3,  placebo-controlled  LOTS  trial  (AGLU02704);  mean  treatment 
difference (avalglucosidase alfa–alglucosidase alfa) of 2.0% predicted, assumed based 
on a conservative estimate when comparing studies AGLU02704 and TDR12857; a 2-
sided 5% significance level; expected percent of missing data of up to 10% (estimated 
based  on  studies  AGLU02704  and  EMBASSY),  a  non-inferiority  margin  of  1.1% 
predicted, which is based on the estimated alglucosidase alfa effect from the placebo-
controlled study AGLU02704.  
A  total  sample  size  of  96  (1:1  randomization  ratio)  will  provide  approximately  80% 
power to demonstrate non-inferiority of avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa, 
when  the  true  treatment  difference  (avalglucosidase  alfa–alglucosidase  alfa)  is  2.0% 
predicted. If the non-inferiority criterion is met, a test for superiority will be performed. 
If  the  true  difference  between  avalglucosidase  alfa  and  alglucosidase  alfa  is  3.6% 
predicted,  the  study  will  have  more  than  85%  power  to  demonstrate  superiority  of 
avalglucosidase alfa to alglucosidase alfa. 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
Randomisation and treatment allocation are described in a standard manner in the trial 
protocol in sufficient detail. No concern regarding potential bias arises from those 
descriptions. Treatment assignment and randomization was planned to be performed 
using a centralized treatment allocation system/IRT. During the double-blind period, 
approximately 96 patients were to be randomly assigned across sites to 1 of 2 
treatment arms, avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa at 20 mg/kg qow in a 1:1 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 66/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
ratio. Randomization was planned to be performed within each of the following 6 
strata: Age <18; Age ≥18, all genders and FVC (% predicted), Japan; Age ≥18, male 
and FVC (% predicted) <55%, ex-Japan; Age ≥18, female and FVC (% predicted) 
<55%, ex-Japan; Age ≥18, male and FVC (% predicted) ≥55%, ex-Japan and Age ≥18, 
female and FVC (% predicted) ≥55%, ex-Japan. 
To control the number of patients with high baseline FVC (% predicted), the percent of 
enrolled patients with baseline FVC (% predicted) of 80% to 85% was planned to be 
capped at 15% of the total population. The Interactive Response Technology or IRT 
(centralized treatment allocation system) was to generate the patient randomisation 
list and to allocate the treatment number and the corresponding treatment kits to the 
patients accordingly. Investigator and assigned study site personnel were planned to 
have access to blinded IRT menu/reports, whereas the unblinded pharmacist or 
unblinded designee were planned to have access to unblinded reports. The treatment 
kits were to be allocated using the IRT every 2 weeks starting at Visit 2 (Day 1/Day 2). 
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
Modified intent-to-treat population 
The mITT population was planned to include randomized patients who receive at least 
1 infusion (partial or total). The mITT population were to be used for all efficacy 
analyses unless otherwise specified.  Analyses using the mITT population were to be 
performed according to the treatment arm allocated by randomization, regardless of 
the actual treatment received. 
Per-protocol population 
The PP population was planned to consist of mITT patients who met all of the following 
criteria: 
- 
Meet all of the inclusion and exclusion criteria (See protocol Section 
7.1 and 7.2), 
- 
- 
- 
Received at least 80% of planned # of doses, 
Had a valid FVC (% predicted) assessment at Week 49, 
No major protocol deviations that potentially impacting on primary 
study objective. 
The following criteria have been identified a priori as major deviations that will 
potentially impact on primary study objective. Additional major deviations could be 
identified during the study. These were planned to be reviewed and approved by 
sponsor prior to database lock and unblinding of treatment assignment. 
- 
- 
Patient receives doses 2 times higher than the protocol planned dose, 
Patient receives treatment different from the randomized assignment 
during the PAP, 
- 
The treatment assignment is unblinded before the planned unblinding 
(completion of  PAP) not due to safety reasons specified in the 
protocol.

The reason for excluding patients from the PP population were planned to be 
summarized by randomized treatment group and presented in data listing. PP 
population was planned to be used for sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy 
endpoint in PAP only. 
Safety population 
The safety population was to be analyzed according to treatment received. In PAP, 
safety population was supposed to include randomized patients who receive at least 1 
infusion in PAP. In ETP, safety population was supposed to include patients who 
receive at least 1 infusion in ETP, and was also supposed to include paediatric patients 
who were directly enrolled to ETP. Overall safety of avalglucosidase alfa was planned 
to be based on patients who receive at least 1 infusion during either PAP or ETP. 
Additional analysis populations 
- 
- 
- 
- 
The ETP population was planned to consist of patients who receive at least one 
avalglucosidase alfa dose during the ETP. 
The pharmacokinetic population was planned to consist of patients from safety 
population in PAP who have evaluable drug concentration data. 
The pharmacodynamics or pharmacogenetic analysis population for the 
parameter of interest were planned to consist of mITT patients having 
evaluable pharmacodynamic data for the parameter of interest. 
The ADA evaluable population was planned to consist of patients from safety 
population who had at least one ADA sample taken post-baseline after drug 
administration that was appropriate for ADA testing with a reportable result. 
Patients with missing or non-reportable baseline samples and reportable post-
baseline samples were planned to be considered as evaluable. 
Analysis methods 
Standard descriptive statistical anaylses were planned and carried out for patient 
demographics, baseline characteristics, medicinal product exposure and compliance as 
well as for use of concomitant medications. Analyses were planned by study treatment 
arm. Summary statistics for continuous variables were planned to minimally include n, 
mean, SD, minimum, median, and maximum. For categorical variables, frequencies 
and percentages were to be presented. Graphical displays were planned to be provided 
as appropriate. Where considered meaningful, separate descriptions were planned to 
be provided for PAP and ETP. 
Efficacy analysis 
All efficacy endpoints were planned to be summarized descriptively at each study visit, 
as well as the last observation available during the PAP. All efficacy analyses were 
planned to be performed based on the mITT population. Corresponding analysis were 
to be performed in the PP population for the primary efficacy endpoint for sensitivity 
purposes. 
A sequential test strategy for the primary efficacy endpoint and key secondary 
endpoints was implemented to control Type 1 error rate at 5% in a strong sense. 
Testing was planned to proceed according to the following order and was planned to be 
stopped once there was a non-significant result: 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report

1. The primary efficacy endpoint of FVC (% predicted) was to be tested for NI of 
avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa first. 
2. If NI was demonstrated, the superiority of the avalglucosidase alfa versus 
alglucosidase alfa in FVC (% predicted) was planned to be tested with the same overall 
5% significance level. 
3. If the superiority of avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa was demonstrated 
on the primary efficacy endpoint, the hypothesis testing for the following secondary 
efficacy endpoints was planned to proceed according to the following order: 
a) Change from baseline to Week 49 in total distance walked in 6MWT (a superiority 
test with a two-sided alpha of 0.05), 
b) Change from baseline to Week 49 in % predicted of MIP (a superiority test with a 
two-sided alpha of 0.05), 
c) Change from baseline to Week 49 in % predicted of MEP (a superiority test with a 
two-sided alpha of 0.05), 
d) Change from baseline to Week 49 in summary score of lower extremity strength by 
HHD (a superiority test with a two-sided alpha of 0.05). 
The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in FVC (% predicted) in upright 
position to Week 49 was planned and analyzed in the mITT population using a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) with change from baseline as outcome variable. 
The  MMRM  included  the  baseline  FVC  (%  predicted)  and  age  (both  as  continuous 
variables),  gender  (male,  female),  treatment  group,  visit,  and  treatment-by-visit 
interaction as fixed effects. The model was fitted using restricted maximum likelihood. 
The difference between treatment groups was planned to be estimated based on least 
square (LS) means at the Week 49 visit within the mixed model for repeated measures 
(MMRM) model. A 2-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) using the estimate and variance 
of the LS mean difference was to be provided. If the lower bound of the 2-sided 95% CI 
for the difference of avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa was found to be larger 
than -1.1, the study was to be considered to have met its primary objective. 
Each of the secondary endpoints were planned to be analyzed based on the MMRM 
model, similar to that described for the primary endpoint, using the mITT population 
(with the exception of SF-12, which was planned to be analyzed for a subset of mITT 
patients with age ≥18 years). The difference between treatment groups was to be 
assessed with Least squares (LS) mean difference at Week 49 estimated within the 
framework of the corresponding MMRM model. P-values and 2-sided 95% CIs were 
planned to be provided. 
According to a very detailed plan presented in the SAP, several sensitivity analyses 
were planned to be conducted to assess the robustness of the primary efficacy analysis 
results with regards to missing data. This included a tipping point analysis and further 
analyses performed to address potential deviation from certain planning assumptions. 
Wilcoxon-Mann Whitney test, Linear Mixed Effects Model, and covariate-adjustment 
regression models were planned to be used for this purpose. In addition, responder 
analyses, analyses of changes in respiratory support, and correlation analyses between 
FVC (% predicted) change and other efficacy parameters were planned to be carried 
out. 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report

Subgroup analyses for the primary efficacy endpoint of FVC % predicted and key 
secondary efficacy endpoint 6MWT were planned to be performed. Those were planned 
to include age group (<18 years, ≥18 years but <45 years, and ≥45 years old), gender, 
baseline FVC groups (<55%, and ≥55%), race, and ethnicity. Due to the limited power 
in these subpopulations, treatment difference within the subgroups expected to be 
difficult to interpret. Therefore, the focus of this analysis was planned on assessment 
of interaction between subgroup covariate and the treatment. If the p-value for the 
interaction term was found to be less than 0.1, nature of interaction was planned to be 
explored. 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints were to be summarized descriptively and analyzed using 
a similar method as used for the primary efficacy endpoint. These analyses were 
planned in the mITT population. 
Two further analyses were planned to evaluate the effect of avalglucosidase alfa in 
treatment experienced patients. One of them was a piecewise linear mixed effect 
model for % FVC (predicted) and 6MWT to be fitted for all patients who switched from 
alglucosidase alfa in PAP to avalglucosidase alfa in ETP. The other analysis was 
supposed to be conducted in % FVC (predicted) comparing the value from Week 49 to 
Week 97, by using a within-patient test in the treatment group who switched from 
alglucosidase alfa in PAP to avalglucosidase alfa in ETP. The change in % FVC 
(predicted) from Week 49 to Week 97 and the associated 95% CI were to be 
calculated from the MMRM with fixed term for visit and random term for subject. This 
MMRM analysis was planned to be based on % FVC (predicted) data from Week 49 and 
subsequent visits in ETP. 
Safety analysis 
The analysis of the safety variables was planned to be essentially descriptive and no 
inferential testing was planned. All safety analyses were planned to be performed on 
the safety population, unless otherwise specified, using the following common rules: 
-  The baseline value is the last available value before the start of first infusion in PAP 
or ETP, except possibly ECG parameters.  
-  The potentially clinically significant abnormality (PCSA) values are defined as 
abnormal values considered medically important by the Sponsor according to 
predefined criteria/thresholds based on literature review and defined by the 
Sponsor for clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, and ECG. 
o  PCSA criteria will determine which patients had at least 1 PCSA during 
the treatment epoch, taking into account all evaluations performed during 
the period, including non-scheduled or repeated evaluations. 
o  The number of all such patients will be the numerator for the on-
treatment PCSA percentage; the denominator will be the number of 
patients assessed for that given parameter in the treatment epoch in the 
safety population. 
In PAP analysis, the safety analyses were planned to be carried out with patients by 
the actual treatment received, irrespective of the treatment the patient has been 
randomized to. In ETP analysis and overall evaluation of avalglucosidase alfa safety, 
the safety analyses were planned to be carried out by the following 4 groups: 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 70/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
-  Group 1 included data in PAP and ETP among subjects who received 
avalglucosidase alfa in PAP and ETP, 
-  Group 2 included data in ETP among subjects who received alglucosidase alfa in 
PAP and received avalglucosidase alfa in ETP, 
-  Group 3 included data in PAP and/or EPT among subjects who received 
avalglucosidase alfa in that period, 
-  Group 4 included data in PAP and/or EPT among paediatric subjects who received 
avalglucosidase alfa in that period. 
Results 
•  Participant flow 
A total of 100 patients with LOPD were randomized and were exposed to 
investigational medicinal product (IMP): 51 patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group 
and 49 patients in the alglucosidase alfa group. 95 patients overall, 51 (100%) in the 
avalglucosidase alfa group and 44 (89.8%) in the alglucosidase alfa group, completed 
the PAP. See Table 17. 
All 95 patients entered the ETP. There were 5 (5.0%) and 4 (4.0%) premature 
discontinuations in respective PAP and ETP periods of the study and 91 patients were 
continuing in the study at the time of the data cut-off. Treatment discontinuation was 
due to AEs in the majority of cases (see also safety section); two patients withdrew 
consent due to other reasons. Overall, the drop-out rate is low and does not affect the 
validity of results. 
Table 12. Participants flow 
•  Recruitment 
The study started in November 2016 and is ongoing. 
•  Conduct of the study 
Three (5.9%) patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 2 (4.1%) patients in the 
alglucosidase alfa group reported protocol deviations. In the ETP, 12 patients missed a 
total of 13 infusions due to site access restrictions related to the COVID-19 pandemic. 
No patient missed any infusion in the PAP for that reason. None of the deviations led 
to the exclusion of patients from the per protocol (PP) population.

Eighteen (35.3%) patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 19 (38.8%) patients 
in the alglucosidase alfa group reported other major or critical protocol deviations. The 
most common was study procedure performed against protocol instructions (12 
[23.5%] patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 11 (22.4%) patients in the 
alglucosidase alfa group) and failure to report adverse event (AE)/adverse event of 
special interest (AESI)/SAE/pregnancy/overdose to Sponsor within the protocol-
specified time window (3 [5.9%] patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 6 
[12.2%] patients in the alglucosidase alfa group). Patient safety and data integrity was 
not affected by the deviations in this study. 
The blind was broken for 1 patient in the alglucosidase alfa group for regulatory 
purposes (due to the reporting of an unexpected serious adverse reaction suspected 
by the Investigator to be related to study treatment, cerebral artery thrombosis later 
updated to acute myocardial infarction based on final autopsy report. Accidental 
unblinding have also occurred in 2 other patients.

Other Secondary Endpoints 
•  Maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP) and maximum expiratory 
pressure (MEP) 
The LS mean (SE) changes from baseline in % predicted MIP was stable by Week 49 in 
both avalglucosidase alfa (-0.29% [3.84%]) and alglucosidase alfa (-2.87% [4.04%]) 
arms, with no clear treatment difference at any time point evaluated . Percent 
predicted MEP improved over baseline in both treatment arms, showing no treatment 
difference at Week 49 (avalglucosidase alfa, 2.39% ±4.00%; alglucosidase alfa, 
5.00% ± 4.20%) 
Following repeated queries and database lock, supraphysiologic baseline MIP and MEP 
values of 200 cmH2O or more were identified for 4 patients. As the anomalous values 
are not plausible in patients with Pompe disease, and likely due to errors in data entry, 
post hoc sensitivity analyses excluding these 4 patients were conducted for MIP and 
MEP. An LS mean increase (SE) of 8.70% (2.09) in MIP (LS mean difference +4.40% 
[95% CI: -1.63, 10.44]) was observed, confirming the benefit of avalglucosidase alfa 
20 mg/kg qow on respiratory function. Similarly, an LS mean increase (SE) of 10.89% 
(2.84) in MEP (LS mean difference +2.51% [95% CI: -5.70, 10.73]) was observed, 
confirming the benefit of avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow on MEP as well as MIP. 
Observed mean changes in MIP and MEP excluding patients with implausible baseline 
values are shown by treatment in Figure 9 and Figure 10, below.

•  Measurements of lower extremity muscle strength 
HHD composite scores for lower extremity muscle strength increased over baseline 
scores in both avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa treatment groups. See Figure 
11. 
The LS mean change (SE) in HHD (lower extremity muscle strength) (composite score) 
from baseline to Week 49 was 260.69 (46.07) in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 
153.72 (48.54) in the alglucosidase alfa group; the difference was 106.97 (95% CI: -
26.56, 240.50). Mean plots over time to Week 49 showed a numerically higher 
treatment response with avalglucosidase alfa as compared with alglucosdidase alfa in 
changes from baseline in composite scores and summary scores (% predicted) of 
muscle strength. In those patients who had reached Week 97 at time of the data cut-
off (19 March 2020), patients whose treatment switched from alglucosidase alfa to 
avalglucosidase alfa after Week 49 further improved HHD scores. Whereas patients 
treated continuously with avalglucosidase alfa showed higher variability, with lower 
mean scores observed in patients who had assessments at Week 97 by the cut-off 
date.

Study ACT14132/Mini-COMET 
The study design is represented in Figure 14. ACT14132 is a multistage (stage 1: 
declining patients, stage 2: insufficient clinical response) phase 2 open-label, 
ascending dose (20 or 40 mg/kg qow) cohort study with long-term open label 
extension treatment period (ETP) at a dose of 20 mg/kg qow (Cohort 1) or 40 mg/kg 
qow (Cohorts 2 and 3).

Methods 
•  Study Participants 
Ten centers screened and enrolled at least 1 patient. Centers were from 5 geographic 
locations worldwide: France (2); Japan (2); Taiwan (1); United Kingdom (2); and 
United States (3). The patient must have had a documented GAA deficiency and 
cardiomyopathy at the time of Pompe disease diagnosis, aged <18 years, had been 
receiving a stable dose of alglucosidase alfa regularly for a minimum of 6 months 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report

immediately prior to study entry, and had documented evidence of clinical decline 
(Stage 1) or suboptimal clinical response (Stage 2). 
Main inclusion criteria 
The patient must have signed informed consent prior to performing any study-related 
procedures. If the patient was legally minor, signed written consent was obtained from 
parent(s)/legal guardian and assent obtained from patients, if applicable. 
For patients participating in Stage 1: Clinical Decliners Dose Cohort 1 & 2 
The patient had evidence of clinical decline in at least 1 parameter related to Pompe 
Disease and NOT related to intercurrent illness as assessed by the Investigator: 
Respiratory Function, Motor Skills or Cardiac Parameters 
For patients participating in Stage 2: Suboptimal Responders Dose Cohort 3 
The patient had evidence of suboptimal clinical response in at least 1 of the following 
parameters related to Pompe Disease and NOT related to intercurrent illness as 
assessed by the Investigator: Respiratory Function, Motor Skills or New onset of 
ptosis. 
Main exclusion criteria 
Patient had/was: high antibody titer (anti-alglucosidase alfa antibody titer ≥1:25600) at 
2 consecutive time points not less than 1 month apart, participating in another clinical 
study or had taken other investigational drugs within 30 days or 5 elimination half-lives 
of the investigational drugs from screening or randomization, whichever is longer, high 
risk for a severe allergic reaction to avalglucosidase alfa (ie, previous moderate to severe 
anaphylactic reaction to alglucosidase alfa and/or patient had immunoglobulin E (IgE) 
antibodies to  alglucosidase  alfa,  and/or  a history  of  high  sustained immunoglobulin  G 
(IgG) antibody titers to alglucosidase alfa), pregnant or breast feeding. 
•  Treatments 
Avalglucosidase alfa was administered as an intravenous infusion at a dose of 20 mg/kg 
qow  (Cohort  1  patients)  or  40  mg/kg  qow  (Cohort  2  patients  and  Cohort  3  patients 
randomized to avalglucosidase alfa) for 25 weeks. Alglucosidase alfa was administered 
to Cohort 3 patients randomized to alglucosidase alfa for 25 weeks at their current stable 
dose (defined by dose of alglucosidase alfa administered regularly for a minimum of 6 
months immediately prior to study entry. These doses were 20 mg/kg qow (1 patient), 
40 mg/kg qow (2 patients), 20 mg/kg qw (1 patient), 30 mg/kg qw (1 patient) and 40 
mg/kg  qw  (1  patient)).  Of  note,  only  1  Cohort  3  patient  randomized  to  alglucosidase 
alfa  received  the  label  dose  of  20  mg/kg  qow  according  to  SmPC  of  Myozyme  (INN: 
alglucosidase alfa).  
After completing the PAP, all patients had the option to receive long-term treatment with 
avalglucosidase  alfa  in  the  ETP.  Cohort  2  and  3  patients  continued  to  receive 
avalglucosidase alfa at 40 mg/kg qow, including those Cohort 3 patients who received 
alglucosidase  alfa  treatment  during  the  PAP.  Cohort  1  patients  continued  to  receive 
avalglucosidase alfa at 20 mg/kg qow unless they experienced further clinical decline at 
or after Week 25 when compared to prior to enrollment in ACT14132, and as defined by 
more  rapid  worsening  of  criteria  of  clinical  decline,  which  was  sustained  on  repeated 
study assessments. In this case, the patient could be managed per the discretion of the 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 86/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Investigator,  which  could  include  return  to  treatment  with  commercially  available 
alglucosidase  alfa  (and  termination  of  trial  participation)  or 
increasing  the 
avalglucosidase alfa dose to 40 mg/kg qow. 
At time of data cut for the present analysis, 2 Cohort 1 patients had been switched to 
40 mg/kg qow at Weeks 55 and 61, respectively. 
•  Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  study  ACT14132  was  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of 
avalglucosidase  alfa  in  patients  with  infantile-onset  Pompe  disease  (IOPD)  previously 
treated with alglucosidase alfa. 
Secondary  objectives  were 
to  characterize 
the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of 
avalglucosidase alfa and to evaluate the preliminary efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa in 
comparison to alglucosidase alfa. 
Additional objectives were to determine exploratory PD, pharmacogenetics and effect of 
avalglucosidase  alfa  treatment  on  functional  endurance,  respiratory  function,  health 
related quality of life (HRQOL), pain, developmental disability, and hearing in patients 
with IOPD.

•  Sample size 
No formal sample size calculations have been performed. Sample size for this study was 
based upon empirical considerations. 
•  Randomisation and blinding (masking) 
Patients who complied with all inclusion/exclusion criteria were enrolled in the study on 
a  competitive  basis.  Depending  upon  the  dose  escalation  status  at  the  time  of 
enrollment, patients were assigned to Cohort 1, Cohort 2, or Cohort 3. The site accessed 
the IRT system to obtain a treatment assignment and patient number. Only patients in 
Cohort 3 were randomized to receive either avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa, 
using IRT. The trial protocol foresaw the option to implement a matched pairs design if 
8 or more eligible patients are enrolled at the same time. If less than 8 patients were 
eligible at the beginning of the enrollment for Cohort 3, a stratified randomization design 
was planned to be used stratifying on gender. The actual randomization within Cohort 3 
was obviously not following the optional matching strategy. Stratified randomisation by 
gender  was  eventually  applied.  Treatment  condition  was  not  blinded  at  the  site  level 
from an operation perspective. Nonetheless, some measures were taken to reduce bias 
for some observations where feasible, such as the central reading of echocardiograms 
in  a  blinded  manner  and  the  testing  of  laboratory  parameters,  with  the  exception  of 
pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity measurements. 
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis populations 
The safety population was planned to be the primary population for Stage 1 and the 
overall study safety analysis. The safety population was to include patients who 
receive at least 1 infusion (partial or total). The safety population was to be analyzed 
according to treatment received. Overall safety of avalglucosidase alfa was planned to 
be based on patients who receive at least 1 infusion during either PAP or ETP. For 
Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, patients for whom it is unclear whether IMP was administered 
were to be included in the safety population. For cohort 3, randomized patients for 
whom it is unclear whether they took the IMP were to be included in the safety 
population as randomized. 
The modified intent-to-treat (mITT) population was defined as all randomized patients 
in Cohort 3 who received at least 1 infusion and with evaluable baseline efficacy 
assessment. Patients were planned to be analyzed in the treatment group to which 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 88/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
they are randomized. The mITT population was planned as the primary population for 
Cohort 3 (Stage 2) efficacy analysis. 
The PK population was planned to consist of patients from the safety population in PAP 
who have evaluable drug concentration data. PK analysis for Cohort 3 patients who 
switch to avalglucosidase alfa during the ETP were to be reported in the final CSR. 
For Cohort 1 and Cohort 2, the PD or pharmacogenetic analysis populations for the 
parameter of interest were planned to consist of safety patients who have evaluable 
PD or pharmacogenetic data for the parameter of interest. For Cohort 3, the PD or 
pharmacogenetic analysis population for the parameter of interest were planned to 
consist of mITT patients who have evaluable PD or pharmacogenetic data for the 
parameter of interest. 
The ADA evaluable population was planned to consist of patients from safety 
population who had at least one ADA sample taken post-baseline after drug 
administration that was appropriate for ADA testing with a reportable result. Patients 
with missing or non-reportable baseline samples and reportable post-baseline samples 
were planned to be considered as evaluable. 
In general, all summary statistics were to be computed and displayed by study cohort 
and treatment arm. Summary statistics for continuous variables were planned to 
minimally include the number of available data (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), 
minimum, median, and maximum. For categorical variables, n and percentages were 
to be presented and denominators for the percentages were to be based on the 
analysis population used. For categorical variables, frequencies and percentages were 
be presented. Graphical displays were planned to be provided as appropriate. The 
statistical analysis plan contained more detailed descriptions of the plans to analyse 
outcome data in a descriptive manner. 
As regards inferential statistical methodology, the effect of switching to 
avalglucosidase alfa after having received alglucosidase alfa at current stable dose was 
assessed by comparative assessment of the defined composite score.  The difference 
in average composite scores between avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa 
patients was to be used as the test statistic. Null and alternative hypotheses for this 
efficacy endpoint were set up for statistical testing: 
H0: Mean Composite Score for avalglucosidase alfa = Mean Composite Score for 
alglucosidase alfa;    versus 
HA: Mean Composite Score for avalglucosidase alfa ≠ Mean Composite Score for 
alglucosidase alfa 
The control arm (alglucosidase alfa treatment) in Cohort 3 was planned to serve as a 
reference. If deemed appropriate, these analysis might have been repeated using 
Cohort 2 and/or Cohort 1 patients combined with Cohort 3 avalglucosidase alfa treated 
patients. Statistical inference was planned to be performed based on the re-
randomization approach. Specifically, all possible randomization sequences that were 
consistent with the selected randomization design (i.e. randomization stratifying on 
gender) were to be generated. The test statistics were to be calculated for all 
randomization sequences, and the statistical significance level was to be calculated as 
the proportion of more or equally extreme scenarios than the observed one, among all 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 89/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
possible scenarios. Due to the small sample size and open-label nature, p-values were 
planned to serve as references only and any interpretations were suggested to be 
made with caution.  
The plans foreseen and described in the SAP for descriptive statistical data analyses 
are considered adequate. The definitions of analysis populations are reasonable as 
well.  
The sole inferential statistical analysis was carried out for an exploratory Composite 
Score constructed based on three efficacy endpoint domains: GMFM-88 and GMFCS-E 
and R, Ptosis, and Respiratory Function. The need for thorough methodological 
assessment regarding the corresponding re-randomisation test used for statistical 
comparison is seen limited due to the following reasons:  
(i) 
according to the set of secondary trial objectives a “preliminary” comparative 
evaluation of efficacy data was targeted. Against this background, it is found unusual 
in this phase 1/2 setting to foresee the only inferential statistical comparison for an 
exploratory variable in relation to a secondary trial objective,  
(ii) 
the construction of the exporatory composite endpoint lacks any 
methodological background justification in terms of validity and interpretational 
potential to describe a treatment difference comparing group means of that 
constructed score  
(iii) 
the outcome of the statistical test (non-significance) cannot be considered 
sufficiently informative to draw any conclusion with sound interpretability. The 
Company’s own warning in the corresponding results section that “the interpretation of 
the exporatory composite score needs to be performed with caution” underlines the 
limited value of this statistical comparison for B/R-assessment and regulatory decision 
making.

Results 
Participant flow 
All patients completed the primary analysis phase. All but 3 patients (all from cohort 3 
ALGLU arm) entered the ETP. Until data cut-off dose was increased from 20 to 40 
mg/kg AVAL for two patients (Week 61 for one patient and Week 55 for the other 
patient). See Table 25.

Table 20 Participant flow 
•  Recruitment 
The study started in October 2017 and is ongoing. 
•  Conduct of the study 
No protocol deviations related to randomization and drug-dispensing irregularities 
occurred during the study. One batch number recording error was reported.  
Regarding critical or major deviations, no critical deviations were reported. A higher 
incidence of major protocol deviations in Cohort 1 was noted. This may have been due 
to a learning curve in the first patients treated in the study (associated with 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and informed consent procedures) or due to the longer 
duration of participation in the study (associated with assessments/procedures). 
Overall, 2 patients had multiple major protocol deviations. The deviations did not 
negatively impact patients’ safety or data integrity. No patients were excluded from 
the mITT or Safety/PK population due to protocol deviations.

Table 21 Baseline demographic characteristics and growth parameters – in 
PAP- safety population 
Consistent with inclusion criteria, all infants had evidence of cardiac involvement at the 
time of diagnosis (specifically, cardiomegaly in 17 patients, arrhythmia 1, other 4), 
and the majority had hearing loss and muscle weakness as expected in this 
population. Besides the above there was no clear pattern in other medical history 
across cohorts and treatment arms. 
All patients had early onset of symptoms (≤6.5 months of age) and the majority were 
diagnosed and began treatment with alglucosidase alfa at a median age ranging 
between 1.94 and 4.63 months. Functional levels were heterogeneous at baseline 
across all patients, with, as expected due to the inclusion criteria for Cohort 3, less

severe motor dysfunction in Cohort 3 as evaluated by GMFCS E&R levels. 
In this study patients were required to have previously received treatment with 
alglucosidase alfa. The dose of alglucosidase alfa prior to the study ranged from 20 
mg/kg qow up to 42.6 mg/kg qw. 
By cohort, Cohort 1 patients received prior treatment with alglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg 
qow (3 patients) or qw (3 patients); Cohort 2 patients received 20 mg/kg qow (2 
patients) or qw (2 patients) or 40 mg/kg qow (1 patient); Cohort 3 avalglucosidase 
alfa patients received prior treatment with alglucosidase alfa at doses of 20 mg/kg qow 
(1 patient), 25 mg/kg qw (2 patients), 35 mg/kg qw (1 patient), and 42.6 mg/kg qw 
(1 patient); Cohort 3 alglucosidase alfa patients received prior treatment (and PAP 
treatment) with alglucosidase alfa at doses of 20 mg/kg qow (1 patient), 20 mg/kg qw 
(1 patient), 40 mg/kg qow (2 patients), 30 mg/kg qw (1 patient), and 40 mg/kg qw (1 
patient). 
There are imbalances in demographics and patient characteristics at baseline between 
cohorts and treatment arms, most notably with respect to younger age of Cohort 3 
patients in the alglucosidase alfa arm. The median age in this group was 3.6 years, 
more than 4 years younger compared to all other treatment groups.  Higher numbers 
of male patients were included in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (Stage 1), while more female 
patients were enrolled in Cohort 3 (Stage 2), but stratification of randomization by 
gender produced a nearly balanced mix of male and female patients within Cohort 3 
(Stage 2). There were more Asian patients enrolled in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 (Stage 1) 
than in Cohort 3 (Stage 2) and more patients from minorities (2 Black or African 
American and 1 Hispanic or Latino out of 6 patients) in the Cohort 3 alglucosidase alfa 
arm. Due to the inclusion criteria for Cohort 3, patients in this Cohort had less severe 
motor dysfunction compared to patients in Cohort 1 or 2. 
Of note, only 3 patient in Cohort 1 received the approved dose for alglucosidase alfa 
(20 mg/kg qow) prior to study. The dose for the other 3 patients was 20 mg/kg qw. 
Prior to study doses in the other two cohorts were even higher. Two patients even 
received 40 mg/kg qw, or higher. 
The overall rate of patients maintaining compliance with the treatment regimen was 
100% in both the PAP and the ETP.

Efficacy endpoints 
•  Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) and Gross Motor 
Function Classification System - Expanded and Revised (GMFCS-E&R) 
During the PAP, GMFM-88 Total Percent Score mean values increased modestly from 
baseline to Week 25 in all 4 treatment groups. The highest increase was seen in 
Cohort 3, in the alglucosidase alfa group. See Figure 15.  
Subgroup analyses indicated trends in differences mainly on motor function outcomes. 
Subgroup factors associated with improvement or stabilization on GMFM-88 and QMFT 
were female gender, non-Asian race years from diagnosis to ACT14132 study start of 
<8 years and GMFCS level of I. No difference within subgroups could however be 
identified in all other analyses, such as age at first infusion of avalglucosidase alfa or 
alglucosidase alfa in the ACT14132 study. Informative value of these subgroup 
analyses is however limited due to the small sample size of the individual treatment 
groups and overall study. Using defined minimally important difference (MID) 
definitions of change in GMFM-88 score based on GMFCS-E&R baseline functional level, 
individual patients could be classified as ‘improved,’ ‘unchanged,’ and ‘worsening’ on 
the GMFM-88 between baseline and Week 25. In Cohort 1, 3 patients were classified 
as ‘improved,’ 1 patient as ‘unchanged’, and 2 patients were classified as ‘worsening’ 
at Week 25.  In Cohort 2, 2 patients ‘improved’, and 3 patients were ‘unchanged.’  In 
Cohort 3, avalglucosidase alfa group, 2 patients ‘improved’, 2 patients were 
‘unchanged’, and no GMFM assessments were done for 1 patient (due to the patient 
being GMFCS level V).  In Cohort 3, alglucosidase alfa group, 5 patients ‘improved’, 
and 1 patient was ‘unchanged’. 
Only 2 patients demonstrated ‘worsening’ on the GMFM-88 at Week 25 by the 
established MID definition, and both were in Cohort 1 and both had experienced 
clinical decline in motor skills as inclusion criteria to the study. 
During the ETP, GMFM-88 changes grossly followed the trajectory observed for each 
patient from baseline to W25, with patients that classified as having ‘improved’ at W25 
all having higher GMFM-88 total scores at their most recent visit. There was one 
exception related to a patient who improved between baseline and Week 25 and 
experienced a motor decline between Week 49 and Week 73. All patients classified as 
‘unchanged’ at Week 25 remained within 2.6 points of Week 25 scores at their most 
recent visit in the ETP. 
Of the 2 patients from Cohort 1 that were classified as ‘worsening’ at Week 25, both 
increased their dose of avalglucosidase alfa from 20 to 40 mg/kg. The first patient 
increased the dose at Week 61; GMFM Total Percentage score increased from the 
assessment before dose increase to the most recent visit, resulting in GMFM-88 scores 
at his most recent visit to be 2 points from baseline. The second patient increased the 
dose at Week 55 and demonstrated continued decline in GMFM-88 scores until the 
most recent visit at Week 73.

For GMFCS-E&R levels during the PAP, the distribution of levels in Cohort 1 and 2 and 
Cohort 3 avalglucosidase alfa patients showed modest changes in a few patients, with 
a resultant improvement in distribution of 1 level (from Level IV to Level III) by 1 
patient each in Cohort 1 and Cohort 2 at Week 25 and a resultant decline in 
distribution of 1 level (from Level III to Level IV) by 1 patient in the Cohort 3 
avalglucosidase alfa arm while there was no resultant change in GMFCS-E&R level in 
the Cohort 3 alglucosidase alfa patients.

skill scale: mobility domain-scaled  score over time- safety population 
•  Echocardiography 
At baseline, only 1 patient with evaluable echocardiography had an abnormal LVM Z-
score (>2), which normalized by 25 weeks with avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg qow. All 
other patients had normal LVM Z-scores at baseline, and scores remained stable 
through Week 25. Mean (SD) change in LVM (z score) from baseline to Week 25 was -
0.60 (2.16) with avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow and -0.60 (0.71) with 
avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg qow in patients previously declining. In patients 
previously insufficiently controlled, mean (SD) change was -0.58 (0.76) with 
avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg qow and +0.47 (1.76) with alglucosidase alfa at stable 
dose. In summary, all patients remained within the normal ranges or improved their 
LVM and LVMI Z-scores. 
•  Eyelid position measurements 
A  trend  for  improvement of  the  eyelid  position  measurement  was  observed  in  the  40 
mg/kg  qow  avalglucosidase  alfa  groups  (Cohort  2  and  Cohort  3  avalglucosidase  alfa 
arm)  as  compared  to  the  20  mg/kg  qow  avalglucosidase  alfa  group  (Cohort  1)  or 
alglucosidase  alfa  group  (Cohort  3  alglucosidase  alfa  arm),  respectively,  who  showed 
stabilization  or  decline  in  the  measurements.  This  was  more  pronounced  for  the 
Interpalpebral Fissure Distance (both eyes, with and without flash) than for the Margin 
Reflex Distance (both eyes) or the Margin Pupil Distance (both eyes).  
•  Hearing testing 
At baseline, the majority (approximately 75%) of 21 patients tested in study 
ACT14132 had abnormal hearing in at least 1 ear. A single patient in Cohort 1 (20 
mg/kg) with normal hearing at baseline tested abnormal at Week 25; no change in 
hearing status was observed in Cohort 2 (40 mg/kg), while Cohort 3 results showed 
too few assessable patients (only 1 baseline value).

Subgroup  analyses  were  conducted  for  the  secondary  and  selected  tertiary  efficacy 
endpoints by: race, ethnicity, gender, prior alglucosidase alfa treatment duration age at 
first  alglucosidase  alfa  infusion,  age  at  first  infusion  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  or 
alglucosidase  alfa  in  the  ACT14132  study,  baseline  use  of  non-invasive  ventilatory

of  inhibitory  antibody,  quartiles  of  peak  IgG  antibody  titer,  baseline  LVM  Z-Score, 
duration of Pompe disease at start of ACT14132 and prior use of alglucosidase alfa dose 
regimen. 
Trends in differences mainly on motor function outcomes were observed. The following 
subgroup  factors  were  associated  with  improvement  or  stabilization  on  GMFM-88  and 
QMFT: female gender, non-Asian race, years from diagnosis to ACT14132 study start of

<8 years and GMFCS level of I. No difference within subgroups could be identified in all 
other analyses. 
Comparative assessment on an exploratory composite score was performed in addition 
to the above-mentioned other efficacy endpoints. Three domains were used to construct 
this score. Within each domain, the change from baseline to Week 25 was classified into 
improvement,  unchanged,  and  worsening  with  respect  to  pre-defined  minimally 
important  difference  (MID)  in  each  domain.  The  corresponding  score  was  determined 
based on both the baseline status and the change from baseline to Week 25. Results are 
presented in Table 30.

The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting 
the present application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the 
discussion on clinical efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later 
sections). 
Summary of Efficacy for trials EFC14028 and ACT14132 
Title: COMparative Enzyme replacement Trial with neoGAA versus rhGAA (COMET) 
Study identifier 
 EFC14028 
Design 
A Phase 3 multicenter, multinational, 1:1 randomized, double-blinded 
study comparing the efficacy and safety of avalglucosidase alfa and 
alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme®/Lumizyme®) in treatment-naïve 
patients with LOPD. The study includes 2 main periods: the blinded treatment period 
(PAP) and the open-label avalglucosidase alfa long-term follow-up phase (ETP). 
Duration of main phase: 
49 weeks 
Duration of Run-in phase:

Hypothesis 
Treatments groups 
The primary efficacy endpoint (FVC% predicted change from baseline) was tested for 
non-inferiority (NI) of avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa first at 2
level of significance. If the lower bound of the two
for the difference between treatment groups is larger than -1.1 (pre-defined NI 
margin), the 
study is declared positive. After the NI is demonstrated, the superiority 
of the avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa was to be tested with the same

description 
 All efficacy endpoints were summarized descriptively by dose, cohort and treatment        
 group. The mean composite scores between avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase   
 alfa   patients were compared. The control arm (alglucosidase alfa treatment) in   
 Cohort 3 served as a reference. These analyses were also repeated using Cohort 2  
 and/or Cohort 1 patients combined with Cohort 3 avalglucosidase alfa treated    
 patients. The nominal p- values were provided via re-randomization approach.

2.6.5.3.  Clinical studies in special populations 
Clinical studies in special populations are limited to paediatric population. This is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
Patients were selected by confirmed GAA enzyme deficiency from any tissue source 
and/or 2 confirmed GAA gene mutations. 
2.6.5.5.  Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-
analysis) 
No analysis across trials have been conducted. This is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.6.5.6.  Supportive studies 
TDR12857 (NEO-1) was a phase 1, multicenter, multinational, open-label, ascending 
dose study with repeated intravenous (IV) infusions of neoGAA every other week (qow) 
for a total of 13 infusions.  
The study population included 2 groups of late-onset Pompe disease patients ≥18 years 
of age who were naïve to treatment (Group 1) or previously treated for a minimum of 9 
months with alglucosidase alfa (Group 2). The study was intended to assess in man the 
safety  and  tolerability  of  avalglucosidase  alfa,  and  characterize  its  pharmacodynamic 
(PD) and PK profiles following repeated-dose administrations. Additionally, the effect of 
avalglusodisae alfa on exploratory efficacy endpoints was assessed.

The  total  study  duration  per  patient  was  approximately  41  weeks  from  the  time  of 
screening until the end-of-study (EOS), including screening within 90 days, a 24-week 
treatment  period  (Weeks  1  to  25),  post-treatment  evaluation  2  weeks  after  the  last 
infusion (Week 27), and an EOS visit 4 weeks after the last infusion (Week 29).  
The study included male and female patients ≥18 years of age, with confirmed acid α-
glucosidase (GAA) enzyme deficiency from any tissue source and/or confirmed GAA gene 
mutation, and without known cardiac hypertrophy. The patients were able to ambulate 
50 m (approximately 160 feet) without stopping and without an assistive device. The 
patients had a forced vital capacity (FVC) in the upright position of ≥50% predicted.  
6MWT and % predicted FVC values in treatment-naïve (Group 1, n=10) or previously 
alglucosidase alfa-treated (Group 2, n=14) patients with LOPD were generally stable or 
increased slightly in both groups without clear relationship to dose level (doses employed 
were 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg qow). Minimal change in respiratory parameters 
FVC, MIP and MEP, as well as 6MWT were observed at avalglucosidase alfa 5 mg/kg in 
both  groups,  while  largest  improvement  in %  predicted  values  of  FVC,  MIP,  MEP  and 
6MWT was seen with avalglucosidase alfa dose of 20 mg/kg (+6.2%, +7.9%, +12% and 
+3.9%, respectively) in the treatment-naïve patients. 
Study  LTS13769  (NEO-EXT)  is  an  open-label  treatment  extension  study  enrolling 
patients  who  completed  study  TDR12857.  Among  the  21  patients  who  completed  the 
TDR12857  study,  19  patients  were  enrolled  in  the  LTS13769  study.  Among  them,  2 
patients  prematurely  discontinued;  the  reasons  for  treatment  discontinuation  were 
wishes to withdraw and other. Seventeen patients remained on IMP and were ongoing 
in the long-term safety study at the time of the data cut- (27 February 2020). Overall, 
patients remained stable on treatment over time, with variations on performance in six 
minute walk test, forced vital capacity, forced expiratory volume, maximum expiratory 
pressure,  maximum  inspiratory  pressure,  and  peak  expiratory  flow  due  to  age  and 
comorbidities. 
2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The main evidence for safety and efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa is derived from a phase 
3,  randomized  double-blind,  study  comparing  avalglucosidase  alfa  (neoGAA)  and 
alglucosidase  alfa  in  treatment-naive  patients  (≥  3  years  of  age)  with  LOPD  (study 
EFC14028). The conduct of a double-blinded RCT in a sufficiently large number of LOPD 
patients is positively recognized. The trial provides an adequate basis for drawing robust 
conclusions  on  the  comparative  efficacy  of  avalglucosidase  versus  the  approved  ERT 
Myozyme in adult LOPD patients.  
Data for the paediatric population comes from the phase 2 study ACT14132 in previously 
treated  IOPD  patients  >  6  months.  The  study  recruited  22  paediatric  patients  (5-6 
patients  per  arm)  to  investigate  the  safety,  immunogenicity  and  PK  of  subsequent 
treatment  with  avalglucosidase  (20-40mg,  every  other  week),  collecting  also  some 
Nexviadyme

preliminary efficacy data. Due to its design and small size the study cannot deliver firm 
conclusions on avalglucosidase´s efficacy in this setting. 
The primary support for the efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa in the treatment of Pompe 
disease comes from the randomized phase 3 study EFC14028 comparing in treatment 
naïve LOPD patients avalglucosidase alfa (AVAL) to alglucosidase alfa (ALGLU), which is 
currently the only approved ERT for Pompe disease. 
Study EFC14028 (COMET) 
The study design of EFC14028 was discussed and considered acceptable during the 
protocol assistance. 
In this study, a total of 100 patients were 1:1 randomized; 51 patients received AVAL, 
49 patients received ALGLU. All eligible patients had a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe’s 
disease (GAA deficiency and/or two GAA gene mutations), were 3 years of age or older, 
were  able  to  walk  40  m  on  the  6-minute  walk  test  without  stopping  and  without  an 
assistive device, and had a percentage of the predicted FVC within the range of 30% to 
less  than  85%  in  the  upright  position.  Patients  were  excluded  if  they  required  any 
invasive  ventilation  or  if  they  had  previous  treatment  with  alglucosidase  alfa  or  any 
investigational therapy for Pompe disease. 
In  the  avalglucosidase  alfa  group,  27  (52.9%)  patients  were  male  and  24  (47.1%) 
patients were female and in the alglucosidase alfa group, 25 (51.0%) patients were male 
and 24 (49.0%) patients were female. The majority of the patients were “White”. There 
was 1 Japanese and 1 paediatric patient, both in the avalglucosidase alfa group. Hispanic 
or  Latino  ethnicity  was  more  frequent  in  the  alglucosidase  alfa  (24.5%)  than  in  the 
avalglucosidase alfa group (5.9%).  
The  mean  age  of  included  patients  was  48  years;  only  1  paediatric  patient  (aged  15 
years)  was  included  in  the  avalglucosidase  alfa  group.  Patients  were  slightly  younger 
(mean  age  (SD):  AVAL  46  (14.5)  vs.  ALGLU  50.3  (13.7))  and  fewer  patients  used  a 
walking device at baseline in the avalglucosidase alfa group. The mean weight, height, 
and  body  mass  index  (BMI)  were  similar  between  both  groups.  The  mean  distance 
patients in the  AVAL  group  were  able  to  walk  were 399  m on the  6-minute  walk  test 
compared to 378 m reached by patients in the ALGLU group – 21 meters less. Baseline 
FVC% predicted was also slightly better in the AVAL group (AVAL 62.5 vs. ALGLU 61.6).  
The  selected  age  cut-off  of  3  years  is  considered  appropriate  due  to  evidence  from 
literature that patients as young as 3 years old can adequately perform spirometry after 
approximately 15 minutes of instruction prior to the test (Eigen, 2001, Am J Respir Crit 
Care Med; Pesant, 2007, Pediatr Pulmonol). 
Overall,  this  trial  includes  a  less  severely  affected  patient  population  in  terms  of 
respiratory function (mean % predicted FVC: 54.2 vs. 62.1) and mean walking distance 
(6MWT m: 325.1 vs. 388.9) compared with population of the phase 3 ALGLU02704 study 
with alglucosidase alfa. According to the Applicant, this is due to current availability of 
effective therapy (alglucosidase alfa) and hence, patients being treated earlier in their 
disease.  The  justification  for  including  a  less  severely  affected  patient  population  in 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 113/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
terms  of  respiratory  function  as  compared  with  the  main  study  conducted  with 
alglucosidase alfa is generally reasonable. 
Due to the rarity of treatment naïve LOPD patients in the subpopulation of under the 
age of 18 years, only 1 paediatric patient has been included in the study. According to 
the original PIP a minimum of 4 paediatric patients (at least 1 patient from 3 to less than 
6 years of age and at least 3 patients from 6 to less than 18 years of age) were required 
to  be  enrolled.  Enrollment  of  patients  aged  3  to  <18  years  in  the  study  has  been 
challenging,  mainly  due  to  exclusion  criterion  related  to  respiratory  function 
(requirements that FVC% predicted ≤85%). According to literature (van Capelle et al. 
2016) only about 50% of newly diagnosed paediatric LOPD patients have impaired lung 
function at time of diagnosis. Per clinical practice, these patients are treated early with 
ERT as physicians are not waiting for decline. Since study EFC14028 enrolled a treatment 
naïve population, treated patients were no longer eligible for participation in this study. 
Due  to  recruitment  difficulties,  the  agreed  PIP  was  modified    to  include  2  paediatric 
patients in an open label part of EFC14028 study. However, since only one additional 9 
years old paediatric patient could be recruited (enrolled after the study cut-off date of 
10  March  2020),  study  EFC14028  was  subsequently  removed  from  the  latest  agreed 
PIP.   The lack of feasibility to generate sufficient paediatric data in LOPD population is 
thus agreed by the CHMP.  
The duration of the study for each patient included an up to 14-day screening period, a 
49-week blinded treatment period (PAP), an up to 144-week open-label treatment period 
(ETP) with avalglucosidase alfa for all patients regardless of prior randomization group, 
and  an  up  to  4-week  post  treatment  observation  period.  In  order  to  allow  study 
participants  to  continue  to  receive  the  investigational  medicinal  product  (IMP)  after 
Week 145, the study was extended to an additional period of up to 144 weeks in protocol 
amendment 3, dated 10-Apr-2019. 
The study included two main periods: a blinded treatment period (PAP) and an open-
label  extension,  in  which  patients  in  the  alglucosidase  alfa  arm  were  switched  to 
avalglucosidase  alfa.  The  12-month  double-blind  comparative  treatment  period  for 
assessment  of  the  primary  endpoint  was  discussed  during  scientific  advice  and 
considered acceptable by CHMP. The usefulness of efficacy data of the switched patients 
is considered limited, but adds some information regarding safety, i.e. acceptability of 
switching from alglucosidase alfa to avalglucosidase alfa.  
The  study  was  conducted  with  a  dose  schedule  of  20  mg/kg  qow  for  both,  the 
avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa arm. This corresponds with the recommended 
labelled dosing for alglucosidase alfa. For avalglucosidase alfa, the dose selection was 
supported by the results from non-clinical studies and the safety and exploratory efficacy 
results  from  the  ascending  dose  phase  1  study  TDR12857.  The  limited  number  of 
patients included in each dose cohort of study TDR12857 (n=3-4 per cohort in the phase 
I trial) does not permit any valid conclusions on relative efficacy, but did not indicate 
dose-dependent increases in tolerability problems. The Applicant has not conducted any 
investigations of optimal dose intervals (e.g. qw as compared to qow) or formal dose 
finding trials. However, retrospectively considering the results of the pivotal study and 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report

taking into account clinical experience gained with alglucosidase alfa, the dosing scheme 
is is deemed acceptable. 
The primary efficacy assessment is based on forced vital capacity (FVC; % predicted). 
This  is  partly  in  line  with  the  primary  endpoint  used  in  the  registration  trial  for 
alglucosidase  alfa  (ALGLU02704/LOTS).  In  this  placebo-controlled  trial,  a  co-primary 
endpoint comprising the 6-minute walk test and % predicted FVC in the upright position 
was used. FVC is a well-established surrogate marker of pulmonary function, which is a 
relevant  target  in  Pompe  disease.  Furthermore,  the  chosen  surrogate  endpoint  is 
relevant  since  after  10-15  years  of  manifest  disease  many  patients  suffer  from  -  and 
eventually  die  of  respiratory  insufficiency.  Overall,  FVC  %  predicted  in  the  upright 
position from baseline to 12 months is considered suitable as primary endpoint.  
The chosen secondary endpoints 6MWT, maximum inspiratory pressure (MIP), maximum 
expiratory  pressure  (MEP);  %  predicted,  lower  extremity  muscle  strength  (hand-held 
dynamometry (HHD)), motor function (Quick Motor Function Test (QMFT)), and health-
related  quality  of  life  Short  Form-12  (SF-12)  are  considered  suitable  to  demonstrate 
consistency in effect across several domains. 
As avalglucosidase alfa was expected to be at least as efficacious as alglucosidase alfa, 
it was considered appropriate to firstly test for non-inferiority. If NI was demonstrated, 
superiority of avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa in FVC (% predicted) would 
be tested at the same overall 5% significance level. If the superiority of avalglucosidase 
alfa versus alglucosidase alfa was demonstrated on the primary efficacy endpoint, the 
hypothesis testing for several secondary efficacy endpoints would proceed according to 
a pre-defined order: superiority tests in 6MWT, MIP, MEP and HHD. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of change from baseline in FVC (% predicted) in upright 
position to Week 49 was planned to be analyzed in the mITT population using a mixed 
model for repeated measures (MMRM) with change from baseline as outcome variable. 
The definition of the analysis sets can be endorsed, and the MMRM-based analyses for 
primary and secondary endpoints are considered adequate. 
The difference between treatment groups was planned to be estimated based on least 
square  (LS)  means  at  the  Week  49  visit  within  the  MMRM  model.  A  2-sided  95% 
confidence interval (CI) using the estimate and variance of the LS mean difference was 
to  be  provided.  If  the  lower  bound  of  the  2-sided  95%  CI  for  the  difference  of 
avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa was found to be larger than -1.1, the study 
would be considered to have met its primary objective. Each of the secondary endpoints 
were planned to be analyzed based on the MMRM model, similar to that described for 
the primary endpoint, using the mITT population (with the exception of SF-12, which 
was  planned  to  be  analyzed  for  a  subset  of  mITT  patients  with  age  ≥18  years).  The 
difference  between  treatment  groups  was  to  be  assessed  with  LS  mean  difference  at 
Week 49 estimated within the framework of the corresponding MMRM model. P-values 
and 2-sided 95% CIs were planned to be provided.  
The chosen hierarchical testing strategy is considered a suitable method to control for 
multiple testing. From the methological perspective, it is, however noted that stopping 
in this hierarchy due to a non-significant result limits the interpretability of subsequent 
Nexviadyme

endpoint analyses. The plans described in relation to blinding measures are generally 
considered adequate.  
Study ACT14132 (Mini-COMET) 
Additional evidence of efficacy comes from the paediatric Phase 2 study ACT14132 
(Mini-COMET)  in  IOPD  patients  aged  6  months  and  older  who  previously  experienced 
disease progression while on alglucosidase alfa. Study ACT14132 is a multistage (stage 
1:  declining  patients,  stage  2:  insufficient  clinical  response)  phase  2  open-label, 
ascending dose (20 or 40 mg/kg qow) cohort study with long-term open label ETP, at a 
dose of 20 mg/kg qow (Cohort 1) or 40 mg/kg qow (Cohorts 2 and 3). The MTD was 
established  at  40  mg/kg  after  consultation  of  the  Data  Monitoring  Committee  (DMC). 
The Extension Period (ETP) was extended to 7 years in the amended protocol 02, dated 
24.3.2020. The proposed design was discussed in a protocol assistance and considered 
overall acceptable.  
The  patient  must  have  had  a  documented  GAA  deficiency,  aged  <18  years, 
cardiomyopathy at the time of Pompe disease diagnosis, having received a stable dose 
of alglucosidase alfa regularly for a minimum of 6  months immediately prior to study 
entry,  and  documented  evidence  of  clinical  decline  (Stage  1)  or  suboptimal  clinical 
response (Stage 2).  
The study population fulfilled the measures specified in the agreed PIP. Patients at high-
risk for experiencing a severe allergic reaction to avalglucosidase alfa (i.e. patients who 
previously had severe anaphylactic reaction to alglucosidase alfa and/or a history of high 
sustained  IgG  antibody  titers  to  alglucosidase  alfa)  were  excluded  from  the  phase  2 
study  in  IOPD  patients.  This  was  of  concern  for  the  CHMP,  since  it  could  potentially 
confound  the  safety/immunogenicity  and  efficacy  results  for  avalglucosidase  alfa. 
Further data were provided to address this concern. It was shown that at baseline, 11 
patients  were  ADA  positive  with  anti-alglucosidase  alfa  antibodies  with  titers  ranging 
from 100 to 800. During treatment, 6 anti-alglucosidase alfa ADA-positive patients had 
treatment  boosted  ADA  with  titers  up  to  25600,  and  4  anti-alglucosidase  alfa  ADA-
negative  patients  seroconverted.  At  Week  25,  all patients  receiving  alglucosidase  alfa 
were  switched  to  avalglucosidase  alfa  40  mg/kg  qow  regardless  of  ADA  titers  during 
PAP. Data also evidenced that high titer of anti-alglucosidase alfa antibodies was not a 
limitation to switching to avalglucosidase alfa. These findings were also valuable for all 
treatment-naïve  patients  in  EFC14028,  initially  randomized  to  alglucosidase  alfa  who 
also  switched  to  avalglucosidase  alfa  during  the  ETP,  including  those  in  the high  titer 
category. Overall, the CHMP concluded that the impact of the exclusion criteria of study 
ACT14132 on the generalizability of the study findings regarding safety/immunogenicity 
and efficacy results was thus considered negligible. 
All patients were treated for 25 weeks during Primary Analysis Period (PAP), thereafter, 
all patients had the option to receive long term treatment with avalglucosidase alfa in 
an Extended Treatment Period (ETP) at a dose of 20 mg/kg qow (Cohort 1) or 40 mg/kg 
qow (Cohorts 2 and 3).  
While stage 1 can be considered a limited dose-finding study for patients with severe 
forms of IOPD, the second stage allowed a direct treatment comparison of the highest 
acceptable  dose  of  AVAL  (40  mg/kg  qow,  based  on  data  from  cohorts  1  &  2)  and 
Nexviadyme

alglucosidase alfa at the current stable dose (between 20 mg/kg qow and 40 mg/kg qw 
as prescribed by physician during the 6 months prior to study) in patients with advanced 
disease.  In  principle,  such  an  additional  trial  stage  is  considered  meaningful,  even 
though  the  small  sample  size  does  not  allow  firm  conclusions  and  the  alglucosidase 
control-arm was treated at various different doses.  
Twenty-two patients were enrolled: 6 in Cohort 1, treated with avalglucosidase alfa at 
20 mg/kg qow for 6 months, 5 in Cohort 2, treated with avalglucosidase alfa at 40 mg/kg 
qow  for  6  months,  and  11  in  Cohort  3,  where  they  were  randomized  to  receive 
avalglucosidase  alfa  at  40  mg/kg  qow  (5  patients)  or  alglucosidase  alfa  treatment  at 
current stable dose (between 20 mg/kg qow and 40 mg/kg qw as prescribed by physician 
during the 6 months prior to study) (6 patients) for 6 months. The methods of treatment 
assignment  to  enrolled  patients,  including  the  randomisation  procedure  for  Cohort-3-
patients  are  adequately  described  and  no  concerns  arise  in  relation  to  outcome 
interpretation. Nevertheless, inclusion in this study was sequential, with patients with 
declining condition being included first. Treatment condition was not blinded at the site 
level from an operation perspective. Nonetheless, some measures were taken to reduce 
bias  for  some  observations  where  feasible,  such  as  the  central  reading  of 
echocardiograms in a blinded manner and the testing of laboratory parameters, with the 
exception of pharmacokinetic and immunogenicity measurements. 
Unblinded conditions seem straight forward for safety evaluations in Cohort 1 and Cohort 
2.  Comparative  assessment  of  preliminary  efficacy  endpoints  in  Cohort  3  would  have 
benefitted from blinded conditions. However, in light of the limitations in interpretation 
of  generated  efficacy  data    there  is  little  additional  concern  regarding  potential  bias 
caused by the open-label nature of the trial. 
No  patient  discontinued  in  the  PAP  or  up  to  the  cut-off  date.  At  the  cut-off  date,  all 
patients were included in the ongoing ETP.  
Patients were allowed to participate in the study with heterogeneous baseline functional 
levels. Cohorts 1 and 2 included the most severely affected patients. Cohort 3 treatment 
arms  were  imbalanced,  with  alglucosidase  alfa-treated  patients  being  younger  in  age 
and receiving dose regimens between 20 mg/kg qow and 40 mg/kg qw, being enrolled 
mostly  with  new  onset  of  ptosis.  Overall,  avalglucosidase  alfa-treated  patients  were 
older and were enrolled based on motor function plateau or respiratory criteria. 
Medical/surgical  histories  were  in  line  with  underlying  Pompe  disease  in  a  paediatric 
population. In line with inclusion criteria, all infants had cardiac involvement at the time 
of diagnosis, and the majority had hearing loss and muscle weakness as expected in this 
population.  
The primary objective of the ACT14132 study was the assessment of safety and 
tolerability of administering avalglucosidase alfa. The secondary objectives were 
characterization of the pharmacokinetic profile of avalglucosidase alfa and evaluation 
of the preliminary efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa in comparison to alglucosidase alfa. 
Efficacy endpoints in ACT14132 included motor function (evaluated through functional 
and clinical outcome assessments and 6-minute walk test [6MWT]), respiratory 
function (evaluated through pulmonary functional testing [PFT] and ventilator use

questionnaire), quality of life, pain, cardiac function (echocardiography), eyelid 
position measurements, and cognitive and auditory function. These endpoints 
represent systems affected by Pompe disease where clinical decline or sub-optimal 
response to alglucosidase alfa was observed. The CHMP considers that due to its 
design and small size, the study is not able to deliver firm conclusions on a 40 mg/kg 
qw starting dose in the IOPD setting, as initially proposed by the applicant. In 
particular treatment naïve IOPD patients were not included in the study. This is further 
discussed below. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study EFC14028 (COMET) 
The primary objective of the Phase 3 study EFC14028 was met by demonstrating non-
inferiority  of  respiratory  function  as  measured  by  %  predicted  FVC  as  compared  to 
alglucosidase  alfa  at  week  49.  The  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  49  in  % 
predicted  FVC  in  the  avalglucosidase  alfa  group  (mITT)  was  2.89;  the  corresponding 
value  was  0.46  in  the  alglucosidase  alfa  group.  The  difference  in  mean  change  from 
baseline to week 49 of 2.43 (with a lower boundary of the 95% CI of -0.13) exceeded 
the predefined NI margin of -1.1, and thus meets the primary study objective of non-
inferiority. A pre-planned sensitivity analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint in the PAP 
PP population indicates that the non-inferiority conclusion is robust. 
In a second step, superiority of % FVC was tested, but the study could not demonstrate 
superiority  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  in  this  endpoint.  Therefore,  the  further  endpoints 
cannot be interpreted in a conclusive manner. Regarding secondary endpoints, the LS 
mean  difference  in  distance  walked  in  meters  in  the  6MWT  (key  secondary  endpoint) 
was 30.01 (95% C.I.:1.33, 58.69). 
Subgroup analyses for study EFC14028 (primary efficacy endpoint, % predicted FVC), 
performed by age group (<18 years, ≥18 years to <45 years, ≥45 years old), gender, 
baseline FVC groups (<55%, and ≥55%), region, baseline walking device use, baseline 
6MWT distance, duration of disease at baseline, and race indicate consistency of results 
across subgroups. 
Although some of the investigated efficacy parameters showed a positive trend for better 
outcome  with  avalglucosidase  alfa,  many  of  these  endpoints  were  correlated  and  are 
measured in the same patients. Most importantly, however, demonstration of superiority 
of avalglucosidase alfa over alglucosidase alfa in the primary endpoint % predicted FVC 
at Week 49 was missed at the required significance level. Accordingly, all subsequently 
conducted  statistical  tests  for  the  secondary  endpoints  in  the  pre-specified  hierarchy 
could formally not be carried out under adequate experimentwise type-1-error control. 
Hence, any reference in the discussion of trial outcome for these endpoints indicating an 
advantage  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  over  alglucosidase  alfa  is  not  permissible  and  a 
conclusion of demonstrated superiority is not possible.  
The  LS  mean  difference  in  distance  walked  in  meters  in  the  6MWT  (key  secondary 
endpoint) was 30.01 (95% C.I.:1.33, 58.69).

across subgroups. 
Due to sequential enrollment, data at Week 97 are available in 40% of the original trial 
population and only limited data beyond Week 97 is available. At the cut-off date of 19 
March 2020, 91 patients were enrolled in the ongoing extension treatment period (ETP) 
and  efficacy  data  at  97  weeks  were  available  for  24  patients  who  had  continuously 
received avalglucosidase alfa since study start and for 21 patients who switched from 
alglucosidase alfa to avalglucosidase alfa treatment after 49 weeks.  Clinical outcomes 
in the extension treatment period were not included in the confirmatory testing strategy 
and only descriptive statistics were used for these endpoints. The observed mean change 
from  baseline  of  the  %predicted  FVC  numerically  decreases  over  time  in  ETP  in  the 
(continued)  avalglucosidase  alfa  group  and  improved  in  patients  switching  from 
alglucosidase  alfa.  Furthermore  recent  data  (cut-off  date  10  February  2021)  show  a 
plateau or even a slight decrease in the effect of avalglucosidase  alfa in FVC and 6MWT. 
The  applicant  argued  that  the  maintenance  of  efficacy  in  the  long-term  is  however 
beneficial  taking  into  account  the  natural  decline  in  these  parameters  with  age  and 
progressing  disease.  Furthermore,  based  on  published  evidence,  the  applicant’s 
assumption is that patients on alglucosidase alfa would either reach a stable plateau or 
slowly decline, then observing a positive change from switching to avalglucosidase alfa 
in clinical  outcomes, further supporting that there is also a clinical benefit of switching 
from  alglucosidase  alfa  to  avalglucosidase  alfa.  The  CHMP  however  noted  that  recent 
long term efficacy data from alglucosidase alfa are available  indicating a sustained effect 
up to five years (see Myozyme SmPC). Data from avalglucosidase alfa study LTS13769, 
an open-label treatment extension study enrolling patients who completed the phase 1 
study TDR12857 seem to show a stabilisation of the pulmonary and motor functions of 
the patients.  
Taking into consideration the flattening effect of avalglucosidase alfa at Week 97 of the 
pivotal study and the available long term data for avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase 
alfa, a potential efficacy advantage of avalglucosidase alfa over algucosidase alfa in the 
long run of treatment remain to be demonstrated.  
Notably, the overall performance of alglucosidase alfa in the COMET study was poorer 
than  in  the  registration  trial  for  alglucosidase  alfa  (ALGLU02704/LOTS).  In  the  LOTS 
trial,  the  estimated  change    in    FVC,  expressed  as  a  percentage  of  each  patient’s 
predicted value, was an increase of 1.2 percentage points at week 78 (1.73 at week 49) 
for the patients who received alglucosidase alfa (and a decrease of 2.2 percentage points 
for the patients who received placebo). This effect  was even more pronounced in the 
key secondary endpoint, the 6MWT. In the present COMET study the LS mean change 
(SE) in 6MWT (distance walked in meters) from baseline to Week 49 was 2.19 (10.40) 
in the alglucosidase alfa group compared to a mean increase of 25.1 m on the 6-minute 
walk seen in the ALGLU02704/LOTS trial test at week 78.  The CHMP was thus concerned  
about  the  observed  poor  performance  of  alglucosidase  alfa  that  could  potentially 
contribute  to  an  overestimation  of  the  observed  effect  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  in  the 
COMET  study.  The  applicant  argued  that  study    AGLU02704  was  conducted 
Nexviadyme

approximately 15 years ago when no treatment was available for patients with Pompe 
disease, potentially affecting the baseline criteria of enrolled patients. Post-hoc analyses 
between  Study  EFC14028  and  Study  AGLU02704  revealed  some  key  differences:  a 
delayed  time  to  an  enzyme  replacement  therapy  initiation  in  Study  AGLU02704 
compared to Study EFC14028 (median time from diagnosis to treatment 7.50 years vs 
0.65 year, respectively) as well as greater severity of the disease in patients randomized 
in Study AGLU02704. Post-hoc analyses were conducted to estimate the impact of the 
selection 
differences 
in 
studies 
EFC14028 
and 
AGLU02704 
on 
the 
results/outcomes/patient  trajectories.  Although  these  post-hoc  data  need  to  be 
interpreted  with  caution,  results  observed  in  the  alglucosidase  alfa  group  in  Study 
EFC14028  are  likely  influenced  by  a  randomized  population  different  to  the  one 
randomized 
in  Study  AGLU02704.  Thus, 
the  concern 
regarding  potential 
underperformance of alglucosidase alfa in Study EFC14028 is sufficiently alleviated. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical efficacy 
Study EFC14028 (COMET) 
Data  are  limited  to  2  patients  aged  16  and  9  years  old.  For  the  primary  endpoint, 
improvement of % predicted FVC of 2.63% (from 84.79% at screening to 87.42% at 
Week 49) compared to a LS mean increase (SE) of 2.89 (0.88) % was reported in the 
older paediatric patient in the global study as well as improvement of 6MWT distance 
(%predicted) of 34 m (5.33%) (from 602 m [84.19%] at screening to 636 m [89.52%] 
at Week 49) compared to a LS mean increase (SE) of 32.21 m (9.93) (5.02% [1.54] for 
the  secondary  endpoint.  A  clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  the  primary  and  key 
secondary endpoints from baseline to Week 49 was thus observed and was consistent 
with mean data observed in adult patients. The second paediatric patient, aged 9 years 
at study entry, was included in the study after  cut-off date (19 March 2020) and, per 
protocol, directly entered the open-label period with avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow. 
The  patient  recently  completed  Week  25  visit,  an  improvement  in  FVC  (82.72%vs 
84.51%), 6MWT (444m/70.28 vs 463.14m/72.24%) was also observed, confirming the 
benefit of avalglucosidase alfa in the broad range of patients with LOPD. Although these 
data  are  very  limited,  the  CHMP  previously  acknowledged  the  lack  of  feasibility  to 
generate sufficient paediatric data in LOPD population. A comprehensive justification for 
extrapolation of the efficacy from adult to paediatric LOPD patients was submitted by 
the  applicant.  Since  the  available  efficacy  data  are  comparable  between  adult  and 
paediatric LOPD patients, the CHMP accepted such extrapolation. See further below. 
Study ACT14132 (Mini-COMET) 
During the PAP, GMFM-88 mean scores increased modestly from baseline to Week 25 in 
all  four  treatment  groups.  The  highest  increase  was  seen  in  Cohort  3,  in  the 
alglucosidase alfa group. According to the Applicant, this may be attributed to younger 
patient age and a smaller proportion of subjects within the group with suboptimal motor 
response at baseline.  
Consistently to the results of the Gross Motor Function Measure-88, the greatest degree 
of change in the QMFT–total score was observed in the alglucosidase alfa group. In the 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 120/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ETP,  QMFT  change  from  baseline  remained  in  the  same  direction  for  all  patients  with 
available data at the most recent visit, with the exception of 1 patient in Cohort 2; this 
patient increased 1 point in score at Week 25 and at most recent visit had a change of 
1 point from baseline.  
All patients remained within the normal ranges or improved their left ventricular mass 
(LVM) and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) echocardiography Z-scores. 
A  trend  for  improvement  of  the  eyelid  position  measurement  could  potentially  be 
observed in the 40 mg/kg qow avalglucosidase alfa groups as compared to the 20 mg/kg 
qow  or  alglucosidase  alfa  groups  which  showed  stabilization  or  decline  in  the 
measurements. Pulmonary function tests were performed only in few patients able to 
reliably  undergo  testing,  and  no  trends  were  observed  for  the  patients  with  available 
data.  In  addition  to  the  above-mentioned  other  efficacy  endpoints  a  comparative 
assessment on an exploratory composite score was performed. The 3 domains used to 
construct  this  score  were  the  Gross  motor  function  score,  the  Ptosis  score  and  the 
Respiratory score. The composite scores for Cohort 3 were higher for the alglucosidase 
alfa arm than the avalglucosidase alfa arm, as well as compared to all avalglucosidase 
alfa treated patients in the PAP, although the difference was not significant. The outcome 
of  this  exploratory  composite  endpoint,  however,  cannot  be  considered  sufficiently 
informative  to  draw  any sound  and  firm  conclusion on  the  efficacy  of  avalglucosidase 
alfa.  
Overall the totality of the evidence on efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa in IOPD patient is 
very  limited,  especially  because  the  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  determine 
safety and no data are available in treatment naïve IOPD population. A comprehensive  
justification for extrapolation of the efficacy from LOPD to IOPD patients was submitted 
by  the  applicant.  Since  the  pathophysiology  of  the disease,  the  mechanism  of  action, 
and  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  enzyme  replacement  therapy  (ERT)  for  Pompe 
Disease are comparable across the whole disease spectrum, the CHMP accepted such 
extrapolation.  
Regarding long term data, at a cut off data of 30 April 2021, all 22 patients were still 
participating in  the  study,  all  were  treated  for  at least  2  years,  and  stage  1 patients, 
previously declining with alglucosidase alfa, were treated for at least 3 years. In Cohort 
1, 4 patients out of 6 have had a dose increase from 20 mg/kg to 40 mg/kg qow per 
predefined  protocol  criteria,  and  all  Cohort  3  patients  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa 
during the initial 6 months of the study had switched to avalglucosidase alfa treatment 
at 40 mg/kg qow. These long term data showed a slight improvement or stabilisation of 
the  endpoints  assessed  but  with  substantial  variation  between  patients.  This  effect  is 
however was not consistently in favour of patients initially treated with avalglucosidase 
alfa 40 mg/kg, as claimed by the applicant. For instance, the assessment scale Pompe 
paediatric  evaluation  of  disability  inventory  (Pompe  PEDI)  showed  a  more  beneficial 
effect,  or  at  least  a  comparable  effect  for  Cohort  1  patients  (initially  treated  with  20 
mg/kg  avalglucosidase  alfa).  Interestingly,  best  response  in  all  endpoints  but  one 
(Intrapalpebral fissue distance) is demonstrated for patients participating in cohort 3, 
initially treated with alglucosidase alfa. While avalglucosidase alfa 40 mg/kg shows an 
acceptable  safety  profile,  the  efficacy  data  presented  are  not  considered  sufficient  to 
Nexviadyme 
Assessment report  
Page 121/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
support the claimed 40 mg/kg starting dose for avalglucosidase alfa in IOPD patients. 
Clinical response varies greatly between patients and a clear dose response relationship 
could not be demonstrated. Moreover, a starting dose of 40 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa 
in treatment naïve patients has not been investigated at all. However, uthe se of the 
40mg/kg regimen could be agreed for those IOPD patients who show a less than optimal 
clinical response to the 20mg/kg (starting) dose. Following the CHMP recommendation, 
the applicant agreed to update the posology in IOPD patients, reflecting that for IOPD 
patients  who  experience  lack  of  improvement  or  insufficient  response  in  cardiac, 
respiratory,  and/or  motor  function  while  receiving  20  mg/kg,  a  dose  increase  to  40 
mg/kg every other week should be considered in the absence of safety concerns (e.g 
severe hypersensitivity, anaphylactic reactions, or risk of fluid overload).

Proposed Indication 
The claimed indication is “Nexviadyme (avalglucosidase alfa) is indicated for long-term 
enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease (acid α-
glucosidase deficiency).” Based on the submitted data, the CHMP considered acceptable 
the wording of the indication that includes both adult and paediatric LOPD population 
and IOPD population. 
Pompe's disease is a genetic disease which is therefore present in patients from birth, 
the mutations are very diverse and there is no relationship between the mutation and 
the amount of residual enzyme activity. In both populations the root cause of the disease 
is the deficiency GAA activity, the difference between the infantile and adult forms being 
due to the amount of residual enzyme activity. In the infantile setting, this activity is 
absent or  almost  absent whereas  there  is  residual activity  in  the  adult  type.  Pompe's 
disease is heterogeneous and is characterised by muscular damage linked to glycogen 
storage. However, the damage is not totally identical in the infantile and adult forms, 
particularly with regard to cardiac damage, even though there may be some overlaps. 
Nevertheless, since the available efficacy data for avalglucosidase alfa are comparable 
between  adult  and  paediatric  LOPD  patients,  the  extrapolation  of  efficacy  from  adult 
LOPD to paediatric LOPD population is acceptable by the CHMP, especially since the lack 
of feasibility to generate sufficient paediatric data in LOPD population is acknowledged. 
In  addition,  in  order  to  justify  that  the  data  are  transposable  from  LOPD  to  IOPD 
population,  the  applicant  explained  that  alglucosidase  alfa  (Myozyme)  has  been 
approved  across  the  spectrum  of  Pompe  disease  on  the  basis  of  survival  data  in  the 
infantile  form  and  motor  and  respiratory  function  data  in  adults  and  that  therefore 
avalglucosidase which contains the same enzyme/protein should also be effective across 
the whole spectrum of Pompe disease. This reasoning is considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. This is further supported by the results of study EFC14028, which demonstrated 
non-inferiority of avalglucosidase in % predicted forced vital capacity (FVC) as well as a 
comparable safety profile in LOPD patients. 
The CHMP also noted that a further study is planned to evaluate the safety and efficacy 
of avalglucosidase alfa patients with IOPD ≤6 months naïve to previous treatment with 
alglucosidase  alfa.  Study  EFC14462  will  be  a  phase  3  open  label  multinational, 
multicenter intravenous infusion study for avalglucosidase alfa in approximately 16 male 
and  female  treatment  naïve  patients  ≤  6  months  of  age  with  documented  IOPD.  The 
first patient is expected to be enrolled in Q2 2021. This study is expected to generate 
data to confirm efficacy and safety of avalglucosidase alfa in treatment-naive patients 
with IOPD and the CHMP considered acceptable to submit them as a post-authorisation 
commitment. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa was demonstrated in 
Nexviadyme

patients with Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase deficiency) in the proposed dosing 
regimens for adult and paediatric (0-18 years) population. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
The  avalglucosidase  alfa  clinical  development  program  was  designed  to  demonstrate 
reductions  in  burden  of  the  disease  in  children  and  adults  with  Pompe  disease  as 
compared with the standard-of-care ERT, alglucosidase alfa. To match the heterogeneity 
of  the  Pompe  disease  patient  population,  4  clinical  studies  evaluated  avalglucosidase 
alfa in a broad spectrum of patients. See  Figure 24. 
Figure 21 Overview of the avalglucosidase alfa clinical development program 
They were Phase 3 study EFC14028, and Phase 2 study ACT14132, which are the studies 
to support the primary basis of approval, and the supportive Phase 1/2 study TDR12857 
and its open-label long term extension study LTS13769. Study TDR12857 is completed, 
as well as the PAP of studies EFC14028 and ACT14132. Study LTS13769 and the ETP of 
studies EFC14028 and ACT14132 are ongoing, the study-specific data cut-off dates are 
as follows: EFC14028: 19 March 2020; ACT14132: 30 September 2019 and LTS13769: 
27 February 2020.

The avalglucosidase alfa safety set consists of pooled avalglucosidase alfa safety data 
from  the  4  clinical  studies  shown  in  Figure  1  up  to the  individual  study’s  data  cut-off 
date.  Data  across  different  doses  of  avalglucosidase  alfa  from  4  clinical  studies  were 
pooled  to  form  the  avalglucosidase  alfa  safety  set  and  presented  by  the  5  patient 
populations:  naïve  patients  (studies  TDR12857/LTS13769,  EFC14028);  experienced 
patients/  previously  treated  with  alglucosidase  alfa  (studies  TDR12857,  LTS13769, 
EFC14028,  and  ACT14132);  adult  patients  (studies  TDR12857/LTS13769  and 
EFC14028);  paediatric  patients  (studies  EFC14028  and  ACT14132);  patients  (studies 
TDR12857/LTS13769, EFC14028, and ACT14132). 
The statistical analyses and reporting from study LTS13769 include all data from lead-
in study TDR12857 and its extension study, LTS13769. 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
In total, 138 patients were treated with investigational medicinal product (IMP); 20/138 
were paediatric patients. For all patients, mean cumulative exposure to avalglucosidase 
alfa was 274.2 patient years. Majority of patients (73.2%) had ≥48 weeks of exposure 
to  avalglucosidase  alfa;  17  patients  (12.3%)  had  ≥ 240  weeks  of  exposure.  Mean 
exposure  was  higher  in  naïve  patients  (122.35  weeks)  than  in  experienced  patients 
(88.87 weeks), and higher in adult patients (111.16 weeks) than in paediatric patients 
(59.47 weeks). 
Highest total exposure was in patients ≥18 years to <45 years with 133.2 patient years. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Among the avalglucosidase alfa safety pool, a majority of patients (91.3% [126/138]), 
reported at least one treatment emergent adverse event  (TEAE) during the treatment 
period,  a  greater  proportion  of  these  patients  being  alglucosidase  alfa  naïve  patients 
(95.1% [58/61]) compared with experienced patients (88.3% [68/77]) (see Table 31). 
The same trend was observed for TEAEs or SAEs “potentially related” to avalglucosidase 
alfa (49.2% [30/61] vs 45.5% [35/77]; 8.2% [5/61] vs 0, respectively). See Table 31.

TEAE: treatment-emergent adverse event. 
The patient year is calculated as time from first avalglucosidase alfa infusion to the time of first event; for patients without 
event, it is calculated as time from first avalglucosidase alfa infusion to the last administration + 4 weeks (28 days). EAIR 
= 100*number of patients/person year in each category. 
a  Potentially related to avalglucosidase alfa as assessed by the investigator as "Related" or "Possibly Related" in 
eCRF. 
b  Does not include the TEAE leading to death. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) 
AESIs  included  infusion  associated  reaction  (IAR),  pregnancy,  symptomatic  overdose 
(EFC14028 and ACT14132) /overdose (LTS13769) and laboratory values meeting pre-
specified criteria. Around 37.7% (52/138 patients) of patients receiving avalglucosidase 
alfa  had  1  or  more  AESIs;  no  differences  were  seen  between  the  four  groups  (naïve 
patients:  37.7%;  experienced  patients:  37.7%;  adult  patients:  39.0%;  paediatric 
patients:  30.0%).  Comparing  avalgulcosidase  alfa  treated  patients  with  alglucosidase 
treated  patients  in  study  EFC14028,  during  the  PAP,  13  (25.5%)  patients  in  the

avalglucosidase  alfa  group  and  18  (36.7%)  patients  in  the  alglucosidase  alfa  group 
reported AESI with similar PT.  
In total, 9 pregnancies were reported in the avalglucosidase alfa treated population as 
of 11 January 2021: 5 patient pregnancies and 4 partner pregnancies. This is further 
discussed in 2.6.8.6. There were no cases of (symptomatic) overdose reported.  
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Treatment emergent serious AEs were reported in 22.9% (27/118) of the adult and 40% 
(8/20)  of  the  paediatric  population.  Most  treatment  emergent  serious  adverse  events 
(TESAEs)  from  the  paediatric  population  (25%)  were  classified  in  SOC  Infections  and 
Infestations. In the adult population, SOCs with most TESAEs were Respiratory, thoracic 
and mediastinal disorders (5.1%) and Nervous system disorders (4.2%). Five out of 138 
subjects (3.6%) reported a total of 9 TESAEs potentially related to avalglucosidase, all 
of  them  were  naïve  adult  subjects;  neither  paediatric  patients  nor  experienced  adult 
subjects  reported  TESAEs  related  to  IMP.  All  but  one  TESAEs  potentially  related  to 
avalglucosidase were manageable within one day, only respiratory distress lasted for 3 
days, but was also manageable.  
A tendency towards lower proportion of patients with TESAEs in the avalglucosidase alfa 
group (15.7%) than in the alglucosidase alfa group (24.5%) (data PAP EFC14028) was 
noticed, however, numbers of patients are currently too limited to provide robust and 
conclusive interpretation of the data. 
Overall,  the  percentage  of  patients  receiving  avalglucosidase  alfa  and  experiencing 
TESAEs potentially related to IMP was very low, and all of them were manageable.  
According to patient narratives, in study EFC14028, 2 patients treated with alglucosidase 
and  none  in  the  avalglucosidase  arm  died:  one  subject  had  an  acute  myocardial 
infarction and another subject had an adenocarcinoma pancreas. Both events were not 
related to study treatment.  
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Blood pressure parameters 
During EFC14028 study, some of fluctuations in PCSAs for systolic and diastolic blood 
pressure and heart rate were related to concomitant IARs and some others led to the 
reporting of a related event, while the remaining ones were not considered as clinically 
significant.  
ECG parameters 
Eighty  adult  patients  who  had  at  least  one  ECG  with  a  QRS  duration  >100 ms  were 
identified. These included 2 patients who were never treated with avalglucosidase alfa 
and were not in the pooled datasets for the safety analyses in the avalglucosidase alfa 
safety set, defined as all randomized or enrolled patients who received at least 1 infusion 
(partial  or  total)  of  avalglucosidase  alfa,  regardless  of  the  amount  of  treatment 
administered.  Among  the  69  adult  patients  who  had  at  least  one  ECG  with  a  QRS 
duration >100 ms, but no QRS duration ≥120 ms, 16 patients had at least one cardiac 
event. Amongst those, 3 patients had events that were assessed as related to treatment,

i.e.:  tachycardia  reported  as  IAR  on  day  72,  resolved  after  7  minutes,  heart  rate 
increased reported with other events as IAR on day 1009, resolved after 84 minutes,  
ventricular extrasystoles reported as IAR on day 351, resolved after 100 minutes. For 
the 11 adult patients who had at least one ECG with a QRS duration ≥120 ms, 4 patients 
had at least one cardiac event, amongst whom 1 patient with  chest discomfort, causally 
related IAR on day 504, no difference in ECGs from before the infusion, resolved after 
59 minutes .  
Thirty-five  adult  patients who  had  at least one  ECG  with  a  QTc interval  >450  ms  (by 
Bazett’s 
formula)  were 
identified.  One  adult  patient  was  never  treated  by 
avalglucosidase alfa and was not in the pooled datasets for the pooled safety analyses 
on avalglucosidase alfa treatment. Among the 35 adult patients who had at least one 
ECG with a QTc interval >450 ms (by Bazett’s formula), 11 patients had at least one 
cardiac event. Amongst those, 3 patients had events that were assessed as related to 
treatment,  i.e.:  tachycardia  reported  as  IAR  on  day  72,  resolved  after  7  minutes; 
ventricular extrasystoles reported as IAR on day 351, resolved after 100 minutes; chest 
discomfort,  causally  related  IAR  on  day  504,  no  difference  in  EKGs  from  before  the 
infusion, resolved after 59 minutes. 
Two paediatric patients who had at least one ECG with a QRS duration >100 and <120 
ms were identified. One patient had 2 cardiac events of pericardial effusion and heart 
rate  increased;  neither  of  the  events  was  assessed  as  causally  related  by  the 
investigator.  
Twelve paediatric patients who had at least one ECG with a QTc interval >450 ms (by 
Bazett’s  formula)  including  1  paediatric  patient,  who  had  not  been  treated  by 
avalglucosidase alfa and is not in the pooled datasets for the pooled safety analyses on 
avalglucosidase alfa treatment. Among the 12 paediatric patients who had at least one 
ECG  with  a  QTc  interval  >450  ms  (by  Bazett’s  formula),  2  patients  had  at  least  one 
cardiac event (1 patient had pericardial effusion and heart rate increased; 1 patient had 
presyncope);  neither  of  these  events  was  assessed  as  causally  related  by  the 
investigator.  
Hematology 
In  patients  with  normal  baseline  values,  the  number  of  patients  who  had  PCSAs  in 
hematology  parameters  are  as  follows:  decreased  WBC  count  (5  paediatric  patients), 
increased WBC count (1 paediatric patient), increased lymphocytes (2 adult patients), 
increased eosinophils (1 paediatric patient), decreased hemoglobin (3 adult patients and 
1 paediatric patient), increased hemoglobin (1 adult patient), decreased hematocrit (8 
adult  patients  and  1  paediatric  patient),  increased  hematocrit  (1  paediatric  patient), 
increased  platelets  (1  paediatric  patient),  increased  monocytes  (6  adult  patients), 
increased RBC count (2 adult patients), and increased basophils (26 adult patients). 
PCSAs  of  increased  basophil  counts  were  observed  in  26  patients  who  received 
avalglucosidase alfa (26.3% [26/99]). Normal range values of basophil count for 25/26 
patients (0-0.2 G/L) vs PCSA values defined as abnormal (<0.1 G/L which is below the 
ULN) were noted.

For patients who had normal baseline values for ALT and AST, 9 of 115 (7.8%) patients 
had post-baseline values of >3 × ULN for ALT and 7 of 107 (6.5%) patients had post-
baseline values of >3 × ULN for AST. For ALT, 2 of 115 (1.7%) adult patients had post-
baseline values >10 × ULN, and 1 of 107 (0.9%) adult patients had a post-baseline AST 
value of >10 × ULN.  For ALP, 1 of 135 (0.7%) adult patients had post-baseline values 
>1.5 ULN. Four of 135 (3.0%) adult patients had a post-baseline value >1.5 ULN for 
total  bilirubin;  no  patient  had  a  postbaseline  value  >2  ×  ULN  for  total  bilirubin.  No 
patient met the criteria of a potential Hy’s law case (ie, ALT ≥3 × ULN and total bilirubin 
>2 × ULN). 
In  the  EFC14028  study  PAP,  the  number  of  patients  with  PCSAs  for  ALT,  AST,  and 
creatinine  was  greater  in  the  avalglucosidase  alfa  group  in  comparison  to  the 
alglucosidase  alfa  group.  The  Applicant  also  underlined  that  most  of  the  PCSAs  were 
observed in patients with elevated baseline values of ALT or AST, that reflects the muscle 
damage related to the underlying disease, explaining that only a few were considered 
as AESIs. Some increases in AST and ALT during TDR12857/LTS13769 were mentioned 
as unrelated to avalglucosidase alfa and considered as related to the underlying disease. 
While the Applicant also outlined a positive signal of the effect of avalglucosidase alfa 
on muscle damage through some decreased CK and liver function test values. 
Over time, both mean values of ALT and AST tend to decrease with a narrowing in the 
range  of  the  values.  Intercurrent  illnesses  like  infections  treated  with  antibiotics, 
treatments  with  analgesics  or  treatment  of  manifestations  and  complications  of  the 
underlying Pompe disease are reported by some, but not for all patients. There was one 
related  TEAE  of  Hepatic  enzyme 
increased 
in  one  subject  during  study 
TDR12857/LTS13769.  The  subject  recovered,  remained  in  the  study  and  had  no 
recurrence  of  the  event.  Other  patients  with  reported  TEAEs  of  Alanine  or  Aspartate 
aminotransferase  increased  have  also  been  reviewed  suggesting  no  apparent  pattern 
regarding time or contributing factors that raises concerns.  
Total Bilirubin values were generally within the normal range throughout the treatment 
periods; there is a slight increase in the mean values for the patients who have been in 
the studies for a long time. The review of the 7 patients did not reveal for any of them 
a concurrent increase in ALT or AST and no reported liver-related medical history. The 
5 patients from studies ACT14032 and EFC14028 had elevated Total Bilirubin values only 
on  2  or  3 occasions,  which  are  separated  in  the  studies  by  long  periods  with  normal 
values. The 3 patients from study TDR12857/LTS13769 presented with elevated Total 
Bilirubin values more frequently, but not for all measurements of Total Bilirubin, and the 
non-elevated Total Bilirubin values are all within the normal range; the elevated values 
of Total Bilirubin have all been assessed by the investigators as clinically non Significant. 
The review suggested Gilbert’s syndrome in two patients, although this was not reported 
in the medical history.  
Over time, creatinine also showed no large variation during the course of the studies. 
The increase of creatinine in one subject in study TDR12857 was apparently an isolated 
event; the patient had no similar events during the remaining study duration. The review 
of a second patient from the same study with a TEAE Blood creatinine increased also 
appeared to be an isolated event.

Urinalysis 
No  patients  had  abnormal  urinalysis  parameters  while  on  treatment  that  were 
considered clinically meaningful. 
2.6.8.5.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for safety 
No data have been submitted regarding in vitro biomarker test for patient selection for 
safety. 
2.6.8.6.  Safety in special populations 
No formal studies were conducted in special populations. According to the applicant, 
the disposition of avalglucosidase alfa, an ERT, is not expected to be impacted by renal 
or hepatic function. Furthermore based on the review of literature, non-clinical and 
clinical data the possibility of a risk of hepatic and/or renal toxicity from the 
breakdown of the synthetic linker is unlikely.

Five age groups were analysed: 0 to <6 years, ≥6 to <18 years, ≥18 to <45 years, ≥45 to <65 years, and ≥65 
years. Highest percentages of both TEAEs and SAEs potentially related to avalglucosidase alfa were reported 
in  age  groups    ≥45  to  <65  years  and  ≥65  years  with  over  50%  experiencing  TEAEs  potentially  related  to 
avalglucosidase  alfa,  and  4.3%  and  11.8%  experiencing  SAEs  potentially  related  to  avalglucosidase  alfa, 
respectively. No SAEs potentially related to avalglucosidase alfa were reported in children and adolescents.  
There are no obvious differences between male and female regarding percentage of patients who had TEAEs 
that were potentially related to avalglucosidase alfa (47.3% [35/74]) and 46.9% [30/64], respectively) and 
those who experienced SAEs (24.3% [18/74] and 26.6% [17/64], respectively). SAEs potentially related to 
avalglucosidase alfa were very rare in both males and females (2.7% [2/74]) and 4.7% [3/64], respectively). 
Most  subjects  were  white,  hence,  no  comparisons  could  be  made  with  other  races.  The  percentage  of  all 
patients, who had TEAEs potentially related to avalglucosidase alfa by duration of the disease was also analysed.  
Overall, none of the intrinsic factor subgroups analysed (age, gender, race, duration of disease) seem to be at 
higher risk for TEAEs. 
No  conclusion  can  be  drawn  from  analysing  extrinsic  factor  “region”  as  numbers  of  patients  from  different 
regions were very small. 
In total, 9 pregnancies were reported in the clinical development program as of 11 January 2021: 5 patient 
pregnancies and 4 partner pregnancies. Of the 9 pregnancies, 4 resulted in live birth (2 patient and 2 partner 
pregnancies), 3 abortions (2 patient and 1 partner pregnancies), and 2 were of unknown outcome (2 partner 
pregnancies).  
No patterns or trends in reported events associated with dependence or abuse were identified. 
2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
In both LOPD and IOPD patients, the incidence of treatment emergent antibodies is quite high and there is also 
a clear trend for increased occurance of IARs as well as hypersensitivity, which correlates with the increase of 
ADA titers measured. See Table 32.

ADA evaluable population in avalglucosidase alfa safety set will be used for the immunogenicity analyses. It is defined as all randomized 
or enrolled patients who received at least 1 infusion (partial or completed) of avalglucosidase alfa and had at least one ADA sample taken 
post-baseline after avalglucosidase alfa infusion that is appropriate for ADA testing with a reportable result.

Updated immunogenicity data covered the overall treatment period during which the majority of IOPD patients 
received 40 mg/kg qow avalglucosidase after the initial 25 week period. One additional patient had treatment-
boosted anti-avalglucosidase alfa ADAs and 4 additional patients had treatment-induced anti-avalglucosidase 
alfa  ADAs.  Unlike  observed  before,  one IOPD  patient  developed  neutralizing  anti-avalglucosidase  alfa  ADAs. 
Antiavalglucosidase  alfa  ADAs  increased  in  some  patients  but  none  of  the  patients  developed  a  high  ADA 
response ≥12,800. 
No fatal events, related SAEs nor anaphylaxis cases (as defined by Sampson upon case review) were reported 
to  date  and  no  patients  have  discontinued  the  study.  All  IARs  were  reported  as  non-serious  and  mild  to 
moderate  in  severity  and  the  majority  of  IARs  events  were  reported  by  a  few  patients,  without  established 
relationship  with  ADA  titers.  However,  limited  number  of  IOPD  patients  hampers  the  interpretability  of  the 
results and due to the fact that immunogenicity of avalglucosidase in treatment-naïve IOPD patients has not 
been studied yet, robust data in order to support the dose of 40 mg/kg qow are still missing. Increasing amount 
of data from paediatric patients are needed to allow a meaningful assessment of ADA responses taking into 
account  administered  dose  differences  of  avalglucosidase  treatment  in  paediatric  patients.  Sufficient 
information about several approaches regarding immune modulation treatment strategies including rituximab, 
methotrexate  and  intravenous  immunoglobulin  in  a  prophylactic  and  therapeutic  setting  were  provided  as 
relevant ITI regiment for naïve or experienced patients. 
2.6.8.8.  Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
 No drug-drug interaction studies have been conducted, which is considered acceptable by the CHMP.  
2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
The rate of discontinuation in avalglucosidase treated patients was low: 4/138 patients had TEAEs that led to 
discontinuation of IMP; all were naïve, adult from 3 different studies (TDR12857, EFC14028, and LTS13769). 
In  comparison,  3/49  patients  in  the  alglucosidase  group  from  study  EFC14028  withdrew  from  the  study;  2 
patients due to IARs related to study treatment, the other one died of acute myocardial infarction which was 
not related to study treatment.

Events in two patients receiving avalglucosidase alfa were considered related to IMP and were the reason for 
discontinuation: one of them experienced TESAEs (respiratory distress and chest discomfort), the other one 
experienced non-serious TEAEs of ocular hyperaemia and erythema. All TEAEs related to avalglucosidase alfa 
leading to permanent treatment discontinuation are included in 4.4 and/or 4.8 of the proposed SmPC. 
Overall, in both treatment groups, TEAEs related to IMP leading to discontinuation of study participation were 
IARs.   
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
There is no postmarketing experience available since avalglucosidase alfa is not approved in any country at 
the present time. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
From all clinical studies, a safety pool of 138 patients treated with avalglucosidase administered by IV infusions 
(LOPD  and  IOPD  patients)  was  analysed.  The  mean  cumulative  exposure  to  avalglucosidase  alfa  was  274.2 
patient years. The majority of patients (73.2%) had ≥48 weeks of exposure to avalglucosidase alfa; 17 patients 
(12.3%) had ≥240 weeks of exposure.  
Fifty percent of adult reported TEAEs potentially related to avalglucosidase treatment. In the adult population, 
these  were  mainly  TEAEs  of  the  System  Organ  Classes  (SOCs)  General  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions, Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, Gastrointestinal disorders, and Nervous system disorders.  
The three of most frequent TEAEs (all patients) were nasopharyngitis, headache, and diarrhoea.  
There was no difference in percentage of patients experiencing TEAEs potentially related to study drug neither 
in experienced (45.5%) vs naïve (49.2%) patients nor in patients receiving avalglucosidase alfa (45.1%) vs 
alglucosidase alfa (49.0%). These data from avalglucosidase alfa vs alglucosidase alfa are from PAP of study 
EFC14028 only. 
These  adverse  events  are  consistent  with  those  reported  in  patients  treated  with  the  active  comparator 
alglucosidase  alfa  in  thePAP  of  study  EFC14028.  Treatment  emergent  serious  AEs  were  reported  in  22.9% 
(27/118) of the adult and 40% (8/20) of the paediatric population. Most TEAEs from the paediatric population 
(25%) were classified in SOC Infections and Infestations but were unrelated to IMP. In the adult population, 
SOCs  with  most  TEAEs  were  Respiratory,  thoracic  and  mediastinal  disorders  (5.1%)  and  Nervous  system 
disorders (4.2%). 5/138 subjects (3.6%) reported a total of 9 TESAEs potentially related to avalglucosidase, 
all  of  them  were  naïve  adult  subjects;  neither  paediatric  patients  nor  experienced  adult  subjects  reported 
TESAEs related to IMP. All but one TESAEs potentially related to avalglucosidase were manageable within one 
day; only respiratory distress lasted for 3 days, but was also manageable. The percentage of patients receiving 
avalglucosidase alfa and experiencing TESAEs potentially related to IMP was very low, and all of them were 
manageable.  
In addition, IARs were reported by 26.1% of all patients studied, mostly 0-2 hours after infusion started; 
again, no difference was seen between the four groups (naïve, experienced, adult, paediatric). Most 
frequently reported IARs for all patients was pruritus, rash, and urticaria. Avalglucosidase alfa related TEAEs 
reported in ≤2 patients were further analysed to ensure that the SmPC adequately report TEAEs (PTs) <2% 
in all patients.  
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 133/230 
 
 
 
Anaphylactic reactions were reported by 8 patients, 4 naïve and 4 experienced patients. Hypersensitivity was 
experienced  by  60  patients,  and  the  percentage  of  patients  experiencing  hypersensitivity  was  comparable 
between naïve, experienced and adult patient group. Six of the 60 patients experiencing hypersensitivity had 
hypersensitivity events that were considered by the Investigator to be severe, a TESAE, or both. There was no 
difference between percentage of patients experiencing anaphylactic reactions in the avalglucosidase alfa group 
(3.9%) vs alglucosidase alfa group (4.1%) during the PAP of study EFC14028. Two cases of anaphylaxis leading 
to withdrawel of study drug and study drug interruption, respectively, occurred in study TDR12857. In study 
EFC14028,  the  applicant  claims  that  a  numerically  lower  risk  of  IARs  was  seen  with  avalglucosidase  alfa. 
Percentage of patients reporting at least one IAR was indeed lower in the avalglucosidase alfa group (25.5%) 
than in  the alglucosidase alfa group (32.7%) However, looking at the actual numbers (13/51 patients in the 
avalglucosidase  group  reported  at  least  one  IAR  compared  to  16/49  patients  in  the  alglucosidase  group), 
difference between the two groups is rather small and interpretation is limited due to the small sample size. 
Overall, data do not show a better safety profile in avalglucosidase group compared to alglucosidase treated 
patients and  the limited data do not allow firm conclusions. Postmarketing data may further characterise the 
overall safety profile of avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa. 
The  percentage  of  abortions  was  relatively  high.  The  review  of  the  2  patients  in  the  clinical  development 
program  for  avalglucosidase  alfa  as  well  as  the  2  patients  from  the  Pregnancy  Sub-Registry  in  the  Pompe 
Registry with spontaneous abortion, did not show any particular pattern. Of the 2 patients from the Pregnancy 
Sub-Registry, one was treated with alglucosidase alfa at the time when she was found to be pregnant, while 
the  other  patient  was  not  being  treated.  The  small  sample  sizes  do  not  allow  robust  conclusions,  while  the 
numbers in comparison to the overall sample of the patients enrolled in either the study program or the Pompe 
Registry appear consistent with the numbers reported in the literature. In addition, the pre-clinical data do not 
provide  any  supportive  evidence  for  a  potential  causal  association  of  the  reported  miscarriages  and  the 
treatment with avalglucosidase alfa.  The inclusion of an additional text in the SmPC Section 4.6 is thus not 
warranted. Pregnancies are listed as reasons for temporary treatment discontinuation and are not considered 
as  protocol  deviations  in  studies  LTS13769  and  EFC14028;  lactating  women  are  excluded  per  protocol. 
Moreover additional information on special populations of interest such as pregnant or lactating women treated 
with  avalglucosidase  alfa  are  planned  to  be  collected  as  part  of  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  (see 
2.7). 
Overall, none of the intrinsic factor subgroups analysed (age, gender, race, duration of disease) seem to be at 
higher risk for TEAEs. No dosage adjustment is thus proposed in the SmPC.  Further data are expected to be 
collected  with  the  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  to  further  characterise  the  safety  and  this  is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP (see 2.7). 
Effects on the ability to drive or operate machinery are generally not expected based on the presented safety 
profile. However, in the proposed SmPC, dizziness was reported as IAR, which might affect the ability and use 
of machines on the day of the infusion. In the avalglucosidase alfa safety set, 13% reported TEAE dizziness. 
Section 4.7 of the SmPC mentioned that Nexviadyme may have a minor influence on the ability to drive and 
use machines. 
The CHMP considers that no unexpected safety concerns arise from the safety data with avalglucosidase alfa. 
IARs, anaphylactic reactions, and hypersensitivity are sufficiently described in the proposed SmPC. Even if the 
Applicant concludes that  IARs and hypersensitivity events are manageable, immunogenicity and the risk of 
IARs/hypersensitivity should be closely monitored in the post-marketing setting, especially due to the small 
number of patients (see section 2.7). In the ETS period of study ACT14132, only one patient out of 6, who 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 134/230 
 
 
 
 
received  20  mg/kg  avalglucosidase  alfa,  developed  a  transient  ADA  response,  whereas  in  the  cohort,  who 
received 40 mg/kg, 5 out of 10 patients (50%) developed treatment emergent ADA response.  
The  limited  number  of  IOPD  patients  hampers  the  interpretability  of  the  results  and  due  to  the  fact  that 
immunogenicity of avalglucosidase in treatment-naïve IOPD patients has not been studied yet, robust data in 
order to support a starting dose of 40 mg/kg qow are still missing. Increasing amount of data from paediatric 
patients are needed to allow a meaningful assessment of ADA responses taking into account administered dose 
differences of avalglucosidase treatment in paediatric patients. Sufficient information about several approaches 
regarding  immune  modulation  treatment  strategies  including  rituximab,  methotrexate  and  intravenous 
immunoglobulin in a prophylactic and therapeutic setting were provided as relevant ITI regimens for naïve or 
experienced patients. However, careful observation in the ongoing clinical trials and further studies is expected, 
especially with the use of the higher dose of 40 mg/kg. All these events shall be followed upon post-marketing 
and presented in the respective PSURs.  
At this time point, no conclusion can be drawn on whether or not avalglucosidase alfa has a different or better 
safety profile than alglucosidase alfa. This is mainly due to the limited safety database.  
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Assessment of paediatric data on clinical safety 
For safety assessment, 20 paediatric patients treated with avalglucosidase alfa, 6 (30%) in the age range 0 to 
<6  and  14  (70%)  in  the  age  range  ≥  6  to  <18  were  included.  All  but  one  paediatric  patient  exposed  to 
avalglucosidase alfa were part of study ACT14132. All paediatric patients were treatment-experienced, and all 
but one were diagnosed with IOPD (one patient with LOPD); no data on treatment naïve IOPD patients are 
available. 
Even though the number of paediatric patients is limited, total number of patients exposed to IMP is relatively 
high, also for exposure more than 6 months. In comparison, only 22 patients treated with Myozyme provided 
safety data, none of them were treated more than 6 months. Therefore, it was suggested to establish a registry 
in order to follow all treated (and ideally some untreated) patients. The Sanofi Genzyme Pompe Registry was 
established in 2004 to track the natural history and treatment outcomes of patients, both treated and not. This 
registry is still ongoing. A total of 2254 patients were enrolled in the Pompe Registry as of 01 May 2020, 390 
patients with IOPD and 1640 patients with LOPD. 
Thirty percent of paediatric patients reported TEAEs potentially related to avalglucosidase treatment. In the 
paediatric population, most TEAEs reported were reported in the SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. 
In the paediatric population upper respiratory tract infections, rash, and pyrexia were the three most reported 
TEAEs. 
No  paediatric  patient  experienced  anaphylactic  reactions.  A  slightly  higher  percentage  of  paediatric  patients 
experienced hypersensitivity as compared to the naïve, experienced and adult groups. 
No unexpected safety concerns arise from the safety data with avalglucosidase alfa. 
Data regarding the dosing regimen 40 mg/kg qow in IOPD patients (cohort 2 and avalglucosidase arm in cohort 
3) are rather sparse. No conclusive pattern could be identified with regards to occurrence/increase of adverse 
events in comparison to 20 mg/kg qow treated paediatric patients.

Home infusion 
To support home infusion, some clinical data, from a preliminary home infusion report with Myozyme in the 
Netherlands in adult LOPD patients, were presented.  
To further justify the implementation of home infusion, the applicant presented new data from the ongoing 
studies related to immunologic events, IAR or emergency situations. As of 31 May 2021, 15 patients have 
ever received home infusion in trials (LTS13769 [N = 2], EFC14028 [N = 11] and ACT14132 [N = 2]). Only 
one case of non-serious events was reported at the first administration at home (eyelid edema and flushing), 
which was treated appropriately and resolved at the same day. After administration of further infusions at the 
study site under monitoring, home infusion could be resumed without occurrence of further IAR events. 
Current data do not indicate an increased risk of IARs or medication errors with home infusion in adults. For 
IOPD patients, no data on home infusion were available yet. Six unrelated non-serious AEs in 2 other patients 
in EFC14028 and 1 unrelated on-serious AE in 1 patient in LTS13769 were reported. No medication error 
occurred in the setting of home infusion. 
The applicant proposed to reflect in section 4.2 of the SmPC the population eligible to receive home infusion. 
These are patients who are tolerating their infusions well and have no history of moderate or severe IARs for 
a few months. The decision to have a patient move to home infusion should be made after evaluation and 
upon recommendation by the treating physician. The following criteria should be considered: 
• 
• 
• 
The patient must have no ongoing concurrent condition that, in the opinion of the physician, may 
affect patient’s ability to tolerate the infusion. 
The patient is considered medically stable. A comprehensive evaluation must be completed before the 
initiation of home infusion. 
The patient must have received Nexviadyme infusions supervised by a physician with expertise in 
management of Pompe patients for a few months that could be in a hospital or in another appropriate 
setting of outpatient care. Documentation of a pattern of well-tolerated infusions with no IARs, or 
mild IARs that have been controlled with premedication, is a prerequisite for the initiation of home 
infusion. 
• 
The patient must be willing and able to comply with home infusion procedures.  
•  Home infusion infrastructure, resources, and procedures, including training, must be established and 
available to the healthcare professional. The healthcare professional should be available at all times 
during the home infusion and a specified time after-infusion, depending on patient’s tolerance prior to 
starting home infusion.  
The SmPC also recommends that if the patient experiences adverse reactions during the home infusion, the 
infusion process should be stopped immediately and appropriate medical treatment should be initiated (see 
section 4.4). Subsequent infusions may need to occur in a hospital or in an appropriate setting of outpatient 
care until no such adverse reaction is present. Dose and infusion rate must not be changed without 
consulting the responsible physician.

The CHMP acknowledged that home infusion is an established practice for some other ERTs.  Based on the 
submitted data, the proposed SmPC recommendations regarding home infusion is considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. A mix-up with Alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme) will be counteracted with different colours of the 
brand name, outer packing and caps. In addition additional risk minimisations are introduced to ensure safe 
and effective use of avalglucosidase alfa under this specific setting. These actions are considered appropriate. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the SmPC. 
Appropriate measures including additional pharmacovigilance activities and risk minimisation activities (see 
2.7) have been put in place to ensure safe and effective use of the product in the recommended indication.

2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  Product information 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021

2.9.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reason: vial 
label does not have the space necessary to display all required information in a suitable and readable font 
size.  
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-
shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
2.9.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nexviadyme (avalglucosidase alfa) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it is a biological product, which will be authorised after 1 January 2011. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Avalglucosidase alfa is intended for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of patients 
with Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase deficiency). 
Pompe disease is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by the deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-
glucosidase (GAA). Defects in both alleles of the gene for GAA, located on chromosome 17q25, result in reduced 
or absent enzyme activity, leading to progressive intralysosomal accumulation of undegraded glycogen. The 
resulting damage to affected cells produces a range of symptoms that characterize Pompe disease, including 
metabolic myopathy leading to neuromuscular dysfunction and ultimately death.  
Currently, over 500 mutations of GAA, including missense, nonsense, splicing defect, and frameshift mutations, 
have been found. According to the variety of mutations, clinical presentation of Pompe disease is heterogeneous 
in timing, severity, and ranges of symptoms observed. The disease is classified into different phenotypes based 
on age at onset of symptoms, extent of organ involvement, and rate of progression to death. The phenotypes 
range from a rapidly progressive infantile-onset form (IOPD) characterized by virtually complete absence (less 
than 1%) of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)-activity to a more slowly progressive late-onset form (LOPD).  
Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), which represents up to one third of the cases, becomes manifest in the 
first months of life. Affected patients present with creatinine kinase elevations, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(HCM), failure to thrive, muscular hypotonia and axial muscle weakness. IOPD is rapidly progressive, and the 
majority of untreated subjects die within the first year of life due to a combination of ventilatory and cardiac 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 143/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
failure without achieving any motor milestones such as turning, sitting, or standing. Survival beyond the age 
of 18 months is exceptional.  
The majority of patients with Pompe disease present after infancy with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), which 
takes  a  more  variable  course.  In  untreated  patients,  undegraded  glycogen  accumulates  in  diaphragm  and 
respiratory muscles, and respiratory function declines over time, leading to dependence to external ventilation 
and, ultimately, to respiratory failure which is the most common cause of death regardless of age of disease 
onset.  Glycogen  also  accumulates  in  skeletal  muscles,  and  motor  function  declines  over  time,  leading  to 
problems with activities of daily living, reduced mobility, and eventually dependence on wheelchair. Quality of 
life is usually severely affected by the burden of the disease. 
The estimated global incidence of Pompe disease is 1:40 000, with variations in incidence reported between 
different  ethnic  groups  and  clinical  forms.  Avalglucosidase  alfa  gained  Orphan  designation  in  2014  with  an 
estimated number of affected patients below 1/10,000 people in the EU, equivalent to around 51,000 people. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Development and approval of ERT has profoundly changed the natural course of the disease, revealing new 
phenotypes in patients with classical IOPD who survive with ERT, and considerably extending productivity and 
quality of life for patients with LOPD. However, it is recognized that the progressive decline in muscle function 
in patients with Pompe disease is not completely abrogated with alglucosidase alfa ERT. 
Studies in LOPD patients suggest that some patients on alglucosidase alfa continue to exhibit some decline in 
respiratory function, albeit at a slower pace than prior to treatment. Responses to treatment in LOPD patients 
vary and there might be room for improvement in individual patients, but overall there is not a huge unmet 
medical need in this population.  
With  respect  to  IOPD  patients,  literature  data  (Chien  et  al,  2015)  indicate  that  some  patients  treated  with 
Myozyme  exhibit  declines in  motor  function  and  mobility  starting  at 18-24  months  of  age,  despite  an initial 
decrease in CK levels. The reasons for the variable efficacy of ERT and the progression of disease with time are 
manifold and only imperfectly understood. Known factors include age at start of therapy and pre-treatment 
muscle pathology, CRIM-status and antibody titers, distribution of type I and II fibers, and altered autophagy 
(Kishnani et al., 2012). 
Although ERT has substantially improved the prognosis of IOPD, mortality is still considerable, and decline of 
motor function over time is frequent in long-term survivors. Thus, further efforts  are  necessary  to  improve  
the  outcome  of  children  affected  by  this  most  severe form of Pompe disease, indicating an unmet medical 
need in IOPD patients deteriorating on the available ERT. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study EFC14028 (COMET) in LOPD population 
The  main  evidence  of  efficacy  comes  from  a  single  phase  III  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind  study 
comparing avalglucosidase alfa (n=51) to alglucosidase alfa (n=49) in treatment-naïve LOPD patients from 3 
years of age. The study comprises a primary analysis period (49 weeks) followed by an extended treatment 
period. The primary objective of study EFC14028 was to determine the effect of avalglucosidase alfa treatment

on respiratory muscle strength as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC)% predicted in the upright position, 
as compared to alglucosidase alfa.  
The primary statistical objective was to test the non-inferiority (NI) of avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase 
alfa at 5% level of significance. The non-inferiority (NI) of avalglucosidase alfa to alglucosidase alfa was to be 
investigated first before progressing to investigation of superiority. 
Secondary objectives were to determine the safety and effect of avalglucosidase alfa treatment on functional 
endurance  (6MWT,  key  secondary  endpoint),  inspiratory  muscle  strength  (MIP),  expiratory  muscle  strength 
(MEP), lower extremity muscle strength (HHD), motor function (QMFT), and health related quality of life (SF-
12).  
Study ACT14132 (Mini-COMET) in IOPD population 
Additional  evidence  of  efficacy  comes  from  a  multicenter,  multistage  phase  II,  open-label,  ascending  dose 
cohort  study  in  22  patients  under  18  years  of  age  with  IOPD,  who  were  previously  treated  (treatment-
experienced) with alglucosidase alfa for at least 6 months. The study comprises a primary analysis period (week 
25)  followed  by  an  extended  treatment  period.  The  primary  objective  of  the  ACT14132  study  was  the 
assessment  of  safety  and  tolerability  of  administering  avalglucosidase  alfa.  The  secondary  objectives  were 
characterization of the pharmacokinetic profile of avalglucosidase alfa and evaluation of the preliminary efficacy 
of  avalglucosidase  alfa  in  comparison  to  alglucosidase  alfa.  Efficacy  endpoints  in  ACT14132  included  motor 
function  (evaluated  through  functional  and  clinical  outcome  assessments  and  6-minute  walk  test  [6MWT]), 
respiratory function (evaluated through pulmonary functional testing [PFT] and ventilator use questionnaire), 
quality of life, pain, cardiac function (echocardiography) and eyelid position measurements. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
LOPD population 
• 
• 
The main evidence of efficacy and safety is based on a randomized, double-blind, active controlled study 
including 100 patients.  The  active  comparator  was  alglucosidase  alfa,  an  approved  medicinal  product of 
established therapeutic value, and currently the standard of care. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  Phase  3  study  EFC14028  was  met  by  demonstrating  non-inferiority  of 
respiratory function as measured by % predicted FVC as compared to alglucosidase alfa at week 49. In the 
mITT  population,  the  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  49  in  %  predicted  FVC  was  2.89  in  the 
avalglucosidase alfa group and 0.46 in the alglucosidase alfa group. The difference in mean change (from 
baseline to Week 49) of 2.43 with lower boundary of 95% CI of -0.13 exceeded the predefined NI margin 
of -1.1 and thus achieved statistical significance (95% CI: -0.13, 4.99; p=0.0074) 
•  Results  of  a  pre-planned  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  done  in  the  PP  population 
support the non-inferiority conclusion: LS mean difference FVC% predicted at week 49 was 2.69 (95% CI: 
-0.06, 5.44; p=0.0076). 
• 
The LS mean difference in distance walked in meters in the 6MWT (key secondary endpoint) was 30.01 
(95% CI:1.33, 58.69).

•  Subgroup analyses for study EFC14028 (primary efficacy endpoint, % predicted FVC), performed by age 
group  (<18  years,  ≥18  years  to  <45  years,  ≥45  years  old),  gender,  baseline  FVC  groups  (<55%,  and ≥
55%), region, baseline walking device use, baseline 6MWT distance, duration of disease at baseline, and 
race indicate consistency of results across subgroups. 
IOPD population 
The descriptive results of study ACT14132 show positive trends (stabilization or improvement) in secondary 
and  tertiary  efficacy  outcomes  with  avalglucosidase.  During  the  primary  analysis  period  (PAP),  Gross  Motor 
Function  Measure-88  (GMFM-88)  mean  scores  increased  modestly  from  baseline  to  Week  25  in  all  four 
treatment groups (Cohort 1: 2.62, Cohort 2: 3.54, Cohort 3: AVAL: 4.20, AGLU: 6.82) 
Home infusion 
•  As of 31 May 2021, 15 patients have ever received home infusion in trials (LTS13769 [N = 2], EFC14028 
[N = 11] and ACT14132 [N = 2]). Few non-serious events was reported at the first administration at home 
(eyelid edema and flushing), which was treated appropriately and resolved at the same day. Current data 
do not indicate an increased risk of IARs or medication errors with home infusion in adults. No medication 
error occurred in the setting of home infusion. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
LOPD population 
• 
The pivotal trial was performed in adult LOPD patients, only two subjects were below the age of 18 years 
and included a 9 years old patient that was enrolled after the study cut-off date of 10 March 2020. Evidence 
for efficacy and safety of  avalglucosidase in the paediatric population is limited to 22 previously treated 
IOPD patients > 6 months of age in the open-label phase 2 study (ACT14132). 
•  Demonstration of superiority of avalglucosidase alfa over alglucosidase alfa in % predicted FVC at Week 49 
was missed in Study EFC14028 at the 5% significance level (p= 0.0626). Since superiority could not be 
demonstrated  for  the  primary  endpoint,  all  subsequently  planned  statistical  superiority  tests  for  the 
secondary endpoints in the pre-specified hierarchy could formally not be carried out under adequate control 
of the experimentwise type-1-error. 
•  Despite  some  of  the  investigated  efficacy  parameters  showed  a  positive  trend  for  better  outcome  with 
avalglucosidase  alfa;  many  of  these  endpoints  were  correlated  and  are  measured  in  the  same  patients. 
Further  significance  testing  was  also  hampered  by  the  lack  of  demonstration  of  superiority  in  study 
EFC14028. 
• 
The overall performance of alglucosidase alfa (i.e. LS mean change from baseline to Week 49 in FVC %: 
0.46,  in  6MWT:  2.19  meters)  was  notably  poorer  than  in  the  registration  trial  for  alglucosidase  alfa 
(ALGLU02704/LOTS). In the LOTS trial the estimated  change  in  FVC, expressed as a percentage of each 
patient’s predicted  value,  was  an  increase  of  1.2  percentage points at week 78 (1.73 at week 49) for 
the patients who received alglucosidase alfa. Furthermore, patients in the LOTS trial had a mean increase 
of 25.1 m on the 6-minute walk test by week 78. It is however acknowlegded that the results observed in 
the alglucosidase alfa group in Study EFC14028 are likely influenced by a randomized population different 
to the one randomized in Study AGLU02704.

• 
 Data on long-term efficacy are limited. Extended treatment periods of the clinical trials are still ongoing. 
At the cut-off date of 19 March 2020, 91 patients were enrolled in the ongoing ETP; efficacy data at 97 
weeks were available for 24 patients who had since study start continuously received avalglucosidase alfa 
and for 21 patients who switched from alglucosidase alfa to avalglucosidase alfa treatment after 49 weeks.  
After Week 49, FVC slightly decreased in patients continuing with avalglucosidase alfa. 
IOPD population 
• 
There is lack of data in treatment-naive IOPD patients under the age of 6 months. 
•  No formal dose-response studies have been performed. The 20 mg/kg dose was selected based on the 
clinical experience with alglucosidase alfa and results from non-clinical studies and the safety and 
exploratory efficacy results from the ascending dose phase 1 study TDR12857. 
• 
The investigation in IOPD patients is limited to a pre-treated population in study ACT14132 (Mini-COMET), 
including 22 patients (Cohort 1 (n=6): 20 mg/kg AVAL, Cohort 2 (n=5): 40 mg/kg AVAL, Cohort 3 (n=11): 
5 patients 40 mg/kg AVAL and 6 patients AGLU at various doses). The primary objective of the ACT14132 
study was the assessment of safety and tolerability of avalglucosidase alfa. The secondary objectives were 
characterization  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  and  the  evaluation  of  the  preliminary  efficacy  of 
avalglucosidase alfa in comparison to alglucosidase alfa.. The highest improvement was seen in Cohort 3, 
in the alglucosidase alfa group. Consistently to the results of the GMFM-88, the greatest degree of change 
in the Quick motor function test (QMFT)–total score was observed in the alglucosidase alfa group (5.17 vs. 
4.25  in  the  AVAL  group  of  Cohort  3).  Due  to  its  design  and  small  size  the  study  cannot  deliver  firm 
conclusions on avalglucosidase´s efficacy and safety in this setting. Moreover, the  proposed higher starting 
dose in IOPD patients (40 mg/kg) has not been demonstrated to be more suitable than the 20 mg/kg dose 
proposed in LOPD patients. 
• 
IOPD  patients  with  higher  anti-alglucosidase  alfa  antibody  titers  (≥1:25600)  have  been  excluded  from 
clinical studies. 
Home infusion 
•  Home  infusion  is  an  established  practice  for  some  other  ERTs.  However  limited  data  are  available  for 
avalglucosidase alfa and have been supplemented by the clinical experience with alglucosidase alfa. For 
IOPD patients, no data on home infusion are available. The risks related to home infusion is reflected in 
the RMP as important potential risk and will be reported in the PSURs. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
LOPD and IOPD populations 
• 
In  the  ETS  period  of  study  ACT14132,  only  one  patient,  who  received  20  mg/kg  avalglucosidase  alfa, 
developed a transient ADA response, whereas in the cohort, who received 40 mg/kg, 5 out of 10 patients 
(50%) developed a treatment emergent ADA response.  
•  50%  of  adult  and  30%  of  paediatric  patients  reported  TEAEs  potentially  related  to  avalglucosidase 
treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 147/230 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
IARs were reported by 26.1% of all patients studied, mostly 0-2 hours after infusion started. 
•  Anaphylactic reactions were reported by 8 patients, 4 naïve and 4 experienced patients. 
•  Six of the 60 patients experiencing hypersensitivity had hypersensitivity events that were considered by 
the Investigator to be severe, a TESAE, or both. 
•  AVAL IAR events in %: ADA peak titer ≥12 800 (53.8%, 7 of 13 patients) compared to patients with ADA 
titer 1600-6400 (17.2%, 5 of 29 patients), ADA low response titer 100-800 (7.1%, 1 of 14 patients), and 
patients who were ADA negative (33.3%, 1 of 3 patients). 
•  AVAL Hypersensitivity events in %: ADA titers: 100-800 peak titer (14.3%), 1600-6400 peak titer (27.6%) 
and ≥12 800 peak titer (30.8%) 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
IOPD population 
• 
The proposed higher starting dose of 40 mg/kg in IOPD patients is mainly based on recent publications of 
clinical experience in IOPD patients receiving alglucosidase alfa doses greater or at higher frequency than 
the label dose of 20 mg/kg qow (Chien, 2015, J Pediatr; Case, 2015, Neuromusc Disord). So far there are 
only very limited data with 40mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa from study ACT14132 (in total 10 patients in the 
PAP received the 40 mg/kg dose; cut-off date 30 April: during ETP all but 2 patients switched to the 40 
mg/kg AVAL resulting in 20 patients currently treated with the highest dose of 40 mg/kg).  
•  So far, there are no data on avalglucosidase alfa in an ERT treatment naïve IOPD population. Treatment-
experienced IOPD and LOPD patients appear to have some degree of attenuation of immunologic response, 
possibly  due  to  development  of  immunologic  tolerance  given  the  shared  protein  structure  of  aval-  and 
alglucosidase.  
• 
Patients at high-risk for experiencing a severe allergic reaction to avalglucosidase alfa (i.e. patients who 
had previously severe anaphylactic reaction to alglucosidase alfa and/or a history of high sustained IgG 
antibody titers to alglucosidase alfa) were excluded from the phase 2 study in IOPD patients.  
Paediatric LOPD and IOPD populations 
• 
The  number  of  paediatric  patients  is  very  limited:  In  total,  24  paediatric  patients  were  treated  with 
avalglucosidase alfa, 22 IOPD patients, and 2 paediatric/juvenile LOPD patients.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite  some  uncertainties  regarding  effect  size  and  less  severely  affected  studied  population,  efficacy  of 
avalglucosidase  alfa  could  be  convincingly  demonstrated  in  the  phase  3  study  in  LOPD  patients  by  showing 
non-inferiority in % predicted FVC compared to alglucosidase alfa. Although some of the investigated efficacy 
parameters showed a positive trend for better outcome with avalglucosidase alfa, many of these endpoints are 
correlated and are measured in the same patients. Most importantly, however, demonstration of superiority of 
avalglucosidase alfa over alglucosidase alfa in the primary endpoint % predicted FVC at Week 49 was missed 
at the required significance level. Accordingly, all subsequently conducted statistical tests for the secondary 
endpoints in the pre-specified hierarchy could formally not be carried out under adequate experimentwise type-
1-error  control.  Hence,  any  reference  in  the  discussion  of  trial  outcome  for  these  endpoints  indicating  an 
advantage of avalglucosidase alfa over alglucosidase alfa is not permissible and a conclusion of demonstrated 
superiority is not possible.

Additional evidence for the paediatric population solely comes from phase 3 study EFC14028 and the phase 2 
study ACT14132 in previously treated IOPD patient > 6 months. However, due to its design and small size of 
study  ACT14132,  the  study  cannot  deliver  firm  conclusions  on  avalglucosidase´s  efficacy  and  safety  in  this 
setting  at  the  proposed  starting  dose  of  40  mg/kg.  In  particular,  only  one  patient,  who  received  20  mg/kg 
avalglucosidase alfa, developed a transient ADA response, whereas in the cohort, who received 40 mg/kg, 5 
out of 10 patients (50%) developed a treatment emergent ADA response.  
Long term data are limited. Ongoing clinical studies and the extension of the applicant existing Pompe disease 
and Pompe disease Pregnancy sub registries to further characterise the efficacy (especially in the paediatric 
population) and safety of avalglucosidase alfa are thus part of the additional pharmacovigilance activities. In 
addition, a further study is planned in IOPD patients ≤6 months naïve to previous treatment with alglucosidase 
alfa (approximately 16 males and females) and is expected as post-authorisation commitment.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  proposed  indication  includes  paediatric  IOPD  and  LOPD  patients,  in  first  and  second  line  of  treatment. 
Results  from  the  pivotal  study  in  adult  LOPD  naïve  patients  showed  that  avalglucosidase  is  non-inferior  to 
alglucosidase alfa at a 20 mg/kg dose with an acceptable safety profile. Extrapolation from adult to paediatric 
LOPD and IOPD patients is considered acceptable, since the pathophysiology of the disease, the mechanism 
of  action,  and  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  enzyme  replacement  therapy  (ERT)  for  Pompe  Disease  are 
comparable across the whole disease spectrum. 
In  IOPD  patients,  the  results  of  study  ACT14132  show  positive  trends  in  secondary  and  tertiary  efficacy 
outcomes  with  avalglucosidase.  However,  subgroups  of  patients  receiving  different  concentrations  of 
avalglucosidase alfa in study ACT14132 were very small and clinical response varies greatly between patients. 
Moreover, beneficial effects are not consistently in favour of patients initially treated with avalglucosidase alfa 
40 mg/kg and a clear dose response relationship could not be demonstrated. Thus, a higher starting dose was 
not recommended by the CHMP. However, for IOPD patients who experience lack of improvement or insufficient 
response in cardiac, respiratory, and/or motor function while receiving 20 mg/kg, a dose increase to 40 mg/kg 
every other week can  be considered in the absence of safety concerns.  
Overall, based on the submitted data, a positive benefit risk can be concluded for the LOPD and IOPD 
populations with recommended dose of 20 mg/kg for LOPD and a starting dose of 20 mg/kg with possible 
increase to 40 mg/kg in IOPD.

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that avalglucosidase alfa is not to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself.

Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that avalglucosidase alfa in comparison to 
alglucosidase alfa  previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union is not to be qualified 
as a new active substance as insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate that it differs 
significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from the previously authorised substance. 
Refer to Appendix on new active substance (NAS).  
5.  Re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 23 July 2021 
On 23 July 2021, the CHMP concluded that Nexviadyme was not to be qualified as a new active substance 
(NAS) on the following basis: 
Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that avalglucosidase alfa in comparison to 
alglucosidase alfa previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union is not to be qualified as 
a new active substance in itself as insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate that it differs 
significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from the previously authorised substance. 
Following this negative CHMP outcome on the new active substance claim, the applicant submitted detailed 
grounds for the re-examination of the negative CHMP conclusions on NAS claim.  
Following a request from the applicant at the time of the re-examination, the CHMP convened an Ad Hoc expert 
Group (AHEG) inviting the experts to provide their views on specific questions related to the CHMP negative 
conclusions on NAS claim (see section 5.2). 
The  applicant  presented  their  grounds  for re-examination in  writing  and  at  an  oral  explanation  (see  section 
5.1). 
The detail of the CHMP’s assessment of the Applicant’s grounds and the final conclusions of the Committee are 
presented in section 5.3. 
5.1.  Detailed grounds for re-examination submitted by the applicant 
The submission contains detailed grounds for a request for re-examination of the CHMP opinion of 23 July 
2021. The opinion recommends the granting of a marketing authorisation for Nexviadyme (avalglucosidase 
alfa) for the long-term enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of patients with Pompe disease (acid 
α-glucosidase deficiency) but denies new active substance status (NAS) for Nexviadyme (avalglucosidase 
alfa).   
The request for re-examination is limited to the refusal of NAS status. The Applicant states that the detailed 
grounds contained in the submission demonstrate that Nexviadyme (avalglucosidase alfa) qualifies as a NAS. 
The following sections (5.1.1 and 5.1.2) detail the applicant justifications why avalglucosidase alfa complies 
with the Notice to Applicants (NtA), Annex 1, definition of a NAS for biological substances, ie: 
 
“a …, biological … substance not previously authorised in a medicinal product for human use in the 
European Union; [Indent 1] 
  …; 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 153/230 
 
 
 
 
 
a biological substance previously authorised in a medicinal product for human use in the European 
Union, but differing significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy which is due to 
differences in one or a combination of the following: in molecular structure, nature of the source 
material or manufacturing process; [Indent 3]”. 
Tables and Figures are numbered as per applicant’s submission. 
5.1.1.  Ground#1: criterion under Indent 1 
Ground #1: Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that 
avalglucosidase alfa is not to be qualified as a new active substance in itself. 
The 23 July 2021 NAS assessment report attached to the CHMP opinion, states that in general Indent 1 does 
not apply because avalglucosidase alfa contains the same "primary molecular structure (amino acid 
sequence)" as alglucosidase alfa. The Applicant respectfully disagrees with this restrictive approach. 
The approach seems to be an analogous application of the principle under the 2015 reflection paper for 
chemical substances that when an active substance exposes patients to the same therapeutic moiety as an 
existing product, it will not qualify as a NAS under Indent 1 (but Indent 3 may apply).  The standard of same 
therapeutic moiety for a chemical is here replaced by the same primary molecular structure (of amino acid 
sequence for a proteinaceous biological active substance). The Applicant maintains that such an extrapolation 
is not justified. 
In 2012 and 2015, the EMA issued two reflection papers on the determination of NAS status for chemical 
active substances. The papers were first published in draft to obtain comments from interested parties and 
provide further details on how Annex 1 of the Notice to Applicants can be applied. There is no similar 
reflection paper on the NAS criteria for biological active substances. 
The Applicant submits that where the NAS determination under Indent 1 is not automatically made based on 
the full molecular structure of avalglucosidase alfa (as suggested by the simple wording of Indent 1), the 
following principles apply and are not mutually exclusive: 
1.  The entire structure of the active substance is in any event to be considered under Indent 1 when the 
added glycans are relevant for the therapeutic function or activity of the molecule. That relevance can 
be shown in different ways, which may of course overlap: 
a.  The added glycans have a biological clinical function or impact. This is clearly supported by 
precedents. For instance, the EPAR for Rekovelle states: 
"In general, differences in glycosylation profile could only be considered relevant for NAS 
status, if associated with a primary mode of action and a given function related to the 
indication. This is not the case for FSH mechanism of action, as there is no impact on 
potency. Nevertheless, the differences in glycosylation profile might be considered relevant in 
terms of safety and/or efficacy when assessed at the non-clinical and clinical levels." 
(emphasis added) 
Similarly, the EPAR for Zinbryta states: “Glycosylation is generally not considered a 
distinctive attribute unless the primary mode of action is associated to a specific structure 
and a given function related to the indication." (emphasis added) 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 154/230 
 
 
 
The principle that in the specific case of avalglucosidase alfa, enhanced cell uptake is relevant 
was also recognised during the assessment of the product.  The Rapporteur stressed the 
relevance of significant impact of glycosylation on cellular binding (Rapporteur Day 80 report 
of 28 January 2021, p. 4-5).  Similarly, the Co-Rapporteur invited further data on cell uptake 
(Co-Rapporteur Day 80 report, p. 7).    
The relevance of a clinical function may also have been recognised in the 23 July 2021 NAS 
assessment report. The quality considerations on page 102 conclude that the glycan 
modifications are relevant under Indent 1 when they "have a clinical impact in terms of safety 
or efficacy" but the assessment under Indent 1 is then stopped without considering the 
impact on the clinical function under that same Indent. 
Of course, this is a different test from Indent 3. There is no need under Indent 1 to 
demonstrate a significant difference in safety or efficacy properties. This is also clearly 
recognised in the above quoted passage from the Rekovelle EPAR. 
b.  The added glycans contribute to the biological activity of the active substance.  Biological 
activity is defined as follows: 
"The biological activity is the specific ability or capacity of the product to achieve a defined 
biological effect. Biological assays using different and complementary approaches to measure 
the biological activity should be considered, as appropriate. Depending on the biological 
properties of the product, different assay formats can be used (e.g. ligand or receptor binding 
assays, enzymatic assays, cell-based assays, functional assays), taking into account their 
limitations."   
This makes clear that receptor binding is also relevant. 
c.  The added glycans in avalglucosidase alfa imply a "relevant difference" with alglucosidase 
alfa. 
This is the criterion that was applied in the EPAR for Qarziba (under the quality aspects):  
"It has been the policy of the CHMP that changes in the manufacturing process of a given 
product, or differences between the manufacturing processes of two different products (e.g. a 
biosimilar product and its Reference Medicinal Product) do not require a new INN, New Active 
Substance (NAS) status, and/or another qualification that the two active substances are 
somehow different. Such a status is only warranted if the differences in manufacturing 
processes result in relevant differences between the two products."  
2.  The demonstration of the above-mentioned functionality of the glycans can be based on any relevant 
data, including in vitro, non-clinical, and clinical data. There is nothing in Annex I that excludes 
reliance on such data.  The evaluation under Indent 1 is thus not purely based on the quality aspects.   
The Applicant provides an analysis of avalglucosidase alfa under Indent 1 and concludes that the substance 
qualifies as a NAS.

5.1.1.1.  Rationale for development of avalglucosidase alfa as an intentionally different molecular 
structure 
For any ERT for Pompe disease to be successful, the enzyme must not only be taken up by the target tissue, 
but it must be properly trafficked into the lysosome. The role for the CIMPR in lysosomal targeting of 
endogenous lysosomal proteins from the Golgi apparatus and targeting of exogenous proteins (i.e. ERTs 
including alglucosidase alfa) is well established. The CIMPR has 3 distinct binding domains that bind 
mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) moieties on the surface (at N-glycosylation sites) of proteins but the receptor 
has a much higher affinity for two terminal M6P (bis M6P) compared to a single M6P alone (KD in the 
nanomolar versus micromolar ranges, respectively).   
Alglucosidase alfa has ~1 mol/mol of M6P and only ~10% of this is present as bis M6P, resulting in most of 
the enzyme having little to no affinity for the CIMPR.  It was therefore hypothesized that increasing the 
amount of M6P, and bis M6P in particular, would result in increased CIMPR binding and subsequent cell 
uptake and lysosomal targeting.  A glycoengineering approach was taken to identify glycan structures that 
would substantially increase CIMPR binding, cellular uptake and glycogen clearance in GAAKO mice resulting 
in an ERT significantly more potent than alglucosidase alfa. Such a molecule cannot be produced through 
manipulation of cell culture methods but is instead produced via chemical conjugation of a synthetic glycan to 
specifically oxidized sialic acids at the N-linked glycosylation sites present on alglucosidase alfa. The 
deliberate and methodical design of the oxidation and conjugation processes and the resulting molecule, 
avalglucosidase alfa, yielded an enzyme with ~15- fold higher M6P levels, almost entirely composed of bis 
M6P glycans.  The conjugated glycans are unique structures which could not be generated through a 
recombinant biosynthesis process. As expected, this significant increase in bis M6P results in dramatically 
higher affinity for the CIMPR, significant increase in cellular uptake in vitro, increased potency at clearing 
glycogen in the GAAKO mouse, and better clinical outcomes and safety profile (including immunogenicity) for 
Pompe patients. 
Given that efficient delivery of ERT to lysosomes is critical for glycogen clearance in Pompe disease, a key 
factor for significant improvement in therapeutic effect is the presence of sufficient levels of a high affinity 
glycan on the enzyme. Mutation of the amino acid sequence to alter the enzymatic activity would likely not 
alter the efficacy of alglucosidase alfa, however increasing the uptake and lysosomal targeting of the enzyme 
would.  Therefore, a glycoengineering approach was taken to optimize CIMPR interaction. Since alglucosidase 
alfa contains a very low level of M6P (of which only a small fraction is from the higher affinity bis M6P glycan 
type) and displays low muscle cell uptake activity in vitro and in vivo, a variety of different methods to 
increase the M6P content was investigated. Broadly, two approaches were taken: (i) to increase the M6P 
content on alglucosidase alfa produced in culture (using different expression systems, cell lines and cell line 
engineering); and (ii) to chemically conjugate glycans to the purified alglucosidase alfa. Among those tested, 
only the enzyme generated using chemical conjugation of bis M6P glycan resulted in a molecule with 
significantly increased cellular uptake in vitro and enhanced potency at clearing glycogen in vivo. The choice 
was therefore made to abandon the alternative approach based on the manipulation of the cell culture and to 
further develop and optimize the glycan structure and conjugation process to generate an enzyme with the 
greatest cellular uptake. 
Multiple glycans were tested, differing in M6P content (mono versus bis), structure (linear versus branched), 
and chain length, as was the type of linker and conjugation investigated (aminooxy or hydrazide linker to 
lysine, free cysteine, carbohydrate galactose and sialic acid residues, etc.). These extensive characterization 
studies revealed not only that 2 terminal M6P (bis M6P) are needed for optimal high affinity CIMPR binding, 
but that the orientation and length of the conjugated glycan chain are important as well. The results of these 
Assessment report

studies led to the selection of glycan E13, a bisphosphorylated hexamannose, conjugated to oxidized sialic 
acid through its aminooxy linker structure (Figure 5). The complex manufacturing process was also 
optimized, particularly the conditions for oxidation and conjugation, to reliably generate a molecule with high 
levels of bis M6P, and thus high affinity for the CIMPR and increased muscle targeting. A summary of the 
resulting manufacturing process for avalglucosidase alfa is described below. 
Avalglucosidase alfa is a modified human acid α-glucosidase (alglucosidase alfa) conjugated with multiple 
copies of glycan E13, a synthetic bis-mannose-6-phosphate-tetra-mannose glycan (bis M6P). Alglucosidase 
alfa is the secreted 110 kDa form of the molecule which lacks the signal peptide and contains 896 amino 
acids and seven asparagine-linked glycosylation sites. 
After initial purification of alglucosidase alfa through multiple chromatography and filtration steps, an 
oxidation step is performed. 
The sialic acids on the enzyme are oxidized with periodate before reacting with the reactive group 
(aminooxy) on the purified synthetic M6P-glycan to obtain the oxime conjugate which defines avalglucosidase 
alfa. 
This conjugation step leads to multiple copied of M6P bearing glycans. 
Additional purification, filtration and formulation steps are included after the conjugation to deliver 
avalglucosidase alfa AS. 
5.1.1.2.  The N-linked glycan structures of avalglucosidase alfa significantly differ from the N-
linked glycan structures of alglucosidase alfa 
As stated above, alglucosidase alfa has 7 N-linked glycosylation sites. Site-specific glycan LC-MS analyses 
have identified the 3 most prevalent glycoforms at each of these sites for avalglucosidase alfa and 
alglucosidase alfa (Table 1). The main glycoforms detected for each of these sites are starkly different 
between alglucosidase alfa and avalglucosidase alfa. Importantly, glycan E13 is conjugated to all 7 N-linked 
glycosylation sites in avalglucosidase alfa whereas only 2 of these sites have been shown to carry M6P or bis 
M6P moieties at variable levels in alglucosidase alfa. Complex sialylated N-glycans present on all 7 sites in 
alglucosidase alfa are exploited as the primary conjugation targets (shown in blue) to achieve the extensive 
bis-phosphorylation levels on avalglucosidase alfa. This results in the conjugation of at least 7glycans to each 
molecule of enzyme across the 7 sites (shown in green), redirecting the functional purpose of sialylated N-
glycans by this modification to CIMPR binding and cellular targeting. Additionally, to further exemplify the 
unique aspects of avalglucosidase alfa N-linked glycosylation structure, a more detailed biochemical structure 
is presented in Figure 7 for the 3 major glycoforms at position Asn-84. Avalglucosidase alfa therefore has at 
least a 15-fold increase in M6P levels compared to alglucosidase alfa, almost entirely comprised of bis M6P 
moieties whereas only a small portion of alglucosidase alfa carries a single bis M6P moiety. 
5.1.1.3.  In vitro data confirm that the glycan structure contributes to the biological activity of 
avalglucosidase alfa 
As for multiple ERT, the exogenous enzyme needs to be taken up by cells for effective treatment. 
Avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa are both administered as an intravenous infusion. They depend 
primarily upon the CIMPR for routing to lysosomes to the target muscle cells where they exhibit catalytic 
activity. Thus, as stated previously as well as emphasized and in the White paper on “why avalglucosidase 
alfa glycosylation is innovative to support the claim for avalglucosidase alfa as a new active substance for

EMA” written by Gerald F. Cox, MD, PhD and previously submitted within response to D180, the CIMPR plays 
an essential role in receptor binding, cellular uptake and lysosomal targeting of exogenously administered 
ERTs for Pompe disease. The addition of multiple copies of the synthetic glycan translates to (i) an increased 
binding to the CIMPR and (ii) an improved cellular uptake which thus contributes to the biological activity of 
avalglucosidase alfa and provides a relevant functional difference when compared with alglucosidase alfa. 
5.1.1.3.1.  Avalglucosidase alfa shows increased binding to the CIMPR compared to alglucosidase 
alfa 
The targeted increase in the presence of bis M6P results in a dramatic increase in affinity of avalglucosidase 
alfa for the CIMPR when compared to alglucosidase alfa. The affinity of avalglucosidase alfa compared to 
alglucosidase alfa for the soluble CIMPR (sCIMPR) complex was assessed by affinity chromatography. The 
sCIMPR was immobilized on a Poros EP resin, which was then custom-packed into an analytical HPLC column. 
Avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa samples were applied to this column and bound protein was 
eluted with M6P after a short buffer wash. A 4-step elution was used, with increasing concentrations of M6P 
for each step (0 mM: unbound / 0.26 mM: bound 1 / 0.8 mM: bound 2 / 5 mM: bound 3 / 20 mM: bound 4). 
Sample elution was monitored via fluorescence detection (Ex: 290nm/Em: 340 nm).  Results are recorded as 
the peak area percentage that does not bind the column (Unbound) and the sum of the percentages of the 
highest affinity fractions (eluting with 5 and 20 mM M6P, Peaks 3 and 4, respectively). While 67% of 
alglucosidase alfa does not bind to sCIMPR at all and only 0.4% binds with high affinity, 82% of 
avalglucosidase alfa binds to sCIMPR with high affinity. Receptor column fractionation studies showed that no 
mono- or bis-phosphorylated glycans are present on alglucosidase alfa recovered from the unbound column 
fraction. These data demonstrate that the high levels of bis M6P on avalglucosidase alfa result in a drastic 
increase in high affinity CIMPR binding compared to alglucosidase alfa. 
5.1.1.3.2.  Avalglucosidase alfa shows an increased cellular uptake when compared with 
alglucosidase alfa 
The increased affinity for the CIMPR results in increased cellular uptake as demonstrated by cellular uptake 
assays in L6 myoblasts and Pompe fibroblasts. 
The increase in cellular uptake was first demonstrated in L6 myoblasts during the early development of 
avalglucosidase alfa where a 20-fold increase in uptake was observed. Saturation of the CIMPR, which limits 
cellular uptake, is achieved at much lower doses for avalglucosidase alfa than for alglucosidase alfa (Figure 9 
-).  In these studies, maximal uptake of alglucosidase alfa is never achieved due to the high concentrations 
required to reach saturation, as measured by enzyme activity within cells. The increased affinity of 
avalglucosidase alfa for the CIMPR translates into dramatically higher cellular uptake, and thus saturation of 
the CIMPR. L6 myoblast uptake was also one of the criteria for glycan selection during the glycoengineering 
of avalglucosidase alfa. In those studies, avalglucosidase alfa (β-SAM6) was compared with other glycan 
conjugates in addition to alglucosidase alfa (rhGAA). Avalglucosidase alfa demonstrated the greatest cellular 
uptake with an approximately 15-fold increase compared to alglucosidase alfa, demonstrating maximal 
activity at much lower dosing to the cells (Figure 10). These initial studies demonstrate that the conjugation 
of bis M6P bearing glycans results in a significant increase in cellular uptake.

squares)

The effect of increasing levels of conjugated bis M6P on cellular uptake was further investigated in Pompe 
fibroblast cells using alglucosidase alfa conjugated with increasing amounts of glycan E13 (see module 
3.2.S.3.1). The unconjugated material (alglucosidase alfa GZ-24) was used as a comparator (Figure 11 and 
Table 3). Increasing the number of conjugated glycans (up to 5) significantly increases cellular uptake in this 
assay (each conjugated glycan represents 2 moles/mole M6P and 1 mole/mole bis M6P). Note that maximal 
uptake is observed in these experiments from conjugated bis M6P levels which are more than 15-fold higher 
than those found on alglucosidase alfa (3 moles/mole conjugated bis-M6P on avalglucosidase alfa versus 0.2 
moles/mole bis-M6P on alglucosidase alfa).

Table 3 - Summary of relative potency values obtained from three plates of the cellular uptake assay 
Cellular uptake of avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa was also directly compared in Pompe fibroblasts 
(Table 4). Results for total M6P content for these samples and estimated bis M6P content (theoretical) are 
included for reference. Relative cellular uptake was determined as the ratio of the EC50 of the assay standard 
divided by the EC50 of the sample. Avalglucosidase alfa was shown to be 9-10 times more potent than 
alglucosidase alfa in this assay (see module 3.2.S.3.1). 
Table 4 - Relative potency (EC50 reference/EC50 sample) of avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa 
These data establish the relationship between increasing bis M6P glycans and cellular uptake in vitro. 
5.1.1.4.  Non-clinical data confirmed improved therapeutic impact of the glycan structure of 
avalglucosidase alfa compared to alglucosidase alfa 
The biological functionality of the glycan structure is clearly confirmed by the pharmacodynamic and 
functional differences observed in a mouse model. In particular, nonclinical studies conducted in GAA 
knockout (GAAKO) mice have shown that avalglucosidase alfa is 3 to 7-fold more potent at reducing glycogen 
than alglucosidase alfa (section 4.3.1).  Moreover, long-term avalglucosidase alfa administration results in 
significant improvement in motor function when compared with alglucosidase alfa in animal models (section 
4.3.2). Therefore, the addition of the synthetic glycan provides a relevant difference with regard to the 
functionality of avalglucosidase alfa when compared with alglucosidase alfa.

5.1.1.4.1.  Avalglucosidase alfa is 3 to 7-fold more potent than alglucosidase alfa as measured by 
glycogen depletion in GAAKO mice 
The pharmacodynamic effect of avalglucosidase alfa was evaluated in nonclinical studies in GAAKO mice. 
These mice lack GAA enzyme activity and accumulate glycogen in a manner similar to the human disease. In 
two studies, Studies 07-1948 and 10-00587, GAAKO mice were administered four weekly doses of 
avalglucosidase alfa at 4, 12 or 20 mg/kg or alglucosidase alfa at 5-fold higher doses of 20, 60 or 100 mg/kg. 
Glycogen content was assayed biochemically in the heart, diaphragm and other skeletal muscles and 
confirmed histologically in the heart and quadriceps. As shown in Figure 12, treatment with 20 mg/kg 
avalglucosidase alfa was ~ 5-fold more potent at reducing glycogen levels in the heart, diaphragm and 
quadriceps compared to 20 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa. In these tissues, treatment with 4 mg/kg 
avalglucosidase alfa resulted in glycogen levels similar to treatment with 20 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa. 
Following treatment with 20 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa, heart glycogen levels were reduced to below the 
lower limit of quantitation of vehicle controls whereas treatment with 20 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa resulted in 
a reduction to only 53% of vehicle controls (Table 5). A similar increase in pharmacodynamic effect was 
observed in the quadriceps (40.3% versus 89.8%) and diaphragm (24.0% versus 84.2%) following 
treatment with 20 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa compared to alglucosidase alfa, respectively. These data 
demonstrate that avalglucosidase alfa is ~5-fold more potent at reducing glycogen levels in the heart, 
diaphragm and quadriceps of GAAKO mice.

(neoGAA) or alglucosidase alfa (rhGAA) to GAAKO mice (Study 10-00587)

Table 5 - Glycogen content as percent of vehicle controls (Study 10-00587) 
Glycogen depletion in the psoas and the triceps was not as efficient and shows greater variability (between 
animals and studies) than in the heart and other skeletal muscles in GAAKO mice administered 
avalglucosidase alfa or alglucosidase alfa. A plateau effect is observed in both tissues at higher doses of 
avalglucosidase alfa. This may be a result of the lower relative expression of the CIMPR in predominantly 
Type II muscle fibers (21, 22, 23). Despite this plateau effect, avalglucosidase alfa is ~3-fold more potent 
than alglucosidase alfa in these tissues, with significant glycogen reduction observed at 12 mg/kg 
avalglucosidase alfa (Figure 12).  
The pharmacologically active dose (PAD) for avalglucosidase alfa is 4 mg/kg in the heart whereas the PAD for 
alglucosidase alfa is 20 mg/kg. In all other tissues, the PAD for avalglucosidase alfa is 12 mg/kg compared to 
60 mg/kg for alglucosidase alfa. These data, together with the data from Study 07-1948, demonstrate that 
avalglucosidase alfa is 3 to 7-fold more potent than alglucosidase alfa as measured by glycogen depletion in 
the GAAKO mice. 
A third study in GAAKO mice evaluated the relationship of the number of conjugated glycans on 
avalglucosidase alfa to the extent of glycogen clearance in skeletal muscles (Study 09-3981).  Animals were 
administered 4 weekly doses of 20 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa with 2, 3, 4, 5 or 7 glycans per molecule, or 
100 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa. Though a dose dependent relationship between cell uptake and the number of 
glycans on avalglucosidase alfa was observed in vitro, such a relationship between glycan number and extent 
of glycogen clearance was not observed at glycan levels of greater than 3 in vivo.  Glycogen clearance was 
similar between cohorts administered avalglucosidase alfa with 3 or more glycans and animals treated with a 
5-fold higher dose of alglucosidase alfa, further supporting the increased potency of avalglucosidase alfa over 
alglucosidase alfa.  The plateau effect may be related to saturation of the CIMPR with this dosing regimen. 
This is supported by the short serum half-life for avalglucosidase alfa (~ 30 minutes) and alglucosidase alfa 
(~2 hours) which may not allow for receptor recycling to the plasma membrane during this timeframe. As in 
the previous studies, lower glycogen levels were observed in tissues with higher Type I muscle fibers (i.e. 
quadriceps and diaphragm). Though the effect is not equally penetrant, the totality of the nonclinical data

from GAAKO mice demonstrates that the unique structure of avalglucosidase alfa results in significantly 
better glycogen clearance compared to alglucosidase alfa. 
5.1.1.4.2.  Avalglucosidase alfa treatment significantly improved motor function compared with 
alglucosidase alfa as measured by rocking rotarod and wire hang tests in GAAKO mice 
Previous work has shown that long-term administration of avalglucosidase alfa to GAAKO mice resulted in 
significant improvement in motor function. Animals 5.5 months of age were administered 20 mg/kg 
avalglucosidase alfa, or 20 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa every other week for 8 months. Glycogen 
content was measured at the end of the 8 months, demonstrating comparable clearance in animals treated 
with 100 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa and 20 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa (Figure 13a). Animals were subjected 
to rocking rotarod and wire hang tests once a month during the study. GAAKO mice treated with 20 mg/kg 
avalglucosidase alfa performed substantially better in both tests (Figure 13b, c). Significant increases in 
rotarod performance were observed after 3 months of treatment and by 7 months the animals treated with 
avalglucosidase alfa performed as well as age-matched wild type mice. Animals administered 100 mg/kg 
alglucosidase alfa showed marked improvement in rotarod performance but not to the same extent as the 
avalglucosidase alfa group (at a five-fold lower dose). Similar results were observed in the wire hang test 
where treatment with avalglucosidase alfa prevented functional decline throughout the study. Animals 
administered 20 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa displayed a significant decline in latency in the wire 
hang test over time. Therefore, the ~5-fold increase in potency of avalglucosidase alfa over alglucosidase alfa 
as measured by glycogen clearance is correlated with a greater than 5-fold improvement in motor function in 
GAAKO mice. This may seem paradoxical but note that glycogen content was only measured at the end of 8 
months of treatment and represents the steady state level of maximal glycogen depletion at these doses. 
This does not reflect the length of time that it took to reach that steady state. The increased potency of 
avalglucosidase alfa, as a result of increased CIMPR binding, cellular uptake, and lysosomal targeting, leads 
to a faster depletion of glycogen which in turn has a stronger impact on preventing further muscle damage. 
This is best displayed by the wire hang tests where function is maintained with 20 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa 
but decays with 100 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa.

The importance of clearing accumulated glycogen quickly and early was also demonstrated by a second long-
term study in which 11-month old GAAKO mice were administered 40 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa or 40 
mg/kg or 100 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa weekly for 5 months.  More frequent dosing and a higher 
avalglucosidase alfa dose were used because previous studies had demonstrated that older GAAKO mice were 
refractory to treatment compared to younger mice, (25)(23), likely as a result of accumulated muscle 
damage.  As in the previous study in which younger mice (5.5 months) were evaluated following treatment, 
animals were subjected to rocking rotarod and wire hang tests once a month during the study (Figure 14).

Though all ERT treated groups made similar gains in function by the end of the study, the mice administered 
avalglucosidase alfa displayed a more rapid gain of muscle function in the rocking rotarod test compared to 
alglucosidase alfa treated mice.  Only modest improvements in latency in the wire hang tests were seen in 
any group administered ERT suggesting the presence of significant irreversible muscle damage at the time of 
treatment initiation.  Indeed, progressively higher levels of degeneration and regeneration, as measured by 
central localization of nuclei in the myofiber, were observed in GAAKO mice as a function of age (24).  Little 
reduction in the number of centralized nuclei were observed in older GAAKO mice following weekly treatment 
with 40 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa or 40 mg/kg or 100 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa (Figure 15a).  However, a 
significant reduction was observed in younger mice administered 20 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa or 100 
mg/kg alglucosidase alfa every other week for 6 months (Figure 15b).  These results correlate with the 
muscle function data, suggesting that glycogen clearance in younger mice leads to less muscle damage and 
better functional outcomes.  These observations further substantiate the dogma that “earlier is better” with 
regard to initiating ERT.  The earlier and faster that glycogen is cleared from the muscle, the more function is 
maintained, or can even be regained.  With an early treatment start (5.5 months of age versus 11 months of 
age), as a result of a more rapid and effective clearance of glycogen by avalglucosidase alfa over 
alglucosidase alfa, avalglucosidase alfa is >5 times more effective at preserving muscle function compared to 
alglucosidase alfa in GAAKO mice.

The Applicant concludes that the provided evidence and discussion demonstrate that avalglucosidase alfa 
qualifies as a new active substance under Indent 1. Avalglucosidase alfa cannot be considered as a substance 
previously authorised in the EU for the following reasons: (i) avalglucosidase alfa is conjugated with multiple 
copies of glycan E13, a synthetic bis-mannose-6-phosphate-tetra-mannose glycan (bisM6P) and (ii) the N-
linked glycan structures of avalglucosidase alfa significantly differ from the N-linked glycan structures of 
alglucosidase alfa. Since the (bis)M6P-bearing N-glycans enable binding to CIMPR, cellular uptake and 
lysosomal trafficking of rhGAA (steps that are a prerequisite for the functioning of the enzyme), they should 
be taken into account when assessing whether there are structural differences between avalglucosidase alfa 
and alglucosidase alfa 
5.1.1.5.  The new active substance status is further confirmed by the orphan medicines principles 
on similarity 
The Applicant argues that the principles that apply for assessing similarity of medicines for purposes of the 
orphan medicines rules (and in particular the scope of the market exclusivity for orphan medicines), confirm 
the conclusion that avalglucosidase alfa is a NAS under Indent 1. The definition of similarity was further 
defined in 2018 to take into account the specific aspects of biological products. The revised Commission 
Regulation 847/2000 provides (in Article 3(3)(c)): 
"(2) Biological medicinal products (other than advanced therapy medicinal products) 
The principal molecular structural features are the structural components of an active substance that are 
relevant for the functional characteristics of that substance.  The principal molecular structural features may 
be composed of a therapeutic moiety or a therapeutic moiety in combination with an additional structural 
element(s) significantly contributing to the functional characteristics of the active substance. 
Such an additional structural element(s) can be conjugated, fused or linked by other means to the 
therapeutic moiety or can be an extension of the therapeutic moiety protein backbone by additional amino 
acids. …

(2.1) Proteinaceous substances: 
If the difference in structure between them is due to post-translational events (such as different glycosylation 
patterns) substances shall normally be considered similar. However, exceptionally some post-translational 
modifications may result in a non-similar substance if there is significant effect on the functional 
characteristics of the substance. If the difference in the amino acid sequence is not major, substances shall 
normally be considered similar.  
Therefore, two pharmacologically related protein substances of the same group (for example, having 
differences related to e.g. N-terminal methionine, naturally extracted versus rDNA-derived proteins or other 
minor variants) shall normally be considered similar. However, the addition of a structural element may 
result in substances being considered non-similar if this significantly affects the functional characteristics of 
the substance." 
These rules show that: 
 
 
For purposes of similarity, the "structural components of an active substance that are relevant for the 
functional characteristics of that substance" constitute the "principal molecular structural features." 
The principal molecular structure can include glycans when they contribute to the functional 
characteristics, for instance by improving binding capacity. 
This was confirmed by the CHMP during the Protocol Assistance when the Applicant sought advice on orphan 
similarity in the context of a parallel development of an ERT for Pompe disease by a competitor (i.e., BMN-
701). The advice that was provided in November 2015 states: 
“It is acknowledged that the cation-independent mannose-6-phosphate receptor (CIM6Pr) plays an essential 
role in cellular binding, uptake and lysosomal targeting of exogenously administered alglucosidase alfa. As 
such, the molecule structures relevant for cellular binding should be taken into account as they can be 
considered important functional elements relevant to the MoA. 
It thus might be concluded that the PMSF [principal molecular structural features] of BMN-701 and NeoGAA 
comprise, in addition to the parts responsible for enzymatic activity, those parts of the BMN-701 and NeoGAA 
molecule that bind the CIM6Pr.” 
and 
“Based on the information presented, molecular structural differences in those parts of the BMN-701 and 
neoGAA which comprise the PMSF (particular to the functional elements responsible for receptor binding) are 
apparent, and this could be argued to be an acceptable basis to claim, in a future MAA, non-similarity in the 
context of the Orphan Regulation.” 
The Applicant fully recognizes that the principles of similarity under the orphan medicines rules do not 
directly apply to a NAS determination.  Both assessments, however, relate to regulatory exclusivities that are 
intended to stimulate the development of new medicines.  If one regime does not consider a product 
"similar", then it is hard to see how it could be deemed to be the "same" under the other regime that has a 
similar objective.  And the standard for being considered the same (and thus denying NAS status) must also 
logically speaking be stricter than for similarity.

EMA/708926/2021 
Page 168/230 
 
 
 
5.1.1.6.  The new active substance status is further confirmed by the EU principles governing 
biosimilar medicinal products 
The Applicant argues that, the NAS status is reviewed in the context of the global marketing authorisation 
concept, which itself is part of the regime on data and marketing protection for new medicines under Article 
10 of Directive 2001/83 and Article 14(11) of Regulation 726/2004. Article 10 includes (in par. 2) the specific 
passage on different salts, esters, etc., which is the legal basis for the 2015 reflection paper on the NAS 
determination for chemical active substances (see section 3.2).  Article 10 also includes in par. 4 the specific 
rule on similar biological medicines ("biosimilars"). To maintain consistency in the regulatory approach, it is 
thus also necessary to take into account the principles on biosimilars when making a NAS assessment for a 
biological active substance. 
The current EMA guideline on similar biological medicinal products (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1) states that 
“intended changes to improve efficacy (e.g. glycooptimisation) are not compatible with the biosimilarity 
approach.” Therefore, avalglucosidase alfa could not be considered as a biosimilar of alglucosidase alfa, and 
this should also be taken into account when assessing the NAS status.  As the glycan structure is clearly 
added "to improve efficacy" through improved cellular uptake, the Applicant submits that also on that ground 
avalglucosidase alfa qualifies as a NAS. 
5.1.1.7.  The new active substance status is further confirmed by the INN recommended by WHO 
and its ATC code classification of avalglucosidase alfa 
The Applicant argues that supporting the novelty of avalglucosidase alfa, the WHO approved ‘avalglucosidase 
alfa' as a separate INN and did not designate an INN that would merely reflect differences in glycosylation 
profiles (e.g., “alglucosidase beta”). Each INN is a unique name that is in principle selected only for single, 
well-defined substances that can be unequivocally characterized by a chemical name (or formula). 
In April 2021, the WHO International Working Group for Drug Statistics Methodology adopted a proposed 
Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Code for avalglucosidase alfa. The proposal is to classify 
avaglucosidase alfa under code A16AB22. This is different from the established classification of alglucosidase 
alfa under code A16AB07.   
The deadline for objections to this separate classification expired on 1 September 2021. To the Applicant's 
best knowledge, the EMA and the European Commission have not submitted any objections.  
The ATC coding system allows for classification of the active ingredients of drugs according to the organ or 
system on which they act and their therapeutic, pharmacological and chemical properties. It provides an aid 
to drug utilization monitoring and research. 
The ATC classification is not an assessment of the safety or efficacy properties of an active substance. The 
ATC guidelines clearly state that "[t]he classification of a substance in the ATC/DDD system is … not a 
recommendation for use and it does not imply any judgements about efficacy or relative efficacy of drugs and 
groups of drugs.". The classification is thus not relevant under indent 3 for the NAS determination. The fifth 
level of the ATC code, however, is based on the chemical aspects (also of biological active substances) and is 
thus relevant for the NAS determination under indent 1. It follows that the separate ATC classification for 
avalglucosidase alfa at the fifth level confirms the NAS status under indent 1.

EMA/708926/2021

5.1.1.8.  The principles under the variation regulation confirm the new active substance status 
According to the Applicant, in the absence of clear guidance on how the NAS status of a biological active 
substance must be assessed, it is necessary to also take into account the standard for extensions under the 
variation’s rules. The Applicant argues that the NAS review occurs in the context of the global marketing 
authorisation rule. The EU Court of Justice has held that the terms "any variations and extensions" under that 
rule refer to a "variation to the terms of [an MA]" or an "extension of [an MA]" within the meaning of the 
Variations Regulation 1085/2003.  The Variations Regulation (now Regulation 1234/2008) must thus also be 
taken into account when assessing the NAS status.  
This means that for assessing the NAS status of avalglucosidase alfa, it is relevant to consider whether 
replacing alglucosidase alfa with avalglucosidase alfa could meet the conditions for an extension of the 
Myozyme marketing authorisation under Annex I to Regulation 1234/2008. This would require demonstration 
of compliance with point 1 (c) in Annex I on line extensions: 
“replacement of a biological active substance with one of a slightly different molecular structure where the 
efficacy/safety characteristics are not significantly different”  
Both conditions must be demonstrated by the applicant for the extension approval and cannot be presumed.  
Conversely, there can also not be a presumption that a biological active substance that has a different 
molecular structure does not qualify as a NAS. In addition, any change in the active substance that is more 
than "slight" will be sufficient to support a NAS finding under Indent 1. The Applicant concludes that the 
submitted discussion clearly demonstrates that there are important differences in molecular structure 
between avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa and that they cannot be considered merely "slight". 
5.1.2.  Ground #2: criterion under indent 3 
Ground #2: Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that avalglucosidase 
alfa in comparison to alglucosidase alfa  previously authorised as a medicinal product in the 
European Union is not to be qualified as a new active substance as insufficient evidence has been 
provided to demonstrate that it differs significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or 
efficacy from the previously authorised substance. 
The Applicant argues that as outlined above, the differences in molecular structure have a clinical function 
and demonstrated a meaningful impact on immunogenicity of Nexviadyme in LOPD patients in the EFC14028 
trial, as well as on clinical outcomes in IOPD patients who showed incomplete clinical response to Myozyme. 
In the following sections, the Applicant summarizes protocol-prespecified as well as post-hoc analyses of the 
available clinical data including long-term outcome data in LOPD demonstrating sustained and durable 
benefits.  
The Applicant considers that, although Nexviadyme narrowly missed statistical significance for superiority in 
the primary endpoint of the pivotal study EFC14028 (COMET), the totality of data provides sufficient 
indications that there is a significant difference in safety and/or efficacy with Nexviadyme treatment as 
compared to Myozyme. The increased potency of Nexviadyme was demonstrated clinically by consistent, 
substantial and relevant improvements on meaningful efficacy outcome measures for Pompe patients, as well 
as by a more favorable safety and immunogenicity profile of Nexviadyme compared to Myozyme. Thus, also 
on that basis alone Nexviadyme could qualify as a NAS. 
Overall, the applicant position is that Nexviadyme demonstrated clinically meaningful differences in LOPD.

5.1.2.1.  Primary endpoint- forced expiratory volume (FVC)  
5.1.2.1.1.  Main Analysis- Primary Endpoint (FVC)  
EFC14028 is a pivotal Phase 3 head-to-head study comparing avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviadyme) to 
alglucosidase alfa (Myozyme) in LOPD patients. In agreement with the Regulatory Agencies, the study 
EFC14028 was set up to primarily demonstrate non-inferiority (NI) on the primary endpoint of %predicted 
FVC, then further test for superiority once NI has been demonstrated.  
Forced vital capacity (FVC) is a respiratory outcome variable that is readily obtainable in the clinical setting 
and commonly reported in studies pertaining to LOPD patients. FVC decline was observed to be associated 
with an increased incidence of respiratory complications and death. In LOPD, a patient-level data meta-
analysis has demonstrated that FVC is associated with numerous outcome measures and the progression in 
FVC is associated with changes in exercise tolerance, peripheral muscle strength and health-related quality of 
life. Improvement in FVC is positively associated with a variety of other LOPD measures and outcomes across 
multiple domains including endurance (6MWT), skeletal muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes (SF-
36) (Lachmann and Schoser, 2013). Therefore, FVC is the appropriate choice as a primary endpoint to 
measure the clinical difference between Nexviadyme and Myozyme. 
In the mITT population, the LS mean change (SE) from baseline to Week 49 in % predicted FVC was 2.89 
(0.88) in the Nexviadyme group and 0.46 (0.93) in the Myozyme group. The difference of 2.43 with lower 
boundary of 95% CI of -0.13 exceeded -1.1 (the predefined NI margin of 1.1) and thus achieved statistical 
NI (p=0.0074) and the primary study objective). Upon further testing for superiority, the endpoint barely 
missed formal statistical superiority (p=0.0626), while the observed effect is numerically greater and 
clinically meaningful (Figure 25).  
Figure 22 - Nexviadyme® demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in % predicted FVC 
CI, confidence interval; FVC, forced vital capacity; LS, least squares; SE, standard error.  
The nominal p-values for pre-specified sensitivity analyses for superiority ranged between 0.0174 and 0.1377; p=0.0174 for the non-parametric 
Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test 
In a large study in patients with another restrictive respiratory disease, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), 
the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of FVC was defined as 2 to 6% (equivalent to a 3 to 9% 
relative change) and it was concluded that changes from baseline in % predicted FVC reflected changes in 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021

global health status (du Bois et al, 2011). In the majority of studies of alglucosidase alfa treatment, patients 
who had a change in FVC within or above the MCID range that was established for IPF, also reported a 
noticeable perceived improvement (Lachmann and Schoser, 2013).  
In Pompe disease, impaired FVC is associated with an increased incidence of respiratory complications and 
death. A patient-level data meta-analysis has demonstrated that FVC is associated with numerous LOPD 
outcome measures and the progression in FCV is a respiratory outcome variable that is readily obtainable in 
the clinical setting and commonly reported in studies pertaining to LOPD patients. Improvement in FVC is 
positively associated with a variety of other LOPD measures and outcomes across multiple domains including 
endurance (6MWT), skeletal muscle strength and patient-reported outcomes (SF-36) (Berger et al, 2019).  
That was also observed in study EFC14028 as the improvement in FVC is associated with clinically meaningful 
improvement in other parameters of respiratory function, ambulation, motor function and health-related 
quality of life (HRQoL). The improvement in FVC observed with Nexviadyme is therefore clinically meaningful 
from the patient’s perspective, and the difference compared with Myozyme is also clinically meaningful and 
very close to the pre-specified 5% significance level for statistical superiority. 
5.1.2.1.2.  Subgroup analysis - primary endpoint (FVC)  
Pre-specified subgroup analyses results were observed to be consistent regardless of gender, age and regions 
(Figure 26). Consistent improvements were also observed in the global population of mainly adult patients 
and the 2 pediatric patients with LOPD included in the study (Table 33). This demonstrates the robustness of 
the improvement observed along the spectrum of clinical presentations, despite the variability inherent to the 
disease.

5.1.2.1.3.  Prespecified sensitivity analysis- primary endpoint (FVC)  
Pre-specified per protocol and sensitivity analyses were conducted, as detailed in the statistical analysis plan 
(SAP). A summary of results is shown in Table 34 and demonstrates the robustness of the results which are 
consistent irrespective of the analysis approach. The nominal p-values for superiority ranged between 0.0174 
and 0.1377; it was below 5% in the non-parametric Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test. The small p-values 
illustrate the low probability for a false positive claim of superiority.  
Greater values of change from baseline in FVC (% predicted) were observed in the Nexviadyme group PP 
population during the PAP. Similarly, to the mITT population, statistical superiority was narrowly missed at 
the 5% significance level (nominal p=0.0555; 95% CI: -0.06, 5.44). 
Five patients in the alglucosidase alfa group dropped out of the PAP due to treatment-related reasons. The 
FVC (% predicted) was analyzed in completers and dropouts and when compared there appeared to be no 
impact on the robustness of the results. 
A tipping point analysis of FVC (% predicted) for sensitivity analysis with respect to missing at random 
assumption in the PAP was done. A shift of -16 (16% reduction in FVC % predicted) in the avalglucosidase 
alfa group and a shift of 2 (2% increase in FVC % predicted) in the alglucosidase alfa group to overturn 
significance indicated a robust result for primary NI analysis. 
Further sensitivity analyses were conducted including FVC (% predicted) in the PAP (mITT population) with 
respect to constancy assumption with results of the pivotal trial for the registration of Myozyme 
(AGLU02704/LOTS trial) and estimates and hypothesis tests of change from baseline at Week 49 using 
different statistical approaches.

5.1.2.2.  Secondary and exploratory efficacy endpoints 
Pompe disease is a multisystemic disease affecting pulmonary function, ambulation, motor function and, 
ultimately, HRQoL. Nexviadyme provided greater benefit compared to Myozyme on the vast majority of 
secondary and exploratory endpoints in study EFC14028. 
5.1.2.2.1.  Main analysis- secondary endpoint (6MWT)  
The main secondary endpoint was the ambulation measure of distance walked (in meters) during 6-minute 
walk test (6MWT). 
In mITT population LS mean change (SE) in 6MWT (distance walked in meters) from baseline to Week 49 
was 32.21 (9.93) in the Nexviadyme group, which was clinically meaningful, and 2.19 (10.40) in the 
Myozyme group; the difference was 30.01 (nominal p=0.0405), showing an improvement with Nexviadyme, 
compared to Myozyme (Figure 27). 
Based on studies in chronic diseases other than LOPD that had aimed to relate changes in the 6-minute walk 
test (6MWT) to changes in patient perception, the MCID in 6MWT was defined as 24 to 54 m (Lachmann and 
Schoser, 2013). 
Approximately 70% of patients improved their FVC and more than 80% improved their 6MWT (i.e., had a 
positive absolute change from baseline) with Nexviadyme compared to less than 50% with Myozyme, and 
approximately twice as many patients had improvements above predefined clinically meaningful thresholds. 
Figure 24 - Nexviadyme® demonstrated a clinically meaningful improvement in distance walked during the 
6MWT 
6MWT, 6-minute walk test; CI, confidence interval; LS, least squares; SE, standard error. 
5.1.2.2.2.  Pre-specified subgroups analyses- secondary endpoint (6MWT)  
Pre-specified subgroups analyses results were observed to be consistent regardless of gender, age and 
regions (Figure 28). Consistent improvements are also observed in the global population of mainly adult 
patients and the 2 pediatric patients with LOPD included in the study (Table 35). This demonstrates the

robustness of the improvement observed along the spectrum of clinical presentations, in spite of the 
variability inherent to the disease.

5.1.2.2.3.2.  Motor function 
Clinically meaningful improvement in motor function evaluated by the lower extremity muscle strength 
(composite score) by hand-held dynamometry (HHD) and the global score quick motor function test (QMFT) 
are also observed (Table 36), as well as in the upper extremity muscle strength (composite score) by HHD 
and in the GMFM-88 Dimension D and Dimension E (Figure 29). The improvement in QMFT is of particular 
relevance since this is a reliable and valid test specific to Pompe disease. This test correlates strongly with 
proximal muscle strength, shows significant differences between patient groups with different disease 
severities, and measures the ability to perform everyday movements that are particularly difficult for patients 
with Pompe disease (van Capelle et al, 2012). A clinically meaningful improvement was observed (LS mean 
change from baseline [SE] 3.98 [0.63]), and the benefit was greater compared to alglucosidase alfa (LS 
mean difference +2.08 [95% CI: 0.22, 3.95]; nominal p=0.0288, performed without multiplicity 
adjustment). Even if the superiority of avalglucosidase alfa cannot be formally claimed due to the strict 
control of multiplicity, the estimate, the 95% CI and the nominal p-value below the commonly agreed 
threshold for statistical significance (p<0.05) confirm the greater benefit observed with avalglucosidase alfa.

5.1.2.2.3.3.  Health-related quality of life and patient-reported outcomes 
Pompe disease has a substantial humanistic burden and the association of LOPD with the many measures of 
clinical, functional, social and emotional well-being that comprise the humanistic burden is reasonably well 
documented, confirming the impact of LOPD on the everyday life of patients and their caregivers. Clinical 
progression of disease is strongly associated with greater humanistic burden and reduced HRQoL (Schoser et 
Assessment report

al, 2017). The improvement observed in the validated 12-item short form survey (SF-12) for both the 
physical component summary (PCS) and the mental component summary (MCS) is therefore very important 
for patients since it illustrates reduction in the disease-related burden (Table 36). Consistent improvement in 
other parameters evaluating HRQoL (Figure 30) certifies the robustness of the data and the global 
improvement in the disease-related burden as perceived and reported by the patients. 
The EuroQol 5-dimension 5-level (EQ-5D-5L) is a multi-attribute utility measure of health-related quality of 
life, showing overall better outcomes with avalglucosidase alfa compared to alglucosidase alfa (Figure 30). 
Overall, greater mean (SD) EQ-5D-5L changes from baseline to Week 49 were observed in the 
avalglucosidase alfa group for mobility (-0.50 [0.89] in the avalglucosidase alfa group and -0.14 [0.68] in the 
alglucosidase alfa group), usual activities (-0.34 [0.89] in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 0.00 [0.73] in 
the alglucosidase alfa group). Similarly, EQ-5D VAS mean (SD) scores were greater (8.80 [15.01] in the 
avalglucosidase alfa group than in the alglucosidase alfa group (-0.33 [16.13]). Avalglucosidase alfa group 
scores in comparison to the alglucosidase alfa group with lower scores indicating less burden. Little change 
and differences between treatment groups were observed in self-care, pain/discomfort, anxiety/depression 
scores. Using Wilcoxon Mann Whitney test at the nominal level, mean changes from baseline to Week 49 
were greater with avalglucosidase alfa, as compared to alglucosidase alfa, for mobility and usual activities, 
which are the most relevant domains in LOPD, as well as for EQ-5D VAS. This supports an additional 
therapeutic benefit of avalglucosidase alfa over the current standard of care on the treatment relevant 
aspects of LOPD. 
The Pompe disease symptom scale (PDSS) measures severity of breathing difficulties, fatigue and tiredness, 
muscle weakness and ache, pain, and headache from the patient’s perspective. In general, median change 
from baseline to Week 49 for all the PDSS domains and the total symptom score were numerically better with 
avalglucosidase alfa as compared to alglucosidase alfa.  
The Pompe disease impact scale (PDIS) captures the impact of the disease on mood and mobility-related 
physical activities. The PDIS includes negative mood score and Difficulty Physical Activity Score (DPAS) which 
includes difficulty performing activity. Median changes from baseline to Week 49 for the DPAS domain of the 
PDIS was significantly better (-0.62 vs. -0.07, nominal p=0.0296) with avalglucosidase alfa as compared to 
alglucosidase alfa (Figure 30). 
The PGIC is a 7
point verbal scale designed specifically to assess patients’ perception of changes following 
treatment (i.e., “feeling better” or “feeling worse”) with the options “very much improved”, “much improved”, 
‑
“minimally improved”, “no change”, “minimally worsened”, “much worsened”, and “very much worsened” 
(Perrot and Lantéri-Minet, 2019). Improvement of several dimensions (daily activities, disease-related 
symptoms, ability to breath, mobility) was observed with avalglucosidase alfa, with the lower bound of the 
95% CI above or close to 0 (Figure 30). The PGIC (ability to breathe) anchor-based improvements were 
categorized as “somewhat to moderately better” (definition 1), “somewhat to a great deal better” (definition 
2) and “moderately to a great deal better” (definition 3) at week 49. Changes from baseline to Week 49 in % 
predicted FVC were computed for the three anchor definitions and compared to the “no change” PGIC 
category. There was minimal change in FVC in subjects that reported “no change” in their PGIC. In contrast, 
FVC increased in ascending order of magnitude for the three PGIC improvement definitions (FVC % predicted 
median [IQR] of 1.7 [-2.1-5.4]; 2.1 [-2.1-6.0]; and 4.1 [-2.1-7.6], respectively). Data suggest that an 
improvement of 1.7 % or greater in % predicted FVC corresponds to minimal patient relevant change and as 
shown above, a greater proportion of patients treated with avalglucosidase alfa improved at or above the 
threshold compared with alglucosidase alfa (Table 36). This supports the greater benefit of avalglucosidase 
alfa on the respiratory function from the perspective of patients with LOPD.

EMA/708926/2021

Overall, avalglucosidase alfa has demonstrated greater improvements compared with alglucosidase alfa in 
several generic and disease-related measures of HRQoL, including in novel measures of the severity and 
impact of Pompe disease on the patient experience. This is clinically meaningful since it represents benefits in 
motility and in the ability to perform daily activities, and ultimately an improvement in patient’s quality of life 
and a substantial reduction of the burden of the disease.

5.1.2.2.3.4.  Efficacy biomarkers 
Efficacy biomarkers (urinary Hex4 and creatine kinase) decreased to a greater extent with avalglucosidase 
alfa as compared with alglucosidase alfa at Week 49 (Figure 31). This is clinically meaningful since an 
improvement in biomarkers was shown to positively correlate with clinical outcomes (Manwaring et al, 2012, 
Young et al, 2012). Of note, a further decrease in Hex4 was observed in patients switching from 
alglucosidase alfa to avalglucosidase alfa.

5.1.2.3.1.  Prespecified Responder Analyses- primary endpoint (% predicted FVC)  
Pre-specified responder analyses were conducted as per study plans. Overall, approximately twice as many 
patients had an improvement above a given value, whatever the threshold, in the avalglucosidase alfa group 
compared to alglucosidase alfa (Table 37). More than half of the patients (26/51) in the avalglucosidase alfa 
group had a relative increase of 5% or more, 27.5% (14/51) a relative increase of 10% or more and 
approximately 20% (10/51) a relative increase of 15% or more. This is clinically meaningful for patients since 
these thresholds are above the MCID for IPF (Lachmann and Schoser, 2013), and since a natural progressive 
decline is generally observed with age and disease progression.

5.1.2.3.2.  Post-hoc Responder Analyses- primary endpoint (% predicted FVC)  
To further evaluate the benefit of improving respiratory function from a patient perspective, a post-hoc 
responder analysis was conducted in study EFC14028 to assess the absolute changes in % predicted FVC in 
relation to PROs. Patient-relevant absolute change in % predicted FVC of 1.7%, 2% and 4 % were estimated 
based on the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) - Ability to Breathe - rated on a 7-point Likert 
scale, used as an anchor.  
Data suggest that an absolute improvement of at least 1.7 % in % predicted FVC corresponds to minimal 
patient relevant change and a greater proportion of patients treated with avalglucosidase alfa improved at or 
above the threshold compared with alglucosidase alfa (Table 38).

When the observed changes from baseline to Week 49 in % predicted FVC are represented as a cumulative 
probability function, a clear right shift of the avalglucosidase alfa curve compared to the alglucosidase alfa 
curve is observed (Figure 32). The figure clearly shows the numerically greater benefit of avalglucosidase alfa 
whatever the level of change from baseline. Approximately 70% of patients improved their FVC (i.e., had a 
positive absolute change from baseline) with avalglucosidase alfa. Since the natural progression of the 
disease shows gradual decline, any improvement of pulmonary function can be considered a positive 
response to the therapy (Stepien et al, 2016). In the alglucosidase alfa group more than half of the patients 
had a deterioration of FVC (i.e., had a negative absolute change from baseline).

5.1.2.3.3.  Prespecified Responder Analysis- main secondary endpoint (6 MWT)  
In the pre-specified responder analyses (Table 39), a greater number of patients receiving avalglucosidase 
alfa than patients receiving alglucosidase alfa showed an increase from baseline exceeding the pre-defined 
clinically meaningful thresholds of 27.5, 30, 37 and 54 meters based on what is perceived as a MCID by 
patients with LOPD or other chronic diseases affecting ambulation (Lachmann and Schoser, 2013).

If a subject had a change from baseline at week 49 in 6MET distance >=54 meters, s/he will be included in responders of >=27.5, >=30, >=37 and >=54

Logistic regression models adjust for baseline 6MWT distance, age (in years, at baseline), and gender. 
5.1.2.3.4.  Post-hoc Responder Analyses- main secondary endpoint (6 MWT) 
When the observed changes from baseline to Week 49 in 6MWT are represented as a cumulative probability 
function, a right shift of the avalglucosidase alfa curve compared to the alglucosidase alfa curve is observed 
(Figure 33). The figure clearly shows the greater benefit of avalglucosidase alfa whatever the level of change 
from baseline. More than 80% of patients improved their 6MWT (i.e., had a positive absolute change from 
baseline) with avalglucosidase alfa, which is clinically meaningful since any improvement in motility can be 
considered as positive response to the therapy taking into account the natural progression of the disease with 
gradual decline (Stepien et al, 2016). In the alglucosidase alfa group more than 40% of the patients had a 
deterioration of 6MWT (i.e., had a negative absolute change from baseline).

5.1.2.4.  Post-hoc analyses aiming at increasing the precision and the power 
In consideration of the challenges with statistically powering a comparative trial in a rare disease, post-hoc 
analyses were conducted, aiming at increasing the precision and the power. While post-hoc analyses are not 
a typical consideration in the evaluation of a new therapy, the EMA guideline on Clinical Trials in Small 
Populations specifically mentions that meta-analyses of good-quality randomized controlled clinical trials that 
all show consistent results is the highest tier in the hierarchy of levels of evidence, and as such may provide 
important evidence of avalglucosidase alfa’s meaningful clinical improvement over alglucosidase alfa. In these 
post-hoc analyses the treatment effect estimate remains similar to that of study EFC14028, providing 
reassurance that these post-hoc analyses are not biased. When pooling the 51 patients randomized to 
receive avalglucosidase alfa in study EFC14028 and the 3 treatment-naïve patients who received 
avalglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow in study TDR12857/LTS13769 and adjusting for main baseline 
characteristics, the results are not different from the primary analysis (LS mean difference: 2.27%; 95% CI: 
-0.30; 4.85) due to the small number of additional patients. In the 2 other analyses described below, the 
result reaches nominal statistical significance since the confidence interval no longer includes 0, supporting 
the hypothesis that an effect exists but was not formally demonstrated due to a lack of precision and power: 
•  By pooling the 49 patients randomized to alglucosidase alfa in study EFC14028 and the 60 treatment-
naïve patients who received alglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow in the historical study 
ALGLU02704/LOTS, the sample size of the alglucosidase alfa arm was more than doubled. After 
adjusting for differences in baseline characteristics between the 2 studies, the difference (95% CI) in 
% predicted FVC between avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa at Week 49/Week 52 was 2.41 
(0.18; 4.64).  
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 186/230 
 
 
 
 
 
• 
To increase the precision and reduce the variance, a sensitivity post-hoc analysis was conducted after 
excluding an extreme outlying patient in the avalglucosidase alfa group. This patient, depicted at the 
extreme left of the blue curve in Figure 32, had a low baseline value and an atypical trajectory of 
respiratory function testing and the largest worsening at every visit in the context of concomitant 
poorly controlled asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and corresponding treatment. 
After excluding this patient, the variance decreased from 1.29 to 1.17 and the difference (95% CI) in 
% predicted FVC between avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa at Week 49 was 2.98 (0.65; 
5.30). While excluding an outlying patient can be considered arbitrary and debatable, this highlights 
the impact a single patient can have on the overall result in the context of a rare disease with high 
heterogeneity and variability. It may be hypothesized that the avalglucosidase alfa effect estimate in 
study EFC14028 is underestimated owing to this outlying patient. 
5.1.2.4.1.  Post-hoc Bayesian analysis 
The p-value approach focuses on the probability of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis of no difference 
between the drugs (dichotomize the decision based on a false positive rate of 0.05). Since the p-value 
(0.0626) is slightly above the pre-specified threshold, the null hypothesis of no difference in 49-week change 
from baseline in % predicted FVC between avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa could not be rejected. 
However, this does not imply that equivalence was demonstrated, especially considering that the study was 
not sufficiently powered for superiority. We propose a Bayesian interpretation of the trial results based on 
posterior probability distributions and credibility intervals. 
A post-hoc Bayesian posterior probability distribution using non-informative priors was generated for the 
primary analysis of the primary endpoint in study EFC14028. The posterior mean (SD) is 2.44% (1.30%) and 
the 95% credible interval is (-0.07%, 5.02%) based on 10000 draws. The posterior probability for 
avalglucosidase alfa being better than alglucosidase alfa is 97%. There is 87% posterior probability that the 
difference between treatments is above 1% and 63% posterior probability that the difference is above 2% 
(Figure 34).

5.1.2.4.2.  Post-hoc sensitivity analyses 
The 6 patients who were initially excluded from the PP population were reincluded in the PP for a post-hoc 
sensitivity analysis. This post-hoc analysis showed that the difference in % predicted FVC at Week 49 was 
still in favor of avalglucosidase alfa and did not change the PP conclusion (LS mean change of 2.52 and 2.69 
with and without additional 6 patients, respectively). 
Finally, another post-hoc sensitivity analysis was conducted by removing 4 patients who were excluded due 
to implausible MIP/MEP values of 200 mmHg at baseline. The results of these analyses were very similar to 
that including the 4 patients. 
5.1.2.5.  International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF)  
Clinical outcome assessments have been utilized in Nexviadyme clinical trials in order to capture relevant 
changes in how patients feel, function, and participate in their daily lives. The International Classification of 
Functioning, Disability, and Health (ICF) is a framework used to conceptualize functioning as an interaction 
between body function (physiological functions of body systems), activities (execution of a task or action by 
an individual), and participation in activities that are meaningful, such as community, work, and socialization 
(WHO 2001).  Environmental and personal factors also impact how a health condition presents for an 
individual, though these are not focused on in clinical trial research. The ICF Model is helpful in understanding 
the impact of changes in body function and structure, activity, and quality of life as measured in clinical 
outcome assessments in the COMET study.

Muscle strength measured by handheld dynamometry 
Muscle strength was measured in the EFC14028 (COMET) study by handheld dynamometry.  Isometric 
measurement of peak force in Newtons was measured by trained assessors with standardized patient 
positions, dynamometer placement, and assessor verbal instructions. Observed and estimated changes in 
muscle force generation at Week 49 of the PAP were previously reported in the CSR and are summarized in 
Table 40 and Table 41.   
The primary analyses for PAP are based on MMRM presented Table 40. The primary MMRM analyses captured 
greater positive change in the Nexviadyme group on the Lower Extremity Composite Score and Upper 
Extremity Composite scores. The same pattern is observed in the Lower Extremity percent predicted and 
Upper Extremity Scores percent predicted, which controls for changes in muscle strength attributed to patient 
factors such as age, gender, height, and weight. Ten of 14 lower extremity muscle groups had greater 
strength changes in the Nexviadyme group. The largest difference between lower extremity muscle groups 
was observed in Knee Flexion, with the Nexviadyme group having 21.14 Newton greater increase on the left 
and 10.88 Newton greater increase on the right compared to the Myozyme group. Additionally, 12 of 14 
upper extremity muscle groups had greater strength changes observed in the Nexviadyme group; the two 
muscle groups that favored the Myozyme group had small differences between groups of less than one

Results in Table 41 are based on descriptive statistics by visit in PAP and ETP with p-values from Wilcoxon-
Mann-Whitney without adjustment for baseline scores and other factors such as age and gender. Greater 
positive change was observed in the Nexviadyme group on both the Lower Extremity Composite Score and 
Upper Extremity Composite Score (nominal p=0.0439 for the Upper Extremity Composite score).  The same 
pattern is observed in the Lower Extremity and Upper Extremity Scores of percent predicted, which controls

for changes in muscle strength attributed to patient factors, such as age, gender, height and weight. Patients 
in the Nexviadyme group had a 3.09%-predicted greater gain in muscle strength for the lower extremity 
composite score and 3.69%-predicted greater gain in the upper extremity composite score (Table 40)  
Considering observed changes at Week 49 in individual muscle groups, majority of muscle groups tested had 
numerical greater positive change in the Nexviadyme group, though nominal p>0.05 Table 41. Ten of 12 
lower extremity muscle groups had greater percent predicted strength changes in the Nexviadyme group; the 
two muscle groups which favored the Myozyme group had small differences of less than 1 percent predicted 
point. In upper extremity muscles, all muscle groups had numerically greater change in percent predicted 
muscle strength in the Nexviadyme group.

The pattern of greater numerical change in muscle force generation in the Nexviadyme group is hypothesized 
as the result of improved glycogen clearance and improved skeletal muscle function via improved muscle 
preservation. The consistent improvement in percent predicted muscle strength in the majority of muscle 
groups with Nexviadyme indicates improved ability of the muscle to generate force as measured by a 
handheld dynamometer.  
Muscle strength to perform FVC, MIP, and MEP 
In addition to the skeletal muscle groups measured with handheld dynamometry, muscle force generation 
contributed to the outcomes of FVC, MIP, and MEP (Figure 23). These respiratory measures rely on 
neuromuscular coordination and strength of the diaphragm, abdominal, and other accessory muscles to 
generate force required to expand and contract the chest wall. Direct measurement of these muscle groups is 
not feasible with handheld dynamometry, but changes in the respiratory measures can indicate improved 
muscle function and force generation. At Week 49, the Nexviadyme group appreciated greater improvements 
in FVC % predicted and MIP % predicted compared to the Myozyme group.  
5.1.2.5.2.  Activity Changes 
Functional strength as measured by the 6 Minute Walk Test (6MWT) Quick Motor Function Test (QMFT), Gross 
Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88), and Gait, Stairs, Gower’s, Chair (GSGC) 
Changes in muscle force generation contribute to a patient’s ability to use muscle strength to complete 
functional activities such as walking, stair navigation, balance, and transitions. These activities, among 
others, are captured in the functional outcome assessments in the COMET study of the secondary endpoints 
6MWT, QMFT, as well as tertiary endpoints GMFM, and GSGC, as evaluated by a trained assessor.  
Changes observed and estimated in these functional outcome assessments at Week 49 of the COMET study 
are summarized in Table 42 and Table 43. All measures had an observed difference between groups favoring 
the Nexviadyme group. Nominal p<0.05, was reported in all with the exception of the GMFM Dimension D 
(p=0.0613). Table 43 highlights estimates and nominal p-values for secondary outcomes of 6MWT and 
QMFT; all difference between groups show nominal p<0.05.

5.1.2.5.3.  Patient report of Global Impression of Change and Quality of Life 
Pompe disease has a substantial humanistic burden and the association of LOPD with measures of clinical, 
functional, social and emotional well-being is reasonably well documented, confirming the impact of LOPD on 
the everyday life of patients and their caregivers. Clinical progression of disease is strongly associated with 
greater humanistic burden and reduced health-related quality of life.  
In EFC14028 COMET study, in addition to greater positive change in muscle strength and ability to perform 
functional activities, the change in patients’ impressions of their overall health and well-being illuminates the 
impact of therapies on daily lives and ability to participate more fully in work, community, and socialization. 
The EQ-5D-5L Visual Analog Scale records the respondent’s self-rated health status on a vertical graduated 
(0-100) visual analog scale. Patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group had a mean 8.8-point increase in 
rating at Week 49 compared to a mean change of -0.33 in the alglucosidase alfa group (nominal p=0.0043) 
(Table 44). The greater positive change in perceived health aligns with improved muscle strength, respiratory 
measures, and ability to perform functional activities appreciated in the avalglucosidase alfa group.

5.1.2.6.  Long-term efficacy data 
5.1.2.6.1.  Long Term Safety Extension Study LTS13769 
Recent studies showed that the effect of Myozyme seems to peak at 2 to 3 years of treatment and is followed 
by a plateau or a secondary decline after 3 to 5 years (Schoser et al, 2017, Gutschmidt et al, 2021, 
Semplicini et al, 2020). In study LTS13769, the maintained long-term effect of avalglucosidase alfa on 
respiratory function and ambulation in patients with LOPD was shown up to 6 years (Figure 36). Despite the 
natural decline of the disease over time with age and occurrence of intercurrent medical events in some 
patients, stabilization was observed Nexviadyme in pulmonary and motor function among both naive and 
switch group patients, indicating a sustained benefit compared to the natural history of Pompe disease.  
Figure 33 – Nexviadyme Long Term Safety Extension Study LTS13769 - 6 Years Follow up 
5.1.2.6.2.  Long term data in COMET- EFC14028 Study 
Due to roll-out enrollment, 2-year data were available in approximately half of the patients randomized to 
Nexviadyme at the time of initial submission. An additional analysis was performed after the last subject 
completed Week 97 visit. Overall, the effect observed in PAP was maintained over time in patients treated 
with Nexviadyme for most primary, secondary and exploratory endpoints of respiratory function, ambulation, 
motor function and health-related quality of life, as well as in patient-reported outcomes measuring the 
burden of the disease as perceived by the patients.  
In patients initially treated with Nexviadyme during PAP, maintenance of effect on % predicted FVC was 
observed, as well as the maintenance or continuous improvement of effect in other parameters of MIP and 
MEP (Figure 37). MIP and MEP are respiratory pressure measurements that require recruitment and 
utilization of skeletal muscles of respiration, such as the diaphragm, intercostals, and abdominals, and 
positive change was observed to be maintained in the Nexviadyme group at Week 97.  
The effects of Nexviadyme on 6MWT is sustained up to at least 2 years (Figure 37). The initial improvement 
in most motor function endpoints with Nexviadyme is maintained over time. The increased force generated

by lower extremity muscle groups contributed to improved motor function scores, as indicated by higher 
scores on the QMFT, which were maintained through Week 97. The improvement in QMFT is of particular 
relevance since this is a reliable and valid test specific to Pompe disease. This test correlates strongly with 
proximal muscle strength, shows significant differences between patient groups with different disease 
severities, and measures the ability to utilize increased strength for functional mobility and perform everyday 
movements that are particularly difficult for Pompe disease patients (van Capelle et al, 2012).

The beneficial effect on secondary outcomes of health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and on exploratory 
patient-reported outcomes evaluating the ability to perform daily activities (Figure 38) was also maintained 
or continued to improve up to at least Week 97, indicating the sustained benefit for patients in reducing the 
burden of the disease as perceived by the patients and fulfilling unmet clinical needs.

Patients on Myozyme who switched to Nexviadyme experienced a maintenance or improvement in all 
endpoints after the switch. Similar to the nonclinical results in mouse models, the molecular structural 
differences of Nexviadyme versus Myozyme translated to improved muscle function in patients, as measured 
by increased muscle strength (force generated) and ability to utilize increased strength for functional mobility 
as measured on the QMFT and measures of breathing capabilities (MIP and MEP).   
This is clinically meaningful in the context of a multi-systemic chronic disease and taking into account the 
natural decline in these parameters with age and progressing disease. In study EFC14028, data at Week 97 
have recently been made available and the efficacy was maintained up to at least 2 years for outcomes of 
respiratory function, ambulation, motor function and health-related quality of live, as well as patient-related 
outcomes measuring the burden of the disease. 
5.1.2.7.  Safety data 
5.1.2.7.1.  Safety events overview 
From a safety perspective, avalglucosidase alfa was better tolerated as compared to alglucosidase alfa in the 
49-week blinded comparative period of the trial as demonstrated by lower frequencies of TEAEs, SAEs, and 
protocol-defined infusion associated reactions (IARs) with avalglucosidase alfa (Table 45). One patient 
treated with alglucosidase alfa died and 4 patients withdrew due to AEs in the alglucosidase alfa arm 
(including 2 patients with IARs), compared to none in the avalglucosidase alfa arm in the comparative period. 
Median exposure to study drug was comparable with 11.53 months for avalglucosidase alfa and 11.50 
months for alglucosidase alfa, respectively. Overall, 44 patients switched from alglucosidase alfa to 
avalglucosidase alfa in the extension treatment period.

Note: Numbers reported are the number (%) of participants with at least 1 TEAE in each category.  
*Defined as an adverse event that occurred during either the infusion or observation period following the infusion, related or possible 
related to the investigational treatment. 
An IAR was defined in the protocol as adverse events (AE) that occurred during either the infusion or the 
observation period following the infusion which was deemed to be related or possibly related to the study 
medication. At the discretion of the Investigator, AEs occurring after completion of the post infusion 
observation period that were assessed as related could also be considered IARs. The most frequently 
reported protocol-defined IARs by preferred MedDRA term in more than 2 patients in the avalglucosidase alfa 
group were pruritus (7.8%) and urticaria (5.9%) and in the alglucosidase alfa group were nausea (8.2%), 
pruritus (8.2%), and flushing (6.1%). Most IARs in the avalglucosidase alfa group were mild and moderate 
and occurred during infusion and up to 24 hours after the end of the infusion. Protocol-defined severe IARs 
were reported in no patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group and in 2 patients (6 events) in the 
alglucosidase alfa group in the comparative period. 
Standard MedDRA query criteria were used to identify TEAEs that were potentially associated with symptoms 
of hypersensitivity/anaphylactic and immune-mediated reactions. During the primary analysis period, 12 
(23.5%) patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 15 [30.6%] patients in the alglucosidase alfa group 
reported treatment-emergent hypersensitivity events by SMQ. The most common events were pruritus (4 
[7.8%] patients and 5 events in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 4 [8.2%] patients and 9 events in the 
alglucosidase alfa group) and erythema (3 [5.9%] patients and 4 events in the avalglucosidase alfa group 
and 3 [6.1%] patients and 7 events in the alglucosidase alfa group). 
During the comparative period, 12 (23.5%) patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 15 (30.6%) 
patients in the alglucosidase alfa group reported treatment-emergent immune-mediated reactions by SMQ. 
The most common events were arthralgia (5 [9.8%] patients and 6 events in the avalglucosidase alfa group 
and 8 [16.3%] patients and 10 events in the alglucosidase alfa group) and myalgia (5 [9.8%] patients and 
15 events in the avalglucosidase alfa group and 7 [14.3%] patients and 12 events in the alglucosidase alfa 
group). Immune complex-mediated syndromes may result in a heterogeneous array of clinical signs and 
symptoms such as glomerulonephritis, haematuria, proteinuria, papular rash, purpura-like eruptions, 
necrotizing skin lesions, arthritis, serositis, vasculitis, flu like symptoms with fever, myalgia, arthralgia, rash 
and serum sickness. During the study some patients receiving avalglucosidase alfa reported such TEAEs; 
arthralgia (15), myalgia (9), and lymphadenopathy (2), however, none of them had events consistent with 
immune-mediated reactions. There were no reports of glomerulonephritis, necrotizing skin lesions or

proteinuria. All events were mild, resolved in a few days with no change of treatment with study drug, and 
skin or renal biopsies were not performed. A few cases were associated with influenza, but with the exception 
of one participant, start and stop dates differed from the events of arthralgia or myalgia. 
No comparative data are available after the end of PAP since all patients previously randomized to 
alglucosidase alfa were switched to avalglucosidase alfa. The favorable safety and immunogenicity profile of 
avalglucosidase alfa is maintained overall including in patients treated for up to 5.5 years, and no difference 
was observed between patients initially treated with avalglucosidase alfa and patients switching from 
alglucosidase alfa after PAP at the first interim analysis of the ETP (Table 46) and again after another 48 
weeks of treatment (Table 47). At the first interim analysis, patients in the avalglucosidase alfa group had 
been treated for an additional median of 10.58 months and patients in the previous alglucosidase alfa group 
had been treated with avalglucosidase alfa for an additional median of 10.46 months. After another 48 weeks 
of treatment with avalglucosidase alfa, the additional median exposure in the ETP was 21.16 and 19.32 
months. The additional treatment of about one year did not alter the EAIR per 100 patient years much for 
any of the different categories of TEAEs analysed.

In summary, the applicant supports that Nexviadyme provides a wide body of consistent evidence showing 
meaningful and better effect than Myozyme in LOPD patients, on respiratory and motor function, as well as 
HrQoL. While statistical significance for superiority is not seen on the predefined primary endpoint, treatment 
outcomes with Nexviadyme are consistently more favorable than with Myozyme treatment, i.e. allowing 
patients to function at a better level and with improved quality of life; there is no result that clearly favors 
Myozyme. In addition: 
i)  Long-term data also provides evidence of long-term benefit,  
ii)  There is a clinically relevant benefit with Nexviadyme in IOPD patients who clinically stabilize or 
improve after starting treatment with Nexviadyme when they declined or did not respond well with 
Myozyme 
iii)  The safety and immunogenicity profile of Nexviadyme is improved as compared to that of Myozyme.  
Therefore, the applicant maintains that, based on the totality of the clinical data, Nexviadyme provides a 
better solution for patients in the long-term treatment of Pompe disease than Myozyme and qualifies as a 
NAS under Indent 3.

5.1.2.8.  Methods and statistical Discussion 
Pompe disease is a rare disease, the incidence of all types amounts to approximately 1:40 000; the incidence 
of LOPD is approximately 1:60 000 while the most severe form of IOPD alone affects about 1 in 140 000 
newborns (Leslie and Bailey, 2007). The challenges of conducting a clinical trial in conditions with small and 
very small populations is acknowledged by the EMA Guideline on clinical trials in small populations 
(CHMP/EWP/83561/2005), indicating that less conventional and/or less commonly seen methodological 
approaches may be acceptable if they help to improve the interpretability of the study results. The guidance 
highlights the importance of controls and comparator groups, controlled studies with low statistical power in 
case of an important treatment effect may be preferable to no controlled studies even though the 
interpretation will be less clear compared to typically sized phase 3 trials. The guidance also concludes that in 
situations where obtaining controlled evidence on the efficacy and safety of a new treatment is not possible, 
the regulatory assessment may accept different approaches if they ensure that the patients’ interests are 
protected. One important point in this EMA Guideline that supports orphan drug development is that 
“although p<0.05 is a common but arbitrary threshold for ‘statistical significance’, no such value is adequate 
to confirm that a treatment effect truly does exist. In almost all cases, confidence intervals of estimates of 
the treatment effect are much more informative than P-values. … This will always have to be judged in a 
case-by-case basis”. The guidance also indicates that, “for a given size of treatment effect, a larger sample 
size and/or a smaller variance will result in narrower confidence intervals (CI) and more extreme levels of 
statistical significance”. 
Several publications also advocate that superiority should not entirely be ruled out when p is slightly above 
0.05 since p-values alone cannot ensure that a decision is correct or incorrect (Pocock and Ware, 2009, 
Wasserstein and Lazar, 2016, Moher et al, 2010). Particularly when assessing a treatment for a rare disease, 
many contextual factors should be considered to derive scientific inferences. The Consolidated Standards of 
Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement also encourages the use of confidence intervals and states that 
“Authors should particularly avoid the common error of interpreting a non-significant result as indicating 
equivalence of interventions” (Moher et al, 2010). 
The development strategy for avalglucosidase alfa and the design of the studies to support the MAA were 
discussed and agreed with CHMP. The strategy and design also follow the FDA’s recommendation made at the 
end-of-phase 2 meeting for EFC14028 study design: “In addition, instead of directly demonstrating 
superiority, we suggest you consider a non-inferiority (NI) design. We understand that Pompe is a rare 
disease, and recruiting a sufficient number of patients for an NI study with 95%-95% rule can be challenging. 
Therefore you can consider lowering the percentage for the determination of the margin (e.g., 85%).” In 
spite of the recognized challenges and limitations of developing a drug in the setting of a rare disease, a 
robust clinical development plan was conducted to evaluate avalglucosidase alfa in 147 patients (123 adults 
and 24 pediatric patients) with either LOPD (treatment-naïve or previously treated with alglucosidase alfa) or 
IOPD. As recommended, a controlled trial was conducted for both LOPD (study EFC14028) and IOPD (study 
ACT14132). The 2 studies follow the guideline recommendation to provide “relatively small amounts of high-
quality evidence (for example, small randomized trials)”. To our knowledge, study EFC14028 is the first 
occurrence of an active-controlled study in the population of newly diagnosed patients with Pompe disease, 
and study ACT14132 is the first occurrence of an active controlled study in any treatment in patients with 
IOPD.  
The pre-defined primary statistical objective of the study was to demonstrate non-inferiority for % predicted 
FVC, as agreed with regulatory agencies, since recruiting a sufficient number of patients for superiority 
testing would be challenging due to the rarity of Pompe disease. In the EFC14028 study superiority testing 
Assessment report

Page 203/230 
 
 
 
was powered at a larger effect size, based on prior AGLU02704-LOTS and TDR12857 studies. A common 
standard deviation (SD) of 5.1% and a true treatment difference of 3.6% were assumed to have more than 
85% power to demonstrate superiority of avalglucosidase alfa to alglucosidase alfa. A total sample size of 96 
(1:1 randomization ratio) was pre-specified in order to provide approximately 80% power to demonstrate the 
non-inferiority of avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase alfa, assuming the true difference 
(avalglucosidase alfa – alglucosidase alfa) is 2.0% predicted. A statistical power of ≥80% is usually 
considered adequate in small clinical studies (Kianifard, Islam, 2010). In the EFC14028 modified intent-to-
treat (mITT) population, the LS mean change (standard error [SE]) from baseline to Week 49 in % predicted 
FVC was 2.89 (0.88) in the avalglucosidase alfa group, and the difference compared with alglucosidase alfa 
was 2.43 (95% CI: -0.13, 4.99). The lower boundary of 95% CI was -0.13, exceeding -1.1 (the predefined 
NI margin of 1.1) and thus achieving the primary study objective of statistical non-inferiority (p=0.0074). 
However, the p-value for superiority (p=0.0626) was slightly above the pre-specified 5% level of significance 
and the lower bound of the 95% CI was just below 0, thus statistical superiority was not formally 
demonstrated.  
Study EFC14028 was not sufficiently powered to demonstrate superiority in % predicted FVC. With regard to 
the power calculation at the time of the study design, as compared to the assumptions made at the end of 
the trial’s PAP, since a smaller treatment difference (2.43%) and a larger standard deviation (6.83%) were 
observed in study EFC14028, a greater number of patients (evaluated to approximately 2- to 3-fold) would 
have been required to ensure >80% power to formally demonstrate superiority. With regard to reaching 
statistical significance, based on the treatment difference observed during the trial’s PAP, a few more patients 
(approximately 10 more patients) would have provided statistically significant results in study EFC14028. 
Including more patients in a reasonable timeframe is challenging in the context of a rare disease, especially 
in a population of treatment-naïve patients with great variability at baseline. The EMA guideline recognizes 
that “Applications for marketing authorisations in small populations will be judged against the same 
standards as for other products, although limitations on patient recruitment will be taken into account”. The 
minimal detectable difference is 2.51% for the primary endpoint based on a sample of 100 patients with 1:1 
ratio and a common standard deviation of 6.35%. Several sensitivity and post-hoc analyses aiming to 
increase sample size and/or reduce variability are presented in the efficacy section, some of them reached a 
p-value <0.05. 
A less conservative approach might have been selected to evaluate superiority, such as statistical significance 
at 10 % level or a 1-sided test but would have been at higher risk of false positive results. Although 
statistical superiority was not formally achieved, the results are robust as shown in the efficacy section by the 
consistent positive effects observed in various pre-specified and post-hoc sensitivity analyses and in the vast 
majority of clinical outcomes. Therefore, the Applicant maintains that avalglucosidase alfa demonstrated a 
clinically meaningful improvement in % predicted FVC (LS mean change from baseline [SE] +2.89% [0.88]), 
and that the observed benefit was clearly greater compared to alglucosidase alfa (LS mean difference [SE] 
+2.43% [1.29]; 95% CI: -0.13, 4.99). The p-value for superiority (p=0.0626) was very close to the common 
agreed threshold for statistical significance (p<0.05) and the lower end of the 95% CI was very close to 0, 
making it unlikely that there is no difference between avalglucosidase alfa and alglucosidase alfa. Although 
the p-value did not reach 0.05 for the main analysis of % predicted FVC, the evidence in favor of a greater 
effect of avalglucosidase alfa in general is strengthened by the data on all trial outcomes, some even 
achieving p <0.05 nominally.

5.2.  Report from the AHEG 
FINAL AD HOC EXPERT GROUP ANSWERS ON NEXVIADYME (AVALGLUCOSIDASE ALFA) 
1) The development of avalglucosidase alfa was aimed at creating a form of alglucosidase alfa 
with enhanced cellular uptake and thereby a potentially more pronounced therapeutic effect. To 
achieve this, several copies of bis-mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) was conjugated to oxidized sialic 
acid residues on alglucosidase alfa. Please discuss the potential relevance of increased cellular 
uptake based on eg. external support from literature or other scientific sources. 
The experts agreed that the presence and amount of M6P moieties are pivotal for the enzyme replacement 
therapy (ERT) to improve cellular uptake and lysosomal targeting, even if the enzyme is the same protein. 
Cellular uptake and lysosomal targeting are important steps to allow the therapeutic effect to take place 
(1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14). 
It was also explained that the absence of correlation between tissue glycogen depletion and glycosylation is 
expected since the enzyme binding to the receptor occurred in 1:1 ratio through the mannose 6-phosphate 
moieties and an optimal cellular uptake could be reached with 1-1.5 M6P, continuous increase in M6P is not 
expected to have a more pronounced therapeutic effect.  It was further noted that dose comparison between 
Myozyme and Nexviadyme may not be suitable since the M6P content for Myozyme is lower compared to 
Nexviadyme and appeared to have fallen over time, possibly as low as 0.8-0.9 1(15,16,17,18,19). This 
change was viewed as impacting on the biological effect of Myozyme with around one third of the ingredient, 
being possibly therapeutically active. 
From a patient perspective it was commented that most patients decline on Myozyme and considered the 
suboptimal cellular uptake of Myozyme as questionable. At the same time, the patient representative was 
reassured to hear from all the experts that Nexviadyme could address the issue. 
The experts also discussed the correlation between the enzyme activity and the disease progression in 
patients with Pompe. The experts agreed that there was a good correlation, as seen in clinical practice with 
differences in disease progression for IOPD and LOPD patients. However, the experts mentioned that other 
modifying factors can contribute to the clinical progression in addition to the enzyme activity in Pompe 
patients, and thus a dosage adjustment according to patients’ characteristics is theoretically warranted but 
impossible to implement in reality . Whereas there is clear positive dose-response with ERT, there are 
limitations in increasing the dosage treatment most possible related to safety concerns. An expert indicated 
that there is no literature evidence about when a maximum level of enzyme activity can be reached, although 
8 weeks could be a reasonable time to consider. 
Post-meeting note: a list of literature references has been provided to support answers to question 1. 
2) Please discuss if the results of the pivotal phase 3 study can provide support for a meaningful 
clinical impact of the structural modification of Nexviadyme (avalglucosidase alfa) compared to 
Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa). 
1 Upon further evaluation of this information, the Agency concluded that there are no indications that the potency of Myozyme 
would have decreased over time.

Based on the pivotal study EFC14028 results, the experts agreed that Nexviadyme is non inferior to Myozyme 
(non inferiority margin= 1.1%, p=0.0074 on the Force Vital Capacity (FVC)% predicted change from 
baseline). The experts agreed that the FVC % predicted change from baseline, as a primary endpoint was 
relevant, since the effect on the diaphragm muscle was seen as clinically important in Pompe disease, 
particularly as a prognostic factor for patients’ improvement, since respiratory failure is the main life-
threatening complication of Pompe disease.  
The experts considered that the superiority of Nexviadyme over Myozyme cannot be concluded based on the 
primary endpoint results from study EFC14028 as it failed to show superiority from a statistical viewpoint 
(p=0.0626). As regards the respiratory outcome and the importance of statistical significance, one expert 
reminded that in the LOTS trial (14), FVC reached statistical significance compared to the untreated group (in 
which FVC continued to decline; and indeed, in the COMET trial also, the group treated with Myozyme only 
stabilizes), but actually only a stabilization occurred; on the contrary, in the COMET trial, while statistical 
significance was nearly missed (p=0.0626), a clinically meaningful improvement in respiratory function is 
observed. The improvement of other respiratory outcome measures (ie maximal inspiratory pressure) also 
supports an appreciable clinical impact on respiratory function from the expert’s view. 
Nevertheless, the majority of experts were of the view that clinically meaningful improvements were reached 
in clinical endpoints for the respiration, mobility, functional scores such as R-PACT and GSGC score, motor 
function and quality of life (QoL) in patients with LOPD; moreover, for most of these measures, the lower 
limit of the confidence intervals were above zero, suggesting a low or null proportion of non-responders, that 
is another important point to consider since a proportion of patients treated with Myozyme showed a poor 
response already from the beginning. Specifically, a clinically meaningful change in 6MWT has been reported 
ranging from 14-57 meters in different studies conducted in pulmonary disorders (20,21). Whereas there is a 
lack of evidence with regard to other chronic myopathies, some experts expressed the view that due to the 
poor regeneration potential of damaged muscles, it would be expected to observe less clinical differences in 
6MWT in Pompe disease. As such, the observed difference of 30 meters between Nexviadyme and Myozyme 
treatments was considered clinically meaningful in the studied population. 
One expert commented that the pivotal study was not powered to show superiority, due to the small size of 
the population (around 50 patients per group) and considered that the efficacy results for the primary and 
secondary endpoints, altogether were sufficiently convincing that Nexviadyme was superior to Myozyme from 
a clinical perspective. In addition, this expert mentioned that a notable difference in glycogen clearance on 
the diaphragm muscle was observed in non-clinical experiments in mice with 76% vs 16%  for Nexviadyme 
and Myozyme, respectively and that the presented efficacy biomarkers (urinary Hex4 and Creatine Kinase) 
also indicated better results for Nexviadyme as compared to Myozyme. An additional expert also agreed that 
there was sufficient evidence to conclude that Nexviadyme was superior to Myozyme, based on the view 
expressed for question 1. 
But there were as well other experts expressing a different view considering that study ECF14028 failed to 
statistically show superiority on the primary endpoint and that therefore it was not possible to draw 
conclusions on meaningful clinical improvement of Nexviadyme over Myozyme for the secondary endpoints.  
The experts noted the comparative results were available until week 49 and that long term efficacy of 
Nexviadyme remains to be seen. Nevertheless, the experts commented that in general, ERT has shown 
functional improvement that subsequently stabilized to a plateau followed after this, by a decline over the 
years. This can be partly explained by the expected physiological decline with age and probable secondary 
factors. Such observations support a better efficacy of ERT when an earlier start of treatment is done, and 
Assessment report

this has been documented in patients diagnosed throughout newborn screening versus those clinically 
diagnosed later on. However, it also raises the problem with the use of ERT in the long term for these 
patients, when secondary effects (e.g autophagia; mitochondrial dysfunction) occur and cannot be mitigated 
by the ERT. In those circumstances, some experts were of the view that even small clinical improvements in 
ERT treated patients can have greater impact on QoL for patients. This view was shared by both patient 
representatives.  
With regard to the safety, no firm conclusions could be drawn on an improved safety profile of Nexviadyme 
as compared to Myozyme, in the absence of further comparative long term data. One expert observed that 
safety has never been a major concern for Myozyme also, at least for adults, and that it may be difficult to 
demonstrate improved safety in a small population and compare with a product that was already known to be 
generally safe in clinical practice.  In addition, some experts commented that glycosylation can play a role in 
protecting from anti-drug antibodies (ADA) development and were convinced on an improved immunogenicity 
profile, since lesser patients with high ADA titers (>51,200) and infusion reactions were reported in the 
Nexviadyme group (5.8% vs 20.4% and 25.5-32-7% vs 29.4-40.8%, respectively) as compared the 
Myozyme group. One expert  commented to not agree with this statement since the comparative data did not 
contain any statistical results and only a few patients could be included in these short term analyses.  
The experts also noted that there was a lack of efficacy and safety data in IOPD patients and expressed the 
view that comparative data on immunogenicity would have been relevant to collect in this population where a 
more pronounced immunological effect is expected.  
Both patient representatives emphasised the clinical importance of patients reported outcome/QoL 
parameters. In particular, a call was made to collect information on the effect on fatigue.

This part of the assessment report evaluates the Applicant’s claim to the first indent of the definition of NAS: 
“a chemical, biological or radiopharmaceutical substance not previously authorised in a medicinal product for 
human use in the European Union”. The first indent addresses the active substance structure only without 
considering evidence on the potential clinical implications of its structure or part of the structure. 
Background 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021

Currently, Myozyme (alglucosidase alfa; not an orphan medicinal product anymore (since 2016)), is the only 
approved enzyme replacement therapy and is the current standard of care for Pompe disease. Alglucosidase 
alfa is targeted to the lysosome of cardiac and skeletal muscle by the cation independent mannose-6-
phosphate receptor (CIMPR). Alglucosidase alfa has extremely low levels of bis-M6P- N-linked glycans, the 
bivalent ligand required for high affinity binding to the CIMPR.  
The molecular structures of avalglucosidase alfa (Nexviadyme) and alglucosidase alfa are described in 
sufficient detail in the dossier of the original procedure and specific features highlighted in the grounds for re-
examination.  In the manufacturing process of avalglucosidase alfa, alglucosidase alfa is expressed and 
further purified and processed to be conjugated with several copies of a synthetic glycan (bisM6P). This 
glycan, and the linker, is specifically selected to optimize the target receptor binding properties of the 
molecule and is conjugated to all seven N-glycosylation sites on alglucosidase alfa. Consequently, a molecule 
of avalglucosidase alfa contains seven copies of bisM6P. Each bisM6P is conjugated to a sialic acid on the 
alglucosidase alfa, via a linker. The natural post-translational process for alglucosidase alfa results in two 
sites observed to potentially present phosphorylated mannose type glycans.  
In their re-examination request, the Applicant refers to the variation regulation, the EMA  
guideline on similar biological medicinal products (CHMP/437/04 Rev 1), the orphan regulation, the WHO 
INN, and the ATC code to elaborate their case further. 
Established practice 
It has been consistent CHMP practice to apply the first indent verbatim, as follows:  
An active substance that is not previously authorised in a medicinal product for human use in the European 
Union and that is from a structural point of view not related to any other authorised substances should be 
considered as a NAS. Such substance is considered to be new in itself (i.e. first indent) when the 
administration of the applied active substance would not expose patients to the same therapeutic moiety as 
already authorised active substance(s) in the European Union2. Cases where active substances are 
structurally related and where the administration of the applied active substance does expose patients to the 
same therapeutic moiety, fall under the third indent.  
Assessment of NAS claim for Nexviadyme based on first indent 
If the biological active substance is structurally related to an already approved active substance(s) in the EU, 
it should first be assessed whether it shares the same therapeutic moiety at the site of the biological activity 
as the already approved active substance. If the answer is in the negative, then the active substance is a 
NAS in itself (indent 1). On the contrary, if the answer is in the affirmative, the candidate active substance 
may only be granted NAS status if it differs significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy 
(indent 3, discussed below). This principle has been used consistently in previous NAS assessments for 
biologicals.  In addition, the same principle is in analogy to the criteria set out in the reflection paper on the 
determination of NAS status for chemical active substances. 
For qualification as a NAS, the main molecular entity should be demonstrated to be more than slightly 
different from the basic structural element(s) contained in a medicinal product authorised in the EU (that is, 
at the EU level or national level). The main molecular entity is considered to be the basic structural 
element(s) without added functional structures. 
2 This principle, with slightly different/targeted wording is laid down in https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/chemical-structure-
properties-criteria-be-considered-evaluation-new-active-substance-nas-status 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 209/230 
 
 
 
 
 
For proteins, the amino acid sequence is considered as the basic structural element. Proteins containing 
differences in the amino acid sequence would normally be considered NAS. Importantly, changes introduced 
in the basic structural element should not be trivial (for example a conservative mutation of an amino acid 
only) in order to be sufficiently substantial to warrant a conclusion of NAS.  
Where a molecular structure with the same basic structural element is produced but has additional post-
translational modifications, such a structure would normally be considered as known active substance unless 
it can be shown that these modifications have a clinical impact in terms of safety or efficacy (such impact 
would be evaluated under indent 3). Where additional molecular structures are chemically attached as part of 
the downstream manufacturing process, that is covalently bound, with or without a linker to the basic 
structural element and such structures are not present in the authorised product, or located at different 
positions within this basic structural element, the whole molecule would normally be considered as known 
active substance, unless it can be shown that these modifications have a clinical impact in terms of safety or 
efficacy (such impact would be evaluated under indent 3). 
The amino acid sequences of alglucosidase alfa and avalglucosidase alfa are the same. The synthetic glycans 
conjugated to the amino acid backbone are not considered part of the basic structural element. Therefore, 
the therapeutic moiety that the patient is exposed to, is the same, and a first indent NAS claim cannot be 
granted. 
This conclusion is consistent with the previous CHMP positions on Rekovelle and Zinbryta. In both cases the 
NAS claim under indent 1 was not accepted (same aminoacid sequences to authorised products) and the 
applicants were asked to demonstrate that the difference in glycosylation had an impact on safety and/or 
efficacy (i.e. under indent 3). 
It is also noted that increased in vitro target receptor affinity and increased cellular uptake is demonstrated 
for avalglucosidase alfa in comparison to alglucosidase alfa. The impact of the difference in increased binding 
to soluble CIMPR, in terms of translation to a clinical effect is unknown. The same limitation applies to the 
increased cellular uptake observed in Pompe fibroblast cells and proteolytic processing to the most active 
form as shown by Western blot. However, these results fall outside the assessment under indent 1 and will 
therefore be further elaborated under indent 3. 
Assessment of claims based on other documents 
In general, it is noted that NAS for biologicals is only defined in the NtA. Consequently, claims cannot be 
defended by applicants on the basis of other documents which a) have a different scope and b) do not define 
or further elaborate on how to support a NAS claim.   
Therefore, references to the variation regulation and the guideline on similar biological products are 
considered not appropriate in this context as they do not provide guidance on how NAS claims should be 
supported.  
The CHMP noted that the variation regulation acknowledges that active substances may be variable and that 
minor differences, if properly justified by the applicant do not block approval of a “replacement of a biological 
active substance with one of a slightly different molecular structure where the efficacy and/or safety 
characteristics are not significantly different”.  
The guideline on similar biological products, states verbatim ‘Intended changes to improve efficacy (e.g. 
glycooptimisation) are not compatible with the biosimilarity approach.’ In other words, an applicant must 
either claim that an active substance is similar (in which case it can be a biosimilar) or that it is different 
(where glyco-optimisation, with claimed different safety and/or efficacy, is given as an example only). If 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 210/230 
 
 
 
similarity is claimed, then the applicant should prove that observed variability is slight and not clinically 
relevant. If differences/newness is claimed, then the applicant should prove that the observed variability is 
clinically relevant.  
The principal molecular structural features (PMSF) considerations, as provided in orphan legislation, are not 
applicable for NAS assessment since it does not deal with market exclusivity. 
INN assignment does not substantiate NAS status based on the NtA, as the criteria for INN assignment and 
NAS status are not the same. The INN is assigned by WHO and this takes place in advance of the evaluation 
of a MAA and it is based on a more limited data package. Therefore, the existence of a distinct INN can only 
be considered supportive and not pivotal to claim NAS status. 
Likewise, the criteria applied by WHO for the assignment of the ATC code are not the same as the criteria for 
the NAS.  
For the reasons mentioned above (the conclusion regarding molecular structure and the assessment of the 
different points raised by the Applicant), avalglucosidase alfa is not considered to qualify as a new active 
substance under indent 1 of the NAS definition. Any potential impact to clinical efficacy or safety is assessed 
under the claim to indent 3. As noted above, this conclusion is consistent with the previous CHMP positions 
on Rekovelle and Zinbryta. 
CHMP position on Ground #2  
At the applicant request, the AHEG was convened and the CHMP requested their view on the  meaningful 
clinical impact of the structural modification of Nexviadyme (see 5.2).  
Non-clinical considerations 
Zhu et al. (2009) compared a single concentration of avalglucosidase alfa (20 mg/kg) with rhGAA (20 and 
100 mg/kg) in a murine model for Pompe disease. During functional evaluation avalglucosidase alfa appeared 
to be more effective in young animals with increased potency, whereas in elderly animals 40 mg/kg 
avalglucosidase alfa is deemed to be equipotent to rhGAA dosed at 40 and 100 mg/kg. A stringent dose-
dependency for efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa is not shown, so that potency is hard to be evaluated. 
Since the glycosylation of avalglucosidase alfa is claimed to be responsible for efficacy, various glycan 
conjugates have been investigated in study 09-3981. It is clear, that there is no stringent correlation 
between incrementing avalglucosidase alfa glycosylation and tissue glycogen depletion in triceps, quadriceps, 
psoas and diaphragm. Importantly, avalglucosidase alfa conjugates were significantly less effective than 
alglucosidase in reducing glycogen in skeletal muscles in this study. Thus, again a consistent effect on 
efficacy is not documented. In the line of the latter observations there is no increase in glycogen depletion 
upon incrementing the dose from 12 to 20 mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa in triceps, psoas and diaphragm (study 
10-00587). Conversely, rhGAA increments efficacy upon switching from 60 to 100 mg/kg. Thus, it is 
completely unclear why an increased potency of avalglucosidase alfa does not translate into an increased 
efficacy consistently.The CHMP noted the comment from the AHEG that the absence of correlation between 
tissue glycogen depletion and glycosylation is expected since the enzyme binding to the receptor occurred in 
1:1 ratio through the mannose 6-phosphate moieties and an optimal cellular uptake could be reached with 1-
1.5 M6P, continuous increase in M6P is not expected to have a more pronounced therapeutic effect. 
Subsequently the applicant argued and though the ratio of enzyme to CIMPR binding is 1:1, there is a dose 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 211/230 
 
 
 
 
responsive increase in CIMPR binding, cell uptake and glycogen clearance with increasing levels of M6P. From 
the applicant’s point of view cell uptake increases with increasing glycan content with a plateau following the 
conjugation of more than 3 glycans. This is based on the submitted non-clinical data in Pompe mice in which 
the conjugation of at least 3 glycans were needed to see maximal glycogen clearance following 4-weekly 
doses (Study 09-3981). Since alglucosidase alfa contains, on average, 1 M6P, the applicant considered that 
these data demonstrate that at least 7 M6P (from 3 bisM6P glycans and 1 M6P present on alglucosidase alfa) 
are required for maximal pharmacodynamic effect, not 1-1.5 M6P. 
Acknowledging the different AHEG and applicant views with regards to the optimal M6P content required for a 
maximal  therapeutic  effect,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  from  a  preclinical  perspective,  results  point 
towards an improved efficacy of avalglucosidase alfa, since the M6P content for Myozyme is lower compared to 
Nexviadyme. Avalglucosidase alfa showed an improved potency in terms of tissue glycogen reduction compared 
to rhGAA which varies between 3-7 fold. However, due to variability in efficacy between different tissues, and 
also an apparent plateau effect at higher doses of avalglucosidase alfa, overall superiority of avalglucosidase 
alfa could not be concluded based on non-clinical PD studies. 
In preclinical experiments there is no indication of improved safety of avalglucosidase alfa over rhGAA. 
Results on immunogenicity that had been collected in most of the preclinical studies are inconclusive; thus, 
immunogenicity is higher for avalglucosidase alfa compared to rhGAA in studies 07-1948 and 10-00587. The 
avalglucosidase alfa conjugates to various glycans, in contrast, resulted in less anti-drug antibody titres 
(study 09-3981) than rhGAA.  
In conclusion, the preclinical database on avalglucosidase alfa does not allow to support the NAS claim. 
Clinical efficacy considerations 
The EMA guideline on clinical trials in small populations (CHMP/EWP/83561/2005) highlights that most 
indications in rare diseases follow the usual methodological requirements. More importantly, it states that 
deviations from expected standards should be pre-planned and fully justified. The guideline also specifies that 
any justification for deviations from generally accepted rules should be done prospectively (i.e. in the study 
protocol), and that an orphan drug status is not sufficient justification in itself. The use of less conventional 
methods was not pre-specified and prospectively justified. Claims of superiority of avalglucosidase alfa based 
on secondary, sensitivity or post-hoc analyses were therefore not agreed from a methodological point of 
view. 
Several post-hoc analyses to support the clinical efficacy data in patients with LOPD were conducted: 
-  Responder analyses have been performed with thresholds based on PGIC Ability to Breathe used as 
an anchor. The results appear to be consistent with pre-specified analyses. 
-  An analysis is provided where treatment-naïve patients from historical study ALGLU02704/LOTS who 
received alglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg qow are pooled with patients randomized to alglucosidase alfa 
in study EFC14028. Baseline characteristics are said to be adjusted for, but no information is 
provided on the statistical methods used to perform these analyses. More generally, it should be 
noted that there are clear limitations associated with the use of external control data, as the presence 
of bias is likely and difficult to quantify.  
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 212/230 
 
 
 
-  Another analysis is provided where treatment-naïve patients who received avalglucosidase alfa 20 
mg/kg qow in study TDR12857/LTS13769 are pooled with patients randomised to avalglucosidase 
alfa in EFC14028. Similar limitations apply. 
-  A sensitivity analysis has been performed when excluding the largest worsening in the 
avalglucosidase alfa group, considered to be an outlier. As acknowledged by the Applicant, removing 
a single (and the smallest) value from the avalglucosidase alfa group is debatable, and a potential 
under- or over-estimation cannot be concluded based on this analysis. 
- 
The Bayesian analysis is used by the Applicant to provide probabilistic statements on the parameter 
of interest (mean treatment difference in %predicted FVC). This is helpful for interpretation purposes, 
however it does not actually provide new information compared to the original frequentist analysis 
(the posterior distribution being essentially the same as the likelihood in the absence of an 
informative prior). 
-  Cumulative probability functions are also provided to visualise the endpoint distribution 
These analyses provided an estimate of treatment effect consistent with the primary analysis estimate and 
other pre-specified analysis results. However, they are not pre-planned and some of them are potentially 
biased or do not bring additional information.  
Regarding the long-term efficacy of alglucosidase alfa, a decline in respiratory and motor function was 
observed after 2-3 years of treatment. However, this is based on retrospective observations. Furthermore, an 
update of the 97-week (2 years) data from the pivotal study did not appear to show a continuous 
improvement of the avalglucosidase effect on 6MWT and FCV but rather a stabilisation. 
Considering the uncertainties of the 2-year data for avalglucosidade alfa and the fact that the long-term efficacy 
data  of  alglucosidase  alfa  after  2-3  years  of  treatment  are  based  on  observational  studies,  it  is  difficult  to 
conclude  on  a  difference  in  long-term  efficacy  of  avalglucosidase  compared  to  alglucosidase.  Additional six-
year data from long term extension study were also presented and only confirmed that effect on FVC and 6MWT 
could  be  sustained  but  comparison  to  alglucosidase  is  limited  and  no  new  conclusions  could  be  drawn  from 
these data.  
Post-hoc ANCOVA analyses were also performed on the trial to further assess efficacy endpoints in patients 
with IOPD (Study ACT14132/Mini-COMET), and updated long-term data were provided on a more recent cut-
off (30th April 2021). These analyses are of exploratory or descriptive nature.  
Due to the design, the small size, and the descriptive nature of the results in secondary and tertiary efficacy 
outcomes, this study does not allow to deliver conclusions on avalglucosidase alfa efficacy in this setting.  
Taken together, these additional analyses, while showing consistency with previously submitted results, do 
not provide sufficient evidence to change the conclusions on avalglucosidase alfa efficacy compared to 
alglucosidase alfa. 
The majority of the AHEG experts were of the view that clinically meaningful improvements were reached in 
clinical endpoints for the respiration, mobility, functional scores such as R-PACT and GSGC score, motor function 
and quality of life (QoL) in patients with LOPD; moreover, for most of these measures, the lower limit of the 
confidence intervals were above zero, suggesting a low or null proportion of non-responders. Nevertheless, the 
demonstration of superiority of avalglucosidase alfa over alglucosidase alfa in the primary endpoint % predicted 
FVC at Week 49 was missed at the required significance level, and the CHMP therefore remains of the opinion 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 213/230 
 
 
 
that all subsequent statistical tests for the secondary endpoints in the pre-specified hierarchy could not formally 
be carried out. under adequate experiment wise type-1-error control. 
Clinical safety considerations 
Alteration or masking of epitopes by the additional bisM6P-hexamannose glycans added to the N-linked 
glycan structures already present in alglucosidase alfa is hypothesized, which could disrupt epitopes in the 
molecule or cause increased steric interference of ADA binding. At this stage, the relevant and direct impact 
of the chemical modifications (glycosylation) of the molecular structure on the safety of avalglucosidase alfa 
versus alglucosidase alfa in IOPD and LOPD patients, notably regarding their immunology profile, cannot be 
established considering the main following limitations hampering data robustness:  
- 
- 
- 
low number of exposed patients; 
need of long-term comparative safety data (EFC14028 PAP duration was 49 weeks with 49 LOPD 
naïve patients randomized to alglucosidase alfa and 51 naïve LOPD patients to avalglucosidase alfa);  
low number of ADA positive patients in each peak titer categories in study EFC14028; confounding 
influence of previous exposure to alglucosidase alfa in the 22 IOPD patients in study ACT14132, all 
experienced (PAP duration of 6 months, 16 patients randomized to avalglucosidase alfa and 6 to 
alglucosidase alfa);  
- 
confusing definition and assessment of AE relationship to treatment. 
The  CHMP  noted  that  no  firm  conclusions  could  be  drawn  on  an  improved  safety  profile  of  Nexviadyme  as 
compared to Myozyme by the AHEG, in the absence of further comparative long term data. 
In view of the provided efficacy and safety data, no clinically significant difference could be demonstrated. 
Therefore, the CHMP maintains it view that avalglucosidase alfa in comparison to alglucosidase alfa  
previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union is not to be qualified as a new active 
substance as insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate that it differs significantly in properties 
with regard to safety and/or efficacy from the previously authorised substance.

the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to determine the 
forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
5.6.  Product information 
5.6.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
5.6.2.  Labelling exemptions 
A request to omit certain particulars from the labelling as per Art.63.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reason: vial 
label does not have the space necessary to display all required information in a suitable and readable font 
size.  
The particulars to be omitted as per the QRD Group decision described above will however be included in the 
Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, and translated in all languages but will appear in grey-
shaded to show that they will not be included on the printed materials.  
5.6.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Nexviadyme (avalglucosidase alfa) is included in 
the additional monitoring list as it is a biological product, which will be authorised after 1 January 2011. 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

6.1.  Therapeutic Context 
6.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Avalglucosidase alfa is intended for long-term enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of patients 
with Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase deficiency). 
Pompe disease is a rare, autosomal recessive genetic disease caused by the deficiency of lysosomal acid alpha-
glucosidase (GAA). Defects in both alleles of the gene for GAA, located on chromosome 17q25, result in reduced 
or absent enzyme activity, leading to progressive intralysosomal accumulation of undegraded glycogen. The 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 220/230 
 
 
 
resulting damage to affected cells produces a range of symptoms that characterize Pompe disease, including 
metabolic myopathy leading to neuromuscular dysfunction and ultimately death.  
Currently, over 500 mutations of GAA, including missense, nonsense, splicing defect, and frameshift mutations, 
have been found. According to the variety of mutations, clinical presentation of Pompe disease is heterogeneous 
in timing, severity, and ranges of symptoms observed. The disease is classified into different phenotypes based 
on age at onset of symptoms, extent of organ involvement, and rate of progression to death. The phenotypes 
range from a rapidly progressive infantile-onset form (IOPD) characterized by virtually complete absence (less 
than 1%) of acid alpha-glucosidase (GAA)-activity to a more slowly progressive late-onset form (LOPD).  
Infantile-onset Pompe disease (IOPD), which represents up to one third of the cases, becomes manifest in the 
first months of life. Affected patients present with creatinine kinase elevations, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(HCM), failure to thrive, muscular hypotonia and axial muscle weakness. IOPD is rapidly progressive, and the 
majority of untreated subjects die within the first year of life due to a combination of ventilatory and cardiac 
failure without achieving any motor milestones such as turning, sitting, or standing. Survival beyond the age 
of 18 months is exceptional.  
The majority of patients with Pompe disease present after infancy with late-onset Pompe disease (LOPD), which 
takes  a  more  variable  course.    In  untreated  patients,  undegraded  glycogen  accumulates  in  diaphragm  and 
respiratory muscles, and respiratory function declines over time, leading to dependence to external ventilation 
and, ultimately, to respiratory failure which is the most common cause of death regardless of age of disease 
onset.  Glycogen  also  accumulates  in  skeletal  muscles,  and  motor  function  declines  over  time,  leading  to 
problems with activities of daily living, reduced mobility, and eventually dependence on wheelchair. Quality of 
life is usually severely affected by the burden of the disease. 
The estimated global incidence of Pompe disease is 1:40 000, with variations in incidence reported between 
different  ethnic  groups  and  clinical  forms.  Avalglucosidase  alfa  gained  Orphan  designation  in  2014  with  an 
estimated number of affected patients below 1/10,000 people in the EU, equivalent to around 51,000 people. 
6.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Development and approval of ERT has profoundly changed the natural course of the disease, revealing new 
phenotypes in patients with classical IOPD who survive with ERT, and considerably extending productivity and 
quality of life for patients with LOPD. However, it is recognized that the progressive decline in muscle function 
in patients with Pompe disease is not completely abrogated with alglucosidase alfa ERT. 
Studies in LOPD patients suggest that some patients on alglucosidase alfa continue to exhibit some decline in 
respiratory function, albeit at a slower pace than prior to treatment. Responses to treatment in LOPD patients 
vary and there might be room for improvement in individual patients, but overall there is not a huge unmet 
medical need in this population.  
With  respect  to  IOPD  patients,  literature  data  (Chien  et  al,  2015)  indicate  that  some  patients  treated  with 
Myozyme  exhibit  declines in  motor  function  and  mobility  starting  at 18-24  months  of  age,  despite  an initial 
decrease in CK levels. The reasons for the variable efficacy of ERT and the progression of disease with time are 
manifold and only imperfectly understood. Known factors include age at start of therapy and pre-treatment 
muscle pathology, CRIM-status and antibody titers, distribution of type I and II fibers, and altered autophagy 
(Kishnani et al., 2012). 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 221/230 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Although ERT has substantially improved the prognosis of IOPD, mortality is still considerable, and decline of 
motor function over time is frequent in long-term survivors. Thus, further efforts  are  necessary  to  improve  
the  outcome  of  children  affected  by  this  most  severe form of Pompe disease, indicating an unmet medical 
need in IOPD patients deteriorating on the available ERT. 
6.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study EFC14028 (COMET) in LOPD population 
The  main  evidence  of  efficacy  comes  from  a  single  phase  III  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind  study 
comparing avalglucosidase alfa (n=51) to alglucosidase alfa (n=49) in treatment-naïve LOPD patients from 3 
years of age. The study comprises a primary analysis period (49 weeks) followed by an extended treatment 
period. The primary objective of study EFC14028 was to determine the effect of avalglucosidase alfa treatment 
on respiratory muscle strength as measured by forced vital capacity (FVC)% predicted in the upright position, 
as compared to alglucosidase alfa.  
The primary statistical objective was to test the non-inferiority (NI) of avalglucosidase alfa versus alglucosidase 
alfa at 5% level of significance. The non-inferiority (NI) of avalglucosidase alfa to alglucosidase alfa was to be 
investigated first before progressing to investigation of superiority. 
Secondary objectives were to determine the safety and effect of avalglucosidase alfa treatment on functional 
endurance  (6MWT,  key  secondary  endpoint),  inspiratory  muscle  strength  (MIP),  expiratory  muscle  strength 
(MEP), lower extremity muscle strength (HHD), motor function (QMFT), and health related quality of life (SF-
12).  
Study ACT14132 (Mini-COMET) in IOPD population 
Additional  evidence  of  efficacy  comes  from  a  multicenter,  multistage  phase  II,  open-label,  ascending  dose 
cohort  study  in  22  patients  under  18  years  of  age  with  IOPD,  who  were  previously  treated  (treatment-
experienced) with alglucosidase alfa for at least 6 months. The study comprises a primary analysis period (week 
25)  followed  by  an  extended  treatment  period.  The  primary  objective  of  the  ACT14132  study  was  the 
assessment  of  safety  and  tolerability  of  administering  avalglucosidase  alfa.  The  secondary  objectives  were 
characterization of the pharmacokinetic profile of avalglucosidase alfa and evaluation of the preliminary efficacy 
of  avalglucosidase  alfa  in  comparison  to  alglucosidase  alfa.  Efficacy  endpoints  in  ACT14132  included  motor 
function  (evaluated  through  functional  and  clinical  outcome  assessments  and  6-minute  walk  test  [6MWT]), 
respiratory function (evaluated through pulmonary functional testing [PFT] and ventilator use questionnaire), 
quality of life, pain, cardiac function (echocardiography) and eyelid position measurements. 
6.2.  Favourable effects 
LOPD population 
• 
• 
The main evidence of efficacy and safety is based on a randomized, double-blind, active controlled study 
including 100 patients.  The  active  comparator  was  alglucosidase  alfa,  an  approved  medicinal  product of 
established therapeutic value, and currently the standard of care. 
The  primary  objective  of  the  Phase  3  study  EFC14028  was  met  by  demonstrating  non-inferiority  of 
respiratory function as measured by % predicted FVC as compared to alglucosidase alfa at week 49. In the 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021 
Page 222/230 
 
 
 
 
mITT  population,  the  LS  mean  change  from  baseline  to  Week  49  in  %  predicted  FVC  was  2.89  in  the 
avalglucosidase alfa group and 0.46 in the alglucosidase alfa group. The difference in mean change (from 
baseline to Week 49) of 2.43 with lower boundary of 95% CI of -0.13 exceeded the predefined NI margin 
of -1.1 and thus achieved statistical significance (95% CI: -0.13, 4.99; p=0.0074) 
•  Results  of  a  pre-planned  sensitivity  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy  endpoint  done  in  the  PP  population 
support the non-inferiority conclusion: LS mean difference FVC% predicted at week 49 was 2.69 (95% CI: 
-0.06, 5.44; p=0.0076). 
• 
The LS mean difference in distance walked in meters in the 6MWT (key secondary endpoint) was 30.01 
(95% CI:1.33, 58.69). 
•  Subgroup analyses for study EFC14028 (primary efficacy endpoint, % predicted FVC), performed by age 
group  (<18  years,  ≥18  years  to  <45  years,  ≥45  years  old),  gender,  baseline  FVC  groups  (<55%,  and ≥
55%), region, baseline walking device use, baseline 6MWT distance, duration of disease at baseline, and 
race indicate consistency of results across subgroups. 
IOPD population 
The descriptive results of study ACT14132 show positive trends (stabilization or improvement) in secondary 
and  tertiary  efficacy  outcomes  with  avalglucosidase.  During  the  primary  analysis  period (PAP),  Gross  Motor 
Function  Measure-88  (GMFM-88)  mean  scores  increased  modestly  from  baseline  to  Week  25  in  all  four 
treatment groups (Cohort 1: 2.62, Cohort 2: 3.54, Cohort 3: AVAL: 4.20, AGLU: 6.82) 
Home infusion 
•  As of 31 May 2021, 15 patients have ever received home infusion in trials (LTS13769 [N = 2], EFC14028 
[N = 11] and ACT14132 [N = 2]). Few non-serious events was reported at the first administration at home 
(eyelid edema and flushing), which was treated appropriately and resolved at the same day. Current data 
do not indicate an increased risk of IARs or medication errors with home infusion in adults. No medication 
error occurred in the setting of home infusion. 
6.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
LOPD population 
• 
The pivotal trial was performed in adult LOPD patients, only two subjects were below the age of 18 years 
and included a 9 years old patient that was enrolled after the study cut-off date of 10 March 2020. Evidence 
for efficacy and safety of  avalglucosidase in the paediatric population is limited to 22 previously treated 
IOPD patients > 6 months of age in the open-label phase 2 study (ACT14132). 
•  Demonstration of superiority of avalglucosidase alfa over alglucosidase alfa in % predicted FVC at Week 49 
was missed in Study EFC14028 at the 5% significance level (p= 0.0626). Since superiority could not be 
demonstrated  for  the  primary  endpoint,  all  subsequently  planned  statistical  superiority  tests  for  the 
secondary endpoints in the pre-specified hierarchy could formally not be carried out under adequate control 
of the experimentwise type-1-error. 
•  Despite  some  of  the  investigated  efficacy  parameters  showed  a  positive  trend  for  better  outcome  with 
avalglucosidase  alfa;  many  of  these  endpoints  were  correlated  and  are  measured  in  the  same  patients. 
Further  significance  testing  was  also  hampered  by  the  lack  of  demonstration  of  superiority  in  study 
EFC14028. 
Assessment report  
EMA/708926/2021

• 
The overall performance of alglucosidase alfa (i.e. LS mean change from baseline to Week 49 in FVC %: 
0.46,  in  6MWT:  2.19  meters)  was  notably  poorer  than  in  the  registration  trial  for  alglucosidase  alfa 
(ALGLU02704/LOTS). In the LOTS trial the estimated change  in  FVC, expressed as a percentage of each 
patient’s predicted  value,  was  an  increase  of  1.2  percentage points at week 78 (1.73 at week 49) for 
the patients who received alglucosidase alfa. Furthermore, patients in the LOTS trial had a mean increase 
of 25.1 m on the 6-minute walk test by week 78. It is however acknowlegded that the results observed in 
the alglucosidase alfa group in Study EFC14028 are likely influenced by a randomized population different 
to the one randomized in Study AGLU02704. 
• 
 Data on long-term efficacy are limited. Extended treatment periods of the clinical trials are still ongoing. 
At the cut-off date of 19 March 2020, 91 patients were enrolled in the ongoing ETP; efficacy data at 97 
weeks were available for 24 patients who had since study start continuously received avalglucosidase alfa 
and for 21 patients who switched from alglucosidase alfa to avalglucosidase alfa treatment after 49 weeks.  
After Week 49, FVC slightly decreased in patients continuing with avalglucosidase alfa. 
IOPD population 
• 
There is lack of data in treatment-naive IOPD patients under the age of 6 months. 
•  No formal dose-response studies have been performed. The 20 mg/kg dose was selected based on the 
clinical experience with alglucosidase alfa and results from non-clinical studies and the safety and 
exploratory efficacy results from the ascending dose phase 1 study TDR12857. 
• 
The investigation in IOPD patients is limited to a pre-treated population in study ACT14132 (Mini-COMET), 
including 22 patients (Cohort 1 (n=6): 20 mg/kg AVAL, Cohort 2 (n=5): 40 mg/kg AVAL, Cohort 3 (n=11): 
5 patients 40 mg/kg AVAL and 6 patients AGLU at various doses). The primary objective of the ACT14132 
study was the assessment of safety and tolerability of avalglucosidase alfa. The secondary objectives were 
characterization  of  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  and  the  evaluation  of  the  preliminary  efficacy  of 
avalglucosidase alfa in comparison to alglucosidase alfa. The highest improvement was seen in Cohort 3, 
in the alglucosidase alfa group. Consistently to the results of the GMFM-88, the greatest degree of change 
in the Quick motor function test (QMFT)–total score was observed in the alglucosidase alfa group (5.17 vs. 
4.25  in  the  AVAL  group  of  Cohort  3).  Due  to  its  design  and  small  size  the  study  cannot  deliver  firm 
conclusions on avalglucosidase´s efficacy and safety in this setting. Moreover, the proposed higher starting 
dose in IOPD patients (40 mg/kg) has not been demonstrated to be more suitable than the 20 mg/kg dose 
proposed in LOPD patients. 
• 
IOPD  patients  with  higher  anti-alglucosidase  alfa  antibody  titers  (≥1:25600)  have  been  excluded  from 
clinical studies. 
Home infusion 
•  Home  infusion  is  an  established  practice  for  some  other  ERTs.  However  limited  data  are  available  for 
avalglucosidase alfa and have been supplemented by the clinical experience with alglucosidase alfa. For 
IOPD patients, no data on home infusion are available. The risks related to home infusion is reflected in 
the RMP as important potential risk and will be reported in the PSURs.

6.4.  Unfavourable effects 
LOPD and IOPD populations 
• 
In  the  ETS  period  of  study  ACT14132,  only  one  patient,  who  received  20  mg/kg  avalglucosidase  alfa, 
developed a transient ADA response, whereas in the cohort, who received 40 mg/kg, 5 out of 10 patients 
(50%) developed a treatment emergent ADA response.  
•  50%  of  adult  and  30%  of  paediatric  patients  reported  TEAEs  potentially  related  to  avalglucosidase 
treatment. 
• 
IARs were reported by 26.1% of all patients studied, mostly 0-2 hours after infusion started. 
•  Anaphylactic reactions were reported by 8 patients, 4 naïve and 4 experienced patients. 
•  Six of the 60 patients experiencing hypersensitivity had hypersensitivity events that were considered by 
the Investigator to be severe, a TESAE, or both. 
•  AVAL IAR events in %: ADA peak titer ≥12 800 (53.8%, 7 of 13 patients) compared to patients with ADA 
titer 1600-6400 (17.2%, 5 of 29 patients), ADA low response titer 100-800 (7.1%, 1 of 14 patients), and 
patients who were ADA negative (33.3%, 1 of 3 patients). 
•  AVAL Hypersensitivity events in %: ADA titers: 100-800 peak titer (14.3%), 1600-6400 peak titer (27.6%) 
and ≥12 800 peak titer (30.8%) 
6.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
IOPD population 
• 
The proposed higher starting dose of 40 mg/kg in IOPD patients is mainly based on recent publications of 
clinical experience in IOPD patients receiving alglucosidase alfa doses greater or at higher frequency than 
the label dose of 20 mg/kg qow (Chien, 2015, J Pediatr; Case, 2015, Neuromusc Disord). So far there are 
only very limited data with 40mg/kg avalglucosidase alfa from study ACT14132 (in total 10 patients in the 
PAP received the 40 mg/kg dose; cut-off date 30 April: during ETP all but 2 patients switched to the 40 
mg/kg AVAL resulting in 20 patients currently treated with the highest dose of 40 mg/kg).  
•  So far, there are no data on avalglucosidase alfa in an ERT treatment naïve IOPD population. Treatment-
experienced IOPD and LOPD patients appear to have some degree of attenuation of immunologic response, 
possibly  due  to  development  of  immunologic  tolerance  given  the  shared  protein  structure  of  aval-  and 
alglucosidase.  
• 
Patients at high-risk for experiencing a severe allergic reaction to avalglucosidase alfa (i.e. patients who 
had previously severe anaphylactic reaction to alglucosidase alfa and/or a history of high sustained IgG 
antibody titers to alglucosidase alfa) were excluded from the phase 2 study in IOPD patients.  
Paediatric LOPD and IOPD populations 
• 
The  number  of  paediatric  patients  is  very  limited:  In  total,  24  paediatric  patients  were  treated  with 
avalglucosidase alfa, 22 IOPD patients, and 2 paediatric/juvenile LOPD patients.

6.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Despite  some  uncertainties  regarding  effect  size  and  less  severely  affected  studied  population,  efficacy  of 
avalglucosidase  alfa  could  be  convincingly  demonstrated  in  the  phase  3  study  in  LOPD  patients  by  showing 
non-inferiority in % predicted FVC compared to alglucosidase alfa. Although some of the investigated efficacy 
parameters showed a positive trend for better outcome with avalglucosidase alfa, many of these endpoints are 
correlated and are measured in the same patients. Most importantly, however, demonstration of superiority of 
avalglucosidase alfa over alglucosidase alfa in the primary endpoint % predicted FVC at Week 49 was missed 
at the required significance level. Accordingly, all subsequently conducted statistical tests for the secondary 
endpoints in the pre-specified hierarchy could formally not be carried out under adequate experimentwise type-

1-error  control.  Hence,  any  reference  in  the  discussion  of  trial  outcome  for  these  endpoints  indicating  an 
advantage of avalglucosidase alfa over alglucosidase alfa is not permissible and a conclusion of demonstrated 
superiority is not possible. 
Additional evidence for the paediatric population solely comes from phase 3 study EFC14028 and the phase 2 
study ACT14132 in previously treated IOPD patient > 6 months. However, due to its design and small size of 
study ACT14132 , the study cannot deliver firm conclusions on avalglucosidase´s efficacy and safety in this 
setting  at  the  proposed  starting  dose  of  40  mg/kg.  In  particular,  only  one  patient,  who  received  20  mg/kg 
avalglucosidase alfa, developed a transient ADA response, whereas in the cohort, who received 40 mg/kg, 5 
out of 10 patients (50%) developed a treatment emergent ADA response.  
Long term data are limited. Ongoing clinical studies and the extension of the applicant existing Pompe disease 
and Pompe disease  Pregnancy sub registries to further characterise the efficacy (especially in the paediatric 
population) and safety of avalglucosidase alfa are thus part of the additional pharmacovigilance activities. In 
addition, a further study is planned in IOPD patients  ≤6 months naïve to previous treatment with alglucosidase 
alfa (approximately 16 males and females) and is expected as post-authorisation commitment.  
6.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The  proposed  indication  includes  paediatric  IOPD  and  LOPD  patients,  in  first  and  second  line  of  treatment. 
Results  from  the  pivotal  study  in  adult  LOPD  naïve  patients  showed  that  avalglucosidase  is  non-inferior  to 
alglucosidase alfa at a 20 mg/kg dose with an acceptable safety profile. Extrapolation from adult to paediatric 
LOPD and IOPD patients is considered acceptable, since the pathophysiology of the disease, the mechanism 
of  action,  and  the  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  enzyme  replacement  therapy  (ERT)  for  Pompe  Disease  are 
comparable across the whole disease spectrum. 
In  IOPD  patients,  the  results  of  study  ACT14132  show  positive  trends  in  secondary  and  tertiary  efficacy 
outcomes  with  avalglucosidase.  However,  subgroups  of  patients  receiving  different  concentrations  of 
avalglucosidase alfa in study ACT14132 were very small and clinical response varies greatly between patients. 
Moreover, beneficial effects are not consistently in favour of patients initially treated with avalglucosidase alfa 
40 mg/kg and a clear dose response relationship could not be demonstrated. Thus, a higher starting dose was 
not recommended by the CHMP. However, for IOPD patients who experience lack of improvement or insufficient 
response in cardiac, respiratory, and/or motor function while receiving 20 mg/kg, a dose increase to 40 mg/kg 
every other week can be considered in the absence of safety concerns.  
Overall, based on the submitted data, a positive benefit risk can be concluded for the  LOPD and IOPD 
populations with recommended dose of 20 mg/kg for LOPD and a starting dose of 20 mg/kg with possible 
increase to 40 mg/kg in IOPD.

7.  Recommendations following re-examination 
Outcome 
Based on the arguments of the applicant and all the supporting data on quality, safety and efficacy, the 
CHMP re-examined its initial opinion and in its final opinion concluded by consensus that the benefit-risk 
balance of Nexviadyme is favourable in the following indication(s): 
Nexviadyme (avalglucosidase alfa) is indicated for long-term enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment 
of patients with Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase deficiency). 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription (see Annex I: Summary of Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
•  Periodic Safety Update Reports 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and 
any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
The marketing authorisation holder shall submit the first periodic safety update report for this product within 
6 months following authorisation. 
Conditions or restrictions with regard to the safe and effective use of the medicinal product 
•  Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed RMP 
presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result of an 
important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Additional risk minimisation measures 
Prior to the launch of Nexviadyme in each Member State the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) must 
agree about the content and format of the educational program, including communication media, distribution 
modalities, and any other aspects of the program, with the National Competent Authority. The educational

program is aimed at increasing the awareness about the immunosurveillance service and to support the 
correct and safe administration of the product in the home setting. 
The MAH shall ensure that in each member state where Nexviadyme is marketed, all healthcare professionals 
(HCPs) who are expected to prescribe, dispense and administer Nexviadyme are provided with the following 
educational package to be disseminated through professional bodies:   
•  Healthcare professionals (HCPs) guide for immunosurveillance service and 
•  Home infusion guide for HCPs 
Guide for healthcare professionals for Immunosurveillance Service shall include the following key elements: 
o  Testing recommendations: 
  Baseline serum sample collection prior to the first infusion is strongly 
encouraged. 
 
 
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers should be regularly monitored and 
IgG anti-drug antibody (ADA) testing should be considered if patients do not 
respond to therapy. 
Treated patients may be tested for inhibitory antibodies if they experience a 
decrease in clinical benefit despite continued treatment with Nexviadyme. 
  Adverse-event-driven immunologic testing, including IgG and 
Immunoglobulin E (IgE) ADA, should be considered for patients at risk for 
allergic reaction or previous anaphylactic reaction to Myozyme (alglucosidase 
alfa). 
  Adverse-event-driven immunologic testing should also be considered in 
patients who experience moderate/severe or recurrent infusion associated 
reactions (IARs) suggestive of hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic 
reactions. 
o  Testing practicalities of the testing service and contact details 
  Description of the testing services: available tests, indication for testing, 
sample type, Frequency of testing, collection time 
 
Procedure for testing: diagram summarizing main steps for HCP requesting 
Specialty testing services 
The Home Infusion guide for HCPs which will serve as training document to HCPs who will perform the 
infusion at home shall contain the following key elements: 
o  Requirements and organization of the home infusion including equipment, 
pre-treatment and emergency treatments.  
o  Details on the preparation and administration of Nexviadyme, including all the steps 
of preparation, reconstitution, dilution and administration  
o  Medical evaluation of the patient prior to administration of the infusion at home  
o 
Information on signs and symptoms related to infusion associated reactions and 
recommended actions for the management of the ADRs when symptoms occur.

New Active Substance Status 
Based on the CHMP review of the available data, the CHMP considers that avalglucosidase alfa is not to be 
qualified as a new active substance in itself. 
Based on the review of the available data, the CHMP considers that avalglucosidase alfa in comparison to 
alglucosidase alfa  previously authorised as a medicinal product in the European Union is not to be qualified 
as a new active substance as insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate that it differs 
significantly in properties with regard to safety and/or efficacy from the previously authorised substance.

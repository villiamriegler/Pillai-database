2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
The proposed new indication for Keytruda in this procedure is: 
“KEYTRUDA, in combination with fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated 
for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or 
gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults.”

Epidemiology and risk factors, screening tools/prevention 
Gastric cancer remains a major health problem worldwide. Gastric cancer is the fifth most common 
cancer in the world and the fourth leading cause of cancer death globally 1, with more than 1 million 
new cases estimated in 2020, resulting in 768,793 deaths 2. In the EU, the incidences of new cases 
and mortality for gastric cancer were estimated at 136,038 and 96,997, respectively in 2020 1. The 
highest gastric cancer incidence rates occur in Northeast Asia, South and Central America, and Eastern 
Europe, with rates being particularly high in Japan and Korea, where gastric cancer is the most 
commonly diagnosed cancer in men. 
Biologic features 
The majority of gastric cancers are HER2-negative, with the estimated prevalence of HER2- positive 
gastric cancer ranging from 6% to 34% 3,4. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Approximately 37% of new gastric cancer cases are diagnosed at the distant/metastatic stage, 
contributing to a poor 5-year relative survival rate of 6% 5. 
Management 
Systemic chemotherapy, with or without immunotherapy, is the mainstay of treatment for advanced 
and metastatic gastric cancer according to both NCCN and ESMO guidelines. Despite a large number of 
randomised studies, there is no globally accepted standard 1L chemotherapy regimen in HER2 
negative, advanced, unresectable and/or metastatic gastric and GEJ adenocarcinoma. 
Fluoropyrimidine/platinum doublet regimens containing cisplatin or oxaliplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) 
or capecitabine are the most frequently used worldwide as 1L chemotherapy regimens for patients with 
metastatic gastric/GEJ disease.  
The treatment landscape is evolving rapidly with the introduction of immunotherapy combined with 
standard-of-care chemotherapy regimens in 1L advanced gastric cancer. For example, the combination 
of nivolumab and fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-containing chemotherapy was recently approved for 
the treatment of HER2-negative advanced or metastatic gastric, GEJ, and esophageal adenocarcinoma 
in several regions, including the EU and US [see Table 1]. In the EU, this indication was restricted to 
patients whose tumours express PD-L1 with a combined positive score (CPS) ≥ 5. 
Considering the poor 5-year relative survival rate of 5.5% in metastatic gastric cancer, there continues 
to be a high unmet medical need for providing new effective and safe therapies for this patient 
population.

2.1.2.  About the product 
Pembrolizumab is a highly selective humanized monoclonal antibody that binds to human programmed 
cell death 1 (PD 1) and blocks the interaction between the PD-1 pathway receptor and its ligands, 
programmed cell death 1 ligand 1 (PD-L1) and 2 (PD-L2) on antigen presenting tumour cells. 
In the EU, pembrolizumab is currently approved (as monotherapy and in combination with other 
agents) for the treatment of melanoma, non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), classical Hodgkin 
lymphoma (cHL), urothelial cancer, head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC), renal cell 
carcinoma (RCC), Microsatellite instability high (MSI-H) or mismatch repair deficient (dMMR) cancers, 
oesophageal carcinoma, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), endometrial carcinoma (EC) and cervical 
cancer.  
The recommended dose of KEYTRUDA in adults is either 200 mg every 3 weeks or 400 mg every 
6 weeks administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes. 
The applied indication is: 
“KEYTRUDA, in combination with fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated 
for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or 
gastrooesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults”, based on study KEYNOTE-859. 
The approved indications is: 
“KEYTRUDA, in combination with fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated 
for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or 
gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 
(see section 5.1). ”

2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
Regarding the proposed indication, the MAH did not seek Scientific advice at the CHMP. A pre-
submission teleconference with EMA and the (Co-)Rapporteurs was held on 02 February 2023. 
An overview of the clinical development program for gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma is provided in 
Table 2, in section 2.3.1. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The assessment of the clinical study data did not raise any specific concerns questioning GCP 
compliance. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00) proteins are exempted from the submission of ERA studies because they 
are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Pembrolizumab is a protein, therefore an 
ERA has not been submitted by the MAH. This is acceptable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Substantial characterization of the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pembrolizumab had been provided in 
previous applications as monotherapy and in combination with small molecules or chemotherapy. 
Therefore, PK and antidrug antibodies (ADA) collection were not planned for study KEYNOTE-859.  
The focus of the clinical pharmacology data to support the current submission is on the clinical PK data 
from participants with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in KEYNOTE-062 (a Phase III clinical 
trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab as monotherapy and in 
combination with cisplatin + 5-FU or cisplatin + capecitabine as 1L treatment in subjects with 
advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma). 
Pembrolizumab PK data in KEYNOTE-062 was obtained from 502 participants with advanced gastric or 
GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with pembrolizumab as monotherapy (n=252) or in combination with 
cisplatin + 5-FU or cisplatin + capecitabine (n=250).  
The key clinical pharmacology characteristics are summarized in the current KEYTRUDA EU SmPC.  
Absorption 
Pembrolizumab is dosed via the intravenous route and therefore is immediately and completely 
bioavailable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/506795/2023  
Page 12/133 
 
 
 
 
Distribution 
Consistent with a limited extravascular distribution, the volume of distribution of pembrolizumab at 
steady state is small (6.0 L; coefficient of variation [CV]: 20%). As expected for an antibody, 
pembrolizumab does not bind to plasma proteins in a specific manner. 
Elimination 
Pembrolizumab CL is approximately 23% lower (geometric mean, 195 mL/day [CV%: 40%]) after 
achieving maximal change at steady state compared with the first dose (252 mL/day [CV%: 37%]); 
this decrease in CL with time is not considered clinically meaningful. The geometric mean value (CV%) 
for the terminal half-life is 22 days (32%) at steady-state. 
Pharmacokinetic in target population 
Based on the existing characterization of pembrolizumab PK, a comparison of observed PK for 
advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma with the predictions from the historical reference PK model 
developed with pembrolizumab monotherapy data was provided. 
The observed and predicted pembrolizumab concentration-time profiles following 200 mg Q3W 
administration at Cycle 1 and at Steady State (at or after Cycle 8) are illustrated in Figure 1 with the 
observed concentrations from KEYNOTE-062 overlaid on the model predicted median concentrations 
and 90% prediction interval (PI). 
The PK in subjects with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma follows a similar profile as predicted 
based on the PK reference model over the dosing interval, in both Cycle 1 and Steady State. The 
majority of the observed PK data are contained within the 90% PI based on the PK reference model. 
In addition, observed pembrolizumab serum concentration values in KEYNOTE-062 are found to be 
consistent with other globally approved studies in different cancer indications (KEYNOTE-024 in NSCLC, 
KEYNOTE-045 and KEYNOTE-052 in UC, KEYNOTE-048 and KEYNOTE-055 in HNSCC, KEYNOTE-087 in 
cHL, KEYNOTE-158 in MSI-H nonCRC, KEYNOTE-164 and KEYNOTE-177 in MSI-H-CRC) following 
administration of 200 mg Q3W as shown in Table 3 and Figure 2.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
KEYTRUDA is an antibody that binds to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its 
interaction with ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity 
that has been shown to be involved in the control of T-cell immune responses. KEYTRUDA potentiates 
T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-L1 and PD-
L2, which are expressed in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in 
the tumour microenvironment. 
Dose regimen 
The 200 mg Q3W dosing regimen is approved for use in multiple indications globally as monotherapy 
as well as in combination with small molecule or chemotherapy based on a large, integrated body of 
evidence at this dose level across indications. An additional dosing regimen of 400 mg Q6W has been 
approved in the US and EU for all adult indications in the monotherapy and combination therapy 
settings. These approvals were mainly supported by a modelling and simulation-based approach, 
bridging PK and exposure/dose-response (E-R) data, and by clinical efficacy, safety, and PK data from 
KEYNOTE-555, Cohort B study.

No new ADA data are provided in this submission based on the characterization of immunogenicity 
potential with trials in monotherapy setting. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Clinical pharmacology results in support of the current extension of indication of pembrolizumab in 
combination with chemotherapy for the treatment of advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma are 
provided from Study KEYNOTE-062.  PK data in KEYNOTE-062 was obtained from 502 participants with 
advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma treated with pembrolizumab as monotherapy (n=252) or in 
combination with cisplatin + 5-FU or cisplatin + capecitabine (n=250).  
The MAH provided a comparison between the observed PK data in KEYNOTE-062 and the predictions 
from the historical reference PK model that had been developed with pembrolizumab monotherapy 
data. 
The observed and predicted pembrolizumab concentration-time profiles following 200 mg Q3W 
administration at Cycle 1 and at Steady State (at or after Cycle 8) overlaid on the model predicted 
median concentrations and 90% prediction interval (PI). The PK in subjects with advanced gastric or 
GEJ adenocarcinoma followed a similar profile as predicted based on the PK reference model over the 
dosing interval, in both Cycle 1 and Steady State. The majority of the observed PK data were 
contained within the 90% PI based on the PK reference model. 
In addition, observed pembrolizumab serum concentration values in KEYNOTE- 062 were found to be 
consistent with other globally approved studies in different cancer indications following administration 
of 200 mg Q3W. 
In view of the robust characterization of immunogenicity it is considered acceptable that no new 
immunogenicity data have been provided to support the current application.  
Overall, the PK data from KEYNOTE-062 are supportive of the proposed pembrolizumab dose of 200 
mg Q3W for the 1L treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or 
GEJ adenocarcinoma in adults. Given the integrated body of evidence, the 400 mg Q6W dosing 
regimen is expected to have a similar benefit-risk profile as 200 mg Q3W and can be accepted as an 
additional dosing regimen also for the 1L treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic 
HER2-negative gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-
containing chemotherapy. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the PK in participants with advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma as shown with KEYNOTE-
062 data is generally consistent with monotherapy PK, as previously established.  
Given the totality of data available from KEYNOTE-062 and the similarity between KEYNOTE-062 and 
KEYNOTE-859 study populations and treatments, pembrolizumab PK characterization in KEYNOTE-062 
is considered suitable to be extended to KEYNOTE-859 population.

Title of Study - KEYNOTE-859 
A Phase 3, randomised, double-blind clinical study of pembrolizumab (MK-3475) plus chemotherapy 
versus placebo plus chemotherapy as first-line treatment in participants with HER2 negative, 
previously untreated, unresectable or metastatic gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma 
Methods 
Figure 3 KEYNOTE-859 Study Design 
HER2=human epidermal growth factor receptor 2; GEJ=gastroesophageal junction; CAPOX=capecitabine and 
oxaliplatin; FP=cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil; PD-L1=programmed cell death-1 ligand-1; CPS=combined positive 
score; OS=overall survival; PFS=progression free survival; ORR=objective response rate; DoR=duration of 
response; BICR=blinded independent central review 
The 2 chemotherapy regimen choices, FP or CAPOX, had to be chosen before randomisation in the 
study. Participants were stratified by PD-L1 tumour expression status (CPS <1, ≥1), combination 
chemotherapy (FP or CAPOX), and geographic region (Europe/Israel/North America/Australia vs Asia 
vs Rest of the World [including South America]). The study was double-blind with respect to 
randomised study intervention (pembrolizumab/placebo). Participants continued on the type of 
chemotherapy regimen chosen before randomisation throughout the study. 
Imaging was performed every 6 weeks (± 7 days) after randomisation to assess response to treatment 
using RECIST 1.1.

Biomarker evaluation 
According to the protocol all participants were required to supply a tumour tissue specimen. Newly 
obtained endoscopic biopsy or core biopsy of a metastatic site, if obtained as part of normal clinical 
practice, was preferred to archived samples. Both formalin solution and formalin-fixed, paraffin 
embedded (FFPE) block specimens were acceptable. If submitting unstained slides, newly cut slides 
should have been received by the testing laboratory within 14 days from the date slides are cut, 
otherwise a new specimen was requested. 
HER2 testing 
HER2 negative was defined as: IHC (0, or 1+) or fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) negative 
(HER2:CEP17 ratio <2 with an average HER2 copy number <4.0 signals/cell). FISH could be replaced 
with locally available in situ hybridization (ISH) methods acceptable as per institutional guidelines 
(e.g., DISH). 
HER2 testing was conducted either by local or central testing laboratory. HER2 assay for local testing 
was clinical instructionʼs choice. The assays used for HER2 central laboratory testing were the FDA-
approved and EU-CE Marked Dako (Agilent) HercepTest (IHC) and Dako (Agilent) HER2 IQFISH 
pharmDx Kit (Reflex FISH testing for HER2 IHC 2+ samples). 
PD-L1 testing 
Per inclusion criteria all participants needed to provide tumour tissue sample deemed adequate for PD-
L1 biomarker analysis and tumour PD-L1 expression status had to be available prior to randomisation. 
The assay used for tumour PD-L1 testing was the Agilent PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx kit and testing was 
conducted at a central laboratory. This kit has been analytically validated to determine PD-L1 
expression status in gastric tumours. 
MSI biomarker analysis 
Both tumour tissue samples and blood will be collected for MSI analyses and are required to perform 
central MSI testing by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In order to perform MSI analysis by PCR, 
blood and tumour tissue was required. A blood sample was collected to extract normal DNA for 
comparison testing to tumour DNA in MSI analysis.

Treatments 
Table 4 Study Intervention 
Pembrolizumab or placebo had to be administered as a 30-minute IV infusion Q3W (-5 min/+10 min).  
Study intervention administration continued until confirmed progressive disease (PD) by BICR, 
unacceptable AE(s), intercurrent illness that prevented further administration of treatment, 
investigator’s decision to discontinue the participant, administrative reasons requiring cessation of 
treatment, or until the participant had received 35 administrations (approximately 2 years) of 
treatment. The investigator could elect to implement modified RECIST 1.1 for immune-based 
therapeutics (iRECIST).

and other biomarkers) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint: 
OS, defined as the time from randomisation to death due to any cause. 
Secondary endpoints: 
PFS, defined as the time from randomisation to the first documented disease progression as measured 
by BICR per RECIST 1.1 or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
ORR, defined as the proportion of participants in the analysis population who had a response (CR or 
PR) as measured by BICR per RECIST 1.1. 
DOR, defined as the time from the first documented evidence of CR or PR until disease progression or 
death due to any cause, whichever occurred first. 
Sample size 
The overall sample size of the study (i.e., all participants) was planned to be approximately 1579. The 
sample size for the CPS ≥10 participants was projected to be ~551 based on a prevalence rate of ~ 
35% of the CPS ≥10 participants among all participants. The sample size of the CPS ≥1 participants 
was projected to be ~ 1235 based on a prevalence rate of ~ 78% of the CPS ≥1 participants among all 
participants.  
Assessment report  
EMA/506795/2023  
Page 23/133 
 
 
 
Sample size calculation 
To account for the potential delayed treatment effect, a piecewise hazard ratio (HR) was assumed for 
both PFS and OS in subpopulations of CPS ≥10, 1≤ CPS ≤9, and CPS <1 with HR=1 in the delayed 
period and HR <1 afterwards. The CPS ≥1 population comprised of the subpopulations of CPS ≥10 and 
1≤ CPS ≤9 combined; the all participants population comprised of the subpopulations of CPS ≥10, 1≤ 
CPS ≤9, and CPS <1 combined. Based on HRs assumed for OS and PFS, an average hazard ratio (AHR) 
at the planed final analysis time (~43 months for PFS and ~54 months for OS) was estimated for each 
study population: CPS ≥10, CPS ≥1, and all participants. The AHR is the geometric mean of the 
underlying piecewise hazard ratio in each interval weighted by the expected number of events 
observed in the interval.  
Overall Survival 
Given the above assumptions, the study has ~ 87% power for detecting an AHR=0.73 in CPS ≥10 
participants with 463 OS events at the final analysis (expected ~54 months) with an initially assigned 
0.017 (1-sided) significance level. 
It was assumed that there will be ~ 1057 OS events in CPS ≥1 participants at the OS final analysis. 
With 1057 OS events, the study has ~ 90% power for detecting an AHR=0.81 in CPS ≥1 participants at 
the final analysis (expected ~54 months) with an (1-sided) significance level of 0.017 (alpha=0.017 
can be passed from H1 to H2 if H1 is rejected). 
It was estimated that there will be ~ 1358 OS events in all participants at the OS final analysis. With 
1358 OS events, the study has ~ 84% power for detecting an AHR=0.83 in all participants at the final 
analysis (expected ~54 months) with an initially assigned 0.008 (1-sided) significance level. 
Progression Free Survival 
It was estimated that there will be ~ 478 events in CPS ≥10 participants at the PFS analysis (i.e., the 
interim analysis of the study). With 478 PFS events, the study has ~ 99% power for detecting an 
AHR=0.68 in CPS ≥10 participants at 0.025 (1-sided) significance level (after H1, H2, and H3 are all 
rejected). 
It was assumed that there will be ~ 1095 events in CPS ≥1 participants at the PFS analysis. With 1095 
PFS events, the study has ~ 99% power for detecting an AHR=0.78 in CPS ≥1 participants at a 
significance level of 0.025 (1-sided) if H1 to H4 were previously rejected. 
It was assumed that there will be ~ 1407 events in all participants at the PFS analysis. With 1407 PFS 
events, the study has ~ 98% power for detecting an AHR=0.80 in all participants at a significance level 
of 0.025 (1-sided) if H1 to H5 were previously rejected. 
Overall Response Rate 
With the planned sample size of ~ 551 randomised for CPS ≥10 participants, the study has ~99% 
power to detect a difference of 20% in ORR (37% ORR in the control arm and 57% ORR in the 
experimental arm in CPS ≥10 participants) under alpha=0.025 after H1 to H6 were previously rejected. 
The ORR difference required for significance of H7 is ~ 8.3% under alpha=0.025. 
With the planned sample size of ~ 1235 randomised for CPS ≥1 participants, the study has ~ 99% 
power to detect a difference of 16% in ORR (37% ORR in the control arm and 53% ORR in the 
experimental arm in CPS ≥1 participants) under alpha=0.025 after H1 to H7 were previously rejected. 
The ORR difference required for significance of H8 is ~ 5.5% under alpha=0.025.  
With the planned sample size of ~1579 randomised for all participants, the study has ~99% power to 
detect a difference of 13% in ORR (37% ORR in the control arm and 50% in the experimental arm in

all participants) under alpha=0.025 after H1 to H8 were previously rejected. The ORR difference 
required for significance of H9 is ~ 4.9% under alpha=0.025. Randomisation 
Treatment allocation/randomisation occurred centrally using an interactive response technology (IRT) 
system. Participants were assigned randomly in a 1:1 ratio to pembrolizumab or placebo, respectively. 
Participants were stratified by geographic region (Europe/Israel/North America/Australia, Asia or Rest 
of the World (including South America)), PD-L1 tumour expression status (CPS <1 or ≥1), and 
combination chemotherapy (FP or CAPOX), which was chosen prior to randomisation in the study. 
There were 12 combinations of categories of all stratification factors (3 × 2 × 2=12 strata). Within 
each stratum, the block size of 4 was used.  
Blinding (masking) 
The trial was double-blinded. Pembrolizumab and placebo were prepared and/or dispensed in a blinded 
fashion by an unblinded pharmacist or qualified study site personnel. PD-L1 expression was masked to 
the site. 
An external DMC served as the primary reviewer of the results of the interim analysis (or potential 
safety analyses) of the study and made recommendations for discontinuation of the study or protocol 
modifications to the Sponsor. If the DMC recommended modifications to the design of the protocol or 
discontinuation of the study, this executive committee (and potentially other limited Sponsor 
personnel) may be unblinded to results at the treatment-level in order to act on these 
recommendations. The extent to which individuals were unblinded with respect to results of interim 
analyses was to be documented. Additional logistical details were to be provided in the DMC Charter. 
Treatment-level results from the interim analysis were provided to the DMC by the external unblinded 
statistician. Prior to final study unblinding, the external unblinded statistician was not to be involved in 
any discussions regarding modifications to the protocol, statistical methods. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis population 
The Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population was defined as all randomised participants, whether or not 
treatment was administered. The ITT was the primary analysis population for efficacy endpoints. 
The safety analysis population ‘all participants as treated’ (APaT) was defined as all randomised 
participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention. The APaT was used for safety analyses.

Assessment report  
EMA/506795/2023  
Page 26/133 
 
 
 
 
For PFS, the date of disease progression was approximated by the date of the first assessment of PD 
per RECIST 1.1 by BICR. Death was considered as a PD event. The following censoring rules were 
applied for the primary and sensitivity analyses: 
Table 6 Censoring Rules for Primary and Sensitivity Analyses of PFS 
Stratified analyses were based on collapsed strata by combining strata with small number of 
participants or events. The collapsed strata will be based on blinded data taking into considerations of 
both clinical relevance and actual counts of subjects/events. 
Interim Analysis 
One interim analysis was planned for the study. It was planned to be performed after approximately 
403 OS events have occurred in CPS ≥ 10 participants and approximately 12 months after the last 
participant was randomised. An interim analysis for OS and final analysis for PFS and ORR was planned 
for the interim analysis.

The following tables show the Lan-DeMets O’Brien-Fleming spending function based on the predicted 
number of events at the planned time of analysis:

Table 9 Efficacy Boundaries and Properties for OS Analysis in All Participants 
The actual spending function was based the actual information fraction of the observed number of OS 
events at the interim analyses relative to the expected number of OS events at the final analysis.  
Multiplicity 
The study used an extension of the graphical method of Maurer and Bretz [Maurer, W. and Bretz, F. 
2013] to provide strong multiplicity control for multiple hypotheses while making the interim and final 
analysis timing be more flexible [Anderson, K. M. 2018]. According to the Maurer and Bretz approach, 
study hypotheses may be tested in a group sequential fashion, and when a particular null hypothesis is 
rejected, the alpha allocated to that hypothesis can be reallocated to other hypothesis tests. 
The overall type I error at 2.5% (1-sided) was assigned to the primary and secondary endpoints as 
follows: 1.7% was assigned to OS in CPS >= 10 (H1) and 0.8% to OS in all participants (H3). OS in 
CPS >= 1 (H2) could be tested with alpha that was recycled once H1 and/or H3 was tested significant. 
If H1, H2 and H3 were tested significant, then PFS could be tested, followed by ORR.

About a third of all screened participants were screen failures. The most prevalent reason for screen 
failure was related to the inclusion criteria of having an adequate organ function, as defined per 
protocol and collection of specimens within 10 days prior to the start of study intervention. 
At the time of DCO (03 Oct 2022), 181 (22.9%) participants were ongoing in the study in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group vs 112 (14.2%) in the chemotherapy group. 40 (5.1%) 
participants remained on treatment in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group vs 21 (2.7%) 
participants in the control group.

Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
Original protocol Version 00 (12 Jul 2018) 
•  Approximately 780 participants will be randomised. 
• 
The primary efficacy endpoints in this study are OS and PFS. 
•  One interim analysis is planned in this study after ~539 OS events in all participants and ~11 
months after last participant randomised. Primary purpose: efficacy analysis for ORR, PFS, and 
OS in all participants and in participants with CPS ≥1. 
• 
Final analysis to be performed after ~649 OS events have occurred in all participants, ~386 OS 
events have occurred in CPS ≥1 participants, and ~22 months after last participant randomised. 
Primary purpose: efficacy analysis for OS in all participants and participants with CPS ≥1. 
•  Multiplicity:  The  overall  type  I  error  over  the  primary  and  secondary  hypotheses  is  strongly 
controlled at 2.5% (1-sided), with initially 0.9% to OS in all participants (H1), 1.4% to OS in 
CPS1 (H2), 0.1% to PFS in all participants (H3), and 0.1% to PFS in CPS1 (H4). By using the 
graphical approach of Mauer and Bretz, if one hypothesis is rejected, the alpha will be shifted to 
other hypotheses. 
Protocol Amendment Version 01 (20 Nov 2018) 
Clarified inclusion/exclusion criteria and updated country-specific requirements 
Protocol Amendment Version 02 (12 Dec 2019) 
•  Changed the hypotheses of the study:  
o  added PFS/OS/ORR hypotheses in PD-L1 CPS ≥10 population (CPS ≥10 becomes the 
primary analysis Population)  
o  added a primary OS objective for MSI-high, conditional upon meeting enrolment target.  
Rationale: Refocus study on patient population thought to have an increased likelihood of response. 
Study redesign informed by recent study results with pembrolizumab. Clinically meaningful 
improvement in ORR, DOR, and PFS was observed in CPS ≥10 participants. 
•  Changed target enrolment from 780 to 1542 participants. 
Rationale: Study is powered for PD-L1 CPS ≥10 population and enrolment duration is now driven by 
PD-L1 CPS ≥10 population, as a result, the target enrolment in PD-L1 all-comer population is 
increased. 
•  Duration of study changed from 5.5 years to 6 years. 
Rationale: Updated duration of study based upon increased target enrolment of 1542 participants. 
Assessment report  
EMA/506795/2023  
Page 33/133 
 
 
 
•  Changed the Interim Analysis, Multiplicity, and Power and Sample Size with new design details. 
1. Updated interim/final analysis timing. 
2. Updated alpha passing strategy. 
3. Updated efficacy boundaries and properties. 
Rationale: 
1.  The primary analysis population is changed to PD-L1 CPS ≥10 (then step down to CPS ≥1, then 
further to all participants) and thus reaching targeted number of events in PD-L1 CPS ≥10 
population together with the minimum follow-up requirement will drive timing of the analysis in the 
new design. 
2.  The alpha passing strategy was updated to account for new hypotheses added in CPS ≥10 
population and MSI-H population and allow for alpha to be stepped down to CPS ≥1 and further to 
all participants should preceding hypothesis is positive. 
3.  The efficacy boundary and properties were updated to reflect the change in hypotheses and in the 
alpha splitting/passing strategy.  
4.  Underlying assumption for treatment effect size was updated due potential delayed treatment 
effect in both PFS and OS; as a result, power and sample size calculations were updated. 
•  Added additional subgroup analyses variables (ECOG, Disease status, Primary location, and 
Histologic subtype). 
Protocol Amendment Version 03 (11 Jan 2021) 
•  Moved PFS objectives and hypotheses (H4, H5, and H6) from the primary hypothesis to the 
secondary objectives. 
•  Eliminated MSI-H OS hypothesis (H2) 
Rationale: 
In response to the published CM649 study which demonstrated statistically significant OS benefit in all 
examined PD-L1 CPS subgroups, the KN859 protocol was redesigned to focus initial alpha allocation on 
the OS endpoint and test PFS in a conditional step-down manner. Since initial alpha spending on PFS in 
PD-L1 CPS ≥10 was removed, the PFS hypotheses were changed from primary to secondary 
hypotheses.  
The MSI-H OS hypothesis was removed and the alpha reallocated to other OS hypotheses in order to 
maximize statistical power for these needed hypotheses. A sensitivity analysis assessing the impact of 
MSI-H was planned and was prespecified in the sSAP. Because formal statistical testing of the PFS 
endpoint was conditional on demonstration of OS significance, there was the possibility that PFS may 
not be formally tested. For all these reasons, PFS was amended from a primary to a secondary 
endpoint. 
• 
The total study enrolment was specified to be 1542 PD-L1 CPS “all-comer” participants. 
Previously, the total study enrolment was driven by the requirement for a minimum of 416 PD-
L1 CPS participants; accordingly, the study was projected to enrol 1542 subjects based upon 
an estimated 27% prevalence of CPS ≥10 
Rationale:  
The prevalence of PD-L1 CPS ≥10 to date noted in the study was higher than expected (35% vs. 27%). 
Per protocol, this would result in fewer than 1542 PD-L1 CPS “all-comer” participants being enrolled in 
the study. Specifying a total study enrolment of 1542 PD-L1 CPS “all-comer” participants could

increase enrolment of PDL1 CPS ≥10 participants (the primary analysis population), thus maximizing 
statistical power for hypothesis testing in this primary analysis population without changing the 
targeted enrolment in the “all-comer” population.” 
•  Changed the Interim Analysis, Multiplicity, and Statistical Power with new design outlined 
below. 
1.  Changed PFS to the secondary endpoint from the primary endpoint. 
2.  The trigger of IA was updated. 
3.  Updated alpha passing strategy. 
4.  Updated efficacy boundaries and properties. 
5.  Updated the assumed magnitude of OS benefit and OS median in the control group after 
incorporating the recently available study result information. 
Rationale: 
Study redesign was as a result of available study results of CM649 and ATTRACTION-4. 
1.  Primary hypotheses included only OS (OS in PDL1 CPS ≥10, ≥1 and “all-comers”) and not PFS 
(PFS hypotheses to be tested in a conditional step-down manner only if OS in PD-L1 CPS “all-
comers” shows statistical significance). For this reason, PFS was changed to a secondary 
endpoint. 
2.  The targeted number of OS events (instead of PFS events) in PD-L1 CPS ≥10 population 
together with the minimum follow-up requirement would drive timing of the first interim 
analysis. 
3.  The alpha passing strategy was updated by allocating the initial alpha to OS hypotheses in CPS 
≥10 population and all-comer population. Only if all 3 null hypotheses of OS endpoint were 
rejected, PFS and ORR hypotheses were to be tested subsequently. 
4.  The efficacy boundary and properties were updated to reflect the changes in hypotheses and in 
the alpha splitting/passing strategy. 
5.  Data from ATTRACTION-4 (conducted in Japan, Korea and Taiwan) suggested longer-than-
expected OS median for the SOC control arm and a smaller-than-expected OS treatment effect 
for the combination of nivolumab + SOC chemotherapy vs. SOC chemotherapy alone. It was 
expected that ~17% of participants were enrolled from Japan, Korea and Taiwan in this study. 
The prevalence of CPS ≥10 was also updated from 27% to 35% as observed in already enrolled 
participants in the study. As a result, power calculations were updated given the targeted 
sample size and new assumptions mentioned above.

The dose modification and toxicity management guidelines for immune related adverse events were 
updated. 
Protocol Amendment Version 05 (30 Nov 2021) 
The enrolment period was divided into 2 periods: the Global portion of the study and the China 
mainland extension. After enrolment of the Global portion of the study was completed, the study 
remained open to enrolment in China mainland until the target number of participants were enrolled to 
meet local regulatory requirements. With Protocol Amendment 05 the Global portion of the study and 
China mainland extension portion were combined into one Global Study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/506795/2023

Rationale: 
Due to 1) short interval of date of Last Participant Randomised between Global portion of the study 
and China mainland extension portion (44 days); and 2) the small number of randomised participants 
in China mainland extension portion relative to the Global portion of the study (35 of 1579 
participants).

Efficacy Analysis Population 
OS, PFS, ORR, and DOR were analysed in the ITT population (referenced as all participants; n=1579) 
and in participants with tumour PD-L1 expression of CPS ≥1 (n=1235) and CPS ≥10 (n=551). 
Safety Analysis Population 
Safety analyses were based on the APaT population, which included all 1572 randomised participants 
who received at least 1 dose of study intervention according to the study intervention they received 
PRO was analysed in the FAS population.

Patient-reported Outcome Analysis Population 
PRO analyses for the EORTC-QLQ-C30, EORTC-QLQ-STO22, and EQ-5D-5L questionnaires were based 
on the PRO FAS population, which included all 1543 (EORTC-QLQ-C30 and EQ-5D-5L) and 1528 
(EORTC-QLQ-STO22) randomised participants who had at least 1 PRO assessment available for the 
specific endpoint and have received at least 1 dose of study intervention. 
Outcomes and estimation  
Efficacy results are presented from the IA of Study KEYNOTE-859 as of the DCO date of 03-OCT-2022 
with approximately 15 months of follow-up after the last participant was randomised (interim OS 
analysis and final analyses for PFS and ORR). At this IA, the study met the predefined superiority 
criteria for all efficacy hypotheses: pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy provided 
statistically significant improvements in OS, PFS by BICR, and ORR by BICR in CPS ≥ 10, CPS ≥ 1 and 
ITT when compared with chemotherapy alone.

the World), PD-L1 status (CPS<1 vs. CPS>=1) and Chemotherapy regimen (FP or CAPOX) with small strata collapsed as pre-specified in the 
sSAP. 
 Western Europe includes France, Germany, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, Ireland, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Denmark and Hungary, which 
is consistent with the ‘'Europe’' region defined in the protocol for stratification. 
 b One-sided p-value for testing. H0: difference in % = 0 versus H1: difference in % > 0. 
 Responses are based on BICR assessment per RECIST 1.1. 
Database Cutoff Date: 03OCT2022 
In the ITT population (all participants), a small and comparable proportion of patients were “not 
evaluable” (post-baseline assessment(s) available however not being evaluable) or had no post-
baseline assessment available for response evaluation (0.9% and 6.2% “not evaluable” and “no 
assessment” in the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group vs 1.6% and 5.6% in the chemotherapy 
group).

The median time to response was 1.5 months in both intervention groups for all participants and in 
the CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥10 subgroups. 
Exploratory endpoints 
PRO 
Based on criteria for compliance and completion rates prespecified in the sSAP, Week 18 was selected 
as the time point for analysing changes from baseline for the EORTC QLQC30, QLQ-STO22, and EQ-
5D-5L. 
Compliance rates for all PROs, in the PRO FAS, CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥10 populations, were >90% at 
baseline and >80% after 18 weeks of follow-up in both treatment groups. 
Baseline scores were similar in both intervention groups (for all prespecified items and across the PRO 
FAS, CPS ≥1 and CPS ≥10 populations). 
EORTC QLQ-C30 (data not shown) 
Prespecified scales: GHS/QoL, physical functioning, role functioning, nausea/vomiting symptom scale, 
and appetite loss 
•  At Week 18, the observed LS mean changes from baseline in scores for all these scales were 
similar in both intervention groups. 
• 
There was a higher proportion of participants who improved (as defined in the sSAP) in the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group compared with the chemotherapy group for the 
GHS/QoL scale in the PRO FAS and CPS ≥10 populations, and for appetite loss, nausea and 
vomiting, and role functioning scale in the CPS ≥ 10 population (no difference for other scales 
and no difference for the proportion of participants who were considered improved and/or 
stable). 
• 
The time to deterioration was similar in both intervention groups for all prespecified scales 
across all populations.

For overall population, analysis is based on Cox regression model with treatment as a covariate stratified by Geographic region 
(Western Europe/Israel/North America/Australia, Asia and Rest of the World), PD-L1 status (CPS<1 vs. CPS>=1), and 
Chemotherapy regimen (FP or CAPOX) with small strata collapsed as pre-specified in the sSAP. 
Western Europe includes France, Germany, Spain, Italy, United Kingdom, Ireland, Switzerland, Czech Republic, Denmark and 
Hungary, which is consistent with the ‘'Europe’' region defined in the protocol for stratification. 
For subgroups, analysis is based on unstratified Cox regression model with treatment as a covariate.

If any level of a subgroup variable has fewer than approximately 5% of the ITT population, subgroup analysis is not performed in 
that level of the subgroup variable.

† From a Cox regression model with Efron’s method of tie handling using PD-L1 CPS on the square root 
scale as a continuous covariate. Each treatment group was analysed separately. Hazard ratio (HR) 
represents ratio of the hazard rates for the event as CPS increases by 1 on the square root scale. A HR of 1 
indicates that CPS does not affect the hazard rate. A HR of greater than 1 indicates that there is higher 
hazard as CPS increases. A HR of less than 1 indicates that there is lower hazard as CPS increases.

Exploratory analyses based on a CPS 5 cutpoint 
During the procedure the MAH provided post-hoc exploratory efficacy results based on the PD-L1 CPS 
cutpoints of CPS <5 and CPS ≥5, CPS ≥1 to <5, and CPS ≥5 to <10 (see Table 40 below). The CPS 5 
cutpoint was not analytically validated and no pathologist training was conducted for this cutpoint.

Subgroup analyses by age category (<65, ≥65 to <75, and ≥75 years) for OS, PFS and ORR are 
shown in the tables below. Because there were only 3 participants in the ≥85 age category, the ≥75 
to <85 and ≥85 age categories were combined for the analyses.

Efficacy for Non-MSI-H Tumours 
According to baseline characteristics 4.7% of study participants had MSI-high, 81.8% had non-MSI-
high tumours and MSI status was missing for 14.2%. Most of the participants with missing MSI status 
(134/236) were enrolled in China, where biomarker sample collection was dependent on approval by 
HGRAC (22-DEC-2020; enrolment in study from Nov 2018 until Jun 2021). Outside China only 6.7% of 
participants had missing MSI data. Baseline characteristics were generally similar between the 
treatment arms (and similar compared to the overall study population) (data not shown).

GEJ/gastric adenocarcinoma. The MAH presented these negative study results in the context of the 
current application (data not shown). 
Table 52 KEYNOTE-062 study design  
Table 53 Clinical studies of pembrolizumab in gastric cancer 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
With the current variation application, the MAH initially sought the following new indication: 
“KEYTRUDA, in combination with fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated 
for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or 
gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults.” 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The extension of indication is based on the double-blinded, global study KEYNOTE-859 that randomised 
participants with previously untreated, HER2-negative, advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma to 
receive pembrolizumab or placebo in combination with chemotherapy (FP [cisplatin/5-FU] or CAPOX 
[capecitabine and oxaliplatin]). 
Patients had not received previous therapy for advanced disease, but participants may have received 
prior neoadjuvant and/or adjuvant therapy as long as it was completed at least 6 months prior to 
randomisation. No pre-treatment with a checkpoint inhibitor was allowed. 
Participants were eligible regardless of PD-L1 or MSI status; however, all participants needed to 
provide tumour tissue samples for central PD-L1 testing with the Agilent PD-L1 IHC 22C3 pharmDx 
Assessment report

Page 88/133 
 
 
 
 
 
assay and for central MSI analysis by PCR. HER2 testing was conducted either by local or central 
testing laboratory.   
Participants were stratified by geographic region, PD-L1 tumour expression status (CPS <1 or ≥1), and 
combination chemotherapy (FP or CAPOX), which was chosen prior to randomisation in the study. 
The choice of FP or CAPOX as chemotherapy backbone regimens and the applied dosing regimens are 
in line with recommended standard of care treatment options and reflect different regional practice. Of 
note, the majority of patients (86%) received CAPOX as investigator´s choice.  
Baseline characteristics were generally balanced between treatment arms and are overall reflective of 
patients with advanced gastric /GEJ adenocarcinoma apart from the typical limitations of eligibility 
criteria that restrict the study population to patients with good performance status and adequate organ 
function. The majority of participants (61%) were <65 years of age (median age was 62.0 years) and 
only 7.4% were enrolled with an age above 75 years. Participants were primarily male (68%), the 
majority had an ECOG PS of 1 (63%) and were white (55%) or Asian (34%). Most participants had 
adenocarcinoma of the stomach (78.7%) and had not received prior gastrectomy/esophagectomy 
(78.2%). Nearly all had metastatic disease (96.3%) with about 40% with liver metastases.  
The majority of participants (78.2%) had PD-L1 tumour expression status of CPS ≥1 and 34.9% had 
CPS ≥10.  
After several relevant design modifications during the study conduct, overall survival was finally 
determined as sole primary efficacy endpoint with PFS, ORR and DOR (measured by BICR per RECIST 
1.1) as secondary endpoints. Primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were hierarchically tested in 
participants with PD-L1 CPS ≥10, PD-L1 CPS ≥1, and in all participants.  
By redesigning the study to include the PD-L1 CPS ≥10 population as the primary analysis population, 
the target enrolment was increased from 780 to 1542 participants and the timing of the interim/final 
analysis were updated amongst other changes with protocol amendment 02. With amendment 03, PFS 
was amended from a primary to a secondary endpoint and the interim analysis, multiplicity and 
statistical power were revised again. Protocol amendment 03 occurred about 5 months prior to 
recruitment of the last participant. These changes concern central elements of the study design, which 
raised concerns during the assessment of the application. The MAH confirmed that changes made to 
the study design in Protocol Amendments 2 and 3 resulted from data external to KEYNOTE-859 study 
data that emerged after the start of the study. The MAH clarified that results from KEYNOTE-062, 
which evaluated pembrolizumab monotherapy or pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy 
versus chemotherapy alone in participants with HER2-negative PD-L1-positive advanced gastric cancer 
or GEJ adenocarcinoma, indicated a greater PFS benefit for the PD-L1 CPS ≥10 population. This led to 
the addition of PD-L1 CPS ≥10 as the primary analysis population and the changing of the order of 
testing of OS and PFS hypotheses in accordance with the CPS level in Amendment 2. The sample size 
in KEYNOTE-859 was increased from 780 to 1542 participants to maintain >80% power for the 
analysis of OS in the PD-L1 CPS ≥10 population. 
Protocol Amendment 3 was also informed by the results of CheckMate-649 study that evaluated 
nivolumab in a similar patient population and demonstrated statistically significant OS benefit in all 
examined PD-L1 CPS subgroups. Given the importance of the OS endpoint, the KEYNOTE-859 protocol 
design was updated to assign all initial alpha to the primary OS endpoint and test PFS in a step-down 
manner.  
The reasons for the implemented changes based on the outlined external data are considered plausible 
and can be followed. Also considering that the study has been conducted with a double-blind design, it 
Assessment report

appears sufficiently reasonable to accept that the amendments were not triggered by knowledge of 
internal study data.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Efficacy results were provided from the IA of Study KEYNOTE-859 as of the data cutoff date of 03-
OCT-2022 with a median follow-up time of 12 months (representing the interim OS analysis and final 
analyses for PFS and ORR). At this IA, the study met the predefined superiority criteria for all efficacy 
hypotheses: pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy provided statistically significant 
improvements in OS, PFS by BICR, and ORR by BICR in CPS ≥ 10, CPS ≥ 1 and ITT when compared 
with chemotherapy alone.  
In the ITT population (all 1579 randomised participants), an improvement of median survival was 
observed from 11.5 months in the chemotherapy group to 12.9 months in the pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy group (OS HR 0.78; 95% CI 0.70, 0.87). Median PFS was 5.6 months vs 6.9 months 
(PFS HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.67, 0.85) and ORR improved from 42% to 51.3% in the chemotherapy vs 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group, respectively. Median DOR was not statistically tested but 
favoured also the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy group (median DOR 5.7 months vs 8.0 months). 
The exploratory analyses of PRO endpoints did overall not show clinically meaningful differences 
between both treatment arms. A positive trend was seen for selected items only in selected analyses of 
EORTC QLQ-C30 in the highest PD-L1 expression group, whereas an improvement in pain (measured 
by the EORTC- QLQ-STO22) was consistently observed in favour of the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group in all populations.  
Efficacy by PD-L1 expression 
In line with the known predictive value of PD-L1 expression in gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma, an 
association of PD-L1 status with efficacy outcomes was observed in KEYNOTE-859. The largest 
difference between the prespecified analysis populations with the most meaningful benefit could be 
observed for the highest PD-L1 expression group CPS ≥10, representing 35% of the study population. 
In this subgroup, the addition of pembrolizumab to standard chemotherapy led to an improvement of 
median OS of 3.9 months (OS HR 0.65; 95% CI 0.53, 0.79), a delay in median disease progression 
(median PFS) of 2.5 months and an improvement of ORR of 17.5%.  
On the contrary, the efficacy results for the positive PD-L1 group with CPS ≥1 were only slightly better 
compared to the all participants population (ITT). In the CPS ≥1 subpopulation: OS HR 0.74 (95% CI 
0.65, 084) and PFS HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.63, 0.82) in favour of the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy 
group vs the chemotherapy group; while in the ITT population: OS HR 0.78 (95% CI 0.70, 0.87) and 
PFS HR 0.76 (0.67, 0.85).  
It is acknowledged that the study demonstrated statistically significant and consistent improvements in 
OS, PFS and ORR, not only in the predefined PD-L1 positive subgroups, but also in the ITT (all 
participants) population. Although the magnitude of the improvements is not overwhelming in the 
overall study population, it could be regarded as clinically meaningful; however, the benefit is driven 
by participants with higher PD-L1 expression levels, concealing the lack of benefit for patients with low 
PD-L1 status in the ITT analyses. With this regard, the complementary analyses that have been 
provided are considered relevant, though they are retrospective and exploratory (given the design of 
the prespecified hypothesis testing).   
Efficacy analysis in the subgroup of participants with PD-L1 CPS <1 (21.8% of KEYNOTE-859 study 
population) did not show a meaningful benefit regarding OS or PFS for the addition of pembrolizumab: 
OS HR 0.92 (95% CI 0.73, 1.17), PFS HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.70, 1.15). The KM curves largely overlap for

OS, PFS and DOR. Considering the amount of external clinical data supporting the predictive relevance 
of PD-L1 expression in gastric/GEJ adenocarcinoma, the fact that all patients were centrally tested with 
a validated assay for this disease setting and that PD-L1 CPS </≥1 was a stratification factor, the 
subgroup results are considered reliable. Given the lack of benefit in OS and PFS and in view of the 
additional toxicity of the immunochemotherapy combination, the B/R balance is not considered 
favourable in this subgroup. Therefore, the indication wording was revised to restrict the target 
population to adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥ 1. 
Subgroup results in the PD-L1 CPS <10 population similarly suggest only a modest benefit: OS HR 
0.86 [95% 0.75, 0.98] with a late and small separation of KM curves (max. 6% difference in OS rate); 
PFS HR 0.85 (95% CI 0.74, 0.98). Nonetheless, the CPS <10 population needs to be seen as a 
composite of patients with CPS <1 and patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 to <10, and results for the CPS ≥1 
to <10 population (43% of study population) are considered relevant for the decision on the most 
appropriate target population. For patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 to <10, a slightly more pronounced 
benefit is observed: OS HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.70, 0.98 with an 8% difference in OS rate), PFS HR 0.83 
(95% CI 0.70, 0.99). Taking the modest, but clear separation of OS and PFS KMs (and the upper 
confidence intervals) into account, a restriction of an indication excluding these patients does not 
appear to be justified.  
Given, however, the considerably smaller benefit in the subgroup of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 to 
<10 compared to CPS ≥10, subgroup results of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 to <10 compared to CPS ≥
10 were reflected in SmPC 5.1, as this information is considered relevant for physicians if weighing the 
B/R for individual patients when deciding on adding pembrolizumab to chemotherapy. 
Moreover, in order to get further information regarding the impact of PD-L1 expression of efficacy 
(especially in low expression groups), the MAH was asked to provide a more granular analysis by PD-
L1 score by using CPS as a continuous variable and to present efficacy results for a subgroup analysis 
based on an exploratory PD-L1 CPS cutpoint of 5 specifically. The MAH assessed the association 
between PD-L1 CPS and efficacy (OS and PFS) by using CPS as a continuous score (after square root 
transformation) in a Cox regression model. Though exploratory and post-hoc, these analyses in the ITT 
suggest an association between higher CPS scores and PFS or OS in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy group (HR (95% CI): 0.929 (0.893, 0.966), nominal 2-sided p value = 0.0002 for OS 
and HR (95% CI): 0.940 (0.904, 0.978), nominal p-value = 0.0021 for PFS). Thus, higher CPS scores 
suggest higher treatment effect. Based on the provided hazard ratio estimate and confidence intervals 
of CPS as a continuous score, no optimal cutpoint for CPS can be concluded. The MAH did not perform 
PD-L1 IHC 22C3 analyses at a CPS ≥5 cutpoint, since there is no analytical validation data at the CPS 
≥5 cutpoint for the PD-L1 22C3 pharmDx kit in gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma and therefore precision 
and reproducibility around this cutpoint is uncertain and the PD-L1 IHC 22C3 analyses would be 
potentially unreliable at a CPS ≥5 cutpoint. 
Upon request, the MAH provided post-hoc exploratory efficacy results based on the PD-L1 CPS 
cutpoints of CPS <5 and CPS ≥5, CPS ≥1 to <5, and CPS ≥5 to <10. The MAH reiterated that the CPS 
5 cutpoint was neither a prespecified endpoint nor a stratification factor, it was not analytically 
validated and no pathologist training was conducted for this cutpoint; thus, these factors may 
negatively impact the accuracy of the PD-L1 raw scores at CPS 5. Therefore, the results of these 
exploratory analyses should be interpreted with caution.  
Indeed, the provided results of the analyses based on the CPS 5 cutpoint were not fully plausible. As 
expected, a greater benefit was observed for the subgroup of patients with CPS ≥5 as compared to 
CPS <5 (OS HR of 0.70 [95% CI 0.60, 0.82] vs 0.84 [95% CI 0.72, 0.98]; PFS HR 0.69 [95% CI 0.58, 
0.81] vs 0.83 [95% CI 0.71, 0.98] for CPS ≥5 vs CPS <5, respectively). A benefit was also observed in 
the CPS ≥1 to <5 subgroup (n=468) with an OS HR of 0.78 [95% CI: 0.64, 0.95] and a PFS HR of 
Assessment report

Page 91/133 
 
 
 
0.78  [95% CI: 0.64, 0.96] with 7% higher response rates in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
arm. However, less favourable results were reported for the smallest subgroup of subjects with CPS ≥5 
to <10 (n=231; OS HR 0.94 [95% CI 0.71, 1.25); PFS HR 0.93 [95% CI 0.69, 1.25]) with even 7% 
higher response rates in the chemotherapy control arm. The lack of benefit in the comparatively higher 
PD-L1 expression group is not biologically plausible and might be questioned in the context of the 
above discussed methodological limitations. 
The MAH also provided analyses of association between PD-L1 CPS and efficacy (OS and PFS) using 
CPS as a continuous score (after square root transformation) in a Cox regression model, for CPS ≥1, 
CPS ≥10 as well as for CPS ≥5 subpopulations. These data suggest an association between higher CPS 
scores and efficacy in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group in the CPS ≥1 subpopulation, the 
same trend was also observed in the CPS ≥5 subgroup, but not in the CPS ≥10 population. 
In addition, the MAH provided graphical presentations of the relation of CPS score (square root 
transformed) to OS and PFS. The graphs did not suggest a correlation between CPS scores and OS or 
PFS (Harrell’s concordance statistics were close to 0.5).  
The methodological limitations of the exploratory analyses around the CPS 5 cutpoint are 
acknowledged; nonetheless, these results as a whole are considered supportive to select the CPS ≥1 
cutpoint as the most appropriate one in the proposed indication. Patients likely derive a greater benefit 
with increasing PD-L1 expression levels; available data do however not support CPS 5 as an alternative 
cutpoint. In view of the large subgroup of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 to <10 it is considered 
important not to ignore the potential to improve the B/R assessment for patients with advanced cancer 
in a palliative setting. Therefore, depending on the PD-L1 expression data in a given indication, the 
MAH might consider for future studies to prospectively validate and integrate additional cutpoints into 
the study design to be able to provide more reliable data by PD-L1 status. 
There was an overlap of the currently applied indication and the previously approved indication in 
patients with HER-2 negative gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma 
(EMEA/H/C/003820/II/0097) which was restricted to patients whose tumours express PD L1 with a 
CPS ≥10 (study KEYNOTE-590). The HER-2 negative GEJ adenocarcinoma indication was therefore 
removed from the oesophageal carcinoma indication in section 4.1 of the SmPC and included in the 
gastric cancer KEYNOTE-859 indication (i.e., in adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥1). 
KEYNOTE-859 enrolled a larger and broader group of participants that was more representative of the 
subgroup of patients with GEJ adenocarcinoma, including 334 participants with GEJ adenocarcinoma 
(21.2% of ITT population) as compared to 91 participants (12.1% of ITT population) in KEYNOTE-590. 
Moreover, KEYNOTE-859 enrolled participants with all subtypes of GEJ adenocarcinoma (Siewert type 
1-3), whereas KEYNOTE-590 only enrolled those with Siewert type 1. 
Among participants with GEJ adenocarcinoma in KEYNOTE-859, the point estimates for OS HR and PFS 
HR favoured pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy over chemotherapy in the ITT population (OS HR 
0.74, 95% CI: 0.582, 0.941; PFS HR 0.78, 95% CI: 0.609, 1.007) and for participants whose tumours 
express PD L1 CPS ≥1 (OS HR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.84; PFS HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.82). These 
results were generally consistent with the overall study population. 
Among participants with GEJ adenocarcinoma in KEYNOTE-590, the point estimates for OS HR and PFS 
HR also favoured pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the ITT population (OS HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.45, 
1.17; PFS HR 0.73, 95% CI: 0.45, 1.18) and among participants whose tumours express PD L1 CPS 
≥1 (OS HR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.40, 1.18; PFS HR 0.72, 95% CI: 0.42, 1.24).  
Of note, the efficacy analyses among participants with GEJ adenocarcinoma in KEYNOTE-590 whose 
tumours express PD L1 CPS ≥1 were post-hoc exploratory analyses using raw score values for PD-L1 
Assessment report

IHC 22C3 expression at CPS ≥1. Results were based on relatively small numbers and the CIs are wide. 
On the contrary, the CPS ≥ 1 cutpoint was prespecified in the KEYNOTE-859 efficacy analyses. 
Given  these  rather  consistent  efficacy  results  across  both  studies  among  participants  with  GEJ 
adenocarcinoma whose tumours express PD L1 CPS ≥1, CHMP agreed on the proposed CPS ≥1 cutpoint 
for the GEJ adenocarcinoma indication.  
Subgroups 
Subgroup analyses of OS, PFS and ORR showed overall consistent results across different subgroups 
with the exception of MSI status. Subjects with MSI high (4.7% of study population) had substantially 
better efficacy results compared to subjects with non-MSI-high status: OS HR 0.34 vs 0.79, PFS HR 
0.27 vs 0.79, ORR 42.3 vs 6.3 for the comparison of MSI high vs non-MSI-high; 95% CI were non-
overlapping across all endpoints. Given the small sample size of the MSI-high population, ancillary 
analysis in subjects with non-MSI-high status were consistent with the primary analysis in the ITT (All 
participants) population.  
Post-hoc subgroup analysis of OS by prior oncological radiation did not show a benefit in the subgroup 
of participants who did receive previous radiotherapy (OS HR 1.12, 95% CI: 0.63, 1.987). It is 
acknowledged that no reliable conclusions can be drawn from these post-hoc exploratory analyses, 
considering the small sample size (n=62 of 1579; 4%) and the wide CI. It is however noted this has 
been similarly observed for nivolumab in study CheckMate649, where the benefit of Nivo+Chemo over 
chemo appeared less clear in patients with previously untreated advanced or metastatic gastric, 
gastroesophageal junction cancer or oesophageal adenocarcinoma who had received prior radiotherapy 
(OS HR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.33; 9.6% of study population) (EMEA/H/C/003985/II/0096). 
3.7% of patients had locally advanced unresectable disease (28 and 30 participants in both treatment 
arms) with disease stage between IIA and IIIC (according to baseline characteristics). The MAH did not 
provide efficacy data by disease status, since subgroup analysis was not performed if any level of a 
subgroup variable had fewer than approximately 5% of the ITT population. It is acknowledged that no 
reliable conclusions could be drawn based on efficacy analysis of this small sample size and a similar 
treatment effect might be assumed for locally advanced and metastatic disease. According to ESMO 
Clinical Practice Guidelines, multimodality treatment including pre- and post-operative chemotherapy is 
recommended for localised gastric cancer (Stage IB-III >T1 and/or ≥ NO MO) (Lordick et al. Annals of 
Oncology 07/2022).  For patients with locally advanced adenocarcinoma of the gastroesophageal 
junction perioperative chemotherapy as well as neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is recommended 
(Obermannová, Annals of Oncology 07/2022). Since the inclusion criteria for Study KN859 only 
specified “diagnosis of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma”, 
the MAH provided further clarification that recruitment occurred in high-volume centres and 
resectability was determined by individual patient case assessments by experienced multidisciplinary 
teams that included consulting surgeons and oncologists.  
Subgroup analyses by age category (<65, ≥65 to <75, and ≥75 years) showed improved results for 
OS, PFS and ORR in all 3 age categories with pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy when compared with 
chemotherapy.  
Cross-study comparisons were not made due to study differences between KEYNOTE-859 and other 
gastric studies in treatment regimens, monotherapy versus combination therapy, patient population 
enrolled in the studies (line of therapy), study design, and biomarker selection. 
Additional efficacy analyses 
PFS and ORR analysis results per INV assessments were provided as supportive analyses, which 
showed consistent treatment effects that favoured pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy.

Supportive studies  
The phase 3 Study KEYNOTE-062 failed to demonstrate a statistically significant benefit for the 
addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy in the 1L treatment of advanced HER2-negative 
GEJ/gastric adenocarcinoma. The MAH presented these negative study results in the context of the 
current application.  
The MAH provided the following discussion: The first evidence of activity of pembrolizumab in 
advanced gastric cancer was obtained from KEYNOTE-059 in the 3L setting. Building on these data, 
KEYNOTE-061 and KEYNOTE-062 were initiated in 2015 and sought to evaluate the activity of 
pembrolizumab in previously treated and untreated patients, respectively. At the time, the activity of 
pembrolizumab as a monotherapy, and other anti-PD-1 inhibitors, was demonstrated in melanoma and 
lung cancer and being explored in a multitude of other tumours. KEYNOTE-061 and KEYNOTE-062 
were designed as such without a chemotherapy backbone, except for 1 arm in KEYNOTE-062, which 
was pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy. As more data became available from the overall 
pembrolizumab development program coupled with external data in gastric cancer, it was evident that 
chemotherapy had to be a backbone for certain tumour types and that the magnitude of benefit with 
the addition of an anti-PD-1 could vary by tumour type.   
Subsequently KEYNOTE-859 was designed to evaluate treatment with a chemotherapy backbone plus 
the addition of pembrolizumab in advanced and unresectable gastric cancer patients who have not 
received prior therapy (1L) and its design reflects an updated understanding of the role of anti-PD-1 
inhibition in gastric cancer. 
KEYNOTE-062 and KEYNOTE-859 both enrolled untreated, locally advanced/unresectable or metastatic 
gastric of GEJ adenocarcinoma, however, there were some distinguishing characteristics for each 
study.  
1. 
KEYNOTE-062 was a 3-arm study of pembrolizumab vs. chemotherapy, and pembrolizumab 
plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy, while KEYNOTE-859 was a 2-arm study of 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. chemotherapy.  
2. 
KEYNOTE-062 enrolled patients with tumour PD-L1 expression of CPS ≥1 while KEYNOTE-859 
was an all-comer population with stratification according to CPS ≥1.  PD-L1 CPS ≥10 
hypotheses were added in KEYNOTE-859 protocol amendment 2 in addition to PD-L1 CPS ≥1. 
This change was based on KEYNOTE-062 data. 
3. 
KEYNOTE-062 statistical assumptions and design were modelled after early studies with 
pembrolizumab in melanoma and lung cancer (KEYNOTE-001, KEYNOTE-002, KEYNOTE-006, 
KEYNOTE-010) and in retrospect may have been too aggressive for gastric cancer as it is a 
different tumour type. In addition, the KEYNOTE-062 results and external studies showed a 
delayed treatment effect for OS and PFS for pembrolizumab. Based on these learnings, 
KEYNOTE-859 was amended to update the HR assumptions and incorporate piecewise 
modelling assumptions (ie, nonproportional hazard model). 
Therefore, KEYNOTE-859, which is a large, randomised, global, double-blind, Phase 3 pivotal study 
further establishes the benefit of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy in the 1L setting compared with 
chemotherapy for patients with advanced or unresectable gastric cancer.

2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In previously untreated patients with advanced HER2 negative gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma, data 
from KEYNOTE-859 demonstrated statistically significant improvements in OS, PFS, and ORR for 
pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. However, the 
benefit in the overall study population is driven by participants with higher PD-L1 expression levels. 
Considering the totality of efficacy data by PD-L1 expression, the most pronounced benefit is observed 
for patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥10, whereas data in patients with CPS <10 show only a marginal 
improvement. However, among the CPS <10 population, patients with PD-L1 CPS <1 are those who do 
not seem to derive meaningful benefit from the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy. As a 
result, the target population was restricted to adults whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥1. 
Subgroup results of patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 to <10 compared to CPS ≥10 are reflected in SmPC 5.1 
as this information is considered relevant for physicians. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety results are based on data from the IA of the KEYNOTE-859 study for the pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy and placebo plus chemotherapy (hereafter chemotherapy) groups (DCO date of 03-
OCT-2022). This IA includes 1269 OS events as of the DCO date of 03-OCT-2022, with approximately 
12 months of follow-up after last participant was randomised.  
Safety analyses were based on the ‘all participants as treated’ (APaT) population, which included all 
randomised participants who received at least 1 dose of study intervention.  
Pooled safety data from studies of pembrolizumab monotherapy in approved indications in the EU 
(pembrolizumab monotherapy Reference Safety Dataset (RSD)) are included to enable a comparison of 
the safety profile of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy observed in KEYNOTE-859 to the established 
safety profile for pembrolizumab monotherapy. Pooled safety data from studies of pembrolizumab in 
combination with chemotherapy (the pooled pembrolizumab plus chemo dataset) represents a 
heterogeneous group of participants with different indications and chemotherapeutic regimens 
compared with participants in KEYNOTE-859.

Patient exposure 
As of the DCO date (03-OCT-2022) of KEYNOTE-859, a total of 785 participants in the pembrolizumab 
plus chemotherapy group and 787 participants in the chemotherapy group had received at least 1 dose 
of study treatment.

 b Drug exposure is defined as the time from the first dose date to the earlier of the last dose date + 30 or the database cut-
off date. 
 c Determined by the investigator to be related to the drug. 
 d Defined as an action taken of dose reduced, drug interrupted or drug withdrawn. 
 Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are included. 
 MedDRA v25.0 preferred terms ”Neoplasm progression”, ”Malignant neoplasm progression” and ”Disease progression” not 
related to the drug are excluded. 
 Grades are based on NCI CTCAE version 4.03. 
 For KN001 and KN054, a new AE episode was recorded when there was any AE change in grade, relationship, or 
seriousness. If the episode date ranges were continuous, then these records were counted as one AE episode.

Every participant is counted a single time for each applicable row and column. 
 A specific adverse event appears on this report only if its incidence in one or more of the columns meets the incidence 
criterion in the report title, after rounding. 
 Grades are based on NCI CTCAE version 4.03. 
 Non-serious adverse events up to 30 days of last dose and serious adverse events up to 90 days of last dose are 
included. 
 MedDRA v25.0 preferred terms "Neoplasm Progression", "Malignant Neoplasm Progression" and "Disease Progression" 
not related to the drug are excluded.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated to reflect the addition of the KEYNOTE-859 population of 
gastric and gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma patients, receiving pembrolizumab in 
combination with fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy, into the current 
‘pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy’ pooled dataset (N=4258).

Laboratory findings 
The incidence of the most frequently reported laboratory abnormalities was similar between the 
pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy and chemotherapy groups (data not shown). The most common (≥
55% incidence) laboratory abnormalities (all grades) in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group 
were decreased haemoglobin, decreased platelets, decreased neutrophils, decreased leukocytes, 
decreased lymphocytes, increased AST, and decreased albumin. 
A total of 3 participants in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group and 2 participants in the 
chemotherapy group met one of the prespecified laboratory criteria for potential drug-induced liver 
injury (DILI) (increase in ALT or AST ≥3× ULN and bilirubin ≥2× ULN and alkaline phosphatase <2× 
ULN), but no participant met the full criteria for the AE of DILI.

Table 75 Adverse Event Summary by Region (Western Europe, Ex-Western Europe) (APaT Population) 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
As pembrolizumab is an IgG antibody that is administered parenterally and cleared by catabolism, food 
and drug-drug interaction (DDI) are not anticipated to influence exposure. 
Studies evaluating pharmacodynamic drug interactions with pembrolizumab have not been 
conducted. However, as systemic corticosteroids may be used in combination with pembrolizumab to 
ameliorate potential side effects, the potential for a PK DDI with pembrolizumab as a victim was 
assessed as part of the population pharmacokinetics (PPK) analysis (data not shown). No relationship 
was observed between prolonged use of systemic corticosteroids and pembrolizumab exposure. 
Nevertheless, the use of systemic corticosteroids or other immunosuppressants before the start of 
pembrolizumab treatment should be avoided because of their potential interference with the 
pharmacodynamic activity and efficacy of pembrolizumab. However, systemic corticosteroids or other 
immunosuppressants can be used after starting pembrolizumab treatment to treat immune-mediated 
adverse reactions. Corticosteroids can also be used as premedication, when pembrolizumab is used in 
combination with chemotherapy, as antiemetic prophylaxis and/or to alleviate chemotherapy-related 
adverse reactions (see section 4.5 of the SmPC).

•  The percentage of participants with drug-related AEs leading to interruption of 
pembrolizumab/placebo in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group was higher than the 
chemotherapy group (54.4% vs 42.7%). 
•  The most common drug-related AEs (≥5% of participants) leading to treatment interruption of 
pembrolizumab in the pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy group were decreased neutrophil count, 
decreased platelet count, neutropenia, and diarrhoea. 
Post marketing experience 
The safety profile of pembrolizumab was summarized in the Periodic Safety Update Report covering the 
period 04-SEP-2021 through 03-SEP-2022, specifically Appendix 20.3. No revocation or withdrawal of 
pembrolizumab registration for safety reasons has occurred in any country. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The evaluation of the safety profile of pembrolizumab for the indication of 1st line treatment of 
patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma was primarily based on the pivotal study KEYNOTE-859 (KN859) (n=785 in the 
pembrolizumab+ chemotherapy group vs n=787 in the placebo +chemotherapy group). Data from the 
interim analysis IA with data cutoff of 03-OCT-2022 were submitted.  Comparisons of the 
pembrolizumab + chemo pooled dataset (n=3123) and the pembrolizumab monotherapy reference 
safety dataset (RSD) (n=7631) were included.  
The median duration of exposure was 6.7 months in the KN859 pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm 
and 5.59 months in the KN859 chemotherapy arm. 203 (25.9%) subjects in the pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy arm and 128 (16.3 %) subjects in the chemotherapy arm received treatment for ≥ 
12 months.   
With regards to demographics and disease characteristics, KN859 study arms were well balanced 
between the two treatment groups, more participants in KEYNOTE-859 were male and Asian, and 
fewer participants were enrolled from EU sites as compared to pembrolizumab combo and 
pembrolizumab monotherapy datasets, as expected based on the epidemiology of gastric/GEJ cancer.  
The Adverse Event Summary demonstrated similar incidences of AEs between the pembrolizumab 
+chemotherapy group and chemotherapy group. The observed incidence of SAEs (45.2 % versus 
40.2%), drug-related SAEs (23.4 vs 18.6%) and drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (59.4% vs 51.1%) was 
slightly higher for the pembrolizumab + chemotherapy.  
In KN859 a comparison of the frequencies of the most common AEs by treatment group showed high 
incidences of nausea, anaemia, vomiting, and diarrhoea (>30%). AEs reported at higher frequencies 
for pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy were anaemia, vomiting, aspartate aminotransferase 
increased, pruritus and hypothyroidism (difference at least 5%).  
The overall incidences of AEs in the KEYNOTE-859 Dataset was similar compared to the pooled 
pembro+chemo Reference Safety Dataset.  
Regarding drug-related AEs pembrolizumab + chemotherapy could be regarded as comparable to 
placebo+chemotherapy; most frequently reported (≥20% incidence) were nausea, diarrhoea, anaemia, 
vomiting, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome, decreased appetite and fatigue.

Overall analysis of Grade 3 to 5 AEs was slightly elevated in the pembrolizumab group; Grade 3 to 5 
AEs were reported in 75.3 % of subjects in the pembrolizumab +chemotherapy arm and 69.6 % in the 
placebo+chemotherapy arm. Anaemia (12.1% vs. 9.7%), Neutrophil count decreased (9.8% vs. 8.1%) 
and neutropenia (7.4% vs. 8.6%) were the preferred terms with the highest incidences in the 
pembrolizumab + chemotherapy arm as well as in the placebo+ chemotherapy arm. When compared 
with the pembrolizumab + Chemo RSD, the analysis of Grade 3 to 5 AEs by SOC demonstrated lower 
rates.  
Analysis of drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs revealed a similar picture. The overall incidence of drug-
related Grade 3 to 5 AEs was higher in the pembrolizumab arm (59.4%) compared with the 
chemotherapy arm (51.1%). The most frequently reported drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs in both 
treatment arms were decreased neutrophil count, anaemia and neutropenia.   
The incidence of serious adverse events (SAEs) was slightly higher in the pembrolizumab + 
chemotherapy group (45.2 %) compared to the placebo+chemotherapy group (40.2 %) in KN859. The 
most frequently reported SAEs (≥2% incidence) in the pembrolizumab plus chemo group were 
diarrhea, pneumonia, vomiting and colitis. The most frequently reported drug-related SAE (≥3% 
incidence) in both the pembrolizumab plus chemo and chemo groups was diarrhea (3.9% and 3.0% of 
participants, respectively).   
A total of 64 vs 58 patients died due to AEs in the investigational vs control arm of KN859 study. Of 
those, 8 AEs in the pembro +chemo group and 16 AEs in the placebo+chemo group were treatment-
related according to investigator or sponsor, i.e. diarrhoea (2 cases) and pneumonitis (2 cases). 
Pneumonitis is a known ADR for pembrolizumab.  
As anticipated, the incidence of Adverse events of special interests (AEOSIs) was higher in the 
pembrolizumab +chemotherapy arm of KN859 compared to the placebo+chemotherapy arm (30.8% 
vs. 13.3%). When comparing KN859 to the other datasets, frequency of AEOSI was comparable to 
both Reference Safety Dataset (33.7% in pembrolizumab + chemo combo pooled dataset and 26.8% 
in pembrolizumab monotherapy dataset). The frequency of each AEOSI observed in the KN859 
population was comparable to the Reference Safety Dataset chemo combo and monotherapy).  
Overall, most AEOSI were Grade 1 or 2 in severity and nonserious. Grade 5 AEOSI occurred in 1 
patient in the pembrolizumab plus chemo group (pneumonitis). The most common (>3% incidence) 
AEOSI categories reported in the pembrolizumab plus chemo group were hypothyroidism (15.3%), 
infusion reactions (5.6%), hyperthyroidism (5.6%), colitis (3.3%) and pneumonitis (3.2%). The 
frequency and severity of AEOSI categories in the pembrolizumab plus SOC group were generally 
consistent with the pembrolizumab plus chemo pooled group and monotherapy RSD.  
The most common AEs (≥1% incidence) leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in the 
pembrolizumab plus SOC group were diarrhoea (1.0%) colitis and pneumonia (0.8%).  The most 
common AEs (≥5% incidence) leading to treatment interruption of any drug in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemo group were neutrophil count, decreased platelet count, neutropenia, and diarrhoea.  
With regard to laboratory value, the MAH reported three participants in the pembrolizumab plus SOC 
arm meeting the prespecified laboratory criteria for drug-induced liver injury (vs 2 in the control arm). 
Further, it is noted a higher incidence of ALT, AST and bilirubin increase as AEs in the experimental vs 
the control arm, also as compared to the pembro combo pooled dataset.  
The adverse event summary showed similar incidence in the pembrolizumab plus SOC arm between 
patients <65 years and ≥ 65 years, however SAEs (40.4% vs 53. 0%), Grade 3-5 AEs (71.8% vs 
80.8%) and death due to AEs (0.6% vs 1.7%) and discontinuation due to AEs (30.8% vs 35.8%) were 
more frequent in patients ≥ 65 years. A similar pattern is however observed also in the SOC arm, as 
well as in the pembro combo pooled dataset. The same observation is made according to age

categories <65, 65-74 and 75-84. Only 56 patients were older than 75 years, considering the dataset 
as too limited in this subgroup. 
The frequency of ADRs in patients treated with pembrolizumab + chemotherapy has been updated in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC to reflect the data on the ‘pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy’ 
pooled dataset including the KEYNOTE-859 population.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a result of this variation, sections 4.1, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC are being updated. Section 4 of the 
Package Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package 
leaflet has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
The changes in the package leaflet are related to the extension of the indication “a kind of stomach 
cancer called gastric or gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma” in section 1 “What KEYTRUDA is 
and what it is used for”.  There are no other proposed changes to the content of the package leaflet. In 
particular the key messages for the safe use of the medicinal product are not impacted. Furthermore, 
the design, layout and format of the package leaflet will not be affected by the proposed revisions. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The finally approved indications is: 
KEYTRUDA, in combination with fluoropyrimidine and platinum-containing chemotherapy, is indicated 
for the first-line treatment of locally advanced unresectable or metastatic HER2-negative gastric or 
gastro-oesophageal junction adenocarcinoma in adults whose tumours express PD L1 with a CPS ≥ 1 
(see section 5.1). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Fluoropyrimidine/platinum doublet regimens containing cisplatin or oxaliplatin and 5-FU or capecitabine 
are the most frequently used as 1L chemotherapy regimens for patients with metastatic gastric/GEJ 
disease worldwide 6. Recently, the combination of nivolumab and fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-
containing chemotherapy was approved for the treatment of HER2-negative advanced or metastatic 
gastric, GEJ, and esophageal adenocarcinoma whose tumours express PD-L1 with a combined positive 
score (CPS) ≥ 5 (Opdivo II/96).

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The extension of indication is based on the double-blinded, global study KEYNOTE-859 that randomised 
1579 participants with previously untreated, HER2-negative, advanced gastric or GEJ adenocarcinoma 
to receive pembrolizumab or placebo in combination with chemotherapy (cisplatin/5-FU or capecitabine 
and oxaliplatin).  
3.1.  Favourable effects 
At the IA, the study met the predefined superiority criteria for all efficacy hypotheses: pembrolizumab 
in combination with chemotherapy provided statistically significant improvements in OS, PFS, and ORR 
in CPS ≥ 10, CPS ≥ 1 and ITT when compared with chemotherapy alone: 
- The efficacy analysis in the ITT population showed advantage of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy 
over placebo plus chemotherapy in the primary endpoint OS (0.78 (95% CI 0.70, 0.87), median OS 
12.9 vs 11.5 months). Efficacy was also shown on the secondary endpoints PFS (0.76 (95% CI 0.67, 
0.85), median PFS 6.9 vs 5.6 months) and ORR (51% vs 42%, difference 9%). 
- The efficacy analysis in the population with expression of PD-L1 CPS ≥1 (78% of study population), 
also showed advantage of pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy over placebo plus chemotherapy in the 
primary endpoint OS (HR 0.74 (95% CI 0.65, 0.84); median OS 13.0 vs 11.4 months). Efficacy was 
also shown on the secondary endpoints PFS (HR 0.72 (95% CI 0.63, 0.82), median PFS 6.9 vs 5.6 
months) and ORR (52% vs 43%, difference 9.5%). 
- In the population with expression of PD-L1 CPS ≥10 (35% of study population), pembrolizumab plus 
chemotherapy also showed superiority over placebo plus chemotherapy in OS (HR 0.65 (95% CI 0.53, 
0.79), median OS 15.7 vs 11.8 months), PFS (HR 0.62 (95% CI 0.51, 0.76), median PFS 8.1 vs 5.6 
months) and ORR (61% vs 43%, difference 17.5%). 
3.2.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Efficacy analysis in the subgroup of participants with PD-L1 CPS <1 (21.8% of study population) did 
not show a meaningful benefit regarding OS or PFS for the addition of pembrolizumab: OS HR 0.92 
(95% CI 0.73, 1.17), PFS HR 0.90 (95% CI 0.70, 1.15). Patients with PD-L1 CPS <1 are those that 
most clearly do not derive any meaningful benefit by the addition of pembrolizumab to chemotherapy 
and for these patients the additional toxicity is not considered justified. 
Subgroup results in the PD-L1 CPS <10 population similarly suggest only a modest benefit: OS HR 
0.86 [95% 0.75, 0.98] and PFS HR 0.85 (95% CI 0.74, 0.98). For patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 to <10 
(43% of study population), a slightly more pronounced benefit is observed: OS HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.70, 
0.98 with an 8% difference in OS rate), PFS HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.70, 0.99). These results are reflected 
in SmPC section 5.1 for the awareness of the prescriber. 
3.3.  Unfavourable effects 
The observed incidence of SAEs (45.2 % versus 40.2%), drug-related SAEs (23.4 vs 18.6%) and 
drug-related Grade 3-5 AEs (59.4% vs 51.1%) was slightly higher for the pembrolizumab chemo 
combo.  
In KN859 a comparison of the frequencies of the most common AEs by treatment group showed high 
incidences of nausea, anaemia, vomiting, and diarrhoea (>30%). AEs reported at higher frequencies 
Assessment report  
EMA/506795/2023  
Page 129/133 
 
 
 
for pembrolizumab compared to chemotherapy were anaemia, vomiting, aspartate aminotransferase 
increased, pruritus and hypothyroidism (difference at least 5%).  
Most frequently reported drug-related AEs (≥20% incidence) were nausea, diarrhoea, anaemia, 
vomiting, platelet count decreased, neutrophil count decreased, palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome, decreased appetite and fatigue. 
Anaemia (12.1% vs. 9.7%), Neutrophil count decreased (9.8% vs. 8.1%) and neutropenia (7.4% vs. 
8.6%) were the preferred terms with the highest incidences of Grade 3-5 AEs.  
The most frequently reported drug-related Grade 3 to 5 AEs in both treatment arms were decreased 
neutrophil count, anaemia and neutropenia.   
The most frequently reported SAEs (≥2% incidence) in the pembrolizumab plus chemo group were 
diarrhea, pneumonia, vomiting and colitis.  The most frequently reported drug-related SAE (≥3% 
incidence) in both the pembrolizumab plus chemo and chemo groups was diarrhea (3.9% and 3.0% of 
participants, respectively).   
A total of 64 vs 58 patients died due to AEs in the investigational vs control arm of KN859 study. Of 
those, 8 AEs in the pembro +chemo group and 16 AEs in the placebo+chemo group were treatment-
related according to investigator or sponsor, i.e. diarrhoea (2 cases) and pneumonitis (2 cases), 
Pneumonitis is a known ADR for pembrolizumab 
As anticipated, the incidence of Adverse events of special interests (AEOSIs) was higher in the 
pembrolizumab +chemotherapy arm of KN859 compared to the placebo+chemotherapy arm (30.8% 
vs. 13.3%). When comparing KN859 to the other datasets, frequency of AEOSI was comparable to 
both Reference Safety Dataset (33.7% in pembrolizumab + chemo combo pooled dataset and 26.8% 
in pembrolizumab monotherapy dataset). Reference Safety Dataset (22.7%). The most common (>3% 
incidence) AEOSI categories reported in the pembrolizumab plus chemo group were hypothyroidism 
(15.3%), infusion reactions (5.6%), hyperthyroidism (5.6%), colitis (3.3%) and pneumonitis (3.2%)  
The most common AEs (≥1% incidence) leading to discontinuation of pembrolizumab in the 
pembrolizumab plus SOC group were diarrhoea (1.0%) colitis and pneumonia (0.8%).  The most 
common AEs (≥5% incidence) leading to treatment interruption of any drug in the pembrolizumab plus 
chemo group were neutrophil count, decreased platelet count, neutropenia, and diarrhoea.

Dataset in patients older than 75 years is limited and a statement is included in section 4.4 of the 
SmPC to reflect this limitation.

3.6.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.6.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Data from the double-blinded study KEYNOTE-859 demonstrated statistically significant improvements 
in OS, PFS, and ORR for pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy versus chemotherapy 
alone in previously untreated participants with advanced HER2 negative gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma. However, the benefit in the overall study population is driven by participants with 
higher PD-L1 expression levels. 
Overall, the safety profile of pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy (FP/CAPOX) reflects 
the established safety profile of the chemotherapy regimens administered and pembrolizumab 
monotherapy. No new safety concerns have been identified. 
3.6.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Considering the totality of efficacy data by PD-L1 expression, the most pronounced benefit is observed 
for patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥10, whereas data in patients with CPS <10 show a marginal 
improvement. For patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥1 to <10, a slightly more pronounced benefit is observed: 
OS HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.70, 0.98 with an 8% difference in OS rate), PFS HR 0.83 (95% CI 0.70, 0.99); 
in addition OS and PFS KMs clearly separate in this patient population.  
Considering the clear benefit to patients in relation to an established safety profile, it can be concluded 
that the benefits of Keytruda in combination with fluoropyrimidine and platinum containing 
chemotherapy outweigh its risks in the 1L treatment of advanced HER2-negative gastric or GEJ 
adenocarcinoma patients whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS ≥1.

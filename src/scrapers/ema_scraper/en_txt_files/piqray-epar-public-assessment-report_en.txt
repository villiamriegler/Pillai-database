1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Novartis Europharm Limited submitted on 19 December 2018 an application for 
marketing authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Piqray, through the centralised 
procedure falling within the Article 3(1) and point 3 of Annex I to Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The 
eligibility to the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 21 April 2017. 
The applicant applied for the following indication: Piqray is indicated in postmenopausal women, and 
men, with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) 
negative, advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation in combination with fulvestrant after disease 
progression following an endocrine based regimen. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 8.3 of Directive 2001/83/EC - complete and independent application  
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on applicants’ own tests and studies and/or bibliographic literature 
substituting/supporting certain test(s) or study(ies). 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 7 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0079/2017 on the granting of a (product-specific) waiver.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
New active Substance status 
The applicant requested the active substance alpelisib contained in the above medicinal product to be 
considered as a new active substance, as the applicant claims that it is not a constituent of a medicinal 
product previously authorised within the European Union.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is for the treatment of patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation 
in combination with fulvestrant after disease progression following an endocrine based regimen. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Breast cancer (BC) is the most common female cancer in Europe with an estimated incidence of over 
half a million women in 2018 (Ferlay, 2018). It is also the second leading cause of cancer-related 
death (National Breast Cancer Foundation 2018). That represents twice as many new BC cases 
annually than those of cancer in any other site and one case out of every eight European women 
before they reach the age of 85. Around 80% of the BC cases in Europe will appear in women over 50 
years. 
In men, breast cancer is a rare condition constituting < 1% of all breast cancer diagnoses (Siegel et al 
2018).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
Breast cancer can be categorised into different histopathologic subtypes based on the expression of the 
oestrogen receptor (ER), the progesterone receptor (PR), and HER2 receptor overexpression or gene 
amplification. The predominant subset of breast cancer is HR-positive, HER2-negative disease. Of the 
new cancers diagnosed worldwide each year, approximately 60%-65% are HR-positive, 20%-25% are 
HER2-positive, and 15%-18% are triple negative (Finn et al 2015).  
The cyclinD-CDK4/6-pRB axis has been described as relevant in HR-positive Breast cancer (Lamb et al 
2013). Signalling through the PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway also appears relevant in HR+ HER2- breast 
cancer. The PI3K pathway is a central oncogenic pathway that regulates cell proliferation, cell 
metabolism, growth, survival, and apoptosis. Constitutive activation of PI3K signalling is known to be a 
critical step in mediating the transforming potential of oncogenes and tumour suppressors in many 
tumour types, with PI3K as the oncogenic driver of the PI3K/AKT/mammalian target of rapamycin 
(mTOR) pathway (Liu et al 2009). Aberrant induction of PI3K pathway activity can occur through 
several events including upstream genetic alterations in receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), loss-of-
function mutations in the tumour suppressor genes (such as PTEN) as well as mutations in PIK3CA, the 
gene encoding PI3Kα (Rodon et al 2013).  
PIK3CA mutations are reported in 36% of all breast cancers and in up to 45% of HR-positive, HER2-
negative tumours (Table 1).

EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 9/174 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Table 1: PIK3K signalling pathway mutations and alterations in breast cancer 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
The diagnosis of breast cancer is based on clinical examination in combination with imaging and 
confirmed by pathological assessment. Disease stage is assessed according to the TNM system. 
Prognostic and predictive factors for breast cancer include hormone receptor and HER2 expression.  
The targeted population is advanced HR positive, HER-2 negative breast cancer patients with a PIK3CA 
mutation. Despite hormone-sensitive tumours have better prognosis than other subtypes they are still 
responsible for most of the BC-related deaths due to their high prevalence, comprising 60%-65% of all 
cases. The median OS is approximately 42 months in this patient population (Gobbini EJC 2018). 
The presence of PIK3CA mutations was reported to be an independent negative prognostic factor in a 
pooled analysis of nearly two thousand ABC patients (Sobhani et al 2018).  
2.1.5.  Management 
Chemotherapy and endocrine therapy form the backbone of the palliative systemic treatment of 
advanced breast cancer (ABC), including hormone-positive breast cancer. Treatment is case-tailored 
based on tumour and patient characteristics and the treatment choice has historically been based on 
the perceived aggressiveness of the disease.  
Endocrine therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer. 
Endocrine therapies include selective ER modulators (e.g. tamoxifen), selective nonsteroidal aromatase 
inhibitors (NSAI; e.g. letrozole and anastrozole), steroidal AIs (e.g. exemestane), and ER antagonists 
(e.g. fulvestrant) (Cardoso et al 2018). In contrast to women, male patients with HR-positive, HER2-
negative breast cancer have few approved treatment options due to sex-based differences in estrogen 
production and thus their endocrine-based therapeutic options are limited, although in practice female 
breast cancer treatment guidelines are also followed (Giordano et al 2002, Agrawal et al 2007, Patten 
et al 2013, Foerster et al 2014). 
Endocrine therapy (ET) may be given in first, second, or later lines of therapy for advanced breast 
cancer (NCCN 2018, ESMO 2018). Progressive disease ultimately develops in all patients, either due to 
primary resistance (de novo resistance defined as progressive disease (PD) within the first 6 months of 
first line ET for ABC, while on ET) or relapse/progression following an initial response (acquired 
resistance defined as PD ≥ 6 months after initiating ET for ABC, while on ET) (ESMO 2018). Despite 
significant advances in treating patients with HR-positive breast cancer, the development of endocrine 
resistance and hence disease progression remains a critical problem (Shah and Dickler 2014). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 10/174 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Once ABC progresses after first line endocrine therapy, treatment options include switching to another 
not previously used endocrine-based treatment, proceeding to chemotherapy or to one of the novel 
targeted therapy-based combinations. Chemotherapy is usually preferred in cases of visceral 
involvement or when the disease is perceived to be advancing at a fast pace (ESMO 2018).  
Two classes of targeted compounds (mTOR inhibitors, e.g. everolimus, and cyclin dependent kinase 
4/6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors, e.g. palbociclib, ribociclib, and abemaciclib) have demonstrated clinical 
efficacy when combined with endocrine therapy and obtained regulatory approvals in advanced HR-
positive, HER2-negative breast cancer (EPAR Ibrance, EPAR Verzenios, EPAR Afinitor, EPAR Kisqali).  
Currently available treatment options for HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with 
details on the magnitude of their treatment effect and important safety and tolerability issues are 
summarised in Table 2.

About the product 
Alpelisib is an α specific class I phosphatidylinositol3kinase (PI3Kα) inhibitor. Phosphatidylinositol-3-
kinases (PI3Ks) are a family of lipid kinases that are important in controlling signalling pathways 
involved in cell proliferation, motility, apoptosis and cell invasion as well as glucose metabolism. Gain 
of function mutations in the gene encoding the catalytic α subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) lead to activation 
of PI3Kα and AKT signalling, cellular transformation and the generation of tumours in in vitro and in 
vivo models. 
In breast cancer cell lines, alpelisib inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K downstream targets including 
AKT, and showed activity in cell lines harbouring a PIK3CA mutation. 
In vivo, alpelisib inhibited the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway and reduced tumour growth in xenograft 
models, including models of breast cancer. 
PI3K inhibition by alpelisib treatment has been shown to induce an increase in oestrogen receptor (ER) 
transcription in breast cancer cells. The combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant demonstrated 
increased anti-tumour activity compared to either treatment alone in xenograft models derived from 
ER-positive, PIK3CA mutated breast cancer cell lines. 
The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is responsible for glucose homeostasis, and hyperglycaemia is an 
expected on-target adverse reaction of PI3K inhibition (see SmPC section 5.1 and pharmacodynamics 
section of this report). 
The recommended indication for Piqray (alpelisib) is as follows: 
Piqray is indicated in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and 
men, with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 
(HER2)-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation after disease 
progression following endocrine therapy as monotherapy.  
Treatment with Piqray should be initiated by a physician experienced in the use of anticancer 
therapies. 
Patients with HR positive, HER2 negative advanced breast cancer should be selected for treatment with 
Piqray based on the presence of a PIK3CA mutation in tumour or plasma specimens, using a validated 
test. If a mutation is not detected in a plasma specimen, tumour tissue should be tested if available 
(see SmPC section 4.2). 
The recommended dose is 300 mg alpelisib (2x 150 mg film-coated tablets) taken once daily on a 
continuous basis. Piqray should be taken immediately after food, at approximately the same time each 
day (see SmPC section 4.2). The maximum recommended daily dose of Piqray is 300 mg  
Piqray should be co-administered with fulvestrant. The recommended dose of fulvestrant is 500 mg 
administered intramuscularly on days 1, 15 and 29, and once monthly thereafter. Please refer to the 
full prescribing information of fulvestrant. 
Treatment should continue as long as clinical benefit is observed or until unacceptable toxicity occurs. 
Dose modifications may be necessary to improve tolerability (see SmPC section 4.2).

2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The chemical name of alpelisib is (2S)-N1-{4-methyl-5-[2-(1,1,1-trifluoro-2- methylpropan-2-
yl)pyridin-4-yl]-1,3-thiazol-2-yl}pyrrolidine-1,2-dicarboxamide corresponding to the molecular formula 
C19H22F3N5O2S. It has a relative molecular mass of 441.47 g/mol and the following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of alpelisib is inferred from the route of synthesis, including the structures and 
conformation of raw materials and was elucidated by a combination of 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, 
high resolution mass spectrometry, infrared spectroscopy, UV spectroscopy and x-ray crystallography. 
The solid-state properties of the active substance were investigated by a combination of dynamic 
vapour sorption, thermogravimetric analysis and x-ray powder diffraction. A single anhydrous 
polymorph (form A) has been identified. 
The active substance is a slightly hygroscopic white crystalline powder. It exhibits pH-dependent 
solubility, being a weak base and is practically insoluble in aqueous media above pH 2 and slightly 
soluble in pH 1 hydrochloric acid.  
Alpelisib exhibits stereoisomerism due to the presence of a single chiral centre which originates in a 
starting material.

The process is convergent. The originally submitted process description was missing details on 
amounts of reagents and catalysts, reaction conditions and criticality of steps. Several mutagenic 
impurities or reagents had been identified and it was proposed to control these according to ICH M7 
option 4, i.e. detailed understanding of the process, but the control strategy to implement such an 
approach was deemed insufficient, resulting in a major objection. The applicant was able to provide a 
much more detailed process description, as well as extensive details on impurity fate and purge studies 
which demonstrated an adequate control strategy for control of impurities.  
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with 
regards to their origin and characterised. 
The commercial manufacturing process for the active substance was developed in parallel with the 
clinical development program. Changes introduced to optimise the process and ensure the quality of 
the active substance have been presented in sufficient detail and have been justified. The same 
polymorphic form of active substance has been used throughout development and clinical studies. 
The active substance is packaged in double LDPE bags stored in a drum. The primary packaging material 
complies with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, particle size distribution (laser 
diffraction, identity (IR, XRPD), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), enantiomer (chiral HPLC), residual 
solvents (GC), water content (KF), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.), and microbial enumeration (Ph. Eur.). 
Impurities present at higher than the qualification threshold according to ICH Q3A were qualified by 
toxicological and clinical studies and appropriate specifications have been set.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Analysis data on four production scale batches of the active substance from the proposed commercial 
manufacturer using the commercial process was provided. The results are within the specifications and 
consistent from batch to batch. In addition, supportive data from 51 batches manufactured throughout 
development activities by previous manufacturers using earlier process was provided.  
Stability 
Stability data from six pilot scale batches of active substance from a manufacturing site different to the 
planned commercial site, but using the same process, stored in the intended commercial package for 
up to 24 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH and 30oC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 
months under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines was provided. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, identity, impurities, enantiomer, water content, 
clarity and colour of solution, assay, particle size distribution and microbial enumeration. The analytical 
methods used were the same as for release, (other than the clarity and colour of solution tests which 
are generally not applied to active substances used in solid oral dosage formulations) and are stability 
indicating. No significant trends were observed for any of the measured attributes under any storage

conditions, other than a very slight colour change in solution for later timepoints. In addition, testing 
results for up to 12 months under long term conditions from full production scale batches from the 
planned commercial site were provided, which show equivalent behaviour to the pilot scale batches.   
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one pilot scale batch. A 
change in colour was observed, as well as an increase in impurities. Therefore, alpelisib is considered 
photolabile and should be stored protected from light. 
Samples were stored under stressed conditions including an open dish study with high temperature 
and humidity, and forced degradation studies were conducted in water, aqueous acid, base and 
peroxide. Alpelisib is stable in the solid state, but degrades under acidic, basic and oxidative aqueous 
conditions. 
A freeze/thaw study was also conducted over 1 month without impact on any of the measured 
parameters. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 36 months below 30oC, 
protected from light, in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is an immediate release film-coated tablet in three strengths: 50, 150 and 200 
mg. The 50 mg tablets are light pink and round, imprinted with L7. The 150 mg tablets are pale red 
and ovaloid, imprinted with UL7. The 200 tablets are light red and ovaloid, imprinted with YL7.  
lpelisib is highly permeable but poorly soluble in aqueous media above pH 2 and is thus considered a 
BCS class 2 compound. The polymorphic form of the active substance is retained during formulation 
steps including compression, grinding and granulation. 
All excipients, with the exception of the iron oxide colorants, which are commonly used in solid oral 
dosage forms, are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. The compatibility of the active substance with the excipients was demonstrated in dedicated 
stability studies and the function and content of each was adequately justified.  There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Various formulations were used throughout clinical trials, with some excipients being changed and the 
contents and grades of others being modified. It was demonstrated that the proposed commercial 
tablets are bioequivalent to those used in the pivotal phase 3 study by combination of a clinical 
bioequivalence study and comparative in vitro dissolution profiles. This data was provided during the 
procedure to resolve a major objection. 
Discriminatory power of the dissolution method was investigated using batches manufactured with 
slightly modified process parameters compared to the commercial finished product. The proposed 
release method is deemed to be sufficiently discriminatory. 
The manufacturing process consists of combining the drug substance and excipients via blending, 
compression, film-coating, and packaging. The development approach used some tools and concepts 
from the Quality by Design (QbD) paradigm. Risk assessment was used to identify potentially critical 
process parameters (CPPs) in the process and these were investigated experimentally. This allowed 
suitable target set-points and operating ranges to be defined for the CPPs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020

The  primary  packaging  is  PVC/PCTFE/alu  blisters.  The  materials  comply  with  Ph.  Eur.  and  EC 
requirements.  The  choice  of  the  container  closure  system  has  been  validated  by  stability  data  and  is 
adequate for the intended use of the product.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of four main steps: blending; compression; film-coating; 
packaging. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on one batch of each strength which 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. A validation scheme was provided for validation studies on a further 
batch of each strength prior to commercialization. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of 
manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. CPPs have been identified and suitable controls are in 
place. Proven acceptable ranges have been defined for relevant parameters in these steps. The 
available development data, the proposed control strategy and batch analysis data from commercial 
scale batches manufactured so far fully support the proposed PARs. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form 
including appearance, mean mass, identity (UV, HPLC), water content (KF), dissolution (UV), 
uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), degradation products (HPLC), assay (HPLC) and microbial 
enumeration. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Parameters included in the specification cover all the critical aspects for ensuring the quality of the 
drug product and guaranteeing safety and efficacy.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. The risk of elemental 
impurities was deemed negligible which was confirmed by batch analysis data from active substance, 
excipients, coating pre-mixes and from 3 batches of finished product using a validated ICP-MS method. 
Each relevant elemental impurity was well below its respective oral PDE. Therefore, no test for 
elemental impurities is warranted. 
A risk evaluation for the possible presence of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance and 
finished product was conducted in line with the guidance provided in the Question and answers on 
“Information on nitrosamines for MAHs (EMA/CHMP/428592/2019 Rev. 2). 
The assessment covered the synthetic process to the active substance, including raw materials, and 
the various components of the finished product, as well as its manufacturing process and packaging. 
No controls are deemed necessary. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 registration batches of each strength confirming the 
consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification.  
The finished product is released on the market based on the above release specifications, through 
traditional finished product release testing.

Stability of the product 
Stability data from three production scale batches of each strength of finished product stored for up to 
24 months under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH and 30ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months 
under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
batches of medicinal product were representative of those proposed for marketing and were packed in 
the primary packaging proposed for marketing. Samples were tested for identity, appearance, 
degradation products, assay, water content, dissolution, microbial enumeration and crushing strength. 
The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
There are no significant changes to impurities or assay under any of the tested conditions, other than a 
slight increase in one impurity at 30 and 40ºC (well within the specified limit). There was a small 
increase in water content at 30 and 40ºC but this did not impact on dissolution rate. Overall, the 
observed physical and chemical changes were small, and not likely to have a significant effect on 
efficacy and safety of the product when used according to the directions in the SmPC. 
In addition, one batch of each strength was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on 
Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The finished product is not 
photosensitive. 
A freeze and thaw cycle test was conducted on one batch of each strength. There was no impact on 
any of the tested properties. In addition, samples of each strength previously stored in the blister 
packs for up to 9 months were removed from their packaging and placed in an open petri dish (25ºC / 
60% RH and 30ºC / 75% RH) for up to 3 months. Other than an increase in water content, there was 
no impact on measured physical or chemical properties.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and without special storage 
conditions as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. The magnesium stearate is of 
vegetable origin. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. The major objections 
raised during the procedure on the lack of detail on the process description and control strategy, and 
the lack of a bioequivalence study for the 150 mg tablet were adequately resolved. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.

2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
All non-clinical studies relevant for the non-clinical safety assessment of alpelisib (safety pharmacology 
studies to assess neuronal and respiratory function in rats, pivotal repeat-dose toxicity studies, 
genotoxicity studies, embryo-foetal development in rats, local tolerance, primary skin 
irritation/corrosion, in vitro phototoxicity and in vivo cardiovascular safety pharmacology studies) were 
conducted in compliance with Good Laboratory Practice (GLP) principles.  
A limited number of studies that were mainly investigational (Glucose and insulin tolerance test in 
C57BL/6 mice and 4-week oral investigative skin toxicity study in female Brown Norway rats) used for 
dose range finding purposes or as early screens were not conducted under GLP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro activity 
The kinase selectivity profile of alpelisib was examined in biochemical and cellular assays. In 
biochemical assays, alpelisib inhibited p110α and its most common somatic mutations H1047R, E545K 
(IC50=4.6 nM, 4.8 nM and 4 nM) more potently than the p110δ (IC50=290 nM), p110γ (IC50=250 nM) 
and p110β isoforms (IC50=1,156 nM). Alpelisib was also found to lacked activity against the class III 
family member Vps34, the PIKKs mTOR, DNA-PK and ATR (IC50>9100 nM), other 38 tyrosine and 27 
serine/threonine-specific kinases (IC50>10µM) and was significantly less potent against the distinct 
lipid kinase PIK4β (IC50=581 nM) and cABL (IC50=2000 nM). 
Mechanistic cell-based assays confirmed the specificity of alpelisib on Class Ia PI3K isoforms. Alpelisib 
potently inhibited the phosphorylation of AKT (IC50=74 nM) in Rat1-myr-p110α cells and the 
phosphorylation of various AKT downstream effectors (direct: pGSK3 beta (S9P); indirect: p70S6K 
(T389) through mTOR) in two p110α-dependent cell lines, either the mechanistic Rat1-myr-p110α 
cells, or the MCF7 cells which carry one activating PIK3CA mutation (E545K). The inhibition of AKT 
phosphorylation in Rat1-myr-p110α cells was reversed after 30 minutes suggesting that sustained 
inhibition of the pathway and downstream effectors would require sufficient and prolonged exposure to 
the compound. On the contrary, alpelisib showed significant reduced inhibitory activity in the p110β 
and p110δ isoforms (IC50=2249 and 1213 nM, respectively) measured by quantification of S473P-AKT 
levels in Rat1-myr-p110 β and δ cells. Furthermore, alpelisib did not reduced RPS6 phosphorylation in 
TSC1-null MEFs cells, in which rapamycin-sensitive functions of mTORC1 are activated independently 
of PKB/AKT, supporting that alpelisib does not inhibit mTORC1 and alpelisib did not inhibit ATM or p53 
(a downstream effector of PIKKs DNAPK, ATM and ATR) phosphorylation. 
In biochemical assays, BZG791, the primary circulating metabolite of alpelisib, was over 500-fold less 
potent than alpelisib on p110α (IC50 = 2343 nM), over 4-fold less potent than alpelisib on the other 
class I PI3K lipid kinases and, similar to alpelisib, BZG791 was not active on Vps34 and mTOR. 
Mechanistic cell-based assays confirmed BZG791 shows no activity on the p110α, p110β and p110δ 
isoforms (IC50 >10,000 nM). 
Cell proliferation studies in more than 474 cancer cell lines indicated that the foremost positive 
predictor of alpelisib sensitivity was PIK3CA mutation as well as additional positive and negative 
associations such as PIK3CA amplification and PTEN mutation, respectively. Alpelisib showed markedly 
selective activity in PIK3CA mutated cell lines when compared to wild-type cell lines, and when 
compared to pan-PI3K inhibitors. In addition, alpelisib responsive-cell lines were found to be enriched

EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 18/174 
 
 
  
 
in indications such as breast cancer. Among 41 breast cancer cell lines studied in a different assay, 
HER2 amplified and PIK3CA mutated cell lines were more sensitive to alpelisib.  
In vivo activity 
Alpelisib PK/PD relationship and in vivo anti-tumour activity in mice 
To examine the ability of alpelisib to inhibit the PI3K/Akt pathway in a PI3Kα- dependent in vivo model, 
its PK/PD relationship was assessed in a Rat1-myr-p110α tumour bearing mouse model. Each female 
athymic mouse received a single dose or repeated doses of alpelisib (12.5 mg/kg, 25 mg/kg or 50 
mg/kg, p.o). Plasma and tumours samples were collected for PK and PD analysis at different time 
points. In these experiments, alpelisib treatment was associated with dose and time-dependent 
inhibition of the PI3K/Akt pathway and near complete inhibition of S473P-Akt for 16 hours, which 
notably paralleled time-dependent drug exposure in tumour and plasma. 
To determine whether dose- and time-dependent pathway inhibition was linked to anti-tumour activity, 
Rat1-myr-p110α tumour-bearing nude mice were treated orally once a day (qd) with the compound for 
up to 8 consecutive days. Treatments of 12.5, 25 and 50 mg/kg were well tolerated and resulted in a 
dose-dependent and statistically significant anti-tumour effect with a T/C of 14.1% and regressions of 
9.6 and 65.2% respectively. 
To better understand the degree of PI3Kα inhibition that is required for anti-tumour efficacy, the 
tumour drug concentrations giving 50% (in vivo IC50) and 80% (in vivo IC80) S473P-Akt inhibition 
(0.4 and 4 μmol/L, respectively) were first determined by measuring the extent of Akt phosphorylation 
using RPPA and the specific tumour drug concentration in matched samples from multiple animals and 
at multiple time points (Figure 13). A nearly linear relationship was found between the anti-tumour 
efficacy magnitude and duration of drug exposure over the IC80 (R2=0.80, p<0.001, n=11). From this 
relationship, it appears that 80% inhibition of Akt phosphorylation for at least 29% of the dosing 
interval is required for alpelisib to induce tumour stasis, and that this level of pathway inhibition must 
be sustained for at least 45% of the dosing interval to produce 30% tumour regression in the Rat1-
myr-p110α tumour-bearing nude mice. 
To assess the relative PI3K selectivity in vivo, BYL719 was tested in a corresponding Rat1-myr-p110δ 
model. BYL719, when tested at the optimal dose of 50 mg/kg p.o., every day, showed only a modest 
antitumor effect (T/C of 30%) and it did not achieve 80% inhibition of AKT phosphorylation (in vivo 
IC80 = 29 µmol/L; corrected for BYL719 plasma protein binding in mouse IC80 = 2,552 mmol/L) most 
likely explaining the modest anti-tumour effect observed and in line with the modest activity of the 
compound on p110δ. 
PK/PD and anti-tumour activity of alpelisib in breast cancer 
The PK/PD relationship of alpelisib was assessed in the BT-474 luminal B breast tumour bearing mice 
model which harbours a K111N mutation in PIK3CA and ERBB2 amplification. Each female athymic 
mouse received a single oral dose of 50 mg/kg alpelisib. 
Tumours were collected for in vivo PK and PD analysis (Ser473P-Akt evaluated qualitatively by Western 
blot and quantitatively by Reverse protein Array) at different time points. After a single dose 
administration of 50 mg/kg, alpelisib inhibited 70% or more phosphorylation of Akt at Ser473 up to 6h. 
Inhibition at 8h was slightly less pronounced, which corresponded to the decrease in concentration of 
the compound observed in the tumour tissue at that time. Moreover, partial inhibition was still 
observed at 12 and 16h but the signalling was back to baseline activation levels at 24h. 
To determine whether the dose- and time-dependent pathway inhibition was linked to anti-tumour 
activity, BT-474 tumour-bearing nude mice were treated orally once a day with alpelisib at the doses of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 19/174 
 
 
  
 
12.5, 25 or 50 mg/kg. Alpelisib administered at 12.5, 25 and 50mg/kg produced a T/C of 30.8, 17.1 
and 3.7%, respectively and showed a statistically significant body weight loss of 8.2% at 50 mg/kg. 
These data were confirmed when alpelisib was administered in vivo at the dose of 50 mg/kg (qd, p.o) 
to different tumour models carrying either a PIK3CA mutation (T47D, MCF7), a PIK3CA mutation and a 
K-Ras mutation (HCT116), or a protein tyrosine kinase amplification (cMet in GTL16, erbB2 in NCI-
N87). BYL719 administered at the optimal dose produced an antitumor effect in all the tumour models 
tested regardless of their origin (Table 3). A synergistic anti-tumor effect was observed in the HCT116 
model when BYL-719 and the MEK inhibitor LFE158-NX were coadministered to nude mice (data not 
shown).

The  in  vivo  activity  of  alpelisib  (50  mg/kg)  was  further  investigated  in  five  xenograft  breast  cancer 
models: SUM190 (ER- and Her2+), UACC812 (ER+and Her2+), MDA361 (ER+and Her2+), KPL-1 (ER+and 
Her2-) and ZR75-1 (ER+and Her2-). Its activity was also compared with the antitumoral activity of other 
PI3K inhibitor (NVP BKM120), an mTORC1 specific inhibitor (NVP RAD001), and a dual PI3K/mTORC1/2 
inhibitor (NVP BEZ235). Significant antitumor activity was observed with each of the inhibitors in the five 
xenograft models (Figure 2).

Mice bearing tumor xenografts from the HER2 amplifies breast cancer cell lines (UACC812, 
SUM190, MDA361, KPL-1 and ZR75-1) were treated daily orally with BKM120 (35 mg/kg), 
BYL719 (50 mg/kg), RAD001 (10 mg/kg), BEZ235 (35 mg/kg) or 10 mg/kg trastuzumab 
by intraperitoneal injection twice per week. 
Figure 2: PI3K/mTOR inhibitors show in vivo efficacy in mouse xenograft models of multiple 
subtypes of human breast cancer 
Analyses of SUM190 tumours treated daily with each inhibitor revealed that at 2.5 hours after final 
dose, AKT phosphorylation was significantly reduced at both the Ser473 and Thr308 in BKM120, 
BYL719 and BEZ235 treated tumours. In contrast, levels of phospho AKT were found to be above that 
of the vehicle control in RAD001 treated tumours. However, RAD001 did induce significant decreases in 
pS6S235 236 levels in SUM190 xenografts, consistent with that induced by BKM120, BYL719, and 
BEZ235. Immunohistochemical analyses of the tissues confirmed these findings; although pAKTS473 
levels were decreased in the BKM120, BYL719 and BEZ235 treated tumours, no decrease was observed 
in the RAD001 treated tumours. RPPA analyses were repeated on samples collected 24 hours after final 
dose in the UACC812 xenografts. At this time point, pAKTS473/T308 levels were significantly increased 
in response to each molecule, indicating that feedback activation also occurs in vivo with these 
molecules. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
The potential for off-target pharmacology activity of alpelisib was also evaluated against 143 GPCRs, 
transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes, in binding assays. At a concentration of 
10 µM, alpelisib exhibited >50% inhibition against 2 targets, the adenosine Ad3 and serotonin 5HT2A 
receptors. The IC50 values for these receptors were 2.25 µM (Ki=2.15 µM) and 6.7 µM (Ki=4.6 µM), 
respectively. The results for 5HT2A receptor was found with batch NX-1 but was not confirmed with 
batch NX-2. Weaker pharmacology activity was also found on the adenosine Ad1 receptor (15 µM, 
Ki=13 µM) and the phosphodiesterase PDE4d (13 µM).  
The IC50 values of alpelisib evaluated in these assays were higher than the plasma alpelisib unbound 
Cmax of 0.7022 µM observed in patients at maximum recommended therapeutic dose levels of 300 mg 
QD,  suggesting that alpelisib is not likely to have activity against adenosine Ad3, Ad1 and serotonin 
5HT2A receptors and the phosphodiesterase PDE4d at exposures achieved in patients. 
The PI3K/Akt pathway and more specifically p110α, plays a significant role in glucose metabolism, 
particularly by mediating glucose transport into adipocytes and muscle tissues. The effects of alpelisib 
on glucose uptake were assessed in 3T3-L1 differentiated cells. The IC50 value obtained in this study 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 22/174 
 
 
  
 
 
 
was 169±75 nM. The impact of treatment with alpelisib on glucose homeostasis was assessed in more 
detail in mice and revealed that insulin plasma levels increased proportionally with alpelisib plasma 
concentrations, while blood glucose levels were maintained close to normal up to 20 μmol/L of 
alpelisib. However, above 20 μmol/L, an alpelisib concentration-dependent glucose increase was 
observed which led to hyperglycaemia despite insulin plasma level elevation. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
As part of the development program for alpelisib, several stand-alone safety pharmacology studies 
were conducted. Additionally, cardiovascular system safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated 
into study designs for the pivotal repeat-dose toxicity in dog. 
Cardiac safety was evaluated in vitro and in vivo in stand-alone studies and by monitoring ECGs and 
vital signs during the PO repeat-dose studies in dogs. 
Alpelisib had an IC50 value of 9.4 µM in the hERG assay; this concentration is approximately 13-fold 
higher than the plasma alpelisib unbound Cmax of 0.7022 µM observed in patients treated with 300 mg 
QD alpelisib.  
No treatment-related ECG effects in dog were noted within 2 and 4 and 13-week repeated oral dose 
toxicity studies up to 90 mg/kg/day and rising-dose study up to a dose of 180 mg/kg/day. At 
90 mg/kg/day, the Cmax of 40900 ng/mL and 87300 ng/ mL for male and female dogs, respectively, 
were higher than the Cmax bound plasma concentration (310 ng/mL) observed in patients treated with 
300 mg alpeisib. 
However, in vivo oral administration of alpelisib to telemetered male Beagle dogs at single doses of 0, 
5, 15 and 30 mg/kg caused a treatment-related dose-independent increase in average systolic and 
diastolic arterial blood pressure and a persistent decrease in average heart rate at all dosages. These 
doses corresponded to a Cmax of 15900-15500 ng/mL, 49400-65100 ng/mL and 72400-74400 ng/mL, 
respectively, which are at least 50-fold higher than the total plasma Cmax (310 ng/mL) observed in 
patients treated with 300 mg alpelisib.  
Neuro-functional assessment and motor activity were evaluated in male rats as part of the Functional 
Observational Battery. A single dose of alpelisib administered via oral at 80 mg/kg did not result in any 
relevant changes compared to controls. No biologically relevant changes were observed upon 
respiratory measurements using plethysmography. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
Combination with fulvestrant 
The activity of single agent BYL719 and combination with endocrine therapy (fulvestrant) was assessed 
in three cell line models of ER+ breast cancer that carry distinct genetic alterations that confer 
aberrant PI3K/AKT signalling; KPL1 (PIK3CA mutant), MCF7 (PIK3CA mutant) and ZR751 (PTEN-null). 
Each of the xenograft models tested was confirmed to be sensitive to endocrine therapy by weekly 
fulvestrant treatment. Significant anti-tumour activity was also observed with single agent BYL719 (50 
mg/kg) and the combination of BYL719 plus fulvestrant in each of the models.

While single agent BYL719 or single agent fulvestrant treatment inhibited tumour progression in all 
three models, the combination of both molecules induced putative mean tumour regressions in both 
the PIK3CA mutant KPL1 and PTEN-null ZR751 xenografts. Tolerable levels of body weight loss 
(<10%) were observed with the single agent or combination treatment arms. 
Different treatment dosage of BYL719 (25 mg/kg/day) and fulvestrant (200 mg/kg subcutaneously 
twice week) were tested in monotherapy and in combination in two well established ER 
positive/PIK3CAmut xenograft models (MCF7 and T47D cells). Daily administration of BYL719 (25 
mg/kg) resulted in modest reduction of tumour growth in both models. Fulvestrant monotherapy (200 
mg/kg, twice weekly) was sufficient to prevent further tumour growth and, in some cases, to induce 
tumour shrinkage. However, the combination of both agents showed marked tumour regression and, in 
some cases, resulted in complete tumour remissions. 
In addition, in a patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model of ER-positive PIK3CA mutant breast cancer 
where the patient had progressed on multiple lines of endocrine therapy, including fulvestrant, the 
combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant induced tumour regression as compared to very limited activity 
for either alpelisib or fulvestrant as single agents.

The in vivo activity of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant was assessed in ER+ breast cancer cell 
line xenografts progressing on everolimus (RAD001) or CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib and 
ribociclib/LEE011).  
Mice with tumours progressing on everolimus were randomised into the following treatment groups; 1) 
continue on 10 mg/kg everolimus, 2) 5 mg/week fulvestrant, 3) 35 mg/kg BYL719 daily or 4) the 
combination of BYL719 + fulvestrant. In each of these experiments, the control tumours continued to 
progress on single agent everolimus for the duration of study. Interestingly, tumours that developed 
resistance to everolimus also appear to display a decreased sensitivity to fulvestrant as well. 
Treatment with single agent BYL719 was able to slow the progression of these resistant tumours. The 
combination of BYL719 and fulvestrant induced increased inhibition of tumour progression relative to 
either single agent in 2 out of the 3 models tested. In the MCF7 (PIK3CA mutant) model, tumours 
continued to progress on everolimus, fulvestrant or BYL719 single agent treatment, however, the 
combination of BYL719 and fulvestrant induced significant tumour regressions from baseline. Tolerable 
levels of body weight loss (<10%) were observed with the single agent or combination treatment 
arms. 
Mice with tumours progressing on CDK4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib or ribociclib/LEE011) plus fulvestrant 
were randomised into the following treatment groups; 1) continue on 75 mg/kg palbociclib plus 
fulvestrant, 2) switch to 75mg/kg LEE011 plus fulvestrant, 3) or switch to 35 mg/kg BYL719 plus 
fulvestrant. Control tumours treated with palbociclib plus fulvestrant continued to progress throughout 
the duration of study, as did xenografts switched to LEE001 plus fulvestrant. However, mice switched 
from CDK4/6 inhibitor to PI3K-inhibitor showed significant regressions in engrafted tumours. Similarly, 
ER+ breast cancer cell line xenografts (HCC1500, PIK3CA wild-type) progressing on LEE011 plus 
fulvestrant showed a significant reduction in the rate of tumour progression when switched to BYL719 
plus fulvestrant. Finally, ER+ breast cancer cell line xenografts that show innate resistance to CDK4/6 
inhibition through LEE011 were found to be more sensitive to PI3K-inhibition through BYL719 plus 
fulvestrant. Body weight loss up to 6.25% was observed in animals treated with the combination of 
fulvestrant and alpelisib. This combination induced higher decrements in body weighs than the 
combination of fulvestrant and ribociclib (LEE011) and lower decrements in body weighs than the 
combination of fulvestrant and palbociclib. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic behaviour of alpelisib was investigated in mouse, rat, dog and human. 
Absorption of alpelisib-related material in the rat was estimated to be 62.5% and 53.5% in human. 
Tmax of alpelisib after single oral dosing was between 0.5 and 2 hours in all species. At highest doses 
and after multiple doses Tmax reached 3 hours in rats and dogs. The bioavailability of alpelisib in 
mouse and dog was estimated to be complete (106% and 140% in mouse and dog, respectively). 
Following i.v. dosing, blood clearance was low (0.48, 0.594 and 0.429 L/(h·kg)) compared to hepatic 
blood flow in mouse, rat and dog. The systemic half-life in blood (mouse and dog) and in plasma (rat) 
was relatively short (2.9, 3.6 and 1.5 hours, respectively). Volume of distribution was moderate (0.93 
to 1.8 L/kg) across species. 
Alpelisib exposure increased in a dose proportional manner in GLP toxicology studies conducted in rat 
and dog. Exposure increased up to 2-fold following multiple dosing in rats and no apparent 
accumulation was observed in dogs. Exposure in rat females was 1.5-2-fold higher than in rat males. 
No clear gender difference was noted in terms of AUC and Cmax in dogs.  
In pregnant rats and rabbits, exposure to alpelisib increased more than dose proportional at lower 
doses (8 fold between 3 and 10 mg/kg in rats and 6 fold between 3 and 15 mg/kg in dogs) and 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 25/174 
 
 
  
 
approximately dose proportionally at higher doses (3 fold between 10 and 30 mg/kg in rats and 1.7-
fold between 15 and 25 mg/kg in dogs). 
The plasma protein binding of alpelisib was moderate in mouse (91.24%), rat (90.65%), dog (89.2%) 
and human (89.2%) with no major species differences. 
In rats dosed with radiolabeled alpelisib, radioactivity distributed rapidly throughout the body, with 
highest tissue concentrations in liver (and bile), kidney, and harderian gland. Tmax in most tissues was 
achieved at 15 minutes and 1 hour post dose after i.v. and p.o. administration, respectively. The 14C-
alpelisib-derived radioactivity observed in the intestinal walls indicated active secretion into the lumen 
of the GI tract. In pigmented rats specific but reversible binding to melanin-containing structures was 
observed. No evidence for brain penetration of alpelisib related radioactivity was observed in the QWBA 
data. Alpelisib passed the placental barrier in rats and rabbits, but foetal plasma concentrations were 
low (rat approximately 10 fold lower; rabbit approximately 60 fold lower) compared to maternal 
plasma, most likely due to BCRP expression in the apical membrane of placental syncytiotrophoblasts 
and the fact that alpelisib is a substrate of this enzyme. 
The predominant metabolic pathway observed in rat, dog, and human was amide hydrolysis, forming 
metabolite BZG791 (M4). Other phase I oxidative metabolism and a minor amount of glucuronidation 
was observed across species but is expected to play a more minor role in metabolic elimination.  
The major component in plasma of rat, dog and human was unchanged alpelisib. The most prominent 
plasma metabolite was BZG791 which represented 3.0%, 4.61% and 26.7% of the measured AUC in 
rat, dog and human, respectively. Human exposure to this metabolite, irrespective of fed/fasted 
status, was covered by the rat, indicating that the metabolite was adequately assessed in the 
toxicology studies. BZG791 had no relevant contribution to total pharmacological activity in human. 
CYP3A4 was the main enzyme involved in the oxidative metabolism of alpelisib to M3 in vitro. Alpelisib 
was only noticeably metabolized by UGT1A9 (among the 13 UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 
isoforms tested) but displayed a low turnover in glucuronidation in general. Alpelisib hydrolysis to 
BZG791 occurred systemically by spontaneous chemical decomposition and enzymatic hydrolysis via 
ubiquitously expressed, high-capacity enzymes (esterases, amidases and choline esterase) not limited 
to the liver. BZG791 can be formed by gastric hydrolysis at low pH but only under prolonged (>3 h) 
exposure to gastric acid. 
Excretion of drug-related material in rat, dog and human was mainly via the faecal route, with a minor 
contribution by elimination into urine which occurred primarily within the first 24 hours of exposure. 
Elimination was mainly driven by metabolism but evidence for a sizeable contribution from 
hepatobiliary export and direct intestinal secretion was obtained from the rat. 
Drug-drug interactions 
To assess the risk of alpelisib becoming subject to a drug-drug interaction in vivo, both the enzymes 
and transporters that contribute to alpelisib’s elimination were identified in vitro. 
Transporters 
The in vitro permeability and efflux transporter interaction potential of alpelisib was examined in the 
Caco-2 cell monolayer model. The apparent permeability (Papp) through Caco-2 was medium-high 
(Papp (A-B) = 3.84×10-6 cm/s; Papp (B-A) = 18.25×10-6 cm/s), mediated by efflux. Apparent 
intestinal uptake of alpelisib was examined in the presence and absence of efflux pump inhibitors, 
showing that only selective inhibitors of BCRP but not inhibitors of P-gp (including cyclosporine A) or 
MRP2 (Multidrug resistance-associated protein) changed the uptake of alpelisib. Further investigations 
confirmed that alpelisib was a substrate of BCRP (Km = 2-15 μM) and a very weak substrate of P-gp 
(Km > 128 μM). In the absence of transporter-mediated efflux, the permeability of alpelisib was high 
Assessment report

with a Papp (A-B) of 11.7×10-6 cm/s compared to internal standards in a low efflux Madin-Darby 
canine kidney cell line (MDCK) permeability assay. Uptake of alpelisib in hepatocytes was shown to be 
passive in human. Active hepatobiliary disposition of alpelisib (likely via BCRP) was confirmed in 
sandwich-cultured hepatocytes. 
BZG791 was shown to permeate only at a low rate through Caco-2 monolayers (Papp = 0.4×10-5 cm/s, 
Efflux ratio ~145) most likely modulated by two or more efflux transporters (BCRP and MRP2).

Transporters inhibition 
Based on the results of transporter inhibition studies alpelisib was found to be a weak inhibitor of P-gp, 
BSEP, OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT-1, OAT3, and MATE1, with the lowest Ki being observed for OATP1B1 
(Ki = 20.9 μM). 
BZG791 was found to be a weak inhibitor of BSEP, BCRP, OATP1B3, OCT-1, OAT1, and MATE1, with 
the lowest Ki for OATP1B3 (Ki= 42.4 μM), a moderate inhibitor of OATP1B1 (Ki = 8.59 μM) and a 
strong inhibitor of OAT3 (Ki = 1.38 μM). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Alpelisib was tested in a toxicology program consisting of safety pharmacology, acute and subchronic 
toxicity as well as studies of genotoxicity and reproductive toxicity, in accordance with the ICH S9 
Guideline on Nonclinical Evaluation of Anticancer Pharmaceuticals as well as all other relevant ICH 
Guidelines on Safety (Table 8).

2-Week Study in Rats (0870725) (non-GLP) 
The purpose of this non-GLP oral toxicity study in rats [Study 0870725] was to obtain initial 
information on the toxicity of alpelisib after repeated dose administration and aid in the selection of 
appropriate dose levels for a subsequent repeated dose study [Study 0970325]. 
Daily oral administration of alpelisib to groups of 5 male rats at dosages of 5, 15 or 50 mg/kg/day was 
well tolerated at the two lower doses. At 50 mg/kg/day a moderate reduction in body weight 
development was observed without a parallel reduction in food intake. Haematological changes, 
characterised by decreases in lymphocytes, eosinophils, basophils and large unstained cells, decreases 
in reticulocyte count, haemoglobin and/or haematocrit, and a decrease in platelet count, were 
observed starting at 5 mg/kg/day with only mild decreases in lymphocytes noted in individual animals. 
All these changes indicate a test item-related effect on haematopoiesis. The decrease in globulin at 50 
mg/kg/day might be related to the decrease in lymphocytes (decreased immunoglobulin synthesis). An 
increase in glucose was observed at ≥5 mg/kg/day, which is suggestive of glucose metabolism 
impairment consistent with insulin resistance/insensitivity. Other clinical biochemistry changes 
characterised by a decrease in triglycerides associated with an increase in cholesterol were noted with 
alpelisib at 50 mg/kg/day and suggest a mild test item related effect on liver function. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 31/174 
 
 
  
 
 
Test-item related generally atrophic or degenerative microscopic findings were observed in the 
mesenteric and mandibular lymph nodes, large intestine, spleen, thymus, pancreas and/or 
sternum/bone marrow at 15 and 50 mg/kg/day. 
Toxicokinetic measurements indicated a dose-proportional increase in exposure and no accumulation of 
the test item with repeated administration. Plasma exposure to alpelisib after 2 weeks of treatment 
ranged from 5,330 to 102,000 ng·h/mL in terms of AUC0-24h and from 1,290 to 12,100 ng/mL in 
terms of Cmax at 5 to 50 mg/kg/day, respectively. Highest plasma concentrations of alpelisib were 
noted 0.5 or 1 hour post-dose. 
In conclusion, daily oral administration of alpelisib to groups of 5 male rats was well tolerated at daily 
doses of 15 mg/kg. At 50 mg/kg moderate effects on body weight development without concomitant 
effect on food intake, impaired hemopoiesis, disturbance of glucose metabolism (insulin 
resistance/insensitivity) were seen. Histopathological changes were observed in lymph nodes, 
intestine, spleen, thymus, pancreas and/or sternum/bone marrow mainly at 50 mg/kg of alpelisib and 
in some organs also in animals dosed with 15 mg/kg of alpelisib.  
4-Week Study in rats followed by 4 week recovery period (0970325) (GLP) 
The purpose of this GLP toxicity study in rats [Study 0970325] was to determine the toxicity of 
alpelisib after repeated oral administration, aid in the selection of appropriate dose levels for 
subsequent repeated dose toxicity studies and to support first clinical trials in man.  
In this study, alpelisib was administered once daily by oral gavage to groups of 10 male and 10 female 
rats at dosages of 10, 30 or 80/60/30 mg/kg/day and a dosage volume of 5 mL/kg, for 4 weeks. 
Additional 5 males and 5 females were included in the control and 80/60/30 mg/kg groups as recovery 
animals. Upon loss of animals and dose reduction in the high-dose group, animals of this group were 
reassigned to the recovery group resulting in a final distribution of 9 main-group and 6 recovery 
animals. At the end of the treatment period, recovery animals were observed for further 4 weeks to 
investigate the reversibility of treatment related effects. In addition to alpelisib, plasma levels of the 
main metabolite BZG791 were determined. 
Daily administration of 80 mg/kg/day of alpelisib resulted in a marked reduction in food intake with 
associated body weight loss and necessitated early sacrifice of 2 males and 4 females. The cause of 
moribundity at 80 mg/kg/day with early sacrifice between day 4 and 8 was related to intestinal 
toxicity. In addition, severe bone marrow toxicity was seen in these animals. Based on the weight loss 
in the remaining animals the dose was reduced to 60 mg/kg/day as of day 6 and to 30 mg/kg/day as 
of day 8.  
Daily administration of 30 mg/kg/day of alpelisib resulted in a decrease in overall food intake 
associated with lack of body weight gain. At 10 mg/kg/day a slight decrease in body weight gain was 
observed in both sexes and a slight decrease in overall food intake in females only. 
In haematology, the decrease in reticulocytes, haemoglobin, haematocrit and/or red blood cell counts 
and associated alterations in red blood cell indices, as well as the decrease in white blood cell counts 
and associated alterations in the white blood cell differential in males at 30 mg/kg/day and in females 
at ≥10 mg/kg/day may reflect a primary effect on hemopoiesis and lymphopoiesis. At 30 mg/kg/day in 
females and in the early sacrificed individuals there was also evidence of an inflammatory response.  
Clinical chemistry evaluations revealed a disturbance in the glucose metabolism at 30 mg/kg/day in 
males and at ≥10 mg/kg/day in females, as well as a disturbance in lipid metabolism and a possible 
liver effect at 30 mg/kg/day in both genders.  
At terminal necropsy, decreased organ weights associated with a morphological correlate (macroscopic 
and/or microscopic) were noted in the spleen, thymus and uterus at >10 mg/kg/day and in the 
Assessment report

prostate and liver at >30 mg/kg/day. In addition, decreased weights without morphological correlate 
were noted at >10 mg/kg/day in the pituitary and adrenal (females only) glands, and at 
>30 mg/kg/day in the kidneys, testes and ovaries. 
Microscopically, generally dose-dependent changes were noted at >10 mg/kg/day in the bone marrow 
(hypocellularity with congestion/haemorrhage), spleen (decreased hemopoiesis and lymphoid 
depletion), thymus (lymphoid depletion), lymph nodes (lymphoid depletion and reduced germinal 
centre development), endocrine pancreas (morphological changes in the islets of Langerhans) and 
prostate (decreased secretion). Mainly at >30 mg/kg/day changes were observed in the vagina 
(diffuse epithelial atrophy and atypical oestrous cycle phase with uterine atrophy) and pituitary gland 
(decreased acidophilia in the pars distalis and increased anti-FSH/LH immunoreactivity). 
Further dose-dependent changes were noted at >30 mg/kg/day in the femoral/tibial (knee joint) and 
sternal growth plate (thickening and decreased metaphyseal trabecular bone density), in incisors 
(mainly odontoblast degeneration with dentin thinning and pulpa necrosis), in tongue, esophagus, 
larynx and forestomach (diffuse epithelial atrophy), in skin and mammary area (epidermal atrophy in 
females and diffuse mammary gland atrophy) and in lacrimal glands (diffuse acinar atrophy). 
In addition, secondary treatment-related findings were noted at >30 mg/kg/day in the liver (glycogen 
decrease), exocrine pancreas (decrease of zymogen granules), seminal vesicles (decreased secretion) 
and Harderian glands (glandular dilatation). 
At the end of the recovery period all findings were fully reversible or showed a tendency towards 
reversibility (no full reversion was seen in low prostate and uterus weights, in reduced plasma 
triglyceride levels in some females, and in some blood parameters (mean corpuscular haemoglobin 
concentration, reduced white blood cell, lymphocyte and basophil counts, increased insulin with 
associated microscopic findings in hemolymphopoietic organs) of both genders). 
No distinct gender difference was observed in terms of exposure to alpelisib and its metabolite 
BZG791.  Plasma exposure to alpelisib after 4 weeks of treatment with 10 or 30 mg/kg/day ranged 
from 23,300/28,800 to 133,000/101,000 ng·h/mL in terms of AUC0-24h and from 3,080/4,730 to 
9,200/8,950 ng/mL in terms of Cmax for males/females, respectively. Corresponding plasma exposure 
to the metabolite BZG791 (M4) ranged from 1340/991 to 8330/3560 ng·h/mL in terms of AUC0-24h 
and from 195/125 to 654/298 ng/mL in terms of Cmax for males/females, respectively. Highest 
plasma concentrations of alpelisib and BZG791 were mainly noted 1 or 3 hours post-dose. 
In conclusion, administration of alpelisib to male and female Wistar rats at daily oral doses of 
80 mg/kg/day was not tolerated as indicated by marked body weight loss and the need for early 
sacrifice of 6 of 30 animals. A reduction to 60 mg/kg/day did not adequately improve this situation and 
thus the dose was reduced to 30 mg/kg of alpelisib. This dose was tolerated, but animals did not gain 
body weight. At 10 mg/kg/day body weight was slightly reduced and clinical pathology and/or post-
mortem evaluation established an effect on hemo- and lymphopoiesis, disturbances in the glucose and 
lipid metabolisms, as well as changes in endocrine pancreas and estrus cycle. Additional morphological 
alterations at ≥30 mg/kg/day were observed in bones, teeth and organs/tissues with an 
epithelial/glandular structure. Clinical pathology changes indicated also an inflammatory response. In 
general, the changes observed macro- or microscopically were fully reversible after 4 weeks of 
treatment cessation, or showed a tendency toward reversibility but no full recovery (i.e. effects on the 
hemo/lymphopoietic systems). 
A NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day was proposed based on the above (see discussion on non-clinical aspects).

13-Week Study in Rats (including micronucleus assay) followed by an 8 week recovery 
period (1070415) (GLP) 
The objective of this GLP toxicity study in rats [Study 1070415] was to determine the toxicity of 
alpelisib following daily oral (gavage) administration to the rat for 13 weeks. An assessment of delayed 
onset toxicity and / or reversibility of toxicity was made during an 8-week treatment-free period. The 
toxicokinetic profile of the test article was also assessed. The study also included a micronucleus assay 
in peripheral blood. 
In this study, alpelisib was administered by oral gavage to three groups of rats (20 or 30/sex/group) at 
daily doses of 2, 6 or 20 mg/kg/day for at least 13 weeks. Another group of rats (30/sex) received 
vehicle at an equivalent dosing volume of 5 mL/kg and served as controls. Ten animals per sex in the 
20 mg/kg/day group and in the control group were maintained on study for an 8-week recovery 
period. 
There were no deaths related to effects of alpelisib. There were no test article-related clinical signs, 
with the exception of a number of females at 20 mg/kg/day which had pale teeth. Mean body weight 
gain was dose-dependently decreased at ≥6 mg/kg/day in males and females. Group mean food 
consumption was slightly decreased at 20 mg/kg/day.  
Clinical pathology evaluations revealed dose-related and reversible, mildly to moderately lower 
absolute lymphocyte counts at ≥6 mg/kg/day correlating with the microscopic finding of lymphoid 
depletion in several lymphoid tissues. Minimally to markedly higher insulin concentrations at all dose 
levels on Days 1 and 75 of the dosing phase were evident in response to variably higher glucose 
concentrations. Increased insulin concentrations were clearly dose-related. However, findings 
suggested that impaired glucose uptake was generally adequately compensated by secondary insulin 
release to control increased blood glucose levels, and the effect was reversible after treatment 
cessation. Higher insulin concentrations correlated with the microscopic finding of pancreatic islet cell 
hyperplasia at ≥6 mg/kg/day. Most other alpelisib-related clinical chemistry effects (changes in 
aspartate aminotransferase, alkaline phosphatase, total bilirubin, lipase, amylase, triglycerides, 
cholesterol, total protein, albumin, globulin, creatinine and electrolytes, generally at 6 or 20 
mg/kg/day) were very small, showed reversibility at the end of the recovery period and none were 
associated with clearly correlating microscopic findings.  Urinalysis revealed, at 20 mg/kg/day, mildly 
lower urine specific gravity and for males only lower urine pH, which had no correlating microscopic 
findings and showed reversibility at the end of the recovery period. 
In this study, the determination of micronucleus frequencies in peripheral blood reticulocytes was 
integrated, as an endpoint to assess in vivo genotoxicity. No statistically significant difference between 
the mean micronucleus frequencies in the treated groups and the negative control group was seen and 
furthermore, no significant difference in the trend test was observed. 
At the end of the treatment period, there were organ weight reductions when compared with 
concurrent controls in the spleen, thymus and pituitary gland, which generally correlated with 
microscopic findings. Upon macroscopic examination, pale incisor teeth were noted in several females 
at 20 mg/kg/day and there was also a reduction in uterine distension at this dose level. Upon 
microscopic examination, there was minor lymphoid depletion and reduced haemopoiesis in 
haemolymphoreticular tissues, islet cell hyperplasia in pancreas, decreased cytoplasmic eosinophilia in 
pituitary gland and reduced/irregular dentin in incisor teeth of both sexes, along with reduced hyaline 
droplets in male kidney, adnexal atrophy in female skin and minor variations in the oestrous cycle in 
the uterus, related to treatment with alpelisib at 6 or 20 mg/kg/day.

At the end of the treatment-free period, findings indicated reversibility of the post-mortem changes 
recorded at the terminal examination of organ weights and macroscopic findings. There was total 
reversal of the microscopic changes in the majority of tissues and a trend was observed towards 
recovery of the microscopic changes in pancreas, mesenteric lymph nodes and to a lesser extent in 
bone marrow in femur and sternum. Plasma exposure at dose levels between 2 and 20 mg/kg/day 
alpelisib on Day 75 of treatment ranged from 2,360/4,250 to 41,900/60,300 ng·h/mL in terms of 
AUC0-24h and from 436/725 to 5070/6740 ng/mL in terms of Cmax for males/females, respectively. 
Highest plasma concentrations of alpelisib were mainly noted 0.5 or 1 hour post-dose. 
In conclusion, the daily oral gavage administration of alpelisib to male and female Wistar rats at dose 
levels of 2, 6 or 20 mg/kg/day for 13 weeks was generally well tolerated with only minor clinical signs 
(pale teeth) in high-dose females and decreased body weight gain at 6 and 20 mg/kg/day. Reversible 
major clinical pathology changes included decreased lymphocyte count, and increased insulin and 
glucose levels. Mostly minimal to slight treatment-related microscopic findings at 6 or 20 mg/kg/day in 
the haemolymphoreticular tissues, pancreas, pituitary gland and incisor teeth of both sexes, along with 
male kidney, female skin and minor variation in oestrous cycle in uterus were generally reversible or 
showed a trend towards reversibility. Furthermore, alpelisib did not induce an increase in micronuclei 
in peripheral blood reticulocytes after 4 weeks of treatment. Based on the above results, the low dose 
of 2 mg/kg/day was considered to be the ‘No Observed Adverse Effect Level’ (NOAEL).

Reproduction Toxicity 
A GLP embryofetal toxicity study in rat and a non-GLP embryofetal toxicity extended dose-range 
finding study in rabbit were conducted in order to elucidate effects on the developing foetus. Effects on 
fertility were also found in the repeat dose studies in rat and dog, which is briefly referred in this 
section. The findings are summarised in

Assessment of contact sensitizing potential with the murine local lymph node assay (LLNA 
TIER I) 
In this study, 6 female mice per group received topical test or control items on the dorsum of both 
ears once a day on 3 consecutive days. Auricular lymph nodes were taken 24 hours after the last 
application. Endpoints were visual examination ears and sizes ear-draining lymph nodes, body weight 
at treatment start and day of necropsy, ear weight (skin irritation), ear-draining lymph node weights 
and cell counts (LN hyperplasia). Concentrations used were vehicle control Dimethyl formamide, 
positive control DNCB (1-Chloro-2,4-Dinitrobenzene): 0.5% (w/w), and alpelisib: 5%, 0.5%, 0.05% 
(w/w). 
Alpelisib did not cause any relevant changes in ear weight, LN weight or LN count up to a concentration 
of 5% in Dimethyl formamide. 
Primary skin irritation/corrosion study in the rabbit 
Each animal was treated by dermal application of 0.5 g of the test substance. The test substance was 
moistened with 0.4 mL of the vehicle and applied to the skin of one flank, using a metalline patch of 
2x3 cm. Four hours after the application, the dressing was removed, and the skin cleaned of residual 
test substance using tap water. The skin reactions were assessed at approximately 1, 24, 48 and 72 
hours after the removal of the dressings and test substance. The irritation scores and a description of 
all other (local) effects were recorded. Adjacent areas of the untreated skin of each animal served as 
controls.

The study was performed in a stepwise manner and was started by treatment of a single rabbit 
(sentinel). Two other animals were treated in a similar manner one week later, after considering the 
degree of skin irritation observed in the first animal. 
After treatment with alpelisib, no evidence of skin irritation or corrosion, and no signs of systemic 
toxicity were observed.  
Other toxicity studies 
In vitro 3T3 NRU Phototoxicity Profiling Assay 
The test was based on the mouse Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast cell line. One group of cells treated with the 
test item was irradiated with artificial sunlight for 50 min. The other group of cells treated with test 
item was kept in the dark for 50 min. After approximately 24 hours recovery the cell culture viability 
was assessed using the Neutral Red Uptake endpoint. The concentration-response curves obtained with 
and without irradiation were compared regarding the two EC50 values (Photo Irritation Factor, PIF) or, 
alternatively, using the solubility limit during incubation as a surrogate. In parallel, the known 
phototoxic compound chlorpromazine was tested. Concentration response curves were obtained for the 
test items with and without irradiation in at least two independent experiments (usually considered 
dose-range finder and main experiment). With or without irradiation, an EC50 of ca. 175 μM was 
determined, which resulted in a photo-irritation factor (PIF) of 1, indicative of the absence of a 
phototoxic potential. 
In Vitro Balb/c 3T3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Assay 
Balb/c 3T3 fibroblast cells seeded into 96 well micro-titre plates were treated with a range of 
concentrations of alpelisib or positive control chemical (Chlorpromazine, CPZ). 
The highest concentration prepared was 1000 μg/mL (the maximum as recommended for this assay, 
according to current regulatory guidelines), however precipitation was noted at concentrations of 316 
and 1000 μg/mL upon addition to Hank’s balanced salt solution (HBSS). Vehicle control (1% anhydrous 
analytical grade dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) in HBSS) treatments, untreated control (HBSS) 
treatments and blanks were also included on each plate. 
Treatment of cultures with alpelisib resulted in a minimal decrease in cell survival, both in the absence 
and in presence of irradiation. The survival curves were generally similar and there were no marked 
differences in neutral red uptake in the presence of irradiation when compared to those in the absence 
of irradiation. The cell survival at the highest non-precipitating concentration analysed (100 μg/mL) 
was more than 50% and hence IC50 and PIF values could not be calculated. Due to the absence of 
cytotoxicity up to the highest nonprecipitating concentrations (316 and 1000 μg/mL) no IC50 values 
(with and without irradiation) and, thus, no PIF values have been calculated. Alpelisib was therefore 
deemed to have no phototoxic potential in this test.  
4-week oral (gavage) investigative skin toxicity study in female Brown Norway rats 
The purpose of this non-GLP study was to investigate the toxicological effects of alpelisib on the skin 
when administered to female Brown Norway (BN) rats for 4 weeks. 50 mg/kg alpelisib was 
administered orally via gavage once daily for 4 weeks to 10 female Brown Norway rats. A 
corresponding control group of 10 female Brown Norway rats received vehicle only at an equivalent 
dose volume (5 mL/kg). 
The 50 mg/kg/day dose was tolerated for the 4 week dosing period. Body weight loss occurred in all of 
the alpelisib-treated rats throughout the dosing period. The most significant haematology changes 
reflected the presence of inflammation (characterized by increases in white blood cell, neutrophil, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 38/174 
 
 
  
 
lymphocyte and monocyte counts, increases in plasma fibrinogen concentrations) and decreased red 
blood cell mass (characterized by decreases in red blood cell count, haemoglobin concentration and 
haematocrit) with an accompanying increase in reticulocyte counts. Other changes were less specific 
including increases in serum ALT and ALP activities, increased serum urea and cholesterol 
concentrations and decreased serum albumin, serum triglyceride concentrations.  
The mean weights of all three lymph nodes (axillary, auricular, and inguinal) were minimally higher 
compared to control animals. 
Clinical signs related to the skin were the only test article-related clinical observations and included 
discolored skin, flakey skin, crusty skin, localized hair loss, scabs, scratches, abrasions, wounds, red 
ears and/or swellings. The onset of these signs was generally after 3 weeks of dosing with continuation 
until necropsy. The lesions were most commonly located on the ears, head, neck and back. 
Test-article-related microscopic findings were observed in the skin and lymph nodes. In the skin, 
findings from the central zone correlated with the clinically and macroscopically observed lesions 
(ulceration/erosions). In the periphery of macroscopic lesions (clinically normal skin), minimal to slight 
hydropic degeneration of basal epithelial cells in hair follicles and the epidermis as well as minimal 
exocytosis were observed. Minimal to slight dermal infiltration of mononuclear cells was observed with 
a perivascular and follicular pattern.  
In samples from the central region of macroscopic lesions, the dermal and follicular infiltrations of 
mostly mononuclear cells were more severe (minimal to marked) and extensive ulceration (slight to 
severe) with fibrinous exudate and crust formation, bacterial colonies and infiltrations of large numbers 
of neutrophilic granulocytes were observed. In addition, there was slight to moderate epidermal 
hyperplasia and hyperkeratosis. Besides the mononuclear cell infiltration, there was also minimal to 
slight proliferation of fibroblasts and minimal dermal oedema. 
Finally, none of the treated animals had anagen hair follicles present in the skin compared to their 
presence in 5 out of 10 control animals. 
In lymph nodes (axillary and inguinal), the incidence of absence of germinal centers was higher in 
treated animals and there was a higher incidence of cortical atrophy. 
Since histopathological examination of the skin samples identified mononuclear cell infiltration in the 
deeper dermis (mostly with a perivascular and follicular pattern), immunohistochemical markers of the 
immune system were used to characterize these infiltrated mononuclear cells. The infiltrating cells 
were mainly CD68+ macrophages, CD163+, T cells (identified by CD3 staining) and CD8+. In the 
macroscopically normal and lesioned skin of BYL719 treated animals, the CD8+ cells were a mix of cells 
with round or elongated shape, suggesting different CD8+ cell subsets.  
BYL719 induced major transcriptional changes in the (dorsal) skin of Brown Norway rats after 4 weeks 
of daily treatment at 50 mg/kg.  Gene expression changes in macroscopically normal and in lesioned 
skin support immunostimulatory effects (e.g. increased expression of various cytokine and chemokine 
genes, up-regulated macrophage activation, NK cell, interferon, MHC class I, and ubiquitin/proteasome 
signatures) as well as skin regenerative processes (e.g. increased activated basal keratinocyte and cell 
division gene signatures). 
In addition to standard procedures used in this study, auricular, inguinal and axillary lymph nodes were 
collected at necropsy for immunophenotyping. Alpelisib increased T cytotoxic cell, atypically-large 
lymphoid cells, NK and NKT cells and monocytes in the lymph nodes of the three regions. Furthermore, 
B cells and some myeloid subsets, including the majority pool of macrophages, dendritic cells and 
granulocytes were also activated in lymph nodes, as detected by increased MHC-II and/or ICAM-
1expression.

Alpelisib-related serum cytokine changes are consistent with skin inflammation and hypersensitivity. 
The earliest mediator increases were seen in fractalkine (a potent immune cell chemoattractant) and 
leptin, which promotes and was followed by increases in MCP-1, IP-10, IL-17, VEGF, IL-18, MIP-1α, 
RANTES, TNFα and IL-12, and decreases in the neutrophil chemoattractant, LIX. 
At the 50 mg/kg/day level, the concentrations of BYL719 in female rat plasma measured for the female 
rats at 2 h post dose on Day 29 was 11.6 µg/ml.

Alpelisib is not a PBT substance. Considering the above data, alpelisib is not expected to pose a risk to 
the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The results of the in vitro studies showed that alpelisib is a specific p110α inhibitor and inhibits the 
effects mediated by this kinase as phosphorylation of AKT and AKT downstream effectors (GSK3β and 
p70S6K). Moreover, alpelisib showed markedly selective efficacy in PIK3CA mutated cell lines when 
compared to will-type cell lines and when compared to pan-PI3K inhibitors. 
In biochemical assays, BZG791, the primary circulating metabolite of alpelisib, was over 500-fold less 
potent than alpelisib on p110α, over 4-fold less potent than alpelisib on the other class I PI3K lipid 
kinases and, similar to alpelisib, BZG791 was not active on Vps34 and mTOR. Mechanistic cell-based 
assays confirmed BZG791 shows no activity on the p110α, p110β and p110δ isoforms. 
Pharmacology in vivo studies supported the higher affinity of alpelisib on p110α observed in in vitro 
experiments and demonstrated its antitumoral activity in relevant breast tumour xenograft models. 
Alpelisib also showed anti-tumoural activity in models of lung, gastric or colorectal cancer with PIK3CA 
mutations or protein tyrosine kinase amplification. 
Secondary pharmacology studies suggest that alpelisib is not likely to have activity against other 
143 GPCRs, transporters, ion channels, nuclear receptors and enzymes in binding assays. 
The PI3K pathway has been shown to play a significant role in glucose metabolism, particularly by 
mediating glucose transport into adipocytes and muscle tissues and in VEGF regulated permeability of 
blood vessels. Insulin resistance, hyperglycaemia, inhibition of VEGF signalling and neovascularisation 
have been associated with alpelisib treatment. 
The impact of treatment with alpelisib on glucose homeostasis was assessed. In mice, insulin plasma 
levels increased proportionally with alpelisib plasma concentrations, while blood glucose levels were 
maintained close to normal up to 20 μmol/L of alpelisib. However, above 20 μmol/L, an alpelisib 
concentration-dependent glucose increase was observed which led to hyperglycaemia despite insulin 
plasma level elevation. In the toxicology studies, alpelisib interfered with glucose/insulin homeostasis 
in all species investigated (mouse, rat and dog) and in both genders. This was evidenced by elevated 
basal plasma insulin and glucose concentrations and increased insulin and glucose excursions after 
glucose or insulin challenges in mice. In rats, insulin and glucose fluctuations were seen, associated 
with fructosamine elevations, which is a marker for prolonged hyperglycaemia, with a similar but less 
prominent effect in dogs. In line with this activity, pancreatic cytoplasmic changes or 
hyperplasia/hypertrophy of the Langerhans islet cells, indicative of cellular activation, were observed in 
mice and rats. In general, peripheral insulin and glucose effects, which occurred at therapeutically 
active plasma exposure levels, were reversible after treatment cessation.

Several stand-alone safety pharmacology studies were provided. Furthermore, cardiovascular system 
safety pharmacology endpoints were incorporated into study designs for the pivotal repeat-dose 
toxicity in dog. This approach is consistent with ICH S9.  
In vitro inhibition of hERG channels (IC50 of 9.4 µM) was shown at concentrations ~13-fold higher than 
the exposure in humans, at the recommended dose of 300 mg/day. No relevant electrophysiological 
effect was seen in dogs (see SmPC section 5.3).  
Based on the available results, it is considered that there is a negligible risk of an electrophysiological 
effect of alpelisib. However, alpelisib caused an increase in blood pressure and a persistent decrease in 
average heart rate. In addition, an inhibition of the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) signalling 
pathway has been identified as another cause of drug-induced long QT syndrome via an inhibition of 
cardiac potassium currents (IKr, IKs) and an increase of the cardiac late sodium current (Lu et al. 
2012, Yang et al. 2014; reviews in Ballou et al. 2015, Cohen et al. 2017). Nevertheless, given the 
absence of (non)clinical evidence of QTc interval prolongation further studies to assess the effect of 
alpelisib on additional cardiac ion channels and its potential to induce Torsades de Pointes (TdP) 
cardiac arrhythmias are not required. 
Alpelisib administered to male Wistar rats at a single oral dose of 80 mg/kg did not induce 
toxicologically significant effects on the nervous or respiratory system. 
Considering the wide role of the PI3K pathway, both as part of oncogenic development but also as a 
potential mechanism of resistance to several therapies used as standard of care; alpelisib has been 
explored in combination with several other targeted therapies such as EGFR inhibitors or CDK 
inhibitors, endocrine therapies or various cytotoxic therapies, such cisplatin or radiation. In breast 
cancer models, non-clinical studies were conducted with alpelisib in combination with the aromatase 
inhibitor letrozole, the ER antagonist fulvestrant, the CDK4/6 inhibitor ribociclib, the anti-HER2 therapy 
trastuzumab, and the mTOR inhibitor. In all cases the combination of alpelisib and other therapeutic 
agent was superior to single-agent treatment (data not shown). 
The combination of alpelisib with fulvestrant showed to be more effective than the monotherapy in ER+ 
breast cancer cell line xenografts with PIK3CA mutation (MCF7, KPL1, and T47D) or PTEN-null 
(ZR751), in a PDX model of ER+ PIK3CA mutant breast cancer where the patient had progressed on 
multiple lines of endocrine therapy, including fulvestrant, in ER+ breast cancer cell line xenografts 
progressing on everolimus (mTORC1) or CDK4/6 inhibitor (palbociclib or ribociclib/LEE011) treatments. 
Despite differences in tumour volumes between fulvestrant and combination groups were not always 
statistically significant, the clinical relevance of these differences have been already investigated in the 
pivotal phase III clinical trial. Regarding the safety, body weight loss (<10%) were observed with the 
single agent or combination treatment in all treated animals.  
Pharmacokinetic behaviour of alpelisib was investigated in mouse, rat, dog and human. The similarities 
in the in vitro and in vivo pharmacokinetic profile between rat, dog and human support the adequacy 
of these species for toxicological assessment of alpelisib. 
Based on the results of metabolic in vitro induction and inhibition studies, alpelisib may induce the 
metabolic clearance of co-administered medicinal products metabolised by CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A 
and may inhibit the metabolic clearance of co-administered medicinal products metabolised by 
CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 (time-dependent inhibition) if sufficiently high concentrations 
are achieved in vivo (see SmPC section 4.5). In the absence of clinical data on CYP2C9, caution is 
recommended regarding CYP2C9 substrates with narrow therapeutic index. In vitro evaluations 
indicated that the pharmacological activity of CYP2C9 substrates with a narrow therapeutic index such 
as warfarin may be reduced by the CYP2C9 induction effects of alpelisib. Furthermore, sensitive 
CYP2B6 substrates (e.g. bupropion) or CYP2B6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window should be

used with caution in combination with Piqray, as alpelisib may reduce the clinical activity of such 
medicinal products. (see SmPC section 4.5).  
Inhibition of CYP2C8 by alpelisib at clinically relevant concentrations can be discarded based on the 
result of a clinical trial that showed that the PK of paclitaxel (a CYP2C8 substrate) was unaffected by 
alpelisib (see clinical pharmacology). 
Since alpelisib is an inducer and an inhibitor of CYP3A4, the effect of alpelisib on CYP3A4 enzymes was 
investigated by both a clinical DDI study and PBPK simulations and it was concluded that no dose 
adjustment is required when co-administering Piqray with CYP3A4 substrates (see clinical 
pharmacology and SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.5). 
Alpelisib is a substrate of BCRP (Km = 2-15 μM) and a very weak substrate of P-gp (Km > 128 μM) in 
vitro. BCRP is involved in the hepatobiliary export and intestinal secretion of alpelisib, therefore 
inhibition of BCRP in the liver and in the intestine during elimination may lead to an increase in 
systemic exposure of alpelisib. Therefore, caution and monitoring for toxicity are advised during 
concomitant treatment with inhibitors of BCRP (e.g. eltrombopag, lapatinib, pantoprazole) (see SmPC 
section 4.5). 
Alpelisib showed only weak in vitro inhibition towards the ubiquitously expressed efflux transporters 
(P-gp, BCRP, MRP2, BSEP), solute carrier transporters at the liver inlet (OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OCT1) 
and solute carrier transporters in the kidney (OAT1, OCT2, MATE1, MATE2K). As unbound systemic 
steady-state concentrations (or concentrations at the liver inlet) at both the therapeutic dose and 
maximum tolerated dose are significantly lower than the experimentally determined unbound inhibition 
constants or IC50, the inhibition will not translate into clinical significance. Due to high alpelisib 
concentrations in the intestinal lumen, an effect on intestinal P-gp and BCRP cannot be fully excluded. 
Considering the concentration of alpelisib in kidneys, inhibition of the renal organic anion transporter 
OAT3 by alpelisib (and/or its metabolite BZG791) cannot be discarded in patients at the therapeutic 
dose (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Considering alpelisib (and/or its metabolite BZG791) has a potential to inhibit the activities of OAT3 
drug transporters and intestinal BCRP and P-gp, Piqray should be used with caution in combination 
with sensitive substrates of these transporters which exhibit a narrow therapeutic index because Piqray 
may increase the exposure of these substrates (see SmPC section 4.5). 
The toxicity of alpelisib after repeated oral administration was studied in rats and dogs with dosing up 
to 13 weeks. The pharmacodynamic target and the major pathways of alpelisib metabolism in humans 
were all represented in these species. Thus, the choice of rats, and dogs was appropriate for the 
toxicity evaluation of alpelisib. The design of the studies followed the ICH requirements in terms of 
duration, number of animals, doses, route and frequency of administration. 
In the rat and dog repeated-dose toxicity studies, hematopoietic, lymphopoietic, reproductive and 
gastrointestinal systems, glucose and lipid metabolisms, skin, adnexal tissues, teeth, bones, kidneys 
and eyes were identified as systems affected by treatment with alpelisib. Despite effects on lipid and 
glycogen metabolism would be expected by inhibition of the signal transduction pathway of insulin, 
disturbances in the lipid metabolism were not associated to alpelisib treatment in clinical studies. 
Additionally, degenerative effects observed in the incisors of rats can be considered rodent-specific 
with limited relevance for humans since teeth are permanently growing in rats, but not in humans. 
Overall, the majority of the observed alpelisib effects were related to the pharmacological activity of 
alpelisib as a p110α-specific inhibitor of the PI3K pathway, such as the influence on the glucose 
homeostasis resulting in hyperglycaemia and the risk of increased blood pressure. The bone marrow 
and lymphoid tissue, pancreas and some reproductive organs of both genders were the main target 
organs for adverse effects. Effects on bone marrow and lymphoid tissue were generally reversible on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 43/174 
 
 
  
 
cessation of treatment. Effects on the pancreas and reproductive organs did not fully reverse but 
showed a tendency towards reversion (see SmPC section 5.3). 
All effects were observed at doses that resulted in total plasma exposure levels lower than those 
reached in patients treated with the maximum recommended dose and were reversible or showed a 
tendency towards reversibility after a 4- or 8-week treatment-free recovery period. 
A NOAEL of 10 mg/kg/day is not considered sufficiently supported by the current findings in the 4 
week repeated dose study in rats due to the effects seen at this dose level, i.e. decrease in body 
weight gain; mild to moderate decrease in eosinophiles and basophiles, mild decrease in haematocrit 
and haemoglobin levels; increased glucose, Cl and K; decreased organ weight of spleen, thymus and 
uterus; several dose-related microscopic organ changes. The NOAEL of 2 mg/kg/day derived from the 
13-week study is supported. No adverse events were reported at this dose level. 
The main human metabolite, BZG791, was measured in 4 weeks toxicity studies in rats and dogs. Rat 
and dog exposure to metabolite BZG791 was 1.5 and 0.6 folds respectively human exposure. 
According to the ICH S9 guideline a separate evaluation of the metabolites is generally not warranted 
for patients with advanced cancer. Therefore, the metabolite is considered characterised from the non-
clinical point of view. 
Genotoxicity studies in agreement with ICH S2 (R1) guidance have been submitted, including test for 
gene mutations, chromosomal aberrations in vitro and an in vivo micronucleus assay integrated in the 
13-week oral repeated-dose study in the rat.  
Alpelisib was not mutagenic in a Salmonella reverse mutation test, or aneugenic or clastogenic in 
human cell micronucleus and chromosome aberration tests in vitro. In vivo, after 4 weeks of oral 
treatment up to 20 mg/kg/day in rats and clear signs of bone marrow toxicity, alpelisib did not induce 
an increase of micronuclei in peripheral blood reticulocytes. However, it should be noted that the value 
of the these studies is limited since the concentrations of alpelisib used in in vitro studies were lower 
than those required in the ICH S2 guideline and systemic exposures to alpelisib achieved in the in vivo 
study were only 2 fold or 1.4 fold higher than therapeutic exposure in adult humans. Therefore, the 
genotoxicity potential of alpelisib in human cannot be ruled out (see SmPC section 5.3). 
According to the specifications, impurity levels are below the qualification thresholds defined in ICH 
Q3A and ICH Q3B. However, several identified impurities were evaluated in the Ames test as well as 
referenced from published literature (data not shown). Only four studies on genotoxic potential of 
impurities were conducted in compliance with GLP. Three of the impurities were tested positive in the 
non-GLP AMES tests and three impurities were tested negative. However, the tested impurities are 
either not detectable in the drug substance or controlled via a purging step in the manufacturing 
process, which ensures amounts of less than 25 ppm for mutagenic impurities at drug substance level 
based on a treatment duration of up to 10 years and a maximum daily dose of 400 mg alpelisib. 
Hence, the non-GLP Ames tests are accepted in support of the genotoxic testing of alpelisib. 
The applicant justified the lack of carcinogenicity studies according to the ICH S9 guideline. This is 
considered acceptable also acknowledging that no genotoxic potential has been identified for alpelisib 
and no hyperproliferative or neoplastic changes were observed in the repeat-dose toxicity studies of up 
to 13 weeks duration.  
Absorption studies with alpelisib showed absorption between 290 – 700 nm (peak at 314 nm) with a 
molar extinction coefficient above the guideline limit of 1000 L/mol/cm (i.e. 1880 L/mol/cm). However, 
as two in vitro 3T3 NRU phototoxicity tests (OECD TG432, non-GLP/GLP) did not identify a relevant 
phototoxicity potential for alpelisib, alpelisib is not considered phototoxic (see SmPC section 5.3).

A fertility study in rats has not been performed. However, in repeated dose toxicity studies, adverse 
effects were observed in reproductive organs, such as vaginal or uterine atrophy and oestrus cycle 
variations in rats, decreases in prostate and testes weight in rats and dogs and prostate atrophy in 
dogs at clinically relevant doses based on AUC . Based on these results, alpelisib may impair fertility in 
males and females of reproductive potential (see SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3). 
As per ICH S9, pre-and postnatal and juvenile toxicology studies are generally not warranted to 
support marketing of pharmaceuticals for the treatment of patients with advanced cancer. 
Embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits have demonstrated that oral administration of 
alpelisib during organogenesis induced embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity and teratogenicity. In rats and 
rabbits, following prenatal exposure to alpelisib, increased incidences of pre- and post-implantation 
losses, reduced foetal weights and increased incidences of foetal abnormalities (enlarged brain 
ventricle, decreased bone ossification and skeletal malformations) were observed starting at exposures 
below those in humans at the highest recommended dose of 300 mg, indicating potential clinical 
relevance (see SmPC section 5.3).  
The environmental risk assessment does not indicate a potential risk to the environment. Any unused 
medicinal product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements (see 
SmPC section 6.6). 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical data package evaluating the pharmacology and toxicity of alpelisib is considered 
acceptable to support the marketing authorisation.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Analytical methods 
The concentrations of alpelisib (BYL719) and its primary metabolite (BZG791) in human K3EDTA 
plasma were measured using LC-MS/MS method over the calibration range of 1.00 to 1000 ng/mL. In 
addition, alpelisib was measured with a higher validated range from 5.00 to 5000 ng/mL and was 
validated in Li-Heparin as anticoagulant. 
The bioanalytical methods consist of protein precipitation and analysis of the reconstituted sample by 
LC-MS/MS in Multiple Reaction Monitoring mode using Electron Spray Ionization as the ionization 
technique.  
A total of seven methods were developed, validated and used throughout the clinical development of 
alpelisib. 
Because different methods were used to measure the concentration of alpelisib, several cross-validations 
between methods were performed. Based on the results, all validated analytical methods can be used 
for quantitative determination of BYL719 in human plasma samples.

Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
As subjects in the three healthy subject studies were exposed to different formulations (capsule 
formulation in the mass balance study), food conditions (fasted vs. fed), and/or co-administrations 
(acid reducing agents), no healthy subject data were pooled.  
Data from patients with cancer (simplified as “Phase I pool”) were pooled from single agent Phase I 
Study X2101 and Study X1101 for PK characterization, population PK analysis, and exposure-response 
analysis. Only single agent data or combination data with fulvestrant that reflected the recommended 
dosing regimen and conditions of administration, i.e. once daily regimen under fed conditions, were 
included in the pooled dataset. The Phase I pool was analysed separately from Study C2301 Phase III 
data given the difference in the indication, study population (line of therapy), and treatment (majority 
of Phase I cancer subjects received monotherapy as well as limited number of cancer subjects who 
received combination at the 300 mg). 
Based on the Phase 1 model, another Pop PK model was developed to describe alpelisib PK in the 
Phase 3 study SOLAR-1, where alpelisib were co-administered with fulvestrant. The final Phase 3 
model included only statistically significant covariates for weight and age.

A PBPK model for alpelisib was built in GastroPlus encompassing the advanced compartment and 
transit absorption model linked to patient and healthy subject PK for prediction of food effect, effect of 
ranitidine and investigating the absorption kinetics of alpelisib. Sensitivity analysis showed that pH in 
the stomach and intestines have major impact on alpelisib absorption which seems to be limited by 
solubility. Absorption was increased in presence of food due to excretion of bile salts and decreased in 
presence of pH-altering agents.

Linear mixed models were used to describe the relationship between change in QTcP, QTcF or HR to 
alpelisib concentration with or without fulvestrant.  
Absorption  
Bioavailability 
No bioavailability study in humans was performed which is acceptable (see discussion on clinical 
pharmacology). The oral absorption and bioavailability of alpelisib was characterised using data from 
other clinical and non-clinical studies and supported by a GastroPlus absorption model.  
Oral bioavailability in non-clinical species was moderate (~57%) in rats after suspension dosing and 
complete (≥ 100%) in mice and dogs after a single dose of alpelisib as a solution. Absorption of 14C 
alpelisib and/or metabolites was 63% in the rat ADME, indicating that absorption is a good measure of 
oral bioavailability.  
Absorption in humans under fasted conditions was assessed in the human mass balance Study X2107. 
Following oral administration of alpelisib, median time to reach peak plasma concentration (Tmax) 
ranged between 2.0 to 4.0 hours, independent of dose, time or regimen. Based on the recovery of the 
radioactivity in urine and the radioactivity assigned to metabolites in faeces, the absorption of alpelisib 
was at least 53.5% in the fasted state after a 400 mg single dose. This is in line with PBPK simulations 
that showed a predicted fraction absorbed of a single dose of 400 mg of alpelisib under fasted 
conditions was 60.7%. The observed magnitude of the food effect, however, indicates that absorption 
after a meal in the fed state is very high.  
Based on PBPK absorption modelling, in the absence of an absolute bioavailability study, absorption 
was estimated to be very high (>99%) under fed condition but lower under fasted conditions (~68.7% 
at a 300 mg dose). Steady-state plasma levels of alpelisib after daily dosing can be expected to be 
reached on day 3 following onset of therapy in most patients (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Based on the preclinical results suggesting a limited first path effect as well as data from the human 
mass balance study, the absolute bioavailability is expected to be moderate to high depending on the 
food status, close to the absorption fraction. 
The ADME study showed that alpelisib was almost equally distributed in plasma and blood. 
Furthermore, the data indicated that there was no accumulation of metabolites, as the total 
radioactivity declined in parallel with the radioactivity attributed to alpelisib (Figure 10).

Bioequivalence 
Based on the interim CSR of Study A2109, bioequivalence was demonstrated between Formulation D 
(clinical formulation) and Formulation E (commercial formulation) at the highest tablet strength of 
alpelisib (200 mg) in both the fed state (Cohort 1, full results submitted) and the fasted state (Cohort 
2, interim results submitted). The point estimates of the geometric mean ratios between formulations 
D and E in fed or in fasted state and the corresponding 90% CI of alpelisib exposure metrics were all 
within the predefined bioequivalence boundary (0.80, 1.25). In the fed state, the inter- and intra-
subject variability was low with a CV% of 9.9% for AUCinf, 10.3% for AUClast, and 18.7% for Cmax 
(N=24).

(Pharmacokinetic analysis set) 
The mean concentration-time profiles were slightly shifted between treatments independent of food 
status. This had no effect on exposure. The median Tmax was 2.5 h for formulation D and 3 h for 
formulation E in the fed state.  
Data from food-interaction studies  
Food effect was studied in 2 studies: A2103 and X1101. The data from both the formal single-dose food 
effect study (Study A2103) as well as the exploratory steady-state food effect expansion arm conducted 
in Japanese subjects with cancer (Study X1101) showed that exposure (AUCinf) is significantly increased 
when alpelisib is administered after a meal (see Table 18). 
Table 18: Summary of statistical analysis of dose-normalized AUClast, AUC0-24 and Cmax by 
food condition (study X1101) 
In study A2103, in healthy volunteers after a single 300 mg oral dose of alpelisib, compared to the 
fasted state, a high-fat high-calorie (HFHC) meal (985 calories with 58.1 g of fat) increased AUCinf by 
73% and Cmax by 84%, and a LFLC meal (334 calories with 8.7 g of fat) increased AUCinf by 77% and 
Cmax by 145%. No significant difference was found for AUCinf between LFLC and HFHC with a geometric

mean ratio of 0.978 (CI: 0.876, 1.09), showing that neither fat content nor overall calorific intake has 
a considerable impact on absorption.  
Alpelisib was administered concomitantly with ranitidine, a H2-receptor antagonist, with a low fat low 
calorie meal in study A2103 (see section on interaction studies). Under fasted condition, ranitidine co-
administered two hours prior to alpelisib administration led to a reduction of both AUCinf and Cmax, by 
approximately 30% and 51%, respectively, and 0.48 hours median delay in Tmax compared to 
alpelisib alone in fasted condition. In the fed condition (LFLC), ranitidine co-administration led to a 
reduction of both AUCinf and Cmax, by approximately 21% and 36%, respectively, and 0.47 hours 
median delay in Tmax compared to alpelisib alone in fasted condition. 
Distribution 
Alpelisib moderately binds to protein with a free fraction of 10.8% regardless of concentration. Alpelisib 
was equally distributed between red blood cells and plasma with a mean in vivo blood to plasma ratio 
of 1.03. As alpelisib is a substrate of human efflux transporters, penetration of the blood brain barrier 
is not expected to occur in humans. The volume of distribution of alpelisib at steady state (Vss/F) is 
estimated at 114 litres (intersubject CV% 46%) (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Elimination 
Alpelisib exhibits low clearance with 9.2 l/h (CV% 21%) based on population pharmacokinetic analysis 
under fed conditions. The population derived half-life, independent of dose and time, was 8 to 9 hours 
at steady state with 300 mg once daily. 
Excretion 
In a human mass-balance study, after oral administration, alpelisib and its metabolites were excreted 
in the faeces (81.0%), mainly through hepatobiliary export and/or intestinal secretion of alpelisib, or 
metabolised to BZG791. Excretion in the urine is minor (13.5%), with unchanged alpelisib (2%). 
Following a single oral dose of [14C]-alpelisib, 94.5% of the total administered radioactive dose was 
recovered within 8 days. 
Metabolism 
In vitro studies demonstrated that formation of the hydrolysis metabolite BZG791 by chemical and 
enzymatic amide hydrolysis was a major metabolic pathway, followed by minor contribution of CYP3A4. 
The overall contribution of CYP3A-mediatived oxidative metabolism is low with an estimated fraction 
metabolized (fm CYP3A4) of ~12%. Contribution of glucuronidation was negligible with overall liver-
mediated metabolism (CYP mediated Phase I and Phase II metabolism together) contributing to ≤ 15% 
of the elimination. Alpelisib hydrolysis occurs systemically by both chemical decomposition and 
enzymatic hydrolysis via ubiquitously expressed, high-capacity enzymes (esterases, amidases, choline 
esterase) not limited to the liver. CYP3A4-mediated metabolites and glucuronides amounted to ~15% 
of the dose; BZG791 accounted for ~40-45% of the dose. The rest of the absorbed fraction of the dose 
was excreted as alpelisib.

Figure 11: Biotransformation pathways of alpelisib in healthy human subjects 
Pharmacokinetics of metabolites 
The pharmacokinetics of the pharmacologically inactive metabolite BZG791 show that it is a formation-
rate limited metabolite unlikely to accumulate extensively in circulating plasma due to its short 
apparent half-life. Formation of BZG791 occurs by systemic metabolism via ubiquitously expressed 
high-capacity enzymes. As hydrolysis occurs extra-hepatically, the metabolism can compensate for the 
loss of liver metabolism and/or transport in severe liver impairment. 
Genetic polymorphism 
No studies investigating the impact of genetic polymorphism on PK were provided which is acceptable 
(see discussion on clinical pharmacology).  
Dose Proportionality and Time-dependency 
The pharmacokinetics were found to be linear with respect to dose and time under fed conditions 
between 30 and 450 mg. After multiple doses, alpelisib exposure (AUC) at steady state is only slightly 
higher than that of a single dose, with an average accumulation of 1.3 to 1.5 with a daily dosing 
regimen.

Intra- and inter individual variability 
The inter- and intra-subject variability were higher in cancer subjects (CV% 32.8 to 46.8 %) than in 
healthy subjects and were also higher in patients treated concomitantly with fulvestrant (23%-56.9%) 
than with alpelisib alone. In the fasted state in healthy subject, the inter-subject variability was higher 
than when alpelisib was taken with food.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
Pharmacokinetic data from Phase I trials Study X1101 and Study X2101 was used for population PK 
modelling to characterise the pharmacokinetics of alpelisib when administered as a single agent and in 
combination with fulvestrant and to obtain key exposure metrics AUC, Cmin and Cmax). The Phase I 
population PK model was used as a basis to analyze PK concentration data from Study C2301. 
However, minor adjustment to the model were made to reflect the Phase III data such as exclusion of 
the comparison between single agent and combination data as well as the gender effect (as only 1 
male subject provided PK information). Covariate search was confined to covariates that were found 
significant in the Phase I model. 
Final Phase I Population PK Model 
As for the base model, a one-compartment model with a delayed first-order absorption and linear 
elimination was selected as the final model (Model 71). Inter-individual variability was implemented on 
KA, CL and V. The allometric parameters for CL and V were estimated lower than the fixed values of 
0.75 and 1, respectively. CL was influenced by fulvestrant coadministration, gender and age, while V 
was influenced by fulvestrant coadministration and patients of Japanese ethnicity.

Similar to the Phase I model, a one-compartment model with a delayed first-order absorption and 
linear elimination was selected as the final model for SOLAR-1 (Model 11). Inter-individual variability 
was implemented on CL and V. The allometric parameter for CL was estimated to be slightly higher 
than that in Phase I, while the allometric parameters for V was the same. 
Beside the effect of body weight, age was the only covariate in the model; influencing CL in a similar 
manner to that of Phase I. Effects of ethnicity (Japanese or Hispanics) were found to be not significant

and thus were not kept in the final model. There was no evidence of effects due to renal or hepatic 
impairment, or due to acid reducing agents.

Special populations 
Impaired renal function 
Renal impairment was assessed by means of population PK analysis based on creatinine clearance at 
baseline. The Phase I pharmacokinetic analysis set included 151 (61.9%) subjects with normal renal 
function based on creatinine clearance (CLcr ≥90 mL/min), 72 (29.5%) subjects with mild renal 
impairment (CLcr 60 to <90 mL/min), 20 (8.2%) subjects with moderate renal impairment (CLcr 30 to 
<60 mL/min) and 1 (0.4%) subject with severe renal impairment (CLcr <30 mL/min) (Phase I PopPK 
Report). The Phase III data sets included 117 (43.2%) cancer subjects with normal renal function, 108 
(39.9%) cancer subjects with mild renal impairment, and 45 (16.6%) cancer subjects with moderate 
renal impairment (Phase III PopPK Report). During covariate search, no evidence of an effect by the 
degree of renal impairment on clearance or volume was found in either analyses. 
Impaired hepatic function 
In study A2105, a phase 1, open-label, single-dose, multicenter, parallel group study to assess the 
pharmacokinetics and safety of alpelisib (BYL719) in subjects with hepatic impairment compared to 
matched healthy control subjects, Cmax for alpelisib decreased by approximately 17% for moderate 
hepatic impairment vs. healthy control group. For the severe hepatic impairment group, Cmax was 
comparable relative to the healthy control group. AUClast for alpelisib decreased by approximately 
27% for moderate hepatic impairment vs. healthy control group. For the severe hepatic impairment 
group, AUClast was 26% higher compared with the healthy control group. Values of AUCinf were

similar to those of AUClast across hepatic groups. Cmax for the metabolite, BZG791, was comparable 
in moderate hepatic impairment vs. healthy control group. For the severe hepatic impairment group, 
Cmax increased by 74%. AUClast for BZG791 decreased by approximately 12% for moderate hepatic 
impairment vs. healthy control group. It increased by 145% for severe hepatic impairment vs. healthy 
control group. Values of AUCinf were similar to those of AUClast across hepatic groups. The metabolic 
ratio of BZG791 was also increased (geometric mean of 0.472 [range: 0.323 to 0.580]) in subjects 
with severe hepatic impairment compared with subjects in the healthy control and moderate hepatic 
impairment group. 
Gender 
The impact of gender on the pharmacokinetics of alpelisib was evaluated with a population PK 
approach. Due to pivotal Study C2301 encompassing primarily females (one male was enrolled), the 
assessment was based on the Phase I population PK model. The analysis included 52 (21.2%) males 
and 193 (78.8%) females from studies X1101 and X2101 single agent and fulvestrant combination 
data. In the final model, males had a 35% higher clearance (CL) compared to females, leading to a 
reduction in AUC by 25% compared to a female with the same covariates. 
Race 
The impact of ethnicity was assessed by population means in the Phase I pool and Phase III data. 
The Phase I data set included 25 subjects (10%) of Japanese ethnicity. The model estimated that 
Japanese subjects had a lower total volume by about 27% compared to non-Japanese subjects, 
causing an effect on Cmin and Cmax but not AUC (since clearance is not altered). It was estimated 
that Cmin was lower by 35% and Cmax higher by 19%. In addition, the PK parameters estimated by 
NCA methods and Ctrough summarized from the Phase I pool for monotherapy were formally 
compared for Japanese and non-Japanese by dose level and visit. While there was a trend towards a 
greater exposure (particular for Cmax), smaller Ctrough and shorter elimination half-life based on 
geometric mean and median values for Japanese vs. non-Japanese subjects, the magnitude of changes 
were not significant across PK parameters. 
The impact of ethnicity found in the Phase I popPK analysis was tested in the Phase III population PK 
model and was not found to be significant. 
Weight 
The impact of weight on the pharmacokinetics of alpelisib was evaluated with a population PK 
approach. In the Phase I data set, 90% of the subjects had a baseline body weight between 49-95 kg 
with a population median body weight at baseline equal to 66.75 kg. The final model assessed the 
effect of weight on clearance and volume to be small. Compared to the typical subject weighing 66.75 
kg, for a subject weighing 50 or 95 kg, CL was estimated to be lower by 9% or higher by 11%, 
respectively. Based on these estimates, compared to 66.75 kg, for the weight range of 50-90 kg, 
exposure ranges were: Cmin: +5% to -5%, Cmax: +13% to -12% and of AUC: +10% to -10%. 
In the Phase III data set, 90% of the subjects had a baseline body weight between 48-98 kg with a 
population median body weight at baseline equal to 67.2 kg. The final model assessed the effect of 
weight on clearance and volume to be small. Compared to the typical subject weighing 67 kg, for a 
subject weighing 50 or 90 kg, CL was estimated to be lower by 17% or higher by 20%, respectively. 
Volume was estimated to be lower by 14% or higher by 16%, respectively. Based on these estimates, 
compared to 67 kg, for the weight range of 50-90 kg, exposure ranges were: Cmin: +24% to -20%, 
Cmax: +18% to -16% and of AUC: +20% to -17%.

The effect of age was assessed by population mean PK parameter values from the Phase I pool and 
Phase III data. The Phase I data set included subjects with baseline age ranging from 21 to 82 years 
for a median of 58 years (90% range: 39-76). Based on the final model age decreased CL by only 6% 
for subjects 10 years older than average with no effect on volume. Thus, a 78-year-old subject was 
estimated to have a lower CL (or higher AUC) of about 12%. In addition, the PK parameters estimated 
by NCA methods and Ctrough summaries in the Phase I pool were formally compared based on age 
categories (<65 years or ≥ 65 years) by dose level and visit for monotherapy and in combination with 
fulvestrant. The results showed no significant difference on PK parameters or Ctrough for either 
monotherapy or combinations, respectively, based on geometric mean and median values. The Phase 
III data set included subjects with baseline age ranging from 25 to 87 years for a median of 62 years 
(90% range: 46-79). Based on the final model age decreased CL by 5% for subjects 10 years older 
than average with no effect on volume.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
In silico 
Effect of CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers on the Pharmacokinetics of Alpelisib 
CYP3A4 is the predominant enzyme involved in the metabolism of alpelisib, however the overall 
contribution of CYP3A metabolism was considered low with an estimated fraction metabolized (fm) of 
12%. The fm via CYP3A4 of 0.12 was established based on the oxidative metabolites identified in the 
human ADME study (CBYL719X2107).  
Based on a PBPK model for alpelisib created with the SimCYP software simulations with the strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir and strong CYP3A4 inducer rifampin were conducted in lieu of a clinical study 
to assess the risk of an interaction. An exposure change at steady-state in terms of AUC was predicted 
as 1.16-fold [1.11; 1.21] and 0.84-fold [0.80; 0.87] with an oral administration of alpelisib at MTD 
(400 mg once daily) in the presence of ritonavir (100 mg b.i.d) and rifampicin (600 mg once daily), 
respectively.  
Model sensitivity of fraction metabolized by CYP3A4 (fm CYP3A4) for alpelisib was investigated in the 
range between 0.125 and 0.207. The highest observed changes of alpelisib AUC were observed for the 
highest investigated fm, CYP3A4 of 0.207 with simulated AUC ratios of 1.27 with ritonavir and 0.75 
with rifampicin.  
Effect of alpelisib on the Pharmacokinetics of CYP2C9 substrates with narrow therapeutic window 
As alpelisib led to a concentration-dependent induction of CYP2C9 in vitro, PBPK simulations were 
carried out to assess the in vivo risk of an interaction with a CYP2C9 substrate, with a narrow 
Assessment report

therapeutic window index, in lieu of a clinical study. After co-administration of alpelisib (300 mg p.o., 
once daily for 20 days), AUC and Cmax ratios of warfarin (10 mg p.o., single dose at day 8) were 
estimated to be 0.91 and 0.99, respectively, indicating little to no induction potential of alpelisib on 
CYP2C9 (see Table 22).  
The PBPK modeling platform was not fully validated to predict the induction potential on CYP2C9 due to 
lack of clinical reference data. A sensitivity analysis on the CYP2C9 induction parameters IndC50 (range: 
0.1 – 20 μM) and Indmax (range: 1 – 20) showed a maximal warfarin (10 mg) AUC change of 0.2 when 
co-administered with alpelisib (300 mg).  
Effect of alpelisib on the Pharmacokinetics of CYP3A4 substrates 
DDI simulation was performed to explore the effect of alpelisib on the everolimus PK at steady-state 
(Table 22). No or only slight increase of everolimus AUC and Cmax at the last dose after oral 
administration of 2.5 mg q.d. for 15 days was predicted with co-administration of alpelisib (250 and 
300 mg p.o., q.d. for 15 days) (see Table 22). 
Table 22: Simulated DDI effects of alpelisib on the systemic exposures of everolimus and 
warfarin 
For  midazolam,  the  simulated  AUC  and  Cmax  change  (2  mg  p.o.,  single  dose  at  Day  8)  with 
coadministration of alpelisib (400 mg p.o., q.d. for 15 days) was estimated to 1.19-fold and 1.04-fold 
(geometric  mean),  respectively.  On  the  contrary,  when  applying  the  alpelisib  model  with  the  time-
dependent inhibition only or only the induction effect on CYP3A4, the predicted midazolam AUC ratio was 
6.48-fold  and  0.10-fold,  respectively.  The  predictions  indicate  that  the  TDI  potential  of  alpelisib  is 
balanced with a strong induction effect, resulting in a net in vivo DDI potential of alpelisib as a weak 
perpetrator. 
Changes of the systemic exposures after oral administration of rifampicin (600 mg once daily), ribociclib 
(400 and 600 mg once daily) and ritonavir (100 and 600 mg once daily) in the absence and presence of 
co-administration of alpelisib (300 or 400 mg p.o., once daily) were simulated. Rifampicin and ritonavir 
are known as strong auto-inducer and -inhibitor of CYP3A4, respectively, whereas ribociclib is a weak 
auto-inhibitor of CYP3A4. The AUC and Cmax ratio of alpelisib (400 mg p.o., q.d. for 7 days) over oral 
administration ritonavir or rifampicin was predicted to be 1.16-fold and 1.09-fold for ritonavir and 0.84-
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020

fold and 0.91-fold for rifampicin, respectively. Based on the Simcyp simulation, no clinical relevant effects 
are expected after simulations of alpelisib 300 mg qd for 7 days administered with or without ritonavir, 
rifampicin or ribociclib. 
Effect of Alpelisib on the Pharmacokinetics of CYP2B6 substrates 
Due to the difficulties with the induction predictability by PBPK modeling, only static mechanistic 
assessments were carried out. With sensitive CYP2B6 substrates, such as the antidepressant 
bupropion, a reduction of exposure by up to 3-fold can be expected when co-administered with 
alpelisib based on this conservative assessment due to the observed induction of CYP2B6 by alpelisib in 
vitro. 
In vivo 
Interaction with CYP3A4 inducers (encorafenib) 
The pharmacokinetics of alpelisib in the presence of increasing doses of encorafenib, a strong inducer 
of CYP3A4 have been assessed in a clinical Phase Ib study (NCT01719380). At 300 mg at steady state, 
mean Cmax were 2743 ± 520 ng/mL and AUC0-24 was 25126 ± 3513 h×ng/mL when co-administered 
with 200 mg encorafenib (van Geel et al 2017), which was comparable to levels of single agent. 
Interaction with CYP3A4 substrate (everolimus) 
Study Z2102, a phase Ib dose-finding study of alpelisib plus everolimus and alpelisib plus everolimus 
plus  exemestane  in  patients  with  advanced  solid  tumors,  with  dose-expansion  cohorts  in  renal  cell 
cancer,  pancreatic  neuroendocrine  tumors  and  advanced  breast  cancer  patients  investigated  whether 
alpelisib affected everolimus PK and determined the magnitude of the drug-drug-interaction. 
In the presence of alpelisib at doses of either 250 mg or 300 mg after 1 week of co-administration (Cycle 
1 Day 15) and after 3 weeks of co-administration (Cycle 2 Day 1) pharmacokinetics of a 2.5 mg dose of 
everolimus were largely unchanged on average to those observed at Day 7. Geometric mean Cmax was 
18.4 ng/ml and 19.3 ng/ml in the 250 mg alpelisib and 300 mg alpelisib treatment groups at Cycle 1 
Day 15, respectively, and 18.7 ng/ml and 13.0 ng/ml at Cycle 2 Day 1. The geometric mean of AUCtau 
(or AUClast) was found to be comparable at Cycle 1 Day 15 with 144 ng×hr/ml and 147 ng×hr/ml in the 
250 mg alpelisib and 300 mg alpelisib treatment groups, respectively, but slightly lower after 3 weeks 
of concomitant administration at Cycle 2 Day 1 independent of the alpelisib dose, with 110 ng×hr/ml 
and 108 ng×hr/ml. The concentration-time profiles of everolimus are shown in Figure 11-3 on Cycle 1 
days 7 and 15 and Cycle 2 day 1. 
The  effect  of  alpelisib  (as  both  an  inducer  and  time–dependent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A)  on  primary  PK 
parameters for everolimus was also assessed by statistical analysis using a linear mixed effect model. 
For Cycle 1 Day 15 (everolimus+alpelisib), Cmax geometric mean increased by 12% compared to Cycle 
1 Day 7 (everolimus alone). AUCtau geometric mean for Cycle 1 Day 15 was in the same range as Cycle 
1 Day 7 and decreased by 11.2% for Cycle 2 Day 1 compared to Cycle 1 Day 7. 
Interaction with acid reducing agents (ranitidine) 
Study  A2103,  a  single-center,  open-label,  randomized,  five  period,  ten  sequence  crossover  study, 
investigated  the  effects  of  food  and  the  histamine  H2-receptor  antagonist  ranitidine  on  the 
pharmacokinetics of oral alpelisib in healthy volunteers. 
Co-administration of the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine in combination with a single 300 mg oral dose 
of alpelisib slightly reduced bioavailability of alpelisib and decreased overall exposure. In the presence 
of a LFLC meal, AUCinf was decreased by 21% and Cmax by 36% with ranitidine. In the absence of food, 
the  effect  was  more  pronounced  with  a  30%  decrease  in  AUCinf  and  51%  decrease  in  Cmax  with 
ranitidine compared to the fasted state without co-administration of ranitidine.

Population  PK  analysis  which  assessed  the  intake  of  ARAs  (H2-receptor  antagonists,  proton  pump 
inhibitors and antacids) as time-varying variable on clearance and volume, found no evidence of an effect 
of  either  type  of  acid  reducing  agent  under  fed  conditions  in  the  Phase  1  or  in  the  Phase  3  Pop  PK 
population. More than half of the subjects in the Phase 1 pool took ARAs at least once during PK sampling 
phase,  while  about  a  third  of  the  Phase  3  population  took  ARAs  at  least  once  during  the  duration  of 
alpelisib treatment. 
Effect of fulvestrant on the Pharmacokinetics of Alpelisib 
No dose adjustments for alpelisib are recommended when co-administered with fulvestrant due to the 
absence of any clinically relevant DDI on alpelisib PK due to fulvestrant. Alpelisib had no effect on the 
PK of fulvestrant. 
Based on available information on fulvestrant and an understanding of alpelisib’s ADME properties, no 
metabolic and transporter drug-drug-interaction between the two drugs is anticipated. Also due to the 
difference in route of administration (oral vs. intra-muscular) an absorption-related direct interaction 
can be considered unlikely. 
Clinical PK data of alpelisib at doses of 300 mg, 350 mg and 400 mg once daily in combination with 
fulvestrant were collected as part of Study X2101. Primary PK parameters such as peak levels (Cmax) 
and exposure (AUC0-24) were overall comparable across the different dose levels except for the 400 
mg treatment group which included the majority of subjects, possibly due to increased inter-subject 
variability (Section 2.3.1). Phase I population PK analysis based on the Phase I pool indicated that 
exposure is lower by 25% in combination with fulvestrant, as compared to that of the single agent 
[Phase I PopPK Report]. As the Phase III population model, however, displayed similarities in 
alpelisib's estimates of clearance and volume to those of the single agent from Phase I population 
model, and thus similar overall exposure at the 300 mg dose, this suggest that there is no effect on 
the PK of alpelisib due to fulvestrant (Phase III PopPK Report). 
Additionally, the results from Study C2301 showed that alpelisib did not have an effect on the PK of 
fulvestrant. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Alpelisib is an α-specific class I phosphatidylinositol3kinase (PI3Kα) inhibitor. Gain-of-function 
mutations in the gene encoding the catalytic α-subunit of PI3K (PIK3CA) lead to activation of PI3Kα 
and AKT-signalling, cellular transformation and the generation of tumours in in vitro and in vivo 
models. 
In breast cancer cell lines, alpelisib inhibited the phosphorylation of PI3K downstream targets including 
AKT, and showed activity in cell lines harbouring a PIK3CA mutation. 
In vivo, alpelisib inhibited the PI3K/AKT signalling pathway and reduced tumour growth in xenograft 
models, including models of breast cancer. 
PI3K inhibition by alpelisib treatment has been shown to induce an increase in oestrogen receptor (ER) 
transcription in breast cancer cells. The combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant demonstrated 
increased anti-tumour activity compared to either treatment alone in xenograft models derived from 
ER-positive, PIK3CA mutated breast cancer cell lines. 
The PI3K/AKT signalling pathway is responsible for glucose homeostasis, and hyperglycaemia is an 
expected on-target adverse reaction of PI3K inhibition (see SmPC section 5.1).

Primary and secondary pharmacology 
Study X2101 
Study  X2101  was  a  multicenter,  Phase  IA,  dose-escalation/expansion  study  of  oral  alpelisib  in  adult 
subjects with advanced solid malignancies. In this study, monotherapy and concomitant treatment with 
fulvestrant was studied. There was a higher response rate, when alpelisib was combined with fulvestrant, 
than when treated with alpelisib alone.  
Single agent alpelisib 
Overall, the ORR per RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid tumors) 1.0 was 6% (8/134 patients) 
based on the full analysis set (FAS); with one patient achieving a CR and seven patients having a PR. 
The disease control rate (DCR) was 58.2% (78/134 patients). Of the 36 patients with breast cancer, 23 
had ER+/HER2- disease. No complete or partial responses were observed in the other 13 breast cancer 
patients. However, 2 patients with ER-/HER2- breast cancer had tumor shrinkage of -25.0% and -23.5%, 
and a ER+/HER2+ breast cancer patient had a tumor shrinkage of -29.6%. 
One PR (4.3%) was observed among 23 study patient with ER+/HER2- breast cancer treated with BYL719 
as single agent. 13 patients (56.5%) had SD as the best overall response in this population. The disease 
control rate in patients with ER+/HER2- breast cancer was 60.9% [38.5; 80.3]. 
Combination alpelisib+fulvestrant  
Eighty-five patients were treated with BYL719 in combination with fulvestrant, among them 52 with ER+ 
breast cancer harboring an alteration of the PIK3CA gene (mutation or amplification) and 33 with PIK3CA 
wild type ER+ breast cancers. Most patients had ER+ HER2- breast cancer with PIK3CA alteration, 49 of 
those  were  evaluable  for  response.  14/49  patients  with  ER+/HER2-  PIK3CA  altered  breast  cancer 
achieved  a  partial  tumor  response  during  treatment;  the  ORR  was  28.6%  [95%  CI  16.6,  43.3].  The 
disease control rate (DCR) in these patients was 79.6% [95% CI 65.7, 89.8] and the clinical benefit rate 
(CBR), defined as CR or PR or SD >24weeks, was 44.9% [95% CI 30.7; 59.8]. In contrast, no objective 
tumour responses were observed in ER+/HER2- PIK3CA wild-type breast cancer patients. The DCR in 
this population was 46.9% [95% CI 29.1; 65.3]. The posterior mean and 95% credible intervals of ORR 
for the PIK3CA mutant cohort was 26.1% [15%, 38.9%]. Further results are presented under clinical 
efficacy, supportive studies. 
Secondary pharmacology 
Serial, single post-dose ECGs (triplicate at baseline) were collected with time-matched PK samples (1h, 
2h, 4h, 8h, and 24h) following a single dose (Day 1) and at steady-state (Day 8 and Day 29) to 
evaluate the effect of alpelisib on the QTc interval in subjects with advanced solid tumors and 
metastatic breast cancer as single agent and in combination with fulvestrant. 
QT correction was performed using QTcF and population derived corrected QTc (QTcP). As only QTcP 
fully decoupled the effect of heart rate (RR) on QT intervals this correction was used in concluding on 
the QT effect of alpelisib. Hysteresis plots confirmed the absence of a delayed QT effect. Central 
tendency analysis was conducted across all dose levels, regimen and occasions for single agent and in 
combination. The analysis showed small increases in QTc values around Tmax across all dose levels 
and in single agent vs. combination with fulvestrant. QTcF values showed a similar trend as observed 
with QTcP across all patient cohorts. A linear mixed effect model was used to fit the relationship 
between delta QTcP and time matched alpelisib concentrations with patient as a random effect. A 
treatment effect, with or without fulvestrant, was implemented as fixed effect on both the slope and 
the intercept. The concentration-effect regression analysis for change in QTcP parameters are 
presented in Figure 16. The solid regression lines describe the linear relationship between alpelisib 
plasma concentration (in grey single agent and in black for combination arm) and ECG parameter

change from baseline, estimated from the linear mixed effect model. The dashed lines represent the 
corresponding two-sided lower and upper 90% confidence bands for the single arm group (grey lines) 
and the combination arm (black lines).  
The analysis of the QTc interval with increasing dose did not reveal an increased risk of clinical 
significant QTc prolongation at the clinical relevant doses. However, the data showed a large variability 
in QTc change (Figure 16) .  
Change from baseline for QTcF was assessed in the Alpelisib Cardiac Safety Report for Study X2101. Of 
the 86 subjects with post-dose measurement treated with combination therapy, 31 subjects (36%) had 
increased QTcF above 30 ms. Most of the cases were observed during the first treatment cycle, which 
is most likely due to more measurements during this period. In 25 out of the 31 subjects other reasons 
for QTc prolongation were identified. The most common risk factors associated with QT prolongation 
were hypokalemia (n=10), previous anthracycline treatment (n=6) or current hypothyroidism (n=9), 
ciprofloxacin treatment or diarrhea (n=5 and n=7, respectively) and ondansetron treatment (n=5 
cases).  
Overall, hypokalaemia was the most frequently occurring factor in common in subjects with QTc 
prolongation above 30 ms. 
In the cardiac safety report, there was a positive association between alpelisib concentration and QTc 
with a slope of 0.0014 ms/ng/mL (90%CI: 0.0009; 0.0019). However, considering the therapeutic 
range, the geometric mean Cmax for the recommended dose of 300 mg was 2900 ng/ml, which was 
associated with an estimated QTcP of 4.9 ms (90% CI 2.78;7.02) and QTcF of 7.3 ms (90%CI: 5.29, 
9.36).

Exposure-safety analysis 
•  Hyperglycaemia 
Overall, the analyses consistently indicated increasing exposure was associated with increasing risk of 
hyperglycemia (grade 2 or worse). Hence, dose reductions are appropriate to reduce the risk of 
hyperglycemia. The Phase I analysis also showed a relationship between the risk of hyperglycemia and

baseline fasting plasma glucose, indicating that subjects with greater baseline value are at a greater 
risk of developing hyperglycemia when receiving alpelisib.  
Phase I pool 
Results showed that increasing exposure (AUC0-24) by 50% the risk of hyperglycemic event (grade 2 
or worse) increases by 74.7% (HR=1.747, 95% CI: 1.333, 2.290). Increasing baseline FPG by 1 
mmol/L unit similarly increases the risk by 75.8% (HR=1.758, 95% CI: 1.449, 2.113) (Appendix 1-
Table 3-33). 
Phase III 
The results showed that increasing exposure by 50% (TN-Ctrough) increased the risk of hyperglycemic 
events by 22.3% (HR=1.223, 95% CI: 1.014, 1.475) for grade 2 or worse and by 33.1% (HR=1.331, 
95% CI: 1.058, 1.675) (grade 3 or worse). Using the instantaneous Ctrough showed an attenuation of 
the risk. 
•  Rash 
Overall, the analyses showed a trend between an increase in plasma exposure and the risk of rash 
though differences were observed between the Phase I study pool and the Phase III data. This was 
mainly due to a wider range of doses studied in Phase I.  
Phase I pool 
Results showed that by increasing exposure (AUC0-24) by 50% the risk of a rash event (grade 2 or 
worse) increases by 40.6% (HR=1.406, 95% CI: 1.083, 1.826). No difference was detected between 
monotherapy and combination with fulvestrant with respect to the probability of rash. 
Phase III 
The impact of alpelisib exposure, characterized by either TN-Ctrough (time-dependent covariate) or 
instantaneous Ctrough (fixed covariate) on rash (at least grade 2 and at least grade 3) was 
investigated using a Cox regression model in Study C2301. A trend towards higher risk of rash was 
shown with increasing TN-Ctrough; 50% in TN-Ctrough increases the risk of a least Grade 2 rash by 
16% (HR=1.160, 95% CI: 0.907, 1.485), and 15% for at least Grade 3 rash (HR=1.150, 95% CI: 
0.841, 1.574). The instantaneous effect of Ctrough showed a small increase in the risk of rash by 4-
8% for an increase in instantaneous Ctrough by 50%. 
The different use of exposure metrics was justified due to differences in the sampling schedule 
between Phase I and Phase III studies. Overall, equal exposure-safety relationships were established 
and differences in the mathematical relationships were associated to differences in population, PK 
metrics and associated variability.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Piqray is for oral use. The tablets should be swallowed whole and should not be chewed, crushed or 
split. Tablets that are broken, cracked or otherwise not intact should not be ingested. 
The pharmacokinetics properties of alpelisib were investigated in patients under an oral dosing regimen 
ranging from 30 to 450 mg daily. Healthy subjects received single oral doses ranging from 300 to 400 
mg.  
The methodology applied to characterise the pharmacokinetics and interactions through non-
compartmental analysis and population approach is generally acceptable. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 72/174 
 
 
  
 
In general, the pre-study validations of the analytical methods are satisfactory and demonstrated 
adequate precision y accuracy (both intra- and inter-run) within the calibration range. The bioanalytical 
methods also showed and adequate sensitivity, selectivity, matrix effect and no-carry-over effect. In 
addition, the analyte stability was demonstrated. 
No bioavailability study in humans was provided. The oral absorption and bioavailability of alpelisib was 
characterised using data from other clinical and non-clinical studies and supported by an absorption 
model. This alternative approach is considered acceptable. 
In the ADME study 400 mg alpelisib was administered in four fasting healthy subjects. The Tmax in 
this study was similar to the results obtained in studies conducted in non-fasting patients. However, 
the Cmax and AUC0-24 were lower than in non-fasting subjects. Based on the food effect study, it is 
recommended that the drug is taken with food where the absorption is almost doubled and the 
variation lower. The lower absorption in the mass balance study is not suspected to impact the results 
on distribution, metabolism and excretion. However, a study under fed conditions would have been 
preferred as expected to be more sensitive. 
The population pharmacokinetics of alpelisib have been described using a one-compartment model 
with first-order absorption, distribution and elimination, including several covariates affecting CL/F and 
V/F. The adequacy of the model is considered acceptable based on the model performance and final 
parameter estimates. The clinical relevance of different covariates was assessed.  
Overall, the pharmacokinetics were comparable in both oncology patients and healthy subjects. 
Based on the provided data, it is considered that there is dose proportionality for AUC and Cmax across 
doses, which also includes the proposed treatment dose of 300 mg. However, it is noted that the inter-
subject variability for AUC0-24 and AUClast increase with increasing doses which is also true for Cmax. 
After repeated daily administration, alpelisib accumulates in plasma (between 1.3- and 1.5-fold) with 
steady state reached by day 3. The accumulation ratio is not considered clinically relevant. There is no 
evidence of time dependency. 
No studies have been conducted to investigate the impact of genetic polymorphism on PK. As the 
metabolism of alpelisib is mainly by non-CYP dependent hydrolysis, it is not expected that genetic 
polymorphism will affect the metabolism of alpelisib. 
Based on the provided data, alpelisib absorption is affected by food. Safety, efficacy and PK (including 
dose proportionality) of alpelisib have been established in the fed state in patients with cancer in 
submitted studies. Data indicates that the exposure to alpelisib is increased by any meal. The increase 
in gastrointestinal solubility by bile, secreted in response to food intake, is the potential cause of the 
food effect. Hence, Piqray should be taken immediately after food at approximately same time each 
day. (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
If a dose of Piqray is missed, it can be taken immediately following food and within 9 hours after the 
time it is usually administered. After more than 9 hours, the dose should be skipped for that day. On 
the next day, Piqray should be taken at the usual time. If the patient vomits after taking the Piqray 
dose, the patient should not take an additional dose on that day and should resume the usual dosing 
schedule the next day at the usual time.   
The co-administration of the H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine in combination with a single 300 mg oral 
dose of alpelisib slightly reduced the bioavailability of alpelisib and decreased overall exposure of 
alpelisib. In the presence of a low-fat low-calorie (LFLC) meal, AUCinf was decreased on average by 
21% and Cmax by 36% with ranitidine. In the absence of food, the effect was more pronounced with a 
30% decrease in AUCinf and a 51% decrease in Cmax with ranitidine compared to the fasted state 
without co-administration of ranitidine. Population pharmacokinetic analysis showed no significant 
Assessment report

effect of co-administration of acid-reducing agents, including proton pump inhibitors, H2 receptor 
antagonists and antacids, on the pharmacokinetics of alpelisib. It is agreed that the clinical impact of 
ranitidine on alpelisib PK might be of minor relevance (around 20% change in AUC and Cmax) as long 
as alpelisib is taken immediately after food. Therefore, alpelisib can be co-administered with 
acid-reducing agents, provided alpelisib is taken immediately after food (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 
4.5). 
With regards to special population, the population pharmacokinetic analysis showed that there are no 
clinically relevant effects of age, body weight, or gender on the systemic exposure of alpelisib that 
would require dose adjustment (see SmPC section 5.2). 
Pharmacokinetic data was derived only from adult. This is reflected in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Of 284 patients who received Piqray in the phase III study (in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm), 117 
patients were ≥65 years of age and 34 patients were between 75 and 87 years of age. Overall, there 
are limited data in patients aged ≥75 years, and especially in those ≥85 years.  
Based on PK modelling, no dose regimen adjustment is required in patients aged 65 years or above. 
(see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2).  
Population pharmacokinetic analyses and pharmacokinetic analyses from a phase I study in Japanese 
cancer patients showed that there are no clinically relevant effects of ethnicity on the systemic 
exposure of Piqray. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic parameters after single and multiple daily 
doses of Piqray for Japanese patients were very similar to those reported in the Caucasian population 
(see SmPC section 5.2). 
Based on the results from Study A2105, a pharmacokinetic study conducted with hepatic impairment, 
moderate and severe hepatic impairment had negligible effect on the exposure of alpelisib. The mean 
exposure for alpelisib was increased 1.26 fold in patients with severe (GMR: 1.00 for Cmax; 1.26 for 
AUClast/AUCinf) hepatic impairment. Differences in AUC and Cmax of alpelisib were not statistically 
different across the different sub-groups of population in this study. Similar results were observed on 
the population PK analysis that included 230 patients with normal hepatic function, 41 patients with 
mild hepatic impairment and no patients with moderate hepatic impairment, further supporting the 
findings from the dedicated hepatic impairment study, mild and moderate hepatic impairment had no 
effect on the exposure of alpelisib. Overall, no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild, 
moderate or severe hepatic impairment (Child Pugh class A, B or C, respectively) based on a hepatic 
impairment study in non-cancer subjects with impaired hepatic function (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 
5.2). 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic analysis that included 117 patients with normal renal 
function (eGFR ≥90 ml/min/1.73 m2) / (CLcr ≥90 ml/min), 108 patients with mild renal impairment 
(eGFR 60 to <90 ml/min/1.73 m2)/ (CLcr 60 to <90 ml/min), and 45 patients with moderate renal 
impairment (eGFR 30 to <60 ml/min/1.73 m2), mild and moderate renal impairment had no effect on 
the exposure of alpelisib (see SmPC section 5.2). The observed differences in AUC and Cmax due to 
renal impairment were justified by differences in age. Exposure differences across the age sub-groups 
of population were less than 20%, which can be considered no clinically relevant. Overall, it is 
concluded that no dose adjustment is necessary in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment 
(see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.2). Caution should be used in patients with severe renal impairment as 
there is no experience with Piqray in this population. 
The interaction effects of alpelisib on different enzymatic substrates was deeply evaluated using in 
vitro, in silico and in vivo data. The effect of different enzymatic inhibitors or inducers and the co-
administration of fulvestrant was also assessed. The results suggest minor impact at the expected

exposure range of alpelisib administration on the other substrates and minor changes of alpelisib 
concentrations when co-administered with other drugs.  
CYP3A4 is the predominant enzyme involved in the metabolism of alpelisib, however the overall 
contribution of CYP3A metabolism was considered low with an estimated fm of 12%. In vitro studies 
indicated that alpelisib may induce CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYP3A, may inhibit CYP2C8, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, and that alpelisib is a time-dependent inhibitor of CYP3A4 (see non-clinical data). The 
Applicant provided a sensitivity analysis where the fraction metabolized (fm) via CYP3A4 ranged from 
0.12 to 0.207. Predicted changes in AUC ratios with ritonavir and rifampicin were 27% higher and 25% 
lower compared to fm=0.12. Based on the results from the worst-case scenario, the impact of co-
administrated strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or inducers is considered of low clinical concern. In conclusion, 
although the effects of CYP3A4 inducers or inhibitors have not been evaluated in clinical studies, no 
clinically meaningful changes in overall exposure are expected as a result of the low fraction (<15%) 
metabolised by CYP3A4. 
Simulation of the induction potential of alpelisib of CYP2C9 indicated a maximum effect of 0.2 change 
of warfarin AUC after concomitant alpelisib 300 mg qd. However, this result is not supported by clinical 
data and the PBPK modelling platform was not fully validated to predict alpelisib induction potential on 
CYP2C9. Therefore, caution is recommended when alpelisib is used in combination with CYP2C9 
substrates with narrow therapeutic index (see SmPC section 4.5).   
Additionally, no clinical data of CYP2B6 interaction are available from clinical studies. Static 
mechanistic risk assessments were carried out with sensitive CYP2B6 substrates to evaluate alpelisib 
potential for CYP2B6 induction. As a result of the assessments, a reduction of bupropion exposure by 
up to 3-fold can be expected when co-administered with alpelisib. Therefore, sensitive CYP2B6 
substrates (e.g. bupropion) or CYP2B6 substrates with a narrow therapeutic window should be used 
with caution in combination with Piqray.  
In vitro interaction studies showed that pharmacokinetic interactions by P-gp, BCRP and OAT3 are 
expected in patients. The risk of interactions of alpelisib with P-gp, BCRP and OAT3 transporters are 
adequately described in sections 4.5 and 5.2 of the SmPC (see also discussion on non-clinical aspects).  
The major metabolite BZG791 inhibited CYP2C8 and induced CYP2C9 and CYP2B6. BZG791 was a 
medium strong inhibitor of OATP1B1 (Ki 8.59 µM) and a strong inhibitor of OAT3 (Ki 1.38 µM). 
However, no clinically relevant exposure changes are expected from these interactions.  
Since alpelisib is an inducer and an inhibitor of CYP3A4, the effect of alpelisib on CYP3A4 enzymes was 
investigated in both a clinical DDI study and PBPK simulations and it was concluded that no clinically 
meaningful change is expected as a result of drug interaction with CYP3A4 substrates. Therefore, no 
dose adjustment is required when co-administering Piqray with CYP3A4 substrates. The results from 
the drug-drug interaction study in which alpelisib was co administered with everolimus, a sensitive 
CYP3A4 substrate, confirmed that there are no clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions 
(increase in AUC by 11.2%) between alpelisib and CYP3A4 substrates. No change in everolimus 
exposure was observed at alpelisib doses ranging from 250 to 300 mg. No dose adjustment is required 
when co administering Piqray with CYP3A4 substrates (e.g. everolimus, midazolam).  
Caution is recommended when Piqray is used in combination with CYP3A4 substrates that also possess 
an additional time dependent inhibition and induction potential on CYP3A4 that affects their own 
metabolism (e.g. rifampicin, ribociclib, encorafenib) (see SmPC section 4.5). 
Overall, potential pharmacokinetic interactions mediated by the interaction of alpelisib and its main 
metabolite M4 with CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19 and CYP3A4 are adequately described in the 
SmPC. Inhibition of CYP2C8 by alpelisib at clinically relevant concentrations can be discarded based on 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020

the result of a clinical trial (Study CBYL719Z2101, data not shown) that showed that the PK of 
paclitaxel (a CYP2C8 substrate) was unaffected by alpelisib (Rodon et al 2018). 
No clinical studies were conducted assessing the drug-drug interaction potential between alpelisib and 
hormonal contraceptives. 
Results from study X2101, in which monotherapy and concomitant treatment with fulvestrant was 
tested, were presented. There did not seem to be a larger benefit of the maximal tolerated dose (400 
mg) compared with 300 mg dose. The Applicant argued that overall response rates for alpelisib in 
monotherapy occurred at alpelisib doses of 270 mg or above. Furthermore, it was argued that constant 
inhibition of the PI3K pathway can only be obtained at single-agent dose levels of 300 mg or above. 
Therefore, the starting dose of 300 mg was chosen. The justification by the Applicant of the selected 
dose of 300 mg is considered acceptable. 
The Applicant has sufficiently justified the pharmacodynamic interaction between alpelisib and 
fulvestrant. The Applicant discussed that the activated PI3K pathway has a prominent role in the 
development of endocrine resistance and estrogen-independent tumor growth. Targeting the activated 
PI3K pathway in ER positive tumours may therefore reverse the loss of ER expression and signalling 
and restore the hormonal sensitivity. Concomitant targeting of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and the ER 
pathway was therefore proposed.  
The exposure response analysis did not show any statistical significant association between exposure 
and progression free survival, which might be due to short half-life and thereby small differences in 
Ctrough making the analysis unable to show statistical significant results.  
An exposure-safety analysis was conducted in order to assess the development of hyperglycaemia and 
rash in patients. The exposure-QTc analysis did not show any QTc prolongation along the expected 
alpelisib exposure range. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The assessment of the clinical pharmacology properties of alpelisib is acceptable. The adequacy of the 
analytical methods, pharmacokinetic properties, population pharmacokinetic model and interaction 
effects have been demonstrated.

2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
Dose selection was mainly based on a single first in-human phase I clinical trial, with some additional 
input from a similar trial performed in Japanese patients, three investigator-initiated trials and another 
Novartis-sponsored study. 
Selection of the alpelisib 300 mg daily continuous dosing schedule was based on the results of the first 
in-human Study X2101, where alpelisib was administered both as a single agent and in combination 
with fulvestrant in the BC subset.  
134 adult subjects with advanced solid malignancies whose tumors had an alteration (mutation or 
amplification) of the PIK3CA gene were treated with increasing doses of oral alpelisib (30 mg to 450 
mg once daily or 120 mg to 200 mg twice daily). The maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was determined 
to be 400 mg.  
87 subjects with heavily pretreated ER-positive, HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer were treated 
with alpelisib (300 mg, 350 mg, and 400 mg once daily) in combination with fulvestrant at the 
approved dose and schedule of 500 mg on Days 1 and 15 of the first cycle and Day 1 of subsequent 
cycles. The MTD for alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant was found to be the same as in 
monotherapy, that is 400 mg daily.  
Nevertheless, the recommended dose for further development was determined to be 300 mg based on 
the following information: 
1.  Similar levels of pharmacodynamic and clinical activity were observed among 300 mg, 350, mg 
and 400 mg of alpelisib plus fulvestrant. 
2.  Exposure-safety analysis results confirmed a positive association between exposure and the 
risk of developing grade ≥ 2 hyperglycaemia or rash. 
3.  Median relative dose intensity was in fact lower for the subjects receiving 400 mg (89.3%) 
than among those assigned to the lower 300 mg stratum (99.5%), due to lower rates of dose 
adjustment and/or interruption (33.3% vs 71.4%) or drug discontinuation (0% vs 12.9%) 
Thus, the clinical and proposed commercial dosage of alpelisib film-coated tablets in combination with 
fulvestrant is 300 mg once daily with dose reduction allowed to manage adverse events (AEs) in 50 mg 
increments to 250 mg or 200 mg once daily. The three proposed commercial strengths of alpelisib FCT 
are 50 mg, 150 mg, and 200 mg. 
2.5.2.  Main study 
Study CBYL719C2301 (SOLAR-1) 
Study C2301 is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicenter Phase III 
study to determine whether treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant prolongs PFS relative to placebo

or within 5 half-lives of the investigational product, whichever was longer.  
•  History of acute pancreatitis within 1 year of screening or past medical history of chronic 
pancreatitis. 
• 
Patients who relapsed with documented evidence of progression more than 12 months from 
completion of (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy with no treatment for metastatic disease. 
Determination of PIK3CA mutation status 
During the screening phase, tumour samples were collected by the investigational sites and shipped to 
the designated central laboratory to establish the PIK3CA mutation status prior to randomization. The 
PIK3CA mutation status was identified by analysing the PIK3CA gene for hotspots known to impact 
PI3K function in exons 7, 9, and 20, anticipated to cover the majority of the PIK3CA mutations 
identified in patients with HR-positive breast cancer. PIK3CA non-mutant status was defined as follows: 
all analyses for PIK3CA mutation were interpretable and showed no evidence of a mutation in the 
PIK3CA gene for the defined hotspots in exons 7, 9, and 20. If the analysis for the PIK3CA gene 
mutation was not fully interpretable, i.e. at least one hotspot provided a non-interpretable result, the 
subject was not eligible for the study. 
PIK3CA mutation testing was to be performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumour 
biopsy specimens, from either initial diagnosis or the most recent biopsy, utilising the Novartis PIK3CA 
PCR mutation CTA. When enrolment for the PIK3CA non-mutant cohort was substantially complete, 
C2301 mutation screening transitioned to the QIAGEN therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit, the 
companion diagnostic (CDx) developed for alpelisib (hereafter referred to as Tissue CDx).  
Treatments 
Study treatment was double-blinded. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio within each cohort 
(PIK3CA mutant and PIK3CA non-mutant) to receive either: 
A.  Alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 80/174 
 
 
  
 
 
Alpelisib 300 mg orally q.d continuously + Fulvestrant 500 mg i.m. on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 
1 and on Day 1 ± 3 days of a 28-day cycle thereafter 
B.  Placebo plus fulvestrant arm 
Alpelisib-matching placebo 300 mg orally q.d continuously + Fulvestrant (same schedule as 
study arm A) 
Patients were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, death, or discontinuation from 
the study treatment for any other reason.  
Treatment crossover from placebo plus fulvestrant to alpelisib plus fulvestrant was not permitted in 
this study. 
For patients who did not tolerate the protocol-specified dosing schedule, dose adjustments were 
permitted for alpelisib/placebo. No dose modification for fulvestrant was permitted. 
A maximum of two dose reductions (to 250 mg and to 200 mg) was allowed, after which the patient 
was to be discontinued from treatment with alpelisib/placebo. Dose reduction was based on the worst 
preceding toxicity.  
Table 25: Dose reduction sequential steps for alpelisib/placebo 
After treatment with alpelisib/placebo was resumed at a lower dose due to toxicity: 
- 
If the same toxicity reoccurred with the same severity, then the dose was to be lowered one 
more level during the next treatment re-initiation irrespective of the duration it took for 
resolution. 
-  Once the alpelisib/placebo dose had been reduced, no re-escalation was allowed, even upon 
resolution of the AE. 
If a patient required a dose delay of alpelisib/placebo for > 28 days then alpelisib/placebo was 
permanently discontinued, but treatment with fulvestrant could continue. All scheduled assessments 
also continued. If fulvestrant was withheld for > 35 days since a planned injection, then fulvestrant 
was permanently discontinued. Patients could continue treatment with alpelisib/placebo at the 
discretion of the Investigator until study completion and all scheduled assessments were performed. 
Medications required to treat AEs, manage cancer symptoms, concurrent diseases, and supportive care 
agents, such as pain medications, anti-emetics, and antidiarrheals were allowed. 
The use of bisphosphonates/denosumab, regardless of indication, was allowed if patients had been 
taking stable doses for at least 2 weeks prior to randomization and continued on a stable dose during 
the treatment period. Patients requiring new initiation of bisphosphonates/denosumab during the 
course of the study could continue study treatment if disease progression could be completely ruled 
out and was clearly documented in the subjects’ source documentation. 
The following medications were prohibited during combined alpelisib/placebo and fulvestrant treatment 
in this study: 
-  Medications with a known risk for TdP 
-  Other investigational and antineoplastic therapies 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 81/174 
 
 
  
 
 
-  Herbal preparations/medications and dietary supplements (except for vitamins). 
Co-administering QT prolonging drugs or drugs with potential QT prolongation was to be avoided 
where possible. If concomitant administration of drugs with a known potential to cause TdP was 
required, study treatment was interrupted until an assessment of the potential safety risk had been 
performed.

intermediate to PFS and OS (the endpoint to evaluate the long-term benefit intermediate to PFS and 
OS is progression on next-line therapy (PFS2)). 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint: PFS in the PIK3CA mutant cohort for the FAS based on local radiology 
assessment. PFS was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of first 
documented progression or death due to any cause. 
PFS was censored at the last adequate tumour assessment if a patient did not have an event or the 
event occurred after two or more missing tumour assessments. In the primary analysis, PFS was not 
censored if a new antineoplastic therapy was started; instead, an intent-to-treat (ITT) approach was 
used and this new antineoplastic therapy was ignored for the purposes of PFS derivation (and tumour 
assessments continued). 
Sensitivity analyses were performed if the analysis of the primary endpoint in the PIK3CA mutant 
cohort showed statistically significant results, including repeating the primary PFS analysis using the 
PPS, using different censoring rules, and using an unstratified log-rank test to compare the two 
treatment arms. 
A stratified, multivariate Cox regression model was fitted to evaluate the effect of other baseline 
demographic or disease characteristics on the estimated hazard ratio. 
Tumour response was assessed locally and centrally (BIRC) based on RECIST 1.1. The primary efficacy 
assessment used to determine PFS was based on the local (i.e. Investigator) radiology review of 
tumour assessments and was used for treatment decision making. To support the primary endpoint, a 
central review of the scans was carried out only for the PIK3CA mutant cohort. Following an audit-
based approach, all scans from approximately 50% of randomly selected randomized subjects 
underwent review. If consistency in the treatment effect was not established between the investigator 
assessment and the selected audit sample, a full read of imaging data could follow. 
Key secondary endpoint: Overall Survival (OS) in patients of the PIK3CA mutant cohort. OS was 
defined as the time from date of randomization to date of death due to any cause. 
Other secondary endpoints: PFS and OS in the PIK3CA non-mutant cohort; PFS by PIK3CA mutant 
status as measured in ctDNA; Overall response rate defined as the proportion of subjects with best 
overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) according to 
RECIST 1.1; Clinical benefit rate defined as the proportion of subjects with a best overall response of 
CR or PR or SD or Non-CR/Non-PD lasting 24 weeks or more based on local Investigator assessment 
according to RECIST 1.1 criteria; Clinical response by PIK3CA mutant status as measured in ctDNA 
Time to definitive deterioration defined as an increase in ECOG PS by at least one category from the 
Baseline score or death due to any cause; change from baseline and time to 10% deterioration in 
global health status/QoL score of the EORTC QLQ-C30.  
Exploratory endpoints:  Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) for HRQoL analysed over time based on 
theEQ-5D-5L, and BPI-SF. 
Sample size 
Median PFS in the fulvestrant arm (control arm) was assumed to be 6.5 months (Di Leo et al 2010). 
For the overall population in the PIK3CA mutant cohort, the median PFS in the control arm (fulvestrant 
plus placebo) was estimated via simulation to be around 7.0 months. For the overall population in the 
PIK3CA non-mutant cohort, the median PFS in the control arm (fulvestrant plus placebo) was 
estimated via simulation to be around 7.4 months. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 83/174 
 
 
  
 
It was expected that treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant in both cohorts would result in a 40% 
reduction in the hazard rate (corresponding to an increase in median PFS from 7.0 months to 11.67 
months in the PIK3CA mutant cohort and from 7.4 months to 12.33 months in the PIK3CA non-mutant 
cohort, under the exponential model assumption). 
In the PIK3CA mutant cohort, a total of 243 PFS events were required to have 83.8% power at a one-
sided overall 2.0% level of significance to reject the null hypothesis. Assuming that 40% of the 
subjects would have a PIK3CA mutant status, and a 10% follow-up loss rate, a total of 340 subjects 
would need to be randomized in this cohort to the two treatment arms in a 1:1 ratio. 
In patients with PIK3CA non-mutant status, the proof of concept criteria required a minimum of 102 
PFS events and a final figure of 220 subjects was required for randomisation. 
Randomisation 
After confirmation of the eligibility criteria, patients were assigned to one of the two cohorts (PIK3CA 
mutant or PIK3CA non-mutant based on tissue testing).  Patients in each cohort were randomized to 
one of the two treatment arms using a 1:1 ratio and were stratified by presence of lung and/or liver 
metastasis and previous treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitor(s).  
In addition, the IRT will manage the limitation of the number of patients with prior CDK4/6 inhibitors 
treatment up to 30% of the total number of the patients. If the study was to continue in both cohorts to 
the final analyses, the maximum total number of CDK4/6 inhibitors pre-treated patients was to be 168. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Until the database for the final PFS analysis in the PIK3CA mutant 
cohort was locked, treatment arm assignment was kept blind to study subjects, Novartis Study team, 
investigators, local radiologists and central radiology reviewers.  
An independent Data Monitoring Committee reviewed semi-blinded safety and efficacy data. Efficacy 
and safety outputs were provided to the independent Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) with the two 
treatment arms identified as ‘Treatment 01’ and ‘Treatment 02.’ However, the identity of each 
treatment arm was not shared with the DMC. The DMC chair had the option to open the envelope 
containing the identity of each treatment arm during the course of DMC review if needed.  
The PIK3CA mutation status was also blinded to the investigators and the subjects. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis sets 
All efficacy analyses were performed using Full Analysis Set (FAS) which consisted of all randomized 
patients. According to the intent to treat principle, patient data were analysed according to the 
treatment and stratum they had been assigned to at randomization. The FAS was the main population 
for analyses of subject disposition, demographics, and other baseline characteristics. The FAS was also 
the primary population for the efficacy analyses.  
The Per-protocol set (PPS) comprised of all patients in the FAS for the PIK3CA mutant cohort who did 
not have any protocol deviations that confounded the interpretation of the primary analyses conducted 
on the FAS. The PPS was used to perform a sensitivity analysis for the primary efficacy endpoint (i.e. 
PFS in the PIK3CA mutant cohort) if the primary endpoint was statistically significant. 
Statistical hypothesis, model, and method of analysis 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020

The primary efficacy analysis was the comparison of the distribution of PFS between the two treatment 
groups using a stratified log-rank test at a one-sided 2.0% level of significance in the PIK3CA mutant 
cohort. A group sequential design with Haybittle-Peto boundaries was used to control the overall type-I 
error rate. A maximum of three analyses was planned; one futility interim analysis after observing 
approximately 97 PFS events (corresponding to a 40% information fraction), one interim analysis for 
superiority after observing approximately 185 PFS events (76% information fraction), and a final PFS 
analysis after observing approximately 243 events. 
The PFS survival distribution was estimated using Kaplan-Meier methodology. The PFS hazard ratio 
with two-sided 95% confidence interval (CI) was derived from the stratified Cox proportional hazards 
model. 
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the comparison of the distribution of OS between the two 
treatment groups in the PIK3CA mutant cohort. A hierarchical testing strategy was used to control the 
overall type-I error rate, where OS was to be statistically evaluated and interpreted only if the primary 
efficacy endpoint PFS was significantly different between the two treatment groups. 
Up-to 3 analyses of OS were planned. A Lan-DeMets (O’Brien-Fleming) (Lan and DeMets 1983) alpha-
spending function was used to control for type-I error rate inflation. 
PFS in the PIK3CA non-mutant cohort was analysed as a secondary endpoint and the treatment effect 
in this cohort was considered to be clinically relevant if: the estimated HR (stratified according to 
presence of lung/liver metastases and previous treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors) ≤ 0.60 and the 
posterior probability (HR < 1) ≥ 90%. If both criteria were met then the comparison of PFS between 
the two treatment arms in this cohort using a stratified log-rank test at a one-sided 0.5% level of 
significance, was to be made. OS analyses were to be performed only if PFS in this cohort met the PoC 
criteria and was statistically significant. An analysis of PFS based on local radiology assessments and 
using RECIST 1.1 criteria with PIK3CA mutant status as measured in ctDNA at baseline, was conducted 
using the same analytical conventions as the primary PFS analysis. 
ORR was calculated based on the FAS using Investigators’ review of tumour assessment data for each 
cohort. Subjects with only non-measurable disease at baseline were part of the analysis and were 
included in the numerator only if a CR was observed. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Since 23-Jul-2015, 572 patients have been enrolled in 275 sites across 33 countries, 341 in the 
PIK3CA mutant cohort and 231 in the PIK3CA non-mutant cohort. As of that date, the majority of 
patients in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm (75.1%) and in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm (80.8%) 
had discontinued study treatment, mostly due to progressive disease (55.0% in the alpelisib plus 
fulvestrant arm vs. 68.0% in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm).

The number of screen failures were high (n=808), and were most commonly due to failure of meeting 
the inclusion criteria (n=712) and pertaining to: lack of identification of PIK3CA mutation status 
(n=372); adequate formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tumor tissue for analysis of PIK3CA status 
(n=128); no adequate bone marrow and organ function (n=92); no measurable disease (n=44);

Recruitment 
Study initiation: 23-Jul-2015 (first subject first visit) 
Study completion date: Study ongoing (data cut-off date for efficacy analysis in PIK3CA mutant cohort 
and safety for both cohorts is 12-Jun-2018, data cut-off for efficacy analysis in PIK3CA non-mutant 
cohort is 23-Dec-2016). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol amendments 
The study protocol was amended four times. 
# Amendment 1 (09-Mar-2016 / 92 subjects randomized) was instituted to modify the assessment of 
the PIK3CA non-mutant cohort to be a secondary, proof-of-concept objective, based on incoming data 
from a Phase 1 alpelisib study and Phase 3 buparlisib indicating that a PIK3CA mutant patient may 
derive greater benefit from a PI3K inhibitor than a patient who is PIK3CA non-mutant. It also slightly 
restricted inclusion criteria related to basal plasma glucose levels. 
# Amendment 2 (30-Aug-2016 / 317 subjects randomized) excluded from enrolment subjects relapsed 
≥ 12 months from completion of (neo)adjuvant endocrine therapy with no treatment for metastatic 
Assessment report

disease). Again, inclusion criteria were revised in order to further restrict the recruitment of patients 
with potential hyperglycemic risk. 
# Amendment 3 (14-Dec-2016 / 443 randomized) corrected minor issues related to interim analysis 
and Novartis personnel blinding. 
# Amendment 4 (22-Nov-2017 / randomization completed) modified guidance for management of skin 
and subcutaneous reactions. 
Another relevant point of amendment 1 (and also of amendment 2) was the modification of inclusion 
criteria in order to make the trial more restrictive for patients with a trend towards hyperglycemic 
complications. 
Protocol deviations 
Overall, 52.5% of subjects in the PIK3CA mutant cohort had at least one protocol deviation (although 
only a fraction of these warranted exclusion from the PPS – see below). The proportion of subjects with 
protocol deviations (of any nature) was balanced across the two treatment arms (54.4% in the 
alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm and 50.6% in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm).

PIK3CA mutation status 
Tumour testing 
Study C2301 initiated in July 2015 with PIK3CA mutation testing performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-
embedded (FFPE) tumour biopsy specimens, from either initial diagnosis or the most recent biopsy, 
utilising the Novartis PIK3CA PCR mutation CTA. On 28 September 2016, when enrolment for the 
PIK3CA non-mutant cohort was substantially complete, C2301 mutation screening transitioned to the 
QIAGEN therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit, the companion diagnostic (CDx) developed for alpelisib 
(hereafter referred to as Tissue CDx). Enrollment for the C2301 PIK3CA non-mutant cohort ended on 
21 December 2016. Screening continued to identify PIK3CA mutation positive patients for the C2301 
mutant cohort until completion of randomization (21 July 2017).  
Of the 572 patients randomized in C2301, 395 were enrolled based on PIK3CA mutation status 
determined using the CTA (CTA-enrolled) and 177 were enrolled based on the Tissue CDx (CDx-
enrolled). 
Plasma testing 
Plasma samples were collected from randomized patients prior to initiation of study treatment and 
stored until retrospective analysis using the QIAGEN therascreen PIK3CA Plasma RGQ PCR Kit (Plasma 
CDx).

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Variable: PFS in the PIK3CA mutant cohort 
The PFS analysis was final and based on 232 events and a median follow-up time of 20.2 months 
corresponding to 61% events in the alpelisib arm (DCO 12 June 2018). 
The efficacy results in the cohort with PIK3CA mutation demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS in patients receiving alpelisib plus fulvestrant, compared to patients receiving 
placebo plus fulvestrant with an estimated 35% risk reduction of disease progression or death (HR = 
0.65; 95% CI: 0.50, 0.85; stratified log-rank test p = 0.00065, one-sided). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020   
Page 96/174 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Median PFS was prolonged by 5.3 months, i.e. from 5.7 months (95% CI: 3.7 - 7.4) for the placebo 
plus fulvestrant arm to 11.0 months (95% CI: 7.5, 14.5) for the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm 
The estimated Kaplan-Meier PFS rates at 12 months were 46.2% (95% CI: 38.1, 54.0) in the alpelisib 
plus fulvestrant arm and 32.9% (95% CI: 25.8, 40.2) in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm.

cohort)  
PFS results for the subgroup of endocrine resistant patients (HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.85, n=292) and 
endocrine sensitive patients (HR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.35, 2.17, n=39) were in favour of the alpelisib plus 
fulvestrant arm. 
Updated PFS analysis 
Per protocol, no further statistical testing of PFS data after the primary PFS analysis was planned. 
However, descriptive analyses of PFS in the PIK3CA mutant and non-mutant cohorts have been 
performed with the new DCO of 30-Sep-2019. 
Median duration of follow-up (from randomization date to the data cut-off date) among patients in the 
PIK3CA mutant cohort was 35.6 months, constituting approximately 15.6 months of additional follow-
up since the cut-off date for the primary efficacy analysis (12-Jun-2018). 
Compared with the primary efficacy analysis, a PFS event in the PIK3CA mutant cohort was reported 
for 20 additional patients in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm (123 vs 103 patients) and 19 additional 
patients in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm (148 vs 129).

Key secondary efficacy variable: OS in PIK3CA mutant cohort 
As of the 12-Jun-2018 data cut-off date, OS data were immature with 92 of the 178 deaths reported 
corresponding to a 51.7% information fraction at the first interim OS analysis. The median OS was not yet 
reached for the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm and was 26.9 months (95% CI: 21.9, NE) for the fulvestrant 
control arm. 69.2% of subjects in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm and 62.2% of subjects in the placebo plus 
fulvestrant arm were alive and were censored in this analysis.

Figure 28: Kaplan-Meier plot of OS (Full Analysis Set, PIK3CA mutant cohort) – Study C2301 (DCO 
12 June 2018) 
The second interim analysis of overall survival in the PIK3CA mutant cohort was conducted using a data 
cut-off date of 30-Sep-2019 and was based on 153 deaths corresponding to an 86.0% information fraction. 
The pre-specified O’Brien-Fleming stopping boundary (p-value ≤0.0117) was not crossed at this analysis. 
There were 69 events (40.8%) reported in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm, compared to 84 events (48.8%) 
in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. A median OS difference of 9.4 months in favour of the patients receiving 
alpelisib plus fulvestrant was observed (40.6 months, 95% CI (32.2, NE) vs 31.2 months, 95% CI (26.8, 
NE)), which at the cut-off point for this interim analysis was not statistically significant at the required 
p-value of  ≤0.0117 (HR=0.77, 95% CI: 0.56, 1.06, one-sided p-value = 0.06). 
Secondary endpoint: PFS in patients with PIK3CA non-mutant tumours 
PoC criteria for PFS per investigator assessment were not met in the non-mutant PIK3CA cohort.  Median PFS 
was 7.4 months (95% CI: 5.4, 9.3) and 5.6 months (95% CI: 3.9, 9.1) respectively, in the alpelisib plus 
fulvestrant and placebo plus fulvestrant treatment arms, estimated HR = 0.85; 95% CI: 0.58; 1.25.

Statistical testing of OS was not applicable, since PFS did not meet the PoC criteria and was not statistically 
significant for this cohort. At the cut-off date of 23-Dec-2016, there were 23 deaths (18.4% of the total 125 
planned for the final OS analysis): 7 (6.1%) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm and 16 (13.8%) in placebo

In the PIK3CA mutant cohort, using a data cut-off date of 12-Jun-2018, the overall response rate in patients 
with measurable disease at baseline was 35.7% (95% CI: 27.4, 44.7) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm 
and 16.2% (95% CI: 10.4, 23.5) in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. 
Ancillary analyses  
Exploratory endpoint: time to response and duration of response (DCO 12 Jun 2018) 
In PIK3CA mutant cohort, treatment with alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant was associated with 
numerical trends in favour of a shorter time to response compared with fulvestrant alone. The estimated 
probability of achieving a response by 6 months was 26.0% (95% CI: 19.86, 33.60) in the alpelisib plus 
fulvestrant arm (n=45) and 9.5% (95% CI: 5.95, 15.07) in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm (n=23).  
Among  subjects  with  a  response  (CR  or  PR),  median  duration  of  response  was  12.6  months  (95%  CI:  8.5, 
18.5) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm (n=25) and 14.8 months (95% CI: 10.12, NE) in the placebo plus 
fulvestrant arm (n=9).  
Secondary endpoint: change from baseline in global health status (DCO 12 Jun 2018) 
The median times to 10% deterioration in global health status/QoL scare score of EORTC QLC-C30 were 14.8 
vs 14.8 months in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant and placebo plus fulvestrant arms, respectively (HR=1.03; 
95% CI: 0.72, 1.48).

Secondary endpoint: time to definitive deterioration of ECOG PS (DCO 12 Jun 2018) 
In PIK3CA mutant cohort, sixty-seven percent of subjects had an ECOG performance status score of 0 at 
baseline and 33.3% of subjects an ECOG performance status score of 1 in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm 
compared to 66.1% of subjects with an ECOG performance status score of 0 and 33.9% with a score of 1 at 
baseline in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. No differences were observed between treatment arms in the 
time to definitive deterioration (TDD) of ECOG performance status (HR = 1.00; 95% CI: 0.65, 1.53).  
There were 44 subjects (26.0%) in the alpelisib arm and 41 subjects (23.8%) in the placebo arm who met 
the definitive deterioration criteria. The median TDD in ECOG performance status was 26.3 months (95% CI: 
26.3, NE) in the alpelisib arm and was not reached (95% CI: 20.4, NE) in placebo arm.  
The estimated Kaplan-Meier probability of no definitive deterioration in ECOG performance status at 12 
months was similar between the two treatment arms: 73.2% (95% CI: 64.7, 79.9) in the alpelisib arm vs. 
70.2% (95% CI: 60.6, 77.9) in the placebo arm.

Table 47: PFS2 per local investigator assessment with different cut-off dates, by cohort (FAS) 
Biomarkers 
PIK3CA mutations in tumour samples 
PIK3CA mutation status at baseline was determined using archival tumour tissue samples or available 
samples from most recent tumour tissue biopsy (“fresh”). Samples were predominantly archival (92%, 525 of 
the 572 randomized subjects. Of the 572 randomized subjects, 341 subjects had detectable PIK3CA 
mutations as determined by real-time PCR assays. Of these 341 with PIK3CA mutations, primary breast 
tumour biopsies were used for 262 subjects, metastatic tumour biopsies were used for 74 subjects, and 
tumour type was unknown for five subjects. Of the 231 subjects with no detectable PIK3CA mutations, 
primary tumour biopsies were used for 174 subjects, metastatic tumour biopsies were used for 51 subjects, 
and tumour type was unknown for six subjects. Of the 572 randomized subjects, the frequencies of 
mutations in the C2 domain (exon 7), helical domain (exon 9), and kinase domain (exon 20) were 1.0%, 
28.8%, and 33.7% respectively. The frequencies of exon 7, 9, and 20 mutations were similar across 
treatment arms and biopsy types. Within the helical domain, the most frequent mutations were E542K and 
E545K/X and within the kinase domain the most frequent mutations were H1047R/X. E545X denotes 
mutations inclusive of E545A/D/G/K and H1047X denotes mutations inclusive of H1047L/R/Y. 
PIK3CA mutation by ctDNA 
PIK3CA mutation status using real-time PCR was determined using plasma ctDNA samples collected from 
randomized subjects at baseline on Cycle 1 Day 1 prior to initiation of therapy. Of the 572 randomized 
subjects, 186 had a detectable PIK3CA mutation by ctDNA and 363 subjects had no detectable PIK3CA

mutations by ctDNA. ctDNA results were missing for 23 subjects due to no sample being collected or the 
sample was collected after initiation of therapy. PIK3CA mutation status by ctDNA was well balanced across 
treatment arms. Of the 572 randomized subjects, the frequencies of mutations in the C2 domain (exon 7), 
helical domain (exon 9) and kinase domain (exon 20) based on ctDNA were 0.3%, 12.8%, and 19.6%, 
respectively. Within the helical domain, the most frequent mutations by ctDNA were E542K and E545K. 
Within the kinase domain, the most frequent mutation was H1047R. Of the 341 subjects with PIK3CA 
mutations by tissue, 322 had PIK3CA results by ctDNA of whom 178 (55.3%) had a PIK3CA mutation by 
ctDNA. Of the 231 subjects with no detectable PIK3CA mutation by tissue, 227 had PIK3CA results by ctDNA 
of whom 219 (96.5%) had no detectable PIK3CA mutations by ctDNA. The percentage of subjects with 
agreement between ctDNA and tissue was similar for both tissue sample types (primary and metastatic).

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
The efficacy claim for subjects with a PIK3CA mutation is based primarily on data from Phase III Study 
C2301. Supportive data are provided from the combination dose-expansion part of the Phase IA Study 
X2101. No comparisons were provided between the respective efficacy results from these studies nor were 
the data pooled given the differences in indication, dose and schedule, and treatment regimen. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
No special subject populations were evaluated. As the eligibility criteria required subjects to have adequate 
renal and hepatic function, specific subgroup analyses of subjects with renal or hepatic impairment in the 
targeted subject population were not feasible. 
The table below summarises patients in special populations, i.e. grouped by age treated in the main clinical 
studies CBYL719C2301 (controlled), CBYL719X1101 and CBYL719X2101 (both uncontrolled).

Supportive studies 
Study X2101 
Study X2101 is a multicenter, Phase IA, dose-escalation/expansion study of oral alpelisib in adult subjects 
with advanced solid malignancies. 
Table 51: Summary of Phase IA combination expansion part – Study X2101 
Study objective 
and population 
Combination expansion: To assess the overall safety and tolerability of alpelisib treatment in 
combination with fulvestrant in subjects with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer whose 
tumors had an alteration of the PIK3CA gene and in subjects with PIK3CA wild- type breast 
cancer. 
Efficacy endpoints 
Efficacy endpoints were secondary endpoints in this study. These included: BOR, ORR, DCR, CBR, 
and PFS. 
No of subjects 
87 subjects were enrolled in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant combination treatment group (all dose 
groups): 28 in the dose-escalation part and 59 in the dose-expansion part. 52 subjects had 
centrally confirmed alteration of the PIK3CA gene (mutation or amplification), 33 subjects had 
centrally confirmed PIK3CA wild-type and 2 subjects with unknown status for PIK3CA gene by 
central laboratory analysis. 
During the dose escalation, 9 subjects were randomized to the alpelisib 300 mg plus fulvestrant 
arm (all PIK3CA altered) (corresponding to the dosage regimen that was used in Study C2301 and 
for which approval is being sought). 
Regimen 
Alpelisib was administered orally daily, on a continuous schedule together with fulvestrant 
(500 mg intramuscularly [as two 5-mL injections] on Days 1 and 15 of Cycle 1 and on Day 1 ± 3 
days of every 28-day cycle thereafter) 
Treatment duration  Alpelisib was taken up to disease progression or unacceptable toxicity that precluded any further 
Tumor assessment 
Statistical 
methodology 
treatment and/or treatment was discontinued at the discretion of the investigator or by subject 
refusal. 
Tumor assessments were performed using RECIST 1.0 for all subjects. All potential sites of tumor 
lesions were assessed at screening/baseline by radiologic techniques using thoracic, abdominal, 
and pelvic CT or MRI (although CT was the preferred imaging modality), complemented with brain 
scans in case of clinical evidence of metastatic brain disease. In addition, a bone scan was also 
performed for subjects with clinical evidence of bone metastases. Subsequent scans were 
performed at the end of Cycle 2, and every 8 weeks thereafter (i.e. at the end of Cycles 4, 6, 8, 
etc.), and at study treatment completion. All assessments were performed within 7 days prior to 
the scheduled day of assessment. The assessment at the end of study treatment visit was only 
performed if the prior assessment occurred ≥ 21 days before. 
BOR, ORR, DCR, and CBR were summarized as percentages with exact binomial two-sided 95% 
CIs. BOR was also displayed using waterfall plots. 
PFS: the survival distribution of PFS was estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method. The PFS 
hazard ratio with the two-sided 95% CI were derived from the Cox proportional hazards model. 
Kaplan-Meier estimates with 95% CIs were also summarized at specific time points (2, 4, and 
6 months) 
BOR: best overall response, CBR: clinical benefit rate, DCR: disease control rate, ORR: overall response rate, PFS: 
progression-free survival 
87 postmenopausal women with ER-positive locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer who had disease 
progression during or following anti-estrogen therapy or whose disease had relapsed following adjuvant anti-
estrogen therapy were treated with alpelisib and fulvestrant.  
Alpelisib was dosed at 300 mg (n = 9), 350 mg (n = 8), and at the MTD of 400 mg (n = 70). All 87 subjects 
were heavily pretreated, with a median of 5.0 prior antineoplastic regimens, 86 had undergone prior surgery, 
66 subjects received prior chemotherapy and 65 received prior radiotherapy. Prior anti-estrogen therapy was 
received by 53 subjects in the metastatic setting.

Among the 87 subjects, 52 subjects harboured an alteration of the PIK3CA gene (mutation or amplification) 
and 33 subjects had PIK3CA wild-type. 
Of the 49 evaluable subjects with ER-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer with PIK3CA mutation, the ORR 
was 28.6% (95% CI: 16.6, 43.3). 
The PFS analysis demonstrated that the alpelisib plus fulvestrant combination was associated with prolonged 
PFS among the 49 subjects with PIK3CA mutant tumours (median PFS: 9.1 months (95% CI: 7, 15)) relative 
to the 32 evaluable subjects with PIK3CA wild-type tumours (where the median PFS was 4.7 months (95% 
CI: 2, 6)).

subjects with advanced breast cancer by PIK3CA alteration status - combination agent (Full 
Analysis Set) – Study X2101 
Overall, 39 subjects reported prior fulvestrant use and were subsequently exposed to alpelisib plus 
fulvestrant with alpelisib doses of 300 mg, 350 mg, or 400 mg. The duration of fulvestrant was up to 180 
days (approx. 6 months) in 18 of the 39 subjects. Of the 39 subjects, 21 had measurable disease at baseline 
and PIK3CA mutations. The best overall responses to treatment with alpelisib plus fulvestrant for these 21 
subjects were partial response in 7 subjects, stable disease in 11 subjects, and progressive disease in 2 
subjects. For 1 subject, the best overall response is unknown. 
Study BYLieve (Study CBYL719X2402) 
This is a Phase II, multicentre, open-label, three-cohort, non-comparative study. This trial was designed to 
evaluate the use of alpelisib in combination with endocrine therapy (either fulvestrant or letrozole) in patients 
with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer whose tumour harboured a PIK3CA mutation and 
whose disease had progressed on or after prior treatment, including CDK 4/6 inhibitor-based therapy.

A total of 127 patients were enrolled to Cohort A. The primary analysis was performed for the modified Full 
analysis set (mFAS), defined as all subjects in Cohort A with a PI3KCA mutation confirmed by a Novartis-
designated laboratory (n = 121). The median duration of follow-up (from enrollment to the DCO date) was 
11.7 months. The median duration of exposure to alpelisib was 5.1 months, and for fulvestrant was 6.5 
months.

Table 53: Disease history: BYLieve Cohort A 
The primary endpoint was defined as the proportion of subjects who are alive without disease progression at 
6 months based on local investigator assessment using RECIST v1.1. A proportion of 30% of patients was 
considered to be a clinically meaningful threshold for all cohorts in this study, and therefore the primary 
objective for each cohort was met if the lower bound of the two-sided exact 95% CI of the proportion of non-
progressors was > 30%. Patients who progressed, died, or discontinued from the study before 6 months 
were counted as ‘failures’ in the analysis. In Cohort A, the proportion of subjects who were alive without 
disease progression at 6 months was 50.4% (95% CI: 41.2, 59.6), with the lower bound of the 95% CI 
exceeding 30%.

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The clinical efficacy data supporting this marketing authorisation application rely on the pivotal Study C2301 
(SOLAR-1), a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, international, multicentre Phase III study 
comparing alpelisib plus fulvestrant vs. placebo plus fulvestrant in postmenopausal women and men with HR-
positive, HER2-negative ABC after aromatase inhibitor failure, harbouring PIK3CA mutations. Supportive 
evidence from 49 patients treated in a dose-escalation phase 1 study X2101 was also considered. 
Furthermore, supportive data were presented from study BYLieve, a phase II, multicentre, open-label, three-
cohort, non-comparative study designed to evaluate the use of alpelisib in combination with endocrine 
therapy in patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation whose 
disease had progressed on or after prior treatment, including CDK 4/6 inhibitor-based therapy.  
In Study C2301, PFS and OS in the PIK3CA-mutant cohort were the primary and key secondary endpoint 
respectively. The study was composed of two parallel cohorts, PIK3CA-mutant and PIK3CA-wild type. Cohorts 
were selected on tissue-based mutational assessment, but a circulating-DNA assessment was incorporated 
into the design. Tumour tissue had to be available for PIK3CA central mutational status determination. New 
tumour biopsy, preferably after the most recent progression or recurrence was favoured, but archival tissue 
was also accepted.  
PIK3CA mutational status was assessed through analysis of hotspots located in the C2, helical and kinase 
domains of PI3K (corresponding to exons 7, 9 and 20 respectively), which are all critical for PI3K function 
(Zhao 2008). These hotspots, known to increase PI3K function, were anticipated to cover the majority of all 
the PIK3CA mutations identified in HR+ breast cancer patients according to the applicant. However, 
additional mutations of the PIK3CA genes have been reported in ER+ breast cancer patients. A new validated 
next generation sequencing (NGS) testing on additional mutations of baseline tissue samples is under 
development and patients with PIK3CA mutations outside the 11 used for enrolment into Study C2301 have 
been treated in earlier phase studies, showing apparently clinical benefit from alpelisib. In any case, the 
PIK3CA mutations included in Study C2301 (C420R, E542K, E545A, E545D [1635G>T only], E545G, E545K, 
Q546E, Q546R, H1047L, H1047R or H1047Y) have been reflected under section 5.1 of the SmPC to allow the 
clinical physician to identify the mutation included in Study C2301.  
As PIK3CA genomic studies are not included in routine clinical investigations, ctDNA tests could provide a 
good basis for selecting patients in a fast-practical way. The risk of false positive rates for plasma tests was 
clarified, being 8/572 (1.4%) with Novartis Clinical Trial Assay, 6/572 with the QIAGEN therascreen PIK3CA 
RGQ PCR Kit and reduced to 1/210 (0.5%) when the probability of assessing false positive rate for the 
plasma specimen type was assessed against a selected reference method of choice, which was a validated 
NGS assay. According to the applicant, the QIAGEN therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit is CE-IVD marked and 
is available for testing at laboratories in the EU. Hence, the testing strategy proposed by the Applicant is 
acceptable. 
The study was initially intended to analyse efficacy in the whole population set. However, non-clinical and 
clinical data from Study X2101 showed that patients with HR-positive, HER2-negative, PIK3CA non-mutant 
ABC derived much lower, if any, benefit from alpelisib than patients with mutant tumours. Similar 
observations were made in two large Phase III studies of buparlisib, a pan-PI3K inhibitor, in combination with 
fulvestrant (BELLE 2 & 3 trials; Di Leo, 2018). Furthermore, similar trends were observed in patients with 
Assessment report

Page 121/174 
 
  
  
 
PIK3CA-mutant tumours assessed by ctDNA (Baselga, 2017; Di Leo, 2018) a finding also supported by data 
from the combination of alpelisib with letrozole or exemestane (Shah, 2015).  
In total, 1442 patients (1439 women, 3 men) were screened and tested to establish PIK3CA mutation status 
while less than half of them were recruited (n=572 (39.7%)). In nearly all cases, the primary reason for not 
completing the screening phase was screen failure (92.8%). The identification of PIK3CA mutations led to 
more than 800 screening failures and of these, 500 cases were related to either a lack of identification of the 
mutation or a lack of adequate tissue. As the dropout rate was high, further insight into its causes was 
required. The applicant clarified that screen failure in Study C2301 is not equal to diagnostic test failure. Only 
43 specimens did not yield a valid result from the therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit. A relevant number of 
failures (377 subjects, 71.8%) were grouped as non-PIK3CA mutation status identified because they tested 
non-mutant, but the non-mutant cohort was already closed.  
Investigator and patients were blinded to PIK3CA mutational status throughout the trial and the safety in 
both the PIK3CA mutant and non-mutant cohorts were reviewed by the DMC. Since the decision on using the 
PIK3CA non-mutant cohort as proof of concept was taken while the trial team was blinded, the amendment is 
unlikely to have compromised trial integrity. It should be also considered that given the effect of PI3K 
inhibitors on serum glucose levels and on the skin, it is doubtful that blinding was really effective for clinical 
researchers and study patients themselves but little else could have be done in that respect.  
The amendments and protocol violations are deemed unlikely to have a relevant impact on the integrity of 
the study. More patients on alpelisib (20.7% (35 subjects)) received prohibited concomitant medications 
compared to patients on fulvestrant alone (14% (24 subjects)). The most frequently used prohibited 
medications were anti-infective and antiemetic agents (data not shown). This did not apparently affect 
efficacy but it is considered reflective of the increased toxicity with alpelisib. 
The population enrolled in this study generally reflects the population of post-menopausal women with HR-
positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with disease progression on or after AI-based treatment, 
and as such is relevant to the intended target population.  
In both study cohorts (with or without PIK3CA mutation), demographics and baseline disease characteristics, 
ECOG performance status, tumour burden and prior antineoplastic therapy were well balanced between the 
study arms. 
Patients with symptomatic visceral disease or any disease burden making the patient ineligible for endocrine 
therapy were excluded from the study. Section 4.4 of the SmPC adequately reflects that the efficacy and 
safety of alpelisib have not been studied in patients with symptomatic visceral disease. 
The choice of the comparator was discussed in light of the baseline characteristics of the patient population. 
Performance Status was 0 in two thirds of the trial patients and 1 in one third, reflecting a low tumour-
burden population in which most oncologists would agree on further hormonal treatment rather than 
chemotherapy. However, 85.6% of the patients were considered to have endocrine-resistant disease and 
treatment options such as chemotherapy could have been an appropriate option in this setting. Primary 
endocrine resistance (de novo resistance) was observed in 13.2% of patients and secondary endocrine 
resistance (relapse/progression following an initial response) in 72.4% of patients. Nevertheless, fulvestrant 
monotherapy remains a therapeutic option for the population studied and it is acknowledged that endocrine 
resistance is not easy to apprehend in the clinical practice being more a time process than an event. Hence, 
the shortcomings of the trial design mimic real-world challenges. Also, the availability of another therapeutic 
option in a setting immediately before chemotherapy could represent a worthwhile alternative.

According to the wording of the study inclusion criterion “radiological or objective evidence of recurrence or 
progression during or after AI therapy”, AI therapy was not required as last treatment regimen before study 
entry. AI treatment could have been given more than 12 months before progression of disease. Therefore, 
treatment with any endocrine-based therapy after AI therapy could be possible. In fact, 15.2% of the 
patients in the PIK3CA mutant cohort of Study C2301 received tamoxifen as last endocrine therapy 
before/when they had progression of their disease and one patient reported prior therapy with fulvestrant. 
However, this patient received only single fulvestrant monotherapy dose 29 days prior to being randomised 
to the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm (the fulvestrant monotherapy treatment ended due to enrollment into 
Study C2301). In the phase I study X2101, 39 patients reported prior fulvestrant use (up to 180 days of 
treatment in 18 patients). Overall, although data are limited, those data suggest that no significant negative 
impact on efficacy was observed in those patients with heavily pre-treated advanced cancer with a PIK3CA 
mutation who had prior fulvestrant administration. Likewise, from a mechanistically perspective, there would 
not be any reason of such a possibility. Nevertheless, no firm conclusion can be drawn due to the limited 
number of patients with prior fulvestrant use. This has been reflected in the SmPC (see section 4.4 and 5.1). 
A longer duration of last prior hormonal therapy was observed in the adjuvant as compared to the 
therapeutic (metastatic) setting. In the PIK3CA mutant cohort, duration of last hormonal therapy in the 
adjuvant setting for alpelisib arm was longer than for the placebo arm (51.8 vs 41.8 months). However, 
considering mean, Q1-Q3 and range, differences are not considered relevant.  
Study C2301 allowed for the inclusion of males. However, the number of males included is very limited (1 
patient). It is agreed that due to the rarity of this disease in males, it is simply not feasible to produce solid 
evidence of efficacy. However, the biological rationale and the overall treatment experience of male breast 
cancer so far are considered sufficient evidence for an extrapolation of the efficacy of alpelisib to this small 
subgroup (reflected in SmPC 5.1). 
Alpelisib dose selection was based on a single first-in-human phase I clinical trial (Study X2101). Although 
the MTD was found to be 400 mg, the final dose selected for the phase 3 pivotal trial was chosen two dose-
increase steps below (300 mg) based on PK and safety information, which is considered acceptable.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
PFS and OS in PIK3CA mutant cohort 
The final PFS analysis was based on 232 events and a median follow-up time of 20.2 months corresponding 
to 61% of events in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm.  
Study C2301 met its primary objective. Median PFS in patients with PIK3CA-mutations was prolonged by 
5.3 months (from 5.7 to 11.0) for the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm vs the fulvestrant arm (HR 0.65 95% CI 
0.50, 0.85). Further strengthening the results, PFS curves in the Kaplan-Meier plot separated early and hold 
well its separation over time.  
It could be questioned whether chemotherapy would have obtained better results than fulvestrant in this 
setting as the patients were mostly endocrine-resistant. As such using fulvestrant as a comparator may have 
distorted the results in favour of alpelisib. The poor performance of the control arm compared to other trials 
was explained by the large fraction of the study population being endocrine-resistant and as such having 
poorer prognosis.  
Despite the above, the improvement of median PFS from 5.7 months in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm to 
11.0 months in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm (HR=0.65) is considered clinically relevant in this setting.

Updated PFS data were provided with the DCO 30 September 2019. In the PIK3CA mutant cohort, a PFS 
event was reported for 123/169 (72.8%) patients in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm vs. 148/172 (86.0%) 
patients in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. A HR of 0.64 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.81) was observed. Median PFS 
did not change with this update: median PFS was 11.0 months and 5.7 months in the alpelisib plus 
fulvestrant arm and the placebo plus fulvestrant arm, respectively. These results are in line with the previous 
ones. 
As the rate of censoring was high, additional information about the early censored patients and their main 
reasons for censoring was provided. Early censoring for reason other than “ongoing without event” occurring 
up to the fourth tumour assessment were higher for alpelisib than placebo (10.7% vs 4.1%) (data not 
shown). Two additional supplementary analyses addressing the early censoring (censures in fourth tumour 
assessment) were performed: i) 5 patients who discontinued treatment due to physician decision, but with 
investigator comments indicating clinical progression were counted as having PFS events at the time of the 
last adequate assessment; ii) patients who withdrew consent were counted as having PFS event at the time 
of the last adequate assessment. These supplementary analyses showed concordant results (i) HR 0.66 95% 
CI 0.51, 0.86 ii) HR 0.71 95% CI 0.55, 0.91) with those presented in the primary analysis (data not 
presented).  
Further details on patients’ withdrawal were provided. Withdrawals were double in alpelisib arm in 
comparison with placebo (10 (6%) alpelisib vs 5 (3%) placebo). Five of them (4 in alpelisib arm and 1 in 
placebo) had AEs (alpelisib arm: 2 grade 3 hyperglycaemia, 1 grade 3 weight loss and 1 grade 2 rash; 
placebo arm: Grade 3 musculoskeletal pain). Nearly half of the withdrawals were in the first 28 days of 
treatment (5 in alpelisib and 2 in placebo). In the second supplementary analysis on early censoring (see 
previous paragraph), most of the patients who withdrew consent were counted as having PFS event at the 
time of the last adequate assessment. Two patients in alpelisib and 1 in placebo arm with withdrawn consent 
were not considered in that analysis because the withdrawals were after 224 days. HR in this supplementary 
analysis was similar to the primary analysis.  
In another supplementary analysis considering discontinuation of either alpelisib/placebo and/or fulvestrant 
due to AE as treatment failure (PD), the HR of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.69, 1.14) was no longer statistically 
significant indicating no benefit of the addition of alpelisib if discontinuation due to AE is considered a 
negative outcome. However, the fact that patients who discontinue a drug prematurely due to toxicity 
thereby do not achieve the expected benefit is true for any drug. Only if these patients could be identified in 
advance, a loss of chance situation could be considered. In addition, the applicant performed a subgroup 
analysis on patients with or without discontinuation due to an AE. This analysis showed that median PFS for 
alpelisib plus fulvestrant patients was 11.0 months (HR: 0.67, 95% CI: 0.45, 1.02) for those who 
discontinued alpelisib treatment due to an AE and 9.4 months (HR: 0.64, 95%CI: 0.48, 0.86) for those who 
did not. Although the latter analysis could be biased, these results are pointing in the same direction as the 
ITT analysis. 
The audit that compared the investigator-based PFS analysis with a central one conducted in randomly 
selected cases summing up 50% of the total sample was satisfactory and the prespecified thresholds to 
trigger a full 100% review were not met.  
PFS subgroup analyses per investigator assessment by randomisation stratification factors showed a 
consistent treatment effect in favour of the alpelisib arm, irrespective of presence or absence of lung/liver 
metastases (see SmPC section 5.1).

Using a data cut-off date of 12 June 2018, PFS results for the subgroup of endocrine resistant patients 
(HR=0.64; 95% CI: 0.49, 0.85, n=292) and endocrine sensitive patients (HR=0.87; 95% CI: 0.35, 2.17, 
n=39) were in favour of the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm. As the number of endocrine sensitive patients with 
a PIK3CA mutation was limited (n=39), these results should be interpreted with caution (reflected in SmPC 
section 5.1). 
An interesting subgroup analysis refers to the genomic groups. It is reassuring that alpelisib plus fulvestrant 
had the same effect on all PIK3CA-mutant individuals, regardless of the mutation location (exon 9 or exon 
20) or the three main mutations considered.  
The OS results were not yet mature i.e. median OS not reached in the alpelisib arm and 26.9 months in the 
control arm. The event rate was 23.7% in the alpelisib arm and 30.2% in the control arm (92 events in 
total). Updated OS data was submitted with data cut-off of 30-Sep-2019. Percentage of events are 40.8% in 
alpelisib arm and 48.8% in placebo arm, median OS was reached for alpelisib (40.6 months) and placebo 
(31.2 months) arms. HR was 0.77 (95% CI 0.56, 1.06). OS results are still immature. In order to further 
investigate the efficacy of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant in the target population, the MAH will 
submit by 31 August 2022 the final study report of the phase III randomized placebo-controlled study 
SOLAR-1 including interim and final analyses of overall survival (PAES, Annex II condition). 
As a result of a GCP inspection, critical deficiencies were found in one of the investigational sites in Chile, thus, 
the inspectors  recommended  that these  data  were  excluded  from  the  analysis.  Updated  primary  analysis  of 
PFS and OS (using the original cut-off date of 12 Jun 2018) have been provided, excluding the four patients 
from this site in Chile, who were enrolled in the PIK3CA mutant cohort (data not shown). These analysis of PFS 
and OS were consistent with the original analysis. For PFS the HR was 0.63 (95% CI: 0.49, 0.80) and for OS 
the HR was 0.70 (95% CI: 0.46, 1.06). 
Subgroup of patients previously treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors 
Confirmatory trials should reflect the target population to be treated. CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with 
endocrine therapy have become standard of care in the first-line treatment of HR-positive metastatic breast 
cancer. Thus, patients having received prior therapy with CDK 4/6 inhibitors is the most relevant population 
to reflect the target population. However, the total number of subjects pre-treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor 
was predefined to be limited to 30% of the overall study population in the SOLAR-1 study. This was based on 
the concern at the time of the initial protocol, mid-2015, that prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor may 
impact the outcome of subsequent treatment with PI3K inhibitors compared to CDK4/6 inhibitor naive 
subjects.  
The biological plausibility that an inconsistent response might be observed has been based on mechanistic 
considerations and clinical and pharmacological judgement, given the related pathways, unknown impact on 
clinical effects, and experience of unexpected interactions with prior treatments with anti-cancer agents 
acting on related pathways. The recent non-clinical data reporting the activation of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR 
pathway following resistance to CDK4/6 inhibitors and other in vitro observations (Jansen et al., 2017; 
O’Brien et al., 2019; O’Brien et al. 2019) seem to go against this judgment but the relevance of these 
findings in the clinical setting is unknown. Thus, these findings are not sufficient to disregard the biological 
plausibility of an inconsistent treatment effect. 
In summary, it is of interest to verify that the conclusions of therapeutic efficacy apply consistently to the 
subgroup of the clinical trial population consisting of patients pre-treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors because the 
confirmatory trial does not reflect the target population of the claimed indication which mainly consists of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020 
Page 125/174 
 
  
  
 
patients pre-treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors; and there is biological plausibility for an inconsistent treatment 
effect in the patients pre-treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors.  
To this end, the available clinical data are scarce as this was only a small subgroup in the confirmatory study. 
The actual number of patients included who had prior treatment with CDK 4/6 inhibitors was 20 patients, 9 
receiving alpelisib. The limited sample size does not allow drawing any firm conclusions. Regarding the ORR, 
it was noted that no responses were observed in this specific group of patients. 
During the review, the Applicant presented supportive data from cohort A of the BYLieve study, which was a 
single-arm, non-comparative cohort study that included 121 patients previously exposed to CDK4/6 
inhibitors.  The ORR in patients with measurable disease was 21% and the DOR was 6.6 months (95%CI: 
4.3; NE), whereas in the PIK3CA mutant cohort within the SOLAR-1 study,  in patients with measurable 
disease, the ORR in the treatment arm with the combination of alpelisib plus fulvestrant regardless of the 
prior treatment (n=169) was 35.7% (95%CI: 27.4, 44.7) and the DOR 12.6 months (95%CI: 8.5, 18.5).  
However, due to the design of the study BYLieve it is not possible to isolate the contribution of fulvestrant.  
Overall, available efficacy results, if anything, would be indicative of low activity (17.4% ORR in the BYLieve 
study,  cohort  A;  point  estimate  of  3.7  months  difference  in  median  PFS  in  the  SOLAR-1  study).  This  is  in 
agreement with the SAG that concluded that “overall the data available are too sparse to establish efficacy in 
this population for which limited but established treatment options exist” (see further below). In conclusion, 
there  are  insufficient  clinical  data  to  establish  efficacy  in  patients  pre-treated  with  CDK  4/6  inhibitors.  The 
indication has been restricted to patients previously treated with endocrine therapy as monotherapy. 
PFS and OS in PIK3CA-wild type cohort 
As expected for a PI3KCA inhibitor, PFS results indicate a lack of clinical efficacy in PI3KCA wild-type 
tumours. OS data were immature. No further statistical testing of OS data was planned. However, two 
descriptive updates using the data cut-offs of 23-Dec-2016 and 30-Sep-2019 were provided. With the last 
DCO, percentage of events were 51.3% in alpelisib arm and 50.9% in placebo arm, and the median OS was 
reached for the alpelisib (37.3 months 95% CI: 27.89, 45.37) and placebo (34.3% 95% IC: 26.81, 42.41) 
arms. HR was 0.92 (95% CI 0.64, 1.33). These last updated results, with an acceptable maturity, are in line 
with previous analyses.  
Other secondary endpoints 
A perhaps unexpected finding was the effect of the alpelisib-fulvestrant combination on tumour response, 
with an ORR 2.6 times better than fulvestrant plus placebo and a significant fraction of responding patients 
showing >30% tumour shrinkage in the waterfall plots.  
The ORR was improved clinically significantly compared to the control arm ORR 12.8% (SD 36.6% and Non-
CR/non-PD 14.5%). Stabilization of the disease is clinically meaningful as this prolongs the time on an 
endocrine-based regimen and consequently a postponement of use of more toxic anticancer treatments such 
as chemotherapy. 
In clinical practice, chemotherapy is sometimes chosen over endocrine treatment on the grounds of a more 
likely response or faster volume reduction when the disease bulk is related to symptoms or is felt as an 
immediate threat for organ function. The ORR results may be reassuring for practising oncologists indecisive 
between targeted treatment vs conventional chemotherapy in bulky ABC cases when a volumetric response is 
needed.

Duration  of  response  was  determined  in  a  small  sample  size  in  the  placebo  arm  for  an  adequate  treatment 
comparison  (n=9).  Although  difficult  to  assess  from  this  data,  but  the  median  duration  of  response  of 12.6 
months  in  the  responding  patients  is  considered  clinically  meaningful  and  in  line  with  the  PFS  results.  Firm 
conclusions are not possible due to the small sample sizes.  
Time to response results are clinically meaningful and reinforce the ORR conclusions. 
No detrimental effects were observed in PFS2. However, results were initially not mature. Two updated PFS2 
data were provided, which were all consistent. In the last updated data, percentage of events were 62.7% in 
alpelisib  arm  and  69.2%  in  placebo  arm  in  the  mutant  cohort,  thus,  data  can  now  be  considered  relatively 
mature and supportive of the initial conclusion.   
No indication of a detrimental effect on ECOG PS or Global Health Status with alpelisib was observed either. 
This was also confirmed with recent updated data; however, since the safety profile is considered to have 
unblinded the investigators, the PRO data could be biased and should not be included in the SmPC. 
Additional expert consultations 
During  the  CHMP  meeting  on  27  February  2020,  the  CHMP  concluded  that  the  SAG  Oncology  should  be 
consulted  for  their  views  on  whether  efficacy  in  patients  previously  treated  with  CDK  4/6  inhibitors  can  be 
considered as established.  
The SAG Oncology meeting was held on 15 April 2020. The following questions were addressed and the outcome 
of the discussion is presented below. 
1.  The proposed indication wording includes those patients previously treated with CDK 4/6 
inhibitors. However, available clinical data are too sparse to independently establish 
efficacy in such patients.  
Does the SAG consider that available data allow for the extrapolation of a clinically 
meaningful benefit of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant to patients previously 
treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors? 
In the overall population of the SOLAR-1 study, alpelisib+fulvestrant was associated with a modest 
effect on PFS (5.3 months difference in median PFS compared fulvestrant+placebo; HR [95% CI] = 
0.65 [0.50, 0.85]) in patients with a PIK3CA mutation progressing on endocrine-based therapy.(1) 
Currently, no important clinical effect has been observed in term of other important endpoints like OS 
(86% information fraction) and HR-QoL.  
For comparison, possible strategies in patients that progressed on aromatase inhibitor therapy 
(although supporting results are based on trials not selected for PIK3CA mutation), include 
everolimus+fulvestrant (5.2 months difference in median PFS compared fulvestrant+placebo; HR 
[95% CI] = 0.61 [95% CI, 0.40 to 0.92]) (2) and capecitabine, based on the “PEARL” trial where 
after a median 17.64 months of follow-up,  median PFS was 7.4 versus 9.4 months with 
palbociclib/fulvestrant v. capecitabine, respectively. (2019 San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium). 
Concerning the CDK 4/6 inhibitor-pre-treated population, all experts agreed that another therapeutic 
option would be welcome for patients that progressed following previous treatment with CDK 4/6 
inhibitors. This clinical situation is quite relevant given that CDK 4/6 inhibitors are considered as the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020 
Page 127/174 
 
  
  
 
treatment of choice in combination with hormone therapy to treat hormone receptor-positive, HER2-
negative metastatic breast cancer.  
The SAG unanimously agreed that overall the data available are too sparse to establish efficacy in 
this population for which limited but established treatment options exist.1 Indeed, optimality of the 
fulvestrant-alone control arm was questioned when only a small minority of patients (about 12%) 
had disease that could be considered “endocrine sensitive”. Although fulvestrant-alone is a suitable 
choice in some patients, there are other options available, including some that may have a larger 
effect on PFS (see above). 
If anything, the available clinical data from the trial would be indicative of low activity (17.4% ORR in 
the BYLieve study, cohort A; point estimate of 3.7 months difference in median PFS in the SOLAR-1 
study and non-statistically significant difference in PFS).  
Admittedly, no strong signal of a detrimental effect was evident in patients previously treated with 
CDK 4/6 inhibitors, but the interval estimates are so wide that a detrimental effect cannot be ruled 
out with sufficient certainty (the upper 95% confidence limit was 1.36 and 2.06, for PFS and OS HR, 
respectively, in the SOLAR-1 study). Although it is difficult to compare across trials and different 
population selection criteria, and acknowledging the many uncertainties, there are concerns that the 
evidence for benefit of available treatment options like everolimus combinations and capecitabine is 
more convincing than for alpelisib+fulvestrant for which there are very few data (N=9 patients 
treated with alpelisib+fulvestrant in the SOLAR-1 trial). 
The SAG discussed the possibility to substitute data in patients previously treated with CDK 4/6 
inhibitors using external data. The current external comparisons presented on the basis of the 
BYLieve study were of limited value given the small numbers of patients treated, the highly selected 
population, and the limited number of matching variables used.  
A prospective randomized-controlled clinical trial is considered feasible in this population and would 
be expected to provide the most convincing results to address this question. However, given the 
large number of patients treated with the product, there would also be merit in exploring the effect in 
patients previously treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors by collecting real-world data and conducting 
larger matched analyses using an adequate set of variables to maximise comparability against 
standard of care. If such analysis could be sufficient and convincing to establish efficacy will depend 
on the data and results.  
The SAG also commented on other aspects related to this clinical trial, namely, the fact that fresh 
tissue at the time of enrolment was only available for about 8% of patients. Although the good 
correlation with circulating tumour DNA was noted, lack of fresh tissue limits the ability to conduct 
further biomarker analyses, which should be a standard objective of any modern drug development 
according to EMA guidelines. Nevertheless, the ongoing analyses based on archival tissues should be 
submitted to allow better understanding of the impact of genomic alterations on response. 
The SAG also commented on the short duration of follow-up in terms of safety, and the need to 
assess if toxicity in the clinical setting can be managed as well as in clinical trials, especially in the 
1 One expert, classified as “expert witness” based on declared interests, stated that based on personal experience (durable 
responses in some patients), the non-clinical data and rationale, and the scant but coherent clinical data from SOLAR-1 and, in 
particular, the supportive results from the BYLieve study, that overall evidence was sufficient for extrapolating the effect to the 
CDK 4/6 inhibitor-positive population. However, as per the EMA policy on conflict of interests, experts that participate as “expert 
witness” do not participate in the conclusions. Therefore, this view was not included in the answers from the SAG.

context of an expected older target population with a risk for more frequent side effects (e.g., 
gastrointestinal toxicity). 
2.  If further data on the efficacy of Piqray in CDK4/6 experienced patients are considered 
warranted, before or after marketing authorisation what might be a feasible and 
informative study design to establish clinical benefit in this population? 
A prospective randomized-controlled clinical trial v. an appropriate control (e.g., investigator choice) 
is considered feasible in this population and would be expected to provide the most convincing results 
to address this question. Stratification between progression on v. relapsing after CDK 4/6 inhibitor 
should be considered. 
Given the large number of patients treated with the product, there would also be merit in exploring 
the effect in patients previously treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors by collecting real-world data and 
conducting larger matched analyses using an adequate set of variables to maximise comparability 
against standard of care. Appropriate plans and protocols for such analyses should be submitted. 
Further molecular analyses based on fresh tissue prior to treatment and upon progression should be 
considered for a better selection of the target population and to elucidate mechanisms of resistance. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Overall, the use of the combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant in the mutant cohort has shown to delay the 
tumour progression, with no indication of detrimental effect on overall survival and satisfactory 
pharmacodynamic activity. No PFS benefit was observed in patients whose tumours did not have a PIK3CA 
tissue mutation (see SmPC section 5.1). 
However, the efficacy of alpelisib has not been established in the subpopulation of patients who have 
received prior CDK4/6 inhibitors and the indication has been restricted to exclude this group.  
In conclusion, the efficacy is considered established for alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant for patients 
with HR-positive, HER2-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation after 
disease progression following endocrine therapy as monotherapy. 
As OS results are still immature, the CHMP considers the following measure necessary to address issues 
related to efficacy: 
The applicant is required to conduct a post-authorisation efficacy study (PAES) in order to further investigate 
the efficacy and long-term safety of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant in postmenopausal women, and 
men, with hormone receptor positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative, advanced breast 
cancer with a PIK3CA mutation after disease progression following endocrine therapy as monotherapy. The 
applicant should submit the final study report of the phase III randomized placebo-controlled study SOLAR-1 
including interim and final analyses of overall survival by 31 August 2022.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety evaluation is based on data from 825 patients treated in three clinical studies. The primary focus is on 
data from 571 patients treated in the randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase III Study C2301 in 
subjects with HR-positive, HER2-negative ABC, with 284 patients in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant group and 
287 patients in the placebo plus fulvestrant group. In addition, 167 patients were exposed to single-agent 
alpelisib and 87 patients were exposed to alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant in the dose-finding studies 
X2101 and X1101.  
Table 56. Overview of clinical studies that contributed safety data 
As of the 12 June 2018 data cut-off, exposure to the alpelisib plus fulvestrant combination was 2847.3 
subject-months and 2530.4 subject-months to placebo plus fulvestrant The median duration of exposure to 
study treatment was longer in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant group (8.2 months) compared to the placebo plus 
fulvestrant treatment group (5.6 months). In the alpelisib plus fulvestrant treatment group, exposure to 
fulvestrant was longer than to alpelisib (median 8.2 vs. 5.5 months), as patients who discontinued alpelisib 
for reasons other than disease progression were allowed to continue on fulvestrant.  
The median relative dose intensities to alpelisib and placebo were 83.7% and 100%, respectively. Dose 
adjustments (interruptions and/or reductions) were allowed for alpelisib to manage treatment-emergent 
toxicities. No dose modification was permitted for fulvestrant; however, dose interruption was allowed. 
Updated safety data from Study C2301 (cut-off date of 20 Oct 2018 and 30 Sep 2019) are also presented 
below.

GI toxicity 
Table 64. GI toxicity (nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea) AESI - Study C2301 (Safety set) 
Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting were reported in 59.5%, 46.8% and 28.5% of the patients, respectively. 
Grade 2 and 3 diarrhoea events were reported in 19.7% and 7.0% of patients, respectively, with a median 
time to onset of grade ≥2 diarrhoea of 50 days (range: 1 day to 954 days). 
59.5% of patients (n=169) experienced diarrhoea during treatment with Piqray. Grade 3 diarrhoea occurred 
in 7% (n=20) of patients with no reported cases of grade 4. Among patients with grade 2 or 3 diarrhoea 
(n=76), the median time to onset was 50 days (range: 1 to 954 days).  
Severe diarrhoea and clinical consequences, such as dehydration and acute kidney injury, have been 
reported during treatment with Piqray and resolved with appropriate intervention. Antiemetics (e.g. 
ondansetron) and antidiarrhoeal medicinal products (e.g. loperamide) were used in 28/153 (17.6%) and 
109/169 (64.5%) patients, respectively, to manage symptoms. 
Dose reductions of Piqray were required in 5.6% of patients and 2.8% of patients discontinued Piqray due to 
diarrhoea. In the 169 patients who experienced diarrhoea, antidiarrhoeal medications (e.g. loperamide) were 
required to manage symptoms in 64.5% (109/169).

Hyperglycaemia (FPG >160 mg/dl) was reported in 190 (66.9%) patients; grade 2 (FPG 160-250 mg/dl), 3 
(FPG >250-500 mg/dl) and 4 (FPG >500 mg/dl) events were reported in 16.2%, 33.8% and 3.9% of 
patients, respectively.  
Hyperglycaemia occurred more frequently in patients who were diabetic (0 out of 12 patients [0%] with 
grade 1-2, and 10 out of 12 patients [83.3%] with grade 3-4), pre-diabetic (42 out of 159 patients [26.4%] 
with grade 1-2, and 77 out of 159 patients [48.4%] with grade 3-4), had BMI ≥30 at screening (13 out of 
74 patients [17.6%] with grade 1-2, and 38 out of 74 patients [51.4%] with grade 3-4) or ≥75 years of age 
(6 out of 34 patients [17.6%] with grade 1-2, and 19 out of 34 patients [55.9%] with grade 3-4). 
Based on baseline FPG and HbA1c values, 56% of patients were considered pre-diabetic (FPG 
>100-126 mg/dl [5.6 to 6.9 mmol/l] and/or HbA1c 5.7-6.4%) and 4.2% of patients were considered diabetic 
(FPG ≥126 mg/dl [≥7.0 mmol/l] and/or HbA1c ≥6.5%). 74.8% of patients who were pre-diabetic at baseline 
experienced hyperglycaemia (any grade) when treated with alpelisib. Among all patients with hyperglycaemia 
of grade ≥2 (FPG ≥160 mg/dl), the median time to first occurrence was 15 days (range: 5 days to 900 days) 
(based on laboratory findings). The median duration of grade ≥2 hyperglycaemia was 10 days (95% CI: 8 to 
13 days). In patients with grade ≥2 hyperglycaemia, median time to improvement (at least one grade from 
the first event) was 8 days (95% CI: 8 to 10 days). In all patients who continued on fulvestrant after 
discontinuing Piqray, FPG levels returned to baseline (normal). 
Patients with a history of diabetes mellitus intensified use of antidiabetic medicinal products while on 
treatment with Piqray.

Table 65. Hyperglycaemia AESI - Study C2301 (Safety set) 
In the 190 patients with hyperglycaemia, 87.4% (166/190) were managed with antidiabetic medication, and 
75.8% (144/190) reported use of metformin as single agent or in combination with other antidiabetic 
medication (e.g. insulin, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, SGLT2 inhibitors and sulfonylureas). 
Oral antidiabetic medication was used in 154 patients. Out of these 154 patients, 17 (11.0%) discontinued 
study treatment due to hyperglycaemia. Concomitant insulin medication was used in 54 patients; of these 13 
(24.1%) discontinued study treatment due to hyperglycaemia. 
Out of 162 patients with grade ≥2 hyperglycaemia, 155 had at least 1 grade improvement, median time to 
improvement from the first event was 8 days (95% CI: 8 to 10 days). 
Of the patients with elevated FPG who continued fulvestrant treatment after discontinuing Piqray (n=58), 
98.3% (n=57) had FPG levels that returned to baseline.

Rash 
Rash events (including rash maculopapular, macular, generalised, papular and pruritic, dermatitis and 
dermatitis acneiform) were reported in 153 (53.9%) patients. Rash was predominantly mild or moderate 
(grade 1 or 2) and responsive to therapy, and in some cases rash was accompanied by pruritus and dry skin. 
Grade 2 and 3 events were reported in 13.7% and 20.1% of patients, respectively, with a median time to 
first onset of 12 days (range: 2 days to 220 days). 
Among patients who received prophylactic anti-rash treatment including antihistamines, rash was reported 
less frequently than in the overall population; 26.1% vs 53.9% for all grades, 11.4% vs 20.1% for grade 3, 
and 3.4% vs 4.2% for rash leading to the permanent discontinuation of Piqray.

Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) 
ADRs from the phase III clinical study and post-marketing experience are listed by MedDRA system organ 
class. Within each system organ class, the ADRs are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions 
first. Within each frequency grouping, ADRs are presented in order of decreasing seriousness. In addition, the 
corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following convention: very 
common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare (≥1/10,000 to 
<1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available data).

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Table 74. Overview of deaths and other serious or clinically significant adverse events – Studies 
C2301 (data cut-off 12 June 2018), X2101 and X1101 (Safety set) 
Deaths 
In the pivotal study, 78 patients (27.5%) in the alpelisib arm and 91 patients (31.7%) in the placebo arm 
died in total (cut-off date 12 Jun 2018), and of the 78 deaths in the alpelisib arm, 74 were due to progression 
of the underlying disease. The remaining four deaths were due to thrombotic microangiopathy, sepsis, 
cardio-respiratory arrest, and second primary malignancy. Overall, there were more deaths in the placebo 
arm of the pivotal study and 4 deaths were not due to progression of the underlying disease. Despite the 
death due to thrombotic microangiopathy could have been related to treatment, it occurred 25 days after the 
last dose of study treatment at a time of disease progression and the risk of the event was also influenced by 
concomitant medication. The death due to sepsis is not considered to be related to treatment as it occurred 
10 months after the last dose of study treatment. The two remaining deaths from cardio-respiratory arrest 
and second primary malignancy are also not considered to be treatment-related. No deaths in the placebo 
arm were treatment-related. Overall, the 3 patients who died from fatal SAEs in the pivotal study were not 
treatment-related. There were no treatment-related deaths in the phase 1 study.  
In a safety update (cut-off date 20 Oct 2018), the total number of deaths increased to 96 (33.8%) in the 
alpelisib plus fulvestrant group, and 101 (35.2%) in the placebo plus fulvestrant group. Of the 18 additional 
post-treatment deaths in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant group, 16 deaths were due to breast cancer / disease 
progression. The two remaining additional post-treatment deaths were due to septic shock and unknown 
cause. Both deaths occurred more than a year after the last dose of study drug.

In a second safety update (cut-off date 30 Sep 2019), the total number of deaths (i.e. including those that 
occurred more than 30 days after the last dose of study drug) was 128 (45.1%) in the alpelisib plus 
fulvestrant group, and 142 (49.5%) in the placebo plus fulvestrant group. Most of these deaths were due to 
the study indication (119 (41.9%) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant group, and 128 (44.6%) in the placebo 
plus fulvestrant group).  
Table 75. On-treatment deaths – Study C2301 (Safety set) 
Among the 87 patients treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant in the supportive phase 1 study X2101, a total 
of seven deaths were reported; five of these deaths occurred on treatment (i.e. within 28 days after the end 
of study treatment). All deaths occurred in the alpelisib 400 mg plus fulvestrant dose group. Of the five on-
treatment deaths, four deaths were due progression of the underlying disease. One patient died of an 
unknown cause, nine days after a CT scan revealed progressive disease. None of these deaths were 
suspected to be related to the alpelisib plus fulvestrant combination treatment.

Table 80. Overview of AEs by age group – Study C2301 (Safety set) – DCO 30 September 2019 
In patients ≥65 years of age treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant, there was a higher incidence of grade 3-4 
hyperglycaemia (45.3%) compared to patients <65 years of age (33.5%), while in patients <75 years of age, 
grade 3-4 hyperglycaemia was 36% compared to 55.9% in patients ≥75 years of age.

Dose reductions and dose interruptions due to AEs 
Adverse events requiring dose reduction (alpelisib/placebo) and/or interruption (either alpelisib/placebo or 
fulvestrant, or both) were reported in 78.5% of subjects in the pelisib plus fulvestrant group compared to 
22.6% in the placebo plus fulvestrant group. In the alpelisib plus fulvestrant group dose reductions/dose 
interruptions were most frequently due to hyperglycaemia (38.4%), diarrhoea (13.7%), and skin-related 
events (rash [12.7%], rash maculo-papular [10.2%]).

2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The clinical safety data submitted in support of this marketing authorisation application consisted of the 
whole set of patients included in Study C2301 (SOLAR-1), pooling both PIK3CA-mutant and non-mutant 
cohorts, and data from the dose-finding studies X2101 and X1101.   
As of the 12 June 2018 data cut-off, the median duration of exposure for the study treatment was 
8.2 months in the alpelisib arm and 5.6 months in the placebo arm. However, median exposure for alpelisib 
only was 5.5 months. The median relative dose intensities of alpelisib and placebo were 83.4% and 100%, 
respectively. During the procedure, updated safety data with a longer follow-up were provided (DCO 20 Oct 
2018; 30 Sep 2019). As of the 30 September 2019 data cut off, approximately, 28% of patients were 
exposed to alpelisib for at least 12 months and around 13% of patients for at least 24 months. Overall, the 
safety profile of alpelisib plus fulvestrant at the DCO 30 Sep 2019 remained consistent with the previous 
safety update (DCO 20 Oct 2018) and with the original submission (DCO 12 Jun 2018). 
In spite of the lack of shared toxicities between PIK3 inhibitors and fulvestrant, dose interruptions more than 
doubled in the experimental arm and dose reductions were multiplied by a factor 8. 
In marked contrast with less-specific PIK3 inhibitors, there were no reports of hepatic and neuropsychiatric 
safety issues which suggest that the higher selectivity of alpelisib may be successful. However, this may 
change with updated safety data with relevant exposure. The applicant will provide further long-term safety 
data with the final CSR of SOLAR-1 study (see Annex II condition). 
The combination of alpelisib plus fulvestrant was more toxic than fulvestrant monotherapy. Treatment-related 
grade 3 and 4 AEs were six times as frequent (66.9% vs. 11.8%), and SAEs doubled (36.6% vs. 18.8%), 
requiring significantly more treatment discontinuations (26.1% vs. 5.6%) and dose modifications (79.2% vs. 
23%) (DCO 30 Sep 2019). 
AEs of any grade reported in over 20% of cases with alpelisib plus fulvestrant therapy in Study C2301 
(DCO30 Sep 2019) were, in order of the difference magnitude between arms (alpelisib vs. placebo): weight 
decreased (27.8% vs. 2.4%), hyperglycaemia (64.8% vs. 9.4%), rash (36.3% vs. 7%), stomatitis (25% vs. 
7%), diarrhoea (59.5% vs. 16.4%), decreased appetite (35.9% vs. 10.5%), vomiting (28.5% vs. 10.1%), 
nausea (46.8% vs. 22.6%), asthenia (22.2% vs. 13.6%), and fatigue (25% vs. 17.8%). Most serious issues 
were diarrhoea, rash and hyperglycaemia, all of them reaching grade 3 in a significant fraction of patients 
and being responsible for the vast majority of treatment delays and dose modifications. The grade 4 AE 
registered in more patients was hyperglycaemia, with eleven cases in the alpelisib arm (11 [3.9%] alpelisib 
vs. 1 [0.3%] placebo) (DCO 30 Sep 2019). 
The safety profile of fulvestrant monotherapy is well known and data from the pivotal trial is consistent with

Adverse events of special interest included gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity, hyperglycaemia, rash, 
hypersensitivity, pancreatitis, pneumonitis, severe cutaneous reactions and osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ). 
Osteonecrosis of jaw (ONJ) was reported in a high number of patients in the alpelisib arm compared to the 
placebo arm (16 [5.6%] vs 5 [1.7%]). All these events, except one in the placebo group, occurred in patients 
who had received concomitant therapy with bisphosphonate or denosumab (prior or after initiation of study 
drug) (130 [45.8%] in the alpelisib arm and 136 [47.4%] in the placebo arm). While the contribution of 
alpelisib to the development of ONJ is not completely clear, an increased risk of development of ONJ cannot 
be excluded in patients receiving alpelisib and bisphosphonates. ONJ is included as a common adverse drug

reaction in section 4.8 of the SmPC and as an important identified risk in the RMP. The risk of ONJ falls under 
the primary objective of safety in the European study CBYL719A0IC02 included as a category 3 study in the 
RMP. Furthermore, a warning has been included in section 4.4 of the SmPC to inform that caution should be 
exercised when Piqray and bisphosphonates or denosumab are used either simultaneously or sequentially. 
Piqray treatment should not be initiated in patients with ongoing osteonecrosis of the jaw from previous or 
concurrent treatment with bisphosphonates/denosumab. Patients should be advised to promptly report any 
new or worsening oral symptoms (such as dental mobility, pain or swelling, non-healing of mouth sores, or 
discharge) during treatment with Piqray. In patients who develop osteonecrosis of the jaw, standard medical 
management should be initiated (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Rash and GI toxicities were not dissimilar to what is commonly experienced with several anti-cancer targeted 
agents. Although both were more common in the alpelisib arm (six-fold and two-fold, respectively), most 
cases were grade 1 or 2 and rarely the cause for discontinuation. Nevertheless, cases of severe cutaneous 
reactions, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) and erythema multiforme (EM), were reported in 
patients treated with alpelisib in clinical studies. In study C2301, SJS and EM were reported in 1 (0.4%) and 
3 (1.1%) patients, respectively. Moreover, drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) 
has been reported in the post-marketing setting (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 4.8). Severe cutaneous 
reactions are included as an important identified risk in the risk management plan (RMP). Section 4.8 of the 
SmPC has also been updated to reflect that serious hypersensitivity reactions (including anaphylactic reaction 
and anaphylactic shock), manifested by symptoms including, but not limited to, dyspnoea, flushing, rash, 
fever or tachycardia, were reported in patients treated with alpelisib in clinical studies (see SmPC section 
4.8).  
Patients should be advised of the signs and symptoms of severe cutaneous reactions (e.g. a prodrome of 
fever, flu-like symptoms, mucosal lesions or progressive skin rash). If signs or symptoms of severe 
cutaneous reactions are present, alpelisib should be interrupted until the aetiology of the reaction has been 
determined. Appropriate treatment should be promptly initiated (see SmPC section 4.4). A consultation with 
a dermatologist is recommended. If a severe cutaneous reaction is confirmed, Piqray should be permanently 
discontinued. Piqray should not be re-introduced in patients who have experienced previous severe 
cutaneous reactions. If a severe cutaneous reaction is not confirmed, Piqray may require treatment 
interruption, dose reduction or treatment discontinuation as described in Table 3 of the SmPC (see SmPC 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Furthermore, alpelisib treatment should not be initiated in patients with a history of severe cutaneous 
reactions (see SmPC section 4.4).  
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients is also a contraindication (see SmPC 
section 4.3). 
With regards to the event of rash, among patients who received prophylactic anti rash treatment including 
antihistamines, rash was reported less frequently than in the overall population. Accordingly, oral 
antihistamine administration may be considered prophylactically, at the time of initiation of treatment with 
Piqray. Additionally, antihistamines are recommended to manage symptoms of rash. Furthermore, topical 
corticosteroid treatment should be initiated at the first signs of rash and oral corticosteroids should be 
considered for moderate to severe rashes. Based on the severity of rash, Piqray may also require dose 
interruption, reduction or discontinuation as described in Table 3 of the SmPC (see SmPC sections 4.2 
and 4.8).

Two patients suffered from diarrhoea and associated dehydration, which may have contributed to the 
development of acute kidney injury. In both cases, the treatment was temporarily interrupted, and the 
events resolved, but this was a potentially fatal situation. GI toxicity was observed to a similar extent in the 
supportive phase 1 study. This type and severity of GI toxicity is considered to have adverse clinical impact 
on the patient’s well-being and require adequate monitoring. Based on the severity of the diarrhoea, Piqray 
may require dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation as described in the SmPC (see SmPC sections 4.2 
and 4.4). Patients should be advised to start antidiarrhoeal treatment, increase oral fluids and notify their 
physician if diarrhoea occurs while taking Piqray. 
Hyperglycaemia is the main safety issue to be considered. Severe hyperglycemia, including ketoacidosis, has 
been reported in patients treated with Piqray. In the SOLAR-1 study, FPG and HbA1c security thresholds were 
not only built into the inclusion criteria but modified twice on the safe side in subsequent protocol 
amendments (amendment 1 and 2).  
There was no separate study for type 2 diabetic patients, a clear group of interest given the high incidence 
and severity of hyperglycaemic events in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm. As patients with an established 
diagnosis of diabetes mellitus type I or uncontrolled type II were excluded in Study C2301, it is reflected in 
the SmPC under section 4.4 that the safety of alpelisib in these patients has not been established. Patients 
with a medical history of Type 2 diabetes were included. The SmPC reflects that patients with a history of 
diabetes mellitus may require intensified diabetic treatment and should be closely monitored. 
It appeared early in many cases and occurred in nearly 65% of the patients, reaching grade 3 or 4 in half of 
them despite specific treatment instituted in 52.8% of the affected patients plus dose interruptions and 
modifications in around 50% of the subjects. SAEs were observed in 30 patients (10.6%). The most frequent 
medication used was metformin (87.1%) and various types of insulin (31.9%). An oral treatment such as 
metformin is often more feasible than injections with insulin; however, metformin is associated with 
increased risk or worsening of diarrhoea, which is particularly harmful for patients on alpelisib due to the 
already high risk of diarrhoea. There were no deaths attributable to hyperglycaemia, complications such as 
ketoacidosis were exceptional but permanent discontinuation of treatment related to hyperglycaemia 
happened in 19 patients (6.7%), being the leading cause for treatment discontinuation.  
The alpelisib-induced hyperglycaemia was reversible upon discontinuation of alpelisib treatment. In the 
setting of a clinical trial, this event may be manageable; however, in the clinical setting, hyperglycaemia and 
related events may be fatal if not timely diagnosed and treated. Baseline diabetic and pre diabetic status, 
baseline BMI ≥30 and baseline age ≥75 years have been found to be risk factors for hyperglycaemia and 
high-grade hyperglycaemia in patients treated with alpelisib. These risk factors were present in 74.7% of 
patients with any grade of hyperglycaemia and in 86.2% of patients with grade 3 or 4 hyperglycaemia. These 
numbers have been reflected in the SmPC under the headline hyperglycaemia in section 4.2, as they are very 
informative for both the treating physician and the patient. Furthermore, additional precautionary measures, 
monitoring, and handling of the risk of hyperglycaemia have been included in the product information (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). Dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation based on the severity of the 
hyperglycaemia are described in Table 2 of the SmPC. 
As hyperglycaemia may occur with a rapid onset after starting treatment, it is recommended to self-monitor 
frequently in the first 4 weeks and especially within the first 2 weeks of treatment, as clinically indicated. A 
specific schedule for fasting glucose monitoring is recommended in Table 6 of the SmPC. All patients should 
be instructed on lifestyle changes that may reduce hyperglycaemia (e.g. dietary restrictions). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020 
Page 156/174 
 
  
  
 
Patients should also be advised of the signs and symptoms of hyperglycaemia (e.g. excessive thirst, urinating 
more often than usual or greater amount of urine than usual, increased appetite with weight loss). 
In addition to routine risk minimisation measures, a prescribers’ guide providing further guidance for the 
prevention and management of hyperglycaemia will be distributed to further minimise this risk (see RMP). 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities are included in the RMP to further characterise the risk of 
hyperglycaemia. Study CBYL719C2402 is a retrospective cohort study in the US to evaluate the risk of 
hyperglycaemia in patients with advanced breast cancer treated with Piqray (alpelisib) in the real-world 
setting (Category 3 study in RMP). Next to this US based study on hyperglycaemia, study BYL719A0IC02 will 
be conducted in the EU to investigate general safety and risk of hyperglycaemia of alpelisib. This is an open-
label, multicentre, Phase IIIb study to evaluate the safety and tolerability of alpelisib in combination with 
fulvestrant for the treatment of men and post-menopausal women with hormone receptor-positive (HR+), 
HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation, after disease progression following an 
endocrine-based regimen (Category 3 study in RMP). 
Pancreatitis, hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions were subjected to increased supervision, but no 
worrying issues were observed. These risks have been reflected in the SmPC. 
Pneumonitis, including serious cases of pneumonitis/acute interstitial lung disease, have also been reported 
in alpelisib treated patients in clinical studies. Patients should be advised to report promptly any new or 
worsening respiratory symptoms. In patients who have new or worsening respiratory symptoms or are 
suspected to have developed pneumonitis, alpelisib treatment should be interrupted immediately and the 
patient should be evaluated for pneumonitis. A diagnosis of non-infectious pneumonitis should be considered 
in patients presenting with non-specific respiratory signs and symptoms such as hypoxia, cough, dyspnoea, 
or interstitial infiltrates on radiological examination and in whom infectious, neoplastic and other causes have 
been excluded by means of appropriate investigations. Alpelisib should be permanently discontinued in all 
patients with confirmed pneumonitis (see SmPC section 4.4). 
Deaths and SAEs were investigated in a pooled set combining data from studies C2301, X2101 and X1101. A 
review of the deaths did not identify any worrisome pattern. Most deaths were due to disease progression. 
Out of the pooled safety analysis of 725 patients, there was only a doubtful case of alpelisib-related death, an 
event of thrombotic microangiopathy reported in one patient in study C2301. The investigator considered this 
event may be related to study treatment, however since other contributing factors were present a clear 
relationship with alpelisib+fulvestrant treatment cannot be established. 
Serious AEs were twice as frequent in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant group relative to the placebo plus 
fulvestrant group in Study C2301. But, except for hyperglycemia (9.9%), the incidence of specific individual 
SAEs was under 3% for both groups and under 1.5% when only grade 3/4 SAEs were considered. 
Clinical chemistry abnormalities were mostly low-grade and/or evenly distributed in both arms, except for 
higher incidence of grade 3 hyperglycaemia in the alpelisib arm. Other laboratory abnormalities that occurred 
more frequently in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant group (≥10% difference) were increases in creatinine (66.9% 
vs 24.7%), increases in lipase (41.9% vs 25.4%) and decreases in potassium (13.7% vs 2.8%). Those 
abnormalities were mostly grade 1 or 2 and not related to SAEs, need for specific treatments, dose 
interruptions or dose modifications. 
More patients in the alpelisib arm developed low haemoglobin (+12.4%), low platelets (+7.8%), and 
increased APTT (+5.4%). The haematological toxicity is related to the alpelisib treatment but is within an 
acceptable level. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020 
Page 157/174 
 
  
  
 
Patients discontinued study treatment in a very high number of cases in the alpelisib arm (25.4% vs. 4.5%), 
most frequently due to hyperglycaemia (6.3%), rash (3.2%), diarrhea (2.8%), and fatigue (2.1%). It is 
noted that only half of the AEs leading to discontinuation were of high grade, leading to an assumption that 
maybe in these cases, it was the sum of several AEs and/or the required treatment for an AE (e.g. anti-
diabetic medicine), that led to the discontinuation. In addition, most events were solved/reversible by 
discontinuation of alpelisib. 
As only adults were included in the clinical studies, there are no safety data in children aged 0-18 years old. 
Piqray is indicated in men and postmenopausal women and is not to be used in women who are, or may be, 
pregnant or breast feeding (see SmPC sections 4.1 and 4.6). Females of reproductive potential should be 
advised that animal studies and the mechanism of action have shown that alpelisib can be harmful to the 
developing foetus. Embryo-foetal development studies in rats and rabbits have demonstrated that oral 
administration of alpelisib during organogenesis induced embryotoxicity, foetotoxicity and teratogenicity (see 
SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3). In case females of reproductive potential take Piqray, they should use effective 
contraception (e.g. double barrier method) when taking Piqray and for at least 1 week after stopping 
treatment with Piqray.  
Male patients with sexual partners who are pregnant, possibly pregnant or who could become pregnant 
should use condoms during sexual intercourse while taking Piqray and for at least 1 week after stopping 
treatment with Piqray. 
There are no data from the use of alpelisib in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown reproductive 
toxicity (see SmPC section 5.3). Therefore, alpelisib is not recommended during pregnancy and in women of 
childbearing potential not using contraception. The pregnancy status of females of reproductive potential 
should be verified prior to starting treatment with Piqray. 
It is not known if alpelisib is excreted in human or animal milk. Because of the potential for serious adverse 
reactions in the breast-fed infant, it is recommended that women should not breast-feed during treatment 
and for at least 1 week after the last dose of Piqray (see SmPC section 4.6). 
The adverse reactions associated with overdose have been consistent with the safety profile of Piqray and 
included hyperglycaemia, nausea, asthenia and rash. General symptomatic and supportive measures should 
be initiated in all cases of overdose where necessary. There is no known antidote for Piqray (see SmPC 
section 4.9). 
As fatigue or blurred vision during treatment have been reported with Piqray, this could affect the ability to 
drive or use machines (see section 4.8). 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the SmPC. 
Furthermore, adequate recommendations have been included in the SmPC with regards to the management 
of severe or intolerable adverse drug reactions (ADRs) which may require temporary dose interruption, 
reduction, and/or discontinuation. If dose reduction is required, the dose reduction guidelines for ADRs are 
listed in Table 1 of the SmPC. A maximum of 2 dose reductions are recommended, after which the patient 
should be permanently discontinued from treatment with Piqray. Dose reduction should be based on the 
worst preceding toxicity. As discussed further above additional tables (Tables 2-5) summarise the 
recommendations for dose interruption, reduction or discontinuation of Piqray in the management of specific 
ADRs. The clinical judgement of the treating physician, including confirmation of laboratory values if deemed 
necessary, should guide the management plan of each patient based on the individual benefit/risk 
assessment for treatment with Piqray.

2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant is significantly more toxic than endocrine treatment but 
presumably less than chemotherapy, which is the treatment most study patients would probably have 
received if not included in the trial. In general terms, toxicity may be manageable, provided careful attention 
is paid to hyperglycaemia-related issues and GI toxicity such as diarrhoea, both in the selection of patients 
and during treatment.

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.3 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR cycle with the 
international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 24 May 2019. The new EURD list entry will therefore use the IBD to 
determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant compared the structure of alpelisib with active substances contained in authorised medicinal 
Assessment report

products in the European Union and declared that it is not a salt, ester, ether, isomer, mixture of isomers, 
complex or derivative of any of them.  
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers alpelisib to be a new active substance as it is not a 
constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the European Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Piqray (alpelisib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU. 
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication was for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and men with HR-positive, HER2-
negative, advanced breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation in combination with fulvestrant after disease 
progression following an endocrine-based regimen. 
The aim of therapy in this setting is to reduce symptoms and prolong life while preserving quality of life. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Endocrine therapy is the treatment of choice for patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer (ABC). 
Endocrine therapies include selective ER modulators (tamoxifen), selective nonsteroidal aromatase inhibitors 
(letrozole and anastrozole), steroidal AIs (exemestane), and ER antagonists (fulvestrant). It may be given in 
first, second, or later lines of therapy for advanced breast cancer (NCCN 2018, ESMO Guideline). Progressive 
disease ultimately develops in all patients, either due to primary resistance or relapse/progression following 
an initial response.  
De novo or acquired endocrine resistance remains an unsolved clinical issue. Once ABC progresses to 
hormonal 1st line there are basically three options to choose from: 1) switch to another not previously used 
endocrine-based treatment, 2) proceed to chemotherapy or 3) turn to one of the novel targeted therapy-
based combinations. 
Two targeted strategies are now commercially available in the EU for the treatment of women with locally 
advanced or metastatic HR-positive HER2-negative BC after a previous endocrine treatment: cyclin-
dependent kinase (CDK) 4/6 inhibitors (palbociclib, ribociclib and abemaciclib), and inhibitors of the 
mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) (everolimus). CDK 4/6 inhibitors are approved in combination with 
either an aromatase inhibitor or fulvestrant, while mTOR-inhibitor everolimus is only approved in combination 
with the aromatase inhibitor AI exemestane. 
The targeted patient population has a rather good prognosis despite the palliative setting with no chance of 
curability, as the median OS is approximately 42 months (Gobbini EJC 2018). This means that some of these 
patients with advanced breast cancer, especially those with bone metastases only, may survive for more than 
10 years. As this disease ultimately causes death within a limited number of years, there exist an unmet 
medical need for new treatment options, especially treatments that can prolong time on endocrine-based 
regimens. Nevertheless, it should be kept in mind that numerous treatment options already exist for this 
patient population. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The main evidence in support of this application is a randomized, double-blind, international, multicentre 
placebo-controlled phase III study (SOLAR-1) evaluating alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant for the 
treatment of men and postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative advanced 
breast cancer who progressed on or after aromatase inhibitor treatment.

3.2.  Favourable effects 
In the pivotal study SOLAR-1, treatment with alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant prolonged PFS (as 
assessed by the investigator) in patients with PIK3CA mutant advanced breast cancer (n=341), with hazard 
ratio (HR) 0.65 (95% CI: 0.50, 0.85; p-value: 0.00065). The median PFS was 11.0 months (95% CI: 7.49, 
14.52) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm versus 5.7 months (95% CI: 3.65, 7.36) in the placebo plus 
fulvestrant arm, with a difference in median of 5.3 months between arms.  
These results were supported by a blinded independent central review (BIRC), performed on a randomly 
selected subset of 50% of randomised patients with a HR of 0.48 (95% CI: 0.32, 0.71) and a median PFS of 
11.1 months (95% CI: 7.33, 16.76) in the alpelisib versus 3.7 months (95% CI: 2.07, 5.55) in the placebo 
arm. 
OS data are immature with 27% events (23.7% events in the experimental arm and 30.2% events in the 
control arm). However, no detrimental effect is observed based on the available data.  
ORR in the subset of patients with measurable disease at baseline (n=262) was 35.7% (95% CI: 27.4, 44.7) 
and 16.2% (95% CI: 10.4, 23.5), in the experimental and control arm, respectively. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
OS data are immature. In order to further investigate the efficacy alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant in 
the target population, the MAH will submit the final study report of the phase III randomized placebo 
controlled study SOLAR-1 including interim and final analyses of overall survival by 31 August 2022 (PAES). 
Patients included in the study SOLAR-1 should have radiological or objective evidence of recurrence or 
progression during or after AI therapy. It is noted that patients included in the pivotal trial for alpelisib were 
generally endocrine-resistant (87% are considered resistant to prior endocrine therapy). Almost no patients 
previously exposed to fulvestrant were included in the phase III trial. However, in the supportive study 
X2101, a few patients with measurable disease at baseline and previously treated with fulvestrant obtained a 
partial response from the alpelisib-based treatment, which could support the idea that the previous exposure 
to fulvestrant would not impair the antitumor activity of the combination of alpelisib-fulvestrant. Likewise, 
from a mechanistically perspective, there would not be any reason of such a possibility. Nevertheless, no firm 
conclusion can be drawn due to the limited number of patients with prior fulvestrant use. This has been 
reflected in the SmPC (see SmPC section 4.4 and 5.1). 
Furthermore, in the SOLAR-1 study the total number of patients pre-treated with a CDK4/6 inhibitor was 
predefined to be limited to 30% of the overall study population based on the concern at the time of the initial 
protocol, mid-2015, that prior treatment with a CDK4/6 inhibitor may impact the outcome of subsequent 
treatment with PI3K inhibitors compared to CDK4/6 inhibitor naive subjects. In total, only 20 patients with 
prior CDK 4/6 inhibitors treatment were included in the SOLAR-1 study (9 patients in the alpelisib arm and 11 
patients in the control arm) hampering any conclusion on the efficacy of alpelisib in combination with 
fulvestrant in this subgroup. Further data were provided from cohort A of the BYLieve study which included 
121 subjects previously exposed to CDK4/6 inhibitors. In this cohort, in patients with measurable disease, 
the ORR was 21%and the DOR was 6.6 months (95%CI: 4.3; NE), whereas in the PIK3CA mutant cohort 
within the SOLAR-1 study in patients with measurable disease, the ORR in the treatment arm with the 
combination of alpelisib plus fulvestrant regardless of the prior treatment (n=169) was 35.7%(95%CI: 27.4, 
44.7) and the DOR 12.6 months (95%CI: 8.5; 18.5). Due to the design of the study BYLieve it is not possible 
to isolate the contribution of fulvestrant, so efficacy in this sub-population is not considered established.

Overall, there is insufficient evidence to conclude on the efficacy of alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant in 
patients previously treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors. For that reason, it is recommended to restrict the 
indication restricted to patients previously treated with endocrine therapy as monotherapy. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the most commonly reported AEs in patients treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant were plasma 
glucose increased (79.2%), creatinine increased (67.6%), diarrhoea (59.5%), gamma glutamyltransferase 
increased (53.2%), rash (51.8%), lymphocyte count decreased (55.3%), nausea (46.8%), alanine 
aminotransferase increased (44.0%), anaemia (44.0%), fatigue (43.3%), lipase increased (42.6%), 
decreased appetite (35.9%), stomatitis (30.3%), vomiting (28.5%), weight decreased (27.8%), 
hypocalcaemia (27.8%), plasma glucose decreased (26.8%), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) 
prolonged (22.2%) and alopecia (20.4%).  
Grade 3-4 AEs were reported by 77.5% of patients in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm compared to 36.6% of 
patients in the placebo plus fulvestrant arm. Hyperglycaemia (37% vs. 1%) and diarrhoea (7% vs. 0.7%) 
were the most frequent Grade 3-4 AEs in the alpelisib group. 
SAEs were reported by 36.6% of patients treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant and 18.8% of those that 
received placebo plus fulvestrant. In the alpelisib arm most of the SAEs were considered treatment-related 
(22.5% vs. 1.7%, experimental and control arm, respectively).  
With regard to deaths, 78 (27.5%) patients in the experimental arm and 91 (31.7%) patients in the control 
arm died (cut-off date 12 Jun 2018). The majority of deaths were due to disease progression in both 
treatment arms (74 and 79, respectively). Of the remaining deaths, 4 (1.41%) in the alpelisib arm and 12 
(4.18%) in the placebo arm were due to other cause. Of these 4 deaths in the alpelisib arm, 2 occurred post 
treatment (thrombotic microangiopathy, which was suspected to be related to study treatment, and sepsis) 
and the other 2 deaths occurred while on-treatment (cardio-respiratory arrest and second primary 
malignancy). In a safety update (cut-off date 20 Oct 2018), the total number of deaths increased to 96 
(33.8%) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant group, and 101 (35.2%) in the placebo plus fulvestrant group. Of the 
18 additional post-treatment deaths in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant group, 16 deaths were due to breast 
cancer / disease progression. The two remaining additional post-treatment deaths were due to septic shock 
and unknown cause. Both deaths occurred more than a year after the last dose of study drug. In a second 
safety update (cut-off date 30 Sep 2019), the total number of deaths was 128 (45.1%) in the alpelisib plus 
fulvestrant group, and 142 (49.5%) in the placebo plus fulvestrant group. Most of these deaths were due to 
the study indication (119 (41.9%) in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant group, and 128 (44.6%) in the placebo 
plus fulvestrant group). 
Discontinuations due to AEs were required in 26.1% of patients treated with alpelisib plus fulvestrant 
compared with 5.6% of patients that received placebo plus fulvestrant. In the alpelisib arm, hyperglycaemia 
(6.3%), rash (3.2%), diarrhoea (2.8%) and fatigue (2.1%) were the main AEs that led to treatment 
discontinuation. Additionally, 79.2% and 23% of patients in the alpelisib and placebo group, respectively, 
required dose reductions or dose interruptions. 
Overall, the main AEs for alpelisib considered of special interest were hyperglycaemia, rash and severe 
cutaneous reactions, gastrointestinal toxicity, hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, pancreatitis and 
pneumonitis. In the alpelisib arm, 66.9% of patients had a hyperglycaemia AESI, which were grade 3 for 
33.8% and grade 4 for 4.6% of the patients. SAEs were observed in 30 patients (10.6%). Hyperglycaemia 
required medication or therapy for 58.1% and lead to permanent discontinuation in 6.3%.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/321881/2020 
Page 165/174 
 
  
  
 
It is noted that less than half of the patients (41.2%) could avoid anti-diabetic treatment in case of 
hyperglycaemia. The alpelisib-induced hyperglycaemia was reversible upon discontinuation of alpelisib 
treatment. 
Skin-related events were observed in 72.9% of patients in all grades and events of grade 3/4 in 22.2% of the 
patients treated with alpelisib. Cases of SJS and EM were reported in 1 (0.4%) and 3 (1.1%) of patients 
treated with alpelisib, respectively. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Tolerability of alpelisib treatment in combination with fulvestrant appears to be low based on the high rate of 
discontinuations (a quarter of the patients discontinued study drug in the study SOLAR-1), which might be 
higher in the clinical setting.  
Safety with long-term use is limited and has been included as missing information in the RMP. Long-term 
safety assessment will be provided with the final CSR of study C2301. 
Additionally, there was no separate study for type 2 diabetic patients, a clear group of interest given the high 
incidence and severity of hyperglycaemic events in the alpelisib plus fulvestrant arm. Moreover, patients with 
type 1 diabetes or those with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes were not included in the clinical trial. This 
information has been reflected in the SmPC, section 5.1.

Notes: a Efficacy data were estimated in the Full Analysis Set, PIK3CA mutant cohort (n=341). b Safety data are based on 
the 571 patients treated in study SOLAR-1 (Data cut-off: 30 Sep 2019) 
3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant has demonstrated a clinically relevant delay in progression free 
survival in the PIK3CA mutant cohort in comparison to fulvestrant alone. This was supported by several 
sensitivity analyses as well as by the higher antitumor activity shown in the combination arm versus the 
monotherapy group.  
Considering the limited number of patients with prior treatment based on CDK4/6 inhibitors included in the 
pivotal study, this does not provide direct evidence for clinical benefit in such patients. The extrapolation of 
efficacy is questionable based on the outcomes of the single arm study BYLieve, in patients with prior CDK4/6 
experience. The objective response rate and duration of response observed in this study, cannot be readily 
translated into clinical benefit, and would not have supported such an inference on their own; contrariwise, 
they are indicative that the efficacy of fulvestrant and alpelisib may be considerably reduced in the post 
Assessment report

CDK4/6 setting, and it is not clear that the B/R would be positive. Therefore, available data do not support an 
indication covering patients with PIK3CA mutation previously treated with CDK 4/6 inhibitors. 
From a safety point of view, tolerability of alpelisib plus fulvestrant seems to be low, according to the high 
rate of discontinuations, mainly due to hyperglycaemia. Hyperglycaemia, GI toxicity and skin-related events 
are adverse events of special interest related to alpelisib. Overall, the combination of alpelisib and fulvestrant 
is considered to be significantly more toxic than endocrine treatment but presumably less than chemotherapy 
which is the treatment most study patients would probably have received if not included in the trial.  
In general terms, toxicity may be manageable, provided careful attention is paid to hyperglycaemia-related 
issues and GI toxicity such as diarrhoea, both in the selection of patients and during treatment.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Alpelisib in combination with fulvestrant leads to a longer PFS in HR-positive, HER2-negative, locally 
advanced or metastatic breast cancer patients with a PIK3CA mutation in the ITT population. While this 
clinically meaningful benefit may be extrapolated to patients having progressed on any endocrine therapy 
given in monotherapy, based on limited data and mechanistic rationality, efficacy has not been established in 
the subpopulation of patients who previously have received CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with endocrine 
therapy.  
Overall, the favourable effects are considered to outweigh the risks associated with the treatment of alpelisib 
in combination with fulvestrant in patients previously treated with endocrine therapy in monotherapy. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Considering the limited efficacy data available in patients pre-treated with CDK4/6 inhibitors as well as the 
outcome of the BYLieve study, a positive benefit-risk has not been established in this sub-population, which 
has thus been excluded from the recommended indication. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Piqray in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment of postmenopausal women, and 
men, with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative, 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation after disease progression following 
endocrine therapy as monotherapy, is positive. 
Divergent position is appended to this report. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by majority decision 
that the benefit-risk balance of Piqray is favourable in the following indication:

- 
- 
Piqray is associated with an increased risk of hyperglycaemia. 
Patients at higher risk (diabetic, pre-diabetic, FPG >250 mg/dl, BMI ≥30, or age ≥75 years) 
need consultation with a healthcare professional experienced in the treatment of 
hyperglycaemia. 
The patient’s current antidiabetic treatment might be affected by the treatment with alpelisib 
through interaction with oral antidiabetics metabolised by CYP2C9 and CYP2C8 (including, but 
not limited to, repaglinide, rosiglitazone, glipizide and tolbutamide). 
Test for FPG and HbA1c and optimise the patient’s level of blood glucose before starting 
treatment with alpelisib. 
Counsel patients with regard to the risk of hyperglycaemia, need for lifestyle changes, signs and 
symptoms of hyperglycaemia (e.g. excessive thirst, urinating more often than usual or greater 
amount of urine than usual, increased appetite with weight loss; difficulty breathing, headache, 
nausea, vomiting) and the importance of immediately contacting a healthcare professional if 
symptoms occur. 
During treatment 
- 
- 
- 
Follow the schedule for monitoring fasting glucose according to the Piqray label. Please note

DIVERGENT POSITION DATED 28 May 2020 
Piqray EMEA/H/C/004804/0000 
The undersigned members of the CHMP did not agree with the CHMP’s positive opinion recommending the 
granting of the marketing authorisation of Piqray indicated in combination with fulvestrant for the treatment 
of postmenopausal women, and men, with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2)-negative, locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with a PIK3CA mutation after 
disease progression following endocrine therapy as monotherapy. 
The reason for divergent opinion was the following: 
• 
• 
• 
The positive B/R of Piqray was established in the primary analysis population of the SOLAR-1 study, 
including patients previously treated with endocrine therapy. The number of patients included in the 
study that had received endocrine therapy in combination with a CDK4/6 inhibitor is small, and does 
not allow for an independent inference of efficacy in this subpopulation. However, there are no known 
mechanisms of resistance that would indicate that the efficacy demonstration for Piqray in the 
primary analysis would not be relevant to such patients. 
Furthermore, data from the single arm BYlieve study are available in the post CDK4/6 setting. 
Antitumoral activity in this study is not outstanding, and the BYlieve study could not independently 
have established the efficacy of Piqray. However, activity in terms of ORR appears similar to that 
seen for other drugs for which benefits on PFS and/or OS have been established in RCTs of the 
treatment of metastatic breast cancer. 
In conclusion, the indication of Piqray should not be limited to those patients that have not received a 
CDK4/6 inhibitor in combination with prior endocrine therapy.

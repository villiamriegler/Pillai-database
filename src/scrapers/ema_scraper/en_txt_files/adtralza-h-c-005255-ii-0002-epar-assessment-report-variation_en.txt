2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
Adolescents, atopic dermatitis  
Atopic dermatitis (AD) is the most common inflammatory skin disease in the developed world. It is more 
common in paediatric populations than in adults, with the 1-year prevalence in adolescents estimated to 
be approximately 15–20%. Although AD usually presents as mild disease in the paediatric population, 
around 10–30% of children with AD have moderate-to-severe disease. 
Disease signs and symptoms in moderate-to-severe AD are characterised by intense itch, xerosis, and 
recurrent eczematous skin lesions. In children from 2 years of age to puberty, AD typically involves the 
flexural surfaces of the extremities, head, neck, wrists, and ankles. 
In adolescents and adults, eczematous changes are typically seen on the head and neck, flexural surfaces 
of the extremities, and hands and feet. These signs and symptoms cause substantial morbidity and have 
a serious impact on the psychological wellbeing and health-related quality of life in affected children and 
their families. Compared with adolescents who do not have AD, adolescents with AD are at higher risk of 
the most common psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety, and this risk increases with 
increasing AD severity. Furthermore, children with AD are at higher risk of learning disabilities – with 
potential lifelong implications for health, educational, and social outcomes – and this risk also increases 
with increasing AD severity. An important treatment goal for patients in this vulnerable period of life is 
therefore to also improve their psychosocial wellbeing and ability to function in daily life. 
The MAH’s initially claimed therapeutic indication was:

Adtralza is indicated for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult and adolescent 
patients 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Epidemiology  
Atopic  dermatitis  (AD)  is  a  chronic  inflammatory  skin  disorder  that  typically  occurs  during  childhood 
especially in the first year of life, with a variable frequency from 10% to 30%. Recent studies have shown 
that  in  Europe  among  10–20%  of  children  with  AD  suffer  from  this  disorder  also  in  adolescence.  AD 
prevalence in adolescence has been estimated around 5–15% in European countries. 
Biologic features, Aetiology and pathogenesis 
The pathogenesis of AD is a complex interplay between genetic predisposition, the environment, skin barrier 
dysfunction,  and  immune  dysregulation.  The  immune  dysregulation  is  predominantly  driven  by  Th2 
lymphocytes  that  can  be  found  in  abundance  in  AD  skin  lesions  together  with  increased  levels  of  Th2-
derived cytokines, such as IL-13.   
IL-13 is a cytokine with a prominent role in the altered immune response in AD. IL-13 is overexpressed in 
lesional  and  non-lesional  skin  in  patients  with  AD  compared  to  normal  skin,  and  both  IL-13  mRNA 
expression and protein levels correlate with disease severity. Correspondingly, sub-clinical inflammation, 
including increased IL-13 mRNA and skin barrier function impairment are also seen in non-lesional skin in 
subjects with AD, compared with that seen in normal skin. IL-13 plays a prominent role in inflammation, 
epidermal  barrier  dysfunction  and  pathogen  persistence  in  lesional  skin,  as  IL-13  acts  directly  on 
keratinocytes to: stimulate keratinocytes to secrete chemokines and cytokines that attract more immune 
cells  and  amplify  the  inflammatory  response,  which  further  disrupts  the  skin  barrier  by  reducing  the 
expression  of  skin  barrier  proteins  and  lipids;  increase  pathogen  persistence  by  down-regulating  the 
production of antimicrobial peptides, such as beta-defensin and cathelicidin. Although IL-13 is believed to 
increase pathogen persistence by down-regulating the production of antimicrobial peptides, studies have 
shown that these defence molecules are increased in AD skin and correlate with disease severity. These 
molecules have pro-inflammatory properties by inducing the production of IL-4, IL-13, and IL-31, thereby 
contributing to the pathogenesis of AD. Finally, IL-13 activates itch signalling by stimulating peripheral itch-
sensory neurons. 
These  effects  of  IL-13  have  a  complex  interplay.  Decreased  barrier  function  and  pathogen  persistence 
facilitates  allergen  and  pathogen  entry  into  the  skin,  which  causes  additional  immune  activation  and 
inflammation. IL-13 also drives IgE production and contributes to mast cell activation, and once allergens 
are cross-linked to IgE on the mast cell surface, histamine release and itch are further induced. This leads 
to a vicious cycle of itch-induced scratching, leading to mechanical skin barrier defects that facilitate entry 
of more antigens and pathogens, thereby promoting further immune activation. Skin infections are a major 
complication  for  patients  with  moderate-to-severe  AD.  A  compromised  skin  barrier  function  and  a  Th2-
dominated immune response are considered risk factors that contribute to the susceptibility to both viral 
and  bacterial  infections,  which  patients  with  AD  are  prone  to.  In  addition  to  these  factors,  80-100%  of 
patients with AD are colonised with S. aureus on active lesions, whereas only 5-30% of normal individuals 
are  colonised  with  S.  aureus.  On  the  individual  level,  S.  aureus  colonisation  can  lead  to  S.  aureus  skin 
infections (impetigo and cellulitis) and worsening of AD. Viral infections (herpes simplex and pox virus) are 
more common in patients with AD, and eczema herpeticum, a severe widespread infection of herpes simplex 
virus, is mainly seen in patients severely affected by AD.

Clinical presentation and diagnosis  
Patients with moderate-to-severe AD report symptoms such as itch, excessive dryness or scaling, red or 
inflamed skin, blisters or bumps, and open  sores or oozing. All these symptoms can be  debilitating  and 
associated  with  pain,  sleep  disturbance,  and  impaired  social  functioning.  The  patient  burden  of  disease 
relates directly to the physical signs and symptoms of disease (e.g. pruritus and pain) as well as indirectly 
to the harmful impact of skin symptoms on sleep (e.g. difficulty falling asleep, more frequent awakenings, 
prolonged awakenings and fragmented sleep), mental health, concentration, physical activity and sedentary 
behaviour, activities of daily living, performance at school and work, increased number of sick days and 
missed days of work. 
More than half of patients with moderate-to-severe AD have been reported to suffer from depression and 
anxiety.  Emotional  distress  resulting  from  AD,  such  as  embarrassment,  low  self-esteem,  and  difficulties 
establishing and maintaining relationships, is also frequently reported. One in two adults with severe AD 
report that AD causes them to avoid social interaction because of their appearance and that AD impacts 
their  activities  quite  a  bit  or  a  great  deal.  Furthermore,  AD  can  be  a  very  time-consuming  condition  to 
manage. Patients can spend over an hour each day on their treatment regimens. 
In  the  Global  Burden  of  Disease  Study  2013,  skin  diseases  were  the  fourth  largest  cause  of  disability 
worldwide with dermatitis, including AD, being the most burdensome skin disease. 
Management 
Standard treatment for AD in adolescents is similar to that in adults, typically progressing in accordance 
with disease severity from mild topical anti-inflammatory therapy to high-potency topical therapy and in 
some cases systemic immunomodulatory therapy. 
Panel 1 Current therapies approved for atopic dermatitis in paediatric patients, by 
region/country, disease severity, and age group 
TCS and TCI have limited efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe disease. High-potency TCS, as well 
as systemic therapies except for the newer biologics and JAK inhibitors, are reserved for severe disease 
and  are  associated  with  significant  safety  concerns,  especially  in  children  and  when  used  long-term. 
Cyclosporine, for instance, has common and severe side effects such as nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and 
hypertension.  Cyclosporine  is  therefore  only  approved  for  the  treatment  of  severe  AD  and  is  only 
recommended  for  patients  where  the  expected  clinical  benefit  outweighs  the  risk  of  side  effects.  Some

drugs in the JAK inhibitor drug class, including upadacitinib and ruxolitinib, have a black box warning by 
the FDA about increased risk of serious infections, heart-related events, cancer, blood clots and death. 
As  AD  is  a  heterogenous, chronic  disease  characterised  by  flares  and  exacerbations,  multiple  treatment 
options  are  necessary  for  adequate  long-term  disease  management.  Dupilumab  is  currently  the  only 
selective immunomodulating biologic therapy available for the treatment of AD in adolescents. However, 
some patients have inadequate response or unacceptable side effects with dupilumab. Hence, there is a 
need for additional well-tolerated treatments that target the underlying cause of AD and offer long-term 
disease control without intolerable side effects. 
2.1.2.  About the product 
Tralokinumab 150 mg solution for injection was approved by the European Commission on 17-Jun-2021 
under the name of Adtralza for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adult patients, who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. The recommended dosage of tralokinumab in adults is an initial dose of 
600 mg followed by 300 mg administered every 2 weeks by SC injection. Tralokinumab can be used with 
or without TCS. 
Tralokinumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to the type 2 cytokine 
interleukin-13 (IL-13) and inhibits its interaction with the IL-13 receptors. Tralokinumab neutralises the 
biological activity of IL-13 by blocking its interaction with the IL-13Rα1/IL-4Rα receptor complex. IL-13 is 
a major driver of human type 2 inflammatory disease, such as atopic dermatitis and inhibiting the IL-13 
pathway with tralokinumab in patients’ decreases many of the mediators of type 2 inflammation.  
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
ECZTRA 6 was conducted in accordance with the PIP (EMEA-001900-PIP02-17), as agreed with the PDCO. 
Meetings to discuss the PIP were held with the PDCO on 28-Sep-2017 and 07-Sep-2018.  
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP 
The data supporting the use of tralokinumab in adolescents derive from 1 pivotal trial and 2 supportive 
trials, as outlined below. The applicant stated that the trials were conducted in accordance with the ICH 
guidance on GCP. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
As a monoclonal antibody, tralokinumab is exempt from testing in accordance with the current CHMP 
guideline (CHMP/SWP/4447/00) on environmental risk assessment. 
2.2.2. Conclusions on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
• 
Tabular overview of clinical studies  
Supportive trials: 
•  ECZTEND  –  an  ongoing  phase  3  extension  trial  in  subjects  with  moderate-to-severe  AD,  including 
adolescent subjects who completed ECZTRA 6 and who will receive tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W open-label 
in ECZTEND. As this trial is ongoing, only information on exposure, SAEs, and AEs leading to permanent 
discontinuation of IMP for the adolescent subjects transferred from ECZTRA 6 is included in this application 
as additional long-term safety data. The data cut-off for the safety data from ECZTEND is 31-Mar-2021. 
•  CD-RI-CAT-354-1054  –  a  completed  phase  1  trial  in  adolescent  subjects  with  asthma  who  received  a 
single dose of tralokinumab 300 mg. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Tralokinumab is a fully human IgG4 monoclonal antibody that specifically neutralises the IL-13 cytokine by 
inhibiting the interactions with the IL-13 receptors. The target population in this submission is adolescent 
subjects  with  moderate-to-severe  atopic  dermatitis  (AD).  The  intended  route  of  administration  of 
tralokinumab is SC injection. 
The  recommended  dosage  of  tralokinumab  in  adults  is  an  initial  dose  of  600  mg  followed  by  300  mg 
administered every 2 weeks by SC injection. The same dose is proposed for adolescent patients with AD. 
To  date,  data  on  the  clinical  pharmacology  of  tralokinumab  in  adolescent  subjects  are  available  from  2 
completed clinical trials, which are included in this assessment. In addition, the PK data from these 2 trials 
have been incorporated into the previously developed population PK model that was based on data from 
adult subjects. 
• ECZTRA 6 – a phase 3 trial in adolescent subjects with moderate-to-severe AD who received tralokinumab 
(300  mg  or  150  mg)  or  placebo  for  up  to  52  weeks.  The  clinical  pharmacology  evaluation  in  this  trial 
included PK (tralokinumab trough concentrations), PD (key AD biomarkers), and immunogenicity (ADA). 
• CD-RI-CAT-354-1054 – a phase 1 trial in adolescent subjects with asthma who received a single dose of 
tralokinumab  (300  mg).  The  clinical  pharmacology  evaluation  in  this  trial  included  PK  profiling  (rich 
sampling) and immunogenicity (ADA).

The bioanalytical methods used in the trials for the present application were the same as those previously 
assessed for the initial application. 
ECZTRA 6 (LP0162-1334) 
This was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group trial in  adolescent subjects with 
moderate-to-severe AD who are candidates for systemic therapy. The trial design is shown in Panel 2.  
Panel 2 Trial design of ECZTRA 6 
Serum samples for assessment of tralokinumab trough concentrations were collected at Week 4, 16, 28, 
52 and 66. Samples for assessment of ADA were collected at the same time points as well as at Week 0. 
Results 
A  total  of  276  subjects  received  at  least  1  dose  of tralokinumab.  The  demographic  data  were  generally 
similar across treatment groups. In the full analysis set, 57% of the subjects were white, 25% were Asian, 
and 11% were Black or African American. Most of the subjects were not Hispanic or Latino, and just over 
half were male. The median age was 15.0 years (mean: 14.6; SD: 1.7), the mean body weight was 61.5 
kg (SD: 17.4, range: 30–144), and the mean BMI was 22.9 kg/m2 (SD: 5.3, range: 14.3–57.6). 
Pharmacokinetics 
An initial loading dose of tralokinumab (600 mg for the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group and 300 mg for 
the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group) was given at Week 0.  Panel 3 shows the geometric mean trough 
concentrations of tralokinumab over time for the different dosing regimens.

ECZTRA 6 
Panel 3 ECZTRA 6 – mean trough concentrations of tralokinumab after subcutaneous dosing 
every 2 or 4 weeks for up to 52 weeks, shown by initial treatment (150 mg or 300 mg): safety 
analysis set 
For the subjects receiving tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W in the initial treatment period (left side of Panel 3), 
tralokinumab serum concentrations had reached steady state by Week 16. The geometric mean trough 
concentration at the previous sampling time point at Week 4 was close to that at Week 16, owing to the 
initial loading dose at baseline. For the responders who were re-randomised at Week 16 to maintenance 
treatment with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W, the trough concentration remained stable throughout the 
maintenance period (filled blue squares). For the responders who were re-randomised to Q4W, the trough 
concentration was approximately halved by the next sampling time point at Week 28 (open green 
squares), consistent with linear PK. Conversely, for the tralokinumab 150 mg non-responders who were 
transferred at Week 16 to open-label tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W (open blue circles), the trough 
concentration was approximately doubled by Week 28 and was similar to the concentrations in the other 
subjects receiving 300 mg Q2W (right side of the Panel 3). 
For the subjects receiving tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W in the initial treatment period (right side of Panel 
3), the pattern in the initial and maintenance treatment periods was similar to that described above, with 
trough concentrations approximately the double of those in the corresponding tralokinumab 150 mg 
groups. A divergence from this expected pattern was the low trough concentration at Week 52 in the 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W group. This result could be due to the small number of subjects. Furthermore, 
for the tralokinumab 300 mg non-responders who were transferred at Week 16 to open-label

tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W, the mean trough concentrations were slightly lower than the trough 
concentrations for tralokinumab responders receiving tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
For the subjects receiving placebo in the initial treatment period who transferred at Week 16 to open-
label tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W (i.e. placebo non-responders), the mean concentrations at Week 28 and 
Week 52 were comparable with those for tralokinumab 300 mg non-responders. 
Comparison between adolescents and adults 
The steady-state trough concentration in the tralokinumab 300 mg group was higher in ECZTRA 6 than 
that in the tralokinumab phase 3 monotherapy trials in adult subjects, ECZTRA 1 and ECZTRA 2. The 
geometric mean serum concentration of tralokinumab 300 mg at Week 16 in the adolescent and adult 
monotherapy trials were: 
• 105.7 μg/mL (CV: 39.0%, n=97) in ECZTRA 6 (adolescents). 
• 88.4 μg/mL (CV: 66.1%, n=602) in ECZTRA 1 (adults). 
• 90.7 μg/mL (CV: 59.3%, n=592) in ECZTRA 2 (adults). 
The difference is most likely related to the lower mean body weight in adolescents than in adults, which is 
consistent with the known relationship between tralokinumab exposure and body weight: steady-state 
exposure decreases with increasing body weight. 
Immunogenicity 
During the initial treatment period, 7 (7.1%) of the  subjects treated with tralokinumab 150 mg, none of 
the subjects treated with tralokinumab 300  mg,  and  2 (2.1%) of the subjects treated with placebo had 
treatment-emergent ADA. 
During the entire trial, 20 (7.3%) tralokinumab-treated subjects had a treatment-emergent ADA response, 
which  was  persistent  for  4  (1.5%)  subjects,  indeterminate  for  10  (3.6%)  subjects,  and  transient  for  6 
(2.2%)  subjects.  1  (0.4%)  tralokinumab-treated  subject  had  treatment-boosted  ADA.  2  (2.1%)  of  the 
tralokinumab-naïve subjects had  a treatment-emergent ADA response, which was indeterminate in both 
cases.  
2 (0.7%) tralokinumab-treated subjects tested positive for nAb, which was deemed not to have an impact 
on the PK, efficacy, or safety of tralokinumab for these subjects.  
Comparison between adolescents and adults 
The main ADA findings in ECZTRA 6 are summarised in  
Panel  4, along with those reported in the  integrated immunogenicity evaluation for  the adult  population 
based on the ADA ECZTRA analysis set (covering ECZTRA 1, 2, 3, and 5). Owing to the low number of ADA-
positive subjects in ECZTRA 6, it is not meaningful to compare the incidence for tralokinumab 150 mg and 
tralokinumab 300 mg in the initial treatment period.

Panel 4 Anti-drug antibodies in ECZTRA 6 ADA ECZTRA analysis set 
For all subjects with positive ADA status, ADA titres were generally low, ranging from <10–320 in 
ECZTRA 6 and from <10–640 in the ADA ECZTRA analysis set. Among tralokinumab-treated subjects, 2 
(0.7%) subjects in ECZTRA 6 and 19 (1.0%) subjects in the ADA ECZTRA analysis set tested positive for 
nAb. 
Thus, the immunogenicity results observed for the adolescent subjects in ECZTRA 6 are comparable with 
those reported for the adult population. The proportion of subjects with treatment-emergent ADA is 
higher in ECZTRA 6, including for placebo-treated subjects. ADA titres and the rate of nAb are similarly 
low in the adolescent and adult trial populations and were deemed not to have an impact on the PK, 
efficacy, or safety of tralokinumab. 
Study CD-RI-CAT-354-1054 
This was an open-label, single-dose trial to evaluate the PK profile of a single SC dose of tralokinumab 
300 mg in adolescent subjects with asthma. Immunogenicity was assessed as a secondary objective. 
Blood samples were collected over the first 24 hours (immediately predose and 3, 8, and 24 hours ± 30 
minutes post-dose), then on Days 4, 6, 8, and Weeks 2, 3, 5, and 8. 
PK parameters were calculated using non-compartmental methods.

20 subjects were dosed and completed the trial. All subjects were white and 70% were male. The median 
age was 14.5 years (mean: 14.2; SD: 1.8), the mean body weight was 61.3 kg (SD: 16.0, range: 40.2–
93.5), and the mean BMI was 21.6 kg/m2 (SD: 4.1, range: 16.2–32.6).

The PK data were presented for all 20 subjects as well as for the 2 age cohorts, which included 10 subjects 
aged 12–14 years and 10 subjects aged 15–17 years. The mean concentration–time profile was consistent 
across the 2 cohorts, with slightly higher systemic exposure (mean Cmax and AUC values) in the younger 
group. This was most likely related to a lower mean body weight in the younger group (55.8 vs 66.8 kg). 
Table 1 Summary of Pharmacokinetic Parameters (PK Population) 
Comparison between adolescents and adults 
The geometric mean Cmax was 50.8 μg/mL (SD: 18.9, n=20) and the median tmax was 5 days (range: 
3–9 days) after a single SC dose of tralokinumab 300 mg, similar to the corresponding values observed in 
healthy adult subjects (trial CAT-354-0703). The systemic exposure, as assessed by Cmax and AUC, was 
higher in the adolescents than in the adults, which is most likely related to the lower mean body weight in 
the adolescents. The other PK parameters in the adolescent population in CD-RI-CAT-354-1054 (Panel 6) 
were broadly similar to those in the adult population. 
Immunogenicity 
All post-dose samples were negative for ADA following administration of tralokinumab.

The previously developed population PK model for the initial MAA, based on data from 10 clinical studies in 
adult subjects, was updated to include data from adolescent subjects in ECZTRA 6 and CD-RI-CAT-354-
1054.  
Population PK modelling of tralokinumab was performed using a non-linear mixed effect modelling approach 
in NONMEM 7.4. The covariate model building was repeated for the updated analysis using an automated 
stepwise covariate modelling (SCM) approach. All covariates found to be statistically significant during the 
SCM  approach  were  evaluated  for  clinical  relevance  based  on  the  same  criteria  as  those  defined  in  the 
original analysis.  
The following covariates considered for the analysis were demographic factors (age, sex, body weight, race, 
and ethnicity), disease status (healthy, asthma, or AD), disease severity (baseline EASI score), and trial-
related factors (concentration of drug formulation and ECZTRA trials versus other [‘non-ECZTRA’] trials). 
Age group (adolescent, adult) as a covariate on CL and V2 or F was also included evaluated. 
The predictive performance of the final population PK model was evaluated by generation of goodness-of-
fit diagnostic plots, visual predictive checks (VPCs), and statistical significance (objective function value). 
No simulations with the final model were performed. 
Results 
The dataset for the updated population PK model was based on 2,857 subjects dosed with tralokinumab, 
of whom 296 were adolescents. Data exclusions were documented. Likelihood-based methods for 
handling BLQ values were not used because the number of samples BLQ was <10% of the total samples 
in the dataset. 
The final popPK model was a 2-compartment model with first-order absorption and elimination. All PK 
parameters were estimated with high precision (RSE<20%). Inter-individual variability on CL and V2 was 
moderate (30.7% and 38.3%, respectively). The degree of shrinkage for IIV on CL and V2 was acceptable 
(7% and 29%, respectively). 
During the stepwise covariate search, all covariates that were identified as statistically significant in the 
original adult model were also significant in the updated model. These were: body weight, age, baseline 
EASI score, eGFR, sex (female), race (Asian and BAA), ethnicity (Hispanic or Latino), dilution of dose, 
disease type (asthma), and non-ECZTRA trials. Of these, only body weight on clearance (CL and Q) and 
volume (V2 and V3), non-ECZTRA trials on CL and V2, and concentration of drug formulation on F and ka 
were deemed clinically relevant predictors of tralokinumab exposure, which was in line with the results for 
adults. However, as both non-ECZTRA trials and concentration of drug formulation are extrinsic factors 
related to the drug development process, these covariates do not have any relevance for the future 
clinical use of the tralokinumab 150 mg/mL solution.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
ECZTRA 6 (LP0162-1334) 
Sampling time points for PD assessments were as follows: 
• 
• 
In blood: serum biomarkers and whole blood mRNA biomarkers at Week 0 and 16; serum IgE at 
Week 0, 8, 16, 28, 52 and 66. 
In skin: skin tape strip samples for biomarkers of skin barrier function and skin inflammation at 
Week 0, 8 and 16; trans-epidermal water loss (TEWL) at Week 0 and 16; skin swabs for analysis 
of Staphylococcus aureus abundance and skin microbiome at Week 0 and 16. 
Results 
Serum biomarkers 
The serum levels of the key AD disease biomarkers CCL17, IgE and IL-22 decreased in both tralokinumab 
dose groups relative to the levels in the placebo group during the initial treatment period. The reduction in 
all 3 biomarkers was of a clinically relevant magnitude, and no dose-dependent pattern was observed. 
The  concentration  of  CCL17  (TARC)  was  reduced  by  0.50  NPX  units  during  16  weeks  of  treatment  with 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W (Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test, p<0.001; Week 16 vs placebo) and by 0.55 NPX 
units during 16 weeks of treatment with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W (p<0.001). In placebo-treated subjects, 
the level of CCL17 increased by 0.20 NPX units (median values). 
The serum levels of IgE were reduced from 1768 IU/mL at baseline to 1565 IU/mL at Week 8 and 1472 
IU/mL at Week 16 in subjects treated with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W (p<0.001). In subjects treated with 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W, serum IgE levels were reduced from 2467 IU/mL at baseline to 1779 IU/mL at

Week 8 and 1550 IU/mL at Week 16 (p<0.001). Serum IgE levels in placebo-treated subjects increased 
from 1846 IU/mL to 2007 IU/mL at Week 8 and 2121 IU/mL at Week 16 (median values). 
The serum levels of IL-22 were reduced from 17.8 mg/mL at baseline to 14.8 pg/mL at Week 16 (p=0.90) 
during 16 weeks of treatment with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and from 22.6 pg/mL at baseline to 18.1 
pg/mL  at  Week  16  (p=0.52)  in  subjects  treated  with  tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W.  In  placebo-treated 
subjects the IL-22 serum level was reduced from 34.3 pg/mL at baseline to 21.1 pg/mL at Week 16 (median 
values). 
Comparison between adolescents and adults 
The change from baseline up to Week 16 in serum levels of CCL17, IL-22, and IgE is shown for ECZTRA 6 
and ECZTRA 1 in Panel 10. In ECZTRA 6, CCL17 and IL-22 were reduced to a lesser extent than in ECZTRA 
1, whereas IgE was reduced to a similar extent.  
Panel 10 Comparison of serum biomarkers in ECZTRA 6 and ECATRA 1: ratio of tralokinumab 
(150 mg or 300 mg) to placebo – relative change from baseline up to Week 16 
Whole blood mRNA biomarkers 
The effect of tralokinumab treatment on mRNA expression in whole blood samples was marginal with 
changes generally below 10% from baseline. 
Biomarkers of skin barrier function in tape strip samples 
At baseline, lesional skin had higher median levels of short-chain (C14-C18) and lower median levels of 
long-chain (C22-C32) ceramides and lysophosphatidylcholines compared with non-lesional skin. This is 
consistent with the expected shift in molecular species towards shorter-chain molecules in AD stratum 
corneum. Furthermore, the levels of natural moisturising factors (PCA, cis-UCA, and trans-UCA) were 
lower in lesional skin compared with non-lesional skin. Together, this indicates a reduced skin barrier 
integrity in lesional AD skin. 
In both tralokinumab dose groups, the levels of short-chain lipids in lesional skin decreased from baseline 
to Week 16, and long-chain lipids increased, relative to the levels in the placebo group. Similarly, the 
level of natural moisturising factors (filaggrin metabolites) increased in both tralokinumab dose groups. 
Although the analyses were based on a limited number of subjects (approximately 20–30 per treatment 
group) from selected trial sites, these data support a shift in stratum corneum lipid composition in 
lesional skin towards that of non-lesional skin following tralokinumab treatment. 
Skin barrier function – Transepidermal water loss (selected trial sites) 
The treatment effect was most pronounced in lesional skin compared to non-lesional skin, which was 
expected as the barrier integrity is higher in non-lesional skin and consequently the TEWL was about 50% 
lower in non-lesional skin compared to lesional skin at baseline. However, the low number of subjects (6

subjects in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group, 4 in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group, and 3 in the 
placebo group) and the large intra-individual variation in this assessment did not allow a meaningful 
statistical analysis between the groups. 
Staphylococcus aureus abundance in skin 
The absolute abundance of S. aureus at baseline was low in all 3 treatment groups (median levels <200 
gene copies/cm2 in lesional skin and <36 gene copies/cm2 in non-lesional skin). In both tralokinumab 
dose groups, the median levels decreased markedly from baseline to Week 16 in both lesional and non-
lesional skin. 
In lesional skin the abundance of S. aureus was reduced from 166.2 to 1.1 gene copies/cm2 (median 
values) during 16 weeks of treatment with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and from 144.4 to 1.1 gene 
copies/cm2 in subjects treated with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. In subjects receiving placebo the S. 
aureus gene copy number was reduced from 200 to 38.4 gene copies/cm2 from baseline to Week 16. The 
changes in the tralokinumab groups were not statistically different compared with placebo. 
In non-lesional skin the abundance of S. aureus was reduced from 16.7 to 1.1 gene copies/cm2 (median 
values) during 16 weeks of treatment with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and from 35.1 to 1.1 gene 
copies/cm2 in subjects treated with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. In subjects receiving placebo the S. 
aureus gene copy number was not reduced (18.4 and 19.7 copies/cm2 at baseline and Week 16, 
respectively). The changes in the tralokinumab groups were higher than for placebo (p=0.038 for 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W; p=0.001 for tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W). 
Comparison between adolescents and adults 
In ECZTRA 6, the absolute abundance of S. aureus in lesional skin at baseline was markedly lower than 
that observed in adult subjects in ECZTRA 1 (median of 166 gene copies/cm2 in the tralokinumab 300 mg 
group  in  ECZTRA  6  vs  969  gene  copies/cm2  in  ECZTRA  1).  Although  this  difference  could  be  due  to 
differences in sample collection, it is possible that the level of S. aureus colonisation on the skin is lower in 
adolescent patients with AD than in adults. 
In both tralokinumab dose groups, the median levels of S. aureus decreased markedly from baseline to 
Week 16 relative to the levels in the placebo group. At Week 16, the median levels in the tralokinumab 
groups were equal to the lower level of quantification, as more than half of the subjects were negative for 
S. aureus at this time point. This was most likely due to the low abundance levels at baseline, making it 
less meaningful to assess treatment effect based on the shift in S. aureus abundance, as was done in 
ECZTRA 1. Consequently, a quantitative comparison with the effect on S. aureus abundance in ECZTRA 1 
was not possible. 
Instead, the number of subjects with a quantifiable level of S. aureus at Week 16 was used as a measure 
of treatment effect. This analysis showed that approximately 40% of the subjects in the tralokinumab 
groups and 80% in the placebo group were positive for S. aureus at Week 16. This was comparable with 
the results observed in lesional skin for the phase 2b dose-finding trial in adults, D2213C00001, where 
the data were also presented as positive/negative but were based on an assessment of the number of 
bacterial colonies and not gene copy numbers. 
2.3.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The data included in this assessment were from 2 completed clinical trials in adolescent subjects. These 
data were also used in the population PK analysis. The same dose of tralokinumab in adults (300 mg Q2W) 
is proposed for adolescents with AD.

In the pivotal phase 3 study (ECZTRA 6) in adolescent subjects with moderate-to-severe AD, sparse PK 
sampling at trough was conducted. The results support dose linear PK of tralokinumab, which is consistent 
with the PK of tralokinumab  observed in adult  subjects. Trough concentrations at Week 4 were  close to 
steady-state  concentrations  owing  to  the  initial  loading  dose  administered.  Systemic  exposure  of 
tralokinumab was higher in adolescents than in adults for a given dose, which can be attributed to the lower 
mean body weight in the adolescents compared to adults.  
Study CD-RI-CAT-354-1054 was the first study with tralokinumab in an adolescent population. Following a 
single  300  mg  dose  of  tralokinumab,  rich  PK  sampling  was  conducted.  There  was  an  adequate 
representation of the entire adolescent age range as evidenced by an equal number of subjects in the two 
cohorts (12 to 14 years and 15 to 17 years). Further, subject body weight, body height, and body mass 
index (BMI) at baseline were representative of the population of interest. 
PK analysis showed that tralokinumab is slowly absorbed with a tmax ranging from 3 to 9 days post-dose 
and a mean terminal half-life of around 22 days, which is consistent with the results previously observed 
in adult subjects. 
Population PK analysis 
This update of the adult population PK model with data from adolescent subjects primarily focused on the 
covariate  analysis  and  specifically  if  additional  covariates  should  be  included  to  predict  tralokinumab 
exposure in adolescent subjects.  
Overall, there are no major issues with this analysis. The methods used are acceptable. Data exclusions 
were well documented and acceptable. The structural model, based on the adult dataset, described the PK 
of tralokinumab in adolescent subjects adequately and the predictive performance of the final model was 
acceptable.  
The covariate analysis, based on both statistical significance and clinical relevance  criteria identified the 
same covariates as those identified in the previous analysis in adults. They were body weight, non-ECZTRA 
trials, and concentration of the drug formulation.  
Immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity results observed in ECZTRA 6 showed a treatment-emergent ADA incidence rate of 
7.3% in tralokinumab-treated adolescent subjects. Numerically, this incidence rate in adolescents is slightly 
higher compared to the adult population in the ECZTRA trials (treatment-emergent ADA incidence 4.5%). 
However,  a  statistical  comparison  was  not  appropriate  due  to  the  low  number  of  ADA-positive  patients 
overall. The rate of nAb was comparably low in adolescent (0.7%) and adult subjects (1.0%). Further, there 
was no apparent impact of ADA on the PK, efficacy or safety of tralokinumab. Overall, it is agreed that the 
results suggest low immunogenic potential of tralokinumab in adolescent subjects. 
Consistent with the results of ECZTRA 6, tralokinumab showed low immunogenic potential in Study CD-RI-
CAT-354-1054, with no subjects having an ADA response following a single SC 300 mg dose. 
Pharmacodynamics 
In ECZTRA 6, the results of the PD assessment support the mechanism of action of tralokinumab and were 
generally consistent with those reported in adult subjects.  
The serum levels of the key AD disease biomarkers CCL17, IL-22, and IgE were reduced at Week 16 in 
subjects receiving tralokinumab compared with subjects receiving placebo, supporting an anti-inflammatory 
effect of tralokinumab. The stratum corneum lipid composition in subjects receiving tralokinumab shifted 
from a typical AD lesional skin profile at baseline, indicating a disrupted skin barrier, towards a non-lesional 
profile  at  Week  16,  suggesting  improvement  of  the  skin  barrier  function.  S.  aureus  abundance  in  both 
lesional  and  non-lesional  skin  was  strongly  supressed  at  Week  16  in  subjects  receiving  tralokinumab 
compared  with  subjects  receiving  placebo.  Lipidomic  and  gene  expression  skin  biomarker  data  indicate 
improved barrier integrity and better control of skin abnormalities for tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W than for 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W at Week 16.

2.3.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
In terms of clinical pharmacology, no major objections were raised. Other concerns have been resolved.  
The CHMP considered that the clinical pharmacology package was sufficient to support the following 
dosing recommendations in adolescent patients 12 years and older: 
The recommended dose of tralokinumab for adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older is an initial 
dose of 600 mg (four 150 mg injections) followed by 300 mg (two 150 mg injections) administered every 
other week as subcutaneous injection.  
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
Dose regimens selected for evaluation in ECZTRA 6 
The phase 2b dose-finding trial in adult subjects with moderate-to-severe AD evaluated 3 dose levels of 
45, 150, and 300 mg tralokinumab Q2W+TCS. The difference to placebo increased with increasing dose of 
tralokinumab for most of the efficacy endpoints – including the primary endpoints (change from baseline in 
EASI  at  Week  12,  and  IGA  0/1  combined  with  at  least  a  2-grade  reduction  in  IGA  from  baseline). 
Furthermore, the safety profile of tralokinumab 300 mg was acceptable. Therefore, tralokinumab 300 mg 
Q2W was chosen for the phase 3 development programme in adults. 
In  adolescents,  a  phase  1  trial  with  tralokinumab  in  subjects  with  asthma  showed  PK  parameters  that 
resembled those reported for the adult population when body weight was accounted for. It has been shown 
that the exposure of tralokinumab at steady state increases with decreasing body weight. However, this 
does not translate into a pronounced impact of body weight on the efficacy of tralokinumab. To establish 
an  appropriate  dose  of  tralokinumab  in  the  adolescent  population,  both  tralokinumab  150  mg  and 
tralokinumab  300  mg  were  included  in  ECZTRA  6.  For  each  dose,  an  initial  treatment  regimen  of 
tralokinumab Q2W for 16 weeks was chosen, similar to what was done in the phase 3 trials in adults. From 
Week 16 onwards, a maintenance treatment regimen of Q4W was included for each dose, in addition to the 
Q2W maintenance regimen, to  investigate whether less frequent  dosing of  tralokinumab is sufficient for 
long-term maintenance of efficacy in adolescents.

tralokinumab monotherapy in adolescent subjects with moderate-to-severe 
atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Methods 
This  was  a  phase  3  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  parallel-group,  multi-centre  trial 
evaluating the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of tralokinumab monotherapy in adolescent subjects with 
moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis who are candidates for systemic therapy. 
The  trial  consisted  of  a  screening  period  of  2  to  6  weeks,  an  initial  treatment  period  of  16  weeks,  a 
maintenance treatment period of 36 weeks in subjects who obtained a clinical response at Week 16, and 
an off-treatment follow-up period of 14 weeks for assessment of safety. 
Panel 11 Trial design 
Trial periods 
Screening period (Week -6 to Week 0) 
The screening period had a minimum duration of 2 weeks and a maximum duration of 6 weeks and included 
1 or 2 screening visits. The exact duration of the screening period depended on the wash-out period defined 
by the exclusion criteria. If no wash-out or only a 2-week wash-out was required, screening Visits 1 and 2 
were combined (Week -2; Visit 2). Eligibility was assessed at the (first) screening visit and on Day 0 prior 
to randomisation. 
All  subjects  were  to  use  an  emollient  twice  daily  (or  more,  as  needed)  for  at  least  14  days  before 
randomisation and were to continue this treatment throughout the trial. 
Initial treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16) 
Following the screening period, approximately 294 subjects were planned to be randomised 1:1:1 to one 
of  the  following  groups  stratified  by  region  (Europe,  North  America,  Australia,  and  Japan)  and  baseline 
disease severity (IGA of 3 or 4):

• Tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W: tralokinumab 600 mg (loading dose) at baseline, then tralokinumab 300 mg 
Q2W. 
• Tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W: tralokinumab 300 mg (loading dose) at baseline, then tralokinumab 150 mg 
Q2W. 
• Placebo Q2W: placebo (loading dose) at baseline, then placebo Q2W. 
Maintenance treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
Subjects achieving the protocol-defined clinical response (defined as IGA of 0 or 1 [IGA 0/1]  or at least 
75% reduction in EASI score from baseline [EASI75]) at Week 16 without use of rescue medication from 
Week 2 to Week 16 continued into maintenance treatment until Week 52. 
Subjects achieving a clinical response at Week 16 and who had been randomised to tralokinumab in the 
initial treatment period were re-randomised 1:1 to maintenance treatment regimens based on their initial 
treatment regimen and stratified by region and IGA response at Week 16 (IGA 0/1 or IGA >1). 
Subjects who were initially randomised to tralokinumab 300 mg were re-randomised 1:1 to: 
• Tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
• Tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W: alternating dose administrations of tralokinumab 300 mg or placebo. 
Subjects who were initially randomised to tralokinumab 150 mg were re-randomised 1:1 to: 
• Tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. 
• Tralokinumab 150 mg Q4W: alternating dose administrations of tralokinumab 150 mg or placebo. 
Subjects randomised to placebo in the initial treatment period who achieved a clinical response at Week 16 
continued to receive placebo Q2W in the maintenance treatment period while maintaining blinding. 
Open-label treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
Subjects who did not achieve the protocol-defined clinical response at Week 16 and subjects who received 
rescue treatment from Week 2 to Week 16 were transferred to open-label treatment (tralokinumab 300 mg 
Q2W with optional use of TCS and/or TCI) at Week 16, if considered appropriate by the investigator. 
In addition, subjects were transferred from maintenance treatment to open-label treatment if they met any 
of  the  criteria  listed  below  and  transfer  to  open-label  treatment  was  considered  appropriate  by  the 
investigator. 
Subjects with IGA=0 at Week 16: 
• IGA of at least 2 and not achieving EASI75 over at least a 4-week period (i.e. over 3 consecutive visits). 
Subjects with IGA=1 at Week 16: 
• IGA of at least 3 and not achieving EASI75 over at least a 4-week period (i.e. over 3 consecutive visits). 
Subjects with IGA >1 at Week 16: 
Not achieving EASI75 over at least a 4-week period (i.e. over 3 consecutive visits).  
Subjects who receive rescue treatment:  
If rescue treatment was administered during the maintenance treatment period, subjects were transferred 
to open-label treatment. For subjects who received systemic rescue treatment, open-label treatment was 
not to be initiated sooner than 5 half-lives after the last dose of the systemic rescue treatment. 
Subjects who were transferred to open-label treatment continued their scheduled visit sequence.

Safety follow-up period (Week 52 to Week 66) 
After completion of the treatment periods or premature discontinuation of IMP, all subjects completed an 
off-treatment follow-up period for the  assessment of safety, PK, and  immunogenicity (i.e. ADA),  except 
subjects who transferred to ECZTEND before Week 66 (see below). During follow-up, subjects were allowed 
to receive standard of AD care (excluding biologic therapies) at the investigator’s discretion, if needed. 
Long-term extension trial (ECZTEND) 
Eligible subjects from selected countries (Belgium, Canada, France, Germany, Great Britain, Poland, and 
United  States)  were  invited  to  enter  a  long-term  extension  trial  conducted  under  a  separate  protocol 
(ECZTEND). Subjects who transferred to ECZTEND were required to have had their last visit in the treatment 
period (Week 52) under the current protocol (ECZTRA 6). 
Subjects could enter ECZTEND with up to 26 weeks from their last IMP injection in the present trial (Week 
50) to their first IMP injection in  ECZTEND. Subjects could therefore enter ECZTEND without completing 
the safety follow-up visit (16 weeks after their last IMP injection) in the present trial; those subjects will 
have their safety follow-up visit in ECZTEND. 
During the COVID-19 pandemic, subjects who were unable to attend their Week 52 visit at site, the visit 
could be partially conducted over the phone. Such subjects were allowed to transfer to ECZTEND.

Treatments 
The first day of dosing was considered Day 0 (Visit 3, baseline). Each subject received 4 SC injections (each 
of 1 mL) to receive a loading dose of tralokinumab or placebo. At subsequent treatment visits in the trial, 
each subject received 2 SC injections (each of 1 mL). 
In the initial treatment period subjects received either:

•  Tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W: tralokinumab 600 mg (4 mL) at baseline, then tralokinumab 300 mg 
(2 mL) Q2W. 
•  Tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W:  tralokinumab  300  mg  (2  mL)  +  placebo  (2  mL)  at  baseline,  then 
tralokinumab 150 mg (1 mL) + placebo (1 mL) Q2W. 
•  Placebo Q2W: placebo (4 mL) at baseline, then placebo (2 mL) Q2W. 
In the maintenance treatment starting from Week 16, subjects with a clinical response (achieved without 
use of rescue treatment from Week 2 to Week 16) continued to receive 2 SC injections (each of 1 mL) of 
maintenance treatment for up to Week 50: 
•  Subjects initially randomised to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W: 
-  Subjects re-randomised to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W: tralokinumab 300 mg (2 mL). 
-  Subjects  re-randomised  to  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q4W:  alternating  doses  of  300  mg 
tralokinumab (2 mL) or placebo (2 mL). 
•  Subjects initially randomised to tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W: 
-  Subjects re-randomised to tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W: tralokinumab 150 mg (1 mL) + placebo 
(1 mL). 
-  Subjects re-randomised to tralokinumab 150 mg Q4W: alternating doses of tralokinumab 150 
mg (1 mL) + placebo (1 mL) or placebo (2 mL). 
•  Placebo Q2W: placebo (2 mL). 
Subjects who transferred to open-label treatment  received tralokinumab 300 mg  (2 mL) at each dosing 
visit. 
The last administration of IMP occurred at Week 50. To ensure blinding, all treatment groups received the 
same number of injections at each visit; thus, the tralokinumab 150 mg group received both tralokinumab 
and placebo injections at all dosing visits. 
IMP was administered by a qualified, unblinded HCP. 
The injections were administered into the SC tissue of the upper arm, anterior thigh, or abdomen, separated 
by  at  least  3  cm.  The  injection  site  was  recorded  in  the  source  documents  at  each  treatment  visit  and 
recorded in the eCRF. 
Prior and concomitant therapy 
Background treatment (emollients) 
All subjects were required to use an emollient twice daily (or more, as needed) for at least 14 days before 
randomisation.  The  background  treatment  preferably  had  to  be  an  additive-free,  basic  bland  emollient. 
Subjects were required to continue their background emollient treatment throughout the trial. 
Concomitant medication and concurrent procedures 
Any medication or vaccine that the subject received from 3 months prior to screening through safety follow-
up  (Week  66)  was  recorded  in  the  subject’s  medical  record  and  the  eCRF  along  with  details  such  as 
medication  name,  indication,  start  and  stop  date  of  administration  (and  whether  the  medication  was 
ongoing), dosage information (including dose, unit, and frequency), and route of administration.

Concurrent surgical procedures and procedures related to AD treatment (e.g. phototherapy or bleach baths) 
were  also  recorded  in  the  subject’s  medical  record  and  the  eCRF.  The  following  details  were  recorded: 
procedure, condition, diagnosis, and start and stop date (and whether the procedure was ongoing). 
Investigators could prescribe concomitant medications or treatments to provide adequate supportive care 
as deemed necessary, except for medications considered prohibited. 
The  following  concomitant  medications  related  to  AD  treatment  were  permitted  from  screening  through 
safety follow-up (Week 66): 
•  Oral antibiotics, antiviral, or antifungal therapy for skin infections as appropriate. 
•  Stable doses of an emollient  
•  Oral antihistamines. 
Prohibited medication and procedures 
The following medications were prohibited from randomisation through Week 52: 
•  TCS of any WHO class (except for subjects in open-label treatment). 
•  TCI (except for subjects in open-label treatment). 
•  PDE-4 inhibitors. 
•  UVA or UVB, PUVA, other phototherapy, or tanning beds. 
•  3 or more bleach baths per week. 
The  following  medications  were  prohibited  during  the  trial  from  randomisation  through  safety  follow-up 
(Week 66) or until first IMP injection in the long-term extension trial (ECZTEND): 
•  Systemic corticosteroids (nasal, ophthalmic, and inhaled corticosteroids were allowed). 
•  Systemic  treatment  with  an  immunosuppressive/immunomodulating  agent  (e.g.  cyclosporine, 
mycophenolate  mofetil,  azathioprine,  methotrexate,  Janus  kinase  inhibitors,  interferon-gamma, 
dupilumab, or other biologics). 
The  sponsor’s  medical  expert  was  to  be  notified  if  a  subject  received  any  of  the  following  prohibited 
medications from randomisation through safety follow-up (Week 66): 
• 
• 
Investigational agents other than tralokinumab. 
Immunoglobulin or blood products. 
•  Allergen immunotherapy. 
• 
Live (attenuated) vaccine. 
The sponsor’s medical expert was to determine whether IMP discontinuation was required. 
Inactive/killed vaccinations (e.g. inactive influenza) were allowed if they  were not administered within 5 
days before/after any trial visit. 
Any prohibited treatments used during the trial were recorded as concomitant medication. 
Rescue treatment 
Initial treatment period, maintenance treatment period, and safety follow-up period 
If medically necessary (i.e. to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD could be provided 
to trial subjects at the discretion of the investigator. For analysis of the primary estimand for the primary

endpoints,  subjects  who  received  rescue  treatment  from  Week  2  to  Week  16  were  considered  as  non-
responders, but they continued IMP treatment if the rescue treatment consisted of topical medications only. 
When possible, investigators were instructed to limit the first step of rescue therapy to topical medications 
and escalate to systemic medications only for subjects who did not respond adequately after at least 14 
days of topical treatment. TCS of any WHO class and TCI could be used as topical rescue treatment. 
Systemic  rescue  treatment  with  corticosteroids  or  non-steroidal  systemic  immunosuppressive  drugs 
(cyclosporine,  methotrexate,  mycophenolate  mofetil,  azathioprine,  etc.) 
required 
immediate 
discontinuation of IMP. After the treatment with these medications was completed, IMP could be resumed 
if deemed appropriate by the investigator and sponsor’s medical expert, but no sooner than 5 half-lives 
after the last dose of the systemic rescue medication. Use of biological rescue treatment was disallowed for 
the entire trial duration. 
Open-label tralokinumab arm only 
From  Week  16  through  safety  follow-up  (Week  66),  subjects  could  use  mild  to  moderate  strength  TCS 
and/or TCI as needed on lesional skin at the investigator’s discretion. Use of TCS and TCI was recorded as 
concomitant medication.

Objectives and Outcomes/endpoints 
Sample size 
Assuming a screening failure rate of 25%, approximately 392 subjects were expected to be screened and 
approximately  294  subjects  were  planned  to  be  randomised  1:1:1  to  initial  treatment  (98  subjects  to 
tralokinumab 300 mg, 98 subjects to tralokinumab 150 mg, and 98 subjects to placebo). The sample size 
was chosen to  provide a sufficient power for  demonstrating  efficacy of  tralokinumab vs. placebo for the 
primary endpoints. 
Under the assumption that the IGA 0/1 response rates at Week 16 for the tralokinumab 300 mg dose and 
placebo are 30% and 10%, respectively, the power to detect a difference between tralokinumab 300 mg 
and placebo would be approximately 94% at a 2-sided 5.0% significance level. 
Further, assuming corresponding response rates of 40% and  15% for EASI75 at Week 16 would imply a 
nominal power of approximately 98% to detect a difference between tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo for 
that endpoint. 
The combined power for detecting a difference between tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo in both primary 
endpoints at a 5.0% significance level would then be at least 92%. 
For the tralokinumab 150 mg dose, the accumulated power for subsequently rejecting the 2 hypotheses of 
no difference to placebo for the primary IGA 0/1 and EASI75 endpoints at a 2.5% significance level became 
approximately 84% and 80%, when using the same assumptions as for the tralokinumab 300 mg dose.

Randomisation 
Eligible subjects were randomised to treatment with either tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W, tralokinumab 150 
mg Q2W, or placebo Q2W in a 1:1:1 ratio in the initial treatment period. Subjects who were randomised to 
tralokinumab and achieved a clinical response at Week 16 were eligible to continue maintenance treatment 
and  were  re-randomised  based  on  their  treatment  in  the  initial  treatment  period.  Subjects  initially 
randomised to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W were re-randomised in a 1:1 ratio (tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W: 
tralokinumab  300  mg  Q4W)  while  subjects  initially  randomised  to  tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W  were  re-
randomised in a 1:1 ratio (tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W: tralokinumab 150 mg Q4W).  
A central IRT system was used to control the randomisation, re-randomisation, and stratification factors 
(region  and  disease  severity),  along  with  IMP  supply  chain  and  expiry  tracking.  The  assignment  to 
maintenance or open-label treatment was based on the evaluation of clinical response by the investigator 
at Week 16. For 9 subjects, clinical response status at Week 16 was entered incorrectly and consequently, 
the IRT system assigned these subjects to incorrect treatment after Week 16 (2 subjects were assigned to 
maintenance treatment despite not achieving IGA 0/1 or EASI75  and 7 subjects were assigned to open-
label treatment despite achieving IGA 0/1 or EASI75 without use of rescue medication). 
The randomisation scheme (including treatment allocation for each subject) for the trial  was provided by 
the applicant. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blinded trial in which tralokinumab and placebo were visually distinct from each other. 
Neither the subject nor any of the investigators or LEO Pharma A/S staff who were involved in the treatment 
or clinical evaluation and monitoring of the subjects were aware of the treatment received. 
The packaging and labelling of the IMPs contained no evidence of their identity. IMP was packed in identical 
boxes  with  non-sequential  kit  numbers  to  ensure  that  unblinding  did  not  occur  during  shipment  and 
handling of the drug. 
Since tralokinumab and placebo were visually distinct and not matched for viscosity, IMP was handled and 
administered by a qualified, unblinded HCP at the site who was not involved in the management of trial 
subjects and who did not perform any of the assessments. If needed, the unblinded HCP could perform the 
safety assessments (except assessment of AEs) for subjects in open-label treatment. 
If treatment allocation for a subject became known to the investigator or other trial  staff involved in the 
management  of  trial  subjects,  LEO  Pharma  A/S  was  to  be  notified  immediately.  There  were  2  cases  of 
unblinding  or  potential  unblinding  of  LEO  Pharma  staff.  After  evaluation  of  the  cases,  they  were  not 
considered to have an impact on the integrity of trial results. 
If an issue arose with the IMP (e.g. damaged kit or syringe that had been assigned to a subject prior to 
administration,  or  any  other  unexpected  event  with  the  kit  or  syringe  [e.g.  a  malfunction  during  IMP 
administration]), the unblinded HCP at the site was to contact the CRA to determine whether any specific 
actions were required. 
The  trial  site  maintained  a  written  plan  detailing  which  staff  members  were  blinded/unblended  and  the 
process of IMP administration used to maintain the blind.

1.  A  tipping  point  analysis  introduced  as  a  sensitivity  analysis  number  3  for  the  primary  estimand 
(‘composite’) for the primary endpoints (IGA 0/1 and EASI75) and the secondary endpoint (reduction of 
Adolescent Pruritus NRS weekly average of at least 4 (yes/no)). 
2. Analyses of a new tertiary estimand (‘composite’) for the continuous secondary confirmatory endpoints 
(change  in  SCORAD  and  change  in  CDLQI).  Analyses  apply  non-responder  imputation  for  subjects  who 
received rescue medication. A tipping point sensitivity analysis is included. 
Other supplementary analyses introduced for consistency: 
3.  The  same  analysis  and  tipping  point  sensitivity  analysis  as  above  implemented  as  a  new  tertiary 
(‘composite’) estimand for the two secondary additional endpoints ‘Change from baseline to Week 16 in 
EASI score’ and ‘Change from baseline to Week 16 in Adolescent Pruritus NRS (weekly average)’ 
Analysis Populations 
All subjects randomised to initial treatment who were exposed to IMP and who were not enrolled at the two 
sites with GCP non-compliance issues were included in the full analysis set and analysed for efficacy up 
to Week 16 (Visit 11). 
Subjects from two sites (n=2 and n=7) were excluded from the FAS due to several GCP non-compliance 
issues. 
A per protocol analysis set was used as an efficacy subset for the analysis of the primary endpoints at Week 
16 (Visit 11), and analyses based on the per protocol analysis set were performed to support the results 
obtained for the full analysis set. The per protocol analysis set was defined by excluding subjects from the 
full analysis set for whom any of the following conditions applied: 
•  Provided no assessment of IGA or EASI following start of treatment. 
•  Were known to have taken the wrong IMP throughout the initial treatment period of the trial. 
•  Did not fulfil the inclusion criteria no. 4, 7, 8, and 9. 
A maintenance analysis set was defined as all subjects who received tralokinumab in the initial treatment 
period and who were re-randomised to maintenance treatment. Subjects who were not re-randomised to 
maintenance  treatment and subjects from  the  two  sites  with GCP non-compliance  issues  were excluded 
from the maintenance analysis set. 
A safety analysis set was defined as all subjects randomised to initial treatment who were exposed to IMP 
and  not  being  from  the  two  sites  with  GCP  non-compliance  issues.  Hence,  the  safety  analysis  set  was 
identical to the full analysis set. 
A  maintenance  safety  analysis  set  was  defined  as  all  subjects  who  were  assigned  to  the  maintenance 
treatment period, not being from the two sites with GCP non-compliance issues, and received at least 1 
dose of maintenance treatment. 
An open-label safety analysis set  was defined as all subjects (except those from  the two sites with GCP 
non-compliance issues) who at any point in time entered the open-label period and received at least 1 dose 
of open-label treatment.

A  safety follow-up analysis set  was defined as subjects (except  those  from  the two  sites  with GCP non-
compliance issues) completing the treatment period for whom the date of last contact was after the date 
of exposure end (i.e. after the Week 52 visit) and subjects (except those from the two sites with GCP non-
compliance issues) not completing the treatment period and for whom the date of last contact was after 
the date of permanent discontinuation of IMP. 
Multiplicity adjustments 
The submission testing procedure was executed as follows: 
IGA 0/1 at Week 16 between tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo was evaluated at a 5% significance level. 
If the test was statistically significant, EASI75 at Week 16 between tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo was 
evaluated at a 5% significance level. If both these tests were statistically significant, the significance level 
(alpha)  was  split  evenly  between  the  analyses  of  the  3  secondary  endpoints  at  Week  16  between 
tralokinumab 300 mg and placebo and the analyses of IGA 0/1 at Week 16 between tralokinumab 150 mg 
and placebo, i.e. both were tested with alpha = 2.5%. If the test of IGA 0/1 at Week 16 for tralokinumab 
150 mg was statistically significant, EASI75 at Week 16 between tralokinumab 150 mg and placebo was 
evaluated at a 2.5% significance level. If both tests of the primary endpoints for the 150 mg dose were 
statistically  significant,  the  3  secondary  endpoints  were  evaluated  at  a  2.5%  significance  level.  The 
evaluation of the 3 secondary endpoints at Week 16 between both doses of tralokinumab and placebo used 
the Holm-Bonferroni method for 3 ordered p-values at a 2.5% significance level to adjust for multiplicity. 
If the tests were statistically significant for all 3 secondary endpoints for the 300 mg dose, the significance 
level could be passed on to testing of IGA 0/1 and all subsequent endpoints for the 150 mg dose. Likewise, 
if the test was statistically significant for all 3 secondary endpoints for the 150 mg dose, the significance 
level could be passed on for testing of the secondary endpoints for the 300 mg dose.

Analysis of primary endpoints 
The primary endpoints were: 
• IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16. 
• EASI75 at Week 16. 
All analyses of the primary endpoints were based on the full analysis set. 
The following 3 estimands were defined for the primary endpoints: 
• Primary estimand: ‘composite’. 
• Secondary estimand: ‘hypothetical’. 
• Tertiary estimand: ‘treatment policy’. 
The applied estimands incorporated 2 main types of intercurrent events that influenced how the treatment 
effects were estimated: 
• Initiation of rescue treatment: some of the estimands used rescue treatment (from Week 2 to Week 
16) as an event that modified the applied value of an endpoint, e.g. by defining a subject receiving rescue 
treatment as a non-responder. 
• Permanent discontinuation of IMP: this event occurred when a subject was permanently withdrawn 
from the treatment or the trial. This could either happen at his/her own initiative or at the investigator’s 
discretion. The event also included the possibility of a subject being lost to follow-up. The timing of the 
event  was  defined  as  the date of  the  early  termination  visit  for  withdrawn  subjects or,  in the  case  of  a 
subject lost to follow-up, the date of the  last  known visit to  the  clinic. As for the  rescue  treatment,  the 
event type was used to modify an applied endpoint value.

Analysis of secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints were: 
• Reduction of Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) ≥4 from baseline to Week 16. 
• Change in SCORAD from baseline to Week 16. 
• Change in CDLQI score from baseline to Week 16. 
All analyses of the secondary endpoints were based on the full analysis set. Reduction of Adolescent Worst 
Pruritus NRS weekly average of ≥4 was a binary endpoint and was analysed as described for the primary 
endpoint EASI75, using 3 estimands (‘composite’, ‘hypothetical’, and ‘treatment policy’ ). 
For  the  ‘treatment  policy’  estimand  (tertiary  estimand),  the  primary  analysis  was  not  conducted  as 
insufficient  data  were  available  to  support  multiple  imputation  of  missing  values  within  the  treatment

groups. However, the corresponding planned sensitivity analysis was conducted, analysing subjects with 
missing Week 16 data as non-responders, while otherwise using observed data for the remaining subjects. 
Continuous secondary endpoints 
The change from baseline to Week 16 in SCORAD and CDLQI were continuous endpoints. 
An overview of the estimand framework for these endpoints is presented below.

• IGA of 0/1 at Week 52 among subjects with IGA of 0/1 at Week 16 achieved without rescue treatment 
from Week 2 to Week 16, after initial randomisation to tralokinumab. 
• EASI75 at Week 52 among subjects with EASI75 at Week 16 achieved without rescue treatment from 
Week 2 to Week 16, after initial randomisation to tralokinumab. 
IGA of 0/1 and EASI75 at Week 52 were analysed using a binomial model, providing response rates and 
corresponding 95% confidence intervals based on the Wilson score method. 
Only subjects who achieved IGA 0/1 or EASI75 at Week 16 without using rescue treatment from Week 2 to 
Week 16 were included in the analysis. All subjects who used rescue treatment (including TCS) between 
Week 16 and Week 52, permanently discontinued treatment, or transferred to open-label treatment were 
considered non-responders. Missing data for subjects who did not attend the Week 52 visit and who did not 
use rescue treatment between Week 16 and Week 52, were imputed as non-responders. 
Continued treatment for non-IGA responders 
The number of responders according to IGA 0/1 at Week 52 were tabulated for the subgroup of subjects in 
the maintenance analysis set who were re-randomised meeting the EASI75 criterion but not the IGA 0/1 
criterion at Week 16. All subjects who prior to the Week 52 visit had received rescue treatment (including 
TCS),  who  were  permanently  discontinued  from  treatment,  or  who  transferred  to  open-label  treatment 
were considered non-responders in the analysis. 
Analysis of efficacy – open-label treatment 
To evaluate the efficacy in subjects who did not achieve IGA 0/1 or EASI75 at Week 16, IGA 0/1, EASI75, 
EASI50, EASI90, SCORAD75, and CDLQI reduction from baseline of at least 4 and 6, POEM reduction from 
baseline of at least 4 and 6, and Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS reduction from baseline of at least 3 and 
4, respectively, were summarised for the open-label period by visit, by initial treatment, and as a total, for 
previously tralokinumab-treated as a group and for both composite and treatment policy approach. 
Results 
Participant flow 
Initial treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16) 
A total of 347 subjects were screened for this trial. Of these, 46 subjects (13.3%) were screening failures. 
The remaining 301 subjects were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio. 
•  101 subjects randomised to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
•  100 subjects randomised to tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. 
•  100 subjects randomised to placebo. 
9  of  the  randomised  subjects  were  enrolled  at  investigational  sites  with  GCP  non-compliance  issues  (3 
subjects randomised to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W, 1 subject randomised to tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W, 
and 5 subjects randomised to placebo). These subjects were excluded from the FAS. Furthermore, 1 subject 
in each treatment group was not dosed and therefore excluded from the FAS (2 subjects were randomised 
in error and therefore not dosed; 1 subject's parent withdrew consent prior to IMP administration). 
Consequently, the FAS included: 
•  97 subjects in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group.

Page 47/153 
 
 
 
 
•  98 subjects in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group. 
•  94 subjects in the placebo group. 
Of the randomised subjects, 3 subjects (3.0%) in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group, 5 subjects (5.0%) 
in  the  tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W  group,  and  8  subjects  (8.0%)  in  the  placebo  group  permanently 
discontinued IMP before Week 16. The reasons for permanent discontinuation of IMP were: 
•  Adverse event (2 subjects [2.0%] in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group). 
• 
Lost to follow-up (2 subjects [2.0%] in the placebo group). 
•  Withdrawal by subject (2 subjects [2.0%] in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group). 
•  Withdrawal  by  parent/guardian  (2  subjects  [2.0%]  in  the  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W  group,  1 
subject  [1.0%]  in  the  tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W  group,  and  3  subjects  [3.0%]  in  the  placebo 
group). 
• 
Lack of efficacy (1 subject [1.0%] in the placebo group). 
•  Other  (1  subject  [1.0%]  in  the  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W  group  and  2  subjects  [2.0%]  in  the 
placebo group). 
In total, 273 subjects (90.7% of all randomised subjects) completed Week 16 on treatment. Of these 273 
subjects,  94  subjects  were  treated  with  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W,  93  subjects  were  treated  with 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W, and 86 subjects received placebo.

Changes to the conduct of the trial as a result of COVID-19 
The onset of the global COVID-19 pandemic occurred after all subjects had passed their Week 16 visit in 
the trial. An urgent safety measure was implemented during the trial, which allowed for collection of adverse 
events  by  phone  if  site  visits  were  not  possible  due  to  local  preventive  measures  during  the  COVID-19 
pandemic. 
Protocol deviations: 
No protocol deviations were assessed to have had any direct impact on subject safety. 8 protocol deviations 
related to violation of inclusion criterion no. 10 (an Adolescent Pruritus NRS average score of ≥4 during the 
week prior to baseline) were considered to have a critical impact on the efficacy analysis as randomisation 
of subjects without a baseline Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) ≥4 reduced the size of the 
evaluable population for the reduction of Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) ≥4 from baseline 
to Week 16 (confirmatory secondary endpoint; see the SAP). As subjects violating inclusion criterion no. 
10 were excluded from the analyses of the reduction of Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS ≥4 (confirmatory 
secondary endpoint), these protocol deviations did not affect the estimates for the reduction of Adolescent 
Worst  Pruritus  NRS  (weekly  average)  ≥4  from  baseline  to  Week  16.  In  addition,  violations  of  inclusion 
criterion  no.  10  were  assessed  not  to  have  an  impact  on  other  efficacy  analyses  as  subjects  violating 
inclusion criterion no. 10 fulfilled key inclusion criteria no. 4, 7, 8, and 9. 
A total of 377 major protocol deviations were reported during the trial, including the  8 critical protocol 
deviations mentioned above. No major protocol deviations were reported at trial level or at country level. 
18 major protocol deviations were reported  at  site  level, of  which  5  major  site-level protocol  deviations 
were reported at investigational site 340. 359 major protocol deviations were reported at subject-level, of 
which 36 protocol deviations were reported at two investigational sites.  
Of the 359 major protocol deviations reported at subject-level, 37 protocol deviations resulted from the 
COVID-19 pandemic. 
2 of the major site-level protocol deviations were considered critical: 
•  1 major site-level protocol deviation reported at investigational site 340 was related to inadequate 
Assessment report

Page 54/153 
 
 
 
 
 
 
temperature monitoring of IMP storage. The inadequate temperature monitoring at site 340 was 
documented in a temperature deviation report, and the sponsor IMP quality specialist assessed the 
issue  as  critical  as  the  integrity  of  the  IMP  dispensed  to  subjects  could  have  been  impacted. 
However, the related site-level protocol deviation was not considered to have impacted the integrity 
of trial results as subjects from investigational site 340 were excluded from the full analysis set, 
and was not considered by the medical expert and global safety representative to have had a critical 
impact  on  subject  safety  as  no  AEs  were  reported  at  the  site  that  could  have  been  related  to 
administration of IMP stored at incorrect temperatures. 
•  1 major site-level protocol deviation concerned inadvertent circulation of unblinding information via 
email.  Since  the  incident  occurred  8  months  after  the  subject  had  completed  the  initial  blinded 
treatment period and transferred to open-label treatment, collection of blinded data in the initial 
treatment period for this subject was unaffected by the revelation of treatment allocation for the 
subject  to  the  data  manager  and  the  CRA.  Therefore,  the  incident  was  not  considered  to  have 
impacted the scientific integrity of the results from the trial and thus the subject was not excluded 
from the full analysis set. 
As mentioned above, no protocol deviations were considered to have had a direct impact on subject safety. 
8 major subject-level protocol deviations related to violation of inclusion criterion no. 10 were considered 
critical, these protocol deviations were reported for 1 subject in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group, 3 
subjects in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group, and 4 subjects in the placebo group.  
As  subjects  violating  inclusion  criterion  no.  10  were  excluded  from  the  analyses  of  the  reduction  of 
Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS ≥4, these protocol deviations did not affect the estimates for the reduction 
of Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) ≥4 from baseline to Week 16.

Protocol deviation – Inclusion/Exclusion/Randomisation 
39  major  subject-level  protocol  deviations  were  related  to  inclusion/exclusion/randomisation  criteria,  of 
which 9 protocol deviations were reported at investigational site 340. Of these, 17 protocol deviations (7 
from investigational site 340) were related to violation of inclusion criteria and 21 protocol deviations (2 
from investigational site 340) were related to violation of exclusion criteria.  
Protocol deviation – Informed consent 
2  major  site-level  protocol  deviations  and  28  major  subject-level  protocol  deviations  were  related  to 
violation of various informed consent and assent procedures, of which 4 subject-level protocol deviations 
were reported at investigational site 340.  
Protocol deviation – Late SAE reporting 
3 major subject-level protocol deviations were related to late SAE reporting. These protocol deviations were 
not considered critical as the late SAE reporting did not have any impact on subject safety and did not lead 
to any delayed action in the trial.  
Protocol deviation – Trial product 
7 major site-level protocol deviations and 20 major subject-level protocol deviations were related to trial 
product, of which 1 major site-level protocol deviation and 1 major subject-level protocol deviation were 
reported  at  investigational  site  340.  Of  the  20  major  subject-level  protocol  deviations  related  to  trial 
product,  1  protocol  deviation,  related  to  administration  of  IMP  by  unauthorised  staff,  resulted  from  the 
COVID-19 pandemic.  
Protocol deviation – Assessments safety/efficacy 
3  major  site-level  protocol  deviations  and  213  major  subject-level  protocol  deviations  were  related  to 
efficacy  and  safety  assessments,  of  which  16  major  subject-level  protocol  deviations  were  reported  at 
investigational sites with GCP non-compliance issues. Of the 213 major subject-level protocol deviations 
related to efficacy and safety assessments, 27 protocol deviations resulted from the COVID-19 pandemic. 
With the exception of the 3 protocol deviations for late SAE reporting described above, protocol deviations 
in  this  category  were  related  to  improperly  performed  assessments,  missing  assessments  or  sample 
acquisitions, assessments performed by unauthorised or unqualified staff, visits out of window or partially 
performed as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, and use of prohibited medication.  
Protocol deviation – Trial procedures 
1 major site-level protocol deviation and 49 major subject-level protocol deviations were related to trial 
procedures, of which the site-level protocol deviation and 3 subject-level protocol deviations were reported 
at investigational sites with GCP non-compliance issues. Of the 49 major subject-level protocol deviations 
related to trial procedures, 9 protocol deviations, all  related to visits performed out of window, resulted 
from the COVID-19 pandemic.  
Protocol deviation – Other 
5 major site-level protocol deviations and 10 major subject-level protocol deviations were reported in the 
category ‘Other’.

Panel 23 IGA, EASI, SCORAD, CDLQI, and Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) at 
Week 16: subjects in FAS assigned to maintenance Treatment 
Concomitant medication 
Initial treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16) 
The  most  frequently  reported  concomitant  medications  were  within  the  ‘dermatologicals’  category,  with 
nearly all subjects (96.9% to 100.0% across treatment groups) reporting concomitant use of dermatological 
medication. The most common medications in this category were ‘emollients and protectives’, which were 
were  reported  by  nearly  all  subjects  in  line  with  the  protocol  requirement  for  use  of  emollients  as 
background treatment, and ‘corticosteroids, dermatological preparations’, which were primarily given as 
rescue medication for AD. 
Use of concomitant medication within ATC level 1 categories was generally well balanced between treatment 
groups,  with  the  exception  of  ‘antiinfectives  for  systemic  use’  which  were  used  less  frequently  in  the 
tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W  group  (16.5%  of  the  subjects)  compared  with  tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W 
(28.6% of the subjects) and placebo (28.7% of the subjects).

Maintenance treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
The overall pattern in the use of concomitant medication was similar to that observed in the initial treatment 
period,  however  data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  low  number  of  subjects  in  each 
treatment group. 
Open-label treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
During  the  open-label  treatment  period,  99.5%  of  the  subjects  used  any  concomitant  medications.  The 
pattern in the use of concomitant medication was similar to that observed in the tralokinumab groups in 
the initial treatment period, except for the use of TCS and ‘antiinfectives for systemic use’. The use of TCS 
was higher in the open-label treatment group (50.0%) compared with the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group 
(29.9%) and the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group (33.7%), which reflected that mild to moderate potency 
TCS were allowed in the open-label treatment period while it was considered rescue medication in the initial 
treatment period. The use of ‘antiinfectives for systemic use’ was higher in the open-label treatment group 
(34.1%) compared with the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group (16.5%) and the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W 
group (28.6%), which may reflect the longer duration of the open-label treatment period (i.e. that subjects 
were more likely to experience an infection when observed for longer time). 
Rescue medication 
Use  of  rescue  medication  from  baseline  to  Week  16  was  included  as  another  endpoint  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy of tralokinumab compared with placebo on healthcare resource utilisation. 
Initial treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16) 
The use of rescue medication in the initial treatment period was slightly higher with tralokinumab 150 mg 
Q2W compared with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W, but lower in both tralokinumab groups compared with the 
placebo group. The vast majority of the rescue medication was TCS which was in line with the protocol 
instruction to limit first step of rescue medication to topical treatments. The use of moderate TCS (group 
II) and potent TCS (group III) was higher in the placebo group compared with the tralokinumab groups, 
indicating that more potent TCS were required to alleviate intolerable AD symptoms in the placebo group. 
In all 3 treatment groups, the majority of subjects who used rescue medication remained on IMP treatment 
until Week 16.

Panel 24 Rescue medication by type, initial treatment period: full analysis set 
Use of rescue medication by baseline IGA 
The use of rescue medication was higher in subjects with severe disease at baseline compared with subjects 
with  moderate  disease  at  baseline.  Regardless  of  the  disease  severity  at  baseline,  the  use  of  rescue 
medication was higher in the placebo group compared with the tralokinumab groups. The vast majority of 
rescue medication was TCS both in subjects with moderate and severe disease in all 3 treatment groups.

Use of rescue medication by region 
The use of rescue medication was comparable between North American and European subjects but higher 
use of rescue medication was observed for Australian and Asian subjects. The use of rescue medication was 
higher in the placebo group compared with the tralokinumab groups in all regions. The observation of higher 
use of rescue medication in Australian and Asian subjects may be a chance observation resulting from the 
low number of subjects in these subgroups. Furthermore, the observation in Australian subjects may also 
be driven by a higher proportion of subjects with severe disease at baseline in this subgroup. 
Panel 26 Use of rescue medication by region, initial treatment period: full analysis set 
Maintenance treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
The use of rescue medication was comparable between all treatment groups in the maintenance treatment 
period,  however  data  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  due  to  the  low  number  of  subjects  in  each 
treatment group. The use of rescue medication in the maintenance treatment period was generally lower 
than  in  the  initial  treatment  period,  and  only  topical  treatments  (mainly  TCS)  were  used  as  rescue 
medication.

Panel 27 Rescue medication by type, maintenance treatment period: subjects in FAS assigned 
to maintenance treatment period 
Open-label treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
The definition of rescue medication in the  open-label treatment period was different from the initial and 
maintenance treatment periods as use of mild to moderate TCS was allowed. Use of rescue medication was 
low in the open-label treatment period, which is consistent with the majority of the rescue medication used 
in  the  initial  treatment  period  being  TCS  and  the  allowance  of  mild  to  moderate  TCS  in  the  open-label 
treatment  period.  The  majority  of  the  rescue  medication  used  in  the  open-label  treatment  period  were 
topical treatments (primarily higher potency TCS).

Numbers analysed 
Full analysis set 
All subjects randomised to initial treatment who were exposed to IMP and not randomised at investigational 
sites with GCP non-compliance issues were included in the full analysis set (FAS) and were analysed for 
efficacy up to Week 16 (Visit 11). 301 subjects were randomised to treatment, of which 3 subjects were 
not dosed and 9 subjects were randomised at investigational sites with GCP non-compliance issues. Hence, 
the FAS comprised 289 subjects. 
Per protocol analysis set 
2 subjects from the FAS were excluded from the per protocol analysis set because they provided no IGA or 
EASI  assessments  after  the  start  of  the  treatment.  Hence,  the  per  protocol  analysis  set  comprised  287 
subjects. 
Maintenance analysis set 
The  maintenance  analysis  set  included  all  subjects  who  received  tralokinumab  in  the  initial  treatment 
period,  were  not  randomised  at  investigational  sites  with  GCP  non-compliance  issues,  and  were  re-
randomised to maintenance treatment. Hence, the maintenance analysis set comprised 50 subjects. 
Safety analysis set 
All 289 subjects from the FAS were included in the safety analysis set. 
Maintenance safety analysis set 
The maintenance safety analysis set comprised all subjects who were assigned to maintenance treatment, 
were not randomised at investigational sites with GCP non-compliance issues, and received at least 1 dose 
of maintenance treatment. Hence, the maintenance safety analysis set comprised 56 subjects. 
Open-label safety analysis set 
The open-label safety analysis set comprised all subjects who transferred to open-label treatment during 
the trial,  were  not  randomised  at investigational  sites  with  GCP  non-compliance  issues,  and  received  at 
least 1 dose of open-label treatment. Hence, the open-label safety analysis set comprised 234 subjects. 
Outcomes and estimation 
The first step of the testing hierarchy was the test of IGA 0/1 at Week 16 between tralokinumab 300 mg 
Q2W and placebo, which was evaluated at a 5% significance level. The difference between tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W and placebo in IGA 0/1 at Week 16 was statistically significant with a p-value of 0.002. 
As the first step in the testing hierarchy was statistically significant, the second step (i.e. EASI75 at Week 
16) was tested and evaluated at a 5% significance level, and the difference between tralokinumab 300 mg 
Q2W and placebo was also statistically significant for EASI75 at Week 16 with a p-value of <0.001. 
As the first and second steps in the testing  hierarchy were statistically  significant,  the  significance  level 
(alpha) was divided between the analyses of the 3 secondary endpoints for tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W (i.e. 
reduction  of  Adolescent  Worst  Pruritus  NRS  [weekly  average]  ≥4  from  baseline  to  Week  16,  change  in 
SCORAD from baseline to Week 16, and change in CDLQI from baseline to Week 16) and the analyses of 
the  primary  and  secondary  endpoints  for  tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W.  The  significance  level  was  evenly 
split, i.e. the secondary endpoints for tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and the primary and secondary endpoints 
for tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W were both tested at alpha = 2.5%. However, if all secondary endpoints were 
found to be statistically significant for one dose, alpha could be recycled for testing of the other dose.

The evaluations of the 3 secondary endpoints for tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W used the Holm- Bonferroni 
method for 3 ordered p-values at a 2.5% significance level to adjust for multiplicity. According to the Holm-
Bonferroni method, the p-values were ordered by increasing value and evaluated against the 3 alpha levels 
of 0.025/3, 0.025/2, and 0.025/1. For both ≥4-point reduction in Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS and change 
in SCORAD, the p-value was <0.001, hence these 2 tests were statistically significant as the p-values were 
below 0.025/3 and 0.025/2. For change in CDLQI, the p-value was 0.007, hence this test was statistically 
significant as the p-value was below 0.025/1. 
Since  all  tests in the above steps were statistically  significant, the  hypotheses for  tralokinumab 150 mg 
Q2W could be tested at a 5% significance level. The first step within the testing hierarchy for tralokinumab 
150 mg Q2W was the test of IGA 0/1 at Week 16 between tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W and placebo. The 
difference  between  tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W  and  placebo  in  IGA  0/1  at  Week  16  was  statistically 
significant with a p-value <0.001. 
As  the  first  step in  the testing  hierarchy  for  tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W  was  statistically  significant,  the 
second  step  (i.e.  EASI75  at  Week  16)  was  tested  and  evaluated  at  a  5%  significance  level,  and  the 
difference between tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W and placebo was also statistically significant for EASI75 at 
Week 16 with a p-value of <0.001. 
As  the  first  and  second  steps  in  the  testing  hierarchy  for  tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W  were  statistically 
significant,  the  3  secondary  endpoints  for  tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W  were  evaluated  using  the  Holm-
Bonferroni method for 3 ordered p-values at a 5% significance level to adjust for multiplicity. The p-values 
were ordered by increasing value and evaluated against the 3 alpha levels of 0.05/3, 0.05/2, and 0.05/1. 
For both ≥4-point reduction  in  Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS and  change  in  SCORAD, the  p-value  was 
<0.001 hence these 2 tests were statistically significant as the p-values were below 0.05/3 and 0.05/2. For 
change in CDLQI, the p-value was 0.040, hence this test  was statistically significant as the p-value was 
below 0.05/1. 
Primary endpoints 
There were 2 primary endpoints in this trial: 
• 
IGA score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear) at Week 16. 
•  EASI75 at Week 16. 
All analyses of the primary endpoints were based on the full analysis set and analysed according to their 
randomised treatment groups. 
The following 3 estimands were defined for the primary endpoints where the applied estimands incorporated 
2 main types of intercurrent events (initiation of rescue medication and permanent discontinuation of IMP) 
that influenced how the treatment effect was estimated: 
Primary estimand: ‘composite’: 
- assessed the treatment difference in response rate of IGA 0/1 and EASI75 after 16 weeks achieved without 
rescue medication between Week 2 and Week 16, regardless of treatment discontinuation. 
Secondary estimand: ‘hypothetical’: 
- assessed the treatment difference in response rate of IGA 0/1 and EASI75 after 16 weeks if all subjects 
adhered to the treatment regimen in the sense that they did not discontinue IMP permanently and no rescue 
medication was used from Week 2 to Week 16.

300 mg Q2W group, 28.6% in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group, and 6.5% in the placebo group. 
Confirmatory secondary endpoints 
To evaluate the efficacy of tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W on itch, severity and 
extent of AD, and health-related quality of life, the trial included the following 3 secondary endpoints: 
•  Reduction of Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) ≥4 from baseline to Week 16  
•  Change in SCORAD from baseline to Week 16  
•  Change in CDLQI score from baseline to Week 16  
All analyses of the secondary endpoints were based on the full analysis set. 
For each secondary endpoint, 3 estimands were defined where the applied estimands incorporated 2 main 
types  of  intercurrent  events  that  influenced  how  the  treatment  effects  were  estimated,  i.e.  initiation  of 
rescue medication and permanent discontinuation of IMP.

Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS 
The  absolute  and  percent  change  from  baseline  in  Adolescent  Worst  Pruritus  NRS  were  larger  in  both 
tralokinumab groups compared with the placebo group at each scheduled assessment through the initial 
treatment period. For tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W, separation to placebo (i.e. p<0.05 for comparisons) was 
observed from Week 7 to Week 16 for the absolute change from baseline in Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS 
and from Week 9 to Week 16 for the percent change from baseline in Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS. For 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W, separation to placebo was observed from Week 6 to Week 16 for the absolute 
change from baseline in Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS. 
The differences between the tralokinumab groups and the placebo group in the proportion of subjects with 
a ≥3-point reduction in Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS from baseline to Week 16 were 20.3% (p<0.001) 
with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and 21.8% (p<0.001) with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. The proportion of 
responders was 29.2% in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group, 30.5% in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W 
group, and 8.8% in the placebo group. 
The proportion of subjects with a ≥4-point reduction in Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS from baseline was 
higher in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W groups than in the placebo group 
at each scheduled assessment in the initial treatment period. Separation between tralokinumab 300 mg 
Q2W and placebo (i.e. p<0.05 for comparisons) was observed from Week 9 to Week 16 while separation 
between tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W and placebo was observed from Week 6 to Week 16. 
The proportion of subjects with a ≥3-point reduction in Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS from baseline was 
higher in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W groups than in the placebo group 
at each scheduled assessment in the initial treatment period. Both separation between tralokinumab 300 
mg Q2W and placebo and between tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W and placebo (i.e. p<0.05 for comparisons) 
were observed from Week 6 to Week 16. 
SCORAD 
The  absolute  and  percent  change  from  baseline  in  SCORAD  were  larger  in  both  tralokinumab  groups 
compared with the placebo group at each scheduled assessment through the initial treatment period. For 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W, separation to placebo (i.e. p<0.05 for comparisons) was observed from Week 
2  to  Week  16  for  both  the  absolute  change  and  the  percent  change  from  baseline  in  SCORAD.  For 
tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W,  separation  to  placebo  was  observed  from  Week  4  to  Week  16  for  both  the 
absolute change and the percent change from baseline in SCORAD. 
The proportion of subjects with SCORAD75 was higher in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and tralokinumab 
150 mg Q2W groups compared with the placebo group at each scheduled assessment from Week 4 to Week 
16.  Separation  between  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W  and  placebo  (i.e.  p<0.05  for  comparisons)  was 
observed from Week 10 to Week 16 while separation between tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W and placebo was 
observed from Week 8 to Week 16. At Week 16, the estimated difference to placebo was 11.5% (p=0.002)

Maintenance treatment period 
There were 2 maintenance endpoints in the maintenance treatment period: 
• 
IGA  of  0/1  at  Week  52  among  subjects  with  IGA  of  0/1  at  Week  16  achieved  without  rescue 
treatment from Week 2 to Week 16, after initial randomisation to tralokinumab.

•  EASI75 at Week 52 among subjects with EASI75 at Week 16 achieved without rescue treatment 
from Week 2 to Week 16, after initial randomisation to tralokinumab. 
Furthermore, assessments supporting the 2 maintenance  endpoints and assessments related to efficacy 
over time and HRQoL were evaluated in the maintenance treatment period. 
The subjects were assigned to maintenance treatment based on their randomised treatment in the initial 
treatment period and their clinical response at Week 16. The maintenance treatment period included the 
following groups: 
•  Week 16 responders initially randomised to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W were re-randomised to: 
- 
Tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W (hereafter referred to as tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W/Q2W). 
-  Tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W (hereafter referred to as tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W/Q4W). 
•  Week 16 responders initially randomised to tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W were re-randomised to: 
- 
- 
Tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W (hereafter referred to as tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W/Q2W). 
Tralokinumab 150 mg Q4W (hereafter referred to as tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W/Q4W). 
•  Week  16  responders  initially  randomised  to  placebo  were  assigned  to  continue  on  placebo 
treatment. 
Efficacy data  from  the maintenance  treatment period  should be interpreted with caution due to the low 
number of subjects in each treatment group (ranging from 11-14 subjects in the tralokinumab groups).

Open-label treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
There  were  no  protocol-defined  endpoints  in  the  open-label  treatment  period.  However,  based  on  the 
observation that the majority of subjects transferred to open-label treatment at Week 16, additional efficacy 
analyses in the open-label treatment period were included in the statistical analysis plan prior to database 
lock to support the evaluation of the long-term efficacy of tralokinumab. 
Subjects  were  assigned  to  maintenance  treatment  or  open-label  treatment  based  on  their  IGA  0/1  and 
EASI75 responder status at Week 16. 7 subjects were incorrectly transferred to open-label treatment at 
Week 16 despite achieving IGA 0/1 or EASI75.

Overall,  the  proportion  of  IGA  0/1  responders  increased  over  time  in  the  open-label  treatment  period, 
irrespective of treatment in the initial treatment period. Among the 214 subjects who transferred to open-
label treatment at Week 16, 31.3% (95% CI: 25.5 to 37.8) achieved IGA 0/1 at Week 52 without use of 
high potency TCS or systemic treatment (composite approach).

Panel 38 IGA 0/1 responders by initial treatment, estimation method, and week in the open-

Overall,  the  proportion  of  EASI75  responders  increased  over  time  in  the  open-label  treatment  period, 
irrespective of treatment in the initial treatment period. Among the 214 subjects who transferred to open-
label treatment at Week 16, 60.7% (95% CI: 54.1 to 67.0) achieved EASI75 at Week 52 without use of 
high potency TCS or systemic treatment. 
The proportion of EASI75 responders at Week 52 was higher for subjects initially treated with tralokinumab 
150  mg  Q2W  and  placebo  compared  with  subjects  initially  treated  with  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W 
(composite approach).

Panel 39 EASI75 responders by initial treatment, estimation method, and week in the open-
label treatment period: subjects in FAS transferred to open-label treatment at Week 16 
Post-hoc analysis of efficacy in the open-label treatment period 
In the FAS, 135 subjects initially treated with tralokinumab were transferred to open-label treatment at 
Week 16. 
•  70 subjects transferred from tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
•  65 subjects transferred from tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. 
For these subjects, 3 approaches were used to analyse clinical response during open-label treatment: 
•  Treatment policy approach (pre-defined): All data were used as observed. Subjects with missing 
data were imputed as non-responders. 
•  Composite  approach  (pre-defined):  Subjects  who  used  rescue  medication  during  open-label 
treatment  (high-potency  TCS  or  systemic  treatment)  were  considered  non-responders.  Subjects 
with missing data were imputed as non-responders. 
•  Post-hoc  composite  approach:  Subjects  who  used  concomitant  anti-inflammatory  treatments 
during  open-label  treatment  were  considered  non-responders.  Subjects  with  missing  data  were 
imputed as non-responders 
Use of rescue medication (high-potency TCS or systemic treatment) during open-label treatment was low 
(7.7%; 18/234 subjects) and consisted mostly of topical treatments (primarily higher potency TCS). 
Therefore, using the treatment policy approach or the composite approach essentially did not affect the

results, and only the treatment policy approach and the post-hoc composite approach are presented 
below.  
Of the subjects randomised to tralokinumab (150 mg or 300 mg) who did not meet the clinical response 
criteria at Week 16 and who were transferred to the open-label tralokinumab arm, 34.8% (47/135 subjects) 
achieved  IGA  0/1  and  60.7%  (82/135  subjects)  achieved  EASI75  at  Week  52,  based  on  the  treatment 
policy approach. 
TCS, irrespective of potency, was used by  50.0%  of  subjects during open-label  treatment. To  indirectly 
assess the effect of TCI, any TCS, or systemic treatment during the open-label tralokinumab treatment, 
IGA 0/1 and EASI75 responder rates were  also  derived using the post-hoc composite  approach.  To  this 
end,  subjects  who  used  concomitant  anti-inflammatory  treatments  during  open-label  treatment  were 
considered non-responders. Based on the post-hoc composite approach, 22.2% (30/135 subjects) achieved 
IGA 0/1 and 34.1% (46/135 subjects) achieved EASI75 at Week 52. 
Ancillary analyses 
To assess the consistency in response rates for the primary endpoints across different subgroups, the 
primary endpoints (IGA 0/1 and EASI75) in ECZTRA 6 were summarised by the following subgroups: 
•  Baseline IGA (moderate, severe). 
•  Region (North America, Europe, Australia, Asia). 
•  Race (white, Black or African American, Asian, other). 
•  Sex. 
•  Age group (12–14 years and 15–17 years). 
•  Body weight group (≤60 kg and >60 kg). 
•  Body weight groups (≤55 kg and >55 kg, ≤60 kg and >60 kg, ≤65 kg and >65 kg, ≤70 kg and 
>70 kg, ≤80 kg and >80 kg). 
IGA 0/1 and EASI75 at Week 16 by baseline IGA 
Within each treatment group, the proportion of IGA 0/1 responders was approximately 2.5- to 3-fold higher 
in subjects with a moderate disease (IGA = 3) at baseline compared to subjects with a severe disease (IGA 
= 4) at baseline.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Comparison of demographics and baseline characteristics of subject enrolled to ECZTRA 6 
versus ECZTRA 1 and 2. 
The demographics and key baseline characteristics in ECZTRA 6 were well balanced between treatment 
groups. The data were overall consistent with those in the monotherapy pool in adults, except for the 
expected differences in age and body weight between adolescents and adults, as well as a minor 
difference between adolescents and adults in the distribution of subjects between North America and 
Europe.

The baseline disease characteristics in ECZTRA 6 were also well balanced between treatment groups and 
consistent with those in the monotherapy pool in adults. It should be noted that results from the CDLQI 
and DLQI questionnaires cannot be directly compared due to differences in the items to be scored. 
However, in both adolescents and adults, median baseline CDLQI/DLQI scores were within the category of 
‘very large effect’ on subjects’ health-related quality of life.

Panel 48 Baseline disease characteristics in ECZTRA 6 and monotherapy pool (ECZTRA 1+2) 
Comparison of efficacy results in adolescents and adults 
The difference between tralokinumab and placebo was statistically significant for all the primary and 
confirmatory secondary endpoints, and the results for tralokinumab in adolescents resembled those seen 
in the adult population. 
For IGA 0/1, EASI75, change in SCORAD, and reduction of Pruritus NRS ≥4 at Week 16, the placebo 
response was lower in ECZTRA 6 than in the adult monotherapy pool, and thus the treatment difference 
to placebo was higher in adolescents than in adults. 
With respect to tralokinumab 150 mg versus 300 mg in ECZTRA 6, the responder rates for the primary 
endpoints were similar (including IGA 0/1 at Week 16, which is considered similar for tralokinumab 150 
mg and 300 mg, given that the IGA scale is relatively coarse and the IGA 0/1 response criterion is static).

Maintenance treatment period 
The maintenance of response for both IGA 0/1 and EASI75 in ECZTRA 6 was in accordance with previous 
findings in the adult monotherapy pool. Direct comparison of the results in adolescents with those in adults, 
as  well  as  comparison  between  the  different  maintenance  treatment  regimens  in  ECZTRA  6,  should  be 
interpreted  with  caution  due  to the  low  number  of  subjects  on  each  maintenance  treatment  regimen  in 
ECZTRA 6. 
Panel 51 Clinical response at Week 52 among subjects who met the clinical response criteria on 
tralokinumab at Week 16 without any rescue medication in ECZTRA 6 and monotherapy pool 
(ECZTRA 1+2) 
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The purpose of this submission was to provide data supporting the use of tralokinumab in adolescents (12–
17 years) with AD. In relation to supportive studies, the ECZTEND study is still ongoing and therefore only 
information on exposure, SAEs, and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of IMP for the adolescent 
subjects transferred from ECZTRA 6 was available.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The ECZTRA 6 study consisted of a screening period (2 to 6 weeks), an initial treatment period of 16 weeks 
and a maintenance treatment period of 36 weeks in subjects who obtained a clinical response at Week 16, 
and  a  concurrent  open-label  treatment  period  of  up  to  36  weeks  in  subjects  who  did  not  achieve  the 
protocol-defined clinical response at Week 16 or who received rescue treatment from Week 2 to Week 16. 
In this study performed in adolescents two  doses were tested during the initial treatment period i.e the 
dose which was investigated in adults i.e tralokinumab 600 mg at baseline, then tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W 
or the dose  reduced by half as compared to  the  adults dose  i.e tralokinumab 300 mg at baseline, then 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W.  
At Week 16, subjects with a clinical response (achieved without use of rescue treatment from Week 2 to 
Week 16) were re-randomised and included in the maintenance treatment period. During the maintenance 
treatment period four doses were tested (300 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q4W, 150 mg Q2W, 150 mg Q4W). Two

of  these  4  doses  were  investigated  in  adults  and  two  remaining  were  lower  as  compared  to  those 
investigated in adults.   
Although additional doses were tested in adolescents the applicant is not proposing to change posology for 
adolescents as compared to adults. The SmPC states:  
The recommended dose of tralokinumab for adult and adolescent patients 12 years and older patients is an 
initial dose of 600 mg (four 150 mg injections) followed by 300 mg (two 150 mg injections) administered 
every other week as subcutaneous injection.  
At prescriber’s discretion, every fourth week dosing may be considered for patients who achieve clear or 
almost clear skin after 16 weeks of treatment. The probability of maintaining clear or almost clear skin may 
be lower with every fourth week dosing. 
Eligibility criteria 
ECZTRA 6 enrolled adolescents (aged 12 to 17 years) with body weight at baseline ≥30.0 kg.  
Other eligibility criteria in ECZTRA 6 were similar to those used in ECZTRA 1 and 2 studies.  
Patients selected in ECZTRA 6 study had at least 1 year diagnosis of AD as defined by the Hanifin and Rajka 
(1980) criteria for AD. Active disease severity was rated to moderate-to-severe by baseline AD severity 
scores of IGA ≥3, EASI ≥12 (at screening) and EASI ≥16 (at baseline) and 10% BSA involvement with AD. 
In addition, the Adolescent Pruritus NRS average score had to be ≥4 during one week prior to baseline.   
However, there were some differences in relation to a history of topical corticosteroid use prior to enrolment. 
All enrolled patients were required to have a history of topical corticosteroid use (Europe: Class 3 or higher; 
US: Class 4 or lower) and/or topical corticosteroid treatment failure or subjects for whom these topical AD 
treatments are medically inadvisable. This inclusion criteria seemed to be wider as compared to the criteria 
used in ECZTRA 1 and 2 studies. In ECZTRA 1 and 2 studies all enrolled subjects were required to have an 
inadequate response to treatment with ‘TCS of medium to higher potency’ lasting at least 28 days (or the 
maximum recommended treatment duration in the product prescribing information if this was less than 28 
days) within 1 year prior to the screening visit. 
Therefore, the applicant was asked to discuss differences in relation to the inclusion criteria as compared 
to ECZTRA 1 and 2 studies. 
The applicant clarified that a history of TCS use only was not sufficient requirement for enrolling to ECZTRA 
6  study,  as  subjects  had  to  have  a  history  of  treatment  failure  with  TCS  (defined  as  either  inadequate 
response  or  intolerance).  In  addition,  the  applicant  clarified  that  the  potency  of  previously  used  TCS 
required to meet these inclusion criteria were the same in ECZTRA 1, 2, and  6. Therefore, the inclusion 
criteria used in ECZTRA 6 were not significantly different as compared to those used in the pivotal studies 
used in the original MAA. 
Primary endpoints 
The primary endpoints of this study were EASI-75 at week 16 and IGA 0 or 1 at week 16. These primary 
endpoints are considered adequate and in line with the CHMP recommendation.  
There were a number of secondary endpoints in the study; Endpoints under multiplicity adjustment for the 
initial treatment period were reduction of Adolescent  Worst Pruritus NRS (weekly average) of at least 4 
from baseline to Week 16, change in SCORAD from baseline to Week 16 and Change in CDLQI score from 
baseline to Week 16.  
In the study there was hierarchical testing with the results for the 300 mg dose tested first (primary and 
confirmatory secondary endpoints) before the results for the 150 mg dose was tested.

Endpoints  for  the  maintenance  treatment  period  were  not  under  multiplicity  adjustment.  The  main 
endpoints for this period were: 
• 
IGA  of  0/1  at  Week  52  among  subjects  with  IGA  of  0/1  at  Week  16  achieved  without  rescue 
treatment from Week 2 to Week 16, after initial randomisation to tralokinumab 
• 
EASI75 at Week 52 among subjects with EASI75 at Week 16 achieved without rescue treatment 
from Week 2 to Week 16, after initial randomisation to tralokinumab. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In study ECZTRA 6 a total of 347 patients were screened, of whom 301 were enrolled into the study and 
randomized  (101  subjects  randomised  to  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W,  100  subjects  randomised  to 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W and 100 subjects randomised to placebo).  
9 of the randomised subjects were enrolled at two investigational sites with GCP non-compliance issues (3 
subjects randomised to tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W, 1 subject randomised to tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W, 
and 5 subjects randomised to placebo). These subjects were excluded from the FAS as in 340 or 341 major 
GCP issues were identified.  
In total, 273 subjects (90.7% of all randomised subjects) completed Week 16 on treatment. Of these 273 
subjects,  94  subjects  were  treated  with  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W,  93  subjects  were  treated  with 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W, and 86 subjects received placebo. 
56 of the subjects in the FAS were assigned to maintenance treatment. 
•  24  subjects  initially  randomised  to  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W  were  re-randomised  1:1  to 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W or tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W. 
•  26  subjects  initially  randomised  to  tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W  were  re-randomised  1:1  to 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W or tralokinumab 150 mg Q4W. 
•  6 subjects initially randomised to placebo were assigned to continue placebo treatment. 
A total of 220 subjects (214 subjects included in the FAS and 6 subjects randomised at investigational sites 
with GCP non-compliance issues) were transferred to open-label treatment at Week 16. Additionally, 22 
subjects (20 subjects included in the FAS and 2 subjects randomised at investigational sites with GCP non-
compliance issues) transferred to open-label treatment after Week 16.  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics 
The  overall  mean  age  at  baseline  was  14.6  years  (ranging  from  12  to  17).  More  than  51%  of  patients 
enrolled to the study were male, and the majority of patients enrolled were white (56.7%). Asian subjects 
accounted for about 24 % of population, whereas black subjects accounted for 11% of subjects. 
Apart from a higher percentage of subjects with severe disease in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group 
(49.5%) compared with the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W (44.9%) and placebo (45.7%) groups, the baseline 
disease severity was  well balanced between treatment groups in the initial treatment period.  The  mean 
BSA at the baseline was 51%, the mean EASI score was around 32.  
As required by the trial protocol all patients enrolled to the study had used topical corticosteroids prior to 
recruitment. In addition, a significant percentage of patients had previously used systemic steroids (45%) 
and  topical  Calcineurin  inhibitors  (59%).  Systemic  immunosuppressants  (including  cyclosporine, 
methotrexate, mycophenolate and Azathioprine) were used by 21% of subjects.

It  is  noted  that  to  the  maintenance  treatment  period  a  significantly  lower  proportion  of  patients  with  a 
severe disease were enrolled as compared to patients who entered the initial treatment period. 
Rescue therapy  
If medically necessary (i.e. to control intolerable AD symptoms), rescue treatment for AD could be provided 
to trial subjects at the discretion of the investigator. For analysis of the primary estimand for the primary 
endpoints,  subjects  who  received  rescue  treatment  from  Week  2  to  Week  16  were  considered  as  non-
responders. Subjects had to use an emollient twice daily throughout the trial. During the initial treatment 
period  and  maintenance  treatment  period  use  of  TCS  of  any  WHO  class  and  other  AD  therapies  were 
classified as a rescue treatment.  
Overall, during the initial treatment period  recue  medications were used more frequently in the placebo 
group (56.4%) as compared to the tralokinumab groups (33.7% for 150 mg Q2W and 29.9% for 300mg 
Q2W). The vast majority of rescue medication used in this pivotal trial were topical corticosteroids and the 
use of rescue medication was higher in subjects with severe disease at the baseline. There was a significant 
variation  in  the  use  of  rescue  medication  between  the  regions  as  well  as  between  treatment  groups. 
Variability in the use of rescue medications between the regions was also observed in the studies provided 
in the support of the original MAA.  
The definition of rescue medication in the open-label treatment period was different from the initial and 
maintenance treatment periods as use of mild to moderate TCS was allowed. Use of rescue medication was 
low in the open-label treatment period (7.7% subjects). 
Primary endpoints results  
The primary endpoints i.e the proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 and the proportion of patients 
with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 for both doses investigated in the initial treatment period were met.  
In the primary analysis of the primary estimand, the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 was 
higher in both tralokinumab treatment groups (21.4% and 17.5% for 150 mg Q2W group and 300 mg Q2W 
group, respectively) than in the placebo group (4.3%) with p<0.001 for 150 mg Q2W group and 0.002 for 
300 mg Q2W group.  
Very similar results were observed for sensitivity analysis 1 of the primary estimand. 
Also the proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 was higher in the tralokinumab groups (28.6% and 
27.8 % for 150 mg Q2W group and 300 mg Q2W group, respectively) than in the placebo group (6.4%). 
The observed differences were statistically significant (p<0.0001 for each).  
For IGA 0/1 and EASI75, the placebo response was lower in ECZTRA 6 than in the adult monotherapy pool, 
and thus the treatment difference to placebo was slightly higher in adolescents than in adults. 
In ECZTRA 6, for IGA 0/1 the estimated difference to placebo was 17.5% (p<0.001) with tralokinumab 150 
mg Q2W and 13.8% (p=0.002) with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. By comparison, ECZTRA 1+2 for IGA 0/1 
the estimated difference to placebo was 9.8 % (p<0.001). 
In ECZTRA 6, for EASI-75 the estimated difference to placebo was 22.5 % (p<0.001) with tralokinumab 
150  mg  Q2W  and  22.2%  (p<0.001)  with  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W.  By  comparison,  ECZTRA  1+2  for 
EASI-75 the estimated difference to placebo was 16.9 % (p<0.001). 
In respect to the results of the primary endpoints, there were no significant differences for two doses tested.

Secondary endpoint results  
For  the  initial treatment  period  the  secondary  endpoints  results  support the effects  seen in the  Primary 
Endpoints.  For  secondary  endpoints  including  those  under  multiplicity  adjustment  (i.e.  a  reduction  of 
Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS of ≥4 from baseline, change SCORAD and CDLQI from baseline to Week 16, 
for both doses) statistically significantly better results were reported in patients receiving tralokinumab as 
compared to patients on placebo. 
The  choice  of  primary  estimand  for  the  continuous  SCORAD  and  DLQI  endpoints  is  not  agreed  as  the 
treatment effect under full adherence to assigned treatment without receipt of rescue is not considered to 
be of primary clinical relevance. The pre-specified primary estimand sensitivity analysis based on placebo-
based multiple imputation is preferred and is considered more suitable for presentation in section 5.1 of 
the SmPC. This issue was highlighted to the applicant during the original MAA and therefore the efficacy 
results in the SmPC for adolescents are presented in line with analyses presented for the ECZTRA 1, 2 & 3 
trials in the adult population. 
For change in SCORAD, and reduction of Pruritus NRS ≥4 at Week 16, the placebo response was lower in 
ECZTRA 6 than in the adult monotherapy pool, and thus the treatment difference to placebo was higher in 
adolescents  than  in  adults.  The  results  from  the  CDLQI  and  DLQI  questionnaires  cannot  be  directly 
compared due to differences in the items to be scored, and therefore no conclusion could be made for this 
endpoint. 
Dose selection summary 
In the ECZTRA 6 study in the initial treatment period two doses were tested whereas in the maintenance 
treatment period four doses were tested i.e 300 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q4W, 150 mg Q2W and 150 mg Q4W. 
Further, in the open label treatment period patients were receiving tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W with optional 
use of TCS and/or TCI.  
In relation to the efficacy results in the initial treatment period, no significant differences between doses 
were noted. For IGA 0/1 at Week 16, the differences as compared to placebo was 17.5 (8.4, 26.6) for 150 
mg W2Q and 13.8 (5.3, 22.3) for 300 mg W2Q. For EASI75 at Week 16 the differences as compared to 
placebo was 22.5 (12.4, 32.6) for 150 mg W2Q and 22.0 (12.0,32.0) for 300 mg W2Q. 
In relation efficacy beyond week 16 the available data for each particular dose regimen is limited although 
the highest amount of data are available for 300 mg W2Q + optional TCS regimen as this regimen was 
tested in 214 subjects transferred to the open label treatment period at week 16. For other monotherapy 
regimens (i.e 300 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q4W, 150 mg Q2W and 150 mg Q4W) investigated in the maintenance 
treatment period no firm conclusion can be made as the number of patients in each treatment group was 
too small.  
In relation to the safety results in the initial treatment period, no major differences between doses  were 
noted although slightly better results were reported unexpectedly for the higher dose (300 mg Q2W). AEs 
were reported in 67.3% of subjects in the 150 mg Q2W group and 64.9% of subjects in the 300 mg Q2W 
group.  SAEs  were  reported  in  3.1%  and  1%  of  subjects  in  150  mg  Q2W  and  300  mg  Q2W  groups, 
respectively. Severe AEs were reported in 5.1% in the 150 mg Q2W group and 3.1% of subjects in the 300 
mg Q2W group. For the maintenance treatment period the number of subjects was too small to allow for 
firm conclusion. 
In summary, for the initial treatment period no major differences between doses were noted although for 
safety slightly better results were reported for the 300 mg Q2W dose. 
The applicant was requested to justify the dose proposed for adolescents.

The dose 300 mg Q2W is justified based on the following: 
-The tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q2W dosing regimens tested in ECZTRA 6 showed similar 
efficacy on the primary and key secondary endpoints however numerically higher responses in the 300 mg 
Q2W dosing group were recorded for other clinical relevant endpoints such as responder rates for EASI50, 
reductions in POEM ≥6, CDLQI ≥6 and the reduction in the HADS total score. 
-AE of ‘dermatitis atopic’ (suggesting lack of response) had later onset and the number of such events was 
lower for tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W as compared to the 150 mg Q2W group 
-rescue medications (mainly TCS) were initiated later for tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W as compared to the 
150 mg Q2W group 
-absence of exposure-related safety concerns (as in the 300 mg Q2W group less TEAEs were reported as 
compared to the 150 mg Q2W group). 
Therefore, the CHMP endorsed the 300 mg Q2W dose. 
Efficacy beyond Week 16 
A long-term efficacy was assessed in the maintenance period and in open-label treatment period. 
The maintenance period included subjects who achieved clinical response at Week 16 without use of rescue 
medication from Week 2 to Week 16. During this period, four doses were tested i.e 300 mg Q2W, 300 mg 
Q4W, 150 mg Q2W, 150 mg Q4W. Non-responders at Week 16 and subjects who lost their response were 
transferred to the open-label treatment period where they were receiving tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W with 
optional use of TCS and/or TCI. 
In relation to the efficacy results beyond Week 16, they are comparable between adults and adolescents 
however the strength of evidence is lower as compared to the initial treatment period. 
Although percentage of responders in the maintenance period in ECZTRA 6 was similar to percentage of 
responders in the monotherapy pool (ECZTRA 1+2) these results should be interpreted with caution due to 
the  low  number  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  (ranging  from  11-14  subjects  in  the  tralokinumab 
groups) in ECZTRA 6. Further, endpoints in the maintenance period were not included in the multiplicity 
control strategy.  
The posology for adolescents is proposed to be the same as for adults i.e there is an option for every fourth 
week dosing after 16 weeks of treatment. However, 13 subjects were included in the maintenance period 
in the 300 mg Q4W arm. 
It is noted, that in the open-label treatment period the percentage of responders increased overtime. Among 
the  214  subjects  who  transferred  to  open-label  treatment  at  Week  16,  31.3%  (95%  CI:  25.5  to  37.8) 
achieved IGA 0/1 at Week 52 and 60.7% (95% CI: 54.1 to 67.0) achieved EASI75 at Week 52. However, 
the results in the open-label treatment were confounded by the fact that 50 % of subjects receiving TCSs 
in this period.  
The applicant acknowledged that the long term efficacy data in adolescents are limited however given that 
the efficacy and safety profile of tralokinumab 300 mg is overall  consistent for the adolescent and adult 
trial  populations,  extrapolation  of  maintenance  data  from  adults  to  adolescents  is  warranted.  This 
justification was accepted by CHMP. It was also noted that the long-term study ECZTEND is ongoing and 
the applicant will provide the CTR in Q4 2022.

To assess the consistency in response rates for the primary endpoints across different subgroups, the 
primary endpoints (IGA 0/1 and EASI75) in ECZTRA 6 were summarised by the following subgroups: 
•  Baseline IGA (moderate, severe). 
•  Region (North America, Europe, Australia, Asia). 
•  Race (white, Black or African American, Asian, other). 
•  Sex. 
•  Age group (12–14 years and 15–17 years). 
•  Body weight group (≤60 kg and >60 kg). 
•  Body weight groups (≤55 kg and >55 kg, ≤60 kg and >60 kg, ≤65 kg and >65 kg, ≤70 kg and 
>70 kg, ≤80 kg and >80 kg). 
Better response was observed in patients with moderate disease at baseline as compared to those with 
severe disease. In the groups of patients with severe disease at baseline there was only less than 10 % 
IGA 0/1 responders at Week 16 and less than 22 % of EASI75 responders at Week 16. The applicant was 
requested to discuss the use of the product in adolescents with severe disease. 
In  adolescents  with  severe  disease  the  treatment  response  was  lower  as  compared  to  adolescents  with 
moderate disease (IGA 3) however the response which was achieved in adolescents with severe disease 
was similar to the response observed in adult patients with the same level of disease severity investigated 
in the pivotal studies supporting the original MAA.  
In addition, the response which was achieved in adolescents with severe disease could be considered as 
clinically  relevant.  A  1-point  reduction  on  the  IGA  scale  represents  a  clinically  meaningful  reduction  in 
disease severity, but a subject with IGA=4 at baseline needed at least a 3-point reduction in IGA to achieve 
IGA 0/1. Based on the baseline EASI score in subjects with IGA=4 at baseline (mean = 40.4; minimum = 
16). a 75% reduction in EASI score in this subgroup was much larger than the 6.6-point reduction identified 
as the MCID on the EASI scale. The CHMP considered the applicant’s explanation acceptable. 
Analyses of interaction between treatment and subgroups for IGA 0/1 or EASI75 response rates suggested 
treatment response  variation among age subgroups for IGA 0/1 at Week 16 (p=0.02) and among body 
weight subgroups (≤60 kg versus >60 kg) for EASI75 at Week 16 (p=0.03). In the tralokinumab 150 mg 
Q2W group, the response rates were higher in the younger subjects. In relation to body weight (≤60 kg 
vs. >60 kg). For both IGA 0/1 and EASI75, response rates were higher in subjects with a body weight ≤60 
kg  in  the  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W  group  and  higher  in  subjects  with  a  body  weight  >60  kg  in  the 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group. The applicant was requested to provide a potential explanation of these 
results. The applicant discussed the observed variation in IGA 0/1 response rate across age groups as well 
as the observed variation in EASI75 response rate across body weight subgroups and it was agreed that 
the observed differences are likely to be a chance finding.

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Tralokinumab 150 mg solution for injection was approved by the European Commission on 17-Jun-2021 
under the name of Adtralza for the treatment of moderate-to-severe AD in adult patients who are candidates 
for systemic therapy.  
The  recommended  dosage  of  tralokinumab  in  adults  is  an  initial  dose  of  600  mg  followed  by  300  mg 
administered every 2 weeks by SC injection. Tralokinumab can be used with or without TCS. 
The  purpose  of  this  submission  is  to  provide  data  supporting  the  use  of  tralokinumab  in 
adolescents (12–17 years) with AD. 
The data supporting the use  of tralokinumab  in  adolescents derive from  1 pivotal trial and  2  supportive 
trials: 
Pivotal trial: 
•  ECZTRA  6  –  a  completed  phase  3  trial  in  adolescent  subjects  with  moderate-to-severe  AD  who 
received tralokinumab (150 mg or 300 mg) or placebo for up to 52 weeks. This study is the primary 
source of new safety data included in this application. 
Supportive trials: 
•  ECZTEND – an ongoing phase 3 extension trial in subjects with moderate-to-severe AD, including 
adolescent  subjects  who  completed  ECZTRA  6  and  who  will  receive  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W 
open-label  in  ECZTEND.  As  this  trial  is  ongoing,  only  information  on  exposure,  SAEs,  and  AEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation of IMP for the adolescent subjects transferred from ECZTRA 
6 is included in this application as additional long-term safety data. The data cut-off for the safety 
data from ECZTEND is 31-Mar-2021. 
•  CD-RI-CAT-354-1054 – a completed phase 1 trial in adolescent subjects with asthma who received 
a single dose of tralokinumab 300 mg. 
Patient exposure 
The overall extent of exposure to IMP in the 3 clinical trials which enrolled adolescents is presented below:

Panel 52 Total exposure in trials with tralokinumab in adolescent subjects 
In ECZTRA 6, the total exposure to tralokinumab was 235 PYE (mean: 0.852 PYE), and the total exposure 
to placebo was 31 PYE (mean: 0.329 PYE). 
In  ECZTRA  6,  166  (60.1%)  of  the  subjects  were  exposed  to  tralokinumab  for  52  weeks  or  more;  the 
corresponding  number  for  placebo  was  4  (4.3%)  subjects.  A  majority  of  the  remaining  subjects  were 
exposed to tralokinumab for at least 36 weeks, reflecting that most subjects who received placebo during 
the initial 16 weeks were subsequently transferred to open-label treatment with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W.

Adverse events  
ECZTRA 6 study 
Initial treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16) 
In the initial treatment period, the overall proportion of subjects reporting AEs was similar in all treatment 
groups, although the rate of AEs was higher with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W than with tralokinumab 300 
mg Q2W and placebo: 
•  64.9% and 441.0 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
•  67.3% and 596.6 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. 
•  61.7% and 479.7 events per 100 PYE with placebo. 
The majority of AEs in all treatment groups were mild or moderate in severity and the subjects recovered 
from most of the AEs. There were no clinically relevant differences in distribution across severities between 
the treatment groups. 
9 SAEs were reported in the initial treatment period and all subjects had recovered from the events by the 
end of the trial, although 1 with sequelae 
•  1 event in 1 subject (1.0%, 3.39 events per 100 PYE) with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
•  3 events in 3 subjects (3.1%, 10.23 events per 100 PYE) with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. 
•  5 events in 5 subjects (5.3%, 17.90 events per 100 PYE) with placebo. 
The proportion of subjects with AEs assessed  as possibly or probably related to IMP by the investigator 
(hereafter  termed  as  ‘related’  AEs)  was  similar  in  all  treatment  groups,  while  the  rate  was  higher  with 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W compared with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and placebo. 
Only 1 AE led to permanent discontinuation of IMP (‘drug withdrawn’; reported in the tralokinumab 150 mg 
Q2W group).

Panel 54 Overall summary of adverse events, initial treatment period: safety analysis set 
Maintenance treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
The safety data for the maintenance treatment period should be interpreted with caution due to the low 
number of subjects in each treatment group. 
AEs  were  overall  reported  at  a  lower  rate  for  tralokinumab  Q2W  in  the  maintenance  treatment  period 
compared with tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period for both doses. 
•  Tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W: 
-  441.0 events per 100 PYE in the initial treatment period. 
-  231.8 events per 100 PYE in the maintenance treatment period. 
•  Tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W: 
-  596.6 events per 100 PYE in the initial treatment period. 
-  343.6 events per 100 PYE in the maintenance treatment period. 
In the maintenance treatment period, the rate of AEs varied across treatment groups without any pattern 
being observed (rates ranging from 103.2 events per 100 PYE to 343.6 events per 100 PYE between all 
treatment groups). 
Except  for  1  severe  AE  reported  in  the  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W/Q2W  group,  all  AEs  were  mild  or 
moderate  in  severity.  The  subjects  recovered  from  most  of  the  AEs.  No  SAEs  were  reported  in  the 
maintenance treatment period. 
The rate of related AEs varied across treatment groups with no pattern being observed. 
No AEs led to permanent discontinuation of IMP.

Panel 55 Overall summary of adverse events, maintenance treatment period: safety analysis set 
Open-label treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
The rate of AEs for subjects treated with open-label treatment was 349.4 events per 100 PYE and hence 
lower than the rate of AEs with tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period (441.0 events per 100 PYE 
with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and 596.6 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W). 
The  majority  of  AEs  reported  for  subjects  treated  with  open-label  treatment  were  mild  or  moderate  in 
severity and the subjects recovered from most  of  the AEs. Severe AEs were reported at a lower rate in 
subjects  who  received  open-label  treatment  (2.65 events  per  100  PYE)  compared  with  subjects  treated 
with tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period (13.57 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 300 
mg Q2W and 34.09 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W). 
7 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects at a rate of 4.63 events per 100 PYE in subjects receiving open-label 
treatment and the rate was comparable with the rate of SAEs with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W in the initial 
treatment period (3.39 events per 100 PYE) and lower than the rate of SAEs with tralokinumab 150 mg 
Q2W in the initial treatment period (10.23 events per 100 PYE). 
Related AEs were reported at a lower rate for subjects who received open-label treatment (107.2 events 
per 100 PYE) compared with subjects treated with tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period (132.3 
events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and 184.1 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 
mg Q2W). 
There were 2 AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of IMP at a rate of 1.32 events per 100 PYE and 
the rate was comparable with the rate of AEs that led to permanent discontinuation of IMP with tralokinumab 
Q2W in the initial treatment period (0 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and 3.41 events 
per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W).

Panel 56 Overall summary of adverse events, open-label treatment: open-label safety analysis 
set 
____________________________________________________________________________________ 
Entire treatment period (Week 0 to Week 52) 
During the entire treatment period, AEs were reported in 214 out of 276 subjects (77.5%) exposed to any 
dose regimen of tralokinumab (‘tralokinumab total’) at a rate of 376.2 events per 100 PYE. For placebo, 
the numbers were 60 out of 94 subjects (63.8%) at a rate of 446.4 events per 100 PYE. 
Safety follow-up period (Week 52 to Week 66) 
In  the  safety  follow-up  period,  the  overall  proportion  of  subjects  reporting  AEs  and  the  rate  of  AEs  in 
subjects who had been treated with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W, tralokinumab 150 mg Q4W, tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W, and/or tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W (‘tralokinumab 150/300 mg Q2W/Q4W’) were generally 
low and comparable with those in subjects who had received open-label treatment (‘tralokinumab 300 Q2W 
+ TCS’) and placebo. 
•  14.7% and 98.49 events per 100 PYE after treatment with tralokinumab 150/300 mg 
-  Q2W/Q4W. 
•  14.4% and 94.08 events per 100 PYE after open-label treatment.

•  16.7% and 84.16 events per 100 PYE after receiving placebo. 
The majority of AEs were mild or moderate in severity and the subjects recovered from most of the AEs. 5 
severe  AEs  were  reported:  1  after  treatment  with  tralokinumab  150/300  mg  Q2W/Q4W  (2.9%,  14.07 
events per 100 PYE) and 4 after open-label treatment (2.1%, 8.75 events per 100 PYE). 
3 SAEs were reported in the safety follow-up period, all in subjects who had received open-label treatment 
(1.5%, 6.56 events per 100 PYE). 
AEs  assessed  as  related  to  IMP  were  only  reported  in  subjects  who  had  received  open-label  treatment 
(1.5%, 6.56 events per 100 PYE). 
No AEs led to withdrawal from the trial.

Adverse events by frequency 
In all treatment groups in the initial treatment period, the SOC with the highest incidence and rate of AEs 
were  ‘infections  and  infestations’,  ‘skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders’,  and  ‘general  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions’  and  the  most  frequently  reported  preferred  terms  were  ‘viral  upper 
respiratory tract infection’, ‘dermatitis atopic’, and ‘upper respiratory tract infection’. 
In the maintenance treatment period and in subjects receiving open-label treatment, AEs were generally 
reported with the same pattern of SOCs and preferred terms as for subjects treated with tralokinumab Q2W 
in the initial treatment period, with similar or lower rates compared to the initial treatment period. 
Initial treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16) 
In  all  treatment  groups,  the  SOCs  with  the  highest  incidence  and  rate  of  AEs  included  ‘infections  and 
infestations’,  ‘skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders’,  and  ‘general  disorders  and  administration  site 
conditions’. ‘Viral upper respiratory tract infection’, ‘dermatitis atopic’, and ‘upper respiratory tract infection’ 
were the most frequently reported AEs in all treatment groups.

There  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  incidence  and  rate  of  AEs  in  the  SOC  ‘infections  and 
infestations’ between the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group, the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group, and the 
placebo group. 
The most frequently reported preferred term within this SOC was ‘viral upper respiratory tract infection’, 
which occurred with higher frequency with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W compared with tralokinumab 300 mg 
Q2W and both frequencies were higher than with placebo. The incidence and rate of ‘upper respiratory tract 
infection’ were higher with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W than with placebo. 
•  SOC ‘infections and infestations’: 
-  38.1% and 169.6 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
-  40.8% and 204.5 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. 
-  34.0% and 168.3 events per 100 PYE with placebo. 
•  Preferred term ‘viral upper respiratory tract infection’: 
-  12.4% and 54.27 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
-  19.4% and 75.00 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. 
-  8.5% and 35.80 events per 100 PYE with placebo. 
•  Preferred term ‘upper respiratory tract infection’: 
-  11.3% and 37.31 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
-  8.2% and 34.09 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. 
-  4.3% and 17.90 events per 100 PYE with placebo. 
The  incidence  and  rate  of  AEs  in  the  SOC  ‘skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders’  were  higher  with 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W and placebo than with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. Within this SOC, ‘dermatitis 
atopic’ was the most frequently reported preferred term in all treatment groups and was more common 
with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W and placebo than with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
•  SOC ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’: 
-  12.4% and 44.10 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
-  21.4% and 85.23 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. 
-  18.1% and 85.92 events per 100 PYE with placebo. 
•  Preferred term ‘dermatitis atopic’: 
-  7.2% and 23.74 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
-  13.3% and 57.95 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. 
-  12.8% and 57.28 events per 100 PYE with placebo. 
The incidence and rate of AEs in the SOC ‘general disorders and administration site conditions’ were higher 
with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W compared with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and both were higher than with 
placebo. This was primarily driven by a higher frequency of events related to injection site reactions in the 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W groups.

Based on the MedDRA search capturing AEs belonging to injection site reactions, the incidence and rate of 
such AEs were higher with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W than with placebo.  
The imbalance between tralokinumab Q2W (both 300 mg and 150 mg) and placebo was mainly driven by 
the preferred terms ‘injection site reaction’ and ‘injection site pain’. All injection site reactions were non-
serious and mild or moderate in severity, and the subjects recovered from all the events. All events were 
assessed as related to IMP and none led to permanent discontinuation of IMP or to withdrawal from trial.

-  4.3% and 21.48 events per 100 PYE with placebo. 
The incidence and rate of AEs in the SOC ‘psychiatric disorders’ were higher with tralokinumab 150 mg 
Q2W compared with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and both were higher than with placebo. The majority of 
preferred terms within this SOCs were single events. 
•  SOC ‘psychiatric disorders’:

As observed in the initial treatment period, the SOCs with the highest frequency of AEs in the maintenance 
treatment period included ‘infections and infestations’ and ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’. The 
rate  of  AEs  within  these  SOCs  was  lower  for  tralokinumab  Q2W  in  the  maintenance  treatment  period 
compared with tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period for both doses. 
Within the SOC ‘infections and infestations’, the most frequently reported preferred terms were ‘viral upper 
respiratory tract infection’ and ‘upper respiratory tract infection’. The most frequently reported  preferred 
term within the SOC ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’ was ‘dermatitis atopic’. 
The remaining SOCs were less common (at most 2 events in either treatment group), except for the SOC 
‘general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions’  (6  events  of  ‘malaise’  reported  in  1  subject  in  the 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W/Q2W group)

and maintenance safety analysis set 
Open-label treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
As observed in the initial treatment period, the SOCs with the highest frequency of AEs for subjects receiving 
open-label treatment were ‘infections and infestations’ (131.0 events per 100 PYE), ‘skin and subcutaneous 
tissue  disorders’  (37.06  events  per  100  PYE),  and  ‘general  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions’ 
(45.66 events per 100 PYE). 
The most frequent preferred terms for open-label treatment were generally in line with the preferred terms 
for tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period. The frequent AEs (≥2% in any tralokinumab Q2W 
treatment group in the initial treatment period) reported for tralokinumab Q2W are presented by SOC and

analysis set 
As observed in the initial treatment period, ‘viral upper respiratory tract infection’, ‘upper respiratory tract 
infection’, and ‘dermatitis atopic’ were the most frequent preferred terms. 
Based on the MedDRA search capturing AEs belonging to injection site reactions, the rate of such AEs was 
26.47 events per 100 PYE and hence slightly lower than the rate observed with tralokinumab Q2W in the 
initial treatment period (33.92 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and 64.77 events per 
100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W). The most frequent preferred terms with open-label treatment 
were ‘injection site reaction’ (4.3%, 10.59 events per 100 PYE) and ‘injection site pain’ (1.7%, 13.23 events 
per 100 PYE). All the injection site reactions were non-serious, all events except for 1 were mild or moderate 
in severity, and the subjects recovered from all the events. All the events were assessed as related to IMP 
and none led to permanent discontinuation of IMP or to withdrawal from trial.

•  21.3% and 128.9 events per 100 PYE with placebo. 
In all treatment groups, the SOCs with the highest frequency of AEs considered related to IMP were ‘general 
disorders and administration site conditions’, ‘infections and infestations’, and ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue 
disorders’. 
The incidence and rate of related AEs in the SOC ‘general disorders and administration site conditions’ were 
higher with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W compared with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and both were higher 
than with placebo.

•  3.2% and 10.74 events per 100 PYE with placebo. 
In the tralokinumab groups, the majority of these AEs were related to symptoms at the injection site, e.g. 
‘injection site reaction’ and ‘injection site pain’, while such events occurred with lower frequencies in the 
placebo group. 
The incidence and rate of related AEs in the SOC ‘infections and infestations’ were similar in all treatment 
groups.

Maintenance treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
Related  AEs  were  reported  at  a  lower  rate  for  tralokinumab  Q2W  in  the  maintenance  treatment  period 
compared with tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period. 
The  rate  of  related  AEs  varied  across  treatment  groups  with  no  pattern  being  observed.  Except  for 
tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W/Q4W, all rates were higher than with placebo. 
None of these events were serious. 
During the maintenance  treatment period, all  related  AEs were reported as at most 1-2  event(s) in 1-2 
subject(s)  in  each  treatment  group,  except  for  ‘malaise’  (6  events  in  1  of  12  subjects  [8.3%]  in  the 
tralokinumab  150  mg  Q2W/Q2W  group).  There  was  no  clinically  relevant  difference  between  treatment 
groups in the frequency and distribution pattern of related AEs.

Open-label treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
Related AEs were reported at a lower rate in subjects who received open-label treatment (107.2 events per 
100  PYE)  compared  with  subjects  treated  with  tralokinumab  Q2W  in  the  initial  treatment  period  (132.3 
events per 100 PYE for tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W and 184.1 events per 100 PYE for tralokinumab 150 mg 
Q2W). 
As observed in the initial treatment period, the SOCs with the highest frequency of related AEs for subjects 
receiving open-label treatment were ‘infections and infestations’, ‘general disorders and administration site 
conditions’, and ‘skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders’. 
The most frequent preferred terms considered related to IMP for open-label treatment were generally the 
same as those for tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period and most of the events occurred at 
lower or similar rates with open-label treatment compared tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period. 
1 AE assessed as related to IMP (‘gastritis’) was serious. 
Safety follow-up period (Week 52 to Week 66) 
In the safety follow-up period, AEs assessed as related to IMP were only reported after open-label treatment 
(1.5%, 6.56 events per 100 PYE). All 3 related AEs were reported as single events within each SOC. None 
of these events were serious. 
Adverse events by severity 
Overall, the vast majority of AEs reported in the trial were mild or moderate in severity. In total, 31 severe 
AEs were reported, 21 events in the initial treatment period, 1 event in the maintenance treatment period, 
4 events in subjects receiving open-label treatment, and 5 events in the safety follow-up period. 
In the initial treatment period, 21 severe AEs were reported with no pattern in SOCs or preferred terms. 1 
of the 21 severe AEs led to permanent discontinuation of IMP and to withdrawal from the trial.  
In the maintenance treatment period, 1 severe AE was reported.  
In subjects receiving open-label treatment, 4 severe AEs was reported. 2 AEs of moderate severity led to 
permanent discontinuation of IMP and also to withdrawal from the trial.  
In the safety follow-up period, 5 severe AEs were reported.  
Severe adverse events (Week 0 to Week 16) 
In  all  treatment  groups,  all  severe  AEs  were  reported  as  single  events  across  a  number  of  SOCs  and 
preferred terms, except for ‘dermatitis atopic’ 
•  1 event in 1 subject (1.0%, 3.39 events per 100 PYE) with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. 
•  3 events in 3 subjects (3.1%, 10.23 events per 100 PYE) with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W. 
•  3 events in 3 subjects (3.2%, 10.74 events per 100 PYE) with placebo). 
•  1  severe  AE  (‘cerebrovascular  accident’  in  the  tralokinumab  150  Q2W  group)  led  to  permanent 
discontinuation of IMP and also to withdrawal from the trial for 1 subject). This event was reported 
as serious. 
Maintenance treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
1 severe AE was reported: the AE ‘cataract’ reported in a subject in the tralokinumab 300 mg  Q2W/Q2W 
group. The event was non-serious, considered not related to IMP, did not lead to permanent discontinuation 
of IMP or withdrawal from the trial, and did not resolve by the end of the trial.

Open-label treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
In each severity category, most of the individual preferred terms with open-label treatment were generally 
the same as those in the tralokinumab Q2W groups in the initial treatment period and most of the events 
occurred at lower or similar rates with open-label treatment compared with tralokinumab Q2W in the initial 
treatment period. 
In total, 4 severe AEs were reported (‘injection site pain’, ‘anaphylactic reaction’, ‘appendicitis perforated’, 
and ‘anorexia nervosa’) in 4 subjects receiving open-label treatment. These events were all serious and 
considered  not  related  to  IMP,  except  for  ‘injection  site  pain’,  which  was  non-serious  and  considered 
probably related to IMP 
Safety follow-up period (Week 52 to Week 66) 
All  5  severe  AEs  during  the  safety  follow-up  period  (‘anaphylactic  reaction’,  ‘intentional  overdose’, 
‘lipoprotein (a) increased’, ‘renal injury’, and ‘dermatitis atopic’) were reported as single events in single 
subjects in each treatment group within each SOC. 3 of these events (‘anaphylactic reaction’, ‘intentional 
overdose’, and ‘renal injury’) were serious and all were considered not related to IMP. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported during the trial. 
Other serious adverse events 
Overall, SAEs were reported with low frequencies in all treatment groups in the entire trial and no pattern 
in SOCs or preferred terms was apparent. In total, 19 SAEs were reported: 9 in the initial treatment period, 
7 with open-label treatment, and 3 in the safety follow-up treatment period. All SAEs were moderate or 
severe, all except for 1 SAE were assessed as not related to IMP by the investigator. 
Initial treatment period (Week 0 to Week 16) 
9 SAEs were reported in the initial treatment period. 
•  1 event in 1 subject (1.0%) with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W (3.39 events per 100 PYE). 
•  3 events in 3 subjects (3.1%) with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W (10.23 events per 100 PYE). 
•  5 events in 5 subjects (5.3%) with placebo (17.90 events per 100 PYE).

Panel 67 Overview of serious adverse events, initial treatment period: safety analysis set 
Description of SAEs reported in the treatment arms: 
1 subject in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group had a severe ‘cerebrovascular accident’ (reported term: 
‘stroke’) with hospitalisation 57 days after first dose of tralokinumab. The subject was discharged 3 days 
after the onset of the SAE. The subject was treated with acetylsalicylic acid and ondansetron. The subject’s 
risk  factors  for  stroke  included  hyperlipidemia,  pre-diabetes,  and  elevated  lipoprotein  A.  The  suspected 
cause for the SAE was elevated lipoprotein A. The event was considered not related to IMP by both the 
investigator and the sponsor and led to permanent discontinuation of IMP and to withdrawal from trial. The 
outcome was reported as recovered with sequelae (numbness and tingling in right foot) after 335 days. 
1 subject in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group had severe ‘cellulitis’ 79 days after first and 9 days after 
latest dose of tralokinumab. The subject was hospitalised 2 days after onset of the SAE and was treated 
with several treatments including intravenous antibiotics, intravenous antivirals, and pain medications along 
with  several  wound  care  treatments.  The  subject  was  discharged  3  days  after  hospitalisation  and  the 
outcome was reported as recovered 13 days after onset of the SAE. The subject’s medical history included 
3 prior episodes of cellulitis. IMP treatment was continued. The event was considered not related to IMP by 
both the investigator and the sponsor. 
1 subject in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group had a moderate ‘radius fracture’ after falling from a bicyle 
21 days after first and 9 days after latest dose of tralokinumab.  
1 subject in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group had severe ‘dermatitis atopic’ (reported term: ‘worsening 
of atopic dermatitis flare’) 94 days after first and 7 days after latest dose of tralokinumab. The subject was 
hospitalised with worsening of atopic dermatitis on the whole body and was discharged 3 days after the 
onset of the SAE. The subject was treated with several topical treatments. IMP treatment was continued.

The event was considered not related to IMP by both the investigator and the sponsor and the outcome 
was reported as recovered after 5 days. 
Maintenance treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
No SAEs were reported during the maintenance treatment period. 
Open-label treatment period (Week 16 to Week 52) 
7 SAEs were reported in 7 subjects (3.0%) receiving open-label treatment at a rate of 4.63 events per 100 
PYE, which was comparable with the rate reported with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W in the initial treatment 
period (3.39 events per 100 PYE) and lower than the rate reported with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W in the 
initial treatment period (10.23 events per 100 PYE). 
1 SAE (‘gastritis’) was considered related to IMP. 
Panel 68 Overview of serious adverse events, open-label treatment: open-label safety analysis 
set 
Description of SAEs reported in the treatment arms: 
1 subject had a moderate ‘gastritis’ with hospitalisation 318 days after first and 6 days after latest dose of 
IMP. The subject was discharged 5 days after the onset of the SAE. The subject was treated with oxycodone, 
tapentadol, pantoprazole, and a combination preparation of aluminium hydroxide, magnesium hydroxide, 
magnesium trisilicate, and simethicone. The subject’s risk factors for gastritis included occasional excessive 
alcohol consumption and excessive stress. IMP treatment was continued. The event was considered possibly 
related to IMP by the investigator, but was considered not related to IMP by the sponsor due to the subject’s 
risk factors. The subject recovered after 10 days. 
1 subject had a severe ‘anaphylactic reaction’ (reported term: ‘anaphylaxis to tree nut’) 302 days after first 
and 11 days after latest dose of IMP after ingesting a tree nut of unknown type.  
1 subject had a severe ‘appendicitis perforated’ with hospitalisation 117 days after first and 6 days after 
latest  dose  of  IMP.  Concurrent  AEs  of  ‘appendicitis  perforated’  (reported  term:  ‘sepsis,  secondary  to 
perforated appendicitis’) and ‘hyponatraemia’ were reported. The subject underwent an appendicectomy. 
The subject recovered from the SAE and AEs and was discharged after 5 days.  
1 subject had a moderate ‘concussion’ with hospitalisation 203 days after first and 7 days after latest dose 
of IMP as a result of being involved in a traffic accident (a car hit the subject while riding a bicycle).

1 subject had severe ‘anorexia nervosa’ during open-label treatment (146 days after first and 4 days after 
latest dose of IMP) and severe ‘intentional overdose’ during the safety follow-up period (432 days after first 
and 80 days after latest dose of IMP). 
The subject had been followed by a specialist in eating disorders since more than a year. The eating disorder 
aggravated since approximately Day 146. At the scheduled visit on Day 211, the investigator referred the 
subject to the specialist in eating disorders, who offered the subject to be hospitalised the following week. 
Between Day 219 and Day 407, the subject had 4 hospitalisations, with intermittent at-home periods of at 
most  10  days.  During  this  period,  the  following  relevant  concurrent  non-serious  AEs  were  reported: 
‘intentional self-injury’, ‘anxiety’, ‘family stress’, ‘insomnia’, ‘personality disorder’, ‘suicidal ideation’, and 
‘depression’. On Day 407, the subject was transferred to the psychiatric department from which the subject 
was discharged on Day 420. The subject was re-admitted on Day 432 for the SAE ‘intentional overdose’ 
after swallowing 10 ibuprofen tablets. The subject recovered from the ‘intentional overdose’ after 7 days 
and was discharged on Day 438. IMP treatment was continued. Both events were considered not related to 
IMP  by  both  the  investigator  and  the  sponsor.  The  outcome  of  ‘anorexia  nervosa’  was  reported  as 
recovering. 
1  subject  had  moderate  ‘obsessive-compulsive  disorder’  (reported  term:  ‘worsening  of  obsessive-
compulsive disorder’) 345 days after first and 52 days after latest dose of IMP. The subject was hospitalised 
with a worsening of obsessive-compulsive disorder on Day 345. The increase in symptoms were noted since 
the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The subject’s symptoms improved during the hospital stay 
and  the  subject  was  recovered  and  discharged  21  days  after  the  onset  of  the  SAE.  IMP  treatment  was 
continued. The event was considered not related to IMP by both the investigator and the sponsor. 
1 subject had moderate ‘suicidal ideation’ (reported term: ‘suicidal ideation due to concerns in the home’) 
302 days after first and 5 days after latest dose of IMP. During the visit on Day 283, the investigator noticed 
cuts on the subject’s forearms and wrists (reported as AE ‘intentional self-injury’) and referred the subject 
to a psychiatrist. The subject was seen by a psychiatrist on Day 302 and reported with the SAE ‘suicidal 
ideation’. The same day, the subject was admitted to hospital for further assessment and management and 
was discharged again later that day. The subject  was followed  up  regularly  and  was formally diagnosed 
with major depression disorder and generalised anxiety disorder (reported as AEs ‘depression’ on Day 325 
and ‘generalised anxiety disorder’ on Day 349). The subject started treatment with fluoxetine on Day 342. 
The subject had a family history of depression. IMP treatment was continued. The event was considered 
not related to IMP by both the investigator and the sponsor. The outcome was reported as recovered with 
sequelae (depression and generalised anxiety disorder) after 24 days. 
Based on a recommendation from the DMC, an external paediatric psychiatrist reviewed all AEs in the SOC 
‘psychiatric  disorders’.  The  conclusion  of  the  report  was  that  tralokinumab  is  considered  safe  and  not 
contributing to mental illness in the exposed population, and no action was taken by the DMC as a result 
of the report. 
Safety follow-up period (Week 52 to Week 66) 
3 SAEs  were reported in the safety follow-up period, in  3  subjects (1.5%) who  had  received open-label 
treatment (6.56 events per 100 PYE).

1 subject who had received open-label treatment had a severe ‘anaphylactic reaction’ (reported term: ‘food 
anaphylaxis’) with hospitalisation 410 days after first and 61 days after latest dose of IMP after ingesting 
pesto containing pine nuts.  
1 subject had severe ‘anorexia nervosa’ during open-label treatment (146 days after first and 4 days after 
latest dose of IMP) and severe ‘intentional overdose’ during the safety follow-up period (432 days after first 
and 80 days after latest dose of IMP).  
1 subject who had received open-label treatment had a severe ‘renal injury’ (reported term: ‘kidney lesion’) 
with hospitalisation 399 days after first and 46 days after latest dose of IMP as a result of being involved 
in a car accident.  
Adverse events of special interest 
In this trial, the following AEs were predefined as AESIs. 
•  Eczema herpeticum. 
•  Malignancies diagnosed after randomisation. 
•  Skin infection requiring systemic treatment. 
•  Eye disorders (conjunctivitis, keratoconjunctivitis, and keratitis). 
In total, 2 AESIs of ‘eczema herpeticum’, 24 AESIs of ‘skin infection requiring systemic treatment’, and 31 
AESIs of ‘eye disorders’ were reported in the trial. No AESIs of ‘malignancies diagnosed after randomisation’ 
were reported in the trial  
Eczema herpeticum 
In total, 2 AESIs of ‘eczema herpeticum’ were reported in the trial, both in the initial treatment period: 1 
event in 1 subject (1.0%) in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group (3.41 events per 100 PYE) and 1 event 
in 1 subject (1.1%) in the placebo group (3.58 events per 100 PYE). Both events were non-serious. The 
event in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group was moderate in severity and considered not related to IMP; 
the one in the placebo group was mild and considered related to IMP. 
Skin infections requiring systemic treatment 
Overall, the majority of AESIs of ‘skin infections requiring systemic treatment’ reported in the trial were 
non-serious and mild or moderate in severity. Approximately half of the events were assessed as related 
to the IMP, none of the events led to permanent discontinuation of IMP or to withdrawal from trial, and 
most of the subjects recovered from the events.

Biochemistry 
Overall summary of biochemistry parameters 
The following biochemistry parameters were assessed in ECZTRA 6: 
•  Electrolytes: sodium, potassium, calcium. 
•  Renal function parameters: creatinine, urea nitrogen, albumin, protein. 
• 
Lipids:  cholesterol,  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol,  high-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol, 
triglycerides. 
•  Other biochemistry parameters: glucose (non-fasting), lactate dehydrogenase, immunoglobulin E. 
• 
Liver parameters: ALP, AST, ALT, gamma glutamyl transferase, bilirubin. 
Throughout the trial, the mean levels of most biochemistry parameters assessed in ECZTRA 6 were within 
the normal reference range at baseline and the mean and mean changes showed only minor fluctuations

within the normal reference ranges. There were no clinically relevant differences between treatment groups. 
In line with the observations in the adult pools, no clinically relevant changes in biochemistry parameters 
(electrolytes, renal and liver function parameters, and lipids) were observed, based on the evaluation of 
means, values deemed PCS, and AEs. 
Liver parameters 
No cases of potential drug-induced liver injury (concurrent elevations of ALT or AST ≥3× ULN and bilirubin 
≥2× ULN) were identified in ECZTRA 6. 
In  line  with  the  observations  in  the  AD  pool  in  adults  (ECZTRA  trials  only)  the  incidences  of  PCS  liver 
abnormalities in ECZTRA 6 were low: 
•  PCS ALT levels (all between 3× and 5× ULN) were observed in 2 subjects receiving tralokinumab 
(150 mg Q2W initial treatment, and 300 mg Q2W open-label treatment). 
•  PCS AST levels (between 10×  and 20× ULN) were observed in 1 subject receiving tralokinumab 
(150 mg Q2W initial treatment). 
•  PCS  ALP  levels  (>1.5×  ULN)  were  observed  in  9  subjects  receiving  tralokinumab  (300  mg  Q2W 
initial  or  open-label  treatment)  and  in  5  subjects off-treatment  (who  had  received  tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W open-label treatment). 
•  No PCS liver abnormalities were observed in the placebo groups. 
The safety profile of subjects with PCS liver parameter values was comparable with that of the total trial 
population. For most of the cases, no AE related to the increased value was reported, i.e. the increases 
were not considered clinically significant by the investigator. There was no pattern or clustering of the type 
of AEs reported for these subjects.  
Throughout ECZTRA 6, few cases of liver parameters above the ULN were considered clinically significant 
and thus reported as AEs. 
Such  AEs  were  only  reported  in  the  tralokinumab  groups;  all  were  mild  in  severity,  and  none  led  to 
discontinuation of  the  IMP.  All  events  resolved  during  the  trial  except  for  an  AE  of  hyper-bilirubinaemia 
reported off-treatment, which was resolving by the end of the trial reported. As was the case for the AD 
pool, none of these AEs were reported as SAEs. 
Based on the above, it can be concluded that, as for the adult population, no clinically relevant changes in 
liver  or  hepatobiliary  parameters  were  observed  in  the  adolescent  population  in  ECZTRA  6.  No 
tralokinumab-induced cases of Hy's law or drug-induced liver injury were identified. 
Haematology 
Overall summary of haematology parameters 
The following haematology parameters were assessed in ECZTRA 6: 
•  Red  blood  cells:  erythrocytes,  haematocrit,  haemoglobin,  erythrocyte  mean  corpuscular 
haemoglobin concentration, and erythrocyte mean corpuscular volume. 
•  Platelets: thrombocytes. 
•  White  blood  cells:  basophils,  basophils/leukocytes,  lymphocytes,  lymphocytes/leukocytes, 
monocytes,  monocytes/leukocytes, 
neutrophils, 
neutrophils/leukocytes, 
eosinophils, 
eosinophils/leukocytes, and leukocytes.

Throughout ECZTRA 6, the mean and mean changes of most haematology parameters showed only minor 
fluctuations within the normal reference  ranges,  except for eosinophils and eosinophil/leukocyte counts. 
There were no clinically relevant differences between treatment groups. 
In line with the observations in the adult pools, no clinically relevant changes in red blood cells or associated 
parameters, platelets, or white blood cells (with the exception of eosinophils) were observed, based on the 
evaluation of means, PCS values, and AEs. 
Eosinophils 
More than 40% of the subjects in each treatment group in ECZTRA 6 had baseline eosinophil levels above 
the ULN (>0.5×109/L). These data were consistent with those in the adult pools. As also observed in the 
AD pool, there was a transient increase in eosinophil levels in the tralokinumab groups in ECZTRA 6. Mean 
changes from baseline were similar in ECZTRA 6 and the AD pool, and were at most around 0.2×109/L.

observations in the AD pool and monotherapy pool the safety profile of subjects with elevated eosinophil

levels  (>1.5×109/L)  was  comparable  with  that  of  the  total  trial  population.  There  was  no  pattern  or 
clustering  of  the  type  of  AEs  reported  for  subjects  with  elevated  eosinophil  levels  and  no  events  raised 
concerns  for  a  causal  relationship  to  the  eosinophil  count.  Although  no  eosinophilia-related  AEs  were 
reported in ECZTRA 6, eosinophilia is considered an ADR in adolescents  – as is also the case in adults – 
based on the clinical laboratory findings for eosinophils in this trial. 
Anti-drug antibodies 
Serum samples for determination of presence or absence of ADA were collected at Weeks 0,4, 16, 28, 52, 
and 66. 
The majority of subjects did not develop anti-tralokinumab antibodies or nAB. In total, 1 subject (1.0%) in 
the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W group, 7 subjects (7.1%) in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group, and 2 
subjects (2.1%) in the placebo group were tested positive for ADA at any time point post-baseline during 
the initial treatment period. 
During the entire trial (including the safety follow-up period), there were 22 subjects (8.0%) who had a 
positive  ADA  status  after  initiation  of  treatment  with  tralokinumab.  Among  tralokinumab-naïve  subjects 
(i.e. subjects not exposed to tralokinumab prior to ADA assessment), a positive ADA status was observed 
for 2 subjects (2.1%).

In ECZTRA 6, the proportions of subjects with treatment-emergent ADA were marginally higher than those 
reported for the adult population. However,  ADA titres and the presence of neutralising antibodies were 
similarly  low  and  were  deemed  not  to  have  an  impact  on  the  pharmacokinetics,  efficacy,  or  safety  of 
tralokinumab. 
Panel 76 Anti-drug antibodies in ECZTRA 6 and ADA ECZTRA analysis set 
Vital signs, physical findings, and other observations related to safety 
Consistent  with  the  observations  in  the  adult  population  no  findings  related  to  vital  signs,  physical 
examination, or ECG in ECZTRA 6 gave rise to any safety concerns. 
Digital ECG 
Overall, no clinically relevant changes in ECG parameters were observed during the entire treatment period. 
Only 1 subject shifted from a ‘normal’ or ‘abnormal, not clinically significant’ ECG evaluation at baseline to 
an ‘abnormal, clinically significant’ ECG evaluation during the treatment period. 4 AEs related to ECG were 
reported (during open-label treatment), all non-serious and mild or moderate in severity, of which 2 were 
considered related to IMP. 
During  open-label  treatment,  4  AEs  related  to  ECG  were  reported  in  3  subjects:  ‘tachycardia’, 
‘electrocardiogram QT prolonged’, and 2 events of ‘heart rate increased’ (both in the same subject, of which 
1 was reported as ‘temporary elevation of heart rate after IP’ on a day of IMP administration). 
Safety in special groups and situations 
Intrinsic and extrinsic factors 
The potential effects of intrinsic and extrinsic factors on the safety profile of tralokinumab in adolescent 
subjects were investigated based on AE data from the initial treatment period in ECZTRA 6, assessed by 
the following subgroups: sex, race, age, body weight, baseline IGA, and region. 
In line with the observations in the monotherapy pool in adults, no clinically relevant differences between 
subgroups  in  ECZTRA  6  were  identified  after  evaluation  of  AE  summaries  (overall  incidence,  event 
number/rate, causality, severity, and seriousness) and the AE distribution by SOC and PT. Furthermore, no 
differences in the incidences of SAEs were observed across the subgroups. Overall, the AE profile and AE 
distribution by SOC and PT were comparable across subgroups and resembled those observed for the total 
trial population  and there are  no indications  that intrinsic or  extrinsic  factors affect  the  safety  profile  of

tralokinumab  in  adolescent  subjects.  As  expected  from  multiple  comparisons,  however,  as  well  as  from 
variations in reporting practices across different demographic subgroups and across different regions, minor 
variations in the reporting of AEs were observed across some of the demography subgroups. This is also in 
line with the observations in the monotherapy pool in adults. 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
In the 2 completed trials and 1 ongoing trial with tralokinumab in adolescent subjects, 1 pregnancy has 
been reported prior to the data cut-off (31-Mar-2021).  
Panel 77 Pregnancy reported in adolescent subject treated with tralokinumab 
Owing to the limited number of pregnancies in both adult and adolescent subjects exposed to tralokinumab 
to date, the current data are not considered sufficient to inform about the pregnancy risks associated with 
tralokinumab exposure. Nevertheless, the available data from the clinical trials and nonclinical studies to 
date do not suggest that tralokinumab has an adverse effect on pregnancy or pregnancy outcomes. 
Overdose 
No overdose of IMP was reported in ECZTRA 6. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
A type II C.I.4 variation was submitted to update the SmPC with inclusion of the drug-drug interaction 
data on 27 September 2021 with corresponding procedure start 18 October 2021. As this variation is 
ongoing the proposed changes to the PI with this adolescent variation, do not contain the proposed 
changes for the C.I.4 drug-drug interaction variation. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of IMP and/or withdrawal from the trial were reported 
with low frequencies in the entire trial and no clinically relevant difference between treatment groups was 
observed. In total, 3 AEs led to permanent discontinuation of IMP, 1 event in the initial treatment period 
and 2 events with open-label treatment. 1 event was serious, severe, and considered not related to IMP. 
The other 2 were non-serious and considered related to IMP.

1  AE  led  to  permanent  discontinuation  of  IMP  and  to  withdrawal  from  trial  during  the  initial  treatment 
period: the AE ‘cerebrovascular accident’ reported in a subject in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group.  
The event was serious, severe, and considered not related to IMP.   
2 AEs in 2 subjects (0.9%) led to permanent discontinuation of IMP and to withdrawal from trial in subjects 
receiving open-label treatment: 
•  an  AE  of  ‘foreign  body  sensation  in  eyes’,  which  was  non-serious,  moderate  in  severity,  and 
considered possibly related to IMP. The subject had not recovered from the event by the end of the 
trial.  
•  an AE of ‘procedural anxiety’, which was non-serious, moderate in severity, and considered probably 
related to IMP. The subject had recovered from the event by the end of the trial. 
Post marketing experience 
At the time of submission of this application to extend the indication to adolescents, tralokinumab had only 
been approved for adults and had only been launched in 1 country to date (Germany, since mid-July 2021) 
after it was first approved in EU on 17-Jun-2021. This limited post-marketing experience did not indicate 
any new safety concerns with tralokinumab in adults. 
SmPC updates 
The following update to the SmPC (section 4.8) is being proposed: 
Adolescents 
The safety of tralokinumab was assessed in a study of 289 patients 12 to 17 years of age with 
moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis (ECZTRA 6). The safety profile of tralokinumab in these patients 
followed through the initial treatment period of 16 weeks and the long-term period of 52 weeks was 
similar to the safety profile from studies in adults. 
Description of selected adverse reactions 
In the adolescent trial, conjunctivitis occurred in 1.0% of atopic dermatitis patients treated with 
tralokinumab and in no patients treated with placebo in the initial treatment period of 16 weeks. 
Conjunctivitis allergic occurred at similar frequency in atopic dermatitis adolescent patients, who received 
tralokinumab (2.1%) compared to placebo (2.1%) in the initial treatment period of 16 weeks. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The data supporting the use  of tralokinumab  in  adolescents derive from  1 pivotal trial and 2 supportive 
trials: 
Pivotal trial: 
•  ECZTRA  6  –  a  completed  phase  3  trial  in  adolescent  subjects  with  moderate-to-severe  AD  who 
received tralokinumab (150 mg or 300 mg) or placebo for up to 52 weeks. This study is the primary 
source of new safety data included in this application. 
Supportive trials: 
•  ECZTEND – an ongoing phase 3 extension trial in subjects with moderate-to-severe AD, including 
adolescent  subjects  who  completed  ECZTRA  6.  As  this  trial  is  ongoing,  only  information  on 
exposure, SAEs, and AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of IMP for the adolescent subjects

transferred from ECZTRA 6 were provided in this application as additional long-term safety data. 
The data cut-off for the safety data from ECZTEND was 31-Mar-2021.  
•  CD-RI-CAT-354-1054 – a completed phase 1 trial in adolescent subjects with asthma who received 
a single dose of tralokinumab 300 mg.  
The design of ECZTRA 6 study was similar to the design of pivotal studies supporting the original MAA.  In 
this study, there was an initial treatment period of 16 weeks and a maintenance treatment period of 36 
weeks in subjects who obtained a clinical response at Week 16.  Non-responders or subjects who lost their 
response were transferred to the open-label treatment period where their received tralokinumab 300 mg 
Q2W with optional use of TCS and/or TCI. In the study, there was also safety follow-up period (Week 52 to 
Week 66).   
A number of dosing regimens were tested in the ECZTRA 6 study i.e 300 mg Q2W and 150 mg Q2W in the 
initial treatment period and 300 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q4W, 150 mg Q2W and 150 mg Q4W in the maintenance 
treatment period. 
Patient exposure 
In  total  423  adolescents  were  exposed  to  tralokinumab  in  three  clinical  trials  provided  in  support  this 
application. 276 out of these 423 subjects were exposed to tralokinumab in ECZTRA 6 trial which is the 
primary source  of new safety data for this application. In ECZTRA 6, 166 (60.1%) of the subjects were 
exposed  to  tralokinumab  for  52  weeks  or  more;  the  corresponding  number  for  placebo  was  4  (4.3%) 
subjects.  A  majority  of  the  remaining  subjects  were  exposed  to  tralokinumab  for  at  least  36  weeks, 
reflecting  that  most  subjects  who  received  placebo  during  the  initial  16  weeks  were  subsequently 
transferred to open-label treatment with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. It is noted that only a few subjects 
with a long-term exposure received tralokinumab as monotherapy.  
In the ECZTRA 6 study, in the initial treatment period, the incidence of AEs was slightly higher with 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W (67.3%) than with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W (64.9%) and placebo (61.7%). 
9 SAEs were reported in the initial treatment period i.e 1 event in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W, 3 in the 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group and 5 in the placebo group. 
The  majority  of  reported  AEs  were  mild.  Severe  AEs  were  reported  only  in  5.1%  of  subjects  in  the 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group, 3.1% of subjects in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W groups and 7.4% of 
subjects in the placebo group.  
Overall, AE incidences and rates observed during the initial treatment period in ECZTRA 6 were consistent 
with those seen in the AD pool in adults.  
The frequency of AEs reported in the maintenance treatment period varied between the groups with the 
highest frequency in the placebo group and lowest in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W group. No SAEs were 
reported in the maintenance treatment period. Except for 1 severe AE reported in the tralokinumab 300 
mg Q2W/Q2W group, all AEs were mild or moderate in severity.  
In  the  maintenance  treatment  period  AEs  were  overall  reported  at  a  lower  rate  for  tralokinumab  Q2W 
compared with tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period.  
However, the safety data for the maintenance treatment period should be interpreted with caution due 
to the low number of subjects in each treatment group (ranging from 11-14 subjects in the tralokinumab 
groups and 6 subjects in the placebo group). 
67.5% of subjects enrolled to the open label treatment period reported AEs. However, the rate of AEs 
for subjects treated with open-label treatment was lower than the rate of AEs in the initial treatment period 
(349.4 events per 100 PYE in the open label period versus 441.0 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W and 596.6 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W in the initial treatment period).

The majority of AEs reported were mild. Severe AEs were reported in 4 subjects. 7 SAEs were reported in 
7 subjects at a rate of 4.63 events per 100 PYE in subjects receiving open-label treatment and the rate was 
comparable with the rate of SAEs in the initial treatment period. There were 2 AEs that led to permanent 
discontinuation of IMP. 
In general, it can be concluded that no apparent increase in the frequency of AEs overtime and the rate of 
AEs for subjects treated with the open-label treatment was lower than the rate of AEs in the initial treatment 
period. 
Common AEs 
In all treatment periods (i.e initial, maintenance and open label), the SOC with the highest incidence and 
rate  of  AEs  were  ‘infections  and  infestations’,  ‘skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders’,  and  ‘general 
disorders and administration site conditions’. 
In the initial treatment period viral upper respiratory tract infection, dermatitis atopic, and upper respiratory 
tract infection were the most frequently reported AEs in all treatment groups.  
Viral upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reaction, injection site 
pain, nausea, dyspepsia and headache were reported with the higher frequency and with higher rate as 
compared to placebo. Upper respiratory tract infections and injection site reactions are listed in the SmPC.  
The incidence and rate of AEs in the SOC ‘psychiatric disorders’ were higher in the tralokinumab groups as 
compared  to  the  placebo  group  however  the  majority  of  preferred  terms  within  this  SOCs  were  single 
events. There was no apparent increase in the incidence and rate of AEs in the SOC of ‘eye disorders’. 
In general, in the maintenance treatment period and open-label treatment period types of AEs reported 
were  similar  to  those  reported  during  the  initial  treatment  period.  Again,  viral  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection’ and ‘upper respiratory tract infection were most frequently reported. There is no apparent increase 
in the frequency and rate of any type of AEs including injection site reactions. 
The distribution patterns of AEs across SOCs and PTs observed in ECZTRA 6 were generally similar to the 
patterns observed in adults, except for lower incidences and rates in ECZTRA 6 for AEs reported in the SOC 
‘skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders’  (mainly  driven  by  the  PT  ‘dermatitis  atopic’)  and  for  the  PT 
‘conjunctivitis’. 
Related AEs 
In general, during the initial treatment period in ECZTRA 6, the frequency and the rate of the related AEs 
was higher in the tralokinumab groups (26.5% for 150 mg Q2W and 25.8% for 300 mg Q2W) than for the 
placebo  group  (21.3%).  The  incidence  and  rate  of  related  AEs  in  the  SOC  ‘general  disorders  and 
administration  site  conditions  was  the  highest.  For  injection  site  reactions  a  few  preferred  terms  were 
reported including injection site reaction, injection site pain, injection site oedema, swelling and urticaria. 
In the maintenance treatment period and open-label treatment period  related AEs were similar to those 
reported during the initial treatment period. 
Adverse events by severity 
Overall, the vast majority of AEs reported in the trial were mild or moderate in severity. In total, 31 severe 
AEs were reported, 21 events in the initial treatment period, 1 event in the maintenance treatment period, 
4 events in subjects receiving open-label treatment, and 5 events in the safety follow-up period. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported during the ECZTRA 6 trial.

Overall, SAEs were reported with low frequencies in all treatment groups in the entire trial and no pattern 
in SOCs or preferred terms was apparent. In total, 19 SAEs were reported: 9 in the initial treatment period 
(4 in the treatment arms), 7 with open-label treatment, and 3 in the safety follow-up treatment period. All 
SAEs were moderate or severe, all except for 1 SAE were assessed as not related to IMP by the investigator. 
1 subject had a moderate ‘gastritis’ with hospitalisation 318 days after first and 6 days after latest dose of 
IMP. The event was considered possibly related to IMP by the investigator, but was considered not related 
to IMP by the sponsor due to the subject’s risk factors.   
The following SAEs required further discussion from the applicant: 
Cerebrovascular accident  
1 subject in the tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group had a severe ‘cerebrovascular accident’ (reported term: 
‘stroke’)  with  hospitalisation  57  days  after  first  dose  of  tralokinumab,  which  is  an  unusual  finding  in 
adolescents. Cases of stroke and TIA were reported in the adult clinical studies and this issue was discussed 
during the original MAA.  
The applicant considered that the occurrence in ECZTRA 6 of a single cardiovascular event with confounding 
factors  did  not  change  the  evaluation  from  the  original  MAA  that  treatment  with  tralokinumab  is  not 
associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events. This was accepted. The applicant was requested to 
present any further cases of cardiovascular events seen in adolescents in PSUR. 
Suicidal ideation 
During the initial treatment period in both ECZTRA 6 and the AD pool, suicidality events were only reported 
in the tralokinumab groups, albeit at a very low incidence (1 subject [1 event] in ECZTRA 6 and 2 subjects 
[2 events] in the AD pool). 
AD  is  associated  with  numerous  psychiatric  comorbidities,  including  depression  and  anxiety.  AD  is 
associated with an increase in proinflammatory cytokines, and an association between pro-inflammatory 
responses and depression and suicidality has been hypothesised (the ‘cytokine hypothesis’). There is no 
specific signal of increased risk of suicide by blocking IL-13 but since a diagnosis of AD is associated with a 
higher risk of depression and suicide, subjects who had a history of attempted suicide or were considered 
at significant risk of suicide attempt were excluded from the trial.  
AESIs 
In ECZTRA 6, the following AEs were predefined as AESIs: eczema herpeticum, malignancies diagnosed 
after  randomisation,  skin  infection  requiring  systemic  treatment  and  eye  disorders  (conjunctivitis, 
keratoconjunctivitis, and keratitis). 
In total, 2 AESIs of ‘eczema herpeticum (1 in the treatment arm) were reported.  
24 AESIs of skin infection requiring systemic treatment were reported in ECZTRA 6. The rate of skin infection 
requiring systemic treatment in the initial treatment period was higher in the tralokinumab groups (23.86% 
for 150 mg Q2W and 10.18% for 300 mgQ2W) as compared to the placebo group (7.16%). In addition, 
the rate of skin infection requiring systemic treatment was higher in adolescents as compared to the AD 
pool in adults.  
31  AESIs  of  ‘eye  disorders’  were  reported  in  the  trial.  Most  of  the  AESIs  of  ‘eye  disorders’  were 
conjunctivitis; only 2 events of keratitis and no events of keratoconjunctivitis were reported. The rate of 
conjunctivitis  was  slightly  higher  in  the  150  mg  Q2W  group than  in  the  placebo  group.  Conjunctivitis is 
listed in the SmPC. There was no increase in the rate of eye disorders in ECZTRA 6 as compared to the AD 
pool in adults. 
No AESIs of ‘malignancies diagnosed after randomisation’ were reported in the trial.

As for the initial safety evaluation of tralokinumab  in  adults, other safety  areas of  interest  in ECZTRA  6 
included:  anaphylaxis  and  serious  allergic  reactions,  immune  complex  disease,  injection  site  reactions, 
severe or serious infections, medication errors, suicidality and psychiatric disorders, rare adverse events, 
cardiovascular events of interest and malignancy. 
For these no imbalances were observed between ECZTRA 6 and the AD pool with exception of the incidence 
of severe infections requiring treatment with oral antibiotics/antivirals/antifungal for more than 2 weeks for 
which the higher rate was reported in ECZTRA 6 for tralokinumab 150  mg Q2W as compared to the AD 
pool.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Overall, AEs leading to permanent discontinuation of IMP and/or withdrawal from the trial  were reported 
with low frequencies in the entire trial and no clinically relevant difference between treatment groups was 
observed in the initial treatment period (cerebrovascular accident) in addition to the 2 events with open-
label treatment (foreign body sensation in eyes and procedural anxiety).  
Safety of doses tested 
In relation to the safety results in the initial treatment period, no major differences between doses were 
noted although slightly better results were reported unexpectedly for the higher dose (300 mg Q2W). AEs 
were reported in 67.3% of subjects in the 150 mg Q2W group and 64.9% of subjects in the 300 mg Q2W 
group.  SAEs  were  reported  in  3.1%  and  1%  of  subjects  in  150  mg  Q2W  and  300  mg  Q2W  groups, 
respectively. Severe AEs were reported in 5.1% in the 150 mg Q2W group and 3.1% of subjects in the 300 
mg Q2W group. For the maintenance treatment period the number of subjects was too small to allow for 
firm conclusion. 
ECZTEND trial 
The safety data for adolescents who entered ECZTEND trial  are very limited. It is noted that 1 SAE had 
been reported for an adolescent subject in this trial prior to the data cut-off date. The SAE was a mild event 
of ‘hypertension’. The investigator considered the association between the SAE and the IMP unlikely  but 
could not exclude it. The sponsor considered the SAE not related to the IMP and more likely explained by a 
recent COVID-19 infection. In addition, in this trial there was one AE leading to permanent discontinuation 
of IMP.  
The Applicant has not submitted an updated RMP with this application. This is considered to be acceptable 
by the Rapporteur. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
No major issues in relation to safety were identified.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative(s) of MS HU, MT and SI. 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
the updates to the Package Leaflet are very minor (added only that the information is relevant also for 
adolescent patients). No updates have been proposed to the Instruction for Use as no changes to the 
dose and the syringe have been made with this update. Adolescent patients were included in the Human 
Factor Study (provided with the initial MAA submission). The Human Factor Study demonstrated that 
adolescent patients were able to use the pre-filled syringe and understand the Instructions for Use. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Atopic dermatitis is the most common inflammatory skin disease in the developed world. It is more 
common in paediatric populations than in adults, with the 1-year prevalence in adolescents estimated to 
be approximately 15–20%. Although AD usually presents as mild disease in the paediatric population, 
around 10–30% of children with AD have moderate-to-severe disease. 
Disease signs and symptoms in moderate-to-severe AD are characterised by intense itch, xerosis, and 
recurrent eczematous skin lesions. In children from 2 years of age to puberty, AD typically involves the 
flexural surfaces of the extremities, head, neck, wrists, and ankles. 
In adolescents and adults, eczematous changes are typically seen on the head and neck, flexural surfaces 
of the extremities, and hands and feet. These signs and symptoms cause substantial morbidity and have 
a serious impact on the psychological wellbeing and health-related quality of life in affected children and 
their families. Compared with adolescents who do not have AD, adolescents with AD are at higher risk of 
the most common psychiatric conditions, including depression and anxiety, and this risk increases with 
increasing AD severity. Furthermore, children with AD are at higher risk of learning disabilities – with 
potential lifelong implications for health, educational, and social outcomes – and this risk also increases 
with increasing AD severity. An important treatment goal for patients in this vulnerable period of life is 
therefore to also improve their psychosocial wellbeing and ability to function in daily life. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Standard treatment for AD in adolescents is similar to that in adults, typically progressing in accordance 
with disease severity from mild topical anti-inflammatory therapy to high-potency topical therapy and in 
some cases systemic immunomodulatory therapy. 
TCS and TCI have limited efficacy in patients with moderate-to-severe disease. High-potency TCS, as well 
as systemic therapies except for the newer biologics and JAK inhibitors, are  reserved for severe disease 
and  are  associated  with  significant  safety  concerns,  especially  in  children  and  when  used  long-term. 
Cyclosporine, for instance, has common and severe side effects such as nephrotoxicity, hepatotoxicity, and

hypertension.  Cyclosporine  is  therefore  only  approved  for  the  treatment  of  severe  AD  and  is  only 
recommended  for  patients  where  the  expected  clinical  benefit  outweighs  the  risk  of  side  effects.  Some 
drugs in the JAK inhibitor drug class, including upadacitinib and ruxolitinib, have a black box warning by 
the FDA about increased risk of serious infections, heart-related events, cancer, blood clots, and death. 
As  AD  is  a  heterogenous, chronic  disease  characterised  by  flares  and exacerbations,  multiple  treatment 
options  are  necessary  for  adequate  long-term  disease  management.  Dupilumab  is  currently  the  only 
selective immunomodulating biologic therapy available for the treatment of AD in adolescents. However, 
some patients have inadequate response or unacceptable side effects with dupilumab. Hence, there is a 
need for additional well-tolerated treatments that target the underlying cause of AD and offer long-term 
disease control without intolerable side effects. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The data supporting the use of tralokinumab in adolescents derive from 1 pivotal trial and 2 supportive 
trials, as outlined below. The trials were conducted in accordance with the ICH guidance on GCP (ICH E6). 
Pivotal trial: 
•  ECZTRA 6 – a completed phase 3 trial in adolescent subjects with moderate-to-severe AD who 
received tralokinumab (150 mg or 300 mg) or placebo for up to 52 weeks. This randomised, 
double-blind trial is the basis for the clinical pharmacology and efficacy evaluation in adolescent 
subjects with AD and is the primary source of new safety data included in this application. 
Supportive trials: 
•  ECZTEND – an ongoing phase 3 extension trial in subjects with moderate-to-severe AD, including 
adolescent subjects who completed ECZTRA 6 and who will receive tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W 
open-label in ECZTEND. As this trial is ongoing, only information on exposure, SAEs, and AEs 
leading to permanent discontinuation of IMP for the adolescent subjects transferred from ECZTRA 
6 is included in this application as additional long-term safety data. The data cut-off for the safety 
data from ECZTEND is 31-Mar-2021. 
•  CD-RI-CAT-354-1054 – a completed phase 1 trial in adolescent subjects with asthma who 
received a single dose of tralokinumab 300 mg. PK profiling from this open-label trial is part of 
the clinical pharmacology evaluation, and information on AEs is included as supportive safety 
data. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The primary endpoints i.e EASI-75 at week 16 and IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 for both doses investigated in 
the initial treatment period were met. 
In the primary analysis of the primary estimand, the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 was 
higher in both tralokinumab treatment groups (21.4% and 17.5% for 150 mg Q2W group and 300 mg Q2W 
group, respectively) than in the placebo group (4.3%) with p<0.001 for 150 mg Q2W group and 0.002 for 
300 mg Q2W group.  
Very similar results were observed for sensitivity analysis 1 of the primary estimand. 
Also, the proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 was higher in the tralokinumab groups (28.6% 
and 27.8 % for 150 mg Q2W group and 300 mg Q2W group, respectively) than in the placebo group (6.4%). 
The observed differences were statistically significant (p<0.0001 for each).

For IGA 0/1 and EASI75, the placebo response was lower in ECZTRA 6 than in the adult monotherapy pool, 
and thus the treatment difference to placebo was slightly higher in adolescents than in adults. 
In ECZTRA 6, for IGA 0/1 the estimated difference to placebo was 17.5% (p<0.001) with tralokinumab 150 
mg Q2W and 13.8% (p=0.002) with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. By comparison, ECZTRA 1+2 for IGA 0/1 
the estimated difference to placebo was 9.8 % (p<0.001). 
In ECZTRA 6, for EASI-75 the estimated difference to placebo was 22.5 % (p<0.001) with tralokinumab 
150  mg  Q2W  and  22.2%  (p<0.001)  with  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W.  By  comparison,  ECZTRA  1+2  for 
EASI-75 the estimated difference to placebo was 16.9 % (p<0.001). 
For  the  initial treatment  period  the  secondary  endpoints  results  support  the  effects  seen in the  Primary 
Endpoints.  For  secondary  endpoints  including  those  under  multiplicity  adjustment  (i.e.    a  reduction  of 
Adolescent Worst Pruritus NRS of ≥4 from baseline, change SCORAD and CDLQI from baseline to Week 16, 
for both doses) statistically significantly better results were reported in patients receiving tralokinumab as 
compared to patients on placebo.  
For change in SCORAD, and reduction of Pruritus NRS ≥4 at Week 16, the placebo response was lower in 
ECZTRA 6 than in the adult monotherapy pool, and thus the treatment difference to placebo was higher in 
adolescents  than  in  adults.  The  results  from  the  CDLQI  and  DLQI  questionnaires  cannot  be  directly 
compared due to differences in the items to be scored, and therefore no conclusion could be made for this 
endpoint with regard to ECZTRA 6 versus the adult monotherapy pool. 
The  percentage  of  responders  in  the  maintenance  period  in  ECZTRA  6  was  similar  to  percentage  of 
responders in the monotherapy pool (ECZTRA 1+2). 
In  the  open-label  treatment  period  the  percentage  of  responders  increased  overtime.  Among  the  214 
subjects who transferred to open-label treatment at Week 16, 31.3% (95% CI: 25.5 to 37.8) achieved IGA 
0/1 at Week 52 and 60.7% (95% CI: 54.1 to 67.0) achieved EASI75 at Week 52.   
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
In the ECZTRA 6 study in the initial treatment period two doses were tested, whereas in the maintenance 
treatment period four doses were tested i.e 300 mg Q2W, 300 mg Q4W, 150 mg Q2W and 150 mg Q4W. 
Further, in the open label treatment period patients were receiving tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W with optional 
use of TCS and/or TCI. Although additional doses were tested in adolescents the applicant is not proposing 
to alter posology for adolescents as compared to adults.  
The applicant justified the dose proposed for adolescents as follows:  
-The tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W and 300 mg Q2W dosing regimens tested in ECZTRA 6 showed similar 
efficacy on the primary and key secondary endpoints however numerically higher responses in the 300 mg 
Q2W dosing group were recorded for other clinically relevant endpoints such as responder rates for EASI50, 
reductions in POEM ≥6, CDLQI ≥6 and the reduction in the HADS total score. 
-AE of ‘dermatitis atopic’ (suggesting lack of response) had later onset and the number of such events was 
lower for tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W as compared to the 150 mg Q2W group 
-rescue medications (mainly TCS) were initiated later for tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W as compared to the 
150 mg Q2W group 
-there was no exposure-related safety concerns (as in the 300 mg Q2W group less TEAEs were reported as 
compared to the 150 mg Q2W group) 
Based on the provided discussion the dose proposed to be used in adolescents is considered as justified. 
Although percentage of responders in the maintenance period in ECZTRA 6 was similar to percentage of 
responders in the monotherapy pool (ECZTRA 1+2) these results should be interpreted with caution due to 
Assessment report

Page 146/153 
 
 
 
 
the  low  number  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  (ranging  from  11-14  subjects  in  the  tralokinumab 
groups) in ECZTRA 6. Further, endpoints in the maintenance period were not included in the multiplicity 
control strategy.  
The posology for adolescents is proposed to be the same as for adults i.e there is an option for every fourth 
week dosing after 16 weeks of treatment. However, 13 subjects were included in the maintenance period 
in the 300 mg Q2W arm. 
It is noted, that in the open-label treatment period the percentage of responders increased overtime. Among 
the  214  subjects  who  transferred  to  open-label  treatment  at  Week  16,  31.3%  (95%  CI:  25.5  to  37.8) 
achieved IGA 0/1 at Week 52 and 60.7% (95% CI: 54.1 to 67.0) achieved EASI75 at Week 52.  However, 
the results in the open-label treatment were confounded by the fact that 50 % of subjects receiving TCSs 
in this period the applicant discussed these concerns and commented on long-term efficacy in adolescents. 
The applicant acknowledged that the long-term efficacy data in adolescents are limited however given that 
the efficacy and safety profile of tralokinumab 300 mg is overall  consistent for the adolescent and adult 
trial  populations,  extrapolation  of  maintenance  data  from  adults  to  adolescents  is  warranted.  This 
justification was accepted by the CHMP. It is acknowledged by the CHMP that the long-term study ECZTEND 
is ongoing and the applicant will provide the CTR in Q4 2022. 
There were uncertainties in relation to the use of the product in patients with severe disease at baseline, 
which required further discussion from the applicant.  
In  adolescents  with  severe  disease  the  treatment  response  was  lower  as  compared  to  adolescents  with 
moderate disease (IGA 3) however the response which was achieved in adolescents with severe disease 
was similar to the response observed in adult patients with the same level of disease severity investigated 
in the pivotal studies supporting the original MAA.  
In addition, the response which was achieved in adolescents with severe disease can be considered as 
clinically relevant. A 1-point reduction on the IGA scale represents a clinically meaningful reduction in 
disease severity, but a subject with IGA=4 at baseline needed at least a 3-point reduction in IGA to 
achieve IGA 0/1. Based on the baseline EASI score in subjects with IGA=4 at baseline (mean = 40.4; 
minimum = 16. a 75% reduction in EASI score in this subgroup was much larger than the 6.6-point 
reduction identified as the MCID on the EASI scale. This justification provided by the applicant is accepted 
and it is agreed that the product is also efficacious in patients with severe disease at baseline. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In ECZTRA 6 study, in the initial treatment period, the incidence of AEs was slightly higher with 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W (67.3%) than with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W (64.9%) and placebo (61.7%). 
9 SAEs were reported in the initial treatment period i.e 1 event in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W, 3 in the 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group and 5 in the placebo group. 
The  majority  of  reported  AEs  were  mild.  Severe  AEs  were  reported  only  in  5.1%  of  subjects  in  the 
tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W group, 3.1% of subjects in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W groups and 7.4% of 
subjects in the placebo group. Overall, AE incidences and rates observed during the initial treatment period 
in ECZTRA 6 were consistent with those seen in the AD pool in adults.  
AEs  were  overall  reported  at  a  lower  rate  for  tralokinumab  Q2W  in  the  maintenance  treatment  period 
compared with tralokinumab Q2W in the initial treatment period. The frequency of AEs varied between the 
groups with the highest frequency in the placebo group and lowest in the tralokinumab 300 mg Q4W group. 
No SAEs or deaths were reported in the maintenance treatment period. Except for 1 severe AE reported in 
the tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W/Q2W group, all AEs were mild or moderate in severity. 
Assessment report

Page 147/153 
 
 
 
 
 
67.5% of subject enrolled to the open label treatment period reported AEs. However, the rate of AEs for 
subjects treated with open-label treatment was lower than the rate of AEs in the initial treatment period 
(349.4 events per 100 PYE in the open label period versus 441.0 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 
300 mg Q2W and 596.6 events per 100 PYE with tralokinumab 150 mg Q2W in the initial treatment period).  
The majority of AEs reported were mild. Severe AEs were reported in 4 subjects. 7 SAEs were reported in 
7 subjects at a rate of 4.63 events per 100 PYE in subjects receiving open-label treatment and the rate was 
comparable with the rate of SAEs in the initial treatment period. There were 2 AEs that led to permanent 
discontinuation of IMP. 
In  general,  there  was  not  apparent  increase  in  the  frequency  of  AEs  over  time  and  the  rate  of  AEs  for 
subjects treated with open-label treatment was lower than the rate of AEs in the initial treatment period. 
In all treatment periods (i.e initial, maintenance and open label), the SOC with the highest incidence and 
rate  of  AEs  were  ‘infections  and  infestations’,  ‘skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders’,  and  ‘general 
disorders and administration site conditions’. 
In the initial treatment period viral upper respiratory tract infection, dermatitis atopic, and upper respiratory 
tract infection were the most frequently reported AEs in all treatment groups.  
Viral upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, injection site reaction, injection site 
pain, nausea, dyspepsia and headache were reported with the higher frequency and with higher rate as 
compared to placebo. 
The incidence and rate of AEs in the SOC ‘psychiatric disorders’ were higher in  the tralokinumab groups 
than with placebo however the majority of preferred terms within this SOCs were single events. There was 
no apparent increase in the incidence and rate of AEs in the SOC of ‘eye disorders’. 
In general, in the maintenance treatment period and open-label treatment period types of AEs reported 
were  similar  to  those  reported  during  the  initial  treatment  period.  Again,  viral  upper  respiratory  tract 
infection’  and  ‘upper  respiratory  tract  infection’  were  most  frequently  reported.    There  is  no  apparent 
increase in the frequency and rate of any type of AEs including injection site reactions. 
The distribution patterns of AEs across SOCs and PTs observed in ECZTRA 6 were generally similar to the 
patterns observed in adults, except for lower incidences and rates in ECZTRA 6 for AEs reported in the SOC 
‘skin  and  subcutaneous  tissue  disorders’  (mainly  driven  by  the  PT  ‘dermatitis  atopic’)  and  for  the  PT 
‘conjunctivitis’. 
In general, during the initial treatment period in ECZTRA 6, the frequency and the rate of the related AEs 
was higher in the tralokinumab groups (26.5% for 150 mg Q2W and 25.8% for 300 mg Q2W) than for the 
placebo  group  (21.3%).  The  incidence  and  rate  of  related  AEs  in  the  SOC  ‘general  disorders  and 
administration site conditions was the highest. 
No deaths were reported during the ECZTRA 6 trial. Overall, SAEs were reported with low frequencies in all 
treatment groups in the entire trial and no pattern in SOCs or preferred terms was apparent. In total, 19 
SAEs were reported: 9 in the initial treatment period (4 in the treatment arms), 7 with open-label treatment, 
and 3 in the safety follow-up treatment period. All SAEs were moderate or severe, all except for 1 SAE were 
assessed as not related to IMP by the investigator. 1 subject had a moderate ‘gastritis’ with hospitalisation 
318 days after first and 6 days after latest dose of IMP. The event was considered possibly related to IMP 
by the investigator but was considered not related to IMP by the sponsor due to the subject’s risk factors.   
In ECZTRA 6, the following AEs were predefined  as AESIs: eczema herpeticum, malignancies diagnosed 
after  randomisation,  skin  infection  requiring  systemic  treatment  and  eye  disorders  (conjunctivitis, 
keratoconjunctivitis, and keratitis). 
In total, 2 AESIs of ‘eczema herpeticum (1 in the treatment arm) were reported.

24 AESIs of skin infection requiring systemic treatment were reported in ECZTRA 6. The rate of skin infection 
requiring systemic treatment in the initial treatment period was higher in the tralokinumab groups (23.86 
for 150 mg Q2W and 10.8 for 300 mgQ2W) as compared to the placebo group (7.16).  
31  AESIs  of  ‘eye  disorders’  were  reported  in  the  trial.  Most  of  the  AESIs  of  ‘eye  disorders’  were 
conjunctivitis; only 2 events of keratitis and no events of keratoconjunctivitis were reported. The rate of 
conjunctivitis was slightly higher in the 150 mg Q2W group than in placebo group. Conjunctivitis is listed 
in the SmPC. There was no increase in the rate of eye disorders in ECZTRA 6 as compared to the AD pool 
in adults. 
As for the initial safety evaluation of tralokinumab in adults, other safety areas of interest were included in 
the evaluation of data from ECZTRA 6 based on pre-defined MedDRA search criteria. 
No imbalances were observed between ECZTRA 6 and the AD pool in respect of other safety areas of interest 
such as anaphylaxis and serious allergic reactions, immune complex disease, injection site reactions, severe 
or  serious  infections,  medication  errors,  suicidality  and  psychiatric  disorders,  rare  adverse  events, 
cardiovascular  events  of  interest  and  malignancy  with  exception  of  the  incidence  of  severe  infections 
requiring treatment with oral antibiotics/antivirals/antifungal for more than 2 weeks for which  the higher 
rate was reported in ECZTRA 6 as comparted to the AD pool. 
In general, the safety profile of tralokinumab in adolescents was similar to adults. No new major safety 
issues were identified. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
No major issues in relation to safety were identified.  
Further discussion was required for the following safety concerns: 1 subject in the tralokinumab 150 mg 
Q2W group had a severe ‘cerebrovascular accident’ (reported term: ‘stroke’) with hospitalisation 57 days 
after first dose of tralokinumab, which unusual finding for an adolescent patient. Cases of stroke and TIA 
were reported in the adult clinical studies and this issue was discussed during the original MAA. The 
applicant considers that the occurrence in ECZTRA 6 of a single cardiovascular event with confounding 
factors does not change the evaluation from the original MAA that treatment with tralokinumab is not 
associated with a higher risk of cardiovascular events. This is accepted. The applicant was requested to 
present any further cases of cardiovascular events seen in adolescents in PSUR.

3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The primary endpoints of this study were EASI-75 at week 16 and IGA 0 or 1 at week 16. These two primary 
endpoints were met.  
In the primary analysis of the primary estimand, the proportion of patients with IGA 0 or 1 at week 16 was 
higher in both tralokinumab treatment groups (21.4% and 17.5% for 150 mg Q2W group and 300 mg Q2W 
group, respectively) than in the placebo group (4.3%) with p<0.001 for 150 mg Q2W group and 0.002 for 
300 mg Q2W group.  
Very similar results were observed for sensitivity analysis 1 of the primary estimand. 
Also, the proportion of patients with EASI-75 at week 16 was higher in the tralokinumab groups (28.6% 
and 27.8 % for 150 mg Q2W group and 300 mg Q2W group, respectively) than in the placebo group (6.4%). 
The observed differences were statistically significant (p<0.0001 for each).  
In ECZTRA 6, for IGA 0/1 the estimated difference to placebo was 17.5% (p<0.001) with tralokinumab 150 
mg Q2W and 13.8% (p=0.002) with tralokinumab 300 mg Q2W. By comparison, ECZTRA 1+2 for IGA 0/1 
the estimated difference to placebo was 9.8 % (p<0.001). 
In ECZTRA 6, for EASI-75 the estimated difference to placebo was 22.5 % (p<0.001) with tralokinumab 
150  mg  Q2W  and  22.2%  (p<0.001)  with  tralokinumab  300  mg  Q2W.  By  comparison,  ECZTRA  1+2  for 
EASI-5 the estimated difference to placebo was 16.9 % (p<0.001). 
The results of other secondary endpoints for the initial treatment period including those under multiplicity 
adjustments are providing supporting evidence.  
In relation to the efficacy results beyond Week 16, they are comparable between adults and adolescents 
however the strength of evidence is lower as compared to the initial treatment period.  
Although percentage of responders in the maintenance period in ECZTRA 6 was similar  to percentage of 
responders in the monotherapy pool (ECZTRA 1+2) these results should be interpreted with caution due to 
the  low  number  of  subjects  in  each  treatment  group  (ranging  from  11-14  subjects  in  the  tralokinumab 
groups) in ECZTRA 6. Further, endpoints in the maintenance period were not included in the multiplicity

control strategy. The posology for adolescents is proposed to be the same as for adults i.e there is an option 
for  every  fourth  week  dosing  after  16  weeks  of  treatment.  However,  13  subjects  were  included  in  the 
maintenance period in the 300 mg W4Q arm. 
It is noted, that in the open-label treatment period the percentage of responders increased overtime. Among 
the  214  subjects  who  transferred  to  open-label  treatment  at  Week  16,  31.3%  (95%  CI:  25.5  to  37.8) 
achieved IGA 0/1 at Week 52 and 60.7% (95% CI: 54.1 to 67.0) achieved EASI75 at Week 52.  However, 
the results in the open-label treatment were confounded by the fact that 50 % of subjects receiving TCSs 
in this period. 
No major issues in relation to safety were identified.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Adtralza is currently approved for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adult patients 
who  are  candidates  for  systemic  therapy.  The  results  of  the  ECZTRA  6  study  are  considered  to  provide 
adequate  evidence  of  efficacy  of  Adtralza  in  the  treatment  of  moderate-to-severe  atopic  dermatitis  in 
adolescent patients 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy. The efficacy results for 
the initial treatment period are comparable between adults and adolescents.   
No major issues in safety were identified and the safety profile of tralokinumab in adolescents was similar 
to the safety profile in adults.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Adtralza for the treatment of moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis in adolescent 
patients 12 years and older who are candidates for systemic therapy is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the following 
change:

Extension of indication to include treatment of adolescent patients (12-17 years) for Adtralza based on 
final study LP0162-1334 (ECZTRA 6): a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study 
in adolescent patients 12 to 17 years of age with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis to evaluate the 
efficacy and safety of tralokinumab monotherapy in this population group. As a consequence, sections 
4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance. In 
addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet.  
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

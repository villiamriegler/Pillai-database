CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Myelofibrosis (MF) 
Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of disease-related splenomegaly or symptoms in adult patients 
with primary myelofibrosis (also known as chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), post polycythaemia vera 
myelofibrosis or post essential thrombocythaemia myelofibrosis. 
Polycythaemia vera (PV) 
Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with polycythaemia vera who are resistant to or 
intolerant of hydroxyurea. 
Graft versus host disease (GvHD) 
Jakavi is indicated for the treatment of patients aged 12 years and older with acute graft versus host 
disease or chronic graft versus host disease who have inadequate response to corticosteroids or other 
systemic therapies (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Jakavi treatment should only be initiated by a physician experienced in the administration of 
anti-cancer medicinal products. 
A complete blood cell count, including a white blood cell count differential, must be performed before 
initiating therapy with Jakavi. 
Complete blood count, including a white blood cell count differential, should be monitored every 
2-4 weeks until Jakavi doses are stabilised, and then as clinically indicated (see section 4.4). 
Posology 
Starting dose 
The recommended starting dose of Jakavi in myelofibrosis (MF) is based on platelet counts (see 
Table 1):

Starting dose 
20 mg orally twice daily 
15 mg orally twice daily 
10 mg orally twice daily 
5 mg orally twice daily 
The recommended starting dose of Jakavi in polycythaemia vera (PV) is 10 mg given orally twice 
daily. 
The recommended starting dose of Jakavi in acute and chronic graft versus host disease (GvHD) is 
10 mg given orally twice daily. Jakavi can be added to the continued use of corticosteroids and/or 
calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs). 
Dose modifications 
Doses may be titrated based on efficacy and safety. 
Myelofibrosis and polycythaemia vera 
If efficacy is considered insufficient and blood counts are adequate, doses may be increased by a 
maximum of 5 mg twice daily, up to the maximum dose of 25 mg twice daily. 
The starting dose should not be increased within the first four weeks of treatment and thereafter no 
more frequently than at 2-week intervals. 
Treatment should be discontinued for platelet counts less than 50,000/mm3 or absolute neutrophil 
counts less than 500/mm3. In PV, treatment should also be interrupted when haemoglobin is below 
8 g/dl. After recovery of blood counts above these levels, dosing may be re-started at 5 mg twice daily 
and gradually increased based on careful monitoring of complete blood cell count, including a white 
blood cell count differential. 
Dose reductions should be considered if the platelet count decreases during treatment as outlined in 
Table 2, with the goal of avoiding dose interruptions for thrombocytopenia.

Graft versus host disease 
Dose reductions and temporary interruptions of treatment may be needed in GvHD-patients with 
thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, or elevated total bilirubin after standard supportive therapy including 
growth-factors, anti-infective therapies and transfusions. One dose level reduction step is 
recommended (10 mg twice daily to 5 mg twice daily or 5 mg twice daily to 5 mg once daily). In 
patients who are unable to tolerate Jakavi at a dose of 5 mg once daily, treatment should be 
interrupted. Detailed dosing recommendations are provided in Table 3.

Dosing recommendation 
Reduce Jakavi by one dose level. If platelet count 
≥20,000/mm3 within seven days, dose may be increased to 
initial dose level, otherwise maintain reduced dose. 
Hold Jakavi until platelet count ≥20,000/mm3, then resume at 
one lower dose level. 
Reduce Jakavi by one dose level. Resume at initial dose level 
if ANC >1,000/mm3. 
Hold Jakavi until ANC >500/mm3, then resume at one lower 
dose level. If ANC >1,000/mm3, dosing may resume at initial 
dose level. 
>3.0 to 5.0 x upper limit of normal (ULN): Continue Jakavi 
at one lower dose level until ≤3.0 x ULN. 
>5.0 to 10.0 x ULN: Hold Jakavi up to 14 days until total 
bilirubin ≤3.0 x ULN. If total bilirubin ≤3.0 x ULN dosing 
may resume at current dose. If not ≤3.0 x ULN after 14 days, 
resume at one lower dose level. 
>10.0 x ULN: Hold Jakavi until total bilirubin ≤3.0 x ULN, 
then resume at one lower dose level. 
>3.0 x ULN: Continue Jakavi at one lower dose level until 
total bilirubin ≤3.0 x ULN. 
Dose adjustment with concomitant strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or dual CYP2C9/3A4 inhibitors 
When ruxolitinib is administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or dual inhibitors of CYP2C9 and 
CYP3A4 enzymes (e.g. fluconazole) the unit dose of ruxolitinib should be reduced by approximately 
50%, to be administered twice daily (see section 4.5). The concomitant use of ruxolitinib with 
fluconazole doses greater than 200 mg daily should be avoided. 
More frequent monitoring (e.g. twice a week) of haematology parameters and of clinical signs and 
symptoms of ruxolitinib-related adverse drug reactions is recommended while on strong CYP3A4 
inhibitors or dual inhibitors of CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes.

Special populations 
Renal impairment 
No specific dose adjustment is needed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
In patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance less than 30 ml/min) the recommended 
starting dose based on platelet count for MF patients should be reduced by approximately 50% to be 
administered twice daily. The recommended starting dose for PV and GvHD patients with severe renal 
impairment is 5 mg twice daily. Patients should be carefully monitored with regard to safety and 
efficacy during ruxolitinib treatment. 
There are limited data to determine the best dosing options for patients with end-stage renal disease 
(ESRD) on haemodialysis. Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic simulations based on available data in 
this population suggest that the starting dose for MF patients with ESRD on haemodialysis is a single 
dose of 15-20 mg or two doses of 10 mg given 12 hours apart, to be administered post-dialysis and 
only on the day of haemodialysis. A single dose of 15 mg is recommended for MF patients with 
platelet count between 100,000/mm3 and 200,000/mm3. A single dose of 20 mg or two doses of 10 mg 
given 12 hours apart is recommended for MF patients with platelet count of >200,000/mm3. 
Subsequent doses (single administration or two doses of 10 mg given 12 hours apart) should be 
administered only on haemodialysis days following each dialysis session. 
The recommended starting dose for PV patients with ESRD on haemodialysis is a single dose of 
10 mg or two doses of 5 mg given 12 hours apart, to be administered post-dialysis and only on the day 
of haemodialysis. These dose recommendations are based on simulations and any dose modification in 
ESRD should be followed by careful monitoring of safety and efficacy in individual patients. No data 
is available for dosing patients who are undergoing peritoneal dialysis or continuous venovenous 
haemofiltration (see section 5.2). 
There are no data for GvHD patients with ESRD. 
Hepatic impairment 
In MF patients with any hepatic impairment the recommended starting dose based on platelet count 
should be reduced by approximately 50% to be administered twice daily. Subsequent doses should be 
adjusted based on careful monitoring of safety and efficacy. The recommended starting dose is 5 mg 
twice daily for PV patients. Patients diagnosed with hepatic impairment while receiving ruxolitinib 
should have complete blood counts, including a white blood cell count differential, monitored at least 
every one to two weeks for the first 6 weeks after initiation of therapy with ruxolitinib and as clinically 
indicated thereafter once their liver function and blood counts have been stabilised. Ruxolitinib dose 
can be titrated to reduce the risk of cytopenia. 
In patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment not related to GvHD, the starting dose of 
ruxolitinib should be reduced by 50% (see section 5.2). 
In patients with GvHD liver involvement and an increase of total bilirubin to >3 x ULN, blood counts 
should be monitored more frequently for toxicity and a dose reduction by one dose level is 
recommended. 
Elderly patients (≥65 years) 
No additional dose adjustments are recommended for elderly patients.

Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Jakavi in children and adolescents aged up to 18 years with MF and PV 
have not been established. No data are available (see section 5.1). 
In paediatric patients (12 years of age and older) with GvHD, the safety and efficacy of Jakavi are 
supported by evidence from the randomised phase 3 studies REACH2 and REACH3. The Jakavi dose 
in paediatric patients with GvHD aged 12 years and older is the same as in adults. The safety and 
efficacy of Jakavi have not been established in patients less than 12 years of age. 
Treatment discontinuation 
Treatment of MF and PV may be continued as long as the benefit-risk remains positive. However the 
treatment should be discontinued after 6 months if there has been no reduction in spleen size or 
improvement in symptoms since initiation of therapy. 
It is recommended that, for patients who have demonstrated some degree of clinical improvement, 
ruxolitinib therapy be discontinued if they sustain an increase in their spleen length of 40% compared 
with baseline size (roughly equivalent to a 25% increase in spleen volume) and no longer have 
tangible improvement in disease-related symptoms. 
In GvHD, tapering of Jakavi may be considered in patients with a response and after having 
discontinued corticosteroids. A 50% dose reduction of Jakavi every two months is recommended. If 
signs or symptoms of GvHD reoccur during or after the taper of Jakavi, re-escalation of treatment 
should be considered. 
Method of administration 
Jakavi is to be taken orally, with or without food. 
If a dose is missed, the patient should not take an additional dose, but should take the next usual 
prescribed dose. 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
Pregnancy and lactation. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Myelosuppression 
Treatment with Jakavi can cause haematological adverse drug reactions, including thrombocytopenia, 
anaemia and neutropenia. A complete blood count, including a white blood cell count differential, 
must be performed before initiating therapy with Jakavi. Treatment should be discontinued in MF 
patients with platelet count less than 50,000/mm3 or absoute neutrophil count less than 500/mm3 (see 
section 4.2). 
It has been observed that MF patients with low platelet counts (<200,000/mm3) at the start of therapy 
are more likely to develop thrombocytopenia during treatment. 
Thrombocytopenia is generally reversible and is usually managed by reducing the dose or temporarily 
withholding Jakavi (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). However, platelet transfusions may be required as 
clinically indicated. 
Patients developing anaemia may require blood transfusions. Dose modifications or interruption for 
patients developing anaemia may also need to be considered.

Patients with a haemoglobin level below 10.0 g/dl at the beginning of the treatment have a higher risk 
of developing a haemoglobin level below 8.0 g/dl during treatment compared to patients with a higher 
baseline haemoglobin level (79.3% versus 30.1%). More frequent monitoring of haematology 
parameters and of clinical signs and symptoms of Jakavi-related adverse drug reactions is 
recommended for patients with baseline haemoglobin below 10.0 g/dl. 
Neutropenia (absolute neutrophil count <500) was generally reversible and was managed by 
temporarily withholding Jakavi (see sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Complete blood counts should be monitored as clinically indicated and dose adjusted as required (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.8). 
Infections 
Serious bacterial, mycobacterial, fungal, viral and other opportunistic infections have occurred in 
patients treated with Jakavi. Patients should be assessed for the risk of developing serious infections. 
Physicians should carefully observe patients receiving Jakavi for signs and symptoms of infections 
and initiate appropriate treatment promptly. Treatment with Jakavi should not be started until active 
serious infections have resolved. 
Tuberculosis has been reported in patients receiving Jakavi. Before starting treatment, patients should 
be evaluated for active and inactive (“latent”) tuberculosis, as per local recommendations. This can 
include medical history, possible previous contact with tuberculosis, and/or appropriate screening such 
as lung x-ray, tuberculin test and/or interferon-gamma release assay, as applicable. Prescribers are 
reminded of the risk of false negative tuberculin skin test results, especially in patients who are 
severely ill or immunocompromised. 
Hepatitis B viral load (HBV-DNA titre) increases, with and without associated elevations in alanine 
aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase, have been reported in patients with chronic HBV 
infections taking Jakavi. It is recommended to screen for HBV prior to commencing treatment with 
Jakavi. Patients with chronic HBV infection should be treated and monitored according to clinical 
guidelines. 
Herpes zoster 
Physicians should educate patients about early signs and symptoms of herpes zoster, advising that 
treatment should be sought as early as possible. 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML) has been reported with Jakavi treatment. 
Physicians should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that patients may not notice 
(e.g., cognitive, neurological or psychiatric symptoms or signs). Patients should be monitored for any 
of these new or worsening symptoms or signs, and if such symptoms/signs occur, referral to a 
neurologist and appropriate diagnostic measures for PML should be considered. If PML is suspected, 
further dosing must be suspended until PML has been excluded. 
Non-melanoma skin cancer 
Non-melanoma skin cancers (NMSCs), including basal cell, squamous cell, and Merkel cell 
carcinoma, have been reported in patients treated with ruxolitinib. Most of the MF and PV patients had 
histories of extended treatment with hydroxyurea and prior NMSC or pre-malignant skin lesions. A 
causal relationship to ruxolitinib has not been established. Periodic skin examination is recommended 
for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer.

Lipid abnormalities/elevations 
Treatment with Jakavi has been associated with increases in lipid parameters including total 
cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, 
and triglycerides. Lipid monitoring and treatment of dyslipidaemia according to clinical guidelines is 
recommended. 
Special populations 
Renal impairment 
The starting dose of Jakavi should be reduced in patients with severe renal impairment. For patients 
with end-stage renal disease on haemodialysis the starting dose should be based on platelet counts for 
MF patients, while the recommended starting dose is a single dose of 10 mg for PV patients (see 
section 4.2). Subsequent doses (single dose of 20 mg or two doses of 10 mg given 12 hours apart in 
MF patients; single dose of 10 mg or two doses of 5 mg given 12 hours apart in PV patients) should be 
administered only on haemodialysis days following each dialysis session. Additional dose 
modifications should be made with careful monitoring of safety and efficacy (see sections 4.2 and 
5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
The starting dose of Jakavi should be reduced by approximately 50% in MF and PV patients with 
hepatic impairment. Further dose modifications should be based on the safety and efficacy of the 
medicinal product. In GvHD patients with hepatic impairment not related to GvHD, the starting dose 
of Jakavi should be reduced by approximately 50% (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Interactions 
If Jakavi is to be co-administered with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or dual inhibitors of CYP3A4 and 
CYP2C9 enzymes (e.g. fluconazole), the unit dose of Jakavi should be reduced by approximately 
50%, to be administered twice daily (for monitoring frequency see sections 4.2 and 4.5). 
The concomitant use of cytoreductive therapies with Jakavi was associated with manageable 
cytopenias (see section 4.2 for dose modifications during cytopenias). 
Withdrawal effects 
Following interruption or discontinuation of Jakavi, symptoms of MF may return over a period of 
approximately one week. There have been cases of patients discontinuing Jakavi who experienced 
severe adverse events, particularly in the presence of acute intercurrent illness. It has not been 
established whether abrupt discontinuation of Jakavi contributed to these events. Unless abrupt 
discontinuation is required, gradual tapering of the dose of Jakavi may be considered, although the 
utility of the tapering is unproven. 
Excipients 
Jakavi contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, total lactase 
deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal product. 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per tablet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’.

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
Ruxolitinib is eliminated through metabolism catalysed by CYP3A4 and CYP2C9. Thus, medicinal 
products inhibiting these enzymes can give rise to increased ruxolitinib exposure. 
Interactions resulting in dose reduction of ruxolitinib 
CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as, but not limited to, boceprevir, clarithromycin, indinavir, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, lopinavir/ritonavir, ritonavir, mibefradil, nefazodone, nelfinavir, 
posaconazole, saquinavir, telaprevir, telithromycin, voriconazole) 
In healthy subjects co-administration of ruxolitinib (10 mg single dose) with a strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor, ketoconazole, resulted in ruxolitinib Cmax and AUC that were higher by 33% and 91%, 
respectively, than with ruxolitinib alone. The half-life was prolonged from 3.7 to 6.0 hours with 
concurrent ketoconazole administration. 
When administering ruxolitinib with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors the unit dose of ruxolitinib should be 
reduced by approximately 50%, to be administered twice daily. 
Patients should be closely monitored (e.g. twice weekly) for cytopenias and dose titrated based on 
safety and efficacy (see section 4.2). 
Dual CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In healthy subjects co-administration of ruxolitinib (10 mg single dose) with a dual CYP2C9 and 
CYP3A4 inhibitor, fluconazole, resulted in ruxolitinib Cmax and AUC that were higher by 47% and 
232%, respectively, than with ruxolitinib alone. 
50% dose reduction should be considered when using medicinal products which are dual inhibitors of 
CYP2C9 and CYP3A4 enzymes (e.g. fluconazole). Avoid the concomitant use of ruxolitinib with 
fluconazole doses greater than 200 mg daily. 
Enzyme inducers 
CYP3A4 inducers (such as, but not limited to, avasimibe, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, phenytoin, 
rifabutin, rifampin (rifampicin), St.John’s wort (Hypericum perforatum)) 
Patients should be closely monitored and the dose titrated based on safety and efficacy (see 
section 4.2). 
In healthy subjects given ruxolitinib (50 mg single dose) following the potent CYP3A4 inducer 
rifampicin (600 mg daily dose for 10 days), ruxolitinib AUC was 70% lower than after administration 
of ruxolitinib alone. The exposure of ruxolitinib active metabolites was unchanged. Overall, the 
ruxolitinib pharmacodynamic activity was similar, suggesting the CYP3A4 induction resulted in 
minimal effect on the pharmacodynamics. However, this could be related to the high ruxolitinib dose 
resulting in pharmacodynamic effects near Emax. It is possible that in the individual patient, an increase 
of the ruxolitinib dose is needed when initiating treatment with a strong enzyme inducer. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Other interactions to be considered affecting ruxolitinib 
Mild or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (such as, but not limited to, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, 
amprenavir, atazanavir, diltiazem, cimetidine) 
In healthy subjects co-administration of ruxolitinib (10 mg single dose) with erythromycin 500 mg 
twice daily for four days resulted in ruxolitinib Cmax and AUC that were higher by 8% and 27%, 
respectively, than with ruxolitinib alone. 
No dose adjustment is recommended when ruxolitinib is co-administered with mild or moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. erythromycin). However, patients should be closely monitored for cytopenias 
when initiating therapy with a moderate CYP3A4 inhibitor. 
Effects of ruxolitinib on other medicinal products 
Substances transported by P-glycoprotein or other transporters 
Ruxolitinib may inhibit P-glycoprotein and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) in the intestine. 
This may result in increased sytemic exposure of substrates of these transporters, such as dabigatran 
etexilate, ciclosporin, rosuvastatin and potentially digoxin. Therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) or 
clinical monitoring of the affected substance is advised. 
It is possible that the potential inhibition of P-gp and BCRP in the intestine can be minimised if the 
time between administrations is kept apart as long as possible. 
A study in healthy subjects indicated that ruxolitinib did not inhibit the metabolism of the oral 
CYP3A4 substrate midazolam. Therefore, no increase in exposure of CYP3A4 substrates is 
anticipated when combining them with ruxolitinib. Another study in healthy subjects indicated that 
ruxolitinib does not affect the pharmacokinetics of an oral contraceptive containing ethinylestradiol 
and levonorgestrel. Therefore, it is not anticipated that the contraceptive efficacy of this combination 
will be compromised by co-administration of ruxolitinib. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of Jakavi in pregnant women. 
Animal studies have shown that ruxolitinib is embryotoxic and foetotoxic. Teratogenicity was not 
observed in rats or rabbits. However, the exposure margins compared to the highest clinical dose were 
low and the results are therefore of limited relevance for humans (see section 5.3). The potential risk 
for humans is unknown. As a precautionary measure, the use of Jakavi during pregnancy is 
contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
Women of childbearing potential/Contraception 
Women of child-bearing potential should use effective contraception during the treatment with Jakavi. 
In case pregnancy should occur during treatment with Jakavi, a risk/benefit evaluation must be carried 
out on an individual basis with careful counselling regarding potential risks to the foetus (see 
section 5.3). 
Breast-feeding 
Jakavi must not be used during breast-feeding (see section 4.3) and breast-feeding should therefore be 
discontinued when treatment is started. It is unknown whether ruxolitinib and/or its metabolites are 
excreted in human milk. A risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. Available 
pharmacodynamic/toxicological data in animals have shown excretion of ruxolitinib and its 
metabolites in milk (see section 5.3).

Fertility 
There are no human data on the effect of ruxolitinib on fertility. In animal studies, no effect on fertility 
was observed. 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
Jakavi has no or negligible sedating effect. However, patients who experience dizziness after the 
intake of Jakavi should refrain from driving or using machines. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Myelofibrosis 
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were thrombocytopenia and anaemia. 
Haematological adverse drug reactions (any Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events 
[CTCAE] grade) included anaemia (83.8%), thrombocytopenia (80.5%) and neutropenia (20.8%). 
Anaemia, thrombocytopenia and neutropenia are dose-related effects. 
The three most frequent non-haematological adverse drug reactions were bruising (33.3%), other 
bleeding (including epistaxis, post-procedural haemorrhage and haematuria) (24.3%) and dizziness 
(21.9%). 
The three most frequent non-haematological laboratory abnormalities identified as adverse reactions 
were increased alanine aminotransferase (40.7%), increased aspartate aminotransferase (31.5%) and 
hypertriglyceridaemia (25.2%). In phase 3 clinical studies in MF, neither CTCAE grade 3 or 4 
hypertriglyceridaemia or increased aspartate aminotransferase, nor CTCAE grade 4 increased alanine 
aminotransferase or hypercholesterolaemia were observed. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events, regardless of causality, was observed in 30.0% of patients. 
Polycythaemia vera 
The most frequently reported adverse drug reactions were anaemia and increased alanine

Tabulated list of adverse drug reactions from clinical studies 
The safety of Jakavi in MF patients was evaluated using the long-term follow-up data from two 
phase 3 studies (COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II) including data from patients initially randomised to 
ruxolitinib (n=301) and patients who received ruxolitinib after crossing over from control treatments 
(n=156). The median exposure upon which the adverse drug reaction frequency categories for MF 
patients are based was 30.5 months (range 0.3 to 68.1 months). 
The safety of Jakavi in PV patients was evaluated using the long-term follow-up data from two 
phase 3 studies (RESPONSE, RESPONSE 2) including data from patients initially randomised to 
ruxolitinib (n=184) and patients who received ruxolitinib after crossing over from control treatments 
(n=156). The median exposure upon which the adverse drug reaction frequency categories for PV 
patients are based was 41.7 months (range 0.03 to 59.7 months). 
The safety of Jakavi in acute GvHD patients was evaluated in the phase 3 study REACH2, including 
data from patients initially randomised to Jakavi (n=152) and patients who received Jakavi after 
crossing over from the best available therapy (BAT) arm (n=49). The median exposure upon which the 
adverse drug reaction frequency categories were based was 8.9 weeks (range 0.3 to 66.1 weeks).

The safety of Jakavi in chronic GvHD patients was evaluated in the phase 3 study REACH3, including 
data from patients initially randomised to Jakavi (n=165) and patients who received Jakavi after 
crossing over from BAT (n=61). The median exposure upon which the adverse drug reaction 
frequency categories were based was 41.4 weeks (range 0.7 to 127.3 weeks). 
In the clinical study programme the severity of adverse drug reactions was assessed based on the 
CTCAE, defining grade 1=mild, grade 2=moderate, grade 3=severe, grade 4=life-threatening or 
disabling, grade 5=death. 
Adverse drug reactions from clinical studies in MF and PV (Table 4) and in acute and chronic GvHD 
(Table 5) are listed by MedDRA system organ class. Within each system organ class, the adverse drug 
reactions are ranked by frequency, with the most frequent reactions first. In addition, the 
corresponding frequency category for each adverse drug reaction is based on the following 
convention: very common (≥1/10); common (≥1/100 to <1/10); uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100); rare 
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000); very rare (<1/10,000); not known (cannot be estimated from the available 
data).

Description of selected adverse drug reactions 
Anaemia 
In phase 3 clinical studies in MF, median time to onset of first CTCAE grade 2 or higher anaemia was 
1.5 months. One patient (0.3%) discontinued treatment because of anaemia. 
In patients receiving ruxolitinib mean decreases in haemoglobin reached a nadir of approximately 
10 g/litre below baseline after 8 to 12 weeks of therapy and then gradually recovered to reach a new 
steady state that was approximately 5 g/litre below baseline. This pattern was observed in patients 
regardless of whether they had received transfusion during therapy. 
In the randomised, placebo-controlled study COMFORT-I 60.6% of Jakavi-treated MF patients and 
37.7% of placebo-treated MF patients received red blood cell transfusions during randomised 
treatment. In the COMFORT-II study the rate of packed red blood cell transfusions was 53.4% in the 
Jakavi arm and 41.1% in the best available therapy arm. 
In the randomised period of the pivotal studies, anaemia was less frequent in PV patients than in MF 
patients (40.8% versus 82.4%). In the PV population, the CTCAE grade 3 and 4 events were reported 
in 2.7%, while in the MF patients the frequency was 42.56%. 
In the phase 3 acute and chronic GvHD studies, anaemia CTCAE grade 3 was reported in 47.7% and 
14.8% of patients, respectively. 
17 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Thrombocytopenia 
In the phase 3 clinical studies in MF, in patients who developed grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia, the 
median time to onset was approximately 8 weeks. Thrombocytopenia was generally reversible with 
dose reduction or dose interruption. The median time to recovery of platelet counts above 50,000/mm3 
was 14 days. During the randomised period, platelet transfusions were administered to 4.7% of 
patients receiving ruxolitinib and to 4.0% of patients receiving control regimens. Discontinuation of 
treatment because of thrombocytopenia occurred in 0.7% of patients receiving ruxolitinib and 0.9% of 
patients receiving control regimens. Patients with a platelet count of 100,000/mm3 to 200,000/mm3 
before starting ruxolitinib had a higher frequency of grade 3 or 4 thrombocytopenia compared to 
patients with platelet count >200,000/mm3 (64.2% versus 38.5%). 
In the randomised period of the pivotal studies, the rate of patients experiencing thrombocytopenia 
was lower in PV (16.8%) patients compared to MF (69.8%) patients. The frequency of severe (i.e. 
CTCAE grade 3 and 4) thrombocytopenia was lower in PV (2.7%) than in MF (11.6%) patients. 
In the phase 3 acute GvHD study, grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was observed in 31.3% and 47.7% 
of patients, respectively. In the phase 3 chronic GvHD study, grade 3 and 4 thrombocytopenia was 
lower (5.9% and 10.7%) than in acute GvHD. 
Neutropenia 
In the phase 3 clinical studies in MF, in patients who developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, the median 
time to onset was 12 weeks. During the randomised period, dose holding or reductions due to 
neutropenia were reported in 1.0% of patients, and 0.3% of patients discontinued treatment because of 
neutropenia. 
In the randomised period of the phase 3 studies in PV patients, neutropenia was reported in 1.6% of 
patients exposed to ruxolitinib compared to 7% in reference treatments. In the ruxolitinib arm one 
patient developed CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia. An extended follow-up of patients treated with 
ruxolitinib showed 2 patients reporting CTCAE grade 4 neutropenia. 
In the phase 3 acute GvHD study, grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was observed in 17.9% and 20.6% of 
patients, respectively. In the phase 3 chronic GvHD study grade 3 and 4 neutropenia was lower (9.5% 
and 6.7%) than in acute GvHD. 
Bleeding 
In the phase 3 pivotal studies in MF bleeding events (including intracranial and gastrointestinal, 
bruising and other bleeding events) were reported in 32.6% of patients exposed to ruxolitinib and 
23.2% of patients exposed to the reference treatments (placebo or best available therapy). The 
frequency of grade 3-4 events was similar for patients treated with ruxolitinib or reference treatments 
(4.7% versus 3.1%). Most of the patients with bleeding events during the treatment reported bruising 
(65.3%). Bruising events were more frequently reported in patients taking ruxolitinib compared with 
the reference treatments (21.3% versus 11.6%). Intracranial bleeding was reported in 1% of patients 
exposed to ruxolitinib and 0.9% exposed to reference treatments. Gastrointestinal bleeding was 
reported in 5.0% of patients exposed to ruxolitinib compared to 3.1% exposed to reference treatments. 
Other bleeding events (including events such as epistaxis, post-procedural haemorrhage and 
haematuria) were reported in 13.3% of patients treated with ruxolitinib and 10.3% treated with 
reference treatments. 
During the long-term follow-up of phase 3 clinical studies in MF, the cumulative frequency of 
bleeding events increased proportionally to the increase in the follow-up time. Bruising events were 
the most frequently reported bleeding events (33.3%). Intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeding events 
were reported in 1.3% and 10.1% of patients respectively. 
18 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the comparative period of phase 3 studies in PV patients, bleeding events (including intracranial and 
gastrointestinal, bruising and other bleeding events) were reported in 16.8% of patients treated with 
ruxolitinib, 15.3% of patients receiving best available therapy in RESPONSE study and 12.0% of 
patients receiving best available therapy in RESPONSE 2 study. Bruising was reported in 10.3% of 
patients treated with ruxolitinib, 8.1% of patients receiving best available therapy in RESPONSE 
study and 2.7% of patients receiving best available therapy in RESPONSE 2 study. No intracranial 
bleeding or gastrointestinal haemorrhage events were reported in patients receiving ruxolitinib. One 
patient treated with ruxolitinib experienced a grade 3 bleeding event (post-procedural bleeding); no 
grade 4 bleeding was reported. Other bleeding events (including events such as epistaxis, 
post-procedural haemorrhage, gingival bleeding) were reported in 8.7% of patients treated with 
ruxolitinib, 6.3% of patients treated with best available therapy in RESPONSE study and 6.7% of 
patients treated with best available therapy in RESPONSE 2 study. 
During the long-term follow-up of phase 3 studies in PV, the cumulative frequency of bleeding events 
increased proportionally to the increase in the follow-up time. Bruising events were the most 
frequently reported bleeding events (17.4%). Intracranial and gastrointestinal bleeding events were 
reported in 0.3% and 3.5% of patients respectively. 
In the comparative period of the phase 3 acute GvHD study, bleeding events were reported in 25.0% 
and 22.0% of patients in the ruxolitinib and BAT arms respectively. The sub-groups of bleeding 
events were generally similar between treatment arms: bruising events (5.9% in ruxolitinib vs. 6.7% in 
BAT arm), gastrointestinal events (9.2% vs. 6.7%) and other haemorrhage events (13.2% vs. 10.7%). 
Intracranial bleeding events were reported in 0.7% of patients in the BAT arm and in no patients in the 
ruxolitinib arm. 
In the comparative period of the phase 3 chronic GvHD study, bleeding events were reported in 11.5% 
and 14.6% of patients in the ruxolitinib and BAT arms respectively. The sub-groups of bleeding 
events were generally similar between treatment arms: bruising events (4.2% in ruxolitinib vs. 2.5% in 
BAT arm), gastrointestinal events (1.2% vs. 3.2%) and other haemorrhage events (6.7% vs. 10.1%). 
No intracranial bleeding events were reported in either treatment arm. 
Infections 
In the phase 3 pivotal studies in MF, grade 3 or 4 urinary tract infection was reported in 1.0% of 
patients, herpes zoster in 4.3% and tuberculosis in 1.0%. In phase 3 clinical studies sepsis was reported 
in 3.0% of patients. An extended follow-up of patients treated with ruxolitinib showed no trends 
towards an increase in the rate of sepsis over time. 
In the randomised period of the phase 3 studies in PV patients, one (0.5%) CTCAE grade 3 and no 
grade 4 urinary tract infection was reported. The rate of herpes zoster was similar in PV (4.3%) 
patients and MF (4.0%) patients. There was one report of CTCAE grade 3 post-herpetic neuralgia 
amongst the PV patients. Pneumonia was reported in 0.5% of patients treated with ruxolitinib 
compared to 1.6% of patients in reference treatments. No patients in the ruxolitinib arm reported 
sepsis or tuberculosis. 
During long-term follow-up of phase 3 studies in PV, frequently reported infections were urinary tract 
infections (11.8%), herpes zoster (14.7%) and pneumonia (7.1%). Sepsis was reported in 0.6% of 
patients. No patients reported tuberculosis in long-term follow-up. 
19 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In the phase 3 acute GvHD study, during the comparative period, urinary tract infections were 
reported in 9.9% (grade ≥3, 3.3%) of patients in the ruxolitinib arm compared to 10.7% (grade ≥3, 
6.0%) in the BAT arm. CMV infections were reported in 28.3% (grade ≥3, 9.3%) of patients in the 
ruxolitinib arm compared to 24.0% (grade ≥3, 10.0%) in the BAT arm. Sepsis events were reported in 
12.5% (grade ≥3, 11.1%) of patients in the ruxolitinib arm compared to 8.7% (grade ≥3, 6.0%) in the 
BAT arm. BK virus infection was reported only in the ruxolitinib arm in 3 patients with one grade 3 
event. During extended follow-up of patients treated with ruxolitinib, urinary tract infections were 
reported in 17.9% (grade ≥3, 6.5%) of patients and CMV infections were reported in 32.3% (grade ≥3, 
11.4%) of patients. CMV infection with organ involvement was seen in very few patients; CMV 
colitis, CMV enteritis and CMV gastrointestinal infection of any grade were reported in four, two and 
one patients, respectively. Sepsis events, including septic shock, of any grade were reported in 25.4% 
(grade ≥3, 21.9%) of patients. 
In the phase 3 chronic GvHD study, during the comparative period, urinary tract infections were 
reported in 8.5% (grade ≥3, 1.2%) of patients in the ruxolitinib arm compared to 6.3% (grade ≥3, 
1.3%) in the BAT arm. BK virus infection was reported in 5.5% (grade ≥3, 0.6%) of patients in the 
ruxolitinib arm compared to 1.3% in the BAT arm. CMV infections were reported in 9.1% (grade ≥3, 
1.8%) of patients in the ruxolitinib arm compared to 10.8% (grade ≥3, 1.9%) in the BAT arm. Sepsis 
events were reported in 2.4% (grade ≥3, 2.4%) of patients in the ruxolitinib arm compared to 6.3% 
(grade ≥3, 5.7%) in the BAT arm. During extended follow-up of patients treated with ruxolitinib, 
urinary tract infections and BK virus infections were reported in 9.3% (grade ≥3, 1.3%) and 4.9% 
(grade ≥3, 0.4%) of patients, respectively. CMV infections and sepsis events were reported in 8.8% 
(grade ≥3, 1.3%) and 3.5% (grade ≥3, 3.5%) of patients, respectively. 
Elevated lipase 
In the randomised period of the RESPONSE study, the worsening of lipase values was higher in the 
ruxolitinib arm compared to the control arm, mainly due to the differences among grade 1 elevations 
(18.2% vs 8.1%). Grade ≥2 elevations were similar between treatment arms. In RESPONSE 2, the 
frequencies were comparable between the ruxolitinib and the control arm (10.8% vs 8%). During long-
term follow-up of phase 3 PV studies, 7.4% and 0.9% of patients reported grade 3 and grade 4 
elevation of lipase values. No concurrent signs and symptoms of pancreatitis with elevated lipase 
values were reported in these patients. 
In phase 3 studies in MF, high lipase values were reported in 18.7% and 19.3% of patients in the 
ruxolitinib arms compared to 16.6% and 14.0% in the control arms in COMFORT-I and 
COMFORT-II studies, respectively. In patients with elevated lipase values, no concurrent signs and 
symptoms of pancreatitis were reported. 
In the comparative period of the phase 3 acute GvHD study, new or worsened lipase values were 
reported in 19.7% of patients in the ruxolitinib arm compared to 12.5% in the BAT arm; 
corresponding grade 3 (3.1% vs 5.1%) and grade 4 (0% vs 0.8%) increases were similar. During 
extended follow-up of patients treated with ruxolitinib, increased lipase values were reported in 32.2% 
of patients; grade 3 and 4 were reported in 8.7% and 2.2% of patients respectively. 
In the comparative period of the phase 3 chronic GvHD study, new or worsened lipase values were 
reported in 32.1% of patients in the ruxolitinib arm compared to 23.5% in the BAT arm; 
corresponding grade 3 (10.6% vs 6.2%) and grade 4 (0.6% vs 0%) increases were similar. During 
extended follow-up of patients treated with ruxolitinib, increased lipase values were reported in 35.9% 
of patients; grade 3 and 4 were observed in 9.5% and 0.4% of patients, respectively.

Increased systolic blood pressure 
In the phase 3 pivotal clinical studies in MF an increase in systolic blood pressure of 20 mmHg or 
more from baseline was recorded in 31.5% of patients on at least one visit compared with 19.5% of the 
control-treated patients. In COMFORT-I (MF patients) the mean increase from baseline in systolic BP 
was 0-2 mmHg on ruxolitinib versus a decrease of 2-5 mmHg in the placebo arm. In COMFORT-II 
mean values showed little difference between the ruxolitinib-treated and the control-treated MF 
patients. 
In the randomised period of the pivotal study in PV patients, the mean systolic blood pressure 
increased by 0.65 mmHg in the ruxolitinib arm versus a decrease of 2 mmHg in the BAT arm. 
Paediatric patients 
A total of 20 patients aged 12 to <18 years with GvHD were analysed for safety: 9 patients (5 in the 
ruxolitinib arm and 4 in the BAT arm) in the study REACH2 and 11 patients (4 in the ruxolitinib arm 
and 7 in the BAT arm) in the study REACH3. Based on the similar exposure observed in adolescents 
and adults, the safety of ruxolitinib at the recommended dose of 10 mg twice daily is similar in 
frequency and severity. 
Elderly 
A total of 29 patients in study REACH2 and 25 patients in REACH3 aged >65 years and treated with 
ruxolitinib were analysed for safety. Overall, no new safety concerns were identified and the safety 
profile in patients >65 years old is generally consistent with that of patients aged 18-65 years old. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no known antidote for overdoses with Jakavi. Single doses up to 200 mg have been given 
with acceptable acute tolerability. Higher than recommended repeat doses are associated with 
increased myelosuppression including leukopenia, anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Appropriate 
supportive treatment should be given. 
Haemodialysis is not expected to enhance the elimination of ruxolitinib.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Antineoplastic agents, protein kinase inhibitors, ATC code: L01EJ01 
Mechanism of action 
Ruxolitinib is a selective inhibitor of the Janus Associated Kinases (JAKs) JAK1 and JAK2 (IC50 
values of 3.3 nM and 2.8 nM for JAK1 and JAK2 enzymes, respectively). These mediate the 
signalling of a number of cytokines and growth factors that are important for haematopoiesis and 
immune function. 
MF and PV are myeloproliferative neoplasms known to be associated with dysregulated JAK1 and 
JAK2 signalling. The basis for the dysregulation is believed to include high levels of circulating 
cytokines that activate the JAK-STAT pathway, gain-of-function mutations such as JAK2V617F, and 
silencing of negative regulatory mechanisms. MF patients exhibit dysregulated JAK signalling 
regardless of JAK2V617F mutation status. Activating mutations in JAK2 (V617F or exon 12) are 
found in >95% of PV patients. 
Ruxolitinib inhibits JAK-STAT signalling and cell proliferation of cytokine-dependent cellular models 
of haematological malignancies, as well as of Ba/F3 cells rendered cytokine-independent by 
expressing the JAK2V617F mutated protein, with IC50 ranging from 80-320 nM. 
JAK-STAT signalling pathways play a role in regulating the development, proliferation, and activation 
of several immune cell types important for GvHD pathogenesis. 
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Ruxolitinib inhibits cytokine-induced STAT3 phosphorylation in whole blood from healthy subjects, 
MF patients and PV patients. Ruxolitinib resulted in maximal inhibition of STAT3 phosphorylation 
2 hours after dosing which returned to near baseline by 8 hours in both healthy subjects and MF 
patients, indicating no accumulation of either parent or active metabolites. 
Baseline elevations in inflammatory markers associated with constitutional symptoms such as TNFα, 
IL-6 and CRP in subjects with MF were decreased following treatment with ruxolitinib. MF patients 
did not become refractory to the pharmacodynamic effects of ruxolitinib treatment over time. 
Similarly, patients with PV also presented with baseline elevations in inflammatory markers and these 
markers were decreased following treatment with ruxolitinib. 
In a thorough QT study in healthy subjects, there was no indication of a QT/QTc prolonging effect of 
ruxolitinib in single doses up to a supratherapeutic dose of 200 mg, indicating that ruxolitinib has no 
effect on cardiac repolarisation.

Clinical efficacy and safety 
Myelofibrosis 
Two randomised phase 3 studies (COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II) were conducted in patients with 
MF (primary MF, post-polycythaemia vera MF or post-essential thrombocythaemia MF). In both 
studies, patients had palpable splenomegaly at least 5 cm below the costal margin and risk category of 
intermediate-2 or high risk based on the International Working Group (IWG) Consensus Criteria. The 
starting dose of Jakavi was based on platelet count. Patients with platelet counts ≤100,000/mm3 were 
not eligible for enrolment in COMFORT studies but 69 patients were enrolled in the EXPAND study, 
a Phase Ib, open label, dose-finding study in patients with MF (primary MF, post-polycythaemia vera 
MF or post-essential thrombocythaemia MF) and baseline platelet counts ≥50,000 and <100,000/mm3. 
COMFORT-I was a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled study in 309 patients who were 
refractory to or were not candidates for available therapy. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
proportion of subjects achieving ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume at week 24 as 
measured by Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or Computed Tomography (CT). 
Secondary endpoints included duration of maintenance of a ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen 
volume, proportion of patients who had ≥50% reduction in total symptom score, changes in total 
symptom scores from baseline to week 24, as measured by the modified MF Symptom Assessment 
Form (MFSAF) v2.0 diary, and overall survival. 
COMFORT-II was an open-label, randomised study in 219 patients. Patients were randomised 2:1 to 
ruxolitinib versus best available therapy. In the best available therapy arm, 47% of patients received 
hydroxyurea and 16% of patients received glucocorticoids. The primary efficacy endpoint was 
proportion of patients achieving ≥35% reduction from baseline in spleen volume at week 48 as 
measured by MRI or CT. 
Secondary endpoints included proportion of patients achieving a ≥35% reduction of spleen volume 
from baseline at week 24 and duration of maintenance of a ≥35% reduction from baseline spleen 
volume. 
In COMFORT-I and COMFORT-II, patient baseline demographics and disease characteristics were 
comparable between the treatment arms.

The probability of maintaining spleen response (≥35% reduction) to Jakavi for at least 24 weeks was 
89% in COMFORT-I and 87% in COMFORT-II; 52% maintained spleen responses for at least 
48 weeks in COMFORT-II. 
In COMFORT-I, 45.9% subjects in the Jakavi group achieved a ≥50% improvement from baseline in 
the week 24 total symptom score (measured using MFSAF diary v2.0), as compared to 5.3% in the 
placebo group (p<0.0001 using chi-square test). The mean change in the global health status at 
week 24, as measured by EORTC QLQ C30 was +12.3 for Jakavi and -3.4 for placebo (p<0.0001). 
In COMFORT-I, after a median follow-up of 34.3 months, the death rate in patients randomised to the 
ruxolitinib arm was 27.1% versus 35.1% in patients randomised to placebo; HR 0.687; 95% CI 
0.459-1.029; p=0.0668. 
In COMFORT-I, after a median follow–up of 61.7 months, the death rate in patients randomised to the 
ruxolitinib arm was 44.5% (69 of 155 patients) versus 53.2% (82 of 154) in patients randomised to 
placebo. There was a 31% reduction in the risk of death in the ruxolitinib arm as compared to placebo 
(HR 0.69; 95% CI 0.50-0.96; p=0.025). 
In COMFORT-II, after a median follow-up of 34.7 months, the death rate in patients randomised to 
ruxolitinib was 19.9% versus 30.1% in patients randomised to best available treatment (BAT); HR 
0.48; 95% CI 0.28-0.85; p=0.009. In both studies, the lower death rates noted in the ruxolitinib arm 
were predominantly driven by the results obtained in the post polycythaemia vera and post essential 
thrombocythaemia subgroups. 
In COMFORT-II, after a median follow-up of 55.9 months, the death rate in patients randomised to 
the ruxolitinib arm was 40.4% (59 of 146 patients) versus 47.9% (35 of 73 patients) in patients 
randomized to best available therapy (BAT). There was a 33% reduction in risk of death in the 
ruxolitinib arm compared to the BAT arm (HR 0.67; 95% CI 0.44-1.02; p=0.062).

Polycythaemia vera 
A randomised, open-label, active-controlled phase 3 study (RESPONSE) was conducted in 
222 patients with PV who were resistant to or intolerant of hydroxyurea defined based on the 
European LeukemiaNet (ELN) international working group published criteria. 110 patients were 
randomised to the ruxolitinib arm and 112 patients to the BAT arm. The starting dose of Jakavi was 
10 mg twice daily. Doses were then adjusted in individual patients based on tolerability and efficacy 
with a maximum dose of 25 mg twice daily. BAT was selected by the investigator on a patient-by-
patient basis and included hydroxyurea (59.5%), interferon/pegylated interferon (11.7%), anagrelide 
(7.2%), pipobroman (1.8%) and observation (15.3%). 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were comparable between the two treatments arms. 
The median age was 60 years (range 33 to 90 years). Patients in the ruxolitinib arm had PV diagnosis 
for a median of 8.2 years and had previously received hydroxyurea for a median of approximately 
3 years. Most patients (>80%) had received at least two phlebotomies in the last 24 weeks prior to 
screening. Comparative data regarding long-term survival and incidence of disease complications is 
missing. 
The primary composite endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving both an absence of 
phlebotomy eligibility (HCT control) and a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume from baseline at 
week 32. Phlebotomy eligibility was defined as a confirmed HCT of >45%, i.e. at least 3 percentage 
points higher than the HCT obtained at baseline or a confirmed HCT of >48%, depending on which 
was lower. Key secondary endpoints included the proportion of patients who achieved the primary 
endpoint and remained free from progression at week 48, as well as the proportion of patients 
achieving complete haematological remission at week 32. 
The study met its primary objective and a higher proportion of patients in the Jakavi group achieved 
the primary composite endpoint and each of its individual components. Significantly more patients 
treated with Jakavi (23%) achieved a primary response (p<0.0001) compared to BAT (0.9%). 
Haematocrit control was achieved in 60% of patients in the Jakavi arm compared to 18.8% in the BAT 
arm and a ≥35% reduction in spleen volume was achieved in 40% of patients in the Jakavi arm 
compared to 0.9% in the BAT arm (Figure 1). 
Both key secondary endpoints were also met. The proportion of patients achieving a complete 
haematological remission was 23.6% on Jakavi compared to 8.0% on BAT (p=0.0013) and the 
proportion of patients achieving a durable primary response at week 48 was 20% on Jakavi and 0.9% 
on BAT (p<0.0001).

Symptom burden was assessed using the MPN-SAF total symptom score (TSS) electronic patient 
diary, which consisted of 14 questions. At week 32, 49% and 64% of patients treated with ruxolitinib 
achieved a ≥50% reduction in TSS-14 and TSS-5, respectively, compared to only 5% and 11% of 
patients on BAT. 
Treatment benefit perception was measured by the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) 
questionnaire. 66% of patients treated with ruxolitinib compared to 19% treated with BAT reported an 
improvement as early as four weeks after beginning treatment. Improvement in perception of 
treatment benefit was also higher in patients treated with ruxolitinib at week 32 (78% versus 33%). 
Additional analyses from the RESPONSE study to assess durability of response were conducted at 
week 80 and week 256 following randomisation. Out of 25 patients who had achieved primary 
response at week 32, 3 patients had progressed by week 80 and 6 patients by week 256. The 
probability to have maintained a response from week 32 up to week 80 and week 256 was 92% and 
74%, respectively (see Table 8).

A second randomised, open label, active-controlled phase 3b study (RESPONSE 2) was conducted in 
149 PV patients who were resistant to, or intolerant of, hydroxyurea but without palpable 
splenomegaly. The primary endpoint defined as the proportion of patients achieving HCT control 
(absence of phlebotomy eligibility) at week 28 was met (62.2% in the Jakavi arm versus 18.7% in the 
BAT arm). The key secondary endpoint defined as the proportion of patients achieving complete 
haematological remission at week 28 was also met (23.0% in the Jakavi arm versus 5.3% in the BAT 
arm).

Graft-versus-host disease 
Two randomised phase 3, open-label, multi-centre studies investigated Jakavi in patients 12 years of 
age and older with acute GvHD (REACH2) and chronic GvHD (REACH3) after allogeneic 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (alloSCT) and insufficient response to corticosteroids and/or 
other systemic therapies. The starting dose of Jakavi was 10 mg twice daily. 
Acute graft-versus-host disease 
In REACH2, 309 patients with grade II to IV corticosteroid-refractory, acute GvHD were randomised 
1:1 to Jakavi or BAT. Patients were stratified by severity of acute GvHD at the time of randomisation. 
Corticosteroid refractoriness was determined when patients had progression after at least 3 days, failed 
to achieve a response after 7 days or failed corticosteroid taper. 
BAT was selected by the investigator on a patient-by-patient basis and included anti-thymocyte 
globulin (ATG), extracorporeal photopheresis (ECP), mesenchymal stromal cells (MSC), low dose 
methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mTOR inhibitors (everolimus or sirolimus), 
etanercept, or infliximab. 
In addition to Jakavi or BAT, patients could have received standard allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation supportive care including anti-infective medicinal products and transfusion support. 
Ruxolitinib was added to continued use of corticosteroids and/or calcineurin inhibitors (CNIs) such as 
cyclosporine or tacrolimus and/or topical or inhaled corticosteroid therapies per institutional 
guidelines. 
Patients who received one prior systemic treatment other than corticosteroids and CNI for acute GvHD 
were eligible for inclusion in the study. In addition to corticosteroids and CNI, prior systemic 
medicinal product for acute GvHD was allowed to continue only if used for acute GvHD prophylaxis 
(i.e. started before the acute GvHD diagnosis) as per common medical practice. 
Patients on BAT could cross over to ruxolitinib after day 28 if they met the following criteria: 
• 
Failed to meet the primary endpoint response definition (complete response [CR] or partial 
response [PR]) at day 28; OR 
Lost the response thereafter and met criteria for progression, mixed response, or no response, 
necessitating new additional systemic immunosuppressive treatment for acute GvHD, AND 
Did not have signs/symptoms of chronic GvHD. 
• 
• 
Tapering of Jakavi was allowed after the day 56 visit for patients with treatment response. 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms. The 
median age was 54 years (range 12 to 73 years). The study included 2.9% adolescent, 59.2% male and 
68.9% white patients. The majority of enrolled patients had malignant underlying disease. 
The severity of acute GvHD was grade II in 34% and 34%, grade III in 46% and 47%, and grade IV in 
20% and 19% of the Jakavi and BAT arms, respectively. 
The reasons for patients’ insufficient response to corticosteroids in the Jakavi and BAT arms were i) 
failure in achieving a response after 7 days of corticosteroid treatment (46.8% and 40.6%, 
respectively), ii) failure of corticosteroid taper (30.5% and 31.6%, respectively) or iii) disease 
progression after 3 days of treatment (22.7% and 27.7%, respectively). 
Among all patients, the most common organs involved in acute GvHD were skin (54.0%) and lower 
gastrointestinal tract (68.3%). More patients in the Jakavi arm had acute GvHD involving skin 
(60.4%) and liver (23.4%), compared to the BAT arm (skin: 47.7% and liver: 16.1%). 
The most frequently used prior systemic acute GvHD therapies were corticosteroids+CNIs (49.4% in 
the Jakavi arm and 49.0% in the BAT arm). 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR) on day 28, defined as the proportion of 
patients in each arm with a complete response (CR) or a partial response (PR) without the requirement 
of additional systemic therapies for an earlier progression, mixed response or non-response based on 
investigator assessment following the criteria by Harris et al. (2016). 
The key secondary endpoint was the proportion of patients who achieved a CR or PR at day 28 and 
maintained a CR or PR at day 56. 
REACH2 met its primary objective. ORR at day 28 of treatment was higher in the Jakavi arm (62.3%) 
compared to the BAT arm (39.4%). There was a statistically significant difference between the 
treatment arms (stratified Cochrane-Mantel-Haenszel test p<0.0001, two-sided, OR: 2.64; 95% CI: 
1.65, 4.22). 
There was also a higher proportion of complete responders in the Jakavi arm (34.4%) compared to 
BAT arm (19.4%). 
Day-28 ORR was 76% for grade II GvHD, 56% for grade III GvHD, and 53% for grade IV GvHD in 
the Jakavi arm, and 51% for grade II GvHD, 38% for grade III GvHD, and 23% for grade IV GvHD in 
the BAT arm. 
Among the non-responders at day 28 in the Jakavi and BAT arms, 2.6% and 8.4% had disease 
progression, respectively. 
Overall results are presented in Table 9.

The study met its key secondary endpoint based on the primary data analysis (data cut-off date: 25-Jul-
2019). Durable ORR at day 56 was 39.6% (95% CI: 31.8, 47.8) in the Jakavi arm and 21.9% (95% CI: 
15.7, 29.3) in the BAT arm. There was a statistically significant difference between the two treatment 
arms (OR: 2.38; 95% CI: 1.43, 3.94; p=0.0007). The proportion of patients with a CR was 26.6% in 
the Jakavi arm versus 16.1% in the BAT arm. Overall, 49 patients (31.6%) originally randomised to 
the BAT arm crossed over to the Jakavi arm.

Chronic graft-versus-host disease 
In REACH3, 329 patients with moderate or severe corticosteroid-refractory, chronic GvHD were 
randomised 1:1 to Jakavi or BAT. Patients were stratified by severity of chronic GvHD at the time of 
randomisation. Corticosteroid refractoriness was determined when patients had lack of response or 
disease progression after 7 days, or had disease persistence for 4 weeks or failed corticosteroid taper 
twice. 
BAT was selected by the investigator on a patient-by-patient basis and included extracorporeal 
photopheresis (ECP), low dose methotrexate (MTX), mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), mTOR 
inhibitors (everolimus or sirolimus), infliximab, rituximab, pentostatin, imatinib, or ibrutinib. 
In addition to Jakavi or BAT, patients could have received standard allogeneic stem cell 
transplantation supportive care including anti-infective medicinal products and transfusion support. 
Continued use of corticosteroids and CNIs such as cyclosporine or tacrolimus and topical or inhaled 
corticosteroid therapies were allowed per institutional guidelines. 
Patients who received one prior systemic treatment other than corticosteroids and/or CNI for chronic 
GvHD were eligible for inclusion in the study. In addition to corticosteroids and CNI, prior systemic 
medicinal product for chronic GvHD was allowed to continue only if used for chronic GvHD 
prophylaxis (i.e. started before the chronic GvHD diagnosis) as per common medical practice. 
Patients on BAT could cross over to ruxolitinib on cycle 7 day 1 and thereafter due to disease 
progression, mixed response, or unchanged response, due to toxicity to BAT, or due to chronic GvHD 
flare. 
Efficacy in patients that transition from active acute GvHD to chronic GvHD without tapering off 
corticosteroids and any systemic treatment is unknown. Efficacy in acute or chronic GvHD after donor 
lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and in patients who did not tolerate steroid treatment is unknown. 
Tapering of Jakavi was allowed after the cycle 7 day 1 visit. 
Baseline demographics and disease characteristics were balanced between the two treatment arms. The 
median age was 49 years (range 12 to 76 years). The study included 3.6% adolescent, 61.1% male and 
75.4% white patients. The majority of enrolled patients had malignant underlying disease. 
The severity at diagnosis of corticosteroid-refractory chronic GvHD was balanced between the two 
treatment arms, with 41% and 45% moderate, and 59% and 55% severe, in the Jakavi and the BAT 
arms, respectively. 
Patients’ insufficient response to corticosteroids in the Jakavi and BAT arm were characterised by i) a 
lack of response or disease progression after corticosteroid treatment for at least 7 days at 1 mg/kg/day 
of prednisone equivalents (37.6% and 44.5%, respectively), ii) disease persistence after 4 weeks at 
0.5 mg/kg/day (35.2% and 25.6%), or iii) corticosteroid dependency (27.3% and 29.9%, respectively). 
Among all patients, 73% and 45% had skin and lung involvement in the Jakavi arm, compared to 69% 
and 41% in the BAT arm. 
The most frequently used prior systemic chronic GvHD therapies were corticosteroids only (43% in 
the Jakavi arm and 49% in the BAT arm) and corticosteroids+CNIs (41% patients in the Jakavi arm 
and 42% in the BAT arm). 
The primary endpoint was the ORR on day 1 of cycle 7, defined as the proportion of patients in each 
arm with a CR or a PR without the requirement of additional systemic therapies for an earlier 
progression, mixed response or non-response based on investigator assessment per National Institutes 
of Health (NIH) criteria. 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A key secondary endpoint was failure free survival (FFS), a composite time to event endpoint, 
incorporating the earliest of the following events: i) relapse or recurrence of underlying disease or 
death due to underlying disease, ii) non-relapse mortality, or iii) addition or initiation of another 
systemic therapy for chronic GvHD. 
REACH3 met its primary objective. At the time of primary analysis (data cut-off date: 08-May-2020), 
the ORR at week 24 was higher in the Jakavi arm (49.7%) compared to the BAT arm (25.6%). There 
was a statistically significant difference between the treatment arms (stratified Cochrane-Mantel-
Haenszel test p<0.0001, two-sided, OR: 2.99; 95% CI: 1.86, 4.80). Results are presented in Table 10. 
Among the non-responders at cycle 7 day 1 in the Jakavi and BAT arms, 2.4% and 12.8% had disease 
progression, respectively.

The key secondary endpoint, FFS, demonstrated a statistically significant 63% risk reduction of Jakavi 
versus BAT (HR: 0.370; 95% CI: 0.268, 0.510, p<0.0001). At 6-months, the majority of FFS events 
were “addition or initiation of another systemic therapy for cGvHD” (probability of that event was 
13.4% vs 48.5% for the Jakavi and the BAT arms, respectively). Results for “relapse of underlying 
disease” and non-relapse mortality (NRM) were 2.46% vs 2.57% and 9.19% vs 4.46%, in the Jakavi 
and the BAT arms, respectively. No difference of cumulative incidences between treatment arms was 
observed when focusing on NRM only. 
Paediatric population 
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with Jakavi 
in all subsets of the paediatric population for the treatment of MF and PV. In GvHD paediatric patients 
(12 years of age and older), the safety and efficacy of Jakavi are supported by evidence from the 
randomised phase 3 studies REACH2 and REACH3 (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric 
use). In REACH2, responses were observed at day 28 in 4/5 adolescent patients with acute GvHD (3 
had CR and 1 had PR) in the ruxolitinib arm and in 3/4 adolescent patients (3 had CR) in the BAT 
arm. In REACH3, responses were observed at cycle 7 day 1 in 3/4 adolescent patients with chronic 
GvHD (all had PR) in the ruxolitinib arm and in 2/8 adolescent patients (both had PR) in the BAT 
arm.

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Absorption 
Ruxolitinib is a Biopharmaceutical Classification System (BCS) class 1 compound, with high 
permeability, high solubility and rapid dissolution characteristics. In clinical studies, ruxolitinib is 
rapidly absorbed after oral administration with maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) achieved 
approximately 1 hour post-dose. Based on a human mass balance study, oral absorption of ruxolitinib, 
as ruxolitinib or metabolites formed under first-pass, is 95% or greater. Mean ruxolitinib Cmax and total 
exposure (AUC) increased proportionally over a single dose range of 5-200 mg. There was no 
clinically relevant change in the pharmacokinetics of ruxolitinib upon administration with a high-fat 
meal. The mean Cmax was moderately decreased (24%) while the mean AUC was nearly unchanged 
(4% increase) on dosing with a high-fat meal. 
Distribution 
The mean volume of distribution at steady state is approximately 75 litres in MF and PV patients. At 
clinically relevant concentrations of ruxolitinib, binding to plasma proteins in vitro is approximately 
97%, mostly to albumin. A whole body autoradiography study in rats has shown that ruxolitinib does 
not penetrate the blood-brain barrier. 
Biotransformation 
Ruxolitinib is mainly metabolised by CYP3A4 (>50%), with additional contribution from CYP2C9. 
Parent compound is the predominant entity in human plasma, representing approximately 60% of the 
drug-related material in circulation. Two major and active metabolites are present in plasma 
representing 25% and 11% of parent AUC. These metabolites have one half to one fifth of the parent 
JAK-related pharmacological activity. The sum total of all active metabolites contributes to 18% of 
the overall pharmacodynamics of ruxolitinib. At clinically relevant concentrations, ruxolitinib does not 
inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 and is not a potent 
inducer of CYP1A2, CYP2B6 or CYP3A4 based on in vitro studies. In vitro data indicate that 
ruxolitinib may inhibit P-gp and BCRP. 
Elimination 
Ruxolitinib is mainly eliminated through metabolism. The mean elimination half-life of ruxolitinib is 
approximately 3 hours. Following a single oral dose of [14C]-labelled ruxolitinib in healthy adult 
subjects, elimination was predominately through metabolism, with 74% of radioactivity excreted in 
urine and 22% via faeces. Unchanged parent substance accounted for less than 1% of the excreted 
total radioactivity. 
Linearity/non-linearity 
Dose proportionality was demonstrated in the single and multiple dose studies.

Special populations 
Effects of body surface area, age, gender or race 
Based on studies in healthy subjects, no relevant differences in ruxolitinib pharmacokinetics were 
observed with regard to gender and race. In a population pharmacokinetic evaluation in MF patients, 
no relationship was apparent between oral clearance and patient age or race. The predicted oral 
clearance was 17.7 l/h in women and 22.1 l/h in men, with 39% inter-subject variability in MF 
patients. Clearance was 12.7 l/h in PV patients, with a 42% inter-subject variability and no relationship 
was apparent between oral clearance and gender, patient age or race, based on a population 
pharmacokinetic evaluation in PV patients. Clearance was 10.4 l/h in patients with acute GvHD and 
7.8 l/h in patients with chronic GvHD, with a 49% inter-subject variability. No relationship was 
apparent between oral clearance and gender, patient age or race, based on a population 
pharmacokinetic evaluation in GvHD patients. Exposure was increased in GvHD patients with a low 
body surface area (BSA). In subjects with a BSA of 1 m2, 1.25 m2 and 1.5 m2, the predicted mean 
exposure (AUC) was respectively 31%, 22% and 12% higher than the typical adult (1.79 m2). 
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of Jakavi in paediatric patients <18 years old with MF and PV have not been 
established. The pharmacokinetics profile observed in adolescent patients with acute or chronic GvHD 
was comparable to the overall patient population (see section 5.1, “Paediatric population”). 
Ruxolitinib has not yet been evaluated in paediatric patients with acute or chronic GvHD below the 
age of 12. 
Renal impairment 
Renal function was determined using both Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) and urinary 
creatinine. Following a single ruxolitinib dose of 25 mg, the exposure of ruxolitinib was similar in 
subjects with various degrees of renal impairment and in those with normal renal function. However, 
plasma AUC values of ruxolitinib metabolites tended to increase with increasing severity of renal 
impairment, and were most markedly increased in the subjects with severe renal impairment. It is 
unknown whether the increased metabolite exposure is of safety concern. A dose modification is 
recommended in patients with severe renal impairment and end-stage renal disease (see section 4.2). 
Dosing only on dialysis days reduces the metabolite exposure, but also the pharmacodynamic effect, 
especially on the days between dialysis. 
Hepatic impairment 
Following a single ruxolitinib dose of 25 mg in patients with varying degrees of hepatic impairment, 
the mean AUC for ruxolitinib was increased in patients with mild, moderate and severe hepatic 
impairment by 87%, 28% and 65%, respectively, compared to patients with normal hepatic function. 
There was no clear relationship between AUC and the degree of hepatic impairment based on 
Child-Pugh scores. The terminal elimination half-life was prolonged in patients with hepatic 
impairment compared to healthy controls (4.1-5.0 hours versus 2.8 hours). A dose reduction of 
approximately 50% is recommended for MF and PV patients with hepatic impairment (see 
section 4.2). 
In GvHD patients with hepatic impairment not related to GvHD, the starting dose of ruxolitinib should 
be reduced by 50%.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Ruxolitinib has been evaluated in safety pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity and 
reproductive toxicity studies and in a carcinogenicity study. Target organs associated with the 
pharmacological action of ruxolitinib in repeated dose studies include bone marrow, peripheral blood 
and lymphoid tissues. Infections generally associated with immunosuppression were noted in dogs. 
Adverse decreases in blood pressure along with increases in heart rate were noted in a dog telemetry 
study, and an adverse decrease in minute volume was noted in a respiratory study in rats. The margins 
(based on unbound Cmax) at the non-adverse level in the dog and rat studies were 15.7-fold and 
10.4-fold greater, respectively, than the maximum human recommended dose of 25 mg twice daily. 
No effects were noted in an evaluation of the neuropharmacological effects of ruxolitinib. 
In juvenile rat studies, administration of ruxolitinib resulted in effects on growth and bone measures. 
Reduced bone growth was observed at doses ≥5 mg/kg/day when treatment started on postnatal day 7 
(comparable to human newborn) and at ≥15 mg/kg/day when treatment started on postnatal days 14 or 
21 (comparable to human infant, 1–3 years). Fractures and early termination of rats were observed at 
doses ≥30 mg/kg/day when treatment was started on postnatal day 7. Based on unbound AUC, the 
exposure at the NOAEL (no observed adverse effect level) in juvenile rats treated as early as postnatal 
day 7 was 0.3-fold that of adult patients at 25 mg twice daily, while reduced bone growth and fractures 
occurred at exposures that were 1.5- and 13-fold that of adult patients at 25 mg twice daily, 
respectively. The effects were generally more severe when administration was initiated earlier in the 
postnatal period. Other than bone development, the effects of ruxolitinib in juvenile rats were similar 
to those in adult rats. Juvenile rats are more sensitive than adult rats to ruxolitinib toxicity. 
Ruxolitinib decreased foetal weight and increased post-implantation loss in animal studies. There was 
no evidence of a teratogenic effect in rats and rabbits. However, the exposure margins compared to the 
highest clinical dose were low and the results are therefore of limited relevance for humans. No effects 
were noted on fertility. In a pre- and post-natal development study, a slightly prolonged gestation 
period, reduced number of implantation sites, and reduced number of pups delivered were observed. In 
the pups, decreased mean initial body weights and short period of decreased mean body weight gain 
were observed. In lactating rats, ruxolitinib and/or its metabolites were excreted into the milk with a 
concentration that was 13-fold higher than the maternal plasma concentration. Ruxolitinib was not 
mutagenic or clastogenic. Ruxolitinib was not carcinogenic in the Tg.rasH2 transgenic mouse model.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Jakavi is and what it is used for 
Jakavi contains the active substance ruxolitinib. 
Jakavi is used to treat adult patients with an enlarged spleen or with symptoms related to 
myelofibrosis, a rare form of blood cancer. 
Jakavi is also used to treat adult patients with polycythaemia vera who are resistant to or intolerant of 
hydroxyurea. 
Jakavi is also used to treat patients 12 years of age and older and adults with graft-versus-host disease 
(GvHD). There are two forms of GvHD: an early form called acute GvHD that usually develops soon 
after the transplantation and can affect skin, liver and gastrointestinal tract, and a form called chronic 
GvHD, which develops later, usually weeks to months after the transplantation. Almost any organ can 
be affected by chronic GvHD. 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
How Jakavi works 
Enlargement of the spleen is one of the characteristics of myelofibrosis. Myelofibrosis is a disorder of 
the bone marrow, in which the marrow is replaced by scar tissue. The abnormal marrow can no longer 
produce enough normal blood cells and as a result the spleen becomes significantly enlarged. By 
blocking the action of certain enzymes (called Janus Associated Kinases), Jakavi can reduce the size 
of the spleen in patients with myelofibrosis and relieve symptoms such as fever, night sweats, bone 
pain and weight loss in patients with myelofibrosis. Jakavi can help reduce the risk of serious blood or 
vascular complications. 
Polycythaemia vera is a disorder of the bone marrow, in which the marrow produce too many red 
blood cells. The blood becomes thicker as a result of the increased red blood cells. Jakavi can relieve 
the symptoms, reduce spleen size and the volume of red blood cells produced in patients with 
polycythaemia vera by selectively blocking enzymes called Janus Associated Kinases (JAK1 and 
JAK2), thus potentially reducing the risk of serious blood or vascular complications. 
Graft-versus-host disease is a complication which occurs after transplantation when specific cells (T 
cells) in the donor’s graft (e.g. bone marrow) do not recognise the host cells/organs and attack them. 
By selectively blocking enzymes called Janus Associated Kinases (JAK1 and JAK2), Jakavi reduces 
signs and symptoms of the acute and the chronic forms of graft-versus-host disease leading to disease 
improvement and survival of the transplanted cells. 
If you have any questions about how Jakavi works or why this medicine has been prescribed for you, 
ask your doctor. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Jakavi 
Follow all your doctor’s instructions carefully. They may differ from the general information 
contained in this leaflet. 
Do not take Jakavi 
- 
if you are allergic to ruxolitinib or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
if you are pregnant or breast-feeding. 
- 
If either of the above applies to you, tell your doctor who will then decide whether you should start 
treatment with Jakavi. 
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist before taking Jakavi 
- 
if you have any infections. It may be necessary to treat your infection before starting Jakavi. It is 
important that you tell your doctor if you have ever had tuberculosis or if you have been in close 
contact with someone who has or has had tuberculosis. Your doctor may perform tests to see if 
you have tuberculosis or any other infections. It is important that you tell your doctor if you 
have ever had hepatitis B. 
if you have any kidney problems. Your doctor may need to prescribe a different dose of Jakavi. 
if you have or have ever had any liver problems. Your doctor may need to prescribe a different 
dose of Jakavi. 
if you are taking other medicines (see section “Other medicines and Jakavi”). 
if you have ever had tuberculosis. 
if you have ever had skin cancer. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
70 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Talk to your doctor or pharmacist during your treatment with Jakavi 
- 
if you experience unexpected bruising and/or bleeding, unusual tiredness, shortness of breath 
during exercise or at rest, unusually pale skin, or frequent infections (these are signs of blood 
disorders). 
if you experience fever, chills or other symptoms of infections. 
if you experience chronic coughing with blood-tinged sputum, fever, night sweats and weight 
loss (these can be signs of tuberculosis). 
if you have any of the following symptoms or if anyone close to you notices that you have any 
of these symptoms: confusion or difficulty thinking, loss of balance or difficulty walking, 
clumsiness, difficulty speaking, decreased strength or weakness on one side of your body, 
blurred and/or loss of vision. These may be signs of a serious brain infection and your doctor 
may suggest further testing and follow-up. 
if you develop painful skin rash with blisters (these are signs of shingles). 
if you notice skin changes. This may require further observation, as certain types of skin cancer 
(non-melanoma) have been reported. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
Blood tests 
Before you start treatment with Jakavi, your doctor will perform blood tests to determine the best 
starting dose for you. You will need to have further blood tests during treatment so that your doctor 
can monitor the amount of blood cells (white cells, red cells and platelets) in your body and assess 
how you are responding to the treatment and whether Jakavi is having an unwanted effect on these 
cells. Your doctor may need to adjust the dose or stop treatment. Your doctor will carefully check if 
you have any signs or symptoms of infection before starting and during your treatment with Jakavi. 
Your doctor will also regularly check the level of lipids (fat) in your blood. 
Children and adolescents 
This medicine is not intended for use by children or adolescents aged below 18 years, who have the 
disease myelofibrosis or polycythaemia vera because it has not been studied in this age group. 
For the treatment of graft-versus-host disease, Jakavi can be used in patients 12 years and older. 
Other medicines and Jakavi 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. 
It is particularly important that you mention any of the following medicines containing any of the 
following active substances, as your doctor may need to adjust the Jakavi dose for you. 
The following may increase the risk of side effects with Jakavi: 
- 
Some medicines used to treat infections. These include medicines used to treat fungal diseases 
(such as ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole, fluconazole and voriconazole), medicines 
used to treat certain types of bacterial infections (antibiotics such as clarithromycin, 
telithromycin, ciprofloxacin, or erythromycin), medicines to treat viral infections, including 
HIV infection/AIDS (such as amprenavir, atazanavir, indinavir, lopinavir/ritonavir, nelfinavir, 
ritonavir, saquinavir), medicines to treat hepatitis C (boceprevir, telaprevir). 
Nefazodone, a medicine to treat depression. 
Mibefradil or diltiazem, medicines to treat hypertension and chronic angina pectoris.

3. 
How to take Jakavi 
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor or pharmacist has told you. Check with your doctor 
or pharmacist if you are not sure. 
The dose of Jakavi depends on the patient’s blood cell count. Your doctor will measure the amount of 
blood cells in your body and find the best dose for you, particularly if you have liver or kidney 
problems. 
- 
The recommended starting dose in myelofibrosis is 5 mg twice daily, 10 mg twice daily, 15 mg 
twice daily or 20 mg twice daily, depending on your blood cell count. 
The recommended starting dose in polycythaemia vera and in graft-versus-host disease is 10 mg 
twice daily. 
The maximum dose is 25 mg twice daily. 
- 
- 
Your doctor will always tell you exactly how many Jakavi tablets to take. 
During the treatment your doctor may recommend a lower or higher dose to you if the results of blood 
tests show that this is necessary, if you have problems with your liver or kidneys, or if you also need 
treatment with certain other medicines. 
If you receive dialysis, take either one single dose or two separate doses of Jakavi only on dialysis 
days, after the dialysis has been completed. Your doctor will tell you if you should take one or two 
doses and how many tablets to take for each dose. 
You should take Jakavi every day at the same time, either with or without food.

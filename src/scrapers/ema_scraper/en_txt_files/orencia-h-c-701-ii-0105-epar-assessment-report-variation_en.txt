4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are proposed to be updated. The Package Leaflet is updated in 
accordance. In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to update the list 
of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. A revised RMP was included in this submission (version 
21). 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package 
Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions 
P/0128/2014 and P/100/2009 on the agreement of the paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP was not yet completed as some measures were 
deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Scientific advice 
CHMP Scientific Advice was sought in 2012. The Scientific Advice included questions related to the clinical 
development of abatacept in psoriatic arthritis. The design of the pivotal Study IM101332 was discussed

Abatacept  (Orencia) is a selective co-stimulation modulator  that  binds to CD80  and  CD86 on antigen 
presenting  cells,  thereby  blocking  CD80/86  interaction  with  T-cell-expressed  CD28.  The  binding  of 
CD80/86 to CD28 provides a co-stimulatory signal necessary for full activation of T-cells. 
Abatacept administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC), in combination with methotrexate, is 
indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients who 
responded inadequately to previous therapy with one or more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs 
(DMARDs) including methotrexate (MTX) or a tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha inhibitor the treatment 
of  rheumatoid  arthritis  (RA)  in  adults.  It  is  also  approved  for  the  treatment  of  highly  active  and 
progressive disease in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis not previously treated with methotrexate. 
Abatacept IV, in combination with methotrexate, is also indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe 
active polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in paediatric patients 6 years of age and older who 
have had an insufficient response to other DMARDs including at least one TNF inhibitor.

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is an inflammatory arthritis that occurs in up to one-third of patients with psoriasis 
and is usually diagnosed years after the appearance of psoriatic skin disease. TNFi agents were the first 
biologic agents approved for the treatment of PsA. Ustekinumab, an inhibitor of IL-12/23, apremilast, an 
inhibitor of PDE4, and secukinumab, an antibody directed against IL-17, were also recently approved for 
PsA. These therapies have greatly improved the management of patients with PsA. Unfortunately, 40% to 
60% of patients treated with current therapies do not reach a minimal improvement in their joint disease 
(ie, ACR 20) based on clinical trial data. In addition, TNFi-exposed patients may be more resistant to 
treatment,  as  the  proportion  of  subjects  achieving  an  ACR  20  was  lower  for  TNFi-exposed  than  in 
TNFi-naive subjects in trials of ustekinumab, apremilast, and secukinumab. 
This variation was submitted to extend the use of Orencia 250 mg powder for concentrate for solution for 
infusion  (Orencia  IV)  and  for  Orencia  125  mg  solution  for  injection  (Orencia  SC)  in  the  treatment  of 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA). 
The following indication was applied for: 
ORENCIA is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adults when the response to 
previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapy has been inadequate. 
Following assessment of the data, the adopted indication is: 
ORENCIA,  alone  or  in  combination  with  methotrexate  (MTX),  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  active 
psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in adult patients when the response to previous DMARD therapy including MTX 
has been inadequate, and for whom additional systemic therapy for psoriatic skin lesions is not required. 
The posology is: 
ORENCIA 250 mg powder for concentrate for solution for infusion: To be administered as a 30-minute 
intravenous infusion at the dose specified in Table 1. Following the initial administration, ORENCIA should 
be given 2 and 4 weeks after the first infusion, then every 4 weeks thereafter.  
ORENCIA  125  mg  solution  for  injection  in  pre-filled  syringe  /  pen:  ORENCIA  should  be  administered 
weekly at a dose of 125 mg by subcutaneous (SC) injection without the need for an intravenous (IV) 
loading dose.  
The  application  is  based  on  data  from  a  supportive  Phase  2b  study  with  abatacept  administered  IV 
(IM101158) and a pivotal Phase 3 study with abatacept administered SC (IM101332). In both studies 
abatacept  was  compared  to  placebo  in  a  6-month,  double-blind,  short-term  period,  followed  by  an 
open-label long-term period. The long-term period of Study IM101332 is ongoing. 
Scientific Advice was sought in 2012. The design of the pivotal Study IM101332 in psoriatic arthritis was 
discussed, in particular the lack of active control and the inclusion of both DMARD-IR and TNFi-IR patients 
in one trial. The current design was found acceptable provided that the study is fully powered for each 
stratum of patients. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Data on two clinical studies including also pharmacokinetic (PK) data have been submitted to support the 
current application (see Table 1 and Table 2). In addition to the clinical study PK data, a PK analysis has 
been conducted to characterize the abatacept serum concentration-time profile in patients with PsA using 
a PPK model (based on clinical data from studies IM101158 and IM101332) previously developed with 
data from patients with RA and individual abatacept exposures estimated by the PPK analysis  were used 
to characterize E-R relationships with respect to the key efficacy endpoints (i.e. ACR, PASI, DAS28) and 
graphical  analyses  of  safety  endpoints  (e.g.  occurrence  of  infections  and  serious  infections).  The 
formulation  used  in  the  PsA  clinical  studies  has  been  the  same  as  in  the  approved  i.v.  and  s.c. 
formulations for RA. 
The immunogenicity of abatacept and the effect of immunogenicity on PK are described in more detail in 
the Clinical Safety section (and under PK/PD modelling). 
Bioanalytical methods 
Quantitation of Abatacept in Human Serum 
An ELISA assay is used to quantitate abatacept in human serum samples. In the assay, a monoclonal 
anti-CTLA4 antibody (clone 7F8) is used to capture abatacept from the serum samples. The captured 
abatacept is detected using a biotinylated monoclonal mouse anti-human CTLA4 antibody (clone 11D4) 
followed by streptavidin-horseradish peroxidase and a TMB (3,3’,5,5’-Tetramethylbenzidine) substrate. 
The optical densities are read at 450 nm and 620 nm using a microplate reader. Critical reagents include 
the capture antibody (clone 7F8) and the biotinylated monoclonal mouse anti-human CTLA4 antibody.

The  validated  linear  assay  range  was  1.0  -  30.0  ng/mL,  and  within  this  range  the  linear  correlation 
coefficient was R2 ≥ 0.985, accuracy %AR ± 20.0 % and precision % CV ≤20.0 %. Assay acceptance 
criteria also included accuracy requirements for the quality controls.

Detection of Anti-Abatacept Antibodies in Human Serum using an ECL method  
Antibodies against Abatacept, a CTLA4Ig fusion protein, are measured in human serum from Rheumatoid 
Arthritis  (RA)  subjects  using  an  electrochemiluminescent  (ECL)  immunoassay  method  utilizing  MSD 
technology,  which  employs  a  ruthenium  metal  chelate  (SulfoTag)  as  the  ECL  label.  The  low  positive 
quality  control  (prepared  at  10X  in  100%  serum),  negative  control,  buffer  control,  and  samples  are 
EMA/455579/2017

diluted 1:2.5 (resulting in a 40% serum solution) and loaded into the appropriate wells of a polypropylene 
plate.  The  samples  are  then  acidified,  incubated  for  one  hour,  and  neutralized  (20%  serum 
concentration).  Finally,  an  equal  volume  of  2X  label  master  mix  (containing  Abatacept-SulfoTag  and 
Abatacept-Biotin buffer) is added (resulting in 10% serum concentration). Samples are incubated on the 
transfer  plate  for  2  hours.  During  this  time,  anti-Abatacept  antibodies  will  bind  to  both  the 
Abatacept-SulfoTag and Abatacept-Biotin molecules to form an antibody complex bridge. Samples are 
then  dispensed  from  the  transfer  plate  onto  a  Streptavidin  -coated  MSD  assay  plate  (that  has  been 
blocked) and incubated for 1 hour. The Abatacept-Biotin in the complex will bind to the Streptavidin in the 
wells, allowing unbound material to be washed away. Only the samples that contain antibody bound to 
both the Abatacept-SulfoTag and the Abatacept-Biotin will generate an ECL signal when a tripropylamine 
(TPA)-containing  read  buffer  is  added  to  the  plate.  In  the  presence  of  TPA,  ruthenium  produces  a 
chemiluminescent signal that is triggered when voltage is applied. The signal produced is proportional to 
the amount of anti-Abatacept antibody present. 
The ECL immunoassay utilizing Mesoscale Discovery (MSD) technology was validated at ICON Laboratory 
Services,  Inc.,  Whitesboro,  NY,  USA  (M08.MSDAnti-Abatacept.huse.4).  In  this  validation,  the 
determination of seropositivity is based on a statistically defined cut point value of the relative reactivity 
of individual donor serum samples. Anti-abatacept-specific antibodies generated in cynomolgus monkey 
were affinity-purified for use as positive control. Initial validation was conducted with RA donor serum. 
The method was cross- validated for PsA, Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE), Lupus Nephritis (LN), 
Inflammatory  Bowel  Disease  (IBD  –  combined  ulcerative  colitis  (UC)  and  Crohn’s  disease),  Juvenile 
Idiopathic Arthritis - Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis (JIA/JRA), and pediatric serum to establish screening, 
confirmatory and titration cutpoints. The ECL assay differentiated between 2 antibody specificities: (1) 
the  ‘IgG  and/or  junction  region’,  and  (2)  ‘CTLA4  and  possibly  Ig’  regions.  The  assay  included  a 
three-tiered testing approach (screen, confirmation, and titer).  
Human serum samples with raw responses greater than or equal to the statistically determined cutpoint 
were tested in the confirmatory assay. A sample was considered seropositive if immunodepletion was 
observed with abatacept or truncated CTLA4. Confirmed positive samples were titered and reported as 
positive with a titer value. A sample was considered seropositive if immunodepletion was observed with 
abatacept or truncated CTLA4 and reported as positive with a titer of ≥  10. The assay sensitivity was 
estimated during validation as 12.2 ng/mL of antibody in the absence of abatacept.  Using the RA cut 
point, in the presence of 40 μg/mL of abatacept, the assay was able to detect anti-abatacept antibodies 
at a concentration of 250 ng/mL and in presence of 100 μg/mL of abatacept, the assay was able to detect 
anti-abatacept antibodies at a concentration of 2000 ng/mL. Confirmed positive samples from Studies 
IM101158  and  IM101332  that  were  specific  for  ‘CTLA4  and  possibly  Ig’  were  characterized  for  the 
presence of neutralizing antibodies. The validated assay parameters and assay performance are shown 
below (Table 5).

Table 5 -  Bioanalytical methods for detection of anti-abatacept antibodies  
Neutralizing Antibodies to Abatacept  
Human serum samples from Studies IM101158 and IM101332 that confirmed positive to abatacept with 
‘CTLA4 and possibly Ig’ specificity and have abatacept serum concentration levels below 1 μg/ml were 
also characterized for NAb to abatacept using a validated functional cell based bioassay (TLIAM-0004).  
In  this  bioassay,  Jurkat  T  cells  transfected  with  the  luciferase  gene,  under  the  control  of  the  IL-2 
promoter, are costimulated with Daudi B cells in the presence of anti-CD3 antibody. The costimulation 
activates the IL-2 promoter, which in turn produces luciferase protein. The resulting luminescent signal is 
measured  using  a  Luciferase  Assay  System.  In  this  system,  abatacept  produces  a  dose-dependent 
decrease in luciferase activity. In samples containing neutralizing antibody to abatacept, the abatacept 
activity is mitigated, resulting in increased luciferase activity compared to the pre-dose (Day 1) sample. 
The  bioassay  evaluates  neutralizing  antibody  presence  by  comparing  the  response  of  the  postdose 
seropositive serum sample to its corresponding Day 1 (baseline/pre-study) sample. Each post-dose and 
pre-dose sample was spiked with 3 concentrations of abatacept (0.10, 0.25, and 0.50 μg/mL) and the 
response  values  in  relative  light  units  (RLUs)  were  regressed  on  log  of  abatacept  concentration.  A 
linear-regression  function  was  fit  to  the  spiked  response  values,  separately  for  each  sample  and  its 
corresponding Day 1 sample, at abatacept concentrations of 0.10, 0.25, and 0.50 μg/mL. A seropositive 
sample was considered to have neutralizing antibody presence if either of the following was true:  
•  The regression lines for the seropositive sample and its corresponding Day 1 were parallel and both 
the estimated inhibition factor and the lower limit of the 95% CI for the inhibition factor were > 1 
(demonstrating an upward shift of the seropositive sample relative to the Day 1 sample). 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 13/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
•  The seropositive sample and its corresponding Day 1 regression functions were not parallel and the 
median predicted  concentration of the 3  values  at  the  0.25 μg/mL  abatacept  concentration  level 
calculated from the Day 1 regression function for the seropositive sample was < 0.16 μg/mL. This 
value  (0.16  μg/mL)  was  based  on  validation  experiments  and  used  as  the  cutoff  for  identifying 
significant neutralizing activity when parallelism was not demonstrated.  
The assay was validated at Covance (Tandem Labs Inc., Trenton, NJ, US). The assay acceptance criteria 
included requirements for recovery at the  curve  midpoint and the difference  between the spiked and 
non-spiked standard. The assay sensitivity was determined as 2.5 µg/mL neutralizing antibody in neat 
serum and drug interference was observed above the level of 1 µg/mL.  
Clinical study in PsA patients (IM101158) 
This study was the first study of abatacept in PsA patients (a total of 170 patients [both men and women] 
were randomized and treated; 147 completed the short-term [ST] period) and consisted originally of 2 
study  periods:  a  6-months  double-blind,  placebo-controlled  ST  period  and  an  open-label  long-term 
extension (LTE) period for subjects who completed the ST period. The study IM101158 was, however, 
terminated  prematurely  by  the  Bristol-Myers  Squibb  (BMS;  Jan  2011)  due  to  the  modest  efficacy  on 
skin-related parameters. 
The PK of abatacept was a secondary objective and studied by determining the Cmin concentrations at ST 
period. The prediction PK of 3 abatacept treatment groups (see below) using population PK methodology 
was not performed as originally planned (the  reason  for  not using the  PPK  methodology was that  no 
additional information related to the PK would have been received). 
ST-period 
The treatment groups were as follows: 
  Abatacept 3/3 mg/kg regimen by i.v. infusion: 3 mg/kg (calculated dose using patient’s body 
weight at screening) on days 1, 15, 29, 57, days 85, 113 and 141 
  Abatacept  10/10  mg/kg  regimen  by  i.v.  infusion:  10  mg/kg  (weight–tiered  dose  based  on 
patient’s body weight at screening (i.e. fixed dose): 500 mg for patients < 60 kg, 750 mg for 
patients weighing 60-100 kg and 1g for patients weighing > 100 kg) on days 1, 15, 29, 57, 85, 
113 and 141 
  Abatacept 30/10 mg/kg regimen by i.v. infusion: 30 mg/kg (calculated dose using patient’s body 
weight  at  screening)  on  days  1  and  15,  followed  by  10  mg/kg  (weight-tiered  dose  based  on 
patient’s body weight at screening: 500 mg for patients < 60 kg, 750 mg for patients weighing 
60-100 kg and 1g for patients weighing > 100 kg) on days 29, 57, 85, 113 and 141 
 
Placebo (dextrose 5% in water) or normal saline by i.v. infusion on days 1, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113 
and 141. 
Abatacept  infusions  (approximately  30  minutes)  were  administered  at  about  the  same  time  of  day 
throughout the duration of the study. The patients were seated when i.v. infusions were administered 
(unless the clinical situation warranted another position). 
Concomitant use of MTX during the study was permitted, provided the subject had been on a stable dose 
for at least 3 months prior to screening and continued at the stable dose during the study. 
In the ST-period, 42 patients were in the abatacept 30/10 mg/kg group (n = 37 completed), 40 patients 
in the 10/10 mg/kg group (n = 34 completed), 45 patients in the 3/3 mg/kg group (n = 43 completed) 
and 42 patients in the placebo group (n = 33 completed).  
Blood samples (3 to 5 ml/sample) were collected from patients from the arm contralateral to the infusion 
site just prior to the administration of the i.v. infusion on days 1, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, 141, and 169 during 
EMA/455579/2017

the ST period. On days 1, 15, and 85, a blood sample was also collected at about 30 minutes (end of 
infusion). In addition, a single blood sample was collected at any time between days 92 and 106. For 
patients who terminated or discontinued from the study early, blood samples were collected 28, 56 and 
85 days after the last dose of study drug administration.  
The trough plasma concentration (Cmin) concentrations of abatacept in human serum were assayed using 
a validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) by Tandem Laboratories (West Trenton, New 
Jersey, US). The sample analyses were performed at Tandem Labs, a LabCorp Company, West Trenton, 
US (see above for details). 
PK analysis set 
The PK analysis population included 130 patients who received abatacept and had at least 1 evaluable 
serum Cmin concentration. 
Analyses of PK 
Summary statistics were tabulated for Cmin of abatacept by study day and treatment group. Geometric 
means and coefficients of variation were presented for Cmin concentrations. 
PK results 
Geometric  mean  Cmin  of  abatacept  at  steady-state  was  dose-related  during  the  ST  period,  when 
administered as a 30- or 60-minute i.v. infusion on days 1, 15, 29, and every 28 days thereafter to   PsA 
patients (see Table 6). 
Table 6 - Summary statistics for abatacept Cmin concentrations (µg/ml) 
The steady-state levels of abatacept were reached by day 57 for the “3/3” mg/kg and “10/10” mg/kg 
dosing  regimen  and  by  day  85  for  the  “30/10”  mg/kg  dosing  schedule  (see  Figure  1).  Also,  the 
steady-state trough levels of abatacept were similar for the “10/10” mg/kg and the “30/10” mg/kg dosing 
regimen.

The trough concentrations over time of the 2 subjects with on-treatment ADA at Day 169 show that 
concentrations remained consistent before and at the presence of ADA. 
Clinical study in PsA patients (IM101332) 
The study was first 24 weeks (169 days) as double-blind and thereafter open-label (OL) up to 28 weeks. 
At  the  end  of  the  OL  period,  patients  had  the  option  of  entering  a  1-year  LTE  period.  During  the 
double-blind period, patients received weekly s.c. abatacept 125 mg or placebo. During the OL and LTE 
period, all patients received weekly abatacept 125 mg s.c. 
In the ST period, 424 patients (both men and women, n = 213 in abatacept group [total TNFi-naive n=84 
and  total  TNF-exposed  n  =129]  and  n  =  211  in  the  placebo  group  [total  TNF-naïve  n  =81  and  total 
TNF-exposed  n  =130];  mean  age  of  50.4  years)  were  randomized  and  received  at  least  1  dose  of 
double-blind drug.. Overall, 76/213 (35.7%) of subjects in the abatacept group and 89/211 (42.2%) of 
subjects  in  the  placebo  group  were  designated  as  Early  Escape;  these  subjects  left  the  double-blind 
treatment period and transitioned to the OL Period at Day 113. 125 patients in abatacept group and 98 
patients in the placebo group completed the full 169 days of the ST period. 
Overall, 382 patients entered the OL period (197 had received abatacept and 185 had received placebo in 
the ST period). The LTE population consisted of 310 patients (153 had received abatacept and 157 had 
received placebo in the ST period). 
The PK of abatacept was as an exploratory objective. In the ST period, serum samples for measure the 
Cmin concentrations of abatacept were drawn on pre-dose days 1, 85 and 169 in all patients. Additional a 
subset of patients also had PK samples drawn on pre-dose days 29, 57, 113, and anytime between days 
114 and 120. In the OL period Cmin concentrations were assessed for LTE day 57 and day 197 outcomes. 
The objective was to determine PK and exposure-response relationship of s.c. abatacept in PsA patients.  
EMA/455579/2017

In the PK sub-study for 3 patients PK samples were collected and abatacept serum concentration data 
reported although the patients were not consented to the PK sub-study. The data were included in the 
concentration  summaries.  This  protocol  deviation  was  thought  to  have  no  effect  on  the  results  or 
conclusions of the study.  
Validated  ELISA  method  was  used  to  measure  concentrations  of  abatacept  in  serum  (see  above  for 
details). 
PK analysis set 
ST period 
In the full PK analysis set, all patients who received at least one dose of abatacept and who had at least 
1  PK  result  reported  after  start  of  the  medication  were  included.  The  evaluable  PK  analysis  set:  this 
population was a sub-set of the PK analysis population and consisted of the evaluable subjects for PK 
analysis. For all PK summaries and plots, a patient was evaluable for PK analysis at a specific day if the PK 
measurements were collected in the 4 to 10 days window after the previous s.c. abatacept dose and prior 
to the dose of the specific day. The PK analysis set contained 213 PsA patients. 
OL and LTE period 
Serum concentration data were available for 315 patients at OL period day 57; this included 162 patients 
who received abatacept and 153 patients who received placebo during the ST period.   
Serum concentration data were available for 289 patients at OL period day 197; this included 144 patients 
who received abatacept and 145 patients who received placebo during the ST period.  
PK analysis 
The PK parameter Cmin was summarized by geometric mean and %CV. Data obtained from the current 
study was combined with the data from other historical abatacept RA and PsA (IV) studies to perform 
population PK (PPK) analysis. 
PK results 
ST period 
The steady-state in Cmin concentrations was reached at day 57 (see Table 7). From day 57 and onwards, 
the steady-state Cmin concentrations remained consistent over time.

#Treatment groups represent treatment received in the double-blind ST period. 
In both ST and OL/LTE periods Cmin concentrations remained consistent before and after the presence of 
anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA).  Therefore,  the  presence  of  ADA  did  not  appear  to  consistently  affect 
abatacept Cmin values. 
Absorption 
Based on the population PK analysis, the absolute bioavailability of SC abatacept is 77%. 
Distribution 
Population PK analysis of the RA and PsA combined data did not reveal any difference between the 
steady-state volume of distributions of the patient groups. 
Elimination 
Abatacept clearance in patients with PsA was approximately 8% lower relative to patients with RA. This 
difference was not considered clinically meaningful.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The mechanism of action of abatacept in PsA is not completely clarified. Abatacept has greater efficacy in 
the joints vs. skin in PsA and the reason for this is thought to be the distinct pathologies with divergent 
roles of immune cells in skin versus synovial inflammation in PsA. T cells are thought to have a less 
important role in skin inflammation than in joint inflammation. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No new data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.4.   PK/PD modelling 
PK/PD modelling 
The PK of abatacept in patients with RA has been previously characterized by PPK analysis with data from 
11 clinical studies (4 Phase 2 and 7 Phase 3) where abatacept was either administered intravenously (IV) 
or  subcutaneously  (SC).  Abatacept  concentration-time  data  were  well  characterized  by  a  linear, 
two-compartment  PPK  model  with  zero-order  IV  infusion,  first-order  SC  absorption,  and  first-order 
elimination. Abatacept clearance (CL) increased with body weight (BWT), calculated glomerular filtration 
rate (CGFR), and swollen joint count (SWOL); decreased with age (AGE), albumin (ALB), and was lower 
in females and higher in patients on concomitant non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID). Central 
and  peripheral  volume  of  distribution  (VC  and  VP)  increased  with  BWT  and  bioavailability  for  SC 
formulation (F) was lower for the Phase 2 SC formulation than the Phase 3 SC formulation studied in the 
RA program. 
Previous exposure response (E-R) analyses for efficacy and safety following treatment of abatacept for RA 
have  been  conducted.  An  E-R  model  was  developed  for  ACR20  response  and  DAS28-CRP  following 
abatacept IV and SC administration in patients with RA. The probability of ACR20 response was described 
by a logistic regression model with a hyperbolic logit with respect to steady-state trough concentrations 
(Cminss). A nonlinear mixed-effects inhibitory maximum pharmacologic effect (Emax) model with respect to 
time  was  developed  to  characterize  the  E-R  of  abatacept  exposure  and  DAS28  up  to  6  months  after 
initiation of treatment. Abatacept Cminss was the best measure of exposure for predicting DAS28 response 
with an Emax -time course model. 
The objectives of the current PK/PD modelling and simulations were:

 
To characterize the PK of abatacept following i.v. and s.c. administration in patients with PsA and 
to determine the effects of disease (PsA versus RA) on abatacept PK parameters and exposure. 
To characterize the relationship between abatacept exposure and efficacy in patients with PsA. 
To graphically explore the relationship between abatacept exposure and safety in patients with 
 
 
PsA. 
Population pharmacokinetic (PPK) model 
The PPK analysis was conducted to characterize the abatacept serum concentration-time profile in PsA 
patients using a PPK model previously developed with data from patients with RA. 
The PPK model was developed in 4 stages: 
1.  External validation using the final RA model and data from patients with PsA was performed using 
a prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC).  
2.  A base model was developed by re-estimating the parameters of the previously determined final 
model for RA using pooled RA and PsA data.  
3.  A full model was developed to assess the effect of PsA (versus RA) on abatacept clearance (CL).  
4.  A parsimonious final model was tested by performing backward elimination on disease type (PsA 
versus RA) using 0.1% level of significance, corresponding to an increase in the objective function 
of 10.83 for 1 degree of freedom. 
Dataset 
PPK  analysis  included  the  following  RA  studies:  3  phase  2  i.v.  studies  (IM103002,  IM101100,  and 
IM101101);  1  phase  2  s.c.  study  (IM101063);  3  phase  3  i.v.  studies  (IM101102,  IM101029,  and 
IM101031); and 4 phase 3 s.c. studies (IM101167, IM101173, IM101174 [IM101174 PK sub study is also 
included], and IM101185), and following PsA studies: 1 phase 2b i.v. study, IM101158 (double-blinded 
period), and 1 phase 3 s.c. study, IM101332 (double-blinded and OL periods). 
The final PPK analysis dataset had 12962 serum concentration values from 2244 RA and 493 PsA patients 
who received i.v. infusion and/or s.c. injection of abatacept. Of these, a total of 2580 observations were 
from PsA patients. 
PsA patients were more commonly male (46.7% vs. 19.4%), had higher baseline body weight (86.5 ± 
20.0 kg vs. 74.1 ± 19.2 kg), and were more commonly co-medicated with NSAIDs (74.4% vs. 21.7%) but 
less commonly with methotrexate (63.1% vs. 92.4%) and with corticosteroids (41.8% vs. 67.9%) than 
RA patients. PsA patients were also more often Caucasian (88.0% vs. 80.1%) and had lower  baseline 
swollen and tender joint count than RA patients. Baseline age, calculated GFR and liver function tests 
were similar in both patient groups. 
Methods 
The analyses were performed using NONMEM 7.3.0. The previously developed PPK model was a linear 
2-compartment,  zero-order  IV  infusion,  first-order  SC  absorption,  and  first-order  elimination  with  a 
combined residual error model, random effects on F, first-order absorption rate constant (KA), CL, VC, 
inter-compartmental clearance (Q), and VP; and a full block correlation matrix of the random effects of 
CL, VC, Q, and  VP. The  following  covariates were  included:  weight  (BWT),  age  (AGE), gender (SEX), 
co-administration  of  NSAIDs  (NSAID),  albumin  (ALB),  calculated  glomerular  filtration  rate  (CGFR), 
swollen joint count (SWOL), and SC formulation (FORM). The covariate effects on the typical values of 
structural model parameters are described by the following equations: 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 20/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
No  single  pairing  of  covariates  to  be  incorporated  in  the  model  simultaneously  was  highly  correlated 
(Pearson correlation coefficients < |0.42|; Spearman rank test correlations < |0.44|). 
Bioavailability included in the PPK model is the absolute bioavailability, modelled using the inverse logit 
function: 
where  FAbsolute  is  the  individual  absolute  bioavailability,  FTV  is  the  model  estimated  typical  value  for 
bioavailability  prior  to  transformation,  FIIV  is  the  model  estimated  interindividual  variability  (IIV)  for 
bioavailability prior to transformation. 
To prevent flip-flop of parameter estimates and ensure that rate of absorption was always higher than the 
rate of elimination, individual KAs were expressed as the sum of the estimated relative rate of absorption 
and rate of elimination for that individual as shown in the following: 
where KA is the individual absolute rate of absorption, KATV is the model estimated typical value for the 
relative  rate  of  absorption,  KAIIV  is  the  model  estimated  IIV  for  relative  rate  of  absorption.  Kel  is  the 
individual rate of elimination, which is the quotient of the individual clearance (CL) and central volume 
(VC). 
The effect of anti-drug antibody (ADA) status on abatacept concentration and CL in PsA patients was 
explored  graphically. 
Immunogenicity  was 
treated  as  a  stationary  categorical  covariate 
(positive/negative). 
The focus of the full PPK model was the assessment of the effect of PsA (versus RA) on abatacept CL, after 
accounting for the effect of covariates from the base model. Due to the sparse sampling design of the PsA 
studies  (mostly  through  samples),  the  informational  content  of  the  data  with  respect  to  most  PK 
parameters was limited. Therefore the estimates of the PK parameters and their covariate effects, with 
the exception of CL, were anchored by the estimates from the final RA model. The effect of PsA, relative 
to the PK parameter value for a reference (RA) patient, was given by the following expression: 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 21/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
where PREF is the value of the parameter for the reference patient with RA; CLPsA, is the estimated model 
parameter for the effect of PsA; and IPsAi is the indicator variable for PsA status of patient i, respectively 
(1=yes, and 0=no). 
Final PPK model: A continuous covariate was considered clinically relevant if its inclusion resulted in the 
95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  for  lowest  and  highest  values  of  the  covariate  exceeding  the  range  of 
80%-125% of the typical value of the PK parameter (including all other covariates in the model). For a 
categorical covariate, clinical relevance was defined as the 95% CI exceeding the range of 80%-125% of 
the  typical  value  with  this  covariate.  Covariates  were  considered  to  not  be  clinically  relevant  if  the 
associated  change  in  point  estimates  was  between  -20%  and  +25%  and  the  95%  CI  fell  within 
80%-125% of the reference value. 
PPK model application:  
The  final  PPK  model  was  used  to  obtain  maximum  a  posteriori  (MAP)  Bayesian  estimates  of  the  PK 
parameters and measures of exposure (Cmin, Cmax, Cav, Cminss, Cmaxss, and Cavss) for each patient in the 
PPK  analysis  dataset.  The  effect  of  disease  type  (PsA  or  RA)  and  administration  route  on  abatacept 
steady-state exposures was performed using graphical assessment.  
Cmin  and  Cminss  were  defined  as  the  theoretical  trough  concentration  obtained  at  the  time  of  each 
DAS28-CRP  collection  or  at  steady-state,  respectively.  Cmax  and  Cmaxss were  defined  as  the  maximum 
concentration at the time of each DAS28-CRP collection or at steady-state, respectively. Using the final 
PK model, the area under the model-predicted concentration-time curve over the nominal dosing interval 
was  obtained  using  integration  in  NONMEM.  Cmax  was  identified  from  the  model-predicted 
concentration-time  curve  over  the  nominal  dosing  interval  for  each  patient.  Cavg  was  calculated  by 
dividing the area  under the concentration-time curve between  visits with  collection  of DAS28-CRP by 
nominal dosing interval, for example 14 days for every 2 weeks (Q2W). Cavgss was calculated by dividing 
the  area  under  the  steady-state  concentration-time  curve  (AUSss)  between  visits  with  collection  of 
DAS28-CRP by nominal dosing interval, for example 14 days for every 2 weeks (Q2W). The applicable 
AUCss of each patient was obtained for the purpose of computing Cavgss by dividing the abatacept dose by 
the MAP Bayesian estimate of CL. 
Stochastic simulations (that is, including inter individual variability based on the final population PK and 
E-R models) were performed to determine the expected range of abatacept exposures and PD responses 
in PsA patients. The following dosing regimens were used: low dose [50 mg SC weekly and/or 3 mg/kg IV 
monthly], 10 mg/kg IV monthly, and 125 mg SC weekly for 6 months of treatment. To conduct these 
simulations, the efficacy dataset was resampled using covariate information from patients included in the 
Phase 2b/3 dataset of PsA patients (approximately 564 patients) to generate a dataset of 2000 virtual 
patients. Dosing, PK, and PK/PD sampling (sampling on Day 169 [Month 6]) were assigned to each virtual 
patient based on the scenarios described above. Stochastic simulations of the final PK and PK/PD models 
were then used to obtain the predicted PK and PK/PD outcomes. 
Results 
Graphical Analysis of ADA in PsA patients 
Abatacept concentration values were similar for  both  ADA  negative and positive status (Figure  2). In 
addition, there appeared to be no obvious trend in the difference in clearance when stratified by ADA 
status (Figure 3). These results suggest that ADA had little to no impact on the concentration data or PK 
of abatacept. Therefore, immunogenicity was not formally tested as a covariate in the model.

Base PPK model 
Based on the results from the external pcVPC (Figure 4), the previous final RA PPK model adequately 
described the data from patients with PsA. Therefore, the base PPK model was assumed to be identical to 
the  previously  developed  final  PPK  model  describing  abatacept  PK  in  RA  patients;  see  above  for 
description of the model.

Concentration vs. Time After First Dose (right), by PsA Study 
The parameters of the base PPK model were re-estimated with the inclusion of data from PsA patients 
(Studies IM101158 and IM101332). In general, parameter estimates were consistent with those of the 
model in patients with RA; typical values of CL,  VC, Q, and VP  were changed  by  <10%.  The  relative 
standard  errors of the parameter estimates were reasonable with the condition number of the model 
equal to 190, indicating that the model was stable and not overparameterized. The ETA distributions were 
approximately symmetrical and the CWRESI plots showed no obvious trend or bias in the predictions for 
either IV or SC dosing. There was a good agreement between the observed and model-predicted (PRED 
and IPRED) abatacept serum concentrations greater than 1 μg/mL. Although the model tended to slightly 
overpredict  abatacept  concentrations  below  1  μg/mL,  this  is  not  expected  to  adversely  affect  the 
applicability  of  the  model  given  the  small  magnitude  of  the  overprediction,  and  the  small  fraction  of 
patients that are  expected to have Cmin  below 1  μg/mL for therapeutically  relevant  abatacept  dosage 
regimens. 
The base model was additionally tested by removal of potential outliers identified on the  basis of the 
CWRESI,  whereby  predicted  concentrations  associated  with  |CWRESI|  >  6  were  considered  outliers. 
When such points were excluded, the differences in base model fixed effect parameters were < 10% as 
compared to those obtained with these potential outliers included and therefore the points were retained 
in the model.

Full PPK Model and Final PPK model 
The effect of disease type (PsA versus RA) on CL was incorporated into the full model using the Equation 
4.1.2.3A  (see  section  Methods  above)  and  resulted  in  an  8%  decrease  in  clearance  for  PsA  patients. 
Parameters were estimated with good precision (Table 9). The condition number of the model was 206, 
indicating that the model was stable and not over parameterized. ETA shrinkage was moderate for CL 
(19.6%) but high for other parameters (48.9%-83%).

The covariate-parameter relationship of disease (PsA vs. RA) on CL was assessed with the likelihood ratio 
test (LRT) for backward elimination. Since inclusion of this covariate-parameter relationship resulted in a 
decrease in the objective function value of -17.505 (P value 2.866∙10-5), it was retained in the full model 
and backward elimination was not performed. Therefore, the final model was equivalent to the full model.  
Diagnostic plots of the final model are presented in Figure 5 and Figure 6, where the results for the pooled 
studies  are  stratified  by  administration  route.  The  final  model  appropriately  characterized  the  PK  of 
abatacept, with slight overprediction of abatacept concentrations below 1 μg/mL (Figure 5) and slight 
overpredictions at high concentrations after SC administration (Figure 6).

Graphical representations of the effect of covariates on the typical value of structural model parameters 
are presented in Figure 8. The estimated covariate effects (and 95% CI) are relative to CL, VC, or VP at 
the reference values of the covariates given in Table 9. The magnitude of all categorical covariate effects 
generally  encompassed  80%-125%  of  reference  values.  The  effect  of  baseline  body  weight  was 
considered clinically relevant since its effect on the key parameters CL and VP exceeded the 80%-125% 
range. CL and VP increased with increasing baseline body weight. Although the effect of baseline body 
weight  on  VC  was  within  the  80%-125%  CI  range,  the  95%  CI  exceeded  125%  suggesting  that  the 
relationship  might  be  clinically  relevant.  All  other  covariate  relationships  were  completely  contained 
within the 80%-125% range and therefore not considered to be clinically relevant.

The  final  PPK  model  was  used  to  obtain  maximum  a  posteriori  (MAP)  Bayesian  estimates  of  the  PK 
parameters  and  measures  of  exposure  for  each  patient  in  the  PPK  analysis  dataset.  The  estimated 
abatacept  CL  in  PsA  patients  was  about  8%  lower  relative  to  RA  patients,  which  was  within  the 
pre-defined no-effect range of 80-125% (see Figure 9). Therefore, the effect of disease type was not 
considered to be clinically meaningful even though it was statistically significant. Overall, the estimated 
individual PK parameters of abatacept were comparable in RA and PsA patients (Table 10).

Stochastic Simulations in PsA population: Pharmacokinetic comparability 
Simulations of abatacept steady-state concentration versus time profiles were performed for 2000 virtual 
PsA patients. Median steady-state abatacept serum concentrations vs. time profiles for 10 mg/kg i.v. and 
125 mg s.c. are shown in Figure 10by weight tiers. While the 2 routes of administration provide different 
PK profiles, Cminss is approximately similar following administration of abatacept weight-tiered 10 mg/kg 
i.v. and 125 mg s.c. in patients with PsA.  
Since body weight was identified as a significant covariate on the CL of abatacept, predicted exposures 
were stratified by body weight groups (Figure 11). For i.v. abatacept, the Cminss was similar in all 3 body 
weight groups, but Cmaxss and Cavss increased as body weight increased. For s.c. abatacept, Cmin, Cmax and 
Cavg decreased as body weight increased. Model-based simulations predicted 125 mg s.c. weekly and 10 
mg/kg  i.v.  elicited  steady-state  trough  concentrations  at  or  above  11.8  μg/mL  and  8.5  μg/mL, 
respectively in 95% of PsA patients in the total population (Table 12).

PPK analysis 
 
The PK of abatacept is time-invariant and can be described by a linear 2-compartment model with 
zero-order IV infusion, first-order absorption for SC administration, and first-order elimination. 
 
The PK of abatacept is similar in RA and PsA patients; abatacept CL in patients with PsA was 
approximately  8%  lower  relative  to  patients  with  RA.  Overall,  this  resulted  in  slightly  higher 
abatacept  exposures  in  patients  with  PsA.  This  difference  in  exposures,  however,  was  not 
considered to be clinically meaningful. 
  Body weight was the only significant covariate identified to have a clinically meaningful impact on 
exposure. 
  As  expected,  the  s.c.  125  mg  per  week  dosing  regimen  resulted  in  steady-state  Cmin 
concentrations similar to the i.v. 10 mg/kg monthly weight-tiered regimen in PsA patients. 
  Model-based simulations predict that 125 mg s.c. weekly and 10 mg/kg i.v. elicited steady-state 
trough concentrations at or above 11.8 μg/ mL and 8.5 μg/mL, respectively, in 95% of patients 
across all body weights in PsA patients. 
Stochastic Simulations 
Abatacept 125 mg s.c. weekly and 10 mg/kg i.v. monthly delivered similar Cminss in PsA patients. 
Exposure-Response (E-R) model 
The selection of doses to test in the Phase 2 (IM101158) and Phase 3 (IM101332) PsA studies were based 
on the clinical experience in RA given the similarities between the 2 disease states in joints. In RA, the 
dose range of 0.5 mg/kg to 10 mg/kg showed a rise in efficacy with increasing dose. The E-R relationship 
in RA suggested that Cminss of 10 μg/mL and higher were associated with near maximal efficacy in terms 
of  the  probability  of  achieving  ACR20  and  maximal  reduction  in  DAS28-CRP.  Furthermore,  the  s.c. 
formulation was shown to be therapeutically equivalent to the i.v. formulation based on an E-R rationale. 
While  the  2  routes  of  administration  provide  different  PK  profiles,  both  i.v.  (10  mg/kg  weight-tiered 
dosing regimen administered monthly) and the s.c. (fixed dose of 125 mg administered weekly) delivered 
Cminss concentrations of 10 μg/mL and higher in patients across all body weights. 
The dose-response relationship in PsA, following i.v. administration, showed that near maximal efficacy in 
terms of ACR20 was achieved with the 10 mg/kg weight-tiered monthly regimen. Furthermore, over 90% 
of patients with PsA achieved Cminss of 10 μg/mL with i.v. administration of 10 mg/kg monthly. Given the 
similarities in the disease states, it was reasonable to assume that the E-R relationships would be the 
same between RA and PsA, thereby rationalizing the selection of the 125 mg weekly s.c. dosing regimen 
for the Phase 3 PsA study.

Datasets 
The E-R efficacy analyses  included data from patients in the intent-to-treat (ITT) population with PsA 
from the double-blind portion of Studies IM101158 and IM101332. The E-R safety analyses included data 
from patients in the as-treated population with PsA from the double-blind portion of Studies IM101158 
and  IM101332.  The  analyses  were  performed  with  combined  data  from  these  2  studies  to  enable 
assessment of abatacept exposure measures most relevant for clinical outcomes applicable to both routes 
of administration. 
The PPK model-predicted exposure variables (Cminss, Cmaxss, and Cavss) used for the E-R analysis of efficacy 
and safety were obtained by applying the individual parameter estimates from the final PPK model to the 
protocol-specified dose for that patient with the protocol-specified dosing interval were.  
Separate  NONMEM  datasets  were  created  and  E-R  models  developed  for  each  efficacy  endpoint.  The 
efficacy  E-R  analysis  datasets  included:  Exposure  variables;  Response  variables  (ACR  scores,  PASI 
scores,  DAS28-CRP  scores,  enthesitis  scores,  dactylitis  scores,  nail  scores);  Baseline  demographic 
variables  [age,  gender,  baseline  body  weight,  race,  and  formulation  (SC  versus  IV)];  Concomitant 
medication/treatment  variables  [MTX  use  (yes/no),  corticosteroid  (STER)  use  (yes/no),  NSAIDs  use 
(yes/no)];  Baseline  tender  joint  count,  baseline  swollen  joint  count,  baseline  CRP,  baseline  physician 
global assessment, baseline psoriasis-affected BSA; Baseline disease characteristics for each endpoint 
(PASI, DAS28-CRP, enthesitis score, dactylitis score, nail score); Baseline duration of disease state (≤ 1 
years, > 1 to 5 years, > 5 years to 10 years, > 10 years); Anti-TNF use (naive vs. prior users no longer 
on anti-TNF); Immunogenicity (ADA). 
One record per patient was included in the E-R efficacy datasets for ACR scores, PASI scores, enthesitis 
scores, dactylitis scores, and nail scores at Day 169. However, the dataset for DAS28-CRP included all 
collected  scores  over  time.  Immunogenicity  was  treated  as  a  stationary  categorical  covariate 
(positive/negative) in all the efficacy datasets. 
Exploratory  graphical  E-R  analyses  of  select  safety  endpoints  (time  to  first  autoimmune  event,  first 
infection,  first  serious  infection,  and  first  hypersensitivity  reaction;  binary  AEs  autoimmune  event, 
infection, and local injection site reactions) were evaluated. 
Two separate E-R datasets were built for time to event safety endpoints (first autoimmune event, first 
infection,  first  serious  infection,  and  first  hypersensitivity  reaction)  and  binary  adverse  events 
(autoimmune  event,  infection,  and  local  injection  site  reactions).  The  safety  E-R  analysis  datasets 
included: Exposure variables; Response variables (i.e. the aforementioned safety endpoints); Baseline 
demographic variables (age, gender, baseline body weight, race); Immunogenicity (ADA).  
One record per patient per adverse event was included in the E-R safety datasets. 
Methods 
Separate E-R models were developed for the following efficacy endpoints: ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 at 
Day 169; PASI50 and PASI75 at Day 169; and DAS28-CRP scores (time-course and E-R) collected over 6 
months following the initiation of treatment.  
The E-R relationships between abatacept exposure and binary efficacy endpoints (ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, 
PASI50, and PASI75) were described by logistic regression models and included assessments of the effect 
of covariates on these E-R relationships.  
The  time-course  and  E-R  relationship  between  abatacept  exposure  and  DAS28-CRP  scores  were 
described by a mixed effects inhibitory maximum pharmacologic effect (Emax) model with respect to time 
and abatacept exposure and included assessment of the effect of covariates on the E-R relationship.  
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 35/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Given  the  large  number  of  covariates  evaluated  as  predictors  of  efficacy,  graphical  displays  of  the 
empirical  logits  versus  continuous  covariates  were  used  to  determine  the  functional  form  of  each 
covariate to be tested. For categorical covariates tested in the analysis, the number of patients in each 
category was required to exceed 10% of the total number of patients. For race, all non-white patients 
were combined into a single category due to small sample size in nonwhite categories.  
A  single  round  of  forward  selection  was  then  used  to  select  covariates  determined  to  be  statistically 
significant  when  evaluated  univariately  using  an  alpha  level  of  0.01  for  inclusion  in  the  full  model 
(decrease in the objective function of 6.64 with 1 df). The final model for each efficacy endpoint was 
developed from the full model by backward elimination of the covariate effects included in the full model. 
The backward elimination was used to determine a parsimonious model, based upon likelihood ratio test 
(LRT). A significance level of 0.001 was used for the backward elimination, corresponding to an increase 
in the objective function of 10.83 or 13.82, for 1 or 2 degrees of freedom, respectively. 
Two methods of model evaluation were applied to ACR and PASI E-R models: the Hosmer-Lemeshow 
goodness-of-fit  test  and  the  area  under  the  ROC  curve.  It  was  assumed  that  uncertainty  in  the  final 
DAS28-CRP E-R model parameters was small relative to other sources of variability and the adequacy of 
the  final  model  was  evaluated  using  a  simulation-based,  VPC  method.  The  final  model  was  used  to 
simulate 1000 replicates of the analysis dataset with NONMEM.  
Stochastic simulations were performed to address the following issues: 1) predicting efficacy response 
following  a  lower  SC  dose  (50  mg  SC  weekly)  than  previously  tested;  2)  bridging  efficacy  response 
comparing tiered weight-based i.v. administration of 10 mg/kg with 125 mg weekly s.c. dosing; and 3) 
therapeutic equivalence in efficacy response rate comparing IV and SC administration routes in the PsA 
population.  
Results: E-R Efficacy analyses  
E-R analysis: ACR20, ACR50 and ACR70 
The  E-R  analyses  of  ACR20,  ACR50,  and  ACR70  on  Day  169  after  abatacept  or  placebo  dose  were 
conducted with data from patients (N = 592) in PsA studies IM101158 and IM101332 for whom measures 
of abatacept exposure were available or who were randomized to receive placebo. The ACR20 score at 6 
months was the primary endpoint in the Phase 3 clinical study, and therefore the E-R with respect to this 
endpoint was of particular interest. 
ACR20 
The drug effect Emax function was estimated with low precision (> 130% SEM) on the abatacept Cminss at 
which 50% of the maximal response (C50) parameter. There was a correlation between Emax and C50 (r2 
= 0.85). Given this, the drug effect model was re-evaluated. Logistic regression models for the probability 
of  ACR20  response  were  used  to  evaluate  abatacept  exposure  measures  (Cmaxss,  Cminss  and  Cavss)  as 
predictors  of  the  E-R  relationship  using  three  functional  forms:  no  effect,  linear,  or  hyperbolic  (Emax) 
effect. 
The existence of a statistically significant E-R relationship for ACR20 was confirmed by comparing the 
results of the model with the logit as a function of exposure to a model in which the logit was not related 
to exposure (Table 13). Although Cavss as an Emax function showed slightly better decrease in the objective 
function than Cminss as an Emax, it did not provide a much better data fit. Therefore, and to be consistent 
with the exposure measure used in the previous RA analysis, the model with Cminss as an Emax function was 
selected for inclusion in the base model as it described the data in PsA patients well, especially at the 
highest exposure measures.

Table 13 -  Summary of ACR20 Base Model Exposure Assessment 
MTX use as an exponential function and weight as a linear function were the only statistically significant 
covariates  in  the  forward  selection  step  and  they  were  included  in  the  full  model.  In  the  subsequent 
univariate backward elimination step each covariate was removed separately and evaluated for statistical 
significance. Only the effect of MTX use was statistically significant and was retained in the final model. 
The final logit model for the probability of ACR20 response was an Emax function of Cminss and an additive 
effect of MTX use (Table 14). The Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit statistic was 4.38 with 8 degrees of 
freedom  (P  =  0.8211).  The  area  under  the  ROC  curve  was  0.66,  indicating  a  reasonable  fitting  and 
predictive model.   
Table 14 - Final Model for the Probability of ACR20 Response 
The  placebo  effect,  -0.987  on  the  logit  scale,  corresponds  to  a  model-predicted  probability  of  ACR20 
response of 0.15 and 0.27 in the absence and presence of MTX use, respectively. For patients receiving

abatacept, at the median Cminss (26 μg/mL) the model-predicted probability of ACR20 is 0.48 and 0.31 
with and without MTX use, respectively. There is a lack of effect of MTX use on placebo corrected ACR20 
response since MTX use affects the model-predicted probability of ACR20 response in placebo patients 
and  patients  receiving  abatacept  similarly  (ie,  differences  between  placebo  and  125  mg  SC  (median 
Cminss) of 0.21 with MTX use and 0.16 without MTX use). At the observed 25th to 75th percentile range of 
Cminss for 125 mg s.c. and 10 mg/kg i.v. abatacept, the probability of ACR20 response was approaching a 
plateau (Figure 12). The model-predicted probabilities of ACR20 response by MTX use for 10/10 mg/kg IV 
and 125 mg SC abatacept are provided in Table 15. The Cminss percentiles for 10/10 mg/kg IV and 125 mg 
SC were similar with a similar model-predicted probability of ACR20 response.

ACR50 and ACR70 
Cminss as a linear function was the most statistically significant predictor of both ACR50 and ACR70. None 
of the covariates evaluated met the criteria for statistical significance for ACR50 and ACR70 in the forward 
selection step. The Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit statistic was 5.20 (8 df, P = 0.7360) and 5.08 (8 df,

P = 0.7485) and the area under the ROC curve was 0.60 and 0.61 for the final ACR50 and ACR70 model, 
respectively. 
The final model-predicted probability of ACR50 and ACR70 response versus Cminss is presented in Figure 
13 along with the observed proportion of ACR50 responders for groups of Cminss.

E-R analysis: PASI50 and PASI75 
The E-R analyses of efficacy endpoints, PASI50 and PASI75, on Day 169 after abatacept or placebo dose 
was conducted with data from  patients (N = 375)  in PsA  studies IM101158 and IM101332 for whom 
measures of abatacept exposure were available or who were randomized to receive placebo, and had a 
baseline psoriasis-affected body surface area (BSA) ≥  3%. 
Cminss as a linear function was used for PASI50 and PASI75. No covariates were identified to significantly 
influence the E-R for PASI responses. The probability of achieving PASI response at day 169 was found to 
increase with increasing Cminss. At the median Cminss (25 μg/mL and 24 μg/mL) from administration of 125 
mg  s.c.  or  10  mg/kg  i.v.  abatacept,  the  model-predicted  probability  of  PASI50  was  0.29  and  0.28, 
respectively. Similarly, assuming the median Cminss from administration of 125 mg s.c. or 10 mg/kg i.v. 
abatacept,  the  model-predicted  probability  of  PASI75  was  0.17  and  0.16,  respectively.  The  final 
model-predicted probability of PASI50 response versus Cminss is shown in Figure 14.

E-R: DAS28-CRP 
The E-R analyses of efficacy endpoint, DAS28-CRP (calculated using C-reactive protein, up to 6 months 
after first abatacept or placebo dose), was conducted with data from patients (N = 582) in PsA studies 
IM101158  and  IM101332  for  whom  measures  of  abatacept  exposure  were  available  or  who  were 
randomized to receive placebo. 
A non-linear mixed-effects inhibitory maximum pharmacological effect (Emax) model with respect to time 
was developed to characterize the E-R of abatacept exposure and DAS28. Cminss was the best measure of 
exposure for predicting the DAS28-CRP response with an Emax time-course model. The magnitude of the 
maximal decrease in DAS28-CRP  increased with increasing  Cminss. The  prediction  for  the  change from 
baseline  in  DAS28-CRP  were  -1.29  and  -1.30,  respectively,  at  doses  10  mg/kg  i.v.  and  125  mg  s.c. 
weekly assuming median Cminss, greater than that from the placebo arm, -0.83. The scatterplot of the 
observed change in DAS28-CRP scores from baseline versus Cminss with the final model-predicted line 
overlaid is presented in Figure 15.

versus abatacept Cminss with model-predicted line overlaid 
The model was parameterized in terms of baseline DAS28-CRP (BL), maximum reduction in DAS28-CRP 
score (EMX0), and T50. Additive IIV on BL and Emax were included. Exponential IIV was included on T50. 
An additive residual error model was used. The covariate analysis showed that the baseline DAS28-CRP 
(BL)  increased  with  increasing  baseline  SWOL,  baseline  CRP,  and  baseline  tender  joint  count.  No 
statistically significant covariate effects were found on either the Emax or T50 parameters. 
The scatterplot of observed DAS28-CRP scores versus days since first dose with the final model-predicted 
lines overlaid for each dose is shown in Figure 16.

Graphic analysis: Enthesitis, dactylitis and nail scores 
Enthesitis  scores  were  collected  in  studies  IM101158  and  IM101332  and  were  presented  together. 
Dactylitis  scores  were  collected  differently  in  the  studies  and  separate  plots  were  created  by  study. 
Nail-visual analogue scale (VAS) scores were only available in study IM101332. 
The  exploratory  graphical analyses  showed  that  there  appears  to  be  a  shallow  decrease  in  enthesitis 
scores with increasing exposure to abatacept, with a slightly more evident trend in study IM101158 than 
in study IM101332.  
For study IM101158, there also appeared to be a slight decrease in the change from baseline dactylitis 
scores with increasing exposure to abatacept. However, there appeared to be no relationship between 
dactylitis and abatacept exposure in study IM101332.  
In Study IM101332, as abatacept exposure increased, nail-VAS scores decreased on day 169. 
When comparing Cmin steady-state (median ~26 μg/mL) following administration of the 10 mg/kg i.v. and 
125 mg s.c. dosing to placebo, there were numerical improvements in enthesitis, dactylitis and nail-VAS 
scores (study IM101332) and enthesitis and dactylitis (study IM101158). 
Graphic analysis: Time to event Safety results 
The E-R analyses of time to event safety endpoints (first autoimmune event, first infection, first serious 
infection, and first hypersensitivity reaction) and binary adverse events (autoimmune event, infection, 
and  local  injection  site  reactions)  were  conducted  with  data  from  patients  (N  =  592)  in  PsA  studies 
IM101158  and  IM101332  (double  blinded  period)  for  whom  measures  of  abatacept  exposure  were 
available or who were randomized to receive placebo. 
The  number  of  patients  who  had  at  least  one occurrence  of  an  autoimmune  event,  infection,  serious 
infection, or hypersensitivity reactions was low (see Table 16). 
Table 16 - Summary of first occurrence of adverse events in the E-R safety analysis 
The model predicted distributions of Cminss, Cmaxss and Cavgss of patients with at least one observed infection 
were comparable to the model predicted exposures of patients with no observed event. 
Within  the  range  of  Cminss,  Cmaxss,  Cavgss  associated  with  the  abatacept  doses  studied  there  was  no 
apparent relationship between exposure and the probability of experience an infection.

Stochastic simulations 
The probability of ACR20 response and PASI50 response on Day 169 was simulated using the virtual PsA 
patients’ exposure measures and the final E-R models. Summary statistics of the simulated probability of 
ACR20 and PASI50 are shown in Table 17 by treatment regimen. The results for ACR20 are illustrated in 
Figure 17 stratified by MTX use and dosage. The model-predicted ACR20 response was similar between 
10  mg/kg  i.v.  once  monthly  and  125  mg  s.c.  weekly;  lower  doses  were  predicted  to  provide  inferior 
clinical response. Figure 18 provides the simulated probability of ACR20 versus Cminss with shaded regions 
representing the 90% prediction interval for the absence and presence of MTX use.

E-R analyses of efficacy 
  As seen in RA patients, an Emax model adequately described the E-R relationship for ACR20 in 
PsA patients. 
 
The Cminss was a statistically significant predictor of ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 on day 169, as 
seen earlier with RA. The probability of ACR response at day 169 increased with increasing values 
of  Cminss.  Maximal  ACR20  response  was  achieved  within  the  observed  Cminss  range  for  the  10 
mg/kg i.v. and 125 mg s.c. dosing regimens. 
  MTX use was a statistically significant predictor of ACR20 on day 169 whereby the probability of 
ACR20 response increased with use of MTX by approximately 55% at the median Cminss associated 
with the 10 mg/kg i.v. monthly regimen (26 μg/mL) and 125 mg s.c. weekly regimen (26 μg/mL). 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 44/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
However, when the ACR20 responses relative to placebo were compared, MTX did not affect the 
ACR20 E-R relationship. 
 
 
E-R  relationships  for  PASI50  and  PASI75  were  described  by  a  linear  function  of  Cminss;  PASI 
response was achieved within the observed Cminss range for the 10 mg/kg i.v. and 125 mg s.c. 
dosing regimens. 
The  Cminss  was  a  statistically  significant  predictor  of  PASI50  and  PASI75  on  day  169.  The 
probability of PASI response at Day 169 increased with increasing values of Cminss. Although not 
obtaining the maximal possible response, PASI50 response achieved noticeable numerical effect 
within the observed Cminss exposure. 
  Baseline  weight,  age,  baseline  tender  joint  count,  baseline  SWOL,  baseline  CRP,  baseline 
physician  global  assessment,  baseline  psoriasis-affected  BSA,  baseline  DAS28-CRP,  baseline 
PASI, baseline duration of disease, sex, race, formulation type, STER use, NSAID use, anti-TNF 
use, and ADA were not identified as statistically significant predictors of the probability of ACR20, 
ACR50, ACR70, PASI50, or PASI75 on Day 169 in patients with PsA. In addition, MTX use was not 
a significant predictor of the probability of ACR50, ACR70, PASI50, or PASI75 on day 169. 
 
The Cminss was a statistically significant predictor of DAS28-CRP scores over time. The magnitude 
of the maximal decrease in DAS28-CRP increased with increasing Cminss. The prediction for the 
change from baseline in DAS28-CRP were -1.29 and -1.30, respectively, at doses 10 mg/kg i.v. 
and 125 mg s.c. weekly assuming median Cminss, greater than that from the placebo arm, -0.83. 
  No  statistically  significant  influence  of  age,  baseline  weight,  baseline  physician  global 
assessment, baseline psoriasis-affected BSA, baseline DAS28-CRP, baseline duration of disease, 
sex,  race,  formulation  type,  STER  use,  NSAID  use,  anti-TNF  use,  or  ADA  was  found  for 
DAS28-CRP scores. 
  Across endpoints, including ACR20, ACR50, ACR70, PASI50, PASI75, and DAS28-CRP, the Cminss 
was identified as the best exposure predictor for efficacy. 
  When comparing Cminss (median ~26 μg/mL) following administration of the 10 mg/kg i.v. and 
125 mg s.c. dosing to placebo, there were numerical improvements in enthesitis, dactylitis and 
nail-VAS scores (Study IM101332) and in enthesitis and dactylitis (study IM101158). 
Stochastic Simulations 
  Abatacept 125 mg s.c. weekly provided similar response to 10 mg/kg i.v. once monthly in both 
ACR20 and PASI50 at 6 months. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The PK data of abatacept in PsA patients were obtained from 2 clinical studies. In addition simulated PK 
data  from  the  PPK  model  and  exposure-response  (E-R)  analysis  data  of  efficacy  and  safety  were 
presented. 
Three  analytical  methods  in  IM101158  and  IM101332  clinical  studies  have  been  used  to  assess  the 
concentration of abatacept and anti-abatacept antibodies in human serum. The assays include an ELISA 
assay for quantification of abatacept, ECL assay for the detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADA), and an 
in-vitro assay for analysis of anti-drug neutralizing antibodies (NAb). In general, the bioanalytical assays 
used to quantitate abatacept and anti-abatacept antibodies as well as neutralizing antibodies in human 
serum samples were adequately described and appropriately validated.  
However, some concerns were raised regarding the NAb assay. The in-vitro cell assay for neutralizing 
abatacept  antibodies  was  validated  using  normal  human  serum  matrix,  having  a  final  serum 
concentration of 4%. The assay was found tolerant for drug levels below 1 µg/mL. Therefore the clinical 
samples analysed in the Nab assay must have abatacept concentration ≤ 1 µg/mL.  Drug interference 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 45/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
occurs at levels relevant in patient sera which clearly compromises the value of the assay. It is however 
concluded that the uncertainties related to the suitability of the Nab assay are not affecting the benefit/ 
risk profile of abatacept in the treatment of PsA. A post-approval recommendation was requested.  For 
any future application for Orencia containing immunogenicity assessment, the MAH will improve the Nab 
assay, particularly the drug tolerance for abatacept levels more relevant in patients’ sera. 
In the clinical study IM101158, the studied abatacept doses were “30/10” mg/kg (by weight) “10/10” 
mg/kg (fixed dose), “3/3 mg/kg (by weight) and placebo as an i.v. infusion administered  on days 1, 15, 
29,  57,  85,  113  and  141  (=  20  weeks  after  infusion).  The  selected  doses  and  time  points  for 
administration i.v. abatacept in this first clinical study in PsA patients were adequate on the basis of the 
earlier  performed  clinical  studies  with  abatacept  (e.g.  in  RA  patients).  The  study  included  initially  a 
double-blind short-term (ST) period of 6 month and thereafter an open-label (OL) long-term extension 
(LTE)  period;  however;  the  LTE  period  was  prematurely  terminated  due  to  the  modest  efficacy  on 
skin-related parameters. The planned population PK analysis was not performed because no additional 
information related to the PK would have been received. The mean Cmin values with the dosing regimens 
“10/10” mg/kg and “30/10” mg/kg were greater (mean Cminss concentrations were 24-33 μg/ml) than 
the target abatacept steady-state concentration of ≥  10 µg/ml.  Whereas, the mean Cminss concentrations 
with “3/3” mg/kg regimen were ≤  10 µg/ml. The Cmin concentrations were similar level with “10/10” 
mg/kg and “30/10” mg/kg doses as earlier seen in the clinical studies with similar dosing regimen and 
route in RA patients. The variations in Cmin values were moderate or great (CV%s of 29-57%). The Cminss 
concentrations were reached between day 57 and day 85 depending on the dose and this is consistent 
with the t1/2 of abatacept of about 13 days (ranging from 8 to 25 days), as reported in RA patients. The PK 
of abatacept in PsA patients shows dose-proportional increases of Cmin over the dose range of 3 mg/kg to 
10 mg/kg.  
In  the  clinical  study  IM101332,  the  first  24  weeks  (169  days)  were  as  double-blind  and  thereafter 
open-label (OL) up to 28 weeks. At the end of the OL period, patients had the option of entering a 1-year 
LTE period. In the double-blind period, patients received weekly s.c. abatacept 125 mg or placebo. During 
the OL and LTE period, all patients received weekly s.c. abatacept 125 mg. The Cminss concentrations were 
reached at day 57. The mean Cminss concentrations after abatacept 125 mg s.c. weekly remain between 
28 µg/ml and 30 µg/ml in both ST period and OL/LTE periods. The variations in the Cminss concentrations 
were great (CV%s of 37-54%).  
Conclusions  related  to  the  PK  of  abatacept  from  these  2  clinical  studies  (on  the  basis  of  the  Cmin 
concentrations) are that the exposure with 125 mg s.c. weekly is similar in PsA patients as in RA patients 
and with 10 mg/kg i.v. (administered on day 1, 2,  4 and every 4 weeks thereafter) and 125  mg s.c. 
weekly the similar exposure to abatacept are achieved. 
On the basis of the PPK model, the PK of abatacept can be described by a linear 2-compartmental model 
with  zero-order  absorption  for  i.v.  infusion  and  first-order  absorption  for  s.c.  administration,  and 
first-order elimination. Abatacept CL was ~ 8% lower in PsA patients compared with RA patients. The 
effect of disease type on CL was statistically significant but not clinically meaningful. Body weight was the 
only covariate retained in the final PPK model: Abatacept CL and VP slightly increased with increasing 
weight, and a similar trend was observed for VC. Predicted systemic exposure (Cminss) of abatacept was 
overall  comparable  following  s.c.  (125  mg  weekly)  and  i.v.  administration  (weight-based  doses  ~  10 
mg/kg monthly). As expected, patients with lower body weight had  higher Cminss after fixed-dose  s.c. 
administration than patients with higher body weight. Presence of anti-drug antibodies had no detectable 
impact on the CL of abatacept following i.v. or s.c. administration. 
Conclusions from the E-R analyses were that Cminss was the best exposure predictor for efficacy responses 
(i.e. ACR, PASI, DAS28-CRP). The relationship between abatacept Cminss and ACR20 in PsA patients was 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 46/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
described  with  an  Emax  function,  MTX  use  was  included  as  an  additive  effect  in  the  model.  MTX  use 
increased the probability of ACR20 response, however; the difference in ACR20 response of the abatacept 
group compared with the placebo group was similar (~ 20%) with and without MTX. No associations 
between estimated exposure to abatacept and selected safety parameters (e.g.  any infection; serious 
infection;  hypersensitivity  reaction;  autoimmune  disorder)  were  observed.  However,  this  should  be 
interpreted with caution because serious adverse reactions were observed in only few patients.  
The mechanism of action of abatacept in PsA is not completely clarified. Abatacept has greater efficacy in 
the joints vs. skin in PsA and the reason for this is thought to be the distinct pathologies with divergent 
roles of immune cells in skin  versus synovial  inflammation in PsA.  T  cells are  thought  to  have a  less 
important role in skin inflammation than in joint inflammation. 
Relevant PK data for the adult PsA population obtained from both clinical studies and in agreement with 
the results of the PPK analysis has been included in section 5.2 of the SmPC. 
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics of abatacept in PsA patients was comparable to PK in RA patients. 
Regarding the NAb assay it was observed that drug interference occurs at levels relevant in patient sera 
which might compromise the value of the assay. It was although concluded that the uncertainties related 
to the suitability of the Nab assay do not put into question the benefit/ risk profile of abatacept in the 
treatment of PsA. However, CHMP recommended that for any future application for Orencia containing 
immunogenicity assessment the MAH should improve the Nab assay, particularly the drug tolerance for 
abatacept levels more relevant in patients’ sera. 
2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
2.4.1.  Dose response study 
A Phase IIB, Multi-Dose, Multi-Centre, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-controlled Study 
to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of Abatacept Versus Placebo in the Treatment of Psoriatic 
Arthritis (Study IM101158) 
Methods 
Study IM101158 consisted of 2 study periods: a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled ST period and 
an open-label LT extension period for subjects who completed the ST period. Although the pre-specified 
primary objective was achieved for this study, namely, abatacept at doses of 30/10 mg/kg and 10/10 
mg/kg demonstrated statistically superior ACR 20 response rates at Day 169 compared to placebo, the LT 
period of the study was prematurely terminated due to the modest efficacy on skin-related parameters. 
Notification of the intent to terminate this study was sent to all sites participating in the LT period in a 
letter dated 31-Aug-2010, and sites were instructed to discontinue treatment in all active subjects as of 
Jan-2011. 
Subjects with PsA were evaluated during the screening period, and those who met all study eligibility 
criteria were stratified by percentage of psoriasis-affected BSA (≥ 3% vs < 3 %) and randomized on Day 
1 in a 1:1:1:1 ratio to treatment with 1 of 3 regimens of abatacept (30/10 mg/kg, 10/10 mg/kg, 3/3 
mg/kg) or placebo. During the ST period, study medication (abatacept or placebo) was infused IV in a 
double-blind manner on Days 1, 15, 29 and every 28 days thereafter. Subjects who completed the ST

Treatments 
Subjects received 1 of the following 4 treatments during the ST period: 
  Abatacept 30/10 mg/kg regimen by IV infusion: abatacept 30 mg/kg (by weight) on Days 1 and 
15 followed by abatacept (fixed dose) approximating 10 mg/kg on Days 29, 57,85, 113, and 141 
  Abatacept 10/10 mg/kg regimen by IV infusion: abatacept (fixed dose) approximating 10 mg/kg 
on Days 1, 15, 29, 57, 85, 113, and 141 
  Abatacept 3/3 mg/kg regimen by IV infusion: abatacept 3 mg/kg (by weight) on Days 1, 15, 29, 
57, Days 85, 113, and 141 
 
Placebo (dextrose 5% in water [D5W]) or normal saline (NS) by IV infusion on Days 1, 15, 29, 57, 
85, 113, and 141 
During LT period, all participating subjects received a fixed dose of open-label abatacept approximating 
10 mg/kg by IV infusion beginning on Day 169 and every 28 days thereafter. 
The first 2 doses of study drug in the ST period were administered utilizing a “double-dummy” design, 
necessitated by the absence of stability data for concentrations of abatacept with the 3 mg/kg dosage and 
30 mg/kg dosage. Specifically, all subjects received simultaneous 250 cc and 100 cc infusions. Beginning 
with the infusion on Day 29, all infusions were given in 100 cc of NS or D5W over 30 minutes.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy outcome measure for the ST period was an ACR 20 response at study Day 169. Other 
joint-related efficacy endpoints measured during the study (ST and LT periods) were the proportion of 
subjects who had an ACR 50 and ACR 70 response; proportion of subjects with a HAQ response 
(improvement of at least 0.3 units from baseline in HAQ-Disability Index [DI]); proportion of subjects 
with a clinical response, defined as a reduction of at least 1.2 units from baseline in the Disease Activity 
Score-28 based on C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) score; mean changes from baseline in physical and 
mental component scores (PCS and MCS) of the SF-36; and mean change from baseline in bone erosions, 
bone edema, synovial volume, dactylitis and enthesitis as measured by MRI. 
Skin-related efficacy endpoints included the proportion of subjects who achieved an IGA score of clear or 
almost clear; mean percent improvement from baseline in the target lesion score and the percentage of 
subjects with at least a 50% or 75% improvement in target lesion score (TL50, TL75); and proportion of 
subjects with baseline BSA ≥ 3% for psoriasis who achieved a 50% or 75% improvement in psoriasis as 
measured by the Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI 50 and PASI 75). 
Sample size 
According to prior RA studies, the ACR 20 response rate was estimated to be 20% in the placebo. A total 
of 164 randomized subjects allocated evenly to the 4 treatment groups yielded 92% power to detect an 
absolute difference of 35% in ACR 20 response rate between the 30/10 mg/kg abatacept treatment group 
and the placebo. In addition, it yielded at least 84% power to detect the same difference in ACR 20 
response rate between the 10/10 mg/kg abatacept group and the placebo using the sequential test 
procedure. 
Randomisation 
At the time of enrolment, each subject was assigned a unique sequential subject number for identification 
throughout the study via the Central Randomization System (Interactive Voice Randomization System 
[IVRS]).   
The block size for randomization was 4. Randomization was stratified by the percentage of 
psoriasis-affected BSA (≥ 3% or < 3 %) at the time of the screening visit.

Blinding (masking) 
In the ST period, the subjects and clinical investigational staff were blinded to treatment assignment. The 
pharmacist (or qualified drug preparation person) was unblinded to study medication and prepared the 
appropriate dose of active drug or placebo. 
The LT period was open-label in design beginning with the first dose of study drug on Day 169. 
Statistical methods 
Efficacy analyses for the ST period were based on all randomized and treated subjects. For all the 
response rate comparisons between the treatment groups (placebo with each of the 3 abatacept 
regimens), Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) Chi-square tests with randomization stratification were 
performed, unless otherwise noted. All comparisons of changes from baseline and construction of 
confidence intervals (CIs) for continuous measures were based on an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) 
model that included treatment as the main factor and the baseline values as a covariate. 
All subjects who prematurely discontinued the study after receiving study drug, regardless of reason, had 
missing ACR, IGA, HAQ, PASI response, and target lesion responses imputed as non-responders at all 
scheduled protocol visits subsequent to the point of discontinuation. Missing target lesion scores at Day 
169 were imputed using a last observation carried forward (LOCF) approach. 
No formal statistical testing was done on any data for the LT period. Analyses of safety, immunogenicity, 
and efficacy were descriptive in nature and based on as-observed data. All efficacy and safety analyses 
for the LT period were performed on the All Treated Subjects in the LT Period population, defined as 
subjects who received at least 1 infusion of abatacept in the LT period, and were presented by randomized 
treatment cohort in the ST period. 
Results 
Participant flow 
ST period 
A total of 191 subjects were enrolled in the study; of these, 170 were randomized. The primary reasons 
that enrolled subjects were not randomized were failure to meet study criteria (13/21) and withdrawal of 
consent (5/21). Of the 170 randomized and treated subjects, 147 subjects completed the 6-month ST 
period, and the completion rate was higher for the abatacept treatment groups (95.6%, 85.0%, and 
86.0% for abatacept 3/3, 10/10, and 30/10 mg/kg groups, respectively) than for the placebo group 
(78.6%). Among the 23 subjects across all treatment groups who were discontinued from the ST period, 
there were no clinically relevant differences in the proportion of subjects discontinued for a specific reason 
among the 128 abatacept-treated and the 42 placebo-treated subjects (see Table 18).

Open-label period 
Each of the 147 treated subjects who completed the ST period entered the LT period and received at least 
1 infusion of open-label abatacept (All Treated Subjects in LT Period population). Approximately one-half 
of the 147 subjects treated in the LT period were discontinued for administrative reasons related to 
termination of the study by BMS (n = 76, 51.7%). Lack of efficacy (34.0%) was the second most common 
reason for discontinuation during the LT period. Four subjects (2.7%) were discontinued from the LT 
period due to an AE(s) (2.7%). The proportion of subjects who were discontinued due to study 
termination or lack of efficacy did not differ as a function of randomized treatment in the ST period (see 
Table 19).

Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
A total of 7 subjects had a relevant protocol deviation, including 6 (13.3%) in the abatacept 3/3 mg/kg 
group and 1 (2.4%) in the placebo group. No subject in the abatacept 10/10 or 30/10 mg/kg groups had 
a relevant protocol deviation. For 4 of the 6 subjects in the abatacept 3/3 mg/kg group, the relevant 
deviation consisted of not having a stable MTX dose for at least 28 days prior to screening. 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study 
There were 4 amendments to the original protocol and 2 administrative letters. Study IM101158 was 
terminated by BMS after completion of the ST period, and notification of the intent to terminate this study 
EMA/455579/2017

was communicated to all sites participating in the LT period in a letter dated 31-Aug-2010. Sites were 
instructed to discontinue treatment in all active subjects as of Jan-2011. 
Changes to the planned analysis 
The planned prediction of PK data for the 3 abatacept treatment groups using population PK methodology 
was not performed as it was determined that this type of analysis would not provide any relevant 
information over the observed summary of Cmin data. Samples collected for the pharmacogenetic 
analysis were not analyzed. 
The ACR 20 and ACR 50 response rates at Day 169 were summarized by treatment group using point 
estimates and 95% CI for subjects who had and had not previously been exposed to TNF inhibitors. These 
post hoc analyses were added in order to determine the relative efficacy in each of these subgroups. 
Baseline data 
A total of 91 males (53.5%) and 79 females (46.5%), with a mean age of 51.3 years (range: 26 to 82 
years) participated in the study. Subjects were predominately white (97.6%), with a mean body weight 
of 89.7 kg (range 49 to 149.7 kg). The majority of subjects (57.1%) were enrolled at sites in North 
America. The mean IGA score at baseline (2.5) indicated mild to moderate skin disease, while the mean 
tender and swollen joint counts suggested moderate arthritis activity at baseline (22.2 and 10.9, 
respectively). 
The majority of subjects in each treatment group had a history of MTX use prior to enrolment (69.0% to 
85.0% across the 4 treatment groups), and approximately 60% of subjects in each treatment group were 
receiving MTX at enrollment (range: 57.1% to 60.0%) (see Table 20). Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs were the second most common anti-rheumatic drug class used at enrolment (range: 54.8% to 
71.1%). A total of 63 of the 170 randomized and treated subjects (37.0%) had a history of anti-TNF 
biologic use, and previous use of these agents was more common for subjects randomized to the 
abatacept 30/10 mg/kg group (51.2%) and ranged from 28.6 to 35.6% for the other 3 treatment groups. 
No subject was receiving biologic therapy at enrollment into the study.  
While between 21.4% and 27.5% of subjects had a history of DMARD therapy (other than MTX), only a 
small minority of randomized and treated subjects were receiving non-MTX DMARD therapy at the time of 
study enrollment (5.0% to 8.9% across treatment groups). Between approximately one-fifth and 
one-quarter of subjects in each treatment group (19.0% to 27.5%) were receiving corticosteroids at 
enrollment. The mean oral steroid dose was similar across the 4 treatment groups. With respect to 
concomitant therapy, the number of subjects who used concomitant corticosteroids was slightly higher 
than that reported at Day 1.

Numbers analysed 
All of the randomized and treated subjects received double-blind study medication in the ST period 
according to the randomization schedule. Thus, the All Treated and the ITT (also called All Randomized 
and Treated Subjects) analysis populations were identical and included a total of 170 subjects (43 in 
abatacept 30/10 mg/kg group, 40 in abatacept 10/10 mg/kg group, 45 in abatacept 3/3 mg/kg group, 
and 42 in placebo group). 
The 147 subjects who completed the ST period and received at least 1 infusion of open-label abatacept in 
the LT period comprise the All Treated Subjects in LT Period population. 
The All Abatacept-treated Subjects population was composed of the 161 subjects who received at least 1 
infusion of abatacept in the ST and/or LT period (includes 33 subjects who received abatacept only in LT 
period [i.e., received placebo in ST period]). 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Overall, the portion of PsA subjects with ACR 20 response rate at Day 169 (primary efficacy endpoint) was 
similar for abatacept 30/10 and abatacept 10/10 treatment groups, and the ACR 20 response rate for 
both of these abatacept groups was significantly higher in comparison to the placebo group (see Table 
21). The response rate for abatacept 3/3 treatment group was not significantly higher in comparison to 
the placebo group. 
Table 21 - Proportion of Subjects with ACR 20 Response Rate at Day 169  – All Randomized 
and Treated Subjects 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The proportion of subjects with IGA response of clear or almost clear at Day 169 was highest for 
abatacept 3/3 mg/kg group in comparison to similar lower rates for the abatacept 30/10 mg/kg, 
abatacept 10/10 mg/kg, and placebo groups (see Table 22).

Table  22  -  Proportion  of  Subjects  with  IGA  Response  at  Day  169  –  All  Randomized  and 
Treated Subjects 
The adjusted mean percentage improvement from baseline at Day 169 (LOCF) in the target lesion score 
was notably higher in each of the 3 abatacept treatment groups compared with the placebo group, with 
the largest adjusted difference from placebo observed for the abatacept 3/3 mg/kg group relative to the 
abatacept 30/10 mg/kg (18.77%) and abatacept 10/10 mg/kg (22.34%) groups (see Table 23).  
Table 23 - Adjusted Mean Percent Improvement from Baseline in Target Lesion Score at Day 
169 (LOCF) – All Randomized and Treated Subjects 
Improvements of > 3 points in the SF-36 PCS and MCS scores are considered clinically relevant in patients 
with RA. Subjects treated with abatacept (all 3 treatment groups) demonstrated greater improvement at 
Day 169 in the physical component of SF-36 in comparison to subjects treated with placebo. The 95% CIs 
for each of the adjusted differences from placebo in the abatacept groups did not contain zero.  Although 
the adjusted mean improvements from baseline at Day 169 in the mental component of the SF-36 was 
larger for all 3 abatacept groups compared with placebo, the adjusted differences from placebo were 
modest, and all 95% CIs for the adjusted differences contained zero (see Table 24). 
Table  24  -  Adjusted  Mean  Change  from  Baseline  at  Day  169  (LOCF)  in  Physical  and  Mental 
Component Scores of SF-36 - All Randomized and Treated Subjects 
The proportion of subjects with an improvement in physical function at Day 169, defined as at least a 0.3 
unit improvement from baseline in the HAQ-DI score, was higher for all 3 abatacept groups than for the 
placebo group (see Table 25).

Changes from baseline (mean and median) in MRI results for erosion, edema, synovitis, dactylitis, and 
enthesitis at Day 169 are summarized by treatment group in Table 26. Mean baseline MRI scores were 
consistently larger for the abatacept 10/10 mg/kg group. 
Mean changes from baseline in erosion scores at Day 169 were smaller in all 3 abatacept groups 
compared with the placebo group. Mean reductions from baseline at Day 169 in synovitis, edema, and 
enthesitis, as assessed by MRI, were also observed in all 3 abatacept groups compared with mean 
increases in the placebo group.

Randomized and Treated Subjects 
Exploratory analyses of the ACR 20 and ACR 50 response rates at Day 169 as a function of prior exposure 
to a TNFα blocker(s) were conducted. Table 27 presents the results of these analyses. Results showed 
separation from placebo for all 3 abatacept groups among subjects who had prior exposure to an 
anti-TNFα as well as for those who were anti-TNFα naïve.

LT period / Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The improvements in ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 rates that were evident in the abatacept 30/10 and 
10/10 mg/kg groups at the end of the ST period were at least maintained during continued treatment with 
abatacept 10 mg/kg in the LT period for up to Day 897 (∼ Month 30 of study). ACR 20 rates at Days 169 
(end of ST period), 365, and 729 were 48.6% (18/37), 50% (17/34), and 81.0% (17/21), respectively, 
in the ST abatacept 30/10 mg/kg group and 55.9% (19/34), 62.1% (18/29), and 66.7% (12/18), 
respectively, in the ST abatacept 10/10 mg/kg group. 
ACR 20, ACR 50, and ACR 70 rates for subjects in the ST placebo and abatacept 3/3 mg/kg cohorts tended 
to increase when these subjects were switched to treatment with abatacept 10 mg/kg during the LT 
period. ACR 20 rates at Days 169 (end of ST period), 365, and 729 were 24.2% (8/33), 46.9% (15/32), 
and 72.2% (13/18), respectively, in the ST placebo cohort and 34.9% (15/43), 61.1% (22/36), and 
65.4% (17/26), respectively, in the ST abatacept 3/3 mg/kg cohort.

Following initiation of treatment with abatacept 10 mg/kg in the LT period, subjects who had been treated 
with placebo in the ST period showed larger (i.e., improvements) mean percentage changes from 
baseline in the target lesion score, with values of 33.82% (± SE of 7.52) at Day 365 and 34.41% (± 8.98) 
at Day 729 compared with 14.80% at Day 169. While the mean percentage change from baseline in 
target lesion score continued to improve in the abatacept 10/10 mg/kg and was maintained in the 
abatacept 30/10 mg/kg groups, it worsened in the abatacept 3/3 mg/kg group. 
The mean improvements at Day 169 in the physical component of SF-36 observed in the 3 abatacept 
groups were at least maintained during treatment with abatacept 10 mg/kg in the LT period. The mean 
(SE) improvement in the SF-36 PCS score at Days 169, 365, and 729 for the All Treated Subjects in LT 
Period by ST randomized treatment cohort were:

2.4.2.  Main studies 
A Phase 3 Randomized Placebo Controlled Study to Evaluate the Efficacy and Safety of 
Abatacept Subcutaneous Injection in Adults with Active Psoriatic Arthritis (Study IM101332) 
Methods 
This was a 24-week (169 days), Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, multicenter 
study, followed by a 28-week (196 days) Open label Period and a 52-week Long Term Extension in 
subjects with 1) active PsA based on the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic Arthritis (CASPAR) and 2) 
active psoriasis defined as having at least one lesion of psoriasis (at least ≥ 2 cm in diameter). 
Subjects were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to 125 mg SC weekly of abatacept or placebo, including subjects 
with and without prior TNFi exposure. Randomization was stratified globally by current methotrexate 
(MTX) use, prior use of TNFi therapy, and for psoriasis involving ≥ 3% of the skin body surface area 
(BSA). Up to approximately 40% of subjects with < 3% BSA psoriatic skin involvement were planned to 
be randomized. 
On Day 113, subjects who had not achieved a ≥ 20% improvement from baseline (Day 1) in their swollen 
and tender joint counts were considered treatment failures, removed from their blinded treatment arm, 
and transitioned to the Early Escape arm in which they received open-label weekly SC abatacept 125 mg. 
At Day 169, all subjects transitioned to the Open-label Period and received abatacept 125 mg SC weekly. 
At the end of the OL Period, subjects had the option of entering a 1-year, Long-term Extension Period 
during which only safety data was collected (see Figure 22).

Treatments 
During the first 6 months (blinded period), subjects received either abatacept 125 mg SC or placebo SC 
once per week according to the dosing schedule. 
On Day 113, subjects who did not achieve a ≥ 20% improvement from baseline in their swollen and 
tender joint counts were considered treatment failures and removed from their blinded treatment arm 
and transitioned to "Early Escape" treatment with open-label weekly abatacept 125 mg SC. At Day 169, 
all subjects received abatacept 125 mg SC weekly.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was proportion of ACR 20 responders at Day 169. 
Key secondary endpoints at Day 169, in hierarchical order: Proportion of HAQ responders (a reduction of 
at least 0.35 from baseline), proportion of ACR 20 responders in the TNFi-naive subpopulation, proportion 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 65/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
of ACR 20 responders in the TNFi-exposed subpopulation, and proportion of x-ray non-progressors in 
total PsA-modified SHS (defined as a change from baseline in total PsA-modified SHS ≤0). 
Other secondary endpoints at Day 169: Proportion of subjects achieving a PASI 50 in subjects with 
baseline BSA ≥ 3%; proportions of ACR 50 and ACR 70 responders. 
Exploratory endpoints at Day 169: Proportion of subjects with Minimal Disease Activity (MDA), Disease 
Activity Score 28-C-reactive protein (DAS28-CRP) remission (defined as DAS28-CRP < 2.6 ), and 
DAS28-CRP low disease activity score (LDAS; defined as DAS28-CRP ≤ 3.2); proportion of subjects 
achieving a target lesion improvement of 50% (TL 50); mean change from baseline in DLQI (Dermatology 
Life Quality Index), Nail-VAS (scale for nail disease), BASDAI (Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease 
Activity Index), mCPDAI and PASDAS (modified Composite Psoriatic Disease Activity Index and Psoriatic 
Arthritis Disease Activity Score, composite measures of PsA), LEI (Leeds Enthesitis Index), and LDI-Basic 
(Leeds Dactylitis Index); and SF-36 (short-form-36 of mental and physical function including Mental 
Component Summary [MCS] and Physical Component Summary [PCS]). 
Day 365 (Year 1/Open-label [OL] Day 197) efficacy assessments were exploratory objectives (Clinical 
Study Report Addendum 01 for Study IM101332). 
Sample size 
A total of 400 randomized subjects (200 per arm) were determined to yield > 99% power to detect a 
treatment effect in ACR 20 responder rate between the abatacept arm (41%) and the placebo arm (18%) 
at Day 169 at the 5% significance level. The sample size determination was done in such a way that the 
power was at least 80% for each of the endpoints included in the hierarchical testing procedure, and for 
the skin endpoint, PASI 50. 
Randomisation 
Randomization was stratified globally by current MTX use, prior use of TNFi therapy, and psoriasis 
involving ≥ 3% of the skin body surface area (BSA). Up to approximately 40% of subjects with < 3% BSA 
psoriatic skin involvement were planned to be randomized. 
Blinding (masking) 
Abatacept for injection was supplied as pre-filled, ready-to-use, glass syringes each containing 125-mg of 
abatacept per syringe (125 mg/mL). Placebo matching abatacept was also supplied as pre-filled, 
ready-to-use glass syringes. 
Statistical methods 
All efficacy analyses were performed using the intent-to-treat (ITT) analysis population, except if stated 
otherwise. Formal statistical testing (using the Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi-Squared test) was 
conducted for the primary and the key secondary efficacy endpoints. A hierarchical approach for 
statistical testing was performed for the key secondary endpoints. This procedure allowed for preserving 
of the overall Type I error rate of 0.05 for the study. 
P-values were presented for each of these endpoints. However, endpoints were not significant if they had 
a rank lower than that endpoint whose null hypothesis was the first that could not be rejected at the 5% 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 66/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
significance level. Thus, any relevant measures that were below a measure that was not significant in the 
hierarchy were presented with nominal p-values. 
The following imputation for all binary responder analyses of the double-blind ST Period was applied: 1) 
Early Escape subjects were imputed as non-responders at Days 141 and 169 for all binary responder 
analyses (for the radiographic analysis, Early Escape subjects were imputed as progressors at Day 169); 
2) for subjects who discontinued the trial during the ST Period after receiving study medication, missing 
data was imputed as a non-responder at all scheduled protocol visits subsequent to the point of 
discontinuation up to Day 169 (for the radiographic analysis, a progressor imputation was applied). The 
above imputation method was used for the primary analyses of all binary response variables. For the 
most important binary response variables, additional analyses were provided with Days 141 and 169 for 
subjects designated Early Escape imputed using the observed data from Open-label Day 29 and Day 57. 
For the longitudinal repeated measures analyses of the continuous variables during the double-blind ST 
Period, the measurements for the Early Escape subjects were set to missing at Days 141 and 169. For the 
key continuous variables, additional analyses were provided with Days 141 and 169 for subjects 
designated Early Escape imputed using the observed data from Open-label Day 29 and Day 57. 
Results 
Participant flow 
ST Period 
Among the 489 subjects enrolled in the study, 424 were randomly assigned to treatment. The primary 
reasons that enrolled subjects were not randomized (65/489, 13%) were failure to meet study criteria 
(45 subjects, 9%) and withdrawal of consent (15 subjects, 3%). 
All 424 (abatacept n = 213; placebo n = 211) randomized subjects received at least 1 dose of 
double-blind study drug in the Treatment Period. Overall, 76/213 (35.7%) of subjects in the abatacept 
group and 89/211 (42.2%) of subjects in the placebo group were designated as Early Escape; these 
subjects left the double-blind treatment period and transitioned to the OL Period at Day 113. These 
subjects are listed under ‘Discontinued due to Lack of Efficacy’. Overall, 52.6% of subjects completed the 
6-month, double blind ST Period (see Table 28). 
Additional 5 and 12 subjects in the abatacept and placebo groups, respectively, discontinued the study 
during the double-blind period due to lack of efficacy. Four subjects discontinued the study during the ST 
Period due to an AE (1 in the abatacept group and 3 in the placebo group). One additional subject in each 
group completed the ST Period but did not enter the Open-label Period due to reported lack of efficacy; 2 
additional subjects in the abatacept group and 1 subject in the placebo group completed the ST Period but 
were not treated in the Open-label Period due to an AE.

Table 28 - Subject Disposition - Reasons for Discontinuation during the Short-term Period - 
ITT Population 
Open-label period (Clinical Study Report Addendum 01 for Study IM101332) 
Overall, 382 subjects entered the OL Period (abatacept, N = 197; placebo, N = 185; see Table 29). 
Overall, 14.4% of subjects discontinued the OL Period (16.2% of subjects in the abatacept group and 
12.4% of subjects in the placebo group); most subjects discontinued the period due to lack of efficacy. In 
addition, 17 (4.5%) subjects who completed the OL Period were not treated in the LTE Period. Overall, 
162 subjects (abatacept, N = 74; placebo, N = 88) who entered the OL Period were Early Escape subjects. 
Of these subjects, 24.3% and 14.8% of subjects, respectively, discontinued the period, most due to lack 
of efficacy. 
At the time of the 1-year database lock, the LTE Population consisted of 310 subjects (abatacept, N = 
153; placebo, N = 157); 12 (7.8%) and 14 (8.9%) subjects, respectively, discontinued this period.

Clinical Study Report Addendum 01: Study Completion Date: 22-Apr-2016 (database lock). 
Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
There were 177 significant protocol deviations in 132 subjects as of the date of database lock; 34 of the 
significant deviations were also relevant deviations. 
Relevant deviations were considered to have the potential to affect the primary analysis and therefore, 
were considered relevant only for the ST Period (first 6 months of treatment). 39 subjects had relevant 
protocol deviations, including 19 (9%) subjects in the abatacept group and 20 (9%) subjects in the 
placebo group. The most common relevant protocol deviation in the abatacept group was need for 
washout due to subjects receiving TNFi therapy within 8 weeks of randomization (4.2%), and in the 
placebo group was subjects meeting criteria for Early Escape, but were not assessed as such by the 
investigator, resulting in the subject not entering the Open-label Period at Day 113 (2.8%). 
Changes in the Conduct of the Study 
There were 9 amendments to the protocol. There were no changes to the planned analysis. Post hoc 
analyses were performed to further describe specific treatment effects. 
Baseline data 
The 2 treatment groups were balanced with respect to demographic characteristics at entry into the ST 
Period (see Table 30; includes also data for Study IM010332). The overall mean age was 50.4 years 
(range: 22 to 81 years), 55% of subjects were female, and most subjects were White (92.7%). A total of 
20% of subjects were from sites in North America, 26% from Europe, and 41% from South America, 13% 
from the Rest of the World (ROW).

Table  30  -  Baseline  Disease  Characteristics,  Study  IM101332  (ITT  Population)  and  Study 
IM101158 (All Randomized and Treated Subjects) 
In subjects who had prior TNFi exposure, 60% (80/129) and 62% (81/130) of TNFi-exposed subjects in 
the abatacept and placebo groups, respectively, were documented as having failed at least one TNFi due 
to inadequate efficacy. Additionally, 16.5% (35/129) and 18.0% (38/130) of TNFi-exposed subjects in 
the abatacept and placebo groups, respectively, were exposed to more than 1 prior TNFi therapy.

Concomitant Therapy 
The most frequently reported concomitant anti-rheumatic medications (NSAIDs and DMARDs) were 
taken by similar proportions of subjects in the abatacept and placebo groups at baseline and during the 
ST Period up to the last dose (see Table 32). The mean daily dose of MTX was similar to baseline during 
the ST Period for both treatment groups. 2 subjects in the abatacept group were reported as having taken 
concomitant etanercept and 1 subject in the placebo group received concomitant tocilizumab. The 
Sponsor confirmed with the investigational centres that the 3 subjects terminated biologic treatment prior 
to first dose of study drug in accordance with protocol-specified washout periods, but no stop dates had 
been recorded in the CRFs. 
Overall, few patients received rescue medication during the ST Period. The number of patients receiving 
systemic steroids (oral), localized steroids (IM, IA, entheseal), or topical steroids was higher in the 
placebo group compared to the abatacept group.

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
The primary endpoint for the ITT analysis population was the proportion of ACR 20 responders at Day 
169, which was statistically superior for the abatacept group compared to the placebo group (see Table 
35). A significantly higher proportion of subjects in the abatacept group, compared to the placebo group, 
met the criteria for ACR 20 response at Day 169.

ACR 20 Response Over Time in the Short-term Period: Figure 23 presents ACR 20 response rate over time 
for the ITT Population, and shows the primary analysis in which the Early Escape subjects are imputed as 
non-responders at Days 141 and 169 for ACR 20. Figure 24 shows the primary analysis with the 
superimposed additional analysis in which ACR 20 responses for Early Escape subjects at Day 141 and 
Day 169 are calculated based on the observed values at Open-label Days 29 and 57. The analysis showed 
a numeric improvement in the placebo group after early Early Escape subjects had transitioned to 
abatacept, and continued improvement in the abatacept group at Days 141 and 169.

ACR 20 Responses at Day 169 by Subgroups:  In both treatment groups, the proportion of subjects with 
an ACR 20 response was numerically higher in subgroups that used MTX, non-biological DMARDs, and 
corticosteroids at baseline compared to subjects who did not report use of these agents at baseline (see 
Table 36).

Population 
Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
Key secondary endpoints are presented in Table 37 in hierarchical order (Day 169). Because the 
treatment difference for HAQ response rate was not significant at the 5% significance level, treatment 
differences for endpoints lower in the testing hierarchy (ie, ACR 20 response rate at Day 169 in the 
TNFi-naive and TNFi-exposed cohorts and x-ray non-progressor rate at Day 169) could not be tested for 
significance. Thus, for these endpoints, nominal p-values are provided. 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 74/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 37 - Summary of Key Secondary Endpoints 
Although the proportion of subjects with HAQ response (decrease of at least 0.35 from baseline) at Day 
169 was numerically higher in the abatacept group than the placebo group, the difference between the 
abatacept and placebo groups was not significant (see above Table 37). Figure 25 shows a) the analysis 
for which the Early Escape subjects are imputed as non-responders at Days 141 and 169 and b) the 
additional analysis for which HAQ scores for Early Escape subjects at Day 141 and Day 169 are calculated 
based on the observed values at Open-label Days 29 and 57. The analysis showed numeric improvement 
in the placebo group after Early Escape subjects had transitioned to abatacept, and continued 
improvement in the abatacept group. 
The adjusted mean change from baseline in the HAQ-DI was numerically greater in the abatacept group 
vs the placebo group in both the TNFi-naive and the TNFi-exposed populations at Day 169 and at the 
majority of assessment time points.

Figure 25 - HAQ Response Over Time During Short-term Period - ITT Population 
ACR 20 Responders in the TNFi-naive and TNFi-exposed Subpopulations: A higher proportion of subjects 
in the abatacept group, compared to the placebo group, met the ACR 20 criteria for responders at Day 
169 in both the TNFi-naive and TNFi-exposed subpopulations (see above Table 37). 
Non-progression in Total SHS: The proportion of radiographic non-progressors in total PsA-Modified 
Sharp van der Heijde score (SHS) at Day 169 in the ITT Population was greater in the abatacept group 
than in the placebo group, with a nominal p-value of 0.034 (see above Table 37). The proportion of 
radiographic non-progressors in erosion and JSN scores at Day 169 in the ITT Population was numerically 
greater in the abatacept group than in the placebo group (see Table 38). The adjusted mean change from 
baseline in the total SHS was slightly higher in the abatacept group vs the placebo group at Day 169 (0.48 
vs. 0.36). 
Table 38 - Proportion of Radiographic Non-Progressors in Erosion and Joint Space Narrowing 
Score at Day 169 - ITT Population 
Other Secondary endpoints 
A greater proportion of subjects in the abatacept group vs the placebo group achieved at least 50% 
improvement in PASI (PASI 50) scores at Day 169 (see Table 39). The proportion of subjects who 
achieved at least 50% improvement in the PASI was greater in the abatacept vs the placebo group at 
each time point. As with the ACR 20 and HAQ results, when the observed data from Open-label days 29 
and 57 was used for Study Days 141 and 169 for the Early Escape subjects, improvement in the PASI 50 
EMA/455579/2017

was seen in the placebo group after switching to abatacept, and continued benefit was also seen in the 
abatacept group. 
Table  39  -  Proportion  of  Subjects  (with  BSA>=3%)  Achieving  PASI  50  at  Day  169  -  ITT 
Population 
A numerically higher proportion of subjects in the abatacept group, compared to the placebo group, met 
the criteria for an ACR 50 response at Day 169 (19.2% vs. 12.3% when Early Escape/missing subject 
data was imputed as non-responders). The corresponding rates for ACR 70 response at Day 169 were 
10.3% vs. 6.6%, respectively (see Table 40 and Table 41).

multinational,  multi-center,  double-blind,  multiple  dose  level,  placebo-controlled 
phase IIB study. 
Design 
The study consisted of 2 study periods: a 6-month double-blind, placebo-controlled 
short-term (ST) period and an open-label long-term (LT) extension period for subjects 
who completed the ST period. The primary objective of the short-term period was to 
compare  the  efficacy  of  3  regimens  of  abatacept  versus  placebo  in  a  6-month 
double-blind study of PsA, as measured by the proportion of subjects achieving an ACR 
20 response at Day 169. The primary objective of the long-term period was to assess 
the  safety  and  tolerability  of  abatacept  treatment  during  the  open-label  extension 
phase (18 months after the initial 6-month, double-blind period). The long-term period 
of the study was prematurely terminated due to the modest efficacy on skin-related 
parameters.  
Only the efficacy results of the ST period are presented in this table.

The study included three phases: 24-week (169 days) double-blind, placebo controlled 
period, followed by a 28-week (196 days) Open label Period and a 52-week Long Term 
Extension in subjects with 1) active PsA based on the Classification Criteria for Psoriatic 
Arthritis  (CASPAR)  and  2)  active  psoriasis  defined  as  having  at  least  one  lesion  of 
psoriasis (at least ≥ 2 cm in diameter). On Day 113, subjects who had not achieved a 
≥ 20% improvement from baseline (Day 1) in their swollen and tender joint counts 
were considered treatment failures, removed from their blinded treatment arm, and 
transitioned  to  the  Early  Escape  arm  in  which  they  received  Open-label  weekly  SC 
abatacept 125 mg. At Day 169, all subjects transitioned to the Open-label Period and 
received abatacept 125 mg SC weekly. At the end of Open-label Period, subjects had 
the  option  of  entering  a  one-year,  Long-term  Extension  Period  for the  collection  of 
safety data only. 
Only the 24 weeks (169 days) efficacy results are presented in this table.

Notes: 
1 Early Escape subjects switching to open-label abatacept at Day 113 and other subjects 
with missing data at Day 169 of the double-blind period were imputed as non-responders. 
2 Key secondary endpoints were tested in the following hierarchical order, at Day 169:  
1) proportion of HAQ responders,  
2) proportion of ACR 20 responders in the TNFi-naïve sub-population,  
3) proportion of ACR 20 responders in TNF-exposed sub-population,  
4) radiographic non-progressor rates as described by the total PsA-modified SHS. Because the treatment 
difference for HAQ response rate was not significant at the 5% significance level, treatment differences for 
endpoints  lower  in  the  testing  hierarchy  (ie,  ACR  20  response  rate  at  Day  169  in  the  TNFi-naive  and 
TNFi-exposed cohorts and x-ray non-progressor rate at Day 169) could not be tested at the 5% significance 
level preserving the type I error. Thus, for these endpoints, nominal p-values and summary statistics are 
provided. 
3 Estimate and 95% CI for difference is based on stratum size weights method with stratification 
by MTX use, prior TNFi and BSA. 
4 P-value is based on the CMH Chi-square test stratified by MTX use, prior TNFi and BSA.

8 P-value is based on the CMH Chi-square test stratified by MTX use and prior TNF. 
9 For Early Escape Subjects measurements are set to missing at Day 169. The longitudinal model includes 
the fixed categorical effects of treatment, day, prior TNFi use, MTX use, BSA, day-by-treatment interaction, 
prior  TNF-use-by-day  interaction,  MTX  use-byday  interaction,  BSA-by-day  interaction  as  well  as  the 
continuous  fixed  covariate  of  baseline  score  and  baseline  score-by-day  interaction.  An  unstructured 
covariance matrix is used to represent the correlation of the repeated measures within each subject.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Two clinical studies in PsA were submitted to support this application: a phase 2b study of IV abatacept 
(IM101158) and a pivotal Phase 3 study of SC abatacept (IM101332) 
Based on predicted median trough levels (see Clinical Pharmacology section) and prior experiences from 
RA and psoriasis studies, three IV dose regimens were studied in the Phase 2b study (3 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 
and 10 mg/kg with loading doses of 30 mg/kg on Days 1 and 15). For the phase 3 study, a fixed dose 
approved for RA, i.e., abatacept 125 mg SC weekly was selected, based on comparable exposure 
following administration of 10 mg/kg IV abatacept in RA and PsA patients. The exposure-response 
relationship was extrapolated from RA to PsA. It was clarified that the aim of the initial doses of i.v. 2x30 
mg/kg in the third dose group was to investigate whether higher doses were needed to saturate target 
molecules in PsA. Higher than 30/30/10 mg/kg dose regimens were not investigated.

Study IM101158 
The Phase 2 b Study IM101158 consisted of two study periods: a 6-month double-blind, 
placebo-controlled short term period and an open-label long term extension period of 18 months. The 
study population comprised adult patients who met CASPAR criteria of PsA, with active disease (≥ 3 
swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints), and ≥ 1 psoriatic skin lesion ≥ 2 cm. Patients exhibited prior failure 
of DMARD therapy (lack of efficacy or intolerability). Prior failure of TNFα therapy was also allowed. 
Concomitant treatment with stable dose of MTX, NSAID, oral corticosteroids (≤10 mg daily prednisone 
equivalent) and topical corticosteroids (for groin, face, and/or hands) was permitted. 
Subjects were randomized on Day 1 and received one of the following four treatments by IV infusion 
during the ST period: Abatacept 30/10 mg/kg, abatacept 10/10 mg/kg, abatacept 3/3 mg/kg or Placebo. 
Subjects who entered the LT period received open-label treatment with abatacept at 10 mg/kg beginning 
at Day 169. 
The primary objective was to compare the efficacy of the three regimens of abatacept versus placebo in 
the 6-month double-blind period, as measured by the proportion of subjects achieving an ACR 20 
response at Day 169. Efficacy endpoints included ACR 20 response, IGA response, target lesion score 
(defined as a score of clear or almost clear in all 3 components: Induration, Erythema, Scaling; rating 0-4 
each), physical and mental component score of SF-36, and HAQ response. All these endpoints are 
validated and/or standard endpoints for studies in PsA and psoriasis. Mean changes from baseline in bone 
erosions, bone oedema, synovial volume, dactylitis and enthesitis by MRI was assessed as an exploratory 
endpoint at Day 365 (LT Period). 
The efficacy analyses for the double-blind ST period were performed using the Intent-to-treat (ITT) 
analysis population, and analyses of efficacy and safety endpoints for the LT period were based on the As 
Treated Subjects analysis population. According to the statistical analysis plan, missing scores during the 
ST period were imputed as non-responders for ACR, IGA, HAQ, PASI, and target lesion responses, and 
missing target lesion scores at Day 169 were imputed using a last observation carried forward (LOCF). 
Study IM101332 
The pivotal study IM101332 was a 24-week (169 days), Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, placebo 
controlled, multicentre study, followed by a 28-week (196 days) Open-label Period and a 52-week 
Long-Term Extension. Similar to Study IM101158, the population included patients who met CASPAR 
criteria of PsA, with active disease (≥ 3 swollen joints and ≥ 3 tender joints), and ≥ 1 psoriatic skin lesion 
≥ 2 cm. Patients had a history of inadequate response to at least one non-biologic DMARD and could have 
been treated with TNFi therapy. Those who had failed more than 2 TNFi agents due to inefficacy were 
excluded but there was no limit on the total number of TNFi to which the subject had been exposed.  
Concurrent treatment with stable dose of non-biologic DMARD, NSAID, oral glucocorticoid (doses ≤ 10 
mg/day prednisone), low potency topical corticosteroids (for palms, soles, face and intertriginous areas) 
and systemic retinoid was allowed. One instance of rescue therapy with corticosteroid (oral, IM, IA, 
enthesial injection or topical) was permitted during the ST period. 
Study subjects received either abatacept 125 mg SC or placebo SC once per week during the blinded 
period of the first 6 months. There was an early escape and transition to open-label abatacept treatment 
on Day 113 (Week 16) for those who not who did not achieve a ≥ 20% improvement in their swollen and 
tender joint count. These subjects were considered treatment failures. 
The primary objective of the study was to compare the efficacy of abatacept to placebo as assessed by the 
ACR 20 response at Day 169. The primary endpoint was the proportion of ACR 20 responders at Day 169. 
This is a standard efficacy endpoint in PsA studies and in line with the EMA guidance 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 91/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
(CHMP/EWP/438/04). Proportion of HAQ responders, proportion of ACR 20 responders in the TNFi-naïve 
and the TNFi-exposed subpopulation, and proportion of x-ray non-progressors in total PsA-modified SHS 
were chosen as key secondary endpoints. ACR50 and 70 response, skin specific endpoint PASI 50, and 
physical and mental function subscales of the SF-36 were included as other secondary endpoints. These 
endpoints are validated and widely used for studies in PsA. Exploratory endpoints included composite 
measures of disease activity including CPDAI and PASDAS, and endpoints measuring spinal symptoms, 
enthesitis and dactylitis including BASDAI, LEI and LDI-Basic. Day 365 (Year 1/Open-label [OL] Day 197) 
efficacy assessments were exploratory. 
The planned sample size was 400 randomized subjects (200 per arm). The sample size calculation was 
based on > 99% power to detect a treatment effect in ACR 20 responder rate between the abatacept arm 
(41%) and the placebo arm (18%) at Day 169 at the 5% significance level, and at least 80% for each of 
the endpoints included in the hierarchical testing procedure, and for the skin endpoint PASI 50. Standard 
measures for randomization and blinding were used. Randomization was stratified globally by current 
MTX use, prior use of TNFi therapy, and psoriasis involving ≥ 3% of the BSA. Up to approximately 40% of 
subjects with < 3% BSA psoriatic skin involvement were planned to be randomized.  
Efficacy analyses were performed using the ITT analysis population. Formal statistical testing with 
Cochran-Mantel Haenszel Chi-Squared test was conducted for the primary and the key secondary efficacy 
endpoints using a hierarchical approach, with statistically significance at α= 5%. Early escape subjects 
were imputed as non-responders at Days 141 and 169. Additional analyses were provided using the 
observed data from Open-label Day 29 and Day 57. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Study IM101158 
Of the 170 randomized and treated subjects in Study IM101158, 147 subjects completed the ST period, 
each of whom entered the LT period. There were no clinically relevant differences in the proportion of 
subjects discontinued for a specific reason among the treatment groups. Despite the long duration of 6 
months (169 days) of the placebo-controlled phase, 78.6% (33 out of 42) of the placebo-treated patients 
completed the period. In the LT period, 52% of the subjects were discontinued due to premature 
termination of the study (due to modest efficacy on skin-related parameters), and approximately one 
third in each treatment group were discontinued due to lack of efficacy. The mean (SD) number of months 
of exposure among the 147 subjects in the LT Period population was 17.8 (9.09 months). 
The treatment groups were balanced with respect to demographic characteristics and baseline disease 
characteristics. Most subjects were from North America (57.1%) or Europe (30.6%). The mean tender 
and swollen joint count at baseline was 22.2 and 10.9, respectively. 49% of the study population had BSA 
≥ 3%. The mean IGA score was 2.5 (score range from 0=clear to 4=severe) and the mean PASI score 
was 12.6 (median 8.6) overall indicating mild or moderate skin disease. The patients had prior failure of 
DMARD therapy due to inefficacy or intolerance. 69.0% to 85.0% of subjects across the four treatment 
groups had a history of MTX use and 21.4% to 27.5% had a history of DMARD therapy other than MTX 
prior to enrolment. Overall, 37.1% had a history of inefficacy or intolerance to anti-TNF biologicals 
(51.2% in abatacept 30/10 mg/kg group; 32.5% in abatacept 10/10 mg/kg group, 35.6% in abatacept 
3/3 mg/kg group, and 28.6% in placebo group). The high number of TNF IR patients in the abatacept 
30/10 mg/kg group may have lead to underestimation of efficacy in this dose group, while the number 
TNF IR patients in the other dose groups was comparable. At enrollment, approximately 60% of subjects 
in each treatment group were receiving MTX, and 19.0% to 27.5% received corticosteroids. 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 92/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The primary efficacy endpoint ACR 20 response rate at Day 169 was similar for abatacept 30/10 mg/kg 
(41.9%) and abatacept 10/10 mg/kg (47.5%) treatment groups and significantly higher in comparison to 
placebo group (19.0%; p = 0.022 and 0.006, respectively).  
Among the secondary efficacy endpoints related to PsA, subjects treated with abatacept demonstrated 
greater improvement at Day 169 in the physical component of SF-36 in comparison to subjects treated 
with placebo, with the highest adjusted differences from placebo of 9.12 in the abatacept 10/10 mg/kg 
group. The 95% CIs for each comparison to placebo did not contain zero. Some improvement was also 
seen in the mental component of SF-36 but all 95% CIs for the adjusted differences contained zero. The 
estimated differences from placebo in the HAQ-DI scores were 16.0%, 26.1%, and 16.6% for the 
abatacept 30/10 mg/kg, 10/10 mg/kg, and 3/3 mg/kg groups, respectively, and for the abatacept 10/10 
mg/kg group the 95% CI did not contain zero. 
The secondary efficacy endpoints related to skin disease (psoriasis) were IGA score and target lesion 
score at Day 169. The results related to these endpoints were inconclusive as neither difference to 
placebo nor dose-response in the abatacept groups was evident. This may partly be related to the choice 
of the endpoints, as some trend in favor of efficacy of abatacept was seen in PASI 50 and PASI 75 
responses (see Analysis performed across trials). The potential effect of the chosen skin-related 
secondary endpoints in Study IM101158 was further discussed and it was concluded that, the endpoints 
and their sensitivity in mild-to-moderate psoriasis may play some role in the skin-related efficacy results.  
Among exploratory efficacy endpoints, changes from baseline in MRI results for erosion, edema, 
synovitis, dactylitis, and enthesitis at Day 169 showed a consistent trend of efficacy of abatacept 
compared to placebo. 
In a post-hoc analysis of ACR 20 and ACR 50 response rates among subjects with prior exposure to TNFi 
and TNFi-naive subjects, lower responses were observed in the TNFi-exposed subgroup, as expected. The 
ACR 20 responses with abatacept 10/10 mg/kg dose in the TNFi-exposed and the TNFi-naive subgroups 
were 30.8% and 55.6%, respectively (for the latter comparison the 95% CI did not overlap with that of 
placebo). The corresponding ACR 50 responses were 15.4% and 29.6%, respectively. In the other dose 
groups there was also a consistent numerical trend in favour of abatacept in both TNFi subgroups. 
However, the 95% CIs were wide and partly overlapping with those of placebo, due to the modest efficacy 
and the small number of subjects in each subgroup. 
During the LT period, all subjects were treated with open-label 10/10 mg/kg abatacept and efficacy data 
are described at Days 365 and 729 (Months 6 and 18 of LT period, i.e., Months 12 and 24 of the study). 
There were a decreasing number of subjects at the later time points due to the premature termination of 
the study due to the modest efficacy on skin-related parameters. Also, one third of subjects discontinued 
due to lack of efficacy. As a result of this high rate of discontinuation due to lack of efficacy and the 
as-observed analysis, the response rates become higher.  The choice of the abatacept 10/10 dose was 
further justified in response to the RSI.  The simulated and the observed probability of ACR 20 versus 
Cminss showed that 125 mg SC weekly and 10 mg/kg IV monthly regimens provide similar ACR 20 
responses. During the LT period, when all subjects received 10 mg/kg IV abatacept, patients initially 
randomized to the abatacept 30/10 and 10/10 groups maintained their ACR 20 responses based on the 
protocol specified as-observed analysis. Similar results were obtained when subjects who discontinued 
due to lack of efficacy were imputed as non-responders. There was no additional benefit of the higher 
abatacept 30/10 dose over the 10/10 dose. It is therefore concluded that abatacept 10/10 mg/kg dose is 
the most optimal one. Results of the skin-related endpoints remained inconclusive. However, subjects 
who had been treated with placebo in the ST period showed some improvement in both joint- and 
skin-related efficacy endpoints following switch to the abatacept 10/10 mg/kg dose. 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 93/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Taken together, based on Study IM101158, IV abatacept has modest efficacy in PsA. Among the doses 
tested, abatacept 10/10 mg/kg dose that is approved for the treatment of RA was the most effective. The 
results of the skin-related endpoints IGA and target lesion score assessed as key secondary efficacy 
endpoints showed no relevant difference to placebo and no dose-response.  
Study IM101332 
In Study IM101332, 424 subjects were randomized (abatacept n = 213 and placebo n = 211) and 
received at least one dose of double-blind study drug. 76 (35.7%) of subjects in the abatacept group and 
89 (42.2%) of subjects in the placebo group were designated as Early Escape and transitioned to the OL 
Period at Day 113. Overall, 81 (38.0%) of subjects in the abatacept group discontinued due to lack of 
efficacy during the Short-term Period which is a high rate of non-responders for an active treatment arm. 
The vast majority of those withdrawn due to inefficacy showed lack of joint improvement (lack of joint or 
lack of joint+ skin efficacy).  
These patients were imputed as non-responders in the efficacy analysis. 382 subjects entered the OL 
Period (abatacept n = 197 and placebo n = 185). 14.4% of subjects discontinued the OL Period, most of 
whom due to the lack of efficacy (9.6% of subjects in the abatacept group and 5.4% of subjects in the 
placebo group). 
Baseline disease characteristics were similar between the treatment groups. Among stratification factors, 
overall, 60% of subjects were currently using MTX, 61% of subjects had previous exposure to TNFi, and 
31% of subjects had < 3% BSA psoriatic skin involvement. Prior and concomitant anti-rheumatic therapy 
was similar in both groups and baseline MTX dose was 17.1 mg weekly. The mean tender and swollen 
joint count at baseline was 20.2 and 11.6, respectively, and the mean PASI score was 7.3 (median 4.5) 
indicating mild psoriasis. 
129 (60.6%) subjects in the abatacept group and 130 (61.6%) subjects in the placebo group had prior 
TNFi therapy. 16.5% and 18.0% of the TNFi-exposed subjects, respectively, were exposed to more than 
one prior TNFi therapy. Subjects must have had inadequate response to non-biologic DMARD and despite 
this, 60% of patients were maintained on MTX. The reasons are unclear. 60% of subjects had been 
previously exposed to biologic DMARD, 40% were biologics-naïve. A substantial proportion of patients 
who failed to TNFi therapy (18% -aba, 20%-pbo) had failure for unknown reasons. According to CSR, 
almost all subjects received prior non biologic DMARD (98%), the vast majority received MTX (91-94%) 
and 13-19% received leflunomide. Other non-biologic DMARD exposure was negligible. 
Significantly higher proportion of subjects in the abatacept group compared to the placebo group met the 
ACR 20 response criteria at Day 169 (39.4% vs. 22.3%, respectively, p <0.001). Among subgroups 
analyses, the proportion of subjects with an ACR 20 response was numerically higher in patients who used 
MTX or non-biological DMARD at baseline. In patients with MTX use at Day 1, 44.2% achieved ACR 20 
response versus 32.1% of those with no MTX use at baseline. 
Among the key secondary endpoints, the proportion of HAQ responders was numerically higher in the 
abatacept group compared to the placebo group but was not statistically significant (31.0% vs. 23.7%, 
respectively, p=0.097). Since the analysis of HAQ-response showed statistically non-significant result, 
treatment differences for endpoints lower in the testing hierarchy (i.e., ACR 20 response rate at Day 169 
in the TNFi-naive and the TNFi-exposed cohorts and x-ray non-progressor rate at Day 169) could not be 
tested for significance. Consequently, statistical claims for the presented nominal p-values cannot be 
made. 
Higher proportion of subjects in the abatacept group met the ACR 20 response criteria at Day 169 in both 
the TNFi-naive and TNFi-exposed subpopulations (44.0% and 36.4%, respectively) compared to the 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 94/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
placebo group (22.2% and 22.3%, respectively; nominal p-values 0.003 and 0.012, respectively; and the 
95% CIs for the estimates of difference did not contain zero).  
There was also a higher proportion of radiographic non-progressors at Day 169 in the abatacept group 
compared to the placebo group (42.7% vs. 32.7%; nominal p-value=0.034; the 95% CI for the estimate 
of difference did not contain zero). However, the adjusted mean change from baseline in the total SHS 
was slightly higher in the abatacept group compared to the placebo group at Day 169 (0.48 vs. 0.36). The 
mean change was overall low (< 0.5, i.e., below the minimal clinically important difference) and the 95% 
CIs of mean change were overlapping (abatacept 0.48 [0.15, 0.81]; placebo 0.36 [-0.03, 0.75]). Also, 
the median change from baseline was numerically lower in the abatacept group (0.04) than in the placebo 
group (0.15). Following longer treatment duration of 1 year, the mean changes from baseline in the 
abatacept group were numerically lower both at Day 169 (0.30) and Day 365 (0.18), compared to the 
placebo / placebo-abatacept group (Day 169: 0.35 and Day 365: 0.30). 
6 months is a relatively short period to assess progression of structural damage in PsA and the results are 
confounded by the placebo-treated subjects who escaped to the active drug. However, based on the data 
available up to one year, it can be concluded that abatacept treatment has a beneficial effect on joint 
structure. 
Among the other secondary endpoints, 26.7% of the abatacept-treated subjects achieved PASI 50 at Day 
169 compared to 19.6% of the placebo-treated subjects (p-value=0.137). This outcome was neither 
clinically nor statistically significant. Higher proportion of abatacept-treated patients met the ACR 50 
response criteria compared to the placebo group (19.2% vs. 12.3%, respectively). There was also a trend 
of better efficacy of abatacept regarding ACR 70 response at Day 169 (10.3% vs. 6.6%, respectively, the 
95% CI for the estimate of difference to placebo however contained zero).   
Comparisons to placebo of ACR 50 and ACR 70 responses by prior TNFi use also showed a trend of better 
efficacy of abatacept but all 95% CIs for the estimates of difference to placebo contained zero. The 
magnitude of effect on skin outcomes is far from the efficacy results of other systemic antipsoriatic agents 
either measured in plaque psoriasis or in PsA-studies. Further, subjects in the abatacept group showed a 
trend of improvement in the physical component of SF-36 while change in the mental component of SF-36 
was similar to the placebo group. Exploratory assessments related to composite measures of disease 
activity (CPDAI and PASDAS), enthesitis, dactylitis and axial symptoms (BASDAI) at Day 169 showed a 
trend of improvement in the abatacept group but with small difference to the placebo group. 
Among the exploratory endpoints up to one year (OL Period), the ACR 20/50/70 and PASI 50/70 
responses were maintained or slightly higher compared to Day 169, and similar between the aba/aba and 
the placebo/aba groups. The proportion of radiographic non-progressors in total SHS was 52.6% and 
54.5%, respectively, and the adjusted mean change from baseline was 0.18 and 0.30, respectively. 
The effect was more pronounced in the IV study IM101158. This is likely to be due to the small number 
of patients in Study IM101158 leading to large variability, and due to the fact that in the IV study no early 
escape was possible. Also, the patient populations were different in the two studies: Study 1332 included 
around 60% TNFi-IR, while the IV study included less than 40% TNFi-IR subjects. Taking these issues into 
account it can be concluded that IV and SC abatacept have similar and clinically relevant level of efficacy 
in the treatment of PsA. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The phase 2b study of IV abatacept (IM101158) and the pivotal phase 3 study of SC abatacept 
(IM101332) included subjects with PsA and psoriasis. The proportion of subjects exposed to prior TNFi

therapy was 37.1% in Study M101158 and 61.1% in Study IM101332, and 17.2% of the subjects in the 
latter study were exposed to more than one prior TNFi therapy. The proportion of subjects taking MTX at 
baseline was approximately 60% in all treatment groups. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in both studies, as significantly higher proportion of 
abatacept-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects met the ACR 20 response criteria at 
Day 169: 47.5% in the IV abatacept 10/10 mg/kg dose group vs. 19.0% in the placebo-group (p=0.006) 
and 39.4% in the SC abatacept group vs. 22.3% in the placebo-group (p <0.001). Despite having met the 
primary endpoint, the magnitude of effect both in absolute terms and relative to placebo is modest.  
The lack of active control has been appropriately justified by the high proportion of subjects who had 
already failed a TNFi, thereby precluding the use of TNFi as a comparator. Also at the time of initiation of 
the study there were no other approved biological or new non-biological DMARDs.  
Results of the secondary efficacy endpoints related to signs and symptoms of PsA only partially supported 
the primary efficacy analysis. However, in the long term treatment up to one year, the effects of IV and 
SC abatacept were maintained. 
The population, particularly in study IM101332, was rather treatment resistant as 61.1% of subjects had 
previous exposure to TNFi. The efficacy based on ACR 20 response in this subpopulation was 
demonstrated but was lower than in the TNFi-naive population.  
Abatacept is used only in combination with MTX in the treatment of the other approved indications RA and 
JIA. It was explained that subjects in both abatacept studies continued receiving non-biologic DMARDs 
(including MTX) if the investigator believed there was some evidence of efficacy in joints and/or skin 
(partial response) but add-on therapy with another agent was needed. Abatacept monotherapy group 
included subjects who had discontinued non-biologic DMARDs such as MTX due to failure or intolerance 
prior to the trial. The available data suggest that concomitant therapy with non-biologic DMARD, in 
particular with MTX, provides some additional efficacy over monotherapy and the safety of such therapy 
is acceptable. On the other hand, efficacy of abatacept monotherapy is not outstanding but a clear 
difference to placebo can be observed. Therefore, treatment with or without MTX is considered 
acceptable. As such, Orencia can be used either alone or in combination with MTX for the treatment of 
PsA. Data on treatment with or without nbDMARD are too limited to allow such recommendation. 
The mean PASI scores in Studies IM101158 and IM101332 were 12.6 and 7.3 (median scores 8.6 and 
4.5), respectively, indicating mild to moderate psoriasis. There was no clinically relevant effect of 
abatacept on skin symptoms. Confidence intervals overlapped between placebo and abatacept groups in 
PASI50, PASI75 parameters and nail-VAS; suggesting that the numerically better results may be not 
interpreted as real difference (however, the study was not powered for it). Abatacept therapy does also 
not allow concurrent treatment of psoriasis with effective biological products currently available and 
indicated for the treatment of both PsA and psoriasis. Therefore abatacept seems unsuitable for the 
treatment of PsA in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis and patients that require additional 
systemic therapy for psoriasis were excluded from the indication. 
The robustness of the efficacy data and the proposed target population was further justified. Efficacy of 
abatacept by prior and concomitant MTX was sufficiently demonstrated but the data related to the 
treatment with or withour MTX were not fully consistent. ACR 20 responses in the subgroups by prior TNFi 
exposure, with or without MTX, consistently showed improvement relative to placebo, and higher 
response rates in the anti-TNF naïve patients were seen. Again, responder rates by concomitant MTX 
were not consistent. 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 96/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
Finally, with regard to the target population, it is concluded that benefit of IV and SC abatacept has been 
demonstrated in PsA population in both second-line (DMARD-IR) and third-line (TNFi-IR) treatment. The 
efficacy was clinically relevant but rather modest which is partly explained by the relatively slow onset of 
action of abatacept in PsA patients and the design of Study IM101332 with early and stringent escape 
option. 
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Orencia (abatacept) administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) is approved for the 
treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults. Abatacept IV is also approved for the treatment of 
polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. The safety 
profile of abatacept is well established for adults with RA, including long-term follow-up. The safety profile 
is characterised by several potentially serious consequences, including but not limited to the identified 
risk of infections and potential risks of malignancies, autoimmune disorders, local injection site reactions 
and immunogenicity, which were also monitored during the clinical studies in psoriatic arthritis (PsA).  
The safety data for patients with active PsA is derived from 2 clinical studies: IM101332, a pivotal Phase 
3 study of SC abatacept and IM101158, a Phase 2b study of IV abatacept. A total of 594 subjects with 
active PsA were treated in the 2 clinical studies; 341 subjects received abatacept and 253 subjects 
received placebo during the ST period. After the ST period, all subjects received open-label (OL) 
abatacept in order to assess the long term safety of abatacept in subjects with PsA. Study IM101158 was 
terminated prematurely by the MAH due to the modest efficacy in skin-related parameters. Safety data 
are presented separately for each study. No formal comparison of safety data were made between 
treatments or between studies and no formal statistical testing was performed.  
Adverse events are further discussed by categories of AEs that could be associated with the use of 
immunomodulatory drugs. These AEs of special interest include infections, malignancies, autoimmune 
events, injection site reactions [IM101332], infusion reactions [IM101158], and AEs occurring within 24 
hours of study drug administration (IM101332). Autoimmune events, local injection site reactions, acute 
and peri-infusional reactions were pre-specified. 
Patient exposure 
As of 22-Dec-2015, 10,771 subjects have been exposed to abatacept in sponsored clinical trials. The 
cumulative number of patients treated as of 30-Sep-2015 is estimated to be 383,451. 
Study IM101158 
The median duration of exposure to study drug in the ST period was 168 days for each of the treatment 
group and the mean duration of exposure in the ranged from 153.6 to 166.8 days. 
The mean (SD) number of months of exposure among the 147 subjects in the All Treated Subjects in LT 
Period population was 17.8 (9.09 months) and the overall mean duration of exposure for the 161 subjects 
across ST + LT periods was 20.4 (10.74 months) and the mean number (SD) of infusions was 21.3 
(11.03).  
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 97/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Study IM101332 
The mean durations of exposure to abatacept and to placebo were similar. A total of 46% of subjects in 
the abatacept group and 36% of subjects in the placebo group were exposed to study drug for › 141 to 
169 days, and the median days (SD) of exposure was 147.7 days (30.5) and 140.3 days (30.0), 
respectively. 
In the period up to Year 1, the mean duration of exposure to abatacept was 10.8 months in subjects who 
received abatacept during the ST and OL Periods and 6.5 months in subjects who received placebo during 
the ST Period and transitioned to abatacept in the OL Period and the mean number of injections were 43.5 
and 26.0, respectively. According to MAH, the mean number of abatacept injections for each group was 
consistent with the design of this study. Up to Year 2, the mean duration of exposure to abatacept was 
17.0 months for the cumulative abatacept period, and the mean number of injections 63.2. 
Adverse events 
Adverse events were reported in comparable proportions of subjects treated with abatacept and placebo 
during the Short-term Periods in Studies IM101332 and IM101158 (see Table 51). In study IM101132 
during the cumulative abatacept up to Year 1, AEs were reported in 68.6% of subjects and up to Year 2, 
AEs were reported in 78.4% of subjects. In study IM101158, for all abatacept treated population, AEs 
were reported 88.8% of the subjects. Infections were the most common types of AEs reported with 
abatacept therapy and were reported similarly in both abatacept and placebo groups.  
No new or unexpected safety signals were identified with abatacept therapy and the AE profile of 
abatacept administered SC or IV in subjects with PsA was consistent with the AE profile of abatacept 
observed from the clinical experience of abatacept administered SC or IV in subjects with RA.  
The following AEs were considered to be of special interest and are further presented below: infections, 
malignancies, autoimmune events, local site reactions, acute infusion reactions, peri-infusional reactions 
and AEs within 24 h of injection are discussed separately.

Infections 
Study IM101158 
Infections were the most common AEs reported during the ST period.  A similar percentage of subjects in 
each treatment group had an AE in the SOC Infections and Infestations, up to 56 days after the last 
infusion in the ST period or the start of the LT period, whichever occurred first (see Table 52). These 
reported events included bacterial, viral, and fungal infections. Nasopharyngitis was the most frequently 
reported infection in all 4 treatment groups. All reported infection and infestation AEs during the ST period 
were mild or moderate in severity, except for 1 event in the abatacept 30/10 mg/kg group (osteomyelitis, 
very severe).  
The one case of osteomyelitis led to discontinuation of the treatment drug. The subject, a 41-year-old 
female in the abatacept 30/10 mg/kg group, was reported to have osteomyelitis (third digit in the right 
foot) with an onset on Day 64 (same day as Day 57 infusion). The subject was discontinued as a result of 
this SAE, which was assessed by the investigator as very severe and possibly related to study drug. The 
osteomyelitis was ongoing at the time of the data cut-off for the ST period. 
No cases of serious infections or infestations were seen in the placebo group.

Table  52  -  Infections  and  Infestations  Adverse  Events  Reported  During  the  Double-blind 
Period: All treated Subjects 
During the LT period, AEs in the SOC Infections and Infestations were reported in 83 subjects (56.5%) in 
the All Treated Subjects in LT Period population (see Table 53). The most commonly reported infection 
AEs during the LT period were nasopharyngitis (22.4%), upper respiratory tract infection (10.9%), 
bronchitis (8.8%), sinusitis (8.2%), and urinary tract infection (6.8%). One AE was assessed as severe in 
intensity (tooth abscess) and for 5 subjects (3.4%), the reported infection in the LT period was serious 
(including 2 reports of pneumonia and cellulitis, herpes zoster, pyelonephritis acute and sinusitis each 
reported once). For 3 of these subjects, the SAEs were assessed as at least possibly related to study 
treatment (cellulitis, herpes zoster, pyelonephritis acute and pneumonia). None of the SAEs reported 
during the LT period led to discontinuation of abatacept, but one case of infection (localized infection) did.

Table 53 - Infections and Infestations Adverse Events Reported During the Long-term Period 
All Treated Subjects in LT period 
Study IM101332 
Also in Study IM101332 Infections and infestations were the most commonly reported AEs during the ST 
period and were reported in 57 (26.8%) subjects and 63 (29.9%) subjects in abatacept and placebo 
group, respectively (see Table 54). Nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory infections were the most 
common AEs and were reported slightly more often in the placebo group (4.2% and 2.8% in the 
abatacept group, 5.2% and 6.6% in the placebo group, respectively). The only SAE of infection that was 
considered related to study drug was a case of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, which also led to 
discontinuation of the treatment: 
The subject a 59-year old female, who had a medical history of smoking, chronic obstructive pulmonary 
disease, type II diabetes, and coronary artery disease. The treatment was discontinued after 18 
injections of abatacept after the subject was hospitalized for suspected pneumonia and a serious adverse 
event of Grade 2 Pneumocystis jirovecii infection. 
Adverse events reported in at least 2% of subjects and in more subjects in the abatacept vs placebo 
groups included urinary tract infections (4.2% vs 0.9% of subjects), bronchitis (3.3% vs 2.4% of 
subjects), and gastroenteritis (3.3% vs 2.4% of subjects).

Table 54 - Adverse Events Reported During the Short-term Period: As-treated Population 
During The Cumulative Abatacept Period up to Year 1 Infections and Infestations were the predominant 
AEs and were reported for 162 (40.7%) subjects. The most common infections that were reported in ≥ 
5% of subjects included upper respiratory tract infection (7.0%), bronchitis (6.5%), and nasopharyngitis 
(6.3%). Up to Year 2 infections were reported in 181 subjects (45.5%). Upper respiratory infections were 
reported in 33 (8.3%) subjects, bronchitis in 31 (7.8%) subjects, nasopharyngitis in 26 (6.5%) subjects, 
and urinary tract infections in 22 (5.5%) subjects.  
Up to Year 2 AEs of infection were reported in 52.5% the treatment was discontinued due to AEs or SAEs 
of infection in 7 (1.8%) subjects including 3 subjects during the ST period: gastroenteritis, respiratory 
tract infection and Pneumocystis jirovecii infection; during the OL period in one subject due to 
oropharyngeal candidiasis and in 3 subjects during LTE due to hepatitis A, Epstein-Barr virus infection and 
intervertebral discitis.

Serious adverse events of infection were reported in 10 (2.5%) subjects: gastroenteritis (2 subjects) and 
Pneumocystis jirovecii infection during the ST period; appendicitis, Epstein-Barr virus infection, 
pneumonia and pyelonephritis during the OL period; and osteomyelitis, intervertebral discitis and 
cellulitis during the LTE.  
Malignancies 
Study IM10158  
A single malignancy was reported during the ST period: basal cell carcinoma in a subject in the abatacept 
30/10 mg/kg group (see Table 55).  This event occurred in a 66-year-old female subject 
(IM101158-28-152) on Day 124, and was assessed as mild in intensity and possibly related to study drug. 
The subject completed the ST period and continued in the LT period without dose modification. The basal 
cell carcinoma was considered a serious AE, and resolved after 165 days during the LT period.  During the 
LT period malignancies were reported in 2 subjects (1.4%) treated with abatacept. Both of these 
malignancies (Bowen’s disease, lentigo maligna stage unspecified) were assessed as moderate in 
intensity and unlikely or not related to study drug and neither malignancy resulted in discontinuation, and 
both resolved. A third subject was diagnosed with metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue; this 
AE was reported (Day 761) approximately 90 days after the last dose of abatacept in the LT period (Day 
673) and therefore not included to the summary table. The subject (IM101158-2-100) had a history of 
exposure to Agent Orange, a known carcinogen, while a soldier in the Vietnam War. 
Study IM101332  
In placebo group two (2) cases of malignancy were reported; an invasive ductal breast carcinoma and a 
B-cell lymphoma. No malignancies were reported in the abatacept group during the ST period. 
During The Cumulative Abatacept Period malignancies were reported in 4 subjects during the OL period 
(1.0%) including cases of: prostate cancer, a carcinoma in situ of skin, a squamous cell carcinoma of skin 
and a transitional cell carcinoma. The subject with squamous cell carcinoma had a medical history of a 
basal cell carcinoma of the nose. The case of transitional cell carcinoma was considered to be related to 
abatacept therapy by the investigator, other malignancies were considered unrelated. 
Autoimmune Disorders 
Study IM101158  
Autoimmune disorder AEs (prespecified) were reported during the ST period for a total of 4 subjects, 
including 3 subjects (7.5%) in the abatacept 10/10 mg/kg group (severe psoriasis, mild psoriasis and 
moderate psoriatic arthropathy) and 1 subject (2.4%) in the placebo group. Of the 3 cases of 
autoimmune disorders reported in the abatacept groups none were serious and all were related to the 
underlying disease.  
During the LT period Autoimmune disorders (prespecified) AEs of psoriasis were reported for 5 (3.4%) 
subjects. For one subject the AE was assessed as serious. All 5 cases were assessed as unlikely or not 
related to study treatment and related to the underlying disease, and the treatment was continued.  
Study IM101332  
No autoimmune events were reported in either treatment group during the ST period. Of note, unlike in 
study IM101158, the investigators were requested not to report AEs of psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 103/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
unless the event represented a new form of psoriasis or was an SAE. During the ST Period Adverse Events 
of New Psoriasis or SAEs of Psoriasis or Psoriatic Arthropathy (considered by the investigator to be 
unrelated to study drug) were reported in 4 subjects in the placebo group: nail psoriasis (new), psoriasis 
(new inverse psoriasis), and 2 subjects with psoriatic arthropathy (worsening/exacerbation). No cases of 
an AE or SAE of psoriasis were reported in abatacept-treated subjects.  
During The Cumulative Abatacept Period prespecified autoimmune events were reported in 3/398 
subjects: a case of uveitis was reported in 1 subject during the OL Period and coeliac disease and a case 
of hyperthyroidism each in one subject during the LT extension. None of these events was considered 
related to abatacept or led to discontinuation of the treatment. 
Worsening or New Psoriasis or Psoriatic Arthropathy 
Six (6) subjects had AEs or SAEs of psoriasis during the OL Period. The cases included: SAEs of psoriatic 
arthropathy in 2 subjects, an AE of psoriasis, an SAE of psoriasis, an AE of skin plaque and a SAE of 
erythrodermic psoriasis. The two subjects with psoriatic arthopathy continued the treatment, but the four 
(4) subjects with AEs or SAEs of psoriasis discontinued abatacept therapy due to a lack of efficacy. During 
the LTE SAEs of psoriatic arthropathy were reported in 2 subjects. These events did not lead to 
discontinuation of the treatment. 
The subject originally randomized to abatacept treatment, was reported with an AE and also an SAE of 
erythrodermic  psoriasis  during  the  Open-label  Period.  During  the  treatment  with  abatacept,  the 
investigator had noted gradual worsening of psoriasis eventually necessitating the use of topical steroids 
and intramuscular dexamethasone before the subject was discontinued from the treatment due to lack of 
efficacy. A week after (Day 310) the subject had received the last dose of abatacept, the subject  was 
noted to have lesions that were confluent. Her PASI score was 53.8. She also experienced significant 
itching,  pain,  and  chills.  On  Day  331,  in  subject’s  first  follow  up  visit,  upon  examination  90%  of  the 
subject’s body surface was affected by psoriasis. The  subject was hospitalized due to serious adverse 
event  of  Grade  2  erythrodermic  psoriasis  on  the  same  day.  The  subject  received  treatment  with 
cyclosporine.  At  the  time  of  database  lock,  the  event  of  erythrodermic  psoriasis  and  treatment  with 
cyclosporine were ongoing. The investigator considered the event of erythrodermic psoriasis to be related 
to the study therapy. 
Infusional Adverse Events (Prespecified) - Study IM101158 
Acute infusional AEs are a subset of peri-infusional events occurring within 24 hours after the start of 
study drug infusion, and therefore, the percentages are not additive.  Acute infusional AEs (prespecified), 
occurring within 1 hour of infusion, were reported during the ST period in a total of 4 abatacept-treated 
subjects, including 2 (4.7%) in the abatacept 30/10 mg/kg group and 2 (5.0%) in the abatacept 10/10 
mg/kg group and 0 in the  placebo group. These AEs included blood pressure increased (2 events), 
dizziness, dyspnoea and flushing in 30/10 group and infusion related reaction, anaphylactic reaction and 
dizziness in 10/10 group.  One AE was severe (non-serious): a 26 year-old female (subject 
IM101158-83-173), in the abatacept 10/10 mg/kg group, experienced a severe anaphylactic reaction 
within 1 hour of the onset of the second infusion of abatacept on Day 15. The subject was discontinued 
from the study. 
During the ST period, 4 subjects (9.3%) in the abatacept 30/10 mg/kg group, 6 subjects (15.0%) in the 
abatacept 10/10 mg/kg group, 3 subjects (6.7%) in the abatacept 3/3 mg/kg group, and 3 subjects 
(7.1%) in the placebo group experienced a peri-infusional AE (prespecified). The majority of AEs were of 
mild to moderate severity and most of these AEs (PTs) were reported by only a single subject across all 
4 treatment groups; those that were reported by more than 1 abatacept-treated subject were headache 
(n = 3), infusion-related reaction (n = 2), BP increased (n = 2), and dizziness (n = 2).

During the LT period acute infusional AEs (prespecified) were reported by 4 (2.7%) treated subjects. 
These cases included 2 reports of infusion-related reaction, and single reports each of pruritus and 
flushing. Peri-infusional AEs, reported within 24 hours after the start of study drug infusion, were 
reported by 11 (7.5%) subjects during the LT period. One case of headache was assessed as severe; all 
other cases were mild to moderate in intensity. No peri-infusional AE during the LT period led to 
discontinuation of the study drug. 
Adverse Events within 24 Hours of Study Drug Administration - Study IM101332 
During the ST Period 39 (18.3%) subjects in the abatacept group and 39 (18.5%) subjects in the placebo 
group reported AEs within 24 h of drug administration. The most frequently reported AEs within 24 hours 
were in the SOC of Infections and Infestations: 13 subjects (6.1%, IR: 15.1/100 p-y) in the abatacept 
group and 15 subjects (6.2%; IR: 18.5/100 p-y) in the placebo group. None of these AEs were suggestive 
of systemic drug reactions. 
During the Cumulative abatacept period up to Year 1 94 (23.6%) subjects had an AE within 24 hours of 
abatacept administration. The most frequently reported AEs within 24 hours (≥ 1.0%) were infections 
and included nasopharyngitis (1.3%), urinary tract infection (1.3%), and bronchitis (1.0%). 2 AEs were 
severe in intensity: an AE of renal colic during the double-blind period, and an AE of abdominal pain upper 
during the OL Period. AEs leading to discontinuation were abdominal pain upper and uterine leiomyoma. 
Up to Year 2, 131 (32.9%) subjects had an AE within 24 hours of abatacept administration. Most 
frequently (≥ 1.0%) reported AEs included nasopharyngitis (1.5%), urinary tract infection (1.3%), back 
pain (1.3%), and bronchitis (1.3%), dyslipidemia (1.0%), upper respiratory infection (1.0%), and 
depression (1.0%). Four subjects had AEs within 24 hours during the LTE that were serious; these SAEs 
included dermoid cyst, accidental overdose, abdominal pain upper, and psoriatic arthropathy.  
Local Injection Site Reactions (Pre-specified) - Study IM101332 
Pre-specified local injection site reactions (IR: 1.23/100 p-y), all mild in intensity, were reported in 5/398 
subjects during the cumulative abatacept period up to Year 2: 1 subject with an injection site reaction 
(related to abatacept), 1 subject with 2 episodes of puncture site erythema (both episodes not related to 
abatacept), 1 subject with 3 episodes of injection site erythema (all episodes related to abatacept), and 
1 subject with injection site erythema (related to abatacept). A fifth subject in the original abatacept 
treatment group was reported with 2 episodes of pruritus (related to abatacept). Therapy was not 
discontinued due to these AEs in any of the subjects.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in Study IM101158. Up to year 2 in Study IM101332, no deaths have been 
reported. 
Study IM101158 
During the double-blind period a total of 4 (9.3%), 2 (5%), 0 and 1 (2%) subjects reported SAEs in 
abatacept 30/10 mg/kg, abatacept 10/10 mg/kg, abatacept 3/3 mg/kg and placebo groups, respectively 
(see Table 55). SAEs (6) reported in abatacept-treated subjects were: Cholecystitis acute (SOC 
Hepatobiliary disorders), osteomyelitis and gastroenteritis (SOC Infections and infestations), overdose 
(SOC Injury, poisoning and procedural complications), basal cell carcinoma (SOC Neoplasms benign, 
malignant and unspecified (incl cysts and polyps) and dizziness (SOC Nervous system disorders). Each 
SAE was reported for one subject. In placebo-group one subject was reported with Personality disorder 
and psychiatric decompensation (SOC Psychiatric disorders).

Table 55 - Serious Adverse Events Reported During Double-blind Period – All treated Subjects 
SAEs were reported for a total of 20 (13.6%) and 24 (14.9%) subjects in All Treated Subjects in LT Period 
population and in All Abatacept-Treated Subjects in ST+LT Periods, respectively. 4 SAEs were considered 
related by the investigator during the LT period and 5 in ST + LT Periods. One subject discontinued due 
to an SAE.  
Of the total 24 subjects (14.9%) (see Table 56) with SAEs in SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue 
disorders were reported in 8 (5.0%) subjects including osteoarthritis in 4 subjects (2.5%), arthritis in 2 
subjects (1.2%) and groin pain, intervertebral disc protrusion and psoriatic arthropathy in 1 subject each 
(0.6%). In SOC Infections and infestations SAEs were reported in 6 subjects (3.7%), including   
gastroenteritis in 2 subjects (1.2%), pneumonia in 2 subjects (1.2%) and cellulitis, herpes zoster,  
osteomyelitis, pyelonephritis acute and sinusitis in 1 subject (0.6%) each. SAEs in SOC Cardiac disorders 
were reported in 4 subjects (2.5 %), including atrial fibrillation in 2 subjects (1.2%) and acute coronary 
syndrome, aortic valve incompetence and cardiac failure each in 1 subject (0.6%).  
The SAE of cardiac failure in Subject IM101158-28-122 (ST cohort: abatacept 10/10 mg/kg) was 
assessed as possibly related to treatment. The subject was a 69-year-old female with no reported medical 
history of cardiac disease. Relevant past medications include metoprolol. She developed cardiac failure on 
Day 323, 21 days after the Day 309 scheduled infusion of abatacept in the LT period. The subject was 
treated with furosemide and acetylsalicyclic acid, and the event was considered resolved after 4 days. The 
cardiac failure was assessed by the investigator as moderate in intensity and possibly related to study 
drug. The subject remained in the study and was subsequently discontinued on Day 812 due to 
administrative reasons by the sponsor (i.e., study termination).  
In SOC Injury, poisoning and procedural complications 3 SAEs were reported in a total of 3 subjects 
(1.9%) including humerus fracture, overdose and tendon rupture in 1 subject each (0.6%). In SOC 
Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified (incl. cysts and polyps) 3 SAEs were reported in two 
subjects: basal cell carcinoma, Bowen´s disease, lentigo maligna stage unspecified. SAEs in SOC Nervous 
system disorders were reported in 2 subjects (1.2%), including dizziness and migraine for one subject 
(0.6%) each. In SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders, SAEs were reported in 2 subjects 
(1.2%), including apnoe and asthma for 1 subject (0.6%) each.  Additionally in SOC Gastrointestinal 
disorders, gastritis was reported for one subject (0.6%); in SOC Hepatobiliary disorders, cholecystitis

acute for 1 subject (0.6%); in SOC Immune system disorders, anaphylactic reaction for 1 subject (0.6%). 
Additionally in SOC Metabolism and nutrition disorders, dehydration was reported for 1 subject (0.6%); 
in SOC Psychiatric disorders, personality disorder for one subject (0.6%), in SOC renal and urinary 
disorders, urinary retention for one subject (0.6%), in SOC Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders, 
psoriasis for one subject (0.6%) and in SOC Social circumstances, family stress for one subject (0.6%).  
The SAEs that belong categories of AEs of special interest (infections, malignancies, autoimmune 
disorders and infusion reactions) are discussed separately under section Adverse events.

Study IM101332  
SAEs were reported in 6 (2.8%) subjects in the abatacept group and 9 (4.3%) subjects in the placebo 
group during the ST period (see Table 57). SAEs considered treatment-related were reported in 1 (0.5%) 
subject in each group: Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in the abatacept group and increased ALT in the 
placebo group. Both subjects discontinued the treatment. Discontinuation of treatment due to AEs was 
reported in 1.4% and 1.9% of subjects in the abatacept and placebo groups, respectively. Overall, 3 
subjects in each treatment group discontinued study drug due to SAEs.  
Three (3) subjects (1.4%) in the abatacept group and 2 subjects (0.9%) in the placebo group 
experienced SAEs of infection: in the abatacept group, 2 subjects had gastroenteritis and 1 subject had a 
Pneumocystis jirovecii infection; in the placebo group, 1 subject had appendicitis and 1 subject had 
cellulitis. Two (2) malignancies (0.9%) were reported, both in the placebo group (B-cell lymphoma and 
invasive ductal breast carcinoma). Other serious AEs reported for abatacept-treated subjects included 
each reported in 1 (one) subject: interstitial lung disease and pulmonary embolism (SOC Respiratory, 
thoracic and mediastinal disorders), intervertebral disc protrusion (SOC Musculoskeletal and connective 
tissue disorders) and venous thrombosis (SOC Vascular disorders). In placebo-group SAEs were also 
reported for 1 subject each: acute chest syndrome (SOC Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders), 
psoriatic arthropathy (SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders), peripheral artery 
thrombosis (SOC Vascular disorders), febrile neutropenia (SOC Blood and lymphatic system disorders), 
cholecystitis acute (SOC Hepatobiliary disorders), anaphylactic reaction (SOC Immune system 
disorders), vascular pseudoaneurysm (SOC Injury, poisoning and procedural complications) and alanine 
aminotransferase increased (SOC Investigations).

Table  57  -  Serious  Adverse  Events  Reported  During  the  Short-term  Period  –  As-treated 
Population 
In the Cumulative Abatacept population up Year 1, a total of 34 subjects had SAEs (8.5%), of which 5 
(1.3%) were considered related and 8 (2.0%) led to discontinuation of abatacept. The most common 
types of SAEs were infections (in SOC Infections and infestations) in 7 subjects (1.8%). During the OL 
period 4 subjects (1.3%) had SAEs that were assessed as related: pyelonephritis, dyspnea, 
erythrodermic psoriasis, and transitional cell carcinoma reported in 1 subject each. 5 subjects 
discontinued during the OL Period due to SAEs: a transitional cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, colitis, 
biliary dilatation, and uterine leiomyoma. 
Up to Year 2, SAEs were reported in 49 (12.3%) abatacept-treated subjects. The most common types of 
SAEs were in SOC Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders in 12 subjects (3.0%) and infections 
and infestations in 10 subjects (2.5%) (see Table 58). 10 subjects (2.5%) had SAEs that were considered 
related by the investigator. During the LTE period, the treatment-related SAEs included: osteomyelitis, 
intervertebral discitis, gastric mucosa erythema, accidental overdose, and cellulitis (all reported in 1 
subject each). Up to year 2 SAEs led to discontinuation of abatacept therapy in 9 (2.3%) subjects 
including an SAE of intervertebral discitis reported in 1 subject during the LTE period.

Laboratory findings 
Study IM101158  
During the ST period, the following MAs occurred at ≤ 5% of subjects: low lymphocyte counts: 4.7%, 0%, 
and 13.3% in the abatacept 30/10, 10/10, and 3/3 mg/kg groups, respectively, and 2.4% in the placebo 
group; low serum glucose: 0%, 5.0%, and 8.9% in the abatacept 30/10, 10/10, and 3/3 mg/kg groups, 
respectively, and 0% in the placebo group; high serum glucose: 2.3%, 5.0%, and 8.9% in the abatacept.  
The most frequently occurring MA abnormality was markedly low lymphocytes. Lymphopenia was not 
reported as an AE in any subject during the ST period. One subject in the abatacept 30/10 mg/kg group 
had a marked elevation in ALT during the ST period. The elevated value was reported an AE with severe 
intensity and unlikely related to the study drug. At the final assessment the value had decreased from 186 
U/L to 88 U/L. The baseline value was 41 U/L. Levels of all clinical laboratory parameters generally 
remained stable in both treatment groups during the ST period, however mean reductions from baseline 
at Day 169 in serum IgA, IgG, and IgM were noted in the 3 abatacept groups, but similar reductions were 
not observed in the placebo group.  
Across all groups 25 subjects had positive ANA status and 15 subjects had positive anti-dsDNA  at 
baseline. One subject from placebo group converted from negative anti-dsDNA status at baseline to a 
positive status at Day 169, for others the status remained unchanged. 
The most common abnormalities seen during the LT period were leukocytosis in seven subjects (4.8%) 
and markedly low lymphocytes in 6 subjects (4.1%). Markedly elevated ALT and AST values were 
reported during the LT period in 2 subjects (1 subject each, 0.7%). MAs occurring at ≥5% were high 
eosinophils in 8.2% of subjects and high serum glucose in 7.6% of subjects. Of the 16 subjects with MAs 
of high serum glucose in the ST and/or LT periods, 9 (56.3%) had a medical history that included diabetes 
mellitus. 
In 4 subjects with leukocytosis, the baseline leukocyte value was high and for 4 subjects the markedly 
elevated leukocyte value was an isolated finding. Leukocytosis was reported as an AE in 1 subject, and 
was assessed as moderate in severity and unlikely related to study drug. The maximum leukocytes value 
in this subject was 21.70 x 103/μL (baseline, 11.20 x 103/μL), and the values remained elevated after the 
subject withdrew from the study due to lack of efficacy on Day 312 (final value on Day 340 was 14.60 x 
103/μL). This subject was also reported to have a humerus fracture and fungal skin infection at the time 
of the marked laboratory abnormality. Lymphopenia was reported as an AE in 1 subject and was assessed 
as mild and unlikely related to study drug; no marked laboratory abnormality was reported in this subject. 
Study IM101332  
During the ST period markedly abnormal laboratory values were uncommon in both treatment groups and 
were reported in a similar proportion of subjects in each group. No clinically relevant trends were 
observed in either treatment group. The only parameter with markedly abnormal values reported in ≥ 5% 
of subjects was elevated fasting triglycerides: 5.4% in the placebo group and 3.2% in the abatacept 
group. Regarding kidney function tests, marked elevations were noted in < 2% of subjects in the 
abatacept group and < 1% of subjects in the placebo group. Marked elevations in hepatic enzymes were 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 111/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
noted in < 1% of subjects in the abatacept group and < 2% of subjects in the placebo group. One (1) 
subject in the placebo group was reported with an SAE of increased ALT on Day 63 (245 U/L) that was 
considered related to study drug by the investigator and resulted in discontinuation of the treatment. 
During The Cumulative Abatacept Period up to Year 1, 7 subjects (1.8%) had elevations in AST and 10 
subjects (1.8%) in ALT that met the marked laboratory criteria. Two subjects had treatment-related AEs 
of increased transaminases which led to discontinuation of abatacept during the OL Period. 20 (5.1%) 
subjects had elevations in serum glucose and 18 (5.8%) of subjects with elevations in fasting triglycerides 
that met the MA criteria. 14/20 (70.0%) had had a medical history that included diabetes mellitus. No 
subjects discontinued study therapy due to elevations in fasting triglycerides or glucose. Lymphopenia is 
noted in 11 subjects (2.8%) and leucocytosis in 10 subjects (2.5%)  
Up to Year 2, lymphopenia was noted in 15 subjects (3.8%), leucocytosis in 13 subjects (13.3%), 
elevated AST  in 9 subjects (2.3%) and ALT in 13 subjects (3.3%), elevations in serum glucose in 27 
subjects (6.8%) and elevations in fasting triglycerides in 18 subjects (5.7%). 
Additionally during The Cumulative Abatacept Period in more than 2 % of the subjects elevated levels of 
eosinophils, GGT, BUN, creatinine and low levels of phosphorus were noted. 
Safety in special populations 
Study IM101158 
No subgroup analyses of safety were performed in IM101158. 
Study IM101332 
Subgroup analyses by age (< 65 years old, >65 years old, baseline weight (60-100 kg, > 100 kg), gender 
(male, female), geographic region (North America, Europe, South America, ROW), MTX use at Day 1 (yes, 
no), TNFi-exposed (yes, no), steroid use (yes, no)) were performed on data from the ST period of 
IM101332. The safety profile of abatacept was generally similar in subgroups.  Urinary tract infections 
were reported more frequently in females than males treated with abatacept, but in general, individual 
AEs were reported by similar proportions of female and male subjects.

Period  by  Concomitant  Methotrexate  Use,  Prior  Exposure  to  TNFi  Agents,  and  Concomitant 
Oral Steroid Use –As-treated Population 
As safety of abatacept was analysed during The Cumulative Abatacept Period up to Year 2 in subgroups 
by concomitant MTX and prior TNFi use, no clinically relevant differences were observed in SAEs, AEs, AEs 
reported in ≥5% of subjects and in AEs of special interest between treatment groups (MTX use yes/no 
and Prior TNFi use yes/no). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new data has been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
According to the current approved product information for abatacept the use of abatacept with TNF 
antagonists or other biologic RA therapy is not recommended due to an increased risk of infections.  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Study IM101158 
Adverse events lead to discontinuation of the study drug during the ST period for 7 subjects. 
Discontinuation of study drug were reported in 1 (2.3%), 2 (5.0%), and 1 (2.2%) subjects in the 
abatacept 30/10, 10/10, and 3/3 mg/kg groups, respectively, and in 3 (7.1%) subjects in the placebo 
group during the ST period. Treatment-related AEs leading to discontinuation included osteomyelitis 
(SAE, abatacept 30/10 mg/kg), anaphylactic reaction (AE, abatacept 10/10 mg/kg), infusion-related 
reaction (AE, abatacept 10/10 mg/kg), drug eruption (AE, placebo), and paresthesia (AE, placebo). 
During the LT period, treatment with abatacept was discontinued in 4 subjects (2.7%) due to an AE. The 
AEs leading to discontinuation during the LT period were periodontal disease, localized infection, weight 
decreased, and swelling face. Periodontal disease was assessed as possibly related to study drug. 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 113/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
Study IM101332 
During the ST period 1.4 % and 1.9% in the abatacept and the placebo groups, respectively, discontinued 
study drug due to AEs. In placebo group discontinuation was due to AEs of paresthesia and stomatitis and 
a SAE of ALT increased. In abatacept treated group 3 subjects discontinued due to SAEs: a Pneumocystis 
jirovecii infection, gastroenteritis and interstitial lung disease. AEs of infection led to discontinuation only 
in the abatacept group. In The Cumulative Abatacept Period, treatment was discontinued due to AEs in 10 
subjects during the OL period and in 4 subjects during the LTE. 
Treatment-related AEs which led to discontinuation were Pneumocystis jirovecii infection during the ST 
period, increased transaminases (2 subjects), pruritus and transitional cell carcinoma during OL period 
and intervertebral discitis during the LTE. SAEs led to discontinuation of abatacept therapy in 8/398 
(2.0%) subjects, including the 3 subjects during the ST period and 5 subjects during the OL Period (1 
subject each): transitional cell carcinoma, prostate cancer, colitis, biliary dilatation, and uterine 
leiomyoma). 
Immunogenicity (Immunological events) 
Immunogenicity directed against biological medicinal product can result in alterations in PK, efficacy, 
and/or safety profiles. Antibody-mediated clearance of a biologic therapy may reduce drug 
concentrations, or the antibody response may prevent the drug from binding to its pharmacologic target, 
both of which can lead to decreased efficacy. Antibody responses can also cause general 
immune-mediated toxicities, such as systemic infusion reactions, local injection reactions, and 
hypersensitivity reactions. For abatacept specifically, there is also a theoretical concern that antibodies 
directed to the CTLA4 portion of abatacept could react with endogenous CTLA4 expressed on 
T-lymphocytes and potentially cause immunostimulatory effects, leading to worsening of the 
autoimmune disease abatacept was intended to treat or development of other autoimmune disease/ 
events. 
Study IM101158 
Few patients developed anti-abatacept antibodies in the ST period. The immunogenicity rates in PsA of 
1/43 (2.3%), 0/40 (0), and 2/45 (4.4%) subjects in the IV abatacept 30/10 mg/kg, 10/10 mg/kg, and 
3/3 mg/kg groups, respectively were comparable to the historic immunogenicity rates seen in the RA 
studies with IV abatacept. One subject had neutralizing antibody activity at 56, but not 85, days post last 
dose. None of the 3 subjects with anti-abatacept antibodies were reported to have SAEs, acute infusional 
AEs (prespecified), or autoimmune disorders (prespecified) during the ST period. There was no indication 
of any adverse impact on efficacy in any of the 3 subjects. 
Immunogenicity rates were low in the LT period (Table 60), antibody titres were generally low, and the 
majority were not persistent. The overall abatacept-induced immunogenicity rate for the LT period 
ranged from 4.7% (2/43) to 5.4% (2/37), with an on-treatment immunogenicity rate ranging from 0 
(0/42) to 5.9% (2/34) and a post-treatment immunogenicity rate of 3.1% (1/32) and 8.0% (2/25). All of 
the abatacept-induced seropositive responses in the LT period consisted of ‘CTLA4 and possibly Ig´ titers 
≥ 10. One subject had neutralizing antibody activity at 56, but not 85, days post last dose. 
Immunogenicity was persistent for 1 subject with a positive on-treatment result. Medical review of the 
safety data among subjects with an abatacept-induced seropositive response in the LT period indicated 
that AEs were not consistent with immunemediated toxicities. Immunogenicity status did not appear to 
affect efficacy responses.

Table 60 - Proportion of Subjects with Positive Abatacept-induced Responses (ECL Method) 
Over Time in the Long-term Period: Immunogenicity Population of LT Period 
Study IM101332 
During treatment in the ST period, there were 8/203 subjects (3.9%) in the abatacept group and 17/198 
subjects (8.6%) in the placebo group who tested positive for anti-drug antibodies with respect to 
baseline, with the majority of these directed against the IgG portion of the molecule (see Table 61) Of the 
25 subjects positive for ADAs, 5 subjects in the abatacept group and 13 subjects in the placebo group 
were Early Escape subjects. Because the placebo group was never exposed to abatacept in the ST Period, 
these results suggest that the assay may over-predict the actual rate of immunogenicity. 
In Study IM101332 the rates of immunogenicity were similar in the presence or absence of MTX and the 
rate of immunogenicity was also similar to the rates seen in the presence or absence of MTX in RA, as 
shown in Study IM101226 in MTX naive subjects with RA treated with abatacept 125 mg weekly.

In the Cumulative Abatacept Period, all subjects originally randomized to placebo were transitioned to 
weekly SC abatacept treatment. Anti-abatacept antibodies directed at both CTLA4/possibly IgG regions 
and IgG and/or junction regions were noted at similar frequencies for subjects randomized originally to 
abatacept or to placebo (see Table 62). During the post-treatment period, only reactivity against 
CTLA4/possibly IgG regions was detected. A higher proportion of subjects had anti-abatacept antibodies 
detected during the post-treatment period than during the on-treatment period.

Effect of Immunogenicity on PK  
Study IM101158 
Among the 3 subjects with anti-abatacept antibodies, 2 subjects demonstrated ADA on Day 169 only 
while the third subject demonstrated seroposivity at 2 follow-up post-treatment visits only. The trough 
concentrations over time of the 2 subjects with on-treatment ADA at Day 169 show that concentrations 
remained consistent before and at the presence of ADA. Therefore, there is no effect of immunogenicity 
on PK. The individual profiles for Cmin over time show that concentrations remained consistent before 
and after the presence of positive ADA and the presence of anti-abatacept antibody reactivity did not 
appear to consistently affect abatacept Cmin values.  
Study IM101332 
Of the 8 positive subjects in the short term period, 7 subjects had trough concentrations available. The 
individual profiles for Cmin over time shows that concentrations remained consistent before and after the 
presence of ADA in the cumulative. Therefore, the presence of positive immune responses did not appear 
to consistently affect abatacept Cmin values. 
Additionally to further assess the effect of immunogenicity on the PK of abatacept, the effect of antibody 
response on the clearance of abatacept was evaluated. Population PK derived estimates for clearance 
were combined from studies IM101158 and IM101332 and categorized by antibody response. The

distribution of clearance appears to be comparable between subjects with and without an antibody 
response, suggesting that immunogenicity had little to no impact on the clearance of abatacept following 
IV or SC administration. 
Post marketing experience 
Abatacept  is  marketed  worldwide  for  the  treatment  of  moderately  to  severely  active  RA  and  for  the 
treatment of JIA. Depending on the country or territory specific license, it may be used as monotherapy 
or concomitantly with DMARDs other than TNF antagonists.  
Clinical  investigation  of  abatacept  has  been  underway  since  15-Aug-1995.  As  of  22-Dec-2015, 
approximately  10,771  subjects  have  been  exposed  to  abatacept in  BMS-sponsored  clinical trials.  The 
cumulative  number  of  patients  treated  from  23-Dec-2005  through  30-Sep-2015  is  estimated  to  be 
383,451. 
A review of all safety and efficacy data/information currently available for abatacept for the above 
mentioned indications, including review of safety signals, did not reveal a change to the established 
benefit-risk profile of abatacept in the approved indications. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Orencia (abatacept, BMS-188667) administered intravenously (IV) or subcutaneously (SC) is approved 
for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adults. Abatacept IV is also approved for the treatment 
of polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in pediatric patients 6 years of age and older. The safety 
profile of abatacept is well established for adults with RA, including long-term follow-up. The safety profile 
is characterised by several potentially serious consequences, including but not limited to the identified 
risk of infections and potential risks of malignancies, autoimmune disorders, local injection site reactions 
and immunogenicity, which were also monitored during the clinical studies in psoriatic arthritis (PsA).  
The safety data for patients with active PsA is derived from 2 clinical studies: IM101332, a pivotal Phase 
3 study of SC abatacept and IM101158, a Phase 2b study of IV abatacept. A total of 594 subjects with 
active PsA were treated in the 2 clinical studies; 341 subjects received abatacept and 253 subjects 
received placebo during the ST period. After the ST period, all subjects received open-label (OL) 
abatacept in order to assess the long term safety of abatacept in subjects with PsA. Study IM101158 was 
terminated prematurely by the MAH due to the modest efficacy on skin-related parameters. Safety data 
are presented separately for each study and no formal comparison of safety data were made between 
treatments or studies and no formal statistical testing was performed. This is acceptable due to the 
different pharmaceutical forms (IV and SC) and the different definitions of some AEs in each study. AEs 
of special interest, i.e., infections, malignancies, autoimmune events, local site reactions, acute infusion 
reactions, peri-infusional reactions and AEs within 24 h of injection are discussed separately. 
Since August 15th 1995, approximately 10,771 patients have been exposed to abatacept in sponsored 
clinical trials and the cumulative number of patients treated as of 30-Sep-2015 is estimated to be 
383,451. Currently abatacept is used in combination with methotrexate (MTX) for the treatment of RA 
and JIA. The established a safety profile of abatacept is mainly based on data on adults with RA.  In Study 
IM101158 the mean duration of exposure in the ST period ranged from 153.6 to 166.8 days. During the 
combined ST + LT period, the overall mean duration of exposure to abatacept was 20.4 months (n=161). 
In Study IM101332 the median days (SD) of exposure in the abatacept and placebo groups in the ST 
period were 147.7 days (30.5) and 140.3 days (30.0), respectively. Up to Year 2, the mean duration of 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 117/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
exposure to abatacept was 17.0 months for the cumulative abatacept period, and the mean number of 
injections was 63.2. 
Adverse events 
AEs were reported in comparable proportions of subjects treated with abatacept and placebo. Although, 
the number of treatment-related AEs was slightly higher in the abatacept-treated subjects than in the 
placebo treated patients. 
Infections 
Overall in both studies, infections were the most common AEs in both abatacept and placebo groups, 
however discontinuation of the treatment due to AEs of infection was only seen in the abatacept treated 
patients.  In study IM101158 infections were reported in similar manner for both abatacept (34.9, 35% 
and 35.6%) and placebo (35.7%) groups. The most common AEs of infections were nasopharyngitis and 
other non-serious upper respiratory tract infections and bronchitis. AEs during the ST period were mild or 
moderate in severity, except for 1 event of very severe osteomyelitis in the abatacept 30/10 mg/kg 
group, which led to discontinuation of the treatment drug. A case of osteomyelitis was also reported in 
study IM101332. The SAEs of infection reported during the LT period in IM101158: herpes zoster, 
pyelonephritis acute, pneumonia and cellulitis, are already addressed in the SmPC in section 4.8 and no 
new safety concerns arise from these cases. 
In Study IM101332 during the ST period Infections and infestations were the most commonly reported 
AEs. The most common infections nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections were reported 
slightly more often in the placebo group.  
In abatacept group a case of opportunistic infection caused by Pneumocystis jirovecii was seen on one 
patient and leading to discontinuation of the treatment. The case of Pneumocystis jirovecii was further 
discussed. A search performed from a database for RA patients “Studies of Abatacept in Psoriatic arthritis 
and in Integrated Clinical Safety Database in Rheumatoid Arthritis” did not reveal additional cases. Taken 
into account that in the case of the AE of Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in Study IM101332 there were 
also several factors predisposing the subject to an opportunistic infection, the existing precautionary 
statements in SmPC Section 4.4 and the paragraph concerning infections in the SmPC Section 4.8 are 
considered sufficient to minimize the risk. 
During the Cumulative Abatacept period up to year 2 infections and infestations were reported in 45.5% 
of the subjects. The most common infections reported were upper respiratory infections, bronchitis and 
nasopharyngitis and the treatment was discontinued due to AEs or SAEs of infection in 7 (1.8%) subjects. 
SAEs of infection were reported in 10 (2.5%) subjects: gastroenteritis (2 subjects) and Pneumocystis 
jirovecii infection during the ST period; appendicitis, Epstein-Barr virus infection, pneumonia and 
pyelonephritis during the OL period; and osteomyelitis, intervertebral discitis and cellulitis during the LTE.  
Malignancies 
Malignancies not related to skin were noted in a small proportion of abatacept-treated patients (3 
subjects) and did not raise any specific safety concerns. Additionally, a total of 5 cases of skin 
malignancies, including precursors of malignant tumors, were reported in abatacept-treated patients in 
both studies.  
In Study IM101158 one case of basal cell carcinoma was reported during the ST period and 3 
malignancies (Bowen’s disease, lentigo maligna stage unspecified, and a metastatic squamous cell 
carcinoma of the tongue) were reported during the LT period. The SAE of metastatic squamous cell 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 118/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
carcinoma of the tongue was assessed as possibly related to treatment however the subject also had a 
history of exposure to Agent Orange, a known carcinogen, while a soldier in the Vietnam War. 
In Study IM101332 during the ST period 2 cases of malignancy were reported in placebo group (invasive 
ductal breast carcinoma and a B-cell lymphoma) and no malignancies were reported in the abatacept 
group. During the Cumulative Abatacept Period malignancies were reported in 4 subjects: a prostate 
cancer, a carcinoma in situ of skin, a squamous cell carcinoma of skin and a transitional cell carcinoma, 
which was considered related to treatment. The subject with squamous cell carcinoma had a medical 
history of a basal cell carcinoma of the nose.  
There have been reports of NMSC in patients receiving abatacept and therefore periodic skin examination 
is recommended for all patients, particularly for those with risk factors for skin cancer. Patients with PsA 
may be at increased risk of both non-melanoma skin cancer and melanoma as they may have previous 
treatments with e.g. non-biological and biological DMARDs and phototherapy. 
The risk of skin malignancies in PsA patients was further discussed. Overall, the data provided suggests 
that the incidence rates of NMSC and melanoma with abatacept use are comparable to the background 
rates in the PsA populations, and that the incidence rates from the Study IM101332 for NMSC are similar 
to the presented background rates of the general population. However, the incidence rates for NMSC and 
melanoma in Study IM101158 for abatacept-treated and placebo-treated patients were not provided, nor 
did the MAH compare incidence rates between the placebo- and abatacept-treated patients in Study 
IM101332. This issue will be further investigated in the context of a large pharmacoepidemiology 
programme setting. 
There are already ongoing Category 3 additional PhV activities, namely a Post-marketing Epidemiology 
program, aiming to provide additional data also on the potential risk of malignancies in abatacept users. 
The final study report will become available in the end of 2018. This program may be biased in what 
comes to the applicability to the PsA patient population as no psoriasis patients with possibly an increased 
risk of NMSC are systematically included, yet. Therefore the MAH is now planning to continue the 
pharmacoepidemiological safety data gathering (as new Additional Pharmacovigilance Activities; 
including occurrence of overall malignancies and NMSC) via the ARTIS Swedish registry and the DANBIO 
Danish biologics registry. These European registries collect data on biologics regardless of indication and 
have the ability to link to the cancer registry. Therefore, the MAH will follow up the incidence rates of 
NMSC and melanoma, specifically, also within this new pharmacoepidemiological registry study (see RMP 
section).  
Autoimmune events  
In study IM101332 during the ST period no autoimmune events were reported in either group. During the 
LTE or OL periods three cases of autoimmune disorders were reported. None of these AEs was considered 
related to abatacept. In study IM101158 AEs and SAEs of psoriasis or psoriatic arthropathy were reported 
as autoimmune disorders.  
In study IM101132 the investigators were requested not to report AEs of psoriatic arthritis or psoriasis, 
unless the event represented a new form of psoriasis or was an SAE. Due to these different practices, the 
data between the studies is not fully comparable. In general, based on the data from ST periods there was 
no major difference in worsening of psoriasis between abatacept- or placebo-treated patients. 
In study IM101158 during the LT period AEs of psoriasis were reported for 5 (3.4%) subjects. For one 
subject the AE was assessed as serious. All 5 cases were assessed as unlikely or not related to study 
treatment and related to the underlying disease, and the treatment was continued.  
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 119/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
During the Cumulative Abatacept period in study IM101132, AEs of psoriasis or psoriatic arthropathy 
were reported in a total of 8 subjects: During the OL period a SAEs of psoriatic arthropathy in 2 subjects 
and an AE of psoriasis, a SAE of psoriasis, an AE of skin plaque psoriasis and a SAE of erythrodermic 
psoriasis in one patient, each, and during the LTE 2 SAEs of psoriatic arthropathy. 3 subjects (an AE of 
psoriasis, a SAE of psoriasis and a SAE of erythrodermic psoriasis) discontinued abatacept therapy due to 
lack of efficacy and one subject discontinued due to an AE of skin plaque psoriasis. 
The possible risk of worsening of psoriasis and psoriatic erythdodermia during abatacept treatment was 
further discussed. Based on the provided data it seems likely that AEs of psoriatic erythroderma and 
worsening of psoriasis seen in Studies IM101558 and IM101332 in patients treated with abatacept could 
be due to overall modest efficacy of abatacept on skin lesions and in the specific case of erythrodermic 
psoriasis, which led to hospitalization, also due to poorly controlled disease at baseline and the use of a 
known trigger, a high-dose corticosteroid treatment followed with a rapid withdrawal.  
Infusional AEs and injection site reactions 
Data related to infusional AEs and injection site reactions or Adverse Events within 24 Hours of Study 
Drug Administration do not raise new safety concerns. One severe anaphylactic reaction in the abatacept 
group was reported. The risk of anaphylaxis and anaphylactoid reaction is already identified in the safety 
profile of abatacept and hypersensitivity is listed in the SmPC as an uncommon AE.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
No deaths were reported in Studies IM101158 and IM101332.  
In Study IM101158, during the ST period SAEs were reported in 4 (9.3%), 2 (5%), 0 and 1 (2%) subjects 
in abatacept 30/10, 10/10, 3/3 and placebo groups, respectively.  
A SAE of cardiac failure in one subject (ST cohort: abatacept 10/10 mg/kg) was assessed as possibly 
related to treatment. Overall, SAEs in SOC Cardiac disorders were reported in 4 subjects (2.5 %), 
including atrial fibrillation in 2 subjects (1.2%) and acute coronary syndrome, aortic valve incompetence 
and cardiac failure each once (0.6%). In study IM101332 for Cumulative Abatacept Population up to year 
2 SAEs of SOC Cardiac disorders were reported in 3 subjects. The MAH has provided further discussion on 
these cases in relation to abatacept including post-marketing data from RA patients during abatacept 
treatment. The MAH will continue to monitor cases of cardiac events in patients receiving abatacept by 
means of routine pharmacovigilance. 
In Study IM101332 SAEs were reported in 6 (2.8%) subjects in the abatacept group and 9 (4.3%) 
subjects in the placebo group during the ST period. SAEs considered treatment-related were reported in 
1 (0.5%) subject in each group: Pneumocystis jirovecii infection in the abatacept group and increased 
ALT in the placebo group. 2 malignancies were reported, both in the placebo group.  
Overall across both studies AEs or SAEs of osteonecrosis were reported in 3 subjects. An additional search 
from the Integrated Clinical Safety Database in Patients with RA was performed. The search identified five 
(5) events of osteonecrosis reported in the double-blind, placebo-controlled RA studies of which four (4) 
of the cases were receiving abatacept treatment with a frequency of 0.2% and 1 case receiving placebo 
with a frequency of 0.1%. A further evaluation of the cases identified in studies IM101158 and IM1011332 
revealed that a case of osteonecrosis reported in Study IM101158, was actually a sequelae of 
osteoarthritis and in another case corticosteroid use was identified as a risk factor. One case remained 
without known predisposing risk factors, but raises no further safety concern.

Laboratory findings 
In general markedly abnormal laboratory values were uncommon and majority of these findings in 
laboratory values are fairly common in PsA population with comorbidities such as metabolic syndrome 
and type II diabetes. Majority of the subjects with high levels of blood glucose had a medical history that 
included diabetes mellitus: 9/16 (56.3%) subjects during ST and/or LT in study IM101558 and 14/20 
(70.0%) subjects during the Cumulative Abatacept Period up to year 1 in IM101332.  
In study IM101332 low and high levels of blood glucose and elevated fasting triglycerides were observed 
both in abatacept- and placebo-treated subjects. 
In study IM101558 lipid tests were not performed, but high and low levels of blood glucose were also 
observed both in abatacept- and placebo-treated subjects. It is noteworthy that mean reductions from 
baseline at Day 169 in serum IgA, IgG, and IgM were noted in the 3 abatacept groups but not in the 
placebo group. Reduced numbers of immunoglobulins IgG, IgA, and IgM have also been previously noted 
in association with abatacept in studies in RA population. 
Patients with psoriatic arthritis may potentially have wide-spread areas of skin affected by psoriasis, i.e., 
lesions of skin that have lost the protective skin barrier predisposing these patients to infection.  
Abatacept modulates T cell costimulation and it interferes with the activation of T cells and their ability to 
provide help to B cells, although no clear relationship of abatacept treatment with lymphopenia could be 
established as lymphopenia also occurred in the placebo group. Mean reductions from baseline in 
immunoglobulins were generally less than 10% with abatacept treatment and this finding was considered 
to have only minimal impact. Nevertheless, immune suppression, such as caused by abatacept, 
associated with therapies for psoriasis may diminish the ability to control an infection. If the treatment 
has the potential to heal lesional skin in psoriasis, it could theoretically be subverting the immune 
machinery necessary to fight infections.  
SAEs of infection or discontinuation of the treatment due to AEs of infection were seen more often among 
abatacept-treated patients. Also some events of SAEs of infection were ongoing at the time of database 
lock and the treatment remained interrupted and discontinuation of the treatment was not recorded. In 
conclusion, PsA patients should be carefully monitored for possible infections during treatment with 
abatacept (see warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC). In patients with severe skin disease the risk for 
serious infections may be further increased.  
No subgroup analyses of safety were performed in IM101158. In Study IM101332 no clinically relevant 
differences in safety were seen in subgroup analyses by age (< 65 years old,  65 years old), baseline 
weight (60-100 kg, > 100 kg), gender (male, female), geographic region (North America, Europe, South 
America, ROW), MTX use at Day 1 (yes, no), TNFi-exposed (yes, no).   
Immunogenicity (Immunological events) 
In Study IM101158, ADA were reported for 1/43 (2.3%), 0/40 (0), and 2/45 (4.4%) subjects in the IV 
abatacept 30/10 mg/kg, 10/10 mg/kg, and 3/3 mg/kg groups, respectively. Serum samples from placebo 
group were not analysed. None of these subjects had AEs potentially related to immunogenicity. In the LT 
period, on-treatment immunogenicity rate ranged from 0 to 5.9% and the post-treatment 
immunogenicity rate from 3.1% to 8.0% in the abatacept groups. All these ADAs were directed to the 
“CTLA4 and possibly Ig” portion. 
In study IM101332, 8/203 (3.9%) of abatacept-treated subjects and 17/198 (8.6%) of placebo-treated 
subjects had on-treatment ADAs during the Short-term Period, with the majority of these directed against 
the IgG portion of the molecule. Immunogenicity detected in the placebo-treated patients suggests that 
the assay may over-predict the actual rate of immunogenicity.  
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 121/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
The proportion of patients with ADA at 28d, 85d and 168d post last dose was high, i.e. 14%, 60% and 
75%, respectively, (overall 37,5%), however the number of subjects tested was very small (7, 5 and 4, 
respectively). The high ADA-prevalence during the post-treatment period is consistent with the known 
immunogenicity profile in RA and is probably due to immunomodulatory effects of abatacept for 
anti-abatacept antibody formation during the treatment.  
Several factors, such as a conservative setting of both screening and confirmation assays as well as the 
strict definition of positive relative to baseline may have contributed to the over-prediction of 
immunogenicity. Prior exposure to immunoglobulin containing products, including biologics and blood 
transfusions may also explain the high incidence of reactivity. 
Overall, the number of subjects evaluated for immunogenicity by the ECL assay in the abatacept 
group (203 subjects) and placebo group (198 subjects) were similar in the ST Period. At baseline in the 
abatacept group, 23/203 (11.3%) all subjects had IgG specificity and in the placebo group, 19/198 
(9.6%) all except one had IgG specificity and only one with specificity to CTLA4 and a relatively low titer. 
The immunogenicity rates in the placebo group (17/198, 8.6%) were comparable to the rates of 
preexisting reactivity observed in the baseline samples seen in abatacept group (23/203 (11.3%)). From 
the subjects who tested positive in the baseline in the abatacept group, 3/203 (1.47%) tested positive for 
“CTLA4 and possibly Ig” and 5/203 (2.46%) for “Ig and/or junctional region”.  In the placebo group, 
3/198 (1.51%) tested positive for “CTLA4 and possibly Ig” and 14/198 (7.07%) tested positive for “Ig 
and/or junctional region”.  
The results show that the assay may in fact over-predict the true frequency of ADAs, especially against 
the IgG region. Prior exposure to immunoglobulin containing products, including biologics and blood 
transfusions may also explain the high incidence of reactivity. However, the presented data overall 
suggests that even with the strict definition of ADA positivity relative to baseline, antibody response does 
not have a clear impact on PK, safety or efficacy. Currently abatacept is indicated in combination with 
methotrexate for the treatment of RA in adults and for JIA in paediatric patients 6 years of age. The effect 
of MTX was assessed in study IM101332 and the rate of immunogenicity was found to be similar in the 
presence or absence of MTX, and consistent with the rates seen before in the presence or absence of MTX 
in RA. In conclusion, the data provided do not suggest that MTX use would have an effect on the formation 
of ADAs. 
In studies IM101332 and IM101158 the individual profiles for Cmin over time showed that concentrations 
remained consistent before and after the presence of positive ADA, and the presence of anti-abatacept 
antibody reactivity did not appear to consistently affect abatacept Cmin values. Graphical exploration of 
the data indicated that clinically meaningful effect of ADA on pharmacokinetics of abatacept in PsA 
patients is unlikely. Overall, the data related to anti-abatacept antibodies in studies IM101158 and 
IM101332 show consistency with the known immunogenicity profile of abatacept in RA. 
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The safety profile including the type and the incidence of adverse events, SAEs and immunogenicity in 
patients with PSA is in general consistent with that seen earlier in patients with RA.

2.7.  Update of the Product information 
As a consequence of this new indication, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC have been 
updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative(s) of Croatia (Hrvatska). 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: 
  Consultation with target patient groups on the Package Leaflet has been performed at the 
occasion of the original Marketing Authorization Application of ORENCIA powder for concentrate 
for solution for infusion for the treatment of Rheumatoid Arthritis (EC Decision received on 21 May 
2007). 
 
The readability of the ORENCIA solution for injection Package Leaflet has been tested at the 
occasion of the Extension Application for this second pharmaceutical form and route of 
administration (EC Decision received on 4 October 2012). 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 126/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  A bridging report to validate a US conducted User Testing for the “Instructions for Use” portion of 
the package leaflet was submitted and approved for the Orencia solution for injection in pre-filled 
pen (CHMP opinion on 23 April 2015). 
  Only limited changes (i.e. those relevant to the new indication) are made to the Package Leaflet, 
the routes of administration and the safety profile remain the same. 
  Administration of ORENCIA powder for concentrate for solution for infusion is done by a health 
care professional. The instructions for dose calculation, preparation, administration, storage and 
disposal that are currently reflected in the approved PL remain unchanged. 
 
The general design and layout of the proposed PL has not changed compared to the tested ones. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
ORENCIA, alone or in combination with methotrexate, is indicated for the treatment of active psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA) in adult patients when the response to previous DMARD therapy including MTX has been 
inadequate, and for whom additional systemic therapy for psoriatic skin lesions is not required. 
PsA is associated with specific major histocompatibility complex class I genes (for example, human 
leukocyte antigen B*08:01, B*27:05, C*06:02, B*39:01, and B*38:01) that code for molecules that are 
involved in antigen presentation to T-cells. There is strong non-clinical experimental evidence of T-cell 
involvement in PsA, which led to the evaluation of abatacept in the treatment of this disease. 
More than half of patients with PsA exhibit progressive, erosive arthritis that often is associated with 
functional impairment. Because the severity of the psoriasis and the arthritis may be discordant in PsA, 
there are patients with moderate or severe arthritis who have well-controlled or no to minimal psoriasis. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
TNFi agents were the first biologic agents approved for the treatment of PsA. Ustekinumab, an inhibitor of 
IL-12/23, apremilast, an inhibitor of PDE4, and secukinumab, an antibody directed against IL-17, were 
also recently approved for PsA. These therapies have greatly improved the management of patients with 
PsA. Unfortunately, 40% to 60% of patients treated with current therapies do not reach a minimal 
improvement in their joint disease (ie, ACR 20) based on clinical trial data. In addition, TNFi-exposed 
patients may be more resistant to treatment, as the proportion of subjects achieving an ACR 20 was lower 
for TNFi-exposed than in TNFi-naive subjects in trials of ustekinumab, apremilast, and secukinumab. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  application  is  based  on  data  from  a  supportive  Phase  2b  study  with  abatacept  administered  IV 
(IM101158) and a pivotal Phase 3 study with abatacept administered SC (IM101332). In both studies 
abatacept  was  compared  to  placebo  in  a  6-month,  double-blind,  short-term  period,  followed  by  an 
open-label long-term period. The long-term period of Study IM101332 is ongoing. 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 127/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
The phase 2b study of IV abatacept (IM101158) and the pivotal phase 3 study of SC abatacept 
(IM101332) included subjects with PsA and psoriasis. The primary efficacy endpoint was achieved in both 
studies as significantly higher proportion of abatacept-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated 
subjects met the ACR 20 response criteria at Day 169. In Study IM101158, ACR 20 response rate at Day 
169 was similar for abatacept 30/10 mg/kg (41.9%) and abatacept 10/10 mg/kg (47.5%) treatment 
groups and significantly higher in comparison to placebo group (19.0%; p = 0.022 and 0.006, 
respectively). In Study IM101332, significantly higher proportion of subjects in the abatacept group 
compared to the placebo group met the ACR 20 response criteria at Day 169 (39.4% vs. 22.3%, 
respectively, p <0.001). 
Among the secondary efficacy endpoints related to signs and symptoms of PsA, subjects treated with 
abatacept in Study IM101158 demonstrated greater improvement at Day 169 in the physical component 
of SF-36 in comparison to subjects treated with placebo, with the highest adjusted differences from 
placebo of 9.12 in the abatacept 10/10 mg/kg group. The 95% CIs for each comparison to placebo did not 
contain zero. Some improvement was also seen in the mental component of SF-36 but all 95% CIs for the 
adjusted differences contained zero. The estimated differences from placebo in the HAQ-DI scores were 
16.0%, 26.1%, and 16.6% for the abatacept 30/10 mg/kg, 10/10 mg/kg, and 3/3 mg/kg groups, 
respectively, and for the abatacept 10/10 mg/kg group the 95% CI did not contain zero. 
In Study IM101332, among key secondary endpoints, the proportion of HAQ responders was numerically 
higher in the abatacept group compared to the placebo group but was not statistically significant (31.0% 
vs. 23.7%, respectively, p=0.097). Since the analysis of HAQ-response showed statistically 
non-significant result, treatment differences for endpoints lower in the testing hierarchy (i.e., ACR 20 
response rate at Day 169 in the TNFi-naive and the TNFi-exposed cohorts and x-ray non-progressor rate 
at Day 169) could not be tested for significance and statistical claims for the presented nominal p-values 
could not be made. Among the key secondary endpoints, higher proportion of subjects in the abatacept 
group met the ACR 20 response criteria at Day 169 in both the TNFi-naive and TNFi-exposed 
subpopulations (44.0% and 36.4%, respectively) compared to the placebo group (22.2% and 22.3%, 
respectively; nominal p-values 0.003 and 0.012, respectively; and the 95% CIs for the estimates of 
difference did not contain zero). There was also a higher proportion of radiographic non-progressors at 
Day 169 in the abatacept group compared to the placebo group (42.7% vs. 32.7%; nominal 
p-value=0.034; the 95% CI for the estimate of difference did not contain zero). Based on the data 
available up to one year, it can be concluded that abatacept treatment has a beneficial effect on joint 
structure. 
In the long term treatment up to one year, the effects of IV and SC abatacept were maintained. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
While the efficacy of IV and SC abatacept based on the primary efficacy endpoint was demonstrated, 
results of the secondary efficacy endpoints only partially supported the primary efficacy analysis. In 
Study IM101332, the proportion of HAQ responders was not statistically significant and statistical claims 
for the nominal p-values for endpoints lower in the testing hierarchy could not be made. Consequently, 
results related to ACR 20 response rate at Day 169 in the TNFi-naive and the TNFi-exposed cohorts and 
x-ray non-progressor rate at Day 169 are descriptive only. There was also no clinically relevant effect of 
abatacept on skin symptoms. 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 128/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In both studies, infections were the most common AEs in both abatacept and placebo groups during the 
double-blind period and remained the predominant AEs across the reporting period. In study IM101332 
during the Cumulative Abatacept period up to year 2 infections and infestations were reported in 52.5% 
of the subjects and in study IM101158 in the All Treated Subjects in LT Period population in 56.5% of the 
subjects.  
Malignancies not related to skin were reported in a total of 3 subjects. Additionally, skin malignancies, 
including precursors of malignant tumors, were reported in 5 abatacept-treated patients across both 
studies. 
Among laboratory findings, lymphopenia and lower levels of immunoglobulins were noted in the 
abatacept group. In Study IM101158, mean reductions from baseline in serum IgA, IgG, and IgM were 
noted in the 3 abatacept groups but not in the placebo group. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
In relation with the reported malignancies and precursors of malignant tumors of the skin, it should be 
noted that patients with PsA may be at increased risk of both non-melanoma skin cancer and melanoma, 
as these patients have previous treatments with non-biological and biological DMARDs and phototherapy. 
Malignancies, including NMSC, are an important potential risk for abatacept, as outlined in the RMP. 
However, the patient numbers in the PsA studies are very small and therefore no definitive conclusions 
can be drawn.  There are ongoing Category 3 additional PhV activities, namely Epidemiology program, 
aimed to provide additional data also on the potential risk of malignancies in abatacept users. 
Potentially, the effect of abatacept on T-cells and on B-cells, causing lymphopenia and reduced number of 
immunoglobulins may predispose PsA patients to serious infections, appropriate warnings and 
recommendations are already in place in the SmPC. 
It remains unclear if the neutralising antibody assay is fully suitable for its intended purpose, as drug 
interference occurred at abatacept levels relevant for PsA patients and thus only half of the samples could 
be properly analyzed. CHMP recommended that for any future application for Orencia containing 
immunogenicity assessment the MAH will improve the Nab assay, particularly the drug tolerance for 
abatacept levels more relevant in patients’ sera.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Efficacy of IV and SC abatacept based on the primary efficacy endpoint was demonstrated, as statistically 
significantly higher proportion of abatacept-treated subjects compared to placebo-treated subjects met 
the ACR 20 response criteria at Day 169. Results of the secondary efficacy endpoints related to the joint 
disease, however, only partially supported the primary efficacy analysis, and no clinically relevant or 
statistically significant effect on skin parameters was demonstrated. 
The population in the abatacept PsA studies was similar to that in pivotal studies of other biological 
DMARDs but Study IM101332 included more treatment-resistant patients: The proportion of subjects 
exposed to prior TNFi therapy was 61.1%, and 17.2% were exposed to more than one prior TNFi therapy. 
EMA/455579/2017  
Page 131/133 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Efficacy of abatacept was shown in this population but formal statistical significance testing is lacking for 
both IV and SC abatacept. 
Psoriasis is a one of the key manifestations of PsA, and current psoriasis or personal or family history of 
psoriasis is a keystone of the CASPAR criteria for PsA. There was no clinically relevant effect of abatacept 
on psoriasis and therefore abatacept is unsuitable for patients who require systemic therapy for psoriatic 
skin lesions and the indication has been updated accordingly.  
The safety profile, including the type and incidence of adverse events, SAEs and immunogenicity is in 
general consistent with that seen earlier in patients with RA.   
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Efficacy of abatacept by prior and concomitant MTX has been sufficiently demonstrated. ACR 20 
responses in the subgroups by prior TNFi exposure, with or without MTX, consistently showed 
improvement relative to placebo, and higher response rates in the anti-TNF naïve patients were seen. In 
conclusion, treatment with or without MTX is considered acceptable. However, data on treatment with or 
without nbDMARD are too limited to allow such recommendation. Therefore the wording of the indication 
was changed to: “ORENCIA can be used alone or in combination with non-biological DMARDsMTX”. 
With regard to the target population, it is agreed that benefit of IV and SC abatacept has been 
demonstrated in PsA population in both second-line (DMARD-IR) and third-line (TNFi-IR) treatment. The 
efficacy was clinically relevant but rather modest, which is partly explained by the relatively slow onset of 
action of abatacept and the design of Study IM101332 with early and stringent escape option.  
There was no clinically relevant effect of abatacept on skin symptoms. Therefore abatacept seems 
unsuitable for the treatment of PsA in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. Therefore, the 
indication wording excludes patients that require additional systemic therapy for psoriasis. Of 
importance, there were rather few discontinuations due to lack of skin efficacy and no emergence of e.g. 
pustular psoriasis was observed. 
The Benefit-Risk balance of Orencia is positive in the treatment of PsA after previous DMARD therapy, i.e., 
in both second- and third-line patients, when additional systemic therapy for psoriatic skin symptoms is 
not required. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Orencia is positive.

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for aclidinium bromide, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Based on 3 cumulative spontaneous post marketing reports of anaphylactic reaction (all serious), the 
MAH proposes to add anaphylactic reaction to section 4.8 (Undesirable effects) of the SmPC with a 
frequency of ‘not known’.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to 
the product information of medicinal products containing aclidinium bromide were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for aclidinium bromide the CHMP is of the opinion that the 
benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing aclidinium bromide is unchanged subject to 
the proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

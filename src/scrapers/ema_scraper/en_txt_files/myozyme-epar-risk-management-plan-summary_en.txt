RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SI: EPIDEMIOLOGY OF THE 
INDICATION(S) AND TARGET POPULATION(S)  
Alglucosidase alfa is indicated for long-term ERT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of 
Pompe disease (acid α-glucosidase deficiency). Alglucosidase alfa is indicated in adults and 
pediatric patients of all ages. 
Pompe disease is a rare metabolic muscle disease inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion. 
Pompe disease is caused by a deficiency of GAA, which is needed for degradation of lysosomal 
glycogen. The estimated global incidence of Pompe disease is 1:40 000. Other names for Pompe 
disease include glycogen storage disease type II (GSD-II), acid maltase deficiency (AMD) and 
glycogenosis type II. 
The prevalence figure can be calculated from the maximum birth incidence of 11.6 per 100 000 
and the number of live births according to the following formula:  
Prevalence (P) = incidence (I) x mean duration or patient life expectancy (D). 
Due to disease progression and in agreement with literature, the average ages of death were 
1, 15-20 and 45-60 for infantile, juvenile and adult-onset phenotypes respectively. To avoid under 
reporting the prevalence of Pompe disease, the highest literature-reported birth incidence 
combined with reported mortality rates were used to estimate the total maximum prevalence of 
Pompe disease. The calculated maximum prevalence of Pompe disease is 6.0:100 000 (or 
0.6:10 000). 
Historically, patients with Pompe disease have been classified into different subtypes such as 
classic infantile-onset (IO), non-typical IO, childhood-, juvenile-, and adult-onset, based on age at 
onset of symptoms, extent of organ involvement and rate of progression to death. However, it is 
difficult to reliably classify patients into such categories using any particular clinical, biochemical 
or genetic criteria as the manifestations of Pompe disease encompasses a spectrum of 
presentation, ranging from a rapidly progressive IO form to a more slowly progressive 
late-onset (LO) form, with considerable variability and overlap between these extremes. (1)(2)(3) 
What is consistent across all presentations is the underlying deficiency of lysosomal GAA 
resulting in progressive tissue damage, and ultimately death, if left untreated. Alglucosidase alfa is 
indicated for long-term ERT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe disease (acid 
α-glucosidase deficiency). Alglucosidase alfa is indicated in adults and pediatric patients of all 
ages. 
Acid alpha glucosidase deficiency is mainly dictated by the variation of mutations in the two GAA 
alleles, and the extent of this deficiency correlates inversely with the disease severity. The lower 
the amount of the residual GAA, the earlier a person will develop the disease and the worse the 
prognosis. (4)(5)(6)(7) 
The epidemiology of the disease is summarized in the following table.

Pompe disease 
The incidence of Pompe disease appears to vary in different ethnic groups. 
Estimates of the frequency of IOPD in the Caucasian population range from 
1:100 000 to 1:200 000. (2) The incidence of IOPD may be the highest among 
patients of African descent (estimated 1:14 000) and among Chinese (estimated 
1:40 000 to 1:50 000). (2) The calculated incidence of all Pompe disease 
phenotypes is estimated to be 1:40 000 births. (8)(9) The incidence estimate for 
LOPD is 1 per 57 000 births. A recent published study estimated the prevalence of 
LOPD to be 3.9 per 1 000 000 in Belgium. (10) 
With the recent availability of a highly sensitive and specific screening process for 
Pompe disease (11), numerous studies have investigated the prevalence of Pompe 
disease among high-risk populations as well as the birth prevalence in newborn 
screening programs and pilot studies. Nordic countries exhibit some of the lowest 
prevalence of Pompe disease among the general population (1 in 224 000 or lower) 
as well as high risk individuals with undetermined muscle diseases. (12)(13)(14) On 
the opposite side of the spectrum, the socially and geographically isolated 
African-American Maroon population of French Guiana living along the Maroni river 
have an estimated birth prevalence of 1 in 2000 due to the founder effect of two 
specific genetic mutations. The estimated rate is 50 times higher than anywhere in 
the world, and limited to IO cases. (15) Newborn screening indicates that Pompe 
disease may be more prevalent than previously estimated with prevalence closer to 
1 in 20 000 live births or even more common in the US, Europe, Mexico, and 
Taiwan, and at least half of which are expected to manifest as LO disease. 
(16)(17)(18)(19) For instance, in a recent screening study in the US, the incidence 
of IOPD + LOPD was 1:16 095. (20) 
Demographics of patients with Pompe disease can be derived from the Pompe 
Registry. As of 01-May-2020, a total of 2254 patients were enrolled in the Pompe 
Registry. A summary of patient ages at enrolment and baseline, as well as current 
age, gender, and ethnicity, as well as a figure of the age at enrolment in the Pompe 
Registry, are presented below (source: Pompe Registry May-2020 data download):

Risk factors for the disease 
The incidence of Pompe disease appears to vary in different ethnic groups. The 
frequency of rapidly progressive disease is at least 1:100 000 to 1:200 000 in the 
Caucasian population, 1:14 000 among African-Americans, and 
1:40 000 to 1:50 000 among Chinese. The frequency of later onset disease in 
Caucasians may be as high as 1:60 000. (2) 
Main existing treatment options  Among the available approaches to treat Pompe disease, ERT based on rhGAA is 
the only treatment that specifically targets the underlying enzymatic cause of the 
disease by replacing the enzyme that is deficient. Alglucosidase alfa and 
avalglucosidase alfa, at 20 mg/kg body weight/qow are the only approved products 
in the market. In addition, symptomatic treatment can be provided through a 
multidisciplinary team including eg, a metabolic disease specialist, a cardiologist, 
pulmonologist, neurologist/neuromuscular specialist, orthopedist, physical therapist, 
speech therapist, geneticist, and/or metabolic dietician. 
At the most severe end of the disease spectrum is the rapidly progressive, IO form, 
in which patients present with signs and symptoms of Pompe disease within the 
first 12 months of life. A massive deposition of glycogen in the heart and skeletal 
muscle results in rapidly progressive cardiomyopathy and generalized muscle 
weakness with hypotonia. Motor development is often completely arrested, or if 
motor development milestones are achieved, they are subsequently lost. Death 
from cardiac and/or respiratory failure occurs before most patients reach 1 year of

condition in the untreated 
population including mortality

Important co-morbidities 
age. Patients presenting with this typical disease course have been described in 
the literature as having “classic” IOPD. (2)(3) A subset of patients with IOPD 
characterized by a slightly later age at onset of symptoms (but before 12 months of 
age) and slower progression of cardiomyopathy has been described by Slonim and 
colleagues. (21) These “non-typical” patients may survive beyond their first 
birthday, but often develop respiratory failure between 1 and 2 years of age. In 
general, patients with IOPD (both classic and non-typical) have little or no residual 
GAA activity due to GAA gene mutations which severely impair protein function or 
preclude its expression altogether. (2)(3) 
At the other end of the disease spectrum, patients with LO Pompe disease manifest 
signs and symptoms anywhere from early childhood through the sixth decade of life 
and experience slower progression in skeletal and respiratory involvement. The 
heart is typically spared, or if it is affected, it is generally secondary to respiratory 
involvement. (2)(22)(23) Patients usually present with myopathy, predominantly of 
the proximal muscles in the trunk and pelvic and shoulder girdles, and a variable 
progression of respiratory involvement. Initial myopathic symptoms can be very 
subtle and may include difficulty combing the hair, rising from a chair, climbing 
stairs, or rising from a squat. However, over time there is increasing involvement of 
lower, truncal, and upper body muscles, and most patients ultimately become 
wheelchair bound. Initial respiratory symptoms may be related to sleep apnea and 
include somnolence and morning headache. As the disease progresses, 
orthopnoea, and/or exertional dyspnoea develop. Many patients eventually require 
non-invasive or invasive ventilation and ultimately progress to respiratory failure, 
the leading cause of death in these patients. (2)(24)(25)(26) 
Important co-morbidities found in the target population: 
Identified safety risks related to underlying Pompe disease include cardiac 
arrhythmias during general anesthesia induction, hearing loss, fractures, increase 
risk of infection and complications associated with brain aneurysm and other 
arteriopathies. 
Long-term survivors of IOPD exhibit sustained improvements in cardiac parameters 
and gross motor function as a result of ERT. Residual muscle weakness, hearing 
loss, risk for arrhythmias, hypernasal speech, dysphagia with risk for aspiration, 
and osteopenia are common. Initially, LOPD was characterized by proximal 
limb-girdle myopathy and substantial respiratory involvement. This spectrum 
includes bulbar muscle involvement manifesting as lingual weakness with 
dysarthria and dysphagia, osteoporosis, scoliosis, rigid spine syndrome, sleep 
apnea and sleep disordered breathing, small-fiber neuropathy, sensorineural 
hearing loss, cerebral and intracranial aneurysms, cardiac hypertrophy, abnormal 
cardiac rhythm, impaired gastric function and gastrointestinal motility, lower urinary 
tract and anal sphincter involvement, pain, and fatigue. (27)(28) 
Concomitant medication(s) in the target population: 
In addition to ERT, because Pompe disease is a multisystem disorder, it is best 
managed by a multidisciplinary team led by an experienced physician. Optimally, 
the team should include a metabolic disease specialist in addition to the specialist 
dictated by the patient’s signs and symptoms, possibly a cardiologist, 
pulmonologist, neurologist/neuromuscular specialist, orthopedist, physical therapist, 
speech therapist, geneticist, and/or metabolic dietician, among others. 
Cardiovascular: In the presence of LV outflow tract obstruction, the use of digoxin, 
other inotropes, diuretics and afterload reducing agents such as ACEI may 
exacerbate the LV outflow tract obstruction. 
Respiratory: Liberal use of bronchodilators is recommended in conjunction with 
airway clearance techniques and assisted coughing maneuvers to maximize the

patient’s pulmonary toilet care. Supplementary O2 can be used to treat hypoxia, 
and noninvasive positive pressure ventilation could be used in case of 
hypo-ventilation. 
Gastrointestinal and Dietary: Maintaining good nutrition with attention to macro and 
micronutrients is important in the management of all patients with Pompe disease. 
Exercise and Rehabilitation: It is recommended to perform submaximal, functional 
and aerobic exercise, to avoid excessive, resistive and eccentric exercise, to avoid 
overwork weakness, and to avoid disuse atrophy.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SII: NON-CLINICAL PART OF THE 
SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
A number of non-clinical safety studies were conducted to evaluate the safety 
pharmacology/toxicology profile of alglucosidase alfa for use as ERT in patients with Pompe 
disease. The toxicology program conducted with alglucosidase alfa includes several single-dose, 
repeat-dose, and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies. Non-clinical evaluation with 
in vivo models of Pompe disease has shown alglucosidase alfa is able to reverse biochemical and 
histopathological manifestations of the disease. Toxicological evaluation in mice, rats, rabbits, 
dogs, and monkeys suggest an acceptable safety profile for human use. 
The key non-clinical safety findings are presented in the following table. 
Table 7 - Key safety findings from non-clinical studies and relevance to human usage 
Key Safety Findings 
Relevance to human usage 
Toxicity 
• Key findings identified from single or repeat-dose
toxicity studies
Alglucosidase alfa was well tolerated in single-dose 
toxicity studies conducted in rats and dogs at doses of 
1, 10, and 100 mg/kg. Only tremors were observed 
60 minutes post dose in some dogs at 10 and 
100 mg/kg. 
No adverse effects were observed in mice when 
alglucosidase alfa was administered intravenously once 
weekly for 4 weeks up to 100 mg/kg. 
Two 4-week toxicity studies were conducted in rats at 
doses of 0, 1, 10 and 100 mg/kg/week, and 
0, 1, 5, 10 and 50 mg/kg/week, administered 
once weekly. Hypersensitivity reactions were observed 
in several rats, even after pretreatment with DPH. In 
addition, sporadic incidences of elevated liver enzymes 
and microscopic lesions in the stomach were observed. 
These findings were not dose or sex specific and while 
notable, are not considered related to the treatment but 
rather due to a secondary effect associated with 
hypersensitivity. 
Two studies were conducted in monkeys receiving 
13 doses up to 100 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa or 
7 doses at 200 mg/kg alglucosidase alfa once every 
other week The results showed a dose response with 
respect to the levels of rhGAA recovered in the liver 
and levels above background were still detectable at 
various time points post dose; however, no concurrent 
alteration in liver function tests or histopathology 
changes were observed.  
• Reproductive/developmental toxicity studies
A fertility and early embryonic development study was
conducted in mice at doses of 0, 10, 20, or 40 mg/kg
every other day for a minimum of 9 weeks to males and
2 weeks to females prior to cohabitation.
Hypersensitivity reactions have been documented in human 
clinical trials and during post marketing surveillance. These 
reactions have been added to the important identified risk of 
infusion-associated reactions including hypersensitivity and 
anaphylactic reactions and are included in the product label. 
They are also monitored by routine pharmacovigilance 
assessment. 
Although accumulation of rhGAA in the liver of the monkeys 
infused with 100 mg/kg and 200 mg/kg once every other week 
of alglucosidase alfa and sporadic elevations of liver enzymes 
in rodents were observed, similar elevations in liver enzymes 
attributed to rhGAA administration have only rarely been 
observed in the clinical setting. Based upon these findings, 
patients treated with rhGAA chronic dosing in the clinical 
setting should be monitored for liver enzymes prior to 
treatment initiation and periodically thereafter.  
Based on the rationale developed above, the MAH is not 
retaining this risk as relevant to human. In addition, this is 
supported by post-authorization experience. The results of the 
analysis from the patient disease registry revealed that no 
adverse events of hepatic insufficiency attributable to 
alglucosidase alfa have been reported to GPE. 
Use of alglucosidase alfa in pregnant women is considered 
missing information: reproductive toxicity at a maternal toxic 
dose was shown in rabbits but no congenital malformations 
were reported. The relevance to human is unknown. This

Relevance to human usage 
Diphenhydramine (5 mg/kg) was administered to males 
and females after the 4th and 6th dose, respectively. 
There was no test article-related effect reported on 
mating and fertility and the NOAEL was 40 mg/kg every 
other day. 
No adverse findings were observed in an embryo-fetal 
developmental toxicity study in mice. Alglucosidase alfa 
was administered at 0, 10, 20 or 40 mg/kg/day to 
rabbits from gestational day 7 through 19 DPH 
(10 mg/kg) was administered starting on the 5th day of 
dosing. Adverse clinical observations, significant 
decrease in feed and water consumption, significant 
loss of body weight were observed in all groups 
following alglucosidase alfa and/or DPH alone 
administration. Cases of abortion and early delivery 
were also observed (considered secondary to maternal 
toxicity). The maternal NOAEL including pre-treatment 
with DPH is <10 mg/kg/day. The developmental 
NOAEL is >40 mg/kg/day.  
A pre- and post-natal development study was 
conducted in female mice at 0, 0 (DPH alone), 
10, 20, or 40 mg/kg administered intravenously once 
every other day from Days 6 through 22 of presumed 
gestation or Day 20 postpartum. 
Diphenhydramine (5mg/kg) was administered 
beginning with the 5th dose. No effect on the F0 
generation was observed up to 40 mg/kg every other 
day. The NOAEL for the F0 and F1 generations was 
40 mg/kg every other day. There was an increase in 
pup deaths in the 40 mg/kg every other day maternal 
dosage group during the last week of the lactation 
period. There were no other effects on any parameter 
evaluated including clinical observations or body weight 
gain in F1 generation pups. Furthermore, no effect on 
sexual maturation, learning or memory, or the ability to 
produce another generation occurred for the 
F1 generation mice. 
• Genotoxicity
No studies have been conducted to evaluate the 
mutagenic potential of alglucosidase alfa. 
• Carcinogenicity
No studies have been conducted to evaluate the 
carcinogenic potential of alglucosidase alfa.

A 6-month IV toxicity study was conducted in juvenile 
mice with alglucosidase alfa administration starting 
21 days after birth. Standard toxicity endpoints, in 
addition to physical development and behavior, were 
evaluated. 
Doses of 0, 0 (DPH alone), 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg of 
alglucosidase alfa were administered every other week 
for 26 weeks. There were no test article-related effects, 
and the NOAEL was considered to be 50 mg/kg every 
other week.

Animal models studied in the non-clinical setting provided sufficient information for MAH to 
estimate the occurrence of certain safety risks. However, based on limitations of the animal 
models, a complete prediction of the risks in the clinical setting is not always possible. 
Based on non-clinical studies use in pregnant women is considered missing information for 
alglucosidase alfa. 
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SIII: CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
The variability of Pompe disease in terms of age at onset, rate of progression, severity, and pattern 
of systemic involvement has rendered the selection of a homogeneous clinical study population 
and an appropriate clinical endpoint challenging. 
All patients with Pompe disease currently receiving ERT are either being treated with 
alglucosidase alfa or avalglucosidase alfa.  
Despite the challenges of conducting clinical studies in patients with Pompe disease due to the 
rare nature of the disease and the young age of many of the patients, the MAH has treated patients 
with alglucosidase alfa across the entire Pompe disease spectrum under various clinical studies 
and expanded access program (EAPs) (see Figure 1). 
Figure 1   Alglucosidase alfa Treatment Initiatives Across the Pompe Disease Spectrum (Age 
Range at Initiation of Treatment)  
Note: Figure shows patient age range at treatment initiation for alglucosidase alfa studies conducted in patients who were naïve to ERT at study 
onset.  
N = number of patients providing efficacy data for the present dossier (except for Natural History Study AGLU-004-00 and observational study

a  Upon completion of AGLU01602, patients could participate in open-label extension study AGLU02403. 
b  Upon completion of AGLU02704, patients could participate in open-label extension study AGLU03206. 
c  Study AGLU04107 included 3 patients from study AGLU03105 and 5 new patients.  
ERT: Enzyme Replacement Therapy. 
The difficulty in performing clinical studies in rare diseases, particularly in children, should be 
acknowledged. Patient identification and recruitment have been challenging, and the limited drug 
supply largely determined the number of patients that could be enrolled in early clinical studies. 
Additionally, the use of placebo in clinical studies evaluating patients with the rapidly progressive 
and uniformly fatal IO form would be unethical and there are no active comparator products.  
To address the lack of suitable comparator drugs and the unethical use of a placebo in clinical 
studies evaluating patients with the rapidly progressive and uniformly fatal IO form of the disease, 
the MAH created matching historical control or reference groups for the pivotal 
AGLU01602/AGLU02403 and AGLU01702 studies by applying screening criteria based on the 
eligibility criteria for the 2 treatment studies to the 168 untreated patients with IOPD in the 
Natural History Study (AGLU-004-00). For the critical endpoints of survival, invasive 
ventilator-free survival (ie, survival free of invasive ventilation) and any ventilator-free survival 
(ie, survival free of invasive and non-invasive ventilation), results for alglucosidase alfa-treated 
patients in AGLU01602/AGLU02403 are compared to overall survival in an appropriate historical 
control group (invasive ventilation was defined as any ventilator support applied via an 
endotracheal tube or tracheostomy; non-invasive ventilation was defined as ventilator support 
applied without invasion of the airway). Similarly, 52- and 104-week survival in AGLU01702 
patients is compared with estimated survival in an appropriate historical reference group. For all 
other endpoints, efficacy and safety findings following treatment are compared to those obtained 
at Baseline or results are expressed relative to normative data. 
The clinical programme for patients with LO Pompe disease has proven no less complicated. 
Again, the lack of alternative therapies means there is no active comparator. In addition, patients 
have been enrolled at varying stages of disease progression from those in the earlier stages who 
are still ambulatory to those with advanced disease who are wheelchair-bound and require 
ventilatory assistance, and this heterogeneity often precludes the use of uniform assessments 
across studies. Further, patients with very advanced LO disease may have reached a “point of no 
return” prior to the start of therapy (ie, muscle damage has already occurred to such an extent as 
to render it resistant to treatment with ERT), and these patients are a challenging population in 
whom to demonstrate clinical efficacy of alglucosidase alfa. However, it should be emphasized 
that Pompe disease is universally progressive in nature and therefore any reversal or stabilization 
of disease during treatment is likely to be due to therapy itself, and not due to spontaneous 
resolution of the disease or normal growth and development. 
The clinical studies that provided efficacy and safety data for approval are summarized in Table 8 
below, classified by IO and LO disease. These studies include 2 pivotal studies in 39 patients with 
IOPD (AGLU01602 and its open-label extension AGLU02403, and AGLU01702) and 1 pivotal 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in 90 patients with LO Pompe disease 
(AGLU02704 and its open-label extension AGLU03206). In addition to these pivotal studies, 
several other clinical studies and (per-patient) EAPs with alglucosidase alfa have been conducted 
in patients with IO or LO Pompe disease.

CLINICAL TRIAL EXPOSURE 
Clinical trial exposure is based on the number of patients on alglucosidase alfa participating in the 
MAH sponsored clinical trials. At the time of the approval in EU there were about 277 patients 
being treated with alglucosidase alfa via clinical trials and EAPs. 
Patients with IO and LO Pompe disease have received treatment with alglucosidase alfa under one 
or more of 22 completed good clinical practices (GCP) clinical studies. Table 9 below provides a 
summary of these studies. Studies AGLU03807 and AGLU03707 are the trials that explored the 
use of Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in IOPD patients.

For the purposes of summarizing IO and LO treatment exposure in clinical studies, patient’s naive 
to rhGAA ERT prior to the first infusion of alglucosidase alfa were pooled. For the IO population, 
exposure data from studies AGLU01602/AGLU02403, AGLU01702, and AGLU02203 involving 
72 patients were pooled. For the late-onset population, exposure data from studies AGLU02603, 
AGLU02704, AGLU02804, and AGLU03105 involving 79 patients were pooled. Table 10 below 
summarizes exposure to alglucosidase alfa for patients in each pooled analysis population as well 
as combined. Of the 151 patients, 142 patients received a dose of 20 mg/kg qow alglucosidase alfa 
and 17 patients (all IO patients) received a dose of 40 mg/kg qow alglucosidase alfa. The patient 
numbers for each dose group are inclusive of eight IO patients who received both doses of 
alglucosidase alfa. Median exposure was lower in the 20 mg/kg dose group (38.5 weeks; 
78.0 infusions) compared with the 40 mg/kg dose group (52.0 weeks; 104.0 infusions), which was 
influenced in part by the short duration of exposure for many patients treated under the US 
expanded access studies, in IO (AGLU02203) and LO patients (AGLU02603), in which all 
patients received a dose of 20 mg/kg.

frequency greater than 1 in 277 could be 
detected if there were no background 
incidence. Only common and very common 
events are able to be identified during

will be identified such as immune-mediated 
reactions.

SIV.3 
LIMITATIONS IN RESPECT TO POPULATIONS TYPICALLY 
UNDER-REPRESENTED IN CLINICAL TRIAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMMES 
Pompe disease is a rare disease, with an estimated global incidence at birth of all phenotypes of 
1:40 000. (8)(9) Alglucosidase alfa received orphan drug designation in the US and Europe as 
well as several other countries. As a consequence of the rarity and fatal nature of Pompe disease, 
the number of patients treated has been limited and long-term safety data are limited. A Pompe 
registry has been established in order to enhance understanding of the variability, progression and 
natural history of the key manifestations of both IO and LO Pompe disease as well as to collect 
additional information on special populations of interest (eg, patients with renal or hepatic 
insufficiency, pregnant or lactating women). 
Table 12 - Exposure of special populations included or not in clinical trial development 
programmes

Patients with relevant 
comorbidities 
Exposure 
There are no adequate, well-controlled studies of alglucosidase alfa in pregnant 
women. Only rare reports of pregnancy in patients receiving alglucosidase alfa have 
been received, therefore, there is a limited amount of data in this sub-group of 
patients. A study in rabbits has shown the potential for maternal toxicity of 
alglucosidase alfa due to decreased feed consumption. Women of childbearing 
potential will be encouraged to enroll in the Pompe Registry. 
• Patients with hepatic or renal
Alglucosidase alfa was not studied in patients with renal or hepatic insufficiency. 
impairment 
Other 
• Pediatric use
• Geriatric use
The safety and efficacy of alglucosidase alfa have been primarily evaluated in 
children with ages ranging from infancy to adolescence. 
Long-term data in Pompe patients less than 1 year in age at initiation of treatment 
was collected as part of study AGLU03606 assessing the growth and development of 
patients treated with alglucosidase alfa over a 10 year period and the study has been 
completed see Table 9. 
Clinical studies of alglucosidase alfa included subjects as old as 70 years at initiation 
of treatment. 
• Pregnant or breastfeeding women
Pregnancy 
There is a limited amount of data from the use of alglucosidase alfa in pregnant women. 
MYOZYME should not be used during pregnancy unless the clinical condition of the woman 
requires treatment with alglucosidase alfa. 
Studies in animals have shown reproductive toxicity. 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, single and repeated dose toxicity. No significant adverse findings on embryofoetal 
development were observed in a mouse and a rabbit embryofoetal study and no significant 
adverse findings were observed in a mouse fertility and early embryonic development study. In 
the rabbit embryofoetal development study, following administration of 
MYOZYME (10-40 mg/kg/day) with co-administration of DPH, a treatment-related increase in 
the incidence of abortions and early delivery was observed. This effect was partly attributable to 
maternal toxicity, as a significant decrease in feed consumption and body weight gain was 
observed. 
A pre- and post-natal development study was conducted in female mice at doses up to 40 mg/kg 
alglucosidase alfa administered intravenously once every other day on days 6 through 22 of 
presumed gestation or day 20 postpartum. Diphenhydramine (5 mg/kg) was administered 
intraperitoneally beginning with the 5th dose. There were no adverse effects on the F0 generation. 
An increase in pup deaths occurred in the 40 mg/kg/day group during the last week of the 
lactation period. However, the relationship of these deaths to treatment is unclear as no other 
effects were observed on any parameter evaluated including clinical observations or body weight 
gain in F1 generation pups. Furthermore, no effect on sexual maturation, learning or memory, or 
fertility occurred for the F1 generation mice. The NOAEL for the F0 and F1 generations was 
40 mg/kg/day. 
Breastfeeding 
Limited data suggest that alglucosidase alfa is excreted in breast milk in very low concentrations. 
No clinical effect is expected in a breastfed infant due to low breast milk transfer and poor 
bioavailability. Breastfeeding during treatment with MYOZYME may therefore be considered. As 
a precautionary measure, breastfeeding interruption for the first 24 hours after treatment may be 
considered.  
As limited data are available concerning the use of alglucosidase alfa in pregnant or breastfeeding 
women, the use of alglucosidase alfa in pregnant or breastfeeding women is considered as missing 
information. Women of childbearing potential and women who choose to nurse while continuing 
alglucosidase alfa therapy will be requested to participate in the Pompe Registry. As part of the 
Pompe Registry, sub-registries evaluating the effect of alglucosidase alfa on pregnancy and 
lactation have been established. The pregnant women in the registry will be encouraged to join the 
Pregnancy sub-registry. The women in the registry who want to nurse while on treatment with 
alglucosidase alfa are encouraged to join in the Lactation sub-registry 
• Patients with renal or hepatic impairment
The safety of alglucosidase alfa in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been 
evaluated. Based upon its route of metabolism (peptide hydrolysis) and experience with other 
ERTs, it is not anticipated that renal or hepatic impairment will impact its use. For the same 
reasons, a change in the recommended dose is not anticipated in these sub-populations.  
Due to limited data, use in patients with renal or hepatic impairment is considered as missing 
information. Healthcare providers are encouraged to enroll patients in the Pompe Registry where 
information on patients with renal and hepatic insufficiency will be analyzed annually and results 
submitted to regulatory authorities. 
• Geriatric use
It is not expected that geriatric patients will respond differently to alglucosidase alfa treatment 
when compared to younger patients. Based upon the route of metabolism of alglucosidase alfa 
(peptide hydrolysis) and experience with other ERTs, the MAH does not anticipate that renal or 
hepatic impairment in the geriatric population will impact the safety and efficacy of alglucosidase 
alfa. However, clinical studies completed to date did not include a sufficient number of subjects 
aged 65 years and older in order to evaluate the safety and efficacy of alglucosidase alfa in this 
population. Due to limited data, use in elderly patients is considered as missing information.  
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SV: POST-AUTHORIZATION 
EXPERIENCE  
SV.1 
POST-AUTHORIZATION EXPOSURE 
SV.1.1  Method used to calculate exposure  
In the postmarketing setting, the total number of patients treated with alglucosidase alfa was 
calculated from sales figures received from the MAH regional offices, on the basis of direct 
interaction with prescribing physicians. 
SV.1.2 
Exposure 
MYOZYME (alglucosidase alfa) received authorization in the EU on 29 March 2006 and in the 
US on 28 April 2006. Alglucosidase alfa is authorized in 88 countries worldwide. In addition, 
patients received commercial alglucosidase alfa via an International Charitable Access Program 
(ICAP), therefore, the number of patients treated each month also includes ICAP.  
An internal sales database has been used as the source for exposure data retrieval. 
Due to the rarity of Pompe disease, the MAH has access to the actual patient exposure on a 
monthly basis.  
The number of patients on treatment in any given month is an estimate based on our country 
office’s local knowledge of the country’s health care environment. The office provides its 
estimate to our global team on an aggregate basis received from the patient support programs, 
field liaisons or sales team in accordance with local laws, and never includes in its report data that 
could allow identification of individual patients; therefore, presentation of patient exposure by 
age, sex, and indication is not possible. The monthly exposure data allows for systematic and 
consistent exposure calculations over time which most reliably reflect exposure. 
Patients treated with alglucosidase alfa often receive treatment over multiple months. Therefore, 
when determining the cumulative number of patients exposed during the reporting period, the 
cumulative exposure is chosen to be the month with the most patients treated. Cumulative patient 
exposure to alglucosidase alfa since product launch through 30 September 2022 was estimated to 
be 3564 patients (greatest monthly patient exposure in the cumulative experience). Of note, these 
figures are net patient per month figures: if a patient dies or stops treatment, this patient is 
deducted from the reporting; if a naive patient starts therapy or a former patient restarts therapy, 
this patient is added to the reporting. 
The estimated cumulative patient commercial and charitable exposure per periodic safety update 
report (PSUR)/periodic benefit-risk evaluation report (PBRER) reporting period since 
international birth date is presented in Table 13

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SVI: ADDITIONAL EU 
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE SAFETY SPECIFICATION  
SVI.1 
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
The legal status of alglucosidase alfa will control who will dispense, prepare and/or administer the 
drug; dispensation, preparation and administration is restricted to appropriate HCPs, including 
pharmacists and physicians. The administration of alglucosidase alfa will take place in a hospital 
or clinical setting under the close supervision of a physician experienced in the management of 
patients with Pompe disease or other inherited metabolic or neuromuscular diseases to minimize 
potential errors during the preparation and administration of the drug. The product label includes 
specific language concerning preparation and administration of alglucosidase alfa. 
Potential for misuse of alglucosidase alfa for illegal purposes is considered low as this product is 
not known to have attributes that make it a candidate for intentional overdose, abuse, or illegal 
use, such as known pharmacological addictive effects.

SVII.2 
NEW SAFETY CONCERNS AND RECLASSIFICATION WITH A SUBMISSION OF 
AN UPDATED RMP  
From RMP version 10 onwards, the three important identified risks, “Infusion associated reactions 
including hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions”, “Immunogenicity: anti-rhGAA 
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies”, and “Immunogenicity: anti-rhGAA Immunoglobulin E 
(IgE) antibodies” are combined to a single important identified risk - “Infusion associated 
reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, with or without development of 
IgG and IgE antibodies”. This is to include IgE or IgG mediated mechanisms causing the infusion 
associated reactions including hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions.  
Important identified risk “Immunogenicity: inhibitory antibodies to rhGAA” is renamed to 
“Immunogenicity leading to loss of response (High sustained IgG antibody titres and or 
neutralizing antibodies)” indicating the clinical impact as a consequence to the occurrence of 
these antibodies. 
, the MAH was 
requested to consider whether existing data might support safe administration of alglucosidase 
alfa in the home infusion setting and discuss the appropriateness of label amendments and 
aRMMs to provide guidance to HCPs and patients in this regard (along with the submission of a 
RMP update). As for the other ERTs for which home infusion is possible, there is a possible risk 
of medication errors in the home infusion setting due to insufficient understanding of the 
instructions for use of the product (eg, dose calculation, reconstitution, administration). Hence, the 
MAH proposes to include “Medication errors in the home infusion setting” as an important 
potential risk. 
SVII.3 
DETAILS OF IMPORTANT IDENTIFIED RISKS, IMPORTANT POTENTIAL RISKS, 
AND MISSING INFORMATION  
Identified safety risks of alglucosidase alfa treatment include development of infusion associated 
reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, with or without development of 
IgG and IgE antibodies; immune mediated reactions; and immunogenicity leading to loss of 
response (High sustained IgG antibody titres and/or neutralizing antibodies). Each of these 
identified alglucosidase alfa-related safety risks, the additional potential risk of medication errors 
in the home infusion setting and the missing information, are discussed in the sections below.

anaphylactic reactions, with or without development of IgG and IgE 
antibodies 
Alglucosidase alfa is a biological medicinal product produced in a CHO production 
system. Potential mechanisms for infusion associated reactions including 
hypersensitivity/anaphylactic reactions include: 
• IgE mediated
• IgG mediated with complement activation
• Cytokine release but the mechanism is unclear
• Nonspecific immunogenic mechanism which is not understood to date
• Direct stimulation of mast cells by drug with release of histamine
• Related to higher infusion rate, ie, protein load
Possible factors associated with the induction of rhGAA IgG Antibody: Foreignness of 
rhGAA (recognized as non-self protein), chemical complexity, route, frequency, and 
dose of administration.  
Induction of the antibody response involved the following steps: 
• Immune recognition-antigen associated with major histocompatibility complex
molecule is recognized as non-self by the immunocompetent cells.
• Stimulation of B-lymphocyte response by complex interactions between T, B and
accessory cells.
• Continuing proliferation and differentiation of B cells into plasma cells by several
cytokines.
• Plasma cells produce antibody specific to rhGAA.
Clinical trial, postmarketing surveillance, literature. 
Frequency with 95% CI 
Infusion associated reactions occurred in approximately 50% of patients treated with 
alglucosidase alfa in two IO clinical studies for 52 weeks. In an 18 month, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical study of LO patients, approximately 28% of 
patients in the alglucosidase alfa treatment group experienced IARs. The occurrence of 
IARs is not unexpected given the clinical presentation of immunogenic responses to 
recombinant human proteins. (29) In clinical trials with alglucosidase alfa, approximately 
3% of patients experienced severe or significant hypersensitivity reactions, including 
life-threatening anaphylactic shock and cardiac arrest. In the LO treatment

anaphylactic reactions, with or without development of IgG and IgE 
antibodies 
study (AGLU2704), three serious hypersensitivity reactions in the alglucosidase alfa 
treatment group occurred, in two of these patients reactions were IgE mediated. It is not 
possible to reliably estimate the frequency of the infusion associated reactions reported 
in the post-marketing, expanded access programs and non-controlled clinical studies as 
these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size. 
In clinical studies, the majority (approximately 90%) of IO and LO Pompe patients 
developed IgG antibodies to alglucosidase alfa, generally within 3 months of initiation of 
treatment. Similar proportions of patients treated in the commercial setting have 
developed anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies. 
Patients treated with alglucosidase alfa in clinical studies or the commercial setting have 
tested positive for alglucosidase alfa-specific IgE antibodies, some of whom 
experienced anaphylactic reactions. Testing was typically performed for IARs, 
especially moderate to severe or recurrent reactions. Skin testing, a more sensitive 
measure for detection of IgE antibodies, was also performed for some patients. 
Severity and nature of risk 
Infusion associated reactions occur at any time during, and mostly up to 2 hours after 
the infusion of alglucosidase alfa, and are more likely to occur with higher infusion rates. 
The majority of reactions were assessed as mild or moderate; some reactions were 
assessed as severe. Severe infusion reactions reported in more than 1 patient included 
pyrexia, decreased oxygen saturation, tachycardia, cyanosis and hypotension. A single 
event of angioedema of severe intensity has been reported. 
In postmarketing settings: IARs assessed as severe included anaphylactic shock, 
cardiac arrest, bradycardia, tachycardia, cyanosis, chest pain, respiratory arrest, 
apnoea, respiratory distress, bronchospasm, tachypnoea, hypoxia, stridor, dyspnoea, 
cough, wheezing, abdominal pain, pyrexia, chills, erythema, rash, headache, tremor, 
agitation, hypertension, hypotension, vasoconstriction, pallor, face oedema, peripheral 
coldness, and hyperhidrosis.  
Reactions generally occurred shortly after initiation of the infusion. Patients presented 
with a constellation of signs and symptoms, primarily respiratory, cardiovascular, 
oedematous, and/or cutaneous in nature. Reactions included bronchospasm, wheezing, 
respiratory arrest, respiratory distress, apnoea, stridor, dyspnoea, decrease in oxygen 
saturation, brief episodes of cardiac arrest, hypotension, bradycardia, tachycardia, 
cyanosis, vasoconstriction, flushing, chest pain, chest discomfort, throat tightness, 
angioedema, pharyngeal oedema, face oedema, peripheral oedema, urticaria, and rash. 
Recurrent reactions consisting of flu-like illness or a combination of events such as 
fever, chills, myalgia, arthralgia, pain, or fatigue occurring post-infusion a few hours to 
2 days following the infusion and lasting usually for a few days, have also been 
observed in some patients treated with alglucosidase alfa (predominantly in LO Pompe 
patients). The majority of patients were successfully re-challenged with alglucosidase 
alfa using lower doses and/or pretreatment with anti-inflammatory drugs and/or 
corticosteroids and have continued to receive treatment under close clinical supervision. 
In clinical studies, the majority of patients (approximately 90%) developed IgG 
antibodies to rhGAA typically within 3 months of treatment. A tendency was observed 
for IO patients treated with a higher dose (40 mg/kg) to develop higher titres of IgG 
antibodies. There was no consistent relationship between time to seroconversion and 
onset of IARs. Infantile-onset patients who develop high antibody titres appear to be at 
higher risk for developing more frequent IARs. In the LO study there was no apparent 
association between higher IgG titres and occurrence of IARs. A limited number of the 
IgG positive patients evaluated tested positive for inhibitory effects on in vitro testing. 
The probability of developing HSATs and poor outcome appears higher among CRIM

antibodies 
negative patients than among CRIM positive patients (patients in whom endogenous 
GAA protein was detected by Western blot analysis). However, high and sustained 
antibody titres also occur in some CRIM positive patients. The cause of a poor clinical 
outcome in some of these patients is thought to be multifactorial.  
In clinical studies of IO and LO Pompe patients, a trend toward decreasing IgG antibody 
titres over time was observed in the majority of patients. In the LO treatment extension 
study (AGLU03206), 60% of patients in the alglucosidase alfa treatment group showed 
trends toward decreasing titres while on treatment. 
Patients who develop IgE antibodies to alglucosidase alfa appear to be at a higher risk 
for the occurrence of IARs and/or anaphylactic reactions when alglucosidase alfa is 
readministered. Therefore, these patients should be monitored more closely during 
administration of alglucosidase alfa. Some IgE positive patients were successfully 
rechallenged with alglucosidase alfa using a slower infusion rate at lower initial doses 
(or desensitization procedures) and have continued to receive alglucosidase alfa under 
close clinical supervision. 
Seriousness/outcomes 
Infusion associated reactions which were reported in more than one patient in clinical 
studies and the EAP included rash, flushing, urticaria, pyrexia, cough, tachycardia, 
decreased oxygen saturation, vomiting, tachypnoea, agitation, increased blood 
pressure, cyanosis, hypertension, irritability, pallor, pruritus, retching, rigors, tremor, 
hypotension, bronchospasm, erythema, face oedema, feeling hot, headache, 
hyperhidrosis, lacrimation increased, livedo reticularis, nausea, periorbital oedema, 
restlessness, wheezing, non-cardiac chest pain, angioedema, and supraventricular 
tachycardia. The infusion associated reactions reported additionally in the commercial 
setting included conjunctivitis, abdominal pain, dyspepsia, dysphagia, palmar erythema, 
transient skin discolouration, blister, peripheral coldness and infusion site reactions 
including pain, swelling, induration, extravasation and erythema. (30) All these infusion 
associated reactions in clinical & commercial settings were reported as serious except 
for decreased oxygen saturation, increased blood pressure & rigors. 
The most serious adverse reactions reported with alglucosidase alfa were anaphylactic 
reactions, and cardiac arrest. In the commercial setting, significant hypersensitivity 
reactions have been reported in both IO and LO patients treated with alglucosidase alfa. 
Some patients experienced life threatening anaphylactic reactions, including 
anaphylactic shock, some of which were IgE-mediated. 
In the clinical development program for alglucosidase alfa, development of anti-rhGAA 
IgG antibodies was monitored using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with 
results confirmed by radioimmunoprecipitation assay. In clinical studies, the majority of 
IO and LO Pompe patients developed IgG antibodies to alglucosidase alfa, generally 
within 3 months of initiation of treatment. Similar proportions of patients treated in the 
commercial setting have developed anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies. Time to first detection of 
IgG antibodies in commercially treated patients has been similar to that observed in 
clinical studies. The development of antibodies against recombinant protein is well 
recognized and has been demonstrated with other ERT. (29) 
A small number of alglucosidase alfa treated patients in clinical trials and postmarketing 
setting who were evaluated, tested positive for presence of alglucosidase alfa-specific 
IgE antibodies. Some of these patients experienced anaphylaxis. Patients who develop 
IgE antibodies to alglucosidase alfa appear to be at a higher risk for the occurrence of 
infusion reactions and/or anaphylactic reactions. Therefore, these patients should be 
monitored more closely during administration of alglucosidase alfa.

Infusion associated reactions including hypersensitivity and

Background incidence/prevalence 
Infusion associated reactions including hypersensitivity and development of anti-rhGAA 
IgG or anti-rhGAA IgE antibodies are specific to the biologic product and do not occur in 
patients with Pompe disease who are not intravenously exposed to the product. 
Impact on individual patient 
The majority of IARs were mild to moderate and resolved spontaneously with infusion 
rate reduction, infusion interruption or administration of antihistamines and/or 
corticosteroids. Some reactions were severe. The most serious adverse reactions 
reported with alglucosidase alfa were anaphylactic reactions, or cardiac arrest. Some 
patients experienced severe or life-threatening anaphylactic reactions, anaphylactic 
shock, and cardiac arrest including anaphylactic shock, some of which were 
IgE-mediated. These reactions were generally managed with temporary interruption 
and/or discontinuation of infusion and administration of antihistamines, corticosteroids, 
IV fluids, and/or oxygen, when clinically indicated. In some cases of anaphylactic 
reaction and cardiac arrest, epinephrine and/or cardiopulmonary resuscitation were also 
administered. The majority of patients continued to receive treatment with alglucosidase 
alfa, under close clinical supervision. 
Infantile-onset patients who develop high antibody titres appear to be at higher risk for 
developing more frequent IARs and hypersensitivity. Conversely, not all patients with 
symptoms of hypersensitivity have detectable IgG antibody titres. Patients with an acute 
illness (eg, acute febrile illness, such as pneumonia or sepsis, or 
wheezing/bronchospasm) at the time of alglucosidase alfa infusion appear to be at 
greater risk for IARs. Patients with advanced Pompe disease or compromised cardiac 
and/or respiratory function may be at risk of serious exacerbation of their cardiac or 
respiratory compromise during infusions. Patients treated with higher doses of 
alglucosidase alfa (>20 mg/kg) tended to develop a more robust IgG antibody response 
and experience more IARs. Patients who have experienced infusion reactions may be 
at increased risk of IARs when alglucosidase alfa is readministered. Additionally, IgE 
positive patients are at increased risk of developing IARs upon readministering the drug. 
In the LO study, there was no apparent association between higher IgG antibody titres 
and occurrence of IARs. 
It is recommended that patients be monitored for IgG antibody formation periodically. 
Baseline serum sample collection prior to the first infusion is encouraged. For IOPD 
patients, regular monitoring during first year of treatment (example: every 3 months) is 
suggested and subsequent monitoring dependent on clinical outcomes and antibody 
titre levels. For LOPD patients, antibody development should be assessed within 
6 months and subsequent monitoring as clinically warranted based on safety and 
efficacy considerations.  
The probability of developing HSATs and poor outcome appears higher among 
CRIM-negative patients (patients in whom no endogenous GAA protein was detected by 
western blot analysis) than among CRIM-positive patients (patients in whom 
endogenous GAA protein was detected by western blot analysis). However, high and 
sustained antibody titres also occur in some CRIM-positive patients. The cause of a 
poor clinical outcome in some of these patients is thought to be multifactorial. 
It is unknown who will develop immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IgE positive) to 
alglucosidase alfa. 
Some patients received pretreatment with antihistamines, antipyretics, and/or steroids 
as a result of IARs. Infusion associated reactions may occur in patients after receiving 
pretreatment with antipyretics, antihistamines, or steroids. If an IAR occurs, regardless

of pretreatment, decreasing the infusion rate, temporarily stopping the infusion, and/or 
administration of antihistamines and/or antipyretics may ameliorate the symptoms. To 
prevent complications, immediate discontinuation of the administration of alglucosidase 
alfa should be considered when severe infusion reactions occur, and appropriate 
medical treatment should be initiated. Because of the potential for severe 
hypersensitivity reactions, appropriate medical support measures, including 
cardiopulmonary resuscitation equipment, should be readily available when 
alglucosidase alfa is administered. Patients who have experienced IARs (and in 
particular anaphylactic reactions) should be treated with caution when readministered 
alglucosidase alfa.  
Careful consideration should be given to the patient’s clinical status prior to 
administration of alglucosidase alfa. 
Prophylactic treatment with antihistamines prior to the infusions is recommended to 
reduce the frequency and or severity of IARs. 
Patients with moderate to severe and recurrent IARs should be evaluated for 
alglucosidase alfa specific IgE antibodies, and skin testing is recommended for patients 
who experienced significant hypersensitivity reactions. 
The majority of IARs were mild to moderate and resolved spontaneously with infusion 
rate reduction, infusion interruption or administration of antihistamines and/or 
corticosteroids. Some reactions were severe. The most serious adverse reactions 
reported with alglucosidase alfa were anaphylactic reactions, or cardiac arrest. Some 
patients experienced severe or life-threatening anaphylactic reactions, anaphylactic 
shock, and cardiac arrest including anaphylactic shock, some of which were 
IgE-mediated. These reactions were generally managed with temporary interruption 
and/or discontinuation of infusion and administration of antihistamines, corticosteroids, 
IV fluids, and/or oxygen, when clinically indicated. In some cases of anaphylactic 
reaction and cardiac arrest, epinephrine and/or cardiopulmonary resuscitation were also 
administered. The majority of patients continued to receive treatment with alglucosidase 
alfa, under close clinical supervision to prevent disease progression. 
The benefit-risk balance of ERT with alglucosidase alfa remains positive for mild IARs. 
Due to the negative impact of severe, serious and life-threatening IARs on the 
benefit-risk balance of ERT with alglucosidase alfa, permanent discontinuation of ERT 
with alglucosidase alfa may be required. 
Public health impact 
Given the extremely small number of Pompe patients, IARs and development of 
antibodies in relation to alglucosidase alfa treatment has a negligible public health 
impact.

our bodies. Circulating immune complexes are usually cleared by phagocytic system. In 
some cases where the massive formation of circulating immune complexes is present 
and the clearance capacity of the phagocytic system is exceeded, the deposition of 
these immune complexes in tissues will trigger the inflammation reactions. Small 
immune complexes formed in antigen excess are easily filtered from the circulation by 
macrophages without triggering further inflammation. In the next phase of slight antigen 
excess, intermediate sized immune complexes form. These intermediate sized immune 
complexes are large enough to active complement and small enough to cross the 
endothelial barrier leading to tissue inflammation (skin, myocardium, joints, and kidney). 
Immune mediated syndromes may result in a heterogeneous array of clinical signs and 
symptoms such as glomerulonephritis, haematuria, proteinuria, papular rash, purpura 
like eruptions, arthritis, serositis, and vasculitis. Reactions are self-limited and usually 
develop within 7 to 10 days of antigen injection, starting with some constitutional flu like 
symptoms of fever, myalgia, arthralgia, and rash. Clinical recovery is usually apparent 
after 7 to 28 days, as intermediate sized immune complexes are cleared by the 
reticuloendothelial system. Free antigen continues to clear from the blood, leading to 
antibody excess, and the formation of large immune complexes, which are quickly 
removed by circulating macrophages. Finally, the antigen is no longer detectable, and 
the level of circulating antibodies continues to rise. 
Nonclinical trials, clinical trial, postmarketing surveillance, literature. 
Frequency with 95% CI 
Uncommon reports (<1/100 to ≥1/1000) of severe cutaneous and systemic immune 
mediated reactions have been reported in a small number of patients treated with 
alglucosidase alfa. These reactions occurred several weeks to 3 years after initiation of 
alglucosidase alfa infusions. Severe cutaneous reactions, possibly immune mediated, 
have been reported with alglucosidase alfa including ulcerative and necrotizing skin 
lesions. Skin biopsy in one patient demonstrated deposition of anti-rhGAA antibodies in 
the lesion. Systemic immune mediated reactions, including possible type III immune 
mediated reactions have been observed with alglucosidase alfa. Nephrotic syndrome 
was observed in a few Pompe patients treated with alglucosidase alfa and who had high 
IgG antibody titres. In these patients’ renal biopsy showed immune complex deposition. 
Patients improved following treatment interruption. It is therefore recommended to 
perform periodic urinalysis among patients with high IgG antibody titres.

To identify any potential immune complex mediated reactions to alglucosidase alfa in 
the Global safety database, all adverse events reported in patients treated with 
alglucosidase alfa cumulatively through RMP DLP were examined to identify events that 
might be mediated by immune complex deposition, with particular emphasis on renal 
disorders, skin disorders, and arthralgias and other arthropathies. Case reports with the

and additionally standardized MedDRA queries of severe cutaneous adverse reactions 
and vasculitis were included. A medical review of these cases which included all 
relevant medical history and available immunogenicity data was performed by Global 
Pharmacovigilance to determine whether the events were consistent with an 
immune-mediated syndrome. Following alglucosidase alfa treatment in clinical trials or 
commercial settings, twelve patients on alglucosidase alfa and 1 patient on Synpac 
rhGAA (33) experienced reactions suggestive of immune mediated reactions described 
as nephrotic syndrome and membranous nephropathy (1 patient); nephrotic syndrome, 
glomerulonephritis membranous and proteinuria (1 patient); nephrotic syndrome &

reaction (1 patient); inflammatory arthropathy, fever, lymphadenopathy and increased 
sedimentation rate (1 patient), and skin necrosis (1 patient) and the IO patient on 
Synpac rhGAA experienced nephrotic syndrome.  
Six of the 13 patients were IO patients including 3 CRIM negative patients. Age range 
was 7 months to 9 years; 4 male and 2 female. Six of the 13 patients were adult 
patients (2 were described as an IO) and one was adolescent, 4 males, and 3 females. 
Age range was 22 to 51 years. Therapy duration prior to events onset ranged from a 
few weeks to 3 years. IgG antibody titres ranged from 1600 to 3 276 800 with median 
titre of 102 400. C1q binding assay was positive in 4 patients at 1 or more time points 
(including baseline in one patient), negative in 2 patients and not tested in 3 patients. Of 
the 9 patients, 4 patients discontinued treatment due to decreased response to 
treatment or infusion reactions. Three of the four patients that discontinued 
subsequently died: 1 due to cardiac arrest assessed as unrelated, 1 due to skin 
necrosis assessed as unrelated, and the third patient died due to multiorgan failure, and 
the causality was not provided. In 6 patients, including the patient on Synpac rhGAA, 
the reactions resolved with temporary interruption of therapy, reducing the dose of 
biweekly infusions or use of corticosteroids and patients continued to receive therapy. 
Background incidence/prevalence 
Development of immune complex disease to rhGAA is an antigen antibody reaction that 
occurs as a result of exposure to specific antigen or biologic product and does not occur 
in patients with Pompe disease who are not intravenously exposed to the product. 
Impact on individual patient 
Immune mediated syndromes may result in a heterogeneous array of clinical signs and 
symptoms such as glomerulonephritis, haematuria, proteinuria, papular rash, purpura 
like eruptions, arthritis, serositis, and vasculitis. Reactions are self-limited and usually 
develop within 7 to 10 days of antigen injection. Clinical recovery is usually apparent 
after 7 to 28 days. Some patients have been successfully rechallenged with 
alglucosidase alfa and continued to receive alglucosidase alfa under close clinical 
supervision. 
Unknown 
Patients should be monitored for the development of systemic immune-mediated

Temporary interruption of treatment until resolution and/or reducing the dose of 
alglucosidase alfa as well as corticosteroids was used in some patients. These 
measures were successful in resolving some of the immune-mediated reactions. 
Most patients with these reactions (5/9) are IOPD, three of whom were known to be 
CRIM negative. Based on these observations CRIM negative IOPD patients may have 
excess predisposition for this potential risk. Since CRIM negative IOPD patients also 
have the poorest prognosis among Pompe disease patients if untreated, the benefit of 
ERT with alglucosidase alfa outweighs the uncommon potential risk of immune complex 
mediated reactions. 
Public health impact 
Given the extremely small number of Pompe patients, immune complex disorders in 
relation to alglucosidase alfa treatment has a negligible public health impact.

The probability of developing HSATs and poor outcome appears higher among 
CRIM-negative patients (patients in whom no endogenous GAA protein was detected by 
western blot analysis) than among CRIM-positive patients (patients in whom 
endogenous GAA protein was detected by western blot analysis). However, high and 
sustained antibody titres also occur in some CRIM-positive patients.  
In the commercial setting, some patients reported high sustained IgG antibody titres and 
neutralizing antibodies to alglucosidase alfa leading to loss of response and worsening 
of Pompe disease. 
The retrospective analysis by Kishnani et al (2010) of 32 patients with IOPD treated with 
alglucosidase alfa 20 mg/kg or 40 mg/kg/2 weeks for 52 weeks, which included 
11 CRIM negative and 21 CRIM-positive patients showed 6 CRIM-negative status was 
associated with earlier seroconversion after ERT initiation (100% by 4 weeks) than 
CRIM-positive status (90% by 12.7 weeks on average) and higher titre levels at 
24 weeks (median of 51 200 versus 600, respectively) and at 52 weeks 
(153 600 versus 200, respectively). In the CRIM-negative group, antibody titres were 
sustained at higher levels and appear to play a role in the clinical decline in these 
patients. Three of the 5 CRIM-positive patients who did poorly (ie, died or were 
invasively ventilated) had peak titres of 12 800, 25 600, or 51 200. (34) 
A chart review by Berrier et al (2015) of 20 CRIM-negative patients, found that the 
development of high and sustained antibody titres in 13 of the 17 patients who 
seroconverted after ERT initiation was associated with lower ventilator-free and overall 
survival compared to 4 patients with sustained intermediate titres and 3 patients with 
low titres. (35) 
The cause of a poor clinical outcome in some of these patients is thought to be 
multifactorial.

Severity and nature of risk 
A small number of the IgG positive patients evaluated tested positive for inhibitory 
effects on in vitro testing.  
Seriousness/outcomes 
In clinical studies, samples testing positive for anti-rhGAA IgG antibodies were also 
tested for in vitro inhibition by both enzyme activity and cellular uptake assay. Testing in 
the commercial setting may have also occurred in patients who demonstrated clinical 
decline and/or became invasively ventilated. It is recommended that treated patients be 
tested for neutralization of enzyme uptake or activity if they experience a decrease in 
clinical benefit despite continued treatment with alglucosidase alfa.  
To measure inhibition of rhGAA enzymatic activity by antibody present in patient serum, 
patient samples that had percentage inhibition greater than 20% at any sera dilutions 
were considered positive by inhibitory antibody assay (enzyme activity). A flow 
cytometry based assay was developed to evaluate whether patient antibodies interfere 
with uptake of rhGAA by human fibroblast cells in culture. Samples that had enzyme 
uptake inhibition greater than 20% at two or more sera dilutions were considered 
positive at that time point by the flow cytometry cell-based assay. In the LO study, 
patients with positive inhibition generally had higher IgG titres than those who tested 
negative; however, there was no consistent relationship between patients experiencing 
adverse events or IARs and inhibitory antibody status. 
Background incidence/prevalence 
Development of inhibitory antibodies to rhGAA are specific to the biologic product and 
do not occur in patients with Pompe disease who are not intravenously exposed to the 
product. 
Impact on individual patient 
Some patients who develop high and sustained IgG antibody titres, including 
CRIM-negative patients may experience reduced clinical alglucosidase alfa treatment 
efficacy. The cause of a poor clinical response in some of these patients is thought to 
be multi-factorial.  
The development of HSAT have been shown in alglucosidase alfa treated patients to 
have poor outcome. HSAT were defined as titres ≥51 200 at or beyond 6 months on 
ERT. Such prolonged high ADA levels could result in suboptimal dosing of drug to 
patients due to immune complex formation. Neutralizing antibodies, particularly those 
inhibit drug cellular uptake, have developed in some IOPD patients treated with 
alglucosidase alfa and generally were associated with high ADA titres. CRIM-negative 
IOPD patients are at risk for developing HSAT and neutralizing antibodies with 
documented loss of clinical response. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Patients with positive uptake inhibition generally had higher IgG antibody titres than 
patients who remained negative for uptake inhibition in IO and LO studies. 
The presence or absence of endogenous enzyme, reported as CRIM status, is a known 
risk factor. For patients with IOPD, the major risk group is CRIM-negative patients who 
do not produce any endogenous enzyme. If not given prophylactic immune tolerance 
induction, these patients develop high and sustained ADA titres, as well as neutralizing 
antibodies when treated with alglucosidase alfa, which contribute to poor clinical 
outcomes.  
Patients with LOPD produce low levels of endogenous enzyme and are considered 
CRIM-positive. These patients are generally not at risk for developing HSAT and very 
few make high ADA titres which then decrease over time. 
Identified Risk 
Immunogenicity leading to loss of response (High sustained IgG 
antibody titres and or neutralizing antibodies) 
Preventability 
Prophylactic treatment /induction of immune tolerance. 
Impact on the benefit-risk 
balance of the product 
Given the small percentage of patients (2%) tested positive for both inhibitor of enzyme 
activity and cellular uptake, the benefit-risk balance remains positive for patients who 
experience this potential risk. 
Public health impact 
Given the extremely small number of Pompe patients, development of antibodies in 
relation to alglucosidase alfa treatment has a negligible public health impact.

 Table 17   Potential risk: Medication errors in the home infusion setting 
Potential Risk 
Medication errors in the home infusion setting 
Potential mechanism 
Insufficient understanding of the instructions for use of the product (eg, dose calculation, 
reconstitution, administration). 
Evidence source(s) 
and strength of 
evidence 
Characterization of 
the risk 
It is expected and understood that the HCPs administering alglucosidase alfa in the home 
setting are experienced in the management of Pompe disease, as well as in the management 
of other ERTs. 
In the “Home infusion report” provided by the EMC expert center, where MYOZYME is 
routinely administered in the home setting as standard practice, the data confirmed that few 
IARs were identified associated with the administration of MYOZYME, similarly to the hospital 
set-up. No severe IARs were reported in the home setting, the majority of IARs were mild in 
intensity and did not necessitate advanced clinical intervention. (36)(37)(38) 
The MAH Global safety database was searched to identify all adverse events reported in 
association with alglucosidase alfa use in the home setting. As of 01-Jun-2023, 2806 (6.2%) 
adverse events were reported with home infusions. The adverse events reported during home 
infusions were largely from the Netherlands, Canada and the US. The patients were mostly 
adults with a mean age of 36.6 years and similarly reported by males and females. The 
medication errors reported in the home infusion setting were nonserious and similar to the 
commonly reported medication errors for alglucosidase alfa (ie, inline filter not used, 
dose/frequency changes, etc.). Overall, the adverse events including IARs and hypersensitivity 
reactions occurring with the home infusion are consistent with the known safety profile of 
alglucosidase alfa, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the known complications of Pompe 
disease and therefore, do not raise any new safety concerns.  
However, as for other ERTs for which the home infusion is possible, there is a possible risk of 
medication errors in the home infusion setting, linked to insufficient understanding of the 
instructions for use of the product (eg, dose calculation, reconstitution, administration). 
Considering these facts, the MAH proposes to include “Medication errors in the home infusion 
setting” as an important potential risk in the RMP. 
Frequency with 95% CI: 
In the “Home infusion report” provided by the EMC expert center, where MYOZYME is 
routinely administered in the home setting as standard practice, the data confirmed that few 
IARs were identified associated with the administration of MYOZYME, similarly to the hospital 
set-up. No severe IARs were reported in the home setting, the majority of IARs were mild in 
intensity and did not necessitate advanced clinical intervention. 
Potential Risk 
Medication errors in the home infusion setting 
The MAH Global safety database analysis showed 2806 (6.2%) adverse events were reported 
in association with alglucosidase alfa use in the home setting and of these, 177 (6.3%) were 
reports of medication errors.  
Severity and nature of risk: 
Medication errors may be more likely to occur in the home setting because of potential 
insufficient understanding of the instructions for use of the product. 
In the MAH Global safety database, medication error reports with home infusion were related 
mostly to inline filter not used, dose/frequency changes, infusion administration issues, etc. 
Seriousness/outcomes: 
Insufficient understanding of the instructions for use may result in medication errors in the 
home infusion setting.  
In the MAH Global safety database, all of the medication errors reported with alglucosidase 
alfa use in the home setting were non-serious. The majority of adverse events and IARs were 
nonserious.  
Background incidence/prevalence: 
Not applicable 
Impact on individual patient: 
In the “Home infusion report” provided by the EMC expert center, the data confirmed that few 
IARs were identified associated with the administration of MYOZYME, similarly to the hospital 
set-up. No severe IARs were reported in the home setting, the majority of the IARs were mild 
in intensity and did not necessitate advanced clinical intervention. 
The MAH Global safety database analyses and literature review did not identify any new 
safety concerns regarding the administration of alglucosidase alfa in the home setting. The 
medication errors were related to inline filter not used, dose/frequency changes, infusion 
administration issues, etc. which could potentially occur regardless of the infusion setting. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Unknown 
Preventability 
Recommendations regarding home infusion administration, are described in SmPC 
sections 4.2 and 6.6 with detailed instruction on risk mitigation including eligibility of patients 
for home infusion, and on reconstitution, dose calculation, infusion preparation and 
administration. 
Educational material in the form of an HCP guide is also proposed. This guide will provide 
clear instruction for the preparation, reconstitution, and administration of alglucosidase alfa at 
home to prevent the medication errors, as well as the recognition and management of the 
important identified risk “Infusion associated reactions”. 
Impact on the 
benefit-risk balance 
of the product 
Enzyme replacement therapy with alglucosidase alfa provides clinical benefit to patients. 
The benefit-risk balance remains positive. There is no deleterious impact on the benefit-risk 
balance anticipated for this product. 
Public health impact  Given the small number of patients treated either at home or in the hospital/clinic, the public 
health impact appears to be low.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART II MODULE SVIII: SUMMARY OF THE SAFETY 
CONCERNS  
Based on clinical experience with alglucosidase alfa as well as other ERT approved for treating 
lysosomal storage diseases, MAH has identified safety risks associated with alglucosidase alfa 
treatment. Most of the risks are well characterized, and MAH has established standardized 
procedures for identifying and/or managing these.  
The following table summarizes the ongoing safety concerns with alglucosidase alfa.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART III: PHARMACOVIGILANCE PLAN (INCLUDING 
POST-AUTHORIZATION SAFETY STUDIES)  
Based on clinical experience with alglucosidase alfa, the MAH has identified safety risks 
associated with alglucosidase alfa treatment. Most of the risks are well characterized, and MAH 
has established standardized procedures for identifying and/or managing these. 
III.1
ROUTINE PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES 
No routine pharmacovigilance activities beyond adverse reactions reporting and signal detection 
are deemed necessary to monitor the risks of alglucosidase alfa. 
The safety profile of alglucosidase alfa will continue to be further characterized in real clinical 
conditions of use through postmarketing safety surveillance, encompassing analysis of 
spontaneous reporting of ADRs in periodic safety reports, product technical complaints (PTCs) 
relating to adverse events, and signal detection. 
III.2
ADDITIONAL PHARMACOVIGILANCE ACTIVITIES 
Additional pharmacovigilance activities in the postmarketing setting includes conducting 
noninterventional studies (Post-authorization safety study [PASS]) to characterize safety profile of 
alglucosidase alfa in pregnant-lactating female patients, renal/hepatic impairment patients and the 
long-term safety profile in patients of all ages with Pompe disease in a real-world setting. Details 
are presented in the following table. 
Studies ALGMYC07390 and AGLU06909/LTS13930 have been completed and are thus 
proposed to be removed from the pharmacovigilance plan.

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN PART IV: PLANS FOR POST-AUTHORIZATION 
EFFICACY STUDIES  
No imposed post-authorization efficacy studies as a condition of the marketing authorization or 
which are specific obligations in the context of conditional marketing authorization or marketing 
authorization under exceptional circumstances are planned or ongoing for alglucosidase alfa. 
RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART V: RISK MINIMIZATION MEASURES 
(INCLUDING EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RISK MINIMIZATION 
ACTIVITIES)  
In particular, considering the current level of 
knowledge about immunological testing in clinical practice in IOPD and LOPD patients receiving 
or planning to receive alglucosidase alfa, as well as the SIP recommendations on the 
immunosurveillance program for alglucosidase alfa and full instructions for access to 
recommended a revision of the SIP to be submitted through 
immunosurveillance program, 
a RMP update. The SIP revision is done as part of the RMP update (version 10.0) and submitted 
as a part of the RMP variation. 
New aRMMs “Home infusion guide for HCP” and “Home infusion guide for Patient/Caregiver 
including an infusion diary” are introduced to minimize the following risks associated with home 
infusion of alglucosidase alfa: 
•
Infusion associated reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylactic reactions, with or
without development of IgG and IgE antibodies (Home infusion guides for HCP and
patient/caregiver)

RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN - PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT 
PLAN  
Summary of risk management plan for MYOZYME (Alglucosidase alfa) 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for MYOZYME. The RMP details 
important risks of MYOZYME how these risks can be minimized, and how more information will 
be obtained about MYOZYME’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
MYOZYME’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet (PL) give 
essential information to healthcare professionals (HCPs) and patients on how MYOZYME should 
be used. 
This summary of the RMP for MYOZYME should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
MYOZYME’s RMP. 
I.
THE MEDICINE AND WHAT IT IS USED FOR
MYOZYME is authorized for long term ERT in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of Pompe 
disease (acid α glucosidase deficiency). MYOZYME is indicated in adults and pediatric patients 
of all ages (see SmPC for the full indication). It contains alglucosidase alfa as the active substance 
and it is given by IV infusion. 
Further information about the evaluation of MYOZYME’s benefits can be found in 
MYOZYME’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage:  
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/myozyme 
II.
RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MEDICINE AND ACTIVITIES TO MINIMIZE OR
FURTHER CHARACTERIZE THE RISKS
Important risks of MYOZYME, together with measures to minimize such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about MYOZYME’s risks, are outlined in the next sections.  
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
• Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the PL
and SmPC addressed to patients and HCPs;
•
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
• The authorized pack size - the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure that the
medicine is used correctly;
• The medicine’s legal status - the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (eg, with or
without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures. 
In the case of MYOZYME, these measures are supplemented with aRMMs mentioned under 
relevant important risks, outlined in the next sections. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously and 
regularly analyzed, including PSUR assessment so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of MYOZYME is not yet available, it is 
listed under “missing information” outlined in the next section. 
II.A
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of MYOZYME are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Some of the risks are related to the 
biological nature of the product. Identified risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of 
a link with the use of MYOZYME. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the 
use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected (eg, on the 
long-term use of the medicine);

Clinical trial, postmarketing surveillance, literature 
Infantile-onset patients who develop high antibody titres appear to be at higher risk for 
developing more frequent IARs and hypersensitivity. Conversely, not all patients with 
symptoms of hypersensitivity have detectable IgG antibody titres. Patients with an acute 
illness (eg, acute febrile illness, such as pneumonia or sepsis, or 
wheezing/bronchospasm) at the time of alglucosidase alfa infusion appear to be at 
greater risk for IARs. Patients with advanced Pompe disease or compromised cardiac 
and/or respiratory function may be at risk of serious exacerbation of their cardiac or 
respiratory compromise during infusions. Patients treated with higher doses of 
alglucosidase alfa (>20 mg/kg) tended to develop a more robust IgG antibody response 
and experience more IARs. Patients who have experienced infusion reactions may be at 
increased risk of IARs when alglucosidase alfa is readministered. Additionally, IgE 
positive patients are at increased risk of developing IARs upon readministering the drug. 
In the LO study, there was no apparent association between higher IgG antibody titres 
and occurrence of IARs. 
It is recommended that patients be monitored for IgG antibody formation periodically. 
Baseline serum sample collection prior to the first infusion is encouraged. For IOPD 
patients, regular monitoring during first year of treatment (example: every 3 months) is 
suggested and subsequent monitoring dependent on clinical outcomes and antibody titre 
levels. For LOPD patients, antibody development should be assessed within 6 months 
and subsequent monitoring as clinically warranted based on safety and efficacy 
considerations. 
The probability of developing HSATs and poor outcome appears higher among 
CRIM-negative patients (patients in whom no endogenous GAA protein was detected by 
Western blot analysis) than among CRIM-positive patients (patients in whom 
endogenous GAA protein was detected by western blot analysis). However, high and 
sustained antibody titres also occur in some CRIM-positive patients. The cause of a poor 
clinical outcome in some of these patients is thought to be multifactorial. 
It is unknown who will develop immediate hypersensitivity reactions (IgE positive) to 
alglucosidase alfa.

Risk factors and risk groups 
Clinical trial, postmarketing surveillance, literature. 
Patients with positive uptake inhibition generally had higher IgG antibody titres 
than patients who remained negative for uptake inhibition in IO and LO studies. 
The presence or absence of endogenous enzyme, reported as CRIM status, is a 
known risk factor. For patients with IOPD, the major risk group is CRIM-negative 
patients who do not produce any endogenous enzyme. If not given prophylactic 
immune tolerance induction, these patients develop high and sustained ADA titres, 
as well as neutralizing antibodies when treated with alglucosidase alfa, which 
contribute to poor clinical outcomes.  
Patients with LOPD produce low levels of endogenous enzyme and are 
considered CRIM-positive. These patients are generally not at risk for developing 
HSAT and very few make high ADA titres which then decrease over time.

Table 31   Important potential risk with corresponding risk minimization activities: Medication 
errors in the home infusion setting  
Medication errors in the home infusion setting 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine  
It is expected and understood that the HCPs administering alglucosidase alfa in 
the home setting are experienced in the management of Pompe disease, as well 
as in the management of ERTs. 
Medication errors in the home infusion setting 
In the “Home infusion report” provided by the EMC expert center, where 
MYOZYME is routinely administered in the home setting as standard practice, the 
data confirmed that few IARs were identified associated with the administration of 
MYOZYME, similarly to the hospital set-up. No severe IARs were reported in the 
home setting, the majority of IARs were mild in intensity and did not necessitate 
advanced clinical intervention. (36)(37)(38) 
The MAH Global safety database was searched to identify all adverse events 
reported in association with alglucosidase alfa use in the home setting. As of 
01-Jun-2023, 2806 (6.2%) adverse events were reported with home infusions. The
adverse events reported during home infusions were largely from the Netherlands,
Canada and the US. The patients were mostly adults with a mean age of
36.6 years and similarly reported by males and females. The medication errors
reported in the home infusion setting were nonserious and similar to the commonly
reported medication errors for alglucosidase alfa (ie, inline filter not used,
dose/frequency changes, etc.). Overall, the adverse events including IARs and
hypersensitivity reactions occurring with the home infusion are consistent with the
known safety profile of alglucosidase alfa, the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and
the known complications of Pompe disease and therefore, do not raise any new
safety concerns.
However, as for other ERTs for which the home infusion is possible, there is a 
possible risk of medication errors in the home infusion setting, linked to insufficient 
understanding of the instructions for use of the product (eg, dose calculation, 
reconstitution, administration). Considering these facts, the MAH proposes to 
include “medication errors in the home infusion setting” as an important potential 
risk in the RMP.

Draft key messages of the additional risk minimization measures 
The Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) shall ensure that in each member state where 
alglucosidase alfa is marketed and/or home infusion is authorized, all healthcare professionals 
(HCPs) who are expected to prescribe, dispense and administer alglucosidase alfa have access 
to/are provided with the following educational guide as per local requirements/national health 
system: 
• Safety information packet for HCP
• Home infusion guide for HCP
Additionally, the following educational guide will be distributed to the patients/caregivers by their 
treating/prescribing physician who has received the material from the MAH:  
• Home infusion guide for Patient/Caregiver including an infusion diary
1.1  Safety information Packet (SIP) for health care professionals include the following key 
elements: 
• Educational material providing support to HCPs in the management of the following safety
concerns: Infusion associated reactions including hypersensitivity and anaphylactic
reactions, with or without development of IgG and IgE antibodies; Immune mediated
reactions and Immunogenicity leading to loss of response (High sustained IgG antibody
titres and or neutralizing antibodies);
• Testing recommendations:
- Baseline serum sample collection prior to the first infusion is strongly encouraged.
-
Immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody titers should be regularly monitored, and IgG
anti-drug antibody (ADA) testing should be considered if patients do not respond to
therapy.
- Treated patients may be tested for inhibitory antibodies if they experience a decrease in
clinical benefit despite continued treatment with Myozyme.
- Adverse-event-driven immunologic testing, including IgG and Immunoglobulin E (IgE)
ADA, should be considered for patients at risk for allergic reaction.
- Adverse-event-driven immunologic testing should also be considered in patients who
experience moderate/severe or recurrent infusion associated reactions (IARs) suggestive
of hypersensitivity reactions, anaphylactic reactions.
• Testing practicalities of the testing service and contact details
- Description of the testing services: available tests, indication for testing, sample type,
frequency of testing, collection time.
-
Procedure for testing: diagram summarizing main steps for HCP requesting specialty
testing services.

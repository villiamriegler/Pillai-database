COMP opinion (adoption via written

procedure) 
2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product in 2020 designation was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing tislelizumab was 
considered justified based on preliminary clinical observations in relapsed/refractory patients, who 
responded to treatment with the product; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to dysphagia, regurgitation, odynophagia, upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding, acid indigestion and life-threatening with 5-year survival reported in the 
range of 15%-25%; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made; Thus, the requirements under Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation 
(EC) No 141/2000 on orphan medicinal products are fulfilled. 
In addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition exist in the European Union, 
the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the medicinal product 
containing tislelizumab will be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has 
provided preliminary clinical observations in relapsed/refractory patients, who responded to treatment 
with the product as a monotherapy. The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically 
relevant advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Oesophageal cancer cases have most commonly a histology of squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC, 90% 
of cases worldwide) or adenocarcinoma (EAC). Although OSCC accounts for 
90% of cases of 
oesophageal cancer worldwide, mortality rates associated with AC are rising and have surpassed those 
∼
of SCC in several regions in the EU (Lordick et al, Annals of Oncology 27 (Supplement 5): v50–v57, 
2016.) 
The main risk factors for SCC in Western countries are smoking and alcohol consumption, whereas AC 
predominantly occurs in patients with chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and their risk is 
correlated with the patient’s body mass index with a higher risk for obese persons (Lordick et al, 
Orphan Maintenance Assessment Report  
EMA/OD/0000129253 
Page 4/8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Annals of Oncology 27 S5: v50–v57, 2016.). The target population for this product (Tislelizumab) are 
patients with oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). 
Clinically patients usually present with progressive dysphagia and weight loss. Chronic gastrointestinal 
bleeding is common and may result in iron deficiency anaemia. Early intramucosal adenocarcinomas of 
the distal oesophagus that are recognized at endoscopy in an area of Barrett's oesophagus are not 
specifically symptomatic (UpToDate, Saltzmann 2020). 
The approved therapeutic indication “Tevimbra as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable, locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma after 
prior platinum-based chemotherapy” falls within the scope of the designated orphan condition 
“Treatment of Oesophageal cancer”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
The medical plausibility has been confirmed by the positive benefit/risk assessment of the CHMP, see 
EPAR. 
Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The COMP considers the condition as chronically debilitating due to dysphagia, regurgitation, 
odynophagia, upper gastrointestinal bleeding, acid indigestion and life-threatening. The 5-year survival 
for localized disease is 46% but drops to 26% for regional disease and 5% for subjects with distant 
metastases. Patients diagnosed or treated once oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) has 
progressed, face a very poor prognosis (SEER 2021). 
Number of people affected or at risk 
During the initial orphan designation in 2020 the COMP accepted a prevalence estimate of less than 1 
per 10,000. The sponsor did not propose a new prevalence estimate in their orphan maintenance 
report but summarised the updated prevalence information according to the 5-year partial prevalence 
data from GLOBOCAN 2020 and concluded that the prevalence of the proposed condition remains 
below 5 per 10,000 persons. 
The EU dataset of GLOBOCAN 2020 is summarized below in Table 1 and indicates a 5-year partial 
prevalence of 0.84 per 10,000 persons for the EU-27.

The sponsor points out that compared to the 2018 GLOBOCAN prevalence values (used as one of the 
main data sources during the initial OD), all European countries had a slight increase in oesophageal 
cancer prevalence proportion rates per 10 000 persons except Denmark (from 1.32 to 1.16 per 10 
000) and Hungary (from 0.82 to 0.77 per 10 000). Nevertheless, the 5-year prevalence proportion 
estimates by European country, EU-27 and 4 European regions remain below 5 per 10 000 prevalence 
rate required for orphan designation.  
During the initial orphan designation for this product in 2020 the COMP considered that given the 
chronicity of the condition, a complete prevalence for the proposed condition should also be 
supplemented (incidence multiplied with the duration/survival of the condition). Considering that the 
population-based datasets examined by the sponsor previously showed that less than 50% of people 
diagnosed in the previous year were alive after one year, a median survival of less than a year was 
assumed. Combining this median survival with the then crude incidence figure in ECIS of 0.79 per 
10,000 led to a complete prevalence estimate of 0.68 per 10,000. Τhe sponsor has not presented an 
updated complete prevalence estimate. However, considering that the crude incidence from ECIS is 
6.8/100,000, and the prognosis is poor (5-year survival of approximately 20%), the COMP agreed on a 
prevalence estimate of less than 1 per 10,000, in line with the initial designation.

Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
Several medicinal products are authorized in the EU for the treatment of oesophageal cancer. The 
choice of treatment mostly depends on the location, tumour stage, histological type, biomarker 
expression (e.g. PD-L1 and HER2 status), patient’s performance status and comorbidities. The treatment 
of oesophageal cancer in Europe is informed by the recommendations for OSCC and EAC in the ESMO 
Clinical Practice Guidelines (Lordick et al 2022, Obermannová et al 2022). The main treatments are 
surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy and immune(chemo)therapy. The sponsor 
lists several recommended agents used off-label to treat oesophageal cancer (taxanes, 
fluoropyrimidines, platinums, oxaliplatin/fluoropyrimidine and cisplatin-based combinations) and 
identified two centrally authorised products for the treatment of OSCC: pembrolizumab and nivolumab, 
two other checkpoint inhibitors. 
Pembrolizumab is authorised for first-line treatment only and is therefore not considered a satisfactory 
method for the purpose of this procedure. Nivolumab is authorised in several settings (line of 
treatment, stage, biomarker expression, combination treatment), one of which overlaps with the 
proposed product Tevimbra. The therapeutic indication of nivolumab is as follows: 
-  Opdivo (nivolumab) as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of patients with 
unresectable advanced, recurrent or metastatic OSCC after prior fluoropyrimidine- and 
platinum-based combination chemotherapy 
In comparison, the therapeutic indication for Tevimbra is less restrictive and only refers to prior 
platinum-based chemotherapy: 
- 
Tevimbra as monotherapy is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable, 
locally advanced or metastatic oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma after prior platinum-
based chemotherapy 
Importantly, the latest ESMO treatment guideline points out that platinum-based chemotherapy 
regimens can be combined either with a fluoropyrimidine or a taxane, in the first line setting of locally 
advanced OC. The COMP further noted that more than 50% of patients included in the pivotal study for 
Tevimbra received prior taxane-based chemotherapy.  
The COMP therefore considers the target patient population of Tevimbra broader than the one for 
nivolumab (in second and subsequent lines of treatment for advanced oesophageal SCC), as it also covers 
patients that received prior platinum-based chemotherapy. Nivolumab was therefore not considered to 
be a satisfactory method, for the purpose of this procedure. 
Significant benefit 
As  discussed  above  and  based  on  the  therapeutic  indication  of  Tevimbra  vis  a  vis  the  one  of  other 
authorized medicinal products in the treatment of OSCC (including nivolumab), no satisfactory methods 
exist  for  the  entirety  of  the  target  patient  population  covered  by  Tevimbra.  Therefore,  the  significant 
benefit is not considered applicable, for the purpose of this procedure.

4.  COMP position adopted on 21 July 2023 
The COMP concluded that:  
• 
• 
• 
• 
the proposed therapeutic indication falls entirely within the scope of the orphan condition of the 
designated Orphan Medicinal Product. 
the prevalence of oesophageal cancer (hereinafter referred to as “the condition”) was estimated to 
remain below 5 in 10,000 and was concluded to be less than 1 in 10,000 persons in the European 
Union, at the time of the review of the designation criteria; 
the condition is chronically debilitating due to dysphagia, regurgitation, odynophagia, upper 
gastrointestinal bleeding, acid indigestion and life-threatening with 5-year survival reported in the 
range of 15%-25%; 
at present, no satisfactory method has been authorised in the European Union for the treatment of 
the entirety of patients covered by the therapeutic indication of Tevimbra.  
The COMP, having considered the information submitted by the sponsor and on the basis of Article 
5(12)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000, is of the opinion that: 
• 
• 
the criteria for designation as set out in the first paragraph of Article 3(1)(a) are satisfied; 
the criteria for designation as set out in Article 3(1)(b) are satisfied. 
The Committee for Orphan Medicinal Products has recommended that Tevimbra, tislelizumab, for 
treatment of oesophageal cancer (EU/3/20/2357) is not removed from the Community Register of 
Orphan Medicinal Products.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study V130_10 (EudraCT Number 2020-002785-13), “Phase 3, Randomized, 
Observer-Blind, Multicenter, Noninferiority Study to Evaluate Safety and Immunogenicity of a Cell-
based Quadrivalent Subunit Influenza Virus Vaccine (QIVc) and a United States-licensed Quadrivalent 
Influenza Virus Vaccine (QIV) in Healthy Subjects 6 Months Through 47 Months” is a stand alone 
study. 
Study V130_10 was a PAM (LEG 001) which was undertaken to expand the age indication and support 
licensure of QIVc for use in children 6 months of age and older in the US (from the currently approved 
indication of 4 years and older) and to further support regulatory submissions in other regions as 
required. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Subjects in the QIVc group received a 0.5 mL IM dose of QIVc (1 or 2 doses, depending on influenza 
vaccination history). 
Subjects in the US-licensed QIV comparator vaccine group who were: 
•  6 months through 35 months of age received a 0.25 mL IM dose of the comparator vaccine (1 
or 2 doses, depending on influenza vaccination history); 
•  36 months through 47 months of age received a 0.5 mL IM dose of the comparator vaccine (1 
or 2 doses, depending on influenza vaccination history).

2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
V130_10 “Phase 3, Randomized, Observer-Blind, Multicenter, Noninferiority Study to Evaluate 
Safety and Immunogenicity of a Cell-based Quadrivalent Subunit Influenza Virus Vaccine (QIVc) and a 
United States-licensed Quadrivalent Influenza Virus Vaccine (QIV) in Healthy Subjects 6 Months 
Through 47 Months” 
Following a Biologics License Application (BLA) in April 2015, marketing authorization of QIVc for the 
prevention of seasonal influenza in adults and children aged 4 years and older was approved by the US 
Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in May 2016 (tradename Flucelvax® Quadrivalent). QIVc has also 
been approved for use in adults and children aged 9 years and older by the European Medicines 
Agency in December 2018 (tradename Flucelvax® Tetra), by Health Canada in November 2019 
(tradename FLUCELVAX® QUAD), and by the Therapeutic Goods Administration of Australia in August 
2020 (tradename Flucelvax® Quad). QIVc was approved in Brazil for use in adults 18 years and older 
on 26 February 2020 and in children 2 years and older on 09 June 2020 (tradename Flucelvax® Tetra) 
and also in Taiwan for use in adults and children 3 years and older on 23 March 2020 (tradename 
Flucelvax® Quad). 
The current study was undertaken to demonstrate that vaccination with Seqirus’ QIVc elicits an 
immune response that is not inferior to that of a US-licensed QIV in children 6 months through 47 
months of age. 
This study was designed as a Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind, comparator-controlled, multicenter 
study of QIVc versus US-licensed QIV in children 6 months through 47 months of age. Study vaccine 
administration was a single dose, or 2 doses 28 days apart, depending on the influenza vaccination 
history of the subject; previously vaccinated subjects received 1 dose and not previously vaccinated 
subjects received 2 doses. Study V130_10 was conducted during the Northern Hemisphere 2019/2020 
influenza season.

Months” 
Description 
The purpose of this Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind, comparator-controlled, multicentre study of 
QIVc versus a US-licensed QIV was to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of each of the 4 
influenza strains contained in QIVc. Immunogenicity was evaluated at Day 1 and Day 29 (previously 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

vaccinated subjects, 1 dose of vaccine) or Day 1 and Day 57 (not previously vaccinated subjects, 2 
doses of vaccine). For the noninferiority assessment, immunogenicity was evaluated by measurement 
of serum hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) antibody titers for all influenza strains except A/H3N2.  
Evolutionary changes in A/H3N2 HA protein have resulted in the loss of capacity to agglutinate red 
blood cells for recently circulating strains. Therefore, in consultation with Center for Biologics 
Evaluation and Research (CBER)/FDA prior to study initiation, it was decided to assess the 2 A/H3N2 
co-primary endpoints using a microneutralization (MN) assay instead. The data from this study will be 
used to support the licensure of QIVc for use in children 6 months through 47 months of age. 
Methods 
Objective(s) 
Primary Immunogenicity Objective 
The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate that vaccination with QIVc elicits an 
immune response that is not inferior to that of a US-licensed QIV containing the recommended strains 
for the season, in subjects 6 months through 47 months of age, as measured by HAI assay for 
A/H1N1, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains and by MN assay for A/H3N2 strain, using cell-derived 
target viruses. 
The criteria for concluding noninferiority of QIVc to the US-licensed QIV are as follows: 
The noninferiority of QIVc compared with the US-licensed QIV was assessed by the 8 co-primary 
endpoints of GMT and SCR for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria. 
Definitions for the noninferiority assessment based on endpoints measured by the HAI assay (GMT 
ratio <1.5 and SCR difference <10%) were derived from the FDA Guidance on seasonal inactivated 
influenza vaccines (CBER 2007). The definitions for the noninferiority assessment using endpoints 
measured by the MN assay were based on those used for the HAI assay. The study was to be 
considered successful if all 8 co-primary endpoints are achieved. Specifically, QIVc was to be 
considered to be noninferior to the US-licensed QIV if, for each of the 4 strains, the following statistical 
criteria were met: 
A/H1N1, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria 
• 
• 
The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of the HAI GMTs does not exceed 1.5. The 
HAI GMT ratio was calculated as HAI GMT (US-licensed QIV) divided by HAI GMT (QIVc). 
The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference between the HAI SCRs does not exceed 
10%. The difference in HAI SCRs was calculated as HAI SCR (US-licensed QIV) minus HAI SCR 
(QIVc). The 95% CI was computed based on the binomial distribution. 
A/H3N2 strain only 
• 
• 
The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of the MN GMTs does not exceed 1.5. The 
MN GMT ratio was calculated as MN GMT (US-licensed QIV) divided by MN GMT (QIVc). 
The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference between the MN SCRs does not 
exceed 10%. The difference in MN SCRs was calculated as MN SCR (US-licensed QIV) minus 
MN SCR (QIVc). The 95% CI was computed based on the binomial distribution.

Secondary Immunogenicity Objective 
1.  To describe the immunogenicity of QIVc and US-licensed QIV by HAI assay for A/H1N1, 
B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains, and by MN assay for A/H3N2 strain, using egg-derived 
target viruses 
2.  To describe the immunogenicity of QIVc and US-licensed QIV by HAI assay for A/H1N1, 
B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains, and by MN assay for A/H3N2 strain, using cell-derived 
target viruses 
3.  To describe the immunogenicity of QIVc and US-licensed QIV by MN assay for A/H1N1, 
B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains, in a subset of subjects 
Secondary Safety Objective 
The secondary safety objective was to evaluate the safety and reactogenicity of QIVc and US-licensed 
QIV. 
Exploratory Immunogenicity Objectives 
1.  To evaluate the homologous cell-mediated immunity (CMI) response, prevaccination and 
postvaccination, in a small population of subjects 
2.  To further describe the immune response to vaccination, additional immunogenicity analyses 
may be conducted such as HAI assay for A/H3N2 using cell- and egg-derived target viruses 
Study design 
This study was designed as a Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind, comparator-controlled, multicenter 
study of QIVc versus US-licensed QIV in children 6 months through 47 months of age. Study vaccine 
administration was a single dose, or 2 doses 28 days apart, depending on the influenza vaccination 
history of the subject; previously vaccinated subjects received 1 dose and not previously vaccinated 
subjects received 2 doses. Study V130_10 was conducted during the Northern Hemisphere 2019/2020 
influenza season. 
The US-licensed QIV was Afluria® Quadrivalent, which was administered according to the US Package 
Insert. The age indication for Afluria Quadrivalent was extended to include children 6 months through 
59 months of age by the FDA in October 2018. Each vaccine contained the influenza strains 
recommended by the WHO for the influenza season covered by the study. The purpose of the study 
was to demonstrate that vaccination with QIVc elicits an immune response that is not inferior to that of 
a US-licensed QIV in children 6 months through 47 months of age; therefore, a noninferiority study 
design was chosen.

The study comprised a treatment period and a follow-up period. The treatment period extended from 
the time of first vaccination to 28 days after the last vaccination; therefore, the duration of study 
participation was dependent upon the number of doses of vaccine that the subject received. 
Study participation concluded with a Study Completion Call 180 days after the last vaccination. 
Previously vaccinated subjects 
• 
• 
Treatment Period (Day 1 through Day 29): 
o  1 vaccination (QIVc or US-licensed QIV) on Day 1 
Follow-up Period (Day 29 through Day 181) 
Not previously vaccinated subjects 
• 
• 
Treatment Period (Day 1 through Day 57): 
o  2 vaccinations (QIVc or US-licensed QIV) on Day 1 and Day 29 
Follow-up Period (Day 57 through Day 209) 
The study vaccine (QIVc or the US-licensed QIV) was administered intramuscularly into the 
anterolateral region of the thigh (for subjects 6 months through 11 months, in general) or in the 
deltoid region (for subjects 12 months and older, in general). QIVc was administered as a 0.5 mL dose. 
The US-licensed QIV was administered following the dose recommendations described in the US 
Package Insert, ie, a 0.25 mL dose for subjects 6 months through 35 months of age and a 0.5 mL dose 
for subjects 36 months through 47 months of age. 
After vaccination, all subjects remained under medical supervision and were monitored for any 
immediate postvaccination reactions (including solicited local and systemic AEs, unsolicited AEs, and 
body temperature measurement) for at least 30 minutes. The data collected during the 30-minute 
observation were recorded in the source documents only. 
Solicited local adverse reactions and solicited systemic AEs were collected from 30 minutes after 
vaccination on a Subject Diary Card, and collection continued for a total of 7 days. 
Parent(s)/LAR(s) received a reminder call to complete the Subject Diary Card 2 days after vaccination. 
The Subject Diary Card was the only source document allowed for solicited local adverse reactions and 
systemic AEs, including body temperature measurements. In children younger than 36 months of age, 
measurement of body temperature was preferably by the rectal route. Oral, axillary, or tympanic 
membrane routes could be used in older children. 
All unsolicited AEs were collected during the treatment period. During the follow-up period, it was 
required to report only unsolicited AEs that were SAEs, NOCD, or AEs leading to withdrawal on the 
Adverse Events electronic Case Report Form (eCRF). 
Subjects provided a serological specimen by a blood draw before vaccination on Day 1 and 28 
days after the last vaccination during scheduled clinic visits: 
• 
Previously vaccinated subjects provided a serological specimen on Day 1 and Day 29 
(vaccination on Day 1) 
•  Not previously vaccinated subjects provided a serological specimen on Day 1 and Day 57 
(vaccination on Day 1 and Day 29)

The serological specimen on the day of vaccination was obtained before vaccination. 
Study population /Sample size 
It was planned to conduct the study with approximately 2502 healthy male and female subjects who 
were 6 months through 47 months of age: 2418 subjects for evaluation of immunogenicity 
(Immunogenicity Group) and 84 subjects (24 months through 47 months of age) for exploratory 
evaluation of CMI (CMI Population). Stratification through Interactive Response Technology (IRT) was 
used to ensure a balanced distribution among the age groups; it was planned that at least 30% of 
subjects would be 6 months through 23 months of age and at least 30% of subjects would be 24 
months through 47 months of age. 
Subjects were enrolled into the study and randomized via an IRT system to receive QIVc or US-
licensed QIV in a 2:1 ratio.

Investigational Vaccine 
QIVc: 
QIVc is a cell-based quadrivalent inactivated subunit seasonal influenza vaccine manufactured by 
Seqirus. QIVc is composed of antigens from 4 different influenza strains, ie, 2 influenza A strains 
(A/H1N1 and A/H3N2) and 2 influenza B strains (B/Yamagata and B/Victoria).  
An approximately 0.5 mL dose of QIVc (cell-based quadrivalent subunit influenza virus vaccine; 
supplied in a 0.5 mL prefilled syringe) contains nominally 15 μg of HA of each of the 2 influenza Type A 
strains and each of the 2 influenza Type B strains for a total of 60 μg of HA in the vaccine. The strain 
composition was that recommended by the WHO, CBER, and Committee for Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (CHMP) for quadrivalent influenza vaccines contemporaneous to the timing of the study. 
The full composition of the vaccine is reported in Table 9-1. The product lot number of QIVc used in 
the study was 261303 (expiry date: 19 June 2020).

Statistical Methods  
Descriptive statistics were used to present all safety and immunogenicity results: number of 
observations (n), mean, standard deviation (SD), median, minimum (min), maximum (max) for 
continuous data and frequency and percentage relative to the appropriate population for categorical 
data. 
Binary data (ie, percentages of subjects with SCR) were summarized for each group using unadjusted 
estimates and are reported together with 2-sided exact 95% CIs (Clopper-Pearson). 
The difference between the proportions of treatment groups was determined and the corresponding 2-
sided 95% CIs calculated by Miettinen-Nurminen method. 
Geometric means and 95% CIs were calculated by taking the anti-logs of the means and 95% CI of the 
log transformed immunogenicity parameters. Exact CIs based upon the binomial distribution were 
calculated for percentages. 
Statistical Hypothesis 
The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate that vaccination with QIVc elicited an 
immune response that was not inferior to that of a US-licensed QIV containing the recommended 
strains for the season, in subjects 6 months through 47 months of age, as measured by the HAI assay 
for the A/H1N1, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains and by the MN assay for the A/H3N2 strain, using 
cell-derived target viruses. 
The noninferiority of QIVc compared with the US-licensed QIV was assessed by the 8 co-primary 
endpoints of GMT and SCR for A/H1N1, A/H3N2, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria. Definitions for the 
noninferiority assessment based on endpoints measured by the HAI assay (GMT ratio <1.5 and SCR 
difference <10%) were derived from the FDA Guidance on seasonal inactivated influenza vaccines 
(CBER 2007). The definitions for the noninferiority assessment using endpoints measured by the MN 
assay were based on those used for the HAI assay. The study was to be considered successful if all 8 
co-primary endpoints are achieved. Specifically, QIVc was to be considered to be noninferior to the US-
licensed QIV if, for each of the 4 strains, the following statistical criteria were met: 
A/H1N1, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria 
• 
The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of the HAI GMTs does not exceed 1.5. The 
HAI GMT ratio was calculated as HAI GMT (US-licensed QIV) divided by HAI GMT (QIVc).

• 
The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference between the HAI SCRs does not 
exceed 10%. The difference in HAI SCRs was calculated as HAI SCR (US-licensed QIV) minus 
HAI SCR (QIVc). The 95% CI was computed based on the binomial distribution. 
A/H3N2 strain only 
• 
• 
The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the ratio of the MN GMTs does not exceed 1.5. The 
MN GMT ratio was calculated as MN GMT (US-licensed QIV) divided by MN GMT (QIVc). 
The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference between the MN SCRs does not 
exceed 10%. The difference in MN SCRs was calculated as MN SCR (US-licensed QIV) minus 
MN SCR (QIVc). The 95% CI was computed based on the binomial distribution. 
Results 
Recruitment/ Number analysed 
The size of the study population was consistent with the planned number of approximately 2502 
subjects. A total of 2414 subjects 6 months through 47 months of age were enrolled in the study (All 
Enrolled Set) and randomized to receive QIVc or the US-licensed QIV. Twelve enrolled subjects did not 
receive study vaccine; thus, the FAS included 2402 subjects who received at least 1 study vaccination. 
Subjects were randomized to receive QIVc or the USlicensed QIV in a 2:1 ratio as planned, with 1597 
subjects receiving QIVc and 805 subjects receiving the US-licensed QIV. Of the 2402 subjects in the 
FAS, 2322 subjects were enrolled for evaluation of immunogenicity (Immunogenicity Group) and 80 
subjects were enrolled for exploratory evaluation of CMI (CMI Population). 
The majority of subjects (86.2%) completed the study; 334 of 2414 subjects (13.8%) discontinued 
from the study. The most common reason for discontinuing from the study was lost to follow-up 
(11.1% of subjects). 
Baseline data 
This study was conducted at 47 centers in the US. Demographic and baseline characteristics of the FAS 
(subjects in both the Immunogenicity Group and CMI Population) are summarized in Table 10-5. 
The mean (SD) age of the study population was 28.1 (11.57) months and the range was 6 months to 
47 months of age, which was consistent with the intended study population. The stratification strategy 
was designed to ensure a balanced distribution among age groups such that at least 30% of subjects 
would be 6 months through 23 months of age and at least 30% of subjects would be 24 months 
through 47 months of age. The resulting age distribution met this intention, with 37.2% of subjects 
being 23 months of age or younger and 62.8% of subjects being 24 months of age or older. 
The demographic characteristics were generally balanced between the QIVc group and US-licensed QIV 
group.

Efficacy/immunogenicity results 
In this study, the efficacy has been assessed in terms of immunogenicity.  
The primary immunogenicity objective was to demonstrate that vaccination with QIVc elicits an 
immune response that is not inferior to that of a US-licensed QIV containing the recommended strains 
for the season, in subjects 6 months through 47 months of age, as measured by HAI assay for 
A/H1N1, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains and by MN assay for A/H3N2 strain, using cell-derived 
target viruses.

The prespecified noninferiority criterion for the GMT ratio (adjusted analysis) was met for all 4 strains 
contained in the QIVc vaccine: 
• 
The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMT ratios (US-licensed QIV/QIVc) did not 
exceed the prespecified noninferiority margin of 1.5 (A/H1N1: 0.836; A/H3N2: 1.160; 
B/Yamagata: 0.809; B/Victoria: 0.972). 
The prespecified noninferiority criterion for the SCR difference in subjects was met for all 4 strains 
contained in the QIVc vaccine: 
• 
The upper bound of the 2-sided 95% CI for the SCR differences (US-licensed QIV minus QIVc) 
did not exceed the prespecified noninferiority margin of 10% (A/H1N1: -6.423%; A/H3N2: 
7.812%; B/Yamagata: -9.983%; B/Victoria: -1.440%).

As all 8 co-primary immunogenicity endpoints were met, noninferiority of QIVc compared with the US-
licensed QIV was concluded. 
The immunogenicity results obtained in the PPS for the primary objective were supported by those 
obtained in the FAS Immunogenicity. 
The secondary immunogenicity objectives were to describe the immunogenicity of QIVc and the US-
licensed QIV by HAI and MN assays in subjects 6 months through 47 months of age, using egg-derived 
and cell-derived target viruses. 
For evaluation of immunogenicity using egg-derived target viruses as measured by HAI assay for the 
A/H1N1, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains and by MN assay for the A/H3N2 strain, there were no 
notable differences in the immunogenicity endpoints between QIVc and the US-licensed QIV for all 4 
vaccine strains. 
For evaluation of immunogenicity using cell-derived target viruses as measured by HAI assay for the 
A/H1N1, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria strains and by MN assay for the A/H3N2 strain, there were no 
notable differences in the immunogenicity endpoints between QIVc and the US-licensed QIV for the 
A/H3N2 and B/Victoria strains. For the A/H1N1 and B/Yamagata strains, the postvaccination 
immunogenicity endpoints were observed to be higher for QIVc than the US-licensed QIV for the Day 
29/57 GMT, GMR, Day 29/57 percentage of subjects with titer >1:40, and SCR. A secondary objective 
was also to assess, in a randomly selected subset of subjects from the Immunogenicity Group, the 
immune responses to A/H1N1, B/Yamagata, and B/Victoria as measured in MN assays using cell-
derived target viruses. This evaluation showed that there were no notable differences in the 
immunogenicity endpoints between the QIVc and US-licensed QIV groups for all 3 strains.

Overall, subgroup analyses stratified by prevaccination titer, influenza vaccination history, age, gender, 
and race showed that similar immune responses were elicited to QIVc and the US-licensed QIV. 
One exploratory objective was to describe the immunogenicity of A/H3N2 for QIVc and the US-licensed 
QIV as measured by the HAI assay, using cell-derived and egg-derived target viruses. In the assay 
using cell-derived target viruses, there were no notable differences in the Day 1 GMTs, GMRs, 
seropositivity rates, and percentage of subjects with GMT titers ≥1:40 between the 2 vaccines, while 
the Day 29/57 GMT and SCR were observed to be higher for QIVc than the US-licensed QIV. There 
were no notable differences in Day 1 and Day 29/57 GMTs, GMRs, seropositivity rates, percentage of 
subjects with HAI titer ≥1:40, and SCRs between the 2 vaccines using egg-derived target viruses. 
The other exploratory immunogenicity objective was to evaluate the CMI response in subjects 24 
months through 47 months of age vaccinated with QIVc or the US-licensed QIV (CMI Population). 
Peripheral blood CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells responsive to influenza antigen stimulation in vitro, as 
measured by antigen-induced expression of markers of T-cell activation, were detected at low 
frequencies in subjects vaccinated with QIVc or the US-licensed QIV. 
In summary, the primary objective of the study was achieved. QIVc was found to elicit an immune 
response in subjects 6 months through 47 months of age that was not inferior to the immune response 
elicited by a US-licensed QIV. 
Safety results 
QIVc and the US-licensed QIV were well tolerated in this pediatric population 6 months through 47 
months of age, with both vaccines associated with an acceptable safety profile. 
The rates of solicited local AEs were similar between the QIVc and US-licensed QIV groups, being 
reported by 41.9% and 44.6% of subjects, respectively, from Day 1 through Day 7 after any 
vaccination. The rates of the individual solicited local AEs were also similar between the 2 vaccine 
groups, with the 2 most commonly reported solicited local AEs being tenderness and erythema in both 
vaccine groups. Most solicited local AEs were mild or moderate in severity, with severe solicited local 
AEs generally reported by <0.5% of subjects in each vaccine group. Few subjects in either vaccine 
group reported solicited local AEs persisting beyond 7 days after vaccination. 
The rates of solicited systemic AEs were also similar between the QIVc and US-licensed QIV groups, 
occurring in 43.5% and 45.7% of subjects, respectively, from Day 1 through Day 7 after any 
vaccination. There were no notable differences in the rates of individual solicited systemic AEs between 
the 2 vaccine groups; the 2 most commonly reported solicited systemic AEs were irritability and 
sleepiness. The majority of solicited systemic AEs were mild or moderate in severity; severe solicited 
systemic AEs were generally reported by <2.0% of subjects in each vaccine group. Solicited systemic 
AEs rarely persisted beyond 7 days after vaccination in either vaccine group. 
The rates of fever (≥38.0°C) after any vaccination were low (<7% of subjects) in the QIVc and US-
licensed QIV groups. The rates of fever (≥40.0°C) were very low, being reported by 0.6% and 0.1% of 
subjects in the QIVc and US-licensed QIV groups, respectively. 
Solicited local AEs and solicited systemic AEs, including fever, were less commonly reported after the 
second vaccination than after the first vaccination. 
All unsolicited AEs were collected during the treatment period and SAEs, AEs leading to NOCD, AEs 
leading to withdrawal, and medically-attended AEs were reported for the entire study period. 
During the treatment period, the rates of all-causality unsolicited AEs were similar between the QIVc 
(26.2%) and US-licensed QIV (25.7%) groups. Most unsolicited AEs were mild or moderate in severity.

The rates of unsolicited AEs related to the study vaccine were low, being reported by 4.4% and 4.5% 
of subjects in the QIVc and US-licensed QIV groups, respectively. In the subgroups examined in the 
study, there were no notable differences in the proportions of subjects reporting AEs for QIVc 
compared with the US-licensed QIV. 
The incidence of SAEs in the study was low. In total, 15 of 1597 subjects (0.9%) in the QIVc group and 
7 of 805 subjects (0.9%) in the US-licensed QIV group reported SAEs. None of the SAEs were assessed 
as related to the study vaccine in either the QIVc group or the US-licensed QIV group. There were 2 
AEs leading to death and withdrawal from the study (adenoviral encephalopathy, traffic accident) and a 
third AE leading to withdrawal from the study (seizure), all in the QIVc group. None were assessed as 
related to the study vaccine. The rates of NOCD (1.4% and 1.6%) and medically-attended AEs (13.9% 
and 12.0%) during the study were similar between the QIVc and US-licensed QIV groups. 
In conclusion, the safety profile of QIVc was similar to that of a US-licensed QIV. Overall, QIVc showed 
a clinically acceptable safety profile in children 6 months through 47 months of age. No safety 
concerns were identified in this study. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
QIVc was initially granted marketing approval in the US for use in persons 4 years of age and older on 
23 May 2016. Marketing authorization was also granted for QIVc in Europe (EMA) in December 2018, 
in Canada in November 2019 for use in people 9 years and older and in Brazil for use in people 18 
years and older in February 2020.  
In March 2020 Seqirus submitted a type II variation to EMA to extend the age indication for Flucelvax 
Tetra to children 2 years and older, which was granted on 22 October 2020. In December 2020, 
Seqirus submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) a supplemental Biologics License 
Application (BLA) to extend the indication for Flucelvax Quadrivalent to children 6 months and older.  
Study V130_10 was undertaken to expand the age indication and support licensure of QIVc for use in 
children 6 months of age and older in the US (from the currently approved indication of 4 years and 
older) and to further support regulatory submissions in other regions as required. 
The hereby submitted study (V130_10) is also part of an EU Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) for 
Flucelvax Tetra (EMEA-002068-PIP01-16; P/0209/2017). The agreed PIP includes also study V130_14, 
requested by EMA, which is ongoing: Study V130_14 – A Phase 3 efficacy, immunogenicity, and safety 
study of QIVc compared with a non-influenza comparator in healthy children 6 months through 47 
months of age. The purpose of this study is to support registration in the European Union (EU) and 
fulfil a component of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) with EMA. Study V130_14 was requested 
by CHMP in line with the Guideline on Clinical Evaluation of New Vaccines 
(EMEA/CHMP/VWP/164653/05 Rev. 1), that states that in order to grant an indication in children 6 to 
36 months of age, efficacy data should be submitted by the applicant. In this sense, the 
immunogenicity data from study V130_10, which are very interesting, do not trigger any regulatory 
action in the EU.  
Study V130_10 was a Phase 3, randomized, observer-blind, comparator-controlled, multicenter, 
noninferiority study designed to evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of QIVc compared with a US-
licensed QIV in children 6 months through 47 months of age. QIVc (Flucelvax® Tetra in Europe and 
Flucelvax® Quadrivalent in the US) is a cell-based quadrivalent inactivated subunit influenza vaccine 
prepared from virus propagated in Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) cells. The US-licensed QIV 
(Afluria Quadrivalent) comparator vaccine is an egg-based inactivated influenza vaccine. The 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006  
EMA/318515/2021  
Page 21/22 
 
 
 
comparator US-licensed vaccine is Afluria Quadrivalent, which is authorized in Germany and Austria by 
the decentralized procedure (DCP). 
The conclusions that are obtained from the submitted V130_10 study are the following: 
• 
• 
The predefined success criteria for the 8 co-primary immunogenicity endpoints were met, thus 
demonstrating a noninferior immune response for QIVc compared with the US-licensed QIV in 
children 6 months through 47 months of age. 
The secondary and exploratory immunogenicity objectives of the study described humoral 
immunogenicity of QIVc and the US-licensed QIV based on HAI and MN assay data, using cell- 
and egg-derived target viruses. For assays using cell-derived target viruses, the QIVc response 
was similar to the US-licensed QIV response for the A/H3N2 and B/Victoria strains whereas for 
the A/H1N1 and B/Yamagata strains, the QIVc response was observed to be higher. For assays 
using egg-derived target viruses, there were no notable differences between the 2 vaccines for 
all 4 strains. Overall, the evaluation of immunogenicity for the secondary objectives reinforces 
the finding that the immune response to QIVc is noninferior to the immune response to the 
US-licensed QIV. 
• 
The exploratory CMI evaluation showed T-cell responses to both vaccines at expression levels 
not unexpected for inactivated, non-adjuvanted vaccines. 
•  QIVc and the US-licensed QIV were well tolerated in this population of children 6 months 
through 47 months of age. The 2 vaccines had a similar and clinically acceptable safety profile. 
No safety concerns were identified in the study. 
In summary, the results in this paediatric study showed that QIVc elicited an immune response that 
was not inferior to that of the US-licensed QIV, accompanied by a clinically acceptable safety profile 
similar to that of the US-licensed QIV, in children 6 months through 47 months of age. The MAH is not 
proposing changes in the Product Information (PI) as a consequence of this submission. In the 
Rapporteur’s opinion it is agreed not to change the PI, since there is an ongoing study requested by 
EMA in this same age population that is expected to finish on June 2021 and that will render the 
efficacy, immunogenicity and safety results necessary for the assessment of the indication from 6 
months of age in the EU. 
3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Study V130_10 has been submitted within six months of its completion and is part of the EMEA-
002068-PIP01-16 (P/0209/2017). The study has been adequately designed and completed in 
accordance to the agreed PIP. 
The immunogenicity results of this trial demonstrate non-inferiority of the QIVc compared with the US-
licensed QIV in subjects 6 months through 47 months of age. In addition, no safety concerns or risks 
were observed following vaccination with QIVc in this study. The safety profile of QIVc in children 6 
months through 47 months of age is generally consistent with that observed in previous paediatric 
studies with QIVc. 
No update of the SmPC is required.

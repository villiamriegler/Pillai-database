PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Solution for injection
The solution is a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid.
4.  CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1  Therapeutic indications
Ervebo is indicated for active immunisation of individuals 1 year of age or older to protect against
Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) caused by Zaire Ebola virus (see sections 4.2, 4.4 and 5.1).
The use of Ervebo should be in accordance with official recommendations.
4.2  Posology and method of administration
Ervebo should be administered by a trained healthcare worker.
Posology
Individuals 1 year of age or older: one dose (1 mL) (see section 5.1).
Booster dose
The need and appropriate timing for booster dose(s) have not been established. Current available data
are included in section 5.1. 
2
Paediatric population
The posology in children 1 to 17 years of age is the same as in adults. Safety, immunogenicity and
efficacy of Ervebo in children less than 1 year of age have not been established (see sections 4.8 and
5.1).
Method of administration
For precautions to be taken before administering the vaccine, see section 4.4.
For precautions regarding thawing, handling and disposal of the vaccine, see section 6.6.
Ervebo should be administered by the intramuscular (IM) route. The preferred site is the deltoid area
of the non-dominant arm or in the higher anterolateral area of the thigh. Do not inject the vaccine
intravascularly. No data are available for administration via the subcutaneous or intradermal routes.
Cover the vaccination injection site or any vesicles with an adequate bandage (e.g. any adhesive
bandage or gauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact (see
sections 4.4 and 5.3). The bandage may be removed when there is no visible fluid leakage.
The vaccine should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.
4.3  Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substances or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to rice
protein listed in section 2.
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Close monitoring is recommended following vaccination for the early signs of anaphylaxis or
anaphylactoid reactions. As with all injectable vaccines, appropriate medical treatment and
supervision should always be readily available in case of an anaphylactic event following the
administration of the vaccine. 
Duration of protection
Vaccination with Ervebo may not result in protection in all vaccinees. Vaccine efficacy in adults has
been established in the period ≥10 to ≤31 days after vaccination, however the duration of protection is
not known (see section 5.1). The use of other Ebola control measures should therefore not be
interrupted.
Vaccination of contacts of Ebola cases should occur as soon as possible (see section 5.1).
Standard precautions when caring for patients with known or suspected Ebola disease 
Vaccination with Ervebo does not eliminate the necessity of standard precautions when caring for
patients with known or suspected Ebola disease. All healthcare workers and other ancillary
providers who have been vaccinated should not alter their practices with regard to safe
injection, hygiene, and personal protective equipment (PPE) after vaccination.
3
Healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus should apply extra
infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient’s blood and body fluids and
contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. Samples taken from humans and
animals for investigation of Ebola infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in
suitably equipped laboratories.
Vaccine administrators should counsel vaccinees to continue to protect themselves with adequate
measures.
Immunocompromised individuals
Safety and efficacy of Ervebo have not been assessed in immunocompromised individuals.
Immunocompromised individuals may not respond as well as immunocompetent individuals to
Ervebo. As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Ervebo in individuals with
known immunocompromised conditions or receiving immunosuppressive therapy, including the
following conditions:
• 
• 
• 
• 
Severe humoral or cellular (primary or acquired) immunodeficiency, e.g. severe combined
immunodeficiency, agammaglobulinemia, and AIDS or symptomatic HIV infection. A CD4+
T-lymphocyte count threshold for use in asymptomatic HIV-positive individuals has not been
established.
Current immunosuppressive therapy, including high doses of corticosteroid. This does not
include individuals who are receiving topical, inhaled or low-dose parenteral corticosteroids
(e.g. for asthma prophylaxis or replacement therapy).
Diseases of the blood such as leukaemia, lymphomas of any type, or other malignant neoplasms
affecting the haematopoietic and lymphatic systems.
Family history of congenital or hereditary immunodeficiency, unless the immune competence of
the potential vaccine recipient is demonstrated.
Pregnant and breast-feeding women
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Ervebo during pregnancy. See section
4.6.
Transmission
Vaccine virus might be present in biological fluids such as blood, urine, saliva, semen, vaginal fluids,
aqueous humor, breast milk, faeces, sweat, amniotic fluid, and placenta. In clinical trials, vaccine virus
RNA has been detected by PCR in the plasma of most of the adult participants. Vaccine virus RNA
was mainly detected from Day 1 to Day 7. Shedding of vaccine virus has been detected by PCR in
urine or saliva in 19 out of 299 adult participants and in skin vesicles in 4 out of 10 adult participants.
The vaccine virus RNA was detected in a skin vesicle at 12 days post-vaccination in one of the four
participants.
In a Phase 1 study, vaccine viremia and viral shedding were observed more frequently (28/39) in
children and adolescents 6 to 17 years of age compared to adults. In a subsequent Phase 2 study,
31.7% (19/60) of children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age enrolled in a shedding sub-study shed
vaccine virus in saliva following vaccination. Viral shedding was observed more frequently on Day 7
and declined thereafter, with no shedding detected at Day 56.
Transmission of vaccine virus through close personal contact is accepted as a theoretical possibility.
Vaccine recipients should avoid close contact with and exposure of high-risk individuals to blood and
bodily fluids for at least 6 weeks following vaccination. High-risk individuals include:
• 
• 
Immunocompromised individuals and individuals receiving immunosuppressive therapy (see
section above), 
Pregnant or breast-feeding women (see section 4.6),
4
• 
Children <1 year of age.
Individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they
heal to minimise the risk of possible transmission of vaccine virus through open vesicles. Dispose of
contaminated bandages following institutional guidelines or WHO healthcare waste management
policy. See section 5.3.
Parents and caregivers of young vaccinees should observe careful hygiene especially when handling
bodily waste and fluids for a minimum of 6 weeks after vaccination. Disposable nappies can be sealed
in double plastic bags and disposed of in household waste. See section 5.3.
Inadvertent transmission of vaccine virus to animals and livestock is also theoretically possible, see
below. 
Individuals administered Ervebo should not donate blood for at least 6 weeks post-vaccination.
Transmission to animals and livestock
Transmission of vaccine virus through close contact with livestock is accepted as a theoretical
possibility. Vaccine recipients should attempt to avoid exposure of livestock to blood and bodily fluids
for at least 6 weeks following vaccination. Individuals who develop vesicular rash after receiving the
vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. Dispose of contaminated bandages following
institutional guidelines or WHO healthcare waste management policy. See section 5.3. 
Concurrent illness
Vaccination should be postponed in individuals experiencing moderate or severe febrile illness. The
presence of a minor infection should not result in deferral of vaccination.
Thrombocytopenia and coagulation disorders
The vaccine should be given with caution to individuals with thrombocytopenia or any coagulation
disorder because bleeding or bruising may occur following an intramuscular administration in these
individuals.
Protection against filovirus disease
The vaccine will not prevent disease caused by Filoviruses other than Zaire Ebola virus.
Impact to serological testing 
Following vaccination with Ervebo, individuals may test positive for Ebola glycoprotein (GP) nucleic
acids, antigens, or antibodies against Ebola GP, which are targets for certain Ebola diagnostic tests.
Therefore, diagnostic testing for Ebola should target non-GP sections of the Ebola virus.
Sodium
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, and is considered to be
essentially sodium-free. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed.
As there are no data on co-administration of Ervebo with other vaccines, the concomitant use of
Ervebo with other vaccines is not recommended.
5
Immune globulin (IG), blood or plasma transfusions should not be given concomitantly with Ervebo.
Administration of immune globulins, blood or plasma transfusions administered 3 months before or up
to 1 month after Ervebo administration may interfere with the expected immune response.
It is unknown whether concurrent administration of antiviral medication including interferons could
impact vaccine virus replication and efficacy.
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
There are limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of Ervebo in
pregnant women, or women who became pregnant after receiving the vaccine. The safety of Ervebo
has not been established in pregnant women. 
As there are limitations to available data, including the small number of cases, caution should be
exercised in drawing conclusions. Lack of reliable data on background rates of pregnancy and
neonatal outcomes in the affected regions also makes a contextual assessment of the data challenging. 
Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity
(see section 5.3).
As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of Ervebo during pregnancy. Nevertheless
considering the severity of EVD, vaccination should not be withheld when there is a clear risk of
exposure to Ebola infection.
Pregnancy should be avoided for 2 months following vaccination. Women of child-bearing potential
should use an effective contraceptive method. 
Breast-feeding
It is unknown whether the vaccine virus is secreted in human milk.
A risk to the newborns/infants from breast-feeding by vaccinated mothers cannot be excluded. 
Evaluation of the vaccine virus in animal milk has not been conducted. When Ervebo is administered
to female rats, antibodies against the vaccine virus were detected in offspring, likely due to acquisition
of maternal antibodies via placental transfer during gestation and via lactation. See section 5.3.
A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to abstain from Ervebo taking into
account the benefit of breast feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. In certain
circumstances, where alternatives to breast-feeding are limited, the immediate need and health benefits
to the infant should be taken into consideration and balanced with the mother’s need for Ervebo. Both
may present compelling needs that should be considered before vaccination of the mother.
Fertility
There are no data on fertility effects in humans.
Animal studies in female rats do not indicate harmful effects (see section 5.3).
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines
No studies on the effects of Ervebo on the ability to drive and use machines have been performed. 
Ervebo has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.

4.8  Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
For all age groups, anaphylaxis was reported very rarely (<1/10,000) in clinical trials. 
In adults 18 years of age and older, the most common injection-site adverse reactions reported
following vaccination with Ervebo were injection-site pain (70.3%), injection-site swelling (16.7%)
and injection-site erythema (13.7%). The most common systemic adverse reactions were headache
(55.1%), pyrexia (39.2%), myalgia (32.5%), somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue (25.5%), arthralgia
(18.6%), chills (16.7%), decreased appetite (15.2%), abdominal pain (13.0%), nausea (9.5%), arthritis
(3.7%), rash (3.6%), hyperhidrosis (3.2%), and mouth ulceration (2.2%). In general, these reactions
were reported within 7 days after vaccination, were mild to moderate in intensity, and had short
duration (less than 1 week).
In children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age, the most common injection-site adverse reactions
reported following vaccination with Ervebo were injection-site pain (41.6%), injection-site pruritus
(4.1%), injection-site swelling (3.0%) and injection-site erythema (0.5%). The most common systemic
adverse reactions were pyrexia (62.2%), headache (45.7%), somnolence, reduced activity, fatigue
(23.5%), decreased appetite (23.4%), myalgia (15.8%), dizziness (9.9%), crying (6.4%) and mouth
ulceration (2.5%). In general, these reactions were reported within 7 days after vaccination and were
mild to moderate in intensity.
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Frequencies are reported as:
Very common (≥1/10), Common (≥1/100 to <1/10), Uncommon (≥1/1,000 to <1/100), Rare
(≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000), Very rare (<1/10,000), Not known (cannot be estimated from the available
data). Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing
seriousness.
Individuals 1 year of age and older
Table 1 shows the adverse reactions considered as being at least possibly related to vaccination and
observed in recipients of Ervebo. 
For adults, the frequencies listed are based on the higher frequency reported in the Phase 2/3 placebo-
controlled randomised trials, Protocol 009, Protocol 012 and Protocol 016, that have included a total of
2,143 individuals.
For children and adolescents, the frequencies listed corresponds to those observed in Protocol 016, a
Phase 2 placebo-controlled randomised trial, that has included a total of 609 individuals (including
95 children from 1 to 3 years old, 310 children from 3 to 11 years old, and 204 children from 12 to
17 years old).

Pyrexia was reported more frequently in younger children 1 to <3 years of age (83.2%), compared to
children 3 to <12 years of age (64.8%), adolescents 12 to 17 years of age (48.3%) and adults (39.2%).
Otherwise, the safety profile of Ervebo in children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age was generally
similar to that observed in adults. 
Description of selected adverse reactions
Arthralgia and arthritis
Arthralgia was generally reported in the first few days following vaccination, was mild to moderate in
intensity, and resolved within one week after onset. Arthritis (arthritis, joint effusion, joint swelling,
osteoarthritis, monoarthritis or polyarthritis) was generally reported within the first few weeks
following vaccination. In clinical trials with reports of arthritis, the median onsets were between 10
and 12 days (range from 0 to 25 days). Arthritis has been reported by participants in clinical trials at a
frequency that ranged from 0% in several protocols to 23.5% in one Phase 1 study. The majority of
arthritis reactions were mild to moderate in severity. The median duration of arthritis across clinical
trials in which arthritis was reported ranged from 2 days to 81.5 days (including duration of recurrent
arthritis) with a maximum of 330 days. The reasons for differences in arthritis reporting across trials
are not known but may be due to differences in study populations or outcome reporting. In the Phase 1
study with the highest rate of arthritis, 6 of 24 patients (25%) who reported arthritis after vaccination
had persistent joint symptoms two years after vaccination. In a small number of participants, the
vaccine virus was recovered from joint effusion samples, suggestive of a virally-mediated process
post-vaccination. 
8
Rash
Rash was characterised in a variety of ways including generalised rash (2.3%), vesicular rash (0.5%),
dermatitis (0.3%), or cutaneous vasculitis (0.01%) in clinical trials. In different trials, rash was
reported with median onsets of 7.5 to 10.5 days (range from 0 to 47 days). The median durations
reported were between 6 to 18 days. In 6 out of 18 participants tested, the vaccine virus was detected
in rashes (described as dermatitis, vesicles or cutaneous vasculitis lesions) suggesting a virally
mediated process post-vaccination. 
Transient decrease in white blood cells
Transient decreases in counts of lymphocytes, neutrophils and total white blood cells in the first 3 days
following vaccination have been observed very commonly in Phase 1/2 studies; these events generally
resolved after the first week post-vaccination. No adverse events of infections were observed in
Phase 1/2 trials.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system
listed in Appendix V.
4.9  Overdose
No cases of overdose have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Vaccines, Viral Vaccine, ATC code: J07BX02
Mechanism of action
Ervebo consists of a live, attenuated recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus-based vector expressing
the envelope glycoprotein gene of Zaire Ebola virus (rVSV∆G-ZEBOV-GP). Immunisation with the
vaccine results in an immune response and protection from Zaire Ebola Virus Disease (EVD). The
relative contributions of innate, humoral and cell-mediated immunity to protection from Zaire Ebola
virus are unknown. 
Clinical immunogenicity and efficacy
The clinical development program included six Phase 2/3 clinical trials (Protocols 009, 012, 016 and
018). All participants received a single dose of vaccine except for a subset of participants in
Protocol 002 (n=30) and Protocol 016 (n=399) who received two doses.
Clinical efficacy
Clinical efficacy of Ervebo in adults was assessed in Protocol 010.
Protocol 010 (Ring vaccination study) was a Phase 3 open-label cluster-randomised trial of ring
vaccination (vaccinating contacts and contacts of contacts [CCCs] of index Ebola cases) which
evaluated efficacy and safety of Ervebo in Guinea. In this trial, 9,096 participants ≥18 years of age
who were considered CCCs of an index case with laboratory-confirmed EVD were randomised to
immediate (4,539 participants in 51 clusters) or 21 days delayed (4,557 participants in 47 clusters)
vaccination with Ervebo. Of those 9,096 participants, 4,160 received Ervebo (2,119 participants were
vaccinated in the immediate arm and 2,041 participants were vaccinated in the delayed arm). The
median age of consenting CCCs was 35 years old. The final primary analysis included 2,108
9
participants (51 clusters) vaccinated in the immediate arm and 1,429 participants (46 clusters) eligible
and consented on Day 0 in the delayed arm.
The final primary analysis was to assess efficacy against laboratory confirmed EVD by comparing
incidence of cases occurring 10 to 31 days post-randomisation for those vaccinated in the immediate
vaccination rings versus incidence of cases for participants who consented on Day 0 in the delayed
vaccination rings. Vaccine efficacy was 100% (unadjusted 95% CI: 63.5% to 100%; 95% CI adjusted
for multiplicity: 14.4% to 100%) (0 cases in the immediate arm; 10 cases in 4 rings in the delayed
arm). Randomisation was stopped after an interim analysis with a p=0.0036 that did not meet the pre-
specified alpha level of 0.0027. Of the 10 cases, 7 were in contacts, and 3 in contacts-of-contacts.
Uncertainties remain as to the level, duration and type of protection given the methodological
limitations and the exceptional circumstances experienced during the trial. 
Clinical immunogenicity
No immune correlates of protection have been defined.
Protocol 009, named Partnership for Research on Ebola Vaccines in Liberia (PREVAIL) was a Phase
2 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which evaluated the safety and immunogenicity
of Ebola vaccine candidates including Ervebo. This trial compared Ervebo to normal saline placebo in
1,000 adults ≥18 years of age in Liberia.
Protocol 011, named Sierra Leone Trial to Introduce a Vaccine against Ebola (STRIVE) was a
Phase 2/3 randomised open-label trial which evaluated safety and immunogenicity of Ervebo in adults
≥18 years of age working in healthcare facilities or on frontline activities related to the Ebola response
in Sierra Leone. In this trial, 8,673 adult participants were enrolled and 8,651 with valid consents
randomised to immediate (within 7 days of enrolment) or deferred (18 to 24 weeks after enrolment)
vaccination with Ervebo. An immunogenicity sub-study included 508 participants who were
vaccinated and provided samples for the assessment of immunogenicity.
Protocol 012 was a Phase 3 randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which evaluated the
safety and immunogenicity of three consistency lots and a high dose lot (approximately five times
higher than the dose in consistency lots and dose used in other Phase 2/3 trials) of Ervebo compared to
normal saline placebo. A total of 1,197 healthy participants 18 to 65 years of age were enrolled in the
US, Canada, and Spain.
Protocol 016, named Partnership for Research on Ebola VACcination (PREVAC), was a Phase 2
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial which evaluated the safety and immunogenicity of
Ervebo in participants who received: a single dose of Ervebo and normal saline placebo administered
56 days apart, two doses of Ervebo administered 56 days apart, or two doses of normal saline placebo.
In this trial, 998 children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age and 1,004 adults 18 years of age and
older were enrolled in Guinea, Liberia, Mali and Sierra Leone.
Protocol 018 was a Phase 3 open-label trial conducted in Guinea to evaluate the safety and
immunogenicity of Ervebo in vaccinated frontline workers 18 years of age and older that was
implemented as Part B of the Phase 3 ring vaccination study for Protocol 010. In this trial, a total of
2,115 participants were enrolled and 2,016 participants were vaccinated with Ervebo. An
immunogenicity sub-study included 1,217 participants who were vaccinated and provided samples for
the assessment of immunogenicity.
Immunogenicity data were obtained in Protocol 009 in Liberia, Protocol 011 in Sierra Leone,
Protocol 012 in the United States, Canada, and Europe, Protocol 016 in Guinea, Liberia, Mali, and
Sierra Leone, and Protocol 018 in Guinea. Gamma irradiation of specimens (from regions involved in
Ebola outbreaks) was performed to reduce risk of wild-type Ebola virus infection of laboratory
workers, but increased pre-vaccination glycoprotein enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (GP-
ELISA) immune responses by approximately 20% and decreased post-vaccination GP-ELISA and
plaque reduction neutralisation test (PRNT) immune responses by approximately 20%. Samples from
10
Protocol 012 were not gamma irradiated. Absence of gamma irradiation, lower baseline seropositivity
and other factors resulted in a higher immune response in Protocol 012.
Clinical immunogenicity in adults 18 years of age and older
Immunogenicity testing has been performed in Protocol 009, Protocol 011, Protocol 012, Protocol 016
and Protocol 018, and includes the assessment of binding immunoglobulin G (IgG) specific to purified
Kikwit ZEBOV GP by validated GP-ELISA as well as validated neutralisation of vaccine virus by a
PRNT.
As shown in Tables 2 and 3, the geometric mean titres (GMT) of GP-ELISA and PRNT increased
from pre-vaccination to post-vaccination.
Over 93.8% of vaccine recipients from Protocols 009, 011, 012, 016 and 018 met seroresponse criteria
defined as a ≥2-fold increase from baseline and ≥200 EU/mL at any time post-vaccination by GP-
ELISA and over 80.0% of participants met seroresponse criteria defined as a ≥4-fold increase from
baseline at any time post-vaccination by PRNT. Over 80.3% of participants continued to meet the
seroresponse criteria for GP-ELISA and over 63.8% of vaccine recipients continued to meet
seroresponse criteria for PRNT at 12 months. The clinical relevance of the immunogenicity data is
currently not known.

Paediatric population
Clinical immunogenicity in children and adolescents 1 to 17 years of age
As shown in Tables 4 and 5, the GMTs of GP-ELISA and PRNT increased from pre-vaccination to
post-vaccination. In Protocol 016, 95.7% of participants met seroresponse criteria defined as a ≥2-fold
increase from baseline and ≥200 EU/mL at any time post-vaccination by GP-ELISA and 95.8% of
participants met seroresponse criteria defined as a ≥4-fold increase from baseline at any time
post-vaccination by PRNT. At 12 months following vaccination, 93.2% of participants continued to
meet the seroresponse criteria for GP-ELISA and 95.3% continued to meet seroresponse criteria for
PRNT. Tables 4 and 5 provide a summary of GMTs for the GP-ELISA and for the PRNT,
respectively, by age range.
Immune responses after vaccination with Ervebo in children and adolescents were non-inferior to
those in adults at 1 month post-vaccination. The clinical relevance of the immunogenicity data is
currently not known.

Clinical Immunogenicity in Participants Receiving a Booster Dose
Although an increase in antibody responses was observed in children and adolescents (n=195), and
adults (n=194) after a second dose of Ervebo administered on Day 56 (Protocol 016), the increase in
antibody titres was not maintained above the single dose regimen (n=386 children and adolescents,
n=386 adults) at 12 months post-vaccination.
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties
Not applicable.
5.3  Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of repeated dose
toxicity and toxicity to reproduction and development.
When Ervebo was administered to female rats, antibodies against the vaccine virus were detected in
foetuses and offspring, likely due to trans-placental transfer during gestation and with the acquisition
of maternal antibodies during lactation, respectively (see section 4.6).
Ervebo administered to female rats had no effects on mating performance, fertility, or
embryonic/foetal development.
Ervebo administered to female rats had no effects on development or behaviour of the offspring.
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA)
The vaccine virus is a Genetically Modified Organism (GMO). An ERA was conducted to determine
the potential impact of this vaccine on human health and the environment. Because this vaccine is
based on VSV, a known pathogen in livestock (e.g. horses, cattle, pigs), the risk assessment included
species that are relevant for the wild type (wt) VSV backbone of this vaccine.
In a biodistribution study conducted in non-human primates, vaccine virus RNA was detected in
lymphoid organs up to 112 days post-vaccination. However, infectious virus was detected at Day 1
13
and persistent infectious virus was not detected at any subsequent timepoints measured (Days 56, 84
and 112).
Based on transient shedding data in adults and children from 1 year of age (n=5 for children from 1 to
<3 years of age), the results of a toxicity study in non-human primates, and lack of horizontal
transmission in pigs, the overall risk of Ervebo to human health and the environment is considered
negligible. However, as a precaution, vaccinees and caregivers should attempt to avoid exposure of
livestock to blood and bodily fluids from vaccinees for at least 6 weeks following vaccination to avoid
the theoretical risk of spread of the vaccine virus. For young vaccinees, if possible, soiled nappies can
be cleaned with appropriate detergents or disinfectants; disposable nappies can be sealed in double
plastic bags and disposed of in household waste for at least 6 weeks following vaccination. People
who develop vesicular rash after receiving the vaccine should cover the vesicles until they heal. Cover
the vaccination site or any vesicles with an adequate bandage (e.g. adhesive bandage or gauze and
tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact with vesicle fluid (see section
4.2). The bandage may be removed when there is no visible fluid leakage. To avoid unintended
exposure to livestock, ensure medical waste and other cleaning materials do not come in contact with
livestock.
See sections 4.4 and 6.6 for further information.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling
• 
• 
The vaccine is stored frozen at -80°C to -60°C and should be removed from the freezer and
thawed in less than 4 hours until no visible ice is present. Do not thaw the vial in a refrigerator
as it is not guaranteed that the vial will thaw in less than 4 hours. The thawed vial should then
be gently inverted several times prior to withdrawal with the syringe. The vaccine should appear
as a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid with no particulates visible. Discard the
vaccine if particulates are present. 
Withdraw the entire content of the vaccine from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe.
If feasible, the waste liquid from eye washes should be collected and decontaminated before
discarding into the drain.
Any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed in compliance with the institutional
guidelines for genetically modified organisms or biohazardous waste, as appropriate. 
If breakage/spillage were to occur, disinfectants such as aldehydes, alcohols and detergents are proven
to reduce viral infection potential after only a few minutes.

Contents of the pack and other information
1.  What Ervebo is and what it is used for
• 
• 
• 
Ervebo is a vaccine for people who are 1 year of age and older.
Ervebo is given to protect people from getting Ebola virus disease caused by the Zaire Ebola
virus, which is a type of Ebola virus. This vaccine will not protect against the other types of
Ebola virus.
Because Ervebo does not contain the whole Ebola virus, it cannot give people Ebola virus
disease.
Your healthcare worker may recommend receiving this vaccine in an emergency involving the spread
of Ebola virus disease.
What is Ebola?
• 
Ebola is a serious disease caused by a virus. If people get Ebola, it can kill them. People catch
Ebola from people or animals who are infected with Ebola or who died from Ebola.
• 
• 
• 
People can catch Ebola from blood and body fluids like urine, stools, saliva, vomit, sweat,
breast milk, semen and vaginal fluids of people who are infected with Ebola virus.
People can also catch Ebola from things that have touched the blood or body fluids of a person
or animal with Ebola (like clothes or objects in direct contact).
Ebola is not spread through the air, water or food.
Your healthcare worker will talk to you and then together you can decide if you or your child should
receive this vaccine.
2.  What you need to know before you or your child receives Ervebo
Do not receive Ervebo if you:
• 
are allergic to Ervebo, rice, or any of the other ingredients of this vaccine (listed in section 6).
24
You should not receive Ervebo if any of the above apply to you. If you are not sure, talk to your
healthcare worker.
Warnings and precautions
This vaccine might not protect everyone who receives it and the length of time you are protected from
Ebola by Ervebo is not known.
Continue to follow your healthcare worker’s recommendations to protect yourself from Ebola
infection after you get this vaccine.
Hand washing:
Washing your hands correctly is the most effective way to prevent the spread of dangerous germs, like
Ebola virus. It reduces the number of germs on the hands and so reduces their spread from person to
person.
Proper hand washing methods are described below;
• 
Use soap and water when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids. There is no
need to use antimicrobial soaps for washing hands.
• 
Use alcohol-based hand sanitiser when hands are not dirty. Do not use alcohol-based hand
sanitiser when hands are soiled with dirt, blood, or other body fluids.
In an area affected by Ebola:
While in an area affected by Ebola, it is important to avoid the following:
• 
Contact with blood and body fluids (such as urine, faeces, saliva, sweat, vomit, breast milk,
semen, and vaginal fluids).
Items that may have come in contact with an infected person’s blood or body fluids (such as
clothes, bedding, needles, and medical equipment).
Funeral or burial rituals that require handling the body of someone who died from Ebola.
Contact with bats, apes and monkeys or with blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from these
animals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.
Contact with semen from a man who had Ebola. You should follow safe sex practices until you
know the virus is gone from the semen. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
In case of rash:
If you get a rash where the skin is broken after receiving Ervebo, cover it until it heals. Put the used
plasters and bandages in a sealed container, if possible, and throw them in the waste bin to make sure
that people with a weak immune system or animals do not come into contact with the plasters and
bandages.
Taking care of children that have received Ervebo:
For at least 6 weeks after children receive this vaccine, it is important that you wash your hands
thoroughly after you have been in contact with blood or body fluids of vaccinated children. If possible
clean soiled nappies with appropriate detergents/disinfectants or if using disposable nappies, seal them
in double plastic bag and dispose of them in the household waste.
Talk to your healthcare worker before you receive Ervebo if you:
Have had allergic reactions to vaccines or medicines
• 
If you have ever had an allergic reaction to a vaccine or medicine, talk to your healthcare
worker before you receive this vaccine.
25
Have a weak immune system
If your immune system is weak (which means your body is less able to fight off diseases), you might
not be able to receive Ervebo. You might have a weak immune system if:
• 
• 
you are taking certain medicines that make your immune system weak such as
immunosuppressants or corticosteroids,
you have HIV infection or AIDS,
a member of your family has a weak immune system.
you have cancer or a blood problem that makes your immune system weak,
• 
• 
If you think you might have a weak immune system, ask your healthcare worker if you should receive
this vaccine. If you do get the vaccine and have a weak immune system, the vaccine may not work as
well as in people with a normal immune system.
Are in contact with vulnerable individuals
Tell your healthcare worker if in the 6 weeks after you receive Ervebo you might be in close contact
with or in the same household as:
• 
• 
• 
This is because you could pass on the virus in the vaccine to them through your body fluids.
someone who may be pregnant or breast-feeding,
someone who has a weak immune system.
babies who are less than 1 year old, 
Plan to donate blood
• 
Do not donate blood for at least 6 weeks after you receive this vaccine.
Are in contact with farm animals
Make sure your blood or body fluids do not come into close contact with farm animals for at least 6
weeks after you receive this vaccine. This is because of a possibility that you could pass on the virus in
the vaccine to the animals.
Have a fever (high temperature)
• 
If you have a fever (high temperature), you should talk to your healthcare worker before
receiving Ervebo. The vaccination may have to be delayed until your fever is gone.
• 
A minor infection such as a cold should not be a problem but talk to your healthcare worker
before receiving Ervebo.
Have a bleeding disorder or bruise easily
• 
Tell your healthcare worker if you have a problem with bleeding or you bruise easily. Ervebo
might make you bleed or bruise where the vaccine is injected.
Testing for Ebola after you receive Ervebo
• 
You may test positive for Ebola virus after you receive Ervebo. This does not mean that you
have Ebola. Tell your healthcare worker that you have received Ervebo. Your healthcare worker
might need to do another test.
Children younger than 1 year of age
If your child is under 1 year old, talk to your healthcare worker. It is not known if this medicine is safe
and works in children under 1 year old.
Other medicines and Ervebo
Tell your healthcare worker if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other medicines or
vaccines.
No studies have looked at how other medicines or vaccines and Ervebo might interact with each other.
Use of Ervebo with other vaccines is not recommended.
26
If you plan to receive blood or blood products
Do not receive this vaccine at the same time that you get blood or blood products. Ervebo might not
work as well if you get blood or blood products 3 months before or up to 1 month after vaccination.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
•  If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby,
ask your healthcare worker for advice before you receive this vaccine. They will help you decide if
you should receive Ervebo.
•  Do not become pregnant for 2 months after you receive Ervebo. Women who are able to become
pregnant should use an effective method of birth control. It is not known if Ervebo will harm the
mother or the unborn baby. It is also not known if it can pass to the baby through breast milk.
•  If you might be in close contact with, or in the same household as someone who may be pregnant
or breast-feeding during the 6 weeks after you receive Ervebo, tell your healthcare worker. This is
because you could pass the vaccine to them through your body fluids.
Ervebo contains sodium
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially ‘sodium–
free’.
3.  How Ervebo is given
Ervebo is given by a healthcare worker. It is given as a single injection (dose of 1 mL) in the top of the
arm or the outside of the thigh.
If you have any further questions on the use of this vaccine, ask your healthcare worker.
4. 
Possible side effects
Like all vaccines, Ervebo can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

The following information is intended for healthcare professionals only:
Standard precautions when caring for patients with known or suspected Ebola disease
Vaccination with Ervebo does not eliminate the necessity of standard precautions when caring for
patients with known or suspected Ebola disease. All healthcare workers, and other ancillary
providers who have been vaccinated, should not alter their practices with regard to safe
injection, hygiene, and personal protective equipment (PPE) after vaccination. 
Basic hand hygiene
Respiratory hygiene
Standard precautions, as outlined by WHO, include the following:
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Safe injection practices
Safe burial practices
Use of PPE (to block splashes or other contact with infected materials)
Healthcare workers caring for patients with suspected or confirmed Ebola virus should apply extra
infection control measures to prevent contact with the patient’s blood and body fluids and
contaminated surfaces or materials such as clothing and bedding. When in close contact (within 1
metre) of patients with Ebola Virus Disease, healthcare workers should wear face protection (a face
shield or a medical mask and goggles), a clean, non-sterile long-sleeved gown, and gloves (sterile
gloves for some procedures).
Laboratory workers are also at risk. Samples taken from humans and animals for investigation of
Ebola infection should be handled by trained staff and processed in suitably equipped laboratories.
Vaccine administrators should counsel vaccinees to continue to protect themselves with the following
measures:
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hand washing 
Safe burial practices
Safe sex
Avoid contact with blood and body fluids 
31
• 
Avoid contact with bats and non-human primates or blood, fluids and raw meat prepared from
these animals (bushmeat) or meat from an unknown source.
Instructions on the handling of the vaccine before administration
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Ervebo is stored frozen at -80°C to -60°C and should be removed from the freezer and thawed
in less than 4 hours until no visible ice is present. Do not thaw the vial in a refrigerator as it is
not guaranteed that the vial will thaw in less than 4 hours. The thawed vial should then be gently
inverted several times prior to withdrawal with the syringe.
After thawing, Ervebo should be used immediately; however, in-use stability data have
demonstrated that once thawed, the vaccine can be stored for up to 14 days at 2°C to 8°C prior
to use. At the end of 14 days, the vaccine should be used or discarded. Upon removal from the
freezer, the product should be marked with both the date that it was taken out of the freezer and
also a new discard date (in place of the labelled expiry date). Once thawed, the vaccine cannot
be re-frozen.
Ervebo is a colourless to slightly brownish-yellow liquid. Discard the vaccine if particulates are
present.
Ervebo should be administered intramuscularly. Do not inject the vaccine intravascularly. No
data are available for administration via the subcutaneous or intradermal routes.
Ervebo should not be mixed in the same syringe with any other vaccines or medicinal products.
Withdraw the entire content of Ervebo from the vial using a sterile needle and syringe. The
preferred injection site is the deltoid area of the non-dominant arm or in the higher anterolateral
area of the thigh. Cover the injection site with gauze or bandage (e.g. any adhesive bandage or
gauze and tape) that provides a physical barrier to protect against direct contact with vesicle
fluid. The bandage may be removed when there is no visible fluid leakage.
Any unused vaccine or waste material should be disposed of in compliance with the institutional
guidelines for genetically modified organisms or biohazardous waste, as appropriate. If
breakage/spillage were to occur, disinfectants such as aldehydes, alcohols and detergents are
proven to reduce viral infection potential after only a few minutes. If feasible, the waste liquid
from eye washes should be collected and decontaminated before discarding into the drain.

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant bene-Arzneimittel GmbH submitted on 4 February 2016 an application for marketing 
authorisation to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for elmiron, through the centralised procedure 
falling within the Article 3(1) and point 4 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. The eligibility to 
the centralised procedure was agreed upon by the EMA/CHMP on 25 June 2015. 
elmiron was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/14/1411 on 15 January 2015 in the 
following condition: ‘Treatment of Interstitial Cystitis’. 
Following the CHMP positive opinion and at the time of the review of the orphan designation by the 
Committee on Orphan Medicinal Products (COMP), this product was withdrawn from the Community 
Register of designated orphan medicinal products on 11.04.2017 on request of the sponsor. 
The applicant initially applied for the following indication: 
‘elmiron is indicated in adults for the treatment of Interstitial Cystitis’. During the procedure, on 
01.03.2017, the applied indication was changed to ‘elmiron is indicated for the treatment of bladder 
pain syndrome characterized by either glomerulations or Hunner’s lesions in adults with moderate to 
severe pain, urgency and frequency of micturition’. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 10(a) of Directive 2001/83/EC – relating to applications relying on well-established medicinal 
use supported by bibliographic literature. 
The application submitted is composed of administrative information, complete quality data, non-
clinical and clinical data based on bibliographic literature substituting all non-clinical tests and clinical 
studies. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Not applicable 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with 
authorised orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a 
condition related to the proposed indication. 
Protocol Assistance 
The applicant received protocol Assistance from the CHMP on 23 July 2015. The Protocol Assistance 
pertained to quality, non-clinical and clinical aspects of the dossier.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Oral  pentosan  polysulfate  sodium  (PPS)  is  already  approved  under  the  invented  name  Elmiron  in 
Canada  for  the  initial  and  maintenance  treatment  of  interstitial  cystitis  (IC)  since  April  1993,  in 
Australia for the treatment of IC since February 1994 and in the United States for relief of bladder pain 
or discomfort associated with IC since September 1996. Regulatory approval of the product in Canada, 
Australia  and  in  the  United  States  was  mainly  based  on  the  favourable  results  of  two  pivotal  clinical 
trials showing subjective improvements in pain, urgency, frequency and nocturia under treatment with 
PPS compared to placebo (Mulholland et al 1990, Parsons et al 1993). 
The  term  BPS  (bladder  pain  syndrome)  rather  than  interstitial  cystitis  (IC)  was  put  forward  by  the 
International Society for the Study of BPS (ESSIC) and is currently used in European guidelines and by 
the experts in the field. In accordance with the advice of the ad hoc expert group convened during this 
procedure and the ESSIC classification (Engeler et al 2015) the CHMP considered that the definition of 
former  IC  at  the  time  when  most  of  the  pivotal  studies  were  performed  would,  as  per  todays 
classification,  fall  under  BPS  characterized  by  glomerulations  or  Hunner’s  lesions  (i.e.  BPS  type  2X  – 
3C. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Interstitital  Cystitis  (IC)  is  a  chronic,  debilitating  disorder,  distressing  bladder  condition,  which  is 
characterised by pelvic pain associated with bladder filling, pollakiuria with a voiding frequency of more 
than eight urinations per day and more than two urinations per night, cystoscopic lesions (petechiae, 
Hunner's  ulcers)  revealed  by  a  bladder  hydrodistention  test,  and/or  histological  anomalies  such  as 
inflammatory  mononuclear  cell  infiltrates  and  tissue  granulation,  in  the  absence  of  infection  or  any 
other pathology. The clinical picture is dominated by pain and pollakiuria. Although the pain is usually 
described  as  pelvic,  it  may  also  involve  the  perineum,  vagina,  suprapubically  radiating  to  the  groins, 
rectum,  sacrum,  scrotum  and  urethra.  It  becomes  more  severe  upon  bladder  filling  with  relief  after 
urination. The pollakiuria is the consequence of a nearly constant urge to urinate, which increases with 
bladder filling and is relieved by urination. However, patients do not display urinary incontinence and 
have symptoms of interstitial cystitis for an average of 7 years before diagnosis is made.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Interstitial cystitis is a rare condition. 90% of the patients are afflicted women in their fifth and sixth 
decades  of  life.  Symptoms  often  resemble  those  of  patients  with  overactive  bladder.  Up  to  50%  of 
patients with symptoms of interstitial cystitis will have spontaneous resolution in time. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
There  are  many  and  different  hypotheses  about  the  causes  of  IC,  including  infection,  inflammation, 
autoimmune  mechanisms,  hormonal  troubles,  defects  in  the  urothelial  glycosaminoglycan  layer, 
hypoxia, and central neurologic mechanisms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 9/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  aetiology  is  unknown  but  some  triggering  factors  such  as  certain  acid  foods  (coffee  or  citrus 
products), bacterial cystitis, pelvic surgery, delivery are hypothesised.  
Other  pathologies  can  be  associated  such  as  fibromyalgia,  chronic  fatigue  syndrome,  irritable  bowel 
syndrome,  vulvodynia,  depression,  panic  disorders,  migraine,  sicca  syndrome,  temporomandibular 
joint disorder, allergy, asthma and systemic lupus erythematosus. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The  diagnosis  of  IC  /  BPS  is  primarily  one  of  exclusion,  using  symptoms,  examination,  urine  analysis 
and  urine  culture  (to  rule  out  a  urinary  tract  infection),  cystoscopy  with  hydrodistension  (to  rule  out 
bladder  cancer,  vesical  stones,  urethral  diverticula  and  intravesical  foreign  bodies),  and  biopsy  (to 
exclude other pathologies). 
Differentiation is reflected in the standardised scheme for the classification of BPS Types as published 
by  the  European  Society  for  the  Study  of  IC/PBS  (ESSIC)  (see  Table  1).  Cases  meeting  the  ESSIC 
classification 2X to 3C would meet the NIDDK criteria for IC.  
Table 1 ESSIC classification of types of BPS according to the results of cystoscopy with 
hydrodistension and biopsies 
2.1.5.  Management 
There  is  no  consensus  regarding  the  optimal  treatment  approach  for  this  condition.    The  difficulty  in 
treating  IC/BPS  derives  from  several  factors,  including  (i)  the  lack  of  a  clear  understanding  of  the 
aetiology  of  the  disorder.  This  precludes  development  of  therapies  targeted  at  the  underlying 
pathophysiology; (ii) the symptoms of IC/BPS vary considerably across patients; (iii) the definitions of 
the condition and of measure of therapeutic outcomes vary; (iv) there are few high quality data (e.g., 
randomized trials) regarding the efficacy and safety of IC/BPS treatments. No treatment is consistently 
effective in providing relief for all patients. 
All  available  treatment  options  thus  far  are  purely  symptomatic.  There  are  no  medicinal  products 
approved for the treatment of IC in Europe. Current treatment options include: 
• 
Off-label  enteral  and  parenteral  use  of  medicinal  products  (analgesics,  corticosteroids,  anti-
allergics,  PPS,  Hydroxyzine,  Amitriptyline,  antibiotics,  immunosuppressants,  Gabapentin,  Pregabalin, 
and Quercetin)

• 
• 
• 
Bladder (hydro-) distension 
Intravesical application of medicinal products and medical devices (DMSO, PPS…) 
Surgery 
Existing  evidence  of  efficacy  and  safety  of  PPS,  when  used  for  relief  of  bladder  pain  and  other  signs 
and symptoms of IC, lead to the recommendation to use PPS in European Treatment Guidelines for the 
treatment of bladder pain syndrome or IC. In the Guidelines on Chronic Pelvic Pain, which are released 
by the European Association of Urology since 2004 (Fall et al. 2004) oral usage of PPS is recommended 
as  standard  treatment  for  the  therapy  of  bladder  pain  syndrome  “BPS”  already  in  the  first  version  of 
these guidelines from 2004 until 2015 (strong recommendation (A) was given with a grade 1a level of 
evidence).  In  addition,  a  review  article  on  treatment  guidelines  for  classic  and  non-ulcer  IC  from  the 
year 2000 lists oral treatment with PPS as an established treatment option for IC (Peeker et al. 2000). 
However,  the  guideline  of  the  American  Association  of  Urology  published  in  2014,  gives  a  more 
conservative recommendation (evidence level given as “B”) due to conflicting results of clinical studies 
and the guideline of the 5th International consultation on incontinence (Paul Abrams et al, 5th edition 
2013) gives a grade recommendation of D with a level of evidence 1.  
In  the  respective  US  treatment  guideline  (AUA  guideline,  2014),  PPS  is  recommended  as  second-line 
treatment  (Grade  B  recommendation)  after  patient  education,  self-care  practices  and  behavioural 
modifications or stress management practices, which are recommended as first-line treatment for IC in 
the US (Hanno et al.,2014).  
Indeed,  there  are  many  therapeutic  approaches  for  IC/BPS  and  none  are  proven  to  be  helpful  for  all 
patients  with  IC/BPS.  One  of  the  standards  of  care  is  to  treat  IC/BPS  with  a  stepwise  approach 
(therapies for IC/BPS  vary by the risk of adverse effects and the invasiveness of the treatment). 1st 
line: self-care and behaviour modification (local heat or cold over the bladder or perineum, avoidance 
of activities or food or beverages that exacerbate symptoms, fluid management, Bladder training with 
urge  suppression);  2nd  line:  physical  therapy  (treatment  of  the  pelvic  muscle  tender  points,  trigger 
points,  connective  tissue  restrictions,  and  muscular  abnormalities  of  the  soft  tissues  by  a  physical 
therapist) and oral medications (amitriptyline, pentosan polysulfate sodium  (PPS), antihistamines (eg, 
hydroxyzine); 3rd line: bladder hydrodistention, treatment of Hunner lesions (by resection, electrical 
cauterization,  or  injection  of  these  lesions  with  a  corticosteroid),  and  intravesical  dimethyl  sulfoxide; 
4th line: intradetrusor botulinum toxin and sacral neuromodulation; 5th line: Cyclosporine A; 6th line: 
urinary  diversion  (removing  the  ureters  from  the  bladder  and  diverting  the  urine  into  an  incontinent 
urostomy  or  a  continent  catheterizable  urine  pouch).  An  alternative  approach  is  an  individualized 
treatment plan tailored to the patient’s primary symptoms. 
The  most  recent  version  of  the  European  Guidelines  on  Chronic  Pelvic  Pain  (Engeler  et  al.,  2015) 
recommend  to  always  consider  multimodal  behavioural,  physical  and  psychological  techniques 
alongside  oral  or  invasive  treatments.  For  patients  with  BPS  Type  3C,  who  have  Hunner’s  lesions  at 
cystoscopy,  treatment  with  Transurethral  resection  (TUR)  or  laser  was  recommended  if  the  patient  is 
eligible.  In  case  the  patient  is  not  eligible  or  the  response  is  inadequate  for  these  interventional 
treatments initiation of treatment with oral agents is recommended. 
About the product 
The active substance pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) is a semi-synthetically produced heparin-like 
macromolecular 
carbohydrate 
derivative,  which 
chemically 
and 
structurally 
resembles 
glycosaminoglycans. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017

PPS  is  a  low  molecular  weight  heparin-like  compound.  It  has  anticoagulant,  fibrinolytic,  and  anti-
inflammatory effects. The exact mechanism of action of PPS in the treatment of IC/BPS is unknown. It 
is hypothesized, that a potential barrier function of PPS instead of the damaged urothelial mucus might 
play a role as well the anti-inflammatory activity of PPS. 
Indication 
elmiron is indicated for the treatment of bladder pain syndrome characterized by either glomerulations 
or Hunner’s lesions in adults with moderate to severe pain, urgency and frequency of micturition 
Posology 
The recommended dose of pentosan polysulfate sodium is 300 mg/day taken as one 100 mg capsule 
orally three times daily.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
elmiron  is  submitted  under  Article  10a  (well-established  use)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  (as  amended) 
via the centralised procedure. 
In  accordance  with  Article  10a  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  the  application  shall  rely  on  appropriate 
scientific literature substituting non-clinical tests and clinical studies if it can be demonstrated that the 
active substance of a medicinal product has been in well-established medicinal use within the European 
Union for at least 10 years, with a recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety. In this regard, 
the provisions of Annex I (Part II.1) to Directive 2001/83/EC shall apply.  
The requirements, described in Article 10a read in combination with the abovementioned Annex I, are 
discussed below: 
(1) The time over which PPS has been used in Europe for the treatment of IC: 
The  first  information  on  the  usage  of  PPS  in  European  Union  is  provided  in  publications  of  clinical 
studies  conducted  in the EU  for  the  treatment  of  IC  in  1986  –  1997  :  an  early  case  report  about the 
use  of  PPS  in  11  patients  with  IC  was  published  in  Germany  (Beer  et  al  1986)  ,  a  multicentre  open-
label study in 87 patients conducted in 12 centres in Sweden and 5 centres in Finland (Fritjfsson et al 
1987), including one of the pivotal studies (randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled) conducted in 
Europe  which  enrolled  115  patients  in  7  centres  in  Denmark  and  the  UK  (Holm-Bentzen  et  al  1987). 
Another  randomized  active-controlled  study  comparing  PPS  versus  Cyclosporine  A  was  conducted  in 
Europe and published in 2005. This study enrolled 64 patients in 7 Finnish urological units (Sairanen et 
al  2005).  A  clinical  study  conducted  in  Germany  included  58  patients  in  order  to  evaluate  the  safety 
and efficacy of subcutaneous low-dose heparin application on top of oral PPS application (Van Ophoven 
et al 2005). 
In  the  Guidelines  on  Chronic  Pelvic  Pain,  which  are  released  by  the  European  Association  of  Urology 
since  2004  (Fall  et  al.  2004),  the  oral  usage  of  PPS  is  recommended  as  standard  treatment  for  IC 
already  in  the  first  version  of  these  guidelines  from  2004.  PPS  was  recommended  as  standard 
treatment in this indication in all following updates of this European Guidance up to today (Fall et al., 
2008; Fall et al., 2010; Engeler et al., 2012; Engeler et al., 2014; Engeler et al., 2015). In addition, a 
review  article  on  treatment  guidelines  for  classic  and  non-ulcer  IC  from  the  year  2000  lists  oral 
treatment with PPS as an established treatment option for IC (Peeker et al., 2000). 
Several national European patient associations confirmed relevant usage of PPS for the treatment of IC 
at  least  since  1996.  Respective  statements  are  provided  by  e.g.  the  German  IC  associations  and  the 
multinational IC Association covering France, Germany, Belgium, The Netherlands and Austria.

In Germany Pentosan-polysulfat SP54 (25 mg) is commercially available since 1949 and used off-label 
for  the  treatment  of  IC  (Sievert  et  al  2000,  recent  survey  conducted  in  Germany  in  2014-2015  (see 
also quantitative aspects below).  
Furthermore,  several  publications  in  German  medical  literature  (textbooks  and  publications)  refer  to 
the usage of Pentosanpolysulfat SP54 for the treatment of IC:

Further evidence on the systematic and continuous use of PPS for the treatment of Interstitial Cystitis 
(IC would, as per todays classification, fall under BPS 2X-3C i.e. bladder pain syndrome characterized 
by either glomerulations or Hunner’s lesions) over at least one decade were provided via documented 
compassionate  use  usage  in  France,  Norway  and  the  UK  (see  quantitative  aspects  of  the  use  of  PPS 
below).  
(2) The quantitative aspects of the use of PPS: 
For  an  estimation  of  the  past  and  current  quantitative  use  in  Europe,  the  Applicant  provided  the 
following information about the use of PPS throughout Europe: 
•  Germany:  
According to a survey of the health care situation of patients with interstitial cystitis and bladder pain 
syndrome in Germany conducted in 2010 (Jocham et al 2013) which was based on 270 questionnaires 
returned  by  the  patients.  42.22%  of  these  patients  mentioned  that  they  have  been  treated  with  oral 
PPS.  
Another survey conducted by the Market research made by Medimed GmbH revealed relevant off-label 
use  of  Pentosanpolysulfat  SP54  in  2013-2015:  ~4000  prescriptions,  assuming  185  treatment 
courses/12 months, or 1.3% of the potential IC patients in Germany. These prescriptions clearly refer 
to  the  diagnostic  code  ICD  N30.1  (chronic  Interstitial  Cystitis).  The  diagnostic  code,  which  is  used  in 
clinical practice for BPS is R10.2 (Pelvic and perineal pain). The latest data received from IMS Health 
supplement  the  data  collected  by  MediMed  (MediMed  belongs  to  IMS  Health)  and  confirm  a  constant 
off-label  use  of  approximately  2000  prescriptions  per  year  for  the  treatment  of  IC  (ICD  N30.1)  (see 
Table 2).

Based on the fact that the recommendation to use PPS for the treatment of IC did not change over the 
last 15 years as demonstrated above by listing different articles and treatment guidelines from 2000 to 
today,  it  can  be  assumed,  that  comparable off  label  use  of  Pentosanpolysulfat  SP54  also  appeared  in 
the previous years, although the conducted survey just covered the last four years. 
•  UK:  
Prescription cost analysis conducted by HSCIC for the years 2003 to 2014 for the treatment of IC (that 
is not reimbursed), provided information on prescriptions of Elmiron authorised outside the EU for the 
treatment  of  IC  and  PPS  100  mg  capsules  assuming  from  97  to  209  treatment  courses  of  3  month 
duration annually, or ~2 to 3% of the potential IC patients in UK. The NHS prescription cost analysis 
for  England  2013  reports  that  approximately  400  community  prescriptions  for  pentosan  were 
dispensed in 2013.

IMS  Health  data  provided  information  about  Elmiron  prescriptions  in  the  treatment  of  IC,  assuming 
from  56  to  110  treatment  courses  of  3  month  duration  annually,  or  7  to  12%  of  the  potential  IC 
patients in Norway. 
Next  to  the  use  in  Germany,  UK,  France,  and  Norway,  limited  information  from  further  European 
countries documenting the use of PPS for the treatment of IC was found for Poland, Italy and Sweden. 
In  addition,  the  Applicant  provided  the  quantity  of  PPS  bene  pharmaChem  GmbH  delivered  to 
pharmacies  for  magistral  preparation  of  PPS  in  Germany,  in  Austria  and  Netherlands  from  2003  to 
2014. The major part of the supplied drug substance was used as oral preparations for the treatment 
of IC. 
The  applicant  provided  information  regarding  the  dose  regimens  used  in  the  different  European 
countries.    Taking  into  account  treatment  recommendations  over  the  last  15  years  as  demonstrated 
above by listing different articles and treatment guidelines from 2000 it can be assumed that at least a 
significant  part  of  the  Elmiron  prescription  was  in  line  with  the  respective  label  of  the  imported 
products. 
Taking into account the rarity of the condition the Applicant has provided sufficient evidence supporting 
extensive  and  continued  usage  of  PPS  either  as  Pentosanpolysulfat  SP54  or  via  the  US-medicinal 
product Elmiron for the treatment of IC (bladder pain syndrome characterized by either glomerulations 
or Hunner’s lesions) over more than 10 years in Europe in the claimed indication. 
(3)  The  degree  of  scientific  interest  in  the  use  of  PPS  (as  it  is  reflected  in  the  published 
scientific literature): 
Publications  in  peer-reviewed  journals  concerning  the  epidemiology  of  Interstitial  Cystitis  were 
collected  by  extensive  use  of  PubMed  Central  archive  at  the  U.S.  National  Institutes  of  Health's 
National Library of Medicine (NIH/NLM).  
To identify relevant studies, the following control terms were used: 
- "cystitis, interstitial" OR ("cystitis" AND "interstitial") OR "interstitial cystitis"  
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 16/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
AND  
-  "pentosan  sulfuric  polyester"  OR  ("pentosan"  AND  "sulfuric"  AND  "polyester")  OR  ("pentosan"  AND 
"polysulfate") OR "pentosan polysulfate". 
Relevant publications identified after first review of the abstracts were studied in more detail to extract 
the  required  information.  In  addition,  relevant  references  cited  in  publications  identified  above  were 
hand searched and evaluated. 
The  continuous  scientific  interest  in  PPS  for  the  treatment  of  IC  is  documented  by  the  number  of 
publications  over  time  available  on  this  topic:  A  review  of  Pubmed  (26.5.2015)  identified  2,857 
documents 
found 
for 
“Cystitis, 
Interstitial”[mesh],  and  154  adding 
“Pentosan  Sulfuric 
Polyester”[mesh].  In  the  following  figure  GoPubMed  (www.gopubmed.org,  Transinsight  GmbH, 
Germany) was used to provide chronological information on the occurrence of publications on PPS for 
the treatment of IC in the MEDLINE database. 
• 
Pubmed  database  review  identified  158  publications  from  1978  (32  from  Europe),  toping  to 
~15/year in 2008 and ~3/year during last 3 years 
•  German  Institute  of  Medical  Documentation  and  Information  (DIMDI)  database  review 
identified 209 publications and German National Library of Medicine (LIVIVO) database – 197 
publications. 
The  Applicant  has  undertaken  a  comprehensive  review  of  the  literature  published  on  the  use  of  the 
product  in  IC/PBS  and  found  between  158  and  209  publications  especially  from  1997  to  2014  in  the 
different  databases  in  Europe.  The  majority  of  publications  were  published  in  North  America  (86 
publications  over  158)  and  32  publications  were  published  in  Europe.  The  latter  are  relevant  for  the 
demonstration  of  the  degree  of  scientific  interest  in  the  EU.  Based  on  these  figures,  the  degree  of 
scientific  interest  for  PPS  was  at  its  maximum  in  2006-2008  (14-16  publications/  year)  and  it  still 
maintains a mean level of about 4-5 publications per year.  
Overall, the submitted EU references are considered sufficient evidence of scientific interest in the EU.

(4) The coherence of scientific assessments: 
In  addition  to  the  efficacy  and  safety  data  from  the  6  pivotal  studies,  the  meta-analysis,  the  9 
supportive studies and the safety review from a total of more than 4700 patients which are submitted 
for evaluation in this application, the Applicant provided all the European recommendations:  
• 
European Association of Urology in their Guidelines of chronic pelvic pain (recommends to use 
PPS  for  the  treatment  of  bladder  pain  syndrome/IC  since  2004),  the  recent  guidelines  were 
published in 2015 (Engeler et al 2015) and recommends oral usage of PPS for the treatment of 
bladder pain syndrome (level 1a)  
•  Review article on treatment guidelines for classic and non-ulcer IC form year 2000 lists PPS as 
an established treatment option for IC (Peeker et al 2000),  
• 
Four  clinical  trials  conducted  in  Europe  (Holm-Bentzen  et  al.,  1987;  Fritjofsson  et  al.,  1987; 
Sairanen et al., 2005; and van Ophoven et al., 2005) are not directly comparable but efficacy 
is consistent with the observations in the studies conducted in the US.  
The  European  Guidelines  recommend  PPS  as  standard  of  care  for  the  treatment  of  bladder  pain 
syndrome/  IC  since  2004  (strong  recommendation  (A)  was  given  with  a  grade  1a  level  of  evidence) 
(Fall et al. 2004) and in all the updated version of these guidelines since 2004 (Fall et al 2008, Fall et 
al 2010, Engeler et al 2012, Engeler et al 2014, Engeler et al 2015). This is consistent with the recent 
recommendations of the American association of Urology (Hanno et al 2014) which recommend PPS in 
second  line  treatment  of  PBS  after  the  self-care  practices  and  behavioural  modifications  (Grade  B 
recommendation). Therefore, PPS is recognized by European and international experts as an effective 
and safe treatment since more than 10 years. 
For conclusion on the scientific assessment please refer to the Benefit / Risk discussion at the end of 
this report. 
 (5) The similarity of the claimed formulation to the formulations examined in the literature 
The applicant has developed a medicinal product: 
- with an active substance quality identical to US Elmiron (same manufacturer) 
- with a quantitative composition, with the exception of the capsule shell, identical to the US Elmiron 
on which are based the clinical studies described in EU (and non-EU) literature.  
Formulation  and  manufacturing  process  are  simple and  standard:    excipients  used  are  typical  for  the 
dosage form, drug substance represents approx. 44% w/w of the total capsule filling weight.  
In vitro dissolution results at pH 1.0 4.5 and 6.8 are similar for the PPS drug product and the product 
used in the literature, both products show a very rapid dissolution >85% within 15 min. Therefore, the 
profiles can be considered similar in accordance with appendix I of the Guideline on the Investigation 
of  Bioequivalence.  The  results  support  the  proof  of  bioequivalence  between  the  medicinal  product 
under application and the product Elmiron used in the literature and fulfil the requirements for a BCS-
biowaiver approach for class III drug substances in accordance with appendix III. 
Conclusion on the well-established use 
As  a  conclusion  of  the  assessment  of  the  above  criteria,  the  CHMP  is  of  the  view  that  the  applicant 
provides  sufficient  evidence  to  establish  that  the  elements  related  to  the  quantitative  aspects  of  the 
use  of  the  substance,  the  time  over  which  the  substance  has  been  used,  the  degree  of  scientific 
interest  in  the  use  of  the  substance  in  the  EU  and  the  coherence  of  the  scientific  assessments  are 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017

fulfilled. Documentation presented can be considered adequate to show similarity of the drug product 
with the product used in the publications. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as hard capsules containing 100 mg of pentosan polysulfate sodium 
as active substance. 
Other ingredients of the capsule contents are microcrystalline cellulose and magnesium stearate. 
Ingredients of the capsule shell are gelatin and titanium dioxide (E171).  
The product is available in HDPE bottle with a tamper-evident PP child resistant closure and PVC/Aclar-
Aluminium blisters, as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
The information on pentosan polysulfate sodium is provided according to the Active Substance Master 
File (ASMF) procedure. 
The chemical name of pentosan polysulfate sodium is (1→4)-β-D–xylan 2,3–bis (hydrogen sulfate) 
sodium salt corresponding to the molecular formula (C5H6Na2O10S2)n and has weight average molecular 
weight (obtained by light scattering and gel chromatography) of approximately 5760 g/mol and 
number average molecular weight (the ordinary arithmetic mean or average of the molecular masses 
of the individual macromolecules) of approximately 3863 g/mol. The polydispersity index is 
approximately 1.49. Pentosan polysulfate sodium is a semi-synthetic polymer - a heparin-like 
macromolecular carbohydrate derivative - sulfated polyxylose which chemically and structurally 
resembles glycosaminoglycans. It has the following structure: 
Figure 1 Structural formula of pentosan polysulfate sodium. R = SO3Na 
The structure of pentosan polysulfate sodium was confirmed using a combination of FTIR spectroscopy, 
XRD, 1H-NMR and 13C-NMR spectroscopy. The molecular weight distribution data was obtained using a 
combination of light scattering and gel chromatography. Chiral centres of the active substance 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 19/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
originate in the pentosan starting material which is extracted from beech wood. Enantiomeric purity is 
controlled routinely by optical rotation. 
The active substance is a hygroscopic, faintly yellow powder, very soluble in water and insoluble in 
most organic solvents. Due to very high solubility in aqueous media, control of the active substance 
particle size is not critical to ensure a consistent performance in vivo. Due to low permeability, 
pentosan polysulfate sodium is classified as BCS-class III substance. 
There is no monograph of pentosan polysulfate sodium in the European Pharmacopoeia. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted 
part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
A single manufacturer carries out the entire process. The active substance is synthesized in 10 main 
steps using a commercially available well defined starting material with acceptable specifications. At 
the request of CHMP, additional information about the beech tree plant material used for production of 
the regulatory starting material was provided, in line with the EMA quality Q&A on semi-synthetic 
active substances from herbal origin and the relevant Ph. Eur. monographs, thereby ensuring the 
quality of the active substance. Reprocessing can be performed by repetition of purification steps 
according to the established manufacturing process in accordance with ICH guideline Q7A. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for starting material and reagents have been presented. There are no intermediates in the 
manufacturing process of the active substance. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The proposed packaging materials comply with all applicable requirements. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for properties (visual inspection), identity (TLC, visible 
spectrum spectrophotometry, a further chromatographic method, IR), optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), 
transparency (Ph. Eur.), refractive index (Ph. Eur.), pH value (Ph. Eur.), viscosity (Ph. Eur.), purity 
(UV), loss on drying (Ph. Eur.), sulfated ash (Ph. Eur.), heavy metals (Ph. Eur.), microbiological tests 
(Ph. Eur.), further inorganic and organic impurities, residual solvents (multiple Ph. Eur. methods) and 
assay (UV/VIS spectrophotometry and chromatographic methods) 
The acceptance criteria of the related substances are in accordance with the ICH Q3A guideline and 
appropriate specifications have been set. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used 
for assay and identity testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data from 11 commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The 
results are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017

Stability 
Stability data on three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer 
stored in a container closure system representative of that intended for the market under long term 
conditions at 25 ºC / 60% RH and under accelerated conditions at 40 ºC / 75% RH according to the 
ICH guidelines were provided. 
All stability indicating parameters were tested. The analytical methods used were the same as for 
release. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. No significant changes or trends were observed in 
any of the parameters tested through storage compared to the initial values. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. The study 
confirmed that the active substance is not sensitive to light. 
Results under stressed conditions including acidic and alkaline media and heat were provided and it 
was shown that the methods of analysis used are appropriate to detect the degradation of the active 
substance, i.e. they are stability indicating. The degradation pathways of the active substance are 
described and well understood. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is presented as immediate release white hard-gelatine capsules (size 2), each 
containing 100 mg of pentosan polysulfate sodium. 
The aim of pharmaceutical development was to develop a product which is essentially similar to the US 
product Elmiron, described in scientific literature. 
As mentioned above, pentosan polysulfate sodium is a BCS Class III substance exhibiting very high 
solubility in aqueous media across the physiological pH range and low permeability. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.2.1 of this report. The compatibility of the 
active substance and excipients has been demonstrated. 
No clinical studies have been submitted. In support of the BCS-based biowaiver approach, the finished 
product has been compared to the product described in scientific literature by in vitro dissolution 
according to Appendix III of the “Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence” 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1). Comparative dissolution profiles in three different media have been 
provided and the products are considered similar. The developed dissolution method is in line with Ph. 
Eur. requirements. 
The manufacturing process development is based on blending a powder mixture followed by filling into 
hard gelatine capsules. The manufacturing process is well known and standard. 
The primary packaging is either PVC/Aclar/Aluminium blisters or an HDPE container with child-
resistant, tamper-evident PP screw caps. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 21/115 
 
 
 
 
 
The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the 
intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: preparation of powder blend, encapsulation 
and packaging. Conventional pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment is used. The process is 
considered to be a standard manufacturing process.  
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated  on  3  consecutive  commercial  scale 
batches by a number of studies. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable 
of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls 
are adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The  finished  product  release  specifications  include  appropriate  tests  for  this  kind  of  dosage  form  and 
include  tests  for  appearance  (visual),  identification  (IR  and  a  chromatographic  method),  colour 
identification  for  titanium  dioxide  (colour  reaction),  average  filling  weight  (Ph.  Eur.),  filling  weight 
deviation  (Ph.  Eur.),  uniformity  of  dosage  units  (Ph.  Eur.),  dissolution  (Ph.  Eur.),  loss  on  drying  (Ph. 
Eur.),  microbiological  quality 
(Ph. Eur.),

The finished product is released on the market through traditional final product release testing. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions at 
25 ºC / 60% RH, under intermediate conditions at 30 ºC / 75% RH, and under accelerated conditions 
at  40  ºC  /  75%  RH  according  to  the  ICH  guidelines  were  provided.  The  batches  of  the  medicinal 
product  are  identical  to  those  proposed  for  marketing  and  were  packed  in  the  primary  packaging 
proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, identification, dissolution, loss on drying, microbiological quality, 
impurities and assay. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
At 25 °C / 60% RH and 30 °C / 75% RH, all results remained within the proposed specification limits. 
At  40  °C  /  75%  RH  after  6  months  storage,  results  were  observed  for  batches  packaged  in  blisters, 
which indicate that the blisters should not be stored above 30°C. 
In addition, bulk capsules, capsules packed in bottles and capsules packed in blisters were exposed to 
light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug  Substances and Products. 
No out of specification results were observed for any of the tested parameters, demonstrating that the 
finished product is photostable.

Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
No pharmacology studies have been submitted and the Applicant presented literature data. Likewise, 
pharmacokinetic data are based on 3 main articles dated from 1984 to 2005.  
The pharmacological profile of elmiron in the treatment of IC (BPS 2X-3C) is unknown. It is 
hypothesized, that a potential barrier function of PPS instead of the damaged urothelial mucus might 
play a role as well the anti-inflammatory activity of PPS. This activity is considered as the likely 
mechanism of action for the proposed indication. 
PPS shows some similarities in its chemical structure as well as in its mechanism(s) of action with 
unfractionated heparin (UFH), characterized as a sulfated glycosaminoglycan with a mean molecular 
weight (MW) of about 15-20 kDa (range 2-40 kDa), as well as with low molecular weight heparin 
derivatives (LMWHs) which are produced by partial depolymerization of UFH exhibiting an average MW 
of 3-7 kDa. Like heparin, PPS is a mixture of macromolecules but with a higher degree of sulfation and, 
thus, a higher charge density than UFH. The mean MW of Na-PPS of about 4.7 kDa (80% of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 23/115 
 
 
 
 
 
molecules have a MW between 1.8 and 9.0 kDa) is similar to commercially available LMWHs. However, 
there are important differences in the structure between PPS, UFH and LMWH resulting in different 
pharmacodynamic properties. 
Parsons showed that PPS resembles the glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) produced by cells in the body, 
including those lining the bladder (Parsons 1994). Sadhukhan showed a cytoprotective effects resulting 
in a reduction in the inflammation of the bladder mucosa (Sadhukhan et al. 2002). Chiang et al. 
demonstrated that PPS appears to inhibit in a dose-dependent manner the stimulation of connective 
tissue mast cells and mucosal mast cells (Chiang et al. 2000, Chiang et al. 2003) and activated bladder 
mast cells are reported in patients with IC (Sant et al. 2007). 
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In Primary Pharmacology part of the dossier, the Applicant presented data from six sources that used 
studies in vitro and in vivo (with rats and rabbits). In vitro studies by Chiang et al. (Chiang et al. 2000) 
used peritoneal mast cells isolated from male Sprague Dawley rats demonstrate that PPS may also 
have an additional or alternate action on bladder mast cells. He demonstrated that PPS has a dose 
dependent inhibitory effect on mast cell release of histamine induced by the mast cell secretagogue 
compound 48/80. 
The ability of protamine sulfate, an inactivator of the GAG layer (Parsons et al. 1980), to alter 
membrane permeability to the urinary solute urea, to ionic calcium and to water was examined 
together with the ability of exogenous PPS to reverse these changes was investigated by Parsons et al. 
(Parsons et al. 1990). Study supports the hypothesis, that surface polysaccharide play an important 
role as a bladder permeability barrier in modulating small molecule movement in that its ability to 
impair such movement can be inhibited by protamine and this protamine effect can be reversed by a 
treatment with PPS. 
Sadhukhan et al. (Sadhukhan et al. 2002) investigated the urothelial cytoprotective action of PPS for 
treating interstitial cystitis by measuring the activity of the nuclear transcription factor nuclear κB-
factor, which is thought to have a role in mediating the urothelial inflammatory response of interstitial 
cystitis. Authors concluded that PPS might have a nonspecific effect against the viral (dsRNA) and 
bacterial (LPS) activation of nuclear κB -factor and the observed clinical effect of PPS may be mediated 
by nonspecific binding of PPS molecules and the inflammatory stimulants of urothelial activation. These 
findings suggest a mechanism of action for PPS that occurs in the urine rather than at the mucosal 
membrane by direct interaction of the drug with potential interstitial cystitis inducing inflammatory 
agents.  
Kalota et al. (Kalota et al. 1992) demonstrated that PPS can reduce the damage done by the cytotoxic 
substance acrolein in transitional cells in the bladder of female rats, which suggests an enhancement of 
GAG layer properties by PPS. The ability of PPS to reduce toxic effects of acrolein, the active metabolite 
of cyclophosphamide, and the ability of PPS to improve the bladder’s GAG functional layer properties; 
were highlighted. 
Nickel et al. (Nickel et al. 1998) investigated the relative efficacy of heparin, PPS and hyaluronic acid in 
preventing the absorption of 14C labeled urea in protamine-pre-treated bladders compared with saline-
pre-treated control bladders. The results demonstrate that exogenous GAG's are effective in providing 
an epithelial permeability barrier in protamine-pre-treated bladders.

Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
In the PD Secondary pharmacology section the Applicant overview the historical development of the 
PPS activity upon blood coagulation, fibrinolysis and lipid metabolism. Barrowcliffe et al. (1986) 
demonstrated after subcutaneous injection of 50mg PPS in humans an enhanced anti·Xa clotting 
activity and inhibition of the lipid peroxide induced thrombin generation. An increase in plasminogen 
activator levels after PPS due to the release of endothelial t-PA into the bloodstream was described by 
Gaffney et al. 1986. 
Marsh et al. 1986 reproduced the results in men by evaluating the thrombolytic effect of s.c., i.m. or 
i.v. injection of 2 - 10 mg/kg PPS in experimental rats. The thrombolytic effect on freshly formed 
thrombi was demonstrated in the inferior vena cava thrombosis model; the effect was more 
pronounced in animals allowed to survive for 24 or 48 h. 
The anticoagulant and fibrinolytic properties are characteristic of PPS, although its anticoagulant 
activity is clearly less than that of heparin (Soria et al. 1980, Fischer et al. 1982). The anticoagulant 
effectiveness of PPS was demonstrated both in vitro and in vivo. The anticoagulant action of PPS is 
much lower than that of unfractionated heparin which clearly prolonged aPTT, TT and PT as well as 
inhibited thrombin and FXa activities to nearly the same degree. 
The antithrombotic effectiveness of PPS was demonstrated in various experimental thrombosis models 
in animals. PPS especially prevented the formation of venous thrombi when these were induced by 
activation of the plasmatic coagulation system due to endothelial damage or injection of activated 
clotting factors in combination with partial or complete interruption of blood flow. PPS was also 
effective in arterial thrombosis when thrombus formation was induced by administration of activated 
clotting factors and stasis, but it was almost ineffective in models of arterial thrombosis when these 
were mainly based on vessel lesions and activation of platelets. PPS was found to stimulate fibrinolysis 
in vivo in various species due to the release of t-PA from endothelial cells.  
Ofosu et al. 1986 concluded from in in-vitro experiments that PPS appear to directly inhibit 
prothrombin activation via several mechanisms (catalysing the inhibition of the initial trace amounts of 
thrombin formed by heparin cofactor II, direct inhibition of prothrombin activation by the inhibition of 
the formation of the prothrombinase complex, or inhibition of the expression of the catalytic activity of 
the prothrombinase complex). 
Scully et al. 1986 evaluated the relative potency of PPS for the activation of HC II/thrombin or 
AT/thrombin interaction in comparison to heparin and dermatan sulfate and to differentiate between 
high, average and low molecular weight fractions of PPS. Results indicate a coagulation control by PPS 
principally through inhibition of thrombin mainly (> 80 %) due to HC II.  
The effect of PPS on platelet functions is not yet clear. PPS did not affect ADP-induced aggregation and 
showed only a minor inhibitory activity on collagen- as well as ristocetin induced aggregation but it 
inhibited the adhesion of platelets to collagen in a concentration dependent manner. The results of the 
action of PPS on thrombin-induced aggregation are controversial. 
PPS aggregated platelets in normal platelet-rich plasma when the aggregation was induced with the 
serum from patients with documented heparin-induced thrombocytopenia indicating that PPS may 
provoke immune thrombocytopenia in man. 
The anticoagulant efficacy of PPS in vivo (Giedrojc et al. 1999, Barrowcliffe et al. 1988, Doctor et al. 
1991, Ofosu et al. 1988) was studied in ex vivo samples after s.c., i.v. and i.m. administration into 
various species such as rats, rabbits and humans. Ex vivo the same inhibitory effects of PPS especially 
on thrombin and FXa generation can be observed as that seen in vitro, the effects are maintained in

AT-deficient plasma. Significant anticoagulant effects in rats can be observed at parenteral doses of 10 
mg/kg and higher, in humans a strong anticoagulant action of PPS is measured in the aPTT assay after 
s.c. or i.v. administration of doses between 50 and 100 mg. To evaluate the anticoagulant activity of 
PPS in vivo after different routes of administration the aPTT assay should be used; because of their low 
sensitivity to PPS TT and PT assays are not suitable and will indicate only a moderate anticoagulant 
activity of the drug. Comparative studies with PPS and UFH revealed that the overall anticoagulant 
efficacy of PPS both in vitro and in vivo after parenteral administration is lower than that of UFH. 
The comparative measurement of in vitro anticoagulant activities of PPS and UFH demonstrated the 
strong anticoagulant action of heparin and the relatively low effect of PPS what the Applicant 
summarises in Table 1. Heparin clearly prolonged aPTT, TT and PT as well as inhibited thrombin and F 
Xa activities to nearly the same degree. A direct comparison of the anticoagulant effectiveness 
between PPS and UFH in vitro in rats and humans demonstrated an about 10 times stronger action of 
UFH on the aPTT. Equieffective concentrations of PPS for the prolongation of TT were about 20-40 
times higher than that for UFH. PT was least sensitive to both PPS and UFH; equieffective 
concentrations were about 12 times higher for PPS than for UFH.

After oral administration of 400 mg PPS (Fellström et al. 1987) or about 700 mg PPS (Marshall et al. 
1997), maximum plasma concentrations in the range of 20-70 ng/ml were observed for unchanged 
PPS. When total PPS-related radioactivity was assessed after oral administration of 300 mg PPS, Cmax 
was 250 ng equivalents/ml. Therefore, even at these doses, which are much higher than the intended 
clinical dose, the concentrations of unchanged PPS obtained in plasma were about 1000x lower than 
those associated with anticoagulant effects. Even if all metabolites of PPS are taken into account, there 
is still a safety factor of approximately 100. 
Messmore et al. 1989 evaluated the effect of heparin on platelet functions in normal human plasma 
and correlated this interaction to both the chemical properties such as molecular weight, degree of 
sulfation, and the inhibitory activity against FXa, thrombin or both.

While heparin markedly suppressed thrombin and collagen aggregation and LMWHs suppressed 
thrombin-induced aggregation to a modest degree in parallel to their antithrombinactivity, PPS showed 
no significant inhibition. The collagen-induced aggregation was inhibited by heparin but at only minor 
degrees by PPS. At very high heparin concentrations (100 units or 600 μg/ml) ADP-induced 
aggregation was inhibited, PPS and other heparinoids at the same concentrations did not inhibit 
aggregation by ADP. Ristocetin-induced aggregation was inhibited by heparin and only slightly at high 
concentrations by LMWHs and PPS. When the aggregation in normal platelet-rich plasma was induced 
with the serum of patients with heparin-induced thrombocytopenia in the presence of the different 
compounds studied, besides heparin and LMWHs also PPS at low concentrations of 6 μg/ml showed a 
positive aggregation effect, whereas at a high concentration of 600 μg/ml the effect became negative. 
Platelet adhesion to collagen was clearly inhibited by heparin, while PPS was less effective. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
No safety pharmacology studies with PPS are reported in scientific literature. The available non-clinical 
and clinical data do not provide any indication of adverse pharmacodynamics effects of PPS on the 
central nervous system, cardiovascular system or respiratory system. 
Since medicinal products based on PPS have been marketed in the USA and in Europe the lack of non-
clinical literature in this field is acceptable as superseded by clinical data. 
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No information on preclinical drug interaction studies conducted with PPS was found in scientific 
literature.  
Since medicinal products based on PPS have been marketed in the USA and in Europe the lack of non-
clinical literature in this field is acceptable as superseded by clinical data. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Several  studies  have  been  conducted  to  evaluate  the  pharmacokinetics  of  PPS  in  humans  in  healthy 
volunteers (Fellström et al. 1986, Faaij et al. 1999, Simon et al. 2005, Danielson et al. 1991). Cadroy 
et  al.  (Cadroy  et  al.  1987)  determined  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters of  PPS  in  the  rabbit  from  the 
time  course  of  the  plasma  TRA  concentrations  after  intravenous  injection  of  125I-Na-PPS.  5  µCi  of 
125I-Na-PPS as a marker was injected simultaneously with increasing doses (~ 6 – 12,600 µg/kg) of 
unlabelled  Na-PPS  to  groups  of  2  –  3  animals.  The  disappearance  of  the  TRA  from  the  plasma  of 
rabbits was triphasic. The half-lives t1/2α (1.8 – 6.8 min) and t1/2γ (3.1 – 5.2 h) as well as the total 
volume of distribution Vd (180 – 372 ml) were independent of the dose administered. However, there 
was  a  highly  significant  correlation  between  the  dose  and  the  clearance  (r  =  0.91),  and  between  the 
dose  and  the  half-life  t1/2,β  (r  =  0.81).  The  results  show  that  the  TRA  clearance  (Cltot)  is  reduced 
(from 17.4 to 4.8 ml/min) and the half-life t1/2β is prolonged (from 15.1 to 41.5 min) with increasing 
doses. Over the dose range investigated, the clearance varied by a factor of three in the rabbits. 
Distribution of radioactivity appeared to be in the whole body after I.V administration in rats with the 
highest detected radioactivity observed in the urinary tract. Odlind et al. have reported that there were 
no qualitative differences (only quantitative differences) in distribution in the urinary tract after oral or 
I.V  administration.  Dencker  and  Odlind  (Dencker  et  al.  1985,  Odlind  et  al.  1987)  studied  the  tissue 
distribution  after  administration  of  3H-Na-PPS  in  rats.  3H-Na-PPS  was  administered  orally  and

intravenously  (5  mg/kg)  in  Sprague-Dawley  rats.  Detection  of  radioactivity  in  the  upper  intestine 
suggested some hepatic excretion. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Single dose toxicity 
No single dose toxicity studies with PPS are reported in scientific literature which was considered 
acceptable by the CHMP. The available non-clinical and clinical data do not provide indication of acute 
toxicity of PPS. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
In 2-week repeat-dose toxicity studies (no GLP compliance) in mice and rats PPS concentrations of 0, 
33, 111, 333, 1000 and 3000 mg/kg were applied via oral gavage once daily for 5 days per week for 
up to 2 consecutive weeks (National Toxicology Program  (NTP) 2004, Nyska et al. 2002). No drug-
related mortality was observed. In clinical observations and necropsy: no abnormalities were detected. 
Some changes were observed in the organ weights. Based on these findings the no observed adverse 
effect level (NOAEL) was determined: 333 mg/kg body weight for mice males and 1000 mg/kg body 
weight for females. The NOAEL in 2-week toxicity studies in rats was considered to be 333 mg/kg body 
weight. 
13-week gavage toxicity studies with PPS were conducted in rats and mice. Concentrations of 0, 63, 
125, 250, 500 and 1000 mg/kg were applied via oral gavage once daily for 5 days per week for up to 
13 consecutive weeks. No drug-related mortality was observed. In these studies were observed 
increase of body weight in male rats treated with 500 mg/kg. There was also observed an increase in: 
a) liver weight (in male rats treated with 250 mg/kg or 1000 mg/kg and 500 mg/kg, female rats 
treated with all dose groups (63–1000 mg/kg), male mice treated with 500 mg/kg, female mice 
treated with 250 or 1000 mg/kg or 500 mg/kg); b) kidney weight (female rats treated with 1000 
mg/kg); c) spleen weight (male rats treated with 125 mg/kg to 1000 mg/kg and 63 mg/kg (absolute), 
female rats treated with 1000 mg/kg , male mice treated with 1000 mg/kg (absolute and relative) or 
125 mg/kg (absolute), female mice treated with 1000 mg/kg); d) lung weight (female rats treated 
with 1000 mg/kg (absolute and relative) or 125 mg/kg (absolute), female mice treated with 125 or 
1000 mg/kg). The observed organ weight increases were associated with the following 
histopathological observations: 
Liver: In both species, hepatocytic vacuolisation was observed in both sexes in the highest dose group 
and in males in the 500 mg/kg dose group. The characteristic of the vacuolisation was mainly 
indicative of fat. Inflammation was also observed in male rats treated with 500 and 1000 mg/kg and in 
nearly all dose groups of mice. 
Kidney: In rats, tubular epithelial vacuolisation was observed in both species treated with 1000 mg/kg. 
Spleen: In mice histiocytic infiltration was observed in female mice treated with 500 or 1000 mg/kg 
and in male mice treated with 1000 mg/kg. 
Lung: In rats, alveolar histiocytic infiltration was observed in all dose-groups treated with PPS and 
appeared more severe in the higher dose-groups. Chronic interstitial inflammation occurred in both 
sexes treated with 500 or 1000 mg/kg and also in females treated with 250 mg/kg. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 28/115 
 
 
 
 
 
Rectum: In both species, treatment-related changes consisted of histiocytic infiltration, chronic active 
inflammation, and chronic ulcers. All observations started with the application of 125 mg/kg to male 
rats. In female rats, histiocytic infiltration started with the low dose of 63 mg/kg while ulcers and 
infiltration started with the application of 500 mg/kg only. In male mice, histiocyte infiltration started 
with 250 mg/kg and ulcer and inflammation started with the highest dose. In female mice, histiocyte 
infiltration and inflammation started with doses of 500 mg/kg while no ulcers were seen in female 
mice. 
Overall, lesions consisted mainly of infiltration into multiple tissues of vacuolated histiocytes, which, by 
histochemical investigation, indicated the presence of neutral and acidic mucins and lipidic material 
within the vacuoles. Transmission electron microscopy identified these vacuoles as lysosomal 
structures that exhibited a variety of contents. On the basis of these findings, it was concluded, that 
PPS was absorbed through the focally disrupted rectal mucosa, was deposited in the lamina propria, 
accumulated within macrophages, and then was distributed by these cells or as a free chemical via the 
lymphatics and blood, to the various organ sites manifesting histiocytic infiltration. The cytoplasmic 
membrane bound structures within macrophages were lysosomes containing membranous material of 
cellular origin and, perhaps, remnants of the deposited test material. 
Haematological analysis indicated increases for both species in the white blood cells and lymphocyte 
counts in those animals treated with higher doses of PPS. In both species WBC and lymphocytes were 
significantly increased in animals treated with 1000 mg/kg. 
According results of the studies the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be: 
250 (males) - 500 (females) mg PPS / kg body weight for mice and 125 (males) ‒ 250 (females) mg 
PPS/kg body weight for rates.

Genotoxicity studies with PPS. In this NTP Report, genetic toxicity studies were evaluated which 
derived from an earlier effort by the NTP to develop a comprehensive database permitting a critical 
anticipation of a chemical’s carcinogenicity in experimental animals. The genetic toxicity studies with 
PPS comprise the following tests (NTP Report): 1. Salmonella Typhimurium Mutagenicity Test (Ames . 
Test) was performed as reported by Zeiger et al., 1987. 2. Rat and Mouse Bone Marrow Micronucleus 
Test. The standard three-exposure protocol is described in detail by Shelby et al., 1993. 3. Mouse 
Peripheral Blood Micronucleus Test. A detailed discussion of this assay is presented by MacGregor et 
al., 1990. Thus it is concluded that the studies were performed according to international guidelines 
existing at that time. From the scientific point of view, the results are valid and reproducible and allow 
a reliable characterisation of the genotoxic potential of the test substance. In line with the evaluation 
of the NTP Report it is concluded that data derived from the Ames test are valid. 
With respect to the question whether the absence of findings in the NTP micronucleus studies could be 
related to the fact that PPS is poorly absorbed, it can be demonstrated that the animals were 
maximally exposed to the test substance, because the doses administered were selected on the basis 
of 13-week maximum tolerated dosage (MTD) studies, in which doses up to 1,000 mg/kg bw were 
administered. At dose levels of 250 mg/kg and above (rat) and at 1,000 mg/kg (mouse), animals of 
the 13 week studies developed rectal lesions consisting of chronic ulcers and/or chronic inflammation. 
In addition to the outcome of the MTD study, which indicates that PPS is absorbed after oral 
administration, Abdo et al., 2003 demonstrate that tritiated PPS upon oral administration to Sprague-
Dawley rats is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and becomes distributed throughout the body 
(Dencker et al., 1985; Odlind et al., 1987). 
Thus, although no toxicokinetic investigations were performed in parallel to the genotoxicity (and 
carcinogenicity) NTP studies, it can be concluded that the animals were exposed to the test compound. 
In agreement with the final conclusion drawn in the NTP-Report, the results of the mutagenicity tests 
can be summarized as follows: PPS was not mutagenic in S. typhimurium strains TA97, TA98, TA100, 
or TA1535 with or without induced hamster or rat liver S9 enzymes. No increases in the frequency of 
micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes were seen in bone marrow cells of rats or mice 
administered PPS by gavage three times at 24-hour intervals. No significant alterations in the 
frequency of micronucleated normochromatic erythrocytes were seen in peripheral blood samples from 
male or female mice administered PPS for 3 months by gavage.

NTP conclusions of these 2-year carcinogenicity studies were the following: “Under the conditions of 
these 2-year gavage studies, there was no evidence of carcinogenic activity* of Elmiron in male 
F344/N rats administered 14, 42, or 126 mg/kg or in female F344/N rats administered 28, 84, or 252 
mg/kg. There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of Elmiron in male B6C3F1 mice based on 
increased incidences of liver hemangiosarcoma. The increased incidences of hepatocellular neoplasms 
in male mice may have been related to Elmiron administration. 
There was some evidence of carcinogenic activity of Elmiron in female B6C3F1 mice based on the 
increased incidences of liver hemangiosarcoma and hepatocellular neoplasms. The increased incidences 
of malignant lymphomas in female mice may have been related to Elmiron administration. 
Elmiron administration caused increased incidences of non-neoplastic lesions (presence of vacuolated 
histiocytes) of the rectum, lung, mesenteric lymph node, and spleen (males) in rats and of the liver, 
rectum, mesenteric lymph node, and spleen in mice. 
Reproduction Toxicity 
PPS does not cross the placental barrier in humans. This is demonstrated in investigations of Forestier 
et al., 1986 (PPS); Rainaut et al., 1987 (PPS, low molecular heparins (LMWHs); Forestier et al., 1987 
(LMWH); Omri et al., 1989 (LMWH); Deruelle and Coulon, 2007 (LMWHs). 
In a retrospective study 111 pregnancies under treatment with LMWHs were evaluated by Deruelle et 
al., 2006; all patients began treatment before the 15th week of pregnancy. The authors conclude that 
the use of LMWHs for patients requiring anticoagulant treatment from the first trimester appears safe 
for mother and foetus. 
Corresponding results were obtained in experimental animal studies. Andrew et al., 1985 conclude that 
standard heparin and a LMWH do not cross the placenta in the pregnant sheep. Doutremepuich et al., 
1985 compare the passage of commercial heparin and a low molecular weight fragment of heparin 
across the placenta of rabbits. The authors show that the low molecular weight heparin fraction does 
not cross the placenta at the dose of 1 000 anti-Xa units/kg. For higher doses (8 000 and 16 000 anti-
Xa units/kg) this heparin fraction gives a fetal heparin blood level above that after administration of 
commercial heparin. 
The potential reproductive toxicity of PPS was assessed in Sprague-Dawley rats (NTP, 1997).F0 female 
and male body weights were unchanged. Body weights of the F1 high dose group males and females 
were significantly decreased. Feed consumption values were unchanged. In this reproductive toxicity

study, PPS did not affect reproductive performance. Breeding parameters, fertility, or necropsy 
endpoints related to reproduction were not altered by the test substance. No differences were noted in 
epididymal sperm morphology, epididymal sperm density, sperm motility, testicular spermatid counts, 
or estrous cyclicity. 
In the Appendix H of the NTP Technical Report 512 (2004), findings concerning the reproductive tissue 
and the estrous cycle characterization of rats and mice used in the 3-month gavage studies are 
summarized. Neither tissue weights (cauda epididymis, epididymis, testis), nor spermatid 
measurements/spermatid counts and spermatozoal motility nor evaluation of estrous cycle length 
(days) and estrus stages (diestrus, proestrus, estrus, metestrus) revealed statistically dose dependent 
differences related to the administration of the test substance. 
Data from other repeated dose toxicity studies were evaluated concerning findings which could give 
any indication for potential effects on male or female fertility. In none of the subchronic or chronic 
studies in rats and mice an influence on weight development, morphology or functionality of male or 
female sexual organs could be observed. 
Published reproduction toxicity studies are rare. In reproduction toxicity studies in rats which were 
treated with doses up to 1,000 mg PPS/kg there were no effects on reproductive, breeding, or fertility 
parameters. Spermatological investigation or evaluation of the oestrus cycles did not reveal any effects 
of the test compound. Data from other toxicity studies (weights or histologic findings of reproductive 
organs in males or females) did not give any indication for potential effects on male or female 
reproduction. 
Toxicokinetic data 
No toxicokinetic data were not submitted this was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Local Tolerance  
No specific non-clinical local tolerance studies were submitted. This was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
Other toxicity studies 
A 28-day repeat dose study to evaluate the potential immunotoxicity of PPS was conducted by NTP 
(Thakur et al. 2014). Eight female B6C3F1/N mice each were orally administered with PPS at doses of 
63, 125, 250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg. For the B16F10 host resistance study, doses administered were 0, 
250, 500 or 1000 mg/kg. Each treatment group consisted of 12 animals. The doses, vehicle, and the 
route of exposure were selected based on the dose levels of the 3-month NTP toxicity studies and to 
minimize the potential for overt toxicity that could confound immunologic evaluation. 
No signs of overt toxicity were observed in the PPS-treated animals. No significant treatment-related 
effects were observed in mice with respect to body weights except a significant increase (40%) in body 
weight gain in the 250 mg/kg dose group. The absolute liver weights were increased at the 500 and 
1000 mg/kg doses (13% and 23%, respectively) and the relative liver weight was increased at 1000 
mg/kg (17%). Treatment-related effects on absolute or relative weights of thymus, spleen, lung or 
kidney were not observed. PPS treatment resulted in statistically significant increases in the 
percentage of reticulocytes in the peripheral blood in the 125, 500, and 1000 mg/kg treatment groups 
(23%, 19% and 29%, respectively). 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 33/115 
 
 
 
 
 
Erythrocyte numbers, differential leukocyte counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, and platelet 
concentration were not affected. 
Mice treated with PPS had a significant increase in absolute numbers of splenic macrophages (63, 500 
and 1000 mg/kg) and natural killer (NK) cells (250 and 1000 mg/kg). PPS treatment did not affect the 
humoral immune response or T cell proliferative response. However, innate immune responses such as 
phagocytosis by liver macrophages (1000 mg/ kg) and NK cell activity were enhanced (500 and 1000 
mg/kg). Further analysis using a disease resistance model showed that PPS-treated mice 
demonstrated significantly increased anti-tumor activity against B16F10 melanoma cells at the 500 and 
1000 mg/kg doses. 
The authors conclude, that the current study demonstrated that 28-day PPS treatment enhances the 
innate immune responses in healthy female B6C3F1/N mice by specifically increasing macrophage and 
NK cell number, NK cell activity and macrophage phagocytosis. 
Consistent with their reported function in host defense, the increases in NK cell and macrophage 
activity appeared to increase resistance to B16F10 tumor development in mice. 
Furthermore, the identified immune potentiating properties of PPS indicates that long term PPS 
treatment should be used with caution in patients with genetic disposition to development of 
inflammatory disorders such as autoimmune diseases due to potential exacerbation of innate immune 
responses.

An assessment of the ecotoxicity/environmental risk has been conducted by the Applicant. The PECsw 
was calculated considering the recommended daily dose of 300 mg/day, a Fpen value of 0.0002 which 
corresponds to the prevalence of interstitial cystitis supporting the Orphan designation of elmiron, and 
default WASTEWinhab and DILUTION values. The phase I Fpen exceeds the 0.01 µg/L threshold by a 
3-fold  factor.  However,  additional  studies  (phase  II)  are  not  considered  as  necessary  since  pentosan 
polysulfate sodium is a carbohydrate derivative which is viewed as unlikely to result in a significant risk 
to 
the  environment.  Although  calculated  Log  Kow  values  are  generally  not  acceptable 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010), requesting an experimental determination of Log Kow is not viewed as 
necessary for the same reason in general. In addition, available data suggest that the Log Kow value 
of pentosan polysulfate would unlikely reach a value of concern.

Overall, PPS is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.1.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Demonstration of pharmacological activity of PPS in the treatment of IC (BPS 2X-3C) relies on a review 
of  the  literature.  Although  the  mechanism  of  action  remains  unknown,  PPS  has  shown  to  be  able  to 
bind  to  bladder  epithelium;  restore  epithelial  barrier  integrity  in  bladders  with  permeability  disorders 
and has anti-inflammatory properties. Moreover, PPS is a low molecular-weight heparin like compound 
with anticoagulant and fibrinolytic effects. Overall, non-clinical pharmacokinetic data is sparse which is 
acceptable and evaluation relies on literature and clinical experience.  
After  I.V.  administration  of  radiolabelled  PPS  in  rabbits  clearance  of  PPS  decreased  with  the  dose-
increase and this was correlated with a half-life increase. Distribution of radioactivity appeared to be in 
the whole body after I.V administration in rats with the highest detected radioactivity observed in the 
urinary tract. Odlind et al. have reported that there were no qualitative differences (only quantitative 
differences) in distribution in the urinary tract after oral or I.V. administration.  
Bioavailability  of  PPS  is  weak  and  absorbed  fraction  is  metabolized  in  the  liver  and  spleen. 
Transformation  of  PPS  relies  on  desulfation  process  occurring  in  the  liver  and  the  spleen  and 
depolymerisation in the kidney.  
As reported by Fellström et al., less than 0.1% of PPS is recovered unchanged in the urine after oral 
administration in Human, fraction found in the urine are mainly metabolites. PPS is mostly excreted in 
the faeces (54-84%) as unchanged drug. Overall, pharmacokinetic data regarding the non-clinical field 
are seldom and assessment should rely on clinical experience. 
According to the Applicant, LMWHs and certain heparinoids may be less likely to cause bleeding 
because they do not interfere with collagen-mediated aggregation and adhesion to a significant degree. 
However, PPS did show slight inhibitory activity against collagen aggregation and adhesion and it also 
interacts with the antibody induced by heparin therapy. In accordance with the abovementioned a 
warning statement on the anticoagulant effects of elmiron was included in Section 4.4 of the SmPC 
which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The  toxicological  program  presented  by  the  Applicant  relies  on  literature  review  including  studies 
conducted by the NTP on Elmiron. No dedicated acute toxicity study with PPS has been reported in the 
literature  but  repeated-dose  toxicity  studies  in  rodents  have  highlighted  toxicity  localized  in  lymph 
nodes (mesenteric and mandibular), liver, lung (only rats), rectum and spleen (only mice).  
Elmiron-related  increases in  organ  weight-were  observed:  lung  (rats),  liver,  kidney (female  rats)  and 
spleen  (male  mice);  this  in  correlation  with  macrophage  infiltration,  vacuolization  observed  in  these 
organs. Ulceration and inflammation localized at the rectum level, is the result of high exposure of this 
tissue to the drug due to poor absorption after oral administration. 
According results of the studies the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) was considered to be: 
250 (males) - 500 (females) mg PPS / kg body weight for mice and 125 (males) ‒ 250 (females) mg 
PPS/kg body weight for rates.  
Regarding  the  2-year  carcinogenicity  studies,  mice  are  more  sensitive  towards  Elmiron  treatment. 
Increase  incidence  of  neoplastic  lesions,  with  statistical  significance,  were  observed  in  the  liver, 
malignant lymphoma in the spleen, of B6CF3F1 mouse. Under the conditions of these 2-year studies, 
PPS was carcinogenic to mice but not to rats.  
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 35/115 
 
 
 
 
 
In  the  rat  carcinogenicity  study,  there  was  no  substance  related  increase  in  the  incidence  of 
neoplasms.  In  the  mouse  study,  increased  incidences  of  liver  hemangiosarcoma  were  related  to  the 
administration  of  the  test  material  (medium  and  high  dose  groups  males,  high  dose  group  females). 
Additionally,  the  incidence  of  liver  adenoma  was  increased  (high  dose  group  females).  The  dosages 
tested  were  up  to  60 times  the  maximum  recommended  human  dose  (MRHD)  in  rats,  and  up to  117 
times the MRHD in mice, on a mg/kg basis.  
Due  to  the  relevance  of  the  neoplastic  findings  from  the  mouse  long  term  study  genotoxicity  studies 
have been performed by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) to develop a comprehensive database 
permitting a critical anticipation of a chemical`s carcinogenicity and are reported in the NTP Technical 
Report  on  the  Toxicology  and  Carcinogenesis  studies  of  Elmiron.  Results  obtained  from  in  vivo 
genotoxic studies are considered sufficient by the CHMP to demonstrate that PPS is not susceptible of 
genotoxic  damage.  Results  indicate  no  mutagenic  effect  in  the  Ames  Test  (in  accordance  with  the 
OECD  guideline  number  471)  and  no  consistent  increase  in  the  frequency  of  micro-nucleated 
polychromatic  erythrocytes  revealing  a  mutagenic  potential  was  induced  by  PPS.  Thus,  it  can  be 
concluded that the findings in the mouse study are  not associated with a genotoxic potential and are 
not applicable to the circumstances in clinical therapy. 
Evaluation  of  PPS  impact  over  the  immune  system  was  tested  in  28-day  repeat  dose  study  and  was 
conducted by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) (Thakur et al. 2014). The doses, vehicle, and the 
route of exposure were selected based on the dose levels of the 3-month NTP toxicity studies and to 
minimize  the  potential  for  overt  toxicity  that  could  confound  immunologic  evaluation.  Treatment-
related  effects  on  absolute  or  relative  weights  of  thymus,  spleen,  lung  or  kidney  were  not  observed. 
PPS  treatment  resulted  in  statistically  significant  increases  in  the  percentage  of  reticulocytes  in  the 
peripheral  blood.  Mice  treated  with  PPS  had  a  significant  increase  in  absolute  numbers  of  splenic 
macrophages  (63,  500  and  1000  mg/kg)  and  natural  killer  (NK)  cells  (250  and  1000  mg/kg).  PPS 
treatment  did  not  affect  the  humoral  immune  response  or  T  cell  proliferative  response.  However, 
innate  immune  responses  such  as  phagocytosis  by  liver  macrophages  (1000  mg/  kg)  and  NK  cell 
activity were enhanced (500 and 1000 mg/kg). PPS treatment enhances the innate immune responses 
in  healthy  female  B6C3F1/N  mice  by  specifically  increasing  macrophage  and  NK  cell  number,  NK  cell 
activity and macrophage phagocytosis.  
No  embryofetal  toxicity  studies  are  published  for  PPS,  but  indirect  evidence  of  the  lack  of 
transplacental passage of PPS was generated via a clinical study published by Forestier (Forestier et al. 
1986). Reproduction studies have been performed in mice and rats with intravenous daily doses of 15 
mg/kg,  and  in  rabbits  with  7.5  mg/kg.  These  doses  are  0.42  and  0.14  times  the  daily  oral  human 
doses  of  Elmiron  when  normalized  to  body  surface  area.  These  studies  did  not  reveal  evidence  of 
impaired fertility or harm to the foetus from Elmiron. Direct in vitro bathing of cultured mouse embryos 
with pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS) at a concentration of 1 mg/mL may cause reversible limb bud 
abnormalities. Adequate and well-controlled studies have not been performed in pregnant women. The 
applicant  has  stated  in  the  proposed  SmPC  that  it  is  preferable  to  avoid  the  use  of  PPS  during 
pregnancy and should not be used during breast-feeding which is acceptable. 
2.3.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant submitted an application for a well-established use product, and as such submitted no 
new non-clinical data. The scientific literature review of the non-clinical data on pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology of pentosan polysulfate sodium is considered appropriate to support 
the proposed clinical use for the treatment of Interstitial Cystitis/ bladder pain syndrome characterized 
by either glomerulations or Hunner’s lesions in adults.

2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
According  to  Article  10a  of  Directive  2001/83/EC,  if  the  Applicant  can  demonstrate  that  the  active 
substance  of  the  medicinal  product  has  been  in  well-established  medicinal  use  within  the  EU  for  at 
least 10 years, with recognised efficacy and an acceptable level of safety in terms of the conditions set 
out  in  Annex  I  of  the  abovementioned  Directive,  it  is  possible  to  replace  results  of  pre-clinical  and 
clinical trials by detailed references to appropriate scientific literature.  
Scientific publications of product-specific studies are evaluated which have outlined the efficacy of PPS 
in comparison to placebo, to other medicinal products or in an uncontrolled fashion. In the case of PPS 
capsules  the  information  evaluated  in  this  dossier  is  mainly  taken  from  publications  on  studies 
conducted  with  Elmiron  capsules  which  is  the  identical  medicinal  product  as  the  product  approved  in 
the US and Canada.  
To  identify  all  relevant  studies  a  literature  search  using  the  control  terms  "cystitis"  AND  "pentosan" 
was conducted in DIMDI, MedPilot, and PubMed. Relevant publications identified after a first review of 
abstracts  were  studied  in  more  detail  to  extract  the  required  information.  In  addition,  relevant 
references cited in the publications identified as described were hand searched and evaluated. 
First  scientific  articles  describing  the  efficacy  of  PPS  in  this  indication  were  published  in  1983. 
Treatment  with  PPS  is  defined  as  standard  of  care  for  the  treatment  of  bladder  pain  syndrome  or 
Interstitial Cystitis in European treatment Guidelines since the year 2004. 
The efficacy of PPS capsules is supported by six placebo-controlled clinical studies as pivotal data. Five 
of these studies were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies. In addition one 2x2 
factorial  study  was  conducted  with  PPS  and  hydroxyzine  in  a  placebo-controlled  design  (see  table 
“main clinical studies”).  
Supportive data on the efficacy and safety of PPS capsules are also provided from uncontrolled studies 
conducted with PPS capsules as well as from active controlled studies. 
Interstitial cystitis / BPS is a disease primarily defined by the symptoms experienced by the patients. 
There are no established pharmacodynamics biomarkers or histopathological indicators for the severity 
of  the  disease.  All  6  placebo-controlled  studies  evaluated  efficacy  via  patient-reported  outcome 
measures as key evaluation tools. 
GCP 
As this application was submitted under Article 10a (well-established use) it is based on literature. 
Based on literature only, it is not possible to confirm with certainty whether the studies were 
performed in accordance with the guidelines and principles of Good Clinical Practices (GCP). Still, some 
limited information about GCP could be retrieved for the following studies: 
Holm-Bentzen 1987: the Helsinki-II declaration was used.  
Nickel at al 2015: the study was done in accordance with the ethical principles originating in the 
Declaration of Helsinki, consistent with Good Clinical Practices and applicable regulatory requirements. 
All patients provided written informed consent before study participation.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The composition of the product under application and the product Elmiron authorised in the US for 
relief of bladder pain or discomfort associated with IC since September 1996 which was used in the 
literature references is qualitatively and quantitatively identical.  
The three studies with PK data are presented below:

Absorption 
Fellström et al 1987 and Simon et al. 2005 both showed a very low bioavailability, around or less than 
1%.  In  three-way  crossover  study  of  Faaij  et  al.  (1999),  18  healthy  male  subjects  received  an  i.v. 
bolus  injection  of  50  mg  PPS,  an  oral  dose  of  1500  mg  PPS,  or  placebo;  oral  bioavailability  varied 
between -0.1 and 0.1% and did not differ from placebo. This conclusion was based in detection of PPS 
based on effect parameters (APTT and increase of anti-Xa activity as primary parameters. Simon et al., 
2005 concluded that PPS was poorly absorbed (bioavailability <1%) in healthy females. This conclusion 
was  based  in  detection  of  intact  PPS  content  in  urine.  In  this  clinical  study  healthy  female  subjects 
administered  a  single  oral  dose  of  [3H]PPS  (200  µCi,  <15  mg)  +  300  mg  unlabelled  PPS  or  [3H]PPS 
(300  µCi,  <15  mg)  + 450  mg  unlabelled  PPS  to  generate  samples  containing  higher  concentration of 
radioactivity in plasma, urine and faeces for metabolic profiling analysis.  
Excretion  and  mass  balance  in  urine  and  faeces  for  the  low  dose  group:  the  total  recovery  of 
radioactivity  in  200  µCi  dose  group  after  120  h  was  90.43%  ±  8.10%  (range  73.22-97.89%): 
Approximately 6.30% ± 1.11% (4.78-7.97%) was excreted in the urine and 84.13% ± 7.71% (68.45-
91.56%) was recovered in the faeces (see Figure 4). Thus, the applicant notes that percentage of PPS 
absorbed  was  very  low.  Radioactivity  counts  in  plasma  samples  were  insignificant  and  variable  with 
median  (CV%)  peak  plasma  PPS  concentrations  of  250  (25)  ng-eq/ml  and  358  (9.3)  ng-eq/ml  for 
lower and higher dose groups, respectively. The peak plasma concentrations were seen at similar time 
points  (~2  h).  The  Applicant  explained  that  despite  that,  the  fact  that  about  6%  of  the  administered 
dose  of  radiolabelled  PPS  were  excreted  via  urine  shows  that  absorption  takes  place  and  that  PPS 
localizes in the urinary tract after oral administration. This preferential localization was also reported in 
respective studies conducted in rats (Odlind et al., 1987).

Distribution 
Systemic bioavailability of PPS after oral administration of PPS is very low, accordingly, distribution of 
PPS was mainly evaluated after parenteral application.  
MacGregor et al., 1984 
Five healthy volunteers (52 to 77 kg, 28 to 44 years old) were included in the study for this paper. 
Four subjects received either 0, 0.1, 1, 7 or 50 mg PPS iv with an iode-based radioactive tracer. 
Radioactivity was cleared from the blood with a half-live between 13-28 minutes in the lower doses 
and 45 minutes for the 50 mg dose. Most radioactivity was cleared in a second phase over the next 
24-96 hours. 
Images taken at 5 minutes interval from 7.5 to 47.5 minutes showed progressive uptake by the liver 
and spleen. At three hour a profile scan showed 60% of the activity in the liver and spleen, and 13% in 
the bladder. 
Forestier et al., 1986 
In the study described by the article, eight women who were going to have an abortion received 50 mg 
PPS IV. Clinical data (change of coagulation parameters in foetus plasma) provided no indication of 
transplacental PPS. A potential transplacental passage was evaluated by measuring maternal and 
foetal coagulation parameters. While in the maternal plasma aPTT was prolonged, factor Xa generation 
was impaired and factor V level was deeply decreased 30 minutes after intravenous administration of 
50 mg PPS, the respective parameters were unchanged in the plasma of the foetuses of the exposed 
mothers compared to plasma obtained from control foetuses at the same stage of gestation. The data 
generated in this study provide no indication of transplacental passage of PPS.  
Since no further data from clinical studies with PPS in pregnant or nursing women are available, the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) states that PPS capsules should not be used during 
pregnancy or lactation unless clearly necessary.

Data generated by Simon et al., 2005 indicated that the majority of orally administered PPS (84.13% 
± 7.71% after 120 h) remained unabsorbed and was excreted predominantly unchanged in the faeces. 
Radioactivity in the urine consisted mostly of components of lower molecular weight and lower degrees 
of sulfation than PPS. 6.30% ± 1.11% of the administered dose of radiolabelled PPS were excreted via 
urine during 120 h after application.  
Urine collected over 18 hr after intravenous injection of radiolabelled 125I-PPS contained 35% of the 
administered activity while stools passed at 18 and 42 hr post-injection contained 0.13% and 0.07% 
respectively (MacGregor et al., 1984).   
Radioactivity was detectable in urine within an hour of i.v. injection of 125I-PPS. The recovery of 
radioactivity in the urine within 24 hr following i.v. injection averaged 31% of the injected dose (range 
22-43%) and was not related to the dose of unlabelled PPS (MacGregor et al., 1984). 
• 
Metabolism 
Metabolism of 125I-PPS radiolabelled PPS was evaluated via binding affinity to Polybrene in order to 
detect the desulfation of PPS and gel filtration in order to detect depolymerisation. PPS without affinity 
to Polybrene was concluded to be macromolecular desulfated PPS. The probable sites of desulfation are 
the liver and spleen which are rich sources of sulfatases. This assumption is supported by another 
experiment evaluating the organ distribution of PPS after i.v. administration. Only macromolecular PPS 
was present in plasma indicating that the kidney is the site of depolymerisation (MacGregor et al., 
1984).  
In the study conducted by Simon et al., 2005 a metabolic profiling analysis was conducted in the 
urine, faeces and plasma samples obtained from three of the high dose subjects. As specific assays for 
PPS do not exist, metabolic profiling was accomplished through multiple fraction collections and 
radiochromatographic techniques. The metabolic profiling with urine indicates that PPS was 
metabolized extensively by desulfation and depolymerisation. The HPLC profiling undertaken with urine 
samples from selected time-points showed similar HPLC profiles, indicating the metabolic profile did 
not change appreciably with time. Faeces samples analysed indicated that mainly unchanged PPS is 
contained in faeces representing PPS amounts that were not absorbed from the GI tract. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
In Simon et al 2005, after 200 and 300 mg PPS per os, Cmax and AUC were proportional between the 
two doses. However, as the sample size was small, and no other dose proportionality data are 
presented, no firm conclusion on dose linearity can be made. 
In Marshall et al 1997, after oral administration of PPS three times daily, Cmax increased nearly 7 fold 
and AUCtau increased nearly 8 fold between D1 and D15. An 8-fold increase in Cmax and AUCtau is 
consistent with a terminal elimination half-live of 20 hours, which is consistent with the 20 to 24 hours 
half-live.  
According to the accumulation factor R which describes the ratio of Cmax (as well as AUC0-tau, where 
tau is the dosing interval) between a single dose administration and at steady state, i.e. after multiple 
administrations, linear pharmacokinetics were assumed. Calculated half-life was 34 hours and the 
accumulation factor R of 5 to 6.7 must be expected upon repeated dosing of PPS at 8-hours intervals, 
considering the half-life to be in range between 24 and 34 hours. Oral administration of pentosan 
polysulfate sodium 3-times daily is expected to lead to accumulation of pentosan polysulfate sodium 
over the first 7 days of administration (accumulation factor 5-6.7).

Special populations 
PK has not been studied in special populations (elderly patients, hepatically or renally impaired 
patients, paediatric patients, pregnant and breast feeding women), this was considered acceptable with 
the relevant information included into the SmPC. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No drug-drug interaction study was performed with PPS by the Applicant. Based on one open-label 
study (Modi et al 2005), the therapeutic doses of PPS have no effect on the pharmacokinetics of R- and 
S-warfarin or on pharmacodynamics effect as measured by PT, PTT and INR. Besides, the orally 
administered PPS did not influence aPTT, anti-Xa activity, hepatic triglyceride lipase and lipoprotein 
lipase   in comparison with intravenously PPS or placebo (Faaij et al 1999). There is no expected 
metabolic drug-drug interaction with desulfation and depolymerisation reactions. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The hypothetic mechanism of action of pentosan polysulfate sodium includes a local effect in the 
bladder after systemic administration and excretion into the urine by binding of glycosaminoglycans to 
the deficient mucous of the bladder. This binding of glycosaminoglycans to the bladder mucous 
bacterial adherence to the cells is reduced by pentosan polysulfate sodium and in consequence the 
incidence of infections is reduced as well. It is hypothesized, that a potential barrier function of 
pentosan polysulfate sodium instead of the damaged urothelial mucus might play a role as well the 
anti-inflammatory activity of pentosan polysulfate sodium. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Mainly two potential mechanisms of action are discussed in scientific literature, a repair of defects in 
the glycosaminoglycan layer and an anti-inflammatory effect of PPS. Respective assumptions on the 
mode of action are also reflected in the publications on the pivotal studies (Parsons and Mulholland, 
1987, Holm-Bentzen et al., 1987, Mullholland et al., 1990). No clinical studies explicitly evaluating 
potential pharmacodynamics of PPS for the treatment of Interstitial Cystitis were reported in scientific 
literature, but relevant in vitro data with human cells have been generated, which, together with 
supportive evidence from non-clinical studies reported in scientific literature for the respective 
hypothesis clearly support the two potential mechanisms of action (please refer to chapter on primary 
pharmacodynamic studies in the non-clinical part of this report).   
Secondary pharmacology 
No dedicated studies were performed. The publication of a small PD study on 18 healthy volunteers 
after administration of oral doses was submitted which evaluated the impact of orally administered PPS 
on the coagulation system (Faaij et al., 1999). Because no specific assays were available to measure 
PPS directly during the conduct of the study, indirect measures were used to evaluate the amount of 
systemically available PPS after oral administration. The evaluated parameters included activated 
partial thromboplastin time (APTT) and increase of anti-Xa activity as well as measures of endogenous 
fibrinolysis (tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) activity and fibrin plate lysis). 
Assessment report

The study was carried out as a three-way cross-over bioavailability design, in which 18 non-smoking, 
normotensive male healthy volunteers received an intravenous bolus injection of 50 mg PPS, and oral 
dose of 1500 mg PPS or an oral placebo. The wash-out period between the study days was 2 weeks. 
While the intravenous application of PPS lead to relevant effects on APTT, Anti-Xa activity, t-PA activity 
and fibrin plate lysis, no such effects were detected after oral administration of the very high dose of 
1500 mg PPS applied orally to the subjects. 
However as Elmiron post-marketing experience with humans and Nickel et al. (2005) data indicate that 
most common reported AEs were diarrhoea, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain the Applicant was 
asked to clarify PPS action on GIT providing clear explanation of possible action mechanism, may be 
related with anticoagulant and fibrinolytic or local irritative properties. 
Firstly, the Applicant stated causal relationship of GITs and the administration of PPS is not obvious. 
GITs are equally reported as associated with the underlying disease and independent of any treatment. 
According to Van de Merwe, 2006, many patients with IC also have gastrointestinal disorders. A survey

The author states that it is unclear why patients with IC have these gastrointestinal diseases or 
disorders more frequently than the general population, apart from similar abnormalities in the 
movement of the smooth muscle tissue, the type of inflammation process and the occurrence of ulcers. 
Gastrointestinal disorders as part of IC were stressed likewise by Jocham et al., 2013. Investigating 
the care situation of patients with IC in Germany he found that 4.81% of the patients reported 
gastrointestinal problems as symptoms associated with IC.

The Applicant found an exception in the Marshall et al., 1997 clinical study involving 21 patients with 
metastatic advanced cancer. Patients were treated with PPS three times per day in cohorts at planned 
doses of 180, 270, 400, 600 and 800 mg/m2 body surface in the continuous highest oral dose 
administered up to almost 2000 mg PPS daily over up to two months. PPS did not cause significant 
systemic adverse events, but 20 out of total of 21 patients developed moderate to severe 
gastrointestinal adverse events within 1-2 months at doses of 400mg/m2 TID. 
The PPS dose is estimated to be 3–6 times higher than the recommended dose of PPS used for the 
treatment of IC. Account should be taken of the fact that the reported gastrointestinal symptoms could 
likewise be the result of the underlying cancer disease (among others 6 patients with sarcoma, 5 
patients with colon carcinoma). It is reported that 14 of the treated patients had completed at least 
two other treatment attempts before. Possible adequate therapies include radiation therapies which 
can likewise cause a proctitis with progressive mucosal atrophy from injured micro-vascularisation in 
the mucosa and submucosal stroma. Furthermore the irradiation of colonic mucosa might decrease 
prostaglandin production and affect the mucosal permeability to some bile acids causing further 
destruction and/or alteration of the mucosa eliminating the natural protective barrier of the lower 
gastrointestinal tract. Thus, the diarrhoea reported might be seen as an attending symptom of the 
proctitis rather than a side effect of PPS. Further data allowing an assessment of a potential effect of a 
concomitant therapy as well as to the immunological status are missing. 
On the other hand Grigsby et al., 1990 reports of 13 patients, who were treated because of chronic 
radiation induced proctitis including tenesmus orally with 150 mg up to 300 mg PPS TID. Notably there 
was no severe acute or chronic toxicity reported in this study, especially no hint on GIT. 
Secondly, the Applicant states PK data show that the uptake of PPS following oral administration is low. 
The impact of orally administered PPS in man on the coagulation system was studied systematically in 
a bioavailability study by Faaij et al., 1999 proving that the oral administration of 1500 mg PPS (5 
times the recommended daily intake) showed no systemic effects on the coagulation system. Thus the 
Applicant considers it highly unlikely that there is any causal relationship due to the anticoagulant and 
fibrinolytic properties of PPS. 
Thirdly, the Applicant states causal relationship of PPS regarding GITs based on pharmacodynamics 
and pharmacokinetics is not reported in literature. Therefore, the Applicant presented following 
reflections: 
•  Diarrhoea, nausea, dyspepsia and abdominal pain could be due to an osmotic load effect of the 
PPS created by undigested and/or unabsorbed PPS as well as the cellulose as part of the 
capsule. 
• 
The degree of sulfatation of PPS might interact with the mucin production GIT causing irritant 
effects. The gastrointestinal tract is coated by a thick layer of mucus that forms the front line 
of innate host defence. The mucus consists of high molecular weight glycoproteins called 
mucins that are synthesized and secreted by goblet cells and functions primarily to lubricate 
the epithelium and protect it from damage by noxious substances. High degrees of sulfatation 
of PPS may led to a higher degree of sulfatation in the high molecular weight mucin form and a 
disturbances in mucin sulfatation process could be detrimental to the maintenance of gastric 
mucus coat integrity.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Absorption 
Fellström  and  al  and  Simon  and  al.  both  showed  a  very  low  bioavailability,  around  or  less  than  1%. 
According  to  Fellström  et  al.,  1987,  Marshall  et  al.,  1997  and  Simon  et  al  2005,  6-7%  of  the 
administered radioactivity is excreted with the urine and the fraction of unchanged PPS (compared to 
total  radioactivity)  is  about  1-2%  in  urine  compared  to  10-15%  in  plasma.  Therefore,  it  can  be 
extrapolated  that  about  1%  of  the  orally  administered  PPS  finally  binds  to  the  GAG  layer  of  the 
urothelium. Considering these pharmacokinetics data, about 3 mg of the unchanged product will reach 
its target (bladder epithelium) in the urinary tract following a daily oral dose of 300 mg PPS.  
The applicant justifies recommending using PPS capsules with water at least 1 hour before meals or 2 
hours after meals based on the use the pivotal studies and the efficacy and safety being established for 
the respective dosing schedule. This was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Distribution 
The  reported  volume  of  distribution  at  steady  state reported  in  Fellström  et  al  was  0.67  ±  0.28  L/kg 
(for an average 70 kg adult, Vss 46.9 ± 19.6 L). The clearance reported in Fellström et al. was 49.9 ± 
6.6 mL/min. Macgregor et al. showed progressive uptake of PPS by the spleen and the liver after i.v. 
administration. Forestier et al based the absence of trans placental passage of PPS on the absence of 
clinical signs (change in coagulation parameters).  
Elimination and Metabolism 
Reported  renal  clearance  was  4.2  ±  1.2  mL/min  in  Fellström  et  al.  Terminal  elimination  half-life  was 
24.1  ±  10.8  hours  in  Fellström  et  al;  and  in  Simon  et  al.  it  was  reported  as  26.5  h  (CV  23%)  and 
19.5 h  (CV  16%)  for  300  and  450  mg  PPS  respectively.  The  apparent  plasma  half-life  of  pentosan 
polysulfate  sodium  depends  on  the  route  of  administration.  While  pentosan  polysulfate  sodium  is 
rapidly  cleared  from  circulation  of  i.v.  administration,  the  apparent  plasma  half-life  after  oral 
administration is in the range of 24-34 hours. 
Simon et al. documented that after oral administration, the majority of PPS was excreted unchanged in 
faeces,  and  6%  of  the  dose  was  excreted  in  urine.  In  Simon  et  al,  radioactivity  in  urine  consisted 
mostly  of  components  of  lower  molecular  weight  and  lower  degrees  of  sulfation  (indicating  PPS  was 
metabolised  by  depolymerisation  and  desulfation).  Pentosan  polysulfate  does  not  exhibit  any 
crystalline structure or polymorphism, so no inter-conversion was expected.  
The  applicant  highlights  two  studies  (Mac  Gregor  et  al.,  1984  and  Simon  et  al  2005)  that  details 
metabolic  pathways.  The  studies  suggest  that  metabolism  take  place  in  liver,  spleen  and  kidneys  via 
desulfation  (assumed  to  be  in  liver  and  spleen,  which  are  rich  sources  of  sulfatases)  and 
depolymerisation  (concluded  as  taking  place  in  kidneys,  as  depolymerised  species  were  found  not  in 
plasma  but  in  urine  only).  This  is  summarized  in  SmPC  (section  5.2).  No  specific  proportions  for 
metabolism are given which is acceptable, considering rather limited extent of absorption.  
Dose linearity and time dependency 
In Simon et al 2005, after 200 and 300 mg PPS per os, Cmax and AUC were proportional between the 
two  doses.  However,  as  the  sample  size  was  small,  and  no  other  dose  proportionality  data  are 
presented, no firm conclusion on dose linearity can be made. 
In Marshall et al, after oral administration of PPS three times daily, Cmax increased nearly 7 fold and 
AUCtau  increased  nearly  8  fold  between  D1  and  D15.  An  8-fold  increase  in  Cmax  and  AUCtau  is 
consistent with a terminal elimination half-live of 20 hours, which is consistent with the 20 to 24 hours 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 54/115 
 
 
 
 
 
half-live. According to the accumulation factor R which describes the ratio of Cmax (as well as AUC0-
tau,  where  tau  is  the  dosing  interval)  between  a  single  dose  administration  and  at  steady  state,  i.e. 
after multiple administrations, linear pharmacokinetics was assumed. Calculated half-life was 34 hours 
and  the  accumulation  factor  R of  5 to  6.7 must  be expected  upon  repeated dosing of  PPS  at  8-hours 
intervals,  considering  the  half-life  to  be  in  range  between  24  and  34  hours.  The  calculation  is 
appropriate and this information was reflected in the SmPC.  
In  the  pharmacokinetic  study  published  by  Simon  et  al.,  2005,  inter-individual  variability  of  exposure 
was  relatively  low.  Coefficients  of  variation  (CVs)  of  Cmax  and  AUC  ranged  from  9.3-25%  in  this 
population of 16 healthy women. 
PK  has  not  been  studied  in  some  of  the  special  populations  (elderly  patients,  hepatically  or  renally 
impaired  patients,  paediatric  patients,  pregnant  and  breast  feeding  women)  the  lack  of  this  data  and 
precautionary statement are reflected in the SmPC which was considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
No drug-drug interaction study was performed with PPS by the Applicant. A causal relationship 
between PPS und GIT-AEs is not obvious. In case of a causal relationship, most likely local irritant 
properties as suggested might be responsible regarding an interaction of PPS and mucus. In the 
context of the side effect rectal bleeding the applicant was asked to summarize the safety of oral PPS 
and provide additional information from several studies about the risk of rectal bleeding. Based on one 
open-label study (Modi et al 2005), the therapeutic doses of PPS have no effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of R- and S-warfarin or on pharmacodynamics effect as measured by PT, PTT and 
INR. Besides, the orally administered PPS did not influence aPTT, anti-Xa activity, hepatic triglyceride 
lipase and lipoprotein lipase  in comparison with intravenously PPS or placebo (Faaij et al 1999). 
However, taking into consideration that rectal bleeding is a clinically significant AR and the 
pharmacological class precautions and warnings referring to a weak anticoagulant effect of PPS were 
included in the proposed SmPC for PPS and respective information on potential interactions in case of 
concomitant administration of anticoagulant medicinal products is provided. 
No PK/PD profiles of PPS have been investigated by the applicant which is acceptable in this rare 
indication. Likewise, no clinical pharmacology studies were performed with PPS. Thus, the mechanism 
of action of PPS is currently not completely understood. It is hypothesized, that a potential barrier 
function of PPS instead of the damaged urothelial mucus might play a role in the bladder endothelium 
as well the anti-inflammatory activity of PPS. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
A potential weak anticoagulant effect of PPS in patients especially “in patients with an increased risk of 
bleeding due to concomitant treatments with anticoagulants, heparin derivatives, thrombolytic or 
antiplatelet agents including acetylsalicylic acid, or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicinal products” 
was adequately reflected in the SmPC.  
Regarding the pharmacodynamics, mainly two potential mechanisms of action are discussed in 
scientific literature, a repair of defects in the glycosaminoglycan layer and an anti-inflammatory effects 
of PPS. Overall, the studies conducted in vitro in human cells supported by relevant non-clinical in vivo 
studies described above provide solid evidence for both mechanisms of action. 
However, Pharmacological data of PPS are still lacking in human to better understand the real 
mechanism of action of PPS in IC / bladder pain syndrome characterized by either glomerulations or 
Hunner’s lesions in adults. The assessment relies therefore on the evaluation of efficacy in the pivotal 
trials.

Overall the clinical pharmacology of this product can be considered sufficiently described for the 
purpose of the marketing authorisation. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
In the two provided supportive dose range evaluations for potential dose-response relationship (Nickel 
et al., 2005, Nickel et al., 2015) neither 1x100 mg of PPS /day versus 3x100 mg or 2x300 mg, 3x300 
mg versus 3x 100 mg of PPS per day leads to statistically significant differences in terms of efficacy. 
2.5.2.  Main studies 
Title of studies 
The efficacy of PPS capsules was supported by six placebo-controlled clinical studies as pivotal data. 
Five of these studies were double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical studies. 
Methods 
Study Participants  
The enrolled patient population differed between the studies, reflecting understanding and definition of 
IC at the time, when the study was planned and conducted.  
Indeed, there were several agreed definition for IC available in urology among different regions one of 
the  first  agreed  by  US  National  Institute  of  Health  –  National  Institutes  of  Diabetes,  Digestive,  and 
Kidney Disease (NIDDK) in US in 1987, by International Continence Society in 2002 (O’Leary-Sant 
Interstitial  Cystitis  Symptoms  Index  ICSI),  more  recently  by  European  Society  for  the  Study  of 
IC/BPS  (ESSIC)  in  2008,  later  by  American  Urological  Association  (AUA)  in  2014  and  European 
Association of Urology (EAU) Guidelines on Chronic Pelvic Pain of the European Association of Urology 
in 2015.  
In particular, ESSIC classification 2X and 3C would meet the NIDDK criteria for IC.

Patients meeting the ESSIC classification 2X to 3C (characterized by either glomerulations or Hunner’s 
lesions were included in four pivotal studies (Parsons and Mulholland 1987, Mulholland et al 1990, 
Parsons et al 1993 and Sant et al 2003).  
Treatments 
The main studies were performed with Elmiron capsules, which is the identical medicinal product 
authorised in the US as the product being applied for in the context of the current application.  
The majority of patients in the pivotal studies as well as in the supportive studies were treated with the 
established dose of 3x100 mg PPS per day and few patients received a dose of 2x200 mg PPS per day. 
The treatment duration varied from 3 months, 4 months or 6 months. 
An overview of the dose-regimens used in the 6 pivotal studies is provided below:

Objectives 
The study objectives of the pivotal studies focused either on IC or IC/BPS treatments.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Key study endpoints/outcomes in all 6 pivotal studies were patient-reported outcomes via patient 
responder analysis. As the definitions for responder analyses were rather heterogeneous, the applicant 
provided an overview of efficacy endpoints used in the six pivotal studies.

Sample size 
In Holm-Bentzen et al, 1987, the minimum number of patients in each protocol estimated before the 
trial was calculated to 40 on the basis of the following parameters: 2 α = 5%  (risk of type 1 error), β 
= 10% (risk of type 2 error), π1 = 20% (the estimated placebo effect) and π2 = 70% (the estimated 
drug effect).  
In Sant 2003, the projected sample size of 136 participants was selected to detect large differences in 
response rates of 30% versus 65% (80% power at a 2-sided significance level of 5%). The factorial 
design provides a savings in overall sample size and is especially useful in studying drugs with non-
overlapping mechanisms of effect. However, there is limited statistical power to compare results 
among individual treatment arms. This trial was intended primarily as a pilot study to evaluate the 
feasibility of conducting a larger clinical trial. A second objective was to evaluate whether or not there 
was sufficient evidence of efficacy to warrant expansion to a larger trial. The factorial design combined 
arms for analysis to increase the statistical power for the main comparisons over that available from 
comparing individual arms.  
In Nickel et al 2015, the target sample size was 645 patients to yield 600 (200 per treatment group) 
who were evaluable defined as those with 1 follow-up evaluation after baseline. A sample of 215 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 60/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects per group (total of 645) would provide 90% power to detect a 15% difference in the 
proportion of responders based on ICSI, assuming 30% responders in the active treatment groups and 
15% responders in the placebo group.  
In Parsons 1987, Mulholland 1990, Parsons 1993, the sample size determination was not mentioned.  
Randomisation 
In Holm-Bentzen 1987, in both protocols patients were randomized after fulfilling the inclusion criteria 
and pre-trial investigations to receive either 200 mg sodium pentosan polysulfate or placebo capsules 
twice daily for 4 months. The interval from cystoscopy to randomization varied but it was not allowed 
to exceed 4 months. Some patients benefited from dilatation during cystoscopy for 1 to 3 months and 
they did not start the medication before recurrence of symptoms. The pre-trial symptom score values 
date from the day the patient began medication.  
In  Parsons  1987,  the  patients  were  randomized to drug  or  placebo  groups  by  the  pharmacy  to  begin 
therapy (treatment A). Therapy was begun with 100 mg pentosan polysulfate (or a look-alike placebo) 
3 times daily or 200 mg twice daily, depending on institution they attended. At the end of 3 months, if 
the  patient  failed  to  respond  to  therapy,  cross-over to treatment  B  was  begun  (from  drug placebo or 
vice versa). If the patient responded to treatment A, he or she returned in 3 more months, and if there 
still was a positive response cross-over to treatment B was instituted.  
In Mulholland 1990, the patients were randomly assigned to PPS or placebo group in accordance with a 
computer-generated random code providing two parallel groups of patients for comparison.  
In  Parsons  1993,  patients  were  randomly  assigned  to  receive  pentosan  polysulfate  or  placebo  in 
accordance with a computer generated random code providing 2 parallel groups for comparison.  
In Sant 2003, 121 participants were randomized by the 7 participating institutions (representing 89% 
of  the  goal)  over  18  months  in  equal  proportions  to  the  4  treatment  arms  using  a  randomized  block 
design stratified by clinical site.  
In  Nickel  2015,  eligible  patients  were  randomized  to  PPS  100  mg  QD,  PPS  100  mg  TID  (the  FDA 
approved  dose)  or  matching  placebo  in  a  1:1:1  ratio  based  on  a  computer  generated  randomization 
schedule.  Randomization  was  balanced  using  randomly  permuted  blocks  and  stratified  by  whether 
patients had or had not ever been treated with PPS.  
Blinding (masking) 
All pivotal studies were randomized double-blind according to the authors. 
Statistical methods 
All six pivotal clinical studies provided a statistical analysis of the efficacy results generated in the 
respective study: 
The efficacy endpoints evaluated in the pivotal placebo-controlled studies were all based on a patient-
reported outcome of rather subjective symptoms. In such analyses, the placebo effects are usually 
rather high. Each of the studies enrolled a very limited number of patients based on the rarity of the 
disease.

Results 
Participant flow 
1) In Holm-Bentzen 1987, of the 43 patients in protocol A, 39 completed the study (19 received 
sodium pentosan polysulfate and 20 received placebo). 4 patients did not complete the protocol A: 2 
stopped the medication because of headache, nausea, and dizziness after 1 month and 5 days 
respectively, 1 was included by mistake and 1 refused to participate. Of the 72 patients in protocol B, 
66 completed the study (33 received sodium pentosan polysulfate and 33 received placebo). 6 patients 
did not complete protocol B: 1 stopped the medication because of a skin rash after 2 weeks, 1 stopped 
because aggravation of bladder symptoms, 2 refused to participate, 1 was included by mistake and 1 
was not followed.  
2) In Parsons and Mulholland 1987, of 75 patients randomized into the study, 4 withdrew before they 
received medication, 9 failed to return to complete the study. Not all patients completed evaluation 
sheets properly, such that there was no-post-treatment report on urgency in 2 and on frequency in 7. 
62 patients completed the study.  
3) In Mulholland et al 1990, 110 patients with documented IC with a duration of one year or more 
enrolled in the study. Of these, 56 patients were treated with placebo, and 54 were treated with PPS. 
Twelve patients (3 treated with PPS and 9 treated with placebo) failed to complete the 3 month study. 
Of these 12, 8 were in the group of patients classified as having severe disease, 1 (3%) receiving PPS 
and 7 (21%) receiving placebo. Most of these patients were lost to follow-up and it is likely that lack of 
efficacy was responsible for the patients dropping out. The difference in the drop-out rate between the 
treatment groups in these patients with severe disease was statistically significant (p = 0.05). The 
treatment was discontinued by 1 patient in the PPS group and 2 in the placebo group due to adverse 
reactions.  
Of the patients who completed the three-month double-blind period, 44% were continuing therapy 
with PPS one and a half years after the start of the study. These patients had been on therapy for 
periods ranging from six months to one and a half years.  
4) In Parsons et al 1993, a total of 148 patients was enrolled in the study, 74 in each treatment group. 
A total of 18 patients, 9 in each treatment group failed to complete the 3 month study. Of these 
patients, 3 in the pentosan polysulfate group and 5 in the placebo group dropped out because of 
adverse experiences and the remainder were lost to follow-up. It is likely that lack of efficacy was 
responsible for these latter dropouts. Only 3 patients in the pentosan polysulfate group and 5 in the 
placebo group discontinued treatment due to adverse reactions.  
5) In Sant et al 2003, although recruitment was extended by 8 months, only 121 participants were 
randomized by the 7 participating institutions, representing 89% of goal. Complete follow-up data 
obtained in 96 participants (96%). The primary reasons given for withdrawal were adverse events 
(10of 25, 40%), dissatisfaction with treatment, trial, or symptom changes (7/25, 28%) and other 
(8/25, 32%).  
6) In Nickel et al 2015, the participant flow was the following:

A total of 679 patients were screened and 369 eligible patients were randomized of whom 1 did not 
receive a dose of study drug. Thus 368 patients were included in the ITT data set. Of the 368 ITT 
patients, 162 withdrew from study (53 in the PPS 100 mg 3x/d, 54 in the PPS 100 mg/d and 55 
patients in the placebo group). Adverse events which were mostly gastro-intestinal, led to the 
withdrawal of 12 patients (10.2%) in the placebo group, 17 (13.3%) in the PPS 100 mg/day group and 
14 (11.5%) in the PPS 100 mg 3x/day.   
Recruitment 
All but one Nickel et al. (2015) of the 6 pivotal studies were conducted more than 10 years ago. 
Conduct of the studies 
Studies by Sant et al. (2003) and Nickel et al. (2015) were conducted in the US at a time, when PPS 
(Elmiron) was commercially available for the treatment of IC. Both studies faced severe recruitment 
problems, which lead to enrolment of patients, who were previously treated with PPS. The Study by 
Sant et al. (2003) amended exclusion criteria in order to improve recruitment. Initially the study 
excluded patients who had been previously treated with ≥100 mg TID oral PPS for ≥12 consecutive 
weeks. This criterion was amended to an exclusion of PPS treatment during 4 weeks prior to the study; 
15/121 patients (12%) were randomized before this amendment.  
The study by Nickel et al. (2015) was terminated earlier despite numerous efforts to promote 
recruitment. A higher than expected response rate noted in a blinded analysis of study data in 2009 
(44% vs the 25% response rate used in the sample size calculation) combined with the slow enrolment 
led to the interim analysis of study data by individuals uninvolved in study performance. These results 
prompted early termination of the study. Futility assessment revealed that continuing the study until 
its planned sample size may have taken up to additional 5 years, and would not have increased 
significantly the chance of a successful trial.

Baseline data 
A total of 413 patients were exposed in the reported pivotal studies to PPS in the recommended dose 
of 300 mg per day (or a very comparable dose of 400 mg per day), the majority of these patients were 
Caucasian, female and the average age was above 40 years: 
1) The study reported by Holm-Bentzen et al., 1987 was conducted in 7 centers in Denmark and in the 
UK. Nineteen patients were exposed to PPS and 20 patients received placebo in protocol A while in 
protocol B, 33 patients were enrolled in each group. In protocol A, all patients were female and the 
median age was 63 years (range 34 to 80 years). The median duration of the disease was 7 years with 
a range of 1 to 50 years. In protocol B, 61 women and 5 men were included; the median age was 51 
years (range 29 to 78 years). The median duration of the disease was 6 years with a range of 1 to 51 
years.  
In both protocols, patients were randomized after fulfilling the inclusion criteria and pre-trial 
investigations. All patients studied had had clinical/or cystoscopic evidence of painful bladder disease 
for at least 1 year and repeated negative urine cultures. The interval from cystoscopy to randomization 
varied but it was not allowed to exceed 4 months. The pre-trial symptom score values was evaluated 
from the day the patient began medication by the symptom scale.  
Besides, the mast cells in the detrusor muscle were counted in 2 separate biopsies from each patient 
by the same observer.  
In protocol A, the fulfilment of a pathological anatomical criterion for IC was necessary (> 28 mast 
cells per mm² in the detrusor muscle in a bladder biopsy).  
In protocol B, no definite pathological anatomical criteria were obtained but all patients had mast cell 
counts < 28/mm².  
The majority of patients have petechial bleeding at baseline (15/19 in protocol A and 24/33 in protocol 
B), but a relevant (39%) proportion had no petechial bleeding at baseline. 
2) No clear information is provided on the patient demographics of the study reported by Parsons and 
Mulholland, 1987, which was conducted in the US in 2 medical centers. Based on the results, 62 
patients were exposed to PPS in this study with 10% male and 90% female patients.  
Patients were eligible have at least one year of symptoms, consisting of urgency, frequency, nocturia 
and/or pain, negative urine cultures, a cystoscopic examination that showed an ulcer or petechial 
hemorrhage (after bladder distension) and negative cytology studies. Ulcers were present in 28% of 
the patients at baseline and pain in 75%. There were no abnormal serum tests, including prothrombine 
time, partial thromboplastin time, lactic dehydrogenase, serum glutamic oxaloacetic and pyruvic 
transaminases, haematocrit or white blood count. Micturitional profiles were obtained in some patients 
but not in all. These profiles were done before the study and at each visit and consisted of a 3-day 
recording of each voided volume from which the average voided volume of daily voids could be 
determined.  
3) Of the 110 patients enrolled in the clinical study reported by Mulholland et al., 1990 54 patients 
were treated with PPS (mean age 43.3 years, 91% females, 100% Caucasians) and 56 patients were 
treated with placebo (mean age 45.3 years, 87% females, 95% Caucasians). The baseline 
characteristics are mentioned in the table 8 below.  
Table 14 Patient characteristics at baseline 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 64/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It should be noted that the study design was a double-blind placebo-controlled. The patients were 
randomized to drug or placebo groups by the pharmacy to begin therapy (treatment A). Therapy was 
begun with 100 mg pentosane polysulfate (or a look-alike placebo) 3 times daily or 200 mg twice daily, 
depending on which institution they attended. At the end of 3 months, if the patient failed to respond 
to therapy, cross-over to treatment B was begun (from drug to placebo or vice versa). If the patient 
responded to treatment A, he or she returned in 3 more months and if there still was a positive 
response cross-over to treatment B was instituted. To complete the study, the patient had to fail arms 
A and B, or to have 2 successive visits (6 months) with a positive response.  
Patients were categorized in terms of the severity of their disease. Patients with a moderate degree of 
disease were defined as having anesthetic bladder capacity over 400 ml, 18 or fewer voids per day, 
and an average voided volume of 75 ml or more. Patients were considered to have a severe degree of 
disease if they had bladder capacity under anesthesia of less 400 ml, or more than 18 voids per day, 
or an average voided volume of less than 75 ml. A patient with any one of these three criteria was 
included in the severe group. Anesthesic bladder capacity was measured under 80 cm of water 
pressure held for one minute in all patients under general or spinal anesthesia (see table 8 “patients’ 
characteristics at baseline”).  
4) The US-study reported by Parsons et al., 1993 enrolled 74 patients in each group, all of whom had 
documented IC of at least 1 year in duration. The mean age was 42.7 years in the PPS group and 45.5 
years in the placebo group. All patients in the PPS group were female and 93% of the placebo-treated 
patients were female. The vast majority of patients were Caucasians (97% in the PPS group and 96% 
in the placebo group). It was a prospective double-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted at 7 
clinical centers on 148 patients for a treatment period of 3 months.

Table 15 Patient characteristics at baseline 
There were no significant differences between the treatment groups at baseline in terms of age, sex, 
distribution, race, duration of disease, cystoscopic findings or bladder capacity.  
5) The factorial design study reported by Sant et al., 2003 was conducted in the US and enrolled 4 
groups of patients: 
. Placebo group: 31 patients; mean age 41.6 ± 15.5 years; 90% females, 94% Caucasians, 
. Hydroxyzine group: 31 patients; mean age 47.8 ± 13.9 years; 84% females, 84% Caucasians,  
. PPS group: 29 patients; mean age 48.7 ± 15.1 years; 90% females, 72 % Caucasians,  
. Combination group: 30 patients; mean age 43.7 ± 15.1 years; 93% females, 87% Caucasians.

6) The latest study reported by Nickel et al., 2015 enrolled 122 patients in the US (mean age 42.7 ± 
15.71; 92.6% females, 84.4% Caucasians) in the PPS 300 mg group, 128 patients (mean age 45.6 ± 
15.73; 92.2% females, 84.4% Caucasians) in the PPS 100 mg group, and 118 patients (mean age 
44.6 ± 14.58; 85.6% females, 87.3% Caucasians) in the placebo group.

The majority of patients were Caucasian, female and the average age was above 40 years. Although, 
5/6 pivotal studies were conducted in the US, the majority of the patients enrolled were Caucasians 
and are representative for the EU population.  
Outcomes and estimation 
1) Primary efficacy analysis  
Holm-Bentzen et al. (1987): no clinically significant difference between PPS and placebo was 
found for the median pre-trial and post-trial values for the total symptom score in protocols A and B. 
For protocol A the decrease was 0.625 in score values in both groups, while for protocol B the decrease 
was 0.50. The decreases in total symptom score compared to baseline were statistically significant in 
both protocols.  A clinically significant improvement was pre-defined as a decrease of at least 1.00 in 
the mean total symptom score per patient. A responder analysis evaluating the number of patients 
experiencing clinically significant improvement revealed a trend for higher responder rates under 
treatment with PPS compared to placebo (6 vs. 4 responders in protocol A and 9 vs. 7 responders in 
protocol B). Authors concluded that PPS was not superior over placebo in the treatment of painful 
bladder disease.   
Parsons and Mulholland (1987): Responder analysis (number of patients experiencing at least 50% 
improvement per symptom) on the four symptoms evaluated (pain, urgency, frequency and nocturia).  
Evaluation of all available patient data after cross-over showed that PPS was statistically 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 67/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
significantly (p<0.05) more effective than placebo in reaching improvement of all subjective 
symptoms (pain, urgency, frequency and nocturia). Voided volume showed a tendency towards 
significant increase (p = 0.06).  
In this study there was no overall evaluation of the symptoms. Patients who responded to therapy 
showed improvement at 5 to 10 weeks and continued to improve during several months.  Remission of 
disease tended to be long-term. Of 25 individuals treated for more than 18 months (in an open-label 
once they completed the study) only one broke through therapy. When the drug was terminated the 
disease reappeared within 3 to 12 weeks in 80 percent of these patients.   
Mulholland et al. (1990): In this three month study 28% of patients treated evaluated themselves 
at the end of the treatment period as more than slightly improved relative to baseline; compared to 
13% of the patients treated with placebo (p=0.04).   
Parsons et al. (1993): At the end of the three months treatment period 24 of 74 PPS treated 
patients (31%) evaluated themselves as at least 50% overall improved relative to the condition at the 
beginning of the study compared to 12 of 74 patients in the placebo group (16%) (p=0.01).  
Sant et al. (2003): In this study, the main treatment effect of PPS was evaluated by combining data 
from the placebo and hydroxyzine alone arms and comparing those to data from the PPS alone and 
PPS plus hydroxyzine combination arms. A responder analysis based on a patient-reported Global 
Response Assessment (GRA) at 24 weeks was defined as primary endpoint. The study did not enrol the 
planned patient number and the rather high number of drop outs during the study. A trend (p= 
0.064) for better efficacy was observed in those patients treated with PPS (20 of 59, 34%) compared 
to the non-PPS group (11 of 62, 18%). 
Nickel et al. (2015): The primary efficacy results of this study were a responder analysis based on a 
30% improvement in the O’Leary-Sant Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI) at week 24. The 
primary analysis in the reported study was conducted on a last-observation-carried forward (LOCF) 
basis, for those patients who withdrew before completing the 24 weeks.  There was no statistically 
significant difference between the different treatment groups for the primary endpoint pre-specified 
analysis of the ITT data set. The responder rates were 40.7%, 39.8% and 42.6% for the placebo, PPS 
100 mg and PPS 300 mg group, respectively. The percent of responders was similar for PPS naïve and 
non-naive patients across all 3 treatment groups. A post-hoc subgroup analysis of the 94 patients 
meeting the NIDDK criteria revealed a 50%, 30.3% and 34.5% responder rate for the respective 
treatment groups. 
The authors explained that the differences in this study compared to the earlier studies of Mulholland 
et al (1990) and Parsons et al. (1993) are based on (1) differences in the enrolled patient population 
(current study enrolled with milder symptoms, no cut-off criteria for pain or urgency, no determination 
of flare status, no entry criterion based on cystoscopy findings and no exclusion for commonly 
associated conditions such as irritable bowel disease, depression or pelvic floor dysfunction disease) 
and (2) on the commercial availability of PPS, which lead to slow recruitment into the study and to 
early termination; it might have resulted into a different population of patients who agreed to 
participate, including those who were not PPS naïve and who were non-responders to previous PPS 
therapy or potential non-responders based on disease phenotype. 
2) Secondary efficacy analysis  
1) In Holm-Bentzen et al 1987, the effect of treatment in the individual patient was expressed as a 
decrease of 1 or more numerical values in symptom score for pain, dysuria, frequency and nocturia.  
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 68/115 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding  the  other  efficacy  endpoints  (frequency,  nocturia,  pain,  dysuria,  maximal  bladder  capacity 
during  anaesthesia,  petechial  bleeding,  first  sensation  and  bladder  capacity,  mast  cell/mm²  in  the 
biopsies  in  protocol  B,  again  no  significant  difference  was  found  between  the  PPS  and  placebo 
groups. 
However, for protocol A, there was a statically significant increase in bladder capacity (from 260 to 475 
ml)  in  the  patients  treated  with  PPS  compared  to  placebo  (p<  0.05).  The  bladder  capacity  in  the 
placebo  remained  constant.  For  protocol  A,  there  was  a  statistically  significant  decrease  in  the  mast 
cell count during the trial (p< 0.01).  
2) In Parsons and Mulholland 1987, the micturitional profiles’ results are reported in table 21. 
Table  18  Average  number  of  daily  voids  and  bladder  volumes  determined  by  micturitional 
profiles 
The  average  voided  volumes  were  significantly  improved  on  drug  therapy  (p  =  0.009)  but  not  on 
placebo.  The  average  number  of  voids  per  day  was  unchanged  after  drug  or  placebo  therapy.  The 
micturitional  profiles  showed  significant  improvement  in  average  voided  volumes  but  not  in  average 
daily voiding episodes.  
3)  In  Mulholland  et  al  1990,  in  terms  of  reduced  pain,  27%  pf  the  PPS  patients  evaluated 
themselves as improved compared with 14% of the placebo patients (p =0.08). This was confirmed by 
the  pain  scale  data  where  46%  of  the  PPS  patients  and  29%  of  the  placebo  patients  recorded  a 
decrease in pain of 1 or more (p= 0.07). The mean reduction in pain from baseline as measured by the 
pain  scale  was  0.5  for  the  PPS-treated  patients  compared  with  0.2  for  the  placebo  patients  at  three 
months.  This  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  was  not  significantly  but  the  difference  from 
baseline  was  significantly  different  from  zero  (p  =  0.05)  for  the  PPS-treated  group  but  not  for  the 
placebo-treated group. The later held true with p = 0.01 to 0.05 for the end of the months 1 and 2 as 
well.  
Table  19  Efficacy  data  (%  of  patients  improved  in  terms  of  pain,  urgency)  and  overall 
improvement 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 69/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
At  the  three-month  self-evaluation,  22%  of  the  PPS  patients  and  11%  of  the  placebo  patients 
expressed an improvement in pressure to urinate (p = 0.08). This was not confirmed by the urgency 
scale data which revealed a slight margin of 39% to 46% in favour of placebo.  
There was a mean increase in volume per void of 9.8 ml for the PPS-treated patients, and 7.6 ml per 
void  for  placebo  patients.  Among  the  PPS  patients,  30%  had  an  increase  of  20ml  or  more  compared 
with 20% of the placebo patients. The PPS group had a mean increase in total daytime volume of urine 
at  the  endpoint  of  60  ml  compared  with  a  mean  decrease  of  20  ml  for  the  placebo  group.  These 
differences were not statistically significant.  
The  changes  from  baseline  at  the  endpoint  in  the  remaining  parameters  studied  were  not  different 
between treatments. There were voids per day (-1 for both treatments), percent of patients having 3 
less voids per day (32% PPS, 24% placebo), and nocturia (-0.8 PPS, -0.5 placebo).  
4) In Parsons et al 1993, based on a previous experience with controlled clinical trials with IC, the 
voided volume data (which tend to be widely variable between and within patients) were considered to 
be of secondary importance as a measure of efficacy. A voiding volume profile that measured the time 
and quantity of all voids during waking hours as well as the number of voids during sleeping hours 
during 3 consecutive days was completed by the patient before and after 3 months of treatment. This 
profile provided information concerning changes in average voided volume, frequency and nocturia 
during the treatment period.  
There was a mean increase in volume per void of 20.4 ml for the PPS treated patients and a decrease 
of 2.1 ml per void for placebo treated patients (not significant). Among the PPS group, 40% had an 
increase of 20 ml or more compared with 24% of the placebo group (p = 0.02). None of the remaining 
voiding profile data pertaining to frequency or nocturia revealed any significant differences between 
the treatment groups.  
With respect to improved quality of life, the difference between the treatment groups was not 
statistically significant for improvement in sleep but approached significance for sexual intercourse (p 
= 0.06).

5) In Sant et al 2003, Secondary outcome measures included the O’Leary-Sant IC Symptom and 
Problem Index, the University of Wisconsin Symptom score, patient reported symptoms of 
pain/discomfort and urgency, and results of a 24-hour voiding diary. 
At baseline there was a statistically significant difference (p=0.0037) among groups in voiding 
frequency with lower frequencies in the combination therapy. No further differences between the 
groups with regard to baseline characteristics were reported. 
Overall, there were no statistically significant differences between the main treatments in 
symptom changes over time for any of the secondary endpoints. 
An overview of the efficacy results generated is presented in the following table.

Table 21 Efficacy results on all endpoints (all patients treated with PPS versus patients not 
treated with PPS. 
6) In Nickel et al 2015, for secondary efficacy evaluations, the patients enrolled in this study rated 
average pain intensity during the previous 3 days using an 11-point numerical rating scale.  
Furthermore, two other Patient-reported outcome questionnaires were used in this study: 
- The Patient’s Overall Rating of Symptoms Score (PORIS) questionnaire including a total of three 
questions, one for pain, urgency and overall change. The three questions address the overall change in 
IC, pain, and urgency after treatment as worse, no better (0% improvement), slightly improved 
(25%), moderately improved (50%), greatly improved (75%), or symptoms gone (100% 
improvement). 
- The 7-point GRA questionnaire, which was used as the primary endpoint in the study reported by 
Sant et al., 2003. 
Defined secondary efficacy endpoints of the study were: 
- A responder analysis based on a 4-point reduction in the ICSI total score 
- A responder analysis based on a 50% or greater decrease on the PORIS pain, urgency and overall 
change in condition scores.  
- A responder analysis counting those patients who indicated an at least 6 (moderately improved) or 7 
(markedly improved) status on the GRA score. 
Moreover, ICSI total score, pain intensity, patient reported response to GRA question 1 and urinary 
frequency change from baseline were evaluated as secondary endpoints. 
There was no statistically significant difference between groups for any secondary 
endpoints. 
An overview of all efficacy results is presented in the following table 25.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Primary meta-analysis conducted by the applicant 
The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of PPS for the treatment of interstitial 
cystitis (IC) versus placebo by combining the results of available placebo controlled studies.  
Overall, based on the Applicant, all six studies were sufficient comparable to be included into the meta-
analysis. This decision corresponded to the proceeding by Hwang et al., 1997 who included the four 
studies which were available at that time and to the proceeding by Dimitrakov et al., 2007 who 
included all five of the six studies available at that time. As the latest clinical study was just recently 
published by Nickel et al., 2015, none of the two published meta-analyses included this large clinical 
study. 
The meta-analysis included all 6 pivotal studies performed between 1987 and 2015, of which 5 of them 
were carried out between 1987 and 2003. They were relatively small trials, mainly exploratory, except 
the Nickel study which was a true confirmatory trial with a large sample size (targeted 645 subjects, 
actual 368 and 240 retained in the meta-analysis). The primary endpoint of the meta-analysis was the 
responder rate based upon a patient’s global response assessment (GRA), as defined in the individual 
studies when available or calculated afterwards if not directly available in studies. The main analysis 
was performed on the ITT population (all randomized subjects in trials) along with several sensitivity 
analysis, in order to test the robustness of the main results. 
Sensitivity analyses consisted in primary (GRA) and secondary endpoints (pain and urgency) analysis 
carried out in populations with different size: “ITT population” and “As-reported population” (subjects 
taken into account in publications), including all studies or only part of them. 
Table 24 Primary meta-analysis, ITT, global response assessment  
There is no indication of heterogeneity in standard measures: 
Q-value = 4.019 < 5 (=expected value under homogeneity), p=0.547, I²=0. Despite I²=0, the results 
of the Nickel and Holm-Bentzen studies may deviate in reality to some degree from the other studies, 
but this is not discovered because of the high homogeneity of the results of the other 4 studies. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 84/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 25 Primary meta-analysis, as reported, global response assessment 
There is no indication of heterogeneity in standard measures: Q-value = 3.518, p=0.621, I²=0. Benefit 
difference is defined as the estimated difference in responder rates of treatment groups PPS minus 
placebo within each study and overall. 
Different results between the two approaches, ITT and as reported in the publication exist in the two 
studies from 1987 only, because the other 4 studies were already reported according to the ITT 
principle in their study publications. 
Despite the heterogeneous results of the six studies, the estimated benefit differences in overall 
improvement are 12.4% both for the ITT approach and the as reported approach; the related p-
values are p<0.001. The lower limits of the 95%- confidence intervals are 6.4% and 6.3% and thus 
both are > 5.0% indicating a relevant superiority over placebo.  
Co-primary meta-analysis conducted by the applicant 
In order to reflect the prioritisation of efficacy endpoints as intended by the sponsors of the pivotal 
studies, the applicant also conducted a co-primary meta-analysis, evaluating the responder rates 
based on the pre-defined primary endpoints per study. 
The co-primary meta-analysis based on the ITT population estimated a difference in the responder 
rates of 11.9% (p<0.001) (95% IC: 5.8%-18%) between PPS and placebo-treatment. A very small, 
non-significant heterogeneity was detected between the studies (Q=5.098, p=0.404, I²=1.92%). 
When evaluating the “as reported” results instead of the results in the ITT population in the co-primary 
meta-analysis, the difference in responder rates was practically equal (11.9%) (p<0.001) without any 
indication of heterogeneity (Q=4.600, p=0.467, I²=0). 
Sensitivity-analysis conducted by the applicant 
Beyond the main meta-analyses (primary and co-primary), two additional groups of comparative 
meta-analyses were designed and conducted based on the following endpoints: 
- Response in individual symptoms, 
- Mean change in individual and overall symptom scores. 
The patients in the studies reported by Parsons and Mulholland, 1987; Mulholland et al., 1990; Parsons 
et al., 1993 and Sant et al., 2003 all fulfilled the NIDDK criteria for Interstitial Cystitis and met the 
ESSIC categories 2X or 3C. Accordingly, the patient population in those studies represent a more 
homogeneous group than the patients enrolled by Holm-Bentzen et al., 1987 and Nickel et al, 2015. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 85/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Therefore, a sensitivity analysis was conducted including only the 4 studies enrolling this more 
homogeneous patient population expecting a more precise estimation of the treatment effect. 
The higher degree of homogeneity of this sensitivity meta-analysis is reflected by a very small Q value 
of Q=0.470 far away from its expected value of 4-1 = 3. The effect size for this homogeneous patient 
population was greater than the effect size seen in the primary and co-primary meta-analysis and 
showed a statistically significant difference of PPS over placebo (p<0.001) with an estimated difference 
in responder rates of 17.0% with a 95% IC of [9.3%- 24.7%].  
Table 26 Sensitivity analysis, ITT, Global response assessment 
Table 27 Sensitivity analysis, as reported, Global response assessment  
As in the ITT analysis above and as expected, there is no indication of heterogeneity between the 
study results: Q = 0.471, p = 0.925, I² = 0.  
The estimated combined benefit difference is 16.8% with a 95%-confidence interval of [8.9%, 
24.8%].  
As the primary efficacy endpoints in the four studies included in the sensitivity analysis are patient-
reported global response assessments, the sensitivity analysis applies for the primary as well as for the 
co-primary meta-analysis. 
The Applicant provided an additional meta-analysis to support the efficacy of PPS in IC.  
To support the clinical relevance of the benefit differences calculated in the pivotal studies, the 
Applicant provided a further meta-analysis combining the responder rates of the different endpoints 
separately. In this meta-analysis, only GRA, pain and urgency evaluation were performed. The results 
of this meta-analysis are provided below separately for all six pivotal studies and for the four pivotal 
studies which used a traditional diagnostic approach.  
Assessment report

For all six pivotal studies, the results for PPS are around 33% and 20% for placebo with an overlap in 
IC 95% for pain.  
In the meta-analysis including only the 4 pivotal studies with traditional diagnostic approach, the 
results for PPS are around 31% and 15 % for placebo with no overlap in IC 95%. Based on the 
Applicant, the high placebo response rates of 15-20% were expected in a disease like IC as condition 
like depression, functional disorders and pain are known to be associated with high placebo-rates in 
randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies.

The  applicant  provided  a  further  meta-analysis  which  took  into  consideration  the  results  of  the  post 
Hoc analysis of Nickel et al study in the subgroup of patients with IC (2X to 3C according to the ESSIC 
classification).  Compared  to  the  sensitivity  analysis  including  only  the  four  pivotal  studies,  which 
included the pre-defined homogeneous patient population of patients falling within ESSIC classification 
2X  to  3C,  the  estimated  benefit  difference  in  success  rates  has  decreased  from  17.0%  to  13.3% 
where this smaller difference is still statistically significant (p=0.007).

Table 30 Meta-analysis: incl Nickel et al subgroup ITT. Global response assessment (ICSI for 
Nickel et al 2015) 
Supportive meta-analysis conducted by the applicant evaluating the main symptoms of IC 
In order to provide more objective information on the efficacy of PPS, the pivotal clinical studies were 
also evaluated with regard to the information provided on the main symptoms pain and urgency. 
Effects on symptom scores for pain and urgency are reported in the publications from Parsons and 
Mulholland, 1987; Mulholland et al., 1990; Parsons et al., 1993 and Nickel et al., 2015. The publication 
from Holm-Bentzen et al., 1987 reported effects on pain, but not on urgency. The publication from 
Sant et al., 2003 reported no responder rates on different symptoms, but just overall scores and their 
mean changes from baseline.  
The supportive meta-analyses mainly used the reported effect size on the symptoms pain and urgency 
and calculated the effects sizes on the ITT population as main outcome. 
The Holm-Bentzen et al., 1987 study could not be included in the meta-analysis because there are no 
response data available for Urgency but there are good data for Frequency. Therefore, this study was 
excluded in meta-analysis of symptom urgency. Likewise, the study of Sant at 2003 was excluded, as 
rates of improvement in urgency were not available for this study. However, meta-analysis were 
performed in including available data of frequency instead of urgency for the Holm-Bentzen et al 1987 
study and urgency success rates for the Sant et al 2003 from the overall improvement result of the 
study with a method of data extraction.  
Statistically significant benefit differences of 12.1% (ITT approach, Sant et al 2003 excluded) (IC 95% 
[0.03-0.211], p =0.009) and 9.9% (ITT approach, Holm-Bentzen et al 1987 and Sant et al excluded 
2003) (IC 95% [0.029-0.168], p = 0.005) were reached for an improvement of pain and urgency 
evaluated respectively  in the supportive meta-analyses.

Imputation of results for the studies Sant et al., 2003 and Holm-Bentzen et al., 1987 lead to a benefit 
difference of 12.3% for the ITT (IC 95% [0.049-0.198], p = 0.001]) and “as reported” (IC 95% 
[0.044-0.203], p = 0.002]) approach for pain and 10.3% (ITT approach)(IC 95%[0.044-0.162], p = 
0.001) or 10.3% (as reported approach) (IC 95% [0.04-0.0165], p = 0.001) for urgency.  
The sensitivity analyses including only the four studies (without Holm-Bentzen et al 1987 and Nickel et 
al 2015) with a better defined patient population revealed a benefit difference of 17.6% for pain (IC 
95% [0.1-0.251], p = 0) and 13.0% for urgency (IC 95% [0.057-0.202], p = 0).  
Supportive studies 
Nine supportive studies were provided by the applicant, most of them were open-label and 
uncontrolled or retrospective studies with a small number of patients and published between 1983 and 
2000. Only 4 were more recent and published from 2005 and 2008.  
Among these 9 studies, 2 long-term studies “Hanno et al 1997”study in 2809 patients from 1986 to 
1996 and “Jepsen et al 1998” study in 97 patients from 1987 to 1995, showed that improvement 
increased with duration of treatment in patients treated with PPS (100 mgX3/ day). However, it should 
be noted that PPS could be curative for some patients and that patients receiving treatment for a 
duration > 90 months showed no further improvement or worsening in symptom values 
(“tachyphylaxis”).  
One randomized, double-blind dose-ranging study was performed by Nickel et al 2005 to evaluate 
three different doses of PPS (100 mg x3/ day, 200 mg x3/ day, 300 mg x3/day) for 32 weeks in 380 
patients. No statistical difference was found among the 3 doses regarding ICSI scores and PORIS 
scores. Therefore, response to treatment was not dose-dependent. However, when patients were 
categorized by the severity of their symptoms at baseline according to the ICSI, the response in those 
with mild and moderate symptoms were not dose dependent but in patients with severe symptoms at 
baseline, a better response to the 600 mg dose was observed (p = 0.028). 
Another randomized double-blind clinical trial was performed by Davis et al 2008 to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of intravesical PPS administration on top of oral PPS treatment in 41 women.  The 
use of the association of intravesical PPS and oral PPS appears to enhance the proliferation of the GAG 
layer of the bladder, to produce greater relief and return to normal protective coating when maintained 
with oral PPS.   
An open-label study was performed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of subcutaneous low dose 
heparin application on top of oral PPS application in 41 patients (Van Ophoven et al 2005). The 
results show that the subgroup of patients with initially less favourable PPS treatment outcome (minor 
group) predominantly benefited from additional administration of subcutaneous heparin due mainly to 
the significant reduction of pain intensity.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
All the six pivotal studies were placebo controlled double-blind, multicentre studies, of which the 
objectives were to assess the superiority of PPS versus placebo (except Sant et al 2003 which 
evaluated the superiority of PPS versus placebo and hydroxyzine). All but one of 6 pivotal studies 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 89/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
conducted more than 10 years ago (except and Nickel et al. (2015) study) were small studies and used 
old methodological standard. The Nickel study was a true confirmatory trial with a large sample size 
(targeted 645 subjects, actual 368 and 240 retained in the meta-analysis). 
The conduct of the pivotal studies met recruitment difficulties especially in the more recent studies 
(Sant et al 2003 and Nickel et al 2015). Indeed, these latter studies were performed in USA and 
Canada when PPS was already commercially available which lead to recruitment of non-naïve PPS 
patients or patients with a less severe disease (milder symptoms) than in the 4 earlier studies. In the 
Nickel et al study, there were no cut-off criteria for pain or urgency, no determination of flare status, 
no entry criterion based on cystoscopy findings and no exclusion for commonly associated conditions 
such as irritable bowel disease, depression or pelvic floor dysfunction disease. Moreover, this study 
was stopped for futility as continuing the study until its planned sample size would not have 
significantly increased the chance of a successful trial.  
On the other hand it seems that the 3 earlier studies (Parsons and Mulholland 1987, Mulholland et al 
1990 and Parsons et al 1993) were recruiting (a) without clear hypothesis tested and (b) without clear 
management of selection biases as these studies were performed with old methodological 
requirements. 
Sample sizes to test certain hypothesis were calculated only for three of the six pivotal studies: in 
Holm-Bentzen et al 1987 study (40 patients per group), Sant et al 2003 study (136 patients per 
group), and Nickel et al 2015 study (target 645 patients would yield 600 (200 per treatment arm).  No 
sample sizes were defined prospectively for Parsons and Mulholland 1987 study, Mulholland et al 1990 
study, and Parsons et al 1993 study. This is a weakness of this literature based application. 
The population included in the pivotal studies differs between the studies. The population was included 
with different IC definitions, mixing both broad IC/BPS (i.e. In European Holm-Bentzen et al. 1987 
Study and in Canadian/US Nickel et al 2015 Study) definitions meeting the ESSIC classification 2X and 
3C (i.e. in US Parsons and Mulholland 1987 Study, Mulholland et al 1990 Study, Parsons et al 1993 
Study, and in Sant et al 2003 Study) but it is agreed that the broader population (IC/BPS) includes IC 
(2X to 3C) disease as BPS is a very broad symptom complex including also patient with milder severity 
than IC. “Pain” was considered as the key main symptom of the interstitial cystitis.  
Considering  the  fact  that  no  outcome  measure  is  currently  standardized  the  patient’s  global 
assessment  or  any  impact  of  the  IC  disease  are  considered  as  the  most  relevant  outcome  measures.  
According to the guidelines on chronic pelvic pain (Engeler 2015), symptom scores, evaluated with the 
O’Leary-Sant Symptom Index also known as the Interstitial Cystitis Symptom Index (ICSI), may help 
to  assess  the  patient  and  act  as  outcome  measures.  However,  this  is  a  subjective  assessment,  other 
more objective criteria could have been taken into consideration such as increase of working or waking 
hours, return to work or school or increase of physical or sexual activities.  
Given  the  heterogeneous  population  of  the  six  pivotal  studies,  the  applicant  proposed  to  restrict  the 
indication  to  patients  diagnosed  with  IC  using  the  traditional  approach  including  cystoscopy  with  or 
without  hydrodistension  corresponding  to  the  IC  criteria  established  by  the  National  Institute  of 
diabetes  and  digestive  and  kidney  diseases  (NIDDK)  (Cases  meeting  the  ESSIC  classification  2X  and 
3C  would  meet  the  NIDDK  criteria  for  IC).  These  IC  patients  were  included  in  four  pivotal  studies 
(Parsons  and  Mulholland  1987,  Mulholland  et  al  1990,  Parsons  et  al  1993  and  Sant  et  al  2003),  of 
whom 3 met the primary endpoints (Parsons and Mulholland 1987, Mulholland et al 1990, Parsons et al 
1993).  
Indeed, several associations such as International Society for the Study of bladder painful symptom 
(ESSIC), American urology association (AUA), and European association of Urology (EAU) recommend 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 90/115 
 
 
 
 
 
to use preferentially “bladder pain syndrome” or “painful bladder syndrome” (PBS) instead of 
interstitial cystitis (IC). Therefore the CHMP considered that the indication should refer to BPS with 
glomerulations / Hunner’s lesions to outline the population in which efficacy was significantly 
demonstrated in the pivotal trials (formerly described as IC).  
Regarding the study outcomes/endpoints, the key study endpoints/outcomes in all 6 pivotal studies 
were patient-reported outcomes via patient responder analysis. This might be considered as a 
reasonable approach for this type of disease. The responder definitions based on 6-point or 7-point 
GRA assessment used for primary efficacy evaluation in three pivotal studies are quite identical 
(Mulholland et al., 1990; Parsons et al., 1993, Sant et al., 2003) and the responder definition based on 
ICSI scores used for primary efficacy evaluation in the latest study (Nickel et al., 2015) was shown to 
correlate with the GRA-responders. Although no global response assessment was conducted in the 
study reported by Parsons and Mulholland, 1987, the data imputation used for the meta-analysis 
conducted by the applicant is deemed sufficiently comparable. For the responder analysis used in the 
study reported by Holm-Bentzen et al, 1987 comparability with the other responder definitions could 
not be demonstrated.  
If only the four pivotal studies are considered which enrolled a homogeneous and clear defined patient 
population representative for the targeted patient population (Parsons and Mulholland, 1987, 
Mulholland et al., 1990; Parsons et al., 1993, Sant et al., 2003), the responder analysis are deemed 
comparable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
  Results on primary endpoints 
The six pivotal randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies were identified as pivotal database 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PPS. Only 3 of them met the primary endpoints “overall global 
improvement” (assessed by a self-evaluation confirmed by an investigator’s evaluation) in comparison 
to placebo (Parsons and Mulholland, 1987; Mulholland et al., 1990; Parsons et al., 1993).  
Indeed, the first study (Holm-Bentzen 1987) failed to detect a statistically significant difference in the 
mean total symptom score change, but showed a trend of higher responder rates (patients 
experiencing a clinically relevant improvement of at least 1.00 in the mean total symptom score) after 
four months of treatment with PPS compared to placebo. Likewise, the study reported by Sant et al 
2003 did not show a significant benefit versus non-PPS treatment (placebo and hydroxyzine), only a 
trend. The last study Nickel et al 2015, which was performed by the current clinical standards and an 
up-to-date methodology failed to show any benefit in comparison to placebo and no statistically 
difference was reached between the 300 mg of PPS per day in comparison to 100 mg of PPS per day. 
These latter two studies were performed in countries where PPS was already available which lead to 
recruitment issues and to inclusion of non PPS naïve patients or non-responders to previous PPS 
therapy or patients with milder symptoms as patients with severe symptoms could have a direct 
access to the treatment.   
The beneficial effect of PPS in interstitial cystitis (IC) was only shown in the 3 pivotal studies which 
used traditional diagnostic approach (Parsons and Mulholland, 1987; Mulholland et al., 1990; Parsons 
et al., 1993) but not in Sant et al., 2003 study and the studies using less specific IC definition (IC/BPS) 
as it was in the Holm-Bentzen et al., 1987 study and in the most recent Nickel et al., 2015 study. The 
response rate of a subgroup of patients with IC (2X to 3C) included in a post-HOC analysis in Nickel et 
al study were better for placebo (50%) than PPS 100 mg/day (30.3%), 100 mg x3/ day (34.5%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 91/115 
 
 
 
 
 
However, interpretation of the data from the Nickel study is difficult given the severe limitations with 
regards to difficulties in patient enrolment, early termination, study design, enrolment of patients 
previously treated with PPS, severe recruitment problems and high dropout rates used for the analysis 
of efficacy.  
Regarding the most pronounced and unexpected outcome of the post-hoc subgroup analysis reported 
by Nickel et al., 2015 the response rate of 50% in the placebo subgroup based on a 30% ICSI score 
improvement, such high placebo response rate was not observed in any other pivotal study and has to 
be taken as a clear indication for the multifactorial biases impacting the study results (patients with 
milder IC entering during a symptom flare, regression to the mean, introduction (inadvertent or not) of 
conservative therapy, which accentuated the benefits of placebo, and failure of clinical sites to keep 
patients in the trial). It should be noted that a high placebo response rate was also observed in the 
whole study: 40.7% (versus 39.8% for patients treated with 100 mgX1/day and 42.6% in those 
treated with 100mgX3/day) at 24 weeks.  
To  justify  the  abnormal  high  placebo  response  rate,  the  applicant  provided  the  results  of  2  other 
placebo-controlled studies performed in patients with IC (2X to 3C) diagnosed with cystoscopy and the 
response rates of the patients treated with placebo are about 12% (Warren et al., 2000) and 16% (van 
Ophoven  et  al.,  2004)  which  correspond  to  the  placebo  response  rates  of  the  other  pivotal  studies 
(12.5-17.7%).  Therefore,  it  can  be  concluded  that  the  severe  limitations  of  the  study  published  by 
Nickel  and  colleagues  in  2015,  could  have  impacted  the  validity  and  usability  of  the  study  results 
overall.  
Given  the  severe  limitations  of  the  Nickel  et  al  study,  it  is  agreed  that  its  results  could  not  be  taken 
into account for meta-analysis. In addition, the results of Holm-Bentzen study are difficult to interpret 
as the GRA was not used as primary endpoint.  
  Results of the meta-analysis 
Several meta-analysis were performed by the applicant – primary endpoints meta-analysis (based on 
GRA improvement, both for ITT and non-ITT principles), sensitivity analysis (based on more 
homogenous patient population of four studies) and co-primary meta-analysis (evaluating the 
responder rates based on the pre-defined primary endpoints per study). Statistical methods for meta-
analysis were used properly. However, the presentation was not fully consistent. Consideration of 
missing results as failures is adequate. In general, statistical methods used for meta-analysis were 
appropriate. The applicant provided the number of patients and the responder rates in the forest plot. 
These data confirm that responder rates were adequately estimated in ITT populations as defined in 
the meta-analysis without any loss of patients. Responses for pooled PPS and pooled placebo groups 
are missing but it seems that this information is available in the material provided for the additional 
meta-analysis conducted by the Applicant. The applicant provided the response levels for pooled PPS 
and pooled placebo in the meta-analysis. 
In the primary meta-analysis conducted by the applicant, the estimated benefit differences in overall 
improvement are 12.4% both for the ITT approach and the as reported approach. This primary meta-
analysis included all 6 studies performed between 1987 and 2015. The clinical benefit estimate 
increased to 17% in the sensitivity analysis when excluding the 2 pivotal studies (Holm-Bentzen and 
Nickel studies) which presented the lowest response rates and included a less homogeneous population 
than in the four other pivotal studies (mixing both broad IC/BPS).   
These benefit differences mainly driven by the two pivotal studies Parsons et al 1993 and Mulholland et 
al 1990 for the drug approval of Elmiron in the US and by an earlier study (Parsons and Mulholland 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 92/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1987) which met their primary endpoints seem relatively low and the studies were performed with old 
methodological standard requirements and with a low number of patients.  Furthermore the most 
recent study (Nickel et al 2015) with up-to-date methodology provided un-conclusive results (and 
negative results in the subgroup of patients meeting the NIDDK criteria). 
Thus, the applicant provided a new meta-analysis which took into account the results of the post Hoc 
analysis  of  the  Nickel  et  al  study  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  IC  (2X  to  3C).  Compared  to  the 
sensitivity  analysis  including  only  the  four  pivotal  studies,  which  included  the  pre-defined 
homogeneous  patient  population  of  IC  patients  characterized  by  either  glomerulations  or  Hunner’s 
lesions,  the  estimated  benefit  difference  in  success  rates  decreased  from  17.0%  to  13.3%  where 
this smaller difference is still statistically significant (p=0.007). 
The CHMP took into consideration the unmet medical need for pharmacotherapy in this disease which 
can be invalidating in its severe forms and the ad hoc expert group confirmed that also small 
improvement could be considered as a clinical relevant benefit. 
Furthermore  given  the  severe  limitations  of  the  Nickel  et  al  study  (patients  with  milder  IC  entering 
during  a  symptom  flare,  regression  to  the  mean,  introduction  (inadvertent  or  not)  of  conservative 
therapy, which accentuated the benefits of placebo, and failure of clinical sites to keep patients in the 
trial), CHMP considered that its results should not be taken into account in the meta-analysis.  
Overall, the meta-analysis which combined the response rates of the four pivotal studies with patients 
meeting  the  ESSIC  classification  2X  to  3C  which  showed  a  benefit  difference  of  17%  (PPS  versus 
placebo), was taken into consideration to demonstrate the efficacy of PPS in the approved indication. 
  Key secondary endpoints 
The secondary endpoints were only considered supportive but pain and urgency were considered as 
the key main symptoms.  
Overall, based on the results of 3 pivotal studies (Parsons and Mulholland 1987, Mulholland et al 1990 
and Parsons et al 1993) an effect on pain (~44 vs 15 to 18%), urgency (~50 vs ~20%) and 
frequency (~60 vs 40%) but not on alleviating nocturia was shown. This was not the case in Sant et 
al., 2003 study and the studies using less specific IC definitions (IC/BPS) (Holm-Bentzen et al., 1987 
and Nickel et al., 2015 studies). 
The supportive meta-analysis conducted by the applicant mainly used the reported effect size on the 
symptoms pain and urgency and calculated the effects sizes on the ITT population as main outcome. 
Regarding these symptoms, this supportive meta-analysis reached statistically significant benefit 
differences in line with the primary meta-analysis evaluating the global response assessment (GRA) 
whatever the approach (ITT or as reported or sensitivity analysis).   
  Dose finding 
The majority of patients in the pivotal studies as well as in the supportive studies were treated with the 
established dose of 3x100 mg PPS per day and few patients received a very comparable dose of 2x200 
mg PPS per day. The treatment duration was ranging from 3 months to 6 months. 
Two dose-ranging studies evaluated a potential dose-response relationship (Nickel et al., 2005, Nickel 
et al., 2015) and came to the conclusion that neither a reduction of the dose to one third (1x100 mg 
PPS per day) nor a duplication or triplication of the dose (3x200 mg or 3x300 mg PPS per day) leads to 
statistically significant differences in the efficacy. It is agreed by the CHMP that the dose regimen 
should be 100 mgx3/ day as applied in the pivotal trials.

Additional expert consultation 
At day 180 of the procedure the efficacy of elmiron was considered not being sufficiently demonstrated 
despite its well established use and international and European guidelines recommending pentosane 
polysulfate sodium for the treatment of IC for more than 10 years. 
Therefore the CHMP decided to consult clinical experts in the disease adopting the following questions 
(Responses given by the ad hoc expert group are also outlined below): 
1) Please discuss the definition (s) of IC / pain bladder syndrome and what is known about 
the  etiology  and  pathogenesis  of  this  condition.  Which  are  the  available  treatment 
alternatives? Is there an unmet medical need for new treatments? 
Chronic  pelvic  pain  can  have  multiple  reasons  which  may  be  deriving  from  within  the  bladder  (e.g. 
chronic  inflammation  of  the  bladder  region,  characterized  by  Hunner’s  lesions  /  Glomerulations)  or 
from outside the bladder (e.g. pudendus neuralgia); BPS is a diagnosis of exclusion. For the definition 
of  BPS  (and  former  IC)  the  experts  referred  to  the  ESSIC  classification  (Engeler  et  al  2015).  It  was 
considered that the IC definition at the time when most of the pivotal studies were performed would, 
as per todays classification, fall under BPS type 2 – 3.  
Considering  today’s  classification  and  medical  practice  an  indication  today  would  therefore  need  to 
refer to BPS. 
The experts further emphasized that a categorization reflecting current clinical practice would refer to 
symptomatic  severity  and  modern  clinical  trials  would  be  designed  to  measure  patient  related 
outcomes.  It  was  noted  that  particular  intravesical  changes  such  as  Glomerulations  and  Hunner’s 
lesions are not correlating with clinical severity of this condition. 
The  medical  need  for  effective  treatments  in  this  condition  was  clearly  seen  by  the  experts.  Current 
oral  pharmacological  treatment  options  are  second  line  (after  behavioral  modifications  and  stress 
management)  and  comprise  amitryptilin,  cimetidine,  hydroxyzine  and  PPS,  PPS  having  a  particularly 
benign safety profile. All treatment to date is symptomatic and none of above treatments is authorized 
in the EU in this condition. 
2)  Considering  the  results  of  the  four  pivotal  studies,  the  results  of  Holm-Bentzen  et  al. 
(1987)  and  Nickel  et  al.  (2015)  studies  and  the  European  and  international  treatment 
guidelines of this condition, do you think that the available data support that PPS (Pentosan 
Polysulfate Sodium) has a place in the treatment of interstitial cystitis (IC)?  
There  was  consensus  about  the  weak  evidence  on  efficacy  of  PPS  deriving  from  the  older  studies 
showing  a  limited  treatment  effect.  With  regards  to  the  more  recent  Nickel  at  al.  (2015)  study  some 
experts were concerned about the efficacy results and would not use PPS as monotherapy, others were 
rather content to view results of this study as an outlier in terms of efficacy. 
There  was  no  consensus  about  the  use  of  PPS  in  the  patient  population  to  be  treated  in  clinical 
practice.  Some  experts  would,  depending  on  the  patients  risk  profile,  consider  PPS  due  to  its  benign 
safety profile as a treatment option before invasive diagnostics. Other experts would use the drug due 
to the low level of evidence on efficacy and BPS being a diagnosis of exclusion only after full diagnostic 
workup to exclude confusable diseases and preferably in combination therapy. 
The  experts  broadly  agreed  that  study  results  from  a  population  of  BPS  2-3,  a  population  difficult  to 
treat, would be generalizable to patients suffering from other BPS categories. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 94/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
There  was  broad  agreement  that  more  contemporary  data  on  efficacy  would  be  welcome  to  better 
define the use of the drug in today’s clinical medicine. 
3) Given the response rates in the subgroup “classical IC” in the Nickel et al study, do you 
consider the benefit difference 17% response rate (PPS versus placebo) based on a meta-
analysis which combined the responses rates from the four pivotal studies with patients 
with “classical IC”) as clinically relevant? 
The  experts  considered  that  any  response  rate  superior  to  placebo  could  be  clinically  relevant 
considering that there is no drug treatment authorized in this condition. The methodological weakness 
of the older trials was perceived as caveat for reliable interpretation of the efficacy of the product and 
the  meta-analyses  were  considered  of  limited  value  due  to  different  trial  designs  throughout 
publications. With regards to the Nickel study it was noted that many patients discontinued the trial. A 
reason  for  this  could  be  the  need  for  more  effective  pain  treatment.  The  patient  representatives 
emphasized  that  more  robust  data  generation  and  definition  of  the  patient  population  which  benefits 
most from the drug would be welcome to spare the patient to try unsuccessful treatments but also the 
burden  of  invasive  diagnostics  was  acknowledged.  Also  the  high  fluctuation  and  subjectivity  of 
symptoms was acknowledged by the experts as a caveat for designing a trial in this condition.  
4)  If  you  find  the  available  data  supportive,  which  type  of  IC  patients,  taking  into 
consideration the ICSI score or other criteria, would benefit from treatment with PPS? 
In  Europe  PPS  is  often  used  off  label  and  on  a  named  patient  basis.  Whereas  the  French  and  the 
Belgian  experts  tended  to  prescribe  PPS  without  full  invasive  diagnostic  workup  depending  on  the 
patients profile, experts from UK and Germany would use it after full exclusion of confusable diseases 
and  mostly  in  combination  therapy.  A  re-evaluation  of  the  patient’s  response  after  6  months  of 
treatment would allow minimizing the risk of exposing patients who do not respond in the long term. 
In  summary  the  data  of  the  pivotal  studies  suggest  to  use  PPS  in  patients  suffering  from  BPS  with 
verified  cystoscopic  findings  including  hydrodistention  and  some  experts  emphasized  that  cystoscopy 
including  hydrodistension  is  needed  to  display  all  glomerulations  /  Hunner’s  lesions  and,  at  symptom 
persistence sooner or later cystoscopy would need to be done to finalize the diagnostic workup for this 
indication. Also hydrodistension (usually under general anesthesia) could induce symptom amelioration 
in some patients. 
However experts also stressed the high burden of this workup for both the patient and the healthcare 
system  cystoscopy  being  extremely  painful  and  sometimes  not  useful  in  symptomatic  patients. 
Cystoscopic  findings  for  a  decision  to  initiate  PPS  were  considered  of  limited  value  in  particular  in 
symptomatic  patients  with  low  risk  of  important  confusable  diseases,  such  as  bladder  stones  and 
cancer (e.g. in young women). 
In  particular  the  experts  emphasized  that  there  is  no  reason  to  believe  that  PPS  is  not  effective  in 
patients  without  glomerulations  /  Hunner’s  lesions  as  these  morphological  changes  do  not  correlate 
with  symptom  severity.  A  restriction  of  the  indication  would  also  hardly  be  respected  by  clinicians 
considering  the  much  broader  well-established  use  of  the  product.  Experts  therefore  were  not  in 
agreement  to  refer  to  these  changes  within  a  BPS  indication.  An  indication  statement  adapted  to 
clinical practice would rather refer to the severity of the condition. 
5)  Please  discuss  the  most  appropriate  name  of  the  condition  and  exactly  which  patients 
would  be  included  in  this  condition.  In  particular  the  use  of  the  terms  bladder  pain 
syndrome  and  interstitial  cystitis  should  be  explained  as  this  will  assist  the  COMP  in 
understanding how the condition is currently defined by the medical profession.  
In  line  with  the  answer  to  CHMP  question  1,  the  expert group  considered  the  term interstitial  cystitis 
(IC) to be outdated and according to today’s classification and medical practice the condition should be 
referred to as BPS. The experts concluded that IC correlates to a patient population with BPS type 2 – 
3 and in particular 3C (characterised by Hunner’s lesions); these BPS subtypes are, according to ESSIC 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 95/115 
 
 
 
 
 
classification  to  be  verified  by  cystoscopy  including  hydrodistension.  IC  represents  therefore  a 
subcategory of the condition BPS. 
6) The prevalence in the literature is reported to have a range between 0.6% and 3% of the 
population when the term bladder pain syndrome is used. This is a very broad range, and is 
at variance with the prevalence proposed by the applicant, who is using the strict definition 
of  interstitial  cystitis  and  concludes  on  a  number  of  1.8  in  10,000  in  Europe.  The  COMP 
would like to ask the expert  group to consider which prevalence value is closer to the real 
situation in Europe for the condition as defined in question 1. 
The experts agreed that if BPS is used the prevalence would be higher than what has been suggested 
by the sponsor. There were some concerns about the publications overestimating the incidence of BPS 
as they were based on questionnaires which only recorded the symptoms over one month. The experts 
were  of  the  opinion  that  patients  with  BPS  type  2  and  3  are  not  common.  This  was  supported  by  a 
recent  publication  from  2015  (T.Bschleipfer  et  al.  Interstitielle  Zystitis/Blasenschmerzsyndrom, 
Urologische  Infektiologie,  2015,  265-276)  which  considered  that  based  on  current  literature  the 
prevalence of BPS is 52-500 / 100.000 in women and 8-41 / 100.000 in men. Considering that about 
10% of BPS patients have cystoscopic findings IC as defined as BPS type 2 and could still be under the 
threshold of 5 in 10,000. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The  applicant  provided  six  pivotal  studies  to  support  this  application.  Only  3  pivotal  randomized 
double-blind  multicentre  placebo  controlled  studies  (Parsons  and  Mulholland  1987,  Mulholland  et  al 
1990 and Parsons et al 1993) among the 6 pivotal studies met their primary endpoint “GRA” and some 
secondary endpoints such as pain.  
Based  on  the  primary  meta-analysis  conducted  by  the  applicant  including  the  six  pivotal  studies,  the 
estimated  benefit  differences  reached  about  13%  (ITT  and  as  reported).  This  benefit  difference  (PPS 
versus placebo) reached 17% when excluding 2 pivotal studies (Holm-Bentzen et al 1987 and Nickel et 
al 2015) with the lowest response rates and with a population less homogeneous than in the four other 
clinical  studies  (mixing  both  broad  IC/BPS).  Indeed,  this  benefit  difference  was  mainly  driven  by  the 
statistically significant results of the three pivotal studies Parsons et al 1993, Mulholland et al 1990 and 
Parsons and Mulholland 1987 including patients falling within ESSIC classification 2X to 3C.  
Given the heterogeneity of the population included in Holm-Bentzen et al 1987 and Nickel et al and the 
clear  efficacy  results  when  pooling  the  remaining  four  pivotal  studies  including  patients  diagnosed  IC 
falling within the ESSIC (BPS) classification 2X to 3C, it was agreed to refer in the indication to patients 
diagnosed IC / BPS using the traditional approach including cystoscopy with or without hydrodistension 
showing either glomerulations or Hunner’s lesions. 
Furthermore according to the meta-analysis of the four pivotal studies performed in patients meeting 
the ESSIC classification 2X to 3C the pooled response rate under PPS treatment was 2-fold higher than 
the  pooled  response  rate  under  placebo  (“GRA”  primary  endpoint  and  also  pain  and  urgency)and 
efficacy of PPS was considered sufficiently demonstrated in this population.    
The term BPS rather than interstitial cystitis (IC) was put forward by the International Society for the 
Study  of  BPS  (ESSIC)  and  is  currently  used  in  the  guidelines  and  by  the  experts.  Therefore  the 
applicant agreed to amend the applied therapeutic indication to: 
"Elmiron  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  bladder  pain  syndrome  characterized  by  either 
glomerulations  or  Hunner’s  lesions  in  adults  with  moderate  to  severe  pain,  urgency  and  frequency  of 
micturition (see section 4.4)" 
Assessment report

Page 96/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The  safety  of  elmiron  capsules  was  evaluated  from  scientific  publications  on  six  pivotal,  placebo-
controlled clinical studies as well as in supportive active-controlled or uncontrolled studies. No clinical 
safety  studies  with  elmiron  were  performed  by  the  applicant,  in  accordance  with  Article  10a  of 
Directive 2001/83/EC (well-established medical use).  
Patient exposure 
561 patients were exposed to PPS in the six pivotal, placebo-controlled trials (Holm-Bentzen 1987; 
Parsons and Mulholland 1987; Mulholland 1990; Parsons 1993, Sant 2003 and Nickel 2015). 3407 
patients were exposed to PPS in supportive active-controlled or uncontrolled studies (Nickel 2005; 
Ophoven 2005; Davis 2008; Sairanen 2005; Fritjofsson 1987 and Hanno 1997). 124 patients were 
exposed to PPS in two cohort studies (Waters 2000 and Jepsen 1998).  
192 patients were exposed to PPS at least 6 months (corresponds to 1152 patient-months) in the 
(pivotal) clinical trials. Most patients were exposed to 300 mg PPS per day (234 patients), some were 
exposed to 400 mg PPS per day (52 patients).  
429 female patients and 29 male patients were exposed to PPS in the (pivotal) clinical trials. 
Overall, more than 3,500 patients were exposed to PPS in published clinical studies evaluating the 
safety and efficacy of PPS for the treatment of IC. In these studies, subjects mainly administered the 
established oral dose of 3x100 mg PPD per day, but also the threefold dose (3x300 mg PPS per day) 
was evaluated. The exposure in the studies covered periods of more than 3 years treatment with PPS.  
Adverse events 
Holm-Bentzen et al. (1987) reported that 5 patients receiving active drug complained of peripheral 
oedema. One patient had a skin rash that probably was related to PPS treatment. The applicant 
assumed that the same case of skin rash is mentioned twice in this publication. Among the 62 patients, 
who completed the study reported by Parsons and Mulholland (1987) only one single side effect (skin 
rash) was reported.  
In the study published by Fritjofsson et al. (1987), diarrhoea was reported in 6 patients and one 
patient complained of dyspepsia during treatment. Swelling of legs occurred in 2 patients. 
Mulholland et al. (1990) and Parsons et al. (1993) described the occurrence of adverse reactions in the 
safety sections. The Applicant explained that the incidence of adverse reactions observed in both 
studies were low in both treatment groups and the observed effects are not different from effects 
expected to occur in any random population over a three-month period. In Parsons et al. (1993) study, 
only digestive system events, diarrhoea or nausea were reported from more than one patient and 
occurred more often in the placebo group than in the PPS group.  
Diarrhoea is reported with a frequency of 4.9% in the Nickel study (2015), 15% in the Waters study 
(2000) and in the Nickel study (2005) and 2.7% in the Parsons study. Nausea is reported with a 
frequency of 9.8% in the Nickel study (2015), 8% in the Nickel study (2005), 2% in the Mulholland 
study and 3.7% in the Hanno study. Abdominal pain is reported with a frequency of 7% in the Nickel 
study (2005). Dyspepsia is reported with a frequency of 2 to 4% depending on the study.  
Alopecia, cited as reversible, is reported with a frequency of 3.9% in the Hanno study and 5% in the 
Nickel study (2015). Hair-thinning/hair loss is reported with a frequency of 11% in the Waters study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 97/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hair-thinning/alopecia are known adverse reactions associated with heparin treatment and it is thus 
not surprising to have these AEs described with PPS. Headache is reported with a frequency of 11.5% 
in the Nickel study (2015), 2.9% in the Hanno study and 2% in the Mulholland study. Rectal bleeding 
is reported with a frequency of 4 % in the Nickel study (2005). Bleeding events as rectal bleeding are 
related to the heparin-like structure of PPS.  
Overall, hair-thinning/hair loss/alopecia and gastro-intestinal disorders (e.g. diarrhea, abdominal 
cramping, nausea and dyspepsia) were the most frequently reported adverse reactions with PPS in the 
literature.  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
No  treatment-related  SAEs  were  reported  in  the  clinical  studies  with  PPS  capsules.  PPS  is  a  highly 
sulfated  glycosaminoglycan  comparable  to  heparin  and  systemically  available  PPS  has  relevant 
anticoagulant activity. Some cases of thrombocytopenia occurring during parenteral PPS treatment and 
mimicking  the  heparin-induced  thrombocytopenia  syndrome  have  been  reported,  especially  in  the 
French  literature  (Tardy-Poncet  et  al.,  1994),  thus  any  potential  effects  of  oral  PPS  treatment  on  the 
coagulation system would be considered as an AE of special interest. The case of a 28-year old patient 
with  Interstitial  Cystitis  was  reported  by  Strohmaier  et  al.  (1987)  in  the  context  of  the  evaluation  of 
glycosaminoglycan  excretion.  This  patient  received  750  mg/day  PPS  in  order  to  increase  the 
glycosaminoglycan  excretion,  which  was  reduced  based  on  his  underlying  disease.  The  patient 
developed haematomas spontaneously and macrohaematuria. No further information is provided. 
Given  the  weak  anticoagulant  effect  of  PPS,  PPS  could  have  favored  the  apparition  of  haematoma  in 
two published cases of serious AEs:  
-  An epidural hematoma reported in a woman receiving lumbar epidural steroid injection (Siddiqui 
et al.2001). In addition to PPS, the woman was treated with 300 mg gabapentin three times a day 
and  25  mg  amitriptyline  orally  at  night.  The  authors  concluded,  that  this  patient's  epidural 
haematoma  was  related  to  either  PPS  or  it  might  have  been  a  direct  consequence  of  multiple 
needle  punctures.  However,  the  Applicant  explained  that  an  extensive  epidural  haematoma  that 
leads to neurologic symptoms is unlikely to arise from needle trauma alone. 
-  A  neck  hematoma  reported  in  a  woman  after  an  attempted  internal  jugular  catheter  insertion 
(Gill et  al.  2002) and oral  administration  of  PPS  in doses of  3x300  mg  PPS  per  day  for  at least  4 
months.  
No  alteration  of  coagulation  parameters  have  been  reported  in  a  small  PD  study  on  18  healthy 
volunteers after administration of oral doses of 1500 mg PPS. 
As  limited  information  is  available  on  use  in  patients  concomitantly  using  anticoagulants,  undergoing 
invasive procedures or in patients with increased risk of bleeding, these patients should be evaluated 
carefully for hemorrhage when taking PPS. Therefore, the applicant added: 
-  a  contra-indication  in  section  4.3  of  the  SmPC:  “due  to  the  weak  anticoagulant  effect  of  pentosan 
polysulfate  sodium,  Elmiron  must  not  be  used  in  patients  who  actively  bleed.  Menstruation  is  no 
contraindication” and  
- a warning in section 4.4 of the SmPC: “Pentosan polysulfate sodium is a weak anticoagulant. Patients 
undergoing  invasive  procedures  or  having  signs/symptoms  of  underlying  coagulopathy  or  other 
increased  risk  of  bleeding  (due  to  other  therapies  such  as  coumarin  anticoagulants,  heparin,  t-PA, 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017

streptokinase,  high  dose  acetylsalicylic  acid,  or  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  medicinal  products) 
should be evaluated for hemorrhage”.  
-  An  interaction  in  section  4.5  was  also  added  :  “Due  to  the  weak  anticoagulant  effect  of  pentosan 
polpysulfate sodium, patients, who are concomitantly treated with coumarin anticoagulants, heparin, t-
PA,  streptokinase,  high  dose  aspirin,  or  nonsteroidal  anti-inflammatory  drugs should  be  evaluated  for 
hemorrhage.” 
A  single  case  report  of  cerebral  sagittal  thrombosis  after  oral  administration  of  PPS  for  the 
treatment  of  Interstitial  Cystitis  was  reported  in  scientific  literature  (Rice  et  al.,  1998):  the  patient 
received  a  low  dose  oestrogen  as  oral  contraceptive  and  it  is  known  that  thrombotic  risk  is  higher 
during the first year of contraceptive use, however the treatment was introduced for a long time at the 
time of the event (8 years). On the contrary, PPS was only introduced for 3 weeks at the time of the 
event. No information on decreased platelet counts is available as an indication for thrombocytopenia 
(blood counts only have been evaluated 2-weeks after stopping PPS administration and were normal). 
A  modest  titer  anti-heparin  platelet  factor  4  antibody  was  found  but  the  relevance  and  sensitivity  of 
this ELISA test for PPS-induced antibodies is questionable. PPS-induced thrombocytopenia comparable 
to  heparin-induced  thrombocytopenia  cannot  be  excluded.  It  should  be  noted  that  some  cases  of 
thrombocytopenia  occurring  during  parenteral  PPS  treatment  and  mimicking  the  heparin-induced 
thrombocytopenia have been reported.  
Deaths 
7 deaths were reported in a long-term, open-label study (Hanno et al. 1997), considered as not related 
to study medication. 3 deaths were reported in the study published by Jepsen et al. (1998), considered 
as not related to study medication. 
Laboratory findings 
No changes in blood and urinary samples were noted during the trial reported by Holm-Bentzen et al. 
(1987). The investigations performed before and after the trial included urine culture, urine cytology, 
urinary. There were no abnormal serum tests, including prothrombin time, partial thromboplastin time, 
lactic  dehydrogenase,  serum  glutamic  oxaloacetic  and  pyruvic  transaminases,  haematocrit  or  white 
blood  count  reported  by  Parsons  and  Mulholland  (1987).    A  transient  increase  in  a  γ-glutamyl-
transferase  was  observed  in  4  out  of  87  patients  without  clinical  manifestation  (Fritjofsson  et  al., 
1987).  As  reported  by  Mulholland  et  al.  (1990)  there  were  no  differences  between  the  treatment 
groups in terms of clinically significant changes in any of the laboratory data. One patient in the PPS-
treated group had SGOT and SGPT values of 118 and 133 at three months compared with 56 and 115 
at baseline respectively. There were no clinically relevant differences between the treatment groups for 
any of the laboratory data and there were no laboratory findings outside the normal range for any of 
the  parameters  measured  in  the  study  reported  by  Parsons  et  al.,  1993.  25  months  because  of 
increasing  SGOT  and  SGPT,  which  was  verified  by  re-challenging  with  PPS.  Another  patient  had 
increased  AST  after  5.5  months  but  stopped  taking  PPS  because  of  no  effect.  One  patient  had 
increased creatinine levels of 2.2 mg/dl after 10.5 months but discontinued PPS because IC symptoms 
continued.  There  were  no  cases  with  laboratory  measures  critically  outside  the  normal  limits  and 
related  to  the  trial  intervention  in  the  study  reported  by  Davis  et  al.  (2008).  No  clinically  meaningful 
change was noted in clinical laboratory tests, vital signs or physical examination in the study reported 
by Nickel et al. (2015).  
According  to  the  applicant,  the  laboratory  data  were  not  reported  quantitatively  at  all  or  only 
qualitatively or as individual cases.

Coagulation  findings.  Number  of  previous  studies  showed  a  risk  for  coagulopathy  after  oral 
administration (Gaffney et al., 1986) both after single and multiple dosages, and both in clinical and in 
non-clincial settings (Marsch et al 1985). See Figure 5 below. 
Figure 3The fibrinolytic responces to oral PPS (Gaffney et al., 1986) 
Single dose effect 
Multiple dose effect 
In particular, one observation in Davis et al., 2008 study cannot be neglected: ~40% of blood clotting 
tests  (prothrombin time, partial  thromboplastin  time,  and  platelet  count)  were  outside  normal  ranges 
for both oral PPS and oral plus intravesicular PPS. These findings are in line with several other findings 
of  possible  impact  on  coagulation  of  oral  PPS,  such  as  reported  rectal  bleeding.  According  to  the 
applicant,  the  literature  case  reports  and  cases  from  the  studies,  are  arguing  that  the  issue  is  very 
controversial as the most informative study (Faaij et al., 1999), which used relevant monitoring tests 
(aPTT, Anti-Xa activity, t-PA activity and fibrin plate lysis) did not detect such effects after oral PPS at 
very  high  dosage  (1500  mg  PPS)  in  comparison  with  IV  administration.  Thus,  it  is  reasonable  to 
conclude  that  rectal  bleeding  is  a  clinically  significant  AR  but  does  not  preclude  the  need  to  inform 
prescribers  about  clinical  importance  of  the  other  coagulopathies  adverse  reactions  reported  in  post 
marketing even with a low frequency. Therefore, this “class effect” has been mentioned in the SmPC. 
The AE “Coagulation disorders” has been added in section 4.8 of the SmPC to reflect the reporting of 
laboratory parameters. 
Safety in special populations 
Children 
No information on paediatric patients is reported in the scientific literature. The disease is nearly not 
existent in the paediatric population. The medicinal product will be indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with Interstitial Cystitis. 
Elderly 
The Applicant did not perform a safety analysis based on age. The average age of the patients was 
above 40 years in the literature (from 42.7 to 63 years depending on the study). Patients up to 80 
years were included in the clinical trials.  
Pregnant or breast feeding women 
Pregnant or breast-feeding women were excluded from enrolment into the pivotal clinical trials. 
Systemic bioavailability of PPS after oral administration is very limited, accordingly, exposure of a 
foetus or excretion into milk is very unlikely. 
A study in eight pregnant women who had a planned abortion was conducted to generate data on the 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 100/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
trans placental passage of PPS (Forestier et al., 1986). The data generated in this study provide no 
indication of trans-placental passage of PPS. 
Since no further data from clinical studies with PPS in pregnant or nursing women are available, the 
Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC) states that PPS capsules should not be used during 
pregnancy or lactation unless clearly necessary.  
Patients with renal or hepatic impairment 
No specific information on patients with renal impairment is reported in the literature.  
Because there is evidence of hepatic and renal contribution to the elimination of pentosan polysulfate 
sodium, hepatic or renal impairment may have an impact on the pharmacokinetics of pentosan 
polysulfate sodium. As stated in the product information patients with relevant hepatic or renal 
insufficiency should be carefully monitored when treated with pentosan polysulfate sodium. 
Immunological events 
In a single case of cerebral sagittal sinus thrombosis after oral administration of PPS (see above), no 
indication of antibody formation was observed except a modest positive response received in an 
ELISA-assay for anti-heparin platelet factor 4 antibodies. The relevance and sensitivity of this ELISA 
test for PPS-induced antibodies is questionable.  
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Evaluable information on interactions is limited to the information provided in the literature. 
Drug-drug interactions between PPS and warfarin were evaluated in an open-label study (Modi et al. 
2005). PK parameters of warfarin and INR were similar in the absence and presence of PPS. Pentosan 
polysulfate sodium is a weak anticoagulant. Patients undergoing invasive procedures or having 
signs/symptoms of underlying coagulopathy or other increased risk of bleeding (due to treatment with 
other medicinal products influencing coagulation such as anticoagulants, heparin derivatives, 
thrombolytic or antiplatelet agents including acetylsalicylic acid, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
medicinal products should be evaluated for haemorrhagic events. Patients who have a history of 
heparin or pentosan polysulfate sodium induced thrombocytopenia should be carefully monitored when 
treated with pentosan polysulfate sodium. This is reflected in a warning in section 4.5 of the SmPC, 
with a cross-reference to section 4.4.Discontinuation due to adverse events. 
Holm-Bentzen et al. (1987) reported that 2 patients in protocol A stopped the medication because of 
headache, nausea and dizziness and in protocol B one patient stopped medication because of a skin 
rash after 2 weeks and another one stopped because of aggravation of bladder symptoms. No 
information is provided, whether these patients stopping medication during the study were treated 
with PPS or placebo. Out of the 87 patients enrolled in study published by Fritjofsson et al. (1987), 7 
patients terminated treatment early due to AEs (2 patients due to swollen legs and gastrointestinal 
distress, respectively; urinary infection in one, dysphagia in one, anaemia in one).  
In the report of Parsons et al. (1993), 3 patients in the PPS group and 5 patients in the placebo group 
discontinued treatment due to AEs.  In the compassionate use study reported by Jepsen et al., (1998) 
16/97 patients stopped taking PPS due to AEs. The majority of those (81.6%) stopped therapy during 
the  first  6  months.  Waters  et  al.  (2000)  reported  about  the  retrospective  analysis  in  27  patients 
treated  with  PPS  for  at  least  8  weeks;  4  patients  (15%)  stopped  taking  PPS  because  of  side  effects 
including  diarrhoea,  abdominal  cramping,  nausea,  hair  thinning.  Symptoms  worsened  in  2  patients 
(9%) of the patients, forcing discontinuance. In the study reported by Sant et al. (2003), a total of 10 
patients  (8%)  withdrew  from  study  due  to  adverse  events.  Nickel  et  al.  (2005)  reported  that  in  the 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017

dose-ranging  study  evaluating  daily  oral  administration  of  300,  600  and  900  mg  PPS  for  up  to  32 
weeks, 150 patients (39.5%) discontinued treatment before the end of this study. Of them, 22.4% did 
so because of AEs (primarily diarrhoea and abdominal pain). AEs were the reason for discontinuation of 
treatment in 18%, 16.8%, and 30.7% of patients taking 300, 600, and 900 mg PPS, respectively, and 
this  was  dose  dependent  (p<0.05).  In  the  study  reported  by  Nickel  et  al.  (2015),  AEs,  which  were 
mostly gastrointestinal, led to the withdrawal of 12 patients (10.2%) in the placebo group, 17 (13.3%) 
in  the  PPS  100  mg  group  and  14  (11.5%)  in  the  PPS  300mg  group.  The  applicant  provided  safety 
findings for discontinuations due to AEs for separate studies but without critical cumulative review. In 
particular,  they  are  related  to  rather  limited  local  GI  tolerance.  In  one  of  the  studies  (Nickel  et  al 
2005), these AEs were dose dependent.  
Post marketing experience 
The oral PPS is approved in Canada since 1993, Australia since 1994 and US since 1996. The SmPC 
has been modified to reflect the AEs listed in Canadian, Australian and US SmPCs, including post-
marketing data. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety of PPS capsules was evaluated from scientific publications on the six pivotal, placebo-
controlled clinical studies as well as in supportive active-controlled or uncontrolled studies.  
Overall, more than 3,500 patients were exposed to PPS in published clinical studies evaluating the 
safety and efficacy of PPS for the treatment of IC. In these studies, subjects mainly administered the 
established oral dose of 3x100 mg PPD per day, but also the threefold dose (3x300 mg PPS per day) 
was evaluated. The exposure in the studies covered periods of more than 3 years treatment with PPS.   
The applicant provided a thorough compilation of the patient exposure for safety analyzing separately 
placebo-, active-controlled, open studies and compassionate use for patients exposed to PPS in 
general, to PPS with the proposed dose range and with long-term safety data. The applicant 
summarized that at least more than 4000 patients were exposed to PPS in studies and ~3800 to the 
proposed dose range (300 to 400 mg/day). The information submitted on long-term safety is limited 
(>6 month of therapy, exclusively from uncontrolled studies only). 
No dedicated studies were performed in special populations. Elderly people were included in the pivotal 
studies. Pregnant or breast-feeding women were excluded from enrolment into the pivotal clinical 
trials. No specific studies were performed in patients with renal or hepatic impairment as the systemic 
bioavailability of PPS is very low (< 1%). 
The  ratio  women/men  was  10:1  in  the  pivotal  studies,  which  is  representative  of  the  gender-based 
prevalence  of  the  IC  in  the  general  population.  Meanwhile,  due  to  the  very  low  number  of  male 
patients  enrolled  in  the  clinical  trials,  the  RMP  has  been  updated  to  add  “use  in  male  patient”  as 
missing information in the summary of safety concerns table in order to collect safety data in men in 
post-marketing. 
However, given the mode of action of PPS in the treatment of IC, the safety profile observed of PPS in 
the pivotal studies, it is agreed that there is no reason to expect a specific safety profile in men, as an 
impact  on  the  male  reproductive  system  is  not  expected.  The  only  gender  specific  adverse  event 
reported from clinical studies is “strong menstrual bleeding”.  
Overall, hair-thinning/hair loss/alopecia and gastro-intestinal disorders (e.g. diarrhoea, abdominal 
cramping, nausea, and headache) were the most frequently reported adverse reactions with PPS in the 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 102/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
literature. Bleeding events as rectal bleeding are considered to be related to the heparin-like structure 
of PPS.  
Several cases of serious bleeding AEs with PPS have been published in the literature: one case of 
epidural hematoma, one case of neck hematoma, one case of hematomas (location not specified). For 
two cases, a needle trauma was reported (steroid epidural injection and venous jugular catheter 
insertion) and PPS might have favoured the occurrence of bleeding as PPS has a weak anticoagulant 
effect (heparin-like substance). 
Overall, although this relationship between risk of serious coagulopathies and oral PPS is not obvious, 
the  coagulopathy  is  not  excluded  and  could  be  plausible  considering  other  bleeding  effects  observed 
after  the  oral  PPS  administration  and  in  case  of  co-administration  with  other  medicinal  products 
influencing coagulation. The applicant accepted to include PPS-thrombocytopenia and haemorrhage as 
important potential risks into the updated RMP and to add a contra-indication in patients who actively 
bleed  in  section  4.3  of  the  SmPC,  a  warning  in  4.4  on  patients  undergoing  invasive  procedures  and 
other increased risk of bleeding and an advise in section 4.5 of the SmPC to evaluate for haemorrhagic 
events  in  case  of  concomitant  treatment  with  anticoagulants.  Furthermore  the  AE  “Coagulation 
disorders” has been added in section 4.8 of the SmPC to reflect the reporting of laboratory parameters. 
Several  cases  of  elevated  hepatic  enzymes  (SGOT  and  SGPT)  have  been  reported.  One  case  of 
increased  creatinine  levels  has  been  reported,  possibly  linked  to  PPS  (creatinine  decreased  after 
stopping treatment).  
The  AE  “Liver  function  abnormalities”  has  been  added  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC  to  reflect  the 
reporting of laboratory parameters which is considered acceptable. 
The applicant did not report immunological events except a case of cerebral sagittal sinus thrombosis, 
although no dedicated studies are presented. Allergic reactions which are considered as a “class effect” 
were added in the SmPC to inform about this class effect which may not have been observed directly in 
relation to the product.  
Overall,  adverse  events  led  to  discontinuation  of  the  PPS  treatment  in  a  significant  percentage  of 
patients  (about  8  to  18  %  in  the  published  studies).  Lack  of  efficacy  also  led  to  discontinuation  in  a 
significant percentage of patients (7 to 56 % depending on the study). AEs leading to discontinuation 
were reported in up to 13.2% with a maximal incidence of 22.4%. Therefore it was added to 4.2 of the 
SmPC  that  response  to  treatment  with  pentosan  polysulfate  sodium  should  be  reassessed  every  6 
months  and  that  in  case  no  improvement  is  reached  6  months  after  treatment  initiation,  treatment 
with pentosan polysulfate sodium should be stopped. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the safety profile of PPS is not considered of concern. Due to the heparin-like structure of PPS, 
a weak anticoagulant effect was observed with PPS and patients with risk factors for increased bleeding 
(undergoing invasive procedures, having underlying coagulopathy or taking anticoagulants) should be 
carefully evaluated for haemorrhage during the treatment.  This risk is adequately addressed in various 
sections of the SmPC and as important identified risk in the RMP.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Interstitital Cystitis (IC) is a chronic, debilitating disorder, distressing bladder condition, which is 
characterised by pelvic pain associated with bladder filling, pollakiuria with a voiding frequency of more 
than eight urinations per day and more than two urinations per night, cystoscopic lesions (petechiae, 
Hunner's ulcers) revealed by a bladder hydrodistention test, and/or histological anomalies such as 
inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltrates and tissue granulation, in the absence of infection or any 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 106/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
other pathology. The clinical picture is dominated by pain and pollakiuria. Although the pain is usually 
described as pelvic, it may also involve the perineum, vagina, suprapubically radiating to the groins, 
rectum, sacrum, scrotum and urethra. It becomes more severe upon bladder filling with relief after 
urination. The pollakiuria is the consequence of a nearly constant urge to urinate, which increases with 
bladder filling and is relieved by urination. 90% of the patients are afflicted women in their fifth and 
sixth decades of life. Symptoms often resemble those of patients with overactive bladder. Up to 50% 
of patients with symptoms of interstitial cystitis will have spontaneous resolution in time.  
The  diagnosis  of  IC  is  primarily  one  of  exclusion,  using  symptoms,  examination,  urine  analysis  and 
urine  culture  (to  rule  out  a  urinary  tract  infection),  cystoscopy  with  hydrodistension  (to  rule  out 
bladder  cancer,  vesical  stones,  urethral  diverticula  and  intravesical  foreign  bodies),  and  biopsy  (to 
exclude other pathologies). 
In  the  pivotal  studies,  the  population  was  included  with  different  IC  definitions,  mixing  both  broad 
IC/BPS  (i.e.  In  European  Holm-Bentzen  et  al.  1987  Study  and  in  Canadian/US  Nickel  et  al  2015 
Study)  or  definitions  falling  within  ESSIC  BPS  classification  2X  to  3C  (i.e.  in  Parsons  and  Mulholland 
1987 Study, Mulholland et al 1990 Study, Parsons et al 1993 Study, and in Sant et al 2003 Study).  
In  accordance  with  the  advice  of  the  ad  hoc  expert  group  and  the  ESSIC  classification  (Engeler  et  al 
2015)  the  CHMP  considered  that  the  definition  of  former  IC  at  the  time  when  most  of  the  pivotal 
studies  were  performed  would,  as  per  todays  classification,  fall  under  BPS  characterized  by 
glomerulations  or  Hunner’s  lesions  (BPS  type  2X  –  3C)  and  the  applicant  agreed  to  amend  the 
indication  accordingly.  Furthermore  pain  is  considered  as  the  main  key  symptom  of  the  disease  and 
should be taken into consideration in the definition of the disease.  
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
All available treatment options thus far are purely symptomatic. There are no medicinal products 
approved for the treatment of IC in Europe. Current treatment options include: 
•off-label enteral and parenteral use of medicinal products (analgesics, corticosteroids, anti-allergics, 
PPS, Hydroxyzine, Amitriptyline, antibiotics, immunosuppressants, Gabapentin, pregabalin, and 
quercetin) 
•bladder hydro-distension 
•intravesical application of medicinal products and medical devices (DMSO, PPS…) 
•surgery 
Therefor a medical need for approved treatment options in interstitial cystitis / bladder pain syndrome 
characterized by either glomerulations or Hunner’s lesions exists given the fact that there are no 
medicinal products authorised for this condition in Europe. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant provided literature on six randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies as pivotal 
database to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PPS of which Mulholland et al 1990 and Parsons et al 
1993 studies were the pivotal studies for MAA in USA and Canada.  
All but one of 6 pivotal studies were conducted more than 10 years ago (except the more recent study 
of Nickel et al 2015). IC patients characterized by either glomerulations or Hunner’s lesions (BPS type

2 – 3)  were included in four of the pivotal studies (Parsons and Mulholland 1987, Mulholland et al 
1990, Parsons et al 1993 and Sant et al 2003).  
The study objectives were “prospective evaluation of PPS for the treatment of IC”. Key study 
endpoints/outcomes in all 6 pivotal studies were patient-reported outcomes via patient responder 
analysis which is considered as a reasonable approach for a functional disease.  
The patient population enrolled in the 6 pivotal studies varied between the studies and altogether was 
enrolling a broader BPS population. The majority of patients were Caucasian, female and the average 
age was above 40 years. The majority of the patients enrolled are Caucasians and considered 
representative for the EU population.  
Within the 6 pivotal studies data on two dosage regimens was provided: either 100 mg 3 times a day 
or 200 mg 2 times a day. The treatment duration was ranging from 3 months to 6 months. The 
recommended dose is 300 mg/day taken as one 100 mg capsule orally three times daily with 
assessment of response to treatment every 6 months. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Among  the  6  pivotal  studies,  3  studies  (Parsons  and  Mulholland  1987,  Mulholland  et  al  1990  an 
Parsons  et  al  1993)  met  their  primary  endpoint  “overall  global  improvement”  (assessed  by  a 
patients self-evaluation confirmed by an investigator’s evaluation based on patients reporting at least 6 
moderately  improved  or  7  markedly  improved  on  7  point  numerical  rating  scale)  and  their  key 
secondary endpoints such as pain in comparison to placebo. The 3 other studies (Holm-Bentzen et al 
1987,  Sant  et  al  2003  and  Nickel  et  al  2015)  did  not  meet  their  primary  and  their  key  secondary 
endpoints.  
In the primary meta-analysis conducted by the applicant including all 6 pivotal studies published 
between 1987 and 2015, the estimated benefit differences in overall improvement were about 13% 
with the two approaches (ITT or as reported).   
This benefit difference was mainly driven by the pivotal studies Parsons et al 1993 and Mulholland et al 
1990 for the drug approval of Elmiron in the US and by an earlier study (Parsons and Mulholland 1987) 
including patients falling within ESSIC classification 2X to 3C (patients with cystoscopic changes i.e. 
either glomerulations or Hunner’s lesions). A 4th study enrolling patients falling within ESSIC 
classification 2X to 3C (Sant et al. (2003)) did not show a statistically significant benefit difference 
against placebo but a positive trend and was conducted in the US at the time when PPS (as Elmiron) 
was commercially available for the treatment of IC which lead to enrolment of patients previously 
treated with PPS. No beneficial effect was demonstrated in studies using less specific IC definition 
(Holm-Bentzen et al., 1987 and Nickel et al., 2015). Also the severe limitations of the Nickel et al 
study (patients with milder disease entering during a symptom flare, regression to the mean, 
introduction (inadvertent or not) of conservative therapy, which accentuated the benefits of placebo, 
and failure of clinical sites to keep patients in the trial) are acknowledged by the CHMP. In addition, the 
results of Holm-Bentzen study are difficult to interpret as the GRA was not used as primary endpoint.  
The estimated benefit differences reached 17% in the sensitivity analysis when excluding the 2 studies 
(Holm-Bentzen et al 1987 and Nickel et al 2015) which presented the lowest response rates and 
enrolled a broader and less homogeneous patient population. 
The applicant provided a comparison of the definitions of the primary endpoints “GRA” and responder 
rates  among  all  6  studies  and  especially  in  the  four  pivotal  studies.    It  is  agreed  that  the  responder 
rates  used  in  the  four  pivotal  studies  enrolling  a  homogeneous  and  clear  defined  patient  population 
Assessment report  
EMA/287422/2017  
Page 108/115 
 
 
 
 
 
which  is  representative  of  the  targeted  patient population  (Parsons  and  Mulholland,  1987,  Mulholland 
et al., 1990; Parsons et al., 1993, Sant et al., 2003) are deemed comparable.  
When  considering  the supportive  meta-analysis  on  the  key  secondary symptoms  “pain  and  urgency”, 
the benefit differences reached statistically significance (whatever the approaches ITT or as reported) 
in line with the primary meta-analysis evaluating the GRA.  
It was therefore agreed with the applicant to base the indication on the more homogeneous population 
of the four pivotal studies including patients with BPS type 2 – 3 outlining in 4.1 of the SmPC bladder 
pain  syndrome  characterized  by  either  glomerulations  or  Hunner’s  lesions  reflecting  the  patient 
population in which clinical efficacy was demonstrated. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The  beneficial  effect  of  PPS  was  mainly  driven  by  the  pivotal  studies  including  patients  falling  within 
ESSIC  classification  2X  to  3C  whereas  no  beneficial  effect  was  demonstrated  in  studies  using  less 
specific  IC  /  BPS  inclusion  criteria  for  patients.  Also,  the  mechanism  of  action  of  PPS  is  currently  not 
totally understood and only 1% of the orally administered PPS is absorbed.  
The  term  “BPS”  should  be  used  rather  than  interstitial  cystitis  (IC).  Indeed,  the  term  BPS  was  put 
forward  by  the  International  Society  for  the  Study  of  BPS  (ESSIC)  and  is  currently  used  in  the 
guidelines and by the experts. Whereas a beneficial effect, as outlined by the ad hoc experts, might be 
generalizable to other BPS types, robust data on this effect are missing. In accordance with the experts 
view,  it  was  also  taken  into  account  by  the  CHMP  that  the  definition  of  a  target  population  which 
benefits most from the drug would avoid to try unsuccessful treatments.  
Given uncertainties about the favourable effects of elmiron in a broader BPS population the approved 
indication  refers  therefore  to  patients  diagnosed  with  bladder  pain  syndrome  characterized  by  either 
glomerulations  or  Hunner’s  lesions  using  traditional  diagnostic  approach  including  cystoscopic 
examination with or without hydrodistension which corresponds to the population included in the four 
pivotal studies (Parsons and Mulholland 1987, Mulholland et al 1990, Parsons et al 1993 and Sant et al 
2003) in which the efficacy was robustly demonstrated (in three of these studies the primary endpoint 
reached statistical significance).  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Hair-thinning/hair  loss/alopecia  and  gastro-intestinal  disorders  (e.g.  diarrhoea,  abdominal  cramping, 
and nausea, headache) were the most frequently reported adverse reactions with PPS in the literature.  
The  most  common  adverse  events  reported  from  the  clinical  studies  are  headache,  dizziness  and 
gastro-intestinal events like diarrhoea, nausea, abdominal pain and rectal bleeding. 
Cases  of  serious  bleeding  AEs  with  PPS  have  been  published  in  the  literature:  one  case  of  epidural 
hematoma,  one  case  of  neck  hematoma,  one  case  of  hematomas  (location  not  specified).  For  two 
cases, a needle trauma was reported (steroid epidural injection and venous jugular catheter insertion) 
and  PPS  might  have  favoured  the  occurrence  of  bleeding  as  PPS  has  a  weak  anticoagulant  effect 
(heparin-like substance).  
It was therefore concluded that due to the heparin-like structure of PPS, a weak anticoagulant effect 
might be observed with PPS and patients with risk factors for increased bleeding (undergoing invasive 
procedures, having underlying coagulopathy or taking anticoagulants) should be carefully evaluated for 
haemorrhage during the treatment as it is mentioned in section 4.4 of the SmPC. Furthermore PPS-
Assessment report

Page 109/115 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thrombocytopenia and haemorrhage was included as important potential risks into the RMP and a 
contra-indication in patients who actively bleed.  
Regarding the potential immunological ADRs, the applicant explained that there might be different 
reasons for immunological ADRs and agrees that in some cases, allergic reactions related to PPS could 
be the cause (in case of skin rash). Therefore, the applicant included the AEs “rash” and “allergic 
reactions” into section 4.8 of the SmPC. Overall the safety profile of elmiron is considered not of 
concern. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
PK  has  not  been  studied  in  some  of  the  special  populations  (elderly  patients,  hepatically  or  renally 
impaired  patients,  paediatric  patients,  pregnant  and  breast  feeding  women)  and  the  lack  of  this  data 
as well as precautionary statement are reflected in the SmPC. 
The  ratio  women/men  was  10:1  in  the  pivotal  studies,  which  is  representative  of  the  gender-based 
prevalence  of  the  IC  in  the  general  population.  Meanwhile,  due  to  the  very  low  number  of  male 
patients  enrolled  in  the  clinical  trials,  the  RMP  had  been  updated  to  add  “use  in  male  patient”  as  
missing information in the summary of safety concerns table in order to collect safety data in men in 
post-marketing. 
Existing post-marketing experience and Nickel et al. (2005) data indicate that most common reported 
AEs were diarrhoea, rectal bleeding and abdominal pain. However a causal relationship between PPS 
and GIT-AEs is not obvious as GITs are equally reported as associated with the underlying disease and 
independent of any treatment. In case of a causal relationship, most likely local irritant properties 
might be responsible regarding an interaction of PPS and mucus the addition to the SmPC to stop the 
treatment in case of AE and in case of non-efficiency after 6 month of therapy takes this into account. 
As limited information is available on use in patients concomitantly using anticoagulants, undergoing 
invasive procedures or in patients with increased risk of bleeding, a warning statement was included 
into the SmPC to evaluate these patients carefully for haemorrhage when taking elmiron.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Considering the meta-analysis of the four pivotal studies performed with patients falling within ESSIC 
BPS  classification  2X  to  3C  showed  a  benefit  difference  of  17%  (PPS  versus  placebo)  and  the  pooled 
response  rate  under  PPS  treatment  even  2-fold  higher  than  the  pooled  response  rate  under  placebo 
(“GRA” primary endpoint and also pain and urgency) and following the ad hoc expert group and in the 
context  of  unmet  medical  need  (no  drug  treatment  authorized  in  this  indication)  the  CHMP  considers 
this  response  rate  as  clinically  relevant  in  the  target  population  in  which  efficacy  was  significantly 
demonstrated  in  the  pivotal  trials  and  defined  with  a  bladder  pain  syndrome  characterized  by  either 
glomerulations  of  Hunner’s  lesions  and  with  moderate  to  severe  pain,  urgency  and  frequency  of 
micturition. Also it was essential to define a target population which benefits most from the drug. 
The  safety  of  elmiron  is  not  of  particular  concern.  Due  to  the  heparin-like  structure  of  PPS,  a  weak 
anticoagulant effect might be observed with elmiron which could become apparent in patients with risk 
factors  for  increased  bleeding  and  in  patients  who  actively  bleed.  This  potential  risk  is  considered 
appropriatly addressed by routine risk minimisation measures. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Patients  diagnosed  with  bladder  pain  syndrome  characterized  by  either  glomerulations  or  Hunner’s 
lesions  using  traditional  diagnostic  approach  including  cystoscopic  examination  with  or  without 
hydrodistension correspond to the population included in four of the six pivotal studies.  
Indeed in these four pivotal studies patients reported a better subjective improvement under treatment 
with  pentosan  polysulfate  sodium  compared  to  placebo.  In  three  of  these  studies  (Parsons  and 
Mulholland  1987,  Mulholland  et  al  1990,  Parsons  et  al  1993),  and  in contrast  to  efficacy  results  in  the 
pivotal  studies  including  a  broader  BPS  population,  the  observed  difference  reached  statistical 
significance.  
The  pooled  analysis  showed  that  the  percentage  of  patients  responding  to  treatment  with  PPS  with  a 
clinically relevant improvement in their overall assessment, pain and urgency was approximately 2-fold 
higher than the respective responder rates under placebo:

Furthermore,  there  are  no  pharmaceutical  treatment  alternatives.  Indeed,  no  drug  treatment  is 
currently  authorized  in  this  indication  in  Europe.  The  relatively  benign  safety  profile  is  considered 
appropriately addressed by routine risk minimization measures. 
The  term  BPS  rather  than  interstitial  cystitis  (IC)  was  put  forward  by  the  International  Society  for  the 
Study of BPS (ESSIC) and is currently used in the guidelines and by the experts.

Overall, the balance of benefit risks of PPS is positive in bladder pain syndrome characterized by either 
glomerulations  or  Hunner’s  lesions  in  adults  with  moderate  to  severe  pain,  urgency  and  frequency  of 
micturition.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of elmiron is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of elmiron is favourable in the following indication: 
elmiron is indicated for the treatment of bladder pain syndrome characterized by either glomerulations 
or Hunner’s lesions in adults with moderate to severe pain, urgency and frequency of micturition (see 
section 4.4).

Please refer to the assessment report:  
Article 31 of Directive 2001/83/EC and requested the 
CHMP to assess the impact of nitrosamine impurities 
on the benefit-risk balance of valsartan-containing 
medicinal products and to issue a recommendation 
on whether the relevant marketing authorisations 
should be maintained, varied, suspended or revoked. 
During the CHMP plenary meeting in September 
2018, the scope of the referral has been widened to 
include all sartans with a tetrazole group in their 
molecular structure (candesartan, irbesartan, 
Amlodipine-Valsartan Mylan EMEA/H/A-

losartan, olmesartan and valsartan). The CHMP 
Opinion was issued on 31 January 2019 and the 
Commission Decision was issued on 17 April 2019. 
In a letter dated 29 July 2020, the European 
Commission requested the EMA to assess the impact 
of the outcome of the Article 5(3) assessment on 
nitrosamines adopted on 25 June 2020 on the 
CHMP's opinion of 31 January 2019 for the scientific 
assessment and review under Article 31 of Directive 
2001/83/EC regarding angiotensin-II-receptor 
antagonists (sartans) containing a tetrazole group 
(EMEA/H/A-31/1471). The CHMP was requested to 
give its recommendation whether the conditions of

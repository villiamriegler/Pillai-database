context of all this information including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-
language summary, all which is part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR). 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates of 
Apretude 30 mg Film-coated tablets RMP. 
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Apretude 30 mg Film-coated tablets is authorised in combination with safer sex practices for 
short term pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to reduce the risk of sexually acquired HIV-1 
infection in at-risk individuals weighing at least 35 kg.  
Cabotegravir tablets may be used as: 
• oral lead in to assess tolerability of cabotegravir prior to administration of cabotegravir
injection.
• oral PrEP in individuals who will miss planned dosing with cabotegravir injection.
It contains cabotegravir as the active substance and it is given by oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of Apretude ’s benefits can be found in Apretude ’s 
EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, under the 
medicine’s webpage: https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/apretude 
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Apretude , together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about Apretude 's risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
 
•
•
•
•
Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals;
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure
that the medicine is used correctly;
The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
In the case of Apretude , these measures are supplemented with additional risk minimization 
measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below. 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including PSUR assessment. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Apretude  is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Apretude , are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely taken.  Important 
risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which there is 
sufficient proof of a link with the use of Apretude . Potential risks are concerns for which an 
association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association has not been established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine);

II.B Summary of important risks
Important identified risk: Hepatotoxicity 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Clinical trials have shown that transient elevations of liver enzymes 
(transaminitis) may occur with CAB PrEP for a variety of reasons; 
these events are uncommon. Hepatotoxicity (Drug induced liver 
injury [DILI]) is considered an identified risk for CAB. Clinical study 
data from the CAB PrEP development programme provide the 
evidence for this risk as detailed below  
Risk factors and risk groups 
Hepatotoxicity has been reported in a limited number of individuals 
receiving CAB with or without known pre-existing hepatic disease  
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
• SmPC section 4.4, 4.8.
• PL section 2 & 4.
• Recommendation for liver chemistry monitoring are included in

CONFIDENTIAL 
Important identified risk: HIV-1 Seroconversion 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
During the HPTN 083 trial, there were 13 incident infections on the 
CAB arm. Four incident infections occurred during the HPTN 084 
trial on the CAB arm. The numbers of incident infections on CAB 
were low, and those due to possible non-adherence even lower still. 
However, these occurred in a controlled clinical trial setting; In real 
world use, there may be more instances where individuals at risk 
may not fully adhere to the dosing regimen or other prevention 
strategies. 
Multiple factors, including individuals who do not adhere to the 
dosing regimen and other prevention strategies while receiving CAB 
PrEP may be associated with a risk of seroconversion. 
Risk minimisation measures 
Routine risk minimisation measures: 
• SmPC section 4.1, 4.4
• PL section 1, 2
•
Individuals should be re-confirmed to be HIV-negative at each
injection visit

Important identified risk: Development of resistance:  
In participants starting CAB with unrecognized or acute HIV-1 infection  
Due to breakthrough HIV-1 infection while on CAB OLI or LA and delayed diagnosis 
Potential risk of HIV-1 acquisition occurring during ‘PK tail’ and diagnosis is delayed or effective ARV is 
not started timely 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
There were 4 prevalent/baseline HIV infections on HPTN 083, where 
HIV infected participants were started on CAB PrEP. Of the 4 
participants, 1 participant developed INSTI resistance. 
There were 7 participants with incident infections on HPTN 083, 3 
during the OLI period and 4 during in time injections. Of these 
incident infections 4/7 participants showed INSTI resistance. 
There were 5 incident infections in participants that occurred ≥6 
months after the last dose of CAB PrEP (during the PK tail), none of 
these participants showed INSTI resistance.  
HPTN 084 
Four (0.25%) HIV incident infections occurred in the CAB group and 
36 (1.85%) in the TDF/FTC group. Two infections occurred in 
women with no recent oral CAB exposure and no injections and two 
occurred during the injection phase of the study.  
HIV genotyping results were available for 3 of the 4 CAB group 
participants. No major INSTI resistance mutations were detected. 
One of the 3 participants had an integrase mutation at the first 
viremic visit (L74I). This mutation is considered to be a 
polymorphism and was also detected in several participants in the 
TDF/FTC group. 
In some settings, a clinic may not have access to a diagnostic HIV 
test with a level of sensitivity to detect HIV infections early during the 
acute period of infection. Delay in confirmation of an individual’s 
positive HIV status may increase the risk of resistance development 
as the individual will not be transferred to a fully suppressive ARV 
regimen. 
A delay in HIV diagnosis with a delay in fully suppressive ARV 
initiation may provide an opportunity for selection of INSTI-resistant 
variants.  
Incomplete adherence to PrEP or other preventative strategies is a 
possible risk factor for HIV infection and subsequent development of 
drug resistance. Individuals who may be at risk of adherence to the 
prespecified visits and injection schedule or who may stop CAB 
PrEP, or miss scheduled appointments, without informing their 
Risk factors and risk groups 
 
physician or do not follow other preventative strategies may not be

See section II.C of this summary for an overview of the post-authorisation 
development plan. 
 
Important potential risk: Medication errors (including treatment non-compliance) 
Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
CAB PrEP as a long acting PrEP formulation may be considered 
novel and extra care may be required initially to avoid medication 
errors, which includes mistakes in the prescribing, dispensing, 
storing, preparation and administration of a medicine. If CAB PrEP is 
not administered correctly in accordance with the product labelling 
and if individuals are not compliant with CAB PrEP adherence this 
could also negatively impact the effectiveness of CAB PrEP. This 
could include, e.g. if the individual at risk does not receive their 
repeat injections within the specified window for dosing, the 
individual at risk does not adhere to their injection visits, CAB PrEP 
LA is discontinued without fully ascertaining the individual’s 
continued level of risk of HIV acquisition and without consideration of 
alternative PrEP options as required. These factors could negatively 
impact how effective CAB is leading to potentially HIV 
seroconversion and/or development of resistance.  
Clinical trials 
A few reports of dispensing errors occurred during the pivotal HPTN 
083 and 084 studies which included delays in dosing, some dosing 
errors such as incorrect dosing volume administered and incorrect 
use of needle size. No adverse events were reported as a 
consequence of these dosing errors in HPTN 083 and adverse 
events reported in HPTN 084 did not highlight any cases of HIV 
seroconversion, drug resistance or an issue of lack of efficacy.  
Post-marketing use 
A small number (n=11) of cases of medication errors (including 
improper administration, vial leakage, underdosing, incorrect storage 
of product) have been reported one year after first marketing of CAB 
PrEP. These cases were generally, poorly documented. No cases of 
HIV seroconversion or resistance were reported as a result of the 
reported medication errors.  
Some post-marketing cases have been received describing non-
adherence by individuals, e.g. dosing outside the dosing 
window/schedule and/or individuals missing their injection visit. In 
the majority of these cases no adverse events were reported as a 
consequence of the non-adherence and no seroconversion or drug 
resistance were reported as a result of these reported medication 
errors. 
 
Risk factors and risk groups 
CAB PrEP is a long acting formulation and there is a risk that if CAB 
PrEP is not administered following the label correctly, the individual 
could be underdosed, or if an individual misses their injection dose, 
this could make CAB PrEP less effective.  
Individuals who may be at risk of non-adherence to the prespecified 
visits, injection schedule, miss scheduled appointments or who may 
stop CAB PrEP, without informing their HCP or do not follow other 
preventative strategies may not be suited to LA injection for HIV 
prevention.

Evidence for linking the risk to 
the medicine 
The safety of CAB during human pregnancy and breastfeeding has 
not been established. No studies have been conducted with CAB for 
HIV treatment or PrEP in pregnant and breastfeeding women. 
Clinical experience of CAB use during pregnancy is limited and is 
not available in breastfeeding.  
At the time of the data cut-off (05 November 2020) there were 49 
confirmed (defined as a first positive pregnancy test followed by a 
positive confirmatory test result at least 4 weeks later or confirmation 
by another method) pregnancies from HPTN 084. Of these, there 
were 29 confirmed pregnancies for CAB PrEP. Outcomes of 
confirmed pregnancies occurred at similar frequencies across 
treatment groups.

Missing information: Use in Pregnancy and breastfeeding 
Evidence for linking the 
risk to the medicine 
The safety of CAB during human pregnancy and breastfeeding has not 
been established. No studies have been conducted with CAB for HIV 
treatment or PrEP in pregnant and breastfeeding women. Clinical 
experience of CAB use during pregnancy is limited and not available in 
breastfeeding.  
Due to the LA nature of the CAB injection, exposure could occur at the time 
of conception and throughout the time of the pregnancy even if injections 
were stopped as soon as pregnancy was identified. In post marketing, 
individuals will be informed that CAB should be used during pregnancy 
only if the expected benefit justifies the potential risk to the foetus. As CAB 
has been detected in systemic circulation for up to 12 months or longer 
after an injection, consideration should be given to the potential for foetal 
exposure during pregnancy. 
At the time of the data cut-off (05 November 2020) there were 49 
confirmed (defined as a first positive pregnancy test followed by a positive 
confirmatory test result at least 4 weeks later or confirmation by another 
method) pregnancies from HPTN 084. Of these, there were 29 confirmed 
pregnancies for CAB PrEP. Outcomes of confirmed pregnancies occurred 
at similar frequencies across treatment groups.

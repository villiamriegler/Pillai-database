 SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
2.1 
Introduction 
Raloxifene  Teva  60  mg  Film-coated  Tablets  is  a  generic  medicinal  product  containing  raloxifene 
hydrochloride as active substance. The reference medicinal product Evista 60 mg Film-coated Tablets 
has been authorised for at least 10 years in the Community (Eli Lilly Nederland B.V., registered since 
05 August 1998). The active substance of the reference product is raloxifene hydrochloride. 
Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Raloxifene Teva, and its bioequivalence with the 
reference product Evista. 
Raloxifene is indicated for the treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. A 
significant reduction in the incidence of vertebral, but not hip fractures has been demonstrated. When 
determining  the  choice  of  raloxifene  or  other  therapies,  including  oestrogens,  for  an  individual 
postmenopausal  woman,  consideration  should  be  given  to  menopausal  symptoms,  effects  on  uterine 
and breast tissues, and cardiovascular risks and benefits. 
Osteoporosis  is  a  systemic  skeletal  disorder  characterised  by  low bone  mass  and  micro-architectural 
deterioration of bone tissue, with consequent increase in bone fragility and susceptibility to fractures. 
As  a  selective  oestrogen  receptor  modulator  (SERM),  raloxifene  has  selective  agonist  or  antagonist 
activities on tissues responsive to oestrogen. It acts as an agonist on bone and partially on cholesterol 
metabolism (decrease in total and LDL-cholesterol), but not in the hypothalamus or in the uterine or 
breast tissues. 
Raloxifene  biological  actions,  like  those  of  oestrogen,  are  mediated  through  high  affinity  binding  to 
oestrogen receptors and regulation of gene expression. This binding results in differential expression 
of  multiple  oestrogen-regulated  genes  in  different  tissues.  Recent  data  suggests  that  the  oestrogen 
receptor  can  regulate  gene  expression  by  at  least  two  distinct  pathways  which  are  ligand-,  tissue-, 
and/or gene-specific. 
The recommended dose is one tablet daily by oral administration, which may be taken at any time of 
the day without regard to meals. No dose adjustment is necessary for the elderly. Due to the nature of 
this disease process, raloxifene is intended for long term use. 
Generally calcium and vitamin D supplements are advised in women with a low dietary intake. 
Use  in  renal  impairment:  raloxifene  should  not be  used  in  patients  with  severe  renal  impairment.  In 
patients with moderate and mild renal impairment, raloxifene should be used with caution.  
Use in hepatic impairment: raloxifene should not be used in patients with hepatic impairment. 
Raloxifene is associated with an increased risk for venous thromboembolic events that is similar to the 
reported  risk  associated  with  current  use  of  hormone  replacement  therapy.  The  risk-benefit  balance 
should be considered in patients at risk of venous thromboembolic events of any aetiology. Raloxifene 
should  be  discontinued  in  the  event  of  an  illness  or  a  condition  leading  to  a  prolonged  period  of 
immobilisation.  Discontinuation  should  happen  as  soon  as  possible  in  case  of  the  illness,  or  from  3 
days before  the  immobilisation  occurs. Therapy  should  not  be  restarted  until  the  initiating  condition 
has resolved and the patient is fully mobile.

identification,  dissolution,  uniformity  of  dosage  units,  assay,  related  substances,  loss  on  drying, 
residual solvents and microbiological quality. The specifications are adequate to control the medicinal 
product. 
All  analytical  methods  used  to  test  the  drug  product  have  been  properly  described.  All  non-
pharmacopoeial methods were validated. 
Satisfactory batch data have been provided and the results comply with the specification and confirm 
consistency of the product. 
Stability of the Product 
ICH  compliant  stability  studies  in  accelerated  (40  ±  2  °C/75  ±  5  %  RH)  and  long-term  storage 
conditions (25 ± 2 °C/60 ± 5 % RH) have been performed up to 6 months and 12 months, respectively. 
The  parameters  tested  were:  appearance,  loss  on  drying,  dissolution,  related  substances,  assay  and 
microbiological purity. The proposal to extrapolate this data to 24 months shelf life is acceptable.  
Comparability Exercise for Drug Product  
Compatibility of the formulation with the proposed container closure system was demonstrated by the 
ongoing stability studies. 
2.3 
Non-Clinical aspects   
Since  Raloxifene  Teva  is  essentially  similar  product  to  reference  product,  no  additional  safety  and 
toxicology studies were considered necessary. 
Discussion on Non-Clinical aspects 
Raloxifene is a Selective Oestrogen Receptor Modulator (SERM). Raloxifene's biological actions, like 
those of oestrogen, are mediated through high affinity binding to oestrogen receptors and regulation of 
gene  expression.  The  non-clinical  overview  considered  in  detail  aspects  of  the  effects  of  raloxifene 
which are not directly relevant to the proposed therapeutic indication. 
2.4 
Clinical Aspects  
Introduction 
The initial CHMP assessment addressed pharmacokinetic data in respect of one bioequivalence study 
(study  XX)  and  one  study  investigating  intra-subject  variability  (study  YY).  However,  using  the 
standard 80.00 to 125.00 criteria bioequivalence was not demonstrated. The applicant provided a new 
study (study ZZ) to provide evidence of acceptable bioequivalence. 
© EMA 2010  
7/15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is stated that all clinical work has been conducted in compliance with Good Clinical Practices (GCP) 
as  referenced  in  the  ICH  guidelines  (ICH  E6),  local  regulatory  requirements,  and  the  principles 
enunciated in the Declaration of Helsinki. 
Clinical studies 
This application is a generic application, therefore, demonstration of therapeutic equivalence is shown 
by  means  of  pharmacokinetic  bioavailability  studies.  New  clinical  studies  are  neither  required  nor 
submitted. Bioequivalence between the test product and the reference product has been investigated in 
two cross-over study after a single dose in fasting conditions of the 60 mg film coated tablet (Study 
XX and ZZ). The second study (Study YY) was to investigate intra-subjects variability. 
Pharmacokinetics  
Study XX 
Methods 
Study design  
Study  XX  was  an  open-label,  single-dose,  randomized,  two-period,  two-sequence,  two-treatment, 
crossover study, designed to evaluate the comparative bioavailability of two formulations of raloxifene 
administered  to  healthy,  male  and  post-menopausal  and/or  surgically  sterile  female  subjects  under 
fasting conditions. 
The study products were administered as a single oral dose of 1 x 60 mg tablets of either the test or 
reference formulation with 240 ml of water, after an overnight fast of at least 10 hours prior to drug 
administration  and  for  at  least  4  hours  following  drug  administration.  The  study  consisted  of  2 
treatment phases of 120 hours. Patients were recruited in 2 groups of 40, for logistical ease. There was 
a 14 day washout period between the treatments. 
In each period, 29 blood samples from 28 time points were obtained from an arm vein of each subject 
by direct veno puncture or from an indwelling cannula. During each study period, blood samples (1 x 
6 ml each) were taken from each subject at pre-dose and after dose administration at 0.33, 0.67, 1, 2, 3, 
4, 4.33, 4.67, 5, 5.33, 5.67, 6, 6.33, 6.67, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 15, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96 and 120 hours.  
This  study  was  performed  by  qualified  investigators  in  a  clinical  facility  located  in  Canada.  The 
clinical  laboratory  facility  was  also  located  in  Canada..  The  Analytical,  Pharmacokinetic,  Statistical 
and Report Issuing facility was also located in Canada. 
The clinical study protocol No XX was approved by the Ethics Committee on 24/04/2008. The clinical 
phase was performed in two groups and two periods. Subjects of group 1 were tested on 08/05/2008 
and  22/05/2008  (period  1  and  2  respectively).  Subjects  of  group  2  were  tested  on  11/05/2008  and 
25/05/2008  (period  1  and  2  respectively).  The  analysis  of  the  samples  was  conducted  in  the  period 
from 28/05/2008 to 30/05/2008 for group 1 and in the period from 30/05/2008 to 02/06/2008 for group 
2.  
The study was complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant. 
Test and reference products   
Raloxifene 60 mg Tablets by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd (manufacturing Date: Feb. 10, 2008) 
has  been  compared  to  Evista®  60  mg  Film  Coated  Tablets  by  Eli  Lilly  and  Company  Limited,  UK 
(exp. date 10 2008).

Population(s) studied   
Eighty  subjects  were  recruited,  and  79  subjects  who  completed  the  study  were  included  in  the 
pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. Subject 28 was excluded from the study at Period 2 check-in 
due  to  non-compliance.  There  were  61  male  between  age  of  18  –  55  years  and  18  were  post-
menopausal and/or surgically sterile female subjects between age of 18 – 65 years. All subjects were 
judged to be healthy based on a medical history, ECG, laboratory evaluation and physical examination 
Analytical methods   
Raloxifene  was  measured  in  plasma  using  a  validated  chromatographic  assay  method  (LC-MS/MS 
method),  with  a  lower  limit  of  quantification  of  0.0100  ng/ml.  The  sample  analysis  calibration 
standards range was from 0.0100 to 1.50 ng/ml. The validation of the analytical method is satisfactory. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables  
The  pharmacokinetic  parameters  AUCt,  AUCinf,  Cmax,  Tmax,  Kel  and  T1/2  were  estimated  based  on 
plasma raloxifene levels for each subject included in the statistical analysis. 
Statistical methods   
Descriptive statistics were estimated for the pharmacokinetic parameters in each treatment. Analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) was applied to log-transformed AUCt, AUCinf, Cmax and to untransformed Kel 
and T1/2 parameters. The significance of the sequence, period, treatment, and subject within- sequence 
effects were tested. The least square means, the differences between the treatments least square means, 
and the corresponding standard errors of these differences were estimated for log-transformed AUCt, 
AUCinf,  Cmax  parameters.  Based  on  these  statistics,  the  ratios  of  the  geometric  means  for  treatments 
and the corresponding 90% confidence intervals were calculated. Values for the Tmax parameter were 
analyzed by a non-parametric approach. 
Based  on  the  log-transformed  parameters,  the  following  criteria  were  used  to  evaluate  the 
bioequivalence between the test and reference products: 
• The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean plasma raloxifene AUCt and AUCinf of the test to 
reference products should be between 80-125%. 
•  The  90%  confidence  interval  of  the  relative  mean  plasma  raloxifene  C max  of  the  test  to  reference 
products should be between 75-133%. 
The Applicant claimed that the widening of the bioequivalence range for raloxifene is justified due to 
the following: 
1) High variability of the drug: 
In-house data indicates that the C max intra-subject coefficient of variation for Evista® is greater than 
30%.  
2) Evidence demonstrating that raloxifene’s efficacy is not related to Cmax, and by the drug’s proven 
safety at relatively high doses: 
a. Efficacy: Administration of raloxifene with a standardized high fat meal increases Cmax by 28%. 
Despite this difference, the product monograph for raloxifene (Evista®) states that the drug can be 
given either with or without food, indicating that the efficacy of the drug is not related to its Cmax. 
b. Safety: A large, multinational placebo-controlled trial assessed the safety of 60 mg and 120 mg 
daily  doses  of  raloxifene  in  over  five  thousand  post-menopausal  women  for  36  months.  The 
majority of adverse events that occurred during the study were mild, and generally did not require 
discontinuation of therapy.

Safety was assessed based on the severity and causality of adverse events experienced by subjects who 
underwent drug administration.

No serious Adverse Events (AEs) were reported during the conduct of this study. A total of 51 AEs in 
26 subjects experienced over the course of the study. The AEs were mild in severity. A total of 33 AEs 
were  reported  following  the  administration  of  Test  product  and  the  most  common  AEs  were  blood 
creatinine increase (in 3 subjects), haemoglobin decrease (in 3 subjects) and haematocrit decrease (in 3 
subjects).  A  total  of  18  AEs  were  reported  following  the  administration  of  Evista®  and  the  most 
common AE was headache (in 3 subjects).  
  Conclusions 
The 90% confidence interval of the relative  mean raloxifene Cmax of the test to reference product is 
outside the 80-125% range. 
Study YY 
Methods 
Study design  
Study YY was an open-label, two-period, single-treatment study, designed to estimate the intra-subject 
variability  of  the  pharmacokinetic  parameters  AUCt,  AUCinf  and  Cmax  for  Evista®  after  single-dose 
administration to healthy female subjects under fasting conditions.  
Subjects  were  given  a  single  dose  of  Evista®  (raloxifene  hydrochloride)  60  mg  Tablets  on  two 
separate occasions under fasting conditions. In each period, an optional pre-study snack was provided 
to each subject after check-in and prior to fasting. Subjects fasted overnight for at least 10 hours prior 
to  drug  administration  and  for  at  least  4  hours  following  drug  administration.  The  washout  interval 
between successive drug administrations was 14 days. 
This  study  was  performed  by  qualified  investigators  in  a  clinical  facility  located  in    Canada.  The 
clinical  laboratory  facility  was  also  located  in  Canada.  The  Analytical,  Pharmacokinetic,  Statistical 
and Report Issuing facility was also located in Canada. 
The  clinical  study  protocol  No  YY  was  approved  by  the  Ethics  Committee  on  14/02/2008.    The 
clinical phase was performed in two periods. Subjects in period 1 were tested on 23/02/2008 and in 
period 2 on 08/03/2008. The analysis of the samples was conducted on 14/03/2008 and 19/03/2008 for 
period 1 and 2 respectively.

Test and reference products   
The Test product was Evista® 60 mg Tablets (Eli Lilly and Company Ltd., UK), expiration Date: 10-
2008  
Population(s) studied   
The  study  population  included  16  non-smoking,  post-menopausal  and/or  surgically  sterile  female 
volunteers between 18-65 years of age with a BMI between 19 and 30, who were judged to be healthy 
based  on  a  medical  history,  ECG,  laboratory  evaluation  and  physical  examination.  14  subjects 
completed  the  study  were  included  in  the  pharmacokinetic  and  statistical  analysis.  Subject  15  was 
excluded from the study after Period 1 dosing due to an adverse event (vomiting) and Subject 7 was 
excluded from the study prior to Period 2 check-in due to non-compliance. All the 16 subjects were 
included in the safety analysis.  
Analytical methods   
Plasma  concentrations  of  raloxifene  were  measured  by  validated  analytical  methods  (LC-MS/MS 
method).  Concentrations  of  raloxifene  were  measured  from  the  samples  collected  over  a  120-hour 
interval after dosing in each period. Protocol deviations were minor one and related to washout period, 
or samples were collected with one minute difference from the pre-specified time. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables  
Based on plasma raloxifene data the intra-subject variability of the pharmacokinetic parameters AUCt, 
AUCinf and Cmax was estimated.  
Statistical methods   
Descriptive statistics were estimated for the pharmacokinetic parameters in each treatment. Analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) was applied to log-transformed AUCt, AUCinf and Cmax and to untransformed 
Kel  and  T1/2  parameters.  The  significance  of  the  period  and  subject  effects  were  tested.  The  least 
square means, the differences between the period least square means and the corresponding standard 
errors  were  estimated  for  log-transformed  AUCt,  AUCinf  and  Cmax  parameters.  Based  on  these 
statistics,  the  ratios  of  the  geometric  means  for  each  period  and  the  corresponding  90%  confidence 
intervals were calculated. Values for the Tmax parameter were analyzed by a non-parametric approach.

Study ZZ 
Methods 
Study design  
Study  ZZ  was  a  two-treatment,  four-period,  replicate-design  crossover  study  in  the  fasted  state, 
designed  to  demonstrate  the  bioequivalence  of  Raloxifene  60  mg  Tablets  (Teva  Pharmaceutical 
Industries Ltd.) with the reference product, Evista® 60 mg Film Coated Tablets (Daiichi Sankyo UK 
Ltd., UK). 
The study products were administered as a single oral dose of 1 x 60 mg tablets of either the test or 
reference  formulation  after  an  overnight  fast  of  at  least  10  hours  prior  to  drug  administration.  The 
study  consisted  of  4  treatment  periods.  Patients  were  recruited  in  2  groups.  There  was  a  14  day 
washout period between the treatments. 
In each period, 25 blood samples from 24 time points were obtained. Each sample was 6 ml. Blood 
samples were collected at: 0(x2), 1, 2, 3, 4, 4.33, 4.67, 5, 5.33, 5.67, 6, 6.5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 16, 24, 36, 
48, 72, 96, and 120 hours. The washout between the start of each period was 2 weeks. 
This  study  was  performed  by  qualified  investigators  in  a  clinical  facility  located  in  Canada.  The 
clinical  laboratory  facility  was  also  located  in  Canada.  The  Analytical,  Pharmacokinetic,  Statistical 
and Report Issuing facility was also located in Canada. 
The clinical study protocol No ZZ was approved by the Ethics Committee on 23/07/2009. Amended 
study protocol was approved by the Ethics Committee on 28/07/2009.  
The  clinical  phase  was  performed  in  two  groups  and  4  periods.  Subjects  of  group  1  were  tested  on 
01/08/2009, 15/08/2009, 29/08/2009 and 12/09/20097 (periods 1,2,3 and 4 respectively). Subjects of 
group  2  were  dosed  on  23/08/2009,  6/09/2009,  20/09/2009  and  4/10/2009  (period  1,2,3  and  4 
respectively). The analysis of the samples was conducted in the period from 18/09/2009 to 28/09/2009 
for group 1 and in the period from 13/10/2009 to 15/10/2009 for group 2.  
The study was complying with GCP, as claimed by the applicant.

Population(s) studied   
The study enrolled 60 individuals who were randomised to sequences of either TRTR or RTRT (where 
T  denotes  test  and  R  denotes  reference)  and  any  subjects  who  completed  both  a  test  and  reference 
period were included in the analysis. Subject 04 was dismissed from the study prior to Period 4 dosing 
due  to  adverse  events  (out  of  range  mid-study  haematology  test  results).  Subject  51  voluntarily 
withdrew from the study prior to Period 4 check-in due to an adverse event (feeling tired) 
Subject 31 voluntarily withdrew from the study prior to Period 4 check-in for personal reasons. These 
subjects were included in the analysis. Subject 15 was dismissed from the study after Period 2 dosing 
due  to  adverse  events  (vomiting  and  loose  stool).  Measurements  were  taken  up  to  48  hours.  The 
subject  has  been  randomised  to  the  TRTR  sequence  The  study  population  included  non-smoking 
and/or light-smoking, post-menopausal and/or surgically sterile female volunteers from 18 to 65 years 
of age, with a BMI from 19 to 30, who were judged to be healthy based on a medical history, ECG, 
laboratory evaluation, and physical examination. 
Analytical methods   
Raloxifene  concentrations  were  measured  from  plasma  by  a  validated  analytical  method.  Subject 
plasma  concentrations  of  Raloxifene  were  measured  according  to  a  liquid  chromatographic  (LC) 
tandem  mass  spectrometric  detection  (MS/MS)  method  Plasma  samples  were  assayed  for  raloxifene 
according to the principles of Good Laboratory Practice. 
The validation of the analytical method is satisfactory. 
Deviations  in  blood  sampling  times  of  more  than  1  minute  were  reported.  Deviations  from  the 
scheduled  sampling  time  were  accounted  for  in  the  pharmacokinetic  calculations  since  the  actual 
sampling times were used. 
Pharmacokinetic Variables  
AUCt,  AUCinf,  Cmax,  Tmax,  Kel,  and  Thalf  were  estimated  based  on  raloxifene  plasma  levels  for 
each subject included in the data set. 
Statistical methods   
Descriptive statistics were estimated for the pharmacokinetic parameters in each treatment. A mixed 
model  was  applied  to  log-transformed  AUCt,  AUCinf,  Cmax  and  ANOVA  to  untransformed  Kel  and 
T1/2  parameters.  The  significance  of  the  group,  sequence-within-group,  period  within-  group, 
treatment, and treatment-within-group interaction were tested. 
The standard bioequivalence approach was followed in this study. The treatment least-squares means, 
the  differences  between  the  treatment  least-squares  means,  and  the  corresponding  standard  errors  of 
these  differences  were  estimated  for  log-transformed  AUCt,  AUCinf,  and  Cmax  parameters  were 
calculated.  Based  on  these  statistics,  the  ratios  of  the  geometric  means  for  treatments  and  the 
corresponding 90% confidence intervals were calculated. Values for the Tmax parameter were analyzed 
by a non-parametric approach. 
The Applicant stated that: “Since the within-subject variability for Cmax of the reference product was 
≥30%, the following criteria were used to evaluate the bioequivalence between the test and reference 
products”:

• The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean AUCt of the test to reference products should be 
between 80% and 125%. 
• The 90% confidence intervals of the relative mean Cmax of the test to reference products should be 
between 75% and 133%. 
Safety was assessed based on the severity and causality of adverse events experienced by subjects who 
underwent drug administration. 
Results 
Table 1. Pharmacokinetic parameters  
There  were  no  deaths  or  other  serious  AEs  reported  during  the  study.  Subjects  04,  15  &  51  were 
withdrawn due to adverse events. 
  Conclusions 
The 90% confidence interval of the relative  mean raloxifene C max of the test to reference product is 
within the 75-133% range. 
Based  on  the  presented  bioequivalence  study  Raloxifene  Teva  is  considered  bioequivalent  with 
Evista® 60 mg Film Coated Tablets.

Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.5 
Pharmacovigilance  
  PSUR 
The PSUR submission schedule should follow the PSUR schedule for the reference product. 
  Description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative requirements.  The company must ensure that this system is in place and functioning before 
the product is placed on the market. 
  Risk Management Plan 
The  application  is  based  on  a  reference  medicinal  product  for  which  no  safety  concerns  requiring 
specific risk minimization activities have been identified. 
Discussion on Clinical aspects 
The  overall  design  of  the  two  initially  submitted  studies  for  this  application  is  appropriate  and  the 
results have demonstrated bioequivalence for AUCs. However, in study XX the applicant selected a 
wider range for Cmax (75 – 133%). The justification presented was based on the demonstration of high 
intra-subject  variability  of  the  drug  in  Study  YY  as  claimed  by  applicant.  However,  the  estimated 
intra-subject coefficient of variation of plasma raloxifene for AUCt was 12.03%, for AUCinf 12.86% 
and  for  Cmax  30.37%.  No  confidence  interval  was  given  and  it  cannot  be  concluded  that  the  drug  is 
highly variable. Furthermore the two studies conducted were carried out on two different populations 
and  the  assumption  of  high  variability  can  not  be  extrapolated  to  the  pivotal  bioequivalence  study. 
Therefore  using  the  80-125%  CI  for  Cmax  showed  that  that  the  product  failed  to  demonstrate 
bioequivalence  with  the  reference  product  Evista®.  The  applicant  conducted  a  new  bioequivalence 
study (study ZZ) in order to address major concern. The applicant provided an acceptable trial design 
to demonstrate high variability and thus justify the widening of the acceptance limits to 75 – 133% for 
Cmax.  The  results  of  a  new  study  excluded  one  subject  from  the  estimation  of  Cmax,  despite  this 
subject provided data on Cmax for the first 2 periods. The applicant was requested to repeat the analysis 
for Cmax including subject 15. The inclusion of the data for Subject 15 changed the ratio for Cmax from 
84.49% (CI 78.23 - 91.26%) to 83.75% (CI 77.49 - 90.51%) which was still within the pre-specified 
CI of 75% - 133%. Therefore this has not altered final conclusion of bioequivalence. 
2.6  Overall conclusions, benefit/risk assessment and recommendation 
Overall conclusion and Benefit/risk assessment 
The  application  contains  adequate  quality,  non  clinical  and  clinical  data  has  been  shown.  A 
benefit/Risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded.  
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  available  data,  the  CHMP  considered  majority  decision  that  the 
benefit/risk ratio of Raloxifene Teva in the treatment of treatment and prevention of osteoporosis in 
postmenopausal  women  was  favourable  and  therefore  recommended  the  granting  of  the  marketing 
authorisation.

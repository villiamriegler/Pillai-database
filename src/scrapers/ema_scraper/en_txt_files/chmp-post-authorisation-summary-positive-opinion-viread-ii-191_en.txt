Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Viread 
tenofovir disoproxil 
On 28 February 2019, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending a change to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Viread. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is Gilead Sciences Ireland UC. 
The CHMP adopted an extension to the existing indication for Viread 123 mg, 163 mg and 204 mg 
film-coated tablets as follows:2 
“HIV-1 infection 
… indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products for the treatment of
HIV-1 infected paediatric patients, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding the use of first line 
agents, aged 6 to < 12 years who weigh from 28 kg to less than 35 kg. 
The choice of Viread to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection should be 
based on individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. 
Hepatitis B infection 
… indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in paediatric patients aged
6 to < 12 years who weigh from 28 kg to less than 35 kg, with: 
•
compensated  liver  disease  and  evidence  of  immune  active  disease,  i.e.  active  viral
replication  and  persistently  elevated  serum  ALT  levels  or  histological  evidence  of
moderate  to  severe  inflammation  and/or  fibrosis.  With  respect  to  the  decision  to
initiate treatment in paediatric patients, see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.”
The CHMP also adopted an extension to the existing indication for Viread 33 mg/g granules as follows:3

“HIV-1 infection 
Viread 33 mg/g granules are indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal products 
for the treatment of HIV-1 infected paediatric patients, with NRTI resistance or toxicities precluding 
the use of first line agents, from 2 to < 6 years of age, and above 6 years of age for whom a solid 
dosage form is not appropriate. 
Viread 33 mg/g granules are also indicated in combination with other antiretroviral medicinal 
products for the treatment of HIV-1 infected adults for whom a solid dosage form is not appropriate. 
In adults, the demonstration of the benefit of Viread in HIV-1 infection is based on results of one 
study in treatment-naïve patients, including patients with a high viral load (> 100,000 copies/ml) 
and studies in which Viread was added to stable background therapy (mainly tritherapy) in 
antiretroviral pre-treated patients experiencing early virological failure (< 10,000 copies/ml, with 
the majority of patients having < 5,000 copies/ml). 
The choice of Viread to treat antiretroviral-experienced patients with HIV-1 infection should be 
based on individual viral resistance testing and/or treatment history of patients. 
Hepatitis B infection 
Viread 33 mg/g granules are indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adults for whom a 
solid dosage form is not appropriate with: 
• 
• 
• 
compensated liver disease, with evidence of active viral replication, persistently elevated serum 
alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels and histological evidence of active inflammation and/or 
fibrosis (see section 5.1). 
evidence of lamivudine-resistant hepatitis B virus (see sections 4.8 and 5.1). 
decompensated liver disease (see sections 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1). 
Viread 33 mg/g granules are also indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B in adolescents 
paediatric patients  12 2 to < 18 years of age for whom a solid dosage form is not appropriate 
with: 
• 
compensated liver disease and evidence of immune active disease, i.e. active viral replication, 
and persistently elevated serum ALT levels, or histological evidence of moderate to severe 
inflammation and/or fibrosis. With respect to the decision to initiate treatment in paediatric 
patients, see sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1.” 
No change is made to the indication for Viread 245 mg film-coated tablets. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

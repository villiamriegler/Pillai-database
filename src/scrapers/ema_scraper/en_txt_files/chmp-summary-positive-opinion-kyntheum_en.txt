Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Kyntheum 
brodalumab 
On 18 May 2017, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Kyntheum, 
intended for the treatment of psoriasis. The applicant for this medicinal product is LEO Pharma A/S. 
Kyntheum will be available as a 210 mg solution for injection. The active substance of Kyntheum is 
brodalumab, an interleukin inhibitor (ATC code: L04AC12). Brodalumab is a recombinant fully human 
monoclonal immunoglobulin IgG2 antibody that binds with high affinity to human IL-17RA and blocks the 
biological activities of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17A/F heterodimer and IL-25. 
The benefits with Kyntheum are its ability to inhibit the inflammation and clinical symptoms associated 
with psoriasis. The most common side effects are arthralgia, headache, fatigue, diarrhoea, and 
oropharyngeal pain. 
The full indication is: “Kyntheum is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in 
adult patients who are candidates for systemic therapy.” 
Kyntheum is intended for use under the guidance and supervision of a physician experienced in the 
diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis.  
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

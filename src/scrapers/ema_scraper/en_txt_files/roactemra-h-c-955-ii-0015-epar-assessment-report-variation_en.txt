1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introduction 
Tocilizumab (TCZ), the active substance of RoActemra, in combination with methotrexate (MTX), is 
indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe active rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in adult patients 
who have either responded inadequately to, or who were intolerant to, previous therapy with one or 
more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) or tumour necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists. 
In these patients, RoActemra can be given as monotherapy in case of intolerance to MTX or where 
continued treatment with MTX is inappropriate. RoActemra has been shown to reduce the rate of 
progression of joint damage as measured by X-ray and to improve physical function when given in 
combination with methotrexate.  
Systemic idiopathic juvenile arthritis (sJIA) is a subtype of juvenile idiopathic arthritis characterised by 
systemic manifestations of disease in addition to arthritis. It occurs at all ages with some predilection 
for children less than 5 years of age. Currently JIA is diagnosed with a minimum disease duration of 6 
weeks. There are no pathognomonic features for sJAI but diagnosis is usually made after 2 weeks of 
daily high fever spikes, transient rash, importantly development of arthritis may lag behind by months. 
Other manifestations of disease are hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy and serositis. sJIA 
accounts for 10-20% of all JIA cases.  
Important complications of the disease are disability, osteoporosis, growth retardation, secondary 
amyloidosis and anaemia. A life-threatening complication occurring in about 5% of cases is the so-
called macrophage-activation syndrome (MAS) which is an overwhelming systemic inflammatory 
reaction. 
About 50% of patients develop an unremitting course; about a quarter of patients develop severe 
arthritis with significant disability. 
Currently there are no authorized medicinal products indicated in the treatment of sJIA in the European 
Union. Treatment for sJIA is mainly empirical, there are few controlled trials. Treatment options 
encompass non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs but are usually not sufficient and high dose 
glucocorticoids are added initially and for exacerbations. Because of the known side effects of 
glucocorticoid treatment methotrexate is recommended as disease modifying therapy although it 
appears to be less effective than in oligoarticular and polyarticular JIA. Azathioprine is less commonly 
used. Cyclosporine A and thalidomide have also been reported to be efficacious in patients with 
ongoing disease activity despite treatment with glucocorticoids and MTX. Etanercept is approved for 
polyarticular JIA but appears to have markedly lower efficacy in sJIA it and therefore has no indication 
in sJIA (registry study, Ann Rheum Dis. 2004;63:1638–44). Adalimumab is approved for polyarticular 
JIA and used off-label for sJIA, Anakinra is currently used off-label and uncontrolled studies support its 
use, clinical studies are ongoing for canakinumab. Patients with refractory disease have been subjected 
to autologous stem cell transplantation.  
The initially applied wording for extension of indication reads as follows: 
“RoActemra is indicated for the treatment of active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in 
patients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with one or 
more NSAIDs and systemic corticosteroids. RoActemra can be given as monotherapy or in combination 
with MTX”. 
Furthermore, the MAH requested consideration of this application under Article 14(11) of Regulation 
(EC) No 726/2004 and submitted a justification that the application concerns a new therapeutic 
indication which is claimed to bring a significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies.

The applicant received Scientific Advice from the CHMP on 24 May 2007. The Scientific Advice 
pertained to clinical aspects of the dossier.  
The main study supporting this application (WA18221), which was designed to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of tocilizumab in paediatric patients with active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, was 
subject to an agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as amended, the application included an EMA 
decision (P/71/2010) on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP) with a deferral. 
The PIP is not yet completed. 
The CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
1.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
No additional non-clinical pharmacology investigations have been performed to support the use of 
tocilizumab in the paediatric indication of sJIA. Additional information elaborated in the context of a 
toxicity study in juvenile mice with the rat IgG surrogate antibody to tocilizumab, MR16-1 was 
provided. 
This nonclinical study in juvenile animals was conducted in accordance with GLP. 
Toxicology 
Dose Finding Study for Juvenile Toxicity Study of MR16-1 by Intravenous Administration in 
Mice (Report No. 1019245) 
This study aimed to evaluate an appropriate dosing regimen, in terms of systemic exposure, for a 
subsequent toxicity study of MR16-1 in juvenile mice. Dosages of 15- (either as a constant dose or 
preceded by a single loading doses of 50- and 100-mg/kg) and 50-mg/kg (constant dose) were 
administered intravenously once every three days from postnatal day 22 (up to 7 doses) to 9 male and 
9 female Crlj:CD1 (ICR) juvenile mice per dose group. Systemic exposure to MR16-1 and anti-drug 
antibodies were assessed at 72 hours after the first, third and seventh doses. 
In the dose finding study, it was concluded that the dosing regimen for the high dose group for the 
subsequent main toxicity study of MR16-1 in juvenile mice should be a constant dosing of 50-mg/kg 
and that for the low dose group should be 15-mg/kg accompanied with a loading dose of 50-mg/kg. 
A Toxicity Study to Evaluate the Effects of MR16-1 on Postnatal Development and Growth in 
Juvenile Mice (Report No. 1019259) 
Since tocilizumab does not cross-react with the rodent IL-6 receptor, a juvenile toxicity study was 
conducted in mice using a murine surrogate antibody for tocilizumab, MR16-1. This juvenile toxicity 
study focused on immunocompetence, skeletal development and sexual maturation under inhibition of 
IL-6 signaling. 
In this study, dosages of 0, 15- (preceded by a single loading dose of 50-mg/kg) and 50-mg/kg 
(constant dose) of MR16-1 were administered intravenously once every 3 days from after weaning 
(postnatal day 22) until postnatal day 79 (11 weeks old and sexually mature) to Crlj:CD1 (ICR)

juvenile mice (12 males and 12 females in the main toxicity and satellite groups); in order to assess 
the reversibility of any signs of toxicity during a 50-day recovery period 6 males and 6 females in the 
main recovery and satellite recovery groups were included. Systemic exposure of MR16-1 and anti-
drug-antibodies were measured in separate toxicokinetics groups (first, seventh, thirteenth and final 
dosing, and on days 20 and 50 of recovery) and in satellite group animals at necropsy. 
In the 15-mg/kg group which received a single loading dose of 50-mg/kg, MR16-1 concentrations 
increased gradually after repeated doses in comparison with those after the first dose. The exposure in 
this group was rather stable without any indication for loss in exposure due to an immune response 
against MR16-1. The MR16-1 concentration on day 20 of recovery decreased in comparison with those 
72 hours after the final dosing. On day 50 of recovery, the concentrations found were below the lower 
limit of quantification in all samples.  
In the 50-mg/kg group, MR16-1 concentrations on day 20 of recovery decreased in comparison with 
those 72 hours after the final dosing. Two of the three samples from males on day 50 of recovery were 
BLOQ, and the remainder of samples were close to the BLOQ.  
For the satellite groups, MR16-1 concentrations 72 hours after the final dosing and on day 50 of 
recovery were comparable to those for the toxicokinetics group. There was no difference in exposure 
levels between sexes. 
A summary of toxicokinetic parameters in toxicokinetics group is stated in the below table: 
In the anti-MR16-1 antibody analysis, none of the samples for the 15- or 50-mg/kg group during 
dosing period showed positive reactions for anti-MR16-1 antibodies. On day 20 of recovery, 1 of the 3 
females in the 15-mg/kg group was positive for anti-MR16-1 antibodies. On day 50 of recovery, 1 of 
the 6 females for the 15-mg/kg satellite recovery group and 1 of the 6 males for the 50-mg/kg satellite 
recovery group were positive for anti-MR16-1 antibodies. None of the other samples for the 15- or 50-
mg/kg group after the completion of dosing period showed positive reactions for anti-MR16-1 
antibodies. 
No animal died, and no abnormality was observed in clinical signs in any treatment group during the 
dosing or recovery period. 
No adverse effects were observed in body weight, food consumption, necropsy, organ weights or 
histopathology in any treatment group during the dosing or recovery period.

With respect to sexual maturation and skeletal development in juvenile animals, there were no adverse 
effects on the morphological differentiation of external genitalia, estrous cycle, sperm examination, 
crown-rump length, or skeletal development in any treatment group. 
Determinations of lymphocyte subsets revealed some evidence for treatment related changes. In 
haematology, low monocyte values in females in the 50- and 15-mg/kg groups were observed at the 
end of dosing period. The values seemed to be within the ranges of physiological changes and the 
control background data. 
Low glucose values were observed in males and females in the 15- and 50-mg/kg groups at the end of 
dosing and recovery periods. Furthermore, in the 15- and 50-mg/kg groups, high globulin and α2-
globulin values, and low β-globulin and A/G values were observed in males and females at the end of 
dosing periods. In addition, high values in A/G, and low values in α2-globulin were observed in males 
at end of recovery period in the 50-mg/kg groups. These changes were likely due to the detection of 
MR16-1, an IgG1 antibody, together with the peak of α2-globulin. It is evident that the presence of 
such an antibody interferes with the assay format. Therefore, these changes were not considered to 
indicate toxicity. 
In the 15- and 50-mg/kg groups, decreases in CD3e+CD4+CD8a− and CD3e+, and increases in 
CD45R/B220+ and CD49b/Pan-NK cells+CD3e− were observed in immunophenotyping in peripheral 
blood in males and females at the end of dosing and recovery periods. In these groups, an increase in 
CD45R/B220+ in immunophenotyping in spleen was also noted in females at the end of recovery 
period.  
For determination of functionality of NK cells one-third of the spleen was minced, and cell suspension 
(effector cell) from the spleen was prepared. Functional determination of NK cell activity and 
immunocompetence (serum IgG and IgM production to KLH) did not yield any recognizable effect of 
treatment with MR16-1.  
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In accordance with the CHMP guidance EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00, proteins are exempted because 
they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the environment. Tocilizumab, the active ingredient in 
RoActemra, is a protein (monoclonal antibody). Therefore, an ERA is not provided in this variation 
application. This is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
An additional safety study for assessment of effects in juvenile mice treated intravenously with a 
murine surrogate antibody for tocilizumab, MR16-1, from weaning until sexual maturity was 
conducted. The doses used in the study were defined in a dose-finding study.  
Anti-drug antibody studies revealed that that there was maximal pharmacological efficacy maintained 
over the whole study duration at both doses of MR16-1 in this pivotal safety study. 
Determinations of lymphocyte subsets revealed some evidence for treatment related changes after end 
of dosing and at the end of recovery but did not result in any changes on the capacity of the immune 
system regarding NK cell activity or to mount an IgG or IgM mediated immunization response. 
Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
MR16-1 did not induce any toxicologically meaningful changes on postnatal development and growth, 
skeletal development, and sexual maturation to juvenile animals. Changes in lymphocyte subsets were 
Assessment report for  
EMA/455878/2011  
Page 5/72
 
 
 
observed under treatment. Further non-clinical studies to address whether these changes will recover 
are not expected since the MAH demonstrated that the changes did not impact the functional immune 
response. Overall the results did not yield evidence for a toxicologically impact of IL-6R signalling 
inhibition on the development of mice treated from weaning until full sexual maturity.

1.3.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Paediatric PK data derive from the studies WA18221, LRO320, MRA011JP and MRA316JP. 
In study WA18221 blood samples for PK (TCZ serum concentrations) and PD (IL-6, sIL-6R) were 
collected at pre-dose and post-dose (end of infusion) on Day 1 and at Weeks 2, 4 and 10, pre-dose at 
Weeks 6, 8, and 12 and at anytime during the week at Weeks 1 and 11. Anti-TCZ antibodies were 
collected at Baseline (pre-dose on Day 1) and at Week 12. 
All patients who had at least one quantifiable TCZ serum concentration were included in the PK 
analysis. The observed TCZ concentrations over time were summarized using summary statistics. 
Nonlinear mixed effects modelling (using NOMMEM version 6) was used to analyze the serum TCZ 
concentration-time data collected over 12 weeks of treatment. The primary PK parameters were 
clearances and volumes of distribution. Systemic exposure, defined as the area under the serum 
concentration-time profile (AUC2weeks at Week 12), Cmax concentration post infusion and Cmin 
concentration at end of a dosing interval (at Week 12) were estimated for all patients who had 
provided samples. 
For all patients, the pos-hoc PK estimated exposure parameters (AUC2weeks, Cmin and Cmax) at Week 
12 were summarized using descriptive statistics. These exposure parameters were also summarized by 
sex, age category (2-5 years, 6-12 years, 13-18 years), treatment group (8 mg/kg, 12 mg/kg), four 
exposure quartiles (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4), JIA ACR30/50/70/90 response status at Week 12, patients with 
fever at baseline but free of fever at Week 12, and anti-TCZ antibody assay result (positive, negative). 
Quartiles were defined as those patients falling within 0 - ≤ 25%, >25 - ≤50%, >50 - ≤75%, and 
>75-100% of exposures.  
Results 
All PK and PK-PD outputs were based on the PK population (n=75) and all PD outputs were based on 
the Safety population (n=112). All study treatment groups were summarized in PD outputs. However, 
in PK, PK-PD, PK-efficacy and PK safety outputs, only those patients randomized to TCZ were 
presented as they were exposed to active treatment (n=75). 
The mean (± SD) serum tocilizumab concentration time profile by treatment group in study WA18221 
is shown in the below figure:

Posthoc estimated PK exposures (AUC2weeks, Cmin and Cmax) by respective exposure quartiles are 
displayed in Table 1. 
Table 1 Summary of tocilizumab PK parameters at week 12 for all patients 
Because of the twice as frequent dosing compared to adults higher exposure is reached. The exposure 
is approximately twice as high as in adults as regards AUCss and the Cmin is about 7fold higher (adult 
9.7 µg/ml, 69.5 µg/ml). PK/PD/efficacy analyses indicate that the current dose is in the plateau phase 
of the dose/efficacy curve.  
Pharmacodynamics 
PK-PD Relationships 
Quantitative immunoglobulin levels, serum IL-6, sIL-6R, human serum CRP, ESR, and SAA from 
WA18221 were summarized graphically and descriptively. 
The relationship between TCZ serum concentration and PD markers over 12 weeks of treatment for all 
who received TCZ treatment is displayed in the following figure: 
Relationship of tocilizumab PK and mean PD markers in all patients who received tocilizumab 
Following administration of TCZ, the mean concentration of IL-6 increased rapidly and subsequently 
declined gradually trending toward baseline. Mean sIL-6R increased rapidly at Week 2 and continued to 
increase, approaching a plateau through Week 12 as the TCZ concentration approached a steady state. 
Markers of inflammation (ESR and CRP) rapidly declined by Week 2 following administration of TCZ and 
persisted at low levels through Week 12. 
Scatter plots of TCZ Cmin (posthoc estimated Cmin at Week 12) values and CRP are shown in the 
following figure: 
Assessment report for  
EMA/455878/2011  
Page 9/72
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Relationship of tocilizumab Cmin and CRP (WA18221, N = 75) 
CRP was low when the Cmin was above 10 μg/mL. There was no appreciable relationship between the 
TCZ Cmin value and IL-6 concentrations, but IL-6 concentrations were generally low as long as the 
TCZ concentration was above 20 μg/mL, except for a few outliers. In contrast, sIL-6R was elevated 
when the Cmin value was above 10 μg/mL. 
PK-Efficacy Relationship 
A summary of percentage of patients achieving JIA ACR30 and absence of fever response status at 
Week 12 by exposure quartiles is displayed in the Table 2: 
Table  2  Summary  of  Percentage  of  Patients  Achieving  JIA  ACR30  and  Absence  of  Fever 
Response Status at Week 12 by Exposure Quartiles 
Percentages are based on n in each quartile. 
Responders  are  patients  who  had  a  JIA  ACR30  response  at  Week  12  and  absence  of  fever  (temperatures  <37.5C)  in  the  7  days 
preceding the Week 12 assessment day. 
There  was  no  clear  trend  toward  higher  PK  exposures  (AUC2weeks,  Cmin,  and  Cmax)  in  responders 
compared  to  non-responders  considering  the  considerable  overlap.  There  was  a  similar  proportion  of 
patients  within  each  exposure  quartile  who  achieved  the  primary  endpoint,  ACR30  response  and 
absence of fever at week 12. 
PK-Safety Relationships 
A  summary  of  PK  exposures  (AUC2weeks,  Cmin,  and  Cmax)  by  the  worst  Neutrophil  CTC  Grade 
experienced up to Week 12 for all patients is displayed in the following Table 3: 
Assessment report for  
EMA/455878/2011  
Page 10/72
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 3 Summary of TCZ PK Exposures by the Worst Neutrophil CTC Grade Experienced up to 
Week 12 for All Patients 
No patients had reported neutrophil CTC grade 4. Mean exposures (AUC2 weeks, Cmin and Cmax) were 
similar between patients with grades 0 (n=59 across treatment groups) and 2 (n=10 across treatment 
groups). The mean exposures for the 5 patients with CTC grade 3 were somewhat higher at 1672 μg x 
day/mL, 75.8 μg/mL, and 257 μg/mL compared with CTC grade 0 at 1313 μg x day/mL, 56.2 μg/mL, 
and 243 μg/mL, for AUC2weeks, Cmin and Cmax, respectively. 
There is no clear exposure effect relationship. Further analysis of the data indicates that tocilizumab 
exposure is in the plateau phase of the exposure-response relationship. It is unclear at present if this 
higher exposure is required for therapeutic efficacy.  
Data from the trial MRA316JP (see efficacy section) seemed to indicate that JIA ACR 50 response was 
lower in patients with lower body weight, therefore the alternative dosing for children <30 kg was 
developed. Of note MRA316JP evaluated efficacy at week 6, steady state was not reached at this 
timepoint. Data from the WA18221 indicate that exposure is considerably higher in children compared 
to adults therefore the initial assumptions were not confirmed. 
Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Data from trials LRO320, MRA011JP, MRA316JP were used to model and justify the doses used for the 
pivotal trial. Modelling led to the selection of the 12 mg/kg dose for patients <30 kg and the 8 mg/kg 
dose for patients >30 kg.  
The chosen doses in the two groups defined by weight show comparable exposure and the body-weight 
dosing regimen is acceptable. The higher dosing frequency leads to a two fold higher AUC and a 7 fold 
higher Cmin compared to the adult RA population.  
PD markers (CRP, ESR, SAA) indicate that the dosing result in an effect that is in the plateau phase of 
the dose-effect curve. The lack of a clear correlation of neutrophil count with exposure may simply be 
due to the short study duration and the low patient number treated but could also indicate that even 
the lowest exposure has the full effect. In the adult population this relationship is rather clear and 
there is no good reason to believe that this is different in children. In addition baseline values for 
neutrophils were higher in the paediatric population; even a considerable drop would lead to 
normalisation. As corticosteroids also induce neutrophilia it is possible that the neutropenia will become 
apparent in the long term study if further reduction of corticosteroid dose is possible. 
The MAH was requested to further justify the proposed posology and discuss further plans to 
investigate lower doses in the initial therapy phase. The MAH explained in detail the data which lead to 
the more frequent dosing regimen of 2 weekly doses of 8 mg/kg in the sJIA population. The rationale is 
comprehensible and was based on the assumption of a higher CL in children estimated from data of a 
small number of children. However, the predicted 4-5 fold higher clearance for the sJIA population was 
not confirmed in the WA18221 study. The proposed SmPC section 5.2 a level of 0.14 ml/h/kg is given 
as linear CL in the sJIA population. This agrees to the CL in RA adults of 12.5 ml/h which corresponds 
Assessment report for  
EMA/455878/2011  
Page 11/72
 
 
 
 
 
to 0.18 ml/h/kg in a 70 kg adult. Thus, the higher TCZ levels in children compared to adults are due 
the doubling of the dosing frequency and not due to 'different PK properties in the two diseases'. 
From the PK/PD evaluation it is clear that PD markers respond rapidly i.e. already after the first dose if 
viewed on the population level, as demonstrated and argued by the MAH because of inter-individual 
variability of PK this will not always be the case for the individual. However, given that the majority 
show an immediate PD response one would therefore conclude that AUC/concentration that is achieved 
after first dosing is sufficient. This would imply that for continued dosing a lower dose would likely be 
sufficient, as most antibodies reach steady state only after a prolonged time (caused by long half-life 
and infrequent dosing). This would argue for a first dose/maintenance dosing concept for the 
treatment.  
The CHMP acknowledged the proposed dose regimen as reasonable for treatment initiation given the 
favourable benefit/risk appraisal based on the available data in this severe and rare condition. 
Importantly however, the MAH will investigate lower doses for maintenance of therapy, which will be 
followed-up post-authorisation. In this context the MAH has presented a detailed and comprehensive 
description of the amendment of the WA18221 part III protocol which includes the investigation of the 
feasibility of less frequent dosing of TCZ in the sJIA population. The proposed alternative flexible 
dosing schedule is considered appropriate to be explored. The MAH will provide interim results with 
PSURs to monitor the appropriateness of the treatment recommendations, and to submit the clinical 
study report by February 2015.  
The MAH will perform a study to investigate the possibility of dose reduction for AE (thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, liver enzyme abnormalities) in sJIA patients as detailed in the RMP. This study will collect 
data on efficacy, PD as well as safety upon reduction of dose in patients that have achieved a clinical 
response (defined by JIA-ACR) but are experiencing above mentioned AE (see safety section).  
As the assay for the detection of anti-drug antibodies is sensitive to presence of tocilizumab this higher 
drug concentrations could lead to an underestimation of anti-drug antibodies in children compared to 
adults. 
Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetic behaviour in children appears to be comparable to adults. The finding of the most 
appropriate dose for this population is largely dependant on modelling; children have a higher 
exposure compared to adults. The proposed dosing regimen is considered acceptable based on the 
available data. It remains to be demonstrated in long-term clinical trials if the high exposure obtained 
is required for the maintenance of pharmacodynamic effect and ultimately efficacy. The MAH has 
presented a detailed plan for further investigating a reduction of dose once the desired therapeutic 
response has been achieved; the approach as detailed in the RMP (WA18221 part III protocol) is 
endorsed by the CHMP. 
1.3.2.  Clinical efficacy 
Evidence for the efficacy of TCZ in patients with sJIA is based on the ongoing pivotal Phase III study, 
WA18221, which includes data from the first 12 weeks of treatment (Part 1). Supportive information 
comes from a controlled Phase III study, MRA316JP. Long-term efficacy data are also available from 
the extension study MRA317JP (patients enrolled from studies MRA011JP and MRA316JP) and the 
expanded access study (MRA324JP).

Main studies 
Pivotal study WA18221: 12-week randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group, 2-
arm study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients with active systemic juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (sJIA); with a 92-week single arm open-label extension to examine the long term 
use of tocilizumab, followed by a 3 year open label continuation of the study to examine the long term 
use of tocilizumab. 
Methods 
WA18221 is a pivotal Phase III, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled, parallel group, multi-
center, 2-arm study in three parts in paediatric patients with active sJIA who have had an inadequate 
clinical response to NSAIDs and corticosteroids due to toxicity or lack of efficacy. The first part of the 
study was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of TCZ for 12 weeks compared to placebo. 
Patients who completed Part I of the study had the option to enter into the Part II active treatment 
part of the study where all patients would receive open-label TCZ (8 mg/kg or 12 mg/kg depending on 
weight). Patients who entered escape during Part I and who were benefiting from receiving TCZ were 
also able to enter Part II. 
The protocol offered an escape option in the placebo controlled phase. Criteria for entering escape 
were the following:  
-  Symptomatic serositis (requiring CS increase above Baseline CS dose for >14 consecutive days 
or ever requiring prednisone dose >30 mg/day or 0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone equivalent to 
control the serositis);  
Persistence of fever for at least 3 consecutive days of more than 38°C, not due to infection;  
JIA ACR30 flare compared to Baseline; 
- 
- 
-  Any recurrence of symptomatic serositis 
Persistent or worsening disease from baseline constitutes an acceptable reason for offering escape in 
this ill population.

Study Participants 
The key inclusion criteria were: 
  Age 2 up to and including 17 years at screening into trial; 
  Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis according to ILAR classification (2001); 
  More than 6 months of documented persistent sJIA activity prior to screening (not requiring 6 
months from formal diagnosis) including an inadequate response to NSAIDs and corticosteroids 
due to toxicity or lack of efficacy. 
 
Presence of active disease as determined by the presence of : 
o  ≥5 active joints at screening and baseline, (with sufficient diary temperature entries to 
appropriately identify the presence or absence of fever, 14 days of temperature 
recordings required) or  
o  ≥2 active joints at screening and baseline and fever >38°C for at least 5 out of any 14 
consecutive days during screening and receiving prednisone or equivalent at a stable 
dose at no more than 0.5 mg/kg/day or 30 mg/day, whichever is less. During this 
same time period the corticosteroid dose continues unchanged. Under these 
circumstances a patient does not need to complete a full 14 days of temperature diary 
entries to meet this inclusion criteria. 
  hsCRP >4.3 mg/L (1.5 x ULN (ULN= 0.28 mg/dl)); 
  Recovered from any symptomatic serositis for at least one month prior to the screening visit, and 
requiring dose of corticosteroids ≤ 30 mg/day or 0.5 mg/kg/day, whichever is less, at baseline 
  Must meet one of the following: 
o  not receiving MTX, or discontinued MTX at least 4 weeks prior to baseline visit, -or- 
o 
taking MTX for at least 12 weeks immediately prior to the baseline visit and on a stable 
dose of ≤20 mg/m2 for at least 8 weeks prior to the baseline visit, together with either 
folic acid or folinic acid according to local standard of care. 
  Not currently receiving oral corticosteroids, or taking oral corticosteroids at a stable dose for a 
minimum of 2 weeks prior to the baseline visit at no more than 30 mg/day or 0.5 mg/kg/day 
whichever is less; 
  Not taking NSAIDs, or taking no more than 1 type of NSAID at a stable dose for a minimum of  
2 weeks prior to the baseline visit and is less than or equal to the maximum recommended daily 
dose; 
Concomitant treatment with NSAIDs, MTX and corticosteroids was allowed, other DMARDs 
(leflunomide, cyclophosphamide, etoposide, hydroxychloroquine, gold, azathioprine, sulfasalazine, 
cyclosporine, thalidomide, penicillamine) and biologics (etanercept, anakinra, abatacept, infliximab, 
adalimumab) were not permitted.  
Treatments 
In the TCZ group, patients <30 kg received a dose of 12 mg/kg and patients ≥30 kg received a dose 
of 8 mg/kg every two weeks for six doses. In Part I of the study, the dose assigned at baseline could 
not be adjusted for any changes (gain or loss) in body weight (BW) (<30 kg to/from ≥30 kg). 
Patients could have corticosteroid tapered following predefined tapering guidelines at Week 6 and/or 
Week 8 if they acquired a JIA American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 70 response, had a normal 
ESR and absence of fever prior to taper. CS reduction was not permitted at Week 10.

Sample size 
Based on literature data, a JIA ACR30 response at Week 12 of 70% in patients on TCZ and of 40% for 
patients on placebo was assumed for sample size calculation. It was calculated that about 108 patients 
(72  TCZ,  36  placebo)  would  provide  approximately 80%  power  to  detect  such  a  treatment  difference 
between both treatments using a two-sided chi-square test with α=0.05. 
The sample size calculation was considered as acceptable by the CHMP. 
Randomisation 
Patients were randomized 2:1 to receive either TCZ or placebo respectively. Randomisation was 
stratified by body weight, disease duration, background CS dose and background MTX use. 
Methods for randomisation were considered as acceptable by the CHMP. 
Blinding (masking) 
This is double blind study. 
Statistical methods 
Dichotomized variables (e.g. responder) were compared between TCZ and placebo by means of a 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. In case of responder analyses, patients who withdrew or escaped were 
classed as non-responders. To compare TCZ versus placebo with respect to continuous variables, 
analysis of variance was used. All analyses models accounted for the stratification factors at 
randomisation. Comparison between each of the TCZ groups and placebo were done descriptively only. 
Statistical tests were decided for α = 0.05 (2-sided). To control the Type I error, secondary endpoints 
were hierarchically ordered and were tested in a pre-defined sequential order. If the sequence was 
broken, no confirmatory claims could be based on the endpoints that had a rank lower than that 
endpoint whose null hypothesis was the first that could not be rejected. Treatment effects were 
described by point estimates including the corresponding 95% confidence intervals. 
Various patient baseline characteristics were used to define subgroups for exploratory subgroup 
analyses (e.g. sex, age, ethnicity, region, number of joints with active arthritis, ESR etc). 
In general statistical methods applied were considered as acceptable by the CHMP.

Results  
Participant flow  
Recruitment 
A total of 112 patients were enrolled at 43 centers in 17 countries including Argentina, Australia, 
Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, Germany, United Kingdom, Greece, Italy, Mexico, 
Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Slovakia, Spain, and United States. 
The first patient was screened on 9 May 2008, the last patient completed week 12 assessment on 2 
September 2009.  
Conduct of the study 
The protocol was amended once; all patients had been recruited and completed week 6 assessments 
before the amendment was put into place.  
The majority of changes were clarifications and are considered uncritical. The inclusion criteria were 
changed even though all patients had already been included. Thus the inclusion criteria of protocol 
version A define the study population and this may impact external validity.  
Baseline data 
The demographic characteristics at Baseline in the placebo group and the all TCZ group were similar. 
In each treatment group, patients were evenly split between male and female patients and they were 
predominately Caucasian. As expected as a result of the two different doses < or ≥BW 30 kg, the 
mean age, BW, height, and body surface area (BSA) were higher in the TCZ 8 mg/kg group in 
comparison to the TCZ 12 mg/kg group. However, these characteristics were similar between the all 
TCZ group and the placebo group.

Demographic characteristics (ITT population) 
sJIA Disease Characteristics 
sJIA disease characteristics at baseline included fever and rash status, previous use of DMARDs, 
previous use of biologics, CRP, and articular and extraarticular damage. The disease characteristics 
between the placebo and the TCZ group were similar except for a higher proportion of patients with 
rash (in the 14 days prior to Baseline) in the placebo group (48.6%) compared with the all TCZ group 
(29.3%). Baseline CRP was lower in the placebo group (mean 95.6 mg/L and median 77.2 mg/L) in 
comparison with the all TCZ group (mean 200.4 mg/L and median 115.6 mg/L). However, three 
patients including two in the TCZ 8 mg/kg (1651 and 1373) and one in the TCZ 12 mg/kg group 
(1372) had very high CRP values that distorted the mean/median summary statistics. 
Fever, an important systemic symptom in sJIA, was present (in the 7 days prior to Baseline) in 
approximately 50% of patients. As expected as a result of the two different doses < or ≥ BW 30 kg, 
the mean number of previous DMARDs and biologics, and Tanner Stage were higher in the TCZ 8 
mg/kg group in comparison to the TCZ 12 mg/kg group. However, these characteristics were similar 
between the all TCZ group and the placebo group (Table 4).

JIA ACR Core Set Components 
All six of the JIA ACR core components at Baseline were similar between the placebo and all TCZ 
groups, although the mean values were slightly higher in the TCZ patients indicating a higher disease 
burden (Table 5).

Randomization Stratification Variables 
The results of the randomisation are provided in Table 6. Across all patients there was an even split 
(50/50) in the categories of BW, duration of disease and background oral CS dose. However, use of 
background MTX was high at 70% of the patients.

Numbers analysed 
Analysis was according to the ITT principle. In the placebo group 36/37 patients, in the 8 mg/kg 36/37 
patients and in the 12 mg/kg 37/38 patients reached the 12 week endpoint. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Endpoint 
Twenty-eight patients treated with TCZ 8 mg/kg and 36 TCZ 12 mg/kg patients met the primary 
endpoint, the proportions were contrasting with 75.7% and 94.7% of patients in the respective groups 
(Table 7).

JIA ACR Core Components 
An analysis of variance of the percentage change from Baseline in the JIA ACR core set components at 
Week 12 with the all TCZ vs. placebo patients and adjusted for the randomization stratification factors 
applied at Baseline is shown in (Table 9). 
The adjusted mean percentage change from Baseline in number of joints with active arthritis at Week 
12 was significantly decreased in the patients treated with TCZ compared to those treated with 
placebo(TCZ = -70.6% vs placebo = -37.2%; p = 0.0012).

JIA ACR Response and Oral CS Modifications 
Of the 31 placebo and 70 TCZ patients receiving oral CSs at Baseline, eight (25.8%) placebo and 48 
(68.6%) TCZ patients achieved a JIA ACR70 response at Week 6 or 8 enabling them to reduce their 
oral CS dose in accordance with the Protocol guidance. One placebo (3.2%) and 17 TCZ (24.3%) 
patients responded for this endpoint (p=0.0280) (Table 10).

Systemic Features 
Fever 
Of those patients with fever at Baseline, 35 (85.4%) TCZ patients and five (20.8%) placebo patients 
were free of fever at Week 12 (p<0.0001). 
At Week 12, of those patients who completed study Part I (i.e., did not escape or withdraw) on 
randomized treatment, fever was present in eight (11.0%) of the TCZ patients in comparison to six 
(35.3%) of the placebo patients (table 11). 
Rash 
At Week 12, of those patients who completed study Part I (i.e., did not escape or withdraw) on 
randomized treatment, rash was present in 12 (16.4%) of the TCZ patients in comparison to three 
(17.6%) of the placebo patients (table 11).

Supportive studies 
MRA011JP “Early Phase II Study of MRA for Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis” 
MRA011JP was an exploratory phase II study investigating the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in 
patients with sJIA that had failed to respond to therapy with cortisone, DMARD or immunosuppressants 
or in whom treatment could not be continued due to adverse drug reactions. Treatment was 
administered in 2-weekly intervals. Doses started at 2 mg/kg, when insufficient response with respect 
to CRP defined as CRP ≥15 mg/L was observed dose could be increased to 4 mg/kg and if necessary to 
8 mg/kg. Primary endpoint was course of CRP and ESR, JIA ACR was also investigated.  
Eleven patients were included in the study. Eight patients were male and 3 were female. Their age 
(mean ± SD) was 8.5 ± 4.0 years, age at onset of the underlying disease was 4.4 ± 3.6 years, and the 
disease duration was 3.5 ± 2.7 years. CRP before the start of treatment was 10.14 ± 9.22 mg/dL, and 
the ESR was 53.4 ± 24.6 mm/hr. All of the patients had previously received corticosteroids, 9 had 
received cyclosporine, and 8 had received methotrexate. All of the patients had also received other 
immunosuppressants previously.  
The final tocilizumab dose was 2 mg/kg in 3 patients, 5 patients required a dose increase to 4 mg/kg, 
and 3 patients required a dose increase to 8 mg/kg. CRP decreased after the first infusion at all doses 
and remained low throughout the study period. The percentage of patients showing normalization of 
CRP on the last observation day increased as the dose increased, with 100% of the patients who 
received a final dose of 8 mg/kg showing normal CRP values. 
There were 35 adverse events, and these involved all 11 patients. There were 29 adverse drug 
reactions, and these involved all 11 patients. By SOC, adverse events and adverse drug reactions 
involving investigations were the most common in terms of both the number of patients and the 
number of events. There were 18 such adverse events and 18 such adverse drug reactions each 
involving 10 patients. By preferred term (PT), there was a relatively high incidence of increased blood 
cholesterol, decreased blood IgG, limb abscesses, and increased β-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminidase among 
both adverse events and adverse drug reactions. All AE were mild and none were serious.  
MRA316JP “Phase III Study of MRA in Patients with Systemic Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis“ 
MRA316JP was a phase III trial investigating the efficacy and safety of tocilizumab in patients aged 
between 2 and 19 years with sJIA (onset at an age <16 years) with a CRP value ≥1.5 mg/dL at 
baseline that had failed to respond to therapy with corticosteroids or in whom treatment could not be

continued due to adverse drug reactions. During an open label run-in period of 6 weeks patients 
received three times a week a dose of 8 mg/kg Tocilizumab at 2 weeks intervals. At the end of the 
run-in period patients with a CRP <0.5 mg/dL and 30% improvement in the JIA core were randomised 
to receive in a double-blinded fashion either 8 mg/kg tocilizumab or placebo six times at 2-week 
intervals for another 12 weeks or withdrawal (whichever was first). Maintained response was the 
primary endpoint of the double blind withdrawal period. 
The study was conducted in Japan in 2004 and 2005. Fifty six patients were included into the open-
label part of the study whereof 50 patients completed this study part. 51/56 patients (91.1%, 95%-CI: 
80.4% to 97.0%) had a JIA ACR30 response at the end of open-label tocilizumab treatment. CRP and 
ESR were significantly lowered during the run-in period (p <0.001 each).  
Forty four JIA ACR30 responders completing the open-label period continued into the double blind 
withdrawal period. Treatment assignment was done by means of a dynamic allocation procedure. 
Twenty one patients were randomised to receive tocilizumab, 23 patients were randomized to receive 
placebo. One patient was excluded from all efficacy analyses due premature unblinding. Both 
treatment groups were comparable with respect to their demographic and baseline disease

from the tocilizumab group. 
The rate of maintained response defined as the percentage of patients who completed the study and to 
whom neither the withdrawal criteria nor the rescue criteria applied during 12 weeks of the blind period 
was statistically significantly higher in the tocilizumab group compared to the placebo group:

Duration of maintained response 
While CRP was below 0.1 mg/dL in all tocilizumab patients during the withdrawal period, an increase in 
CRP (up to 8.2 mg/dL) was observed in some placebo patients. A similar time pattern was to be 
observed for ESR: while ESR was stable during the withdrawal period in tocilizumab patients there was 
a tendency for increased ESR values in placebo patients during this study period.  
The study investigated the effect of a dose of 8 mg/kg to maintain a JIA ARC30 response. It was 
shown that over a 12 weeks period tocilizumab was able to achieve a significantly higher maintenance 
rate (80%, 95% CI; 56.3 – 94.3%) than placebo (17.4%, 95% CI: 5.0 – 38.8%). Judging this result in 
comparison to study WA18221 on has to consider several aspects: 
 
The population of study MRA316JP is somewhat different from the population in the pivotal 
WA18221 study. In this study CRP was used as a marker for disease activity, there was no 
requirement for fever or active arthritis. Thus the population may be less severely affected.  
 
The dosage of tocilizumab in this trial differs from the pivotal study as also children <30 kg 
received the 8 mg/kg dose.  
 
The withdrawal design used in this study is inferior for the demonstration of efficacy; however 
it is used in paediatric studies more often because it is perceived as more ethical. Formally only 
the need for treatment once it has begun is investigated and not efficacy of treatment itself. 
Long term extension study of WA18221 (cut-off 10 May 2010) 
The data was cut at the timepoint at which fifty patients had received TCZ treatment for at least one 
year in study Part II, known as the long-term extension (LTE) cut. As this was an LTE data cut 
involving escape patients and patients transitioning off of placebo from Part I, the dataset was re-
baselined to the first TCZ infusion received in the study. The efficacy endpoints of the LTE data cut are 
summarized descriptively as there was no placebo comparator for formal statistical analyses to be 
performed. The efficacy responses observed during the first 12 weeks in Part I of this study were 
maintained or improved further through to later timepoints beyond one year. 
The demographic and disease characteristics at Baseline for Part I of the study and for the LTE cut are 
comparable. 
Efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint in Part I of the study, JIA ACR30 response with absence of fever, was 
also assessed at timepoints in the May 10th 2010 LTE cut. As in Part I of the study, the proportion of 
patients achieving this endpoint was maintained beyond the first 12 weeks with 84.8% of patients 
responding at Week 72 as follows: 
Assessment report for  
EMA/455878/2011  
Page 28/72
 
 
 
 
 
- Week 24, 89.0% (97/109 patients)  
- Week 36, 86.1% (93/108 patients)  
- Week 48, 82.1% (78/95 patients)  
- Week 60, 89.3% (50/56 patients)  
- Week 72, 84.8% (28/33 patients)  
For the JIA ACR30/50/70/90 endpoints, response was either maintained or improved beyond Week 12. 
For example JIA ACR90 developed as follows: 
- Week 24, 50.5% (55/109 patients)  
- Week 36, 60.2% (65/108 patients)  
- Week 48, 69.5% (66/95 patients)  
- Week 60, 67.9% (38/56 patients)  
- Week 72, 69.7% (23/33 patients)  
In the WA18221 study, 92.2% (103/112) of patients were receiving oral corticosteroids at Baseline. A 
reduction from the overall Baseline mean ± SD dose of 0.30 ± 0.20 mg/kg/day oral corticosteroid dose 
(Baseline range = 0.00 to 1.33 mg/kg/day) was accomplished for 94.2% (97/103) of patients at the 
time of this LTE cut with 51.5% (53/97) of patients completely eliminating oral corticosteroids as a 
concomitant medication. Although it is more difficult to assess in a non-randomised trial the rate of 
discontinuation of corticosteroids or reduction of corticosteroids is considered clinically relevant. 
Treatment Completion and Withdrawal 
As this study is still on-going, the number of patients completing treatment at specific timepoints 
decreased as patients either have not reached that week or have withdrawn. Below is the number of 
patients completing treatment and the number of patients who withdrew up to the specified 
timepoints. 
Week 12: 109 (97%) patients completed treatment, 3 withdrew 
Week 24: 109 (97%) patients completed treatment, 3 withdrew 
Week 36: 108 (96%) patients completed treatment, 4 withdrew 
Week 48: 95 (85%) patients completed treatment, 7 withdrew 
Week 60: 56 (50%) patients completed treatment, 11 withdrew 
Week 72: 33 (29%) patients completed treatment, 12 withdrew 
In the May 10th, 2010 LTE data cut of study WA18221, two patients from the 8 mg/kg TCZ treatment 
group and two patients from the 12 mg/kg treatment group discontinued due to loss of efficacy. None 
of these patients had a positive anti-TCZ neutralizing assay. 
Patients were offered active treatment after completion of the randomised part of the study. Thus this 
population includes patients that were randomised to treatment from the beginning, patients that 
entered via the escape option and patients that entered at the end of the randomised part of the 
study. The data for the maintenance of effect are reassuring in general and a high proportion of 
patients reach JIA ACR90. Effects on the endpoints are generally consistent. From the longer term 
observations it is mentioned that 12 patients discontinued. The reasons for withdrawal were adverse 
event (4 patients), insufficient therapeutic response (4 patients), refused treatment (2 patients), death 
(1 patient), and failure to return (1 patient).

Long term extension study of MRA011JP and MRA316JP: MRA317JP 
This was an open-label extension study for patients with sJIA who responded to TCZ in studies 
MRA011JP or MRA316JP. A total of 60 patients were enrolled and received a single dose every two 
weeks of TCZ in this study 
The proportion of patients with a JIA ACR30 response was 88.5% (54/61 patients) after 12 weeks, and 
then ranged from 85.7% to 100.0% from 24 to 324 weeks after the start of treatment. 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
The pivotal trial WA18221 was a randomised, double-blind placebo controlled trial. This design is the 
preferred choice for the demonstration of efficacy, as there are no approved therapies and an actively 
controlled study would be difficult to investigate and compare. Therefore a placebo controlled trial is 
acceptable. The duration of 12 weeks for the blinded portion of the trial is acceptable. A longer placebo 
controlled phase is not justifiable for patients with active disease. 
There is a rather pronounced imbalance in the number of patients that entered the escape option 
already in phase I of the trial. Possible reasons for receiving escape therapy included fever for three 
consecutive days, symptomatic serositis requiring increased corticosteroids, JIA ACR30 flare compared 
to baseline. For the ITT analysis this poses no problem.  
Demographic and disease characteristics are generally well balanced. There are some imbalances in 
CRP that are caused by excessively high values in three individuals. The population included is 
characterised by a rather high disease activity even though treatment with MTX and corticosteroid is 
common. About one third of tocilizumab treated patients are ≤6 years, one third 7-12 years and the 
remaining third >12 years of age. 
The patients included had sJIA diagnosed by the currently accepted criteria. The patients had to have 
signs of active disease and the need for additional treatment. The inclusion of this population is 
acceptable as it has been shown that patients with the presence of systemic signs of the disease 6 
months after onset have a worse prognosis (Spiegel et al. Arthritis Rheum. 2000;43:2402-9). Patients 
with high corticosteroid doses were excluded. This could exclude the most severe patients that are 
usually smaller children. However, due to the toxicity of corticosteroid it is common to apply pulse 
therapy and then reduce doses, it is not practise to maintain patients on high corticosteroid dose. 
Rather other therapies are introduced. Therefore there is less concern as regards external validity.  
From the amendment documentation the changes to the inclusion criteria for disease duration and 
disease activity could be important. It would be more conservative only to include patients with a 
definite diagnosis of sJIA and ongoing disease activity 6 months after definite diagnosis. Since 
diagnosis of sJIA is not straightforward patients included merely on the basis of documented presence 
of symptoms for more than 6 months may be undertreated and therefore not be totally representative 
for the population with higher therapeutic need. As regards activity the initial inclusion criteria only 
asked for presence of specific arthritis severity at screening. However, more important are the baseline 
characteristics actually observed. In response to questions the MAH supplied information that all 
patients had a definite diagnosis of sJIA for at least 6 months even though the revised inclusion criteria 
allowed inclusion of patients with lower disease duration since definite diagnosis therefore these 
theoretical concerns are alleviated. 
Thirty seven patients were randomised to placebo, 37 to tocilizumab 8 mg/kg and 38 to tocilizumab  
12 mg/kg. Twenty patients in the placebo group went into escape and received active therapy during 
the 12 week trial. The majority of included patients were on concomitant MTX and corticosteroid 
therapy, all had active disease. The majority had been pretreated with biologics. About one third of 
Assessment report for  
EMA/455878/2011  
Page 30/72
 
 
 
tocilizumab treated patients are ≤6 years, one third 7-12 years and the remaining third >12 years of 
age. 
Two different doses of tocilizumab were used in the trial: 8 mg/kg for patients of 30 kg bodyweight or 
more, and 12 mg/kg for patients of less than 30 mg. These doses were chosen on the basis of a 
population PK analysis from the Japanese trial with the intention to have a uniform exposure across 
the range of different body weights. 
The chosen primary endpoint JIA ACR30 and absence of fever is acceptable. The addition of absence of 
fever into the primary endpoint is appropriate as quotidian fever is a hallmark of uncontrolled systemic 
disease. Currently there are no known specific biomarkers to evaluate activity of systemic disease. 
Fever and CRP are obvious choices, unfortunately both are directly regulated by IL-6, thus there is the 
possibility that an effect on these markers will not indicate a true effect on disease activity itself. 
However, in the absence of better markers fever is acceptable. In addition, it is of high clinical 
relevance as fever by itself has a detrimental impact on quality of life. The secondary endpoints are 
acceptable and use subjective as well as objective evaluation of features of systemic disease. This 
enables the evaluation of efficacy as regards patients with predominant arthritis or predominant 
systemic disease. For the assessment of joints an independent joint assessor was used that was not 
involved in patient care and did not have information on clinical course and laboratory values. This 
procedure is useful to reduce bias in arthritis assessment. 
The response criterion used for the primary endpoint (JIA ACR30 and absence of fever) was met by 
9/37 patients in the placebo group, 28/37 patients in the tocilizumab 8 mg/kg group and 36/38 
patients in the tocilizumab 12 mg/kg group. This result is statistically significant and clinically relevant. 
The responder rate is even higher in the 12 mg/kg cohort comprising children of less than 30 kg 
bodyweight. However the study was not powered to detect a difference in the two dosing groups. 
Sensitivity analyses confirmed robustness of results. All 22 secondary endpoints met the significance 
level of p ≤0.05. The finding that corticosteroid use could be reduced in patients by more than 20% 
after reaching a JIA ACR70 response without experiencing a flare of disease is of medical importance 
as the side effects of corticosteroid therapy contribute to long term morbidity in this population. JIA 
ACR30 response is reaching a plateau at week 6, responder rates for JIA ACR50 plateau by 8 weeks 
and JIA ACR70 and 90 continue to rise up to week 12. Sensitivity analyses of efficacy and analyses 
across differently defined subpopulations (e.g. with or without MTX background therapy) gave 
consistent results. 
Influence of tocilizumab therapy on features of systemic disease gives a slightly heterogeneous 
picture: while fever, CRP, anaemia, thrombocytosis, leukocytosis and pain all show clear signs of 
normalisation, rash appears to be less influenced.  
Patients from WA18221 have entered a part II long term extension study. Patients were offered active 
treatment after completion of the randomised part of the study. Thus this population includes patients 
that were randomised to treatment from the beginning, patients that entered via the escape option 
and patients that entered at the end of the randomised part of the study. Data cut was at the time 
when 50 patients had reached one year of treatment. The majority of patients maintain the response 
for JIA ACR30 and absence of fever, 78/95 patients are responding at weeks 48. The hard to meet 
response criterium JIA ACR90 was met by 66/95 patients at week 48.  
The supportive study MRA316JP used a single arm, open label run in phase followed by a randomised, 
blinded withdrawal. Generally this design is considered inferior to a blinded placebo controlled trial. The 
populations of the WA18221 and MRA316JP are not directly comparable since different inclusion 
criteria were used, in particular CRP elevation was an inclusion criterion but active arthritis was not 
required. Thus this population may be less severely affected. The trial demonstrated a statistically 
significant and clinically relevant difference of maintenance of response to the treatment. Although not 
Assessment report for  
EMA/455878/2011  
Page 31/72
 
 
 
regarded as the optimum design for showing efficacy the generated data are seen as supportive for the 
results of the pivotal WA18221 trial. 
Study MRA011JP investigated different doses based on a pharmacodynamic endpoint. Even though a 
dose of 2 mg/kg was sufficient to lower CRP in the first week further increments were necessary based 
on the pre-infusion CRP at week 2. Lower tocilizumab trough values are clearly associated with higher 
CRP and higher ESR. The authors of the study report concluded that the higher dose is therefore more 
appropriate. Of note CRP under treatment may not be indicative of the underlying disease process 
anymore it only shows the degree of IL-6R blockade. This study design is insufficient to conclude on 
the most appropriate dose as it ignores the inevitable time it takes to reach steady state. 
Long term extension data from the Japanese trials give a consistent picture with response rate for JIA 
ACR30 above 85% from 24 to 324 weeks after start of treatment. 
Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
Short term efficacy has been conclusively demonstrated in the pivotal trial WA18221. Findings within 
the trial and compared to the supportive studies show a consistent clinically relevant effect. Available 
long term efficacy data are re-assuring and further follow-up data (WA18221 (phase II and III)) as 
detailed in the RMP will be generated.

placebo group and 73.3 % in the all TCZ group (TCZ 8 mg/kg group, 78.4% and TCZ 12 mg/kg group, 
68.4%) reported as mild in intensity (table 17, 18 and 19).

placebo-treated patients were juvenile arthritis and pyrexia. These events usually led to escape 
therapy.

There was one life-threatening event in the tocilizumab 12 mg/kg group. This was a 3 year old male 
who developed urticaria on study day 29 following the week 4 tocilizumab infusion. He received the 
week 6 infusion without incident. On day 57 he developed life-threatening angioedema during 
tocilizumab infusion and was discontinued from treatment.

Serious adverse events and deaths 
Deaths 
A total of 9 deaths were reported, 1 in study WA18221, 2 in the supportive sJIA studies, 3 in the post 
marketing program, 1 in the MAH’s TCZ compassionate use program, and 2 in the TCZ compassionate 
use program in Japan. 
WA18221: No deaths were reported during the first 12 weeks of study treatment. A 16 year-old male 
patient died of suspected tension pneumothorax on study Day 349. The investigator considered the 
death unrelated to study treatment. 
Chugai studies: A 3 year-old girl, died of MAS 15 days following the 4th TCZ dose administration.  
A 22 year old male patient died of arrhythmia secondary to his cardiac amyloidosis 8 days following the 
7th TCZ dose administration. 
Postmarketing: A 22 month-old female in the JPMS sJIA program died from acute respiratory distress 
syndrome, multiple confounding factors were present. A 4 month-old male in the JPMS sJIA program 
died from pseudomonas infection, sepsis and interstitial lung disease following pancytopenia.  
A 45 year-old male receiving TCZ for adult onset Still’s disease died from megacolon and multi-organ 
failure. The narrative of this case is inconclusive. 
Compassionate program: A 5 year old female patient who died of acute myeloid leukemia (AML) whilst 
receiving tocilizumab for systemic juvenile rheumatoid arthritis. The patient also had interstitial 
pneumonia that apparently developed during treatment with tocilizumab. She was treated with 
cyclophosphamide for interstitial pneumonia. After development of AML she continually deteriorated 
with possible infection, possible sJIA flare and progression of AML. No chemotherapy was administered 
and tocilizumab was not implicated in the death. 
A 4-year-old female patient died whilst receiving tocilizumab for the treatment of systemic juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis. Tocilizumab was used as a rescue treatment because her sJIA had worsened 
dramatically and no other treatments were available.

Serious adverse events 
WA18221: There were 3 patients with 4 SAE in the controlled phase of the trial: bacterial arthritis 
(tocilizumab 8 mg/kg), angioedema and urticarial (tocilizumab 12 mg/kg), varicella (tocilizumab 12 
mg/kg. The varicella infection during treatment with tocilizumab resolved without sequelae, the patient 
was treated with acyclovir and resumed treatment after temporary discontinuation. All other SAE 
resolved without sequelae. There were no SAE in the placebo group.  
Including the extension phase there were 32 SAE in 25 treated patients: gastroenteritis 3 cases, 
varicella 3 cases, pneumonia 3 cases, bacterial arthritis 1 case, bronchopneumonia 1 case, 
gastroenteritis one case, herpes zoster 1 case, otitis media 1 case, pharyngotonsillitis 1 case, URTI 1 
case, femur fracture 1 case, forearm fracture 1 case, unspecified fracture 1 case, joint dislocation 1 
case, HLH/MAS 3 cases, pneumothorax 1 case, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease 1 case, angioedema 
1 case, urticaria 1 case, cardiac failure 1 case, gastritis 1 case, influenza-like illness 1 case, 
transaminase increased 2 cases, dehydration 1 case. 
Laboratory findings 
Neutropenia 
Study WA18221 
A total of four patients experienced AEs of neutropenia to Week 12. All events resolved and were not 
associated with any serious infections. 
Overall, the lowest neutrophil count during the 12-week treatment period remained in the normal 
range in 78.7% of the TCZ-treated patients compared with 100% of patients in the placebo group 
Table 24). 
Table 24 Summary of the Worst CTC Grades for Neutrophils to Week 12 by Trial Treatment 
(Safety Population, Study WA18221) 
The incidence of neutropenia <1.0/nl in this 12 week trial was 6/75 = 8% which seems higher than the 
incidence observed in adults in the longer lasting pivotal trials (3.4%), also considering the shorter 
duration of the trial. The reference range for neutrophils in the investigated age group is comparable to 
the adult age group, therefore under- or overestimation of incidence is unlikely. 
Study WA18221 long term extension 
Overall in 112 patients, the lowest neutrophil count remained in the normal range in 59 TCZ-treated 
patients (52.7%) (table 25). The lowest neutrophil count was CTC grade 1 in 5 patients (4.5%), CTC 
grade 2 in 31 patients (27.7%), CTC grade 3 in 15 patients (13.4%), and CTC grade 4 in 2 patients 
(1.8%).

Table 25 Summary of Worst CTC Grades for Neutrophil Count (Hypo) by Trial Treatment - 
May 10th Data Cut 
In the extension phase incidence of neutropenia increases considerably. Of the 17 patients (15%) with 
a neutrophil count depression to CTC grade 3 or 4, 7 had the depression of the neutrophil count at a 
single time point, 9 had non-consecutive neutrophil count depressions, and 1 had consecutive 
neutrophil count depressions. Both of the 2 patients with a CTC grade 4 neutrophil count depression 
had the depression of the neutrophil count at a single time point. Of note there is no clear correlation 
between neutropenia AE and infection AE. 
Thrombocytopenia 
Study WA18221 
Two patients (one in the placebo group and one in the TCZ 12 mg/kg) had depression in platelets of 
≤100/nL at a single time point. No patient had a depression in platelets of ≤50/nL in the study (Table 
26).

During study treatment, the lowest platelet count remained normal in 76.8% of patients, with 22.3% 
of patients experiencing CTC grade 1 thrombocytopenia and 1 patient (0.9%) having CTC grade 3

Mean platelet value decreased in tocilizumab treated patients. This is expected and could be regarded 
as a pharmacodynamic marker for anti-inflammatory activity of the drug. In the extension phase there 
is a considerable increase of CTC grade 1 thrombocytopenia (CTC grade 1: <LLN - 75/nL) compared to 
the 12 week study phase.  
AST, ALT and bilirubin elevation 
Study WA18221 
Similarly to adults treatment with tocilizumab causes AST/ALT elevation in a fraction of the patients. In 
the TCZ-treated patients mean absolute ALT values were elevated at Week 2 that gradually decreased 
through Week 12 in the 4 to 6 years age group and 7 to 9 years age group. However, in the older age 
group (10 to 17 years), the mean absolute ALT values decreased at Week 2 but stayed higher than the 
placebo group throughout the study especially in the TCZ 8 mg/kg group. Similar to the ALT, in 
patients who were treated with TCZ, elevations in mean AST (U/L) were observed from Week 2 that 
gradually decreased through Week 12 in the 4 – 6 years age group and 7 to 9 years age group. 
However, in the older age group (10 to 17 years), AST decreased at Week 2 but stayed higher than 
the placebo group throughout the study especially in the TCZ 8 mg/kg group.  
Mean values of absolute total, direct, and indirect bilirubin values remained within the normal range 
from baseline to Week 12 in all age groups and in all treatment groups. Between Week 2 and Week 12, 
the absolute direct, indirect, and total bilirubin values were slightly higher in the TCZ 8 mg/kg group 
compared with the TCZ 12 mg/kg and the placebo groups. 
There were a total of 21 occasions in which an ALAT value > ULN and a total bilirubin value > ULN 
occurred in a same time window for a given patient. 10 of these 21 had an ALAT elevation up to 
threefold and bilirubin elevation up to two fold. 
One patient met the criteria of “Hy’s law”, this patient had pre-existing hepatic steatosis and 
transaminase levels normalised after discontinuation of therapy.

Cholesterol 
The mean change in baseline and absolute values in total cholesterol in all age groups and treatment 
groups were within the reference ranges (2.95 to 5.25 mmol/L), except for one patient. The mean plot 
of change from baseline in lipid cholesterol demonstrated that at Week 2, mean levels increased and 
then decreased to Week 12 in all age groups except for the 15 to 17 years group which showed 
continued elevation of lipid cholesterol in the TCZ 12 mg/kg group related to one patient. The mean 
change from baseline and absolute values in LDL-cholesterol and HDL-cholesterol in all age groups and 
treatment groups were within reference ranges. 
Lipid parameters that were assessed included total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, and HDL-cholesterol. 
The total cholesterol parameters at Baseline, Week 2, and Week 12 are summarized in the table 30 
using categories of “normal”, “> ULN to 1.5 × ULN”, and “> 1.5 to 2 × ULN”.

AE of special interest 
Infection AE (Safety population) 
A higher incidence of infection AEs was reported in patients receiving TCZ (54.7%) than in patients 
receiving placebo (29.7%) (Table 31). The overall infection AE rate was 287.0 per 100 patient-years 
for placebo and 344.7 per 100 patient-years for TCZ.  
Table 31 Summary of Infection Adverse Events to Week 12, (Study WA18221, Safety 
Population) 
The percentage of patients with infection AEs in the TCZ 12 mg/kg group (60.5%) was higher than in 
the TCZ 8 mg/kg group (48.6%). In the 12 week controlled phase, the rate of serious infections in the

tocilizumab group was 11.5 per 100 patient years. At one year in the ongoing open label extension 
phase the overall rate of serious infections remained stable at 11.3 per 100 patient years. 
In the ongoing open label extension phase (Part II), the overall rate of infections remained similar at 
306.6 per 100 patient years. 
The majority of infection AEs in all treatment groups (95.0%) occurred in association with the 
neutrophil counts ≥the lower limit of normal range (LLN) within 21 days prior to the start of the 
infection (Table 32).

Immunological events 
Immunogenicity 
In study WA18221, patients were tested for anti-TCZ antibodies. All patients were tested at baseline 
and Week 12 for anti-TCZ antibodies. Only 1 patient with assay results was positive for confirmation 
and was also positive for neutralizing assay at Week 12 at the time of the data cut (Table 33). 
Table 33 Summary of Patients with any Positive Anti-TCZ Assay Result 
Discontinuation due to AE 
Study WA18221 
Four patients withdrew due to SAEs in the study. One patient withdrew from study treatment on Day 
57 due to a life threatening SAE (angioedema). 
A second patient randomized to the placebo group escaped at Week 2 to TCZ 12 mg/kg and then 
withdrew early from the study on Day 70 due to a SAE of MAS/HLH that was possibly related to study 
treatment. The event resolved after the Week 12 cut. 
In the extension one patient withdrew because of an AE of ALT increase. 
Another patient withdrew because of pulmonary veno-occlusive disease. This was considered a life-
threatening event. The patient also had lung infection on study Day 376, cardiac failure on study Day

EMA/455878/2011  
Page 42/72
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
384, PVOD on study Day 388, and MAS/HLH on study Day 397. The last dose of study medication was 
administered on study Day 379 followed by sJIA relapse, which may have triggered the event of 
HLH/MAS. 
Diagnosis of HLH/MAS is difficult. MAS is expected in this population and the differentiation whether it 
is caused by study drug or disease is cumbersome. The first of the described patients obviously had a 
high disease activity as she was already moved to the escape arm after 2 weeks. Of note, from the 
narrative it appears that she had infusion reactions on day 31, day 43 and therefore was hospitalised 
for the week 8 infusion. Following this infusion she had fever and laboratory changes consistent with 
developing MAS. She was treated accordingly and tocilizumab treatment was stopped. 
Pulmonary veno-occlusive disease is a rare disease, the aetiology is unknown. It has been described 
associated with auto-immune disease such as scleroderma or CREST, associated with virus infection, 
as complication of haematopoetic stem cell transplantation and as complication of chemotherapies and 
radiation. There are a number of confounding factors for the described patient and relation to study 
drug remains uncertain. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of tocilizumab has been previously characterised in the adult population. The 
available database in adults was acceptable and provided sufficient information for the authorisation of 
the medicinal product. The assessment of safety data in this paediatric population is in general 
challenging, especially as regards relatedness, as there are multiple confounding factors: the patient 
population is rather ill, there is a high rate of concomitant therapy with partially overlapping AE profile 
(e.g. MTX) and the duration of the placebo-controlled phase is only 12 weeks. Therefore this discussion 
will focus on AE and not on ADR. 
Safety data from uncontrolled trials are limited with respect to exposed patients and duration of 
exposure: 73 patients from the pivotal trial have been exposed to more than 25 infusions 
corresponding to more than one year of treatment. Furthermore the analysis is hampered by the fact 
that children less than 30 kg received a higher dose of 12mg/kg compared to a dose of 8 mg/kg in 
children of more than 30 kg. Of note, the recommended dose for adults is 8 mg/kg every 4 weeks 
compared with 8 mg/kg every 2 weeks for children. 
The observed type of AE in children are rather similar to the adult population, namely infections, 
leukocytopenia, thrombocytopenia, elevation of ALAT, ASAT, bilirubin and cholesterol and infusion 
reactions. The rate of AE in children appears to be higher than in the adult population, especially for 
infections and leukocytopenia. In addition the rate of AE is higher in the 12 mg/kg cohort although this 
is confounded by the age of the patients and the higher use of MTX and corticosteroids in this age 
group. The majority of AE were mild to moderate. Considering this higher incidence of treatment 
related AEs, the possibility of dose reduction or prolonging dosing interval for AE (thrombocytopenia, 
neutropenia, liver enzyme abnormalities) in sJIA patients should be studied. The MAH will perform a 
study to investigate the possibility of dose reduction for AE (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, liver 
enzyme abnormalities) in sJIA patients as detailed in the RMP. 
In the controlled phase of the pivotal trial there was one case of bacterial arthritis. Non-surgical 
bacterial arthritis is more common in adults with rheumatoid arthritis. It is no entirely clear whether 
this is related to the disease or its treatments. In this case intra-articular injections were performed 
previously and are more likely to be the cause of bacterial arthritis. However, given that the rate of 
infections is higher in tocilizumab it is conceivable that the risk for haematogenous bacterial arthritis is 
also increased. The MAH will collect further information on bacterial arthritis to gain a better 
understanding on this issue as detailed in the RMP. The majority of reported serious AE were a mix of 
Assessment report for  
EMA/455878/2011  
Page 43/72
 
 
 
bacterial and presumably viral infections without a clear pattern. There was no opportunistic infection 
with the exception of a herpes zoster. Again AE rate was higher in the higher dose group. 
Neutropenia was more common in the paediatric population, similarly to the adult population there is 
no clear correlation to infectious AE although this could well be caused by the limited database. At 
present it is not clear whether neutropenia is caused by deficient production in the bone marrow or 
different distribution between circulating and e.g. marginating pool. Increased consumption is regarded 
as a less likely explanation for neutropenia. Currently management of neutropenia should take general 
medical knowledge into account, i.e. neutropenia should be avoided and treatment should be delayed 
or discontinued if severe neutropenia is detected pre-dosing. This event is described in the product 
information and followed through routine pharmacovigilance activities and additional surveillance 
through registries and studies as detailed in the RMP. 
Similarly to the adult population thrombocytopenia was observed, the degree of thrombocytopenia was 
not critical and no bleeding events were observed associated with thrombocytopenia. 
The elevation of cholesterol has already been observed in adults. The absolute values of cholesterol 
and the increments are small and not regarded as critical on a population basis. However, for an 
individual with elevated baseline values this increase could become relevant. Currently it is unknown if 
sJIA is an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease as has been shown for rheumatoid arthritis 
in adults. Therefore it cannot be determined whether the decrease in inflammation, which should 
reduce cardiovascular risk, is offset by an increase in cholesterol. Currently there is preciously little 
information at all about the long term fate of paediatric patients with sJIA once they reach adulthood. 
Further data will be collected in the proposed registries as detailed in the RMP to further characterise 
the safety profile. 
Infection AE were more common in tocilizumab treated patients than in placebo treated patients. 
Considering the mechanism of action this is not unexpected. The differences in AE are driven by a 
variety of bacterial as well as viral infections, there is no clear picture emerging. Two cases of zoster 
were observed. There were two non-serious infections in one patients associated with moderate 
neutropenia. The patient experienced an episode of infectious conjunctivitis and a tooth abscess. 
Neutrophil counts were not collected at the day of the AE. In the extension phase number of infection 
AE were clearly higher in the 12 mg/kg cohort, again a mixture of bacterial and viral disease was 
observed. 
There were no confirmed anti-drug antibody (ADA) positive patients at baseline. One patient was 
confirmed to be ADA positive at week 12; this patient had experienced serious angioedema and was 
withdrawn from the study. One additional patient in the 12 mg/kg cohort had confirmed ADA, which 
were preceded by infusion reactions. There were no further cases of confirmed ADA in the pivotal trial 
and the extension. In patients that were withdrawn from treatment for lack of efficacy no ADA were 
found. However, all ADA data in antibody therapies can be misleading because of the long half-life of 
antibodies and the known problems with the determination of ADA in the presence of active drug. 
Further data in the longer term are required since it is likely that background therapy will be reduced 
under continued tocilizumab treatment and immunogenicity might change. Of note, the assay for the 
determination of ADA performs less well in children because of higher drug levels. A higher rate of 
false negative results is a possibility. 
There was one death from suspected pneumothorax which was also recorded as SAE. Incidence of 
spontaneous pneumothorax has been reported to be around 18/100,000 per year. It occurs more 
commonly in young males as in this case. Analysis of all cases in the tocilizumab database revealed 
confounding factors in the majority of cases.  
Assessment report for  
EMA/455878/2011  
Page 44/72
 
 
 
The population of sJIA is especially challenging as one of the major complications of disease MAS can 
be triggered by infectious complications as well as insufficient treatment. Therefore a recurring issue 
apparent from the narratives is the difficult differential diagnosis of infection vs. flare of sJIA vs. 
triggering of MAS. Often multimodal treatment is instituted directed against infection as well as sJIA 
flare. From the provided data including a dedicated report on the adjudication procedure for the 
evaluation of MAS there is no indication that tocilizumab causes MAS. The incidence of MAS reported in 
the studies and the postmarketing setting from Japan is in either at or below what has been published 
previously. Given the uncertainties of previous estimates and the uncertainties of the estimates under 
treatment with tocilizumab further data must be collected. At present it is not possible to give clear 
treatment recommendations for continuation or discontinuation of therapy. These investigations are 
important and the MAH will report them with upcoming PSURs especially since drug exposure is 
considerably higher in children.  
Upon request from the CHMP the MAH has further analysed the data from children <5 years of age at 
baseline to the older children. The higher rate in the observed AE in the smaller age group are mostly 
in the rate of infections e.g. upper respiratory tract infection, nasopharingitis and rhinitis. It is agreed 
that there are a number of confounding factors when comparing <5 year old children to the older 
children, namely higher MTX use, more frequent use of corticosteroids, higher corticosteroid dose and 
the general fact that infections are more prevalent in smaller children. Abnormalities in the laboratory 
parameters between the two age groups were comparable and only small differences were observed in 
number of patients experiencing grade 1 platelet decrease or grade 1 ALT increases. It is also 
encouraging that only 3 children 5 years of age at baseline had to be withdrawn from the treatment 
(one due to insufficient response, other failed to return to the treatment and the third due to 
anaphylactic reaction).  
The conclusion of similar safety is based on a relatively small number of cases. The additional data 
from the pooled Japanese studies appear to confirm the safety profile in the smaller children and 
support the proposed age range. Further postmarketing observation and particularly the data 
generation through registries, as agreed in the risk management plan, will be performed.  
Conclusions on clinical safety 
The qualitative safety profile of tocilizumab in children appears to be generally comparable to adults. 
However, infections and infestations and neutropenia appear to be more common than in adults. Of 
note, there is no clear association of neutropenia and infection. So far no serious opportunistic 
infections have been observed. Elevation of transaminases is also observed frequently, the clinical 
significance of this observation remains to be under monitoring. 
Overall, based on the available data the safety profile in this patient population is considered 
acceptable. The SmPC provides adequate information and guidance related to the safety concerns. In 
addition, the measures included in the risk management plan are appropriate to generate further data 
which will confirm the safety profile. The MAH will perform a study to investigate the possibility of dose 
reduction for AE (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, liver enzyme abnormalities) in sJIA patients as 
detailed in the RMP.

and precautions for use 
Infections  
Serious and sometimes fatal 
infections have been reported in 
patients receiving 
immunosuppressive agents 
including RoActemra (see section 
4.8). 
RoActemra treatment should not 
be initiated in patients with active 
infections (see section 4.3). 
Administration of RoActemra 
should be interrupted if a patient 
develops a serious infection until 
the infection is controlled (see 
section 4.8). Healthcare 
professionals should exercise 
caution when considering the use 
of RoActemra in patients with a 
history of recurring or chronic 
infections or with underlying 
conditions (e.g. diverticulitis, 
diabetes) which may predispose 
patients to infections. 
Vigilance for the timely detection 
of serious infection is 
recommended for patients 
receiving biological treatments for 
moderate to severe RA or sJIA as 
signs and symptoms of acute 
inflammation may be lessened, 
associated with suppression of 
the acute phase reaction. The 
effects of tocilizumab on 
C-reactive protein (CRP), 
neutrophils and signs and 
symptoms of infection should be 
considered when evaluating a 
patient for a potential infection. 
Patients (which includes younger 
children with sJIA who may be 
less able to communicate their 
symptoms) and 
parents/guardians of sJIA 
patients, should be instructed to 
contact their healthcare 
professional immediately when 
any symptoms suggesting 
infection appear, in order to 
assure rapid evaluation and 
appropriate treatment.

Take special care with RoActemra 
If you have any kind of infection, 
short- or long-term, or if you 
often get infections. Tell your 
doctor immediately if you feel 
unwell. RoActemra can reduce 
your body’s ability to respond to 
infections and may make an

Patients presenting with 
symptoms potentially indicative 
of complicated diverticulitis, such 
as abdominal pain, haemorrhage 
and/or unexplained change in

Active hepatic disease and hepatic 
impairment 
Treatment with RoActemra, particularly 
when administered concomitantly with 
MTX, may be associated with elevations 
in hepatic transaminases (see section 
4.8), therefore, caution should be 
exercised when considering treatment of 
patients with active hepatic disease or 
hepatic impairment (see Sections 4.2 
and 4.8).  
Hepatic transaminase elevations 
In clinical trials, transient or intermittent 
mild and moderate elevations of hepatic 
transaminases have been reported 
commonly with RoActemra treatment, 
without progression to hepatic injury 
(see section 4.8). An increased 
frequency of these elevations was 
observed when potentially hepatotoxic 
drugs (e.g. MTX) were used in 
combination with RoActemra. When 
clinically indicated, other liver function 
tests including bilirubin should be 
considered. 
Caution should be exercised when 
considering initiation of RoActemra 
treatment in patients with elevated ALT 
or AST >1.5 x ULN. In patients with 
baseline ALT or AST >5 x ULN, 
treatment is not recommended. 
In RA patients, ALT and AST levels

Hepatic transaminase elevations 
During the 6-month controlled trials 
transient elevations in ALT/AST >3 x 
ULN were observed in 2.1% of patients 
on tocilizumab 8 mg/kg compared to 
4.9% of patients on MTX and in 6.5% of 
patients who received 8 mg/kg 
tocilizumab plus DMARDs compared to 
1.5% of patients on placebo plus 
DMARDs. 
The addition of potentially hepatotoxic 
drugs (e.g. MTX) to tocilizumab 
monotherapy resulted in increased 
frequency of these elevations. 
Elevations of ALT/AST >5 x ULN were 
observed in 0.7% of tocilizumab 
monotherapy patients and 1.4% of 
tocilizumab plus DMARD patients, the 
majority of whom were discontinued 
permanently from tocilizumab 
treatment. These elevations were not 
associated with clinically relevant 
increase in direct bilirubin, nor were 
they associated with clinical evidence of 
hepatitis or hepatic impairment. 
During the double-blind controlled 
period and with long-term exposure, the 
pattern and incidence of elevations in 
ALT/AST remained consistent with what 
was seen in the 6-month controlled 
clinical trials. 
During the double-blind controlled 
period, the incidence of indirect total 
bilirubin greater than the upper limit of 
normal, collected as a routine laboratory 
parameter, is 6.2% in patients treated 
with 8 mg/kg tocilizumab + DMARD. A 
total of 5.8% of patients experienced an 
elevation of indirect bilirubin of >1 to 2

patients developed positive anti-
tocilizumab antibodies with one of these 
patients having a hypersensitivity 
reaction leading to withdrawal. The 
incidence of anti-tocilizumab antibody 
formation might be underestimated

SPC section 4.5 Interaction with other 
medicinal products and other forms of 
interaction 
The expression of hepatic CYP450 
enzymes is suppressed by the 
cytokines, such as IL-6, that stimulate 
chronic inflammation. Thus, CYP450 
expression may be reversed when 
potent cytokine inhibitory therapy, such 
as tocilizumab, is introduced. 
In vitro studies with cultured human 
hepatocytes demonstrated that IL-6 
caused a reduction in CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, and CYP3A4 enzyme 
expression. Tocilizumab normalises 
expression of these enzymes. 
When starting or stopping therapy with 
tocilizumab, patients taking medicinal 
products which are individually adjusted 
and are metabolised via CYP450 3A4, 
1A2, 2C9 or 2C19 (e.g. atorvastatin,

2.  Overall conclusion and benefit-risk assessment 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The following beneficial effects were investigated in the clinical studies with tocilizumab: 
Treatment of symptom and signs: Endpoint for evaluating this benefit is the response for JIA ACR30 
and absence of fever. This response was met in 85.3% (95% CI 77.3 – 93.3%) of the total tocilizumab 
treated population compared to 24.3% (95% CI 10.5 – 38.1%) in the placebo population. More 
stringent criteria (JIA ACR50, JIA ACR70, JIA ACR90) confirm this effect. 
Correction of anaemia: Anaemia is caused by a combination of factors in long standing disease. It 
could therefore be regarded as a surrogate of disease activity although it has not been validated for 
this use. Of those placebo treated patients that had anaemia at baseline 2/29 (6.9%, 95% CI 0.0 – 
16.1%) had normal haemoglobin at week 12. In the total tocilizumab treated population 40/50 (80%, 
95% CI 68.9 – 91.1) had normal haemoglobin at week 12.  
Decrease of concomitant corticosteroid therapy: The protocol allowed reduction of corticosteroid dose if 
JIA ACR70 response was met at weeks 6 or 8. One/31 (3.2%, 95% CI 0.0 – 9.4%) placebo patient and 
17/70 (24.3%, 95% CI 14.2 – 34.3) tocilizumab treated patients reduced their oral corticosteroid dose 
by 20% to week 12 without experiencing a flare. 
Remission of disease symptoms: The most stringent criterion is a JIA ACR90 response, this was met by 
2/37 (95%CI 0.0 – 12.7%) in the placebo group and 28/75 (95% CI 26.4 – 48.3%) in the total 
tocilizumab group. 
Functional improvement: For the assessment of functional improvement in daily live CHAQ-DI was 
used. 58/75 (77.3%, 95% CI 67.9 – 86.8%)  TCZ patients and 7/37 (18.9%; 95%CI 6.3 – 31.5%) 
placebo patients had a minimally important improvement (0.13) in CHAQ-DI score from Baseline to 
Week 12. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
With regard to these investigated beneficial effects, the following observations were made: 
Treatment of symptom and signs: Sources of uncertainty are related to the population recruited and 
the rather pronounced effect on CRP and fever with the potential of unblinding. However, given the 
results of the conducted sensitivity analyses and the magnitude of the treatment effect there is little 
uncertainty for these beneficial effects. Even a halving of the effect size would be regarded as clinical 
meaningful in this patient population if statistical significance were demonstrated. It is interesting to 
note that the physician component and the parent component appear to be diverging in the sense that 
in the placebo group physician evaluation is stating improvement over time whereas the parent 
evaluation appears to indicate no large change in disease severity.  
Correction of anaemia: Correction of anaemia is not an accepted surrogate for disease activity in sJIA. 
However for a condition with chronic inflammation and ensuing anaemia this endpoint constitutes a 
valuable confirmation of the beneficial effect. Since this is a rather objective endpoint uncertainties 
mainly relate to the possibility of transfusion in extreme cases. It is difficult to define clinically 
meaningful changes. LLN is an obvious choice for a cut-off. 
Decrease of concomitant corticosteroid therapy: In a blinded trial this is considered clinically as a very 
relevant endpoint. Of note, any changes from baseline could result in increased disease activity and 
Assessment report for  
EMA/455878/2011  
Page 67/72
 
 
 
would therefore impact on the primary efficacy endpoint. Source of variability are mainly compliance 
with the treatment regimen. 
Remission of disease symptoms: Similarly to the above “symptoms and signs” evaluation main sources 
of uncertainty is the population recruited into the trial and the potential for unblinding. From the 
supportive data the remarkable increase over a longer time period increases the confidence in the 12 
week data.  
Functional improvement: Uncertainties mainly relate to the term “minimally important improvement”. 
Robustness of the effect could be questioned. The effect size and the conditions under which it was 
obtained are not considered to be a relevant source of variation.  
In addition, there are some potential beneficial effects of tocilizumab in systemic juvenile idiopathic 
arthritis, which would however require additional data either long-term of with larger sample sizes: 
Prevention of MAS, decrease in mortality: This would be a clear-cut endpoint requiring a large sample 
size. From the obtained data no judgement can be made. Further data, e.g. from registries will be 
collected to obtain a larger sample size. Uncertainties relate to the difficulties in diagnosis, the multiple 
triggering mechanisms and the multi-modal treatment. Furthermore, an investigation of the primary or 
secondary influence of tocilizumab in the risk for developing MAS will be addressed in the post-
marketing observation period, within the context of the ongoing Part II and Part III of study WA18221 
as detailed in the RMP. 
Prevention of structural damage: This would be the most important beneficial effect as regards the 
arthritis component of the disease. No long term data are available therefore it is uncertain whether 
this beneficial effect can be obtained. Data from adult rheumatoid arthritis make it more likely that 
also a beneficial effect can be demonstrated.  
Preservation of bone integrity: sJIA is associated with osteoporosis but the role of IL-6 in bone 
metabolism is not well defined and the current data are conflicting. In order to dissect the potential 
detrimental effects of IL-6R inhibition on the bone long term data are needed evaluating e.g. the effect 
of therapy on bone mineral density. Data on concomitant corticosteroid use are needed. The MAH is 
going to address this with the long term data of WA18221 (phase II and III) as detailed in the RMP. 
Resumption of growth and physical development: This highly relevant beneficial effect requires long 
term data that are not available but will be collected in the long term extension of WA18221 as 
detailed in the RMP. 
Remission of disease: Based on the available data it is uncertain whether inhibition of IL-6R is 
necessary long-term or whether remission can be obtained without treatment with tocilizumab after a 
defined treatment phase. The MAH is planning to address this in part with the investigation of different 
dosing regimen in the extension phase (Part III of study WA18221 will assess the long-term durability 
and magnitude of the tocilizumab efficacy response in patients with sJIA including meeting the 
definition of inactive disease and clinical remission) as mentioned in the RMP. 
Decreased inflammatory burden, Prevention of amyloidosis: Amyloidosis is a rare complication 
nowadays. From the demonstrated effect of tocilizmab treatment on SAA there is little doubt that 
amyloidosis could be prevented if it were still a major clinical problem. More difficult is the question 
whether a “decreased inflammatory burden” will decrease the cardiovascular risk in the future.

Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Overall, the qualitative safety profile of tocilizumab in children as demonstrated in the data for 
systemic idiopathic arthritis appears to be generally comparable to data on rheumatoid arthritis in 
adults. The following unfavourable effects were observed: 
Infection: Infections are in general increased in tocilizumab treated patients. Serious infections 
occurred with increasing incidence in the longer term studies. For the long term extension of the 
pivotal trial SAE infections and infestations are reported with 11.3 per 100 patient years. The main 
confounding factor is concomitant corticosteroid use. Based on the type and severity of infection 
observed thus far, with the exception of bacterial arthritis and pneumonia, there is no specific concern. 
Bacterial arthritis has been reported to be more common in adult patients with rheumatoid arthritis, 
whether this is the case in children is unknown. The SmPC provides adequate guidance under “Special 
warnings and precautions for use”; also the educational programme addresses this safety aspect. 
Anaphylaxis: Life threatening anaphylaxis has occurred in one patient in the placebo controlled part. 
This is a medically highly significant event. The SmPC as well as the educational programme provide 
adequate guidance on serious hypersensitivity reactions and their management. 
Neutropenia: Neutropenia is clearly increased in tocilizumab treated patients, it is reversible on 
discontinuation and not unfavourable per se, it is the assumed association with infection that defines 
its role as unfavourable. Relevant information is provided in the SmPC and the educational 
programme. 
AST/ALT/bilirubin elevation: In general, the medical significance of the observed elevation of 
transaminases and bilirubin is unclear. Guidance for monitoring of these laboratory changes is provided 
in the SmPC.  
Thrombocytopenia: Thrombocytopenia has been observed, which could be a medically important event 
if associated with bleeding. The SmPC indicated these aspects. 
Hypercholesterolaemia: Hypercholesterolaemia is a cardiovascular risk factor. Small increments are 
noted for the total population, for individuals with a high baseline this increase could become relevant. 
Guidance for monitoring is provided in the SmPC.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
As established for tociliziumab for the adult indication, there are areas with uncertainty about the 
unfavourable effects. These are addressed in the SmPC and through risk minimisation activities 
described in the risk management plan, as appropriate. Regarding the above indicated unfavourable 
effects observed in the paediatric studies to support the present extension application, the following 
observations are made: 
Infection: The uncertainties relate to the unknown potential for serious opportunistic infections and the 
unknown incidence of fatal infections. This issue is closely related to MAS (see below) and to 
neutropenia. 
Anaphylaxis: It is an unfavourable effect that cannot be predicted based on pre-clinical data. So far 
immunogenicity appears not to be a common occurrence but this may change with different 
background therapy e.g. reduced corticosteroid use. Uncertainties relate to the difficulty in diagnosing 
hypersensitivity reactions, they may in fact be underdiagnosed, and defining the most appropriate 
strategy for identifying patients that should be discontinued from treatment. 
Assessment report for  
EMA/455878/2011  
Page 69/72
 
 
 
Neutropenia: Neutropenia is by general medical knowledge expected to be associated with infection. 
However, this relationship has not been unequivocally been established for tocilizumab. At present it is 
regarded that there is a high likelihood of a causal relationship between severe neutropenia and 
infection, however there is no proof from the data. 
AST/ALT/bilirubin elevation: Uncertainties relate to the unknown consequences of long-time mild to 
moderate transaminase elevations. It is unknown whether a mere shift in baseline, that appears likely 
from the provided data, may have long-term consequences. 
Thrombocytopenia: The occurrence is relatively well described however, the risk of haemorrhage is 
uncertain, but not regarded as high considering the data in paediatric population so far.  
Hypercholesterolaemia: The increase in cardiovascular risk that would be attributable to long term 
cholesterol increase is unknown. 
Further to these areas of uncertainties, there are other potential unfavourable effects: 
MAS/HLH: MAS can be the consequence of insufficient treatment, but can also be triggered by infection 
and potentially by certain drugs. The occurrence of MAS in the main trial supporting the sJIA indication 
and the extension studies appears to compare favourably to literature data. However, the reported 
incidences cover a wide range and a clear picture could only be generated by a long term comparative 
trial which is not feasible. Triggering of MAS could also follow hypersensitivity reactions and infections, 
AE that could become more frequent with longer standing IL-6 receptor blockade. This safety aspect 
has therefore been added to the SmPC and to the educational programme. 
Pneumothorax: From the mechanism of action the causal relationship of pneumothorax to therapy is 
uncertain. One possible pneumothorax with fatal outcome was observed. Considering the incidence of 
pneumothorax in general it is less likely that this is a chance event, although this cannot be excluded. 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia: This was reported as an AE in a Japanese study, there are also cases 
flagged in the WA18221 study report. Hypogammaglobulinaemia is associated with an increased risk of 
infections. Uncertainty exists about the rate of occurrence long term because of lack of long term study 
data. If confirmed this conveys with a higher likelihood and increased risk of infections. This will be 
followed through routine pharmacovigilance activities and additional surveillance through registries and 
studies as detailed in the RMP. 
Masking of infectious complications/ “false negative CRP”: Efficient IL-6R blockade theoretically inhibits 
the acute phase response to infection, CRP for example could be a less reliable marker and fever 
response would also be attenuated. There is uncertainty whether these observed effects lead to a delay 
in the diagnosis of infections. In the end severity of infection would be a “composite” of the infection 
per se and the delay of diagnosis. The SmPC as well as the educational programme provide respective 
guidance. 
Vaccine inefficacy: Interventions in components of the immune system harbour the risk of a decrease 
of wanted immunogenicity. In the absence of specific data with tocilizumab a dedicated study of the 
effects of TCZ on vaccination to evaluate the effects of tocilizumab on vaccination in subjects with 
active rheumatoid arthritis receiving background methotrexate is currently planned as detailed in the 
RMP.

Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
There is a high unmet medical need for the treatment of patients with sJIA. The observed responses as 
regards symptoms and signs are very important and constitute the primary goal of any treatment. The 
strength of the data lies in an effect that could be regarded as remission in a considerable fraction of 
patients. Reduction in corticosteroid dose is another very important goal of treatment for the 
prevention of corticosteroid induced side effects. Correction of anaemia is of lesser importance but may 
be indicative of an influence on disease activity overall. Functional improvement by itself is of lesser 
importance. 
The most important unfavourable effects are infections and neutropenia because of the risk of 
permanent consequences (e.g. joint destruction). As part of the pharmacovigilance activities, 
anaphylaxis needs to be monitored if the incidence of severe/serious reactions increases. 
Transaminase elevations are of importance because of the involvement of a vital organ and the 
unknown long term consequences. Thrombocytopenia without bleeding is of lesser importance and 
hypercholesterolaemia is considered less important for short term considerations, but needs to be 
monitored for long term benefit/risk considerations. The SmPC and the Risk Management Plan 
adequately addresses these safety-related topics. In addition, a dedicated educational programme 
provides information and guidance. In addition, the MAH will perform a study to investigate the 
possibility of dose reduction for AE (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, liver enzyme abnormalities) in 
sJIA patients as detailed in the RMP. 
Benefit-risk balance 
The demonstrated beneficial effects on symptoms and sign of disease and associated functional 
improvement as well as the possibility to reduce corticosteroid treatment as demonstrated in the 
pivotal trial outweigh the most important risk of increase in infections, risk of neutropenia and

Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
The benefit risk assessment is based on the short term data in a controlled setting and longer term 
uncontrolled data with a small sample up to one year. These data are considered appropriate based on 
a high unmet medical need in a disease with limited treatment options. 
Overall, the efficacy as demonstrated with these data is considered of high clinical relevance. Because 
of the small sample size and the short follow-up there are uncertainties around the incidence of severe 
events such as anaphylaxis, serious infections, opportunistic infections and long term effect on the liver 
as well as the beneficial effect on disease activity. Nevertheless, these uncertainties do not offset the 
demonstrated beneficial effects and the potential beneficial effects on disease activity and long term 
outcome that may even be the true, although not obtainable, indicators of benefit for the patient. It is 
noted that the appropriate dose in the long term setting needs further monitoring; the applicant will 
investigate different dosing strategies in the ongoing extension of the pivotal trial as detailed in the 
RMP, which is deemed acceptable. The MAH will also perform a study to investigate the possibility of 
dose reduction for AE (thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, liver enzyme abnormalities) in sJIA patients as 
detailed in the RMP. 
It is necessary to generate long term data through a systematic collection of as many patient data as 
possible in a comprehensive fashion e.g. under registry conditions. Given that sJIA may be a life long 
disease in a subset of patient and given that a number of off label treatments are used in clinical

practice it is important to follow these patients long term, in particular because disease complications 
that are usually reserved to the adult domain may become important, e.g. accelerated cardiovascular 
disease. The applicant will provide updates from several European registries including BSRBER, ARTIS 
and RABBIT. 
The following indication is therefore agreed for section 4.1 of the SmPC: 
“RoActemra is indicated for the treatment of active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis (sJIA) in 
patients 2 years of age and older, who have responded inadequately to previous therapy with NSAIDs 
and systemic corticosteroids. RoActemra can be given as monotherapy (in case of intolerance to MTX 
or where treatment with MTX is inappropriate) or in combination with MTX”. 
3.  Conclusion 
On 19 May 2011 the CHMP considered this following variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II Labelling and 
Package Leaflet. 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the MAH taking into account the provisions of 
Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and considered the indication to be new and that it is 
held to bring a significant clinical benefit in the absence of existing therapies (see appendix).

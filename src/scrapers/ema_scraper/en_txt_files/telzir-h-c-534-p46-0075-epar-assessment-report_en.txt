Introduction 
On July 2014, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for TELZIR, in accordance with Article 
46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
TELZIR (fosamprenavir calcium, FPV) film-coated tablets and oral suspension were approved by the 
European Commission for use in combination with low dose ritonavir (RTV) and other antiretroviral 
agents for the treatment of HIV infection in children 6 years and above on 13 September 2007. 
Since the time of approval of the paediatric indication for TELZIR, further paediatric data have become 
available. 
Study APV29005 was designed to determine the PK, safety and tolerability, and anti-viral activity of 
FPV BID in PI-naïve HIV-1 infected children aged 2 to <6 years and FPV/RTV BID in PI-naïve or PI-
experienced HIV-1 infected children aged 2 to 18 years. Although the primary endpoint of the study 
was completed after the last enrolled subject had finished 48 weeks on investigational product, the 
study remained open so that children already enrolled in the study would continue to have access to 
the oral FPV formulation until they no longer derived any clinical benefit from FPV, were switched by 
the investigator to a different PI or were able to transition to the adult tablet formulation in countries 
where the oral formulation was not yet approved at the recommended dosing or was not commercially 
available. 
This Post Authorisation Measure (PAM) “stand alone” submission therefore provides the current CSR 
which is the final report with all final data for this completed study.  
Specifically: 
- 
The new safety and efficacy data on the six subjects ongoing at the data cut-off date for the 48-
week CSR. 
-  Any changes to the safety and tolerability using data collected post 48 weeks, because despite 
being planned as a 48-week study, the majority of subjects (65/109; 60%) had >96 weeks of 
exposure to study treatment, with a median duration of exposure of 138 weeks (range: 2 to 258 
weeks). 
There is no approved Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP), and no changes to the paediatric indication or 
the Product Information for TELZIR are proposed. 
Scientific discussion 
Information on the development program 
Three Phase II studies – Study APV29005, Study APV20003, and Study APV20002 – form the basis of 
the paediatric development program. Study APV20002 remains ongoing in children enrolled between 
the ages of 4 weeks to <2 years although recruitment is complete. 
While Study APV29005 is considered pivotal, Study APV20003 and Study APV20002 provide supportive 
safety data with Study APV20003 also contributing to information on resistance. In Study APV29005 
and Study APV20003, 158 paediatric subjects 2 to 18 years received at least one dose of FPV/RTV. In 
Study APV20002, 54 subjects received twice daily FPV/RTV while 5 subjects received only single doses 
of FPV with or without RTV.

Study APV29005 was designed to evaluate a BID regimen of FPV in PI-naïve subjects 2 to <6 years of 
age and a BID regimen of FPV/RTV in PI-naïve and -experienced subjects 2 to 18 years of age. This 
submission contains the post 48-week data from Study APV29005. 
Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
TELZIR was administered as either oral 700 mg tablets or 50 mg/mL oral suspension. 
Clinical aspects 
1. 
Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for study APV29005. 
Assessor’s comment: 
The design, baseline characteristics and Week 48 results of this study have already been discussed as 
part  of  the  FUM  046  and  the  variation  II/74  of  TELZIR.  Only  post-week  48  results  were  discussed  in 
this CSR. 
2. 
Clinical study 
Study APV29005: A 48 Week, Phase II, Non-Comparative, Open-Label, Multi-Cohort, Multicenter 
Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, Pharmacokinetics and Antiviral Activity of 
Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir BID when Administered to HIV-1 Infected, PI-naive and Experienced, 
Paediatric Subjects, 2 to 18 Years Old and of Fosamprenavir BID Administered to PI-naive, Paediatric 
Subjects 2 to < 6 Years Old. 
Methods 
• 
Primary objectives 
- To define the FPV/RTV BID dosage regimen(s) which provided target steady-state plasma APV 
exposure to paediatric subjects 2 to 18 years of age. 
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of FPV/RTV BID in combination therapy for 48 weeks in HIV-1 
infected, PI-naïve and PI-experienced, paediatric subjects 2 to 18 years of age. 
- To define the FPV BID dosage regimen(s) which provided target steady-state plasma APV exposure to 
paediatric subjects 2 to <6 years of age. 
- To evaluate the safety and tolerability of FPV BID in combination therapy for 48 weeks in HIV-1 
infected, PI-naive, paediatric subjects 2 to <6 years of age. 
• 
Study design 
Enrolment was initially opened to Cohorts 1A, 1B, 2 and 3 and occurred in parallel for paediatric 
subjects 2 to 18 years of age:  
Assessment report under article 46  
EMA/642265/2014  
Page 4/11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Each investigational product (FPV or FPV/RTV) was administered with 2 active NRTIs selected by 
investigator. 
Once enrolment in any given age defined cohort was complete, further subjects in that age range may 
start enrolling in Cohort 4, provided Cohort 4 is open for recruitment for the appropriate age range. 
• 
Study population /Sample size 
Subjects from 2 to 18 years old. 
Planned: 78 (FPV/RTV: 62; FPV: 16) - Enrolled: 110 - Treated: 109 (FPV/RTV: 89; FPV: 20). 
• 
Treatments 
Subjects received FPV BID (Cohort 1A) or FPV/RTV BID (Cohorts 1B, 2, 3 and 4). The dosage regimens 
were modified by amendments according to the Week 24 interim results: 
For Cohort 3, the majority of subjects in this age group received the standard adult regimen of 
FPV/RTV 700/100 mg BID regimen whereas, a few received the FPV oral suspension at a dose of 
FPV/RTV 15/3 mg/kg BID. A dose change for suspension to 18/3 mg/kg BID was implemented in 
Amendment 3. 
To ensure that the paediatric subjects did not maintain concentrations higher than those observed in 
adults, an upper PK target was defined as a plasma APV AUC(0-τ) value of 61.68 μg.h/mL at the Week 
2 visit or a plasma APV Cτ value of 3.52 μg/mL at subsequent visits (where only trough sampling was 
conducted), representing the 95th percentile observed in adults receiving FPV/RTV 700/100 mg BID. 
The doses of each of the drugs given were to be recalculated at each visit and the total daily dose was 
adjusted according to the child’s weight and the recommended dosage regimen. Dose adjustments 
should have occurred when the dose changed by 10% or more from the subject’s prior calculated dose. 
A background regimen of 2 active NRTIs was coadministered with FPV or FPV/RTV. 
Post-Week 48 Results 
This abbreviated clinical study report (CSR) presents the final analysis with all data collected in this 
study through 29 July 2013. Only 6 subjects continued in the study after the March 31 2011 cut-off 
date for the Week 48 CSR and therefore the focus for the current abbreviated CSR is any changes in 
safety and efficacy data that have occurred since that date. 
The current analyses of protocol defined virologic failure include all subjects who met the criteria at 
any point after their Week 48 assessment and therefore contain information from more than just the 6

ongoing subjects. The Week 48 CSR for this study included all data collected by the March 31 2011 
data cutoff date for the report with the exception of protocol defined virologic failure analyses which 
were censored at 48 weeks. At this time, 96 subjects had at least 48 weeks of exposure to study drug, 
with 77 subjects having evaluable viral load data at Week 60 and an overall median exposure to study 
drug of 127 weeks.

Assessor’s comment: 
Post-Week 48 PK results did not change the overall conclusion that:

plasma  APV  exposures  achieved  following  FPV/RTV  23/3  mg/kg  BID  in  2  to  <6  year  old  subjects 
were ~50% higher than that observed in adults.  
plasma  APV  exposures  achieved  in  6  to  18  year  old  subjects  were  similar  than  that  observed  in 
adults.  
• 
Efficacy results 
The proportions analysis of the observed viral load data were very similar to results reported in the 
Week 48 CSR. At least 67% of subjects across the treatment groups achieved HIV-1 RNA <400 
copies/mL by Week 48 in the Observed analysis. At Week 48, a higher proportion of PI-naïve subjects 
(78% and 86% in the FPV and FPV/RTV treatment groups, respectively) achieved HIV-1 RNA <400 
copies/mL compared to the PI-experienced subjects (67%) in the FPV/RTV treatment group. By Week 
144, 88% (14/16) of PI-naïve subjects in the FPV treatment group and 90% (18/20) of PI-naïve 
subjects in the FPV/RTV treatment group achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL compared to 
83% (15/18) in the PI-experienced FPV/RTV treatment group. By Week 216, all of the remaining 
subjects in all groups achieved plasma HIV-1 RNA <400 copies/mL.

A total of 33/109 (30%) of subjects met the reporting analysis plan-defined virologic failure (VF) 
criteria from Day 1 through the end of the study, including 7 subjects on FPV-containing regimens and 
26 on FPV/RTV containing regimens. Of those 33 subjects, 25 of these met RAP-defined VF criteria 
through Week 48 while 8 subjects met VF after Week 48. Of the latter group, 7/8 subjects were 
receiving FPV/RTV-containing ART regimens while 1 was receiving an FPV-only containing ART 
regimen. Overall, the majority (25/33; 76%) of the subjects with RAP defined VF were > 5 years or 
older at study entry. The proportion of VF subjects who were > 6 years or older at study entry was 
similar through Week 48 (19/25; 76%) and post Week 48 (6/8; 75%). 
Paired genotype data was available for analysis of treatment emergent viral mutations and RS from 
22/33 subjects with VF. Overall, treatment-emergent NRTI and PI mutations were detected in viruses 
from 6 subjects at VF by Week 48 and in 5 subjects post Week 48. These included a total of four ART-
naïve subjects receiving unboosted FPV-containing regimens, three of whom met VF prior to Week 48. 
Virus from all 4 subjects selected for the M184V mutation at VF, and virus from 3 of the 4 subjects also 
developed RS to FPV at VF. The remaining 7 VF subjects with treatment-emergent viral mutations were 
all on FPV/RTV-containing regimens. Of these, 3 occurred prior to Week 48; and all 3 subjects were 
heavily treatment-experienced; virus from 2 subjects had treatment-emergent protease mutations and 
developed FPV RS, while the third had treatment-emergent M184V. Post Week 48, 3 of the 4 subjects 
with VF on FPV/RTV-containing regimens were treatment-experienced and one was ART-naïve at study 
start. Virus from the latter subject selected for the RT mutation M184I at VF but did not select any PI 
mutation and subsequently experienced viral resuppression and remained suppressed for 48 weeks 
until study withdrawal while for the 3 treatment-experienced VF subjects, virus from 2 subjects had 
treatment-emergent M184V mutations at V; virus from 2 subjects had treatment-emergent PRO 
mutations at VF although only virus from one of the subjects developed RS to FPV. Treatment-
emergent RS to FPV was detected at VF in virus from 6 subjects; 3 from subjects on FPV-containing 
regimens and 3 from treatment-experienced subjects on FPV/RTV-containing regimens. 
Assessor’s comment: 
Assessment report under article 46  
EMA/642265/2014

Because  of  the  study  discontinuation  of  many  subjects  after  week  48  (due  to  insufficient  viral  load 
response,  protocol  violation  or  patient  wish)  and  the  low  number  of  subjects  still  in  treatment,  it  is 
difficult to conclude on the long-term efficacy of FPV in these subjects. 
Nonetheless,  when  considering  the  virologic  failure  (VF)  population,  the  rate  of  VF  is  similar  through 
week 48 and after. 
Overall, given that current indication of TELZIR includes children from 6 years old, there is no concern 
about long-term efficacy of FPV in paediatric subjects. 
• 
Safety results 
FPV and FPV/RTV were generally well-tolerated when administered to children in this study. No new 
safety concerns with either the oral suspension or the tablet formulation have emerged since the Week 
48 analysis cut-off date, including when treatment was prolonged in many subjects (median 138 
weeks; range: 2 to 258 weeks). 
Assessor’s comment: 
Post-Week  48  safety  results  did  not  change  the  safety  profile  of  TELZIR.  No  death  was  reported. 
Change  from  baseline  in  the  clinical  chemistry  and  hematology  parameters  were  similar  at  Week  48 
and Week 96:

Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
Overall conclusion 
These long-term results did not provide long-term efficacy or safety concerns. These results did not 
impact the current paediatric indication and posology, without modification of the safety profile of 
TELZIR.

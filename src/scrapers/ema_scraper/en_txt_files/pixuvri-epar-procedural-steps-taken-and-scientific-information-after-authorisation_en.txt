are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

SmPC, Annex 
The CHMP, having reviewed the available information on 
II and PL 
the status of the fulfilment of Specific Obligations and 
having confirmed the positive benefit risk balance, is of the 
opinion that the quality, safety and efficacy of this 
medicinal product continue to be adequately and 
sufficiently demonstrated. Furthermore, the CHMP 
considered that, as all Specific Obligations have been 
fulfilled, there are no remaining grounds for the marketing 
authorisations to remain conditional and therefore 
recommends the granting of the MA no longer subject to 
Specific Obligations for Pixuvri.

SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN 
Summary of risk management plan for CRYSVITA (burosumab) 
This  is  a  summary  of  the  risk  management  plan  (RMP)  for  CRYSVITA.  The  RMP  details 
important risks of CRYSVITA, how these risks can be minimised, and how more information 
will be obtained about CRYSVITA’s risks and uncertainties (missing information). 
CRYSVITA’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give essential 
information to healthcare professionals and patients on how CRYSVITA should be used.  
This summary of the RMP for CRYSVITA should be read in the context of all this information 
including the assessment report of the evaluation and its plain-language summary, all which is 
part of the European Public Assessment Report (EPAR).  
Important  new  concerns  or  changes  to  the  current  ones  will  be  included  in  updates  of 
CRYSVITA’s RMP. 
I The Medicine and What it is Used For 
CRYSVITA is authorised for the treatment of X-linked hypophosphataemia in children 1 year 
of age and older when there is radiographic evidence of bone disease, and in adults.  It contains 
burosumab as the active substance and it is given by subcutaneous injection. 
CRYSVITA  is  authorised  for  the  treatment  of  FGF23-related  tumour-induced  osteomalacia 
(TIO) associated with phosphaturic mesenchymal tumours that cannot be curatively resected or 
localised in patients aged 1 year and over. 
Further information about the evaluation of CRYSVITA’s benefits can be found in 
CRYSVITA’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the European 
Medicines Agency (EMA) website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
http://www.ema.europa.eu/ema/index.jsp?curl=pages/medicines/human/medicines/004275/hu
man_med_002224.jsp&mid=WC0b01ac058001d124. 
II Risks Associated with the Medicine and Activities to Minimise or Further Characterise 
the Risks 
Important risks of CRYSVITA together with measures to minimise such risks and the proposed 
studies for learning more about CRYSVITA’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct use, in the 
package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare professionals. 
Important advice on the medicine’s packaging. 
• 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so to ensure 
that the medicine is used correctly. 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient (e.g. with 
or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In  addition  to  these measures, information  about adverse reactions is  collected continuously 
and regularly analysed, including Periodic Safety Update Report (PSUR) assessment, so that 
immediate  action  can  be 
taken  as  necessary.  These  measures  constitute  routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.  
If important information that may affect the safe use of CRYSVITA is not yet available, it is 
listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
II.A List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of CRYSVITA are risks that need special risk management activities to further 
investigate  or  minimise  the  risk,  so  that  the  medicinal  product  can  be  safely  administered. 
Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks are concerns for which 
there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of CRYSVITA. Potential risks are concerns for 
which an association with the use of this medicine is possible based on available data, but this 
association  has  not  been  established  yet  and  needs  further  evaluation.  Missing  information 
refers to information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs 
to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine). 
A summary of the important risks and missing information for CRYSVITA is provided in Table 
1.

II.B Summary of Important Risks

Data  are  currently  insufficient  to  determine  risk  groups/factors  for 
potential hyperphosphataemia related to burosumab therapy. This will 
be  monitored  as  part  of  ongoing  routine  pharmacovigilance  for  this 
product; it will be further assessed in Phase 3 studies, planned longer 
term  extension  studies  and  the  proposed  Post-Authorisation  Safety 
Study.

Important potential risk – ectopic mineralisation  
Evidence for linking the risk to the 
medicine 
Risk factors and risk groups 
Potential  risk  highlighted  in  non-clinical  and  clinical  development 
programmes. 
With conventional therapy, ectopic mineralisation is driven by urinary 
phosphate  wasting,  hyperparathyroidism,  hypercalcaemia,  and 
hypercalciuria, resulting from excess oral phosphate and 1,25(OH)2D 
dosing. In earlier literature, the prevalence of nephrocalcinosis was up 
to 100% with conventional therapy and related to aggressive treatment. 
Even  with  new  treatment  guidelines,  up  to  26%  of  adult  subjects 
entering the burosumab development programme, who were naïve to 
burosumab  treatment  and  who  were  previously  exposed  to  oral 
phosphate  and/or  1,25(OH)2D  therapy,  were  noted  to  have  ectopic 
mineralisation  on kidney ultrasound at baseline.  
Cardiac  valve  or  aortic  calcifications  have  been  reported  in  XLH 
subjects  on  phosphate 
tertiary 
therapy  with  secondary  or 
hyperparathyroidism (Moltz et al. 2001), (Sun et al. 2013).   
Hyperphosphataemia  is  also  invariably  present  in  end-stage  renal 
disease.  Qunibi reported complications of hyperphosphataemia in this 
population, which can be directly applicable to XLH patients.  These 
complications 
and 
secondary 
cardiovascular  calcifications  including  haemodynamic  disturbances 
(e.g. increased cardiac stroke index, increased systolic and decreased 
diastolic blood pressure, increased pulse pressure, and increased pulse 
wave  velocity)  and  widespread  cardiovascular  calcifications  (e.g. 
coronary artery, cardiac valves, myocardium, etc.).  He further stated 
that cardiovascular calcification has been linked to an increased risk of 
cardiovascular  events, 
fatal 
arrhythmia,  congestive  heart  failure,  and  valvular  heart  disease 
(Qunibi 2004).

•  Treatment  of  hypophosphataemia  with  conventional  therapies 
(vitamin D and phosphate replacement) is believed to lead to sharp

XLH (Schmitt et al. 2004)

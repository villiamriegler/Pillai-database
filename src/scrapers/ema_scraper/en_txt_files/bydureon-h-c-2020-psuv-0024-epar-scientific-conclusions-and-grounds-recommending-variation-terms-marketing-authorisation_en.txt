Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR for Bydureon, the scientific conclusions of 
PRAC are as follows:  
Rapid weight loss at a rate of >1.5 kg per week is a known risk factor in patients treated with exenatide. 
Weight loss of this rate may have harmful consequences, such as cholelitiasis. Therefore, in view of 
available data regarding occurrence of cholelithiasis linked to the rapid weight loss during exenatide 
treatment, the PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted. In addition, due 
to increase experience with the use of exenatide administered once weekly and evidence the spontaneous 
reports of several adverse reactions, additional changes to product information of exenatide administered 
once weekly were warranted.  
Therefore, in view of available data regarding rapid weight loss and postmarketing safety reports, the 
PRAC considered that changes to the product information were warranted.  
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds recommending the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation  
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for BYDUREON, the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product containing the active substance EXENATIDE is favourable subject to the 
proposed changes to the product information. 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the Marketing Authorisation should be varied.

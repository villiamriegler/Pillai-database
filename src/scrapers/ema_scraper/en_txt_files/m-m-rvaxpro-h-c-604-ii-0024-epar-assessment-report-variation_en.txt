3  Scientific discussion  
3.1  Introduction 
M-M-RVAXPRO (Measles, Mumps, and Rubella Virus Vaccine Live) is a live virus vaccine for vaccination 
against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR), which is produced using recombinant human serum 
albumin (rHA). 
The reconstituted vaccine is for subcutaneous and intramuscular administration. When reconstituted as 
directed, the dose for injection is 0.5 ml. 
The European Commission granted a marketing authorisation valid throughout the European Union for 
M-M-RVAXPRO on 5 May 2006. 
M-M-RVAXPRO is currently indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps and rubella 
in individuals 12 months of age or older. It is administered intramuscularly or subcutaneously. 
The modification sought in this application is to obtain approval for the extension of the indication to 
include administration to healthy children from 9 months of age under special circumstances, in 
accordance with official recommendations or when an early protection is considered necessary. 
This application is supported by the results of study MRV02C, an open-label, randomised, comparative, 
multi-centre study of the immunogenicity and safety of a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad (a live vaccine 
against measles, mumps, rubella, and varicella manufactured by Merck & Co., Inc.containing the same 
MMR components of M-M-RVAXPRO) manufactured with rHA administered to healthy children from 9 
months of age.

General comments on compliance with GMP, GLP, GCP  
All studies fully adhered to GCP guidelines of the CHMP and Directive 91/507/EEC of the European 
Union. All studies were closely monitored by the MAH or a contract organisation for compliance to the 
protocols and procedures described in them. 
3.2  Clinical aspects 
In some European countries, the current official recommendations for measles, mumps and rubella 
vaccination are below 12 months of age. In France for instance, it is recommended to administer the 
measles, mumps and rubella vaccines from 9 months of age for children in day care. In Germany, the 
standing committee on vaccination recommends measles, mumps and rubella vaccination from 11 
months of age and the WHO recommends vaccinating children from 9 months of age against measles. 
In order to support the proposed change data from one clinical trial (study MRV02C) were submitted. 
Study MRV02C compared immunogenicity and safety at different ages at the time of Dose 1, using a 2-
dose schedule of ProQuad, an MMRV vaccine, which consists of the same measles, mumps and rubella 
components as contained in M-M-RVAXPRO.  
Clinical efficacy 
Study: MRV02C 
Study MRV02C is an open-label, randomised, comparative, multi-centre study designed to demonstrate 
that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at a 3 month interval to different age groups of 
healthy children at the time of the first dose (9 months or 11 months of age) is non-inferior to those 
who received the first dose at 12 months of age in terms of antibody response rates. The study was 
conducted in 3 countries (Finland, Germany, France) between November 2007 and December 2008. 
Study design 
In this phase 3b study, a total of 1,620 subjects were randomised in one of 3 groups (first dose at 9, 
11 or 12 months of age, 1:1:1; 540 subjects per group), to receive 2 doses of ProQuad at a 3-month 
interval. The same interval of time was to be respected between Dose 1 and Dose 2 of ProQuad in each 
group in order to solely evaluate the impact of the vaccination age on a unique vaccination pattern.  
The schedule of vaccinations and blood sample collections is shown in Table 1. Blood samples were 
obtained from subjects just prior to ProQuad dose 1 vaccination (blood sample 1), 42 days (±14) after 
ProQuad dose 1 vaccination (blood sample 2), and 42 days (±14) after ProQuad dose 2 vaccination 
(blood sample 3).

Study objectives 
The objectives of study MRV02C were as follows: 
 
 
 
 
 
The first primary objective was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at 
a 3-month interval to healthy children of 11 months of age at the time of Dose 1 (group 2) is as 
immunogenic as in healthy children of 12 months of age at the time of Dose 1 (group 3), in terms 
of antibody response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and varicella at Day 42 following Dose 2. 
The  second  primary  objective,  which  was  to  be  evaluated  only  if  the  first  primary  objective  was 
reached, was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at a 3-month interval 
to  healthy  children  of  9  months  of  age  at  the  time  of  Dose  1  (group  1)  is  as  immunogenic  as  in 
healthy  children  of  12  months  of  age  at  the  time  of  Dose  1  (group  3),  in  terms  of  antibody 
response rates to measles, mumps, rubella and to varicella at Day 42 following Dose 2.  
The third primary objective was to demonstrate that a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad administered at 
a 3-month interval to healthy children of 11 months of age (group 2) and 9 months of age at the 
time of Dose 1 (group 1) is well tolerated compared to healthy children of 12 months of age at the 
time of Dose 1.  
The secondary immunogenicity objectives were to describe the antibody titres to measles, mumps, 
rubella  and  varicella  at  Day  42  following  Dose  1  and  Dose  2  of  ProQuad  administered  to  healthy 
children from 9 months of age.  
The  secondary  safety  objectives  were  to  evaluate  the  safety  profile  of  Dose  1  and  Dose  2  of 
ProQuad administered to healthy children from 9 months of age. 
The primary endpoints for immunogenicity were the antibody response rates, which were defined as: 
  Measles antibody titre >=255 mIU/mL in subjects with baseline titre <255 mIU/mL. 
  Mumps antibody titre >=10 ELISA Ab units/mL in subjects with baseline titre <10 ELISA Ab 
units/mL. 
  Rubella antibody titre >=10 IU/mL in subjects with baseline titre <10 IU/mL. 
  Varicella antibody titre >=5 gpELISA/mL in subjects with baseline titre <1.25 gpELISA/mL. 
Serology Assays 
Antibodies to measles, mumps, and rubella were determined by validated enzyme-linked 
immunosorbent assays (ELISA).

Statistical methods 
The Full Analysis Set (FAS) consisted of all randomised subjects who received at least one dose of the 
study vaccine and with any postvaccination immunogenicity evaluation. 
The Per Protocol Set (PPS) was defined as all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol 
violations which may interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation. 
Two subsets of the Per Protocol Set were defined for the immunogenicity evaluation at the 
corresponding time point, i.e.: 
  PPS1  consisted of all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol violation(s) which may 
interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation post-Dose 1. 
  PPS2  consisted of all randomised subjects excluding subjects with protocol violation(s) which may 
interfere with the immunogenicity evaluation post-Dose 2. 
Analysis of the immunogenicity 
The immunogenicity analysis of the primary criteria was performed on the PPS1 in initially 
seronegative subjects (main analysis) and on the FAS (supportive analysis). 
For the Per Protocol analysis, only initially seronegative subjects were included in the analyses of the 
corresponding valence: 
 
 
 
 
For  measles,  subjects  with  baseline  (BS1)  measles  antibody  titres  <255  mIU/mL  (i.e.  initially 
seronegative to measles), 
For  mumps,  subjects  with  baseline  (BS1)  mumps  antibody  titres  <10.0  ELISA  Ab  units/mL  (i.e. 
initially seronegative to mumps), 
For  rubella,  subjects  with  baseline  (BS1)  rubella  antibody  titres  <10.0  IU/mL  (i.e.  initially 
seronegative to rubella), 
For  varicella,  subjects  with  baseline  (BS1)  varicella  antibody  titres  <1.25  gpELISA  units/mL  (i.e. 
initially seronegative to varicella). 
The immunogenicity analysis of the secondary criteria was performed on both PPS in initially 
seronegative subjects and FAS. Also, descriptive statistics were provided on initially seropositive 
subjects at inclusion, if seropositive subjects represent at least 5% of the FAS.  
All subjects with serology results following Dose 2 of ProQuad were included in the FAS whatever 
antibody titres at baseline (BS1). 
In relation with the first primary hypothesis, the estimates of the between groups differences in 
response rates (Group 2 - Group 3) were calculated together with their two-sided 95% CI. If the lower 
bounds of the CI were greater than –5% for measles, mumps and rubella response rates and greater 
than -10% for varicella response rate, it was concluded that the Group 2 response rates are non-
inferior to the Group 3 response rates. 
If the first primary objective was reached, the second primary hypothesis was tested. The estimates of 
the between groups differences in response rates (Group 1 - Group 3) were calculated together with 
their two-sided 95% CI. If the lower bounds of the CI were greater than –5% for measles, mumps and 
rubella response rates and greater than -10% for varicella response rate, it was concluded that the 
Group 1 response rates are non-inferior to the Group 3 response rates.

A total of 1,626 subjects were enrolled between 29 November 2007 and 14 April 2008. Six subjects 
were not randomised either due to protocol deviation or due to other reasons. 
Randomised subjects were enrolled in three countries: 1,290 subjects (79.6%) into 15 centres in 
Finland, 140 subjects (8.6%) into 14 centres in France, and 190 subjects (11.7%) into 19 centres in 
Germany. 
A total of 161 subjects (9.9%) were withdrawn from the study. The majority of subjects (137; 8.5%) 
were withdrawn before first vaccination, 18 subjects (1.1%) between first and second vaccination and 
six subjects (0.4%) after receiving the second vaccine dose. Given the differences in time between 
randomisation and first vaccination in the 3 groups, and taken into account in the determination of the 
sample size, the number of subjects withdrew from the study before Dose 1 was higher in Group 2 
(first dose at 11 months) and Group 3 (first dose at 12 months), 10.4% and 12.8% of subjects 
respectively, than in Group 1 (first dose at 9 months), 2.2% of subjects.The main reason for 
withdrawal was for personal reason but 3 subjects were withdrawn for adverse events: 1 subject from 
Group 3 before Dose 1 (viral infection), and 2 subjects from Group 1 after Dose 1 due to serious 
adverse events assessed by the investigator as non-related to study vaccine (one subject for 
convulsion 2 months after vaccination and one subject for gastroenteritis rotavirus).The Full Analysis 
Set consisted of 1,473 subjects (90.9%): 527 subjects in Group 1, 480 subjects in Group 2 and 466 
subjects in Group 3. 
The PPS consisted of 1,446 subjects (89.3%) and the PPS1 consisted of 1,426 subjects (88.0%) 
including 519 subjects in Group 1, 460 subjects in Group 2 and 447 subjects in Group 3.  
Demographic and other baseline characteristics were comparable between groups except for gender: 
Groups 1 and 2 were constituted of 48% of boys and 52% of girls whereas in Group 3, the gender 
distribution was 52% of boys and 48% of girls. Overall, mean (+/-standard deviation [SD]) age at 
inclusion was 9.48 (+/-0.30) months, mean weight was 9.22 (+/-1.14) kg, and mean height was 
72.96 (+/-2.64) cm. 
At first vaccination, mean (+/- SD) age was 9.51 months (+/-0.30) in Group 1, 11.26 months (+/- 
0.23) in Group 2, and 12.32 months (+/-0.24) in Group 3. 
Regarding the serostatus at baseline, the percentage of subjects considered seropositive for measles, 
mumps and rubella at the time of first vaccination was comparable in the 3 groups (Table 2).

Antibody response in initially seropositive subjects 
Response rates and geometric means of measles, mumps, and rubella antibody titres at 6 weeks post-
dose 1 and post-dose 2 on antigen specific FAS in initially seropositive subjects were presented in the 
CSR. As regards measles 11 subjects in group 1 were found to be seropositive prior vaccination 
(≥255mUI/ml). Following vaccination a very heterogeneous immune response against measles was 
observed within and across the different groups (see below Table 9).

All subjects in group 2 and 3, who were seropositive for measles (titre >255 mIU/ml) prior vaccination 
had also a measles antibody titre >255 mIU/ml post dose 2. Only 81.9% of infants 9 months of age 
however were determined to have seroprotective antibody titres post dose 2. 
Discussion on immunogenicity 
The CHMP considered that the composition of the clinical trial batch of ProQuad is in principle 
representative to that of the currently approved vaccine composition of M-M-RVAXPRO. As regards the 
measles component a slightly higher virus titer at release is routinely present in M-M-RVAXPRO 
batches. However, due to the stability profile and the clinical data available the same end-of shelf-life 
titres are approved for both vaccines as regards the measles, mumps and rubella component. 
Moreover, in previous clinical trials it was demonstrated that the immune responses to measles, 
mumps and rubella following vaccination with ProQuad are comparable to that following vaccination 
with M-M-RVAXPRO. 
In conclusion the immunogenicity data obtained as regards the measles, mumps and rubella 
component of the clinical trial using ProQuad are regarded to be representative for M-M-RVAXPRO. 
In view of the study design, the CHMP agreed that the non-inferiority margins were appropriately 
defined. 
The CHMP further considered that data demonstrate that vaccination of infants 9 months of age results 
in lower response rates to the measles component. This observation is most likely due to circulating 
maternal antibodies or the immaturity of the immune system of the children. These results confirm 
CHMP variation assessment report  
Page 11/15
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
that a further dose of vaccine should be given later on as a catch-up to ensure protection for the 
respective individuals against measles.  
For measles, a significant difference in the response rates and GMTs in baseline seronegative children 
is observed depending on the age at administration of the first vaccine dose. Moreover the increase in 
antibody geometric mean titres post dose 2 was highest in the youngest age category compared to 
Group 2 and 3. In group 1, an increase from 942 mIU/ml after the first dose to 1817 mIU/ml after the 
second dose was observed, which is still lower than the GMT reported after the first dose in older 
infants. The CHMP considered that this low response might be due to interfering low levels of 
circulating maternal antibodies or the immaturity of the immune system.  
In summary the post dose 1 and 2 immune responses are significantly lower in children 9 months of 
age than in infants 11 or 12 months of age. These results corroborate the necessity of further vaccine 
doses, when children are vaccinated against measles already in their first year of life.  
The CHMP noted that all subjects in group 2 and 3, who were seropositive for measles (titre >255 
mIU/ml) prior to vaccination also had a measles antibody titre >255 mIU/ml post dose 2. However, 
only 81.9% of infants who had received their first dose at 9 months of age had seroprotective antibody 
titres post dose 2. Although the number of subjects in this subgroup analysis was very low these 
results suggest interference of maternal antibodies on the immune response to measles vaccination. 
Clinical safety 
The Safety Set was defined as all subjects who received at least one dose of the study vaccine and 
who had safety follow-up data. Subjects were analysed according to their real age at Dose 1. Subjects 
with an age outside group definitions were reallocated to the group with a closer age definition.  
The schedule for the evaluation of safety parameters is given below in Table 10.

Patient exposure 
The Safety Set consisted of 1,483 subjects (91.5%). One subject randomised in Group 2 (subject 
12016) was over 12 months of age at Dose 1; this subject was analysed in Group 3 for safety analyses 
(according to real age at Dose 1). The extent of exposure is summarised in Table 11

Group 2 and 225 days (range 1; 274) in Group 3. 
Adverse events 
Post dose 1: 
In total, 81.3% of subjects in Group 1, 81.9% in Group 2 and 81.1% in Group 3 reported at least one 
injection-site adverse reaction or systemic adverse event within 28 days following Dose 1. Most of 
these subjects experienced at least one adverse event related to the study vaccine (injection-site 
adverse reaction or vaccine-related systemic adverse event): 58.7% of subjects in Group 1, 60.8% in 
Group 2 and 63.9% in Group 3.  
Regarding fever, 8.8%, 10.3% and 14.8% of subjects reported rectal temperature ≥39.4°C in Groups 
1, 2 and 3 following the first dose of ProQuad, i.e. statistically more in Group 3 (first injection at 12 
months) compared to Group 1 (first injection at 9 months) and Group 2 (first injection at 11 months). 
Post dose 2: 
In total, 72.5% of subjects in Group 1, 75.7% in Group 2 and 72.7% in Group 3 reported at least one 
injection-site adverse reaction or systemic adverse event within 28 days following Dose 2. Most of 
these subjects experienced at least one adverse event related to the study vaccine (injection-site 
adverse reaction or vaccine-related systemic adverse event): 55.0% of subjects in Group 1, 57.8% in 
Group 2 and 54.8% in Group 3.  
As regards the occurrence of fever comparable number of subjects reported rectal temperature 
≥39.4°C in the three groups following the second dose. 
In summary the incidence and intensity of injection-site adverse reactions from Day 0 to Day 28 post-
dose 1 and post dose 2 was comparable between groups. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Before the first administration of ProQuad, no serious adverse event was reported in Group 1, 
1 serious adverse event was reported by 1 subject (0.2%) in Group 2 (gastroenteritis rotavirus), and 
10 serious adverse events were reported by 7 subjects (1.5%) in Group 3 (bronchitis, gastroenteritis, 
laryngitis and concussion were reported by 1 subject each and gastroenteritis rotavirus, otitis media 
and tonsillitis were reported by 2 subjects each). 
Serious adverse events occurring between the Dose 1 and 2 of ProQuad were more frequently reported 
by subjects from Group 1 (3.4%) than those from Group 2 and Group 3 (1.7% in each group). Serious 
adverse events included cardiac disorders, infections and infestations (mainly gastroenteritis rotavirus, 
gastroenteritis and bronchitis), injury, poisoning and procedural complications, nervous system 
disorders, respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders and skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders. 
No serious adverse event occurring between Dose 1 and 2 or reported after the second dose were 
assessed by neither the investigator nor the sponsor to be related to the study vaccine. 
No death was reported during the course of the study.

Discussion on safety 
The CHMP considered that the safety profile is comparable across the different age groups following 
the first and second vaccination with ProQuad, indicating that in principle no safety concern is 
anticipated by vaccinating children from 9 months of age onwards with M-M-RVAXPRO. 
Pharmacovigilance plan and Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The elements of the proposed risk management plan (RMP) are consistent with the recommendations 
made in the ICH E2E Guideline on Pharmacovigilance and the CHMP Guideline on Risk Management 
Systems for Medicinal Products for Human Use (November 20, 2005). The CHMP considered that the 
structure of the RMP was satisfactory, and the current version follows the current template for EU RMP.  
Summary of the risk management plan  
A summary of safety concerns, Pharmacovigilance activities and Risk minimisation activities are 
presented below. 
Changes to the Product Information 
Further to the assessment and the scientific discussions held at the CHMP, the following changes to the 
Product Information were requested and subsequently implemented by the MAH. 
Summary of Product Characteristics  
Section 4.2 - Posology and method of administration 
The  initially  proposed  posology  information  was  revised  to  include  all  new  information  in  one  sub-
section  “Infants  between  9  and  12  months  of  age”  and  to  clearly  state  that  such  infants  should  be 
revaccinated  at  12  to  15  months.  An  additional  dose  with  a  measles-containing  vaccine  should  be 
considered  according  to  official  recommendations  (see  sections  4.4  and  5.1).  This  sub-section  was 
further revised to enhance readability. 
Section 5.1 - Pharmacodynamic properties 
This section was revised to include the seroprotection rates to Measles, Mumps, and Rubella 6 Weeks 
Post-Dose 1 and 6 Weeks Post-Dose 2 by age group in a table, and to reflect the safety data from the 
trial. 
The PL was updated accordingly.

Conclusions and Benefit / Risk Assessment 
The immunogenicity data from study MRV02C investigating a 2-dose regimen of ProQuad (MMRV with 
rHA) in different age groups support the extension of the age indication of M-M-RVAXPRO to children 9 
months of age under special circumstances, i.e. outbreak control. The CHMP noted further that 
vaccination of infants at 9 months of age results however in lower antibody responses especially as 
regards measles. The lower antibody responses were considered to likely be due to interfering pre-
existing maternal antibodies or the immaturity of the immune response of these children. Therefore 
additional vaccine doses are warranted later on in life for this population. As regards safety the 
incidence and intensity of adverse reactions was comparable in infants 9 months of age with infants 12 
months of age. The CHMP agreed that the Product Information was updated accordingly. 
Taken together, the data on immunogenicity and safety are supporting a positive benefit/risk balance 
in the populations reflected in the new indication as outlined below: 
M-M-RVAXPRO is indicated for simultaneous vaccination against measles, mumps, and rubella in 
individuals 12 months or older (see section 4.2). 
M-M-RVAXPRO can be administered to infants from 9 months of age under special circumstances (see 
sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
For use in measles outbreaks, or for post-exposure vaccination, or, for use in previously unvaccinated 
individuals older than 9 months who are in contact with susceptible pregnant women, and persons 
likely to be susceptible to mumps and rubella, see section 5.1.” 
4  Conclusion 
On 22 July 2010 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics, Annex II and Package 
Leaflet.

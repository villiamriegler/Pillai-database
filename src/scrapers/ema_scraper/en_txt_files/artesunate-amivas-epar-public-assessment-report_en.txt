2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
Artesunate Amivas is a semi-synthetic artemisinin derivative intended for the initial intravenous 
treatment of severe malaria in adults and paediatric patients. When the patient is able to take oral 
medications, a complete course of an appropriate oral antimalarial regimen should follow.  
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Malaria is a potentially fatal illness caused by protozoal infection of red blood cells (RBC) with parasites 
belonging to the genus Plasmodium, transmitted to humans by the bite of a Plasmodium-infected 
female anopheline mosquito usually between dusk and dawn.  
2.1.2.  Epidemiology 
Malaria transmission occurs in five WHO regions. Globally, an estimated 3.4 billion people in 92 
countries are at risk of being infected with malaria and developing disease and 1.1 billion are at high 
risk (>1 in 1000 chance of getting malaria in a year). According to the World Malaria Report 2018, 
there were 219 million cases of malaria globally in 2017 (uncertainty range 203–262 million) and 
435,000 malaria deaths, representing a decrease in malaria cases and deaths rates of 18% and 28% 
since 2010, respectively. The burden was heaviest in Africa, where an estimated 93% of all malaria 
deaths occurred, and in children aged under 5 years, who accounted for 61% of all global deaths. In 
the EU and in the US, malaria occurs in returning travelers or very recent immigrants from malaria 
endemic areas. Severe malaria occurred in 293, 259 and 306 US residents in 2014, 2015 and 2016, 
respectively. In Europe in 2018, the total number of all malaria cases (uncomplicated and severe 
combined) was 8,349 (ECDC-2020a). However, as in the US, the proportion of severe cases in Europe 
was very low, typically 10% of the total.  
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 8/110 
 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Five species of Plasmodium infect humans: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), P vivax (Pv), P ovale (Po), P 
malariae (Pm) and P knowlesi (Pk). Most severe malaria is due to Pf, although severe malaria due to 
Pv, Po and Pk has been recognised. In Europe in 2018, among 4,516 confirmed cases for which the 
Plasmodium species was reported, 3,793 (84.0%) had Pf, 339 (7.5%) had Pv, 236 (5.2%) had Po, 135 
(3.0%) had Pm and 3 (0.1%) had Pk. In addition, one case had P. cynomolgi (a Plasmodium species 
that typically infects monkeys) and 9 (0.2%) were mixed infections with various Plasmodium species. 
The severity of Pf reflects sequestration of infected erythrocytes within the microvasculature of various 
organs, including the brain. Several mechanisms have been proposed for cerebral malaria including 
mechanical microvascular obstruction by sequestered infected erythrocytes, activation of immune cells 
and release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, endothelial dysfunction, dysregulation of coagulation 
pathways, blood–brain barrier permeability disruption and brain swelling. 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis 
The signs and symptoms of malaria illness commonly include fever, headache, back pain, chills, 
increased sweating, myalgia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and cough. Untreated infections in malaria-
naïve patients due to Pf can rapidly progress to coma, renal failure, respiratory distress and death.  
The WHO defines severe falciparum malaria according to one or more clinical features occurring in the 
presence of Pf asexual parasitaemia: 
Impaired consciousness: Glasgow coma score <11 in adults or Blantyre coma score <3 in children. 
Multiple convulsions: More than 2 episodes in 24 hours. 
Prostration: Generalised weakness - unable to sit, stand or walk without assistance. 
Significant bleeding: Including recurrent or prolonged bleeding from the nose, gums or venipuncture 
sites, hematemesis or melena. 
Shock: Compensated shock (defined as capillary refill ≥3 seconds or temperature gradient on leg but 
no hypotension or decompensated shock (defined as systolic blood pressure <80 mmHg in adults or 
< 70 mmHg in children, with evidence of impaired perfusion). 
Pulmonary edema: Pulmonary edema radiologically confirmed or oxygen saturation <92% on room air 
with respiratory rate >30/min, often with chest in drawing and crepitations on auscultation. 
These clinical features are accompanied by one or more laboratory findings that may include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hypoglycemia: Blood or plasma glucose <2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL). 
Acidosis: A base deficit of >8 mEq/L or plasma bicarbonate <15 mmol/L or venous plasma lactate 
≥5 mmol/L. Severe acidosis manifests as respiratory distress (rapid, deep, labored breathing). 
Severe malarial anemia: Hemoglobin ≤5 g/dL or hematocrit ≤15% in children <12 years (≤7 g/dL 
and <20%, respectively, in adults) with parasitemia > 10,000/μL. 
Hyperparasitemia: Pf parasitemia >5%. 
Renal impairment: Blood creatinine >265µmol/L (3 mg/dL) or BUN >20 mmol/L. 
Jaundice: Bilirubin >50 µmol/L (3 mg/dL) with >100,000 parasites/μL. 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 9/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Severe vivax malaria is defined as for Pf malaria but with no parasite density thresholds. Severe 
knowlesi malaria is defined as for Pf malaria, but with 2 density thresholds: either hyperparasitemia 
>100,000/μL or ~2% or jaundice with parasite density >20,000/μL. 
Complicated malaria is defined as malaria complicated by conditions precluding oral treatment thus 
making parenteral therapy preferable. Complicated malaria does not equate with severe malaria since 
the term encompasses malaria infections not meeting the WHO (2015) criteria for severe malaria but 
in which the patient may benefit from parenteral treatment. 
The proportion of suspected malaria cases receiving a malaria diagnostic test has increased markedly 
since 2010, especially in Africa, mainly due to an increase in the use of rapid diagnostic tests. Thus, 
rather than relying on microscopy of thin and thick films, which requires trained personnel and 
appropriate laboratory equipment, cases may be diagnosed using finger prick samples using tests that 
pick-up antigens of plasmodial species. Some of these tests can be used in remote areas and lead to 
rapid institution of treatment. The sensitivity and specificity of commercially available tests is variable 
but has been improving in recent years and WHO has issued guidance of criteria for test selection 
2.1.5.  Management 
Quinine was the mainstay of treatment of severe malaria since the introduction of Cinchona Bark to 
European medicine in the 1630s until the rediscovery of artemisinin in China in 1972 and the 
subsequent synthesis of artemether and artesunate, which provided highly effective alternatives to 
quinine. Artemisinin derivatives are now widely recognised to be the most rapidly acting of all the 
antimalarial drugs. Prior to 2005, the largest clinical trials performed in severe malaria had compared 
artemether to quinine but overall survival was not significantly different. A pilot comparison of 
intravenous (IV) artesunate (AS) and IV quinine then showed that mortality was 22% in the quinine 
group and 12% in the AS group.  
The South East Asian Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial (SEAQUAMAT) Consortium compared IV AS to IV 
quinine for severe malaria in 1461 (mostly adult) Asian patients and found that AS was statistically 
superior to quinine in preventing death. This was followed by a study of similar design in 5,425 African 
children in 2010 (African Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial [AQUAMAT]), which also showed that AS was 
superior to quinine in preventing mortality.  
These trials led to the adoption of IV AS for primary therapy for this disease worldwide. Based on high-
quality evidence, the WHO issued a strong recommendation for the use of IV or IM AS in patients with 
severe malaria for at least 24 h and until oral medication is possible. The recommended oral follow-on 
treatment consists of 3 days of an artemisinin-based combination therapy. 
In Europe, there are no medicinal products specifically authorised for the initial treatment of severe 
malaria. There is one antimalarial available for IV administration, but it is licensed only in France as 
SURQUINA (IV quinine). While many EU centres have moved to use of IV artesunate for initial 
treatment of severe malaria, the available products are either the WHO-prequalified (2011) Guilin 
formulation or artesunate formulations manufactured or approved in other jurisdictions. 
2.2.  About the product 
Artemisinin itself is a sesquiterpene lactone produced by the Chinese medicinal herb Artemisia annua. 
The artemisinins in the broader sense are endoperoxides derived from artemisinin for which activation 
of the endoperoxide bridge is essential for antimalarial activity. The endoperoxide bridge is activated 
by haem iron inside Plasmodium-parasitised erythrocytes. This leads to oxidative stress, inhibition of 
protein and nucleic acid synthesis, ultrastructural changes and a decrease in parasite growth and 
Assessment report

survival. Artemisinins act very rapidly against intra-erythrocytic asexual blood-stage malaria parasites, 
affecting up to 10,000-fold reductions in parasite burden every 48 h. Parasitemia is usually cleared 
within 48 to 72 h.  
Semisynthetic lactol derivatives such as dihydroartemisinin (DHA) have higher bioavailability and 
activity compared to artemisinin. After oral or parenteral administration of agents in the artemisinin 
group, including IV artesunate, DHA forms in vivo. Artesunate and DHA are active against the blood-
stage asexual parasites and gametocytes of Plasmodium species, including chloroquine-resistant 
strains, but they are not active against the hypnozoite liver stage forms of P. vivax and P. ovale.   
2.3.  Aspects on development 
Since it is not practical to conduct a randomised study of IV AS vs IV quinine in the US or EU in 
returning travelers, the applicant’s intravenous artesunate preparation was used under a CDC protocol 
to treat returning US travelers. This retrospective uncontrolled study supplements the pivotal 
comparative trials conducted using Guilin artesunate (SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT).

Figure 1: active substance structure 
The  chemical  structure  of  active  substance  was  elucidated  by    a  combination  of  methods.  The 
physicochemical properties were also determined by a combination of methods.   
The active substance is a non-hygroscopic fine, white to almost white, crystalline powder, very slightly 
soluble in water, very soluble in dichloromethane, freely soluble in ethanol and acetone. 
Artesunate contains eight chiral centres, of which seven are derived from the starting material 
artemisinin. A new chiral centre is formed at C-10 with the possible formation of two epimers: 10α and 
10β. However, the substance formed is a single isomer and it is stated only the 10α-epimer is present. 
Up to now, only one polymorphic form is known (Form A).  
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance has been provided in the 
restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Artesunate is a sesquiterpene endoperoxide produced from the starting material artemisinin and 
succinic acid anhydride. The first starting material of artesunate is artemisinin. The information 
provided for this application refers exclusively to the active substance produced from artemisinin 
obtained from the semi-synthetic process. The starting materials were controlled by acceptable 
specification. The chemical synthesis of artesunate involves several stages of synthesis using 
artemisinin as a well-defined starting material with acceptable specifications. The desired 
stereochemistry is ensured by the process conditions under substrate control 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods 
for intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline 
on chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were discussed with regards to their origin and characterisation. 
From an ICH M7(R1) perspective, artesunate does not contain any structural alert features and, was 
negative in all GLP genotoxicity studies. It is also well established in the literature that DHA is the main 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 12/110 
 
 
 
 
  
active metabolite of both artesunate and artemisinin and it does not exhibit genotoxic activity in the 
AMES test. Based on this and the structural similarities between artesunate and the impurities, they 
are all considered as ICH M7(R1) Class 4-5 non-mutagenic impurities. 
The solvents used in the semi-synthetic artesunate synthesis are all ICH Q3C(R6) Class 2 or 3 solvents 
and are controlled in artesunate batches at or below the corresponding ICH Q3C(R6) limits. 
After the synthesis, micronisation of the active substance under nitrogen is performed at a 
manufacturing site. The unmilled material is fed into a jet mill and the milled material is transferred 
into the container closure system. The only raw material used in the micronisation of the active 
substance was presented with an adequate specification.  
A full (2 x 2) factorial study using the current jet mill at a specific feed rate and mill pressure was 
performed. The results all exhibited nearly identical particle size distributions, and on this basis, the 
operational feed rate and mill pressure ranges with only one of these parameters changed at a time. 
However, because material is continuously fed into, and discharged from the mill, during a production 
run, the system dynamics change with time, and therefore multiple adjustments within a production 
run are required. Out of necessity, one or both of these parameters may be adjusted more than once 
during a commercial run. This is justified since the micronized material is continuously discharged and 
collected from the microniser, and therefore any single adjustment of either of these parameters will 
be independent of any already processed material, i.e., there is no space-dependence associated with 
a single parameter adjustment. CPPs are mill pressure and feed rate. 
The design space has been verified at commercial scale. 
Sterilisation of the active substance is performed by ethylene oxide (EO). Because EO sterilisation is 
the least reliable method of sterilisation, there were significant concerns with this approach. A MO was 
raised, requiring a comprehensive justification for use of the EO as mode of sterilisation, as per 
EMA/CHMP/CVMP/QWP/850374/2015 decision tree. The applicant confirmed that standard Ph. Eur 
steam sterilisation, gamma irradiation and UV irradiation all induced significant decomposition in the 
active substance. Sterilisation of an artesunate solution using sterilising filter was also not successful. 
The provided discussion and updated justification of the selected sterilisation method was considered 
acceptable; thus, EO sterilization was confirmed as the proposed manufacturing process of sterile 
artesunate. Particle size is a critical parameter to prevent entrapment of microbes in crystals and 
acceptable justification of the particle size has been provided. The controls in place to ensure the 
sterility of the active substance have been provided and considered satisfactory.  
During the evaluation, the CHMP considered that a more detailed process narrative and schematic of 
the manufacturing process of the active substance should have been provided, divided into the 
following phases – packaging, (pre)conditioning, sterilisation, aeration and routine controls. This was 
requested as Major Objection (MO). In response to the MO, adequate information was provided and 
considered satisfactory. 
For manufacturing process development, sufficient discussion has been provided and the approach 
taken has been acceptably justified. 
The active substance is packaged to comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as 
amended. 
Specification 
The final active substance (artesunate after micronisation and sterilization) specifications shown in 
include tests for appearance (visual), identification, (IR, HPLC), pH of solution (Ph. Eur.), related

substances (HPLC), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), sulphated ash (Ph. Eur.), water content 
(KF), residual ethylene oxide (GC), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), sterility (Ph. Eur.), and container 
closure integrity (microscopic evaluation).  
Testing for impurities structurally related to artesunate is performed as a release and stability. 
The individual related substances levels after micronisation/sterilization are very low and are due to 
carryover from the active substance synthesis. Accordingly, the acceptance criteria for the individual 
specified and unspecified related substances have been set at the current CH Q3A qualification and 
identification thresholds, respectively and the acceptance criterion for total related substances has 
been set to NMT 0.5%. Testing for the exclusively synthesis process impurity is performed on 
artesunate prior to micronisation. 
The particle size is currently controlled exclusively at the micronized stage  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods 
appropriately validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the 
reference standards used for identification, assay and related substances tests has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on 9 commercial scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
are within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data from a number of commercial scale batches of artesunate after synthesis and before 
micronisation/sterilization from the proposed manufacturer stored in the intended commercial package 
covering up to 60 months’ storage at 25°C/60% RH and/or 30°C/65% RH and 6 months’ storage at 
40°C/75% RH according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of the final (micronized and sterilized) active 
substance, generated in accordance with ICH Q1A(R2) guidelines, are provided after storage at 
25°C/60% RH for up to 24 months. 
Since micronized artesunate is only held for a short period prior to sterilization, stability data for 
micronized artesunate alone has not been generated. 
The following parameters were tested: appearance, pH of solution, assay, related substances, water 
content, and sterility. The analytical methods used were the same as for release and are stability 
indicating. 
All stability data remained within specifications and generally unchanged within normal analytical 
variability.  
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Q1B. The results demonstrate that 
the active substance is not sensitive to light. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months when stored at 
or below 25 °C in the proposed container.

2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product consists of a sterile active substance powder and a sterile solution for 
reconstitution. 
Artesunate Powder 
It is supplied as a sterile powder for reconstitution and injection, consisting exclusively of the active 
substance (sterile micronized artesunate) as a white or almost white, fine crystalline powder, 
practically free from particles of foreign matter, aseptically filled into a clear 20 mL Type 1 glass vial 
with a nominal fill of 110 mg/vial, capped with a 20 mm, blowback, grey bromobutyl rubber stopper 
and crimped with an aluminium seal containing a royal blue, flip off 20 mm cap. It does not contain 
excipients.  
In accordance with ICH Q8(R2) guidelines, a prospective Quality Target Product Profile (QTPP) is 
provided in  
, along with the quality attributes deemed important to ensure the QTPP is met.  
Since initial development, the finished product has been prepared by aseptic filling of artesunate into 
vials. This is due to the necessary intravenous route of administration and the well-known degradation 
of artesunate to slowly form dihydroartemisinin (DHA) in aqueous solution, requiring administration 
shortly after reconstitution. While the formation of DHA occurs in vivo and is not considered a toxicity 
issue, it has limited aqueous solubility and so will eventually form a turbid solution, possibly with 
visible particulates, which render the solution unsuitable for intravenous administration. 
The active substance is not hygroscopic and the solid-state characteristics (polymorphic form, particle 
size distribution after micronisation) are consistent between batches and are not a consideration once 
the product is brought into solution prior to administration. The active substance solubility in aqueous 
media is pH dependent and there have been no solubilization issues, with reconstitution generally 
complete within 1-3 minutes, and the pH of the selected diluent (0.3 M phosphate buffer solution) 
tightly controlled at 7.9-8.1. 
The bulk/tapped density of the active substance is very low and as a consequence, the flowability is 
poor. The dosing heads for filling of the active substance into vials have been evaluated to optimize the 
filling rate. 
There have been two synthesis pathways for the artesunate precursor artemisinin; the vegetal (non-
commercial) and semi-synthetic (proposed commercial) route. Although artesunate production by the 
vegetal route was discontinued in 2018, additional vegetal finished product batches for non-
commercial use have been prepared in 2019 using existing vegetal artesunate active substance 
inventory. Comparative batch data were provided, demonstrating that artesunate produced by the 
vegetal and semi-synthetic routes is essentially indistinguishable from a quality perspective. 
Since there is only one ingredient in the finished product, there has been no formulation development. 
Manufacture of the finished product involves filling of the sterile active substance into the vials which is 
performed under aseptic conditions. The only process development has been a transition from manual 
filling to semi-automated filling with 100% fill weight checks for all vegetal and semi-synthetic finished 
product batches filled at the manufacturing site. 
Sufficient information regarding the development of the product has been provided. An extractable and 
leachables study did not identify any safety issues. The integrity of the drug product container closure

system has been demonstrated, and microbial considerations are adequately discussed. Compatibility 
with the diluent has been demonstrated 
The most relevant physicochemical properties of the finished product involve the reconstitution 
characteristics, specifically the permissible storage time after reconstitution with the phosphate buffer 
solution. The reconstitution time has been relatively consistent at release and on stability, with values 
typically between 1-3 minutes and a proposed limit of NMT 6 minutes. Particle size distribution in the 
finished product is not considered an issue since the particle size is controlled in the micronized active 
substance and has been shown not to change significantly upon finished product manufacture and 
storage. Furthermore, reconstitution time is not affected even if the artesunate is not micronized. 
There is no significant increase in subvisible particulates upon storage of the finished product 
reconstituted in the requisite amount of phosphate buffer solution for up to at least 1.5 hours at 25°C. 
Accordingly, a permissible waiting time of NMT 1.5 hours after reconstitution in phosphate buffer 
solution is stated in the labelling. 
The primary packaging is Type I glass vial capped with a latex-free bromobutyl rubber stopper and 
aluminium seal. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product.  
Diluent 
The diluent for reconstitution of the Artesunate Powder is provided in a vial containing 12 mL sterile 
0.3 M sodium phosphate, pH 8.0 ± 0.1 buffer solution as a clear, colorless solution, practically free 
from particles of foreign matter.  
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients 
is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
Phosphate buffer solutions covering a wide range of pH values and ionic strengths have been 
extensively studied and are commercially available for numerous medicinal product and biologics 
applications. Accordingly, very little development was required once the pH and ionic strength 
ranges were confirmed. 
The most relevant physicochemical property of the phosphate buffer solution is the ability to fully 
solubilize the finished product upon reconstitution, which is controlled by the appearance (after 
reconstitution) and the reconstitution time in the finished product specifications The reconstitution time 
has been relatively consistent at release and on stability, with values typically between 1-3 minutes 
and a proposed limit of NMT 6 minutes. The appearance/turbidity measured during development 
consistently results in complete solubilization of artesunate. For the amount of the administered dose, 
there are no biological properties of the phosphate buffer solution that are relevant. 
Very little manufacturing process development was required as there are numerous preparations in the 
literature for phosphate buffer solutions of varying pH values and ionic strengths. 
The  primary  packaging  is  Type  I  glass  vial  capped  with  a  latex-free  bromobutyl  rubber  stopper  and 
aluminium seal. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container 
closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
An extractable and leachables study did not identify any safety issues. The integrity of the finished 
product container closure system has been demonstrated, and microbial considerations are adequately 
discussed. Compatibility with the diluent has been demonstrated.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Artesunate Powder 
The powder is manufactured by one manufacturing site  
The manufacturing process consists of 3 main steps: aseptic filling of the micronized, sterilized 
artesunate active substance into the 20 mL vials followed by capping and sealing. All staging and filling 
operations are performed in a Class 100 (ISO 5) room, with filling performed in restricted access 
barrier technology. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process. 
During the assessment, the CHMP requested as a MO that the process needed to be validated before 
opinion. It was confirmed that finished product process validation for both artesunate finished product 
and sodium phosphate buffer solution have been completed successfully on 3 consecutive production 
scale batches, and the validation reports were provided and considered satisfactory. It has been 
demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended 
quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process.  
Diluent 
The diluent is manufactured by one manufacturing site. 
The manufacturing process consists of 8 main steps: addition of sterilised water for injections, addition 
and stirring of monobasic sodium phosphate monohydrate, addition and stirring of disodium phosphate 
dihydrate, cooing, adjusting of pH, sterilizing, filling into vials, and terminal sterilization. All steps are 
performed under aseptically controlled conditions. All areas are supplied with HEPA filtered air at the 
required air change volumes and pressurizations. The process is considered to be a non-standard 
manufacturing process. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated by a number of studies on three 
consecutive full-scale batches. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of 
producing the diluent of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process.  
Product specification  
Artesunate Powder 
The powder release and shelf-life specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
appearance before reconstitution (visual), appearance after reconstitution (Ph. Eur.), identification (IR, 
HPLC), extractable volume after reconstitution (Ph. Eur.), pH of solution  after reconstitution (Ph. 
Eur.), water content (KF), reconstitution time (visual), related substances (HPLC), assay vial content 
(gravimetry), assay (HPLC), mass variation (Ph. Eur.), subvisible particle after reconstitution  (Ph. 
Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), and sterility (Ph. Eur.).  
The particle size is not routinely controlled in the finished product as it is controlled in the intermediate 
micronized active substance. Osmolality is not routinely controlled since it is a predictable colligative 
property of the formulation composition and has been confirmed as being isoosmotic from osmolality 
measurements of drug product reconstituted with phosphate buffer solution. 
The CHMP requested (as a MO) that the applicant discuss the potential safety impact of the impurities 
present in the active substance that may be carried over to the finished product. Discussion on the 
potential safety impact of all possible impurities of artesunate was provided and no safety concerns 
were identified. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that no other impurities except those already 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 17/110 
 
 
 
 
included in the active substance specification are carried over to the final active substance. Therefore, 
it can be concluded that no new impurities have been found that would raise any safety concerns. 
The individual acceptance criterion for each specified and unspecified impurity is set corresponding to 
the ICH Q3B(R2) qualification threshold. 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a 
risk-based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Batch analysis data 
on 3 batches using a validated ICP-MS method was provided, demonstrating that each relevant 
elemental impurity was not detected above 30% of the respective PDE. Based on the risk assessment 
and the presented batch data it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls.  
A risk evaluation concerning the presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested as MO) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the 
“Questions and answers for marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the 
Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal 
products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the “Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation 
EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based 
on the information provided it is accepted that no risk was identified in the active substance or the 
finished product. Therefore, no additional control measures are deemed necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. The same reference standards described for the active substance 
are currently being used for drug product identification/assay/related substances testing. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 3 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification.  
The powder is released onto the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
finished product release testing 
Diluent 
The diluent release and shelf life specifications include appropriate tests: appearance (visual), 
identification (Ph. Eur.), extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), pH (Ph. Eur.), assay for phosphate 
(potentiometric titration), subvisible particulates (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.), and 
sterility (Ph. Eur.).   
The phosphate buffer solution used for the finished product reconstitution is a common, well 
characterized diluent used at various concentrations and pH values for reconstitution of many finished 
products and is composed entirely of compendial substances, and as such has not been characterized 
further for impurities. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines. No reference standards are used for phosphate buffer solution 
analysis. 
Batch analysis results are provided for 4 commercial scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended diluent specification.  
The diluent is released onto the market based on the above release specifications, through traditional 
final product release testing.

Stability of the product 
Artesunate Powder 
Stability data from 3 commercial batches of powder stored for up to 24 months under long term 
conditions (5°C) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) according to 
the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of the powder are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Additional stability data from 3 commercial batches of powder stored for up to 12 months under long 
term conditions (25°C/60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of powder are identical to those proposed 
for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing samples were tested 
for appearance (before and after reconstitution in phosphate buffer solution), pH of solution, water 
content, reconstitution time, assay, related substances, subvisible particulates, bacterial endotoxins 
and sterility. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
All measured parameters remained well within specifications and unchanged within normal analytical 
variability. Based on these data, a shelf life of 24 months at the long term storage condition is 
proposed when the finished product is stored in the proposed commercial container. 
To evaluate permissible storage time after reconstitution with the diluent, two studies have been 
performed: a short term study in which the finished product was stored for up to 28 days with 
reconstitution, and an in-use study in which the finished product was reconstituted with phosphate 
buffer solution and analysed at intervals up to 2 hours after reconstitution. Taking into account the 
results of these studies an in-use shelf-life of the reconstitution solution time determined as stated in 
the SmPC (section 6.3). 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) 
are acceptable. 
Diluent 
Stability data from 3 commercial scale batches of diluent stored under long term conditions (25°C / 
60% RH) and under accelerated conditions (40°C / 75% RH) for up to 24 months according to the ICH 
guidelines were provided. The batches of the medicinal product are identical to those proposed for 
marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for appearance, phosphate content, pH, subvisible particulates, bacterial 
endotoxins and sterility. To date, all stability data remained well within specifications and unchanged 
within normal analytical variability. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of 
New Drug Substances and Products. The results show that the phosphate buffer solution does not 
absorb light to any significant extent throughout the measured range compared to the water reference, 
demonstrating photostability since there is no mechanism for light absorption.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life for the phosphate buffer solution when stored 
at or below 30°C is acceptable.  
However, since the powder and diluent are co-packaged, the shelf life of the finished product as a 
whole is that of the powder stated above.

2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
During the assessment, a more detailed process narrative and schematic of the manufacturing of the 
active substance, a comprehensive justification for use of ethylene oxide as the sterilisant of the active 
substance, confirmation of the  process validation has been completed successfully for the finished 
product, and a validation report, a discussion of  the potential safety impact of the impurities present 
in the active substance that may be carried over to the final product and an expansion of  the 
nitrosamine risk assessment were requested as major objections. The applicant provided satisfactory 
responses and all these issues which were considered solved. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the micronisation process, and a design 
space has been proposed for micronisation of the active substance.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way.  
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable.  
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
GLP 
Safety pharmacology study 1466-103 was performed in compliance with GLP. Studies SR01-1 and 
AQ0008_02_AF were not performed in compliance with GLP, but they were of sufficient quality. 
Considering the clinical experience with artesunate, this is not considered a problem.  
Pivotal toxicology studies were in general, performed in compliance with GLP. However, two 
genotoxicity studies were performed in a laboratory without mutagenicity expertise (area 3). These 
two laboratories were inspected around the time of completion for the conduct of toxicology studies 
(area 2). The studies related to the GLP concern are the bacterial mutagenicity assay and in vitro 
chromosomal aberration assay with artesunate (studies G305-08 and G306-08 both performed at SRI 
International, Menlo Park, CA, USA), which both were assessed as negative. Based on the Guidance on 
Triggers for audits of GLP studies (EMA/89741/2015), the CHMP concluded that a GLP inspection was 
warranted, as regarding question 3 of the GLP checklist, the concerning laboratory was not known as 
an area 3 expertise testing facility. A study audit was performed by the US-FDA upon request of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 20/110 
 
 
 
 
EMA. US-FDA concluded that the final reports completely and accurately reflect the raw data and that 
there were no findings associated with these studies. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies for artesunate addressed the in vitro and in vivo efficacy in P. 
falciparum-infected human RBCs, P. berghei- infected rats and P. coatneyi- infected rhesus monkeys. 
No dedicated studies on the mechanism of action of artesunate were presented by the applicant. A 
literature review supports the well accepted concept that the anti-malarial activity of artesunate is 
conferred by the endoperoxide bridge that undergoes iron-mediated cleavage to generate an unstable 
organic free radical and subsequent alkylation to enable binding to malarial proteins.  
The in-vitro efficacy studies indicated that IC50 values for artesunate are low, the potency of DHA is 
similar to that of artesunate and non-GMP Guilin and WRAIR formulations performed similarly and 
within historical controls for artesunate. The in-vivo efficacy in the P. berghei- infected rat showed that 
artesunate was well-tolerated and efficacious; the CD100 dose (inducing 100% clearance of 
parasitaemia, 60 mg/kg) provided a 4-fold safety margin to the MTD (240 mg/kg). Although a severe 
malaria model with P. coatneyi- infected rhesus monkeys was investigated, the definitive study in an 
uncomplicated malaria model provides a more robust indication of efficacy for humans. 90% parasite 
clearance was achieved in the initial 26-hour period however complete clearance was delayed and 
recrudescence occurred within 2-15 days. The applicant compared exposure to the proposed clinical 
posology and the 8 mg/kg dose employed in this monkey study is equivalent to 1.5 mg/kg in human 
and is thus lower than the clinical dose.   
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies have been performed with artesunate. Safety pharmacology 
studies were conducted to assess cardiovascular (CV), respiratory and central nervous system (CNS) 
toxicity. No hERG studies have been conducted by the applicant as the applicant considers there are no 
clinical concerns at the proposed dose. In the study with telemetered beagle dogs no changes in CV 
parameters were noted, providing a dose-based safety margin of 11-fold to the clinical dose and a 4-
fold exposure-based margin relative to exposure at 2 mg/kg from the healthy volunteer study (Miller 
2012). The applicant’s position is also leveraged on the absence of a CV signal in healthy volunteers 
and infected patients in clinical trials. This is supported. No respiratory effects were noted in the 
telemetered beagle dog. CNS toxicity has been previously identified as a potential concern for 
artemisinin derivatives and was the subject of a WHO review in the early 2000s. The applicant has 
referred to literature that was included in the WHO review on potential for neurotoxicity. The review 
concluded that a number of factors may influence neurotoxic effects including long duration of activity, 
lipid solubility, parenteral administration and duration of treatments. Artesunate was not implicated in 
this review. The applicant also undertook an assessment of neurotoxicity as part of a toxicology study 
in rhesus monkeys, including an evaluation of brain pathology with a number of artemisinin derivatives 
including artesunate. Neurological signs including spontaneous motor activity, prostration and ataxia 
(128 mg/kg only) were noted in artesunate-treated animals at doses of 32 mg/kg and higher, however 
no pathological correlate was identified at any of the dose levels. The risk of neurological sequelae with 
the proposed posology for Artesunate Amivas is considered to be therefore considered to be low. The 
potential effect of artesunate on the gut (muscle contractility or transit time) was investigated and 
although no adverse effects were noted there was some evidence that artesunate may lower gastric pH 
in a dose-dependent fashion. No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were conducted with 
artesunate as part of this application.

2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in rats, dogs and cynomolgus monkeys, following single or 
repeated IV administration with a number of artesunate formulations.  
The bioanalytical methods used for the GLP studies in rats and dogs have been suitably validated in-
line with the Guideline on Bioanalytical Method Validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev. 1 Corr. 
2) and are considered fit for purpose. Artesunate appears to be rapidly converted to DHA in nonclinical 
species. In the rat mass balance study, concentration of artesunate in plasma and whole blood peaked 
at 5 minutes after IV administration. A second peak occurring 3-4 hours after administration indicates 
enterohepatic recirculation occurs in rats. The DHA/artesunate ratio in the rat was approximately 1 at a 
dose of 5 mg/kg. The AUC ratio of DHA/artesunate was dose-dependent and reduced to 0.3-0.4 at the 
highest dose (50 mg/kg, single IV dose), notably lower than observed in humans (3.3-9.7). The 
elimination half-life was similar for both artesunate and DHA (0.32-0.52 hours). In repeat dose 
studies, peak concentrations of artesunate and DHA were achieved rapidly (less than 5 minutes) and 
artesunate was below the limit of quantification by 2 hours. DHA was measurable up to 3 hours at 
higher doses but generally speaking quantification of artesunate at lower doses (e.g. 3 or 10 mg/kg in 
rat; up to 40 mg/kg in dog) was not possible. No sex differences in absorption kinetics were apparent. 
No accumulation of artesunate was noted. 
Tissue distribution in rats demonstrated 68% of C14-artesunate activity in the small intestine, rapidly 
decreasing in all tissues except for the spleen (with LSC method). High exposure was also observed in 
the kidney. In the 192-hour sampling period, brain concentrations of artesunate accounted for 1.07% 
of total radioactivity and were higher than plasma levels (70.7 vs. 29.4 µg equivalents.h/ml). Similar 
observations were produced using the QWBA method. Highest tissue concentrations were observed 0.5 
hr after dosing, in the small intestine, spleen and bone marrow.  CNS concentrations were low but 
persisted until the end of the study, similar to other tissues. A study in pregnant rats found measurable 
concentrations of (7.3% of AUC) in the ovary, placenta and uterus at 2-4-fold higher concentrations 
than plasma. Distribution in red blood cells (RBCs) was 4.3 times higher than plasma concentrations in 
vivo.  
In metabolite profiling studies in rats, the majority of metabolites were from the total conjugation 
fractions (glucuronide and other conjugations): 87.7% and 89.6% of the administered dose in plasma 
and urine, respectively. Conjugation was the major metabolic pathway of artesunate in rat plasma, and 
the conjugation rate was time dependent. DHA was a major metabolite of artesunate and was 
metabolized almost immediately in the free fraction of plasma at 1 minute after dosing. Artesunate 
was rapid and extensively metabolized to more and less polar metabolites and unchanged artesunate 
was almost undetectable at 2 hours. Incubation of DHA in hepatocytes (including human) did not 
identify any unique human metabolites. It was noted after IV administration in rats that DHA was 
present as two tautomers – DHAα and DHAβ. No difference in activity is expected between these two 
tautomers. DHA undergoes rapid Phase 2 glucuronidation.  
In-vitro metabolism studies identified CYP2A6, CYP2B6, CYP2E1, CYP1B1, and CYP4A11 as 
metabolizing enzymes of artesunate, CYP2A6 being the major isoform involved in artesunate 
metabolism. Glucuronidation is the major metabolic pathway for DHA, predominantly via UGT1A9. 
Enzyme induction/inhibition studies co-incubated artesunic acid with substrates of CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 and no inference was noted. DHA moderately inhibited substrates for 
CYP1A2 (IC50 value of 10 μM) and CYP2C19 (IC50 value of 9 μM). However, this is not of great 
relevance considering that in clinical studies, no relevant CYP inhibition was found. An in-vivo 
interaction study in rhesus monkeys showed that small but significant changes were observed in the 
profile of markers for CYP3A4, CYP2D6 and CYP2C9 after IV artesunate administration. Uptake and 
efflux transporter studies were conducted. Artesunate and DHA did not demonstrate any potential to

inhibit or act as substrates at OATP1B1, OATP1B3, OAT1, OAT3, OCT1, OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K, P-
gp, BCRP and BSEP at physiologically relevant concentrations. 
In rats, artesunate was excreted in urine and faeces (56% and 38%, respectively), indicating the 
kidneys is the primary excretory organ. No nonclinical studies have evaluated the excretion of 
artesunate in milk. 
Inhibition of CYP enzymes by artesunate was investigated only in a limited way, with few enzymes, 
other substrates used than recommended in the Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions 
(CPMP/EWP/560/95/Rev. 1 Corr. 2) and lack of details in the study report (Melendez report). However, 
this is not considered of great importance since clinically no relevant CYP inhibition was observed. DHA 
was a poor inhibitor of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, and CYP3A at 10 μM. DHA was a 
potent inhibitor in vitro of CYP1A2 and a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19, both at 10 µM. The 
concentration used (10 µM) was much lower than 50-fold the mean unbound Cmax (here unbound 
Cmax of DHA was 0.70 μM) as recommended in the Guideline, for enzyme inhibition studies, however 
the clinical relevance of this is again, limited. As glucuronidation is the major elimination pathway of 
DHA UGT enzyme inhibition should be investigated as outlined in relevant guidance. Specifically, in 
vitro inhibition of UGT2B7 and UGT1A9 should be investigated, at concentrations as recommended in 
the Guideline on the Investigation of Drug Interactions. An in vitro study of the potential inhibition of 
UGT2B7 and UGT1A9 by DHA is ongoing and is scheduled for completion Sept 2021 and will be 
submitted post-approval (see post-authorisation measures). 
2.5.4.  Toxicology 
The toxicology package for artesunate Amivas includes single and repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats, 
dogs and monkeys. Two pivotal, 28-day, GLP-compliant repeat-dose toxicity studies have been 
conducted with the SS API. All other studies were conducted with either Guilin or WRAIR formulations. 
IV administration was employed for single and repeat dose studies; oral administration was 
predominantly used in reproductive and developmental toxicity studies.  
The most common observation in nonclinical species was haematological toxicity characterised by 
dose-dependent anaemia, reticulocytopenia and in some studies leukopenia and neutropenia were also 
observed. In the pivotal 28-day GLP study in rats, this was associated with mortality at doses of 10 
mg/kg IV or higher, splenomegaly and erythroid hyperplasia which persisted in animal at highest dose. 
In the mid (females only) and high dose groups heart weight was increased, although this did not 
persist in the recovery phase and blood pressure was not measured in this study. In beagle dogs, 
haematological findings were minimal and resolved in the recovery phase of the study. The NOAELs in 
these pivotal studies were 3 mg/kg/day and 5 mg/kg/day, respectively. A 7-day non-GLP study in 
rhesus monkeys identified haematologic effects at 8mg/kg/day or higher. Gastrointestinal, renal & 
hepatic effects were noted at 16 mg/kg/day or greater. Transient neurological effects (with no 
pathological correlate) manifested in some animals treated at 32 and 128 mg/kg/day. The clinical 
relevance of the neurological effects is discussed in the Safety Pharmacology section, however in 
summary the potential for neurotoxicity is considered to be low with the proposed posology for IV 
artesunate Amivas.  
Other findings in repeat-dose studies were as follows: hepatic and testicular effects at the highest dose 
in monkeys (128 mg/kg) associated with elevated ALP levels (a class effect reported in the literature), 
slight increases in transaminases, mild to marked hepatocyte vacuolation and moderate testicular 
spermatid degeneration. Dose-dependent haemolysis and haemoglobinuria were also observed in 
monkey studies. The dog also showed a dose-related increased incidence of vomiting at high doses 
particularly following 50 mg/kg upward.

The applicant considers the animal toxicity profile to be consistent with that seen in human clinical 
trials, identifying haematological effects as the primary adverse event of interest following IV 
artesunate dosing. Anaemia was the AE that was most consistently reported across the Phase 1 and 2 
studies, occurring in >10% of healthy volunteers in the Phase 1 studies and in 23%-43% of patients 
with uncomplicated malaria in the Phase 2 studies. Similarly, among patients with severe or 
complicated malaria in Study R-CDC-060, anaemia was the most frequently reported AE overall, 
occurring in ~65% of patients in the safety analysis population. In the Phase 1 and 2 clinical trials, 
there were also modest decreases in reticulocyte count observed. Neutropenia was reported in up to 
60% of patients with uncomplicated malaria in the Phase 2 studies; but it was primarily associated 
with serotherapeutic IV AS doses >2.4 mg/kg daily. Neutropenia occurred much less frequently in 
healthy volunteers (5.0%) in the Phase 1 studies and in patients with severe or complicated malaria 
treated with IV AS 2.4 mg/kg daily in Study R-CDC-060 (4.9%). Hepatobiliary AEs were not reported 
in the clinical Phase 1 studies in healthy volunteers. However, in the Phase 2 studies in patients with 
uncomplicated malaria, there were sporadic reports of jaundice, hepatomegaly, or ALT increased that 
affected <4% of patients at a given IV AS dose level. In human studies conducted with the Guilin 
artesunate/bicarbonate formulation, similar hematologic effects (e.g., decreases in RBC counts, 
haemoglobin, and/or reticulocytes) have been observed. Haemolysis and increases in bilirubin and 
ALT/AST have also been noted. Thus, it is considered that the nonclinical single and repeat-dose 
studies adequately characterise the toxicity of artesunate and DHA. Toxicokinetic data from nonclinical 
studies is limited, however it must be noted that exposure-based safety margins are narrow or non-
existent to the reported clinical exposure.  
The potential genotoxicity of artesunate was investigated by the Applicant (bacterial reverse mutagen 
assay, in vitro chromosome aberration assay and 2 in vivo micronucleus assays (mouse and rat) and 
was found to be negative for genotoxic or mutagenic potential. Studies were not performed with DHA, 
however with rapid conversion of artesunate to DHA in vitro and in vivo it is considered that the 
genotoxic potential of DHA will have been covered in artesunate studies. Carcinogenicity studies have 
not been conducted with artesunate. This is acceptable due to the short duration of treatment 
proposed with Artesunate Amivas, also taking into account the absence of tumour findings in repeat-
dose studies conducted to date.  
Fertility and early embryonic development studies were not conducted with artesunate. Male and 
female reproductive organs were examined in the 7-day monkey study. No apparent effects were 
noted in female organs, however moderate testicular spermatid degeneration was noted in males after 
daily IV dosing at 128 mg/kg. No such observations were evident in the 28-day pivotal repeat dose 
studies in rat and dog up to doses of 30 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, respectively. A literature review 
presented by the applicant suggests that artesunate may induce effects of male spermatogenesis in 
rodents following oral administration. A comparison of IV and oral PK does not indicate prolonged 
exposure via the oral route in rats. The mechanism of toxicity thus remains unknown and the clinical 
relevance of this is unclear.  However, the exposure to artesunate and DHA in the GLP IV studies 
conducted by the applicant (at the NOEL for organ pathology) is generally higher than reported clinical 
exposure in patients with uncomplicated or severe malaria. The risk to male fertility on the basis of the 
exposure-based safety margins could be low, however it cannot be ignored that artesunate induces 
adverse effects on epididymis, testis and sperm parameters in male animals and this is included in the 
appropriate sections of the SmPC. The Applicant provided a study protocol for “an intravenous injection 
fertility and early embryonic development (FEED) study of artesunate in SD rats” (3851-3), with final 
reporting due by Q4 2021. 
Embryofetal development (EFD) was investigated in a number of studies in the rat, rabbit and 
cynomolgus monkey. Studies were conducted using oral administration of artesunate, and 
bioavailability by the oral route is expected to be low. Artesunate administration induced a pattern of 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 24/110 
 
 
 
 
toxicity that was largely similar across nonclinical species and dose dependent. A classic spectrum of 
embyrotoxic effects were observed, including embryolethality, cardiovascular malformations (including 
ventral septal defects) and skeletal anomalies (e.g. ribs, long bones and/or scapulae). In rabbits, 
cranio-facial and CNS/brain malformations were observed at all doses (absent areas of brain, severely 
dilated brain ventricles, spina bifida, supraoccipital cleft, swelling of occipital region of skull 4/2 
fetuses/litters at low dose and absent areas of brain 2/1 fetuses/litter and 1/1 fetuses/litter at mid and 
high dose, respectively). The applicant postulates that the difference in placentation and the presence 
of a visceral yolk sack in rats and rabbits versus humans may in part account for differential artesunate 
exposure in utero. Also, the duration of treatment in non-clinical studies accounts for a greater period 
of the gestational cycle in nonclinical species versus the human gestational period. Radiolabelled 
artesunate was also present at 2-4-fold higher concentrations in the placenta and uterus of pregnant 
rats versus blood exposure.  Several studies in rats and monkeys also investigated critical or sensitive 
windows in the gestational period for artesunate-induced toxicity. GD 9-14 and GD 30-45 were 
identified as periods of higher susceptibility to artesunate-induced embryotoxicity in rats and monkeys, 
respectively. The embryotoxic mechanism of artesunate is thought to be in part due its effects on the 
haematological system and sensitivity of embryonic erythroblasts and maturation of RBCs in the 
gestational period. The exposures achieved in EFD studies is far lower than exposure achieved in 
pregnant humans following IV administration (4 mg/kg/day). These women were in their second or 
third trimesters of pregnancy outcomes and no adverse outcomes (including congenital abnormalities 
or developmental issues up to 1 year of age) were observed. Notably, erythroblasts are the primary 
form of circulating blood cells in weeks 6-13 of human gestation, thus it cannot be ruled out that a risk 
exists in early pregnancy. There are also insufficient data on the breastfeeding period in human 
(Schaeffer, 2015). Revisions have been made to section 4.6 of the SmPC accordingly. Pre- and 
postnatal developmental studies were not conducted. The applicant referenced a WHO report (2003) 
on the safety of artemisinin derivatives and no detrimental developmental effects were evident in the 
offspring of dams dosed with artesunate. Although supportive, the study design and exposure data was 
not presented, thus in light of the findings in studies conducted by the applicant it is possible that 
exposure of artesunate in these studies is lower than clinical exposure with IV artesunate. Overall, the 
clinical relevance of this data is unclear. A study in juvenile animals with a combination product (daily 
dose of artesunate: 0.235 mg/kg) was not associated with any adverse effects when administered 
from postnatal day 4-31 (orally). Local tolerance was evaluated in rat and dogs. Artesunate was 
considered non-irritant when administered up to 6 mg/ml and 50 mg/ml in rat and dog, respectively. 
Artesunate was compatible with human, rat, and monkey blood at concentrations up to 60 μM, while 
haemolysis was observed at 10 mg/mL. Blood compatibility of artesunate could not be evaluated in 
dogs due to incompatibility of the PBS vehicle in this species. 
2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The Applicant should provide a complete Phase I ERA with an experimentally derived LogKow (and 
specific PBT assessment if necessary). The Applicant has committed to provide an updated Phase 1 
assessment with the experimentally derived LogKow when the study is completed, and this will be 
submitted as a post-authorisation measure. As a result, there is insufficient data to definitively 
conclude on the potential risk of artesunate to the environment. 
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Nonclinical pharmacodynamic studies including in-vitro studies and in-vivo models of malaria 
demonstrate the anti-malarial efficacy of artesunate in rodent and non-rodent species.  
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021

No secondary pharmacology studies were conducted for artesunate. Safety pharmacology studies 
addressed cardiovascular, respiratory and central nervous system safety in addition to gastrointestinal 
safety. No respiratory effects were noted in the telemetered dog study. A hERG assay was not 
conducted with artesunate, however the applicant referenced a literature report on the hERG potential 
of DHA, which is clinically relevant given the rapid conversion of artesunate to DHA in vivo. hERG 
inhibition was evident in vitro, however the applicant considered that the clinical risk at the proposed 
dose of 2.4 mg/kg is low. On the basis of supporting evidence from clinical studies, demonstrating no 
direct effects on QT prolongation, it is agreed that the risk is low.  
Central nervous system toxicity was evaluated with a review of literature and a neurotoxicity 
assessment in rhesus monkeys including a pathology assessment of brain tissue. Artemisinin 
derivatives have been associated with neurotoxicity in nonclinical species and the topic was the subject 
of a review by WHO.  
Key findings of the report were that water-soluble artemisinins had less toxic potential and the vehicle 
or route of administration also altered the neurotoxic profile. Shorter duration of exposure was also 
associated with reduced toxicity. In the rhesus monkey study, transient neurological signs including 
prostration, drooling and spontaneous motor activity were noted at doses of 32 mg/kg or greater and 
resolved within 1 hour. No pathological correlates were noted in any brain region. Overall, the weight 
of evidence suggests the previously reported neurotoxicity in nonclinical species does not represent a 
likely risk to patients treated with IV artesunate at the proposed posology.  
Pharmacokinetic studies were conducted in rats, dogs and monkeys. A bioequivalence study was 
conducted in rats and dogs to compare Guilin and WRAIR formulations.  
Nonclinical PK studies demonstrated that artesunate is rapidly converted to DHA and has a biphasic 
pattern of distribution. Enterohepatic circulation of artesunate was identified by multiple peaks of 
radioactivity. The PK of artesunate was similar in rats and dogs. Conversion of artesunate to DHA was 
rapid in both species although the conversion rate in dogs was lower than humans. DHA was also 
rapidly cleared and there were no apparent sex differences. DHA was observed as two tautomers after 
rapid administration in rats. No difference in activity is expected between these two tautomers. IV 
administration with radiolabelled artesunate showed that the small intestine was the site for highest 
exposure (68%) and was rapidly cleared but concentrations were detected in the spleen at high levels 
after 192 hours. Exposure in the brain was also higher than plasma concentrations. In pregnant rats, 
there was prolonged exposure of reproductive tissues to artesunate.  
Drug-drug interaction studies showed that DHA moderately inhibited substrates of CYP1A2 and 
CYP2C19. However, this is not of great relevance considering that in clinical studies, no relevant CYP 
inhibition was found.  This is supported by the absence of changes in markers for these enzymes in an 
in-vivo DDI study in rhesus monkeys. It should be noted that inhibition studies were not conducted in 
line with guidance and there is outstanding information on UGT enzyme inhibition by DHA (Post-
authorisation measure).   
The toxicology of artesunate was characterised in a host of nonclinical species including Sprague 
Dawley rats, beagle dogs, rabbits and rhesus and cynomolgus monkeys. Some GLP-compliant studies 
were conducted with WRAIR formulation and 2 pivotal (GLP) repeat dose studies were conducted with 
the SS-API. Repeat-dose toxicology studies utilised IV administration and the predominant finding was 
haematological effects, characterized by dose-dependent anaemia and reticulocytopenia and 
sometimes transient leukopenia and neutropenia, consistently across all species. These findings 
correlated with enlarged spleens and erythroid hyperplasia and were observed at all doses in the 
pivotal studies, thus general toxicity NOAELs could not be defined. These haematological toxicities 
were reversible in all studies. Other toxicities identified included hepatic effects (monkeys), GI effects 
(monkey and dog) and haemolysis (monkeys), all of which were largely transient or reversible. As 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 26/110 
 
 
 
 
discussed, the neurotoxic effects seen at high doses in monkeys were transient, without pathological 
correlate and unlikely to present a reasonable clinical risk with this product. A finding of increased 
heart rate in mid and high dose groups in the pivotal rat study were considered non-adverse, however 
in light of a pharmacodynamic mechanism (and increased blood pressure in cardiovascular safety 
pharmacology study in dogs), the Applicant was asked to discuss the clinical relevance of these 
observations. A thorough discussion of the cardiovascular findings in non-clinical and clinical studies by 
the Applicant concluded that based on the totality of the data there is no significant cardiovascular 
safety concern related to artesunate. This conclusion can be agreed. The toxicities identified in repeat 
dose studies captures those reported in clinical trials, most notably haematological toxicity. The 
absence of safety margins in nonclinical studies to the anticipated clinical exposure is considered 
acceptable as the risk are identified and can be monitored/managed and possibly acceptable in the 
context of the indication in severe malaria.  
In relation to fertility, dedicated GLP studies in the rat and dog did not indicate any toxicity associated 
with IV artesunate although literature reports have suggested that oral artesunate induced testicular 
toxicity. This is not considered to be of concern for IV artesunate as there are sufficient margins at the 
top doses (30 mg/kg and 40 mg/kg, respectively) which represent NOELs for organ pathology. 
Embryofetal toxicity was observed in rats, rabbits and cynomolgus monkeys following oral 
administration and included embryolethality and malformations of the cardiovascular and skeletal 
systems. Exposures in these studies are significantly lower than clinical exposure. The applicant 
presented observational data from pregnant women treated with artesunate, which indicate that 
embryofetal toxicity is not a translatable risk in humans. The applicant postulates that differences in 
placentation/presence of a visceral yolk sack in rats/rabbits and humans and the duration of 
artesunate exposure during a ‘window of sensitivity’ to artesunate could explain the differential 
findings. The Applicant provided a study protocol for “an intravenous injection fertility and early 
embryonic development (FEED) study of artesunate in SD rats” (3851-3). (Post-authorisation 
measure) 
A reduction in erythroblasts was one of the pathological findings in the monkey EFD study, in addition 
to heart defects. There is also evidence that foetal blood cells are more sensitive to artesunate than 
maternal cells. It is plausible that the toxicity observed in nonclinical species is related to the timing of 
erythroblast maturation in the developing embryo. Erythroblasts are the main form of circulating RBC 
in the human foetus between 6 - and 13 weeks gestation. On this basis it is considered that the risk in 
early pregnancy is greater and should be considered before administering to a pregnant woman (see 
Section 4.6 of the SmPC). Data on exposure via breastfeeding is not available and is clarified in said 
section of the SmPC.  
GLP compliance of pivotal genotoxicity studies had been raised. The studies related to the GLP concern 
are the bacterial mutagenicity assay and in vitro chromosomal aberration assay with artesunate 
(studies G305-08 and G306-08 both performed at SRI International, Menlo Park, CA, USA), which both 
were assessed as negative. However, the FDA conducted an inspection of the 2 studies on behalf of the 
EMA in March 2021. This inspection concluded that the final reports completely and accurately reflect 
the raw data and that there were no findings associated with these studies. Carcinogenicity studies 
have not been conducted; this is acceptable. No other significant toxicities were observed.  
Regarding the ERA, an experimentally derived Log Kow for artesunate is being undertaken and will be 
completed in Oct 2021. This will be included as part of the Phase 1 assessment and an updated ERA 
provided and submitted post-authorisation.  As a result of the above considerations, the available data 
do not allow to conclude definitively on the potential risk of artesunate to the environment.  The 
applicant commits to perform the following study as follow-up measure:

“Experimentally derived LoKow as per guidance is required to inform on potential risk to the 
environment. Due Q4 2021.” 
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no outstanding preclinical issues to preclude the issue of a Marketing Authorisation.  
However, the CHMP considers the following measures necessary to be conducted: 
- An in vitro study of the potential inhibition of UGT2B7 and UGT1A9 by DHA:  Glucuronidation is the 
major elimination pathway of DHA and therefore UGT enzyme inhibition should be investigated as per 
guidance. Due Q4 2021. 
- An Intravenous Injection Fertility and Early Embryonic Development Study of Artesunate in Sprague 
Dawley Rats:  To assess the impact of IV artesunate on female fertility and early embryonic 
development. Due Q4 2022. 
- Updated Phase 1 ERA with experimentally derived LogKow:  Experimentally derived LoKow as per 
guidance is required to inform on potential risk to the environment. Due Q4 2021. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
GCP inspections of the two pivotal efficacy studies are not feasible. The applicant proposes that the 
following three trials are pivotal: 
o  R-CDC-060 (non-comparative, retrospective; used a version of Artesunate Amivas) 
o  AQUAMAT (comparative but using Guilin artesunate) 
o  SEAQUAMAT (comparative but using Guilin artesunate) 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC, 
although they were not conducted fully in accordance with GCP. 
CDC-060 was conducted by the US CDC under their IND. The CSR was prepared by the Department of 
the Army, in collaboration with the CDC. The principles of GCP were followed to the extent possible in 
both trial conduct and documentation procedures but the final study report is not fully compliant due to 
the nature of the study and various methods of data collection between involved sites. 
The US Army obtained permissions from the Wellcome Trust to use the data from the SEAQUAMAT 
trial. It was not possible to employ traditional GCP inspection methods during the trial. The sponsor 
was unwilling to give permission for a study audit by the US Army or any subsequent Regulatory 
Authority. The same limitations applied to AQUAMAT but the applicant was also denied access to 
patient level data and permission to audit this study. 
•  Tabular overview of clinical studies 
Three clinical studies with PK objectives involved IV administration of the US Army formulation that 
was the precursor to Artesunate Amivas.

The demonstration of efficacy of IV artesunate is based on two prospective, randomised, controlled 
trials (RCTs) conducted between 2003 and 2010 funded by the Wellcome Trust. 
o 
The South East Asian Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial - SEAQUAMAT - conducted 2003-2005 in 
adults and children with severe falciparum malaria admitted to hospitals in Asia and SE Asia (Lancet 
2005; 366: 717-25). 
o 
The African Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial - AQUAMAT - conducted 2005-2010 in children with 
severe falciparum malaria admitted to hospitals in Africa (Lancet 2010; 376: 1647-57). 
o 
SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT used artesunate manufactured in Guilin, China.  
Four efficacy studies used US Army artesunate to treat malaria, of which two concerned severe 
malaria.

2.6.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.6.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
Artesunate Amivas is given intravenously as a bolus injection over 1-2 minutes. 
Study 1128 - US Army 2005-2006 
This was a placebo-controlled single ascending dose (SAD) study with doses from 0.5 to 8 mg/kg given 
by intravenous bolus over 2 min after an overnight fast. For artesunic acid, there were very few 
quantifiable levels reported beyond 1 h. 
For DHA, the profiles were well defined at all dose levels for up to 6 h but not at 24 h.  
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 30/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The estimated mean concentrations of artesunic acid at the end of the infusion (C0.033) increased 
from 8241 ng/mL at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg to 64,336 ng/mL at the highest dose.  
Thus, for an 8-fold increase in dose there was a 7.8-fold increase in the C0.033 value, suggesting 
linearity in this relationship. Similarly, there was a linear relationship between dose and AUC 
parameters; for an 8-fold increase in dose the mean AUC0-last values increased 8.6-fold and AUC0-∞ 
values increased 8.7 fold.  
For DHA, across the 8-fold difference in dose from 1.0 to 8 mg/kg, the increment in mean AUC0-last was 
8.8-fold and AUC0-∞ values increased 8.7-fold. However, linearity was not shown for the 0.5 mg/kg 
dose. Thus, the applicant concluded that artesunic acid and DHA exhibit linearity across the dose range 
of 1.0 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg. 
Correspondingly, based on tabulated dose-normalised data, there were no significant differences 
between treatment groups for artesunate or across the 1-8 mg/kg dose groups for DHA.

Table 3: Statistical Summary for Dihydroartimisinin Pharmacokinetic Parameters 
Study 1142 – US Army 2006-2007 
This was a multiple ascending dose (MAD) study in healthy subjects aged 18-55 years. Randomisation 
was to 2 mg/kg, 4 mg/kg or 8 mg/kg artesunate or placebo once daily for 3 days. At each dose level, 
plasma levels of artesunic acid declined very rapidly. DHA was quantifiable within 5 minutes of dosing 
and was detectable for at least 6 h. DHA Cmax was at ~20 min with a half-life of about 1 to 2 h. 
Comparison of AUCs indicated that DHA plasma exposure was approximately twice that of artesunate

There were no significant differences for within dose group comparisons of Days 1, 2 and 3 data for 
artesunic acid AUClast and C0 and for DHA AUC24 and AUClast. Similarly, there were no significant 
differences between the study days for DHA Cmax for the 4.0 mg/kg and 8.0 mg/kg treatments. A

The primary objective was to determine PK over 6 h after a dose of 2.4 mg/kg in 30 Kenyan adults 
with uncomplicated falciparum malaria mono-infection. Patients were male or non-pregnant female 
adults aged 18 to 65 years. On Study Days 0, 1 and 2, subjects received 2.4 mg/kg intravenous 
artesunate once daily. There were 268 plasma samples analysed. Artesunate was quantifiable in 164 
samples with a range between 0.86 and 40,027 ng/ml and DHA was quantifiable in all but one post-

dose sample with a range between 2.24 and 5582 ng/ml. The mean concentration-time profiles of 
artesunic acid and DHA are shown in the figures.

For artesunic acid, there were very few quantifiable levels reported beyond 1 h. The estimated mean 
peak concentration of artesunic acid at the end of the infusion (C0.028) was 28,557 ng/ml. Plasma 
levels declined rapidly with a half-life of less than 20 minutes in most patients.

Table 5: Pharmacokinetic Parameters for Artesunic Acid Calculated using a Comparmental 
Analysis 
For DHA the profiles were well defined at all dose levels for up to 6 h. The results for DHA using a non-
compartmental analysis and a compartmental analysis are summarised in the two tables below. No 
significant differences were found between the model-dependent and model-independent calculations. 
The results also showed no significant differences between AUC0-last and AUC0-∞, indicating that 
elimination was almost complete 6 h after dosing. The mean half-life of DHA was 1.25 h with the peak 
concentration of 2,796 ng/mL occurring 0.20 hours after the infusion.

Compartmental Analysis

Compartmental Analysis 
The study confirmed that artesunic acid was rapidly converted to DHA, which was detectable in all 
patients until 6 h after infusion. The plasma concentration of DHA was higher than that of artesunic 
acid, with a 1.89 ratio of AUC of DHA/artesunic acid. In contrast, the artesunic acid/DHA Cmax ratio 
was 10.35. 
Distribution 
Vd values of ~1 L/kg imply that artesunate and DHA distribute to ~60 L in a 60 kg adult, which is close 
to adult total body water (42 L).

Li (2006) reported that [14C] artesunate was 73% bound to human plasma proteins. Batty (2004) used 
10-[3H]-DHA to assess protein binding in whole blood from 15 healthy volunteers and 22 Vietnamese 
patients with P. falciparum or P. vivax uncomplicated malaria. DHA was ~93% protein bound and the 
α-DHA:β-DHA ratio was 6.5:1 in the patients with malaria. DHA protein binding was 88% in 
Vietnamese volunteers and 91% in Caucasian volunteers. In the albumin binding studies, the free 
fraction of DHA was not concentration-dependent.  
Using artemisinin radiolabeled with tritiated borohydride, the tritiated DHA showed low concentrations 
in culture medium with accumulation in erythrocytes infected with P. falciparum. Uninfected 
erythrocytes concentrated the drug less than 2-fold whereas infected erythrocytes achieved more than 
300 times the concentration in the culture medium. 
Penetration of AS and DHA into CSF was assessed in 6 adults with cerebral or severe malaria who 
underwent LP on admission and during convalescence at different times (from 15 to 120 minutes) after 
IV dosing with 120 mg artesunate. Artesunate was not detected in any CSF sample. At 15 min post 
injection, the DHA concentration in CSF was 4% of that in plasma but the concentration increased with 
time, suggesting continuing influx but a slower efflux of DHA, thought to reflect a sink effect of DHA 
uptake transfer by lipid-rich brain structures. DHA levels in CSF reached > 100 nmol/L at 120 min in 
samples from acute and convalescent phases. 
Excretion 
In Study 1128 (SAD), clearance of artesunic acid was high at approximately 100 L/hr (>1500 mL/min) 
after doses of 1.0 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg.  
The CL parameter for DHA could not be determined unless it was assumed that there was 100% 
conversion of artesunic acid to DHA within the body and all of the DHA formed was delivered to the 
systemic circulation prior to elimination. If this assumption holds, the apparent CL of the metabolite 
was approximately 50 L/hr and the apparent Vd was about 100 L. Thus, in comparison with the parent 
compound, DHA has a smaller CL and a larger Vd, which together yield a half-life (T½ = ln(2) x Vd/CL) 
that is longer than that of artesunic acid. 
Metabolism 
Based on in-vitro studies with rat and human liver microsomes and recombinant cytochromes: 
o 
o 
o 
o 
o 
Conversion of artesunate to DHA is due to CYP2A6 and blood esterases; 
In human liver microsomal incubations of DHA, DHA-glucuronide was the only metabolite found; 
Formation of DHA-glucuronide was predominantly due to UGT1A9; 
There was no significant metabolism of DHA by CYP isoenzymes or by cytosolic sulfotransferases; 
Urine from patients contained α-DHA-β-glucuronide (α-DHA-G) and a variable amount of the 
tetrahydrofuran isomer of α-DHA-G while DHA was present in very small amounts.  
Inter-conversion 
According to d’Acquarica et al. (2010), the reduction of artemisinin by NaBH4 to form DHA gives rise to 
a stereochemically labile centre at C-10. This results in two interconverting lactol hemiacetal tautomers 
(also called epimers or isomers), named DHA2α and DHA2β, with a rate of interconversion that 
depends on buffer, pH and solvent polarity. Interconversion occurs on a chromatographic time-scale, 
which has implications for analytical methods. In the solid state, the drug consists exclusively of the β-
epimer; however, upon dissolution, the two epimers equilibrate, reaching different solvent-dependent 
ratios with different rates. Such equilibration also occurs in vivo, irrespective of the isomeric purity at

which the drug would have been administered. Batty et al. (2004), when investigating protein binding 
(see above), found that the α-DHA anomer predominated in human samples with ratios of α-DHA:β-
DHA that were in the range 5.4 to 6.9. Clinical trials showing superior efficacy to standard of care did 
not control for interconversion, nor did in vitro susceptibility studies. Expert opinion is that any 
occurrence of interconversion is not important for safety or efficacy in clinical use. 
Pharmacokinetics in target population 
The applicant provided a comparison between Day 1 PK in healthy volunteers in 1128 and 1142 (IV 
dose 2 mg/kg) vs. infected patients in 1168 (IV dose 2.4 mg/kg; results normalised to 2 mg/kg).

The applicant also compared artesunate and DHA PK parameters across many studies, including some 
reported only in the literature and which used the Guilin product. Not only did the dose vary but also 
the route of administration (some were oral studies), mechanics of administration (e.g. solution and 
injection/infusion time) and the assay. Since DHA is the most active moiety and since Cmax artesunate 
may be unreliable, the table shows the DHA data.

Values given as mean unless otherwise specified.  
Davis-2001 reported data from 30 Vietnamese adults with slide-positive falciparum malaria treated 
with IV artesunate. The mean values for DHA elimination t½, CL, and Vz were comparable to those 
after IV artesunate administration to healthy subjects, suggesting that severity of the malaria did not 
influence PK. There was a non-significant but borderline inverse correlation between time to 50% 
parasite clearance (PCT50) and AUC for DHA 24 patients (P=0.06). 
Nealon-2002 also concluded that the severity of malaria does not have an important influence on the 
PK of artesunate and DHA. Newton-2006 reported a large inter-individual variability (10-fold) in DHA 
Cmax and AUC in patients with severe malaria but no concentration-parasiticidal effect relationship was 
significant based on comparing Cmax, AUC, Tlast and t1/2 for artesunate and DHA with PCT, PC50 and 
PC90.

Special populations 
Impaired renal and/or hepatic function 
Renal and/or hepatic impairment often accompany severe malaria. The severe malaria patients studied 
by Davis (2001) had mean creatinine levels of 301 μmol/L and mean AST levels of 183 U/L on 
presentation. For severe malaria patients in Study CDC-060, 20%, 18% and 9% of the evaluable 
population had mild, moderate and severe renal impairment, respectively, and 7% were on dialysis at 
baseline. Also, the baseline MELD scores suggested that 11%, 38%, 13% and 7% of patients had mild, 
moderate, severe and life-threatening liver disease, respectively. Based on DHA AUCs, the applicant 
states that clinically significant renal and hepatic impairment do not affect DHA exposure.  
Elderly 
The US Army studies did not provide PK data in elderly persons. No PK data are reported by the 
applicant from the literature after IV artesunate in persons aged >65 years.  
Children 
The WHO (2015) recommended that children of <20 kg should receive 3 mg/kg/dose vs. 2.4 
mg/kg/dose for heavier persons. The applicant’s position is that support for this recommendation is 
weak, referring to two published POPPK studies in children, one of which was confined to oral dosing. 
Zaloumis 2014 conducted an analysis of PK data from 71 adults and 195 children with severe malaria, 
with a mixture of sparse and rich sampling within the first 12 h after IV artesunate administration. A 
one-compartment model described the population PK of DHA adequately. Body weight had the greatest 
impact on DHA PK, resulting in lower DHA exposure for smaller children (6–10 kg) than for adults. 
With standard dosing (2.4 mg/kg/dose), 6-10 kg children showed a reduction in geometric mean DHA 
exposure of 13.7% (95% CI: 11.7–15.6%; P <0.001) compared with 21-25 kg children.  
Importantly, there was no correlation between exposure and PCT50. In the PD analysis for 142 
patients who received 2.4 mg/kg IV artesunate at baseline, the median parasite clearance half-life was 
3.1 h with 25% (14/55) of patients clearing 90% of their baseline parasitaemia by 12 h. A non-
significant association between post hoc DHA Vd and PC90 at 12 h was found such that a doubling of Vd 
was associated with a 0.28-fold decrease in the odds of PC90 at 12 h (95% CI: 0.07–1.11; P=0.07). 
However, post hoc estimates of DHA exposure were not significantly associated with parasitological 
outcomes. 
In 2020, the US FDA performed new PK simulations of IV artesunate dosing in paediatric patients with 
severe malaria using information obtained from Zaloumis’ population-based meta-analysis of DHA PK.

Each box represents the 25th and 75th percentile of the DHA exposure measure. The bar and cross inside the box represent the 
median and mean respectively, whiskers represent 1.5 times the interquartile range. The gray band represents the interquartile 
range for patients weighing 20 to 25 kg (8 to 10 years of age) and adults. Clearance was estimated using a combination of 
allometric weight scaling with a sigmoid function to account for organ maturation. 
Figure 6: Predicted Steady-State DHA AUC0-12 in Pediatric Patients 0 to 3 Years of Age with 
Severe Malaria after 2.4 mg/kg Artesunate for Injection 
These simulations demonstrated that a dosing regimen of 2.4 mg/kg resulted in comparable or greater 
predicted steady state DHA AUC0-12h in infants less than 6 months of age compared to that observed in 
older children or adults. The difference in predicted exposures in infants less than 6 months of age was 
presumed to be due to immature development of the UGT elimination pathway for DHA. 
Pregnancy 
A POPPK analysis was conducted using data from Kingasani Maternity Clinic in the DRC obtained from 
26 pregnant women in the second or third trimester and from 25 non-pregnant female controls. All 
subjects received 200 mg oral artesunate. After oral dosing, the effect of pregnancy on DHA CL/F was 
determined to be significant, with a pregnancy-associated increase in DHA CL/F of 42.3% (19.7 - 
72.3%). The plasma concentration profile thus differed slightly between pregnant and non-pregnant 
women after oral dosing. 
However, in a study of malaria in pregnancy, McGready et al. (2011) women with uncomplicated 
falciparum malaria received intravenous artesunate 4 mg/kg on the first day and oral artesunate 4 
mg/kg on the second day or vice versa. All women then received oral artesunate 4 mg/kg/day for 5 
days. Controls were the same women restudied when healthy and at 3 months post-partum.  
Artesunate and DHA PK were similar after IV artesunate administration to pregnant women with 
malaria (n = 20) and to controls (n = 14). The ratio of t½ for both analytes was 0.9. The ratios of Vd 
for artesunate and DHA were 0.64 [P = 0.59] and 0.74 [P =0.12], respectively, and the AUC ratios 
were 1.2 [P=0.87] and 1.1 [P = 0.25], respectively. However, oral administration resulted in higher 
total drug exposure in pregnancy. Total DHA exposure was lower at Day 6 in pregnant women with 
malaria (P < 0.001) compared with Day 0 or 1, but this effect was not observed in the controls 
(P=0.084).

and in the Same Women Post-Partum in a Healthy State 
Combined PK values for mildly and moderately ill pregnant patients are shown in the figure. 
Figure 7: Combined Drug Exposure of AS and DHA 
It was concluded that artesunate and DHA PK following IV artesunate dosing did not differ substantially 
between pregnant and post-partum women. There was a significantly higher combined drug exposure 
in women who were more unwell indicating reduced drug clearance.  
Interactions 
With the exception of a few sponsored studies, the information is reported from the literature. 
Transporter studies 
Artesunate and DHA were not substrates for any of the transporters investigated. 
DHA does not inhibit P-gp. Artesunate and DHA at 50 µM and 10 µM did not inhibit OATP1B3, OAT1, 
OCT2, MATE1 and MATE2K. Artesunate 50 µM and DHA 10 µM displayed moderate inhibition of OAT3 
and OCT1 that ranged from 33% to 51% and 21% to 43%, respectively. Artesunate was a weak

inhibitor of OATP1B1 (IC50 = 19 µg/mL) and OAT3. Artesunate and DHA had no or moderate 
interactions with MDR1 and BCRP and they inhibited BSEP in a non-specific manner. 
The in vitro concentrations (10 μM DHA = 3μg/mL; 50 μM artesunate = 19 μg/mL) are somewhat 
higher than Cmax for these drugs [1-3 μg/mL], but neither the in vitro concentration nor the Cmax 
accounts for protein binding. Since the incubation medium for the transporter studies used a protein 
concentration of 1 mg/mL while human plasma/serum has a protein concentration of 70 mg/mL, 
unbound drug would be much higher in the in vitro model than found in human plasma/serum. 
CYP studies 
In one study, artesunic acid did not inhibit CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6 or CYP3A4 (IC50 values 
>40 μM). DHA moderately inhibited CYP1A2 (IC50 value of 10 μM) and CYP2C19 (IC50 value of 9 μM). 
These IC50 values are ~5-fold above the DHA unbound maximum concentration (Cmax) values observed 
in healthy subjects (1.67 μM) after a dose of 8 mg/kg.  
Using human liver microsomes, DHA 10 µM was a poor inhibitor of CYP2B6, CYP2C8, CYP2C9, CYP2D6, 
CYP2E1 and CYP3A with <15% inhibition. DHA was a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 (42% inhibition at 
10 µM). DHA was also a relatively strong inhibitor of CYP1A with >50% inhibition at 10 µM. Using 
recombinant CYP enzymes, DHA was a poor inhibitor of CYP2C9, CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 with <15% 
inhibition at 10 µM, a moderate inhibitor of CYP2C19 with 22% inhibition at 10 µM and a relatively 
strong inhibitor of CYP1A2 with >66% inhibition at 10 µM. 
The risk of DDI, calculated by the I/Ki method, is shown below. Data are based on estimated K, values 
and the maximum unbound systemic concentrations of inhibitor ([I]max ,u) or the maximum unbound 
concentrations of inhibitors at the inlet to the liver ([I]max , inlet, u) for artemisinin, artemether and DHA

It was concluded that DHA inhibited 2C19 and 1A2 and artesunate inhibited 1A2 in human liver 
microsomes with IC50 values of 7-13 μM. The data suggest a predicted medium to high risk for DDIs 
with DHA on CYP1A2.  
Artemisinin compounds have been shown to auto-induce their own metabolism, resulting in decreased 
concentrations and exposure over time. In study 8740133, DHA was evaluated for CYP enzyme 
induction in human hepatocytes. DHA was not an inducer of CYP1A, CYP2B6, or CYP3A with less than 
40% of positive control activity when assayed with hepatocytes from three human donors.

In vivo 
Drug-drug interactions have been evaluated in 7 clinical trials published between 2007 and 2014. Very 
briefly, and noting the route of administration of artesunate in each study: 
Asimus 2007 conducted a cocktail study in which adults were randomised to receive oral doses of 
artemisinin, DHA, arteether, artemether or artesunate for 5 days. A 6-drug cocktail was given orally on 
Days -6, 1, 5 and 10 to assess the activities of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, CYP2E1 and 
CYP3A. The results suggested that: 
- 
- 
Artemisinin, DHA and artemether are inducers of CYP3A 
Artemisinin, DHA and arteether inhibit CYP1A2 
The authors concluded that magnitudes of the mean changes were low but could be of importance for 
risk of DDIs with drugs that have narrow therapeutic windows. 
Davis 2007 reported no effect of mefloquine on oral artesunate based on comparable DHA AUC∞ 
values. 
Minzi 2007 found no effect of oral artesunate on sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine and Matar 2014 found 
no effect of sulfadoxine and pyrimethamine on oral artesunate. 
Orrell 2008 conducted a crossover study to evaluate co-administration of single oral doses of 
amodiaquine (10 mg/kg) and artesunate (4 mg/kg). When given in combination, the mean AUC was 
lower for DHA [ratio 67% (95% CI 51– 88%); P=0.008] and desethylamodiaquine [ratio 65% (95% CI 
46–90%); P=0.015] when compared with monotherapy. 
Fehintola 2012 co-administered oral nevirapine and artesunate-amodiaquine 200/600 mg. Nevirapine 
resulted in reduced clearance of artesunate by 50% (1950 vs. 2995 L/h; P = 0.03), resulting in a 45% 
increase in the AUC0−96 (105 vs. 69 μg·hr/L; P=0.02). The half-life of DHA was shorter after co-
administration (1.6 vs. 3.2 h; P=0.004) and a lower conversion of artesunate to DHA was observed 
(DHA:AS AUC0−96 = 5.6 vs. 8.5; P=0.008). Overall, co-administration of oral artesunate with 
nevirapine resulted in a decrease in Cmax and AUC of DHA by 59% and 68%, respectively. 
Morris 2012 co-administered oral ritonavir with pyronaridine/artesunate. Ritonavir co-administration 
resulted in a 27% increase in artesunate AUC, a 38% decrease in DHA AUC and a 27% decrease in 
DHA Cmax. Ritonavir exposure was increased 3.2-fold in the presence of pyronaridine/artesunate. It 
was proposed that RTV induced UGTs, which increased DHA glucuronide conjugation.  
2.6.2.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Artemisinin is a sesquiterpene lactone produced by the Chinese medicinal herb Artemisia annua. 
Dihydroartemisinin (DHA) is the active in-vivo metabolite of all clinically used semisynthetic lactol 
derivatives. Activation of the endoperoxide bridge is essential for artemisinin antimalarial activity.  
Artemisinin activation is thought to involve iron-catalyzed reductive scission of the endoperoxide bond, 
generating carbon-centered radicals that react with susceptible groups in parasite proteins and other 
biomolecules. The major source of iron in parasites when located in parasitophorous vacuoles inside 
infected erythrocytes is thought to be in the form of haem species that are liberated following 
plasmodial protease-mediated degradation of imported host haemoglobin. Most of this proteolysis 
occurs during the trophozoite stage when parasites endocytose large quantities of haemoglobin from 
the erythrocyte into an acidic digestive vacuole. Although most of this pool of highly reactive haem is 
sequestered via incorporation of Fe3+-haem dimers (known as β-haematin) into chemically inert 
haemozoin crystals, some haem is available in the reduced Fe2+ form to activate artemisinins.

Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
In-vitro activity 
Artesunate and DHA were tested in in-vitro susceptibility screens at the WRAIR using incorporation of 
radiolabelled hypoxanthine by the parasites as a biomarker of parasite growth. The artesunate and 
DHA IC50 data against P falciparum from W2 and D6 clones using the flow cytometry method and the 
hypoxanthine incorporation assay were compared. W2 is resistant to chloroquine and pyrimethamine 
but susceptible to mefloquine. D6 is susceptible to chloroquine and pyrimethamine and has reduced 
susceptibility to mefloquine and halofantrine.

from Indochine (W2) and Sierra leone (D6) by two different methods 
Additional multidrug-resistant clones used were TM91-C2 [Thailand] and RCS [Brazil] and IC50 values 
were calculated with comparison to in-house historical test data.

Artesunate/Dihydroartemisinin 
Using the WRAIR in-vitro screen, an older lot of artesunate (Starks BM17174/D (1993); non-GMP 
Guilin No. II) performed very similarly to 2 newer GMP lots (Knoll, new and old) of US Army 
artesunate.

Table 13: Parasite 50% Inhiitory Concentrations (ng/mL) of Various Artesunate Lots 
against Parasite Strains at Different Starting Parasitemias (0.8% vs 1.0%) 
Whilst the clinical efficacy data described in the next section relate to P. falciparum infections, 
published data show that the ED50 for artesunate and for DHA was in the low-to-mid nM range for P. 
falciparum and for the other human malarias (P. vivax, P. ovale, P. malariae, P. knowlesi), which 
suggests comparable efficacy of the “other” malarias to P. falciparum. 
Resistance to the artemisinins 
Decreased sensitivity to artemisinins, manifesting clinically as slower rates of parasite clearance, has 
been documented in multiple Southeast Asian countries. In-vitro studies have shown that parasites 
isolated from patients with either fast- or slow-clearing infections exhibit similar sensitivity to DHA in 
standard growth inhibition assays. In contrast, the response of parasites in a ring-stage survival assay 
(RSA0–3 h) generally correlates well with parasite clearance times.  
The primary genetic determinant of resistance was described in laboratory-based selection studies in 
which the artemisinin-sensitive Tanzanian F32 isolate was pressured in a dose-escalating, 125-cycle 
regimen of exposure to artesunate over five years. Whole-genome sequence analysis revealed a 
mutation (M476I) in the propeller domain of the K13 (Kelch13, PF3D7_1343700) gene. Subsequent 
analyses revealed the presence of several mutations in the K13 propeller domain in isolates from 
western Cambodia associated with delayed parasite clearance in patients. The discovery of K13 
mutations and their implication in conferring artemisinin resistance led to the identification of a 
substantial number of polymorphisms in parasites from malaria patients in different regions.  
In a comprehensive analysis conducted by the Tracking Resistance to Artemisinin Collaboration, 
multiple mutations were identified throughout the entire K13 gene. Many in the β-propeller domain 
(beginning at amino acid 442) were associated with parasite clearance half-lives of greater than 5 h. 
Surveillance studies conducted in 59 countries by the K13 Artemisinin Resistance Multicenter 
Assessment consortium recently identified 108 non-synonymous K13 mutations, with an overall 
prevalence of 37% in South East Asia. These mutations showed strong regional differences. For 
example, in Cambodia-Vietnam-Laos the dominant mutation was C580Y (at ~50% prevalence), 
whereas in the samples from Thailand-Myanmar-China the dominant mutation was F446I (at 20% 
prevalence), with minimal C580Y. These data are consistent with multiple de novo mutational events 
accompanied by gene flow between parasite populations. It should be noted that diminished DHA 
susceptibility has to be evaluated against ring-stages, not against mature stages. 
In annual studies conducted in 3 malaria-endemic provinces in the south of Vietnam between 2011 and 
2015, 489 patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria were enrolled and subjected to detailed 
assessments over 42 days following treatment with DHA-piperaquine for three days. Between 2011 
and 2015, the proportion of patients with detectable parasitaemia on Day 3 rose steadily from 38% to 
57% (P < 0.001). In Binh Phuoc province, the parasite clearance half-life increased from 3.75 h in 
2011 to 6.60 h in 2015 (P < 0.001), while treatment failures rose from 0% in 2012 and 2013 to 7% in

2014 and 26% in 2015 (P < 0.001). Recrudescence was associated with in-vitro evidence of 
artemisinin (and piperaquine) resistance.

Figure 9: Ex Vivo Response to DHA and In Vitro Response to Piperaquine 
In the Vietnam treatment failures of 2015, all 14 parasite isolates carried the C580Y Pfkelch 13 gene. 
Also, 93% (13/14) carried exoE415G mutations, which are markers of piperaquine resistance. In the 
paper by Thuy-Nhien (2017) the prevalence of K13 mutations was 29% (222/767), 6% (11/188) and 
43% (45/105) in the Binh Phuoc, Ninh Thuan and Gia Lai Provinces of Vietnam, respectively. 
Cys580Tyr had become the dominant genotype with 79.1% (34/43) of isolates in Binh Phuoc Province 
Assessment report

Page 46/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and 63% (17/27) of isolates in Gia Lai Province carrying this mutation. This analysis of haplotypes 
flanking K13 suggested the presence of multiple strains with the Cys580Tyr mutation rather than a 
single strain expanding across the three sites. 
In Africa (Senegal) in 2014, parasites remained 100% susceptible to AS/DHA.  
Mean ex vivo IC50 values were 1.3 and 0.7 nM, respectively, and no isolates had values at or above the 
resistance cut-off of 12 nM. Furthermore, P. vivax has maintained its susceptibility to AS/DHA. Among 
mutations that have been observed in African isolates, A578S was reported to be the most common 
but gene-editing experiments showed that it does not mediate a resistance phenotype in vitro.  
Importantly, several studies in Africa have reported similar parasite clearance rates in patients 
harbouring wild type or mutant K13 alleles. These data suggest that in Africa K13 mutations are not 
under significant selection pressure and do not adversely affect the efficacy of artemisinin combination 
therapy. One possibility is that the combined effects of high levels of immunity in African populations, 
relatively reduced drug pressure and the frequent occurrence of polyclonal infections (that select 
against resistance phenotypes that have reduced growth rates), are sufficient to prevent the relatively 
mild levels of K13-mediated resistance from altering clinical efficacy.  
The information generated by the CDC Malaria Surveillance Summaries (2012-2016) for artemisinin 
resistance in P. falciparum submitted to the CDC for resistance testing is summarised in the table 
below. Artemisinin resistance was detected in 2/137 (1.5%) isolates in 2014 and in 1/149 (0.7%) in 
2015. The 3 resistant specimens were from Africa and had the K13-propeller marker. No artemisinin-
resistant specimens were detected in 2102, 2013 or 2016.

Secondary pharmacology 
No TQT study was conducted. Detailed ECGs were obtained in studies 1128 and 1142.  
Study 1128 
Baseline ECG data were collected at the same times up to 6 h on the day prior to dosing and after 
dosing. ECG records were transmitted to the central laboratory (Cardiocore, Bethesda, MD) where 
cardiac intervals were measured manually by cardiovascular technologists and then over read by Board 
Certified cardiologists blinded to the study treatment. Measurements were performed on the averaged 
representative beat of lead II. At each ECG time point, blood was drawn for AS and DHA levels. 
For all IV artesunate dose groups, mean placebo-subtracted time-matched differences from baseline in 
QTcF (msec) showed scattered peak effects seen at various observation times, without a clear dose 
response. In the highest dose group, 8 mg/kg, the maximal change of 6.55 msec occurred at 40 min.  
At 4 h, the maximal increase over placebo in any group was 10.42 msec, seen in the 2 mg/kg group.  
There was a statistically significant increase of QTcF (10.39 msec) for the 0.5 mg/kg group at 20 min 
(p<0.5). The only other matched pair with a significant difference was for a QTcF decrease. 
No subject in any group had a QTcF >450 msec at any time. One subject in the placebo group had a 
single increase over baseline in QTcF >30 msec, while no subject in any of the IV artesunate groups 
had such an increase. The maximum mean change from baseline in heart rate observed in the study 
was 4.33 bpm in the 8 mg/kg group at 20 minutes. 
Scatter plots were constructed and linear regressions were performed to assess whether there was a 
relationship between changes in QTc and serum concentration of artesunate or DHA. The estimated 
regression slopes indicated a trend toward smaller changes in QTc with increasing concentrations.  
Study 1142 
On D-1 and on each dosing day (Days 1, 2 and 3) ECGs were done at 5, 20 and 40 min and at 1, 2, 4, 
8 and 24 h post-dose. ECGs were read as in 1128. 
For all IV artesunate dose groups, mean placebo-subtracted time-matched differences from baseline in 
QTcF (msec) were mostly negative. The greatest positive difference was 7.02 msec at 1 h on Day 2 in 
the 2 mg/kg group. At 8 mg/kg, the greatest positive difference was 4.27 msec at 8 h on Day 1 and all 
other differences were negative. No subject had a QTcF > 450 msec. One subject in the 4 mg/kg group 
had a single increase in QTcF > 30 msec on Day 1.  
Mean changes from baseline for HR were within -2 bpm and + 10 bpm except for 12 bpm on Day 3 at 
5 minutes post-dose for the 8 mg/kg group, 13 bpm on Day 2 at 8 h for the 2 mg/kg group and 16 
bpm on Day 3 at 8 h for the 2 mg/kg group. While most of the HR changes were toward positive 
values, there were no obvious trends by time point and none evident by dose. 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021

Overall, new morphological findings in the IV artesunate cohorts were minimal and similar to placebo. 
No relationship was seen between increases in QTc and serum concentrations of artesunate or DHA. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
Since the activity of antimalarial agents, including the artemisinins, is not exerted in plasma and since 
the degree of erythrocyte sequestration of these agents changes as the parasite load changes, so 
investigations of antimalarial effect related to plasma levels is not expected to be fruitful. Furthermore, 
while the applicant has not provided a specific analysis or discussion of the PK-PD relationship, many of 
the published studies included in the dossier have failed to detect relationships between blood levels of 
artesunate and DHA and measures of efficacy, such as PCT. 
2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Pharmacokinetics 
PK data generated with US Army artesunate 
The SAD and MAD Phase 1 studies confirmed that there is rapid conversion of artesunate to DHA after 
IV administration. Thus, clearance of artesunate was high at doses of 1.0 mg/kg to 8.0 mg/kg.  
DHA is the only active metabolite formed after IV artesunate administration and its PK was described 
in the applicant’s studies. Assuming that there is complete conversion of artesunate to DHA within the 
body and that all DHA reaches the systemic circulation prior to elimination, the apparent CL of DHA 
was estimated to be ~50 L/hr and the apparent Vd was about 100 L. Thus, in comparison with the 
parent compound, DHA has a smaller CL and a larger Vd, which together yield a longer half-life.  
Nevertheless, the plasma half-life of DHA is relatively short (1-2 h) and it would not per se support 12 
hourly or daily dosing with IV artesunate. Rather, the rationale for the dose interval reflects the very 
high concentrations of the artemisinins within parasitised erythrocytes compared to plasma levels. 
Since there was no metabolite profiling study conducted, the relative amount of DHA glucuronides to 
artesunate and DHA in plasma is unknown and the PK of the glucuronides has not been described. 
However, it is widely reported that glucuronidated DHA is inactive. In the specific case of IV 
artesunate, and in contrast to the situation for oral artesunate, the omission of a metabolite profiling 
study and lack of data on PK of the glucuronides could be acceptable.  
There was a linear relationship between the IV artesunate dose and plasma artesunate and DHA Cmax 
and AUC parameters after single doses from 1.0 to 8 mg/kg. Moreover, dose-normalised AUCs for 
artesunate and DHA were comparable after multiple doses of 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg. Linearity is important 
for the discussion of paediatric dosing (see below).  
Protein binding 
Variable estimates of protein binding of artesunate and DHA have been published using different 
methods applied to blood samples from different populations. Batty (2004) reported that in non-severe 
P. falciparum malaria, albumin levels (39 g/L) were lower than for normal volunteers (49 g/L), but 
surprisingly the fraction of DHA that was unbound (0.07) was less than in normal volunteers (0.12). 
Alterations in protein binding, if they occur, could affect unbound drug levels in plasma and thus affect 
levels within infected erythrocytes. However, it is relevant to note that the recommended dose of 2.4 
mg/kg was shown to be safe and effective in patients in SEAQUAMAT, in which a range of protein 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 49/110 
 
 
 
 
binding could be expected, including among patients with impaired renal function. Therefore, it seems 
unlikely that variable protein binding would affect the safety or efficacy of the recommended dose. 
Healthy subjects vs. patients with malaria 
The applicant’s data come from adult patients with uncomplicated malaria following the first dose of 
2.4 mg/kg IV artesunate. The plasma profiles for artesunate and DHA in healthy subjects and patients 
with uncomplicated malaria showed that the AUC DHA is about twice that of artesunate. In both 
populations, there was rapid conversion of artesunate to DHA and the plasma half-life of DHA was 
between 1-2 h but the DHA Cmax and AUC in patients after 2.4 mg/kg were disproportionately higher 
than values observed in healthy subjects after a 2 mg/kg dose.  
The available data point to considerable inter-individual variability (IIV) in artesunate and DHA PK after 
IV dosing. However, snce intra-erythrocytic concentrations are critical for efficacy, the IIV for blood 
levels may not translate into variable efficacy when using the recommended dose.  
Special populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Some degree of renal and/or hepatic impairment is very common at presentation in severe malaria 
patients. Based on considerations of PK and of protein binding, as well as the clinical experience in 
treating severe malaria, it can be agreed that no dose adjustment is likely needed.   
Paediatric dosing 
It is agreed with the applicant that a single dose recommendation of 2.4 mg/kg may be applied 
regardless of age. There are no clinical safety and efficacy data that point to the need for a higher dose 
in children < 20 kg. However, there is limited experience with IV artesunate for treatment of malaria in 
the first 18 months of life and very few data on use in the first 6 months of life. The SmPC reflects the 
uncertainties but there is no known reason to preclude use below a certain age. 
Use in the elderly 
It is agreed that no dose adjustment is needed based solely on age. The applicant provided a review of 
experience with IV artesunate in older adults, including the 17 treated with IV artesunate in 
SEAQUAMAT. In comparison with 21 who received quinine in this study, there was no reason found to 
preclude use in older adults.   
Use in pregnancy and breastfeeding 
The same IV artesunate dose may be used in non-pregnant and pregnant women. The applicant 
provided a comprehensive review of available information on pregnancies during which IV artesunate 
was administered in any trimester, along with all known pregnancy outcomes. Among 56 prospective 
artesunate-exposed first trimester patients, death occurred in 3 (5.4%) of foetuses, and there were 2 
infants with congenital abnormalities. These outcomes are not inconsistent with outcomes seen in 
healthy first trimester patients living in the same geographic areas. Information regarding outcomes 
for 340 prospective second or third trimester cases treated with IV artesunate was available from 4 
publications. Overall, these data point to a benefit in terms of maternal and fetal survival when IV 
artesunate is used to treat maternal severe falciparum malaria. 
Drug-drug interactions 
The in-vitro data were not generated in line with CHMP recommendations. Nevertheless, the 
conclusions reached based on the information available can be broadly supported. The clinical studies 
were not conducted in an adequate fashion to draw conclusions. The SmPC reflects the uncertainties.

Pharmacodynamics 
Antimalarial activity of the artemisinins 
The artemisinin compounds have a common and reasonably well understood mechanism of action that 
results in rapid parasiticidal activity against asexual ring stage parasites. When used orally, the 
artemisinins have been paired with a range of antimalarial agents that have a different mechanism of 
action. Wen treatment is commenced with IV artesunate as monotherapy, complete cure depends also 
on appropriate follow-on treatment once oral treatment is possible.  
Most published data on in-vitro activity indicate that all the artemisinins have some antimalarial 
activity. All are converted to DHA after oral or parenteral administration and most studies report that 
DHA is more active in vitro compared to the parent molecules. In contrast, data reported from US 
Army studies for two strains (W2 and D6 clones of P. falciparum) suggest comparable activity between 
parent and metabolite using assay two methods. It is unclear if this finding could be related to some 
degree of conversion of artesunate to DHA during the long incubation period of the assays. 
Nevertheless, since artesunate is converted to DHA very rapidly after oral or parenteral administration, 
clinical efficacy is thought to be driven primarily by the metabolite. 
Resistance 
The applicant provided a summary of what is known about the mechanisms of resistance to the 
artemisinins and presented an overview of the geographical distribution of clinical resistance, as 
assessed by delayed parasite clearance. As summarised in the dossier, the risk of acquiring 
artemisinin-resistant malaria is highest in pockets of SE Asia and lowest in Africa.     
PK-PD relationship 
Several of the published efficacy studies described in the applicant’s summaries in which artesunate 
(variable source; oral or IV) has been used to treat severe malaria have reported on PK-PD 
relationships. With few exceptions, the conclusion has been that there is no consistent relationship 
between plasma artesunate, DHA or the two combined and efficacy parameters (such as PCT). Given 
that the artemisinins concentrate in infected erythrocytes, the lack of a clear PK-PD relationship based 
on plasma drug concentrations is not a surprise.  
Cardiac conduction 
Severe malaria per se has been reported to disrupt cardiac conduction, including prolongation of the 
QTc interval that resolves in line with patient recovery from the infection. Furthermore, several 
antimalarial agents in widespread use are known to prolong the QTc interval. Data obtained with 
Eurartesim (as detailed in the EPAR) showed that DHA did not have a significant effect on the QTc 
interval. The applicant did not conduct a TQT study with Artesunate Amivas but did obtain multiple 
ECGs in the SAD and MAD studies in healthy subjects and did not detect a potentially clinically 
important effect on cardiac conduction. There is no need for any cautionary statements in the SmPC. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There are no outstanding issues on the clinical pharmacology to be addressed.  Salient points of the 
clinical pharmacology are reflected in SmPC Section 5.1.

2.6.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The demonstration of efficacy of IV artesunate is based on two prospective, randomised, controlled 
trials (RCTs) conducted between 2003 and 2010 by academic consortia of investigators, coordinated 
from the Mahidol University Bangkok and funded by the Wellcome Trust: 
o 
The  South  East  Asian  Quinine  Artesunate  Malaria  Trial  -  SEAQUAMAT  -  conducted  between  2003 
and 2005 in adults (mostly) and children with severe falciparum malaria admitted to hospitals in 
Asia and SE Asia (Lancet 2005; 366: 717-25). 
o 
The African Quinine Artesunate Malaria  Trial  -  AQUAMAT  -  conducted between  2005  and 2010 in 
children with severe falciparum malaria admitted to hospitals in Africa (Lancet 2010; 376: 1647-
57). 
SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT used intravenous artesunate manufactured in Guilin, China.  
Dose-finding or other supplementary information comes from six other studies. Four of these studies 
used the US Army artesunate but two of the four enrolled patients with uncomplicated malaria.

2.6.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Study 1263 – US Army 2007  
This open-label study in Thailand and Kenya randomised 100 adult and paediatric patients with 
uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria to one of four IV artesunate dose regimens:  
o  1.2 mg/kg once daily for 3 days;  
o  2.4 mg/kg once daily for 3 days;  
o  2.4 mg/kg at 0, 12, 24 and 48 h;  
o  4.8 mg/kg once daily for 3 days.  
All patients received follow-on therapy with mefloquine in Thailand and with Malarone in Kenya.

Of 100 subjects, 67% were black (Kenyan) and 37% were Asian (Thai). The majority was male (67%) 
and under the age of 18 (59%), with an overall age range from 5-53 years. All patients achieved the 
primary endpoint of 90% parasite clearance by 32 h and all but one had 100% clearance by 72 h.  
Table 15: Summary of parasite Clearance Times and Parasite Reduction Ratios for the 
Evaluable Population 
There was a significant difference in PCT90 between the 4.8 mg/kg once daily for 3 days dose cohort 
and the 2.4 mg/kg twice on Day 0 and once daily for 2 days cohort. The parasite clearance times for 
99% clearance and the difference in parasite reduction ratio at 12 h was also significantly different 
between these cohorts. The PRR at 24 h was significantly different between the 4.8 mg/kg once daily 
for 3 days dose cohort and the 1.2 mg/kg once daily for 3 days cohort. 
There was an apparent dose response in Kenyan subjects with the 4.8 mg/kg once daily for 3 days 
cohort clearing 99% of the parasites faster than the 1.2 or 2.4 mg/kg once daily for 3 days cohorts and 
clearing 100% of parasites faster than the 1.2 mg/kg group. Conversely, there was no dose response 
relationship in Thai subjects. 
There were no deaths in this study. 
The CSR concluded that the finding that PCT was significantly reduced in the 4.8 mg/kg once daily for 
3 days cohort compared to the 2.4 mg/kg twice on Day 0 and daily for 2 days could be due to the 
existence of artemisinin resistant parasites in Thailand. In contrast, Kenya was (at the time) relatively 
artemisinin-naïve and no artemisinin resistant malaria parasites had been described.  
EDCTP/MMV07-01 – MMV-sponsored study in African children with severe malaria (Kremsner, 2012)  
This was a randomised study in African children aged 6 months to 10 years (weight ≥ 5 kg) with ≥ 
5,000 parasites/µL on initial blood smear. The study compared two dose regimens as follows: 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 53/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Group A (n=94) received IV artesunate 2.4 mg/kg at 0, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h (5-dose cohort); 
Group B (n=100) received IV artesunate 4.0 mg/kg at 0, 24 and 48 h (3-dose cohort) with matching 
placebo (saline) given at 12 and 72 h. At Lambarene and Libreville in Gabon the follow-on oral anti-
malarial drug was Fansidar. At Blantyre in Malawi the oral antimalarial drug was Riamet 
(artemether/lumefantrine).  
The primary efficacy endpoint was the proportion of patients with parasite clearance (≥99% reduction 
from the baseline asexual parasite count; PC99) at 24 h after initiation of study drug. The primary 
efficacy analysis was performed on the ITT population and repeated on the PP population.  
All patients were African with an average age of 3.6 years in group A and 3.9 years in group B. The 
baseline asexual parasite counts were not significantly different between treatment groups. About 40% 
were considered to have hyperparasitaemia. 
In the primary analysis in the ITT and PP populations, there was no significant difference between 
treatment groups but there was a numerical advantage for the 5-dose regimen. Post-hoc testing for 
non-inferiority (B vs. A) showed that the lower bounds of the 95% CI for PC99 were within -20%.   
Table 16: Description and test for proportion of patients with PC99 from the baseline asexual 
parasite count at 24h per treatment groups (ITT population) 
Table 17: Description and test for proportion of patients with PC99 from the baseline asexual 
parasite count at 24h per treatment groups - PP 
The median time to PC100 was 36 h with no statistically significant difference between the survival 
curves (p=0.902). When looked at by age sub-class, 51% aged 0.5-2 years, 51.6% 2-3 years, 60.3% 
3-5 years and 43% ≥5 years reached PC100 36 h after the first dose of the study drug. The median 
times to PC99, PC90 and PC50 were not statistically significant different between groups. The percent 
reduction in asexual parasite count at 24 h was slightly higher in group A (99.2%) vs. group B (97.6%) 
(p=0.544). At 48 h the rates were 100% vs. 98.8% (p=0.610).  
The median fever clearance time was 12h for both groups (p=0.627). More than 57% aged 0.5-2, 2-3 
and 3-5 years reached fever clearance within 12 h after the first dose and more than 40% aged 3-5 
years and ≥5 years reached fever clearance within 6 h.

2.6.5.2.  Main studies 
Artesunate versus quinine for treatment of severe falciparum malaria: a randomised trial 
South East Asian Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial (SEAQUAMAT) group 
Artesunate versus quinine in the treatment of severe falciparum malaria in African children 
(AQUAMAT): an open-label, randomised trial 
Methods 
In SEAQUAMAT, eligible patients were aged at least 2 years with a positive blood antigen test for 
Plasmodium falciparum (HRP2; Paracheck, Orchid Biosystems, Goa, India) and a diagnosis of severe 
malaria according to the admitting physician. Slides were read retrospectively in the reference 
laboratories in Thailand. 
In AQUAMAT, eligible patients were aged < 15 years with a positive rapid diagnostic test for 
Plasmodium falciparum LDH (Optimal, Diamed, Cressier, Switzerland) and severe malaria in the 
admitting physician’s clinical opinion.   
Treatment 
Artesunate 2.4 mg/kg bodyweight (Guilin) was given on admission, at 12 h and 24 h and then once 
daily until oral medication could be taken. Administration was IV (both studies) or by IM injection into 
the anterior thigh (an alternative in AQUAMAT only).  
In SEAQUAMAT, IV artesunate was followed by oral artesunate 2 mg salt per kg per day to complete a 
total course (including parenteral treatment) of 7 days. Both regimens were combined with oral 
doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 7 days once the patient could take oral medication with the 
exception of i) children aged < 8 years; ii) pregnant women; iii) Chittagong and Orissa. In AQUAMAT, 
after a minimum of 24 h of parenteral treatment, oral Coartem (artemether-lumefantrine) was given at 
1.5/9 mg/kg twice daily for 3 days with milk or fat.  
In both studies, quinine dihydrochloride was given parenterally in a 20 mg/kg loading dose followed by 
10 mg/kg three times a day until starting oral quinine 10 mg/kg every 8 h to provide a total of 7 days.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
In both studies, the primary endpoint was death from severe malaria, defined as all-cause in-hospital 
mortality measured to time of hospital discharge. Secondary endpoints were incidence of neurological 
sequelae, combined death or neurological sequelae, other significant sequelae (unspecified), recovery 
times (times to eat, speak, sit and discharge), time to death and development of severe complications 
not present on admission. 
Sample size 
In SEAQUAMAT, the initial plan was to include 2000 patients with severe malaria to be able to show a 
33% reduction in mortality from 12% to 8% with a power of 80% and a confidence of 95%, allowing a 
drop out (ineligibility) rate of 5%. This estimate was based on about half of the enrolled patients 
subsequently fulfilling modified WHO criteria for severe malaria and an anticipated 24% mortality rate 
from severe malaria based on local figures.  
In AQUAMAT, 5306 children with severe malaria were needed to show, with 80% power and 95% 
confidence, a 25% reduction in mortality from 8% to 6%. This was based on 16% mortality in severe 
malaria with about half the enrolled patients anticipated to fulfil the criteria for severe malaria. 
Randomisation 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021

This was done in both studies using sealed envelopes containing unique study numbers that referred to 
sealed boxes containing the study drug, case record form and all disposables needed for drug 
administration and blood sampling. 
Blinding (masking) 
Both studies were open label with respect to the investigators and persons who administered 
treatment. Persons conducting microscopy of blood slides and data analysts remained unaware of 
treatment allocation until the end of the study. 
Statistical methods 
SEAQUAMAT 
There was a pre-specified analytical plan. A revised final SAP was generated to support the US Army 
analyses. The primary analysis was conducted in the ITT population, defined as all randomised 
patients. An analysis of the primary endpoint was also conducted in the PP population, comprising 
patients confirmed to have P. falciparum from the peripheral blood smear. Subgroup analyses were 
conducted in subsets defined by various demographic characteristics and according to severe malaria 
and less severe malaria groups, according to fulfilment of the criteria for severe malaria (a modification 
of definitions used by Hien and colleagues was applied).  
The primary endpoint was analysed as a binary variable with a two-tailed test with alpha=0.05. The 
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) procedure was used to compare mortality rates between the 
treatment groups, stratifying by study site. Odds ratio and relative risk point estimates and associated 
95% confidence intervals were reported for the primary endpoint. 
According to the protocol, an interim analysis was to be evaluated by an external data safety 
monitoring committee (DSMC) after inclusion of 500 patients and at other time points chosen by the 
committee. There was no formal pre-specified plan to control the type 1 error. The DSMC’s remit 
included advising to stop the trial if there was evidence beyond reasonable doubt that the results 
would change clinical practice. The trial was stopped on May 11, 2005 following a second interim 
analysis.  
AQUAMAT 
The approach was similar to that for SEAQUAMAT but the criteria for defining severe falciparum 
malaria were not identical between studies. 
Results – SEAQUAMAT 
The first interim analysis was conducted in June 2004 after inclusion of 659 patients (129 deaths). A 
second interim analysis was conducted using an analysis database that was frozen in February 2005. 
There were 244 reported deaths for the 1294 patients included in the database. The number of 
accrued deaths exceeded the number of deaths projected for a completed trial. The DSMC 
recommended stopping the trial based upon the strength and robustness of the efficacy findings and 
supporting safety results. After the trial was halted, unblinded analysis results prepared by the 
SEAQUAMAT group were published based on data for 1461 patients (271 deaths), of which 79 (5%) 
did not have falciparum malaria confirmed by the presence of parasites on the blood smear.  
Baseline data 
Severe falciparum malaria was confirmed for 70% artesunate and 74% quinine group patients.

Mortality 
Only in-hospital mortality was considered as the primary endpoint. One patient was discharged to die 
at home and this patient was excluded from the primary analysis. In the ITT population, mortality was 
14.7% in the artesunate group compared with 22.4% in the quinine group (relative risk 0.67, 95% CI 
0.54–0.83; odds ratio 0.60, 95% CI 0.45-0.79). The analysis of mortality in smear positive cases gave 
similar findings (relative risk 0.69, 0.55–0.85; odds ratio 0.62; 95% CI 0.47-0.82). The Breslow-Day 
(BD) test of homogeneity across the strata was not significant (p=0.340).

Patients either died in hospital or were discharged well, so all deaths included. To construct plot survival time of all discharged 
patients was set to 35 days. 
Figure 10: Survival curve of in-hospital mortality 
The hospital death rate on day 0 was 3.2% and 4.0% for artesunate and quinine groups, respectively.  
Rates on day 1 were 5.2% and 6.3%, respectively, after which rates diverged (2.7% vs. 4.7% on day 
2, 1.2% vs. 3.4% on day 3 and 1.0% vs. 3.4% on days 4-6. The proportions discharged alive were 
85.3% for the artesunate group and 77.6% for the quinine group. 
In the severe malaria (SM) subgroup, the mortality rate was 19.8% in artesunate patients compared to 
28.1% in quinine patients. The relative risk ratio from the stratified CMH analysis was 0.73 with 95% 
confidence interval (0.59, 0.90). The odds ratio estimate (95% confidence interval) from the analysis 
was 0.64 (0.48, 0.87). The stratified CMH analysis for the SM population was significant (p=0.0031) 
and the Breslow-Day result (p=0.122) did not demonstrate heterogeneity in the odds of mortality 
between the sites. Nine (3%) of the 332 smear-positive patients who did not fulfil the criteria for 
severe malaria on admission died compared to 24% (253/1050) of patients who fulfilled the criteria for 
severe malaria.  
There were 17 patients in the artesunate group and 21 in the quinine group aged 65+ years. The 
numbers in the individual age groups 65 years and older were small, but 12/17 (70.6%) patients in the 
artesunate group and 12/21 (57.1%) patients in the quinine group survived. 
There were 202 subjects aged <15 years in the study of whom 89 were <6 years. The overall mortality 
in children was 8% (16/202) with no significant difference between treatments.   
Overall mortality varied significantly between countries (from 9.3% in Indonesia to 28% in 
Bangladesh), but there was no significant heterogeneity in treatment effect.

Other endpoints 
Ten patients were discharged from hospital with residual neurological sequelae, seven in the 
artesunate group and three in the quinine group (p=0.23). Five had psychiatric sequelae, four had 
persisting problems with balance (one with psychiatric sequelae and a tremor) and two had a 
hemiparesis. Combining deaths and neurological sequelae, there were 114 (15.6%) adverse outcomes 
in the artesunate group and 167 (22.8%) in the quinine group (relative risk 0.68, 0.55–0.85). 
Table 21: Summary of Significant Sequelae and Mortality – ITT Population 
The incidence of any significant sequelae was 5.9% vs. 4.1% for the artesunate and quinine groups 
respectively (p=0.1171), yielding a relative risk ratio (artesunate/quinine) of 1.44 with 95% 
confidence interval (0.91, 2.26).

The incidence of any sequelae was higher in the artesunate group than in the quinine group among SM 
patients (7.1% vs. 3.7%) but lower in the non-SM subgroup (3.2% vs. 5.3%).  
Table 22: Summary of Significant Sequelae and Mortality by Severe Malaria on Admission 
Status – ITT Population 
Among those who survived, there were no significant differences between the treatment groups for 
times to eat or sit or to hospital discharge. 
The pregnancy outcome for 23 artesunate and 26 quinine patients with data included 6 (26.1%) 
artesunate and 8 (30.8%) quinine group cases of foetal death while 5 in each group had an abortion. 
The treatment effect was as good in patients who had received effective antimalarial treatment before 
admission as in those who had not (ratio of ORs 0.6, 95% CI 0.3–1.21). Pre-treatment included 
quinine in 187 patients, an artemisinin derivative in 67, chloroquine in 64 and sulphadoxine-
pyrimethamine in 19 (some patients received more than one drug). Post-hoc (not pre-specified) 
analyses of pre-treatment drug subgroups revealed no significant patterns with respect to the 
treatment effect. 
Patients with hyperparasitaemia (admission parasitaemia ≥10%) had a significantly greater treatment 
effect with artesunate than non-hyperparasitaemic patients (ratio of ORs 0.34, 0.17–0.69, p=0.001). 
There was a significant excess of hypoglycaemia after study entry in the quinine group compared with 
the artesunate group (RR 3.2, 95% CI 1.3–7.9). Such a trend was seen in SM and non-SM subgroups. 
In contrast, there were no differences between the study groups in the incidence of haemodynamic 
shock, convulsions and blackwater fever or in the use of supportive therapies (mechanical ventilation, 
vasopressor support and dialysis).

Results - AQUAMAT  
There were 5425 patients enrolled and included in the ITT population. Most of the patients not eligible 
for the PP population had negative or missing blood smears. 
Baseline data 
There were no major differences in baseline data between randomised treatment groups in terms of 
demographics or clinical status at study baseline. With a mean age of ~3 years, the youngest patients 
were >18 months old.

Mortality 
Of the total 5425 patients recruited, 527 (9.7%) died. Death rates were 230/2712 (8.5%) in the 
artesunate group vs. 297/2713 (10.9%) in the quinine group (relative risk 0.78, 95% CI 0.66–0.91; 
odds ratio 0.75, 95% CI 0.63–0.90, in favour of artesunate; p=0.0022). This represents a relative 
reduction in mortality of 22.5% (95% CI 8.1–36.9%). There was no heterogeneity between study sites 
(p=0.99). The per-protocol analysis (excluding those who died before receiving study treatment, those 
with incomplete initial antimalarial treatment with the study or with negative or missing blood slides for 
P falciparum) gave a very similar result to the ITT population. 
The survival analysis for overall mortality during admission by antimalarial treatment gave the same 
result as the Mantel-Haenszel analysis (HR stratified by study site 0.76, 95% CI 0.64–0.91; 
p=0.0022). Mantel-Haenszel analysis of the predefined subgroups showed no evidence of any 
differences in odds ratios between subgroups and these results were confirmed by Cox regression. 
The endpoint review committee identified 16 children (7 artesunate, 9 quinine) in whom death was 
unlikely to be related to severe malaria. Omission of these cases from the analysis had no effect on the 
magnitude of the survival benefit with artesunate.  
There was a benefit for artesunate on mortality among children meeting criteria for severe malaria.  
HIV serology was assessed routinely in Beira, Muheza and Kilifi. Of 2095 patients tested, 125 (6%) 
were positive (64 artesunate, 61 quinine) and mortality in these patients was high regardless of 
treatment group.

Other endpoints 
The development of coma, deterioration in coma score and convulsions all occurred more frequently in 
patients who received quinine than in those who received artesunate. 
In cerebral malaria survivors, the time from randomisation until the child was able to localise a painful 
stimulus or was able to speak was slightly longer overall in patients treated with artesunate than in 
those given quinine when compared by survival analysis. 
In the 4898 survivors, 170 (99 artesunate, 71 quinine) had not yet made full neurological recoveries at 
the time of hospital discharge. Of these 170 patients, 129 (76 artesunate, 53 quinine) were followed 
up between 3 and 8 weeks after enrolment at which time 68 (53%) had recovered fully, 18 (14%; 11 
artesunate, 7 quinine) were mildly or moderately impaired and 43 (33%; 20 quinine, 23 artesunate) 
had severe neurological deficits.

The overall rate of persistent neurological sequelae in survivors assessed at 28 days after cerebral 
malaria was 3.2% (24/706 artesunate, 23/737 quinine) and the rate for severe neurological sequelae 
was 2.3% (17/706 artesunate, 17/737 quinine).  
Of the 14 patients with any neurological sequelae who did not have cerebral malaria initially (10 
artesunate, 4 quinine), 7 had multiple convulsions (3 quinine, 4 artesunate) and all had severe 
prostration on admission. 
*Some patients had severe impairment in more than one domain.

2.6.5.3.  Supportive studies 
R-CDC-060 – US Army 2007-2011  
This was a retrospective analysis of US patients who received intravenous artesunate Amivas for initial 
treatment of severe malaria under the US CDC IND. It was expected that the majority would have 
malaria due to P. falciparum but those with undetermined species or species other than falciparum 
were also eligible. Eligible patients had to meet at least one criterion in each of groups A, B and C: 
Criteria A malaria confirmed by microscopy 
Criteria B need for IV treatment 
Criteria C need for IV artesunate 
The initial dose regimen was 2.4 mg/kg at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h for a total of 4 doses. The choice of 
an appropriate follow-on oral antimalarial drug was at the discretion of the treating physician. After 3 
days of treatment with IV artesunate, if the subject still could not tolerate oral medications, the 
potential options included: 1) to continue the IV artesunate, not to exceed a total course of 7 days; or 
2) to switch to treatment with IV doxycycline (7 days) or IV clindamycin (7 days). 
The primary outcome was safety. The secondary clinical benefit outcomes included efficacy endpoints. 
Of the 104 patients who received IV artesunate, appropriate consent forms had not been signed in two 
cases, leaving a safety population of 102 patients of which 93 (91%) completed IVAS treatment.  
Of the 102 patients, the majority (61%) was male, 63% were Black/African American and the mean 
age was 38.1 years (range 1 to 72 years) with 10/102 aged <15 years, including 4 aged 1-3 years. 
Three patients were pregnant.  
There were 87 patients in the evaluable population and 74 in the PP population. Prior exposure to 
quinidine was reported for 47/102 (46%) in the safety analysis population and 43/87 (49%) in the 
evaluable analysis population.

Of 87 patients in the evaluable population, 39 (45%) were able to switch to follow-on oral therapy but 
38/87 (including 4 deaths) were excluded from the analysis because they received concomitant IV 
antimalarial medications during treatment with IV artesunate. Of the 10 who did not switch, 8 could 
not take oral medication, one died and one had no reason recorded. 
Seven of the 102 patients died, including 5 who died before completing 4 IV artesunate doses. One 
other patient died after the data abstraction period. All deaths were considered due to the severity of 
malaria. Five of the 7 had P. falciparum with baseline hyperparasitaemia from 12% to 90% and one 
patient had P. vivax. All showed significant baseline neurological deterioration (seizures, impaired 
consciousness, ventilator support) and moderate or severe hepatic injury as assessed by MELD score. 
Three of the 7 who died had brain oedema or brainstem herniation. The only two patients in the safety 
population who were aged >70 years both died and one other death was in a patient aged >60 years. 
One of two patients in the study with HIV died as did 2/11 with diabetes. The three pregnant women 
treated all survived.  
The median time to negative parasitology was 49.6 h in the safety population, 42.7 h in the evaluable 
population and 42.7 h in the per protocol population. There were no statistically significant differences 
in the time to negative parasitology between those with and without severely impaired renal or hepatic 
function at baseline. Those with severe clinical/neurological deterioration at baseline (seizures, 
impaired consciousness, ventilator support) did not have a statistically significant longer time to 
negative parasitology vs. those without baseline deterioration.

Table 27: Kaplan-Meier Analysis of Time to Negative Parasitology by Analysis Population 
In the evaluable analysis population (n=87), patients who received concurrent antimalarial treatments 
(n=38) during IV artesunate administration did not show a statistically significant difference in time to 
negative parasitology compared with the 49 who did not but there was a numerical difference (43 h vs. 
51 h, respectively; p=0.942). Administration of a concomitant antimalarial agent did not improve the 
negative parasitology rates or ICU discharge rates. Patients exposed to quinidine (n=43) before or 
during IV artesunate did not show a statistically significant difference in time to negative parasitology 
compared with 44 without quinidine exposure (41 h vs. 50 h, respectively; p=0.608). 
In the evaluable analysis population, 39/49 (80%) transitioned to oral antimalarial therapy within the 
abstraction period with a mean time to initiation of 3.8 days (range 2 to 5 days). Baseline severe renal 
or hepatic impairment or neurological deterioration did not significantly affect median time to starting 
follow-on oral antimalarial therapy. There was a borderline statistically significant (p=0.050) difference 
between those not exposed (3 days) vs. exposed to quinidine (4 days) before or during IV artesunate 
therapy but in the PP population the median was 4 days in both subgroups. 
Cao et al., 1997  
In this open, randomised study, Vietnamese children (n=109) aged from 3 months to 14 years with 
severe P. falciparum malaria received one of the following:

Artesunate suppositories (n=37), (40 mg/kg initially and 20 mg/kg at 4, 24, 48 and 72 h) 
followed by oral mefloquine (15 mg/kg) at 96 h;  
Artesunate intramuscular (Guilin; 3 mg/kg initially and 2 mg/kg at 12, 24, 48 and 72 h) followed 
by oral mefloquine (15 mg/kg) at 96 h;  
o  Quinine dihydrochloride (20 mg salt/kg in 5% glucose IV infusion over 4 h, followed by 10 mg/kg 
every 8 h for 7 days) followed by a single dose of pyrimethamine/sulfadoxine (Fansidar) on day 7. 
On admission, 24 children (22%) had cerebral malaria, 64 (59%) were jaundiced and 14 (13%) had 
visible haemoglobinuria. Overall, 11 patients (10%) died, most of them from multi-organ failure. One 
in the quinine group died before the first dose. There was no statistically significant difference in 
mortality rates among the treatment groups.  
Table 28: Outcome of Vietnamese children with severe malaria 
PCTs and FCTs were shorter in the groups that received an artemisinin. Four patients in the quinine 
group had RI1 resistance (persistence of parasites). No patient in the artemisinin or artesunate groups 
failed to clear parasites within 7 days of commencing treatment. 
COCHRANE Meta-analysis (Sinclair 2012)  
This meta-analysis was conducted over a 10-year period (1992-2012). The authors found 31 clinical 
trials of intravenous or intramuscular artesunate for treatment for severe or complicated malaria from 
which they selected 8 that were prospective randomised trials. Six trials were conducted in Asia (Cao 
et al. 1997; Dondorp et al. 2005 [SEAQUAMAT]; Hien et al. 1992; Newton et al. 2003; Sinclair et al. 
2012) and two were in Africa (Dondorp-2010 [AQUAMAT]; Eltahir-2010).  
In the 8 randomised and controlled trials, 1664 adults and 5765 children were enrolled to receive 
parenteral artesunate or parenteral quinine.

Overall, there was a reduced mortality in adults from severe malaria of about 40% (RR, 0.61; 95% CI, 
0.50-0.75) and a reduced mortality in children of about 25% (RR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.65-0.90). There 
was a small increase in neurologic sequelae in children treated with artesunate at the time of hospital 
discharge, most of which, however, slowly resolved with little or no difference between artesunate and 
quinine 28 days later.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
GCP 
The applicant considers that three studies in the dossier are pivotal, all of which met the ethical 
requirements of Directive 2001/20/EC but they were not conducted fully in accordance with GCP. 
SEAQUAMAT (comparative using Guilin artesunate)  
The sponsor (Wellcome Trust) provided the clinical protocol, blank case report forms and a legacy data 
file with subject level data, which allowed the applicant to construct a clinical study report (CSR) plus 
subject level data and listings. It was not possible to employ traditional GCP inspection methods for the 
sites during the trial and the sponsor was unwilling to give permission for a study audit by the US 
Army or any subsequent Regulatory Authority. 
AQUAMAT (comparative using Guilin artesunate) 
The study was sponsored by the Wellcome Trust and co-ordinated by the Mahidol-Oxford Tropical 
Medicine Research Unit in Bangkok, which provided logistic support and data management. The data 
from this study are available only in the 2010 publication. It was not possible to employ traditional GCP 
inspection methods for the duration of the trial. The sponsor denied requests for further patient level 
data, the data sets, the FSCR and permission to audit the AQUAMAT study. 
R-CDC-060 (non-comparative, retrospective; used US Army artesunate) 
The data presented in the CSR were compiled by the Department of the Army, in collaboration with the 
CDC. The principles of GCP were followed to the extent possible in both trial conduct and 
documentation procedures. The final CSR is not fully compliant with GCP due to the nature of the study 
and various methods of data collection across the sites involved. 
Of the other studies in the dossier, four were conducted by the US Army – two PK studies and two 
efficacy studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria. Whilst these are not pivotal, the applicant 
explained that there were audits of 1128 and 1142 by a US-based CRO.   
In summary, it is not possible to verify the degree of GCP compliance of SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT 
either retrospectively or by instituting GCP inspections. CDC-060 was conducted under CDC’s IND but 
the degree of GCP compliance at all the sites that treated patients with IV artesunate cannot be 
verified. 
Pivotal randomised controlled studies - SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT 
These were both prospective, randomised trials that compared initial treatment with parenteral 
artesunate with widely recommended and well-established comparative regimens for treatment of 
severe P. falciparum malaria. Taken together, the two trials cover a wide age range. In general, the 
main features of the design of these studies seem to have been appropriate. 
The open label design of these studies was due to the practical difficulties contingent on a double 
dummy approach, including the fact that in SEAQUAMAT the blind would have to encompass the 
different oral follow-on regimens (see below). Since the focus of the clinical comparison was on in-
hospital mortality, the open label design does not threaten the conclusions on efficacy.    
Both studies used the same parenteral artesunate regimen, with 2 doses of 2.4 mg/kg given at 0 and 
12 h and then once daily dosing until oral medication was possible. Both studies also used the same 
initial comparative regimen, with a 20 mg/kg loading dose of quinine followed by 10 mg/kg q8h until 
oral treatment was possible. However, while AQUAMAT required that 24 h parenteral treatment was 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 74/110 
 
 
 
 
 
given before an oral switch, there does not seem to have been a minimum duration of parenteral 
treatment required in SEAQUAMAT although the applicant’s CSR reports that the mean number of 
doses of artesunate was 3.9.  
It appears that SEAQUAMAT (based on the protocol from 2003 and the applicant’s CSR but not 
mentioned in the publication) and AQUAMAT (mentioned in the publication) allowed IM as an 
alternative to IV administration of the initial parenteral treatment. However, it appears that no patients 
received IM dosing in SEAQUAMAT and only ~10% were dosed IM in AQUAMAT. The SmPC 
recommends only IV dosing, which is acceptable and appropriate. 
There is an important difference between the two studies in terms of oral follow-on treatment. In 
SEAQUAMAT, parenteral artesunate was followed by oral artesunate and parenteral quinine was 
followed by oral quinine, both given with oral doxycycline unless this was contraindicated. The 
contribution of the oral follow-on regimens to the overall in-hospital mortality rates and to the other 
clinical endpoints cannot be determined in this study design. Furthermore, there was no on-treatment 
serial parasite counting conducted, which means that the initial impact of the two parenteral 
treatments on parasite density cannot be compared.  
In contrast, all patients in AQUAMAT followed initial parenteral treatment with a full course or oral 
artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem). Coartem is highly effective for the de novo treatment of 
uncomplicated malaria and use of the same follow-on regimen in both treatment arms could be 
expected, if anything, to reduce the differences observed between randomised groups in terms of 
outcomes measured after oral switch. Therefore, any differences detected between the two randomised 
treatment arms likely reflect the impact on the initial parenteral treatment.  
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was in-hospital all-cause mortality, which was thought to 
reflect death rates from the presenting episodes of severe malaria. This primary endpoint is 
acceptable. Based on this primary endpoint, both studies were planned with sample sizes to provide 
80% power to show a reduction in mortality for initial parenteral treatment with artesunate vs. 
quinine. The estimated mortality rates reflected recent data relevant to the populations enrolled.   
Randomisation was based on opening of sealed envelopes at study sites. This is not at all ideal but, 
given the timing of the studies and the distribution of sites, it likely reflects the only practical means 
available. 
In both studies, the primary analysis was conducted in the ITT (all randomised) population and also in 
the PP population who had the rapid test for P. falciparum confirmed by finding asexual parasites in 
blood smears. Additional analyses were conducted in those who were determined retrospectively to 
meet the protocol-defined criteria for severe malaria and in other subgroups. 
Studies with Artesunate Amivas 
Dose and regimen - 1263 and EDCTP-MMV07-01 
Study 1263 was conducted in 100 adults and children (actual age range 5-53 years) with 
uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.  
There was no active control arm but it compared four IV artesunate dose regimens in an open-label 
design. The results of effects on parasite load up to 48 h after the first dose allow for an assessment of 
the impact of the IV artesunate regimens.  
EDTCP-MMV07-01 was conducted by the Medicines for Malaria Venture in children 6 months-10 years 
with severe malaria regardless of species. There was no active control arm but it compared 5 doses of 
2.4 mg/kg within 72 h with 3 doses of 4 mg/kg within 48 h in a double blind design. The primary 
endpoint was the rate of 99% parasite clearance (PC99) at 24 h after the first dose (i.e. after 2 doses 
of 2.4 mg/kg or after 1 dose of 4 mg/kg).  
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 75/110 
 
 
 
 
 
1168 
This uncontrolled 2006 study in adults with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria evaluated 3 doses of 
IV artesunate 2.4 mg/kg q24h for initial treatment, followed by oral Malarone. Since the recommended 
regimen for severe malaria is to give 2 doses in the first 24 h and then daily doses, the data on initial 
effects on parasite counts are of interest.  
CDC060 
While this was a retrospective uncontrolled study, it provides some data on the use of the 
recommended IV artesunate dose regimen for initial treatment of malaria. The intent was to limit IV 
treatment to 4 doses of 2.4 mg/kg at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h but extension of parenteral treatment 
was allowed if patients were unable to switch to one of the oral regimens as recommended by CDC. 
Not all patients entering this study necessarily had severe malaria and infections were not confined to 
P. falciparum. While the primary endpoint was safety, the study captured effects on treatment on 
parasite counts as well as the clinical outcomes. 
Since this study was conducted in returning travellers, the importance for the application is that it 
describes outcomes in persons not likely to have any or, at least, any substantial pre-existing naturally 
acquired immunity to malaria.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Pivotal randomised controlled studies 
SEAQUAMAT 
The great majority of the 1461 randomised patients (~95%) had P. falciparum confirmed by 
microscopy of blood smears and adults accounted for 1269/1461 patients. Therefore, the analysis of 
efficacy in the ITT population essentially reflects adults with complicated malaria, i.e. using the term 
complicated to refer to the need for initial parenteral treatment. The analysis of efficacy in the PP 
population essentially reflects adults with complicated P. falciparum malaria. Nevertheless, the 
indication sought is treatment of severe malaria and only about 70% of the ITT population met at least 
one of the criteria for severe malaria. 
The second interim analysis, which assessed efficacy based on data up to February 2005 and which led 
to stopping the study in May 2005, included 1294 subjects (~70% had severe malaria), which was 
about half of the initial planned sample size of patients with confirmed severe malaria. In contrast, the 
number of deaths (244) in this total population was higher than had been projected initially at the time 
of trial completion. The applicant’s CSR mentions that the p-value derived from the second interim 
analysis was 0.0007 and that the test statistic would have crossed the stopping boundary had either 
the O’Brien-Fleming or the Haybittle-Peto procedure been applied.  
In contrast, the publication of this study describes results for the 1461 patients enrolled when the 
study was stopped, including 271 deaths. The applicant’s CSR is based on re-analyses of data from the 
total 1461 patients. The applicant states that the treatment effect estimate obtained from this later 
database was less than that observed in the interim analysis that led to stopping the study but the 
details of the second interim analysis were not published and are not available to the applicant.  
In the ITT and PP populations, the in-hospital death rates were statistically significantly lower in the 
artesunate group, with an absolute difference between groups of 7-8 percentage points. Both analyses 
indicated that the relative risk of dying in the artesunate group was about 2/3 of that in the quinine 
group with upper bounds of the 95% confidence intervals that did not exceed 0.82. With so few 
patients having neurological sequelae, the comparison of the combined death and sequelae rates was 
driven by the death rates.  
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 76/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The benefit of parenteral artesunate on risk of mortality was evident within the first 24 h of starting 
treatment although most of the treatment effect reflected reduction in mortality after the first 24-48 h 
on study. This finding is important since, in this study, the two treatment groups had separate oral 
follow-on regimens (i.e. artesunate or quinine as per initial assignment), which would have contributed 
to the overall survival and clinical response rates.   
Severe malaria was confirmed for 509 (70%) in the artesunate group and 541 (74%) in the quinine 
group. The mortality rates in those with severe disease were 19.8% with artesunate compared to 
28.1% with quinine, which again showed a statistically significant benefit.  
The mortality rates varied significantly between countries (from 9.3% in Indonesia to 28% in 
Bangladesh), which the publication mentions may have reflected availability of intensive care. 
Nevertheless, the absolute risk reduction in each country associated with artesunate vs. quinine 
treatment was in the range from 5-9 percentage points.   
AQUAMAT 
The final study population was more homogeneous than that in SEAQUAMAT, being confined to African 
children aged from 18 months to <5 years. Although about one third had received potentially effective 
antimalarial treatment for the presenting episode, the condition of the children at study baseline 
indicates that the treatment was not controlling the disease. There were no important differences 
between treatment groups in baseline host or disease characteristics. Thus, as in SEAQUAMAT, it 
appears that the method of randomisation was adequate. As expected, the mean and range of baseline 
parasitaemia was even higher in these children compared to the population enrolled into SEAQUAMAT.  
The ITT population death rates in both treatment groups were lower compared to SEAQUAMAT, being 
8.5% vs. 10.9%, representing a statistically significant benefit for starting treatment with artesunate 
rather than quinine when each was followed by a complete and highly effective oral regimen with 
Coartem. A very similar result was obtained in the PP population with confirmed P. falciparum. 
Importantly, the mortality rates in the subset that met the pre-defined criteria for severe malaria, 
which comprised ~85% of the total 5425 randomised, were 9.9% for artesunate and 12.4% for 
quinine, which was a statistically significant difference (p=0.0055). Moreover, in contrast to 
SEAQUAMAT, the survival curves diverged from the time of the first dose onwards.        
As in SEAQUAMAT, on-treatment parasite counts were not determined. See the discussion of safety 
regarding neurological sequelae. 
Studies with Artesunate Amivas 
Dose and regimen - 1263 and EDCTP-MMV07-01 
In 1263 in uncomplicated falciparum malaria, all of the IV artesunate regimens resulted in PC90 by 32 
h. While the PCT90 was shorter with the 3x4.8 mg/kg dose vs. the 4x2.4 mg/kg, all except one patient 
had total clearance by 72 h. Although there seemed to be slightly slower clearance in Thailand vs. 
Kenya, the parasite reduction ratios were not statistically significantly different from 24 h onwards. 
Overall, 3 or 4 doses of 2.4 mg/kg in the first 48 h appeared to be highly effective and no patients died 
in this study. 
In children with severe malaria, the MMV study indicated a numerical advantage for the 4 mg/kg dose 
group based on the primary endpoint of PC99 at 24 h. However, the median time to PC100 was 36 h in 
both dose groups and there were only 6-h differences between regimens for the median times to PC90 
and PC99. Also, the median FCT was 12 h in both groups. Two patients in the 4 mg/kg group died. One 
died on day 2 for unknown reason and the other died on day 1 following a grand mal convulsion. It 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021

was concluded from the overall results and the age subgroup analyses that both regimens were 
suitable for the initial treatment of severe malaria in the age range studied.  
1168 
The mean baseline P. falciparum parasitaemia in the 30 adults with uncomplicated malaria was 23,484. 
The median was 5,938 and the range was from 405-270,515. The mean parasite reduction ratio at 48 
h for the 30 evaluable subjects was 99.998%, supporting the adequacy of initial treatment with 3 IV 
artesunate doses of 2.4 mg/kg at 24-h intervals in adults. 
CDC-060 
This study is not pivotal. The results must be viewed with much caution, not least due to the number 
and types of protocol deviations, including concomitant antimalarial agents during the IV treatment 
phase. Nevertheless, the baseline features indicate that a substantial proportion of the patients were 
severely unwell at the time of starting artesunate. This is underlined by the fact that 5 patients died 
before completing 4 doses of artesunate.  
While the applicant reports median times to negative parasitology for the safety, evaluable and PP 
populations (as defined in the CSR), with point estimates from 42-50 h, these numbers are based on 
populations that included those who received other antimalarial agents with IV artesunate. Thus, it 
should be noted that the 38/87 patients in the evaluable analysis population who received concurrent 
antimalarial treatments during IV artesunate administration did not show a statistically significant 
difference in time to negative parasitology compared with the 49/87 who received IV artesunate alone. 
However, there was a numerical difference (43 h vs. 51 h, respectively; p=0.942). In the 49 with no 
concomitant antimalarial agent during IV artesunate administration, 39/49 (80%) transitioned to oral 
antimalarial therapy with a mean time to initiation of 3.8 days (range 2 to 5 days).  
The intent of the labelling is that IV artesunate should be given alone until such time that a switch to 
an appropriate oral follow-on regimen is possible. To support this usage in returning travellers, the 
applicant compared all the efficacy endpoints for the subsets of the evaluable population (this being 
the population of most interest) that did (n=38) and did not (n=49) receive concomitant antimalarial 
agents during IV artesunate treatment. There was no evidence of a benefit for concomitant 
administration of another antimalarial agent with IV artesunate.  
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Efficacy in the initial treatment of severe malaria 
The two pivotal trials were conducted in populations that differed in age range and geographical 
distribution. Different approaches were taken to the oral follow-on treatment and only retrospectively 
defined subsets met the pre-defined criteria for severe malaria, these subsets being most relevant to 
the indication statement. Nevertheless, both studies gave results that support the proposed IV 
artesunate dose regimen for the initial treatment of severe P. falciparum malaria in children aged from 
~18 months, adolescents and adults.  
Inevitably, these studies were conducted in endemic areas where some degree of partial immunity to 
malaria is acquired as subjects get older. It is important that the AQUAMAT study was confined to 
children aged < 5 years with substantial parasite counts at baseline and in whom very limited naturally 
acquired immunity would be expected. In this study, in which all children received the same highly 
effective oral follow-on regimen, initial treatment with parenteral artesunate was more effective than 
initial treatment with parenteral quinine in terms of in-hospital mortality. In SEAQUAMAT, in which 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 78/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
most subjects were adults, parenteral followed by oral artesunate was more effective than parenteral 
followed by oral quinine in terms of in-hospital mortality. These studies support the efficacy of initial 
treatment of severe P. falciparum malaria with IV artesunate.  
The four efficacy studies that used the US Army artesunate had no active control arms. Two were 
confined to uncomplicated malaria (1263 and 1168), two compared different IV artesunate regimens 
(1163 and EDCTP-MMV07-01) and one was a retrospective collation of clinical cases (CDC-060). The 
most informative of these studies was not sponsored by the US Army but by MMV. This African study 
provided a direct comparison of 5 doses of 2.4 mg/kg with the first two doses given 12 h apart and 3 
doses of 4 mg/kg given 24 h apart. The effect on parasite counts supported use of either dose regimen 
in children aged 6 months to 10 years with severe P. falciparum malaria.    
The indication is not specific to P. falciparum malaria. Inevitably, almost all of the clinical data pertain 
to treatment of severe P. falciparum since this species is responsible for the vast majority of severe 
malaria cases. The in-vitro data support lack of speciation in the indication.   
The clinical trial efficacy data only support use from ~18 months and there is very limited published 
information on use in infants, reflecting the fact that severe malaria in the first 6 months of life is 
unusual. However, severe malaria does occur occasionally in this age group and it is possible that EU 
travellers could take very young infants to endemic regions to visit families. Therefore, there is no a 
priori objection to an indication from birth. Hence, it is agreed with the applicant that a single dose 
recommendation of 2.4 mg/kg may be applied regardless of age. There are no clinical safety and 
efficacy data that point to the need for a higher dose in children < 20 kg. The SmPC reflects the 
uncertainties, but for the life-threatening condition there is no known reason to preclude use below a 
certain age. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
There were 282 subjects/patients who received at least one dose of the US Army IV artesunate in 
Phase 1 (n=50), Phase 2 (n=130) or in CDC-060 up to 2010 (n=102). Overall, 117/282 (41.5%) had 
total IV artesunate exposure equivalent to the recommended regimen (2.4 mg/kg × 4 doses or total 
exposure of 9.6 mg/kg), while 128 (45.4%) received less and 37 (13.1%) received more than the 
recommended regimen. However, 60/128 who received less than the recommended regimen did 
receive 2.4 mg/kg × 3 doses (total exposure of 7.2 mg/kg). The applicant also reports additional 
safety information from CDC-060 during 2011 to 2016.

EDCTP-MMV07-01 in 194 children provides supportive safety data for the US Army product. 
Added to these studies, after reviewing 31 trials identified by a 2013 meta-analysis of publications 
from 1992-2012, 8 prospective randomised trials were considered useful to assess safety. Most of the 
data across these 8 trials came from SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT and only two others (Cao, 1997 and 
Newton, 2003) described AEs.  
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
Cohort of 282 treated with US Army IV artesunate  
In Study 1128, the most frequently reported treatment emergent AEs (in at least 10%) across all dose 
groups were nervous system disorders including dizziness (33%), dysgeusia (33%) and headache 
(17%). Dizziness and dysgeusia appeared to be dose-related. All AEs except for one were graded as 
mild in severity. The exception occurred in 8.0 mg/kg dose group and concerned a moderate allergic 
reaction (urticaria) that started on the day of dosing and resolved the same day after treatment with 
diphenhydramine. 
In Study 1142 AEs reported by more than 10% in any dose group included nervous system disorders 
(dysgeusia, headache, dizziness, paresthesia and somnolence), anaemia and respiratory tract 
infection. Of these AEs, only dysgeusia appeared to be dose-dependent. From 5/7 to 6/6 in the 
artesunate dose groups had at least one AE considered drug-related. All AEs reported at least possibly 
related to drug were graded as “mild” in severity.  
Phase 2 studies 
Overall, 128/130 (98%) patients with uncomplicated malaria experienced at least one AE. Anaemia 
affected 20%-43.3% of patients across the dose groups while leukopenia affected up to 32%.  In study 
1263ab some degree of change in RBCs, WBCs and platelets occurred in all patients who received

artesunate. Typically, haematologic parameters were low at study entry, were followed by hyper-
response and then decreased again, ultimately returning to approximately normal. The RBC changes 
were considered typical of malaria patients and were attributed to the disease. Non-haematologic AEs 
reported with all artesunate regimens included abdominal pain, vomiting, diarrhoea, pyrexia, 
headache, dizziness, cough and rhinorrhoea.  
Most AEs (75.7%-86.3%) were of mild intensity. The highest percentage of severe AEs (6.8%) 
occurred with the highest dose (14.4 mg/kg) in Study 1263ab. Most of the severe AEs (17/23; 73.9%) 
were blood and lymphatic system disorders. In particular, neutropenia affected 60% of patients who 
received 4.8 mg/kg daily × 3 days and 20% had severe neutropenia. Thrombocytopenia was reported 
in 44.0% of patients at the highest IV AS dose.

Six AEs were considered possibly related to artesunate, of which 3 concerned infusion/injection site 
pain and there was one report each of hypotension, vomiting and eosinophilia. Another 4 AEs were 
considered definitely related to artesunate and concerned eosinophilia and dysgeusia, neither of which 
showed a dose-dependent trend.  
Study CDC-060  
Overall, 94/102 patients [92.2%] experienced at least one AE and the most frequently reported AEs 
were those associated with severe malaria (i.e. anaemia, LFTs increased and thrombocytopenia).

Of the 66 reports of anaemia, 20 (30%) were Grade 3 and 13 (20%) were Grade 4. Also, blood and 
lymphatic system disorders accounted for the highest percentage of Grade 3 and 4 AEs (53/126, or 
42.1%) of any SOC, followed by Investigations (18 or 14.3%). Among the 57 reports of anaemia 
considered related, the relationship was unlikely for 38 and possible for 19, with none considered of 
probable or definite relationship. The two AEs assessed as probably related were Grade 3 increases in 
hepatic transaminases in one patient and a Grade 1 increase in AST in the other. No AEs were 
considered definitely related to artesunate.

At least one AE was reported for 133/194 children (68.6%), including 68 in Group A (5 doses; 68.0%) 
and 65 in group B (4 doses; 69.1%) (p=0.878). In contrast to CDC-060, the two most common AEs 
were infections and infestations (29% Group A; 38% Group B) and gastrointestinal disorders (22%; 
24%). Anaemia was reported in 19% in Group A and 11% in Group B). Thrombocytopenia, 
leukocytosis, lymphopenia, neutropenia and transaminases increased were not observed.

In Phase 1 studies, the incidence of anaemia was 50% in those who received a multi-dose IV 
artesunate vs. 10% after a single dose. Anaemia occurred in 20.0%-43.3% in Phase 2 studies and in 
64.7% of patients in Study CDC-060.  
When patients with severe malaria receive effective treatment, Hb initially falls and typically reaches a 
nadir on Day 3 to Day 7 before rising to stabilise at about 6 weeks. This pattern was observed in CDC-
060, where the low mean Hb value of 10.3 g/dL at baseline fell to a nadir of 8.6 g/dL (mean decrease 
of 16.5%) on Day 5 and Day 6, and then edged upward to 8.7 g/dL on Day 7. The observed drop in Hb 
took place during the period of parasite clearance (range 36.7-57.1 h to achieve total elimination of 
parasites on blood smears, which is consistent with the pathogenic mechanisms of “typical” malarial 
anaemia associated with P. falciparum infection. The drop in Hb prior to Day 7 was also consistent with

the initial pattern of decline (i.e. drop of 16%-21% before Day 8) that was seen in a European study of 
anaemia occurring in travellers with severe Pf treated with IV artesunate in France. 
Thrombocytopenia was not reported in Phase 1 but occurred as an AE in up to 44% in Phase 2 and in 
17.7% in CDC-060, suggesting that it was an effect of the malaria disease process. Thrombocytopenia 
is a very common finding in malaria and the study findings were consistent with the literature. 
Furthermore, as patients with severe malaria in CDC-060 improved over time, their platelet counts 
quickly improved from a median value of 42,500/μL at baseline to 101,000/μL by Day 3 and 
219,500/μL at Day 7. All cases of thrombocytopenia in CDC-060 were considered unrelated or unlikely 
related to IV artesunate. 
Neutropenia was reported in 5% in Phase 1 and 4.9% in CDC-060 vs. up to 60% of patients in the 
Phase 2 studies, primarily with IV artesunate doses >2.4 mg/kg daily. Although decreases in WBCs 
(lymphopenia or neutropenia) were reported in 12/102 (11.8%) patients in CDC-060, only 1 case of 
lymphopenia was considered life threatening. All 5 cases of neutropenia and 2 of the 7 cases of 
lymphopenia were considered possibly related to IV artesunate.  
Reticulocyte count is the haematological parameter that is most consistently found to be altered by IV 
artesunate dosing across studies.  
As a drug class, the artemisinins have shown direct inhibitory effects on human erythroid precursors in 
vitro and can inhibit bone marrow responses (predominantly affecting red blood cell precursors) in 
animal models. Animal pre-clinical data have suggested that reversible reticulocytopenia might be a 
common side effect of IV artesunate, and this effect was confirmed in the initial Phase 1 studies, where 
reticulocytopenia occurred in healthy volunteers after IV artesunate administration.  
For example, in 1142 with IV artesunate dosed at 2, 4, or 8 mg/kg for 3 days, mild to moderate dose-
dependent reticulocytopenia was observed after the third dose in healthy subjects. A reticulocyte count 
nadir was reached in all dose cohorts by Day 7, but this effect reversed by Day 10. The reticulocyte 
count was not assessed in 1168. In study 1263ab in uncomplicated malaria in Kenyan and Thai adults 
and children there was a slight decrease in reticulocyte count on Day 3 in patients receiving the two 
higher IV artesunate doses (2.4 and 4.8 mg/kg). 
In summary, consistent with in vitro observations, a short-lived decrease in reticulocyte count 
following artesunate exposure has been documented in nonclinical studies and in clinical studies of IV 
artesunate. Transient dose-dependent decreases in reticulocytes were seen in healthy subjects in the 
Phase 1 studies and patients with uncomplicated malaria also experienced this effect. 
Post-artemisinin delayed haemolysis (PADH) 
PADH has been described primarily in patients from non-endemic areas who acquire malaria while 
travelling, with rates from < 5% to 27% in different studies. The mean observed drop in Hb is ~30% 
and this occurs at a mean of 16.3 ± 5.5 days after start of treatment. Affected patients present with 
high mean parasitaemia (20.5% ± 10.9%) that clears in a mean of 4.1 ± 2.3 days following treatment 
with artesunate. Almost all patients have elevated LDH and low or undetectable haptoglobin. In many 
reported cases of PADH there are potential confounding causes of haemolysis and/or anaemia including 
G6PD deficiency, HIV co-infection, transfusions, immune-mediated processes and haemolysis-related 
concomitant medications. Although patients survive PADH, from 5-50% need transfusions. In CDC-
060, 2/102 (2%) patients were assessed as showing the AE of “haemolysis” but their presentation was 
not consistent with PADH.  
Hepatic  
No AEs of hepatobiliary disorders or LFT abnormalities were reported in Phase 1. In Phase 2 studies 
there were sporadic reports of jaundice, hepatomegaly or ALT increased in <4% per dose group. In 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 87/110 
 
 
 
 
CDC-060, hepatobiliary disorders AEs were reported in 17/102 (17%) patients, of which most (14/17) 
were hyperbilirubinaemia (one of the recognised features of severe malaria). Four of the 14 cases of 
hyperbilirubinemia were assessed as Grade 4 (life-threatening/SAE) while 9 were assessed as Grade 3 
(severe) but only 4 were considered probably related to IV artesunate and none was considered 
definitely related. One patient (a 31-year-old male) developed Grade 4 acute hepatic failure. He was 
jaundiced at baseline, with hyperparasitaemia, impaired consciousness, circulatory collapse, acidosis, 
acute renal failure and abnormal bleeding/DIC. Onset of the patient’s acute hepatic failure was on Day 
2 and he expired on Day 3. Overall, the observed elevations in bilirubin and hepatic transaminases 
were considered related to malaria and its sequelae. 
Table 37: Study R-CDC-060: Summary of Hepatic Adverse Events by Severity and Causality 
Nervous system effects 
Nervous system disorders were reported in 3 (2.9%) patients in Study CDC-060, including 2 reports of 
brain oedema and 1 report of impaired consciousness that were Grade 4 but considered unrelated to IV 
artesunate. Across AQUAMAT, SEAQUAMAT, EDCTP-MMV07-01 and CDC-060, the most frequently 
reported nervous system disorders were coma and seizure or convulsion, with incidences slightly 
higher in the quinine group than the artesunate group. In SEAQUAMAT, 10.5% of artesunate-treated 
patients developed neurological defects after admission but only 1.2% had defects that persisted at 
discharge compared to 12.9% and 0.4%, respectively, in the quinine group.

The final tabulation of ADRs in the SmPC was further edited to reflect ADRs occurring in ≥ 1% and to 
remove rare or very rare single occurrences not felt to be drug related. This tabulation was then 
modified to add ADRs that can be expected to occur based on other published data, with special 
attention to rare or very rare events, severe and non-severe hypersensitivity reactions and post 
artesunate delayed haemolysis (PADH) as directed.  
2.6.8.3.  Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
No deaths occurred in the Phase 1 or Phase 2 trials. 
There were 7 deaths in CDC-060, none of which was judged to be related to the administration of IV 
AS and all were considered due to severe malaria. The most frequently recorded AEs leading to death 
were brain oedema or brainstem herniation, which occurred in 3 of the 7 who died. All of the patients 
who died showed significant baseline neurological impairment (seizures, impaired consciousness, 
ventilator support) and all had either moderate or severe hepatic injury as assessed by MELD score. 
Five had P. falciparum with baseline hyperparasitaemia ranging from 12% to 90% and one had 
confirmed P. vivax. Two of the patients who expired were aged >70 years and these were the only

patients in the study who were more than 70 years old. One other patient who died was aged > 60 
years. In contrast, death occurred in only 2/11 diabetics in the study while none who had pre-existing 
Hepatitis A or B infection, asthma, G6PD deficiency or asplenia or who were pregnant died.

During the subsequent 6 years (2011-2016), the death rate among IV artesunate-treated patients with 
severe malaria was 6.1%. None of the 23 deaths that occurred from 2007 to 2016 was in children. 
In EDCTP-MMV07-01, two patients died in the 3-dose cohort. One was a female with sickle cell disease 
age 3 or 4 years who presented with severe anaemia (Hb 4.2 g/dL), hyperparasitaemia, fever, nausea, 
vomiting and fatigue. She received all 3 doses of IV artesunate but fell into an unarousable coma and 
suffered cardiac arrest on Day 2. Her death was classified as possibly related to the study drug. The 
other was a 34-month-old male who died on Day 1 following a grand mal seizure. His death was 
attributed to cerebral malaria and respiratory distress, and it was considered unrelated to the study 
drug. There were no deaths in the 5-dose cohort.  
In SEAQUAMAT the death rate was 15% for artesunate compared to 22% for quinine. In AQUAMAT the 
death rates were 8.5% vs. 10.9%, respectively.  
SAEs 
There was one SAE in a female patient treated for uncomplicated malaria in 1168 who was hospitalised 
after developing bullous erythema multiforme (preferred term “Stevens-Johnson Syndrome”) after her 
IV artesunate had concluded and she had begun receiving Malarone. This SAE was considered probably 
related to Malarone and possibly related to IV artesunate. It resolved following a brief hospitalisation. 
2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
In 1128, the only notable finding was a dose-dependent transient decease in reticulocyte count after IV 
artesunate that peaked on day 4 and mostly returned to baseline by day 8.  
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 93/110 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In 1142, the only notable trend was for drug-dependent transient reticulocytopenia after IV artesunate 
that returned to at least baseline by day 10 in most cases. On Day 10, reticulocyte counts in the 
artesunate groups were higher than at baseline and higher vs. the placebo group. 
In 1168 and in 1263 there were no pronounced drug effects on haemoglobin or haematocrit. Platelets 
and neutrophils were low at baseline and then showed a hyper-response following treatment. There 
were also cases of eosinophilia observed, which is typical of patients with malaria. An increase in total 
bilirubin was observed on Day 3 and resolved by Day 7, which was attributed to malaria. There was a 
slight depression in reticulocytes on Day 3 in subjects receiving highest doses.  
In CDC-060, mean values of most blood chemistry parameters increased marginally from baseline to 
Day 7, an effect that paradoxically reflected treatment success, i.e. as subjects recovered and were 
discharged, the submitted samples represented readings from those with a more difficult and longer 
clinical course. During this period, the maximum BUN value for the population increased, driven by 
readings from a relatively small number of patients who had persistent renal effects from malaria. 
Acidosis (a feature of severe malaria) was reported in 3.9% of patients. 
2.6.8.5.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the applicant’s cohort of 282 treated with US Army IV artesunate, there was only one withdrawal 
because of an AE. This occurred in study 1142 and was due to upper respiratory tract infection that 
was considered unrelated to IV artesunate. 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Relevant safety database 
There were 282 healthy subjects and patients with uncomplicated or severe malaria exposed to the US 
Army product in 4 sponsored trials and in CDC-060. Another 194 children with severe malaria were 
exposed in the MMV-sponsored study that used US Army product. None of these individuals received 
the final product to be placed on the EU market.  
There is some information on safety (albeit mainly from publications and therefore limited in nature) 
for several thousand patients with malaria, many of whom had severe malaria. The minimum age of 
treated patients seems to have been 6 months (in the MMV study) but the majority of the data come 
from children aged from ~18 months, adolescents and adults. The adult data come mainly from 
subjects aged < 50 years.  
General features of the safety profile 
In the US Army sponsored studies, non-serious AEs mapping to the nervous system were common, 
including headache, dizziness and dysgeusia. In the single and multiple dose studies in healthy 
subjects, reversible reticulocytopenia during treatment was observed. This phenomenon is recognised 
to occur in association with artemisinin administration along with anaemia, reduced neutrophil counts 
and eosinophilia that are usually mild and short-lived.  
In the two US Army studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, the effect of artesunate on the 
haematological findings was confounded by the effect of malaria and recovery from malaria. Anaemia 
affected 20%-43.3% of patients across the dose groups while leukopenia affected up to 32%.  In 
particular, neutropenia affected 60% of patients who received 4.8 mg/kg daily × 3 days and 20% had 
severe neutropenia. Thrombocytopenia was reported in 44.0% of patients at the highest IV AS dose. 
Nevertheless, there was no clear or consistent relationship between the haematological effects and 
total administered artesunate dose. It seems that counts recovered over time. 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 94/110 
 
 
 
 
In CDC-060, the most frequently reported AEs were anaemia, LFTs increased and thrombocytopenia. 
While 29% of reported cases of anaemia were considered possibly related to artesunate, ~60% of 
increases in LFTs were considered at least possibly drug-related by the CBEC. Neutropenia and 
lymphopenia were also reported. Of the 66 total reports of anaemia, 20 (30%) were Grade 3 and 13 
(20%) were Grade 4. Blood and lymphatic system disorders accounted for the highest percentage of 
Grade 3 and 4 AEs (53/126; 42.1%) of any SOC, followed by Investigations (18/126; 14.3%). 
Reticulocyte counts were not routinely assessed in CDC-060 so the rates cannot be compared with the 
other studies. 
In contrast to the US Army-sponsored trials, the two most common AEs reported in EDCTP–MMV07-01 
were infections and infestations (29% Group A; 38% Group B) and gastrointestinal disorders (22%; 
24%). Laboratory testing was conducted at baseline and on days 2, 7 and 28 in this study. Anaemia 
was reported as an AE in 19% in Group A and 11% in Group B, about half of which were deemed to be 
possibly related to treatment, while thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, neutropenia and 
transaminases increased were not reported. 
Similarly, the AEs reported in the SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT trials showed little comparability to those 
reported in CDC-060. The applicant coded the raw data from SEAQUAMAT provided by the Wellcome 
Trust in accordance with MedDRA preferred terms and summary statistics were prepared. The 
frequency of AEs in this trial was generally similar between the IV artesunate and IV quinine groups. 
After initiation of treatment, renal failure was the most commonly reported AE in the artesunate 
(19.2%) and quinine groups (21.5%). However, some patients had BUN > 60 mg/dL at admission, 
suggesting that they already had renal failure at baseline.  
Overall, it seems that the investigators involved in the trials of severe malaria conducted in endemic 
regions had a rather different focus in terms of reporting AEs and ADRs. The general picture suggests 
that in these trials many observations made on treatment were regarded as normal changes in 
response to severe malaria and its treatment such that reporting of AEs and ADRs was confined to 
deteriorations and development of complications.  
Post-artemisinin delayed haemolysis (PADH) 
Typically, anaemia is present in at the time of presentation with severe malaria, worsens with effective 
antimalarial treatment and then recovers over a period up to at ~6 weeks.  
However, if delayed haemolysis associated with severe malaria that has been successfully treated with 
IV artesunate or another artemisinin occurs, there is a late drop in haemoglobin at 2-3 weeks after the 
first dose. While most cases have been described in returning travellers, there were no confirmed 
cases of PADH in CDC-060 although some would have been expected based on estimated rates for 
PADH in the literature ranging from 0.9%-27.8%.  
Neurological sequelae 
Severe malaria can lead to neurological sequelae regardless of the antimalarial agents used for 
treatment. These sequelae are especially likely to occur in patients who already have major 
neurological problems when they first present for treatment or who do not respond to their initial 
antimalarial regimen. However, in the 1980s and 1990s, as global interest in the value of the 
artemisinins for treatment of severe and uncomplicated malaria increased, nonclinical data emerged 
that raised some questions over whether the artemisinins themselves might be associated with an 
enhanced risk of residual neurological deficits. The findings were examined closely by WHO’s expert 
committees, which concluded that the clinical evidence did not support a need for concern. Since then, 
many millions have been treated for uncomplicated malaria with various artemisinin combination 
regimens and the WHO has recommended parenteral artesunate for first line treatment of severe 
malaria.

Nevertheless, the applicant has paid close attention to the AEs and ADRs pertaining to the nervous 
system observed in clinical trials in patients with malaria. Across AQUAMAT, SEAQUAMAT, EDCTP-
MMV07-01 and R-CDC-060, the most frequently reported nervous system disorders were coma and 
seizure or convulsion. In the comparative studies, rates were slightly higher rates in the quinine group 
than the artesunate group.  
In SEAQUAMAT, 10.5% of artesunate-treated patients and 12.9% treated with quinine developed 
neurological defects after admission but only 1.2% and 0.4% in respective groups had defects that 
persisted at discharge. Of 10 patients (7 artesunate and 3 quinine) discharged from hospital with 
residual neurological sequelae, 5 had psychiatric sequelae, four had persisting problems with balance 
(one of whom had both psychiatric sequelae and a tremor) and two had a hemiparesis. Moreover, the 
incidence of any significant sequelae was 5.9% vs. 4.1% for the artesunate and quinine groups 
respectively (p=0.1171), yielding a relative risk ratio (artesunate/quinine) of 1.44 with 95% 
confidence interval (0.91, 2.26). However, the applicant points out that the finding likely reflects a 
lower mortality rate among cerebral malaria patients in the artesunate group, resulting in more 
individuals who survived but had significant sequelae at hospital discharge. This supposition is 
supported by the observation that the incidence of sequelae was higher in the artesunate group than in 
the quinine group among the severe malaria patients (7.1% vs. 3.7%) but lower in the non-severe 
patients (3.2% vs. 5.3%).  
In AQUAMAT, the numbers with convulsions that developed after admission or were present on 
admission and persisted for more than 6 h were 224 in the artesunate group vs. 273 in the quinine 
group, while 65 artesunate vs. 91 quinine patients developed coma or had a deterioration of their 
coma score after starting antimalarial treatment. In the 4898 survivors, 99 artesunate vs. 71 quinine 
patients had not yet made full neurological recoveries at the time of hospital discharge. However, at 
longer-term follow-up there was no appreciable difference between groups in numbers with residual 
neurological deficits. The overall rate of persistent neurological sequelae in survivors assessed at 28 
days after cerebral malaria was 3.2% (24/706 artesunate, 23/737 quinine) and the rate for severe 
neurological sequelae was 2.3% (17/706 artesunate, 17/737 quinine).  
Of the 14 patients with any neurological sequelae who did not have cerebral malaria initially (10 
artesunate, 4 quinine), 7 had multiple convulsions (3 quinine, 4 artesunate) and all had severe 
prostration on admission. 
In CDC-060 seizures, impaired consciousness or ventilator support at baseline were reported for 35% 
of the safety analysis population. Three patients were reported to have AEs mapping to the nervous 
system, including two with brain oedema and one with depressed consciousness, all of which were 
ascribed to malaria.   
In conclusion, noting the impact of successful treatment of severe malaria and the need to view data 
on neurological deficits not present at baseline in light of those who survived, the data do not support 
an association between treatment of severe malaria with IV artesunate and enhanced risk of 
neurological sequelae.  
Deaths and SAEs 
Deaths were reported only in the trials that enrolled patients with severe malaria. Death was most 
likely to occur in those with severe neurological deficits and/or hyperparasitaemia when starting 
treatment with IV artesunate. There is no indication that the deaths were due to IV artesunate.  
The risk of SAEs cannot be determined from available information.

This was completely revised during the assessment, with a detailed tabulation of ADRs reported in 
various studies and a justification for the final table in section 4.8 of the SmPC. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The appraisal of the safety of the applicant’s IV artesunate is not straightforward. The most reliable 
data come from the four studies sponsored by the US Army, but none enrolled the target population 
with severe malaria. The non-comparative safety data obtained under the CDC protocol indicate that 
some AEs and ADRs reflected the underlying infection, which in some patients showed worsening from 
baseline even if they recovered eventually and in other patients preceded death. Moreover, the timing 
of onset of some AEs and ADRs was after completion of initial IV artesunate, which makes the 
assessment of causality even more difficult. Nevertheless, it could be considered that the safety data 
from CDC-060 are more complete than the data reported from SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT, in which it 
may be concluded that investigators tended to report only AEs that could not be ascribed to the course 
of the disease.     
The overall opinion is that IV artesunate itself is probably not associated with major safety concerns 
but it clearly (as with all other pharmacological agents) carries a risk for hypersensitivity reactions, 
which may sometimes be severe. There seems to be a risk for headache, dizziness and dysgeusia. 
There is also possibly a risk for LFT increases over and above any reaction to severe malaria. Also, 
there seem to be early on-treatment drops in blood cell counts that recover quickly but with the 
additional risk of PADH with onset after successful recovery.  
With regard to safe use in paediatric population, there are very few case reports of use of artesunate in 
children aged < 6 months in the EU, although there is more experience with oral artemisinin usage in 
infants (i.e. not with IV artesunate but with oral artesunate and other oral artemisinin preparations). 
The available safety and efficacy data do not raise concerns.  No dose adjustment is recommended 
based on age or weight. Appropriate warnings have been added to relevant SmPC sections.

2.7.4.  Conclusion 
The CHMP considers that the risk management plan version 0.5 is acceptable. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
2.8.1.  Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
2.8.2.  Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did request alignment of the PSUR 
cycle with the international birth date (IBD). The IBD is 23.06.2020. The new EURD list entry will 
therefore use the IBD to determine the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.8.3.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use.

2.8.4.  Labelling exemptions  
A request of translation exemption of the labelling as per Art.63.1 of Directive 2001/83/EC has been 
submitted by the applicant and has been found acceptable by the QRD Group for the following reasons: 
The company requested all packaging components, including the package leaflet (PL), in English only 
on the basis of article 63.1. The group accepted the request on the basis that it is an ultra-orphan 
medicinal product due to the low incidence of severe malaria in the EU (estimated at ~1250 cases per 
year). It is, therefore, likely to have only minimal use annually across Europe in a limited number of 
countries. Consequently, producing a product with regional translations applicable to all EU Member 
States would be complicated for the product supply chain and distribution management. The group 
also took into account that this product will only be administered by health care professionals and will 
not be delivered directly to the patient. 
Only two Member States, Belgium and Greece, agreed on the translation exemption (EN only) for the 
immediate and outer labelling, however, the PL should always be provided in their national 
language(s). It can also be considered acceptable to provide the PL alongside the pack, if this is 
technically a better option for the company.  
The labelling subject to translation exemption as per the QRD Group decision above will however be 
translated in all languages in the Annexes published with the EPAR on EMA website, but the printed 
materials will only be translated in the language(s) as agreed by the QRD Group. 
2.8.5.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Artesunate Amivas (artesunate) is included 
in the additional monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was 
not contained in any medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Artesunate Amivas is a semi-synthetic artemisinin derivative given intravenously. The applicant 
proposes that it is used for the initial treatment of severe malaria in adults and children.   
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Malaria is a potentially fatal illness caused by protozoal infection of red blood cells (RBC) with parasites 
belonging to the genus Plasmodium, transmitted to humans by the bite of a Plasmodium-infected 
female anopheline mosquito usually between dusk and dawn. Five species of Plasmodium infect 
humans: Plasmodium falciparum (Pf), P. vivax (Pv), P. ovale (Po), P. malariae (Pm), and P. knowlesi 
(Pk). Most severe malaria is due to P. falciparum, although severe malaria due to other species is 
recognised. In Europe in 2018, among 4,516 confirmed cases for which the Plasmodium species was 
reported, 3,793 (84.0%) had P. falciparum and 339 (7.5%) had P. vivax. 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 100/110 
 
 
 
 
 
According to the World Malaria Report 2018, there were 219 million cases of malaria globally in 2017 
(uncertainty range 203–262 million) and 435,000 malaria deaths, representing a decrease in malaria 
cases and deaths rates of 18% and 28% since 2010, respectively. The burden is heaviest in Africa. In 
the EU and in the US, malaria occurs in returning travelers or very recent immigrants from malaria 
endemic areas. Severe malaria occurred in 293, 259 and 306 US residents in 2014, 2015 and 2016, 
respectively. In Europe in 2018, the total number of all malaria cases (uncomplicated and severe 
combined) was 8,349. However, as in the US, the proportion of severe cases in Europe was very low, 
typically 10% of the total.  
Complicated malaria, defined as malaria for which initial oral treatment is not possible, includes 
malaria that does and does not meet the WHO (2015) criteria for severe malaria. The WHO defines 
severe falciparum malaria according to one or more clinical features occurring in the presence of 
asexual parasitaemia: 
Impaired consciousness: Glasgow coma score <11 in adults or Blantyre coma score <3 in children. 
Multiple convulsions: >2 episodes in 24 h. 
Prostration: Generalised weakness - unable to sit, stand or walk without assistance. 
Significant bleeding: Including recurrent or prolonged bleeding from the nose, gums or venipuncture 
sites, haematemesis or melaena. 
Shock: Compensated shock (defined as capillary refill ≥3 seconds or temperature gradient on leg but 
no hypotension) or decompensated shock (defined as systolic blood pressure <80 mmHg in adults or 
< 70 mmHg in children, with evidence of impaired perfusion). 
Pulmonary oedema: Radiologically confirmed or oxygen saturation <92% on room air with respiratory 
rate >30/min, often with chest in drawing and crepitations on auscultation. 
These clinical features are accompanied by one or more laboratory findings that may include: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Hypoglycaemia: Blood or plasma glucose <2.2 mmol/L (40 mg/dL). 
Acidosis: A base deficit of >8 mEq/L or plasma bicarbonate <15 mmol/L or venous plasma lactate 
≥5 mmol/L. Severe acidosis manifests as respiratory distress (rapid, deep, labored breathing). 
Severe malarial anaemia: Haemoglobin ≤5 g/dL or haematocrit ≤15% in children <12 years (≤7 
g/dL and <20%, respectively, in adults) with parasitaemia > 10,000/μL. 
Hyperparasitaemia: P. falciparum parasitaemia >5%. 
Renal impairment: Blood creatinine >265 µmol/L (3 mg/dL) or BUN >20 mmol/L. 
Jaundice: Bilirubin >50 µmol/L (3 mg/dL) with >100,000 parasites/μL. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Quinine was the mainstay of treatment of severe malaria until the rediscovery of artemisinin in China 
in 1972 and the subsequent synthesis of artemether and artesunate. Artemisinin derivatives are now 
widely recognised to be the most rapidly acting of all the antimalarial drugs. The SEAQUAMAT 
Consortium compared IV AS to IV quinine for severe malaria in 1461 (mostly adult) Asian patients and 
found that parenteral artesunate was statistically superior to quinine in preventing death. This was 
followed by a study of similar design in 5,425 African children in 2010 (AQUAMAT), which also showed 
that parenteral artesunate was superior to quinine in preventing mortality. Based on these and other 
trials, the WHO issued a strong recommendation for the use of IV or IM AS in patients with severe 
malaria for at least 24 h and until oral medication is possible. The recommended oral follow-on 
treatment consists of 3 days of an artemisinin-based combination therapy. 
In the European Union, there are no medicinal products specifically authorised for the initial treatment 
of severe malaria. There is one antimalarial available for IV administration but it is licensed only in 
France as SURQUINA (IV quinine). While many EU centres have moved to use of IV artesunate for

initial treatment of severe malaria, the available products are either the WHO-prequalified (2011) 
Guilin formulation or artesunate formulations manufactured or approved in other jurisdictions. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The demonstration of efficacy of IV artesunate is based on two prospective, randomised, controlled 
trials: 
o 
The South East Asian Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial - SEAQUAMAT - was conducted between 
2003 and 2005 in adults and children with severe falciparum malaria admitted to hospitals in Asia 
and SE Asia. The study was published in 2005 (Lancet 2005; 366: 717-25). The applicant gained 
access to the data from this study from the sponsor and constructed a supplementary report. 
o 
The African Quinine Artesunate Malaria Trial - AQUAMAT - was conducted between 2005 and 2010 
in children with severe falciparum malaria admitted to hospitals in Africa. The study was published 
in 2010 (Lancet 2010; 376: 1647-57). The applicant was unable to gain access to the data from 
this study so the only information available comes from the publication.  
Of many other studies reported in the application dossier, two studies were conducted with US Army 
artesunate in severe malaria: 
• 
• 
CDC-060 was a retrospective uncontrolled study in returning US travelers of any age who received 
IV artesunate under the CDC protocol. The applicant was given access to data by the CDC. 
EDCTP-MMV07-01 was conducted in African children aged < 5 years by MMV and it compared two 
different  regimens  of  IV  artesunate  with  no  active  control  arm.  A  CSR  constructed  by  MMV  is 
available. 
The applicant is unable to verify GCP compliance in any of these important studies. Furthermore, for 
reasons explained by the applicant, inspections of study sites or of other bodies involved in the conduct 
of these studies are not feasible. Nevertheless, CDC-060 was conducted under a US IND and it appears 
that the deficit is with regards to the variable level of data collection at various sites.  
Moreover, four studies in the dossier (two PK studies in healthy subjects and two studies with IV 
artesunate for uncomplicated malaria) were sponsored by the US Army and conducted under an IND. 
These were subjected to independent audits by a CRO. However, a definitive conclusion on GCP 
compliance for these sponsored studies is not possible.    
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Pivotal randomised controlled studies - SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT 
These were both prospective, randomised trials that compared initial treatment with parenteral 
artesunate with widely recommended and well-established comparative regimens for treatment of 
severe P. falciparum malaria. Taken together, the two trials cover a wide age range. In general, the 
main features of the design of these studies seem to have been appropriate. 
Both studies used the same parenteral artesunate regimen, with 2.4 mg/kg given at 0, 12 h and 24 h, 
and then once daily dosing until oral medication was possible. This is the posology recommended in 
the applicant’s SmPC. It appears that SEAQUAMAT (based on the protocol from 2003 and the 
applicant’s CSR but not mentioned in the publication) and AQUAMAT (mentioned in the publication) 
allowed IM as an alternative to IV administration of the initial parenteral treatment but no patient 
received IM in SEAQUAMAT and only ~10% were dosed IM in AQUAMAT.    
Both studies also used the same initial comparative regimen, with a 20 mg/kg loading dose of quinine 
followed by 10 mg/kg q8h until oral treatment was possible. However, while AQUAMAT required that 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 102/110 
 
 
 
 
 
24 h parenteral treatment was given before an oral switch, there does not seem to have been a 
minimum duration of parenteral treatment required in SEAQUAMAT.  
There is an important difference between the two studies in terms of oral follow-on treatment. In 
SEAQUAMAT, parenteral artesunate was followed by oral artesunate and parenteral quinine was 
followed by oral quinine, both given with oral doxycycline unless this was contraindicated. The 
contribution of the oral follow-on regimens to the overall in-hospital mortality rates and to the other 
clinical endpoints cannot be determined in this study design. Furthermore, there was no on-treatment 
serial parasite counting conducted, which means that the initial impact of the two parenteral 
treatments on parasite density cannot be compared.  
In contrast, all patients in AQUAMAT followed initial parenteral treatment with a full course or oral 
artemether-lumefantrine (Coartem). Coartem is highly effective for the de novo treatment of 
uncomplicated malaria and use of the same follow-on regimen in both treatment arms could be 
expected, if anything, to reduce the differences observed between randomised groups in terms of 
outcomes measured after oral switch. Therefore, any differences detected between the two randomised 
treatment arms likely reflect the impact on the initial parenteral treatment.  
The primary efficacy endpoint in both studies was in-hospital all-cause mortality, which was thought to 
reflect death rates from the presenting episodes of severe malaria. This primary endpoint is 
acceptable.  
Based on this primary endpoint, both studies were planned with sample sizes to provide 80% power to 
show a reduction in mortality for initial parenteral treatment with artesunate vs. quinine. The 
estimated mortality rates reflected recent data relevant to the populations enrolled.  
In SEAQUAMAT, the second interim analysis was based on data for 1294 patients up to February 2005 
and led to stopping the study in May 2005. The publication of this study describes results for the 1461 
patients enrolled when the study was stopped, including 271 deaths.  
The applicant’s CSR is based on re-analyses of data from the total 1461 patients. The great majority of 
the 1461 randomised patients (~95%) had P. falciparum confirmed by microscopy of blood smears and 
adults accounted for 1269/1461 patients. About 70% of the ITT population met at least one of the 
criteria for severe malaria. 
In the ITT and PP populations, the in-hospital death rates were statistically significantly lower in the 
artesunate group, with an absolute difference between groups of 7-8 percentage points. Both analyses 
indicated that the relative risk of dying in the artesunate group was about 2/3 of that in the quinine 
group with upper bounds of the 95% confidence intervals that did not exceed 0.82. Most of the 
treatment effect reflected reduction in mortality after the first 24-48 h on study. This finding is 
important since, in this study, the two treatment groups had separate oral follow-on regimens (i.e. 
artesunate or quinine as per initial assignment), which would have contributed to the overall survival 
and clinical response rates.   
Severe malaria was confirmed for 509 (70%) in the artesunate group and 541 (74%) in the quinine 
group. The mortality rates in those with severe disease were 19.8% with artesunate compared to 
28.1% with quinine, which was a statistically significant benefit. The mortality rates varied significantly 
between countries (from 9.3% in Indonesia to 28% in Bangladesh), which the publication mentions 
may have reflected availability of intensive care. Nevertheless, the absolute risk reduction in each 
country associated with artesunate vs. quinine treatment was in the range from 5-9 percentage points.  
In AQUAMAT, the final study population was more homogeneous than that in SEAQUAMAT, being 
confined to African children aged from 18 months to <5 years. Although about one third had received 
potentially effective antimalarial treatment for the presenting episode, the condition of the children at 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 103/110 
 
 
 
 
study baseline indicates that the treatment was not controlling the disease. As expected, the mean and 
range of baseline parasitaemia was even higher in these children compared to the mainly adult 
population enrolled into SEAQUAMAT.  
The ITT population death rates in both treatment groups were lower compared to those in 
SEAQUAMAT, being 8.5% vs. 10.9%, representing a statistically significant benefit for starting 
treatment with artesunate rather than quinine when each was followed by oral Coartem. A very similar 
result was obtained in the PP population with confirmed P. falciparum. Importantly, the mortality rates 
in the subset that met the pre-defined criteria for severe malaria, which comprised ~85% of the total 
5425 randomised, were 9.9% for artesunate and 12.4% for quinine, which was a statistically 
significant difference (p=0.0055). Moreover, in contrast to SEAQUAMAT, the survival curves diverged 
from the time of the first dose onwards.        
Severe malaria treated with Artesunate Amivas 
EDTCP-MMV07-01 was conducted in children 6 months-10 years with severe malaria regardless of 
species. The study compared 5 doses of 2.4 mg/kg within 72 h with 3 doses of 4 mg/kg within 48 h in 
a double blind design. The primary endpoint was the rate of 99% parasite clearance (PC99) at 24 h 
after the first dose (i.e. after 2 doses of 2.4 mg/kg or after 1 dose of 4 mg/kg).  
There was a numerical advantage for the 4 mg/kg dose group based on PC99 at 24 h. However, the 
median time to PC100 was 36 h in both dose groups and there were only 6-h differences between 
regimens for the median times to PC90 and PC99. Also, the median FCT was 12 h in both groups. It 
was concluded that both regimens were suitable for the initial treatment of severe malaria in the age 
range studied.  
CDC-060 was a retrospective uncontrolled study of initial IV artesunate with at least 4 doses of 2.4 
mg/kg at 0 h, 12 h, 24 h and 48 h. Not all patients entering this study necessarily had severe malaria 
and infections were not confined to P. falciparum. While the primary endpoint was safety, the study 
captured effects on treatment on parasite counts as well as the clinical outcomes.  
Since this study was conducted in returning travellers, the importance for the application is that it 
describes outcomes in persons not likely to have any or, at least, any substantial pre-existing naturally 
acquired immunity to malaria.   
The results must be viewed with much caution, not least due to the number and types of protocol 
deviations, including concomitant antimalarial agents during the IV treatment phase. Nevertheless, the 
baseline features indicate that a substantial proportion of the patients were severely unwell at the time 
of starting artesunate. This is underlined by the fact that 5 patients died before completing 4 doses of 
artesunate. While the applicant reports median times to negative parasitology for the safety, evaluable 
and PP populations (as defined in the CSR), with point estimates from 42-50 h, these numbers are 
based on populations that included those who received other antimalarial agents with IV artesunate.  
Thus, it should be noted that the 38/87 patients in the evaluable analysis population who received 
concurrent antimalarial treatments during IV artesunate administration did not show a statistically 
significant difference in time to negative parasitology compared with the 49/87 who received IV 
artesunate alone. However, there was a numerical difference (43 h vs. 51 h, respectively; p=0.942). 
In the 49 with no concomitant antimalarial agent during IV artesunate administration, 39/49 (80%) 
transitioned to oral antimalarial therapy with a mean time to initiation of 3.8 days (range 2 to 5 days).  
To support initial monotherapy with IV artesunate, the applicant compared all the efficacy endpoints 
for the subsets of the evaluable population (this being the population of most interest) that did (n=38) 
and did not (n=49) receive concomitant antimalarial agents during IV artesunate treatment. There was 
no benefit for adding an antimalarial agent to IV artesunate, supporting initial monotherapy usage.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The GCP compliance of SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT cannot be verified. Nevertheless, these trials were 
conducted by academic consortia under the sponsorship of the Wellcome Trust. There is no reason to 
consider that the data would not be reliable.  
With a primary endpoint of in-hospital death, the focus of these studies was on mortality ascribable to 
the acute malaria episode. Both studies report the total death and sequelae rates at 28 days and both 
showed an advantage for initial treatment with parenteral artesunate vs. quinine. While the primary 
analyses included patients who did not meet the criteria for severe malaria, both studies showed a 
benefit for artesunate in the defined severe malaria subsets. The criteria for severe malaria applied 
were not the same between studies and were not identical to those published by WHO in 2015 but they 
seem to have been sufficient to identify the subsets presenting with the most severe disease. 
Whilst the most relevant data come from CDC-060, this was a retrospective study in a population of 
returning travellers with malaria and with a very wide age range. Based on the summary of how 
patients met inclusion criteria, the majority seem likely to have had at least one feature indicating 
severe malaria. With 102 patients in the safety population, the death rate during the data abstraction 
period was 7/102 (6.9%) while the death rate in the evaluable population was 6/87 (6.9%). The 
median time to negative parasitology was < ~2 days in the evaluable and PP populations, with or 
without use of concurrent antimalarial agents, supporting the impact of parenteral artesunate. 
The MMV study had no active control group. However, in African children aged from 6 months to < 10 
years with severe P. falciparum malaria based on the protocol-defined criteria, the effects on parasite 
counts indicated that both regimens were effective. The study lends support to the use of the proposed 
weight-based posology in the SmPC regardless of age. Moreover, the applicant has summarised 
several studies reported in the literature that support the 2.4 mg/kg IV artesunate regimen in children. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
In the US Army sponsored studies, non-serious AEs mapping to the nervous system were common, 
including headache, dizziness and dysgeusia. In the single and multiple dose studies in healthy 
subjects, reversible reticulocytopenia during treatment was observed. This phenomenon is recognised 
to occur in association with artemisinin administration along with anaemia, reduced neutrophil counts 
and eosinophilia that are usually mild and short-lived. In contrast to the early on-treatment drop in 
reticulocyte count that was observed in uninfected subjects and sometimes in patients with malaria 
(e.g. this was seen in study 1263), the reticulocyte count tends to peak after 1 to 2 weeks during 
recovery from severe malaria.  
In the two US Army studies in patients with uncomplicated malaria, the effect of artesunate on the 
haematological findings was confounded by the effect of malaria and recovery from malaria. Anaemia 
affected 20%-43.3% of patients across the dose groups while leukopenia affected up to 32%.  In 
particular, neutropenia affected 60% of patients who received 4.8 mg/kg daily × 3 days and 20% had 
severe neutropenia. Thrombocytopenia was reported in 44.0% of patients at the highest IV AS dose. 
Nevertheless, there was no clear or consistent relationship between the haematological effects and 
total administered artesunate dose. It seems that counts recovered over time. 
In CDC-060, the most frequently reported AEs were anaemia, LFTs increased and thrombocytopenia. 
While 29% of reported cases of anaemia were considered possibly related to artesunate, ~60% of 
increases in LFTs were considered at least possibly drug-related by the CBEC. Neutropenia and 
lymphopenia were also reported. Of the 66 total reports of anaemia, 20 (30%) were Grade 3 and 13 
(20%) were Grade 4. Blood and lymphatic system disorders accounted for the highest percentage of 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 105/110 
 
 
 
 
Grade 3 and 4 AEs (53/126; 42.1%) of any SOC, followed by Investigations (18/126; 14.3%). 
Reticulocyte counts were not routinely assessed in CDC-060 so the rates cannot be compared with the 
other studies. 
In contrast to the US Army-sponsored trials, the two most common AEs reported in EDCTP–MMV07-01 
were infections and infestations (29% Group A; 38% Group B) and gastrointestinal disorders (22%; 
24%). Laboratory testing was conducted at baseline and on days 2, 7 and 28 in this study. Anaemia 
was reported as an AE in 19% in Group A and 11% in Group B, about half of which were deemed to be 
possibly related to treatment, while thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis, lymphopenia, neutropenia and 
transaminases increased were not reported. 
Similarly, the AEs reported in the SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT trials showed little comparability to those 
reported in CDC-060. The applicant coded the raw data from SEAQUAMAT provided by the Wellcome 
Trust in accordance with MedDRA preferred terms and summary statistics were prepared. The 
frequency of AEs in this trial was generally similar between the IV artesunate and IV quinine groups.  
After initiation of treatment, renal failure was the most commonly reported AE in the artesunate 
(19.2%) and quinine groups (21.5%). However, some patients had BUN > 60 mg/dL at admission, 
suggesting that they already had renal failure at baseline.  
PADH is a recognised ADR that may occur after effective treatment with IV artesunate or another 
artemisinin. It is characterised by a late drop in haemoglobin at 2-3 weeks after the first dose. Most 
cases have been described in returning travellers, with estimated rates ranging from 0.9-27.8%.  
The applicant has paid close attention to neurological sequelae. Across AQUAMAT, SEAQUAMAT, 
EDCTP-MMV07-01 and R-CDC-060, the most frequently reported nervous system disorders were coma 
and seizure or convulsion. In the comparative studies, rates were slightly higher rates in the quinine 
group than the artesunate group. Overall, viewing data on rates for neurological deficits not present at 
baseline in light of those who survived, the data do not support an association between treatment of 
severe malaria with IV artesunate and enhanced risk of neurological sequelae.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
There were 282 healthy subjects and patients with uncomplicated or severe malaria exposed to the US 
Army product in 4 sponsored trials and in CDC-060. Another 194 children with severe malaria were 
exposed in the MMV-sponsored study that used US Army product. Thus, the safety database for which 
capture of AEs and ADRs is most complete is small. None of these individuals received the final product 
to be placed on the EU market. 
However, there is some information on safety (albeit mainly from publications and therefore limited in 
nature) for several thousand patients with malaria, many of whom had severe malaria. The minimum 
age of treated patients seems to have been 6 months (in the MMV study) but the majority of the data 
come from children aged from ~18 months, adolescents and adults. The adult data come mainly from 
subjects aged < 50 years.  
The applicant has pointed to stark differences in the types of AEs and ADRs reported from studies 
conducted in endemic areas vs. those sponsored by the US Army and CDC. Overall, it seems that the 
investigators involved in the trials of severe malaria conducted in endemic regions regarded many 
observations made on treatment as normal changes in response to severe malaria and its treatment 
such that reporting of AEs and ADRs was confined to deteriorations and development of complications.  
These differences in reporting make it difficult to determine which ADRs merit mention in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC, including differentiation of true ADRs from AEs. Nevertheless, the applicant conducted a

review of ADRs captured across the studies and the final table of ADRs in section 4.8 of the draft SmPC 
is now agreed subject to a few additions.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
Efficacy in the initial treatment of severe malaria 
This application rests on two prospective randomised and active controlled trials conducted in endemic 
regions – SEAQUAMAT and AQAUAMAT – for which the degree of GCP compliance cannot be verified.

The two trials were conducted in populations that differed in age range and geographical distribution. 
Different approaches were taken to the oral follow-on treatment and only retrospectively defined 
subsets met the pre-defined criteria for severe malaria, these subsets being most relevant to the 
indication statement.  
Nevertheless, both studies gave results that support the proposed IV artesunate dose regimen for the 
initial treatment of severe P. falciparum malaria in children aged from ~18 months, adolescents and 
adults.  
Inevitably, these studies were conducted in endemic areas where some degree of partial immunity to 
malaria is acquired as subjects get older.  
It is important that the AQUAMAT study was confined to children aged < 5 years with substantial 
parasite counts at baseline and in whom very limited naturally acquired immunity would be expected. 
In this study, in which all children received the same highly effective oral follow-on regimen, initial 
treatment with parenteral artesunate was more effective than initial treatment with parenteral quinine 
in terms of in-hospital mortality. In SEAQUAMAT, in which most subjects were adults, parenteral 
followed by oral artesunate was more effective than parenteral followed by oral quinine in terms of in-
hospital mortality.  
These studies support the efficacy of initial treatment of severe P. falciparum malaria with 2.4 mg/kg 
IV artesunate.  
The two efficacy studies that used the US Army artesunate for treatment of severe malaria had no 
active control arms. The most informative of these studies was not sponsored by the US Army but by 
MMV. This African study provided a direct comparison of 5 doses of 2.4 mg/kg with the first two doses 
given 12 h apart and 3 doses of 4 mg/kg given 24 h apart. The effect on parasite counts supported use 
of either dose regimen in children aged 6 months to 10 years with severe P. falciparum malaria.    
Overall, the demonstration of efficacy can be accepted. It is agreed that no lower or upper age or 
weight limits for use and the same weight-based dose regimen applies to all patients. It is also 
acceptable that the indication statement is not confined to P. falciparum, which causes most cases of 
severe malaria globally and which was the species involved in the vast majority of cases treated with 
IV artesunate in the clinical trials included in this application. There are other data, including in-vitro 
studies, supporting an expectation that IV artesunate will exert a similar antimalarial effect regardless 
of the exact species of Plasmodium. It is also acceptable that the indication refers to treatment of 
“severe malaria” to define patients who may benefit from initial treatment with IV artesunate since 
there is a broadly-accepted definition of severe malaria provided in WHO guidance documents and 
since the product will be used in patients who cannot be treated orally and after consultation with a 
physician with appropriate experience in the management of malaria.  
Safety of IV artesunate 
The appraisal of the safety of the applicant’s IV artesunate is not straightforward. The most reliable 
data come from the four studies sponsored by the US Army but none enrolled the target population 
with severe malaria. The most relevant data come from CDC-060. However, some AEs and ADRs seem 
to reflect the underlying infection, which in some patients showed worsening from baseline even if they 
recovered eventually and in other patients preceded death. Moreover, the timing of onset of some AEs 
and ADRs was after completion of initial IV artesunate, which makes the assessment of causality even 
more difficult. Nevertheless, it could be considered that the safety data from CDC-060 are more 
complete than the data reported from SEAQUAMAT and AQUAMAT using IV or IM Guilin artesunate, in 
Assessment report  
EMA/584728/2021  
Page 108/110 
 
 
 
 
 
which it may be concluded that investigators tended to report only AEs that could not be ascribed to 
the course of the disease. 
The overall opinion is that IV artesunate itself is probably not associated with major safety concerns 
but it clearly (as with all other pharmacological agents) carries a risk for hypersensitivity reactions, 
which may sometimes be severe. There seems to be a risk for headache, dizziness and dysgeusia. 
There is also possibly a risk for LFT increases over and above any reaction to severe malaria. Also, 
there seem to be early on-treatment drops in blood cell counts that recover quickly but with the 
additional risk of PADH with onset after successful recovery.  
Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been completely revised based on a detailed re-appraisal of SDRs 
reported across sponsored and published studies with IV artesunate preparations.  
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Artesunate Amivas is intended only for use in patients who require parenteral treatment for severe 
malaria. It is for use only so long as oral treatment is not possible, after which a full course of an 
appropriate regimen must be completed to achieve complete cure.  
With insertion of advice in section 4.2 of the SmPC to use the product only under appropriate 
supervision, it is anticipated that only those patients who need IV artesunate will receive it and they 
will receive the follow-on oral regimen appropriate to the infecting species.  
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Severe malaria carries a considerable mortality rate, even in returning travellers who are diagnosed 
and treated promptly and with access to intensive care as necessary. For the majority who survive, 
hospitalisation may be prolonged by development of complications. The available data have several 
shortcomings but the overall evidence supports a conclusion that IV artesunate is a highly effective 
treatment for severe and that the recommended posology has an acceptable safety profile.   
From the available data, the benefit-risk balance is favourable.  
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall benefit/risk balance of Artesunate Amivas is positive, subject to the conditions stated in 
section 4. ‘Recommendations’. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Artesunate Amivas is favourable in the following indication: 
“Artesunate Amivas is indicated for the initial treatment of severe malaria in adults and children (see 
sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Consideration should be given to official guidance on the appropriate use of antimalarial agents.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions:

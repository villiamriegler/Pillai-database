Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Edistride 
dapagliflozin 
On 24 September 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a 
positive opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Edistride, intended for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. The applicant for this medicinal 
product is AstraZeneca AB. 
Edistride will be available as 5 mg and 10 mg film-coated tablets. The active substance of Edistride 
is dapagliflozin, an oral blood glucose-lowering medicine (ATC code: A10BX09). Dapagliflozin is a 
competitive, reversible, selective and orally active inhibitor of sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 
(SGLT2). It improves fasting and post-prandial plasma glucose levels by reducing renal glucose re-
absorption leading to urinary glucose excretion. 
The benefits with Edistride are its ability to lower blood glucose by increasing urinary glucose 
excretion. The most common side effects are hypoglycaemia (when used with a sulphonylurea or 
insulin), urinary tract infection, genital tract infection, dyslipidaemia, dysuria and polyuria.  
The full indication is:  
"Edistride is indicated in adults aged 18 years and older with type 2 diabetes mellitus to improve 
glycaemic control as: 
Monotherapy 
When diet and exercise alone do not provide adequate glycaemic control in patients for whom use 
of metformin is considered inappropriate due to intolerance. 
Add-on combination therapy 
In combination with other glucose-lowering medicinal products including insulin, when these, 
together with diet and exercise, do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5 
and 5.1 for available data on different combinations).”

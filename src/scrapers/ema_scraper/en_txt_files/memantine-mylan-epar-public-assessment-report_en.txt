2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Memantine Mylan, 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets, is a generic medicinal product of Ebixa, which 
has been authorised in the EU since 15th May 2002. 
The active substance of Memantine Mylan is memantine hydrochloride, a psychoanaleptic anti-dementia 
drug (ATC code: N06DX01) for the treatment of moderate to severe Alzheimers disease. Memantine is an 
amantadine derivative and antagonist of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. 
The safety and efficacy profile of memantine has been demonstrated in several clinical trials, details of 
which can be found in the EPAR for Ebixa. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience 
contributing to the knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic 
application referring to the reference medicinal product Ebixa, a summary of the clinical data of 
memantine is available and no new clinical studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
efficacy and safety have been conducted. 
Memantine Mylan 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets have the same qualitative and quantitative 
composition, in terms of active substance, and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference product 
Ebixa. Bioequivalence of the 20 mg dose with the reference 20 mg Ebixa tablet was demonstrated 
clinically. Demonstration of bioequivalence of the 10 mg dose was waived since the drug substance is 
highly soluble, the two strengths are manufactured by the same method, and the compositions of the two 
strengths are quantitatively proportional. 
The indication proposed for Memantine Mylan is the same as authorized for the reference medicinal 
product, Ebixa. In addition to the pack presentations authorised for Ebixa, the applicant has applied for 7, 
10 and 60 tablet pack sizes for both strengths. The proposed pack sizes are consistent with the dosage 
regimen and duration of use of the reference medicinal product. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing 10 mg and 20 mg of memantine 
hydrochloride as active substance. The composition is described in section 6.1. of the SmPC. 
The product is available in PVdC clear film push through foil lidding blister packs. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
This medicinal product contains memantine hydrochloride as active substance. Memantine hydrochloride 
is a white to off-white crystalline powder soluble in water and methanol. The chemical name is 
3,5-dimethyl-1-adamantamine hydrochloride, 3,5-dimethyltricyclo-[3.3.1.1]-decan-1-amine 
hydrochloride, or 1-amino-3,5-dimethyladamantane hydrochloride. 
The structure of memantine hydrochloride was unambiguously confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR, FT-IR 
spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, elemental analysis, and XRPD.  
Memantine is achiral, therefore no stereoisomerism was observed. Polymorphism has been observed 
although the manufacturing process consistently produces the required crystalline form.

The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure within the current Marketing Authorisation Application. 
Manufacture 
The active substance is supplied by one active substance manufacturer. Detailed information about the 
manufacturing process, control of starting materials, reagents and solvents, control of critical steps and 
intermediates along with process development and validation for the active substance has been supplied 
in the form of an active substance master file (ASMF). Memantine hydrochloride is synthesized in three 
steps.  The manufacturing process is adequately described. Adequate in-process controls are in place and 
appropriate specifications have been adopted for the starting materials, solvents and reagents. All 
relevant impurities, degradation products and residual solvents have been appropriately characterised. 
Batch analysis data is provided on three consecutive production scale batches using the proposed 
synthetic route, and the batch analysis data show that the active ingredient can be manufactured 
reproducibly. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility, identity (IR, GC), water 
content (KF), residue on ignition, heavy metals, impurities (HPLC), assay (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), 
chloride content (titrimetry), bulk density (tapped and un-tapped), and particle size (Malvern).The 
specifications and tests proposed are compliant with the relevant ICH guidelines and general 
requirements of Ph.Eur. The specifications are adequate to control the quality of the active substance. The 
impurity limits are acceptable and there is no concern from the point of view of safety.  
Batch analysis data on three commercial scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results 
comply with the proposed specification specifications and confirm consistency and uniformity of the active 
substance manufacture. 
Stability 
Four commercial scale batches of the active substance packed in the intended commercial package from 
the ASMF holder were put on stability testing as per ICH conditions: three batches were stored under long 
term conditions (25 °C / 60% RH) for 60 months, and under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) for 
6 months. A further batch was stored under long term conditions (25 °C / 60% RH) for 12 months, and 
under accelerated conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) for 6 months. Stability was also tested under stressed 
conditions in solution: acid hydrolysis; base hydrolysis, oxidation (peroxide); heat degradation (60 oC) 
and UV light. Solid state stability was investigated by exposure to white fluorescent light, UV light (365 
nm), and heat degradation (105 oC).   
The following parameters were tested: description (identity by IR; GC and XRPD); clarity and colour of 
solution; water content (KF); related substances (GC); assay (HPLC). The active substance is stable 
under all conditions, except that it undergoes rapid degradation on exposure to peroxide and slow 
degradation on exposure to base at 60 oC. In conclusion, no special storage conditions are required. 
The stability studies indicate that the drug substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is 
sufficiently stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Pharmaceutical development 
The objectives of formulation development were to develop an immediate-release memantine 
hydrochloride tablet bioequivalent to the reference Ebixa tablets. Furthermore, compositionally 
proportional formulations for 10 mg and 20 mg strengths were required, along with acceptable content 
uniformity, rapid and complete active substance release, and adequate product stability throughout the 
intended shelf-life. The qualitative composition is similar to that of Ebixa with the addition of talc and 
different colour coating for the 20 mg strength. 
The active substance is a crystalline solid, routinely manufactured as form I with consistent particle size 
distribution. It is highly soluble in all tested media from pH 1.1-7.4 (BCS class I), and the dissolution 
characteristics were shown to depend on its inherent solubility, rather than the composition of excipients, 
since changes to the formulation and tablet hardness had little effect on solubility. Dissolution rates were 
demonstrated as equivalent to the reference product. Both Ebixa and Memantine Mylan are immediate 
release tablets with functionally similar excipients, similar physico-chemical properties, and similar 
dissolution profiles. Thus, the physico-chemical properties of the active substance are unlikely to have 
any impact on therapeutic equivalence. No compatibility issue between drug substance and excipients 
was observed during development 
Memantine Mylan 10 mg and 20 mg film-coated tablets have the same quantitative and qualitative 
composition in active substance and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference product. 
Bioequivalence was demonstrated by comparing 20 mg Memantine Mylan tablets with 20 mg Ebixa 
tablets. The bioequivalence of the 10 mg strength was waived since its manufacture and proportional 
composition is the same as the 20 mg strength. 
All the chosen excipients are well-known, and widely used in film-coated tablets. The excipients include: 
microcrystalline cellulose (filler); croscarmellose sodium (disintegrant); magnesium stearate (lubricant); 
micronized talc (glidant); colloidal anhydrous silica (glidant), and film-coating agents (yellow Opadry II, 
red Opadry II and clear Opadry). All the excipients are controlled in accordance with Ph. Eur. monographs 
except for the coating agents which meet in-house specifications. 
Direct compression and high shear wet granulation were first investigated for tablet manufacture. 
However, as a result of poor flowability and low assay values, a dry granulation roller compaction method 
was selected which gave acceptable content uniformity, hardness, and assay results.The film-coated 
tablets are packaged in blisters comprised of PVC-PVdC clear film with a foil push-through lidding material 
to seal the film surface. The material complies with Ph.Eur. requirements and is adequate to support the 
stability and use of the product. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
Manufacture of the product 
The finished product is manufactured by dry granulation and the manufacturing process consists of 
dispensing, screening, final blending, compression, coating and packaging. A description and flow 
diagram of the manufacturing process is provided. The manufacturing process is considered standard. 
Memantine Mylan  
EMA/CHMP/91208/2013 
Page 9/21 
  
  
 
The manufacturing process has been validated by a number of studies for the major steps of the 
manufacturing process using three batches of each strength and is satisfactory. The in process controls 
are adequate for this product. 
The batch analysis data provided show that this tablet can be manufactured reproducibly according to the 
agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation.The applicant 
committed to perform process validation studies on the first three production scale batches at the 
proposed commercial batch size. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specification includes appropriate tests for appearance (visual description), 
identification (HPLC and IR), assay (HPLC), uniformity of dosage unit (HPLC), dissolution, water content 
(KF), related compounds (HPLC), and microbiological quality (Ph.Eur.).  
Batch analysis results from two pilot scale batches of the 10 mg strength and two pilot scale batches of 
the 20 mg strength confirm consistency and uniformity of manufacture and indicate that the process is 
capable and under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from two pilot scale batches of the 10 mg strength in proposed commercial packaging 
stored under long-term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 12 months and under accelerated 
conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 24 weeks according to ICH guidelines were provided. Additionally, 
stability data from two pilot scale batches of the 20 mg strength in proposed commercial packaging stored 
under long-term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for up to 12 months, under intermediate conditions (30 ºC 
/ 65% RH) for up to 12 months, and under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) for up to 24 weeks 
according to ICH guidelines were provided. 
Samples were tested for appearance, dissolution, assay, related compounds, and water content. The 
analytical procedures used were stability indicating.  
The applicant commits to further testing at up to 36 months under long-term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) 
for each of the aforementioned batches. 
Furthermore, the applicant has carried out stability studies on the bulk drug product intermediates to 
justify holding times of longer than 30 days and ensure stability in the in-process container closure 
system. 
The CHMP recommends that the  applicant further tests the bulk drug product intermediate on 
commercial batches at up to 12 months under long-term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for commercial 
batches post-opinion. 
In addition, two batches of each strength of drug product were exposed to both UV and visible light as 
defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. No 
significant changes in Memantine Mylan film-coated tablet quality attributes were observed and thus, the 
product is not sensitive to light. 
The breakability of the scored 10 mg tablets was also assessed after storage under long-term conditions 
(25 ºC / 60% RH) after 12 months, given an observed increase in water content on long-term storage, 
and found to be acceptable. The applicant is recommended to further breakability testing after 18 and 24 
months, and thereafter, annually until the end of shelf-life. 
Memantine Mylan  
EMA/CHMP/91208/2013 
Page 10/21 
  
  
 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
In the context of the obligation of MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: 
• 
The applicant is recommended to further testing of bulk drug product intermediate at up to 
12 months under long-term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) for commercial batches 
post-opinion. This is to give further confidence that the bulk intermediate can be held for up 
to 1 year under the proposed in-process storage conditions without detrimental effects on 
finished product quality. The bulk intermediate stability has already been demonstrated on 
pilot batches up to 9 months. 
• 
Taking into account the increase in the water content of the product during storage, the 
applicant is recommended to perform subdivision testing on lots 1000769 and 1000770 of 
scored 10 mg tablets after 18 and 24 months, and thereafter, annually until the end of 
shelf-life. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature on the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology was provided. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics (PK) and toxicology data. The non-clinical 
aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been 
discussed and was considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
Memantine Mylan  
EMA/CHMP/91208/2013 
Page 11/21 
  
  
 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the 
introduction of Memantine Mylan manufactured by Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. is considered unlikely to 
result in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all memantine containing products 
and the exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the environmental risk is expected to 
be similar and not increased. The CHMP endorsed this view. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
N/A 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview presented by the applicant is largely based on published scientific literature 
which is acceptable since memantine is a well-known active substance. There are no objections to the 
approval of Memantine Mylan from a non-clinical point of view. The SmPC of Memantine Mylan is similar 
to that of the originator product Ebixa and is therefore acceptable. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
Introduction 
This is a generic application for film-coated tablets containing memantine. To support the marketing 
authorisation application the applicant conducted two bioequivalence studies with parallel design under 
fasting conditions with the 20 mg strength (study MEMA-11225 and study MEMA-12036). Study 
MEMA-12036 was the pivotal study for this application. 
No formal scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1/Corr**) is of 
particular relevance. 
GCP 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Exemption  
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (Doc. Ref.: CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1/ Corr **), if the pharmacokinetic of the active substance is linear and that the bioequivalence is 
demonstrated for one strength, in vivo bioequivalence studies for the other strengths could be waived. An 
exemption from the requirement to perform bioequivalence studies would be justified when the following 
conditions are met: the pharmaceutical products have the same manufacturer, same qualitative 
composition, same ratio between active substance and excipients and in vitro dissolution profile 
comparable to the reference product. 
Memantine Mylan  
EMA/CHMP/91208/2013 
Page 12/21 
  
  
 
A biowaiver has been applied for the 10 mg strength. The applicant provided a tabular listing of the 
composition of the two strengths and their dissolution curves at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8. Similarity factors 
were not calculated because more than 85% of the drug was dissolved within 15 minutes at all pH values 
tested. 
Based on these results, the CHMP concluded that the general biowaiver criteria were met. Therefore, one 
bioequivalence study with the highest dose of 20 mg and a biowaiver for the additional strength was 
considered adequate. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant  submitted two bioequivalence studies (MEMA-11225 and 
MEMA-12036).,Neither pharmacodymanic studies, nor therapeutic equivalence studies were submitted. 
The applicant conducted two studies as the lower 90% CI for log transformed AUC0-72 was narrowly 
outside (79.71-101.61%) the acceptable bioequivalence limit (80-125%) for the first study 
(MEMA-11225). The applicant stated that this issue was due to the inter-subject variability (20.43%) and 
that the relative geometric least square mean ratio of the test and reference observed for 
pharmacokinetic parameter LnAUC0-72 in the study was larger than the anticipated (16%), therefore, a 
sample size of 32 subjects was considered not adequate to meet the required bioequivalence standards.

investigating the bioequivalence of Mylan’s Memantine hydrochloride film-coated tablets, 20 mg to H. 
Lundbeck A/S’ Ebixa® 20 mg film-coated tablets in adult subjects under fasting conditions. 
Blood samples were collected within 120 minutes prior to dose administration (0 hour) and after dose 
administration at study hours : 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 18, 24, 36, 48, and 72 hours. 
Memantine was analysed in plasma 
Test and reference products  
Study MEMA-11225 and Study MEMA-12036 
Memantine Mylan 20 mg film coated tablet manufactured by Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. Lot No.: 
2003060 (Batch No.1000771), manufacturing date 06/10/2011; exp. date 10/2014) has been compared 
to Ebixa 20 mg film coated tablet manufactured by H. Lundbeck A/S (Batch No: 052230, exp. date 
30/09/2014). 
Population studied  
Study MEMA-11225 
Assuming a true ratio between 0.94 and 1.06 and an inter-subject variability of 16% or less for Cmax, a 
minimum of 28 subjects was required to conclude bioequivalence with approximately 80% power. To 
account for subject withdrawal and dropouts due to adverse events, non-compliance or personal reasons, 
32 subjects were planned to be randomized and dosed. The data from thirty-two subjects (Subjects 1-32) 
were included in the pharmacokinetic and statistical analysis. 
Thirty-two (32) healthy, non-tobacco using subjects were enrolled in the study. 
The number of protocol deviations was similar in the reference group (6 meal deviation and 7 PK sample 
collection deviation) than in the test group (5 meal deviation and 6 PK sample collection deviation). 
Study MEMA-12036 
Assuming a true ratio between 0.93 and 1.07 and an inter-subject variability of 21% or less for Cmax and 
AUC0-t, a minimum of 60 subjects were required to conclude bioequivalence with approximately 80% 
power. To account for subject withdrawal and dropouts due to adverse events, non-compliance or 
personal reasons, 64 subjects were planned to be randomized and dosed.  
Sixty-four healthy subjects were enrolled in the study.

Subject 29 (test group) was excluded from the bioanalysis of plasma sample and pharmacokinetic 
analysis as they did not return to the clinical facility for blood sample collection 72 hour time point and 
hence truncated AUC 72 could not be calculated precisely for the subject. There was 1 other protocol 
deviation in the test group and 3 in the reference group. 
Analytical methods 
Study MEMA-11225 and Study MEMA-12036 
Pre-study validation 
The assay employed a LC-MS/MS method for the determination of memantine in K2EDTA. The complete 
analytical method (Project # 09-022-02 dated on March 19th, 2012) associated with this validation was 
provided. The method validation was performed in accordance with SOP L-301-06, which fulfils the 
acceptance criteria in US FDA, May 2001. The method was validated over the concentration range of 
0.4 ng/mL to 40.0 ng/mL. A weighting of 1/c2 was used. 
In-study validation 
Biostudy samples were assayed using HPLC-MS/MS in K2EDTA plasma. The method used a standard 
range of 0.4 ng/mL to 40 ng/mL. A weighted (1/c2) linear regression was used. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
Study MEMA-11225 and Study MEMA-12036 
Single-dose pharmacokinetic parameters for Memantine were calculated using non-compartmental 
method. The primary pharmacokinetic variables for assessment of bioequivalence are Cmax and AUC0-72. 
The secondary pharmacokinetic variable was Tmax. 
Statistical methods   
Study MEMA-11225 and Study MEMA-12036 
Statistical analyses were performed on the pharmacokinetic parameters of Memantine using the General 
Linear Models Procedure (PROC GLM) of SAS Software (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). The model tests for 
treatment effects in the parameter means at an alpha level of 0.05. The parameters’ Tmax was analysed 
statistically using the non-transformed data. The natural log transformed parameters AUC0-72 and Cmax 
were statistically analyzed. The tests were performed to analyze for statistically significant differences in 
the pharmacokinetic parameters using Least Squares Means. Ninety percent confidence intervals 
(90%CI) were constructed for Cmax and AUC0-72 using the two one-sided tests procedure to assess 
average bioequivalence between the two products. 
Assessment of bioequivalence was conforming to the Regulatory requirements set forth by the region of 
submission. The primary pharmacokinetic variables for assessment of bioequivalence were Cmax and 
AUC0-72. The primary assessment of bioequivalence was based on the 90% confidence interval of the ratio 
(T/R) of least-squares means from the ANOVA of the natural log transformed Cmax and AUC0-72 being 
within 80% - 125%.

Safety data 
Study MEMA-11225  
Seven subjects experienced a total of 8 adverse events (AEs) over the course of the study. All 8 AEs were 
considered mild in severity. No AE was reported more than once following administration of the test 
treatment. The most frequently reported AE following administration of the reference treatment was 
headache, which was reported by 2/16 (12.5%) subjects. No AEs were reported during post-study 
procedures. No SAEs were reported. 
Study MEMA-12036 
Twelve subjects experienced a total of twenty-one adverse events (AEs) over the course of the study. All 
adverse events were considered mild in severity. Dizziness, headache and neutrophil count decreased 
were the most frequent AE experienced by subjects following administration of test treatment and were 
each reported by 2/32 (6.3%) subjects. The most frequently reported AE following administration of 
reference treatment was headache and dyspnoea which were each reported by 2/32 (6.3%) subjects. 
There were 8 AEs considered possibly related to the study medication in both groups. There was 1 AE 
(euphoric mood) considered probably related to the oral administration of Ebixa 20 mg film-coated tablets 
(H. Lundbeck A/S). No serious adverse events were reported. 
Conclusions 
Study MEMA-11225 
This study was not sufficient to conclude on the bioequivalence of Memantine Mylan as AUC(0-72h) 90% 
confidence interval being slightly outside of the accepted range with Ebixa. The results of this study with 
the 20 mg formulation are considered supportive. 
Study MEMA-12036 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study, Memantine Mylan 20 mg tablet is considered bioequivalent 
with Ebixa 20 mg tablet. 
The results of study MEMA-12036 with the 20 mg formulation can be extrapolated to the 10 mg strength, 
according to conditions in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev.1/Corr**, section 4.1.6.

Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
Discussion on clinical aspects 
In this application no new efficacy or safety data were submitted and none are required. The applicant  
provided an acceptable review of clinical trials published in literature, describing the efficacy and safety 
profile of Memantine Mylan. No new dose recommendations compared with the reference product were 
made for this generic application. 
Bioequivalence studies 
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ Corr 
**) although a two-period, cross-over design is recommended, alternative well-established designs can 
be accepted in certain cases (i.e., long half-life products) provided that they are scientifically sound and 
that the statistical analysis is, too. Memantine exhibits linear and dose proportional pharmacokinetics 
over the dose range of 10 to 40 mg after oral administration with a terminal t 1/2 of 60 to 100 hours and 
as described in the innovator’s SmPC there is no indication that food influences the absorption of 
Memantine, therefore one parallel single dose in fasting condition at the highest strength could be 
accepted. 
For both studies, the study population, with regards to demographic characteristics and the exclusion and 
exclusion criteria were considered acceptable. Considering the expected time to peak concentration (3-8 
hours) and the elimination half-life of Memantine, the sampling schedule and the sampling time period 
truncated at 72 hours is acceptable to estimate PK parameters. The test and reference product are 
adequate for a generic application. Protocol deviations were reported, however these are not considered 
to impact on study validity. There were no concomitant medications. Statement on GLP compliance and 
bio-analytical audits were given. There were no subjects excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis in 
the first study. In study MEMA-12036 subject 29 was excluded from the pharmacokinetic analysis, this is 
considered acceptable as it was pre-specified in the study protocol. 
For both studies, the pre-study validation of the analytical method was satisfactory. The in-study 
validation showed an acceptable calibration standards and QC values (in all runs for both studies, there 
were no calibration standards outside the acceptance criteria and only two QCs were rejected for study 
MEMA-12036). The LLOQ (0.40 ng/mL) was lower than 5% of the minimum Cmax (0.90 ng/mL and 
0.97ng/mL respectively for study 11225 and 12036). The reasons for re-analysis of samples were 
acceptable. Dilution samples were necessary (1/5 dilution was validated). In both studies, the study 
samples were analysed, with a calibration curve, and four of non-zero QCs in duplicate (8 QCs). Since 
study samples from three subjects (57 samples) were analysed in each run, the number of QCs samples 
relative to the number of study samples is adequate. Incurred Sample Reproducibility is acceptable. 
Chromatograms of calibrators, QCs, and subject samples (and corresponding sample sequences) from at 
least 20% of the subject samples analysed were included (from subject 01 to subject 09, both inclusive). 
The pharmacokinetic software employed was not specified. Pharmacokinetics variables were appropriate 
for a single dose bioequivalence study. The non-compartmental linear-trapezoidal rule for calculation was 
adequate. AUC truncated at 72 hours was acceptable for drugs with a long half-life.

The statistical software and method is considered acceptable. Using PROC GLM of SAS Software (SAS 
Institute, Cary, NC) was acceptable. ANOVA analysis was performed correctly and linear and log-linear 
plots were submitted. 
Based on the statistical analysis submitted by the Applicant for study 11225, the test product was not 
considered equivalent to the reference with respect to the extent of exposure. The 90% confidence 
intervals calculated for AUC0-72 of Memantine was narrowly out of the normal range of acceptability 
(80.00 – 125.00). As the applicant stated, this was probably due to differences in subjects of the two 
treatment groups since this is a parallel design were randomization is not able to ensure sensitivity 
between groups due to the small sample size. 
However, based on the statistical analysis of the pivotal study (12036) the test product was found 
equivalent to the reference product with respect to the extent and rate of absorption/exposure as the 
90% confidence intervals for the ln-transformed Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-∞ are within the acceptance range 
of 80-125%. 
The safety profile of both products was considered to be comparable, although the design was not 
powered to compare the safety profile. No difference in the safety profile can be anticipated. 
Biowaiver for additional strength 
The general biowaiver criteria are met and the pharmacokinetics over the therapeutic dose range is 
linear. Therefore, a biowaiver for the additional strength is adequate. 
Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the results of the pivotal bioequivalence study submitted, Memantine Mylan 10 mg and 20mg 
film-coated tablets are considered bioequivalent with Ebixa 10mg and 20mg film-coated tablets. 
2.5.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the applicant fulfils the 
legislative requirements.  
Risk management plan 
The CHMP did not require the applicant to submit a risk management plan because the product is a 
generic of a well-known active substance, already on the market for more than 20 years. 
PSUR submission 
The CHMP considered that PSUR submission is not required for generics of this active substance. 
However, the marketing authorisation holder shall submit periodic safety update reports for this 
medicinal product if the product were to be included in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) 
provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC and published on the European medicines 
web-portal.

User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the 
basis of a bridging report making reference to Ebixa. The bridging report submitted by the applicant 
has been found to be acceptable, since the safety messages are the same as for the reference product 
and the wording, design, and layout have no impact on readability. 
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of Memantine film-coated tablet. The reference product 
Ebixa is indicated in the treatment of adults with for moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease. No 
nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a 
clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics nor on the efficacy and safety of the active substance. The applicant’s clinical 
overview on these clinical aspects, based on information from published literature, was considered 
sufficient. 
The bioequivalence studies form the pivotal basis with a parallel, randomised, open label, two 
treatment, single dose, single period design under fasting condition. The studies’ design was 
considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this formulation and was in line with the 
respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, overall sampling time as well as 
wash-out periods were adequate. The analytical method was validated. Pharmacokinetic and statistical 
methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Memantine Mylan met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when 
compared with the Ebixa. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters 
AUC0-72 and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range of [range, e.g. 80.00 
to 125.00%]. Bioequivalence of the two formulations was demonstrated. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen 
reference medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are 
required beyond those included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers that the benefit-risk 
balance of Memantine Mylan in the treatment of patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer’s disease is 
favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the

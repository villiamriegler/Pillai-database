CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Trajenta is indicated in adults with type 2 diabetes mellitus as an adjunct to diet and exercise to 
improve glycaemic control as:
monotherapy
•
combination therapy
•
when metformin is inappropriate due to intolerance, or contraindicated due to renal impairment.
in combination with other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes, including insulin, 
when these do not provide adequate glycaemic control (see sections 4.4, 4.5 and 5.1 for 
available data on different combinations).
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Posology
The dose of linagliptin is 5 mg once daily. When linagliptin is added to metformin, the dose of 
metformin should be maintained, and linagliptin administered concomitantly.
When linagliptin is used in combination with a sulphonylurea or with insulin, a lower dose of the 
sulphonylurea or insulin, may be considered to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia (see section 4.4)
Special populations
Renal impairment
For patients with renal impairment, no dose adjustment for linagliptin is required.
Hepatic impairment
Pharmacokinetic studies suggest that no dose adjustment is required for patients with hepatic 
impairment but clinical experience in such patients is lacking.
Elderly
No dose adjustment is necessary based on age.
Paediatric population
A clinical trial did not establish efficacy in paediatric patients 10 to 17 years of age (see section 4.8, 
5.1 and 5.2). Therefore, treatment of children and adolescents with linagliptin is not recommended. 
Linagliptin has not been studied in paediatric patients under 10 years of age.
2
Method of administration
The tablets can be taken with or without a meal at any time of the day. If a dose is missed, it should be 
taken as soon as the patient remembers. A double dose should not be taken on the same day.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
General
Linagliptin should not be used in patients with type 1 diabetes or for the treatment of diabetic 
ketoacidosis.
Hypoglycaemia
Linagliptin alone showed a comparable incidence of hypoglycaemia to placebo.
In clinical trials of linagliptin as part of combination therapy with medicinal products not known to 
cause hypoglycaemia (metformin), rates of hypoglycaemia reported with linagliptin were similar to 
rates in patients taking placebo.
When linagliptin was added to a sulphonylurea (on a background of metformin), the incidence of 
hypoglycaemia was increased over that of placebo (see section 4.8).
Sulphonylureas and insulin are known to cause hypoglycaemia. Therefore, caution is advised when 
linagliptin is used in combination with a sulphonylurea and/or insulin. A dose reduction of the 
sulphonylurea or insulin may be considered (see section 4.2).
Acute pancreatitis
Use of DPP-4 inhibitors has been associated with a risk of developing acute pancreatitis. Acute 
pancreatitis has been observed in patients taking linagliptin. In a cardiovascular and renal safety study 
(CARMELINA) with median observation period of 2.2 years, adjudicated acute pancreatitis was 
reported in 0.3% of patients treated with linagliptin and in 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.
Patients should be informed of the characteristic symptoms of acute pancreatitis. If pancreatitis is 
suspected, Trajenta should be discontinued; if acute pancreatitis is confirmed, Trajenta should not be 
restarted. Caution should be exercised in patients with a history of pancreatitis.
Bullous pemphigoid
Bullous pemphigoid has been observed in patients taking linagliptin. In the CARMELINA study, 
bullous pemphigoid was reported in 0.2% of patients on treatment with linagliptin and in no patient on 
placebo. If bullous pemphigoid is suspected, Trajenta should be discontinued.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
In vitro assessment of interactions
Linagliptin is a weak competitive and a weak to moderate mechanism-based inhibitor of CYP isozyme 
CYP3A4, but does not inhibit other CYP isozymes. It is not an inducer of CYP isozymes.
Linagliptin is a P-glycoprotein substrate, and inhibits P-glycoprotein mediated transport of digoxin 
with low potency. Based on these results and in vivo interaction studies, linagliptin is considered 
unlikely to cause interactions with other P-gp substrates.
In vivo assessment of interactions
Effects of other medicinal products on linagliptin
Clinical data described below suggest that the risk for clinically meaningful interactions by 
co-administered medicinal products is low.
Rifampicin: multiple co-administration of 5 mg linagliptin with rifampicin, a potent inductor of 
P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, resulted in a 39.6% and 43.8% decreased linagliptin steady-state AUC 
3
and Cmax, respectively, and about 30% decreased DPP-4 inhibition at trough. Thus, full efficacy of 
linagliptin in combination with strong P-gp inducers might not be achieved, particularly if these are 
administered long-term. Co-administration with other potent inducers of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, 
such as carbamazepine, phenobarbital and phenytoin has not been studied.
Ritonavir: co-administration of a single 5 mg oral dose of linagliptin and multiple 200 mg oral doses 
of ritonavir, a potent inhibitor of P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, increased the AUC and Cmax of 
linagliptin approximately twofold and threefold, respectively. The unbound concentrations, which are 
usually less than 1% at the therapeutic dose of linagliptin, were increased 4-5-fold after co-
administration with ritonavir. Simulations of steady-state plasma concentrations of linagliptin with and 
without ritonavir indicated that the increase in exposure will be not associated with an increased 
accumulation. These changes in linagliptin pharmacokinetics were not considered to be clinically 
relevant. Therefore, clinically relevant interactions would not be expected with other 
P-glycoprotein/CYP3A4 inhibitors.
Metformin: co-administration of multiple three times daily doses of 850 mg metformin with 10 mg 
linagliptin once daily did not clinical meaningfully alter the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin in healthy 
volunteers.
Sulphonylureas: the steady-state pharmacokinetics of 5 mg linagliptin was not changed by 
concomitant administration of a single 1.75 mg dose glibenclamide (glyburide).
Effects of linagliptin on other medicinal products
In clinical studies, as described below, linagliptin had no clinically relevant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of metformin, glyburide, simvastatin, warfarin, digoxin or oral contraceptives 
providing in vivo evidence of a low propensity for causing medicinal product interactions with 
substrates of CYP3A4, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, P-glycoprotein, and organic cationic transporter (OCT).
Metformin: co-administration of multiple daily doses of 10 mg linagliptin with 850 mg metformin, an 
OCT substrate, had no relevant effect on the pharmacokinetics of metformin in healthy volunteers. 
Therefore, linagliptin is not an inhibitor of OCT-mediated transport.
Sulphonylureas: co-administration of multiple oral doses of 5 mg linagliptin and a single oral dose of 
1.75 mg glibenclamide (glyburide) resulted in clinically not relevant reduction of 14% of both AUC 
and Cmax of glibenclamide. Because glibenclamide is primarily metabolised by CYP2C9, these data 
also support the conclusion that linagliptin is not a CYP2C9 inhibitor. Clinically meaningful 
interactions would not be expected with other sulphonylureas (e.g., glipizide, tolbutamide, and 
glimepiride) which, like glibenclamide, are primarily eliminated by CYP2C9.
Digoxin: co-administration of multiple daily doses of 5 mg linagliptin with multiple doses of 0.25 mg 
digoxin had no effect on the pharmacokinetics of digoxin in healthy volunteers. Therefore, linagliptin 
is not an inhibitor of P-glycoprotein-mediated transport in vivo.
Warfarin: multiple daily doses of 5 mg linagliptin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of S(-) or R(+) 
warfarin, a CYP2C9 substrate, administered in a single dose.
Simvastatin: multiple daily doses of linagliptin had a minimal effect on the steady-state 
pharmacokinetics of simvastatin, a sensitive CYP3A4 substrate, in healthy volunteers. Following 
administration of a supratherapeutic dose of 10 mg linagliptin concomitantly with 40 mg of 
simvastatin daily for 6 days, the plasma AUC of simvastatin was increased by 34%, and the plasma 
Cmax by 10%.
Oral contraceptives: co-administration with 5 mg linagliptin did not alter the steady-state 
pharmacokinetics of levonorgestrel or ethinylestradiol.

Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Pregnancy
The use of linagliptin has not been studied in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct 
or indirect harmful effects with respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary 
measure, it is preferable to avoid the use of linagliptin during pregnancy.
Breast-feeding
Available pharmacokinetic data in animals have shown excretion of linagliptin/metabolites in milk. A
risk to the breast-fed child cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue 
breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from linagliptin therapy taking into account the benefit of 
breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman.
Fertility
No studies on the effect on human fertility have been conducted for linagliptin. Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to fertility (see section 5.3).
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
Linagliptin has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines. However patients 
should be alerted to the risk of hypoglycaemia especially when combined with sulphonylurea and/or 
insulin.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
In the pooled analysis of the placebo-controlled trials, the overall incidence of adverse events in 
patients treated with placebo was similar to linagliptin 5 mg (63.4% versus 59.1%).
Discontinuation of therapy due to adverse events was higher in patients who received placebo as 
compared to linagliptin 5 mg (4.3% versus 3.4%).
The most frequently reported adverse reaction was “hypoglycaemia” observed under the triple 
combination, linagliptin plus metformin plus sulphonylurea 14.8% versus 7.6% in placebo.
In the placebo-controlled studies 4.9% of patients experienced “hypoglycaemia” as an adverse 
reaction under linagliptin. Of these, 4.0% were mild and 0.9% were moderate and 0.1% were 
classified as severe in intensity. Pancreatitis was reported more often in patients randomized to 
linagliptin (7 events in 6 580 patients receiving linagliptin versus 2 events in 4 383 patients receiving 
placebo).
Tabulated list of adverse reactions
Due to the impact of the background therapy on adverse reactions (e.g. on hypoglycaemias), adverse 
reactions were analysed based on the respective treatment regimens (monotherapy, add-on to 
metformin, add-on to meformin plus sulphonylurea, and add-on to insulin).
The placebo-controlled studies included studies where linagliptin was given as

Linagliptin cardiovascular and renal safety study (CARMELINA)
The CARMELINA study evaluated the cardiovascular and renal safety of linagliptin versus placebo in 
patients with type 2 diabetes and with increased CV risk evidenced by a history of established 
macrovascular or renal disease (see section 5.1). The study included 3 494 patients treated with
linagliptin (5 mg) and 3 485 patients treated with placebo. Both treatments were added to standard of 
care targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. The overall incidence of adverse 
events and serious adverse events in patients receiving linagliptin was similar to that in patients 
receiving placebo. Safety data from this study was in line with previous known safety profile of 
linagliptin.
In the treated population, severe hypoglycaemic events (requiring assistance) were reported in 3.0% of 
patients on linagliptin and in 3.1% on placebo. Among patients who were using sulfonylurea at 
baseline, the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia was 2.0% in linagliptin-treated patients and 1.7% in 
placebo treated patients. Among patients who were using insulin at baseline, the incidence of severe 
hypoglycaemia was 4.4% in linagliptin-treated patients and 4.9% in placebo treated patients.
In the overall study observation period adjudicated acute pancreatitis was reported in 0.3% of patients 
treated with linagliptin and in 0.1% of patients treated with placebo.
In the CARMELINA study, bullous pemphigoid was reported in 0.2% of patients treated with 
linagliptin and in no patient treated with placebo.
6
Paediatric population
Overall, in clinical trials in paediatric patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus aged 10 to 17 years, the 
safety profile of linagliptin was similar to that observed in the adult population.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
Symptoms
During controlled clinical trials in healthy subjects, single doses of up to 600 mg linagliptin 
(equivalent to 120 times the recommended dose) were generally well tolerated. There is no experience 
with doses above 600 mg in humans.
Therapy
In the event of an overdose, it is reasonable to employ the usual supportive measures, e.g., remove 
unabsorbed material from the gastrointestinal tract, employ clinical monitoring and institute clinical 
measures if required.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors, 
ATC code: A10BH05
Mechanism of action
Linagliptin is an inhibitor of the enzyme DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase 4, EC 3.4.14.5) an enzyme 
which is involved in the inactivation of the incretin hormones GLP-1 and GIP (glucagon-like 
peptide-1, glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide). These hormones are rapidly degraded by the 
enzyme DPP-4. Both incretin hormones are involved in the physiological regulation of glucose 
homeostasis. Incretins are secreted at a low basal level throughout the day and levels rise immediately 
after meal intake. GLP-1 and GIP increase insulin biosynthesis and secretion from pancreatic beta 
cells in the presence of normal and elevated blood glucose levels. Furthermore GLP-1 also reduces 
glucagon secretion from pancreatic alpha cells, resulting in a reduction in hepatic glucose output. 
Linagliptin binds very effectively to DPP-4 in a reversible manner and thus leads to a sustained 
increase and a prolongation of active incretin levels. Linagliptin glucose-dependently increases insulin 
secretion and lowers glucagon secretion thus resulting in an overall improvement in the glucose 
homeostasis. Linagliptin binds selectively to DPP-4 and exhibits a > 10 000 fold selectivity versus 
DPP-8 or DPP-9 activity in vitro.
Clinical efficacy and safety
8 phase III randomised controlled trials involving 5 239 patients with type 2 diabetes, of which 3 319 
were treated with linagliptin were conducted to evaluate efficacy and safety. These studies had 
929 patients of 65 years and over who were on linagliptin. There were also 1 238 patients with mild 
renal impairment, and 143 patients with moderate renal impairment on linagliptin. Linagliptin once 
daily produced clinically significant improvements in glycaemic control, with no clinically relevant 
change in body weight. The reductions in glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were similar across 
different subgroups including gender, age, renal impairment and body mass index (BMI). Higher 
baseline HbA1c was associated with a greater reduction in HbA1c. There was a significant difference in 
reduction in HbA1c between Asian patients (0.8%) and White patients (0.5%) in the pooled studies.

Linagliptin as monotherapy in patients ineligible for metformin
The efficacy and safety of linagliptin monotherapy was evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled 
study of 24 weeks duration. Treatment with once daily linagliptin at 5 mg provided a significant 
improvement in HbA1c (-0.69% change compared to placebo), in patients with baseline HbA1c of 
approximately 8%. Linagliptin also showed significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose 
(FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG) compared to placebo. The observed incidence of 
hypoglycaemia in patients treated with linagliptin was similar to placebo.
The efficacy and safety of linagliptin monotherapy was also evaluated in patients for whom metformin 
therapy is inappropriate, due to intolerability or contraindicated due to renal impairment, in a double-
blind placebo-controlled study of 18 weeks duration. Linagliptin provided significant improvements in 
HbA1c, (-0.57% change compared to placebo), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.09%. Linagliptin also 
showed significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG) compared to placebo. The observed 
incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with linagliptin was similar to placebo.
Linagliptin as add-on to metformin therapy
The efficacy and safety of linagliptin in combination with metformin was evaluated in a double-blind 
placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks duration. Linagliptin provided significant improvements in 
HbA1c, (-0.64% change compared to placebo), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8%. Linagliptin also 
showed significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose 
(PPG) compared to placebo. The observed incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with 
linagliptin was similar to placebo.
Linagliptin as add-on to a combination of metformin and sulphonylurea therapy
A placebo-controlled study of 24 weeks in duration was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety 
of linagliptin 5 mg to placebo, in patients not sufficiently treated with a combination with metformin 
and a sulphonylurea. Linagliptin provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-0.62% change 
compared to placebo), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.14%. Linagliptin also showed significant 
improvements in patients fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and 2-hour post-prandial glucose (PPG), 
compared to placebo.
Linagliptin as add-on to a combination of metformin and empagliflozin therapy
In patients inadequately controlled with metformin and empagliflozin (10 mg (n = 247) or 25 mg 
(n = 217)), 24-weeks treatment with add-on therapy of linagliptin 5 mg provided adjusted mean HbA1c
reductions from baseline by -0.53% (significant difference to add-on placebo -0.32% (95% 
CI -0.52, -0.13) and -0.58% (significant difference to add-on placebo -0.47% (95% CI -0.66; -0.28), 
respectively. A statistically significant greater proportion of patients with a baseline HbA1c ≥ 7.0% and 
treated with linagliptin 5 mg achieved a target HbA1c of < 7% compared to placebo.
Linagliptin as add-on to insulin therapy
The efficacy and safety of the addition of linagliptin 5 mg to insulin alone or in combination with 
metformin and/or pioglitazone has been evaluated in a double-blind placebo-controlled study of 
24 weeks duration. Linagliptin provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-0.65% compared to 
placebo) from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.3%. Linagliptin also provided significant improvements in 
fasting plasma glucose (FPG), and a greater proportion of patients achieved a target HbA1c of < 7.0%, 
compared to placebo. This was achieved with a stable insulin dose (40.1 IU). Body weight did not 
differ significantly between the groups. Effects on plasma lipids were negligible. The observed 
incidence of hypoglycaemia in patients treated with linagliptin was similar to placebo (22.2% 
linagliptin; 21.2% placebo).
Linagliptin 24 month data, as add-on to metformin in comparison with glimepiride
In a study comparing the efficacy and safety of the addition of linagliptin 5 mg or glimepiride (mean 
dose 3 mg) in patients with inadequate glycaemic control on metformin monotherapy, mean reductions 
in HbA1c were -0.16% with linagliptin (mean baseline HbA1c 7.69%) and -0.36% with glimepiride 
(mean baseline HbA1c 7.69%.) with a mean treatment difference of 0.20% (97.5% CI: 0.09, 0.299). 
The incidence of hypoglycaemia in the linagliptin group (7.5%) was significantly lower than that in 
the glimepiride group (36.1%). Patients treated with linagliptin exhibited a significant mean decrease 
8
from baseline in body weight compared to a significant weight gain in patients administered 
glimepiride (-1.39 vs +1.29 kg).
Linagliptin as add-on therapy in patients with severe renal impairment, 12 week placebo-controlled 
data (stable background) and 40 week placebo-controlled extension (adjustable background)
The efficacy and safety of linagliptin was also evaluated in type 2 diabetes patients with severe renal 
impairment in a double-blind study versus placebo for 12 weeks duration, during which background 
glycaemic therapies were kept stable. Most patients (80.5%) received insulin as background therapy, 
alone or in combination with other oral anti-diabetics such as sulphonylurea, glinide and pioglitazone. 
There was a further follow up 40 week treatment period during which dose adjustments in antidiabetes 
background therapies were allowed.
Linagliptin provided significant improvements in HbA1c (-0.59 % change compared to placebo after 
12 weeks), from a mean baseline HbA1c of 8.2%. The observed difference in HbA1c over placebo 
was -0.72% after 52 weeks.
Body weight did not differ significantly between the groups. The observed incidence of 
hypoglycaemia in patients treated with linagliptin was higher than placebo, due to an increase in 
asymptomatic hypoglycaemic events. There was no difference between groups in severe 
hypoglycaemic events.
Linagliptin as add-on therapy in elderly (age ≥ 70 years) with type 2 diabetes
The efficacy and safety of linagliptin in elderly (age ≥ 70 years) with type 2 diabetes was evaluated in 
a double-blind study of 24 weeks duration. Patients received metformin and/or sulphonylurea and/or 
insulin as background therapy. Doses of background antidiabetic medicinal products were kept stable 
during the first 12 weeks, after which adjustments were permitted. Linagliptin provided significant 
improvements in HbA1c (-0.64 % change compared to placebo after 24 weeks), from a mean baseline 
HbA1c of 7.8%. Linagliptin also showed significant improvements in fasting plasma glucose (FPG)
compared to placebo. Body weight did not differ significantly between the groups.
Linagliptin cardiovascular and renal safety study (CARMELINA)
CARMELINA was a randomized study in 6 979 patients with type 2 diabetes with increased CV risk 
evidenced by a history of established macrovascular or renal disease who were treated with linagliptin 
5 mg (3 494) or placebo (3 485) added to standard of care targeting regional standards for HbA1c, CV 
risk factors and renal disease. The study population included 1 211 (17.4%) patients ≥ 75 years of age 
and 4 348 (62.3%) patients with renal impairment. Approximately 19% of the population had eGFR 
≥ 45 to < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2, 28% of the population had eGFR ≥ 30 to < 45 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 
15% had eGFR < 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 8.0%.
The study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority for the primary cardiovascular endpoint which 
was a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death or a non-fatal myocardial infarction 
(MI) or a non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE). The renal composite endpoint was defined as renal death or 
sustained end stage renal disease or sustained decrease of 40% or more in eGFR.
After a median follow up of 2.2 years, linagliptin, when added to usual care, did not increase the risk 
of major adverse cardiovascular events or renal outcome events. There was no increased risk in 
hospitalization for heart failure which was an additional adjudicated endpoint observed compared to 
usual care without linagliptin in patients with type 2 diabetes (see table 2).

Linagliptin cardiovascular safety study (CAROLINA)
CAROLINA was a randomized study in 6 033 patients with early type 2 diabetes and increased CV 
risk or established complications who were treated with linagliptin 5 mg (3 023) or glimepiride 1-4 mg 
(3 010) added to standard of care (including background therapy with metformin in 83% of patients) 
targeting regional standards for HbA1c and CV risk factors. The mean age for study population was 
64 years and included 2 030 (34%) patients ≥ 70 years of age. The study population included 2 089 
(35%) patients with cardiovascular disease and 1 130 (19%) patients with renal impairment with an 
eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 at baseline. The mean HbA1c at baseline was 7.15%.
The study was designed to demonstrate non-inferiority for the primary cardiovascular endpoint which 
was a composite of the first occurrence of cardiovascular death or a non-fatal myocardial infarction 
(MI) or a non-fatal stroke (3P-MACE).
After a median follow up of 6.25 years, linagliptin did not increase the risk of major adverse 
cardiovascular events (see table 3) as compared to glimepiride. Results were consistent for patients 
treated with or without metformin.

For the entire treatment period (median time on treatment 5.9 years) the rate of patients with moderate 
or severe hypoglycaemia was 6.5% on linagliptin versus 30.9% on glimepiride, severe hypoglycaemia 
occurred in 0.3% of patients on linagliptin versus 2.2% on glimepiride.
Paediatric population
The clinical efficacy and safety of empagliflozin 10 mg with potential dose-increase to 25 mg or
linagliptin 5 mg once daily has been studied in children and adolescents from 10 to 17 years of age 
with T2DM in a double-blind, randomised, placebo-controlled, parallel group study (DINAMO) over 
26 weeks, with a double-blind active treatment safety extension period up to 52 weeks.
At baseline, the mean HbA1c was 8.03%. Treatment with linagliptin 5 mg did not provide significant 
improvement in HbA1c. The treatment difference of adjusted mean change in HbA1c after 26 weeks
between linagliptin and placebo was -0.34% (95% CI -0.99, 0.30; p = 0.2935). The adjusted mean 
change in HbA1c from baseline was 0.33% in patients treated with linagliptin and 0.68% in patients 
treated with placebo (see section 4.2).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin has been extensively characterised in healthy subjects and patients 
with type 2 diabetes. After oral administration of a 5 mg dose to healthy volunteers or patients, 
linagliptin was rapidly absorbed, with peak plasma concentrations (median Tmax) occurring 1.5 hours 
post-dose.
Plasma concentrations of linagliptin decline in a triphasic manner with a long terminal half-life 
(terminal half-life for linagliptin more than 100 hours), that is mostly related to the saturable, tight 
binding of linagliptin to DPP-4 and does not contribute to the accumulation of the medicinal product. 
The effective half-life for accumulation of linagliptin, as determined from oral administration of 
multiple doses of 5 mg linagliptin, is approximately 12 hours. After once daily dosing of 5 mg 
linagliptin, steady-state plasma concentrations are reached by the third dose. Plasma AUC of 
linagliptin increased approximately 33% following 5 mg doses at steady-state compared to the first 
dose. The intra-subject and inter-subject coefficients of variation for linagliptin AUC were small 
(12.6% and 28.5%, respectively). Due to the concentration dependent binding of linagliptin to DPP-4, 
the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on total exposure is not linear; indeed total plasma AUC of 
linagliptin increased in a less than dose-proportional manner while unbound AUC increases in a 
roughly dose-proportional manner. The pharmacokinetics of linagliptin was generally similar in 
healthy subjects and in patients with type 2 diabetes.
11
Absorption
The absolute bioavailability of linagliptin is approximately 30%. Co-administration of a high-fat meal 
with linagliptin prolonged the time to reach Cmax by 2 hours and lowered Cmax by 15% but no influence 
on AUC0-72h was observed. No clinically relevant effect of Cmax and Tmax changes is expected; 
therefore linagliptin may be administered with or without food.
Distribution
As a result of tissue binding, the mean apparent volume of distribution at steady-state following a 
single 5 mg intravenous dose of linagliptin to healthy subjects is approximately 1 110 litres, indicating 
that linagliptin extensively distributes to the tissues. Plasma protein binding of linagliptin is 
concentration-dependent, decreasing from about 99% at 1 nmol/L to 75-89% at ≥ 30 nmol/L, 
reflecting saturation of binding to DPP-4 with increasing concentration of linagliptin. At high 
concentrations, where DPP-4 is fully saturated, 70-80% of linagliptin was bound to other plasma 
proteins than DPP-4, hence 30-20% were unbound in plasma.
Biotransformation
Following a [14C] linagliptin oral 10 mg dose, approximately 5% of the radioactivity was excreted in 
urine. Metabolism plays a subordinate role in the elimination of linagliptin. One main metabolite with 
a relative exposure of 13.3% of linagliptin at steady-state was detected which was found to be 
pharmacologically inactive and thus does not contribute to the plasma DPP-4 inhibitory activity of 
linagliptin.
Elimination
Following administration of an oral [14C] linagliptin dose to healthy subjects, approximately 85% of 
the administered radioactivity was eliminated in faeces (80%) or urine (5%) within 4 days of dosing. 
Renal clearance at steady-state was approximately 70 mL/min.
Special populations
Renal impairment
A multiple-dose, open-label study was conducted to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin (5 mg 
dose) in patients with varying degrees of chronic renal insufficiency compared to normal healthy 
control subjects. The study included patients with renal insufficiency classified on the basis of 
creatinine clearance as mild (50 to < 80 mL/min), moderate (30 to < 50 mL/min), and severe 
(< 30 mL/min), as well as patients with ESRD on hemodialysis. In addition patients with T2DM and 
severe renal impairment (< 30 mL/min) were compared to T2DM patients with normal renal function. 
Creatinine clearance was measured by 24-hour urinary creatinine clearance measurements or estimated 
from serum creatinine based on the Cockcroft-Gault formula. CrCl = (140 – age) × weight/72 × serum 
creatinine [× 0.85 for females], where age is in years, weight in kg, and serum creatinine is in mg/dl. 
Under steady-state conditions, linagliptin exposure in patients with mild renal impairment was 
comparable to healthy subjects. In moderate renal impairment, a moderate increase in exposure of 
about 1.7 fold was observed compared with control. Exposure in T2DM patients with severe RI was 
increased by about 1.4 fold compared to T2DM patients with normal renal function. Steady-state 
predictions for AUC of linagliptin in patients with ESRD indicated comparable exposure to that of 
patients with moderate or severe renal impairment. In addition, linagliptin is not expected to be 
eliminated to a therapeutically significant degree by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis. Therefore, no 
dosage adjustment of linagliptin is necessary in patients with any degree of renal insufficiency.
Hepatic impairment
In non-diabetic patients with mild moderate and severe hepatic insufficiency (according to the 
Child-Pugh classification), mean AUC and Cmax of linagliptin were similar to healthy matched controls 
following administration of multiple 5 mg doses of linagliptin. No dosage adjustment for linagliptin is 
proposed for diabetic patients with mild, moderate or severe hepatic impairment.
Body Mass Index (BMI)
No dosage adjustment is necessary based on BMI. BMI had no clinically relevant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of phase I and phase II 
12
data. The clinical trials before marketing authorisation have been performed up to a BMI equal to 
40 kg/m2.
Gender
No dosage adjustment is necessary based on gender. Gender had no clinically relevant effect on the 
pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of phase I and phase II 
data.
Elderly
No dosage adjustment is required based on age up to 80 years, as age did not have a clinically relevant 
impact on the pharmacokinetics of linagliptin based on a population pharmacokinetic analysis of 
phase I and phase II data. Older subjects (65 to 80, oldest patient was 78 years) had comparable 
plasma concentrations of linagliptin compared to younger subjects.
Paediatric population
A paediatric phase II study examined the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of 1 mg and 5 mg 
linagliptin in children and adolescents ≥ 10 to < 18 years of age with type 2 diabetes mellitus. The 
observed pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic responses were consistent with those found in adult 
subjects. Linagliptin 5 mg showed superiority over 1 mg with regard to trough DPP-4 inhibition (72% 
vs 32%, p = 0.0050) and a numerically larger reduction with regard to adjusted mean change from 
baseline in HbA1c (-0.63% vs -0.48%, n.s.). Due to the limited nature of the data set the results should 
be interpreted cautiously.
A paediatric phase III study examined pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics (HbA1c change from 
baseline) of 5 mg linagliptin in children and adolescents 10 to 17 years of age with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus. The observed exposure-response relationship was generally comparable between paediatric 
and adult patients, however, with a smaller drug effect estimated in children. Oral administration of 
linagliptin resulted in exposure within the range observed in adult patients. The observed geometric 
mean trough concentrations and geometric mean concentrations at 1.5 hours post-administration
(representing a concentration around tmax) at steady state were 4.30 nmol/L and 12.6 nmol/L, 
respectively. Corresponding plasma concentrations in adult patients were 6.04 nmol/L and 
15.1 nmol/L.
Race
No dosage adjustment is necessary based on race. Race had no obvious effect on the plasma 
concentrations of linagliptin based on a composite analysis of available pharmacokinetic data, 
including patients of Caucasian, Hispanic, African, and Asian origin. In addition the pharmacokinetic 
characteristics of linagliptin were found to be similar in dedicated phase I studies in Japanese, Chinese 
and Caucasian healthy volunteers.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Liver, kidneys and gastrointestinal tract are the principal target organs of toxicity in mice and rats at 
repeat doses of linagliptin of more than 300 times the human exposure.
In rats effects on reproductive organs, thyroid and the lymphoid organs were seen at more than 
1 500 times human exposure. Strong pseudo-allergic reactions were observed in dogs at medium 
doses, secondarily causing cardiovascular changes, which were considered dog-specific. Liver, 
kidneys, stomach, reproductive organs, thymus, spleen, and lymph nodes were target organs of 
toxicity in Cynomolgus monkeys at more than 450 times human exposure. At more than 100 times 
human exposure, irritation of the stomach was the major finding in these monkeys.
Linagliptin and its main metabolite did not show a genotoxic potential.
Oral 2 year carcinogenicity studies in rats and mice revealed no evidence of carcinogenicity in rats or 
male mice. A significantly higher incidence of malignant lymphomas only in female mice at the 
highest dose (> 200 times human exposure) is not considered relevant for humans (explanation: non-
treatment related but due to highly variable background incidence). Based on these studies there is no 
concern for carcinogenicity in humans.
13
The NOAEL for fertility, early embryonic development and teratogenicity in rats was set at 
> 900 times the human exposure. The NOAEL for maternal-, embryo-fetal-, and offspring toxicity in 
rats was 49 times human exposure. No teratogenic effects were observed in rabbits at > 1 000 times 
human exposure. A NOAEL of 78 times human exposure was derived for embryo-fetal toxicity in 
rabbits, and for maternal toxicity the NOAEL was 2.1 times human exposure. Therefore, it is 
considered unlikely that linagliptin affects reproduction at therapeutic exposures in humans.

Contents of the pack and other information.
1. What Trajenta is and what it is used for
Trajenta contains the active substance linagliptin which belongs to a group of medicines called “oral 
anti-diabetics”. Oral anti-diabetics are used to treat high blood sugar levels. They work by helping the 
body reduce the level of sugar in your blood.
Trajenta is used for ‘type 2 diabetes’ in adults, if the disease cannot be adequately controlled with one 
oral anti-diabetic medicine (metformin or sulphonylureas) or diet and exercise alone. Trajenta may be 
used together with other anti-diabetic medicines e.g. metformin, sulphonylureas (e.g. glimepiride, 
glipizide), empagliflozin, or insulin.
It is important to keep following the advice about diet and exercise that you have been given by your
doctor or nurse.
2. What you need to know before you take Trajenta
Do not take Trajenta
-
if you are allergic to linagliptin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before taking Trajenta if you:

have type 1 diabetes (your body does not produce any insulin) or diabetic ketoacidosis (a
complication of diabetes with high blood sugar, rapid weight loss, nausea or vomiting). Trajenta
should not be used to treat these conditions.
are taking an anti-diabetic medicine known as a ‘sulphonylurea’ (e.g. glimepiride, glipizide), 
your doctor may want to reduce your dose of sulphonylurea when you take it together with 
Trajenta in order to avoid your blood sugar going too low.
have had allergic reactions to any other medicines that you take to control the amount of sugar 
in your blood.
have or have had a disease of the pancreas.



25
If you have symptoms of acute pancreatitis, like persistent, severe stomach ache (abdominal pain), you 
should consult your doctor.
If you encounter blistering of the skin it may be a sign for a condition called bullous pemphigoid. 
Your doctor may ask you to stop Trajenta.
Diabetic skin lesions are a common complication of diabetes. You are advised to follow the 
recommendations for skin and foot care that you are given by your doctor or nurse.
Children and adolescents
Trajenta is not recommended for children and adolescents under 18 years. It is not effective in children 
and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 17 years. It is not known if this medicine is safe and 
effective when used in children younger than 10 years.
Other medicines and Trajenta
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines.
In particular, you should tell your doctor if you are using medicines containing any of the following 
active substances:

Carbamazepine, phenobarbital or phenytoin. These may be used to control fits (seizures) or 
chronic pain.
Rifampicin. This is an antibiotic used to treat infections such as tuberculosis.

Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking this medicine.
It is unknown if Trajenta is harmful to the unborn child. Therefore, it is preferable to avoid using
Trajenta if you are pregnant.
It is not known if Trajenta passes into human breast milk. A decision must be made by your doctor 
whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from Trajenta therapy.
Driving and using machines
Trajenta has no or negligible influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
Taking Trajenta in combination with medicines called sulphonylureas and/or insulin can cause too low 
blood sugar levels (hypoglycaemia), which may affect your ability to drive and use machines or work 
without safe foothold. However, more frequent blood glucose testing might be recommended to 
minimise the risk for hypoglycaemia, especially when Trajenta is combined with sulphonylurea and/or 
insulin.
3.
How to take Trajenta
Always take this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist 
if you are not sure.
The recommended dose of Trajenta is one 5 mg tablet once a day.
You can take Trajenta with or without food.
Your doctor may prescribe Trajenta together with another oral anti-diabetic medicine. Remember to 
take all medicines as directed by your doctor to achieve the best results for your health.
If you take more Trajenta than you should
If you take more Trajenta than you should, talk to a doctor immediately.
26
If you forget to take Trajenta

If you forget to take a dose of Trajenta, take it as soon as you remember it. However, if it is 
nearly time for the next dose, skip the missed dose.
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Never take two doses on the same 
day.

If you stop taking Trajenta
Do not stop taking Trajenta without first consulting your doctor. Your blood sugar levels may increase 
when you stop taking Trajenta.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.
4.
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
Some symptoms need immediate medical attention
You should stop taking Trajenta and see your doctor immediately if you experience the following 
symptoms of low blood sugar: trembling, sweating, anxiety, blurred vision, tingling lips, paleness, 
mood change or confusion (hypoglycaemia). Hypoglycaemia (frequency: very common, may affect 
more than 1 in 10 people) is an identified side effect when Trajenta is taken together with metformin 
and a sulphonylurea.
Some patients have experienced allergic reactions (hypersensitivity; frequency uncommon, may affect 
up to 1 in 100 people) while taking Trajenta alone or in combination with other medicinal products for 
the treatment of diabetes, which may be serious, including wheezing and shortness of breath 
(bronchial hyperreactivity; frequency not known, frequency cannot be estimated from the available 
data). Some patients experienced rash (frequency uncommon), hives (urticaria; frequency rare, may 
affect up to 1 in 1 000 people), and swelling of the face, lips, tongue, and throat that may cause 
difficulty in breathing or swallowing (angioedema; frequency rare). If you experience any of the signs 
of illness mentioned above, stop taking Trajenta and call your doctor right away. Your doctor may 
prescribe a medicine to treat your allergic reaction and a different medicine for your diabetes.
Some patients have experienced inflammation of the pancreas (pancreatitis; frequency rare, may affect 
up to 1 in 1 000 people) while taking Trajenta alone or in combination with other medicinal products 
for the treatment of diabetes.
STOP taking Trajenta and contact a doctor immediately if you notice any of the following serious side 
effects:

Severe and persistent pain in the abdomen (stomach area) which might reach through to your 
back, as well as nausea and vomiting, as it could be a sign of an inflamed pancreas 
(pancreatitis).
Some patients have had the following side effects while taking Trajenta alone or in combination with 
other medicinal products for the treatment of diabetes:
Common: level of lipase in the blood increased.

Uncommon: inflamed nose or throat (nasopharyngitis), cough, constipation (in combination 

with insulin), level of amylase in the blood increased.
Rare: blistering of skin (bullous pemphigoid).


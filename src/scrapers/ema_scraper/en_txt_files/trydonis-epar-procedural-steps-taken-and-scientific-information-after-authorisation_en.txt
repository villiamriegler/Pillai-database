Extension of indication, based on results from two 
Phase III studies: Triple 7 (CCD-05993AA1-07) and 
Triple 8 (CCD-05993AA1-08), to include maintenance 
treatment in adult patients with moderate to severe 
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) who 
are not adequately treated by combination of a long-
acting beta2-agonist and a long-acting muscarinic 
antagonist. Sections 4.1, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the 
SmPC are updated accordingly to reflect the studies’ 
results and add a new warning with regards to the 
risk of visual disturbance associated with 
beclometasone following the PSUSA recommendation 
PSUSA/00000306/201612. The package leaflet and 
the risk management plan (version 6.0) are updated 
accordingly.

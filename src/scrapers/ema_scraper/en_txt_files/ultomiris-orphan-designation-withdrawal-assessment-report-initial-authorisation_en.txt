2.  Grounds for the COMP opinion  
The COMP opinion that was the basis for the initial orphan medicinal product designation in 2016 was 
based on the following grounds: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
the intention to treat the condition with the medicinal product containing Fc- and CDR-modified 
humanised monoclonal antibody against C5 was considered justified based on preliminary clinical 
data supporting reduction of haemolysis in treated patients affected by the condition; 
the condition is life-threatening and chronically debilitating due to the complications of the chronic 
haemolysis such as abdominal pain, infection, cytopenia, and kidney malfunction, and due to 
occurrence of thrombosis and haemorrhage in different organs; 
the condition was estimated to be affecting less than 0.2 in 10,000 persons in the European Union, 
at the time the application was made; 
in addition, although satisfactory methods of treatment of the condition have been authorised in 
the European Union, the sponsor has provided sufficient justification for the assumption that the 
medicinal product containing Fc- and CDR-modified humanised monoclonal antibody against C5 will 
be of significant benefit to those affected by the condition. The sponsor has provided preliminary 
clinical data that support improved reduction of haemolysis compared to the authorised product. 
The Committee considered that this constitutes a clinically relevant advantage. 
3.  Review of criteria for orphan designation at the time of 
marketing authorisation  
Article 3(1)(a) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat a life-threatening or chronically debilitating 
condition affecting not more than five in 10 thousand people in the Community when the 
application is made 
Condition 
Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria is a clonal, hematopoietic stem cell disorder. It manifests with a 
chronic haemolytic anaemia from uncontrolled complement activation, a propensity for thrombosis and 
marrow failure. The haemolysis is largely mediated by the alternative pathway of complement and 
clinical manifestations have been linked to the deficiency of glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored 
proteins (GPI-APs). In particular, patients’ erythrocytes become highly vulnerable to complement-
mediated lysis owing to a reduction, or absence, of the complement regulatory proteins CD55 and 
CD59 (DeZem and Brodsky Hematol Oncol Clin North Am. 2015 Jun;29(3):479-94).  
The proposed therapeutic indication “indicated for the treatment of adult patients with paroxysmal 
nocturnal hemoglobinuria” falls within the scope of the designated orphan indication “Treatment of 
paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria”. 
Intention to diagnose, prevent or treat  
With reference to the positive CHMP benefit-risk assessment, the intention to treat the condition has 
been justified.

Chronically debilitating and/or life-threatening nature 
The COMP has previously acknowledged that the condition is life-threatening and chronically 
debilitating due to the complications of the chronic haemolysis such as abdominal pain, infection, 
cytopenia, and kidney malfunction, and due to occurrence of thrombosis and haemorrhage in different 
organs. Vascular complications at the level of the central nervous system are the most common cause 
of death. This is still relevant. 
Number of people affected or at risk 
The applicant estimated the lower and higher numbers of PNH cases using the prevalence reported 
directly in one publication (Hill, 2006 [lower estimate]), and the prevalence estimated from incidence 
in one other publication (Morado, 2017 [higher estimate]), applied to country population 
denominators. A conclusion of 0.159 to 0.306 per 10,000 was provided. 
The COMP has previously considered a less than 0.2 at the time of this designation, which may be 
retained for this procedure. 
Article 3(1)(b) of Regulation (EC) No 141/2000 
Existence of no satisfactory methods of diagnosis prevention or treatment of the condition 
in question, or, if such methods exist, the medicinal product will be of significant benefit to 
those affected by the condition. 
Existing methods 
The only product authorized in the European Union for the treatment of PNH is Eculizumab, an orphan 
medicinal product. Eculizumab is currently indicated for patients with haemolysis with clinical 
symptom(s) indicative of high disease activity, regardless of transfusion history. 
Significant benefit 
Alexion received protocol assistance including answers to questions on significant benefit. The proposal 
was to base the significant benefit rationale on a clinically relevant advantage supported with clinical 
data on haemolysis as measured by normalization of LDH and the proportion of patients with 
breakthrough haemolysis. The COMP at that time had recommended reconsidering the above proposal, 
because a non-inferiority design with an active comparator with the same mechanism of action was not 
expected to generate data to support the significant benefit based on a clinically relevant advantage. 
At the time of marketing authorisation, the sponsor provided two arguments for the justification of 
significant benefit, one for improved haemolysis and breakthrough events, and a second one based on 
the reduction of the number of infusions: 
• 
The applicant firstly argued a clinically relevant advantage of improved efficacy, which nevertheless 
has not been confirmed by the non-inferiority studies presented for MA. 
In more detail, and with regards to study 301, it was argued that the LDH profile observed over time 
was similar to eculizumab but with consistently lower mean LDH levels in the ravulizumab arm. At Day 
183, the adjusted prevalence of LDH-N was 53.6% for the ravulizumab group and 49.4% for the 
eculizumab group. The adjusted OR excluding baseline LDH as an explanatory variable for the 
comparison of ravulizumab to eculizumab was 1.187 (0.796, 1.769) indicating that a patient switching 
to ravulizumab had a nearly 19% increased probability of achieving LDH-N compared to a patient who

Page 5/8 
 
 
 
received eculizumab. The median time to first LDH-N was 24 days (22, 29) for ravulizumab and 29 
days (24, 43) for eculizumab, and the difference of 5 days favored ravulizumab. 
With regards to study 302, it was pointed out that the LDH profile observed over time was similar to 
eculizumab with generally lower mean LDH levels in the ravulizumab arm. At Day 183, LDH-N was 
achieved by 64 of 97 (66.0%) patients treated with ravulizumab and 58 of 98 (59.2%) patients treated 
with eculizumab. The adjusted OR from the GEE model excluding baseline LDH as an explanatory 
variable for the comparison of ravulizumab to eculizumab was 1.179 (0.737, 1.887) indicating that a 
patient switching to ravulizumab had a nearly 18% increased probability of achieving LDH-N compared 
to a patient who remained on eculizumab. As discussed above, in light of the non-inferiority shown in 
all endpoints of both these studies, an improved LDH effect for the purpose of justifying SB is not 
endorsed. 
Another argument by the sponsor refers to reduction of breakthrough events in the two studies, but 
this was again not supported by the clinical data. It was argued that in study 301, the difference 
between treatment groups in the proportion of patients who experienced breakthrough haemolysis was 
6.7% (–14.21%, 0.18%), nevertheless the upper bound of the 95% CI was less than the protocol 
specified NIM of 20%. It was also argued that fewer ravulizumab-treated patients (4.0%, n = 5 with 5 
events) experienced breakthrough events during the Primary Evaluation Period compared with 
eculizumab-treated patients (10.7%, n = 13 with 15 events), representing more than a 2-fold 
difference between treatment groups. In Study 302, it was also stated that none of the patients in the 
ravulizumab group experienced breakthrough haemolysis during the Primary Evaluation Period 
compared with 5 (5.1%) patients in the eculizumab group. The difference between treatment groups in 
the proportion of patients who experienced breakthrough haemolysis was 5.1% (18.99%, 8.89%). The 
upper bound was less than the protocol-specified NIM of 20%. In all cases the effects observed are 
comparable and trends do not support improved efficacy in any endpoints. 
An additional post hoc analysis of the breakthrough hemolysis of the 301 study was also provided 
based on the following: 
1.  Number of breakthrough events (BTH events) allowing to have more precision and information on 
the number of events per year compared to the number of cases.  
2.  Percentage of breakthrough haemolysis using only the LDH portion of the breakthrough haemolysis 
definition (BTH-only). 
3.  Percentage of patients with free C5 levels >0.5 ug/mL used as a response indicator. 
4.  Number of transfusion units (units-Tx) used as a response predictor which is an alternative to 
transfusion avoidance endpoints. 
The relevance of these endpoints for a clinically relevant advantage has not been justified and would 
require further elaboration.

There was a second argument of major contribution to patient care based on the reduction of 
infusions (every 2 weeks vs every 8 weeks). The applicant noted that the pivotal clinical studies 
provide favourable results for ravulizumab over eculizumab in quality-of-life instruments but did 
not show statistically significant differences in EORTC-QLQ-C30 and FACIT-Fatigue scores between 
ravulizumab and eculizumab. 
The applicant has conducted a sub-study (PNH-302s) to Evaluate Patient Preference for the Treatment 
of Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria, from patients currently enrolled in Study ALXN1210-PNH-
302. The primary and secondary objectives are respectively: to evaluate patient preference for 
eculizumab (q2w) or ravulizumab (q8w) treatment and identify characteristics contributing to patient's 
preference for treatment with eculizumab or ravulizumab. Interim results showed that the majority of 
patients (49 out of 52 patients, 94%) preferred ravulizumab. Patients reported which medication they 
preferred based on 9 treatment factors (controlling fatigue; controlling symptoms other than fatigue; 
frequency of infusions; side effects of treatment; convenience of receiving treatment; being able to 
plan activities; effectiveness of the medication until the next infusion; anxiety related to the infusion; 
your overall quality of life). At least 50% of patients preferred ravulizumab for all factors except “side 
effects of treatment.” For “side effects of treatment,” 26 patients (50%) preferred ravulizumab and an 
equal number indicated no preference. The factors for which the greatest proportions of patients 
preferred ravulizumab were “frequency of infusions” and “being able to plan activities” (each with 51 
patients, 98%) and “convenience of receiving treatment” (48 patients, 92%). In addition, patients 
reported which factor was the most important in deciding which medication they preferred overall. The 
factors chosen as most important by the largest numbers of patients were “frequency of infusions” (22 
patients) and “overall quality of life” (10 patients). The only factors that were not chosen by any 
patient were “anxiety related to the infusion” and “side effects of treatment”. 
Such claims are to be considered with caution, as preferences or convenience do not constitute per se 
documentation of a major contribution of patient care. For instance, the claim of the reduction in the 
number of infusions per year (26 for eculizumab to 6 for ravulizumab), has to be put in the context of 
the same route of administration and the time spent in hospital, not merely the number of 
hospitalisations. Eculizumab is to be administered over 25 – 45 minutes in adults and 1-4 hours in 
paediatric patients, while ravulizumab over “a minimal period of 1.7 to 2.4 hours”. 
It was also noted that when the sponsor collected PROs from the study, no significant differences 
ensued in EORTC-QLQ-C30 and FACIT-Fatigue scores.  
The sponsor was requested to document any claims of significant benefit in an OE before the COMP.

4.  COMP list of issues 
Significant benefit 
The sponsor argues both a clinically relevant advantage based on improved efficacy, as well as a major 
contribution to patient care based on the reduced number of infusions.  
Non-inferiority with regards to all studied endpoints of the main clinical studies does not allow for a 
consideration of improved efficacy. Moreover, when the sponsor collected PROs from a specific study, 
no significant differences ensued in EORTC-QLQ-C30 and FACIT-Fatigue scores.  
The sponsor is invited to provide data to justify a clinically relevant advantage or major contribution to 
patient care. Data from patients who have experienced both treatments would be helpful in that 
regard.

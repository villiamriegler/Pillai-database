SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1. 
Introduction 
Human erythropoietin is a glycoprotein which is produced primarily in the kidneys and promotes red 
blood cell production by stimulating the division and differentiation of committed progenitors in the 
bone  marrow.    Erythropoietin  for  clinical  use  is  produced  by  recombinant  DNA  technology  using 
mammalian cells as expression system. All epoetins in clinical use have a similar amino acid sequence 
as  endogenous  erythropoietin  but  differ  in  the  glycosylation  pattern.    Glycosylation  influences 
pharmacokinetics and may influence efficacy and safety, particularly immunogenicity. 
Epoetin-containing medicinal products are currently indicated for several conditions such as anaemia 
in  patients  with  chronic  renal  failure,  chemotherapy-induced  anaemia  in  cancer  patients  and  for 
increasing the yield of autologous blood from patients in a pre-donation programme. The mechanism 
of action of epoetin is the same in all currently approved indications but the doses required to achieve 
the desired response may vary considerably and are the highest in the oncology indications. 
HX575, the medicinal product applied for, has been developed as a biosimilar product to the reference 
product Eprex/Erypo (epoetin alfa, Janssen-Cilag GmbH). The active substance for both products, is 
an epoetin of identical primary structure as the endogenous human erythropoietin and is produced in 
Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells. 
As required for a Similar Biological Medicinal Product application, the dossier contains a full quality 
Module 3 and reduced non-clinical and clinical Modules 4 and 5. 
Principally,  epoetin  can  be  administered  as  an  intravenous  (IV)  solution  or  as  subcutaneous  (SC) 
injection.  Eprex/Erypo  (containing  epoetin  alfa),  the  reference  medicinal  product  chosen  for  the 
comparability exercise in this application, has been contraindicated for SC use in patients with chronic 
renal failure in the EU member states since December 2002, due to the increased frequency of anti-
erythropoietin  antibody-induced  pure  red  cell  aplasia  (PRCA).  It  is  assumed,  although  not  finally 
proven, that the increased immunogenicity resulted from leachables released from the uncoated rubber 
stopper used for Eprex/Erypo. Following the start of the procedure, after demonstrating a substantial 
decrease in the frequency of PRCA, the SC use in patients with renal anaemia has been reinstated (24 
May  2006)  for  epoetin  alfa,  together  with  the  introduction  of  coated  rubber  stoppers  and  additional 
pharmacovigilance measures. HX575 drug product was developed with a Teflon coated rubber stopper 
in order to prevent leachables which may migrate from the primary packaging into the drug product. 
During  its  temporary  contraindication  (subcutaneous  in  chronic  renal  failure  patients),  Eprex/Erypo 
could not be used as comparator in respective clinical trials to demonstrate comparability of HX575 
versus Eprex/Erypo in the affected population. 
The applicant claims all the indications approved for the reference product, with the exception of the 
indication for increasing the yield of autologous blood from patients in a predonation programme.

Quality aspects 
Drug Substance 
Manufacture 
The  drug  substance  is  manufactured  and  released  by  Rentschler  Biotechnologie  GmbH,  Germany. 
After a series of sub cultivations, the cells are seeded into the production fermenter. The production is 
based on a repeated batch fermentation, whereby the individual harvests are collected at daily intervals 
and each harvest is stored frozen until further processing.  
The  drug  substance  is  recovered  from  the  fermentation  broth  by  a  conventional  protein  purification 
process  comprising  orthogonal  chromatography  steps  and  a  viral  filtration  step.  The  manufacturing

steps  are  monitored  by  a  number  of  process  controls  (like  acceptance  criteria,  action  limits, 
informative values, and operational parameters).  
The Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working cell banks (WCB) were both established without the use 
of  materials  of  human  or  animal  origin  and  all  subsequent  steps  in  further  manufacturing  are 
performed  without  reagent  of  animal  origin.  Insulin  provided  in  the  cell  medium  is  produced  by 
S.cerevisiae.  Characterisation  of  both  cell  banks  in  terms  of  genetic  stability  and  viral  safety  is 
satisfactorily achieved by analysis of genotypic and phenotypic tests as well as virus testing.  
Characterisation 
HX575 drug substance was extensively characterised using orthogonal “state-of-the-art” methods. The 
set  of  analytical  methods  is  appropriately  designed and  covers  the  analysis  of  the  primary  structure, 
higher order structures, post-translational modifications and Bioassays.  
The  characterisation  of  the  protein  structure  is  considered  satisfactory.  The  primary  structure  and 
correct  formation  of  disulfide  bonds  in  accordance  with  the  BRP  reference  standard  was  mainly 
confirmed by peptide mapping using different proteases in conjunction with subsequent MALDI-TOF 
analysis  of  isolated  peptides  and  could  cover  99%  of  the  sequence.  Full  sequence  confirmation  was 
achieved  by  additional  sequencing  of  selected  peptides.  Investigations  on  secondary  and  tertiary 
structure are also considered to adequately reflect correct folding of the molecules and batch to batch 
consistency.  With  respect  to  the  glycan  part  the  methodology  applied  for  characterisation  is  also 
considered  satisfactory.  Structural  analysis  of  N-glycans  and  O-glycans  comprised  monosaccharide 
analysis,  sialic  acids  characterisation  and  sequence  analysis  of  N-glycans  and  O-glycans  on  a 
qualitative and quantitative basis. Additionally, site specific glycan analysis has been performed. 
High  mannose-6-phosphate  (HM6P)  glycans,  have  been  detected  in  batches  used  in  clinical  studies. 
These  phosphorylated  high  mannose-type  glycan  structures  were  found  to  be  located exclusively on 
glycosylation site Asn-24 as demonstrated by site specific analysis of glycan structures.  It should be 
noted that HM6P glycan structures are naturally occurring glycan structures on lysosomal hydrolases 
and  have  also  been  detected  on  non-lysosomal  proteins  in  low  amounts.    Receptor  binding  studies 
showed  that  HM6P-structures  on  EPO  have  a  weak  binding  affinity  to  the  mannose-6-phosphate 
receptor in contrast to classical mannose-6-phosphate-binding proteins such as lysosomal hydrolases 
and thus subsequent internalisation under physiological conditions is not expected. 
Specification 
Appropriate specifications have been set for analysis of the active substance at release and at the end 
of shelf-life. 
Stability 
The claimed shelf-life of the active substance is supported by batch data. 
Comparability Exercise for Active Substance 
The  selected  reference  product  for  the  comparability  exercise  was  Erypo/Eprex  (Janssen-Cilag 
GmbH).  For  comparison  of  the  two  drug  substances  the  same  set  of  tests  and  analytical  procedures 
were mainly applied as in the characterisation part. 
In accordance with the Guideline on Similar Biological Medicinal Products containing Biotechnology-
derived  Proteins  as  Active  Substance:  Quality  Issues  (EMEA/CHMP/BWP/  49348/2005),  the 
applicant  isolated  active  substance  from  the  reference  medicinal  product  in  order  to  perform  the 
comparative  analysis  at  the  active  substance  level  for  some  tests.  Isolation  was  performed  by 
immunoaffinity chromatography. 
It  was  demonstrated  that  the  isolated  active  substance  used  in  the  comparability  exercise  is 
representative of the active substance present in the reference medicinal product.  
The analysis of the protein part did not reveal any significant difference with the reference product. 
Differences were observed at the glycosylation level. Phosphorylated high mannose type structures in 
HX575  were  detected  at  higher  levels  than  in  Eprex/Erypo.  However,  they  are  considered  to  be

common  glycoforms  of  recombinant  erythropoietins  and  their  presence  is  described  in  the  literature 
for  other  recombinant  cytokines  and  a  large  variety  of  non-lysosomal  proteins  from  human  plasma. 
The level of HM6P observed in HX575 did not impact on the efficacy or safety of the drug product.  
In  addition,  neuraminic  acid  differences  were  observed.  However,  HX575  drug  substance  showed 
lower  values  of  N-glycolyl-neuraminic  acid  and  diacetylated  neuraminic  acids  as  compared  to 
Eprex/Erypo. 
Comparison  of  the  total  molecules  with  respect  to  molecular  size  and  aggregation  state,  binding 
affinity, biological activity in vitro and in vivo did not reveal any remarkable differences. 
Viral safety 
With  regard  to  safety  evaluation  of  adventitious  agents  multiple  levels  of  control  have  been 
established  throughout  the  HX575  drug  substance  manufacturing  process  to  minimize  the  risk  of 
contamination of the drug product with adventitious viruses. Cell banks have been extensively tested. 
A risk assessment with regard to TSE according to the “Note for guidance on minimizing the risk of 
transmitting animal spongiform encephalopathy agents via human and veterinary medicinal products 
(EMEA/410/01 Rev.2)” has been done. 
Drug Product 
The  drug  product  is  provided  as  a  liquid  ready-to-use  solution  in  a  single-dose  pre-filled  syringe. 
Epoetin alfa is formulated in a phosphate buffer with glycine and polysorbate 80 at concentrations of 
2,000 IU/ml (1,000 IU and 2,000 IU in 0.5 ml and 1.0 ml respectively) and 10,000 IU/ml (3,000 IU, 
4,000 IU, 5,000 IU, 6,000 IU, 8,000 IU and 10,000 IU in 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0 ml respectively). 
Product development and manufacture 
The drug product follows the same qualitative and quantitative composition as the reference product 
Eprex/Erypo.  The  formulations  of  both  concentrations  16.8  µg/ml  and  84  µg/ml  are  composed  of 
phosphate-buffer,  water  for  injections,  polysorbate  80,  glycine  and  sodium  chloride,  resulting  in  a 
different ratio between EPO and the excipients depending on the concentration.  
The manufacturing process is a conventional process beginning with the dissolution of polysorbate 80 
and other excipients. The solutions are mixed and drug substance bulk solution is added. After mixing, 
the DS formulated bulk undergoes a double filtration at 0.22 µm into storage bags and is aseptically 
filled  in  the  syringes  thereafter.  The  validation  of  the  currently  used  manufacturing  process  is 
satisfactory.  
Batch analysis 
The batches selected for the batch analysis were considered to be acceptable. 
Product Specification 
Drug  product  release  and  stability  specifications  include  tests  for  identity,  purity,  content, 
pharmaceutical tests and microbiological tests.  
Stability of the Product 
The applicant claims a 24-months shelf-life for the drug product when stored at 2-8°C. A 3 days hold 
time ≤25°C is also claimed for transportation and before administration of the product. 
Comparability Exercise for Drug Product 
Large numbers of HX575 and Eprex/Erypo drug product batches with approximately the same age at 
time of analysis were used for the comparability exercise. 
Peptide maps show some differences in the region corresponding to fragments including the O-linked 
glycan  due  to  a  higher  sialylation.  For  presentations  at  low  concentration  (i.e.  2000  IU/ml)  and  at 
equivalent age, HX575 drug products tends to have lower content of the oxidized variant, significantly 
fewer  amounts  of  sub-visible  particles  and  lower  content  of  silicone  oil  than  Erypo/Eprex.  In 
summary,  the  comparability  exercise  performed  at  the  drug  product  level  shows  that  HX575  drug 
product is generally within the variability of Eprex/Erypo for the parameters tested.

Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The biological activity of HX575 final drug product, determined in vitro and in vivo, was compared to 
the  reference  product  Eprex/Erypo  (Janssen-Cilag,  Germany).  Five  non-clinical  studies  were 
submitted  by  the  applicant  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  comparability  of  HX575  to  the  reference 
product  Eprex/Erypo  and  to  demonstrate  the  safety  and  local  tolerability  of  HX575.  These  studies 
were undertaken in mice (pharmacopoeial test), dogs and rabbits. 
Pharmacology 
In  vitro  studies  (ELISA,  Plasmon  resonance  spectroscopy)  indicated  that  there  are  no  remarkable 
conformational  or  modification  differences  interfering  with  antibody  binding  between  the  different 
HX575 drug product batches in comparison to the reference product Eprex/Erypo. 
A human erythroleukemic cell line was used for the characterization of the proliferation response after 
stimulation  with  erythropoietin  standard.  The  human  erythroleukemic  cell  line  was  used  for  the 
characterization  of  the  proliferation  response  after  stimulation  with  epoetin  alfa  or  the  BRP  95/548 
erythropoietin  standard.  Conformational  changes  or  modifications  of  the  test  item  can  influence  the 
receptor  binding  and/or  signal  transmission  properties  and  thus  alter  the  response  in  the  in  vitro 
bioassay. Therefore, the cell based in vitro bioassay was chosen to characterize receptor binding and 
signal  transmission  of  HX575,  comparator  and  standard.  The  dose-response  curves  of  consistency 
batches were compared with the dose response curves of the BRP 95/548 erythropoietin standard. The 
same  comparison  was  done  between  Erypo  and  the  BRP  95/548  erythropoietin  standard.  No 
differences  became  obvious  between  the  HX575  or  Erypo  preparations  and  the  BRP  standard.  The 
dose response curves of both test items are similar. 
A  5-day  study  in  dogs  was  performed,  which  focused  on  reticulocytes  pharmacodynamic-
pharmacokinetic.  After  three  to  four  days  of  epoetin  alfa  injection  a  clear  rise  in  reticulocytes  was 
observed,  which  is  reversible  upon  cessation  of  treatment.  Although  the  quality  and  size  of  the 
biological effect is similar across groups exposed to epoetin alfa without meeting stringent criteria of 
pharmacokinetic  bioequivalence,  there  was  no  remarkable  difference  between  the  HX575  batches 
(drug product) and the reference product Eprex/Erypo.  
Pharmacokinetics 
A study was performed in the dog, aiming to compare the bioavailability of two different batches of 
HX575 drug product to the reference product Eprex/Erypo, following daily intravenous injection over 
5 days. In this study, female dogs were divided into 3 groups and were dosed according to a cross-over 
scheme.  Three  different  epoetin  preparations  were  tested,  namely  two  batches  of  HX575  and  one 
comparator  batch  Erypo.  After  a  drug-free  interval  of  16  days  each  group  was  switched  to  another 
batch.  Additional  female  dogs  remained  untreated  and  served  as  a  negative  control.  Thereby  each 
batch of epoetin, including the comparator, was applied to different dogs, and the resulting PK and PD 
data  were 
treated  as  x-fold  determinations.  The  following  parameters  were  determined: 
Pharmacokinetics,  haematology  (erythrocyte  and  reticulocyte  count,  haematocrit,  haemoglobin), 
antibodies against epoetin). In this study, exposures produced by a single iv administration of both test 
batches were lower than exposure produced by a single iv Eprex/Erypo administration. However, in 
comparison  to  the  reference  Eprex/Erypo,  Test  1  (HX575    drug  product  10,000  IU/ml)  fulfilled 
conventional  bioequivalence  acceptance  criteria  for  bioavailability  whereas  test  2  (HX575  drug 
product  10,000  IU/ml)  did  not.  The  difference  in  exposure  could  partly  be  attributed  to  the  study 
design itself and potential differences of sensitivity of the ELISA assay for HX575 and Eprex/Erypo, 
and  differences  were  not  regarded  to  be  relevant  with  respect  to  the  conclusion  of  the  toxicological 
assessment  of  the  13-week  study  performed  in  the  dog.  No  data  were  provided  regarding 
bioavailability following sub-cutaneous administration.

Toxicology 
No own single dose toxicity studies were submitted by the applicant. According to literature data, the 
highest epoetin alfa dose tested was > 40-times the highest human dose administered clinically today 
(600 IU/kg). No lethality occurred.  
A  13-week  toxicity  study  was  performed  in  the  dog  with  HX575  drug  product  or  comparator  
following intravenous administration, in accordance with the EMEA scientific advice.  Each group of 
animals consisting of males and females was dosed IV daily for 13 weeks with either HX575 or with 
the comparator preparation. Males and females of each group were sacrificed and examined at the end 
of  dosing  (week  13),  the  remaining  males  and  females  were  allowed  to  recover  for  five  weeks,  i.e. 
were sacrificed after 18 weeks. 
The  following  parameters  were  obtained:  toxicokinetics,  clinical signs, mortality, body weight, food 
and  water  consumption,  ECG,  blood  pressure,  haematology,  biochemistry  (blood  and  urine), 
ophthalmology, organ weights, histopathology, local tolerance and anti-epoetin antibodies. This study 
thereby  covered  not  only  aspects  of  toxicity  but  also  provided  information  on  pharmacodynamics 
(frequent determination of relevant haematological parameters), safety pharmacology (ECG and blood 
pressure), 
toxicokinetics.  For  pharmacodynamics 
assessment  the  AUC  values  and  the  maximal  concentrations  (Cmax)  of  the  relevant  haematological 
parameters  (reticulocyte  count,  reticulocytes  as  percentage  of  erythrocytes,  haemoglobin  content, 
haematocrit and erythrocyte count) were also determined for statistical analysis. 
immunogenicity  (antibody  formation)  and 
This  study  revealed  no  signs  of  overt  toxicity.  All  changes  observed  were  attributed  to  direct  and 
adaptive responses of the organism to the massive erythropoietic impulse, especially in the high-dose 
groups.  These  responses  included  congestion  of  inner  organs,  in  particular  the  spleen,  liver  and 
kidneys, changes in blood cellularity, rise in haematocrit and an increase in spleen, liver and kidney 
weights. A marked haematopoietic activation of the bone marrow was observed in dogs, even in the 
low-dose group. There was no difference in the safety profile with respect to pharmacodynamic effects 
or toxicity between HX575 drug product and Eprex/Erypo.  
Anti-epoetin  antibodies  were  detected  in  a  few  animals  (2-3  per  epoetin  group)  by  an  ELISA,  the 
validation of which was considered acceptable. However, the number of animals affected was too low 
to allow meaningful conclusions on differences in immunogenicity between HX575 and Eprex/Erypo. 
For  pharmacodynamics  assessment,  the  AUC  values  and  the  maximal  concentrations  (Cmax)  of  the 
relevant  haematological  parameters  (reticulocyte  count,  reticulocytes  as  percentage  of  erythrocytes, 
haemoglobin content, haematocrit and erythrocyte count) were determined for statistical analysis. For 
haemoglobin and haematocrit 100 IU/kg HX575 had the same effect as 500 IU/kg HX575 or Erypo so 
that for these two parameters the maximum response was obviously already reached at 100 IU/kg. In 
consequence, differences in potency of HX575 and Erypo, the latter tested at 500 IU/kg only, would 
not become evident from these parameters. For erythro- and reticulocyte count a clear dose-response-
relationship  was  observed  with  100  IU/kg  being  less  effective  than  500  IU/kg.  There  was  some 
biological fluctuation but no systematic difference between 500 IU/kg HX575 and 500 IU/kg Erypo as 
quantified  by  calculating  erythrocyte  count  AUC  and Cmax. Concerning reticulocyte count, Cmax (i.e. 
maximal  reticulocyte  number  was  slightly  lower  (0.41  vs.  0.45  1012  per  L)  with  HX575  than  with 
Erypo, but AUC was virtually identical.  
Blood biochemistry: No major differences between the effects of HX575 and Erypo was found with 
the  exception  of  a  marked  LDH  increase  at  test  week  (TW)  13  in  males  dosed  with  HX575.  Organ 
weights:  No  meaningful  differences  were  observed  between  HX575  and  Erypo.  Histopathology:  All 
changes observed can be attributed to the direct pharmacodynamic effect of epoetin or reflect adaptive 
responses  of  the  organism  to  the  massive  erythropoietic  impulse  given  by  epoetin  especially  in  the 
high-dose groups. These responses included congestion of spleen, liver and kidneys, changes in blood 
cellularity,  huge  rise  in  haematocrit  and  increase  in  spleen,  liver  and  kidney  weights  (see above). A 
marked  haematopoietic  activation  of  the  bone  marrow  was  observed  already  in  the  low-dose  group. 
There  were  no  meaningful  differences  between  the  animals  treated  with  HX575  and  the  animals 
treated with Erypo.

Among several repeat-dose toxicity studies taken from the literature and performed in rats and dogs 
during  up  to  13  weeks,  no  specific  targets  of  toxicity  other  than  effects  related  to  the 
pharmacodynamics  of  epoetin  or  to  the  immune  challenge  were  identified.  However,  persistent 
stimulation  by  500  I.U./kg  BW/day  in  dogs  resulted  in  bone  marrow  fibrosis.  Following  recovery, 
fibrosis  was  less  than  observed  at  the  end  of  treatment.  According  to  these  literature  data, 
subcutaneous  application  of  epoetin  alfa  was  at  least  as  well  tolerated  as  the  intravenous 
administration. 
The  analysis  of  literature  data  revealed  that  the  administration  of  rh-epoetin  to  dogs,  rats,  mice  or 
monkeys caused the formation of antibodies. The titres of the responding animals were generally low 
and the response appeared dose-dependent. Where examined, the withdrawal of epoetin exposure was 
accompanied by a decrease of the antibody response. 
Local tolerance was tested in two studies in the rabbit following a single intravenous, intramuscular, 
intra-arterial,  intra-venous  and  subcutaneous  injection  administration.  Results  indicated  that  the 
epoetin  injection  solution  HX575  revealed  a  good  local  tolerability  in  rabbits  at  all  tested  routes  of 
administration. In the 13-week intravenous dog study HX575 was also locally well tolerated. 
Regarding the potential systemic toxicity, no non-clinical study was performed using the subcutaneous 
route, whereas it was intended that HX575 would be used by the subcutaneous as well as intravenous 
routes  of  administration.  The  risks  associated  with  subcutaneous  routes  are:  1)  systemic  toxicity,  2) 
specific local toxicity and 3) increased antigenic potential compared to intravenous route. Regarding 
systemic toxicity, it is considered that the intravenous route of administration covers the exposure and 
associated risk following subcutaneous administration. Local tolerance has been studied in the rabbit  
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No  environmental  risk  assessment  was  required.  In  accordance  with  the  guideline  on  the 
environmental risk assessment of medicinal products for /human use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), 
proteins are unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. 
Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The  expected  pharmacodynamic  effect  was  shown  in  vitro  as  growth  response  of  erythroleukemic 
cells and in vivo in normocythaemic mice measuring the reticulocyte response. The comparator Erypo 
was  included  in  each  case.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  showed 
similarity between the HX575 and the reference product Eprex/Erypo. 
Secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic drug interactions studies 
were  not  submitted  and  this  is  acceptable  for  this  application  for  marketing  authorisation  of  a 
biosimilar product. 
Within  the  PK  section  of  the  PK/PD  study  in  dog,  the  time  course  of  epoetin  plasma  levels  after 
dosing was determined, and the common PK parameters were determined. These were in rather good 
agreement  between  HX575  and  the  comparator  Erypo.  Distribution,  metabolism  and  excretion  were 
not studied as this is not required according to the relevant European guideline on biosimilarity. 
According  to  the  guideline  EMEA/CHMP/94526/2005,  no  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity  nor 
reproductive toxicity studies are required for biosimilar products. Literature data indicated that epoetin 
alfa failed to induce bacterial gene mutations, chromosomal aberration in cultured mammalian cells, or 
micronuclei in mice. Epoetin alfa is not considered to have mutagenic potential. Literature data also 
indicated that epoetin alfa was not teratogenic in the rat at intravenous doses from 20 to 2,000 U/kg. 
The  antigenic  risk  is  linked  to  the  route,  to  the  frequency  of  administration  and  to  the  presence  of 
immunological  adjuvants  in  the  formulation.  At  the  clinical  level,  this risk has been reduced for the 
reference  product  Eprex/Erypo  by  modifying  the  composition  of  the  final  product;  particularly,  the 
rubber  stoppers  of  the  prefilled  syringes  were  changed.  As  this  is  an  application  for  a  biosimilar 
product  with  a  reference  product  now  authorised  for  intravenous  and subcutaneous route and taking 
into  account  that  the  formulation  of  the  new  drug  product  HX575  is  similar  to  that  of  the  reference 
product Eprex/Erypo, it is considered that the potential immunological adjuvants (stopper leachables)

as reported with the reference medicinal product have been excluded from the final product and that 
antigenicity  risk  linked  to  subcutaneous  administration  of  HX575  is  sufficiently  reduced.  No 
additional non-clinical study is considered relevant on this topic. Antigenic potential was addressed at 
the clinical level.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The  applicant  has  submitted  five  pharmacology  studies  performed  in  healthy  male  volunteers 
investigating  PK  and  PD  of  HX575  after  single  dose  as  well  as  multiple  dose  administration 
intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC). Four of these studies were comparative in nature using either 
Erypo  (epoetin  alfa)  or  NeoRecormon  (epoetin  beta)  as  comparator.  In  addition,  one  confirmative 
phase  3  trial  comparing  efficacy  and  safety  of  IV  administered  HX575  and  Erypo  in  patients  with 
renal anaemia, and one exploratory study assessing efficacy and safety of HX575 in the treatment of 
chemotherapy associated anaemia were submitted. In the latter study, an Erypo group was included as 
a measure of internal validity. 
GCP 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the  community  were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  During the assessment 
there was no indication for non-compliance. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The Applicant has provided results from the following five pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic studies 
performed  in  healthy  volunteers  and  investigating  single  or  multiple  100  IU/kg  (3  times  per  week,

The  assays  employed  for  determination  of  epoetin  plasma  concentrations  in  these  studies  are 
considered qualified for the intended purpose. 
The  Guidance  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  recombinant  erythropoietins 
(EMEA/CHMP/94526/2005) states that “the selected dose should be in the sensitive part of the dose-
response curve”. Although the use of a dose of 100 IU/kg body weight (t.i.w.) has not been justified 
by the applicant, it is nevertheless acceptable since a dose proportional increase in serum epoetin has 
been demonstrated for IV epoetin doses beyond this dose (A. Markham et al. Drug evaluation, 1995). 
In  addition,  this  100IU/kg  dose  is  a  medium  dose  used  for  treatment  in  an  epoetin  sensitive  target 
population, i.e. in patients with renal anaemia.

No equivalence margin had been pre-defined in any of these studies and the post hoc acceptance range 
(80-125%)  has  been  derived  from  the  Note  for  guidance  on  the  investigation  of  bioavailability  and 
bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98)  which  has  been  established  for  chemically  derived 
medicinal products. It is not clear whether this acceptance range can also be applied to biotechnology-
derived  medicinal  products  such  as  epoetin.  Since  clinical  trials  are  required  to  demonstrate 
comparable efficacy and safety of a “biosimilar” medicinal product with the chosen reference product, 
this issue is not critical. 
Study  2003-08–INJ  5  is  considered  the  pivotal  PK  study  for  IV  use.  This  was  a  two-centre,  open, 
randomised, parallel group, repeated dose study. Multiple intravenous doses of 100 IU/kg body weight 
three times a week (t.i.w.) of either Test (HX575) or Reference (Erypo) for a total of 4 weeks were 
given to 80 healthy Caucasian males. All subjects received iron supplementation: 100 mg iron per os 
twice daily during the study period.  The objectives of this study was the comparison of PK and PD of 
epoetin from two different formulations (test, reference) at steady state. 
After single dose IV administration, the lower limit of the 90% CI of the treatment difference in AUC 
[76.9, 93.1] fell below the post hoc defined acceptance range of 80-125% although the 90% CIs for 
Cmax and t1/2 were included. After multiple IV doses (for 4 weeks), however, the 90% CI for both 
AUC and Cmax fell completely within this acceptance range suggesting similar PK profiles of HX575 
and Eprex/Erypo. 
Study 2003-07-INJ-4 was a single centre, open, randomised, four way, 2x2 sequence, cross over pilot 
study;  single  SC  dose  injection  and  IV  bolus  infusion  at  a  dose  of  100  IU/kg  of  HX575  or 
Eprex/Erypo  with  a  washout-time  of  at  least  14  days  between  treatments.  Duration  of  treatment:  10 
days per study period including blood collection. 
In  this  single-dose  pilot  study  2003-07-INJ-4  (N=6),  the  lower  limit  of  the  90%  CI  for  AUC  was 
below  the  post  hoc  defined  acceptance  range  of  80-125%  suggesting  different  bioavailability  of 
HX575 compared to Eprex/Erypo for both IV and SC administration. Cmax was only comparable after 
IV administration. 
Study  2003-09-–INJ-6,  investigating  single  and  multiple  doses  of  SC  administered  epoetin,  did  not 
use Eprex/Erypo as comparator and is therefore not relevant for the demonstration of comparability of 
HX575 and Eprex/Erypo (data not shown).  
Study  2003-12–INJ-7,  using  multiple  dose  SC  injections,  was  initially  planned  as  a  comparative 
study  with  Eprex/Erypo  but  the  comparator  was  dropped.  Therefore,  this  single-arm  study  does  not 
contribute  to  the  comparability  exercise  with  the  chosen  reference  product  Eprex/Erypo  (data  not 
shown). 
Study 2006-19-INJ-12 is considered the pivotal PK study for SC use. This was a monocentric, open, 
randomised,  parallel  group,  repeated  dose  study.  Multiple  subcutaneous  doses  of  100  IU/kg  body 
weight three times a week (t.i.w.) of either Test (HX575) or Reference (Erypo) for a total of 4 weeks 
were given to 80 healthy Caucasian males. 
The primary objective was to assess the biosimilarity of epoetin of HX575 and Eprex at steady state.  
Of 80 randomised patients (ITT population), 74 completed the study (PP population).  Data taken from 
this study indicate that the pharmacokinetic parameters of both products were similar. After single and 
multiple  dose  SC  administration,  the  90%  CI  of  the  treatment  difference  in  AUC  and  Cmax  fell 
completely within the acceptance range of 80-125%. 
Multiple doses of both medications were overall well tolerated: No relevant differences in incidence or 
pattern of adverse events were observed and no clinically relevant anti-EPO antibodies were detected 
in these (immunocompetent) individuals over 4 weeks and IV and SC routes of administration.  
Pharmacodynamics

The  pharmacodynamics  (PD)  of  erythropoietin  is  well  known  and  well  described  in  the  literature. 
After  IV  administration  of  epoetin,  the  typical  pharmacodynamic  profile  shows  an  increase  in 
reticulocytes  count  within  the  first  2  weeks  followed  by  an  increase  in  the  red  blood  cell  level  as 
manifested by haematocrit or Hb determinations within 2 to 6 weeks. After single SC application an 
increase  in  reticulocyte  count  within  3-4  days  with  a  peak  around  day  8-11(13)  a  nd  a  return  to 
baseline by day 22 has been described (R. Ramakrishan et al. J Clin Pharmacol, 2004; W.K. Cheung et 
al. Clin Pharmacol Therapeutics, 1998). A linear relationship between reticulocyte AUC and epoetin 
exposure has been described for single doses up to 1800 IU/kg. (W.K. Cheung et al., Clin Pharmacol 
Therapeutics, 1998). There is high interindividual variability in the reticulocyte response to epoetin.  
The pharmacodynamic effects of HX575 were examined as part of the PK studies as suggested in the 
Guidance  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  recombinant  erythropoietins. 
Reticulocyte count was the main parameter chosen to define the pharmacodynamic response in single 
dose  studies  and  haemoglobin  in  multiple  dose  studies.  Comparators  were  Eprex/Erypo  or 
NeoRecormon (study INJ-6 only). Haematocrit and red blood cell count were also assessed. 
In  study  2003-08–INJ  5,  blood  for  determination  of  Hb,  haematocrit  (HCT),  reticulocyte  count  and 
RBC  count  was  drawn  at predefined time points up to day 29. Primary confirmatory PD parameter: 
Absolute  haemoglobin  response  (AUEC=  Area  under  the  effective  curve)  after  28  days  of  IV 
treatment  with  either  HX575  or  ERYPO.  Initially,  biosimilarity  was  assumed  if  the  90%  CI  of  the 
AUC ratio was within 80%-125%. The acceptance range was then changed to 97%-103% by protocol 
amendment based on Hb concentration changes defined as equivalence margins in phase III studies. 
After both treatments, the AUEC for Hb was similar for both treatments, as indicated by the narrow 
90%  CI  for  the  AUEC  ratio  [98.5%-101.2%]  which  was  enclosed  by  the  a.m.  acceptance  range. 
Reticulocyte count, RBC count and HCT were also similar. Overall PD results of the pivotal PK/PD 
study  2003-08–INJ  5  demonstrated  almost  superimposable  Hb  increases  after  multiple  IV 
administration  of  100  IU/kg  t.i.w.  of  HX575  or  Eprex/Erypo.  The  90%  CI  for  the  ratio  of  the  Hb 
AUEC was in the chosen acceptance range. The 95% CI did not change the conclusion of similar PD 
profiles. 
In  the  comparative  pilot  study  2003-07-INJ-4  blood  for  determination  of  reticulocytes,  Hb  and 
erythrocytes  count  was  performed  pre-dose  on  day  1  and  at  8:00  on  days  2  through  10  in  each 
treatment period. Primary PD parameter: AUC of reticulocytes. After single dose SC administration, 
reticulocytes increased similarly with HX575 and Erypo as indicated by the narrow 90% CIs for the 
treatment difference in AUC0→  last [87.64 – 103.02 ] and Cmax [88.24 – 108.12]. After single dose IV 
administration,  reticulocytes  increased  similarly  with  HX575  and  Erypo  as  indicated  by  the  narrow 
90% CIs for the treatment differences in AUC0→ last [92.5 – 112.8] and Cmax [89.8 – 110.9]. 
Study  INJ-12:  Pharmacodynamic  effects  were  assessed  in  terms  of  Hb,  haematocrit,  reticulocyte 
count and RBC count. Primary confirmatory PD parameter: Absolute haemoglobin response (AUEC= 
Area  under  the  effective  curve)  after  28  days  of  SC  treatment  with  either  HX575  or  Erypo. 
Biosimilarity was assumed if the 90% CI of the AUEC ratio was within 97%-103%.  Both products 
revealed a high degree of similarity (Hb, red blood cell count, haematocrit, reticulocytes, transferrin, 
iron and ferritin). Due to a difference between treatment groups in baseline Hb, the baseline-adjusted 
confidence interval was used. The ratio and confidence interval amounted to 98.5% [97.7% - 100.2%] 
and was thus in the pre-defined acceptance range. 
Discussion on Clinical Pharmacology 
The  focus  of  a  “biosimilar”  application  is  the  demonstration  of  comparability  between  the  new 
product, here HX575, and the reference product, here ERYPO (Janssen Cilag-GmbH, Germany). It is 
not  necessary  for  a  similar  biological  medicinal  product  to  investigate  all  aspects  of  PK  that  have 
already  been  shown  for  the  reference  product.  Therefore,  evaluation  of  PK  aspects  like  absorption, 
distribution, metabolism, elimination, interactions and PK in special populations are not required for 
this application.

The  PK  data  analysis  was  performed  according  to  the  Note  for  guidance  on  the  investigation  of 
bioavailability and bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) and is acceptable. 
The  submitted  data  show  similar  PK  profiles  for  IV  and  SC  administered  HX575  and 
Eprex/Erypo, under steady state conditions. 
Although  not  required  in  the  Guidance  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing 
recombinant  erythropoietins  an  acceptance  range  for  PD  markers  was  defined  by  the  applicant  The 
preferred  PD  marker  in  single  dose  studies,  i.e.  reticulocyte  count,  is  not  an  established  surrogate 
marker  for  efficacy  and  multiple  dose  PD  studies  are  not  required  because  comparative  efficacy 
studies are mandatory. Nevertheless, the PD profiles show that the use of the same IV or SC dose of 
HX575 and Eprex/Erypo results in similar increases in Hb in healthy volunteers. 
The  submitted  data  show  similar  PD  effects  for  IV  and  SC  administered  HX575  and 
Eprex/Erypo. 
Clinical efficacy 
The Applicant has provided efficacy and safety results from two double blind, randomised, parallel-
group,  multicentre  phase  III  studies.  Study  INJ-9  was  designed  to  evaluate  a  1:1  dose  conversion 
from  Eprex/Erypo  to  HX575  with  respect  to  efficacy  based  on  haemoglobin  assessment  in  CRF 
patients on haemodialysis. Study INJ-11 was performed in patients receiving chemotherapy for solid 
tumours.  The  primary  objective  was  to  assess  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  HX575  in  the  treatment  of 
chemotherapy-associated  anaemia.  An  Eprex/Erypo-treated  group  was  included  as  internal  control 
only.

Methods 
•  Design 
This  was  a  randomised,  double  blind  (28  weeks),  multicentre,  parallel-group,  study  to  evaluate  the 
efficacy  and  safety  of  HX575  in  comparison  to  ERYPO  in  patients  with  renal  anaemia  on 
haemodialysis.  
The  first  part  of  the  study  was  designed  as  a  double-blind,  randomized,  multicentre,  parallel-group 
equivalence study and consisted of two steps: (i) Step I (dose adjustment and maintenance of Hb level 
until week 24) followed by: Step II (evaluation period: four week evaluation period to determine the 
primary efficacy endpoint; weeks 25 until 28).  
The second part was a safety study period (from week 29 to week 56)  with all patients switched to 
open-label HX575.

•  Study Participants 
Male and female clinically stable haemodialysis patients, i.e. Hb within the target range of 10.0 to 13.0 
g/dl for at least 12 weeks before screening and a stable IV dose of Erypo for at least 8 weeks before 
screening  and  during  screening  and  a  maximal  weekly  dose  of  300  IU/kg  body  weight.  Stable  dose 
was defined as < 25% change up or down in weekly dose and no change in frequency of injections. 
Patients had to be receiving dialysis for at least 6 months (3 times weekly, t.i.w.) before screening.

•  Treatments 
Eligible patients were randomized 2:1 to receive IV test or reference drug t.i.w., respectively, initially 
maintaining  the  dose  administered  before  randomization.  Subsequently,  dose  adjustments  were 
allowed every three weeks according to a pre-specified algorithm. 
•  Objectives 
Evaluation of a 1:1conversion from Erypo to HX575 with respect to dosage, efficacy and safety. 
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The  primary  endpoint  was  the  mean  absolute  change  in  Hb  levels  between  the  screening/baseline 
period and the evaluation period. Hb level at screening/baseline was defined as the mean of the last 
two Hb measurements prior to day 1 and the measurement at day 1. 
Secondary endpoints: 
-  Mean absolute change in Hb level for the ITT population. 
-  Development of weekly Hb values over the course of the study (from day 1 until week 28) 
- 
- 
Percentage of patients with Hb values within the target range during the study. 
Frequency of responders to treatment according to Definition 1 and 2 
Definition  1:  Mean  Hb  value  during  screening  /baseline  and  during  evaluation  period 
within target range  
Definition  2:  Responder  according  to  definition  1  and  change  in  mean  weekly  dose  ≤ 
25%. 
- 
Frequency of patients with Hb values ≥ 10.0 g/dl at each week and continuously for the study 
(from day 1 until week 28) 
Frequency of patients with changes in the epoetin dosage 
Frequency of patients receiving at least one RBC transfusion 
- 
-  Development of weekly epoetin dosage (in IU and per kg) over the course of the study  
- 
-  Numbers of RBC transfusion per patient 
- 
Type of blood for the RBC transfusion 
-  Overall efficacy as judged by the investigator 
-  Quality of life assessment 
All samples were analysed by a central laboratory. 
•  Sample size 
Sample  size  was  calculated  to  provide  90%  power  to  detect  a  difference  of  0.5  g/dl  in  Hb  between 
treatment groups, including an assumed drop-out/protocol violation rate of 30%. 
•  Blinding (masking) 
At  each  site,  blinded  (investigators)  and  unblinded  (study  nurses  responsible  for  administration  of 
study medication) study personnel had to be involved in order to preserve blinding of the investigator 
(different filling quantities in the syringes with the 2.000 IU dose would have allowed identification of 
type of study medication). The investigator, all other study personnel, and the patients were blind as to 
which study medication a patient received. The staff of the applicant, the clinical research associates 
(except the unblinded clinical research associates responsible for drug accountability) as well as data 
management  and  biostatistics  staff  involved  in  the  study  also  remained  blind  with  respect  to  the 
treatment  assignments  in  the  main  study  until  all  outcome  assessments  for  all  patients  had  been 
completed and the database had been locked.

•  Statistical methods 
Statistical analysis of primary endpoint 
The treatment difference was estimated from an ANCOVA model including factors treatment, centre, 
mean  baseline  Hb  (<  11.5  and  >  11.5  g/dl)  as  factors  and  change  of  the  mean  weekly  dose  from 
screening/baseline  to  the  evaluation  period  of  HX575  or  ERYPO    from  screening/baseline  to  the 
evaluation period as a covariate.  
An equivalence margin of ± 0.5 g/dl in Hb was chosen for demonstration of comparable efficacy. 
The primary efficacy analysis was based on the PP population, which was defined as all patients who 
completed the main study without any major protocol violations. According to the study protocol, the 
following criteria applied among others for including patients into this analysis population: 
-  Receiving only the study treatment to which they were randomised (until week 28) 
-  Compliant with study drug and dose adjustment algorithm 
-  Having at least three Hb measurements during the evaluation period (weeks 25 to 28). 
-  Not receiving any RBC transfusion. 
-  Adequate iron status 
A corresponding analysis for the ITT population, defined as all randomised patients who were treated 
for at least 4 weeks and had at least one post-baseline value of the primary endpoint Hb, served as a 
sensitivity analysis. 
•  Patient disposition 
Five-hundred  and  sixty-eight  (568)  patients  were  screened,  479  patients  (84.3  %)  were  randomized, 
315 (65.8 %) to the HX575 group and 164 (34.2 %) to the Eprex/Erypo group. A total of 261 patients 
(83.1%)  in  the  HX575  group  and  142  patients  (86.6%)  in  the  Erypo  group,  out  of  those  that  were 
randomized and treated, completed the first part of the study.

•  Conduct of the study 
There  were  no  protocol  amendments  that  would  affect  the  study  results.  No  interim  analysis  was 
performed. 
•  Baseline data 
There  were  no  relevant  differences  in  demographic  or  anthropometric  characteristics  between 
treatment groups (see Tables for PP population below). Similarly, there were no relevant differences in

•  Outcomes and estimation 
In the primary PP population, mean change in Hb was 0.147 g/dl in the HX575 group and 0.063 g/dl 
in the ERYPO group (see Table below). The treatment difference was 0.084 g/dl with a 95% CI of [-
0.170; 0.338]. Thus, the CI is within the predefined range of ±0.5 g/dl. 
In the ITT population, mean change in Hb was 0.003 g/dl in the HX575 group and 0.187 g/dl in the 
ERYPO group (see Table below). The treatment difference was 0.189 g/dl with a 95% CI of [-0.039; 
0.418]. As for the primary analysis, the CI is within the predefined range of ±0.5 g/dl. 
There  was  no  statistically  significant  effect  of  centre  (p=0.5800)  or  change  in  epoetin  dosage 
(p=0.7517)  on  the  change  in  Hb.  The  factor  Hb  level  at  baseline  (<11.5  and  ≥11.5  g/dl)  was 
statistically significant (p < 0.0001).

Over the whole course of the study, the range of mean Hb values for the PP population was 11.6 to 
11.9 g/dl for the HX575 group and 11.7 to 12.1 g/dl for the ERYPO group. The mean absolute change 
in Hb from the screening/baseline period to the evaluation period was 0.0 ± 1.1g/dl in the test group 
and -0.2 ± 1.1 g/dl in the reference group.  
The ITT analysis yielded very similar results. 
Percentage of patients with Hb values within the target range of 10.0 to 13.0 g/dl during the study 
In  the  PP  population,  94.2%  of  the  test  and  95.8%  of  the  reference  group  had  baseline  Hb  values 
within the target range. During the evaluation period, frequencies decreased to 85.5% in the test and 
84.7%  in  the  reference  group;  29.0  %  of  the  test  and  29.7  %  of  the  reference  group  had  Hb  values 
within the target range during the whole treatment period. 
The ITT analysis showed very similar results. 
Frequency of treatment responders 
PP population: according to definition I (mean Hb within target range during screening/baseline and 
evaluation period), 80.7% [95% CI: 74.6, 85.8] and 81.4 % [95% CI: 73.1-87.9 ] of the HX575 and 
ERYPO  group,  respectively,  were  responders.  According  to  definition  II  (change  in  mean  weekly 
dosage between baseline and evaluation period ≤25%), 69.6% [95% CI: 62.8-75.8] and 64.4% [95% 
CI:  55.1-73.0]  of  the  HX575  and  ERYPO  group,  respectively,  were  responders.  In  the  ITT 
population, responder rates were somewhat lower but between treatment differences were consistent.  
Frequency of patients with changes in the epoetin dosage 
In  the  PP  population,  at  least  one  dose  adaptation  of  more  than  25%  during  the  whole  study  was 
made in 16.9% of patients in the HX575 and 19.5% of patients in the ERYPO group. 
In the ITT analysis, frequencies were 25% and 26.7% respectively. 
Development of weekly epoetin dosage (in IU/week) over the course of the study  
PP  population:  From  baseline  to  the evaluation period, the mean weekly epoetin dose decreased in 
both  treatment  groups,  by  314  IU/week  (2.2%)  in  the  HX575  and  by  739  IU/week  (8.9%)  in  the 
ERYPO group (see Table below). When expressed as IU/kg per week, similar results were observed: 
the  mean  dosage  was  slightly  higher  in  the  HX575  group  than  in  the  ERYPO  group  (93.7  vs. 
92.8 IU/kg  per  week)  during  the  screening/baseline  period  and  decreased  somewhat  less  to 
90.0 IU/kg/week  and  82.3  IU/kg/week  in  the  HX575  group  and  the  ERYPO  group,  respectively, 
during the evaluation period. 
No centre effect was observed.

In the PP population, two patients of the test group received RBC transfusions during the treatment 
period vs. no patient in the reference group. 
In the ITT group, 19 patients (6.3%) of the test group and 5 patients (3.1%) of the reference group 
received RBC transfusions. 
(ii) Study INJ 11: Treatment of cancer chemotherapy-associated anaemia. 
This was a randomised, multicentre, double blind study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of HX575 
in  the  treatment  of  chemotherapy  associated  anaemia  in  cancer  patients.  The  double-blind  treatment 
period was 12 weeks. The study was not designed as a confirmatory study to demonstrate comparable 
efficacy and safety between HX575 and the Eprex/Erypo. The Eprex/Erypo group was included as a 
measure of internal validity only. 
Due to the contraindication of Eprex/Erypo for SC use in patients with renal anaemia at the time of 
clinical  development,  a  comparative  SC  study  as  described  in  the  biosimilar  guideline  could  not  be 
performed. Instead, the Applicant has performed a non-comparative controlled study in cancer patients 
with  chemotherapy-associated  anaemia  in  support  of  the  oncology  indication  applied  for.  Since  the 
EPO dosages used for cancer patients are usually much higher than those used in CRF patients, such a 
study  was  considered  as  very  useful.  One  hundred  and  fourteen  (114)  patients  were  eligible  for 
inclusion  and  were  randomized  and  treated  with  either  HX575  or  Eprex/Erypo.  Seventy-four  (74) 
patients  were  allocated  to  treatment  with  HX575  and  40  patients  were  allocated  to  treatment  with 
Eprex/Erypo. The Eprex/Erypo group was included as a measure of internal validity only.  The most 
frequently reported primary sites of malignancy were ovary, lung, and breast. 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  defined  as  the  proportion  of  HX  575  treated  patients  with  a  Hb 
response during weeks 5-12 of the study. Hb response was defined as an increase in Hb concentration 
of ≥ 2.0 g/dl from the mean value from the screening/baseline period in the absence of a red blood cell 
transfusion during the preceding 4 weeks. The treatment under investigation, HX575, was considered 
effective  if  the  response  rate  exceeded  the  assumed  placebo  rate  (10  %)  plus  half  the  difference 
between active treatment and placebo (20 %), i.e. approx. 30 %. This primary efficacy analysis was 
based on the ITT population.

Altogether 37 of 60 patients (61.7 %) in the HX575 group responded to the treatment according to the 
above  definition.  The  95%  CI  was  [48.2%;  73.9%]  and  therefore  above  the  pre-defined  efficacy 
margin  of  30%.  In  the  Eprex/Erypo  group,  the  mean  response  rate  was  44.1%  in  the  ITT  group. 
However,  the  chosen  design  and  the  small  sample  size  make  any  comparison  between HSX575 and 
Eprex/Erypo difficult. 
In  conclusion,  HX  575  showed  the  expected  effect  of  an  epoetin  in  cancer  patients  with 
chemotherapy-induced anaemia, however, therapeutic equivalence between HX 575 and Erypo for the 
SC route of administration cannot be concluded from this small exploratory study. 
Discussion on Clinical Efficacy 
17/26 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  clinical  development  programme  is  in  line  with  the  guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal 
products  containing  recombinant  erythropoietins  and  previous  scientific  advice.    However,  one 
exception is noted, i.e. the recommendation to provide results from at least two adequately powered, 
randomised, parallel group clinical trials demonstrating comparable efficacy and safety for both routes 
of  administration  in  patients  with  renal  anaemia.    It  is  acknowledged  that  at  the  time  of  clinical 
development Eprex/Erypo could not be used as comparator in SC studies in renal anaemia patients and 
therefore no second randomised, parallel group clinical trial with the SC route of application could be 
conducted. Under these circumstances, the deviation from the guideline is considered to be acceptable. 
Study INJ-9 was performed in patients with renal anaemia, optimally titrated (prior to randomisation) 
on  the  reference  product  as  suggested  in  the  Guidance  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products 
containing recombinant erythropoietins. The observed difference in Hb change was low between both 
treatments  and  within  the  pre-defined  and  acceptable  equivalence  boundaries  of  ±  0.5  g/dl.  All 
secondary  endpoints,  most  importantly  change  in  epoetin  dose,  also  supported  the  conclusion  of 
therapeutic equivalence between Eprex/Erypo and HX575.  
Comparable  efficacy  between  HX575  and  Eprex/Erypo  has  been  established  for  the  IV  route  of 
administration.  However,  study  INJ-11  was  not  designed  and  too  small  to  establish  comparable 
efficacy  for  the  SC  route  of  administration.  Nevertheless,  based  on  the  demonstration  of  equivalent 
efficacy  and  steady  state  pharmacokinetics  and  pharmacodynamics  for  IV  administered  HX575  and 
Eprex/Erypo, and the finding of similar multiple dose SC pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic profiles 
in  healthy  volunteers,  a  difference  in  efficacy  for    the  SC  route  of  administration  appears  highly 
unlikely.  
Clinical safety 
The clinical safety of HX575 has been assessed in five Phase I studies conducted in healthy volunteers 
and  in  two  Phase  III  studies  conducted  in  adult  dialysis  patients  and  oncology  patients.  The  total 
population valid for safety (SAF) consists of 98 healthy volunteers, 478 chronic renal failure patients 
and 114 cancer patients. 
In the submitted studies, the presence of anti-epoetin antibodies was checked at 4-8 week intervals in 
the renal anaemia population, at 6-week intervals in the oncology population and at 2-week intervals 
in the multidose PK/PD studies in healthy volunteers.  
Adverse events, serious adverse events (SAEs) and deaths 
Healthy volunteer studies 
In the healthy volunteer population, the SOCs most frequently affected in both treatment groups were 
gastrointestinal  disorders  (diarrhoea  and  nausea),  and  nervous  system  disorder  (dizziness, 
paraesthesia). There were no serious, significant or severe adverse events (except one non-related SAE 
of hearing loss), and all events resolved completely. No anti-epoetin antibody has been identified by 
ELISA or RIP measurements. 
Study INJ-9 (adult dialysis patients) 
A total of 314 patients with renal anaemia were exposed to a mean dose of 7,043 IU/week of HX575 
administered IV for an average of 25.5 weeks. Including the 28-week uncontrolled extension phase, a 
total of 211 patients were continuously exposed to HX575 for 54 weeks and 117 patients (those that 
switched from Eprex/Erypo to HX575 at week 28) for 26 weeks.  
The majority of patients was older than 65 years of age. The primary cause of anaemia / chronic renal 
failure,  were:  chronic  glomerulonephritis  and  diabetes.  Other  common  reasons  were  hypertension, 
polycystic  kidney  disease,  interstitial  nephritis,  and  urologic  diseases.  The  mean  time  since  start  of 
dialysis was 56.3 months in the HX575 group, and 54.1 months in patients treated with Eprex/Erypo. 
Globally, the adverse event profile was consistent with this advanced dialysis patient population, and 
comparable  between  both  groups.  Vascular  disorders  were  somewhat  more  frequently  reported  with 
18/26 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
HX575  (32.2%  versus  26.8%),  mainly  vascular  hypotensive  or  hypertensive  disorders.  Similarly, 
slightly more cardiac disorders (16.9%), mainly ischemic disorders, were observed with HX575 versus 
Eprex/Erypo (13.4%).  
A  total  of  357  treatment-emergent  SAEs  were  documented  in  168  patients  of  the  SAF  population: 
258 SAEs  in  112  patients  (35.7%)  of  the  HX575  group,  and  99  SAEs  in  56  patients (34.1%) of the 
Eprex/Erypo group. 
The death rate was consistent with the severe medical condition of these patients. All deaths but one 
were assessed as unrelated to the study drug by the investigator, and the coordinating investigator.  At 
baseline,  the  two  populations  were  comparable  with  respect  to  current  medical  condition,  especially 
regarding cardiovascular condition.  
Immunogenicity 
Based on the results obtained with the RIP and NAB assays, no increased immunogenicity was found 
for HX575 vs. Eprex/Erypo. Transient non-neutralising antibodies occurred in HX575 treated and in 
the Eprex/Erypo treated patients with renal anaemia to a similar extent. Six patients (2 in the HX575 
group, 4 in the Eprex/Erypo / HX575 group) had a result above cut-off at visit 28 or visit 42 in the RIP 
assay. One patient had a first positive RIP result after the switch from Eprex/Erypo to HX575 at the 
last  visit  (visit  56)  but  no  follow-up  could  be  provided  since  this  patient  had  died  3-4  months  after 
study termination due to cardiac insufficiency. Two patients had antibodies from baseline throughout 
the  study,  indicating  that  the  previous  treatment  rather  than  HX575  may  be  the  culprit.  One  of  the 
latter  patients  also  had  a  borderline  positive  result  in  the  NAB  assay  indicative  for  neutralising 
antibodies. Overall, none of the patients showed any signs of sudden Hb or reticulocyte decrease or 
any other symptom, which would have been indicative of pure red cell aplasia (PRCA) although the 
patient with the borderline positive result in the NAB assay required high EPO doses. However, the 
Applicants could provide evidence with their Day120 Responses that the borderline positive NAB test 
in  this  patient  occurred  on  only  one  occasion  and  that  the  patient  had  no  other  signs  suggestive  of 
PRCA. 
The Applicant has also provided results from the part II of study INJ 9 (weeks 26 to 52).  A total of 
2662 AEs were reported in 350 patients (90.7%) in the safety period (part II). The number of AEs in 
part II was 1736 in 223 patients (89.6%) of the HX575 group and 926 in 127 patients (92.7%) of the 
Eprex/HX575 group. The majority of AEs was of mild or moderate intensity, transient and resolved 
completely by the end of the study.  
Twenty-five  AEs  in  11  patients  (4.4%)  in  part  II  in  the  HX575  group  were  assessed  as  being  drug-
related,  whereas  one  AE  in  part  II  in  one  patient  (0.7%)  were  reported  as  drug-related  in  the 
Eprex/Erypo /HX575 group. 
In part II of the study a total of 280 SAEs were documented in 136 patients: 187 SAEs in 87 Patients 
(34.9%) of the HX575 group, and 93 SAEs in 49 patients (35.8%) of the Eprex/Erypo/HX575 group. 
All  SAEs  were  assessed  as  unrelated  to  study  medication.    Altogether,  9  patients  of  the 
Eprex/Erypo/HX575 group and 5 of the HX575 group (3.6% in each group) died during part II of the 
study or shortly after end of study.  Taken together, the data did not elicit any safety concerns genuine 
to HX575.

Study INJ-11 (cancer patients) 
A  total  of  114  cancer  patients  with  chemotherapy  associated  anaemia  were  included  in  the  safety 
analysis, 74 of whom were exposed to a mean dose of 34,587 IU/week of HX575 administered SC for 
an average of 8.5 weeks (shorter than the planned 12week study duration due to high drop out rate). 
The most frequently reported primary sites of malignancy in the SAF population were ovary, lung and 
breast. No patients with malignant haemopathy were included.  Globally, the medical status of these 
advanced cancer patient population was not significantly different at baseline between both treatment 
arms.  However  both  arms  were  not  well  balanced  with  regard  to  the  type  of  cancer,  TNM 
classification and chemotherapy (e.g., Vinca alkaloids and Pyrimidine analogues were more frequently 
administered to patients in the Eprex/Erypo arm).  
Although there was no significant difference between the two groups regarding the tolerability of the 
treatment, some numerical differences can be outlined: 
- 
- 
nervous  system  disorders  were  more  frequently  reported  in  HX575  group  (20.3%  versus 
12.5%), as well as neurological signs and symptoms (13.5 % versus 2.5%). Of note, nervous 
system  disorders  were  more  frequently  reported  with  Eprex/Erypo  in  healthy  volunteer 
studies. 
similarly, blood and lymphatic system disorders were reported in 21.6% of patients in HX575 
group versus 15% with Eprex/Erypo, as well as neutropenia (6.8% versus 0%).  
A total of 106 treatment-emergent SAEs were reported in 52 patients, 66 events in 34 patients (45.9%) 
of  the  HX575  group  and  40  events  in  18  patients  (45.0%)  of  the  Erypo  group.  In  general,  SAEs 
concerned problems caused by the underlying disease and chemotherapy. With the exception of one 
SAE (hypertensive episode) in the HX575 group, all other events were assessed as being unrelated to 
study  drug.  No  difference  between  the  treatment  groups  could  be  seen.  However,  in  contrast  with 
study INJ-9, cardiac disorders SAEs were more frequently reported in Eprex/Erypo group.  
A total of 30 patients died during the study or shortly after terminating the study: 18 patients (24.3%) 
in HX575 group and 12 patients (30.0%) in Eprex/Erypo group. None of these deaths was assessed as 
drug-related by the investigator. The high incidences of deaths are consistent with the advanced stage 
of cancer in these patients, and most of them died of progressive disease. 
Regarding  anti  epoetin  antibodies,  a  result  above  cut-off  was  detected  in  one  patient  in  the  HX575 
group at baseline, before application of the first dose of study medication. 
In  conclusion  no  new  safety  concern  has  arisen  in  this  clinical  trial  performed  in  patients  receiving 
chemotherapy. However, the size of population enrolled is too limited to allow a definitive conclusion.

Overall, the adverse reactions observed in the clinical trials conducted with HX575 are similar to those 
observed with the reference product Erypro and other epoetins.  
Three  important  risks  associated  with  erythropoietin  treatment  in  general  are:  1)  occurrence  of  pure 
red  cell  aplasia  (PRCA)  2)  thrombotic  vascular  events  (TVE)  3)  possible  tumour  growth  promoting 
potential (concern in oncology patients).

Proposed Studies INJ-13, -14 and -17 
The applicant has proposed further studies:  2006-65-INJ-13, 2006-66-INJ-14 and 2007-22-INJ-17  in 
addition to routine pharmacovigilance activities to further investigate the safety profile of HX 575. 
Study 2006-65-INJ-13 is a cohort study which aims to prospectively monitor the incidence of pure red 
cell aplasia among CKD subjects receiving HX575 S.C. All observed AEs and SAEs will be reported 
within  the  scope  of  the  PSURs.  The  study  will  commence  once  the  SC  use  of  HX  575  has  been 
approved for the renal anaemia indication. 
Study 2006-66-INJ-14 is a cohort study which aims to prospectively monitor the incidence of relevant 
drug-related  adverse  events  and  EPO-related  loss  of  efficacy  among  chronic  renal  failure  subjects 
receiving HX575 intravenously. This safety study will provide additional data concerning the risk of 
thrombotic vascular events (TVE) including serious and life threatening cardiovascular complications. 
All observed AEs and SAEs will be reported within the scope of the PSURs.  
Study 2007-22-INJ-17 is a randomized, controlled, double-blind multicentre safety study to evaluate 
the  safety  and  immunogenicity  of  subcutaneous  HX575  versus  Erypo  in  the  treatment  of  anaemia 
associated with chronic renal insufficiency in predialysis patients.  
Determination of epoetin antibody levels in the serum will be carried out at a single laboratory using a 
validated radioimmunoprecipitation assay.    
Regarding  statistical  analysis,  as  PRCA  events  may  occur  (even  rarely)  in  less  than  one  month 
(minimum  =  0.3  month)  after  initiation  of  treatment,  all  PRCA  events  are  considered  whatever 
duration of exposure, as requested by CHMP. 
The  CHMP  was  concerned  that  despite  the  proposed  risk  minimisation  activities  to  limit  the  use  in 
renal  failure  patients  to  the  IV  route,  there  may  still  be  off-label  use  in  this  group  of  patients.    The 
MAA committed to perform a survey 6 months after HX575 enters the market to establish the actual

use  of  HX575.  This  survey  will  be  addressed  to  nephrologists  and  dialysis  centres  and  will  cover 
about 85% of the epoetin alfa market. 
For  each  important  safety  concern,  routine  minimization  measure  is  proposed.  Additional  risk 
minimization  activities  are  considered  to  be  necessary  to  reduce  the  potential  for  off-label  sub-
cutaneous use. 
1.1  Laboratory findings 
Study 2003-29-INJ-09 (in patients with renal anaemia) 
There were no differences between the treatment groups for the parameters erythrocytes, reticulocytes, 
haematocrit,  leucocytes  and  platelets.  The  mean  and  median  values  remained  stable  over  time.  In 
general, those patients who had abnormal values at visit –1 also had abnormal values at visits 16 and 
28. 
Also for clinical chemistry parameters as well as iron, ferritin and transferrin saturation, there were no 
relevant  differences  between  the  treatment  groups.  Approximately  20  %  of  patients  had  clinically 
relevant  abnormal  potassium  values,  and  approximately  30  %  of  patients  had  clinically  relevant 
abnormal phosphate values in both treatment groups.  
Study 2003-31-INJ-11 (in patients with chemotherapy associated anaemia) 
There  were  no  treatment  differences  for  the  parameters  erythrocytes,  reticulocytes,  haematocrit, 
leucocytes  and  platelets.  The  mean  values  remained  stable  over  time.  In  general,  those  patients  that 
had abnormal values at visit –1 or visit 0 also had abnormal values at visits 6 and 12. 
Clinical chemistry parameters, urine analysis, serum iron and ferritin levels and transferrin saturation 
were not relevantly different between treatment groups. It is known that increased serum ferritin levels 
occur  in  patients  with  malignancies.  In  both  treatment  groups,  mean  serum  ferritin  levels  were 
elevated. 
Discussion on Clinical Safety 
Overall, there was no significant difference between the treatment groups for the incidence or type of 
adverse events. Thus, HX575 revealed an AE profile (including immunogenicity) similar to that of the 
chosen comparator ERYPO. 
Risk  of  tumour  growth  potential  of  erythropoietin  stimulating  agents  in  patients  with  chemotherapy 
induced anaemia 
The risk of tumour growth potential of erythropoietin stimulating agents (class effect) in patients with 
chemotherapy induced anaemia is currently under discussion in the PhVWP.

During  the  evaluation  of  HX575  a  major  objection  was  initially  raised.  Satisfactory  responses  have 
been provided to resolve this concern.  
Other concerns have also been adequately addressed, in particular several commitments made by the 
applicant and several follow-up measures are defined to provide further information post-approval.  
Non-clinical pharmacology and toxicology 
Primary  pharmacodynamic  studies  showed  similarity  between  the  HX575  and  the  reference  product 
Eprex/Erypo. 
In  addition,  five  non-clinical  studies  were  submitted  by  the  applicant  in  order  to  demonstrate  the 
comparability of HX575 to the reference product Eprex/Erypo and to demonstrate the safety and local 
tolerability  of  HX575.  Pivotal  studies  were  undertaken  in  dogs  and  rabbits.  The  13-week  toxicity 
study performed in the dog, with intravenously administered 100 or 500 IU/kg HX575 drug product or 
500 IU/kg Eprex/Erypo, allowed investigation of potential systemic toxicity of the product. This study 
revealed no signs of overt toxicity. The lack of investigations following subcutaneous administration 
was  discussed  during  the  procedure.  This  was  considered  to  be  acceptable  taking  into  account  that: 
1) potential  systemic  toxicity  following  subcutaneous  administration  is  covered  by  the  intravenous 
study, 2) local tolerance has been investigated in the rabbit following subcutaneous administration and 
3) animal models are usually not useful to predict immunogenicity in humans.  
Local tolerance was tested in two studies in the rabbit following a single intravenous, intramuscular, 
intra-arterial,  intra-venous  and  subcutaneous  injection  administration.  Results  indicated  that  the 
epoetin  injection  solution  HX575  had  good  local  tolerability  in  rabbits  via  all  tested  routes  of 
administration for doses up to 10,000 IU/animal. As a result, no local effects are expected following 
accidental incorrect administration. 
Efficacy 
The  Applicant  has  provided  Pharmacology  results  from  five  studies  in  healthy  subjects  following 
single  dose  and/or  repeat  dose  exposure.  Efficacy  and  safety  data  were  obtained  from  two  double-
blind, randomised, multicenter studies investigating efficacy and safety of HX575 for the treatment of 
anaemia in haemodialysis (INJ-9) or in cancer patients (INJ-11). As notably requested by the CHMP, 
results from a new pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study (INJ 12) were provided. 
Intravenous administration of Epoetin alfa 
The submitted PK/PD studies showed comparable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles of 
HX575  and  Eprex/Erypo  at  steady  state  in  healthy  subjects  and  therefore  supports  the  claimed 
biosimilarity of both products. 
The primary endpoint of study INJ-9 was the mean absolute change in Hb level between the baseline 
period and the evaluation period. The observed difference in Hb change was low and within the pre-
defined  and  acceptable  equivalence  boundaries  of  ±  0.5  g/dl.  All  secondary  endpoints,  most 
importantly change in epoetin dose, also supported the conclusion of therapeutic equivalence between 
Eprex/Erypo and HX575 after I.V. administration.  
Subcutaneous administration of epoetin alfa 
(i) Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic Results 
The  multiple  dose  study  INJ-12  revealed  similar  PK  and  PD  profiles  of  HX  575  and  Erypo  and 
therefore supports the claimed biosimilarity of both products. 
(ii) Clinical efficacy data

Study  INJ-11  was  a  non-comparative  study  in  cancer  patients  with  chemotherapy-induced  anaemia. 
The primary efficacy endpoint was defined as the Hb response (increase of ≥ 2.0 g/dl from baseline) in 
the HX575 treatment group during weeks 5-12 of the study in the absence of RBC transfusions. An 
Eprex/Erypo arm was included for internal validity only.  
The study results demonstrate that HX 575 has the expected effects of an epoetin. Due to the desing 
and  the  small  number  of  patients,  the  study  does  not  allow  any  conclusion  on  whether  this effect is 
comparable to that of Erypo.

together  with 
Safety 
No new safety concern specific to HX575 has arisen during the clinical trials, and the safety profiles 
of HX575 and Eprex/Erypo are comparable.  
In  addition,  no  increased  immunogenicity  was  found  for  HX575  compared  to  Eprex/Erypo  and  no 
definite  neutralizing  antibodies  (although  one  transient  borderline  result)  have  been  detected.  The 
observational  study  proposed  by  the  Applicant  is  considered  as  sufficient  to  further  investigate  the 
potential immunogenic risk of this biosimilar erythropoietin. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics 
Having  considered  the  safety  concerns  in  the  risk  management  plan,  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
proposed activities described in section 3.5 adequately addressed these. 
No immunogenicity data for SC use in the population at risk for antibody-induced PRCA, i.e. patients 
with renal anaemia have been provided by the Applicant because at the time of clinical development 
Eprex/Erypo could not be used as comparator in SC studies in renal anaemia patients, and therefore no 
comparative  phase  3  study  could  be  conducted.  Because  of  the  lack  of  such  data,  the  SC  use  is 
currently  not  recommended  in  patients  with  renal  anaemia.  The  applicant  is  committed  to  provide  a 
comparative  SC  study  in  accordance  with  the  note  for  guidance  on  similar  biological  medicinal 
products containing recombinant erythropoietins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/94526/2005). 
•  User consultation 
A satisfactory user consultation for readability of the patient leaflet has been undertaken. 
Risk-benefit assessment 
The submitted data demonstrated similar PK, PD, efficacy and safety of I.V. administered HX575 and 
Eprex/Erypo.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  considered  the  benefit-risk  ratio  of  HX575  positive  for  the  I.V. 
indications applied for. 
In  addition,  a  multiple  dose  PK/PD  study  in  healthy  volunteers,  submitted  with  the  D120  response 
document,  demonstrated  comparable  PK  and  PD  of  S.C.  administered  HX575  and  Eprex/Erypo.  A 
comparative trial evaluating the S.C. route in CKD patients as suggested in the Guideline on similar 
biological  medicinal  products  containing  recombinant  erythropoietins  has  not  been  performed  and 
this is acceptable because the temporary contraindication of the S.C. route of administration in CKD 
patients  for  the  reference  product  precluded  the  conduct  of  such  a  study  at  the  time  of  clinical 
development  of  HX  575.  Instead,  a  non-comparative  S.C.  trial  has  been  conducted  in  oncology 
patients with chemotherapy-induced anaemia, which included an Erypo/Eprex arm as internal control. 
This study demonstrated efficacy of HX575 according to the pre-defined response criteria.  
25/26 
©EMEA 2007 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Despite these short-comings, the benefit-risk ratio is considered positive for S.C. use of HX575 in the 
oncology  indication  because  1)  the  finding  of  similar  PK/PD  profiles  for  the  S.C.  route  of 
administration together with the similar PK/PD and efficacy for the I.V. route makes a difference in 
efficacy for the S.C. route of administration highly unlikely, 2) the safety data from the oncology trial 
did not reveal any safety concerns beyond those known for Eprex/Erypo or other epoetins. 
Since  the  risk  of  anti-epoetin  antibody  induced  PRCA  is  highest  with  S.C.  use  of  epoetin  in  CKD 
patients, extrapolation of antibody data from I.V. to S.C. use or from immunocompromised (oncology) 
to  immunocompetent  (CKD)  patients  is  not  possible.  Due  to  the  lack  of  adequate  safety  and 
particularly  immunogenicity  data  in  CKD  patients  (S.C.),  the  risk-benefit  ratio  for  S.C.  use  in  CKD 
patients was considered unfavourable. The applicant has planned a comparative efficacy/safety trial be 
performed  according  to  the  Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing 
recombinant erythropoietins. Use of HX575 should be restricted to I.V. administration in this patient 
population. 
A risk management plan was submitted which adequately addresses all concerns. The CHMP, having 
considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the 
use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to further investigate some of the safety concerns and 
additional risk minimisation activities as detailed in section 2.3 were required. 
Recommendation 
Based  on  the  CHMP  review  of  data  on  quality,  safety  and  efficacy,  the  CHMP  considered  by 
consensus that the risk-benefit balance of HX575 in the treatment of  
•  anaemia  associated  with  chronic  renal  failure  in  paediatric  and  adult  patients  on 
haemodialysis and adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (see Section 4.4). 
•  severe  anaemia  of  renal  origin  accompanied  by  clinical  symptoms  in  adult  patients  with 
renal insufficiency not yet undergoing dialysis (see Section 4.4). 
•  anaemia and reduction of transfusion requirements in adult patients receiving chemotherapy 
for solid tumours, malignant lymphoma or multiple myeloma, and at risk of transfusion as 
assessed by the patient's general status (e.g. cardiovascular status, pre-existing anaemia at 
the start of chemotherapy).  
•  reduction  of  exposure  to  allogenic  blood  transfusions  in  adult  non-iron  deficient  patients 
prior  to  major  elective  orthopaedic  surgery,  having  a  high  perceived  risk  for  transfusion 
complications.  Use  should  be  restricted  to  patients  with  moderate  anaemia  (e.g.  Hb  10-
13 g/dl)  who  do  not  have  an  autologous  predonation  programme  available  and  with  an 
expected blood loss of 900 to 1800 ml. 
was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

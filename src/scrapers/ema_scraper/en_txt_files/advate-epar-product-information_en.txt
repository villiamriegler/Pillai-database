ANNEX I
SUMMARY OF PRODUCT CHARACTERISTICS
1
1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ADVATE 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 250 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE 
contains approximately 50 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after 
reconstitution.
The potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic 
assay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4 520-11 300 IU/mg protein.
Octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. 
It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared 
without the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, 
purification or final formulation.
Excipients with known effect
This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder and solvent for solution for injection.
Powder: White to off-white friable powder.
Solvent: Clear and colourless solution.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.
Posology
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition.
The number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the 
WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for 
factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma.
2
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor 
VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is 
determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

(pre- and postoperative)
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) for at least 1 day, until the 
bleeding episode, as indicated by pain, 
is resolved or healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until 
pain and acute disability are resolved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 12 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for 
patients under the age of 6), at 
least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) until adequate wound healing, 
then continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII 
activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual 
case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those 
calculated using the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to 
guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 
factor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor 
VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
3
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses 
are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
Paediatric population
For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from 
adult patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 
3 to 4 times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.
Method of administration
ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health 
care professional appropriate training is needed.
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH 
of 6.7 to 7.3.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or 
hamster proteins.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. 
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, 
patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
Inhibitors
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure 
days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
4
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.
Catheter-related complications in treatment
If central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Excipient related considerations
Sodium
This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the 
medicinal product.
Paediatric population
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-
feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE 
reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency 
were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.
5
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).
Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions 
may be observed.
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated
with factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.

Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418).
The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during 
continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis 
was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance 
rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays 
performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.
ADR explained in the section below.
Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe 
haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients
Description of selected adverse reactions
ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process
Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 
protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or 
transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who 
were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward 
trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients 
reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst 
repeated exposures to the study product.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, 
flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.
Paediatric population
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.
The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII 
glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass 
of 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand 
Factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts 
prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are 
increased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency.
Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a 
sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart 
review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective 
registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed 
ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.
In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an 
individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII 
per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen 
(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to 
a specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval 
of 72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are 
comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency) in "Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor 
VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII" and "treatment and prophylaxis of 
bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)". (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was 
conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.
A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters 
that were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 
month to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), 
8
adolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize 
PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of 
adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young 
children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma 
volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute 
toxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity.

Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.
Posology
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition.
The number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the 
WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for 
factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma.
14
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor 
VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is 
determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) for at least 1 day, until the 
bleeding episode, as indicated by pain, 
is resolved or healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until 
pain and acute disability are resolved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 12 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for 
patients under the age of 6), at 
least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) until adequate wound healing, 
then continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII 
activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual 
case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those 
calculated using the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to 
guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 
factor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor 
VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
15
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses 
are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
Paediatric population
For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult 
patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 
times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.
Method of administration
ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health 
care professional appropriate training is needed.
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH 
of 6.7 to 7.3.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or 
hamster proteins.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. 
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, 
patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
Inhibitors
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure 
days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
16
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.
Catheter-related complications in treatment
If central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Excipient related considerations
Sodium
This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the 
medicinal product.
Paediatric population
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-
feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE 
reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency 
were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.
17
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).
Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions 
may be observed.
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.

Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418).
The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during 
continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis 
was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance 
rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays 
performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.
ADR explained in the section below.
Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe 
haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients
Description of selected adverse reactions
ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process
Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 
protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or 
transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who 
were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward 
trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients 
reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst 
repeated exposures to the study product.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, 
flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.
Paediatric population
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.
The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII 
glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass 
of 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand 
Factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts 
prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are 
increased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency.
Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within 
a sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart 
review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective 
registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed 
ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.
In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an 
individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII 
per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen 
(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to 
a specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval 
of 72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are 
comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency) in "Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor 
VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII" and "treatment and prophylaxis of 
bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)". (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was 
conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.
A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters 
that were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 
month to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), 
20
adolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize 
PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of 
adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young 
children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma 
volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute 
toxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity.

1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ADVATE 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 1000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE 
contains approximately 200 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after 
reconstitution.
The potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic 
assay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4 520-11 300 IU/mg protein.
Octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. 
It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared 
without the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, 
purification or final formulation.
Excipients with known effect

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.
Posology
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition.
The number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the 
WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for 
factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma.
26
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor 
VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is 
determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) for at least 1 day, until the 
bleeding episode, as indicated by pain, 
is resolved or healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain 
and acute disability are resolved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for 
patients under the age of 6), at 
least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII 
activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual 
case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those 
calculated using the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to 
guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 
factor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor 
VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
27
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses 
are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
Paediatric population
For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult 
patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 
times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.
Method of administration
ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health 
care professional appropriate training is needed.
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH 
of 6.7 to 7.3.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or 
hamster proteins.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. 
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, 
patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
Inhibitors
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure 
days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
28
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.
Catheter-related complications in treatment
If central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Excipient related considerations
Sodium
This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the 
medicinal product.
Paediatric population
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-
feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE 
reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency 
were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.
29
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).
Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions 
may be observed.
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.

Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418).
The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during 
continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis 
was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance 
rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays 
performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.
ADR explained in the section below.
Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe 
haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients
Description of selected adverse reactions
ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process
Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 
protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or 
transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who 
were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward 
trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients 
reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst 
repeated exposures to the study product.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, 
flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.
Paediatric population
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.
The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII 
glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass 
of 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand 
Factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts 
prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are 
increased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency.
Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a 
sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart 
review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective 
registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed 
ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.
In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an 
individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII 
per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen 
(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to 
a specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval 
of 72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are 
comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency) in "Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor 
VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII" and "treatment and prophylaxis of 
bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)". (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was 
conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.
A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters 
that were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 
month to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), 
32
adolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize 
PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of 
adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young 
children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma 
volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute 
toxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity.

1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ADVATE 1500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 1500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE 
contains approximately 300 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after 
reconstitution.
The potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic 
assay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4 520-11 300 IU/mg protein.
Octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. 
It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared 
without the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, 
purification or final formulation.
Excipients with known effect
This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder and solvent for solution for injection.
Powder: White to off-white friable powder.
Solvent: Clear and colourless solution.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.
Posology
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition.
The number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the 
WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for 
factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma.
38
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor 
VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is 
determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

is resolved or healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until 
pain and acute disability are resolved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 12 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for 
patients under the age of 6), at 
least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) until adequate wound healing, 
then continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII 
activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual 
case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those 
calculated using the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to 
guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 
factor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor 
VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
39
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses 
are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
Paediatric population
For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult 
patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 
times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.
Method of administration
ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health 
care professional appropriate training is needed.
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH 
of 6.7 to 7.3.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or 
hamster proteins.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. 
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, 
patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
Inhibitors
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure 
days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
40
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.
Catheter-related complications in treatment
If central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Excipient related considerations
Sodium
This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the 
medicinal product.
Paediatric population
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-
feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE 
reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency 
were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.
41
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).
Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions 
may be observed.
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.

Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418).
The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during 
continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis 
was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance 
rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays 
performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.
ADR explained in the section below.
Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe 
haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients
Description of selected adverse reactions
ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process
Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 
protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or 
transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who 
were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward 
trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients 
reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst 
repeated exposures to the study product.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, 
flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.
Paediatric population
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.
The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII 
glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass 
of 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand 
Factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts 
prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are 
increased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency.
Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a 
sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart 
review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective 
registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed 
ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.
In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an 
individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII 
per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen 
(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to 
a specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval 
of 72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are 
comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency) in "Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor 
VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII" and "treatment and prophylaxis of
bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)". (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was 
conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.
44
A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters 
that were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants 
(1 month to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), 
adolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize 
PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of 
adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young 
children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma 
volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute 
toxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity.

NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ADVATE 2000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 2000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE 
contains approximately 400 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after 
reconstitution.
The potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic 
assay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4 520-11 300 IU/mg protein.
Octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. 
It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared 
without the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, 
purification or final formulation.
Excipients with known effect
This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.
Posology
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition.
The number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the 
WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for 
factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma.
50
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor 
VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is 
determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) for at least 1 day, until the 
bleeding episode, as indicated by pain, 
is resolved or healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until 
pain and acute disability are resolved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 12 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for 
patients under the age of 6), at 
least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 24 hours for patients under the 
age of 6) until adequate wound healing, 
then continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII 
activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual 
case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those 
calculated using the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to 
guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 
factor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor 
VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
51
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses 
are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
Paediatric population
For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult 
patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 
times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.
Method of administration
ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health 
care professional appropriate training is needed.
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH 
of 6.7 to 7.3.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or 
hamster proteins.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. 
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, 
patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
Inhibitors
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure 
days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
52
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.
Catheter-related complications in treatment
If central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Excipient related considerations
Sodium
This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the 
medicinal product.
Paediatric population
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-
feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE 
reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency 
were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.
53
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).
Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions 
may be observed.
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.

Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418).
The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during 
continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis 
was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance 
rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays 
performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.
ADR explained in the section below.
Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe 
haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients
Description of selected adverse reactions
ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process
Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 
protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or 
transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who 
were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward 
trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients 
reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst 
repeated exposures to the study product.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, 
flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.
Paediatric population
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.
The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII 
glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass 
of 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand 
Factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts 
prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are 
increased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency.
Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within 
a sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart 
review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective 
registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed 
ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.
In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an 
individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII 
per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen 
(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a 
specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of 
72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are 
comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency) in "Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor 
VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII" and "treatment and prophylaxis of 
bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)". (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was 
conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.
A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters 
that were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 
month to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), 
56
adolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize 
PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of 
adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young 
children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma 
volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.

1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ADVATE 3000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 3000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE 
contains approximately 600 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after 
reconstitution.
The potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic 
assay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4 520-11 300 IU/mg protein.
Octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. 
It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared 
without the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, 
purification or final formulation.
Excipients with known effect
This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder and solvent for solution for injection.
Powder: White to off-white friable powder.
Solvent: Clear and colourless solution.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.
Posology
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition.
The number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the 
WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for 
factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma.
62
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor 
VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is 
determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) for at least 1 day, until the 
bleeding episode, as indicated by pain, 
is resolved or healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain 
and acute disability are resolved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for 
patients under the age of 6), at 
least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII 
activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual 
case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those 
calculated using the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to 
guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 
factor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor 
VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
63
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses 
are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
Paediatric population
For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult 
patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 
times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.
Method of administration
ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health 
care professional appropriate training is needed.
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH 
of 6.7 to 7.3.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or 
hamster proteins.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. 
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, 
patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
Inhibitors
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure 
days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
64
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.
Catheter-related complications in treatment
If central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Excipient related considerations
Sodium
This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the 
medicinal product.
Paediatric population
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-
feeding only if clearly indicated.
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE 
reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency 
were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.
65
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).
Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions 
may be observed.
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.

Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418).
The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during 
continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis 
was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance 
rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays 
performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.
ADR explained in the section below.
Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe 
haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients
Description of selected adverse reactions
ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process
Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 
protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or 
transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who 
were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward 
trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients 
reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst 
repeated exposures to the study product.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, 
flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.
Paediatric population
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.
The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII 
glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass 
of 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand 
Factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts 
prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are 
increased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency.
Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a 
sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart 
review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective 
registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed 
ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.
In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an 
individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII 
per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen 
(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a 
specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of 
72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are 
comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency) in "Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor 
VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII" and "treatment and prophylaxis of 
bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)". (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was 
conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.
A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters 
that were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 
month to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), 
68
adolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize 
PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of 
adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young 
children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma 
volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute 
toxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity.

1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ADVATE 250 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 250 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE 
contains approximately 125 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after 
reconstitution.
The potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic 
assay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4 520-11 300 IU/mg protein.
Octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. 
It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared 
without the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, 
purification or final formulation.
Excipients with known effect
This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder and solvent for solution for injection.
Powder: White to off-white friable powder.
Solvent: Clear and colourless solution.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.
Posology
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition.
The number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the 
WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for 
factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma.
74
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor 
VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is 
determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) for at least 1 day, until the 
bleeding episode, as indicated by pain, 
is resolved or healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age
of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain 
and acute disability are resolved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for 
patients under the age of 6), at 
least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII 
activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual 
case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those 
calculated using the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to 
guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 
factor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor
VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
75
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses 
are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
Paediatric population
For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult 
patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 
times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.
Method of administration
ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health 
care professional appropriate training is needed.
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH 
of 6.7 to 7.3.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or 
hamster proteins.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. 
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, 
patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
Due to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for 
injections, if hypersensitivity reactions occur there is less time to react by stopping the injection. 
Therefore, caution is advised during injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for 
injections, especially in children.
Inhibitors
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
76
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure 
days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.
Misapplication of ADVATE
For ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml sterilised water for injections, misapplication (intra-arterially or 
paravenously) may lead to mild, short term injection site reactions, such as bruising and erythema.
Catheter-related complications in treatment
If central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Excipient related considerations
Sodium
This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the 
medicinal product.
Paediatric population
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-
feeding only if clearly indicated.
77
4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE 
reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency 
were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).
Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions 
may be observed.
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.

Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418).
The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during 
continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis 
was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance 
rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays 
performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.
ADR explained in the section below.
Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe 
haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients
Description of selected adverse reactions
ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process
Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 
protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or 
transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who 
were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward 
trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients 
reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst 
repeated exposures to the study product.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, 
flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.
79
Paediatric population
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.
The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII 
glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass 
of 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand 
Factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts 
prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are 
increased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency.
Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a 
sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart 
review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective 
registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed 
ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved. 
In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an 
individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII 
per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen 
(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a 
specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of 
72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are 
comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency) in "Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor 
VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII" and "treatment and prophylaxis of
80
bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)". (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was 
conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.
A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters 
that were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 
month to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), 
adolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize 
PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of 
adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young 
children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma 
volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute 
toxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity.
A local tolerance study in rabbits showed that ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml of sterilised water for 
injections is well tolerated after intravenous administration. Slight transient reddening at the 
administration site was observed after intraarterial application and after paravenous administration. 
However, no correlating adverse histopathological changes could be observed indicating a transient 
nature of this finding.

1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ADVATE 500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE 
contains approximately 250 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after 
reconstitution.
The potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic 
assay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4 520-11 300 IU/mg protein.
Octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids.
It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared 
without the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, 
purification or final formulation.
Excipients with known effect
This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

PHARMACEUTICAL FORM
Powder and solvent for solution for injection.
Powder: White to off-white friable powder.
Solvent: Clear and colourless solution.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.
Posology
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition.
The number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the 
WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for 
factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma.
86
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor 
VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is 
determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

(pre- and postoperative)
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) for at least 1 day, until the 
bleeding episode, as indicated by pain, 
is resolved or healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain 
and acute disability are resolved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for 
patients under the age of 6), at 
least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII 
activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual 
case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those 
calculated using the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to 
guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 
factor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor 
VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
87
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses 
are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
Paediatric population
For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult 
patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 
times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.
Method of administration
ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health 
care professional appropriate training is needed.
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH 
of 6.7 to 7.3.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or 
hamster proteins.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. 
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, 
patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
Due to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for 
injections, if hypersensitivity reactions occur there is less time to react by stopping the injection. 
Therefore, caution is advised during injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for 
injections, especially in children.
Inhibitors
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
88
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure 
days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.
Misapplication of ADVATE
For ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml sterilised water for injections, misapplication (intra-arterially or 
paravenously) may lead to mild, short term injection site reactions, such as bruising and erythema.
Catheter-related complications in treatment
If central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Excipient related considerations
Sodium
This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the 
medicinal product.
Paediatric population
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-
feeding only if clearly indicated.

4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE 
reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency 
were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).
Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions 
may be observed.
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.

Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418).
The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during 
continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis 
was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance 
rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays 
performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.
ADR explained in the section below.
Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe 
haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients
Description of selected adverse reactions
ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process
Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 
protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or 
transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who 
were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward 
trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients 
reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst 
repeated exposures to the study product.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, 
flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.
91
Paediatric population
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.
The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII 
glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass 
of 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand 
Factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts 
prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are 
increased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency.
Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within 
a sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart 
review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective 
registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed 
ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.
In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an 
individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII 
per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen 
(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a 
specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of 
72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are 
comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency) in "Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor 
VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII" and "treatment and prophylaxis of
92
bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)". (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was 
conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.
A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters 
that were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 
month to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), 
adolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize 
PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of 
adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young 
children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma 
volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute 
toxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity.
A local tolerance study in rabbits showed that ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml of sterilised water for 
injections is well tolerated after intravenous administration. Slight transient reddening at the 
administration site was observed after intraarterial application and after paravenous administration. 
However, no correlating adverse histopathological changes could be observed indicating a transient 
nature of this finding.

1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ADVATE 1000 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 1000 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE 
contains approximately 500 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after 
reconstitution.
The potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic 
assay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4 520-11 300 IU/mg protein.
Octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. 
It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared 
without the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, 
purification or final formulation.
Excipients with known effect
This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.
For the full list of excipients, see section 6.1.

Powder: White to off-white friable powder.
Solvent: Clear and colourless solution.
4.
CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.
Posology
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition.
The number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the 
WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for 
factor VIII in plasma).
98
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma.
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor 
VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is 
determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

(pre- and postoperative)
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) for at least 1 day, until the 
bleeding episode, as indicated by pain, 
is resolved or healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain 
and acute disability are resolved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for 
patients under the age of 6), at 
least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII 
activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual 
case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those 
calculated using the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to 
guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 
factor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor 
VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
99
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses 
are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
Paediatric population
For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult 
patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 
times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.
Method of administration
ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health 
care professional appropriate training is needed.
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH 
of 6.7 to 7.3.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or 
hamster proteins.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. 
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, 
patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
Due to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for 
injections, if hypersensitivity reactions occur there is less time to react by stopping the injection. 
Therefore, caution is advised during injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for 
injections, especially in children.
Inhibitors
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
100
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure 
days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.
Misapplication of ADVATE
For ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml sterilised water for injections, misapplication (intra-arterially or 
paravenously) may lead to mild, short term injection site reactions, such as bruising and erythema.
Catheter-related complications in treatment
If central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Excipient related considerations
Sodium
This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the 
medicinal product.
Paediatric population
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-
feeding only if clearly indicated.

4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE 
reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency 
were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).
Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions 
may be observed.
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.

Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418).
The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during 
continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis 
was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance 
rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays 
performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.
ADR explained in the section below.
Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe 
haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients
Description of selected adverse reactions
ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process
Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 
protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or 
transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who 
were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward 
trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients 
reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst 
repeated exposures to the study product.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, 
flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.
103
Paediatric population
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.
The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII 
glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass 
of 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand 
Factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts 
prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are 
increased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency.
Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a 
sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart 
review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective 
registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed 
ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.
In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an 
individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII 
per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen 
(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a 
specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of 
72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are 
comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency) in "Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor 
VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII" and "treatment and prophylaxis of 
104
bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)". (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was 
conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.
A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters 
that were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 
month to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), 
adolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize 
PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of 
adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young 
children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma 
volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute 
toxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity.
A local tolerance study in rabbits showed that ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml of sterilised water for 
injections is well tolerated after intravenous administration. Slight transient reddening at the 
administration site was observed after intraarterial application and after paravenous administration. 
However, no correlating adverse histopathological changes could be observed indicating a transient 
nature of this finding.

1.
NAME OF THE MEDICINAL PRODUCT
ADVATE 1500 IU powder and solvent for solution for injection.
2.
QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE COMPOSITION
Each vial contains nominally 1500 IU human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa. ADVATE 
contains approximately 750 IU per ml of human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA), octocog alfa after 
reconstitution.
The potency (International Units) is determined using the European Pharmacopoeia chromogenic 
assay. The specific activity of ADVATE is approximately 4 520-11 300 IU/mg protein.
Octocog alfa (human coagulation factor VIII (rDNA)) is a purified protein that has 2332 amino acids. 
It is produced by recombinant DNA technology in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. Prepared 
without the addition of any (exogenous) human- or animal-derived protein in the cell culture process, 
purification or final formulation.
Excipients with known effect
This medicinal product contains 0.45 mmol sodium (10 mg) per vial.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS
4.1 Therapeutic indications
Treatment and prophylaxis of bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency). ADVATE is indicated in all age groups.
4.2
Posology and method of administration
Treatment should be initiated under the supervision of a physician experienced in the treatment of 
haemophilia and with resuscitation support immediately available in case of anaphylaxis.
Posology
The dose and duration of the substitution therapy depend on the severity of the factor VIII deficiency, 
on the location and extent of the bleeding and on the patient’s clinical condition.
The number of units of factor VIII is expressed in International Units (IU), which are related to the 
WHO standard for factor VIII products. Factor VIII activity in plasma is expressed either as a 
percentage (relative to normal human plasma) or in IUs (relative to the international standard for 
factor VIII in plasma).
One International Unit (IU) of factor VIII activity is equivalent to that quantity of factor VIII in one ml 
of normal human plasma.
110
On demand treatment
The calculation of the required dose of factor VIII is based on the empirical finding that 1 IU factor 
VIII per kg body weight raises the plasma factor VIII activity by 2 IU/dl. The required dose is 
determined using the following formula:
Required units (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired factor VIII rise (%) x 0.5
In case of the following haemorrhagic events, the factor VIII activity should not fall below the given 
plasma activity level (in % of normal or IU/dl) in the corresponding period. The following table 1 can 
be used to guide dosing in bleeding episodes and surgery:

(pre- and postoperative)
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) for at least 1 day, until the 
bleeding episode, as indicated by pain, 
is resolved or healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 12 to 24 hours 
(8 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) for 3 – 4 days or more until pain 
and acute disability are resolved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 12 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until threat is resolved.
Every 24 hours (12 to 24 hours for 
patients under the age of 6), at 
least 1 day, until healing is achieved.
Repeat injections every 8 to 24 hours 
(6 to 24 hours for patients under the age 
of 6) until adequate wound healing, then 
continue therapy for at least 
another 7 days to maintain a factor VIII 
activity of 30% to 60% (IU/dl).
The dose and frequency of administration should be adapted to the clinical response in the individual 
case. Under certain circumstances (e.g. presence of a low-titre inhibitor), doses larger than those 
calculated using the formula may be necessary.
During the course of treatment, appropriate determination of plasma factor VIII levels is advised to 
guide the dose to be administered and the frequency of repeated injections. In the case of major 
surgical interventions in particular, precise monitoring of the substitution therapy by means of plasma 
factor VIII activity assay is indispensable. Individual patients may vary in their response to factor 
VIII, achieving different levels of in vivo recovery and demonstrating different half-lives.
111
Prophylaxis
For long-term prophylaxis against bleeding in patients with severe haemophilia A, the usual doses 
are 20 to 40 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight at intervals of 2 to 3 days.
Paediatric population
For on demand treatment dosing in paediatric patients (0 to 18 years of age) does not differ from adult 
patients. In patients under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU of factor VIII per kg body weight 3 to 4 
times weekly are recommended for prophylactic therapy.
Method of administration
ADVATE should be administered via the intravenous route. In case of administration by a non health 
care professional appropriate training is needed.
The rate of administration should be determined to ensure the comfort of the patient up to a maximum 
of 10 ml/min.
After reconstitution, the solution is clear, colourless, free from foreign particles and has a pH 
of 6.7 to 7.3.
For instructions on reconstitution of the medicinal product before administration, see section 6.6.
4.3 Contraindications
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1 or to mouse or 
hamster proteins.
4.4
Special warnings and precautions for use
Traceability
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type hypersensitivity reactions, including anaphylaxis, have been reported with ADVATE. 
The product contains traces of mouse and hamster proteins. If symptoms of hypersensitivity occur, 
patients should be advised to discontinue use of the product immediately and contact their physician. 
Patients should be informed of the early signs of hypersensitivity reactions including hives, 
generalised urticaria, tightness of the chest, wheezing, hypotension and anaphylaxis.
In case of shock, standard medical treatment for shock should be implemented.
Due to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for 
injections, if hypersensitivity reactions occur there is less time to react by stopping the injection. 
Therefore, caution is advised during injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml sterilised water for 
injections, especially in children.
Inhibitors
The formation of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII is a known complication in the 
management of individuals with haemophilia A. These inhibitors are usually IgG immunoglobulins 
directed against the factor VIII procoagulant activity, which are quantified in Bethesda Units (BU) per 
ml of plasma using the modified assay. The risk of developing inhibitors is correlated to the severity of 
112
the disease as well as the exposure to factor VIII, this risk being highest within the first 20 exposure 
days. Rarely, inhibitors may develop after the first 100 exposure days.
Cases of recurrent inhibitor (low titre) have been observed after switching from one factor VIII 
product to another in previously treated patients with more than 100 exposure days who have a 
previous history of inhibitor development. Therefore, it is recommended to monitor all patients 
carefully for inhibitor occurrence following any product switch.
The clinical relevance of inhibitor development will depend on the titre of the inhibitor, with low titre 
inhibitors which are transiently present or remain consistently low titre posing less of a risk of 
insufficient clinical response than high titre inhibitors.
In general, all patients treated with coagulation factor VIII products should be carefully monitored for 
the development of inhibitors by appropriate clinical observations and laboratory tests. If the expected 
factor VIII activity plasma levels are not attained, or if bleeding is not controlled with an appropriate 
dose, testing for factor VIII inhibitor presence should be performed. In patients with high levels of 
inhibitor, factor VIII therapy may not be effective and other therapeutic options should be considered. 
Management of such patients should be directed by physicians with experience in the care of 
haemophilia and factor VIII inhibitors.
Misapplication of ADVATE
For ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml sterilised water for injections, misapplication (intra-arterially or 
paravenously) may lead to mild, short term injection site reactions, such as bruising and erythema.
Catheter-related complications in treatment
If central venous access device (CVAD) is required, risk of CVAD-related complications including 
local infections, bacteremia and catheter site thrombosis should be considered.
Excipient related considerations
Sodium
This medicinal product contains 10 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.5 % of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.
It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered to a patient, the name and batch 
number of the product are recorded in order to maintain a link between the patient and the batch of the 
medicinal product.
Paediatric population
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children.
4.5
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction
No interaction studies have been performed with ADVATE.
4.6
Fertility, pregnancy and lactation
Animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with factor VIII. Based on the rare occurrence 
of haemophilia A in women, experience regarding the use of factor VIII during pregnancy and 
breast-feeding is not available. Therefore, factor VIII should be used during pregnancy and breast-
feeding only if clearly indicated.

4.7 Effects on ability to drive and use machines
ADVATE has no influence on the ability to drive and use machines.
4.8 Undesirable effects
Summary of the safety profile
Clinical studies with ADVATE included 418 subjects with at least one exposure to ADVATE 
reporting in total 93 adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The ADRs that occurred in the highest frequency 
were development of neutralising antibodies to factor VIII (inhibitors), headache and fever.
Hypersensitivity or allergic reactions (which may include angioedema, burning and stinging at the 
infusion site, chills, flushing, generalised urticaria, headache, hives, hypotension, lethargy, nausea, 
restlessness, tachycardia, tightness of the chest, tingling, vomiting, wheezing) have been observed 
rarely and may in some cases progress to severe anaphylaxis (including shock).
Development of antibodies to mouse and/or hamster protein with related hypersensitivity reactions 
may be observed.
Development of neutralising antibodies (inhibitors) may occur in patients with haemophilia A treated 
with factor VIII, including with ADVATE. If such inhibitors occur, the condition will manifest itself 
as an insufficient clinical response. In such cases, it is recommended that a specialised haemophilia 
centre be contacted.
Tabulated summary of adverse reactions
The following table 2 provides the frequency of adverse drug reactions in clinical trials and from 
spontaneous reporting. The table is according to the MedDRA system organ classification (SOC and 
Preferred Term Level).

Calculated based on total number of patients who received ADVATE (418).
The unexpected decrease in coagulation factor VIII levels occurred in one patient during 
continuous infusion of ADVATE following surgery (postoperative days 10-14). Haemostasis 
was maintained at all times during this period and both plasma factor VIII levels and clearance 
rates returned to appropriate levels by postoperative day 15. Factor VIII inhibitor assays 
performed after completion of continuous infusion and at study termination were negative.
ADR explained in the section below.
Frequency is based on studies with all FVIII products which included patients with severe 
haemophilia A. PTPs = previously-treated patients, PUPs = previously-untreated patients
Description of selected adverse reactions
ADRs specific to residues from the manufacturing process
Of the 229 treated patients who were assessed for antibodies to Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cell 
protein, 3 showed a statistically significant upward trend in titres, 4 displayed sustained peaks or 
transient spikes and one patient had both but no clinical symptoms. Of the 229 treated patients who 
were assessed for antibodies to murine IgG, 10 showed a statistically significant upward 
trend, 2 displayed a sustained peak or transient spike and one patient had both. Four of these patients 
reported isolated events of urticaria, pruritus, rash, and slightly elevated eosinophil counts amongst 
repeated exposures to the study product.
Hypersensitivity
Allergic type reactions include anaphylaxis and have been manifested by dizziness, paresthesias, rash, 
flushing, face swelling, urticaria, and pruritus.
115
Paediatric population
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in ADRs were noted in the clinical studies.
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V.
4.9 Overdose
No symptoms of overdose with recombinant coagulation factor VIII have been reported.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES
5.1
Pharmacodynamic properties
Pharmacotherapeutic group: antihaemorrhagics, blood coagulation factor VIII. ATC code: B02BD02.
The factor VIII/von Willebrand Factor complex consists of two molecules (factor VIII and von 
Willebrand Factor) with different physiological functions. ADVATE contains recombinant 
coagulation factor VIII (octocog alfa), a glycoprotein that is biologically equivalent to the factor VIII 
glycoprotein found in human plasma.
Octocog alfa is a glycoprotein consisting of 2332 amino acids with an approximate molecular mass 
of 280 kD. When infused into a haemophilia patient, octocog alfa binds to endogenous von Willebrand 
Factor in the patient’s circulation. Activated factor VIII acts as a Cofactor for activated Factor IX, 
accelerating the conversion of Factor X to activated Factor X. Activated Factor X converts 
prothrombin to thrombin. Thrombin then converts fibrinogen into fibrin and a clot can be formed. 
Haemophilia A is a sex-linked hereditary disorder of blood coagulation due to decreased levels of 
factor VIII activity and results in profuse bleeding into joints, muscles or internal organs, either 
spontaneously or as a result of accidental or surgical trauma. The plasma levels of factor VIII are 
increased by replacement therapy, thereby enabling a temporary correction of the factor VIII 
deficiency and correction of the bleeding tendency.
Data on Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with inhibitors have been collected. Within a 
sub-study of PUP-study 060103, ITI-treatments in 11 PUPs were documented. Retrospective chart 
review was done for 30 paediatric subjects on ITI (in study 060703). A non-interventional prospective 
registry (PASS-INT-004) documented ITI in 44 paediatric and adult subjects of whom 36 completed 
ITI therapy. Data show that immune tolerance may be achieved.
In study 060201 two long-term prophylaxis treatment schemes have been compared in 53 PTPs: an 
individualized pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (within a range of 20 to 80 IU of factor VIII 
per kg body weight at intervals of 72 ± 6 hours, n=23) with a standard prophylactic dosing regimen 
(20 to 40 IU/kg every 48 ±6 hours, n=30). The pharmacokinetic guided dosing regimen (according to a 
specific formula) was targeted to maintain factor VIII trough levels ≥ 1% at the inter-dosing interval of 
72 hours. The data from this study demonstrate that the two prophylactic dosing regimens are 
comparable in terms of reduction of bleeding rate.
The European Medicines Agency has waived the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
ADVATE in all subsets of the paediatric population in haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII 
deficiency) in "Immune Tolerance Induction (ITI) in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor 
VIII deficiency) who have developed inhibitors to factor VIII" and "treatment and prophylaxis of 
116
bleeding in patients with haemophilia A (congenital factor VIII deficiency)". (see section 4.2 for 
information on paediatric use).
5.2
Pharmacokinetic properties
All pharmacokinetic studies with ADVATE were conducted in previously treated patients with severe 
to moderately severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII ≤ 2%). The analysis of plasma samples was 
conducted in a central laboratory using a one-stage clotting assay.
A total of 195 subjects with severe haemophilia A (baseline factor VIII < 1%) provided PK parameters 
that were included in the Per-Protocol PK analysis set. Categories of these analyses for infants (1 
month to <2 years of age), children (2 to <5 years of age), older children (5 to <12 years of age), 
adolescents (12 to <18 years of age), and adults (18 years of age and older) were used to summarize 
PK parameters, where age was defined as age at time of PK infusion.

The safety and haemostatic efficacy of ADVATE in the paediatric population are similar to that of 
adult patients. Adjusted recovery and terminal half-life (t½) was approximately 20% lower in young 
children (less than 6 years of age) than in adults, which may be due in part to the known higher plasma 
volume per kilogram body weight in younger patients.
Pharmacokinetic data with ADVATE on previously untreated patients are currently not available.
5.3
Preclinical safety data
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on studies of safety pharmacology, acute 
toxicology, repeated dose toxicity, local toxicity and genotoxicity.
A local tolerance study in rabbits showed that ADVATE reconstituted with 2 ml of sterilised water for 
injections is well tolerated after intravenous administration. Slight transient reddening at the 
administration site was observed after intraarterial application and after paravenous administration. 
However, no correlating adverse histopathological changes could be observed indicating a transient 
nature of this finding.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for
ADVATE contains the active substance octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII produced by 
recombinant DNA technology. Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. 
In patients with haemophilia A (inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly.
ADVATE is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with 
haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII).
ADVATE is prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived protein in the entire 
manufacturing process.
2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE
Do not use ADVATE
-
if you are allergic to octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins
-
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before using ADVATE. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously 
treated with Factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher 
248
risk that it happens again. Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy 
of ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding. Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the 
treatment of haemophilia A. If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor 
immediately.
There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ADVATE. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, hives, 
wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in 
the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These symptoms can constitute an early 
symptom of an anaphylactic shock, manifestations of which may additionally include extreme 
dizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty in breathing.
If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe 
symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.
Patients developing Factor VIII inhibitors
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child’s bleeding is not being controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.
Children and adolescents
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children (from 0 to 18 years of age).
Other medicines and ADVATE
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.
Driving and using machines
ADVATE has no influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.
ADVATE contains sodium
This medicine contains 10 mg sodium (main component of cooking salt) per vial. This is equivalent to 
0.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.
3.
How to use ADVATE
Treatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia A.
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your 
condition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The 
frequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the 
replacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment.
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure.
249
Prevention of bleeding
The usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. 
However, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may 
be necessary.
Treatment of bleeding
The dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.
Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor.
Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate Factor VIII 
levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery.
Use in children and adolescents (from 0 to 18 years of age)
For the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the 
prevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to 
4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does 
not differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become 
necessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products.
How ADVATE is given
ADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else 
might also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed 
instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet.
If you use more ADVATE than you should
Always take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you 
are not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible.
If you forget to use ADVATE
Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as 
scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor.
If you stop using ADVATE
Do not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.
4.
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped 
immediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early 
symptoms of allergic reactions:
-
-
-
rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching,
swelling of lips and tongue,
difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest,
250
-
-
general feeling of being unwell,
dizziness and loss of consciousness.
Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency 
treatment.
For children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) 
may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 people); however patients who have received previous 
treatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 
people). If this happens your or your child’s medicines may stop working properly and you or your 
child may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately.
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)
Factor VIII inhibitors (for children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines). 
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)

general disorders (tiredness, lack of energy).
Additional side effects in children
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in side effects were noted in the clinical 
studies.
Reporting of side effects
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this 
leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for
ADVATE contains the active substance octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII produced by 
recombinant DNA technology. Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. 
In patients with haemophilia A (inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly.
ADVATE is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with 
haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII).
ADVATE is prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived protein in the entire 
manufacturing process.
2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE
Do not use ADVATE
-
if you are allergic to octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins
-
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before using ADVATE. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously 
treated with Factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher 
257
risk that it happens again. Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy 
of ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding. Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the 
treatment of haemophilia A. If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor 
immediately.
There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ADVATE. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, hives, 
wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in 
the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These symptoms can constitute an early 
symptom of an anaphylactic shock, manifestations of which may additionally include extreme 
dizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty in breathing.
If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe 
symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.
Patients developing Factor VIII inhibitors
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child’s bleeding is not being controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.
Children and adolescents
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children (from 0 to 18 years of age).
Other medicines and ADVATE
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.
Driving and using machines
ADVATE has no influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.
ADVATE contains sodium
This medicine contains 10 mg sodium (main component of cooking salt) per vial. This is equivalent to 
0.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.
3.
How to use ADVATE
Treatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia A.
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your 
condition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The 
frequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the 
replacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment.
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure.
258
Prevention of bleeding
The usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. 
However, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may 
be necessary.
Treatment of bleeding
The dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.
Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor.
Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate Factor VIII 
levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery.
Use in children and adolescents (from 0 to 18 years of age)
For the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the 
prevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to 
4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does 
not differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become 
necessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products.
How ADVATE is given
ADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else 
might also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed 
instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet.
If you use more ADVATE than you should
Always take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you 
are not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible.
If you forget to use ADVATE
Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as 
scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor.
If you stop using ADVATE
Do not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.
4.
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.
If severe, sudden allergic reactions (anaphylactic) occur, the injection must be stopped 
immediately. You must contact your doctor immediately if you have any of the following early 
symptoms of allergic reactions:
-
-
-
rash, hives, wheals, generalised itching,
swelling of lips and tongue,
difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in the chest,
259
-
-
general feeling of being unwell,
dizziness and loss of consciousness.
Severe symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (nearly) fainting, require prompt emergency 
treatment. 
For children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines, inhibitor antibodies (see section 2) 
may form very commonly (more than 1 in 10 people); however patients who have received previous 
treatment with Factor VIII (more than 150 days of treatment) the risk is uncommon (less than 1 in 100 
people). If this happens your or your child’s medicines may stop working properly and you or your 
child may experience persistent bleeding. If this happens, you should contact your doctor immediately.
Very common side effects (may affect more than 1 in 10 people)
Factor VIII inhibitors (for children not previously treated with Factor VIII medicines). 
Common side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)
headache and fever.

150 days of treatment)), dizziness, flu, fainting, abnormal heartbeat, red itchy bumps on the skin, chest 
discomfort, injection site bruise, injection site reaction, itching, increased sweating, unusual taste in 
the mouth, hot flushes, migraines, memory impairment, chills, diarrhoea, nausea, vomiting, shortness 
of breath, sore throat, infection of the lymphatic vessels, whitening of skin, eye inflammation, rashes, 
excessive sweating, foot and leg swelling, reduced percentage of red blood cells, increase in a type of 
white blood cells (monocytes), and pain in the upper abdomen or lower chest.
Related to surgery
catheter-related infection, decreased red cell blood count, swelling of limbs and joints, prolonged 
bleeding after drain removal, decreased Factor VIII level and post-operative bruise.
Related to central venous access devices (CVAD)
catheter-related infection, systemic infection and local blood clot at the catheter site.
Side effects with unknown frequency (frequency cannot be estimated from the available data)
potentially life-threatening reactions (anaphylaxis) and other allergic reactions (hypersensitivity), 
general disorders (tiredness, lack of energy).
Additional side effects in children
Other than the development of inhibitors in previously untreated paediatric patients (PUPs), and 
catheter-related complications, no age-specific differences in side effects were noted in the clinical 
studies.
Reporting of side effects
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor. This includes any possible side effects not listed in this 
leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system listed in Appendix V.

Contents of the pack and other information
1. What ADVATE is and what it is used for
ADVATE contains the active substance octocog alfa, human coagulation factor VIII produced by 
recombinant DNA technology. Factor VIII is necessary for the blood to form clots and stop bleedings. 
In patients with haemophilia A (inborn lack of factor VIII), it is missing or not working properly.
ADVATE is used for the treatment and prevention of bleeding in patients of all age groups with 
haemophilia A (an inherited bleeding disorder caused by lack of factor VIII).
ADVATE is prepared without the addition of any human- or animal-derived protein in the entire 
manufacturing process.
2. What you need to know before you use ADVATE
Do not use ADVATE
-
if you are allergic to octocog alfa or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6)
if you are allergic to mouse or hamster proteins
-
If you are unsure about this, ask your doctor.
Warnings and precautions
Talk to your doctor before using ADVATE. You should tell your doctor if you have been previously 
treated with Factor VIII products, especially if you developed inhibitors, since there might be a higher 
risk that it happens again. Inhibitors are blocking antibodies against factor VIII that reduce the efficacy 
of ADVATE to prevent or control bleeding. Development of inhibitors is a known complication in the 
266
treatment of haemophilia A. If your bleeding is not controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor 
immediately.
There is a rare risk that you may experience an anaphylactic reaction (a severe, sudden allergic 
reaction) to ADVATE. You should be aware of the early signs of allergic reactions such as rash, hives, 
wheals, generalised itching, swelling of lips and tongue, difficulty in breathing, wheezing, tightness in 
the chest, general feeling of being unwell, and dizziness. These symptoms can constitute an early 
symptom of an anaphylactic shock, manifestations of which may additionally include extreme 
dizziness, loss of consciousness, and extreme difficulty in breathing.
If any of these symptoms occur, stop the injection immediately and contact your doctor. Severe 
symptoms, including difficulty in breathing and (near) fainting, require prompt emergency treatment.
Patients developing Factor VIII inhibitors
The formation of inhibitors (antibodies) is a known complication that can occur during treatment with 
all Factor VIII medicines. These inhibitors, especially at high levels, stop the treatment working 
properly and you or your child will be monitored carefully for the development of these inhibitors. If 
you or your child’s bleeding is not being controlled with ADVATE, tell your doctor immediately.
Children and adolescents
The listed warnings and precautions apply to both adults and children (from 0 to 18 years of age).
Other medicines and ADVATE
Tell your doctor if you are using, have recently used or might use any other medicines.
Pregnancy and breast-feeding
If you are pregnant or breast-feeding, think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby, ask 
your doctor for advice before using this medicine.
Driving and using machines
ADVATE has no influence on your ability to drive or to use machines.
ADVATE contains sodium
This medicine contains 10 mg sodium (main component of cooking salt) per vial. This is equivalent to 
0.5 % of the recommended maximum daily dietary intake of sodium for an adult.
Misapplication of ADVATE
Misapplication (injection into the artery or outside the vein) should be avoided as mild, short term 
injection site reactions, such as bruising and redness, may occur.
3.
How to use ADVATE
Treatment with ADVATE will be started by a doctor who is experienced in the care of patients with 
haemophilia A.
Your doctor will calculate your dose of ADVATE (in international units or IU) depending on your 
condition and body weight, and on whether it is used for prevention or treatment of bleeding. The 
frequency of administration will depend on how well ADVATE is working for you. Usually, the 
replacement therapy with ADVATE is a life-long treatment.
267
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor if you are not 
sure.
Prevention of bleeding
The usual dose of octocog alfa is 20 to 40 IU per kg body weight, administered every 2 to 3 days. 
However, in some cases, especially in younger patients, more frequent injections or higher doses may 
be necessary.
Treatment of bleeding
The dose of octocog alfa is calculated depending on your body weight and the factor VIII levels to be 
achieved. The target factor VIII levels will depend on the severity and location of the bleeding.
Dose (IU) = body weight (kg) x desired Factor VIII rise (% of normal) x 0.5
If you have the impression that the effect of ADVATE is insufficient, talk to your doctor.
Your doctor will perform appropriate laboratory tests to make sure that you have adequate Factor VIII 
levels. This is particularly important if you are having major surgery.
Use in children and adolescents (from 0 to 18 years of age)
For the treatment of bleeding the dosing in children does not differ from adult patients. For the 
prevention of bleeding in children under the age of 6, doses of 20 to 50 IU per kg body weight 3 to 
4 times weekly are recommended. The administration of ADVATE in children (intravenously) does 
not differ from the administration in adults. A central venous access device (CVAD) may become 
necessary to allow frequent infusions of factor VIII products. 
Due to the decrease in injection volume for ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml, the time to react to 
hypersensitivity reactions during an injection is further reduced. Therefore, caution is advised during 
injection of ADVATE reconstituted in 2 ml, especially in children.
How ADVATE is given
ADVATE is usually injected into a vein (intravenously) by your doctor or nurse. You or someone else 
might also administer ADVATE as an injection, but only after receiving adequate training. Detailed 
instructions for self-administration are given at the end of this package leaflet.
If you use more ADVATE than you should
Always take ADVATE exactly as your doctor has told you. You should check with your doctor if you 
are not sure. If you inject more ADVATE than recommended, tell your doctor as soon as possible.
If you forget to use ADVATE
Do not inject a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. Proceed with the next injection as 
scheduled and continue as advised by your doctor.
If you stop using ADVATE
Do not stop using ADVATE without consulting your doctor.
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor.
4.
Possible side effects
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them.

Instructions for preparation and administration
ADVATE must not be mixed with other medicinal products or solvents.
It is strongly recommended that every time ADVATE is administered, the name and batch number of 
the product are recorded.
Instructions for reconstitution



1.
Do not use after the expiry date stated on the labels and carton.
Do not use if the lid is not completely sealed on the blister
Do not refrigerate the solution after preparation.
If the product is still stored in a refrigerator, take the sealed blister (contains powder and solvent 
vials preassembled with the system for reconstitution) from the refrigerator and let it reach room 
temperature (between 15 °C and 25 °C).
2. Wash your hands thoroughly using soap and warm water.
3.
Open the ADVATE package by peeling away the lid. Remove the BAXJECT III system from 
the blister.
Place the ADVATE on a flat surface with the solvent vial on top (Fig. 1). The solvent vial has a 
blue stripe. Do not remove the blue cap until instructed in a later step.
4.
282
5. With one hand holding the ADVATE in the BAXJECT III system, press down firmly on the 
6.
solvent vial with the other hand until the system is fully collapsed and the solvent flows down 
into the ADVATE vial (Fig. 2). Do not tilt the system until the transfer is complete.
Verify that the solvent transfer is complete. Swirl gently until all material is dissolved. Be sure 
that the ADVATE powder is completely dissolved, otherwise not all reconstituted solution will 
pass through the device filter. The product dissolves rapidly (usually in less than 1 minute). 
After reconstitution the solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles.

Fig. 2
Fig. 3
Instructions for injection
Aseptic technique is required during administration.
For administration the use of a luer-lock syringe is required.
Important note:

Do not try to administer the injection unless you have received special training from your doctor 
or nurse.
Inspect the prepared solution for particulate matter and discoloration prior to administration (the 
solution should be clear, colourless and free from foreign particles).
Do not use ADVATE if the solution is not fully clear or not completely dissolved.
Remove the blue cap from BAXJECT III. Do not draw air into the syringe. Connect the 
syringe to BAXJECT III.
Invert the system (the vial with the reconstituted solution has to be on top). Draw the 
reconstituted solution into the syringe by pulling the plunger back slowly.
Disconnect the syringe.
Attach a butterfly needle to the syringe and inject the reconstituted solution into a vein. The 
solution should be administered slowly, at a rate as determined by the patient’s comfort level, 
not to exceed 10 ml per minute. (See Section 4 “Possible side effects”).
Discard any unused solution appropriately.

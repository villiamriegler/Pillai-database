2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
22 May 2014 
Prevenar 13 is a 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (13vPnC), containing 13 pneumococcal 
capsular polysaccharides (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F), conjugated to 
cross-reactive material 197 (CRM197) carrier protein. 
2 
 
 
Prevenar 13 was first approved in the European Union (EU), on 09 December 2009 for active 
immunisation for the prevention of invasive disease, pneumonia, and acute otitis media caused by 
Streptococcus pneumoniae in infants and children from 6 weeks to 5 years of age. Since that time the 
indication has been extended to include adults aged 50 years and older, children and adolescents aged 6 
to 17 years, and adults aged 18 to 49 years.  
In December 2012, the MAH submitted a Type II variation (EMEA/H/C/1104/II/76) to add information to 
the SmPC from 3 clinical studies on the use of 13vPnC in populations with specific conditions associated 
with increased risk of pneumococcal disease. These included study 6096A1-3014 in children and 
adolescents with sickle cell disease (SCD, primary analysis submitted) and study 6115A1-3017 in adults 
with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (final analysis submitted), each study in subjects who 
previously had received 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS). The variation also 
included results from study 6096A1-4001 in infants born prematurely (primary analysis submitted). The 
CHMP adopted a positive Opinion on this procedure on 19 September 2013. 
The final results from 2 additional studies in high-risk populations (6115A1-3002 and 6115A1-3003), and 
the 6-month follow-up safety and 1-year antibody persistence and safety data from study 6096A1-3014 
(i.e., no study vaccine administered at 1 year) are now available. The variation currently being submitted 
includes final study reports for these 3 studies:  
•  6115A1-3002 (B1851021): HIV-infected individuals aged ≥ 6 years, not previously immunized 
with a pneumococcal vaccine; final study report. 
•  6115A1-3003 (B1851022): recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) 
aged ≥ 2 years, who have not received a pneumococcal vaccine since HSCT; final study report. 
•  6096A1-3014 (B1851013): children and adolescents aged ≥ 6 to <18 years with SCD, previously 
immunized with 23vPS; 6-month safety addendum and 1-year final study report). 
These studies are submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Pediatric Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006. 
Additionally, study 6115A1-3002 is a post-authorisation commitment to the European Union Marketing 
Authorisation (MEA 013). 
2.2.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
The three study reports will be described and assessed together in the following sections. 
2.2.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study 6115A1-3002 (B1851021) in HIV-Infected Subjects 
Study Design:  
This was a Phase 3, open-label, single arm, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity of 1, 2 and 3 doses of 13vPnC in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected subjects 
aged 6 years and older who had not been previously immunized with pneumococcal vaccine. The study 
was conducted in South Africa and Romania. 
Approximately 300 subjects (150 pediatric subjects aged 6 to <18 years and 150 adults aged ≥ 18 years) 
were to participate in this study at approximately 30 sites. Subjects received 3 doses of 13vPnC followed 
by 1 dose of 23vPS, with each dose administered at monthly intervals. 
3 
 
The CHMP noted that the current study included subjects who had not been previously vaccinated with 
23vPS in contrast to the previously assessed study 6115A1-3017 (see variation II/76) in HIV infected 
subjects.  
Objectives 
Primary Objective: 
• 
To evaluate the immune responses 1 month after 3 doses of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (13vPnC) compared with the immune responses 1 month after 2 doses of 13vPnC as 
measured by serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) in 
subjects ≥ 6 years of age. 
Primary Safety Objective: 
• 
To evaluate the acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC as measured by the incidence rates 
of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs). 
Secondary Objectives: 
• 
• 
• 
To evaluate the immune responses 1 month after 3 doses of 13vPnC compared with the immune 
responses 1 month after 2 doses of 13vPnC as measured by serotype-specific IgG geometric 
mean concentrations (GMCs) in subjects ≥ 6 years of age. 
To evaluate the immune responses 1 month after 3 doses of 13vPnC compared with the immune 
responses 1 month after 2 doses of 13vPnC as measured by serotype-specific opsonophagocytic 
activity (OPA) geometric mean titers (GMTs) and fold rise OPA GMTs in subjects ≥ 6 years of age. 
To evaluate the immune responses 1 month after 3 doses of 13vPnC compared with the immune 
responses 1 month after 2 doses of 13vPnC as measured by serotype-specific IgG GMCs, IgG 
GMFRs, OPA GMTs, and OPA GMFRs in the pediatric subgroup (6 to <18 years of age), and in the 
adult subgroup (≥ 18 years of age). 
Exploratory Objectives: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the immune responses 1 month after dose 1 of 13vPnC, as measured by 
serotype-specific IgG GMCs, IgG GMFRs, OPA GMTs, and OPA GMFRs in subjects ≥ 6 years of age, 
in the pediatric subgroup (6 to <18 years of age), and in the adult subgroup (≥ 18 years of age). 
To evaluate the immune responses to the 12 common serotypes and 6A, 1 month after 23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS), as measured by serotypespecific IgG GMCs, IgG 
GMFRs, OPA GMTs, and OPA GMFRs in subjects ≥ 6 years of age, in the pediatric subgroup (6 to 
<18 years of age), and in the adult subgroup (≥ 18 years of age). 
Main Criteria for Inclusion:  
Subjects eligible for the study were HIV-infected male or female subjects aged 6 years or older with a viral 
load of <50,000 copies/mL and CD4+ T-cell count ≥ 200 cells/μL within 6 months before the 
investigational product administration. Subjects received stable dose of highly active antiretroviral 
therapy (HAART) for at least 6 weeks prior to the investigational product administration, or were not 
receiving antiretroviral therapy. Subjects were naive to any licensed or experimental pneumococcal 
vaccine. Subjects with preexisting stable disease (as specified in the protocol) were eligible. Subjects or 
subjects’ parents/legal guardians, as appropriate, had to be able to complete an electronic diary (e-diary) 
and complete all relevant study procedures during study participation, and were expected to be available 
for the duration of the trial (approximately 8 months). Subjects biologically capable of having children 
agreed to abstinence or committed to the use of a reliable method of birth control from the signing of the 
informed consent form (ICF) until 3 months after the last dose of investigational product. 
4 
 
Subjects were excluded if they had an active acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related 
illness, including opportunistic infections or malignancy, had a history of culture proven invasive disease 
caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae infection within the last year, or had any other disorder that in the 
investigator’s opinion precluded them from participating in the study, or had any of the other exclusion 
criteria specified in the protocol. 
Vaccines Administered: 
13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine:  Commercial formulation 
23-valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine:  commercial formulation. 23vPS is a commercially 
available pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine supplied as a 0.5-mL solution. Each 0.5-mL dose 
consisted of a mixture of purified capsular polysaccharides from 23 types of S pneumoniae: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 
6B, 7F, 8, 9N, 9V, 10A, 11A, 12F, 14, 15B, 17F, 18C, 19A, 19F, 20, 22F, 23F, and 33F, and was 
formulated to contain 25 μg of each of the 23 purified capsular pneumococcal polysaccharide serotypes.  
Each subject received 3 doses (0.5 mL each) of 13vPnC followed by 1 dose (0.5 mL) of 23vPS, with each 
dose given at approximately 1 month intervals. Each dose of vaccine was administered intramuscularly. 
Immunogenicity Evaluations:  
Blood samples for immunogenicity assessments were collected from all subjects immediately before and 
approximately 1 month (28 to 42 days) after each investigational product administration. 
Serum concentrations of anticapsular IgG were determined for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes 
contained in 13vPnC using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for each blood sample. IgG 
concentrations were determined for blood samples collected before and 1 month after vaccination. Serum 
OPA titers for the 13 pneumococcal serotypes were determined for all blood samples collected before and 
1 month after vaccination. 
Safety Evaluations:  
On Days 1 to 14 after each dose of 13vPnC, subjects reported reactogenicity (local reactions and systemic 
events) in e-diaries. Local reactions included pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site. Systemic 
events included fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, and use of 
antipyretic and pain medications for treatment of symptoms associated with 13vPnC administration. 
AEs were recorded in the AE case report form (CRF) from the signing of the ICF through to Visit 5 
(approximately 1 month after the last vaccination with 23vPS). Ongoing AEs were recorded. At Visit 6 
(Final Telephone Contact), the parent/legal guardian or subject was contacted by telephone to inquire 
about serious adverse events (SAEs) including hospitalizations, and newly diagnosed major illnesses or 
chronic medical conditions that occurred since Visit 5. SAEs were recorded in the AE CRF and reported to 
the sponsor on an SAE form from the signing of the ICF through to the end of the study at the Visit 6 
follow-up phone call. In addition, at Visit 6, any emergency room visits that met the criteria of an SAE that 
occurred since Visit 5 were recorded and reported. AEs were categorized according to the Medical 
Dictionary for Regulatory Activities. The relation between an AE and study vaccine was categorized as 
related or not related. AE severity was categorized as mild, moderate, severe, or life threatening. 
Statistical Methods 
No formal statistical comparisons were made in this open-label study. The number and percentage of 
subjects enrolled and included in each immunogenicity population were tabulated for each age group and 
the total sample.  
Immunogenicity:  
5 
 
Serotype-specific IgG concentrations and OPA titers were logarithmically transformed for analysis. For 
each of the 13 serotypes contained in 13vPnC, IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs were computed at each visit 
(before Vaccination 1 and 1 month after each vaccination); 2-sided, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) on 
the GMCs and GMTs were constructed at each visit by back transformation of the CIs for the mean of the 
logarithmically transformed assay results computed using the Student t distribution. The ratio of IgG 
concentrations 1 month after 3 doses of 13vPnC relative to that after 2 doses of 13vPnC was assessed for 
each subject based on logarithmically transformed assay results, and the IgG GMCs and corresponding 
2-sided 95% CIs were computed for comparison of 3 doses of 13vPnC relative to 2 doses of 13vPnC. 
Similarly, the ratio of OPA titers after 3 doses of 13vPnC relative to that after 2 doses of 13vPnC was 
computed for comparison of 3 doses of 13vPnC relative to 2 doses of 13vPnC with corresponding 95% CIs. 
The protocol and SAP did not pre specify an analysis to demonstrate a statistically significant immune 
response for the comparisons of IgG GMCs and GMFRs and OPA GMTs and GMFRs after vaccine doses. 
However, the criterion of a lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the GMFRs > 1 was used for a statistically 
significant increased immune response and the criterion of an upper limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the 
GMFRs < 1 was used for a statistically significant decreased immune response. Additionally, the ratios of 
IgG GMFRs and the ratios of OPA GMFRs were computed for comparison of 1 dose versus 2 doses as well 
as the comparison of 3 doses versus 2 doses.  
Reverse cumulative distribution curves for IgG concentrations and OPA titers are presented after 3 doses 
of 13vPnC and after 2 doses of 13vPnC for each of the 13 serotypes contained in 13vPnC. 
Serotype-specific kinetic curves were presented graphically for IgG concentrations and OPA titers 
assessed at each time point. 
The revised lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) thresholds on the microcolony OPA (mcOPA) assay was 
documented and additional analysis was performed on the OPA endpoints in other 13vPnC adult studies. 
Additional immunogenicity analyses were performed. However, to quantify functional antibodies in the 
OPA assays with appropriate precision and accuracy, the LLOQ was determined for each serotype-specific 
OPA assay during assay validation. In addition, alternative analyses were conducted where OPA titers 
below LLOQ were set to 0.5*LLOQ. 
Safety:  
The local reactions and systemic events, including fever and use of antipyretics and pain medications, 
were summarized by 2 types of tables and 1 plot for each vaccination, age group, and overall population 
separately. The AEs and SAEs were summarized by age group and overall population separately for each 
dose (Dose 1, 2, and 3). In addition, tables for related events, and events characterized as severe or life 
threatening were tabulated by age group and total sample for those events occurring during the study. 
The AEs collected from the signing of the ICF to first dose of 13vPnC were listed. 
All summaries showed the number and percentage of subjects who experienced at least 1 event of each 
preferred term, arranged by system organ class, and the number of occurrences of the event. 
Study 6115A1-3003 (B1851022): recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) aged ≥2 years, who have not received a pneumococcal vaccine since HSCT; final study 
report. 
Study Design:  
This was a Phase 3, open-label trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of 4 doses of 
13vPnC followed by 1 dose of 23vPS in recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation 
6 
 
 
(HSCT) aged 2 years and older. The study was conducted in Belgium, Canada, the Czech Republic, 
France, Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the United States. 
Approximately 300 subjects participated in this study at up to 100 sites. It was anticipated that at least 
150 adults (≥ 18 years) would be enrolled, though the total number of subjects enrolled and the ratio of 
pediatric subjects (≥ 2 to <18 years) to adults (≥ 18 years) was dependent on the sites ability to recruit 
into each strata. In this study, approximately 3 to 6 months (91 to 203 days) after HSCT, all subjects were 
to receive 4 doses of 13vPnC followed by 1 dose of 23vPS. Doses 1 to 3 of 13vPnC were to be administered 
at approximately 1-month intervals, Dose 4 at approximately 6 months after Dose 3 of 13vPnC, and 
23vPS was to be administered at approximately 1 month after Dose 4 of 13vPnC. 
The CHMP noted that the study did not include a healthy control group, and therefore comparisons to 
healthy subjects are not possible.

Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria:  
Subjects eligible for the study were male or female recipients of allogeneic HSCT aged ≥2 years of age. 
Subjects underwent allogeneic HSCT approximately 3 to 6 months (91 to 203 days) before enrollment for 
hematologic disorder. Subjects also underwent allogeneic HSCT with full myeloablative conditioning or 
reduced intensity conditioning and had stable engraftment (absolute neutrophil count [ANC] >1000/μL; 
platelet count >50,000/μL). Subjects with complete hematologic remission of underlying disease with 
very good partial remission (VGPR) acceptable in the case of lymphoma and myeloma were eligible. 
Subjects biologically capable of having children agreed to abstinence or were committed to the use of a 
reliable method of birth control from signing of the informed consent form (ICF) until 3 months after the 
last vaccination. Subjects who had a hematological recovery as defined by ANC >1000/μL; platelet count 
>50,000/μL were eligible. Subjects or a parent/legal guardian had to be able to complete an electronic 
diary (e-diary) and complete all relevant study procedures during study participation. 
Subjects were excluded if they had an autologous HSCT, had an uncontrolled graft-versus-host disease 
(GVHD), had a Lansky/Karnofsky score of ≤60%, or had previously been vaccinated with any licensed or 
experimental pneumococcal vaccine since HSCT. Subjects with receipt of donor lymphocyte infusions 
during the 28 days preceding enrollment; plasma products or immunoglobulins during the 60 days 
preceding enrollment; rituximab and chemotherapy for relapse of underlying malignant disease since 
HSCT; and advanced therapy medicinal products (ATMP) including gene therapy products, somatic cell 
therapy products, and tissue engineered products at any time before enrollment were also excluded. 
Vaccines Administered: 
•  13-valent Pneumococcal Conjugate Vaccine: Commercial formulation 
•  23-valent Pneumococcal Polysaccharide Vaccine: Commercial formulation 
Subjects received 1 dose (0.5 mL) of 13vPnC at each of the 13vPnC visits (Visits 1, 2, 3, and 5), and a 
single 23vPS dose (0.5 mL) at Visit 6. Each dose of vaccine was administered intramuscularly. 
Immunogenicity Evaluations:  
Seven (7) blood samples (total volume of approximately 70 mL of blood [10 mL at Visits 1 to 7]) for 
immunogenicity assessments were collected for the duration of the study from all subjects. 
Serotype-specific IgG concentrations to the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 7F, 9V, 14, 
18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) were determined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The 
immunogenicity variables collected for this study were the results of IgG ELISAs performed on the blood 
samples collected. 
The CHMP noted that OPA responses were not studied at all. 
Safety Evaluations  
On days 1 to 14 after the 13vPnC administration, subjects reported reactogenicity (local reactions and 
systemic events) in e-diaries. Local reactions included pain, redness, and swelling at the injection site. 
8 
 
Systemic events included fever, vomiting, diarrhea, headache, fatigue, muscle pain, joint pain, and use of 
antipyretic and pain medications for treatment of symptoms. 
AEs were recorded on the case report form (CRF) from the time the subject had taken at least 1 dose of 
study treatment through last subject visit. For nonserious AEs, all AEs were reported from the time that 
the subject provided informed consent through Visit 4 and from Visit 5 to Visit 7. At Visit 5 and Visit 8, only 
newly diagnosed chronic medical conditions (including autoimmune or neuroinflammatory diseases) that 
occurred since the last visit were recorded (in addition to all serious adverse events [SAEs] reported 
during these intervals). Stop dates were collected for all AEs that resolved from Visit 1 through Visit 8. The 
SAEs collected from the signing of the ICF to the first dose of 13vPnC were listed. The information 
collected for SAEs was more detailed than that captured on the AE CRF. AEs were categorized according 
to the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA). The relationship between AEs and the 
investigational product was characterized as related or not related as described in the protocol. The 
severity of AEs was characterized as mild, moderate, severe, or life-threatening. 
Statistical Methods 
The number and percentage of subjects consenting, assigned vaccine, completing, and withdrawing from 
the study were tabulated for each age group and the total sample. 
Immunogenicity 
For the 13 serotypes contained in 13vPnC, the serotype-specific IgG concentrations were logarithmically 
transformed for analysis. IgG GMCs were computed at each visit (before Vaccination 1, before Vaccination 
4 and 1 month after each vaccination). Two (2)-sided, 95% confidence intervals were constructed at each 
visit by back transformation of the confidence intervals for the mean of the logarithmically transformed  
ssay results computed using the Student t distribution. 
Fold rises in IgG concentrations were summarized by geometric means and confidence intervals using 
methodology similar to that used for GMCs. IgG GMCs and IgG geometric mean fold rises (GMFRs) were 
computed for subjects aged ≥ 2 years, ≥ 2 to <18 years, and ≥ 18 years. 
The proportion of subjects with serotype-specific IgG concentrations ≥ 0.35 μg/mL was assessed after 
each vaccination and the corresponding exact 95% confidence intervals using the F distribution were 
generated. The difference in proportion of subjects with IgG ≥ 0.35 μg/mL and corresponding 95% 
confidence intervals for the difference in dependent proportions using an adjusted Wald interval were 
computed for the comparison of immune response 1 month after 4 doses of 13vPnC versus 1 month after 
3 doses of 13vPnC. Differences were considered statistically higher when lower limit of 95%CI were 
greater than 0. 
Reverse cumulative distribution curves (RCDCs) for IgG concentrations were presented after 4 doses of 
13vPnC and after 3 doses of 13vPnC for each of the 13 serotypes contained in 13vPnC. RCDC were based 
on the evaluable immunogenicity population for subjects aged ≥ 2 years, ≥ 2 to <18 years, and ≥ 18 
years and were plotted on the same graph repeated by age group for each serotype. 
Serotype-specific antibody response curves were presented graphically for IgG concentrations assessed 
at each time point. Antibody response curves were based on the evaluable immunogenicity population for 
subjects aged ≥ 2 years, ≥ 2 to <18 years, and ≥ 18 years. 
Safety 
The local reactions and systemic events, including fever and use of antipyretic medications and pain 
medication, were summarized by 2 types of tables and 1 plot by vaccine dose, age group, and overall 
population. For local reactions and systemic events, including fever, the duration of the event was 
summarized for each vaccine dose, age group, and total sample, using descriptive statistics. AEs and 
9 
 
severe AEs were summarized for each age group separately for each dose. In addition, a listing of SAEs, 
subjects hospitalized, and deaths was generated. Nonstudy vaccines received from the time of HSCT to 
before Dose 1 and any nonstudy vaccines received after vaccination at Dose 1 were categorized using 
only preferred terms according to the World Health Organization (WHO) Drug dictionary. The number and 
percentage of subjects receiving each vaccine was tabulated for each age group. 
Study 6096A1-3014 (B1851013): children and adolescents aged ≥6 to <18 years with SCD, 
previously immunized with 23vPS; 6-month safety addendum and 1-year final study report). 
Study Design  
This was a Phase 3, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study in children ≥ 6 to <18 years of age 
previously immunized with 23vPS who received 2 doses of 13vPnC, given approximately 6 months apart. 
Originally, 200 subjects were planned to be enrolled at up to 20 sites; however, due to difficulty 
identifying adequate numbers of subjects meeting the inclusion criteria, this was amended to 150 
subjects at up to 25 sites. The study was conducted in the USA, the United Kingdom (UK), Italy, Lebanon, 
Egypt, France, and Saudi Arabia. 
The CHMP noted that the first phase of this study was assessed in variation II/76, i.e. up to 1 month after 
the second dose.  
Objectives 
Primary Objectives: 
• 
To evaluate the immune response 1 month after 2 doses of 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate 
vaccine (13vPnC) given 6 months apart compared to 1 month after 1 dose of 13vPnC as 
measured by fold rise in serotype-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG) geometric mean 
concentrations (GMCs) in children with sickle cell disease (SCD) who had previously been 
vaccinated with at least 1 dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPS). 
Primary safety objective: 
• 
To evaluate the acceptability of the safety profile of 13vPnC, as measured by the incidence rates 
of local reactions, systemic events, and adverse events (AEs). 
Secondary Objectives: 
• 
• 
To evaluate the immune response 1 month after 2 doses of 13vPnC given 6 months apart

Immunogenicity Evaluations 
Serum concentrations of anticapsular IgG for each of the 13 pneumococcal serotypes (1, 3, 4, 5, 6A, 6B, 
7F, 9V, 14, 18C, 19A, 19F, and 23F) in 13vPnC were determined for all subjects for each blood sample by 
enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and expressed as micrograms per milliliter (μg/mL). 
Serum OPA assays to the 13 pneumococcal serotypes were performed on all blood samples collected, and 
the results were reported as antibody titers. 
Safety Evaluations 
Local reactions and systemic events were not collected during the study period covered in this report. All 
information related to collection of local reactions and systemic events can be found in the primary 
analysis CSR and in the final protocol and protocol amendments. 
All observed or volunteered AEs, defined as any untoward medical occurrence regardless of suspected 
causal relationship to the investigational product, were reported. For all AEs or SAEs, sufficient 
information was to be obtained by the investigator to determine the causality of the AE. AEs were 
recorded in the CRF from the time the subject or subject’s parent/legal guardian provided informed 
consent through Visit 2 and from Visit 3 to Visit 4. For SAEs, the active reporting period began from the 
time that the subject provided informed consent through Visit 6. SAEs occurring to a subject after the 
active reporting period had ended was reported to the sponsor if the investigator became aware of them; 
at a minimum all SAEs that investigator believed had at least a reasonable possibility of being related to 
the study were reported to the sponsor. Follow-up by the investigator was required until the event or its 
squeals resolved or stabilized at a level acceptable to the investigator, and the MAH concurred with that 
assessment. 
Statistical Methods 
The primary data analysis was the summarization of data following 2 doses of 13vPnC. The IgG geometric 
mean fold rises (GMFRs) following Dose 2 relative to after dose 1 for each serotype was the primary 
analysis endpoint. This was summarized for subjects having data following both doses using 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs). IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs at each blood sampling visit, the GMFRs at each 
dose, the GMFRs in OPA following Dose 2 relative to Dose 1 for each serotype and the difference in GMFRs 
between doses were similarly summarized. The primary immunogenicity population was the evaluable 
immunogenicity population, which consisted of subjects eligible for the study, received all the assigned 
vaccinations, had blood drawn within required time frames, had sufficient valid and determinate assay 
result for the proposed analysis, received no prohibited vaccines or medications, did not receive 
immunoglobulins or chronic systemic corticosteroids during the study, and had no major protocol 
violations. The all-available immunogenicity population consisted of subjects who had at least 1 valid and 
determinate pneumococcal assay result related to a proposed analysis. 
All subjects who received 2 doses of 13vPnC and continued in the study after the 6-month follow-up 
telephone contact (Visit 5) were included in the safety population. All of the safety and immunogenicity 
data up to Visit 4 were included in the primary analysis report. The analyses of immunogenicity and safety 
data for the 1-year follow-up visit are presented in this report. Immunogenicity data were also presented 
kinetically in this report by including the data collected during the vaccination phase (Visit 1-4).

2.2.2.  Results 
Study 6115A1-3002 (B1851021) in HIV-Infected Subjects 
Subject Disposition and Demography: 
Of the 303 subjects assigned to receive study vaccine, 301 subjects (99.3%) received Dose 1 of 13vPnC 
(150 pediatric [99.3%] and 151 adult [99.3%] subjects), 290 subjects (95.7%) received Dose 2 of 
13vPnC (145 pediatric [96.0%] and 145 adult [95.4%] subjects), 286 subjects (94.4%) received Dose 3 
of 13vPnC (144 pediatric [95.4%] and 142 adult [93.4%] subjects), and 282 subjects (93.1%) received 
23vPS (143 pediatric [94.7%] and 139 adult [91.4%] subjects). The majority of subjects assigned to the 
study completed the blood draw after the 23vPS dose (280 subjects, 92.4%). Of the 280 subjects to 
complete the blood draw after the 23vPS dose, 141 (93.4%) were from the 6- to <18-year age group and 
139 (91.4%) were from the ≥ 18-year age group. A total of 279 subjects (92.1%) completed the study, 
with 141 (93.4%) from the 6- to <18-year age group and 138 (90.8%) from the ≥ 18-year age group. 
Completion of the study meant completing the 6-month follow up.  
Two (2) subjects who were assigned to the study did not receive vaccine and were withdrawn from the 
study. Of the 23 subjects (7.6%) withdrawn before the blood draw visit after 23vPS, 10 (6.6%) were from 
the paediatric population and 13 (8.6) were from the ≥ 18-year age group. 
The majority of the subjects in the overall safety population (≥ 6-year age group) were female (54.5%) 
and black or African American (84.7%), with a mean age at vaccination of 25.8±16.72 years. The 6- to 
<18-year age group had a slightly higher proportion of male subject than the ≥ 18-year age group 
(49.3% and 41.7%, respectively). The mean age of the 6- to <18-year age group was 10.3 years, while 
the mean age of the ≥ 18-year age group was 41.2 years.  
The majority of the safety population was receiving HAART at baseline (97.3%), and that was similar 
between the 2 age groups. The mean CD4+ cell count at the first and second baseline assessments were 
717.0 cells/μL and 718.1 cells/μL, respectively; the mean CD4+ cell count was higher in the 6- to 
<18-year age group compared with the ≥ 18-year age group at both baseline assessments. The mean 
viral load at the first and second baseline assessments was 2090.0 copies/mL and 1592.2 copies/mL, 
respectively; the mean viral load was lower in the 6- to <18-year age group at first assessment and 
higher at second assessment compared with the ≥ 18-year age group. The subjects in the 2 subgroups 
(age 6 to <18 years) and (age ≥ 18 years) were similar with respect to demographic characteristics. 
IgG Results 
IgG GMCs and GMFRs Before and After Doses:  
IgG GMCs were statistically significantly higher after Dose 1 than before Dose 1 for all serotypes; ie, the 
lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMFR (postdose 1/predose 1) was >1. GMFRs for Dose 1 ranged from 
1.38 to 10.38 in the overall evaluable population (GMFR data not shown in this AR). Generally, results for 
the 6 to <18 year age group and the ≥ 18-year age group were comparable to each other and to the 
overall evaluable immunogenicity population; GMFRs (postdose 1/predose 1) were higher for serotypes 4 
and 14 in the 6 to <18 years age group compared with the ≥ 18 years age group. 
IgG GMCs at all sampling time points (before and 1 month after Dose 1 and 1 month after each 
succeeding vaccination) were presented by the MAH. In each group, the IgG GMCs after Dose 2 and Dose 
3 and after the 23vPS dose were generally similar to, or somewhat higher than, those after Dose 1 for 
13 
 
most serotypes. Overall, IgG GMCs in subjects 6 to <18 years of age and in those ≥ 18 years of age were 
similar. 
Comparison of IgG Response Between Doses:  
Dose 2 vs Dose 1: IgG GMCs after Dose 2 were similar to or higher than those after Dose 1 in the overall 
population and in the 2 age subgroups. The GMFRs of IgG GMCs (postdose 2/postdose 1) ranged from 
0.99 to 1.24 in subjects ≥ 6 years of age and were statistically significantly higher after Dose 2 (the lower 
limit of the 2-sided, 95% CI for the GMFRs >1) for 7 of the 13 serotypes (1, 3, 4, 6B, 7F, 19F, and 23F).  
Dose 3 vs Dose 2: IgG GMCs after Dose 3 were similar to or higher than those after Dose 2 in the overall 
population and in the 2 age subgroups. In subjects aged ≥ 6 years The GMFRs of IgG GMCs (postdose 
3/postdose 2) ranged from 0.99 to 1.10; IgG GMCs after Dose 3 were statistically significantly higher for 
6 of the 13 serotypes (4, 6B, 7F, 9V, 19F, and 23F). 
Dose 3 vs Dose 1: IgG GMCs were similar or higher after Dose 3 than after Dose 1 in the overall group and 
in the paediatric and adult subgroups. The GMFRs of IgG GMCs (postdose 3/postdose 1) ranged from 0.97 
to 1.31 in the subjects aged ≥ 6 years; IgG GMCs after Dose 3 were statistically significantly higher (i.e., 
lower limit of 95% CI of GMFR >1) than GMCs after Dose 1 for 9 of the 13 serotypes (all but serotypes 5, 
14, 18C, and 19A). 
23vPS dose vs Dose 3: The GMFRs of IgG GMCs ranged from 0.92 to 1.09 for subjects in the overall 
population (≥ 6-year age group). GMCs were statistically significantly higher after 23vPS for 3 of 13 
serotypes (5, 9V, and 19F), were statistically significantly lower (the upper limit of the 2-sided, 95% CI 
for the GMFRs <1) for 3 serotypes (6B, 18C, and 23F), and were similar to those after 13vPnC Dose 3 for 
the other 7 serotypes. Results in subjects 6 to <18 years of age and in those ≥ 18 years of age were not 
notably different than those in the overall population. 
Comparison of IgG GMFRs Between Doses: 
GMFRs (postdose/predose) were compared between doses, based on the ratio of GMFRs (eg, GMFR Dose 
2/GMFR Dose 1), to assess the rise in antibody response from prevaccination levels after successive 
doses. The comparison of GMFRs (postdose/predose) between Dose 1 and Dose 2 (GMFR Dose 2/GMFR 
Dose 1) showed that GMFRs (postdose/predose) for Dose 1 were higher than GMFRs (postdose/predose) 
for Dose 2, while GMFRs (postdose/predose) for Dose 2  and Dose 3 were similar in the overall study 
population and in each age subgroup.  
OPA Results 
OPA GMTs and GMFRs Before and After Doses: 
OPA GMTs were statistically significantly higher after Dose 1 than before Dose 1 for all serotypes; ie, the 
lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMFR (postdose 1/predose 1) was >1. GMFRs for Dose 1 ranged from 4.5 
to 66.8 in the overall evaluable population. In general, GMFRs for the 2 age groups were comparable, with 
a few exceptions; GMFRs for serotypes 4, 18C, 19F, and 23F were higher in the 6 to <18-year age group 
while the GMFR for 7F was lower in the 6 to <18-year age group. 
OPA GMTs at all sampling time points (before and 1 month after Dose 1 and 1 month after each 
succeeding vaccination) were presented by the MAH. OPA GMTs after Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 and 
after the 23vPS dose remained higher than baseline levels (before Dose 1) for all serotypes in each age 
subgroup and in the entire study population. For most serotypes, the GMTs after Dose 2 and Dose 3 and 
after the 23vPS dose were somewhat higher than those after Dose 1 in the overall population and in each 
age subgroup. OPA GMTs after each dose were generally higher in the paediatric subgroup than in the 
14 
 
adult subgroup. To illustrate the kinetic patterns OPA response curves are shown for some serotypes 
below. 
Comparison of OPA Response Between Doses: (GMFR data not shown in this AR) 
Dose 2 vs Dose 1: In the overall population, GMFRs (postdose 2/postdose 1) of OPA GMTs ranged from 
1.0 to 2.8 (Table 9). OPA GMTs after Dose 2 were statistically significantly higher (the lower limit of the 
2-sided, 95% CI for the GMFRs >1) than after Dose 1 for 10 of 13 serotypes (all but 1, 7F, and 14) in the 
overall population. Results were similar in the 2 age subgroups. 
Dose 3 vs Dose 2: The GMFRs (postdose 3/postdose 2) ranged from 1.1 to 1.7 in subjects aged ≥ 6 years. 
OPA GMTs after Dose 3 were statistically significantly higher than after Dose 2 for 12 of 13 serotypes (all 
but serotype 14) in the overall population (Table 10). Similar results were observed in the 2 age 
subgroups. 
Dose 3 vs Dose 1: GMFRs (postdose 3/postdose 1) of OPA GMTs ranged from 1.1 to 4.6 in the overall 
population. OPA GMTs after Dose 3 were statistically significantly higher (i.e., lower limit of 95% CI of 
GMFR >1) than those after Dose 1 for all 13 serotypes in the overall evaluable population. Results were 
not notably different in the 2 age subgroups. 
23vPS dose vs Dose 3: GMFRs ranged from 0.9 to 1.4 for subjects in the ≥ 6 year age group. OPA GMTs 
after the 23vPS dose were similar to or higher than those after Dose 3 for most serotypes. OPA GMTs were 
statistically significantly higher after 23vPS than after Dose 3 of 13vPnC for 8 of the 13 serotypes (all but 
4, 6A, 6B, and 23F); OPA GMTs were statistically significantly lower after 23vPS for serotypes 6A (not in 
23vPS) and 6B; ie, the upper limit of the 95% CI of the GMFR was <1.  Results were not notably different 
in the 2 age subgroups.  
The CHMP noted that the OPA GMTs were consistently numerically higher in children compared to adults. 
Otherwise the pattern seen in IgG responses, i.e. GMC and GMT rises after the first dose, which were 
modestly increased after dose 2 and 3. There were also modest increases after the 23vPS vaccine. When 
comparing with the previously submitted study in subjects with earlier 23vPS vaccination, the GMCs and 
GMTs in the current study were higher, but there were differences also between baseline levels, so this 
should be interpreted with caution. 
Study 6115A1-3003 (B1851022): recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) aged ≥2 years, who have not received a pneumococcal vaccine since HSCT; final study 
report. 
Subject Disposition and Demography 
Of the 251 subjects assigned to receive study vaccine, 247 subjects (98.4%) received Dose 1 of 13vPnC 
(59 pediatric [96.7%] and 188 adult [98.9%] subjects), 231 subjects (92.0%) received Dose 2 of 13vPnC 
(55 pediatric [90.2%] and 176 adult [92.6%] subjects), 221 subjects (88.0%) received Dose 3 of 13vPnC 
(54 pediatric [88.5%] and 167 adult [87.9%] subjects), 192 subjects (76.5%) received Dose 4 of 13vPnC 
(46 pediatric [75.4%] and 146 adult [76.8%] subjects), and 185 subjects (73.7%) received 23vPS (45 
pediatric [73.8%] and 140 adult [73.7%] subjects). The majority of subjects assigned to the study 
completed the blood draw 1 month after Dose 3 of 13vPnC (217 subjects [86.5%]; 53 pediatric [86.9%] 
and 164 adult [86.3%]). A total of 185 subjects (73.7%) completed the blood draw 1 month after the 
23vPS dose. Of the 185 subjects to complete the blood draw 1 month after the 23vPS dose, 45 subjects 
(73.8%) were from the 2- to <18-year age group and 140 subjects (73.7%) were from the ≥ 18-year age 
group. A total of 184 subjects (73.3%) completed the study, with 45 subjects (73.8%) from the 2- to 
15 
 
<18-year age group and 139 subjects (73.2%) from the ≥ 18-year age group. Completing the study was 
defined as completing the 6-month follow up. 
The sex of the majority of subjects in the overall safety population (age ≥ 2 years) was male (59.5%), and 
the ethnicity of the majority of subjects in the overall age group (age ≥ 2 years) was white (76.5%). The 
overall age group (age ≥ 2 years) had a mean age at vaccination of 38.4±19.26 years. The mean age of 
the 2- to <18-year age group was 10.3±4.41 years, while the mean age of the ≥ 18-year age group was 
47.3±12.39 years. Other demographic characteristics were similar between the age groups. 
IgG Results 
To address the primary objective of the study, GMFRs in serotype specific IgG GMCs from baseline (before 
Dose 1) to 1 month after 3 doses of 13vPnC were assessed in subjects ≥ 2 years of age and in the 
subgroups 2 to <18 years of age and ≥ 18 years of age. IgG GMCs were statistically significantly higher 
(lower limit of 95% CI for the GMFR >1) after Dose 3 than before Dose 1 for all serotypes in the evaluable 
immunogenicity population as a whole and in the 2 age subgroups. 
Overall, GMFRs from baseline (before Dose 1) to after Dose 1, Dose 2, or Dose 3 (doses spaced 1 month 
apart) increased with each succeeding dose in the group ≥ 2 years of age; GMFRs for each dose were as 
follows: Dose 1 (range: 1.64 to 6.01), Dose 2 (range: 1.93 to 11.02) and Dose 3 (range: 2.99 to 23.85).  
Results were similar in the pediatric and adult subgroups.  
For all age groups, the GMFRs from baseline to after Dose 4, given 6 months after Dose 3, were notably 
higher than the GMFRs for the first 3 doses of 13vPnC, each given a month apart; i.e., in the overall 
population, GMFRs after Dose 4 ranged from 6.28 to 55.02 across serotypes.  
The GMFRs from baseline (before Dose 1) to after a single dose of 23vPS, given 1 month after Dose 4 of 
13vPnC, were generally similar or lower than those for Dose 4 of 13vPnC in all age groups. 
IgG GMCs at each time point and in each age group were presented by the MAH. Overall, GMCs increased 
after each 13vPnC dose for all serotypes. Although IgG GMCs declined over the 6 months between Dose 
3 and Dose 4, antibody levels before Dose 4 remained higher than those after Dose 1 for all serotypes and 
after Dose 2 for 8 of 13 serotypes (all but serotypes 1, 3, 4, 5, 7F, which remained above baseline) in the 
overall population. In the 2 age subgroups, IgG GMCs before Dose 4 remained higher than those after 
Dose 1 for most serotypes. With few exceptions, IgG GMCs were higher in the 2 to <18 year group than 
in the >18 year age group. 
In all age groups, a notable increase was observed in IgG GMCs after Dose 4 relative to antibody 
concentrations before Dose 4 (Table 13). In the overall population the GMFRs (postdose 4/predose 4) 
ranged from 3.00 to 6.97 across serotypes. For each serotype the rise in IgG GMCs after Dose 4 was 
statistically significant (lower limit of 95% CI for GMFR >1) for subjects in the overall study population 
and in the 2 age subgroups.  
When postvaccination IgG GMCs were compared between doses, antibody concentrations were 
significantly increased after each succeeding 13vPnC dose in subjects ≥ 2 years old for most serotypes. 
The GMFRs in IgG GMCs from Dose 1 to Dose 2 (postdose 2/postdose 1) ranged from 1.07 to 1.83. IgG 
GMCs were statistically significantly higher after Dose 2 than after Dose 1, for all serotypes, except for 
serotype 14, in subjects aged ≥ 2 years; a similar pattern of response was observed in the 2 age 
subgroups (aged 2 to <18 years and ≥ 18 years). To illustrate the kinetic patterns IgG response curves 
are shown for some serotypes below.  
In subjects aged ≥ 2 years, GMFRs from Dose 2 to Dose 3 (postdose 3/postdose 2) ranged from 1.28 to 
2.09. For all serotypes, IgG GMCs were statistically significantly higher after Dose 3 than after Dose 2; ie, 
16 
 
the lower limit of the 95% CI for the GMFR was >1. Similarly, IgG GMCs in each subgroup were 
statistically significantly higher after Dose 3 than after Dose 2 for all serotypes. 
After the 6-month interval between Dose 3 and Dose 4, the GMFRs (postdose 4/postdose 3) ranged from 
1.20 to 3.61 across serotypes. IgG GMCs were statistically significantly higher (lower limit of 95% CI for 
the GMFR >1) after Dose 4 than after Dose 3 for all serotypes in the overall population. A similar pattern 
of response was observed in each of the 2 age subgroups, except for serotype 3 in the 2 to <18-year-old 
group (GMFR lower limit of 95% CI <1 for serotype 3).  
Serotype-specific IgG GMCs did not increase from after Dose 4 to after the 23vPS dose for most serotypes 
(lower limit of the 95% CI for GMFR <1 for 12 of 13 serotypes, exception 9V in the overall group and adult 
subgroup) in subjects aged ≥ 2 years and in the pediatric and adult subgroups; however immune 
responses were generally maintained after the 23vPS dose. 
The CHMP noted that the study did not include healthy immunocompetent subjects as a control group, 
and OPA responses were not measured. The IgG responses increased with each subsequent dose, and 
although a decrease was seen between dose 3 and 4, the response to the fourth dose was higher than the 
the third dose, which could be interpreted as an indication of immunological memory. In conclusion the 
results are reassuring regarding the benefit of vaccinating HSCT recipients. The benefit of the 23vPS 
vaccine in increasing the immune responses to the serotypes present in Prevenar 13 is not demonstrated, 
but it is possible that immune responses to the remaining serotypes increased, although these were not 
measured.  
Study 6096A1-3014 (B1851013): children and adolescents aged ≥6 to <18 years with SCD, 
previously immunized with 23vPS; 6-month safety addendum and 1-year final study report). 
Subject Disposition and Demography 
A total of 147 subjects completed the 6-month follow-up visit including the 1 subject who did not receive 
Dose 2, but did complete the 6-month follow-up visit. Of the 146 subjects who might have been eligible 
for the 1-year follow-up visit, 57 subjects had either already completed the study before Protocol 
Amendment 2 , which introduced the 1-year follow-up visit, or they decided not to continue while they 
were given the opportunity to reconsent for the 1-year follow-up visit. Of the 89 subjects who were 
eligible for the 1-year follow-up visit and decided to continue for the 1-year follow-up, 87 subjects 
completed the follow-up visit and 2 subjects withdrew before the visit. 
Of the 89 (56.3%) subjects who continued after the 6-month follow-up visit, 82 (51.9%) subjects had 
blood drawn within the specified time frame at the 1-year follow-up visit, 5 (3.2%) subjects had blood 
drawn outside the window at >469 days, and 2 (1.3%) subjects did not have blood sample drawn. 
Permitted nonstudy vaccines were given to 18 (20.7%) subjects between the 6-month follow-up and 
1-year follow-up visits. The majority (14 [16.1%]) of subjects received an influenza vaccine. No subject 
received a prohibited vaccine. Between the 6-month follow-up and the 1-year follow-up visits, 9 (10.3%) 
subjects received blood transfusions. Of the 158 enrolled subjects, 81 (51.3%) were included in the 
evaluable immunogenicity population at the 1-year follow-up visit. The reasons for exclusion from the 
evaluable immunogenicity population at 1-year follow-up were: excluded from the all available 
immunogenicity population at 1-year follow-up (71 subjects, 44.9%), blood draw >469 days after 
Vaccination 2 (5 subjects, 3.2%), and received prohibited vaccines or medications during the study (1 
subject, 0.6%).

IgG Results 
Overall, the IgG GMCs increased after each dose.  The IgG GMCs at 1 year after Dose 2 were higher than 
the IgG GMCs before Dose 1 for all serotypes, with the exception of serotype 3.  For serotype 3 the IgG 
GMC was 1.02 µg/mL before Dose 1 and 1.01 µg/mL at 1 year after Dose 2. For all serotypes, IgG GMCs 
at 1 year after Dose 2 were lower than IgG GMCs 1 month after Dose 1, before Dose 2, and 1 month after 
Dose 2.  
The CHMP noted that the immune responses 1 month after the second dose were assessed in variation 
II76, and will not be further discussed here. The GMCs at 1 year after dose 2 were generally higher 
compared to the prevaccination levels, but for serotypes 1, 3 and 5 the 95% CI were overlapping.  
OPA Results 
Overall, the OPA GMTs increased after each dose.  The OPA GMTs at 1 year after Dose 2 were higher than 
the OPA GMTs before Dose 1 for all serotypes, including serotype 3.  
The OPA GMTs at 1 year after Dose 2 were higher than those before Dose 2 for 6 serotypes (1, 5, 7F, 9V, 
19F and 23F).  For all serotypes, the OPA GMTs at 1 year after Dose 2 were lower than the OPA GMTs 1 
month after Dose 1 and 1 month after Dose 2.  
The CHMP noted that the OPA responses were elevated at one year after dose 2 compared to 
prevaccination values, with non-overlapping 95% CIs. 
2.2.3.  Discussion 
The current variation includes additional data for risk groups, which are considered very important by the 
CHMP. In a previous variation (II/76), data from the study on subjects with sickle cell disease and another 
study in HIV infected individuals were assessed, as well as a study in preterm infants.  
In general, the immune response in the current studies was in agreement with previously submitted data. 
The resulting SmPC changes (see section 2.5 below) are mostly endorsed as they adequately describe the 
data. 
In HIV infected subjects, the GMCs and GMTs increased substantially after the first dose, and were 
modestly increased after dose 2 and 3. There was also minor increase after the 23vPS vaccine. The OPA 
GMTs were consistently numerically higher in children compared to adults. When comparing with the 
previously submitted study in subjects with earlier 23vPS vaccination, the GMCs and GMTs in the current 
study were higher, but there were differences also between baseline levels, so this should be interpreted 
with caution.  
In HSCT recipients, the study in HSCT recipients was uncontrolled and immune responses were only 
assessed using IgG ELISA, not OPA. The IgG responses increased with each subsequent dose, and 
although a decrease was seen between dose 3 and 4, the response to the fourth dose was higher than the 
response to the third dose, which could be interpreted as an indication of immunological memory. In 
conclusion the results are reassuring regarding the benefit of vaccinating HSCT recipients. The benefit of 
the 23vPS vaccine in increasing the immune responses to the serotypes present in Prevenar 13 is not 
demonstrated, but it is possible that immune responses to the remaining serotypes increased, although 
these were not measured. The proposed dosing, 3 doses at 1 month intervals with a fourth dose 6 months 
after the third dose, is considered justified by the presented immunogenicity data. Considering that the 
study in HSCT recipients was uncontrolled, it is not considered appropriate to include a statement in the 
SPC comparing the results of 4 doses in HSCT recipients to healthy subjects of the same age.

In Sickle cell disease subjects, the immune responses 1 month after the second dose were assessed in 
variation II/76. With the present submission, the GMCs at 1 year after dose 2 were generally higher 
compared to the pre-vaccination levels, but for serotypes 1, 3 and 5 the 95% CI were overlapping. The 
OPA responses were in agreement with the IgG responses, but the 95% CIs were not overlapping for any 
serotypes. The final data from the study in sickle cell disease patients confirm the preliminary data 
submitted with variation II/76. 
2.3.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.3.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
Study 6115A1-3002 (B1851021) in HIV-Infected Subjects 
Local Reactions 
In the overall safety population (ages 6 years of age and older) at least one local reaction was reported in 
62.4% to 71.5% of subjects across the three 13vPnC doses (Table 1).  The percentages of subjects with 
local reactions in the 2 age subgroups were not notably different than in the overall safety population.  In 
the younger age subgroup (6 to <18 years) the percentage of subjects with local reactions decreased 
over the 3 doses whereas, this pattern was not present in the older subgroup (≥18 years).  The majority 
of local reactions were mild or moderate and duration of local reactions did not exceed 3 days in the safety 
population overall or in the 2 age subgroups. 
Pain was the local reaction reported most frequently in subjects aged ≥6 years of age. In the 2 age 
subgroups, the percentage of subjects reporting pain was comparable to that observed in the safety 
population overall. However, severe pain was somewhat more frequently reported in the group aged 6 to 
<18 years (≤8.1%) than in the group aged ≥18-years (≤5.5%) or in the overall safety population 
(≤5.1%).   
In the 2 subgroups, the percentages of subjects reporting redness and swelling were higher in subjects 
aged 6 to <18 years (redness ≤20.7%; swelling ≤29.9%) than in subjects aged ≥18 years (redness 
≤2.3%; swelling ≤9.6%) and in the safety population overall (redness ≤19.9%; swelling ≤0.6%).

Systemic Events 
In the overall safety population systemic events were reported at a decreasing frequency after each 
succeeding dose (Dose 1, 81.2%; Dose 2, 68.7%; and Dose 3, 62.6%, Table 2). This same pattern was 
observed in the 2 age subgroups, with a higher percentage of systemic events reported in adults aged 
≥18 years than in the subgroup aged 6 to <18 years. 
In the overall safety population, the most frequently reported systemic events were: (percentages from 
Dose 1 to Dose 3) muscle pain (55.8% to 42.4%), fatigue (53.5% to 36.1%) and headache (50.5% to 
32.2%); the frequency of these individual events declined with each dose.  Muscle pain, fatigue, and 
headache were also reported most frequently in the 2 age subgroups, with the same pattern of declining 
percentages with each dose.  These 3 events accounted for most of the severe systemic events in the 
overall population and in each age subgroup; severe muscle pain, severe fatigue, and severe headache 
were each reported in fewer than 10% of subjects. Overall, most systemic events were mild or moderate 
and lasted less than 7 days. 
The incidence of fever (≥38°C) was ≤18.5% after each dose of 13vPnC, and most reports of fever were 
mild (<38.5°C).  Similar results were observed for both age groups (6 to <18-year and ≥18-year age 
groups).   
Fever >40oC was reported in 14 subjects at Dose 1, 2 subjects at Dose 2, and 4 subjects at Dose 3. All 
have been confirmed by the investigators as data entry errors, except for 1 subject in the pediatric group 
with fever >40oC after Dose 3.

Adverse Events  
The percentage of subjects reporting any AEs after any dose of 13vPnC (does not include AEs reported 
after the 23vPS dose) was 26.2% in the overall safety population (≥6-year age group, Table 9); the 
percentage of subjects reporting any AE was higher in the 6- to <18-year age group (34.0%) compared 
with the ≥18-year age group (18.5%). 
In the overall safety population (≥6-year age group), the most frequently occurring type (system organ 
class) of AEs after any dose of 13vPnC were infections and infestations, which were reported in 15.9% of 
subjects (18.0% of subjects in 6- to <18-year age group, 13.9% in the ≥18-year age group). 
AEs reported after any dose of 13vPnC showed similar trends as those observed after any dose of 
investigational vaccines (13vPnC and 23vPS, not including follow-up AEs).  The percentage of general 
disorders and administration site conditions reported after any dose of investigational vaccine (13vPnC 
and 23vPS) was higher than that reported after any dose of 13vPnC in the overall safety population (7% 
vs 3%, respectively); this percentage includes local reactions reported after 23vPS, which were reported 
as AEs since there was no e-diary data collection of such events after 23vPS. 
The AEs reported in study 3002 were consistent with events expected in HIV-infected children and adults.  
Infections and infestations were the most frequently occurring types of AEs after any dose (13vPnC and 
23vPS). The frequency of AEs was somewhat higher for subjects in the pediatric subgroup compared with 
the adult subgroup.

Deaths 
One (1) subject died during the study in a road traffic accident and passed away at the scene of the 
accident.  The investigator and the sponsor considered the event of road traffic accident leading to death 
to be not related to 13vPnC vaccination or the protocol procedures. 
Serious Adverse Events, Related SAEs, AE Withdrawals 
In the overall safety population (≥6-year age group), 8 subjects reported 9 SAEs during the study.  The 
incidence of SAEs reported in the 2 age groups was the same (2.0% each).  The most common category 
of SAEs was infections and infestations; SAEs were reported by 1.4% or fewer subjects after each dose.  
None were considered to be related to study vaccine as assessed by the investigator.  No subjects were 
withdrawn from the study for safety-related reasons. 
Other Significant Adverse Events 
There were 2 subjects who experienced AEs (one convulsion, one wheezing) that were considered to be 
of clinical importance/significant.  
The CHMP considered that the overall safety results are in agreement with the previously assessed study 
6115A1-3017 (II76) in HIV infected adults, although the rate of adverse events was higher in the 
previous study. The MAH conclusions regarding safety are endorsed.  
Study 6115A1-3003 (B1851022): recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) aged ≥2 years, who have not received a pneumococcal vaccine since HSCT; final study 
report. 
Local Reactions 
Most subjects in the overall safety population (age ≥2 years) experienced at least one local reaction after 
each 13vPnC dose.  A higher percentage of subjects experienced local reactions after dose 4 than after 
the other 3 doses.  The majority of local reactions after each dose were mild or moderate. 
Pain was the most frequently occurring local reaction after Doses 1 to 4 of 13vPnC.  Severe pain was 
reported after each dose: Dose 1, 5 subjects (3.0%); Dose 2, 6 subjects (4.6%); Dose 3, 5 subjects 
(4.3%); and Dose 4, 6 subjects (6.7%).  
Redness and swelling occurred less frequently after Doses 1 to 4. Severe local redness and swelling were 
reported infrequently, particularly after the first three 13vPnC doses (in only 1 or 2 subjects, ≤1.7%).  
After Dose 4, 5 subjects (5.6%) experienced severe redness and 4 subjects (4.5%) experienced severe 
swelling.  
Percentages of any local reaction were somewhat higher in the pediatric age subgroup than in the adult 
subgroup, with pain the most common local reaction in both age subgroups.  Redness and swelling were 
consistently more common in the pediatric age group than in the adult age group.  
Mean durations of local reactions were similar in both age groups and did not exceed 4.5 days after any 
dose. 
Systemic Events 
25 
 
Most subjects in the overall safety population (age ≥2 years) experienced systemic events after each 
13vPnC dose.  For the majority of events a higher percentage of subjects experienced systemic events 
after dose 4 than after the other 3 doses. 
In the overall safety population, the most frequently reported systemic events within 14 days after each 
dose of 13vPnC were fatigue, muscle pain, and headache, and these were reported somewhat more often 
after Dose 4.  In the pediatric and adult subgroups fatigue, muscle pain, and headache were also reported 
most often.  For the majority of systemic events after each dose there was no difference in frequencies 
between the age groups. 
The percentage of subjects age ≥2 years with fever ≥38.0°C after Dose 1, Dose 2, and Dose 3 of 13vPnC 
was low (6.7% to 9.9%) and increased at Dose 4 of 13vPnC (17.7%).  Fever ≥38.0°C was more frequent 
in the 2 to <18 year group (range 12.8% to 27.8% across doses) than in the ≥18 year age group (range 
4.3% to 15.4% across doses).  
Mean duration of systemic events were similar after each of the doses and did not exceed 7.2 days. The 
mean durations of systemic events were similar between subjects in the 2- to <18-year age group and 
subjects in the ≥18-year age group after each dose and did not exceed 9.1 days.

Adverse Events 
The percentage of subjects in the overall safety population (age ≥2 years) reporting any AE after Dose 1 
of 13vPnC to the Dose 3 blood draw was 85.4%.  Subjects in the 2- to <18-year age group and the 
≥18-year age group reported similar percentages of AEs (81.4% and 86.7%, respectively). 
Infections and infestations were the most frequently reported type of AE after each 13vPnC dose in the 
overall safety population (aged ≥2 years) and in the pediatric (aged 2 to <18 years) and adult (≥18 
years) subgroups.  In each age group related AEs were infrequent and were most often categorized as 
general disorders and administration site conditions after each 13vPnC dose and after the 23vPS dose. 
The percentage of subjects in the overall safety population (age ≥2 years) reporting any AE after Dose 4 
of 13vPnC to the Dose 4 blood draw was 42.2%.  Subjects in the 2- to <18-year age group and the 
≥18-year age group reported similar percentages of AEs (39.1% and 43.2%, respectively). 
In the overall safety population (age ≥2 years), the most frequently reported categories of AEs after 
Dose 4 of 13vPnC to the Dose 4 blood draw were infections and infestations (18.2%), general disorders 
and administration site conditions (11.5%), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (5.7%).  
In the 2- to <18-year age group, the most frequently reported categories of AEs were infections and 
infestations (17.4%), general disorders and administration site conditions (15.2%), and gastrointestinal 
disorders (8.7%) during the same time period.  In the ≥18-year age group, the most frequently reported 
categories of AEs after Dose 4 of 13vPnC to the Dose 4 blood draw were infections and infestations 
(18.5%), general disorders and administration site conditions (10.3%), and musculoskeletal and 
connective tissue disorders (5.5%). 
In the overall safety population (age ≥2 years), the percentage of subjects reporting any AE after 23vPS 
to the 23vPS blood draw was 52.2%.  Subjects in the 2- to <18-year age group had lower percentages of 
AEs than subjects in the ≥18-year age group (46.7% and 54.0%, respectively). 
The most frequently reported categories of AEs after 23vPS to the 23vPS blood draw in the overall safety 
population (age ≥2 years) were general disorders and administration site conditions (21.7%), infections 
and infestations (20.1%), and respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal disorders (6.0%).  In the 2- to 
<18-year age group, the most frequently reported categories of AEs were infections and infestations 
(26.7%), general disorders and administration site conditions (11.1%), and ear and labyrinth disorders 
(6.7%) during the same time period.  In the ≥18-year age group, the most frequently reported categories 
of AEs after 23vPS to the 23vPS blood draw were general disorders and administration site conditions 
(25.2%), infections and infestations (18.0%), and musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders 
(7.2%). 
Deaths 
There were 14 subjects who died during the study.  Of the 14 subjects who died, 2 subjects were in the 
2- to <18-year age group and 12 subjects were in the ≥18-year age group.  No deaths were related to 
study vaccines but were generally due to complications of the subject’s underlying disease. 
Serious Adverse Events, Related SAEs, AE Withdrawals 
The percentage of subjects in the overall safety population (age ≥2 years) reporting any SAE after Dose 1 
of 13vPnC to the Dose 3 blood draw was 23.5%.  Subjects in the 2- to <18-year age group and the 
≥18-year age group reported similar percentages of SAEs (20.3% and 24.5%, respectively).  The most 
frequently reported categories of SAEs after Dose 1 of 13vPnC to the Dose 3 blood draw were infections 
Page 30/42 
 
  
  
  
 
and infestations and benign, malignant, or unspecified neoplasms in the overall safety population (age 
≥2 years), as well as the 2- to <18-year age group and the ≥18-year age group. 
The percentage of subjects in the overall safety population (age ≥2 years) reporting any SAE after Dose 4 
of 13vPnC to the Dose 4 blood draw was 5.7%.  Subjects in the 2- to <18-year age group and the 
≥18-year age group reported similar percentages of SAEs (4.3% and 6.2%, respectively).  In the 2- to 
<18-year age group, SAEs reported during this time included H1N1 influenza (1 subject, 2.2%), and 
pneumonia (1 subject, 2.2%).  SAEs reported for the ≥18-year age group after Dose 4 of 13vPnC to the 
Dose 4 blood draw included influenza (1 subjects, 0.7%), osteonecrosis (1 subject, 0.7%), and 
staphylococcal sepsis (1 subject, 0.7%). 
In the overall safety population (age ≥2 years), the percentage of subjects reporting any SAE after 23vPS 
to the 23vPS blood draw was 6.0%.  Subjects in the 2- to <18-year age group (8.9%) reported a higher 
percentage of SAEs than the ≥18-year age group (5.0%).  In the 2- to <18-year age group, SAEs 
reported during this time included cellulitis (1 subject, 2.2%), device-related infection (1 subject, 2.2%), 
and varicella (1 subject, 2.2%).  SAEs reported for the ≥18-year age group after 23vPS to the 23vPS 
blood draw included graft-versus-host-disease in liver (2 subjects, 1.4%), Guillain-Barré syndrome 
(1 subject, 0.7%), and herpes zoster (1 subject, 0.7%). 
SAEs considered by the investigator to have a reasonable possible relationship to a study vaccine were 
reported in 5 subjects after receiving 13vPnC: 1 subject in the 2- to <18-year age group (injection site 
erythema and pyrexia); and 4 subjects in the ≥18-year age group (bilateral pneumonia due to possible 
pneumococcal infection (pneumococcal urine antigen positive), autoimmune hemolytic anemia, bilateral 
VIIth facial nerve paralysis, and Guillain-Barré syndrome).  
The SAE assessed by the investigator as possibly related to 23vPS was reported in a pediatric subject who 
experienced cellulitis 2 days after receiving study vaccine 23vPS. In addition, the SAE described above 
(Guillain-Barré syndrome) was assessed as possibly related to 13vPnC and 23vPS. 
Study 6096A1-3014 (B1851013): children and adolescents aged ≥6 to <18 years with SCD, 
previously immunized with 23vPS; 6-month safety addendum and 1-year final study report). 
Local reactions and systemic events were not collected during the study period covered in the 6-month 
safety addendum or the 1-year antibody persistence report.  Only SAEs or newly diagnosed chronic 
medical conditions were collected during the time period covered by these 2 reports.  
6-month Safety Addendum 
Overall, 63 AEs were reported for 29 subjects (19.7%).  The AEs reported by more than 1 subject were 
sickle cell anemia with crisis (17 subjects, 11.6%), acute chest syndrome (2 subjects, 1.4%), pain (2 
subjects, 1.4%), pyrexia (2 subjects, 1.4%), and pneumonia (2 subjects, 1.4%). 
Of the 63 AEs reported, 62 were considered SAEs and none were related to vaccination.  All SAEs 
resolved. 
The 1 non-serious AE was allergic rhinitis, a newly diagnosed chronic medical condition, reported by 1 
subject. 
1-year Antibody Persistence Report 
Overall, 38 AEs were reported for 17 subjects (19.5%).  The AEs reported by more than 1 subject were 
sickle cell anemia with crisis (11 subjects, 12.6%), pyrexia (3 subjects, 3.4%), and pneumonia (4 
subjects, 4.6%). 
Of the 38 AEs reported, 37 were considered SAEs and none were related to vaccination.  All SAEs 
resolved.   
Page 31/42 
  
  
  
 
The 1 non-serious AE was hiatus hernia, which was a newly diagnosed chronic medical condition reported 
by 1 subject.  While performing the quality review procedures for this report, it was observed that 2 newly 
diagnosed chronic medical conditions were incorrectly recorded during the 1-year follow-up period in the 
Visit 1 medical history page of the CRF and were therefore not captured in the adverse event tables of the 
1-year report.  These events are gastritis and avascular necrosis of the right hip. 
The CHMP noted that the safety data collected in the follow-up period did not give rise to further concern. 
No new safety signal was detected.  
2.3.2.  Discussion 
In HIV infected subjects, the overall safety results are in agreement with the previously assessed study 
6115A1-3017 (II76) in HIV infected adults, although the rate of adverse events was higher in the 
previous study. 
In HSCT recipients, the frequencies of local and systemic reactions were generally in agreement with 
previously reported rates. The number of SAEs in this study is higher than in studies in healthy subjects, 
as can be expected, considering that it is a more fragile population. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH 
submitted reviews of Guillain Barre syndrome, autoimmune haemolytic anemia, and bilateral VIIth facial 
nerve paralysis.  Given the complex constellation of comorbid conditions and concomitant medications in 
subjects who have undergone a HSCT, the CHMP concluded any potential causal relationship between 
Prevenar 13 and these events was difficult to establish.  Furthermore, since the cases were isolated cases 
or very little in number, relationship between Prevenar 13 and these events can’t be established. 
In Sickle cell disease, the safety data collected in the follow-up period did not give rise to further concern. 
No new safety signal was detected. 
2.4.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
The PRAC does not advise any changes to the current conditions of the Marketing Authorisation.  
Data have shown that vaccination with 13vPnC vaccine presents a positive benefit-risk balance in these 
populations which displayed similar frequencies of adverse events, except that headaches, vomiting, 
diarrhoea, pyrexia, fatigue, arthralgia, and myalgia were very common. However, the sample size of 
these three studies was quite low, with 303, 251, and 158 subjects assigned to receive study vaccine in, 
respectively, studies 6115A1-3002 (children and/or adults with HIV), 6115A1-3003 (children and/or 
adults with HSCT), and 6096A1-3014 (sickle cell disease). Such a sample size is not appropriate to 
identify uncommon and rare events that may happen after vaccination with 13vPnC vaccine, e.g. 
convulsion, hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode, or hypersensitivity reaction. Hence, the PRAC 
recommended the MAH to continue to monitor adverse events in high-risk populations in a separate 
discussion in next PSURs. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan: 
Page 32/42 
  
  
  
 
Safety concerns 
A summary of the important identified and potential safety concerns and safety concerns due to missing 
information in the 13vPnC clinical program are provided in Table 6. 
Table 6 
Ongoing Safety Concerns 
Important identified risks
a) Drug interaction: Increased fever rates when 13vPnC is 
co-administered Infanrix hexa 
b) Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity 
c) Convulsions/seizures  
d) Apnoea 
Important potential risks 
a) Drug interaction: neurological events of HHE and convulsions 
with co-administration of 13vPnC and Infanrix hexa.  
c) Lack of effect in subjects who are fully vaccinated. 
Important missing information 
a) Unanticipated safety signals (including the onset of rare events) 
not seen in clinical trials of 13vPnC (including wheezing). 
b) Effectiveness of 13vPnC  
c) Potential changes in the epidemiology of nonvaccine S 
pneumoniae serotypes that may occur.  
d) Safety and immunogenicity in high-risk populations.a 
    i) Pneumococcal vaccine naïve HIV-infected subjects. 
    ii) Subjects with allogeneic HSCT. 
e) Impact of 13vPnC on nasopharyngeal carriage (infants/children) 
f) Effect of antipyretics on immune response to vaccination 
(infants/children).b 
f) Safety of more than 1 dose of 13vPnC in adults administered >1

a. This safety concern has been addressed and will be removed from future versions of the RMP.  All 
primary CSRs are complete in these high-risk populations and SmPC Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 
have been or are being  updated with information based on results from these studies. These studies 
include studies 6096A1-4001 (premature infants, primay analysis complete; study ongoing to assess 
antibody persistance) and 6096A1-3014 (sickle cell disease, completed), and studies in children 
and/or adults with HIV (6115A1-3002 and 6115A1-3017, both completed) or with HSCT 
(6115A1-3003, completed).  
b. This safety concern has been addressed in study 6096A1-4027. Based on results of the study, it is 
no longer an important safety concern and will be removed from the list of ongoing safety concerns in 
future RMPs.

Safety Concerna 
a) Increased fever rates when 
coadministered with Infanrix hexa. 
Proposed Risk Minimization Activities (Routine and 
Additional) 
The SmPC revisions approved 22 November 2012 in 
procedure II/56 are as follows: 
Routine SmPC (Section 4.4) Special warnings and 
precautions for use 
When Prevenar 13 is administered concomitantly with 
Infanrix hexa (DTPa-HBV-IPV/Hib), the rates of febrile 
reactions are similar to those seen with concomitant 
administration of Prevenar (7-valent) and Infanrix hexa (see 
section 4.8). 
(Section 4.8) Undesirable effects 
In a clinical study in infants vaccinated at 2, 3, and 4 months 
of age, fever ≥ 38°C was reported at higher rates among 
infants who received Prevenar (7-valent) concomitantly with 
Infanrix hexa (28.3% to 42.3%) than in infants receiving 
Infanrix hexa alone (15.6% to 23.1%). After a booster dose 
at 12 to 15 months of age, the rate of fever ≥ 38°C was 
50.0% in infants who received Prevenar (7-valent) and 
Infanrix hexa at the same time as compared to 33.6% in 
infants receiving Infanrix hexa alone. These reactions were 
mostly moderate (less than or equal to 39 °C) and transient. 
b) Anaphylaxis/hypersensitivity 
c) Convulsions/seizures 
d) Apnoea 
These risks are communicated through the label (Sections 
4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC [all 3 safety concerns]; Section 15 
of the CDS [convulsions/seizures]; Sections 5 and 15.2 of 
the CDS [anaphylaxis/ hypersensitivity]; Section 6.1 of the 
CDS [apnea]) 
Safety Concerna 
Important Potential Risks 
a) Drug interaction: neurological events 
of HHE and convulsions with 
co-administration of 13vPnC and Infanrix 
hexa. 
(The post-approval observational safety study 6096A1-4002 
is being conducted in at least 43,000 children vaccinated 
with 13vPnC to monitor the safety profile of 13vPnC The 
study is designed to evaluate rates of all medically attended 
events in the hospital and emergency department settings 
and prespecified events in hospital, emergency department, 
and outpatient clinic settings. Anaphylaxis, hypersensitivity, 
seizures, convulsions, wheezing, and apnea events are 
included as prespecified endpoints in the study. Routine 
pharmacovigilance to monitor the safety profile of 13vPnC) 
Proposed Risk Minimization Activities (Routine and 
Additional) 
This risk is being communicated through the label (Sections 
4.4, 4.5 and 4.8 of the EU SmPC). The proposed text includes 
statements on spontaneous reports of convulsions (with or

Proposed Risk Minimization Activities (Routine and 
Additional) 
Routine: SmPC (section 4.4) Special warnings and 
precautions  
As with any vaccine, Prevenar 13 may not protect all 
individuals receiving the vaccine from pneumococcal 
disease. 
(Study 6115A1-3006, a large randomized placebo-controlled 
efficacy and safety study in approximately 85,000 adults ≥65 
years of age is being conducted. Efficacy of 13vPnC in the 
prevention of first episode of confirmed VT pneumococcal 
CAP and IPD will be assessed. CSR to be submitted June 
2014; additional reports to be submitted  by January 2015) 
Unanticipated safety signals (including the onset of rare 
events) are being monitored through routine 
pharmacovigilance (infants/children), including wheezing as 
part of the post-approval safety study (6096A1-4002). 
Study 6096A1-4002 is monitoring all medically attended 
events as measured by hospitalizations and emergency room 
visits, prespecified safety endpoints in the hospital and 
emergency room setting, and prespecified safety endpoints 
in the outpatient clinic setting following vaccination with 
13vPnC. Wheezing diagnoses are included as prespecified 
endpoints in the safety assessment.  
For the adult population, unanticipated safety signals 
(including the onset of rare events) is being monitored in 
study 6115A1-3006 (in approximately 85,000 subjects) and 
through routine phamacovigilance. 
SmPC (Section 5.1) and PIL language provides information 
on the efficacy and effectiveness of 7vPnC, the percentage of 
subjects vaccinated with 13vPnC that have immune 
responses above the WHO-recommended threshold for 
efficacy, and the non-inferiority of antibody responses to 
13vPnC relative to 7vPnC. 
In addition, a post-marketing observational study 
(6096A1-4005) to estimate the impact of 13vPnC on IPD 
caused by vaccine serotypes after introduction into routine 
pediatric use. 
Study 6115A1-3006, a large efficacy and safety study in 
approximately 85,000 adults ≥65 years of age is being 
conducted. Final report to be submitted June 2014,

d) Safety and immunogenicity in high risk 
populations: 
e) Impact of 13vPnC on nasopharyngeal

The same 5 European population-based surveillance systems 
for effectiveness evaluation will be used to monitor potential 
changes in non-13vPnC serotypes for 5 years after 13vPnC 
introduction. Final report to be submitted 2016. 
Note: This safety concern has been addressed and is no 
longer missing information or considered an important safety 
concern.  All studies/primary analyses are complete in these 
high-risk populations and the SmPC is being updated with 
information based on results from these studies: 
6096A1-4001 (preterm), 6096A1-3014 (SCD), 
6115A1-3017 (HIV adult), 6115A1-3002 (HIV 
children/adults), 6115A1-3003 (HSCT).  This will be 
removed from the list of important safety concerns. 
Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.8 and 5.1 of the SmPC, have been or are 
being updated to include additional information on dosing 
recommendations, differences in side effects observed and 
immunogenicity data from completed clinical studies of 
high-risk populations, including premature infants (primary 
analysis complete), children with sickle cell disease, children 
and adults with HIV or with HSCT who are naïve to a 
pneumococcal vaccine, and adults with HIV infection 
previously vaccinated with 23vPS. 
Section 5.1 of the SmPC includes information on the impact 
of Prevenar 13 on NPC in 2 pediatric studies, one conducted 
in France (ACTIV study) in children with AOM and the other in 
Israel. Both studies showed that Prevenar 13 reduced NPC of 
the 6 additional serotypes in 13vPnC combined plus serotype 
6C.  
Ongoing surveillance of nasopharyngeal carriage (NPC) in 
France through the ACTIV surveillance program comparing 
nasopharyngeal carriage of S pneumoniae and other key 
commensal bacteria among children 6 to 24 months of age 
with acute otitis media. Monitoring for replacement of S 
pneumoniae with non-pneumococcal bacteria in the 
nasopharyngeal flora of children will be conducted in the 
ACTIV study in France. 
f) Effect of antipyretics on immune 
response to vaccination 
(Infants/Children) 
Note: This has been addressed and is no longer an important 
safety concern., based on results of study 6096A1-4027 
which is now complete. This will be removed from the list of 
important safety concerns in future RMPs.

g) Safety of more than 1 dose of 13vPnC 
in adults administered at >1 year apart 
Proposed Risk Minimization Activities (Routine and 
Additional) 
The SmPC (section 4.4) mentions that the need for 
revaccination with a subsequent dose of Prevenar 13 has not 
been established in adults 50 years and older. 
One (1) ongoing clinical study (6115A1-3001) is evaluating 
the safety of a second dose of 13vPnC administered 5 years 
after the initial dose. 
(Study 6115A1-004 extension, which evaluated a second 
dose of 13vPnC 3 to 4 years after the initial dose is complete 
and the study report has been submitted.) 
h) Vaccine exposure in pregnancy and 
lactation 
Routine pharmacovigilence.  Vaccine exposure during 
pregnancy or lactation will be monitored through the 
National Pregnancy Registry. 
In addition, the SmPC (section 4.6) states: Fertility, 
pregnancy, and lactation 
There are no data from the use of pneumococcal 13-valent 
conjugate in pregnant women.  Animal studies do not 
indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with respect to 
reproductive toxicity.  
It is unknown whether pneumococcal 13-valent conjugate is 
excreted in human milk.

Applicable to both infants/children and adults, unless specified. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes. 
2.5.  Changes to the Product Information 
The  MAH  proposed  changes  to  the  Product  Information  (PI).  During  the  procedure,  the  CHMP 
requested further amendments to the PI as described in the Appendix 1. 
3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The final results from 2 additional studies in high-risk populations (6115A1-3002 and 6115A1-3003), and 
the 6-month follow-up safety and 1-year antibody persistence and safety data from study 6096A1-3014 
(i.e., no study vaccine administered at 1 year) are now available. The variation currently being submitted 
includes final study reports for these 3 studies:  
•  6115A1-3002 (B1851021): HIV-infected individuals aged ≥ 6 years, not previously immunized 
with a pneumococcal vaccine; final study report. 
•  6115A1-3003 (B1851022): recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) 
aged ≥ 2 years, who have not received a pneumococcal vaccine since HSCT; final study report. 
•  6096A1-3014 (B1851013): children and adolescents aged ≥ 6 to <18 years with SCD, previously 
immunized with 23vPS; 6-month safety addendum and 1-year final study report).

These studies are submitted in accordance with Article 46 of the Paediatric Regulation (EC) No 
1901/2006. Additionally, study 6115A1-3002 is a post-authorisation commitment to the European Union 
Marketing Authorisation (MEA 013). MEA 013 is fulfilled with the present application. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the study results provided valuable data on risk groups for 
pneumococcal infections. 
HIV-infected children and adults with CD4 ≥  200 cells/µL (mean 717.0 cells/μL), viral load < 50,000 
copies/mL (mean 2090.0 copies/mL), free of active AIDS-related illness and not previously vaccinated 
with a pneumococcal vaccine received 3 doses of Prevenar 13. As per general recommendations, a single 
dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was subsequently administered. Vaccines were 
administered at 1 month intervals. Immune responses were assessed in 259-270 evaluable subjects 
approximately 1 month after each dose of vaccine. After the first dose, Prevenar 13 elicited antibody 
levels, measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs that were statistically significantly higher when 
compared to levels prior to vaccination. After the second and third dose of Prevenar 13, immune 
responses were similar or higher than those after the first dose. 
The CHMP was of the opinion that the data in HIV infected subjects were generally in agreement with 
previously presented data, and the benefit of vaccination is considered clearly demonstrated in this 
group. The safety data from this study did not give rise to further safety concern, and no new safety signal 
was detected.  
Children and adults with an allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) at ≥ 2 years of age 
with complete haematologic remission of underlying disease or with very good partial remission in the 
case of lymphoma and myeloma received three doses of Prevenar 13 with an interval of at least 1 month 
between doses. The first dose was administered at 3 to 6 months after HSCT. A fourth (booster) dose of 
Prevenar 13 was administered 6 months after the third dose. As per general recommendations, a single 
dose of 23-valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine was administered 1 month after the fourth dose 
of Prevenar 13. Immune responses as measured by IgG GMCs were assessed in 168-211 evaluable 
subjects approximately 1 month after vaccination. Prevenar 13 elicited increased antibody levels after 
each dose of Prevenar 13. Immune responses after the fourth dose of Prevenar 13 were significantly 
increased for all serotypes compared with after the third dose. Functional antibody titers (OPA titers) were 
not measured in this study. 
In the HSCT recipient population, the immune responses were considered adequate by the CHMP, 
although OPA results are lacking. The presented data support an overall benefit of vaccination in HSCT 
recipients. The occurrence of some SAEs was addressed in the RSI, and it was concluded that no specific 
concern was raised due to the results. The data from study 6115A1-3003 support a schedule of four doses 
of 13vPnC, beginning early after HSCT when risk of infection is highest. The primary series consists of 
three doses, with the first dose given at 3 to 6 months after HSCT and with an interval of at least 1 month 
between doses. A fourth (booster) dose is recommended 6 months after the third dose. The proposed 
dosing schedule was considered adequate by the CHMP. 
An open label single arm study in France, Italy, UK, US, Lebanon, Egypt and Saudi Arabia with 2 doses of 
Prevenar 13 given 6 months apart was conducted in 158 children and adolescents ≥  6 to < 18 years of 
age with sickle cell disease who were previously vaccinated with one or more doses of 23-valent 
pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine at least 6 months prior to enrolment. After the first vaccination, 
Prevenar 13 elicited antibody levels measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs that were statistically 
significantly higher when compared to levels prior to vaccination. After the second dose immune 
responses were comparable to those after the first dose. One year after the second dose, antibody levels 
measured by both IgG GMCs and OPA GMTs were higher than levels prior to the first dose of Prevenar 13, 
except for the IgG GMCs for serotypes 3 and 5 that were numerically similar.

In Sickle cell disease subjects, the immune responses 1 month after the second dose were assessed in 
variation II/76. With the present submission, the GMCs at 1 year after dose 2 were generally higher 
compared to the pre-vaccination levels, but for serotypes 1, 3 and 5 the 95% CI were overlapping. The 
OPA responses were in agreement with the IgG responses, but the 95% CIs were not overlapping for any 
serotypes. The CHMP concluded that the final data from the study in sickle cell disease patients confirm 
the preliminary data submitted with variation II/76. 
In addition, the CHMP recommended that the MAH should continue to monitor adverse events in high-risk 
populations in a separate discussion in next PSURs. 
The benefit / risk balance for Prevenar 13 remains positive.

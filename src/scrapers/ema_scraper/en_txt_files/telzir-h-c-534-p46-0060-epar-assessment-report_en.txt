EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
In  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  the  applicant  has  submitted  the  final 
study  report  (week  168)  for  paediatric  study  APV20003.  This  study  explored  the  use  of 
Fosamprenavir/Ritonavir once daily in paediatric patients aged 2 to 18 years. 
Since  the  once-daily  regimen  of  Telzir  is  not  approved  in  UE  and  since  the  applicant  is  not  willing  to 
seek authorisation for such a regimen, the data derived from study APV20003 are regarded as simply 
informative. 
Of note, the 48-week study report of study APV20003 was already assessed by the CHMP in the setting 
of the Telzir II18 variation. 
II. 
RECOMMENDATION 
Based on the submitted data, no further regulatory action is required. 
This procedure is considered fulfilled. 
III. 
INTRODUCTION 
The  MAH  has  submitted  the  final  paediatric  study  report  of  study  APV20003  for  Telzir 
(fosamprenavir),  in  accordance  with  Article  46  of  Regulation  (EC)  No1901/2006,  as  amended,  on 
medicinal products for paediatric use. The study has not been conducted in accordance with an agreed 
paediatric investigation plan. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the submitted paediatric study do(es) not influence the benefit risk for Telzir and 
that there is no consequential regulatory action. 
Telzir in combination with low dose ritonavir is indicated for the treatment of Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus Type 1 (HIV-1) infected adults, adolescents and children of 6 years and above in combination 
with other antiretroviral medicinal products. 
Telzir  oral  suspension  is  the  recommended  option  for  the  most  accurate  dosing  in  children  based  on 
body weight. 
In paediatric patients, the oral suspension should be taken with food in order to aid palatability and 
assist compliance. 
The recommended dose is 18 mg/kg of fosamprenavir (0.36 ml/kg) twice daily [maximum of 700 
mg or 14 ml] together with 3 mg/kg of ritonavir twice daily. 
The  adult  dose  of  Telzir  tablet  700  mg  twice  daily  with  ritonavir  100  mg  twice  daily  may  be  used  in 
children weighing at least 39 kg and able to swallow tablets. 
Study APV20003 was aimed to explore the FPV/RTV once daily regimen in paediatric patients aged 2 to 
18  years.  The  FPV/RTV  QD  regimen  is  currently  not  approved  in  the  UE  and  the  applicant  does  not 
intend  to  seek  authorisation  for  a  QD  regimen  of  FPV/RTV.  Therefore,  the  data  derived  from  study 
APV20003 are regarded as simply informative. Moreover, the 48-week results of study APV20003 were 
already  assessed  by the  CHMP  in  the  setting  of  Telzir  II18  variation  for the  extension of  indication  of 
Telzir to paediatric patients.

As a reminder, to support the extension of indication of Telzir to paediatric patients (Telzir II18), the 
applicant submitted the reports for two ongoing studies: 
Study APV29005 (which was regarded as pivotal) evaluating the FPV BID regimen in PI-naïve patients 
aged 2 to <6 years old and the FPV/RTV BID regimen in PI-naïve and PI-experienced patients 2 to 
18 years old. The report for week 24 data was submitted. 
Study  APV20003  (which  was  regarded  as  supportive)  evaluating  the  FPV/RTV  QD  regimens  in  PI-
naïve and PI-experienced patients aged 2 to 18 years old. After a protocol amendment, PI-experienced 
patients  were  allowed  to  switch  to  a  FPV/RTV  BID  regimen.  The  report  for  week  48  data  was 
submitted. 
In  both  studies  APV29005  and  APV20003,  subjects  that  successfully  completed  48  weeks  of  therapy 
will continue to receive FPV until approved for use in paediatrics and local supplies are available. 
Moreover,  the  safety,  tolerability,  pharmacokinetics,  and  antiviral  activity  of  FPV  ±  RTV  dosing  in 
paediatric subjects 6 weeks to <2 years of age is being studied in protocol APV20002. 
Whereas the final study report for study APV20003 has just been submitted, the final study report for 
studies APV290005 and APV20002 are planned to be submitted by Q1 2014 (see table below). 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
Whereas the 24-week report for study APV290005 was submitted by Q4 2006, the 48-week final study 
report is only planned to be submitted by Q1 2014. The Rapporteur would like the applicant to discuss 
the reasons for such a long period between both submissions.

Study 
objectives 
Primary 
•  To  evaluate  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  FPV/RTV  given  once  daily  in 
combination with NRTI therapy for 48 weeks in HIV-1 infected, antiretroviral therapy 
(ART)-naïve and experienced, paediatric subjects 2 to ≤ 18 years of age 
•  To  characterize  plasma  APV  PK  following  administration  of  FPV/RTV  once 
daily and twice daily to paediatric subjects 2 to ≤ 18 years of age 
Secondary 
• To assess whether FPV has systemic exposure when administered to HIV-1 infected 
paediatric subjects 2 to ≤18 years of age 
• To characterize plasma RTV PK following administration of FPV/RTV once daily and 
BID to pediatric subjects 2 to ≤18 years of age 
• To investigate the relationship of plasma APV PK to changes in plasma HIV-1 RNA 
concentrations, CD4+ cell counts and to the occurrence of adverse events (Aes) 
•  To  assess  viral  resistance  patterns  and  to  compare  these  patterns  with  treatment 
outcome 
• To assess subject adherence, shaking of FPV oral suspension, and parent/guardian 
perceptions of study medications 
•  To  evaluate  the  antiviral  activity  and  immunologic  activity  of  FPV/RTV 
administered once daily in combination with NRTI therapy for 48 weeks in  HIV-1 
infected, ART-naïve and experienced, paediatric subjects 2 to ≤ 18 years of age 
•  To  evaluate  the  safety,  tolerability,  antiviral  activity,  immunologic  response  and 
adherence  of  subjects  who  switch  to  a  FPV/RTV  BID  regimen  after  initially 
receiving a FPV/RTV QD regimen 
Study subjects  Subjects  were  either  ART-naïve  or  ART-experienced,  aged  2  to  ≤  18  years  with 
screening HIV-1 RNA ≥ 400 copies/mL. 
Number of 
subjects 
A  total  of  69  subjects  were  enrolled  and  received  FPV/RTV  once  daily,  10  of  whom 
switched to receive FPV/RTV on a BID basis during the study. 
Study design 
Subjects were assigned to a cohort based on age. Once enrolment in cohorts 1, 2 or 
3 was complete, further subjects in that age range were to enrol in Cohort 4.

Study drug 
administration 
Subjects  were  given  FPV  and  RTV  as  investigational  products  to  be  used  with  a 
background  regimen  of  two  active  NRTIs.  FPV  was  administered  as  either  oral  700

and dosing 
mg tablets or 50 mg/mL oral suspension. RTV was given as either 100 mg capsules 
or as 80 mg/mL oral solution. 
The  FPV  oral  suspension  and  RTV  oral  solution  were  recommended  to  be 
administered with food to improve tolerability by masking taste. 
ART-naïve or ART-experienced paediatric subjects, 2 to ≤18 years of age (Cohorts 1, 
2 and 3), began multiple dosing with FPV 30mg/kg + RTV 6mg/kg QD on Day 1, 
had  a  Week  4  PK  profile  over  24  hours  (at  0,  1,  2,  4,  8,  12,  and  24  hours  post 
dosing) and had additional PK trough sampling at Weeks 8, 12, 24 and 48. 
The plasma PK samples collected on Week 4 were analysed for APV concentrations to 
confirm target plasma APV exposure was achieved.  
Based on the Week 4 plasma APV PK data from at least 6 subjects who receive the 
FPV oral suspension, the dose of the FPV oral suspension was to be adjusted for all 
subjects in the cohort. 
Subjects in Cohort 4 did not provide a PK profile at Week 4 but underwent PK trough 
sampling at Weeks 4, 8, 12, 24 and 48. 
The  pivotal  adult  clinical  trial  APV30003,  where  both  FPV/RTV  QD  and  BID  were 
evaluated  in  PI-experienced  patients,  demonstrated  that  FPV/RTV  BID  had  similar 
efficacy to LPV/RTV BID whereas there was a lower rate of antiviral activity with the 
once  daily  regimen.  Subsequently,  the  protocol  of  study  APV20003  was 
amended  to  allow  PI-experienced  subjects  to  switch  from  an  FPV/RTV  QD 
regimen  to  an  FPV/RTV  BID  regimen.  Additionally,  further  enrollment  in  the 
study was limited to PI-naïve subjects. 
The FPV/RTV BID regimens implemented were based on preliminary plasma APV PK 
data available for the FPV/RTV QD regimens in these paediatric subjects: 
-  Because  plasma  APV  exposures  achieved  in  6  to  18  year  old  subjects  receiving 
the  FPV/RTV  30/6mg/kg  QD  regimen  appeared  to  be  similar  to  historical  adult 
data  for  FPV/RTV  1400/200mg  QD,  an  FPV/RTV  15/3mg/kg  BID  regimen 
was implemented for subjects 6 to 18 years of age. 
-  Because plasma APV exposures achieved in 2 to 5 year old subjects receiving the 
FPV/RTV  30/6mg/kg  QD  regimen  appeared  to  be  approximately  25%  lower 
compared  to  historical  adult  data  for  FPV/RTV  1400/200mg  QD,  an  FPV/RTV 
20/4mg/kg  BID  regimen  was  implemented  for  subjects  2  to  5  years  of 
age. 
-  Subjects receiving FPV/RTV 1400/200mg QD were switched to the standard adult 
dosage regimen of FPV/RTV 700/100mg BID. 
For endpoints using continuous viral load and CD4+ cell count data, the ‘observed’ 
analysis was used in which all non-missing data up to a visit was used to calculate 
the summary data for that particular visit. This method was used for the analysis of 
changes from baseline. 
For  proportions,  endpoint  using  viral  load  data  a  time  to  loss  of  virologic  response 
(TLOVR) analysis was used. For this analysis, positive responders were those who 
had a confirmed plasma HIV-1 RNA response <400 copies/mL below baseline prior to 
the visit of interest, but without having experienced treatment failure. 
Treatment  failure  was  defined  as  the  first  of  the  following  events:  confirmed 
plasma HIV-1 RNA above 400 copies/mL, permanent discontinuation of study drug or 
death. 
Only descriptive summaries of antiviral efficacy data were produced and no statistical 
testing was performed. 
Efficacy 
analyses 
PK analyses 
Plasma APV PK parameter including Cmax, t max, AUC(0-τ), Cavg (=AUC(0-τ)/τ) CL/F, 
t1/2 were calculated using non-compartmental methods. 
Sample size 
No power calculations were performed in order to derive the total sample size. 
Recruitment  of  62  subjects  was  considered  an  appropriate  number,  balancing 
recruitment  of  sufficient  subjects  to  obtain  robust  information  on  the  safety  and 
CHMP assessment report for paediatric use studies submitted according to Article 46 of 
the Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

tolerability following administration of FPV/RTV once daily. Of these 62 subjects, 38 
were  planned  to  enrol  in  Cohorts  1,  2,  and  3  and  have  a  PK  profile  at  Week  4  in 
order to obtain full PK profiles from 26 evaluable subjects. Based on plasma APV PK 
data  from  previous  FPV  studies,  the  highest  variability  was  observed  for  the  FPV 
suspension  formulation  in  APV10008,  where  the  inter-subject  standard  deviation 
(SD)  of  loge(AUC)  was  0.42.  Assuming  this  inter-subject  SD,  based  on  a  two-side 
procedure with α=0.5 on log scale, and a sample size of 26 subjects, the width of the 
95%  confidence  interval  (CI)  for  plasma  APV  area  under  the  concentration  versus 
time  curve  during  a  dosing  interval  (AUC(0-τ))  would  be  34%  around  the  point 
estimate (geometric mean). 
Results 
Study population 
Disposition of subjects 
A total of 69 subjects were enrolled and received FPV/RTV once daily. Among them, 32 were PI-naïve 
and 37 were PI-experienced. 
Of importance, 10 patients switched to receive FPV/RTV BID, after the protocol amendment. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
Fifty-three  (77%)  subjects  discontinued  study  drug  prematurely.  The  applicant  underlined  that  this 
relatively  high  discontinuation  rate  could  be  related  to  the  extended  duration  of  the  study  (through 
Week 168). However, a high rate of discontinuation was already observed by Week 48 (43%). Overall, 
the high rate of discontinuation observed in this trial will impair the interpretation of data. 
Demographic and other baseline characteristics 
Among  the  69  patients  enrolled  57%  were  female  and  43%  were  male;  51%  were  White/Caucasian, 
35% were Black and 12% were American Hispanic.

30/69  patients  (43%)  were  non  or  mildly  symptomatic  according  CDC  classification.  5  (7%)  patients 
was Hepatitis B positive and 1 patient was Hepatitis C positive. The mode of contamination was mostly 
by vertical transmission (81%).

Of  note,  baseline  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  levels,  median  CD4+  cell  counts  and  CD4+  percentages  were 
similar among PI-naïve and PI-experienced groups. 
Previous medications 
78% (54/69) of patients were ART-experienced, whereas 22% (15/69) of patients were ART-naïve.  
The PI-experienced enrolled population had a higher number of prior NRTIs and NNRTIs exposures. 
59% of PI experienced patients have previously received 1 PI, 30% have received 2 PIs and only 11% 
were pre-treated with 3 PIs. 
The  most  commonly  previously  administered  PIs  were  nelfinavir  (59%),  ritonavir  (41%),  indinavir 
(27%) and lopinavir/ritonavir (11%). 
NRTI initial combinations 
Per  protocol,  all  ART-naïve  subjects  were  to  receive  the  abacavir/lamivudine  NRTI  combination  and 
ART-experienced  subjects  were  to  optimize  their  background  NRTIs  based  on  screening  resistance 
results.

Rapporteur’s comment: 
The rate of responders is quite low in this population of paediatric patients receiving the QD regimen of 
FPV/RTV. 
The major reason for virologic failure in the PI-naïve and PI-experienced study population was due to a 
plasma HIV-1 rebound.

Rapporteur’s comment: 
Apparently, there should be a mistake in the table for the PI-experienced patients with 8/37 of patients 
with VL<50 cp/mL whereas 7/37 of patients had VL<400 cp/mL in table 21.

Subgroup analyses 
Antiviral response by age 
The  response  rates  varied  across  the  groups  by  age  and  by  PI  experience  (see  table  below).  When 
considering  antiviral  response  by  age  and  the  cohort  sample  sizes,  the  differences  in  baseline 
resistance  profile  and  treatment  experience  should  be  taken  into  account  as  previously  explored  in 
Week 48 analysis report for APV20003. Indeed, a greater proportion of subjects in the 12 to 18 
year  group  had  >3  reverse  transcriptase  (RT)  mutations  (43%)  when  compared  to  the  other 
cohorts (23% and 13% for 2 to 5 and 6 to 11 year age groups, respectively). 
The 2 to 5 years of age group consistently demonstrates the greatest response to FPV/RTV regimen.

Rapporteur’s comment: 
This trend of a lower rate of responders in the older children was already underlined by the Rapporteur 
during  the  assessment  of  the  48-week  data  and  was  related  to  the  accumulation  of  resistance  with 
longer treatment exposure. 
Antiviral response by gender and by race 
No apparent differences in antiviral response for race or gender were observed, although the number 
of subjects in each subgroup was small. 
Safety results 
Treatment emergent AEs 
Adverse Events Regardless of Causality 
Ninety-six percent (66/69) of subjects reported at least one AE. The most common AEs were vomiting 
(41%), diarrhea (26%), headache (26%), upper respiratory tract infection (25%), nausea (23%), and 
cough (23%). 
There were no apparent differences in overall AE frequency for age group, gender or race at entry. 
This  overall  AE  pattern  is  similar  to  that  reported  in  the  Week  48  report  (cut-off  date  16  February 
2005). 
Rash was reported in 23% of subjects, and described under a variety of terms. The majority of these 
treatment emergent rash AEs were of Grade 1 intensity. 
Treatment Emergent Adverse Events Attributable to Study Drug 
Fifty-seven percent (57%, 39/69) of subjects reported at least one drug-related AE. The most common 
drug-related  AEs  reported  were  vomiting  (26%,  18/69),  nausea  (20%,  14/69),  and  diarrhea  (12%, 
8/69). 
Subjects in the 6 to 11 year old age group reported fewer drug-related AEs (29%, 5/17) than subjects 
in  the  2  to  5  year  old  (71%,  12/17)  or  12  to  18  year  old  (63%,  22/35)  age  groups,  although  the 
numbers in each group are small. This is a similar pattern to that described in the Week 48 report. 
Serious AEs 
There were no fatal events reported in this study. 
SAEs occurring in more than one subject were drug hypersensitivity (4%, 3/69), measles (3%, 2/69) 
and pyrexia (3%, 2/69). 
Four  of  the  SAEs  were  considered  by  the  investigator  to  be  drug-related  comprising  blood  alkaline 
phosphatase increased, Benign salivary gland neoplasm, hemoptysis and hyperglycemia.

AEs leading to discontinuation 
Twelve subjects (17%, 12/69) (2 to 5 years: n=3; 6 to 11 years: n=2, 12 to 18 years: n=7) reported 
an AE leading to permanent discontinuation of study drug and withdrawal from the study. Of these 12, 
two are new withdrawals since the Week 48 report. Events included vomiting (3), nausea (3), stomach 
discomfort  (1),  hyperglycemia  (1),  hypertriglyceridemia  (1),  Hodgkin's  disease  (1),  elevated  blood 
alkaline phosphatase (1), elevated eosinophil count (1) and hemoptysis (1). 
Clinical laboratory evaluations 
Overall, the incidence of treatment-emergent Grade 3-4 clinical chemistry laboratory abnormalities was 
low (9%, 6/66), and represented increases in liver transaminases and triglycerides 
Overall,  there  were  median  increases  in  triglycerides,  total  cholesterol,  HDL  and  LDL  through  Week 
168. Of these parameters, only one subject experienced a Grade 3 laboratory abnormality of elevated 
triglycerides. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
No new safety signals have emerged since the Week 48 report 
Pharmacokinetic results 
The  PK  results  were  assessed  in  the  setting  of  Telzir  II-18  variation  and  will  not  be  detailed  in  the 
present report. 
In the Telzir II-18 AR, it was concluded that: 
-  When  children  2-12  years  old  were  treated  with  30/6  mg/kg  FPV/RTV  QD,  underdosing  of 
approximately 30% occurred. 
-  For  adolescents  treated  with  1400/200  mg  single  tablet  dose,  similar  AUCs  were  achieved  as  the 
adult reference population but Ctrough were 30% lower than in adults (the sample size was limited to 
3 patients). 
Viral genotyping and phenotyping results 
Post-Week 48 genotypes are available for twelve subjects and post-Week 48 phenotypes are available 
for eleven subjects. 
Mutations in Reverse Transcriptase 
Twelve subjects have genotypes post-Week 48 available. 
Of these 12 subjects, three have post-Week 48 RT genotypes identical to what was observed at Week 
48.

Eleven subjects have APV phenotypes post-Week 48 available. 
Of these eleven subjects, only subjects and had APV FC above the clinical cut-off for APV (cut-off FC = 
4). 
Subject  had  primary  PRO  resistance  mutations  I54L  and  L33F;  Subject  had  primary  PRO  resistance 
mutations I54L, I84V, L33F and V32I. Neither subject was PI-experienced prior to entering the study 
and these mutations were not present in either subject at Day 1. 
Relationship of genotypic and phenotypic results to virologic response 
Eight  of  the  12  subjects  had  NRTI  associated  resistance  mutations  post  Week  48  and  all  twelve 
subjects  had  PRO  mutations  post  Week  48.  Two  of  these  12  subjects  never  achieved  virologic 
suppression  by  Week  48; the  remaining  subjects  exhibited  plasma  HIV-1  RNA  rebound.  Change  from 
baseline varied from +0.09 (Subject at Week 204) to -2.48 (subject at Week 60) log10 copies/mL HIV-
1 RNA. 
Of  the  eleven  subjects  with  APV  phenotypes  post  Week  48,  only  subjects  and  had  APV  FC  above  the 
clinical cut-off for APV. Subject had APV FC and d4T FC above the cut-off at week 96. This subject had 
3.96 log10 copies/mL HIV-1 RNA at Week 96 (-1.02 log10 copies/mL change from baseline). Subject 
had  APV,  ABC,  3TC,  ddI  and  d4T  FCs  above  the  cut-offs  for  each  individual  drug  at  Week  252.  This 
subject  had  3.46  log10  copies/mL  HIV-1  RNA  at  Week  252  (-1.12  log10  copies/mL  change  from 
baseline). 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
There is no relevant finding regarding the emergence of genotypic/phenotypic resistance. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
The  applicant  discussed  the  results  from  study  APV20003  in  view  of  those  derived  from  other 
paediatric studies. 
Twice  daily  LPV/RTV  fixed  dose  combination  liquid  formulation  was  examined  in  100  ART-naïve  and 
experienced  subjects  (aged  6  months  to  12  years)  in  combination  with  2  NRTIs.  At  Week  48,  84% 
(37/44) of the ART naïve subjects and 75% (42/56) of ART-experienced subjects had HIV-1 RNA <400 
copies/mL (ITT M=F) with a response rate of 58% in the 24 PI-experienced children [Saez-Llorens et 
al, Pediatric Infect Dis J 2003; 22:216-23.]. 
The poor performance of FPV/RTV in this study over 168 Weeks may be partially attributable to the up 
front  use  of  FPV/RTV  once  daily  in  this  population,  as  this  regimen  has  been  shown  to  be  inferior  to 
LPV/RTV in treatment experienced adults in APV30003. Of note, higher treatment response rates were 
seen when FPV/RTV was given twice daily in APV29005: 70% (19/27) of PI-naïve and 57% (17/30) of 
PI-experienced subjects were responders by TLOVR (<400 copies/mL) through 24 Weeks in that study. 
Given the higher antiviral response rates seen with FPV/RTV in APV29005, FPV/RTV given twice daily is 
currently recommended for children aged 6 and above. 
Rapporteur’s comment: 
As previously observed in adult patients, the once daily regimen of FPV/RTV is not optimal to achieve 
virologic suppression in paediatric patients. 
V. 
RAPPORTEUR’S OVERALL CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
Telzir in combination with low dose ritonavir is currently indicated children from  6 years of age as 
a BID regimen as for adult patients.  
Study APV20003 was aimed to explore the FPV/RTV once daily regimen in paediatric patients aged 2 
to 18 years. The FPV/RTV QD regimen is currently not approved in the UE and the applicant does not 
intend  to  seek  authorisation  for  a  QD  regimen  of  FPV/RTV.  Therefore,  the  data  derived  from  study 
APV20003 are regarded as simply informative. 
The  48-week  results  of  study  APV20003  were  already  assessed  by  the  CHMP  in  the  setting  of  Telzir 
II18  variation  for  the  extension  of  indication  of  Telzir  to  paediatric  patients  and  the  168-week  data 
currently submitted did not reveal any new relevant finding as regards efficacy or safety.

As a matter of fact, the results of this study were hampered by a very high rate of discontinuation 
(77%).  Overall,  this  study  in  paediatric  patients  to  some  extent  reinforces  the  previous  assertion 
derived  from  adult  patients  that  the  once  daily  regimen  of  fosamprenavir/ritonavir  is  not  optimal  to 
achieve virologic suppression. 
Additional  data  on  the  use  of  FPV/RTV  in  paediatric  patients  are  awaited  from  studies  APV20002  (for 
patients aged 6 weeks to <2 years of age) and APV29005 (for patients aged 2 to 18 years). 
In  this  setting,  the  Rapporteur  would  like  to  be  updated  by  the  applicant  on  the  planned  dates  of 
submission  for  these  both  studies.  Indeed,  whereas  the  24-week  report  for  study  APV290005 
was submitted by Q4 2006, the 48-week final study report is only planned to be submitted 
by Q1 2014. The Rapporteur would like the applicant to discuss the reasons for such a long 
period between both submissions. All the more that additional data for paediatric patients derived 
from both studies are awaited for 31 December 2009 according to the letter of undertakings dated 19 
July 2007. 
The applicant could provide his response to this request by a separate letter.  
This procedure is considered as fulfilled. 
  Recommendation  
No further action required.

SmPC and PL 
Based on a review of literature and a search in the global 
worksharing procedure according to Article 20 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
This was an application for a group of variations 
following a worksharing procedure according to 
Article 20 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008. Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to 
include a warning on psychogenic syncope based on 
the available safety data. The PL was proposed to be 
updated in accordance. In addition, the company 
took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the PL of Pumarix, Ambirix, 
Pandemrix, Pandemic influenza vaccine (H5N1) (split 
virion, inactivated, adjuvanted) GlaxoSmithKline 
Biologicals, Prepandrix and Fendrix.

n/a 
- Minor changes to an approved test procedure 
safety database performed by the MAH, the CHMP 
recommended including a wording on psychogenic syncope 
to the product information of the MAH injectable vaccines. 
The literature review showed an incidence peak occurred 
around the age of 15 years, with females having more than 
twice the incidence of males. The syncope reports with 
secondary injuries were reported most frequently in 
children and adolescents.  
Given that psychogenic syncope is not a true side effect, it 
was not considered appropriate to include syncope as an 
undesirable effect in section 4.8 of the SmPC. However, as 
such events can result in injury, and may not have 
occurred in the absence of the vaccination, the CHMP 
recommended to add a reference to such events in section 
4.4 ‘Warning and Precaution’ of the SmPC and in the PL.

Following clusters of spontaneous reports of immediate 
Update of section 4.8 of the SmPC to include 
immediate injection site pain, stinging and burning 
sensation. The PL is updated in accordance. The MAH 
has also taken the opportunity to align section 4.6 of 
the prefilled syringe presentation with the vial 
presentation. Furthermore, the Labelling is updated 
to specify the container ‘prefilled syringe’. In 
addition, the MAH has taken the opportunity to 
update the list of local representatives in the PL.

onset injection site pain reported in certain batches of the 
preservative-free formulation of Twinrix Adult, immediate 
pain, stinging and burning at the injection site has been 
reflected in section 4.8 of the SmPC and section 4 of the 
package leaflet. The MAH’s investigation report revealed no 
specific root cause for the clusters of reports of immediate 
injection site pain. The injection site reactions were non-
serious and self-limited in all cases. The benefit-risk of 
Twinrix Adult remains positive.

C.I.4 - Update of section 5.1 of the SmPC in order to include the 52 weeks results from study A2311; a 
multicentre, randomised, open-label study in paediatric patients aged 6 years to less than 18 years with 
moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0352/2017 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0352/2017 was completed.  
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0352/2017. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The  24-week  Clinical  Study  Report  (CSR)  for  Study  CAIN457A2311  was  submitted  as  part  of  the 
Cosentyx  (secukinumab)  Paediatric  Plaque  Psoriasis  extension  of  indication  variation  (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0057), for which the EU Commission Decision was issued on 31 July 2020. During 
this procedure, the CHMP requested that the Week 24 data in Section 5.1 of the SmPC should be replaced 
with  Week  52  data  when  it  becomes  available.  The  Week  52  CSR  from  Study  CAIN457A2311  was 
submitted with this application in compliance with the CHMP’s request. 
The CHMP concluded that the updated Week 52 data are consistent with the previously assessed Week 
24 data and confirm adequate maintenance of effect. No new safety findings impacting the previously 
known risk profile are identified. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH agreed to implement minor adjustments 
into  its  initially  proposed  SmPC  wording.  Subsequent  to  these  changes,  the  Product  Information  is 
considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
The benefit-risk balance of Cosentyx remains positive.

5.  Introduction 
Secukinumab  is  a  fully  human  immunoglobulin  G1  (IgG1)  antibody  that  selectively  binds  to  and 
neutralises the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin-17A (IL-17A). Secukinumab works by targeting IL-
17A  and  inhibiting  its  interaction  with  the  IL-17  receptor,  which  is  expressed  on  various  cell  types 
including  keratinocytes  and  synoviocytes.  As  a  result,  secukinumab  inhibits  the  release  of 
proinflammatory cytokines, chemokines and mediators of tissue damage and reduces IL-17A-mediated 
contributions to autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, including psoriasis. 
Cosentyx was initially authorised in the EU on 15 Jan 2015 for the treatment of plaque psoriasis (PsO) 
in  adult  patients  (procedure  EMEA/H/C/003729),  and  indications  for  psoriatic  arthritis  (PsA)  and 
ankylosing  spondylitis  (AS)  in  adult  patients  were  authorised  on  19  Nov  2015  (procedures 
EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0001/G and EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0002, respectively). Extensions of indication for 
non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA;  procedure EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0053/G) and PsO 
in  children  and  adolescents  from  the  age  of  6  years  (procedure  EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0057)  were 
authorised on 28 Apr 2020 and 31 Jul 2020, respectively. 
A 24-week Clinical Study Report (CSR) for Study CAIN457A2311 (Study A2311) was part of the data 
provided  in  support  of  the  extension  of  indication  variation  for  paediatric  PsO  (procedure 
EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0057). During this procedure, in reference to the description of this study in the 
SmPC,  the  CHMP  requested  that  the  Week  24  data  should  be  replaced  with  Week  52  data  when  it 
becomes  available.  The  current  submission  addresses  the  CHMP  request  by  proposing  corresponding 
updates into Section 5.1 of the SmPC and is supported by the Week 52 CSR for Study A2311. The Week 
52 CSR for Study A2311 includes cumulative efficacy, safety and PK data up to and including Week 52 
as well as cumulative safety data up to and including the cut-off date of 28-May-2020 (Entire treatment 
period). The entire treatment period for Study A2311 is expected to last for up to 208 weeks, and the 
study thus still remains ongoing. 
It should be noted that results up to Week 24 for Study A2311 have previously been assessed within 
procedure  EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0057,  and  a  full  re-assessment  of  the  study  is  therefore  considered 
beyond the scope of the current procedure. A brief summary of the study results at Week 24, as reported 
in the EPAR, is provided for the reader’s convenience. 
Study A2311 is a multicentre, randomised, open-label study in paediatric patients aged 6 years to less 
than 18 years with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. Patients were randomised using a 1:1 
ratio  into  secukinumab  Low  dose  or  secukinumab  High  dose  arms.  The  patients  received  their  doses 
based on the weight category (< 25 kg, 25 to < 50 kg, ≥ 50 kg). Patients weighing < 25 kg received 75 
mg (both Low and High dose groups), patients weighing 25 kg to < 50 kg received 75 mg (Low dose 
group) or 150 mg (High dose group), and patients weighing ≥ 50 kg received 150 mg (Low dose group) 
or 300 mg (High dose group). 
Approximately 80 patients (at least 60 patients with moderate severity, at least 5 patients in the < 25 
kg weight group, and at least 10 patients in each of the other two weight groups: 25 to < 50 and ≥ 50 
kg) aged 6 years to < 18 years were planned to be enrolled. The randomisation was stratified by body 
weight (< 25, 25 to < 50, ≥ 50 kg) and disease severity (moderate [PASI score 12 to < 20 and IGA 3 or 
4 or PASI score ≥ 20 and IGA 3] or severe [PASI score ≥ 20 and IGA of 4]), collected at the Randomisation 
Visit. 
The study consisted of 3 periods: 
•  Screening  period:  up  to  4  weeks  to  assess  eligibility  and  to  taper  patients  off  prohibited 
medications 
Assessment report  
EMA/422077/2021  
Page 7/14 
 
 
 
• 
• 
Treatment period of up to 208 weeks, with the primary endpoint being assessed at Week 12 
Post-treatment follow-up period up to Week 224: follow-up of 16 weeks after end of treatment 
The primary objective of the study was to evaluate the efficacy of secukinumab with respect to PASI 75 
and IGA mod 2011 0 or 1 response (co-primary endpoints) at Week 12, compared to a historical placebo 
control. A Bayesian method was chosen to allow the direct incorporation into the analysis of information 
about placebo response rates from historical data through a meta-analytic-predictive (MAP) prior. 
A total of 84 patients completed the screening phase and were randomised to the two treatment groups 
in a 1:1 ratio. Both secukinumab doses (Low and High) were superior to historical placebo with respect 
to PASI 75 response and IGA 0/1 response at Week 12, and very high response rates were seen on the 
co-primary endpoints of PASI 75 response and IGA 0/1 response at Week 12. Using pure non-responder 
imputation for missing data, the PASI 75 response at Week 12 was 92.9% (39/42) in both secukinumab 
Low dose and High dose group, and the IGA 0/1 response at Week 12 was 78.6% (33/42 patients) in 
the Low dose group and 83.3% (35/42 patients) in the High dose group. The estimated probability of a 
positive  treatment  effect  (i.e.,  log  OR  >0)  for  secukinumab  Low  or  High  dose  compared  to  historical 
placebo was 1 (100%). Adequate maintenance of effect was seen until Week 24. 
The  Adverse  Event  (AE)  profile  observed  in  Study  A2311  did  not  reveal  new  safety  concerns. 
Secukinumab in the studied paediatric population appeared equally well tolerated as in adult psoriatic 
patients. No clinically significant differences regarding safety were observed between the Low and High 
dose groups. 
The EPAR for procedure EMEA/H/C/003729/II/0057 may be consulted for a comprehensive review of the 
full study. 
6.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
6.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
The proposed updates into Section 5.1 of the SmPC are supported by the Week 52 CSR for Study A2311. 
6.2.  Results 
Updated long-term results provided in the Week 52 CSR confirm adequate maintenance of therapeutic 
effect. Efficacy results at Week 24 and Week 52 are summarised in Table 1.  
Assessment report  
EMA/422077/2021  
Page 8/14 
 
 
 
 
Table 1 Number (%) of patients with PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100 and IGA 0/1 response (pure non-
responder imputation) – Week 24 and Week 52 (Full Analysis Set) 
Mean PASI scores decreased from baseline values of 18.5 (SD 5.2) in the Low dose group and 19.2 (SD 
6.7) in the High dose group to Week 52 scores of 1.1 (SD 3.0) and 1.1 (SD 2.8) in the Low and High 
dose  groups,  respectively.  At  Week  52,  22/42  (52.4%)  patients  in  the  Low  dose  group  and  30/42 
(71.4%)  patients  in  the  High  dose  group  had  achieved  an  IGA  mod  2011  score  of  0  (clear).  The 
proportion of patients achieving a CDLQI score of 0 or 1 at Week 52 was 70.7% (29/41) in the Low dose 
group and 70.3% (26/37) in the High dose group. 
6.3.  Discussion 
The  updated  results  confirm  adequate  maintenance  (up  to  52  weeks)  of  the  therapeutic  effect  of 
secukinumab among paediatric patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, with response rates 
remaining high on both PASI and IGA assessments. Replacement of the Week 24 data, currently included 
within Section 5.1. of the SmPC, with the updated Week 52 data has been appropriately implemented 
and is endorsed. 
The MAH initially proposed to include a textual addition highlighting the higher PASI 100 response at 
Week 52 with the High dose regimen. This was not endorsed by the Rapporteur, and the MAH agreed to 
remove the statement. 
7.  Clinical Safety aspects 
7.1.  Methods – analysis of data submitted 
As noted above, the Week 52 CSR for Study A2311 includes cumulative safety data up to and including 
Week 52 as well as up to and including the cut-off date of 28-May-2020 (Entire treatment period). Study 
A2311 remains ongoing, with 77 of the 84 randomised patients remaining in the study at the time of the 
data cut-off.

7.2.  Results 
Overall, 40/42 (95.2%) patients received ≥ 52 weeks of secukinumab treatment in the Low dose group 
compared to 36/42 (85.7%) patients in the High dose group. The median duration of exposure was 365 
days in the dose groups and cumulative exposure was 42.15 patient-years for the Low dose group and 
40.21  patient-years  for  the  High  dose  group.  During  the  Entire  treatment  period,  the  cumulative 
exposures across the dose groups were similar, reaching a total exposure of 97.81 patient-years in the 
Any secukinumab dose group. At the time of data cut-off, median duration of exposure was 449 days in 
the Low dose group and 431 days in the High dose group. 
At Week 52, 65.5% (55/84) of patients had AEs. The incidence of AEs was similar in the Low dose (28/42 
patients, 66.7%) and High dose (27/42 patients, 64.3%) groups. The most commonly affected System 
Organ  Classes  (SOCs)  (>10%  in  the  Any  secukinumab  dose  group)  were  Infections  and  infestations 
(40/84  patients;  47.6%  overall),  and  Gastrointestinal  disorders  (12/84  patients,  14.3%  overall) 
consistent with the Week 24 analysis, with the additional SOC of Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
meeting the >10% threshold (12/84 patients, 14.3% overall) in the Week 52 analysis. 
The  incidences  of  AEs  were  similar  in  the  Low  dose  and  High  dose  groups  under  Infections  and 
infestations (Low dose group: 19/42 patients, 45.2%; High dose group: 21/42 patients, 50.0%). The 
incidence of AEs under Gastrointestinal disorders was higher in the High dose (8/42 patients, 19.0%) 
compared  to  the  Low  dose  group  (4/42  patients,  9.5%)  and  the  incidence  of  AEs  under  Skin  and 
subcutaneous tissue disorders was higher in the secukinumab Low dose group (8/42 patients, 19.0%) 
compared to the High dose group (4/42 patients, 9.5%). 
The incidence of AEs under the SOC of Infections and infestations was mainly driven by nasopharyngitis 
(15/84 patients, 17.9% overall). The incidence of AEs under the SOC of Gastrointestinal disorders was 
mainly due to diarrhoea (3/84 patients, 3.6% overall) and vomiting (3/84 patients, 3.6% overall) and 
under the SOC of Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders was mainly due to acne (6/84 patients, 7.1% 
overall). 
Most frequent AEs by Preferred Term (PT) are summarised in Table 2.

Table 2 Most frequent (>/= 4% in any treatment group) treatment-emergent adverse events, by 
preferred term – Data up to Week 52 (Safety set) 
Two patients reported injection site reactions corresponding to AEs coded to HLT ‘injection site reaction’ 
or ‘application and instillation site reactions’ at the Week 24 analysis (Day 1). An additional patient from 
the  High  dose  group had a  mild  AE  of  injection  site  pruritus  on  Day  281.  There  were  no other  newly 
reported  injection  site  reaction  events  coded  with  HLT  ‘injection  site  reaction’  or  ‘application  and 
instillation site reactions’ at the Week 52 analysis. 
Findings in the dataset up to data cut-off were similar to the Week 52 dataset. 
No deaths were reported in the study up to data cut-off. A total of 4 non-fatal SAEs had been reported: 
•  A  14-year  old  male  patient  (moderate  disease  randomised  to  Low  dose  150  mg  group) 
experienced  an  SAE  of  infectious  mononucleosis  of  mild  severity.  The  event  resolved  after 
medication treatments, and the duration of the event was 17 days. The event was considered 
as not related to the study drug. The patient was continuing in the study at the time of data cut-
off. 
Assessment report  
EMA/422077/2021  
Page 11/14 
 
 
 
 
 
•  A  14-year  old  female  patient  (moderate  disease  randomised  to  Low  dose  150  mg  group) 
attempted deliberate self-harm (eight linear superficial and mild cuts on the wrist) which was 
reported as a severe SAE of intentional self-injury on Day 313. Active medical conditions included 
visual field defect, insomnia, anxiety and depressed mood. Anxiety and depressed mood were 
both  treated  with  psychological  behaviour  therapy.  For  the  SAE  of  intentional  self-injury,  no 
treatment was reported; the patient recovered from the event intentional self-injury on the same 
day, and decided to discontinue the treatment and received the last dose of the study drug on 
Day 309. The event was considered as not related to the study drug. The patient moved to the 
treatment free follow-up period and was continuing in the study at the time of data cut-off. 
•  A 10-year old female patient (moderate disease randomised to High dose 150 mg group, started 
300 mg on Day 229 due to weight group change as per protocol), was diagnosed with SAE of 
severe  appendicitis  on  Day  236.  No  relevant  medical  history  or  active  medical  condition  was 
reported. The patient underwent appendectomy and the event resolved on Day 237. The event 
(appendicitis) was considered to be related to the study drug. The patient was continuing in the 
study at the time of data cut-off. 
•  A 16-year old female patient (severe disease randomised to High dose 300 mg group) developed 
acute tonsillitis (mild, non-serious) on Day 211, was treated with amoxicillin and recovered from 
tonsillitis on Day 215. On Day 437, the patient developed a second episode of acute tonsillitis 
(SAE)  of  mild  severity  and  was  hospitalised  on  the  same  day.  The  patient  was  treated  with 
Rhinofebral, amoxicillin, ceftriaxone, octenidine-phenoxyethanol, Eucalyptus globulus leaf, and 
miramistin. The event resolved on Day 444. No action was taken with the study medication, and 
the event was considered as not related to the study drug. The patient was continuing in the 
study at the time of data cut-off. 
From  the  beginning  of  the  study  through  Week  52,  AEs  leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation  were 
reported in 2 patients; both were in the High dose group and both were of mild severity: ALT and AST 
elevations (not study drug-related) and haemorrhagic diarrhoea (study drug-related). Both events were 
already  reported  in  the  Week  24  analysis.  Beyond  Week  52,  no  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  were 
reported. 
In a search of AEs by standardised MedDRA Queries (SMQs; narrow search), the most commonly affected 
(> 10% overall) SMQs were: 
•  Gastrointestinal nonspecific inflammation and dysfunctional conditions: Higher incidences were 
observed in the High dose group (8/42 patients, 19.0%) compared to the Low dose group (4/42 
patients,  9.5%)  and  comprised  AEs  of  diarrhoea,  abdominal  pain,  upper  abdominal  pain, 
vomiting, constipation, nausea and non-cardiac chest pain. 
•  Oropharyngeal  disorders:  Higher  incidences  were  observed  in  the  High  dose  group  (7/42 
patients, 16.7%) compared to the Low dose group (4/42 patients, 9.5%) and comprised AEs of 
oropharyngeal  pain,  odynophagia,  aphthous  ulcer,  tonsillitis,  pharyngitis,  oral  herpes  and 
pharyngotonsillitis. 
An analysis of Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESI) according to important identified and potential 
risks in the Cosentyx Risk Management Plan was also undertaken. The most frequently reported risks 
were  Infections  and  infestations  (driven  primarily  by  upper  respiratory  tract  infections)  followed  by 
Neutropenia and Hypersensitivity events. The results up to Week 52 are summarised in Table 3. 
Assessment report  
EMA/422077/2021  
Page 12/14 
 
 
 
Table 3 Absolute and relative frequencies for important identified and potential risks (level 1 and 2) 
based on all adverse events - Data up to Week 52 (Safety set) 
The  most  frequently  reported  Infections  and  infestations  were  related  to  ‘Upper  respiratory  tract 
infections’ (High Level Term; HLT) with comparable incidences in the both Low (12/42 patients; 28.6%) 
and  High  dose  (14/42  patients;  33.3%)  groups  and  driven  primarily  by  the  AE  nasopharyngitis;  this 
resolved completely in all patients while still on treatment. The incidence of nasopharyngitis was 21.4% 
(9 patients) in the Low dose group and 14.3% (6 patients) in the High dose group. All the events of 
nasopharyngitis were considered as not related to the study drug except for one patient, where the event 
was severe and considered to be related to the study drug. 
The other frequently reported Infections and infestations were related to ‘Viral infections NEC’ (HLT) with 
higher  incidences  in  the  High  dose  (7/42  patients; 16.7%)  than  the  Low  dose  (3/42  patients;  7.1%) 
groups and mainly driven by AEs of viral infection and viral upper respiratory tract infection. These were 
considered  as  not  related  to  the  study  drug  and  resolved  completely  in  all  patients  while  still  on 
treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/422077/2021  
Page 13/14 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypersensitivity AEs were reported in 3 (7.1%) patients in the Low dose group and 1 patient (2.4%) in 
the High dose group. For the Week 52 analysis, the AEs included drug hypersensitivity and eczema in 
the Low dose group and erythema nodosum in the High dose group. All these events were non-serious, 
of mild intensity, resolved completely in all patients while still on treatment and were considered as not 
related to the study drug. 
For the Week 52 analysis, Neutropenia events were reported in 5 patients (3 patients from the Low dose 
and 2 patients from the High dose group). All of these events had occurred at the time of the Week 24 
analysis, and there were no new patients with reported AEs of neutropenia and leukopenia beyond the 
Week 24 cut-off date. None of these events (neutropenia and leukopenia) were serious or led to study 
drug discontinuation/interruptions. 
One patient in the High dose group had an Inflammatory bowel disease event (haemorrhagic diarrhoea 
leading  to  study  drug  discontinuation),  and  one  patient  in  the  Low  dose  group  had  an  AE  under  the 
Standard MedDRA Query (SMQ) Suicide/self-injury (reported as an SAE; see above for details). 
During  the  Entire  treatment  period,  all  newly  occurring  or  worsening  laboratory  abnormalities  in 
haematology  and  clinical  chemistry  parameters  were  CTCAE  grade  1  or  2,  with  no  meaningful  dose-
related  trends  between  the  dose  groups.  No  patient  had  laboratory  abnormalities  meeting  Hy’s  Law 
criteria. 
7.3.  Discussion 
Updated safety data in the Week 52 CSR for Study A2311 remains consistent with the Week 24 data as 
well as the general safety profile for secukinumab. In addition to the case of haemorrhagic diarrhoea 
already reported in the Week 24 CSR, one case of intentional self-injury was reported. Both are identified 
as  important  potential  risks  for  secukinumab  and  are  being  monitored  as  part  of  pharmacovigilance 
activities for secukinumab. However, these single events are not considered to have further bearing on 
the overall known risk profile. No safety-related changes to current Product Information are proposed 
by the MAH, and this view is endorsed.

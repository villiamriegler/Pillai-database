1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Type II variation 
Pursuant to Article 16 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Eisai Ltd submitted to the European 
Medicines Agency on 10 February 2016 an application for a variation.  
The following variation was requested:

Extension of Indication to include treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome in 
paediatric patients 1 year of age and older, based on the results of study E2080-G000-303 (Study 303); a 
randomized, controlled, open-label study to evaluate the cognitive development effects and safety, and 
pharmacokinetics of adjunctive rufinamide treatment in paediatric subjects 1 to less than 4 years of age with 
inadequately controlled Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. This study was conducted to fulfil the long-term (2 
years) safety and efficacy objectives required as part of the Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) 
EMEA-000709-PIP01-09. As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are proposed to 
be updated and the Package Leaflet is proposed to be updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to make minor editorial changes in the annexes, to implement changes in line with the latest 
QRD template and to combine the SmPCs, labelling and Package Leaflets for the three authorised strengths 
of the tablet formulation in line with the current version of the QRD template. The application included an 
updated RMP version 9.0. 
The requested variation proposed amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, labelling and 
Package Leaflet and to the Risk Management Plan (RMP). 
Inovelon was designated as an orphan medicinal product EU/3/04/240 on 20 October 2004 in the following 
indication: Treatment of Lennox-Gastaut syndrome.  
The extended indication, which is the subject of this application, falls within the above mentioned orphan 
designation. 
During the procedure the marketing authorisation holder revised the requested scope of the variation and no 
longer sought an extension of the indication, instead proposing inclusion of relevant paediatric data in the 
product information. 
Information on paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0116/2016 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
PIP P/0116/2016 is completed. The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0116/2016.  
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the applicant did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised

Rufinamide  is  a  triazole  derivative  that  exhibits  broad-spectrum  anticonvulsant  properties  by  elevating 
seizure threshold and preventing seizure spread. In vitro pharmacodynamic data indicate that rufinamide 
interacts with the inactivated state of sodium channels and slows conversion to the active state thereby 
reducing the frequency of sodium dependent action potentials.  
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 5/57 
 
  
  
 
 
Rufinamide  is  the  active  substance  of  Inovelon,  which  was  approved  in  the  European  Union/European 
Economic Area through the Centralised Procedure by Commission Decision in 2007 for use as adjunctive 
therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 4 years of 
age and older. The product was granted orphan drug designation for the treatment of LGS in the European 
Union in 2004.  
Inovelon  is  available  as  tablets  (100,  200,  and  400  mg  formulations)  as  well  as  an  oral  suspension 
(40 mg/ml).  The  oral  suspension  was  developed  in accordance  with  a  post-approval  commitment to the 
initial marketing authorisation as a child-friendly formulation, which is more convenient for administration to 
young children and those unable to swallow tablets. In patients weighing 30 kg or more, treatment with 
Inovelon should be initiated at a daily dose of 400 mg. According to clinical response and tolerability, the 
dose may be increased by 400 mg/day increments.  The maximum dose depends on weight.  In patients 
< 30 kg, treatment should be initiated at a daily dose of 200 mg, which may be further increased by 200 
mg/day increments, as frequently as every two days, up to a maximum recommended dose of 1000 mg/day. 
Lower doses are recommended in the patients if they receive concomitant valproate. Inovelon should be 
taken together with food twice daily, in two equally divided doses.  
LGS is rare and is one of the most severe forms of childhood epilepsy. The syndrome usually has its onset 
between the ages of 1 and 8 years (typically between 3 and 5 years), but occasionally it occurs in children 
who are more than 8 years old. LGS continues to manifest into adulthood in a large number of patients and 
is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The hallmarks of the disease include the following 
triad: 
• 
• 
• 
The presence of multiple seizure types: the most characteristic are tonic-atonic seizures and atypical 
absences, but tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and partial seizures are also frequently present. Tonic-atonic 
seizures often provoke sudden falls (commonly called drop attacks) and result in injuries. 
The  presence  of  generalized  discharges  with  slow  spike-and-wave  complexes 
in  the 
electroencephalogram (EEG). 
The presence of mental retardation or a learning disability. In general, this is represented by a static 
encephalopathy, although the mental status may worsen in the course of the disease due to multiple 
causes, such as very frequent occurrence of seizures, sometimes subclinical, frequent head trauma 
from the falls associated with seizures (drop attacks), and undesirable cognitive effects of the high 
doses of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) used to treat this very refractory type of epilepsy. 
The aetiology of LGS remains unknown in about half of the cases, whereas in others, the syndrome results 
from obvious brain injury. The most common identifiable factor is a history of infantile spasms, occurring in 
up  to  one-third  of  the  cases.  Other  causes  include  perinatal  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  trauma, 
meningitis and encephalitis, tumour, and severe head trauma. However, the  electro-clinical features are 
identical. The expression of LGS is similar in the younger population compared to older children and adults.  
However, at 1  year of age, the diagnosis of LGS can be very challenging in particular in children with a 
history of infantile spasms or West Syndrome.  
As  children  with  LGS  grow  older  they  may  continue  to  have  atypical  absence  seizures,  generalized 
tonic-clonic seizures and atonic seizures through adolescence and into adulthood (van Rijckevorsel 2008). 
Most  longitudinal  studies  consistently  show  that  approximately  50%  of  LGS  patients  will  retain  the 
characteristic features of LGS if followed for 5-10 years into adulthood (Oguni 1996, Oller-Daurella 1973, 
and Beaumanoir 1982, referenced in Glauser and Morita, 2006). 
With the present application, the MAH sought to extend the indication to include paediatric patients from 
1 year to less than 4 years of age. The application was supported by data from an open label safety and 
pharmacokinetic (PK) study (study E2080-G000-303, hereafter referred to as study 303) in children aged 
1 to less than 4 years of age with inadequately controlled LGS and a juvenile toxicity study in beagle dogs. 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 6/57 
 
  
  
Both  studies  were  part  of  the  PIP.  In  addition,  population  pharmacokinetic  (pop  PK)  simulations  were 
conducted.  
No additional study to establish efficacy of rufinamide in the new age group of 1-4 year olds was conducted. 
Instead,  reference  was  made  to  the  original  pivotal  study  (Study  CRUF331  0022),  in  which  efficacy  of 
rufinamide in the add-on treatment of LGS had been demonstrated in an older paediatric population. The 
MAH  claimed  that  efficacy  can  be  extrapolated  to  the  younger  patients  because  as  the  disorder  is 
physiologically similar in both age ranges.  
2.1.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.1.1.  Introduction 
The  original  marketing  authorisation  of  Inovelon  was  supported  by  a  nonclinical  package  including 
pharmacology studies, a battery of safety pharmacology studies, PK studies in rodents (mouse and rat) and 
non-rodents (dog, cynomolgus monkey, and baboon), and distribution, metabolism, and excretion studies. 
In  addition,  a  comprehensive  toxicology  program  was  conducted  that  included  repeated-dose  toxicity 
studies in rats, dogs, and cynomolgus monkeys (including toxicokinetics), 2-year carcinogenicity studies in 
mice  and  rats,  juvenile  toxicity  studies  in  rats  and  dogs,  genotoxicity  studies,  and  reproductive  and 
embryo-foetal developmental toxicity studies. 
To support the extension of the indication for the treatment of LGS in children aged 1 to less than 4 years old, 
a  14-week  oral  toxicity  study  in  juvenile  beagle  dogs  was  conducted  to  complement  the  previously 
conducted 13-week oral toxicity study in juvenile dogs and the dose range finding study in rats. 
2.1.2.  Pharmacology 
In  vitro  data  suggest  that  rufinamide  is  involved  in  modulation  of  sodium  channels  by  prolonging  their 
inactive  state.  Anti-seizure  activity  has  been  shown  in  relevant  in  vivo  models  of  seizure  disorders. 
Behavioural and safety pharmacology studies showed that no unwanted pharmacological effects at doses 
exceeding those which confer anti-convulsant protection. 
2.1.3.  Toxicology 
In  previously  conducted  studies,  rufinamide  showed  a  low  acute  toxicity.  In  the  repeated-dose  toxicity 
studies, the main target organ was the liver. Rufinamide did not show genotoxic potential. There was no 
evidence of teratogenic potential in either rat or rabbit, but reproductive toxicity was observed at doses 
where maternal toxicity was seen.  
Juvenile toxicity data from the rat and dog, submitted in support of the initial application, indicated that the 
target organs in juvenile and adult rats and dogs were the same, i.e. liver and kidney, and that juvenile 
animals were not more sensitive than adult animals to the toxic effects of rufinamide. Furthermore, no effect 
on behavioural and physical development were observed in juvenile rats. 
Additional juvenile dog toxicity study (repeat dose toxicity) 
To support the extension of indication to patients aged 1-4 years, the MAH submitted a 14-week juvenile 
toxicity study in dogs aged 6 weeks at initiation of treatment. This study was conducted to complement the 
previous pivotal juvenile dog toxicity study with dosing of dogs initiated from the age of 4 months.  
The study is summarized in the table below.

At 200 mg/kg, a decrease in body weight and body weight gain associated with a decrease in height and 
length  was  observed.  These  effects  were  reported  as  being  of  slight  magnitude,  with  increases  in  body 
weight and height and length values comparable to those of controls during the recovery period. In addition, 
there was no treatment-related effect on bone parameters. 
The liver was a target organ. Rufinamide induced an increase in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and 
relative liver weight at 200 mg/kg. The only histopathological finding consisted of pigment deposition in 
centrilobular bile canaliculi, centrilobular hepatocytes and Kupffer cells at ≥ 20 mg/kg, corresponding to an 
exposure below the therapeutic exposure.  
There was no evidence of accumulation or gender-related differences in the toxicokinetics of rufinamide after 
14 weeks. The differences in absorption and elimination at the dose levels tested resulted in an overall less 
than dose-proportional increase in exposure between 20 and 200 mg/kg. An overview of the exposure ratio 
between dogs and humans is provided in Table 2.

2.1.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
A  revised  environmental  risk  assessment  (ERA)  was  presented  by  the  MAH.  As  in  previous  ERAs, 
environmental exposure to rufinamide has been calculated from the combined uses of Inovelon tablets and 
Inovelon oral suspension. A refined value for market penetration (Fpen) was calculated at 0.0000115 based 
on information on the sales forecast for 2016-2019, resulting in a predicted environmental concentration in 
surfacewater  (PECsurfacewater)  of  0.0184  μg/L,  which  is  above  the  trigger  value of  0.01  µg/L.  Therefore,  a 
Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis has been performed.  
Phase II – Tier A: Initial environmental fate and effects analysis 
Ratios  of  PECs  and  predicted  no-effect  concentrations  (PNEC),  i.e.  PECsurfacewater/PNECwater,  and 
PECgroundwater/PNECgroundwater, were all below 1, and thus no further testing in the aquatic compartment or the 
groundwater compartment was necessary. The ratio of PECsurfacewater/PNECmicroorganism was significantly below 
0.1 so that a risk to micro-organisms was extremely unlikely. 
The log Kow of rufinamide was significantly smaller than 3. Furthermore, rufinamide is not highly adsorptive, 
does not belong to a class of substances known to have a potential to accumulate in living organisms, and 
there are no indications from structural features for bioaccumulative potential. Therefore, a bioconcentration 
study is not indicated and the risk for bioaccumulation is considered to be negligible. 
In an OECD 106 study, the adsorption-desorption behaviour of rufinamide was studied in 2 sludges and 
3 soils. The adsorption coefficient values including Koc were below the trigger for Phase II Tier B assessment 
for the terrestrial compartment. 
Ready biodegradability / Water-sediment study 
Rufinamide  was  not  readily  biodegradable  under  the  conditions  of  a  modified  Sturm  test  performed. 
However by Day 29 of this study, there was 7% to 9% biodegradation of rufinamide. 
In an OECD 308 study, the aerobic degradation of rufinamide in 2 water/sediment systems was investigated. 
The study showed that rufinamide was rapidly degraded in the water layer and in sediment. Very low to 
non-detectable levels were present in both sediment types (less than 1.3% by Day 14 and 0.0% by Days 28, 
64 and 99). The major transformation product and bound residues were observed in both sediment types. 
The transformation product has demonstrated significant shifting to the sediment (14% after 28 days and 
22% after 14 days in each of the two systems investigated) and based on the 50% degradation/dissipation 
time [DT50 > 1 year at 12°C (196/473 d at 20°C)] was found as very persistent in water-sediment-system.

2.1.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
To support the application for an extension of the target population for Inovelon to patients aged 1-4 years, 
the  MAH  provided  the  results  of  a  14-week  juvenile  toxicity  study  in  dogs  aged  6  weeks  at  initiation  of 
treatment, which is equivalent to a 2-year old human. This study was conducted to complement the previous

pivotal juvenile dog toxicity studies including a study in dogs with dosing initiated from the age of 4 months 
and a study in rats, which were 7 days of age at treatment initiation. Thus, altogether, a total of 3 pivotal 
toxicity  studies  with  rufinamide  have  been  performed  in  juvenile  animals.  Based  on  an  interspecies 
comparison of CNS and reproductive development, the CHMP considered that the paediatric age range from 
1-4 years have been adequately covered by these studies.  
The previous juvenile toxicity studies showed that the target organs in juvenile and adult animals were the 
same (liver in both species, and kidneys in rats) and that juvenile animals were no more sensitive than adult 
animals to the toxic effects of rufinamide. Furthermore, no effect on behavioural and physical development 
was observed in juvenile rats. No new toxicity findings were reported in the new study with 6-weeks old 
dogs, compared to studies in more mature animals. Reductions in body weight gain and slightly elevated 
serum ALT values were observed at doses of 200 mg/kg. Brown pigment deposition in the liver was observed 
in all treated groups. These histopathological findings were reversible after treatment cessation, and not 
unexpected since they were noted at ≥ 5 mg/kg in a previously conducted 13-week toxicity study performed 
in sexually mature dogs, and taking also into account the identification of liver as target organ in all tested 
species. Finally, there were no effects on neuro-behavioural, brain measurement or bone parameters. The 
toxicological profile of rufinamide in juvenile dogs was thus in line with that observed in previous studies in 
older juvenile and sexually mature dogs. Relevant information has been added to section 5.3 of the SmPC. 
Environmental risk assessment 
The updated ERA including the Phase II Tier A analysis were considered acceptable. All PEC/PNEC ratios were 
significantly below the trigger values. Even though the refined F pen should have been higher if calculated 
according  to  the  Guideline  on  the  environmental  risk  assessment  of  medicinal  products  for  human  use 
(EMA/CHMP/SWP/44609/2010 Rev.1 , May 2016), it would not have changed the conclusions. Log Kow and 
Koc were below the trigger values and no further study was required.  
However,  a  transformation  product  of  rufinamide  was  shown  to  significantly  shift  to  the  sediment.  The 
results  also  showed  that  the  transformation  product  of  rufinamide  was  very  persistent 
in 
water-sediment-system (DT50 > 1 year). Since, by the time of this report, the MAH had decided to no longer 
pursue the extension of the indication, no further action was required. However, if an extension of the target 
population  was  to  be  pursued  in  the  future,  a  specifically  designed  water/sediment  study  should  be 
conducted to identify this transformation product. In addition, the effects on sediment dwelling organisms 
should be investigated in an OECD 218 Sediment-Water Chironomid Toxicity Test Using Spiked Sediment 
with 14C-radiolabelled rufinamide (parent compound) as the test substance.  
2.1.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP considered that the 3 toxicity studies performed with rufinamide in juvenile animals adequately 
covered the proposed paediatric target population of Inovelon. The latest study in dogs initiated at 6 weeks 
of age did not identify an increased sensitivity to the toxic effects of rufinamide, and showed that the target 
organs were the same as in more mature juvenile and adult animals.  
The CHMP concluded that the available nonclinical data were acceptable to support this application.

2.2.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
In study 303, sparse PK samples for the determination of plasma rufinamide concentrations were collected 
during the Maintenance Period of the study at a morning visit to the clinic in Weeks 2, 8, and 24 and at an 
afternoon visit to the clinic in Weeks 4 and 16. PK data from 24 subjects in study 303 were available.  
The PK analysis for study 303 was conducted by pooling data with study 304 and 022 (see description of 
studies in Table 3 above; for a detailed summary of study 303, see section 2.3.2. ). The results from the 
latter two studies had previously been presented with the initial marketing authorisation application for 
Inovelon. The integration of PK data from studies 304 and 022 was done in order to enable comparison of PK 
across age groups. A population modeling approach was used to characterize the PK of rufinamide and to 
identify intrinsic and extrinsic factors significantly affecting the exposure. 
Previous PK evaluations for Inovelon had shown that maximum plasma levels of rufinamide are reached 
approximately 6 hours after administration. Peak plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under 
concentration-time curve (AUC) of rufinamide increase less than proportionally with doses in both fasted and 
fed healthy subjects and in patients, probably due to dose-limited absorption behaviour. After single doses, 
food increases the bioavailability (AUC) of rufinamide by approximately 34% and the peak plasma 
concentration by 56%.  
Only a small fraction of rufinamide (34%) was found to be bound to human serum proteins. Rufinamide is 
almost exclusively eliminated by metabolism. The main pathway of metabolism is hydrolysis of the 
carboxylamide group to the pharmacologically inactive acid derivative CGP 47292. The plasma elimination 
half-life is approximately 6-10 hours in healthy subjects and patients with epilepsy. Renal excretion was the 
predominant route of elimination for active substance related material, accounting for 84.7% of the dose. 
2.2.3.  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) modelling 
2.2.3.1.  Course Model based on LGS patient data 
Population PK Methods 
Population PK analysis was performed using non-linear mixed effect modelling in NONMEM v7.2. The final 
population PK model was evaluated for performance using graphical assessment, nonparametric 
bootstrapping and visual predictive checks (VPC). The resulting parameters from the final PK model were 
evaluated for fitness for calculation of individual derived values of rufinamide steady-state exposure Cav 
(average plasma concentration). 
The main objective was to characterize the PK of rufinamide in subjects with inadequately controlled LGS, 
permitting to compare exposure to rufinamide in paediatric population aged 1 to less than 4 years to that in 
subjects aged 4 years and older, by testing age as a continuous covariate as well as a categorical covariate 
(1 to < 4 years versus ≥ 4years), and to identify any intrinsic or extrinsic factors with an impact on 
rufinamide PK and PK variability. 
Cav values were also used in a graphical exploration of the PK/PD relationships for efficacy 
(cognitive/behavioural effects as measured by in Child Behavior Check List [CBCL] total problems score, and 
in relevant subscales, see section 2.3.2.1. for details on the CBCL questionnaire) and safety based on data 
from study 303 alone. 
PK/PD Data Sets 
The final PK dataset included 304 observations from a total of 115 subjects. For study 303, 110 rufinamide 
plasma concentrations from 24 subjects were available. Study 304 contributed 76 observations from a total 
of 26 subjects, while study 0022 contributed 118 observations from 65 subjects.

Figure 1 - Individual Observed Rufinamide Concentration versus Time after Dose by Study 
The PK of rufinamide was best described by a constant input model parameterized in terms of clearance 
(CL/F) as follows: Cav = R / (CL/F), where R is the dose rate. The dose rate was defined as the given dose 
divided by the dosing interval. Dosing interval was set for every 12 hours, as the dosing was twice daily. The 
inter-individual  variability  (IIV)  (η,  ETA)  was  assessed  using  an  exponential  error  structure,  assuming 
normal distribution of this parameter. Inter-occasion variability by study visit was also tested on clearance. 
The residual variability (ε) was assessed by additive, proportional, and combined additive/proportional error 
structures.  All  permutations  of  inter-individual  and  residual  variability  error  structures  were  tested 
systematically. 
Covariate model: 
The effect of the following covariates was investigated on rufinamide PK: demographics (sex, race, age [both 
as continuous and categorical], and body weight), renal function (creatinine clearance), and liver function 
(alkaline phosphatase, and bilirubin). Concomitant administration of other AEDs such as carbamazepine, 
lamotrigine, phenytoin, and valproic acid, were evaluated as categorical covariates. Plasma concentrations 
of valproate were also evaluated as a continuous covariate. 
Population PK Results 
Final model 
Using a constant input model parameterized in terms of CL/F, the IIV for CL/F was adequately estimated 
while no significant effect of inter-occasion variability was observed. Body weight and plasma concentrations 
of valproic acid were found to statistically significantly affect rufinamide CL/F.  
The estimate of basal CL/F from the final PK model was 2.19 L/h (95% Confidence Interval [CI]: 1.94; 2.44), 
while the estimate of the exponent for the effect of weight was 0.831 (95% CI: 0.704; 0.958). Plasma 
concentrations of valproic acid were associated with a linear decrease in rufinamide CL/F, with a slope of 
-0.496 (95% CI: -0.704; -0.288). As seen from the 95% CIs, all the parameters of the structural model were 
estimated with good precision (percent relative standard error of the estimate [%RSE] ≤21.5%). 
Inter-individual variability in CL/F was mild to moderate (33.3%) and estimated with good precision (%RSE

≤19.8). The additive residual error had an estimated standard deviation of 4.31 μg/mL, and was estimated 
with good precision (%RSE =11.7%). 
Goodness-of-fit-plots for the final PK model were presented. The scatter plots of population predicted and 
individual  predicted  versus  observed  concentrations  showed  even  distribution  around  the  line  of  unity. 
Additionally,  a  scatter  plot  of  conditional  weighted  residuals  (CWRES)  versus  population  predicted 
concentrations showed the CWRES to be roughly evenly distributed around zero, supporting the validity of 
the PK model. 
Model evaluation 
Visual predictive check (VPCs) 
In order to evaluate the predictive performance of the final PK model for rufinamide, a VPC was performed 
based on the final PK model and the final PK dataset. Using the simulated data of 2300 patients and after 
stratifying rufinamide concentrations by visit, the 90 % prediction intervals were determined and plotted 
together  with  the  observed  rufinamide  concentrations.  VPC  plots  showed  that  the  majority  of  observed 
concentrations were within the 90% prediction intervals for the model.  
Figure 2 - Visual Predictive Check Plots for Rufinamide PK Model Evaluation 
Bootstraps 
A nonparametric bootstrap for the final PK model was conducted. The CIs were generally narrow and the 
median  values  of  the  distribution  of  bootstrapped  parameter  values  were  consistent  with  the  original 
parameter estimates from the final PK model.

Predicted PK parameters  
The PK of rufinamide was not significantly affected by age as a continuous covariate (1 – 35 years) or as a 
categorical  covariate  (age  categories:  1  to  <  4  years  and  ≥  4  years)  after  body  weight  was  taken  into 
consideration.  It  was  also  not  affected  by  sex,  race  (Caucasian  versus  non-Caucasian),  hepatic  function 
(alkaline  phosphatase:  103  -  1828  IU/L,  and  bilirubin:  0.1  –  1.0  mg/dL),  renal  function  (creatinine 
clearance: 23.3 to 298.7 mL/min) and total daily rufinamide dose (160 to 4400 mg). 
A  graphical  presentation  of  predicted  PK  parameters  by  age  group  and  valproate  treatment  status  are 
depicted in figures below. Notably, plasma concentrations of valproic acid significantly decreased the CL/F of 
rufinamide in a linear relationship, with a slope of -0.496. This effect was more significant than the effect of 
valproic acid administration tested as a categorical covariate.

Model-Derived Exposure Predictions 
Median model-derived rufinamide Cav and AUC values were comparable across the different age groups (see 
Table 7. Model-derived Cav and AUC values are 13.9% to 33.0% higher in subjects receiving valproic acid.. 
Table 7 - Summary of Final Model-Derived Exposure Estimates by Age Group 
Exploratory Exposure-Response relationship 
The  relationship  between  rufinamide  Cav  and  change  from  baseline  in  CBCL  cognitive  development  and 
behavior effect scores at visits 8, 10, 12 and 13 were examined. Graphically, there was no clear trend to 
indicate for an effect of rufinamide exposure on CBCL total problems score and on each of the sub item CBCL 
scales:  Emotionally  Reactive,  Anxious/Depression,  Somatic  Complaints,  Withdrawn,  Sleep  Problems, 
Attention Problems, and Aggressive behavior scores as well as internal and external scores.  
There were 10 subjects receiving rufinamide treatment with available PK exposure data who experienced a 
total  of  15  treatment  related  adverse  events  (AEs).  The  most  common  of  these  were  somnolence 
(4 subjects) and nausea/vomiting (3 subjects). Due to the small numbers of subjects experiencing more 
than one AE, graphical PK/PD analysis of rufinamide Cav versus occurrence of treatment related AE could not 
be performed. 
2.2.3.2.  Revised Model based on extended PK data base 
In response to CHMP concern on the adequacy of the coarse model, the MAH presented a new population PK 
analysis  on  rufinamide  plasma  steady-state  concentration  data  pooled  from  ten  studies  in  subjects  with 
epilepsy, including data from studies 303, 022 and 304 and one bioequivalence study in healthy subjects 
between  the  suspension  and  marketed  tablet.  The  new  PK  population  for  rufinamide  consisted  of  1182 
subjects, of whom 11 were aged 1 to < 2 years, 19 were aged 2 to < 4 years old, 59 were aged 4 to < 8 
years, 80 were aged 8 to < 12 years, 118 were aged 12 to < 18 years and 895were aged ≥18 years. 
A  one-compartment  disposition  model  with  first-order  absorption  and  linear  elimination  adequately 
described rufinamide profiles from the pooled studies, parameterized for absorption rate constant, CL/F, 
apparent  volume  of  distribution  and  relative  bioavailability.  Due  to  high  shrinkage  on  absorption  rate 
constant (66.9%) no covariate effects, including effect of age, could be examined. The model was qualified 
using  goodness-of-fit  plots  and  prediction-corrected  visual  predictive  checks  and  validated  using 
nonparameteric bootsrap.  
2.2.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A population modeling approach was used to characterize the PK of rufinamide in subjects with inadequately 
controlled LGS and to compare exposure to rufinamide in the paediatric population within the age range of 
1 to less than 4 years in study 303 to that in subjects aged 4 years and older in study 022 and study 304 (see 
Table 4 for a brief description of the studies). Population PK analysis was performed using non-linear mixed 
effect modelling in NONMEM v7.2. 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 19/57 
 
  
  
 
The final PK dataset included 304 observations from a total of 115 subjects aged 1 to 35 years. Amongst 
these were 110 rufinamide plasma concentrations from 24 subjects in study 303 (i.e. within the age range 
of 1 to less than 4 years). Ten (10) of these subjects were below 2 years of age. PK/PD data for cognitive 
development  and  behaviour  effects  assessments  was  available  for  a  total  of  25  subjects  participating  in 
study 303, of which 5 subjects received placebo and 20 received rufinamide. 
Evaluation of concentration versus time profiles after dose showed neither a clearly identifiable absorption 
nor a clear elimination phase. A constant input model parameterized in terms of CL/F was found to best 
describe the PK profile of rufinamide. A one-compartment model assuming bolus administration was also 
tested,  but  it  was  considered  not  being  appropriate  to  describe  the  data.  Body  weight  and  plasma 
concentrations  of  valproic  acid  were  found  to  statistically  significantly  affect  rufinamide  CL/F.  All  the 
parameters of the final structural model were estimated with good precision and inter-individual variability 
in CL/F was mild to moderate (33.3%). Goodness-of-fit-plots supported the validity of the PK model.  
Furthermore, according to the MAH, VPCs of the data for 2300 simulated patients suggested that the PK 
profile  of  rufinamide  has  been  reasonably  well  defined  by  the  final  PK  model  with  good  predictive 
performance. However, VPCs suggested that the PK samples at visit 5 and 7 were over-predicted, which 
might indicate a model misspecification. Nonparametric bootstrap evaluation furthermore indicated that the 
final PK model for rufinamide was stable and produced a well estimated CL/F parameter.  
Based on the final model, the PK of rufinamide in paediatric patients with inadequately controlled LGS was 
found to be dose-independent, and was not significantly affected by age either as a continuous covariate 
(within the age range of 1 to 35 years covered by the analysis) or as a categorical covariate (age categories: 
1  to  <  4  years  and  ≥  4  years)  after  body  weight  was  taken  into  consideration.  As  previously  shown  in 
subjects aged 4 years and above, CL/F increased significantly with body weight, as a power function. Further 
addition of age to the model with weight was shown to be not significant, suggesting that once subject body 
weight is taken into consideration for dosing there is no need for further adjustments due to subject age. 
For the other evaluated covariates, no significant effect of sex, race, hepatic function, and renal function was 
seen. Co-administration of valproic acid significantly affected rufinamide clearance, in the 1 to < 4 year old 
subjects, similar to that in subjects 4 years and above. Co-administration of the other AEDs lamotrigine, 
carbamazepine, and phenytoin did not affect the PK of rufinamide PK. However, the validity of such finding 
was questionable, given the scarcity of data available in patients treated by carbamazepine, phenytoin and 
lamotrigine.  
Notably, total daily rufinamide dose (160 to 4400 mg) was not found to affect rufinamide PK. This finding 
appeared to be at odds with previous studies which found a clear dose dependency of rufinamide. 
The CHMP noted that the small amount of the data in patients with inadequately controlled LGS only allowed 
for building a coarse PK model. However, such model does not allow testing for differences in absorption, 
distribution and elimination upon age and would not lead to a comprehensive analysis of PK changes upon 
age. Thus, even if the outcome of the population PK analysis showed that age did not influence the PK of 
rufinamide and that exposure in younger and older patient was similar based on a comparison of rufinamide 
exposure (AUC and C av) in patients aged 1 to <4 years to patients ≥4 years, no conclusions could be drawn 
from such findings due to the lack of sensitivity of the model.  
Thus,  due  to  the  limitations  of  the  original  coarse  population  PK  model,  data  from  the  model  were  not 
considered suitable to support dosing recommendations in the new proposed age group of 1 to less than 4 
years  old  patients.  Notably,  with  regards  to  the  PK/PD  analyses,  no  clear  trend  to  indicate  an  effect  of 
rufinamide exposure on CBCL total problems score and relevant sub item CBCL scale was seen. Thus, no 
exposure-response relationship could be established. It was unclear, if this was due to the scarcity of data, 
inadequacy of the model or the actual absence of correlation. Finally, due to the small numbers of subjects 
Assessment report

Page 20/57 
 
  
  
experiencing more than one AE, graphical PK/PD analysis of rufinamide Cav versus occurrence of treatment 
related AE could not be performed.  
In response to the CHMP concern on the adequacy of the coarse model, the MAH presented the results from 
a new population PK analysis on rufinamide plasma steady-state concentration data pooled from ten studies 
in subjects with epilepsy, including data from studies 303, 022 and 304 and one bioequivalence study in 
healthy  subjects  between  the  suspension  and  marketed  tablet.  The  new  PK  population  for  rufinamide 
consisted of 1182 subjects including 11 and 19 patients younger than 2 years and 4 years, respectively. 
While in principle such enlarged model could bring useful information on rufinamide PK in children below the 
age of 4 years, the choice of model parameters and prediction power were questioned by the CHMP. While 
the absorbed fraction of rufinamide is known to be dependent upon the dose, this dose dependency was not 
accounted for in the new model. This issue was of importance as absorption features could be different in 
younger children (1-4 years). Furthermore, the prediction power of the model was questioned. Finally, a 
notable difference between basal CL/F compared to the coarse model was noted (5.34 L/h in the new model 
compared to 2.19 L/h in the former analysis). The new model was built upon data collected in heterogeneous 
subjects  (healthy  volunteers,  LGS  patient  and  other  epilepsy  patients)  and  the  former  analysis  was 
performed with data exclusively collected in LGS patients. However, disease state was not identified as a 
covariate  influencing  rufinamide  PK.  At  the  time  of  this  report,  the  above-mentioned  concerns  and 
discrepancies had not been satisfactorily addressed by the MAH and thus it was not possible to draw any 
conclusions from the new model.  
The CHMP recommended for the MAH to address the outstanding issues and re-develop a qualified/validated 
population PK model with an adequate predictive power to describe the PK of rufinamide in children. The 
systemic exposure in young children 1-2 years and 2-4 years should be estimated accordingly and compared 
to that observed in older children to inform dose recommendation below 4 years of age. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Overall, the available PK data and simulations at the time of this report were not considered suitable to 
support dosing recommendations in the new proposed age group of 1 to less than 4 year old LGS patients. 
The data used for the coarse population PK model from patient with inadequately controlled LGS were too 
limited to allow a reliable testing for differences in absorption, distribution and elimination by age. 
Furthermore, the choice of model parameters and prediction power of a new PK model including an enlarged 
data set from patients with LGS, other forms of epilepsy and from healthy subjects had not been sufficiently 
justified at the time of this report, thus not allowing to draw firm conclusion from the resulting PK 
predictions. Further development of a qualified/validated population PK model was recommended. 
2.3.  Clinical efficacy 
Efficacy of rufinamide in the adjunctive therapy of LGS in patients older than 4 years of age has been 
previously established based on the results of the pivotal trial 022. Given that the disease expression of LGS 
is similar in adults, older and younger children, the MAH was of the view that efficacy as observed in the 
patients ≥4 years can be extrapolated to patients aged <4 years.  
Supportive data were available from study 303, an open-label safety and PK study in children aged 1 to less 
than 4 years with inadequately controlled LGS. Efficacy was an exploratory objective.

The MAH stated that the dose regimen of rufinamide used in Study 303 was shown to be well-tolerated and 
effective in subjects greater than or equal to 4 years of age, and is approved at these doses in the tablet form 
in the European Union and the United States of America, on the basis of results from Study 022, which was 
the pivotal trial for the initial approval of rufinamide, using the same dosing regimen (starting dose of 
10 mg/kg/day and target maintenance dose of 45 mg/kg/day).  
2.3.2.  Main study 
Title of Study 303: A Multicenter, Randomized, Controlled, Open-Label Study to Evaluate the 
Cognitive Development Effects and Safety, and Pharmacokinetics of Adjunctive Rufinamide 
Treatment in Pediatric Subjects 1 to Less Than 4 Years of Age with Inadequately Controlled 
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome. 
2.3.2.1.  Methods 
This study was  a 2-year evaluation of primarily the safety and  PK of rufinamide as add-on treatment of 
seizures associated with LGS in subjects 1 to less than 4  years of age compared to any other approved 
add-on AED of the investigator’s choice.  
The study consisted of 2 phases (see also Figure 1):  
• 
Pre-randomization Phase: Screening Period and a Baseline Visit (1 to 8 weeks) 
•  Randomization Phase: Titration + Maintenance (106 weeks), and Taper (2 weeks) Period. 
Only subjects on rufinamide participated in the Taper Period and only those that completed the Taper Period 
at the end of the study had a Final or Follow-up Visit. Subjects that discontinued rufinamide early  were 
tapered (if deemed necessary by the investigator) before starting another add-on AED.

Study participants 
Diagnosis and Main Criteria for Inclusion 
•  Age 1 to less than 4 years. 
•  Clinical diagnosis of LGS at screening, which might have included the presence of a slow background 
electroencephalogram  (EEG)  rhythm,  slow  spikes-waves  pattern  (<3  Hz),  the  presence  of 
polyspikes;  care  should  have  been  taken  not  to  include  benign  myoclonic  epilepsy  of  infancy, 
subjects  with  a  diagnosis  of  atypical  benign  partial  epilepsy  (pseudo-Lennox  syndrome),  or 
continuous spike-waves of slow sleep. 
•  On a fixed and documented dose of 1 to 3 concomitant regionally approved AEDs for a minimum of 
4 weeks prior to randomization with an inadequate response to treatment. 
•  Consistent  seizure  documentation  (ie,  no  uncertainty  of  the  presence  of  seizures)  during  the 
Prerandomization Phase. 
Exclusion Criteria 
• 
• 
Familial short QT syndrome. 
Prior  treatment  with  rufinamide  within  30  days  of  Baseline  Visit  or  discontinuation  of  rufinamide 
treatment due to safety issues related to rufinamide. 
•  Any  history  of  or  concomitant  medical  condition  that,  in  the  opinion  of  the  investigator,  would 
compromise the subject’s ability to safely complete the study. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomized to 2 treatment groups in a ratio of 2:1 and received either rufinamide or any 
other approved AED of the investigator’s choice as an add-on to the subject’s existing regimen of 1 to 3 AEDs 
for 106 weeks (Titration plus Maintenance Period). 
Test drug: Rufinamide oral suspension (40 mg/mL)  was administered at a dose up to 45 mg/kg/day, in 
2 equally divided doses. During the Titration Period, rufinamide was initially administered at 10 mg/kg/day. 
It was subsequently increased at 10 mg/kg/day increments every 3 days to 40 mg/kg/day, and then further 
increased by 5 mg/kg/day to the target maintenance level of 45 mg/kg/day. In case of tolerability issues, 
the drug could be titrated more slowly or titrated to a lower dose at the investigator’s discretion. The dose 
reached at the end of the Titration Period was the dose that the subject should have received during the 
entire Maintenance Period. However, during the Maintenance Period, the dose could have been adjusted 
according  to  the  investigator’s  discretion.  At  the  end  of  the  Maintenance  Period,  rufinamide  was 
discontinued. If deemed necessary by the investigator, discontinuation could have been done gradually over 
a period of 2 weeks. 
Comparator: Administration of the add-on AED for subjects randomized to the any other AED treatment 
group  was  performed  according  to  the  investigator’s  usual  practice.  This  included  discontinuation  of  the 
selected add-on AED or replacement with another add-on AED if the initial add-on AED selected was not well 
tolerated. Tapering or discontinuation of the investigator selected add-on AED was performed according to 
the investigator’s usual practice.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy 
The primary efficacy variables were Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Total Problems score and change from 
baseline in CBCL Total Problems score at the end of the 2-year (106 weeks) treatment period. 
The  CBCL  is  a  99-item  questionnaire  completed  by  a  parent/legal  guardian  or  appropriate  caregiver 
(hereafter referred to as the rater) of the subject. Each item was rated with a 3-point scale indicating how 
often or characteristic it is of the subject. The 99 items were combined to produce scores for 8 problem area 
scales (emotionally reactive, anxious/depressed, somatic complaints, withdrawn, sleep problems, attention 
problems, aggressive behaviour, and other problems) and 3 summary scores (internalizing, externalizing, 
and total problems). Each item should have been rated by the rater as best they can without providing any 
additional instructions other than to explain and clarify the wording of an item if needed. The purpose of the 
scale was to provide t-scores for all problem area scales and the summary scores to identify behavioural 
problems  or  developmental  delays.  The  Total  Problem  score  is  the  sum  of  all  the  problem  areas  plus 
1 additional item. Internalization score is the sum of 4 problem areas that are problems within the self, and 
externalization consists of 2 problem areas involving conflict with other people and with their expectations of 
the child. The t-scores are standardized test scores that indicate the same degree of elevation in problems 
on  each  of  the  scales  relative  to  the  normative  sample  of  peers.  Higher  scores  are  indicative  of  more 
problems.  
Exploratory efficacy variables included time to withdrawal from treatment, seizure frequency, worsening of 
seizures, change from baseline in CBCL sub-scores, Language Development Survey (LDS) score, and Quality 
of Life in Childhood Epilepsy (QoLCE) total and subscores: 
•  Time  to  withdrawal  from  either  rufinamide  or  investigator’s  choice  of  add-on  AED  because  of 
occurrence of AEs or for lack of efficacy 
•  Percent change in total seizure frequency and in frequency by individual seizure type per 28 days by 
treatment group and in multiple cohorts of subjects. These cohorts included patients treated with 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 24/57 
 
  
  
rufinamide or other-AED for at least 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26.5 months. Seizures were 
assessed and recorded by the subject’s parents (s)/caregiver(s). 
Frequency per 28 days was defined as (S/D)*28 where, S = the sum of the seizures reported in the 
Subject  Seizure  Diary  during  the  specified  time  interval  and  D  =  the  number  of  days  with 
non-missing seizure data in the Subject Seizure Diary for the specified study Phase. 
•  Worsening  of  seizures  (doubling  in  total  seizure  frequency  or  in  frequency  of  major  seizures 
[generalized tonic-clonic, drop attacks] or occurrence of new seizure type) by treatment group and 
in multiple cohorts of patients. These cohorts included patients treated with rufinamide or other-AED 
for at least 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26.5 months. 
•  Change from baseline in CBCL subscores 
•  Change from baseline in LDS score during Maintenance Period.  
The LDS consists of an 8-item questionnaire and a vocabulary list. The form was completed by a 
parent or caregiver who interacted with the subject on a consistent, daily basis. The LDS provided 
2 scores, an average phrase length score and a number of endorsed vocabulary words score. Both 
raw scores were used to provide 2 normative scores based on the child’s age in months. Higher 
scores are indicative of better language development 
•  Change from baseline in total and subscores of QoLCE scale 
The  QoLCE  is  a  76-item  questionnaire  designed  specifically  to  measure  QoL  in  children  with 
epilepsy.  The  form  must  have  been  completed  by  a  parent  or  caregiver  who  interacted  with  the 
child on a consistent, daily basis. The items were combined into 13 scales and 3 of the items were 
used to represent an overall score in 3 separate areas. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Sparse blood sampling was performed for the determination of plasma rufinamide concentrations during the 
Maintenance Period at Visits 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 (Weeks 2, 4, 8, 16, and 24, respectively). See section 2.2. for 
the results. 
Safety 
AEs and the results of clinical laboratory assessments, physical examinations, and vital signs were employed 
to assess safety. See section 2.4. for the results. 
Sample size 
Originally, 75 subjects (rufinamide: n=50, any-other-AED: n=25) were planned to be recruited.  
Based on Achenbach System of Empirically Based Assessement Preschool Forms & Profiles (Achenbach and 
Rescorla,  2000),  the  mean  raw  scores  of  the  Total  Problems  is  58.8  for  referred  (with  documented 
psychopathological  issues)  children  and  33.4  for  non-referred  (normal  controls)  children  with  standard 
deviations of 26.5 and 18.8 respectively. Using a standard deviation of 23, a total sample size of 75 (50 on 
rufinamide and 25 on non- rufinamide) would provide 84% power to detect a difference of 17, which is two 
thirds of the above difference of 58.8 and 33.4 (=25.4), using a two-sided t-test at alpha=0.05. 
The planned number of subjects was later revised to allow a minimum of 21 rufinamide-treated subjects 
(25 rufinamide-treated patients as per the PIP).

Randomisation 
Subjects were assigned to treatments on the basis of a computerized randomisation scheme. Subjects were 
randomized to either rufinamide or any other approved AED in a 2:1 ratio. Randomization was performed 
centrally by Interactive Voice Response System.  
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable. 
Statistical methods 
Analysis Sets 
The  Safety  Set  included  all  enrolled  subjects  who  received  at  least  1  dose  of  rufinamide  or  any  other 
approved  add-on  AED  of  the  investigator’s  choice  and  had  at  least  1  post-dose  safety  assessment.  The 
Safety Set was based on actual treatment received.  
The PK Analysis Population consisted of all treated subjects who received rufinamide and had at least 1 valid 
concentration measurement with adequately documented dosing history. 
The Full Analysis Set for primary efficacy variable included all randomized subjects who received rufinamide 
or any other approved add-on AED of the investigator’s choice and had baseline and at least 1 post-dose 
cognition measurement. 
The Full Analysis Set for other efficacy variable  included randomized subjects who received rufinamide or 
any other add-on AED of the investigator’s choice and had a baseline efficacy assessment and at least 1 
post-baseline efficacy assessment. 
The Full Analysis Sets were based on randomized treatment. 
Efficacy Analyses 
Evaluation of efficacy was performed on the Full Analysis Sets. 
The 2 treatment groups were to be declared significantly different in favor of rufinamide, if the treatment 
effect p value was less than or equal to 0.05 using a 2-sided test, and if the least squares (LS) mean of the 
rufinamide group is less than the LS mean of the any-other-AED group over time (weeks). 
The primary statistical model for comparing the 2 treatment groups was a repeated measures mixed model 
analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with compound symmetric covariance structure, with baseline score, age, 
and sex as covariates, and treatment, week, and treatment by week interaction as factors. Unstructured 
covariance was also used to test the sensitivity of the model. Descriptive statistics of the mean change from 
baseline  by  treatment  group  and  week  were  presented.  LS  means  differences  between  the  2  treatment 
groups at each of the scheduled visits were computed. 
To compare the 2 treatment groups at the End of Study, an ANCOVA model was used on the last observation 
carried forward (LOCF) with baseline score and age as covariates, and sex and treatment as factors. This 
was done to test the effects of drop-outs on the results. To test the effect of time (week) on treatment, 
treatment groups were compared by excluding treatment by week interaction. 
The percent change in frequency of total seizures and by individual seizure types, per 28 days relative to 
baseline,  was  compared  between  treatment  groups  for  each  of  the  cohorts  of  subjects  treated  with 
rufinamide  or  any-other-AED  using  a  Wilcoxon  Rank  Sum  test  with  2-sided  0.05  alpha  level.  The 
Hodges-Lehmann 95% CI of the difference between treatment groups was presented. 
Incidence of worsening of seizures was summarized by treatment group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017

LDS and QoLCE scores were analyzed similarly to the primary efficacy endpoint Total Problems Score. The 
repeated measure mixed ANCOVA model failed to converge with the unstructured covariance structure due 
to small sample sizes. 
Time to withdrawal from treatment (excluding taper) because of occurrence of AEs or for lack of efficacy was 
summarized by treatment group and presented using Kaplan-Meier curves. 
Safety Analyses 
Evaluation of safety was performed on the Safety Population. Treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
were  summarized  by  presenting,  for  each  treatment  group,  the  incidence  of  AEs.  Descriptive  summary 
statistics  (mean  plus  standard  deviation,  median,  minimum,  and  maximum)  of  the  laboratory,  and  vital 
signs, and changes from baseline were evaluated by treatment group. Details on the safety analyses are 
provided in section 2.4.  
PK Analyses 
The plasma sample concentration values from this study were merged with comparable data from other 
studies to permit population PK modeling. Details on the PK analyses are provided in section 2.2.

2.3.2.2.  Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 43 subjects were screened for entry into the study. Of these 43 subjects, 6 were screening failures 
and  37  were  randomized  into  the  study.  Of  the  6  screen  failures,  4  subjects  failed  to meet  inclusion  or 
exclusion criteria, 1 subject withdrew consent, and 1 subject was excluded for other reasons. 
All  25  subjects  randomized  to  rufinamide  received  at  least  1  dose  of  study  drug.  Of  the  25 
rufinamide-treated  subjects,  15  rufinamide-treated  subjects  completed  the  study.  Ten  subjects 
discontinued from the study and 1 subject discontinued from rufinamide treatment but completed the study 
(due  to  inadequate  therapeutic  effect).  Primary  reasons  for  discontinuation  from  study  were  due  to  AE 
(decreased  appetite  and  vomiting,  vomiting,  SAE  of  pneumonia  that  resulted  in  death),  withdrawal  of 
consent, subject choice and inadequate therapeutic effect. 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017

All 12 subjects randomized to the any-other-AED group received at least 1 dose of study drug. Four subjects 
in the any-other-AED group completed the study. Of the 12 subjects treated with any-other-AED, 8 subjects 
discontinued  from  the  study.  Primary  reasons  for  discontinuation  were  withdrawal  of  consent,  lost  to 
follow-up, subject choice, inadequate therapeutic effect, and other reason.  
Recruitment 
The first subject was screened on 16 June 2011 and the last subject had the last visit on 2 November 2015. 
The study was conducted at 19 study sites in total; sites were in the US (8), Canada (1), France (1), Greece 
(2), Italy (4), and Poland (3). 
Conduct of the study 
There  were  2  revisions  and  2  amendments  to  the  original  protocol  (24  Nov  2010,  v1.0).  The  revisions 
corrected minor mistakes and typographical errors. A summary of the two amendments is provided below: 
•  26 Oct 2011, v4.0 (Amendment 01): to satisfy health authority requests, added a minimum of 25% 
of rufinamide-treated subjects will be between 2 and 3 years of age and that every effort will be 
made to include a younger population (between 1 and 3 years of age); revised exclusion for prior 
use of rufinamide; added blood volume required; added instructions if screening visit is extended, 
added duplicate, consecutive electrocardiograms (ECGs) at Visit 2 and Visits 5, 6, and 7 for steady 
state and maximum observed concentration (Cmax); baseline ECG prior to dosing and Visits 5, 6, 
and 7 approximately 4 to 6 hours after drug administration; changed qualified designated reader to 
central  reader  and  additional  clarification  for  screening  ECG;  added  measurement  of  head 
circumference at baseline, Visits 8, 10, 13, and at Follow-up/Final Visit or early discontinuation 
•  03 Apr 2013, v5.0 (Amendment 02): reduced from 8 to 4 weeks the minimum required time on AEDs 
before  randomization,  and  required  that  AED  doses  be  documented;  allowed  historical  seizure 
diaries  to  satisfy  inclusion  criteria  in  lieu  of  seizure  diaries  that  would  be  compiled  during  the 
Screening  Period,  thus  allowing  the  Screening  Period  to  be  shortened  to  expedite  recruitment; 
changed criterion for interim analysis compilation to allow reporting of data within the time frame 
requested by regulators, even if fewer than 75 patients have completed 6 months of treatment; 
added  amylase  and  lipase  samples  to  list  of  laboratory  tests  per  United  States  Food  and  Drug 
Administration (FDA) request for subject safety. 
Baseline data 
Most subjects were 12 to 35 months old (67.6%) and 32.4% were 36 to 48 months old; a similar distribution 
of age was present in the 2 treatment groups. Time to diagnosis and seizure type were also similar in both 
groups. Types of seizures were comparable in both groups, except for myoclonic seizures that were less 
frequent in percentage in rufinamide group (60.0%) compared to other-AED group (83.3%). The majority of 
subjects were white (86.5%); 10.8% were black or of African descent. The race and ethnicity of subjects 
randomized  into  this  study  was  a  reflection  of  the  racial  distribution  of  the  patient  population  in  the 
countries/sites participating in the study.

a: Age was calculated at date of informed consent. 
b: Subjects could have had more than 1 type of seizure. 
c: Although not specifically categorized as such in the listings, all "absence seizures" were atypical. 
Concomitant medication 
Overall, 8.1% of subjects in the Safety Analysis Set were taking 1 AED, 37.8% were taking 2 AEDs, 45.9% 
were  taking  3  AEDs,  2.7%  were  taking  4  AEDs,  and  5.4%  were  taking  5  AEDs  at  baseline.  The  most 
commonly taken AEDs (≥25% of the subjects in any treatment group) were valproic acid, levetiracetam, 
topiramate,  diazepam,  vigabatrin,  and  clobazam.  The  2  treatment  groups  appeared  to  have  a  similar 
treatment  profile  with  respect  to  AEDs  other  than  rufinamide.  Differences  in  percentage  should  be 
interpreted with caution taking into account the small number of patients.

Add-on AEDs chosen by the investigator at the time of randomization for subjects in the any other AED group 
were lamotrigine (5 [41.7%] subjects), clobazam and topiramate (2 [16.7%] subjects each), phenobarbital, 
valproic acid, and zonisamide (1 [8.3%] subject each). 
To compare the profile of AEDs (other than rufinamide) administered to subjects in both treatment groups, 
the add-on AEDs chosen by the investigator at the time of randomization were added to the baseline AEDs 
for  subjects  in  the  any-other-AED  group,  and  compared  to  the  baseline  AEDs  taken  by  subjects  in  the 
rufinamide group (see Table 5).

a: Add-on AEDs chosen by the investigator at the time of randomization for subjects in the any-other-AED group. 
Numbers analysed 
A total of 37 subjects were randomized to receive either rufinamide (n=25) or any other AED (n=12). All 
subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug and had at least 1 post-dose safety assessment and were 
included  in  the  Safety  Analysis  Set.  The  Full  Analysis  Set  for  the  primary  efficacy  variable  and  the  Full 
Analysis Set for other efficacy variables included 24 of 25 rufinamide-treated subjects and 9 of 12 treated

subjects  in  the  any-other-AED  group.  One  subject  in  the  rufinamide  group  and  3  subjects  in  the  in  the 
any-other-AED group did not have post-baseline efficacy data and were thus not included. 
Outcomes and estimation 
• 
Primary Efficacy Results 
The primary efficacy variable was CBCL Total Problems score at the end of the 2-year (106 weeks) treatment 
period. The CBCL Total Problems t-Scores mean and mean change from baseline are summarized by week 
in Table 10. The results of the CBCL Total Problems Score treatment comparison at Week 106, over time 
(based on means across Weeks 24, 56, 88, and 106) and the Final Visit using an ANCOVA model based on 
LOCF, with baseline score and age as covariates, and sex and treatment as factors are presented in Table 11.

The  Baseline  mean  score  for  the  any  other  AED  group  was  higher  compared  with  the  rufinamide  group 
(62.8 [n=8] vs. 56.6 [n=24] with LS mean difference of -5.43).  
There was no consistent trend in change from baseline in CBCL Total Problems Score by week and overall. 
LS mean of the CBCL t-scores for subjects after 2 years of treatment were 53.75 for the any other AED group 
and 56.35 for the rufinamide group, suggesting slightly higher problem areas for the rufinamide subjects 
compared with the any other AED group (LS mean difference [95% CI] +2.60 [-10.5,15.7]; P=0.6928).  The 
difference in the LS mean CBCL Total Problems Score between the 2 treatment groups across time and at the 
end of study (based on LOCF), though numerically slightly in favor of rufinamide with -1.20 (95% CI: -7.6, 
5.3, P=0.7083) and -2.776 (95% CI: -13.3, 7.8, P=0.5939), respectively, were not statistically significant.   
Exploratory Efficacy Results 
• 
Time to withdrawal 
The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the median overall survival time to withdrawal from treatment because of an 
AE or lack of efficacy was 142.0 weeks in the rufinamide group and 28.0 weeks in the any-other-AED group 
(Table 12).

Percent Change in Total Seizure Frequency 
The  percent  change  in  total  seizure  frequency  per  28  days  was  calculated  for  each  cohort  (i.e.  patients 
treated with rufinamide or other-AED for at least 1, 2, 4, 6, 10, 14, 18, 22, and 26.5 months) relative to 
baseline.  Mean  and  median  baseline  seizure  frequency  was  752.02  and  449.54  in  the  rufinamide  group 
(N=24) and 379.38 and 285.54 in the any other AED group (N=9). The overall median decrease (Min, Max) 
from baseline was 7.05% (79.2, 3644.1) in the rufinamide group and 20.15% (-83.3, 143.1) in the any 
other AED group. The median difference between the rufinamide group and the any other AED group was 
-14.4% (95%CI: -56.20, 15.50). The P value for the difference from the any-other-AED group was 0.2731. 
Percent  change  in  seizure  frequency  by  individual  seizure  types  (partial  seizures,  absences,  typical 
absences,  clonic  seizures,  tonic-atonic  seizures,  primary  generalized  tonic-clonic  seizures  and  other 
seizures) per 28 days across all cohorts relative to baseline showed no statistically significant differences 
between  the  2  treatments  groups.  However,  sample  sizes  (7-12  patients  receiving  rufinamide  and 
1-5 patients receiving any other AED) were small, affecting the interpretability of these results.

•  Worsening of seizures 
Worsening of seizures was summarized by the incidence of subjects with doubling in total seizure frequency, 
doubling  in  frequency  of  major  seizures  (generalized  tonic-clonic,  drop  attacks),  or  occurrence  of  new 
seizure type during each successive 3 to 4 month visit interval of the Maintenance Period relative to Baseline. 
Across all cohorts in the rufinamide group, 4 of 24 (16.7%) subjects reported a doubling in total seizure 
frequency, 5 of 24 (20.8%) reported a doubling in frequency of major seizures (generalized tonic-clonic, 
drop  attacks),  and  no  subjects  reported  an  occurrence  of  a  new  seizure  type.  Across  all  cohorts  in  the 
any-other-AED group, 1 of 9 (11.1%) subjects reported doubling in total seizure frequency and a doubling 
in frequency of major seizures (generalized tonic-clonic, drop attacks); no subjects reported an occurrence 
of a new seizure type. 
•  Change from baseline in LDS score during Maintenance Period 
LDS Average Phrase Length 
The LDS average phrase length can be categorized into delayed phrase development (≤20th percentile) or no 
delayed phrase development (>20th percentile). It is calculated by dividing the total number of words across 
all phrases by the number of phrases with greater than 0 words; for subjects with no words, the average is 
0.  At  baseline,  phrase  development  was  delayed  in  all  subjects.  The  delay  in  phrase  development  was 
severe; hence the baseline score was 0 for all except 3 subjects.  
The LDS average phrase length did not change notably in either treatment group during the study, and was 
delayed in all except 3 subjects at the end of treatment; the end of treatment score was 0 for all except 5 
subjects. When comparing LDS average phrase length between the 2 treatment groups at the End of Study 
using an ANCOVA model on the LOCF with baseline score and age as covariates and sex and treatment as 
factors, the resulting treatment difference was 0.194 (95% CI -0.4, 0.8), which is not statistically significant 
(P=0.5156).  When  compared  across  time  using  an  ANCOVA  mixed  model  for  repeated  measures  with 
baseline  score  and  age  as  covariates  and  sex,  treatment,  week,  and  treatment  by  week  interaction  as 
factors,  the  treatment  difference  of  0.222  (0.303)  (95%  CI  -0.4,  0.8)  is  not  statistically  significant 
(P=0.4693) 
LDS Vocabulary Score 
The LDS vocabulary score can be categorized into delayed vocabulary development (≤15th percentile) or no 
delayed  vocabulary  development  (>15th  percentile).  Vocabulary  development  was  delayed  in  all  except 
1 subject  at  baseline,  and  all  except  3  subjects  at the  end  of  treatment.  The  delay  in  development  was 
severe, hence the baseline score was 0 for all except 7 subjects and the end of treatment score was 0 for all 
except 9 subjects. 
The treatment difference of 12.450 (95% CI: -27.0, 51.9), when the 2 treatment groups was compared at 
the End of Study using an ANCOVA model on the LOCF with baseline score and age as covariates and sex and 
treatment  as  factors,  was  not  statistically  significant  (P=0.5237).  The  LDS  vocabulary  score  in  the 
2 treatment groups was also compared across time using an ANCOVA mixed model for repeated measures 
with baseline score and age as covariates and sex, treatment, week, and treatment by week interaction as 
factors.  The  treatment  difference  of  13.629  (95%  CI:  -10.0,  37.3)  was  not  statistically  significant 
(P=0.2497). 
•  Change from Baseline in Total and Sub-Scores of QoLCE Scale 
At baseline, the mean total score of QoLCE was comparable between the 2 treatment groups. There were 
little changes from the baseline by the end of treatment, mean (SD) changes at the end of treatment were 
-0.3 (7.87) for rufinamide and 1.4 (1.81) for any other AED.

2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
In order to support the present application to expand the indication of Inovelon to paediatric patients from 
1 year to less than 4 years of age, the MAH made reference to the established benefit-risk profile in patients 
4 years of age and older and the fact that the clinical expression of LGS is similar in the younger population 
compared to older children and adults. Supportive data were available from a multicentre, multiple-dose, 
open-label, randomized, controlled, parallel group study (study 303), which provides a 2-year evaluation of 
the safety, PK, and cognitive/behavioural effects of rufinamide as add-on treatment for control of seizures 
associated with LGS in subjects 1 to less than 4 years of age compared to any other approved add-on AED 
of the investigator’s choice.  
Based on these data as well as pop PK modelling, extrapolation of the efficacy of rufinamide from older 
children and adults to younger children aged 1 to less than 4 years was proposed by the MAH. The CHMP 
agreed that the expression of LGS was similar in the younger population compared to older patients, and 
that there was no reason to expect that the effect of rufinamide on children between the ages of 1 and 
4 years would differ from that in older children and adults, although it was noted that the diagnosis of LGS 
can be challenging in the very young children. Thus, in principle, extrapolation of efficacy as previously 
established in children > 4 years could be acceptable provided an adequate dose can be established (see 
discussion on this aspect in section 2.2. ). 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study 303 was included in the PIP of Inovelon and the design had previously been endorsed as appropriate 
to  demonstrate  the  agreed  objectives.  The  study  aimed  at  to  comparing  the  effect  of  2  drug  regimens 
consisting of either rufinamide or any other approved AED of the investigator’s choice as an add-on to the 
subject’s existing regimen of 1-3 AEDs on the overall safety and tolerability of rufinamide in subjects aged 
1 to less than 4 years of age with inadequately controlled LGS. Other objectives were to characterize age 
group-specific  PK  and  to  evaluate  cognitive  development  and  behavioural  effects  and  other  exploratory 
efficacy variables.  
In study 303, rufinamide  was administered as oral  suspension (40 mg/mL).  During the  Titration Period, 
rufinamide was administered at 10 mg/kg/day (administered in 2 equally divided doses) and the dose was 
increased at 10 mg/kg/day increments every 3 days to 40 mg/kg/day, then increased by 5 mg/kg/day to the 
target maintenance level of 45 mg/kg/day. No dose finding study had been conducted. The choice of the 
dose in study 303 was the same as in study 022, the pivotal trial for the initial approval of rufinamide for use 
as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients 4 years of age and older. 
The diagnosis of LGS was established according to the International League Against Epilepsy’s Classification 
of  Epileptic  Seizures  (ILAE,  2010)  except  for  the  EEG  criteria.  The  ILAE  criteria  were  adapted  from  the 
requirement of presence of slow spike-and-waves and burst of fast rhythms to ‘a clinical diagnosis of at 
screening, which might have included the presence of a slow  background EEG  rhythm, slow spikes-waves 
pattern (<3 Hz), the presence of polyspikes (…)’. This widening of the inclusion criteria was done to account 
for the fact that at such an early age (1 to less than 4 years), diagnosis of LGS can be very difficult due to 
varying  stages  of  brain  maturation  and  disease  development  and  not  all  the  cardinal  EEG  signs  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 41/57 
 
  
  
 
symptoms may be present at the same time in this age group. While the CHMP acknowledged the difficulties 
in diagnosis, the lack of specific EEG requirements created uncertainties in the recruited patient population 
and if patients with other epileptic syndrome than LGS could have been enrolled. To address this concern, 
the MAH retrospectively requested participating study sites to provide EEG documentation. Information from 
27 subjects (72% of all enrolled patients) was received. All of these subjects had EEG and clinical features 
consistent with LGS, which was considered reassuring by the CHMP.  
The  originally  planned  study  size  of  75  patients  was  reduced  to  a  total  of  37  patients  (25  treated  with 
rufinamide) due to difficulties in the recruitment related to the rarity of the condition, the diagnostic process 
specifically in the younger age group and the availability of the product on the market. The difficulties were 
acknowledged by the CHMP; however, the small number of study subjects randomised (and even smaller 
number of subjects completing the 2-year treatment period of 15/24 subjects in the rufinamide group and 
4/12 subjects in the any-other-other AED group) made it difficult to interpret the study results, in particular 
with regards to efficacy.  
Baseline distribution of age was similar in the 2 treatment groups; most subjects were 12 to 35 months old 
(67.6%) and 32.4% were 36 to 48 months old. Time to diagnosis and seizure type were also similar in both 
groups. Types of seizures were comparable in both groups, except for myoclonic seizures that were less 
frequent in percentage in rufinamide group (60.0%) compared to other-AED group (83.3%). In this context, 
the CHMP noted the high number of patients in the study with myoclonic seizures (68%) in the study which 
are  not  frequent  in  typical  LGS  syndrome.  Finally,  most  patients  were  taking  2  (37.8%)  and  3  (45.9%) 
concomitant  AEDs  at  baseline.  Both  treatment  groups  appeared  to  have  a  similar  treatment profile  with 
respect to AEDs other than rufinamide. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
For  the  primary  efficacy  variable,  LS  mean  difference  in  the  CBCL  Total  Problems  Score  compared  to 
baseline, the scores at the Final Visit (Week 106) were comparable in the rufinamide (56.35) and any other 
AED  group  (53.75)  with  slightly  more  problems  for  the  rufinamide  subjects  compared  with  the 
any-other-AED group (LS mean difference [95% CI]: +2.60 [-10.5,15.7]; P=0.6928).  Analyses across time 
(LS mean difference [95% CI]: -1.197 [95% -7.6, 5.3]; P=0.7083) and at the End of Study, based on LOCF 
(treatment difference [95% CI]: -2.776 [-13.3, 7.8]; P=0.5939) were not statistically significant either.  The 
baseline  mean  score  for  the  any  other  AED  group  was  higher  compared  with  the  rufinamide  group 
(62.8 [n=8] versus 56.6 [n=24] with LS mean difference of -5.43). Overall, there was no consistent trend 
for the change from baseline in CBCL Total Problems Score over time. There was also no major trend in mean 
CBCL sub-scores and mean change from baseline in CBCL sub-scores in the 2 treatment groups throughout 
the study. 
Based on the sample size calculation, the CHMP noted that a minimum difference in CBCL Total Problem 
Score of at least 17 in favour of rufinamide was expected. This effect is rather large and a notable difference 
between the expected (-17) and observed (+2.6) outcome for the primary clinical endpoint was apparent. 
Based on the experience from other (not epilepsy) behavior health studies, this change in CBCL total score 
was assumed to bring down the rufinamide score closer to normal values compared to the any other AED 
arm  where  scores  were  expected  to  be  relatively  steady.  However,  it  appears  that  due  to  the  lack  of 
experience with the use of the CBCL scale in the pediatric population recruited in study 303, this difference 
was overestimated and clearly out of reach. There was also a large variability in the scores of some patients 
in both treatment arms during and at the end of treatment. Due to the small size of the study, the results 
were considered inconclusive. 
Exploratory  efficacy  endpoints  included  time  to  withdrawal  from  treatment  because  of  an  AE  or  lack  of 
efficacy, which was 142.0 weeks (median Kaplan-Meier estimate of overall survival) in the rufinamide group 
and 28.0 weeks in the any-other-AED group. However, a time-to-withdrawal analysis taking into account 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 42/57 
 
  
  
2 of the reasons for discontinuation (adverse event and lack of efficacy) was not considered reliable by the 
CHMP. Too few of the targeted events have been observed in the course of the trial (2 discontinuations in 
each arm). In response to a question by the CHMP, new analyses were performed including the taper period 
and considering all subjects who discontinued treatment for any reason (10 in the rufinamide arm and 5 in 
the any other AED arm). In this analysis, the median time-to-withdrawal in the any other AED arm was 62.9 
weeks while it was not reached previously. On the contrary, when limiting the analysis again to AEs and lack 
of  efficacy  as  withdrawal  events  (6  in  the  rufinamide  arm  and  3  in  the  any  other  AED  arm),  no  median 
time-to-withdrawal was reached in the any other AED arm (i.e. less than half of the subjects experienced AE 
or lack of efficacy) while it was 28 weeks in the original analysis. The results were considered difficult to 
interpret and overall inconclusive due to the small size of the trial.  
With regards to seizure outcomes, no statistically significant difference between the 2 treatments groups in 
the percent change in seizure frequency per 28 days relative to baseline was observed. The overall median 
decrease in total seizure frequency from baseline was lower in the rufinamide group (7.05%) than in the any 
other AED group (20.15%). The median difference between the rufinamide group and the any-other-AED 
group was -14.4% (P value= 0.2731). This finding was explained by the MAH by the small size of the trial 
and variability of seizure frequency among different time-points. A comparison of the number of variables 
between the two treatment groups such as individual characteristics, number and type of AEDs at baseline, 
frequency of seizures at baseline, and time in the study did not reveal any other possible cause that account 
for the observed difference. Due to the small size of the study, the results were considered inconclusive. 
Concerning worsening of seizures, in the rufinamide group, 4 of 24 (16.7%) subjects reported a doubling in 
total seizure frequency, 5 of 24 (20.8%) reported a doubling in frequency of major seizures (generalized 
tonic-clonic, drop attacks), and no subjects reported an occurrence of a new seizure type. In the any other 
AED group, 1 of 9 (11.1%) subjects reported doubling in total seizure frequency and 1 of 9 (11.1%) subjects 
reported  a  doubling  in  frequency  of  major  seizures  (generalized  tonic-clonic,  drop  attacks);  no  subjects 
reported an occurrence of a new seizure type.   
The LDS average phrase length did not change notably in either treatment group during the study.  At the 
end  of  the  study,  the  treatment  difference  of  0.194  (95%  CI  -0.4,  0.8)  was  not  statistically  significant 
(P=0.5156).  The  treatment  difference  of  12.450  (95%  CI  -27.0,  51.9)  at  the  End  of  study  in  the  LDS 
vocabulary score was also not statistically significant (P=0.5237). Finally, there were no notable changes 
from baseline in total score of QoLCE. 
2.3.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that the efficacy results of study 303 were largely inconclusive and did not support a 
clinically relevant effect of rufinamide as adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with LGS 
in patients aged 1 to less than 4 years. This was mainly due to the small study size and the fact that the study 
was not adequately powered for the performed efficacy analyses. Nevertheless, given that LGS disease 
expression is similar in younger and older children, extrapolation of efficacy from patients aged > 4 years 
might in principle be accepted. However, this is currently not possible as no adequate dose in patients has 
been established (see details in section 2.2. ).  
2.4.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
The primary safety data supporting the present application are data from study 303. Evaluation of safety 
was performed on the Safety Population. The Safety Set included all enrolled subjects who received at least 
1  dose  of  rufinamide  or  any  other  approved  add-on  AED  of  the  investigator’s  choice  and  had  at  least 
one post-dose safety assessment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 43/57 
 
  
  
Pertinent safety data consisted of previously collected and reviewed data from study 022, the pivotal trial 
supporting the initial marketing authorisation for Inovelon and its use as adjunctive therapy in the treatment 
of seizures associated with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome (LGS) in patients 4 years of age and older, and data 
from study 304, a Phase 3, controlled study in LGS conducted in Japan to support marketing application in 
that country (see Table 3 for an overview of clinical trials). 
In these studies, rufinamide treatment has been associated with CNS adverse reactions including dizziness, 
somnolence,  ataxia  and  gait  disturbances.  Other  important  identified  risks  in  the  RMP  include  status 
epilepticus, rash and hypersensitivity, decreased appetite and weight loss, diplopia and blurred vision and 
vomiting.In  patients  aged  4  years  and  older,  the  most  common  adverse  reactions  observed  at  a  higher 
incidence  than  placebo  in  patients  with  LGS  were  somnolence  and  vomiting  (both  very  commonly).  The 
discontinuation rate in LGS due to adverse reactions was 8.2% for patients receiving rufinamide and 0% for 
patients  receiving  placebo.  The  most  common  adverse  reactions  resulting  in  discontinuation  from  the 
rufinamide treatment group were rash and vomiting.  
A summary of the key findings from study 303 is provided in this chapter. Safety data from study 303 are 
also compared to safety findings in older paediatric subjects 4 to less than 12 years of age from study 022. 
A brief summary of the safety data from study 304 is also given. 
Safety assessments in study 303 consisted of monitoring and recording all AEs and serious AEs (SAEs); 
regular  monitoring  of  haematology,  blood  chemistry  (including  amylase  and  lipase),  and  urine  values; 
periodic measurement of vital signs and ECGs; and performance of physical examinations. 
AEs  were  graded  by  seriousness  and  severity.  Relationship  to  study  treatment  was  assessed  based  on 
temporal relationship of the onset of the event to the initiation of the study treatment, the course of the 
event, especially the effect of discontinuation of study treatment or reintroduction of study treatment, as 
applicable, whether the event was known to be associated with the study treatment or with other similar 
treatments, the presence of risk factors in the study subject known to increase the occurrence of the event, 
and  the  presence  of  non-study,  treatment-related  factors  that  are  known  to  be  associated  with  the 
occurrence of the event. A related AE was considered an event for which a causal relationship between the 
study drug and the AE is a reasonable possibility. 
Patient exposure 
All of the 37 subjects randomized in study 303 received at least 1 dose of study drug and thus together 
constituted the Safety Set (25 subjects receiving rufinamide and 12 subjects receiving any other AED).  
In the rufinamide arm, 22 (88%) of subjects had at least 16 weeks of exposure in the study, 21 (84%) 
subjects had at least 24 weeks of exposure, and 19 (76%) subjects had at least 56 weeks of exposure.  The 
maximum  exposure  to  rufinamide  was  146.1  weeks.  The  total  exposure  to  rufinamide  was 
2191.3 subject-weeks. In the any-other-AED arm, 9 (75%) of subjects had at least 16 weeks of exposure in 
the study, 8 (66.7%) subjects had at least 24 weeks of exposure, and 6 (50%) subjects had at least 56 
weeks  of  exposure.  The  maximum  exposure  to  any-other-AED  was  107.9  weeks.  The  total  exposure  to 
any-other-AED was 653.7 subject-weeks. 
A  total  of  11  (44%)  subjects  had  106  weeks  of  exposure  in  the  rufinamide  arm  compared  to  4  (33%) 
subjects in the any other AED group. The mean duration of exposure was higher in the rufinamide group 
(87.65 weeks) compared with the any other AED group (54.48 weeks).  
The median average daily doses of rufinamide were 328.6 mg during the Titration Period, 518.1 mg during 
the Maintenance Period, and 213.9 mg during the Taper Period.  During the Maintenance Period, 79.2% of 
subjects received rufinamide at a dose of greater than or equal to 40 mg/kg/day.

Adverse events 
Study 303 
The overall incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) was similar in the rufinamide group 
(22 of 25 subjects [88.0%]) and the any other AED group (10 of 12 subjects [83.3%]).   
Common  TEAEs  (occurring  in  ≥10%  of  subjects  in  any  treatment  group)  for  subjects  in  study  303  are 
summarized in Table 10 by Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) System Organ Class (SOC)

The most frequently reported TEAEs in the rufinamide treatment group (occurring in ≥10% of subjects) 
were  vomiting  (28.0%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (28.0%),  pneumonia  and  somnolence  (20.0% 
each), and sinusitis, otitis media, diarrhoea, cough, and pyrexia (16.0% each)  and bronchitis, constipation, 
nasal congestion, rash, irritability, and decreased appetite (12.0% each).  
In  the  any  other  AED  group,  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (33.3%),  diarrhea,  seizure,  and  pyrexia 
(25.0% each), and cough (16.7%) were the most common TEAEs (occurring in >1 subject). 
Approximately half of all subjects in both treatment groups (13 of 25 [52.0%] in the rufinamide group and 
6 of 12 [50.0%] in the any other AED group) experienced TEAEs that were considered by the investigator to 
be possibly or probably related to study drug. Vomiting (5 of 25 [20.0%] subjects) and somnolence (4 of 25 
[16.0%] subjects) were the only treatment-related TEAEs reported in more than 2 subjects in the rufinamide 
group.  Pyrexia  and  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (2  of  12  [16.7%]  subjects  each)  were  the  only 
treatment-related TEAEs reported in more than 1 subject in the any-other-AED group. 
The majority of subjects in both treatment groups had TEAEs that were considered mild (4 of 25 [16.0%] in 
the rufinamide group and 4 of 12 [33.3%] in the any other AED group) or moderate (14 of 25 [56.0%] in the 
rufinamide group and 4 of 12 [33.3%] in the any other AED group) by the investigators. Both groups had 
similar overall incidences of severe TEAEs: 4 subjects (16.0%) in the rufinamide group experienced severe 
TEAEs (1 bronchitis and pneumonia aspiration, 1 encephalitis and pneumonia influenzal, 1 pneumonia, and 
1 weight decreased) and 2 subjects in the any other AED group (16.7%) (1 seizure and 1 rash).  
Study 022 and study 304 
Amongst  the  subjects  4  to  less  than  12  years  of  age  in  study  022,  28  of  31  (90.3%)  subjects  in  the 
rufinamide group and 30 of 33 (90.9%) in the placebo group reported at least 1 TEAE.  
The most frequently reported TEAEs in the rufinamide treatment groups were pyrexia (25.8%), vomiting 
(22.6%),  somnolence  (16.1%),  and  diarrhea  (12.9%).  The  PK  analyses  revealed  that  patients  who 
experienced  somnolence,  vomiting,  pyrexia,  or  diarrhea  did  not  have  higher  rufinamide  exposure  than 
patients who did not experience these AEs. 
For study 304, the incidence of AEs was 93.1% (27 of 29 subjects) in the rufinamide group and 70.0% (21 
of 30) in the placebo group. Frequent AEs that occurred in the rufinamide group were nasopharyngitis (9 of 
29 [31.0%] subjects), status epilepticus (8 of 29 [27.6%] subjects), decreased appetite (6 of 29 [20.7%] 
subjects), somnolence (6 of 29 [20.7%] subjects), and vomiting (5 of 29 [17.2%] subjects). 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious AEs 
Ten (10) of 25 (40.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group and 5 of 12 (41.7%) subjects in the any-other-AED 
group had SAEs.  SAEs reported by more than 1 subject were bronchopneumonia (1 subject in each group), 
seizure (1 subject in the rufinamide group and 3 subjects in the any other AED group), status epilepticus 
(2 subjects  in  the  rufinamide  group),  and  respiratory  distress  (2  subjects  in  the  rufinamide  group  and 
1 subject in the any other AED group).   
Treatment-related  SAEs  occurred  in  3  subjects  in  the  rufinamide  group  (pneumonia  aspiration,  status 
epilepticus, and bronchopneumonia) and 2 subjects in the any other AED group (seizure and lethargy).

Deaths 
In Study 303, an AE leading to death (pneumonia) occurred in 1 subject in the rufinamide group. Study drug 
was taken until death (994 days of treatment). The subject was a 23-month old male child experiencing a 
cough, fever, and being described as sleepy. He was subsequently hospitalized owing to an SAE of severe 
pneumonia and subsequently died despite treatment. The event was considered not related to study drug. 
Other significant AEs 
Other significant AEs were defined as any AEs resulting in discontinuation of study drug, AEs requiring study 
drug  dose  adjustment  or  interruption,  AEs  resulting  in  significant  treatment-emergent  laboratory 
abnormality, AEs associated with overdose and other treatment-emergent events of interest (ie, cardiac and 
ECG). 
A total of 2 of 25 (8.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group and 1 of 12 (8.3%) subjects in the any-other-AED 
group  had  TEAEs  that  resulted  in  discontinuation  from  study  drug.  In  the  rufinamide  group,  1  subject 
discontinued treatment during the Maintenance Phase due to TEAEs of vomiting and decreased appetite and 
1 subject discontinued treatment during the Titration Phase due to a TEAE of vomiting. In the any-other-AED 
group, 1 subject discontinued treatment during the Titration Phase due to a TEAE of rash. Discontinuation 
due to AE was more frequent in the rufinamide group.  
A total of 8 out of the 25 (32.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group and 3 of the 12 (25.0%) subjects in the 
any other AED group had TEAEs requiring study drug dose adjustment or interruption. The most common 
TEAEs  (occurring  in  more  than  1  subject)  in  the  rufinamide  group  resulting  in  dose  adjustment  or 
interruption were weight decreased (2 subjects) and decreased appetite (2 subjects). In the any other AED 
group, seizure (2 subjects) was the only TEAE that occurred in more than 1 subject and resulted in dose 
adjustment or interruption. 
Furthermore, 4 of 25 (16.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group had TEAEs resulting in significant laboratory 
abnormalities, as defined by the statistical analysis plan: blood bicarbonate decreased (2 subjects), blood 
triglycerides increased (1 subject), haemoglobin decreased (1 subject), and hypoglycemia (1 subject). One 
of 12 (8.3%) subjects in the any other AED group had a TEAE of blood bicarbonate decreased.  
Other reported TEAEs of special interest in the rufinamide group were weight loss (2 of 25 [8.0%] subjects), 
skin  reactions  (5  of  25  [20.0%]  subjects),  somnolence  (5  of  25  [20.0%]  subjects),  and  fatigue  (1  of 
25 [4.0%] subjects). Reported TEAEs of special interest in the any other AED group were skin reactions and 
fatigue (1 of 12 [8.3%] subjects each). 
Study 022 and study 304 
Amongst the subjects 4 to less than 12 years of age in study 022, non-fatal SAEs occurred in 1 subject in the 
rufinamide group (diarrhoea, upper respiratory tract infection, and vomiting) and 2 subjects in the placebo 
group (sinusitis in 1 subject and petit mal epilepsy in 1 subject). No SAEs reported in this age group were 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug and none resulted in discontinuation from study 
treatment. 
A total of 3 subjects in the rufinamide group (none in the placebo group) prematurely discontinued due to an 
AE: somnolence (related to study treatment), pneumonia (not related), and dermatitis (related). 
For study 304, non-fatal SAEs of drug eruption occurred in 1 subject each in the rufinamide group and the 
placebo group, both of which were determined by the investigator to be related to study treatment. No other 
SAEs occurred during the study. 
A total of 4 subjects in the rufinamide group and 1 subject in the placebo group had TEAEs that resulted in 
discontinuation of study treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 47/57 
 
  
  
No data had been collected on TEAEs that required study drug dose adjustment or interruption from study 
and on AEs of special importance from either study 022 or study 304. 
No deaths had been reported during study treatment in either study. 
Laboratory findings 
Findings  related  to  marked  abnormal  laboratory  values  are  summarized  below.  A  markedly  abnormal 
laboratory value was defined as, for phosphate, a post-baseline value with an increase from baseline to a 
grade of 3 or more and for all other parameters, a post-baseline value with an increase from baseline to a 
grade of 2 or more as defined in the statistical analysis plan. 
Haematology 
Notably low hemoglobin values were reported for 2 of 25 (8.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group and no 
subjects in the any other AED group.  No other markedly abnormal hematology results were observed. 
Clinical chemistry 
Notably  low  values  were  observed  for  the  parameters  of  bicarbonate  (5  of  25  [20.0%]  subjects  in  the 
rufinamide  group,  4  of  12  [33.3%]  subjects  in  the  any  other  AED  group)  and  glucose  (1  of  25  [4.0%] 
subjects in the rufinamide group, no subjects in the any other AED group).  Notably high values of potassium 
were observed in 2 of 25 (8.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group and no subjects in the any other AED 
group.  No other markedly abnormal clinical chemistry results were observed. 
Urinalysis 
No changes of clinical importance were reported in mean urinalysis values over time, for any parameter.   
Vital Signs, Weight, Physical Examination Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
•  Vitals Signs 
In  the  25  rufinamide-treated  subjects  and  12  subjects  treated  in  the  any  other  AED  group,  notably  low 
values for systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure were observed for 8 (32.0%) and 7 (28.0%) 
subjects  in  the  rufinamide  group  and  1  (8.3%)  and  2  (16.7%)  subjects  in  the  any  other  AED  group, 
respectively. Notably high pulse rates were observed for 12 (48.0%) subjects in the rufinamide group and no 
subjects in the any other AED group.  Although there were single instances of clinically notable high and low 
values for systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and pulse rates, occurring at a similar incidence 
in both treatment groups, none were sustained and none required additional treatment. 
•  Weight 
Notably low and notably high weight values were observed for 7 (28.0%) and 17 (68.0%) subjects in the 
rufinamide group and 1 (8.3%) and 9 (75.0%) subjects in the any other AED group, respectively. Amongst 
the 7 cases of weight loss in the rufinamide group, 3 were considered by the MAH as possibly related to the 
rufinamide treatment. These events were all associated with decreased appetite and/or vomiting, mild or 
moderated in intensity and spontaneously resolved. 
Mean (SD) weight values at baseline for subjects in the rufinamide group and any other AED group were 
12.47  (3.24)  kg  and  13.43  (2.81)  kg,  respectively.    Mean  increases  in  weight  from  baseline  to  end  of 
treatment were observed for subjects in the rufinamide group (2.50 [2.91] kg) and the any other AED group 
(2.79 [3.46] kg).   
• 
ECG and Corrected QT Interval 
There were no clinically important changes in mean ECG parameters from baseline to the end of treatment 
for any treatment group. There were no clinically significant results observed for corrected QT values. 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 48/57 
 
  
  
Study 022 and study 304 
For the subjects 4 to less than 12 years of age in study 022, mean and median changes in haematology, 
chemistry and urinalysis values and vital signs between baseline and the termination visit were small, similar 
in the 2 treatment groups, and not clinically meaningful. There were no data available on laboratory values 
reported as AEs from study 022. Vital sign-related AEs were observed in 1 of 29 subjects in the rufinamide 
group (blood pressure increased) and in 2 of 30 subjects in the placebo group (blood pressure increased and 
blood pressure decreased in 1 subject each). Results were similar between the rufinamide group and the 
placebo group. 
For study 304, there were no serious or significant AEs related to laboratory values. AEs related to laboratory 
values were observed in 1 of 29 subjects in the rufinamide group (gamma-glutamyltransferase increased) 
and  3  of  30  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  (blood  lactate  dehydrogenase  increased,  lymphocyte  count 
decreased,  platelet  count  decreased).  Vital  sign-related  AEs  were  observed  in  1  of  29  subjects  in  the 
rufinamide group (blood pressure increased) and in 2 of 30 subjects in the placebo group (blood pressure 
increased  and  blood  pressure  decreased  in  1  subject  each).  There  were  no  clinically  relevant  percent 
changes  in  any  ECG  variable  in  either  treatment  group.    No  ECG  abnormalities  were  observed  at  any 
assessment time point. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new information in relation to drug-drug interactions was derived from study 303.Analyses from previous 
studies have shown decreased clearance of rufinamide when co-administered with valproic acid. The effect 
of valproic acid on the PK of rufinamide may be clinically relevant in extreme circumstances (e.g., in children 
on high doses of both compounds) and may lead to clinically significant elevation of rufinamide levels (by 
70% or more).  
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
See ‘other significant events’. 
Post marketing experience 
Rufinamide was first approved via the Centralised Procedure on 16 January 2007 (International Birth Date) 
in the EU, for adjunctive therapy in the treatment of seizures associated with LGS in patients 4 years and 
older. Cumulatively, rufinamide 100 mg, 200 mg, and 400 mg tablets have been approved for marketing in 
over  40  countries,  while  rufinamide  40  mg/mL  oral  suspension  has  been  approved  for  marketing  in 
34 countries. Rufinamide is sold under the trade names Inovelon and Banzel. 
Using the available ex-factory sales data on the number of tablets sold and with the defined daily dose for 
rufinamide considered to be 1400 mg (World Health Organization daily average consumption estimate), it is 
estimated  that  from  first  product  launch  through  January  2016,  there  have  been  approximately 
31,000,000 patient-days  of  exposure 
in  countries  where 
rufinamide 
is  marketed, 
including 
29,000,000 patient-days of exposure to the tablet formulation and 2,050,000 for the oral suspension. 
A cumulative search through 07 Jan 2015 of the Eisai rufinamide Global Safety Database (MedDRA version 
8.1) was performed for reports of serious and non-serious adverse post-marketing events which occurred in 
children 4 to 17 years of age as compared to children less than 4 years of age. Since the International Birth 
Date,  there  have  been  26  spontaneous  reports  of  AEs  associated  with  rufinamide  in  children  less  than 
4 years of age and 260 reports in children 4 to 17 years of age. 
Children 4 to Less than 17 Years of Age 
The search returned a total of 260 individual case safety reports including 278 AEs. A total of 92 of the 
163 reports met serious criteria. Most events were reported only once. The most frequently reported events 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 49/57 
 
  
  
were  convulsion  (27  reports),  vomiting  (20  reports),  rash  (13  reports),  nausea  (9  reports),  status 
epilepticus (7 reports), abnormal behavior and decreased appetite (6 reports each). The SAEs reported most 
frequently included convulsion (27 reports), vomiting (10 reports), status epilepticus (7 reports), and rash 
(5  reports).  Most  patients  had  a  complete  recovery  from  the  event.  In  the  reports  where  dosage  was 
provided, 800 mg was the dose at which most patients experienced the event. Latency ranged from 1 day to 
5 years. 
Children 1 to Less Than 4 Years of Age 
The search returned a total of 26 individual case safety reports with 49 AEs. A total of 13 of 26 reports met 
serious criteria. Most events were reported only once. The events reported more than once were convulsion 
(6  reports),  rash  (4  reports),  decreased  appetite  (3  reports),  and  vomiting  (2  reports).  The  only  SAE 
reported more than once was convulsion (6 reports). Most patients had a complete recovery from the event. 
The majority of the reports did not report the dose administered. The latency ranged from 1 day to 420 days. 
During the course of the procedure an update of post-marketing experience was provided for the period of 
08 Jan 2015 through 31 August 2016. In the age group of < 4 year olds, the search revealed 8 reports 
(5 serious)  describing  18  AEs.  One  case  of  rhabdomyolysis  occurred  in  a  3-year  old  male  patient  with 
positive  de-challenge.  The  investigator  classified  the  event  as  possibly  related  to  Inovelon  therapy. 
However, due to a past medical history significant for myotonia and concomitant medications which have the 
potential  to  cause  rhabdomyolysis,  the  role  of  rufinamide  could  not  be  confirmed.  No  other  case  of 
rhabdomyolysis has been reported with rufinamide. 
2.4.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The  safety  of  rufinamide  use  as  adjunctive  therapy  in  the  treatment  of  seizures  associated  with  LGS  in 
patients 4 years of age and older at doses up to 1000 mg/day has previously been evaluated based on data 
from the pivotal trial 022 and was further supported by post-marketing data and data from study 304. The 
safety profile in the proposed extended target population of children aged 1 to 4 years with inadequately 
controlled  LGS  was  evaluated  in  study  303.  In  this  study,  rufinamide  was  given  at  doses  up  to 
45 mg/kg/day,  which  was  compared  to  any  other  AED  at  the  investigator’s  choice.  The  study  provided 
long-term safety data up to 2 years of exposure. However, due to the small size of the trial, only limited 
support could be derived from the data. 
In study 303, the overall incidence of TEAEs was similar in both treatment arms: 22 of 25 subjects (88.0%) 
in the rufinamide group and 10 of 12 subjects (83.3%) in the any other AED group reported TEAEs. The most 
frequently reported TEAEs in the rufinamide group (occurring in ≥10% of subjects) were vomiting (28.0%), 
upper respiratory tract infection (28.0%), pneumonia and somnolence (20.0% each), and sinusitis, otitis 
media, diarrhoea, cough, and pyrexia (16.0% each) as well as bronchitis, constipation, nasal congestion, 
rash, irritability, and decreased appetite (12.0% each). In the any other AED group, upper respiratory tract 
infection  (33.3%),  diarrhoea,  seizure,  and  pyrexia  (25.0%  each),  and  cough  (16.7%)  were  the  most 
common TEAEs (occurring in >1 subject). Approximately half of all subjects in both treatment groups (13 of 
25 [52.0%] in the rufinamide group and 6 of 12 [50.0%] in the any other AED group) TEAEs were considered 
to be possibly or probably related to study drug.  
Reported TEAEs of special interest in the rufinamide group were weight loss (2 of 25 [8.0%] subjects), skin 
reactions (5 of 25 [20.0%] subjects), somnolence (5 of 25 [20.0%] subjects), and fatigue (1 of 25 [4.0%] 
subjects). Reported TEAEs of special interest in the any other AED group were skin reactions and fatigue 
(1 of 12 [8.3%] subjects each). 
The majority of subjects in both treatment groups had TEAEs that  were considered mild (4 of 25 in the 
rufinamide group and 4 of 12 in the any other AED group) or moderate (14 of 25 in the rufinamide group and 
4  of  12  in  the  any-other-AED  group)  by  the  investigators.  Both  groups  had  similar overall  incidences  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 50/57 
 
  
  
severe TEAEs including 4 subjects (16.0%) in the rufinamide group (1 bronchitis and pneumonia aspiration, 
1 encephalitis and pneumonia influenza, 1 pneumonia, and 1 weight decreased). Except for the case that 
have presented encephalitis and pneumonia influenza, the other cases were considered possibly related to 
the study drug.  
SAEs reported by more than 1 subject were bronchopneumonia (1 subject in each group), seizure (1 subject 
in the rufinamide group and 3 subjects in the any other AED group), status epilepticus (2 subjects in the 
rufinamide group), and respiratory distress (2 subjects in the rufinamide group and 1 subject in the any 
other AED group).  Among the SAEs, 5 patients experienced SAEs considered possibly related or related to 
study  drug,  including  3  subjects  in  the  rufinamide  group  (pneumonia  aspiration,  status  epilepticus,  and 
bronchopneumonia) and 2 subjects in the any other AED group (seizure and lethargy). One death occurred 
in the rufinamide group, but this event (pneumonia) was considered not related to study drug.   
No  new  concerns  arose  from  laboratory  values,  vital  signs  and  ECGs  conducted  in  patients  receiving 
rufinamide.  
Overall,  the  data  from  study  303  were  consistent  with  the  known  safety  profile  of  Inovelon.  No  new  or 
unexpected risks were identified. Pneumonia and influenza were already listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC of 
Inovelon as common adverse reactions. Likewise, anorexia, eating disorder, weight decreased, decreased 
appetite and vomiting are known adverse reactions (common or very common) and listed in section 4.8 of 
the SmPC as well as in the RMP as important identified risks. The SmPC furthermore includes a warning in 
relation  to  status  epilepticus  and  possible  treatment  discontinuation  as  cases  of  status  epilepticus  have 
previously been reported in the clinical development involving older children. Precautionary statements in 
the  SmPC  furthermore  refer  to  CNS  adverse  reactions  including  dizziness,  somnolence,  ataxia  and  gait 
disturbances, as well as hypersensitivity reactions including DRESS (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and 
Systemic Symptoms) and Stevens-Johnson syndrome. Status epilepticus, rash and hypersensitivity as well 
as CNS adverse reactions were also recognised as important identified risks in the RMP. 
Post-marketing AEs reported in patients aged less than 4 years were consistent with those events that have 
been seen when rufinamide is used in older patients.  Safety data from Study 304 in Japanese patients also 
did not differ from the known safety profile of rufinamide in LGS patients. 
Finally, in study 303, patients received the approved rufinamide oral suspension, which contains 0.3 mg/mL 
propylparaben. The MAH took the opportunity of this application to address a previous recommendation of 
the  CHMP  to  consider  development  of  a  paraben-free  formulation  due  to  concerns  around  the  potential 
reproductive toxicity of propylparabens in the paediatric population. With reference to the Reflection paper 
on  the  use  of  methyl-  and  propylparaben  as  excipients  in  human  medicinal  products  for  oral  use 
(EMA/CHMP/272921/2012,  adopted  by  CHMP  on  22  Oct  2015),  and  given  that  the  daily  doses  of 
propylparaben in rufinamide oral suspension are 13% to 23% of the acceptable daily intake specified in the 
reflection paper, reformulation of the oral suspension was not considered necessary. This was considered 
acceptable 
by 
the 
CHMP 
in 
line 
with 
a 
previous 
PRAC 
recommendation 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00002671/201601).. 
2.4.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The results of study 303 showed that rufinamide was well tolerated in subjects aged 1 to less than 4 years. 
The safety profile of the younger paediatric subjects revealed no new safety concern compared to the known 
safety profile in older children, adolescents and adults. While the number of patients exposed was too limited 
to allow detection of rare event or realistic frequency estimations, the CHMP was of the view that the totality 
of the available safety data was sufficient to support the present application.

The PSUR cycle remains unchanged. The annex II related to the PSUR refers to the EURD list which remains 
unchanged. 
2.5.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC opinion on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The  PRAC  considered  that  the  risk  management  plan  version  9  is  acceptable.  The  PRAC  endorsed  PRAC 
Rapporteur assessment report. 
The MAH is reminded that, within 30 calendar days of the receipt of the Opinion, an updated version of Annex 
I  of  the  RMP  template,  reflecting  the  final  RMP  agreed  at  the  time  of  the  Opinion  should  be  submitted 
to h-eurmp-evinterface@emea.europa.eu. 
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 9.0 with the following content:

The  PRAC  considered  that  several  preferred  terms  related  to  infections  (i.e  pneumonia,  influenza, 
nasopharyngitis, ear infection, sinusitis and rhinitis) were already listed in section 4.8 of the SmPC with a 
common  frequency.  Based  on  this,  the  risk  of  infections  was  considered  to  be  identified,  rather  than 
potential. However, at the same time, the PRAC considered that the types of infections currently described 
for Inovelon are not key to the benefit risk balance of the product and could be well managed by routine risk 
minimisation activities. It was thus concluded that infections should be removed from the safety concerns in

the  Risk  Management  Plan.  The  MAH  should  continue  to  follow  this  risk,  in  particular  severity  and 
seriousness, through routine pharmacovigilance. 
Pharmacovigilance plan 
There are no ongoing or planned additional pharmacovigilance studies or activities in the Pharmacovigilance 
Plan. 
Risk minimisation measures 
The table of the risk minimisation measures has been updated to reflect the removal of infections from the 
list of safety concerns. 
2.6.  Update of the Product information 
During the course of the procedure, the MAH decided to no longer pursue an extension to the indication. 
However, sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC are still proposed to be updated to reflect relevant 
information in paediatric patients aged 1 to less than 4 years as well as data from juvenile animal toxicity 
studies. The MAH also updated section 5.1 to add additional details relevant to prescribers on the design of 
study 022, which had previously been assessed at the time of the initial marketing authorisation. In addition, 
editorial amendments are proposed in several sections of the Product Information. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the Product Information to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template 
and the SmPC guideline, including the combination of the SmPCs, labelling and Package Leaflets for the 
three authorised strengths of the tablet formulation, which were reviewed and accepted by the CHMP.  
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information 
2.6.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable as the present application did not result in 
major changes to the package leaflet that would affect formatting or readability of the Package Leaflet.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Therapeutic Context 
Disease or condition and available therapies 
LGS is a rare and severe form of childhood epilepsy with an onset typically between the ages of 3 and 
5 years. The disease expression is similar in young children compared to older ones. Prognosis is poor and 
includes varying severity of epilepsy and cognitive deficits, usually in line with static encephalopathy but 
mental retardation may get worse with time. Seizure treatment consists of AED polytherapy, but often 
seizures remain refractory to treatment. The current management of LGS is still not satisfactory and there 
is a therapeutic need especially in younger patients. 
Main clinical studies 
Rufinamide is already authorised for the adjunctive treatment of LGS seizures in patients 4 years of age or 
older based on the result of study 022, which was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, parallel trial comparing the safety and efficacy of rufinamide as add-on therapy relative 
to placebo in subjects aged 4 to 30 years with inadequately controlled LGS.  
With the present application, results from study 303 were provided. Study 303 was a multicenter, 
randomized, controlled, open-label study including a 2-year evaluation of the safety, PK and efficacy of 
rufinamide as add-on treatment for control of seizures associated with LGS in subjects 1 to less than 4 years 
of age compared to any other approved add-on AED of the investigator’s choice. 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The primary efficacy variables in study 303 aiming at investigating cognitive and behavioural effects of 
rufinamide were the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) Total Problems score and change from baseline in CBCL 
Total Problems score at the end of the 2-year (106 weeks) treatment period. LS mean of the CBCL Total 
Problems score for subjects after 2 years of treatment were 53.75 for the any other AED group and 56.35 for 
the rufinamide group (LS mean difference [95% CI] +2.60 [-10.5,15.7]; P=0.6928), and the difference 
between treatments was -2.776 (95% CI: -13.3, 7.8, P=0.5939).  
Given that LGS disease expression is similar in younger and older children, there was no reason to expect 
that the effect of rufinamide on children with LGS between the ages of 1 and 4 would differ from that already 
demonstrated in older children and adults, although it was noted that the diagnosis of LGS can be 
challenging in the very young children. The efficacy of Inovelon in the adjunctive seizure therapy of LGS 
patients 4 years of age or older had already been demonstrated in study 022.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The  originally  planned  study  size  of  75  patients  was  reduced  to  a  total  of  37  patients  (25  treated  with 
rufinamide) due to difficulties in the recruitment related to the rarity of the condition, and the diagnostic 
process specifically in the younger age group.  
In  addition,  the  anticipated  minimum  difference  in  CBCL  Total  Problem  Score  of  at  least  -17  in  favor  of 
rufinamide at the study planning stage was overestimated and clearly out of reach.  A difference of +2.6 was 
in fact observed for the primary clinical endpoint. 
The  small  number  of  study  subjects  randomised  (and  even  smaller  number  of  subjects  completing  the 
2-year treatment period of 15/24 subjects in the rufinamide group and 4/12 subjects in the any-other-other 
AED group) made it difficult to interpret the study results, in particular with regards to efficacy, and the 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 54/57 
 
  
  
efficacy results of study 303 were therefore largely inconclusive. 
Extrapolation of efficacy from patients aged 4 years and older to the proposed extended age range of 1 to <4 
year olds depended on the population PK analyses aiming at establishing a suitable dose in the latter age 
range. A coarse model was initially selected for the PK analysis based on data from LGS patients. While the 
CHMP appreciated that a more complex model was not feasible due to the scarcity of the underlying data 
(115 patients), such model did not allow testing for differences in absorption, distribution and elimination by 
age  and  would  not  lead  to  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  PK  changes  by  age.  Furthermore,  no 
exposure-response relationship was evidenced in young children.  
In response to these concerns, a new PK model based on a larger dataset (1182 subjects, including data 
from healthy volunteers and patients with other forms of epilepsy) was provided. However, while in principle 
such enlarged model could bring useful information on rufinamide PK in children below the age of 4 years, 
the  model  as  presented  at  the  time  of  this  report  was  not  considered  mature  enough  for  comparative 
dose-exposure  analyses  across  age  groups.  Several  issues  with  the  final  model  including  the  lack  of 
addressing  dose  dependency  of  absorption  and  prediction  power  had  not  been  adequately  addressed. 
Likewise, a discrepancy between the coarse and the new enlarged model with regards to CL/F was noted that 
could not be explained by differences in the two model population characteristics. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Study 303 provided up to 2 years of exposure data and the safety evaluation revealed no new safety concern 
in patients aged 1 to less than 4 years with seizures associated with LGS compared to the established safety 
profile in older patients. In patients aged over 4 years, the most commonly reported adverse reactions were 
headache, dizziness, fatigue, and somnolence. The most common adverse reactions observed at a higher 
incidence than placebo in previous studied in LGS patients were somnolence and vomiting.  
In  study  303,  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  in  patients  exposed  to  ralfinamide  were  vomiting 
(28.0%),  upper  respiratory  tract  infection  (28.0%),  pneumonia  and  somnolence  (20.0%  each),  and 
sinusitis, otitis media, diarrhoea, cough, and pyrexia (16.0% each) as well as bronchitis, constipation, nasal 
congestion, rash, irritability, and decreased appetite (12.0% each). Similar to previous studies in patients 
aged 4 years and older, the majority of TEAEs in study 303 were mild to moderate in severity. Rufinamide 
was  generally  well  tolerated.  There  were  no  new  pertinent  data  concerning  dermatological  events  and 
hypersensitivity or status epilepticus. Other important identified risks in the RMP also remained unchanged, 
including  decreased  appetite  and  weight  loss,  coordination  abnormal  (ataxia),  somnolence,  dizziness  / 
vertigo, diplopia and blurred vision, and vomiting. Overall, adverse reactions observed in study 303 were 
already adequately covered by the current safety information in the product information and the RMP.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
While the safety profile of rufinamide observed in study 303 was consistent with the previously established 
profile in older patients, the study size was very small, which is explained by the rarity of the disease. The 
number  of  patients  exposed  was  thus  too  limited  to  allow  detection  of  rare  event  or  realistic  frequency 
estimations. 
Benefit-Risk Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
While the efficacy results of study 303 were difficult to interpret and largely inconclusive, mainly due to the 
small study size, the CHMP noted that LGS disease expression was similar in younger patients compared to 
older ones and thus, there was no reason to expect that the effect of rufinamide in children between the ages 
Assessment report  
EMA/18473/2017 
Page 55/57 
 
  
  
of 1 and 4 years would differ from that already demonstrated in older children and adults. As a consequence, 
efficacy as established in the adjuvant therapy of seizures in patients ≥ 4 years affected by LGS could in 
principle be extrapolated to patients aged <4 years, provided the dose was established. A population 
modelling approach was used to characterize the PK profile of rufinamide in subjects with inadequately 
controlled LGS and to compare exposure in the paediatric population aged 1 to less than 4 years to older 
patients. However, the available models at the time of this report were not considered suitable to generate 
reliable exposure predictions, which would have been needed to derive sound dose recommendation in the 
new proposed age group. The CHMP recommended for the MAH to advance the knowledge of PK properties 
of the product and re-develop a qualified/validated population PK model with an adequate predictive power 
to describe the PK of rufinamide in children. The systemic exposure in young children 1-2 years and 2-4 
years should be estimated accordingly and compared to that observed in older children to inform any dose 
recommendation below 4 years of age. 
In terms of safety, rufinamide was well tolerated in subjects 1 to less than 4 years of age. The findings of the 
safety evaluation in study 303 were consistent with the known safety profile of rufinamide established in LGS 
patients aged 4 years and older. No new or unexpected risks were identified.  
Benefit-risk balance 
As a consequence of the outstanding concerns with the population PK simulations at the time of this report, 
the CHMP was of the view that the available comparative dose-exposure analyses across age groups were 
not reliable enough to derive sound dose recommendations in the new proposed age group of 1 to <4 year 
olds. For this reason and since the results of study 303 were largely inconclusive with regards to efficacy, the 
CHMP considered that a positive benefit-risk balance of rufinamide in the add-on treatment of seizures in 
LGS patients aged 1 to <4 years could not be concluded at this point in time.  
In light of the CHMP view at the time of this report, the MAH decided to no longer pursue an extension of the 
indication and the outstanding issues with the model were not further addressed. However, the application 
to  update  the  product  information  with  relevant  paediatric  data  was  maintained,  which  was  considered 
acceptable  by  the  CHMP.  The  CHMP  furthermore  recommended  that  the  MAH  should  re-develop  a 
qualified/validated population PK model. 
The benefit-risk balance of Inovelon in the approved indication in patients 4 years of age and older with LGS 
remained positive.

Update of sections 4.2, 4.8, 5.1, 5.2 and 5.3 of the SmPC in order to include additional information relevant 
to the paediatric population based on the results of study 303 in patients aged 1 to less than 4 years with 
Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome and the results from toxicity studies in juvenile animals. Section 5.1 was 
furthermore updated to add additional information on the design of study 022 in LGS patients aged 4 years 
and older. Additional editorial amendments were made to SmPC sections 4.4 and 4.6. The Package Leaflet 
has been updated accordingly. Furthermore, the PI was brought in line with the latest QRD template and the 
SmPCs, Labelling and Package Leaflets for the three authorised strengths of the tablet formulation were 
combined. An updated RMP version 9.0 was agreed as part of the procedure. 
The variation leads to amendments to the Summary of Product Characteristics, labelling and Package Leaflet 
and to the RMP. 
Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0116/2016 and the results of these studies are reflected in the SmPC and, as 
appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

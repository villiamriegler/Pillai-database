are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

Of the provided 13 ICSR forms of the cumulative cases of 
to add a new warning on intestinal perforation and to 
add gastrointestinal perforation to the list of adverse 
drug reactions (ADRs) with frequency rare as 
requested by the PRAC in procedure 
EMEA/H/C/002490/LEG/015, the Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the list of local representatives 
in the Package Leaflet. 
intestinal perforation seven were considered possibly 
related to linaclotide, for one case a causal relationship 
could not be excluded but data were lacking for a proper 
assessment, four were not assessable due to lack of 
information, and for two cases it was not quite clear 
whether they are cases at all as it was uncertain if 
intestinal perforation happened at all under treatment. It 
was considered that linaclotide, due to its mechanism of 
action inducing movement of the intestine and based on

new additional data submitted by the MAH 
the course of the events which, in some of the provided 
case reports, suggested a temporal relation could be a 
trigger for intestinal perforation in patients with localized or 
diffuse weakness of the intestinal wall. These patients 
should be advised to seek immediate medical care in case 
of severe, persistent or worsening abdominal pain and 
linaclotide should be discontinued if these symptoms occur.

In Study LIN-PK-01 linaclotide and its active metabolite 
results of Lactation study 1915-7/LIN-PK-01 listed as 
a category 3 study in the RMP; this is a an open-
label, multiple-dose, milk-only lactation study in 
lactating women receiving linaclotide therapeutically. 
The Package Leaflet is updated accordingly. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
(MM-419447) were below the quantitation limit in the 
breast milk of lactating women studied. Given the 
minimal/negligible oral bioavailability of linaclotide, the 
large molecular size of linaclotide and its metabolite it is 
reasonable to conclude, that breastfed infants do not 
receive linaclotide or its metabolite through breast milk and 
therefore, no pharmacological activity of linaclotide and its 
metabolite are expected in breastfed infants. Constella can 
be used during breast-feeding.

Utilization Study in Selected European Populations” 
listed as a category 3 study in the RMP. This is a rug 
Utilisation Study (DUS) addressing the following 
safety concerns: 
- The potential for off-label use and abuse/excessive 
use 
- Extent of use in pregnancy and lactation, and male 
patients 
- Assess the extent of off-label use and the extent of 
use in males and in pregnant females 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
diagnosed with IBS was high with regard to abuse or 
excessive use in two of the three countries. On the other 
hand, the majority of patients either switched or 
discontinued treatment. Discontinuation occurred mainly 
after the first prescription and discontinuation might be a 
consequence of diarrhoea development. Accordingly, no 
additional risk minimisation measures are recommended at 
this point in time due to the self-limiting (trial and error) 
nature of the off-label use. 
The study results indicate that linaclotide is prescribed only 
very rarely to pregnant women (˂ 0.5% in all countries) 
and with regard to lactation it was not possible to identify 
cases, as there are no diagnostic codes specific for this in 
use. Males accounted for 13.7%, 14.3% and 18.9% users 
in the UK, Spain, and Sweden respectively. The gender 
distribution of linaclotide users appears to match the 
clinical trials.

SmPC, Annex 
The safety and efficacy of clopidogrel have been 
II, Labelling 
demonstrated by several large clinical studies. A literature 
and PL 
review was performed and no significant new efficacy or 
effectiveness information was identified that could possibly 
alter the effectivess of this agent for the authorized 
indications and treatment regimen. The beneficial effect of 
clopidogrel remains in line with that of the originator 
product, and is considered positive. 
The CHMP therefore recommended that the Marketing 
Authorisation for Grepid can be renewed with unlimited 
validity.

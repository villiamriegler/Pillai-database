2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
2.1.1.  Problem statement 
Disease or condition 
16 September 2021 
Gastric cancer (GC) is the 5th leading cancer and the 3rd leading cause of cancer-related deaths 
worldwide1. Oesophageal cancer is the 7th leading cancer and the 6th leading cause of cancer-related 
deaths worldwide. GC/gastric oesophageal junction carcinoma (GEJC)/oesophageal adenocarcinoma 
(OAC) remain a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with an estimated 1 million 
deaths worldwide in 2018.2 
Adenocarcinoma is the most common (> 90%) histological subtype for GCs worldwide and OAC has 
increased in North America and Europe (EU)3,4. GEJC anatomically straddles the distal oesophagus and 
proximal stomach and due to its location and the same adenocarcinoma histology, GEJ tumours are

frequently grouped together with GC. Advanced or metastatic OAC, GEJC, and GC are considered 
similar diseases and the same treatment approach is recommended.5,6,7,8,9 
GC, including GEJ carcinoma, is a heterogeneous disease with several established risk factors, 
including environmental, genetic, and behavioural risks. The aetiology of this disease is complex and 
multifactorial. Environmental and lifestyle factors such as Helicobacter pylori infection, smoking, high 
salt intake, low vegetable intake, and obesity have been associated with GC. There has been a steady 
decline in GC mortality attributable to dietary and lifestyle changes worldwide and to decreasing 
infection with H. pylori, which is considered the main cause in Asian countries. However, the incidence 
of GEJ tumours has increased in the US and Europe (~35%) considerably due to increases in risk 
factors such as obesity and gastroesophageal reflux disease, while remaining only 20% in Asian 
countries. 
OAC predominantly occurs in patients with chronic gastro-oesophageal reflux disease and their risk is 
correlated with the patient’s body mass index with a higher risk for obese persons. OAC is three to four 
times as common in men as it is in women.  
Claimed therapeutic indication 
The new claimed indication for OPDIVO is:  
-  OPDIVO in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based combination chemotherapy, 
is indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with HER2-negative advanced or 
metastatic gastric, gastro oesophageal junction or oesophageal adenocarcinoma whose 
tumours express PD-L1 with a combined positive score (CPS)≥5. 
Proposed dosage and administration: 
The recommended dose is 360 mg nivolumab administered intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes in 
combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based chemotherapy Q3W or 240 mg nivolumab 
administered IV over 30 minutes in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based 
chemotherapy Q2W (see Section 5.1 of the SmPC). Treatment with nivolumab is recommended until 
disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or up to 24 months in patients without disease progression.  
Management 
Platinum compounds (oxaliplatin and cisplatin) and fluoropyrimidines (5-fluorouracil [5-FU], 
capecitabine, and tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil potassium [S1]) are considered first-line standard-of-care

treatments for metastatic GC/GEJC/OAC across geographic regions.10,11,12,13,14 With GC/GEJC/OAC, 
different survival outcomes have been reported across regions; the median OS ranges from 12 to 14 
months in Asian countries and from 8 to 11 months in the United States (US) and Europe.15,16,17 
In the past decade, multiple new investigational drugs with mainly molecular targets have been 
investigated in the first-line setting as add-ons to backbone platinum and fluoropyrimidine treatment. 
These agents, with the exception of trastuzumab, which targets and benefits only the human 
epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-positive population (approximately 20% of subjects are 
HER2 positive in first-line GC/GEJC), have failed to show a survival benefit in randomized trials. 
Trastuzumab + chemotherapy provided an improvement in survival over chemotherapy in subjects 
who were HER2 positive; at a median follow up of 17.1 months, median OS was 13.5 vs. 11.0 months 
(HR = 0.74).18 
To date, no immunotherapy agents with or without chemotherapy have been approved for the first-line 
treatment of GC/GEJC/OAC in the EU.

2.1.2.  About the product 
OPDIVO (nivolumab) is a human immunoglobulin G4 (IgG4) monoclonal antibody (mAb), which binds 
to the programmed death-1 (PD-1) receptor and blocks its interaction with PD-L1 and PD-L2. The PD-1 
receptor is a negative regulator of T-cell activity that has been shown to be involved in the control of 
T-cell immune responses. Engagement of PD-1 with the ligands PD-L1 and PD-L2, which are expressed 
in antigen presenting cells and may be expressed by tumours or other cells in the tumour 
microenvironment, results in inhibition of T-cell proliferation and cytokine secretion. Nivolumab 
Assessment report

potentiates T-cell responses, including anti-tumour responses, through blockade of PD-1 binding to PD-
L1 and PD-L2 ligands. In syngeneic mouse models, blocking PD-1 activity resulted in decreased tumour 
growth. 
In the EU nivolumab as monotherapy has been approved for the treatment of melanoma, non-small 
cell lung cancer (NSCLC), renal cell carcinoma (RCC), classical Hodgkin’s lymphoma (cHL), squamous 
cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN), urothelial carcinoma, oesophageal squamous cell 
carcinoma (OSCC), and adjuvant treatment of oesophageal or gastro-osesophageal junction cancer 
(OC or GEJC) (OPDIVO SmPC). The combination of nivolumab with ipilimumab (Yervoy) has been 
approved for the treatment of melanoma, RCC, malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM) and colorectal 
cancer (CRC) and in combination with ipilimumab and platinum-based chemotherapy for the first-line 
treatment of metastatic NSCLC. The combination of nivolumab with cabozantinib has been approved 
for the treatment of RCC. 
2.1.3.  The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
The MAH did not seek scientific advice at the CHMP concerning the current procedure. 
2.1.4.  General comments on compliance with GCP  
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which is considered acceptable. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Nivolumab is a protein composed of natural amino acids. Proteins are expected to biodegrade in the 
environment and not be a significant risk. As a protein, nivolumab is exempt from preparation of an 
Environmental Risk Assessment under the 1 June 2006 “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/S/4447/00). Nivolumab and the 
product excipients do not pose a significant risk to the environment. 
2.2.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH.

BMS-Sponsored Phase 3 Study Supporting the Proposed Indication of Nivolumab + 
Chemotherapy for the Treatment of GC/GEJC/EAC 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
PK analytical methods 
Pre-study validation 
In support of study CA209649, human serum samples for nivolumab were analyzed at either PPD, Inc. 
(Richmond, VA) or at WuXi AppTec (Shanghai, P. R. China; for subjects from China) using validated 
ECL Methods, ICD 416 or 14BASM122, respectively.  
In-study validation 
The details of the assay and sample analysis as well as management details are provided in the 
respective bioanalytical reports. 
Clinical Study CA209649 
For both methods, the quantification of BMS-936558 in human serum samples was performer by ECL 
Method over a quantitative range of 0.2 μg/mL and 6.5 μg/mL. In addition, each batch consisted of 
one set of standards [0.100 (anchor), 0.200, 0.300, 1.000, 2.500, 4.000, 5.500 and 6.500 μg/mL] and

two sets of three QCs (0.600, 1.500 and 4.800 μg/mL) and 3 sets of DQC (for study sample which 
requires dilution).  
PPD Project RHDS Bioanalytical Report 
Sample analysis for the quantification of BMS-936558 in human serum samples was performed at PPD 
Laboratories, 2244 Dabney Road, Richmond, Virginia 23230 (804) 359-1900, USA from January 15th, 
2018 to June 10th, 2020. 
A total of 3842 samples were received and 3825 samples were analysed (17 samples were not 
analysed per protocol SOP) in 183 bioanalytical runs (175 runs met the acceptance criteria). Out of 
3825 samples, 3787 samples were reported and 38 samples were not reported in data transfer files 
(sample outstanding reconciliation with Watson database).  
The between-run precision (%CV) and accuracy (%Bias) of the calibration curve standards ranged 
from 0.945% to 4.92% and from -0414% to 3.98%, respectively. A total of seven calibration 
standards were rejected. In all valid runs, no more than one was rejected at the same run. In three 
runs the ULOQ and in one run the LLOQ was rejected. 
The between-run precision (%CV) and accuracy (%Bias) of the QCs ranged from 5.28% to 6.36% and 
from 0.706% to 6.93%, respectively (including all QCs). A total of fifteen QCs was outside the 
acceptance range. In all valid runs, no more than two QCs was outside the acceptance range at the 
same run, and not at the same concentration level. 
A total of 326 samples were re-analysed due to the following reasons: sample result above upper limit 
of ULOQ, diluted sample quantitated below limit of quantitation, inadvertently re-assayed at incorrect 
dilution, re-assayed inadvertently (for all these samples the original values were reported), limit of 
quantitation (LLOQ) raised due to deletion of calibration standard and confirmatory potential 
quantitating pre-dose. 
A total of 441 samples were subjected for ISR. Out these, 434 samples met the ISR acceptance criteria 
(± 30%), which has resulted in 98.4% ISR pass rate for study samples.  
The maximum storage for samples was 1690 days at nominally -80 ºC. The long-term stability of 
nivolumab in human plasma covers 2373 days at nominally -80 ºC. 
WuXi AppTec Study Number: 400040-181151-PSA 
Sample analysis for the quantification of BMS-936558 in human serum samples by ECL Method over a 
quantitative range of 0.2 μg/mL and 6.5 μg/mL was performed at WuXi AppTec in Shanghai from July 
25th, 2019 to May 25th, 2020. 
A total of 599 samples were analysed in 26 bioanalytical runs (all runs met the acceptance criteria) and 
all of them were reported. 
The between-run precision (%CV) and accuracy (%Bias) of the calibration curve standards ranged 
from 0.4% to 2.0% and from 0.0% to 3.0%, respectively. No calibration curve standard was rejected. 
The between-run precision (%CV) and accuracy (%Bias) of the QCs ranged from 4.4% to 5.5% and 
from -7.5% to -2.6%, respectively). No QC was outside the acceptance range 
A total of 51 samples were re-analysed due to sample result above ULOQ (48 samples) and sample re-
assayed inadvertently (3 samples; for these samples the original values were reported), 
A total of 60 samples were subjected for ISR. All the samples met the ISR acceptance criteria (± 
30%), which has resulted in 100.0% ISR pass rate for study samples.

were covered by 2373 days of long-term stability at nominal at -70 ºC. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Pharmacokinetic data from Study CA209649 were pooled with data from 6 other studies for an updated 
PPK analysis. In total, the updated PPK dataset included data from 1825 subjects with either 2L NSCLC 
(reference population), 1L GC/GEJC/EAC, 2L+ GC, or other solid tumours from a total of 7 studies in 
which subjects received nivolumab monotherapy or nivo+chemo.

Base model 
A previously developed 2L+ GC monotherapy final PPK model was revised and used as the base model 
for this updated analysis. The 1L GC/GEJC/EAC data, as a new patient population, was incorporated 
into the base and full model to obtain unbiased estimates of the magnitude of covariate effects on 
model parameters. Nivolumab PK, including data in 1L GC/GEJC/EAC, was well described by a linear 2 
compartment model with time-varying CL in the full model. 
The base model was a 2-compartment, zero-order IV infusion with time-varying elimination. The 
parameters of this model were re-estimated with the inclusion of data from Study CA209649. Log-
normal random effects were estimated for CL, VC, and VP, a normally distributed random effect on 
Emax, and a correlation between the CL and VC random effects. The base model included covariate 
relationships between BBWT, BGFR, BALB, PS, sex, race, baseline LDH, tumour burden, and subject 
population and time-varying CL; BBWT and sex on VC as described in Section 4.1.1.1. Covariate 
relationships between BBWT and Q, and BBWT and VP were assumed to be identical to the 
relationships between BBWT and CL, and BBWT and VC. Parameter estimates and standard errors for 
this base model are presented in Table 5.1.1.1-1.

No covariates were found to have a clinically meaningful effect on nivolumab PK in this updated 
analysis. Graphical representations of the effect of categorical and continuous covariates on the typical 
value of the structural model parameters of CL, volume of central compartment (VC), and CLss/CL0 
(EXP[EMAX]) are presented in Figure 3.1.1-1. All covariate effects were within ± 20% boundaries, 
except for the effect of baseline body weight on CL and VC and baseline albumin (ALB) on CL. Baseline 
body weight was associated with a 26% increase in CL and a 22% increase in VC in subjects with 95th 
percentile weight relative to subjects with median body weight. Nivolumab CL increased approximately 
31% in subjects with 5th percentile baseline ALB relative to subjects with median baseline ALB value. 
However, the magnitudes of body weight, VC, and ALB effect on CL were consistent with findings of 
previous analyses. These findings were not considered to be clinically relevant, as the 95th percentile 
body weight or 5th percentile ALB only resulted in approximately 18.5% or 21.4% lower Cavgss, 
respectively, relative to those observed in subjects with median body weight or median ALB at baseline 
in Study CA209649.

A CPH model was developed to describe the relationship between nivolumab Cmin1 or Cavg1 and the 
hazard of disease progression or death in all randomized subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 from the 
nivo+chemo (n= 434 [nivolumab 240 mg + FOLFOX n=218; nivolumab 360 mg + XELOX n=216]) and 
chemo (n=481 [FOLFOX n=253; XELOX n=228]) arms in CA209649.  
Figure 3.2.1.2-1 is a graphical presentation of all of the estimated effects in the Cmin1-PFS (A) and 
Cavg1-PFS (B) full models, showing the HR of PFS across the covariate ranges and the associated 95% 
CIs, relative to the median value (for continuous covariates except exposure) or reference group (for 
categorical covariates). The effect of nivolumab exposure on HR of PFS was calculated relative to the 
corresponding chemotherapy only arm (nivolumab 360 mg + XELOX Q3W versus XELOX; nivolumab 
240 mg + FOLFOX Q2W versus FOLFOX). The findings from the Cmin1-PFS and the Cavg1-PFS models 
were generally consistent.  
The effect of chemotherapy on PFS was evaluated in an E-R PFS model; XELOX was suggested to be a 
significant predictor (95% CI did not include 1) with a slightly higher risk than FOLFOX as backbone 
chemotherapy (Figure 3.2.1.2-1). The interaction term between chemotherapy and nivolumab 
exposure was also tested and was not kept in either full model, as it did not reduce BIC. 
PFS HRs favored (HR < 1) nivo+chemo compared to chemo within the exposure range produced by the 
2 nivolumab dosing regimens (Figure 3.2.1.2-1). Both Cmin1 and Cavg1 were identified as significant 
predictors (95% CI did not include 1) for PFS, because chemotherapy control arm data were included, 
and exposure in the model represented the nivolumab treatment effect. The effect of Cavg1 on the HR 
of OS (0.988) (refer to Table 5.1.1.2-1 in the E-R Analysis Report) was slightly flatter as compared to 
that of Cmin1 (0.981) (refer to Table 5.1.1.1-1 in the E-R Analysis Report). The magnitude of 
treatment effect on PFS was similar for the 2 nivolumab dosing regimens. Although increasing 
nivolumab exposure appeared to be associated with numerically smaller HRs of PFS (Figure 3.2.1.2-
1),the predicted PFS HR (95% CI) for nivolumab 360 mg + XELOX Q3W overlapped between the 5th 
and 95th percentile of Cmin1 and Cavg1 (Table 3.2.1.2-1); the predicted OS HR (95% CI) for 
nivolumab 240 mg + FOLFOX Q2W overlapped between the 5th and 95th percentile of Cavg1 (Table 
3.2.1.2-1).

A CPH model was developed to describe the relationship between daily Cavg and time to first 
occurrence of Gr 2+ IMAEs in all treated subjects from the nivo+chemo (n= 725 [nivolumab 240 mg + 
FOLFOX n=392; nivolumab 360 mg + XELOX n=333]) and chemo (n=767 [FOLFOX n=406; XELOX

Figure 3.2.2.1-1 is a graphical presentation of all the estimated effects in the full model, showing the 
HR of Gr 2+ IMAEs across the covariate ranges and the associated 95% CIs, relative to the median 
value (for continuous covariates except exposure) or reference group (for categorical covariates). The 
effect of nivolumab log daily Cavg on HR was calculated relative to the corresponding chemotherapy 
only arm (360 mg Q3W nivolumab + XELOX versus XELOX; 240 mg Q2W nivolumab + FOLFOX versus 
FOLFOX).  
Log daily Cavg was identified as a significant predictor (95% CI did not include 1) in E-R safety 
modeling for Gr 2+ IMAE, because chemotherapy control arm data were included, and exposure in the 
model represented the nivolumab treatment effect.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Both analytical methods used for the quantification of BMS-936558 in human serum samples in 
support of study CA209649 were previously assessed. Since the data were obtained within a study 
from two different laboratories comparison of those data was performed by a cross validation. The 
outcome of the cross validation show that the obtained data were reliable and they can be compared 
and used. All study samples analysed at both sites and reported for nivolumab (BMS-936558) were 
covered by 2373 days of long-term stability at nominal at -70 ºC. 
Both in-study validations show acceptable calibration standards and QCs. The reasons for the re-
analysis of samples are considered acceptable. For samples re-assayed inadvertently, the original 
values were reported. Incurred Sample Reproducibility was performed at both sites and the reanalysis 
confirms the validity and performance of the Analytical Method Procedure for all analytes.  
The MAH has conducted a Phase 3 study (CA209649) to characterize the pharmacokinetics, 
immunogenicity, and exposure-response relationship of nivolumab in subjects with advanced or 
metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, or esophageal adenocarcinoma 
(GC/GEJC/EAC) to support the administration of nivolumab 240 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) or nivolumab 
360 mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) intravenous (IV) in combination with fluoropyrimidine and platinum-
containing chemotherapy (hereafter referred to as nivo+chemo) for first-line (1L) treatment.  
The modelling strategy consisted in a pooled analysis of PK data in subjects with 1L GC/GEJC/EAC from 
Study CA209649 and data from other relevant nivolumab monotherapies, across multiple tumour 
types, which is endorsed. The pooled analysis offered the advantage of a solid, robust and precise 
estimation of the PK properties of nivolumab (parameters and covariate effects) and allowed to identify 
differences in PK elements due to disease type. The updated population PK model adequately 
characterized the time-course of nivolumab in patients with 1L GC/GEJC/EAC based on the GOF, pc-
VPC and parameter estimates.  
No covariates were found to have a clinically meaningful effect on nivolumab PK in the updated 
analysis. Graphical representations of the effect of categorical and continuous covariates on the typical 
value of the structural model parameters of CL, volume of central compartment (VC), and CLss/CL0 
(EXP[EMAX]) are presented in Figure 3.1.1-1. All covariate effects were within ± 20% boundaries, 
except for the effect of baseline body weight on CL and VC and baseline albumin (ALB) on CL. Baseline 
body weight was associated with a 26% increase in CL and a 22% increase in VC in subjects with 95th 
percentile weight relative to subjects with median body weight. Nivolumab CL increased approximately 
31% in subjects with 5th percentile baseline ALB relative to subjects with median baseline ALB value. 
However, the magnitudes of body weight, VC, and ALB effect on CL were consistent with findings of 
previous analyses. These findings were not considered to be clinically relevant, as the 95th percentile 
body weight or 5th percentile ALB only resulted in approximately 18.5% or 21.4% lower Cavgss,

respectively, relative to those observed in subjects with median body weight or median ALB at baseline 
in Study CA209649.  
A forest plot (Figure 3.1.1-1 above) has been provided to assess the clinical relevance of the covariates 
selected based on the change on main PK parameters, suggesting differences in general less than 20% 
in PK values. Predicted exposure metrics were evaluated across different body weight stratified for 
each regimen, showing a slightly higher exposure for patients with low body weight and lower 
exposure levels in patients with higher body weight and no differences in exposure due to the schedule 
administered. Similar exposure was predicted between both regimens for each sub-group of body 
weight category.  
The immunogenicity evaluation revealed the lack of any clinical concern in terms of differences in 
clearance or exposure. The incidence of immunogenicity is of minor relevance.  
The exposure-efficacy relationship has been established to characterize the probability of OS and 
predict at the proposed dosing regimens. The forest plot analysis of the Hazard Ratio for the two 
exposure parameters Cave1 and Cmin1, suggested a better efficacy in subjects with higher nivolumab 
exposures although the point estimate of the Hazard ratio remained < 1 even for subjects with low 
nivolumab exposures (5th percentile). Since only one dose level was evaluated, the confounding effect 
of disease/health condition on exposure cannot be distinguished, and hence the exposure-efficacy 
analyses should be cautiously interpreted. 
The exposure-safety analysis characterized the probability of Gr2+ imAE for the proposed dosing 
regimens (nivolumab 240mg Q2W +FOLFOX and nivolumab 360 mg Q3W + XELOX). The results show 
higher probability (21-26%) of Gr2+ imAE and roughly no differences between the proposed dosing 
regimens.  
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology properties of nivolumab for the adjuvant treatment of patients with 
advanced or metastatic gastric cancer, gastroesophageal junction cancer, or esophageal 
adenocarcinoma (GC/GEJC/EAC) have been adequately characterized through a pooled analysis using 
previous clinical data together with experimental evidence from study CA209649. The population PK 
model, which shares the same structural elements as previous submissions, adequately describes the 
experimental data. The exposure-response analysis should be interpreted with caution, since only one 
dose level was evaluated and different populations were considered, where confounding factors (effect 
of disease/health conditions) may affect.

Biomarkers 
Subjects were enrolled regardless of tumour cell PD-L1 expression. Per revised Protocol 07 (included 
Amendment 23 dated 14-Sep-2018, “Protocol amendments” below), the primary population was 
changed to subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5, however, stratification by tumour cell PD-L1 remained 
unchanged. 
An archival (or fresh) formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissue block or 20 unstained tumour 
tissue sections (with an associated pathology report) were required to be collected within 6 months 
prior to enrolment. No systemic therapy (e.g. adjuvant or neoadjuvant chemotherapy) was to be given 
after the sample was obtained. Tissue was required to be from a core needle, excisional or incisional 
biopsy. An optional fresh biopsy at the time of suspected tumour progression might also have been 
collected. 
Tumour cell PD-L1 
Tumour cell PD-L1 at 1% cut-off was one of the stratification factors. Tumour tissue specimens were 
sent to the central lab (LabCorp Center for Molecular Biology and Pathology [CMBP] in North Carolina, 
USA or Covance Shanghai) for PD-L1 testing during the screening period. Tumour cell PD-L1 
expression was defined as the percent of tumour cells with membrane staining in a minimum of 100 
evaluable tumour cells per validated Agilent/Dako PD-L1 IHC 28-8 pharmDx test according to the 
manufacturer’s instructions with the DAKO Autostainer Link-48 system. 
Assessment report  
EMA/556100/2021  
Page 44/158 
 
 
 
 
PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS): 
CPS was generated centrally by rescoring the tumour cell PD-L1 stained slides using the central lab 
DAKO CPS algorithm. CPS is a scoring algorithm taking into account immunoreactivity for PDL1 in both 
tumour cells and tumour associated immune cells (restricted to lymphocytes and macrophages) within 
or directly associated with tumour cell strands. As such, CPS is the number of PD-L1 positive cells 
(tumour cells, lymphocytes and macrophages) divided by the total number of viable tumour cells 
within the evaluated tumour area, multiplied by 100. Although the calculation might have been greater 
than 100, the maximum CPS is defined as 100. 
Microsatellite Instability (MSI)  
MSI status was determined retrospectively on pre-treatment FFPE tissues using the Idylla™ MSI Test 
by a central laboratory. The Idylla™ MSI Test is an automated PCR based qualitative test and 
determines microsatellite stability/instability through mathematical scoring related to the detection of a 
novel panel of seven monomorphic biomarkers: ACVR2A, BTBD, DIDO1, MRE11, RYR3, SEC31A, and 
SULF2. The Idylla™ MSI Test reports results as microsatellite stable (MSS), microsatellite instability 
high (MSI-H), or invalid in cases where the MSI status of tested samples cannot be reliably 
determined. 
Sample size 
This section summarizes power calculation of the primary endpoints of PFS and OS per the last revised 
protocol before the database lock (DBL) (Revised Protocol 09 [Amendment 29]). The study enrolment 
was completed prior to Revised Protocol 09 based on the sample size as determined by the original 
design assumptions. This revision changed the final PFS and interim OS analyses to be conducted at a 
minimum follow-up time of 12 months and final OS analysis at a minimum follow-up time of 24 months 
after the last subject was randomized. Under the assumption that the prevalence of PD-L1 CPS ≥5 was 
35%, it was estimated that the primary population would consist of 554 subjects concurrently 
randomized to the nivo+chemo and chemo arms. The hazard ratio (HR) for PFS was modelled as a 2-
piece hazard ratio with a delayed effect (HR=1) of the first 3 or 6 months followed by a constant HR of 
0.56 thereafter. With a type I error of 2% at 12 months minimum follow-up, the expected number of 
PFS events was estimated to be 497 for a 3-month delay and approximately 99% power; or 506 for a 
6-month delay and approximately 60% power.  
For OS, the HR was modelled as a 2-piece hazard ratio, a delayed effect with a HR of 1 vs. 
chemotherapy for the first 6 months followed by a constant HR of 0.65 thereafter. At 24 months 
minimum follow-up at final analysis, it was expected that 466 events would be observed providing an 
adequate power of approximately 85% with a type I error of 3% (two-sided).  
The actual observed prevalence of PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 was 60% in the locked database of 10-Jul-2020 
among the randomized subjects pooled over the 3 treatments arms. Therefore, prior to the DMC 
efficacy review meeting and unblinding of BMS study team, the power for PFS and OS were updated 
using this actual prevalence of PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 (reflected in statistical analysis plan [SAP] V4.0 
Appendix 5). Based on randomization schema, the primary population would consist of 949 subjects 
concurrently randomized to nivo+chemo and chemo. Using the same PFS model as in the design, with 
3 months or 6 months delayed treatment effect, the expected number of PFS events would be 841 and 
857, with corresponding power of 99.9% and 84%, respectively. For OS, the expected number of 
events, using the same model as in the design, was 800 events providing a power of 97.9%.

Randomisation 
Once enrolled in Interactive Web Response System (IWRS), subjects who had met all eligibility were 
randomized 1:1 to treatment with either nivo+ipi or chemo per original study design, with stratification 
by tumour cell PD-L1 expression level (≥1% vs. < 1% or indeterminate), region (Asia vs. North 
America [US and Canada] vs. rest of the world) and ECOG performance status (0 vs. 1). After 
implementation of Revised Protocol 02 (Amendment 08), subjects were randomized 1:1:1 to treatment 
with either nivo+ipi, nivo+chemo, or chemo, with the above 3 original stratification factors and the 
choice of chemotherapy regimen (XELOX vs. FOLFOX) as an additional stratification factor. As of 05-
Jun-2018, the nivo+ipi arm was closed to enrolment per DMC recommendation and, following 
implementation of Revised Protocol 06 (Amendment 20), subjects were then randomized 1:1 to 
treatment with either nivo+chemo or chemo.

The trial is open-label. 
Statistical methods 
The initial study SAP version 1.0 was finalized on 25-Apr-2017. Version 2.0 of the SAP reflected the 
changes according to the Revised Protocol 09 (Amendment 29) and was issued on 02-Dec-2019. 
Version 3.0 was finalized on 03-Jun-2020, prior to the CSR DBL (10-Jul-2020) and introduced 
additional sensitivity analyses for PFS and OS. The final version 4.0 was issued on 05-Aug-2020, this 
version introduced one additional Appendix 5 to the SAP reflecting the expected number of events for 
PFS and OS in the primary population based on the actual prevalence of PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 rather than the 
assumed prevalence used in previous versions of the SAP. 
Type I error control 
The hierarchical testing strategy as per the last SAP described in Figure 2 ensures control of family-
wise error rate (FWER) at a 2-sided significance (alpha) level of 5 % for the primary and key 
secondary endpoints.  
For the dual primary endpoints of PFS and OS in the comparison of nivo+chemo vs. chemo in 
randomized subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5, a 2-sided significance level of 2% was allocated to PFS and 
3% was allocated to OS. If the OS comparison in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 between nivo+chemo 
vs. chemo was significant, then OS in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 and OS in all randomized were 
planned to be sequentially tested at a 2-sided 1.5% significance level.

For OS in PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5, 1 and all randomized subjects, the significance levels at the interim and final 
analyses were obtained following group sequential design using the Lan-DeMets alpha spending 
function with O’Brien-Fleming type boundary. At the time of the interim analysis, the significance level 
was based on actual OS events observed and the estimated final number of events. At the final 
analysis, the significance level will be calculated using the number of events in the database at the 
time of database lock (DBL) with consideration of the alpha already spent at the interim analysis. For 
the interim analysis of OS in randomized subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1 and all randomized subjects, the 
significance levels were obtained using the same information fraction as the randomized subjects with 
PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5.

The dual primary endpoints of PFS by BICR and OS for subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 were compared 
between nivo+chemo and chemo arms using a 2-sided stratified log rank test. The estimate of the 
hazard ratio between treatment groups was calculated using a stratified Cox proportional hazards 
model, with treatment as the sole covariate. Ties were handled using the exact method. Confidence 
intervals (CIs) adjusted for the corresponding significance level for the hazard ratio were provided.  
The PFS and OS function for each treatment group was estimated using the KM product limit method 
and displayed graphically. Two-sided 95% CI for the median in each treatment group were obtained 
via the log-log transformation method. PFS and OS rates at fixed time points (depending on the 
minimum follow-up) were presented along with their associated 95% CIs. These estimates were 
derived from the Kaplan Meier estimate and corresponding CIs were derived based on the Greenwood 
formula for variance derivation and on log-log transformation applied on the survivor function. 
Stratification factors for stratified analyses were region (Asia vs. North America [US and Canada] vs. 
ROW), ECOG PS status (0 vs. 1), chemotherapy regimen (XELOX vs. FOLFOX), and TC PD-L1 (≥ 1% vs. 
< 1% or indeterminate) as recorded in the interactive response technology (IRT).

Results 
Participant flow 
The clinical cut-off occurred on 27-May-2020 (last patient last visit [LPLV]) and database lock occurred 
on 10-Jul-2020. Minimum follow-up (date of the last subject randomized to LPLV) for all randomized 
subjects in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms was 12.1 months.  
A total of 1581 subjects were concurrently randomized in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms: 789 to the 
nivo+chemo arm and 792 to the chemo arm; see figure below. 1549 subjects were treated: 782 with 
nivo+chemo and 767 with chemo. 32 subjects were randomized but not treated (7 in the nivo+chemo 
arm and 25 in the chemo arm). Of the 1549 treated subjects, 123 (7.9%) subjects were continuing in 
the treatment period at the time of database lock: 84 (10.7%) nivo+chemo subjects and 39 (5.1%) 
chemo subjects.  
Participant Flow Chart - Concurrently Randomized Subjects in the Nivo+Chemo and Chemo Arms in 
CA209649 
The overall rates of treatment discontinuation were 89.3% and 94.9% in the nivo+chemo and chemo 
arms, respectively.  
• 
The primary reason for not continuing the treatment period was disease progression in both 
treatment arms (1043 subjects, 67.3%): 515 (65.9%) nivo+chemo-treated subjects and 528 
(68.8%) chemo-treated subjects.  
•  Subjects who discontinued due to study drug toxicity were 60 (7.7%) and 40 (5.2%) subjects 
in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively.

•  61 (3.9%) subjects overall withdrew consent and did not complete the treatment period: 20 
(2.6%) in the nivo+chemo arm and 41 (5.3%) in the chemo arm.

Recruitment 
This study was conducted at 175 sites in 29 countries (Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, 
China, Colombia, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Israel, Italy, Japan, 
Mexico, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Russian Federation, Singapore, Spain, 
Taiwan, Turkey, United Kingdom, and United States [US]). 
Enrollment in CA209649 started in Oct-2016 for the nivo+ipi and chemo arms and enrollment in the 
additional nivo+chemo arm started in Mar-2017. Enrollment to the nivo+ipi arm was closed in Jun-
2018 (per Revised Protocol 06/Amendment 20) as recommended by the DMC; however, enrollment 
continued in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms.

Protocol amendments 
The original protocol for this study was dated 04-May-2016. The original study design compared 
nivo+ipi vs. chemo (XELOX or FOLFOX) with OS in subjects with tumour cell PD-L1 ≥ 1% as the 
primary endpoint. As of the 10-Jul-2020 DBL, there were 29 amendments to the protocol (including 9 
global amendments and 20 country specific amendments), many of which were based on emerging 
data external to the CA209649 study. A description of the 9 global protocol amendments and the key 
study design changes are provided in Table 4.

than 20%) is a better predictor of 
efficacy. Increased sample size in 
order to have sufficient robust 
analyses at different PD-L1 cutoffs. 
Accepted the following DMC 
recommendation: “Due to the concern 
of the observed increased early death 
rate in nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm 
as well as the increased toxicity rate, 
the DMC recommends to stop the 
future enrollment of the nivolumab 
plus ipilimumab arm. The current 
patients who are already in the 
nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm should 
continue as planned, as should the 
other two arms.”  
CA209032 (internal data available: 
Mar-2018),* KEYNOTE-059 5, (data 
available: Jun-2018 at ASCO)* and 
KEYNOTE-061 (data available: Jun-
2018 at ASCO)* data suggested PD-L1 
CPS as a better predictor for efficacy 
than TC PD-L1. 
The number of subjects in the nivo+ipi 
arm was less than targeted due to the 
early closure of enrollment. Moving the 
OS endpoint for nivo+ipi vs. chemo to 
a secondary endpoint allocated more 
alpha to the primary endpoints for 
nivo+chemo vs. chemo. 
Limited the primary endpoints to PFS 
and OS for nivo+chemo vs. chemo in 
order to have robust analyses for the 
primary endpoints. 
Initial monitoring of PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 
prevalence in a pooled blinded fashion 
indicated that the prevalence was 
lower than the assumed 35% (internal 
data from CA209649 available for the 
first 203 subjects: Nov-2018).*

Protocol deviations 
Relevant protocol deviations are those that are related to inclusion or exclusion criteria, study conduct, 
study management, or subject assessment that were programmable and could potentially affect the 
interpretability of study results.  
Overall, relevant protocol deviations (at study entry and on-treatment) were reported in a total of 21 
(1.3%) randomized subjects: 10 (1.3%) in the nivo+chemo arm and 11 (1.4%) in the chemo arm. The 
most common relevant protocol deviation in the nivo+chemo arm was prohibited anti-cancer therapy 
while on-treatment reported in 8 (1.0%) of subjects. The most common relevant protocol deviations in 
the chemo arm were baseline ECOG > 1 at study entry and prohibited anti-cancer therapy while on 
treatment, both reported in 4 (0.5%) of subjects.

Primary endpoints 
OS in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 
In all randomized subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5, nivo+chemo demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in OS compared with chemo: HR = 0.71 (98.4% CI: 0.59, 0.86); stratified log-rank test 
p-value < 0.0001. Median OS (95% CI) was longer in the nivo+chemo arm compared with the chemo 
arm: 14.39 (13.11, 16.23) vs. 11.10 (10.02, 12.09) months. 
OS rates (95% CI) were higher in the nivo+chemo arm compared with the chemo arm: 81.4% (77.5, 
84.6) vs. 74.8% (70.6, 78.5) at 6 months and 57.3% (52.6, 61.6) and 46.4% (41.8, 50.8) at 12 
months. At database lock (minimum follow-up 12.1 months), 34.7% and 24.9% of all randomized 
subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively, were censored for OS. 
147/473 (31.1%) and 90/482 (18.7%) subjects are either continuing on-treatment or in follow-up in 
the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively.

0.83) 
stratified analysis based on the first 420 randomized subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5: HR = 0.70 
(98.4% CI: 0.53, 0.92). Stratified analysis based on the population with the first 354 events 
among all randomized subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5: HR = 0.64 (98.4% CI: 0.49, 0.83). These 
analyses were conducted to reflect the OS analysis planned under Revised Protocol 07. 
In a multivariate analysis of OS, the treatment effect of nivo+chemo vs. chemo was consistent with 
the primary OS analysis when adjusted for the baseline factors listed below (HR = 0.71; 95% CI: 0.61, 
0.84; multivariate Cox model p value < 0.0001): age (< 65 vs. ≥ 65), sex (male vs. female), primary

Overall in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5, 37.2% and 40.2% of subjects in the nivo+chemo and chemo 
arms, respectively, received subsequent cancer therapy. In the nivo+chemo arm, 33.4% received 
subsequent systemic therapy; this included 1.3% who received subsequent immunotherapy, 13.1% 
who received targeted therapy, and 31.9% who received subsequent chemotherapy. In the chemo 
arm, 38.6% received subsequent systemic therapy; this included 8.7% who received subsequent 
immunotherapy (7.7% who received subsequent anti-PD-1 therapy), 14.1% who received targeted 
therapy, and 36.7% who received subsequent chemotherapy. 
PFS per BICR (Primary Definition) in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 
In all randomized subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5, nivo+chemo demonstrated a statistically significant 
improvement in PFS per BICR (primary definition) compared with chemo: HR = 0.68 (98% CI: 0.56, 
0.81); stratified log-rank test p-value < 0.0001. Median PFS (95% CI) was longer with nivo+chemo 
compared with chemo: 7.69 (7.03, 9.17) vs. 6.05 (5.55, 6.90) months, respectively. 
PFS rates were higher with nivo+chemo compared with chemo: 62.4% vs. 50.1% at 6 months, 
respectively, and 36.3% vs. 21.9% at 12 months, respectively. At database lock, 30.7% and 27.4% of 
randomized subjects in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively, were censored for PFS (see 
Table S.5.24.1 for the reasons for censoring). 
Separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves favouring nivo+chemo over chemo occurred at approximately 2 
months, with increased separation over time.

Other secondary endpoints  
PFS per BICR in All Randomized Subjects 
In all randomized subjects, an improvement of PFS per BICR (primary definition) was observed with 
nivo+chemo compared with chemo (pre-specified but not formally tested): HR = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.68, 
0.87). Median PFS (95% CI) was longer with nivo+chemo compared with chemo: 7.66 (7.10, 8.54) vs. 
6.93 (6.60, 7.13) months, respectively. 559 (70.8%) and 557 (70.3%) subjects in the nivo+chemo vs. 
chemo arms respectively had an event. PFS rates were higher with nivo+chemo compared with 
chemo: 62.6% vs. 55.7% at 6 months, respectively, and 33.4% vs. 23.2% at 12 months, respectively.  
Separation of the Kaplan-Meier curves favouring nivo+chemo over chemo occurred at approximately 2 
months, with increased separation over time.  
Analysis of PFS per BICR using the secondary PFS definition (HR = 0.77; 98% CI: 0.67, 0.87), was 
consistent with the analysis using the primary PFS definition.

Results for PFS per investigator assessment were consistent with those for PFS per BICR. Median PFS 
by investigator (primary definition) was consistent with that reported by BICR, with median (95% CI) 
PFS of 7.52 (6.97, 8.34) months for nivo+chemo and 6.31 (5.68, 6.93) months for chemo (HR = 0.75, 
95% CI: 0.67, 0.84) 
ORR in All Randomized Subjects 
At baseline, 603 subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 608 subjects in the chemo arm had measurable 
disease per BICR. In all randomized subjects with measurable disease, an improvement in BICR-
assessed ORR was observed in nivo+chemo over chemo: 58.0% (95% CI: 54.0, 62.0) vs. 46.1% 
(95% CI: 42.0, 50.1); odds ratio = 1.61 (95% CI: 1.28, 2.02). 
The magnitude of benefit in ORR was consistent per Investigator assessment (ORR difference of 10.9% 
[95% CI: 5.9, 16.0]), though ORR rates were lower (52.2% [95% CI: 48.4, 55.9] for nivo+chemo vs. 
41.1% [95% CI: 37.4, 44.8] for chemo), driven by lower CR rates (4.5% vs. 1.3%). PR rates were 
consistent with BICR assessment.

Patient-Reported Outcomes (PRO) – All randomised subjects (Exploratory endpoints) 
Questionnaire completion rates were acceptable, with ≥ 90% of subjects completing assessments at 
baseline and ≥ 80% at most time points during the treatment period. 
Time to Disease-Related Symptom Deterioration - All Randomized Subjects 
Symptom deterioration was defined as a clinically meaningful decline in GaCS score (worsening from 
baseline ≥ 8.2 points) during the treatment period. Subjects without deterioration while on treatment 
were censored at the last GaCS assessment.  
A total of 194/789 subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 193/792 subjects in the chemo arm 
experienced a disease-related symptom deterioration event. Median time to symptom deterioration 
(TTSD) in all randomized subjects was not reached (95% CI: 22.64, N.A.) in the nivo+chemo arm and 
was 21.03 months (95% CI: 12.45, N.A.) in the chemo arm. Subjects in the nivo+chemo arm had a 
decreased risk (HR: 0.77, 95% CI: 0.63, 0.95) of deterioration compared to subjects in the chemo 
arm. 
EQ-5D-3L Descriptive System and Utility Index  
Mean baseline EQ-5D-3L UI scores in all randomized subjects were similar in the nivo+chemo (0.7339, 
SD: 0.2611) and chemo (0.7404, SD: 0.2398) arms. Subjects in the nivo+chemo arm had 
improvement in mean UI scores at all on-treatment assessments after baseline through Week 103 (last 
time point with N ≥ 10). The mean change from baseline met or exceeded the minimum important 
difference (MID) (≥ 0.08 points) at Weeks 91, 97, and 103. Subjects in the chemo arm had 
improvement in mean UI scores at most on-treatment assessments, with the mean change from 
baseline exceeding the MID at Week 97. 
There was a decrease from baseline (worsening) that approached or exceeded the MID for both arms 
at most follow-up visits.

Mean baseline EQ-5D-3L VAS scores in all randomized subjects were similar in the nivo+chemo (71.8, 
SD: 17.9) and chemo (71.8, SD: 18.2) arms. Overall, the mean EQ-5D-3L VAS scores in all 
randomized subjects increased (improved) over time in both arms. The mean change from baseline in 
the nivo+chemo arm met or exceeded the MID (≥ 7 points) at all the time points where there were 
≥ 10 subjects eligible to respond, starting at Week 85. The mean change from baseline did not meet or 
exceed the MID for the chemo arm.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Through the current variation application, the MAH is seeking approval for a new indication for OPDIVO, 
for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced or metastatic gastric (GC), gastro oesophageal 
junction  (GEJ)  or  oesophageal  adenocarcinoma  (OAC)  in  combination  with  fluoropyrimidine  and 
platinum-based combination chemotherapy.  
The  evidence  in  support  of  the  claimed  indication  is  based  on  results  from  the  study  CA209649 
(CheckMate 649).  
Design and conduct of clinical studies  
The  study  CA209649  is  a  Phase  3,  randomised,  multicentre,  open-label  study  of  nivolumab  plus 
ipilimumab  or  nivolumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  (oxaliplatin  plus  fluoropyrimidine)  versus 
chemotherapy  (oxaliplatin  plus  fluoropyrimidine)  in  subjects  with  previously  untreated  advanced  or 
metastatic  GC,  GEJ  cancer  or  OAC.  The  nivolumab  plus  ipilimumab  arm  was  closed  to  enrolment  per 
DMC recommendation due to an increased early death rate and toxicity, although subjects randomized 
to  this  arm  continued  to  receive  treatment  with  study  drugs  per  protocol.  Data  from  the 
nivolumab+ipilimumab arm have not been provided with the current application.  
The study was open-label, but considering one of the primary endpoints was overall survival (OS) and 
progression free survival (PFS) was assessed by a BIRC, this is considered acceptable.

Patient population 
Overall,  the  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  for  study  CA209649  appear  acceptable.  Patients  with 
advanced  or  metastatic  GC,  GEJ  or  distal  oesophageal  carcinoma  with  histologically  confirmed 
predominant  adenocarcinoma  who  were  treatment  naïve  for  advanced  or  metastatic  disease,  with  an 
ECOG  performance  status  or  0  or  1  were  included  in  the  study.  Prior  adjuvant/neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy, radiotherapy and/or chemoradiotherapy for GC or GEJ were allowed. This was also the 
case for OAC patients who were only eligible for enrollment in study CA209649 after the revised Protocol 
04 (dated 05-Jan-2018). Patients with known HER2-positive status as well as those with untreated CNS 
metastases were excluded. 
Patients were included in the study regardless PD-L1 expression. However, tumour tissue was required 
for PD-L1 expression determination by a central lab. Patients with non-evaluable results were not allowed 
to enter the study.  
Treatments 
Treatment  recommendations  for  advanced  or  metastatic  GC,  GEJ  and  OAC,  are  almost  the  same, 
therefore,  the  inclusion  of  these  different  types  of  tumours  in  the  study  is  considered  acceptable. 
Regimens  including  platinum  compounds  (oxaliplatin  or  cisplatin)  plus  fluoropyrimidine  (capecitabine, 
fluorouracil) are considered the standard of care in the first-line setting in patients HER2-negative (ESMO 
2016; NCCN 2020). Moreover, oxaliplatin may be preferred over cisplatin due to lower toxicity (NCCN 
2020). Therefore, the comparator (i.e., XELOX or FOLFOX) is considered acceptable.  
In study CA209649 patients were randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive nivolumab + ipilimumab for 4 
cycles  followed  by  nivolumab  monotherapy;  nivolumab  plus  chemotherapy  (XELOX  or  FOLFOX)  or 
chemotherapy  (XELOX  or  FOLXOX).  According  to  the  protocol,  the  investigator  can  choose  either 
capecitabine or fluorouracil, based on local standards. Nivolumab was administered at a dose of 360 mg 
Q3W when administered in combination with XELOX (oxaliplatin + capecitabine) and at a dose of 240 
mg  Q2W  when  administered  in  combination  with  FOLFOX  (oxaliplatin  +  leucovorin  +  fluorouracil). 
Treatment  with  nivolumab  was  continued  until  progressive  disease,  unacceptable  toxicity,  withdrawal 
consent or up to a maximum of 24 months. 
The  randomisation  was  changed  twice  during  the  trial.  The  trial  initially  had  two  arms,  i.e.  a 
nivolumab+ipilimumab  arm  and  a  chemotherapy  arm.  Later,  on  07  Dec  2016, 
the 
nivolumab+chemotherapy arm was added. As outlined above enrolment in the nivolumab+ipilimumab 
arm was stopped on 5 Jun 2018 following a recommendation from the DMC due to the observed increased 
early death rate and the increased toxicity rate in that arm. 
Stratification factors included the chemotherapy regimen (XELOX vs. FOLFOX), PD-L1 expression (≥1% 
vs. <1% or indeterminate), region (Asia vs. North America vs. rest of the world) and ECOG (0 vs. 1). 
Stratification factors are considered acceptable. 
Sample size 
Sample size was changed during the study several times (e.g., Protocol 02, 05, 08) from originally 1,349 
to  2,005  in  total  based  on  different  choice  of  primary  analysis  population  (e.g.  all  comers,  TC  PD-L1 
≥1%, PD-L1 CPS≥5) and different timing of analysis (event or time driven).  
The  sample  size  at  the  final  Protocol  09  was  based  on  simulations  assuming  a  piecewise  exponential 
curve for PFS and OS in CPS≥5 in the chemotherapy arm, accounting for a delay in treatment effect. 
Assumptions of PFS were: a chemotherapy median of 5.5 months; HR=1 for 3 months (yielding 99% 
power) or 6 months (yielding 60% power) followed by HR=0.56 afterwards. For OS the power was 85% 
based on a chemotherapy arm median of 11 months; HR=1 for 6 months followed by HR=0.65.

Efficacy endpoints 
The dual primary endpoints of the study were OS and PFS as assessed by BIRC per RECIST 1.1 criteria 
in patients with PD-L1 CPS≥5. Secondary endpoints included OS in patients with PD-L1 CPS≥1, CPS≥10 
and  all  randomised  subjects;  PFS  as  assessed  by  BIRC  in  patients  with  PD-L1  CPS≥1,  10  and  all 
randomised  subjects  and  ORR  (by  BIRC)  in  subjects  with  PD-L1  CPS≥1,  5,  10  and  all  randomised 
subjects.  Duration  of  response,  time  to  symptom  deterioration  (TTSD),  PFS  and  ORR  according  to 
investigator assessment and PFS2 were exploratory endpoints in study CA209649.  
The choice of the primary and secondary endpoints is considered appropriate. However, several major 
changes in the endpoints as well as in the primary efficacy population were performed during the study 
(see protocol amendments below). 
Statistical methods 
The primary endpoints changed during the trial (see details below). Throughout the protocol changes, 
the different primary OS and possibly PFS type endpoints were analysed using a two-sided stratified log-
rank test and a stratified Cox model with treatment as only covariate. Randomisation stratification factors 
included  region,  ECOG  and  PD-L1  ≥1  in  all  protocols.  Since  the  addition  of  the  nivolumab  + 
chemotherapy arm (Protocol 02), the chemotherapy chosen before randomization (XELOX or FOLFOX) 
was  added  as  stratification  factor.  Concurrent  randomized  patients  were  used  for  nivolumab  + 
chemotherapy  arm  vs.  the  chemotherapy  arm  comparison  (i.e.  since  the  start  of  the  1:1:1 
randomisation). 
The OS in all comers in the nivolumab + chemotherapy arm vs. the chemotherapy arm (introduced since 
Protocol 02), was in most protocols not a primary endpoint, but in all protocols its analysis was stratified 
by region, ECOG, type of chemotherapy and PD-L1 status. 
Multiple  testing  strategy  changed  during  the  study  (see  below)  but  were  variants  of  the  graphical 
approach  (Bonferroni  splits,  hierarchical  testing  and  alpha  allocation).  Therefore,  each  of  the  various 
strategies per se controlled the type I error.  
The primary PFS definition censored for subsequent therapy. A secondary definition of PFS included the 
first  PFS  event  regardless  including  when  it  occurred  after  start  of  new  therapy  from  SAP  version  2 
onwards (Protocol 09).  
Time to event endpoints (e.g. OS and PFS)  were analysed using Kaplan-Meyer methodology and Cox 
proportional hazard models. Sensitivity analyses were planned regarding the impact of: non-proportional 
hazards (a max combo test to account for early or late separation of curves or analysing in two separate 
periods);  disbalance  in  (possible)  prognostic  factors  (multivariate  Cox  regression  models);  imbalance 
between the CPS strata (multivariate Cox regression); stratification (e.g. unstratified analyses).  
Binary endpoints (e.g., ORR): the stratified difference was estimated using DerSimonian-Laird method; 
the stratified odds ratio using the Mantel-Haenszel method. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
A total of 2,687 patients were enrolled in the study, of whom 1,581 were randomised to receive either 
nivo+chemo (n=789) or chemo (n =792). According to the MAH, the frequency of subjects enrolled 
but not randomized, i.e. 1,106 not randomized out of the 2,687 enrolled subjects in the CA209649 
Primary CSR (41.2%), is an overestimate that does not reflect the actual screen failure rate as 
subjects were randomized to 3 treatment arms. The screen failure rate for the entire study was 36.3% 
(1,155/3,186 enrolled subjects). Among the 1,155 subjects who were not randomized the most 
frequent reason was “subject no longer meets study criteria.” This group consists of 900 subjects and 
the most common failed study criteria among them were: i) having known human epidermal growth 
Assessment report

Page 91/158 
 
 
 
 
factor receptor 2 (HER2) positive status [130 (14.4%)], ii) not providing tumour tissue for biomarker 
analyses [130 (14.4%)] and iii) having (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) score ≥2 [108 (12.0%)]. 
There were 32 patients who were randomised but not treated, most of them in the control arm (25 
[3.2%] vs. 7 [0.9%]) and in most cases due to withdrawal of consent.  
At  the  time  of  the  data  cut-off,  around  8%  of  patients  remained  on  treatment  (84  [10.7%]  in  the 
nivo+chemo arm and 39 [5.1%] in the chemo arm). The main reason for treatment discontinuation was 
disease  progression  in  both  treatment  arms  (66%  nivo+chemo  vs.  69%  chemo).  In  the  nivo+chemo 
arm  there  were  20  (2.6%)  patients  who  discontinued  treatment  due  to  completion  of  the  2-year 
treatment period. 
Conduct of the study 
One of the main concerns of the study relates to the multiple and critical amendments of the protocol 
which call into question the integrity of the trial moreover considering that study CA209649 is open label 
and therefore more prone to bias. The original protocol was dated 4 May 2016 and thereafter 29 protocol 
amendments (including 9 global and 20 country specific) have been performed. The main critical changes 
are described below. 
The original study design aimed to compare nivolumab + ipilimumab with chemotherapy, but early in 
the study (Protocol 02; dated 7 Dec 2016) a new nivolumab-plus-chemotherapy arm was added. This 
change  was  performed  when  only  3  patients  had  been  enrolled.  At  the  same  time,  the  type  of 
chemotherapy  (i.e.  XELOX  vs.  FOLFOX)  was  introduced  as  stratification  factor  (determined  before 
patients  were  randomized).  This  strengthens  the  comparison.  Before  the  randomization  changed  to 
1:1:1, a total of 83 patients had already been randomized. However, the nivolumab + chemotherapy vs. 
chemotherapy comparison is only based on patients that were randomized since the introduction of this 
arm, which is methodologically sound. The primary endpoint (at that time) was OS in all PD-L1+ subjects.  
With Amendment 17 (Protocol 04; dated 5 Jan 2018), the primary efficacy population was changed to 
all  comers  and  PFS  and  ORR  were  added  as  primary  endpoints  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm.  Moreover, 
patients with distal oesophageal adenocarcinoma (OAC) were also allowed to enter the study.  
As previously mentioned, the sample size has been modified several times. 
Further, per Protocol 07 (Amendment 23; dated 14 Sep 2018) the primary population was changed to 
subjects with PD-L1 CPS≥5 when 1,449 patients had been randomised. CPS was defined as the number 
of  PD-L1  positive  cells  (tumour  cells,  lymphocytes  and  macrophages)  divided  by  the  total  number  of 
viable tumour cells, multiplied by 100 (i.e. CPS is a composite score that incorporates both tumour and 
tumour-associated immune cell PD-L1 expression). As scoring could be done retrospectively and blindly, 
this is considered acceptable.  
According to the Applicant, the change in the primary efficacy population was based on external data 
(i.e.  studies  KEYNOTE  059,  KEYNOTE  061  and  CA209032).  While  the  rationale  for  using  PD-L1  CPS 
instead of TC PD-L1 as a  better predictor or response could be understood (Kelly. Am Soc  Clin Oncol 
Educ Book. 2017), further justification was required regarding the chosen cut-off (i.e. CPS≥5). The MAH 
provided  some  additional  details  regarding  that  their  choice,  as  outlined  above,  was  only  based  on 
external  data,  i.e.  results  from  study  CA209032  and  other  CPS  data  available  at  that  time  from  the 
literature (KEYNOTE-059 and KEYNOTE 061). The selected cut-off CPS≥5 can be considered reasonable 
even  if  others,  e.g.  CPS≥10  could  also  have  been  considered.  Additional  aspects  such  as  expected 
prevalence could also have played a role in the final decision, favouring a lower cut-off.  
The prevalence of subjects with PD-L1 CPS≥5 was initially not accurately known (estimated at 35%) and 
the possibility that an increase in sample size could be needed was prospectively contemplated. After a 
blinded review of the first 203 subjects’ CPS score, an even lower than expected prevalence was reported 
(i.e. 27%) that lead to an increase in sample size by addition of 356 subjects (revised Protocol 08). In

March 2019, PD-L1 CPS results from one pathologist at one of the two central laboratories undergoing 
the  scoring  were  identified  by  the  MAH  as  having  a  lower  proportion  of  CPS  positive  cases  at  the  ≥1 
threshold compared with other pathologists. The pathologist incorrectly interpreted/implemented one of 
the steps within the predefined CPS scoring algorithm/methodology and as a result, 914 of the 1,399 
accessions were disqualified and re-scored. During the rescoring the pathologists were blinded to the 
previous CPS score and treatment information and no issues have been identified that can be considered 
to have an impact on the integrity/reliability of the (submitted) revised data.  
Following resolution of the scoring issue of the samples detailed above the prevalence was reported as 
of 60%, almost double of the initially expected value. To justify that this discrepancy did not impact the 
reported  results  the  MAH  provided  the  results  of  pre-planned  sensitivity  analyses  of  OS  and  PFS  for 
subjects with CPS ≥ 5 conducted to reflect the design per Revised Protocol 07 (based on sample size 
and  events  per  the  assumed  35%  prevalence).  The  results  were  consistent  to  those  of  the  primary 
analyses of both OS and PFS. 
Indeed,  the  primary  endpoints  and/or  sample  size and/or the multiple testing  strategy  were  changed 
multiple times. In all protocols OS in all comers was part of the multiple testing strategy. However, this 
strategy was changed between each of the following protocols: 02, 03, 04, 05, 07, 08 (SAP v1), and 09 
(final protocol, SAP  v2 and v3).  Changes entailed: timing of analysis (event or time driven), order of 
testing of the endpoints before OS in all comers would be tested, statistical significance levels, presence 
of  interim  analyses  and  sample  size  (number  of  events/total  number  of  patients).  In  this  context  a 
detailed  justification/explanation  of  all  the  amendments  performed  in  the  protocol  to  further  justify 
whether these changes were driven by external or internal data was submitted even if no new information 
was provided. A description of how access to data was controlled during the study was also provided and 
no major issues were identified that would have had an impact on the results and B/R assessment for 
the applied indication.  
The original definition of PFS censored for subsequent therapy, thus aimed at estimating the effect as if 
no  subsequent  therapy  would  have  been  used  (hypothetical  strategy).  However,  censoring  may  be 
informative and thus the estimate could be biased. In the last protocol, a secondary definition of PFS 
included the first PFS event regardless including when it occurred after start of new therapy (treatment 
policy  strategy).  This  is  the  analysis  recommended  in  appendix  1  of  the  EMA  anticancer  guideline 
(CHMP/27994/2008 Rev. 1). BICR assessments were requested if investigator PD was determined and 
in case subsequent or local palliative therapy was started, if was requested to continue BIRC scans if 
clinically feasible. This limits informative censoring in the BICR assessment. 
In  addition  to  the  above,  previous  EMA  inspections  revealed  that  BioClinica  procedures  allowed 
investigator sites to send and store images without proper de-identification. The process of transfer and 
storage of images used in study CA209649 has the potential to comply with the General Data Protection 
Regulation (GDPR) and ICH-GCP Guideline (E6(R2) and there are no indications that the privacy of trial 
participants  in  study  CA209649  was  violated.  The  fact  that  BioClinica  allows  submitting  images  with 
personal identifiers and investigators does not represent a robust process that ensures rights of the trial 
participants and this is still considered a weakness in the overall process and has the potential to violate 
the privacy of trial participants. The issue will not be further pursued within this type II variation, as it 
does  not  have  a  negative  impact  on  the  B/R.  However,  it  remains  the  responsibility  of  the  MAH  that 
CROs involved in the clinical trials running within the EU will adhere to the GDPRand ICH-GCP Guideline. 
With regards to protocol deviations, relevant protocol deviations were reported in 21 (1.3%) patients 
and it was comparable between treatment arms. In the nivo+chemo arm, use of prohibited anti-cancer 
therapy was the main reason (8 [1.0%] nivo+chemo vs. 4 [0.5%] chemo). Overall, no concern is raised 
over possible impact of protocol deviations on efficacy results.

Overall, baseline characteristics of patients included in the study were balanced between treatment arms 
and the patient population appears representative of the intended target population. Patients included 
in  the  study  had  a  median  age  of  61  years  (range:  18,  90),  with  9.7%  being  75  years  or  older.  The 
majority of patients were male (70%), White (69%) and had an ECOG performance status of 0 (44%) 
or 1 (56%). Patients with ECOG ≥2 were not allowed to enter the study. Nearly half of patients (48%) 
were  current/former  smokers.  In  the  majority  of  patients,  the  initial  diagnosis  was  gastric  cancer 
(70.2%), followed by GEJ cancer (16.4%) and EA (13.3%). The vast majority of patients had a metastatic 
disease. Liver and peritoneal metastases were present in 39% and 24%, respectively. It is important to 
note that per inclusion/exclusion criteria, patients with known HER2 positive status were not allowed to 
enter the study. However, there were 7 (0.4%) patients whose tumour was HER2 positive and in addition 
there were 643 (40.7 %) patients for whom HER2 status was undetermined, i.e. not reported (test was 
not  performed;  634  patients)  or  unknown  (test  was  performed  but  the  result  was  unavailable;  9 
patients). With regards to prior treatment, 13.7% of patients had received prior adjuvant (7.5%) or neo-
adjuvant (6.9%) treatment. There was one patient in the nivo+chemo arm who received prior treatment 
in the metastatic setting, however this issue is not considered of clinical relevance.   
Efficacy outcomes 
All analyses were on patients concurrently randomized to the nivo+chemo or chemo arm (i.e. since start 
of 1:1:1 randomisation to nivo+ipi, nivo+chemo, chemo arms). Since Protocol 02, the OS analysis in all 
comers was stratified according to region, ECOG, type of chemotherapy and PD-L1 status.  
The study met its primary endpoints. Nivo+chemo demonstrated a statistically significant and clinically 
meaningful improvement in OS (HR 0.71; 98.4% CI: 0.59, 0.86) and PFS (HR 0.68; 98% CI: 0.56, 0.81) 
over  chemotherapy  alone  in  patients  with  CPS≥5.  Median  OS  was  of  14.39  (95%  CI:  13.11,  16.23) 
months in the nivo+chemo group and 11.10 (95% CI: 10.02, 12.09) months in the chemo group. Median 
PFS was of 7.69 (95% CI: 7.03, 9.17) and 6.05 (95% CI: 5.55, 6.90) months, in the nivo+chemo and 
chemo groups, respectively. At the time of the data cut-off the median follow-up in patients with PD-L1 
CPS≥5 was 13.57 months in the nivo+chemo arm and 10.66 months in the chemo arm. 
While  patients  with  PD-L1  CPS≥5  represent  the  primary  efficacy  population,  a  broad  indication  was 
initially requested for nivo+chemo (i.e. regardless of PD-L1 CPS expression). OS in the all randomised 
patients (n=1581) was assessed as a secondary endpoint. However, since a hierarchical testing strategy 
was used, type I error control is warranted and therefore these results can be considered interpretable. 
OS in the overall population, with an event rate of 65% in the nivo+chemo arm and 75% in the chemo 
arm,  showed  a  statistically  significant  benefit  of  nivo+chemo over  chemo  (HR  0.80;  99.3%  CI:  0.68, 
0.94).  Median  OS  was  of  13.83  (95%  CI:  12.55,  14.55)  months  and  11.56  (95%  CI:  10.87,  12.48) 
months in the experimental and control arm, respectively.  
Results in terms of PFS in the overall population were consistent with the OS analysis and favoured also 
the nivo+chemo arm, although the benefit appears lower than in the PD-L1 CPS≥5 population (HR 0.77; 
95% CI: 0.68, 0.87). Median PFS was 7.66 (95%CI: 7.10, 8.54) months in the nivo+chemo arm versus 
6.93  (95%  CI:  6.60,  7.13)  months  in  the  chemo  arm.  The  ORR  was  higher  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm 
compared with the chemo arm (58% vs. 46.1%, respectively), in patients with measurable disease at 
baseline. Median duration of response was also higher in the nivo+chemo arm (8.51 months vs. 6.93 
months). The median follow-up in the all-randomised patients was 13.1 months in the nivo+chemo arm 
and 11.1 months in the chemo arm. 
Even though statistical significance was reached with nivo+chemo over chemo in terms of OS (and also 
PFS) in the all-randomised patient population, the effect appears to be driven by patients with PD-L1 
CPS≥5. In patients with PD-L1 CPS <5 no clear benefit was observed with nivo+chemo over chemo (HR 
0.94; 95% CI: 0.78, 1.13), with a median OS of 12.42 and 12.25 in the nivo+chemo and control arm, 
respectively.  Although  K-M  curves  tended  to  separate  after  12  months,  interpretation  of  the  curve  at 
Assessment report

that timepoint was difficult due to high numbers of censoring. Also, a similar pattern was observed in 
patients with PD-L1 CPS <10 (HR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.80, 1.10]) and in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥5 and 
<10 (HR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.66, 1.28). Of note, PFS results were consistent with OS data in these subgroups 
of patients. While it was acknowledged that these results come from an exploratory analysis, considering 
that  a  broad  indication  was  applied  (i.e.  regardless  of  PD-L1  CPS  status),  the  MAH  was  requested  to 
further justify the benefit of nivo+chemo in the intended target population. Updated efficacy data with 
a DBL of 16 Feb 2021, providing 7.3 months of additional follow-up (minimum follow-up 19.4 months) 
were submitted including updated efficacy data by PD-L1 CPS status using different cut-offs (i.e. 1, 5 
and 10). Taking into account the new submitted data still no apparent benefit is observed in patients 
with PD-L1 CPS<5 in terms of OS (HR 0.94; 95% CI: 0.79, 1.13), with a median of 12.42 and 12.09 
months, respectively, the same percentage of OS events, and KM curves overlapping. Bearing in mind 
the  increased  toxicity  of  the  combination  compared  with  chemo  alone,  a  positive  benefit-risk  balance 
cannot be concluded for patients with PD-L1 CPS<5. Therefore, the indication was restricted to patients 
with PD-L1 CPS≥5, which in fact was the primary efficacy population in the study. 
The  results  observed  for  OS  in  the  all-randomised patient  population  were  consistent  for  most of  the 
subgroups analysed. However, the benefit of nivo+chemo over chemo appears less clear in patients with 
GEJ cancer (HR 0.9; 95% CI: 0.67, 1.21), OAC (HR 0.82; 95% CI: 0.60, 1.13), patients who had received 
prior radiotherapy (HR 0.92; 95% CI: 0.64, 1.33), patients with a diffuse type (HR 0.91; 95% CI: 0.74, 
1.10),  presence  of  Signet  Ring  Cell  (HR  0.96;  95%  CI:  0.73,  1.25)  and  in  patients  with  peritoneal 
metastases (HR 1.03; 95% CI: 0.82, 1.29). GC/GEJC/OAC is known to be a heterogeneous disease and 
the  details  and  discussion  provided  by  the  MAH  allow  to  conclude  that  there  is  no  well-established 
biological rationale / reason why the results in any of the above subgroups should be challenged, also 
considering that the trial was not powered to determine the effect in those subgroups. As discussed by 
the MAH the small(er) sample sizes and imbalances in various baseline disease characteristics and other 
factors, not a single one, are likely to have contributed to the lower treatment effect observed in those 
particular subgroups.  
In contrast, the benefit of nivo+chemo seems higher in patients with microsatellite instability (MSI) high 
(HR 0.37; 95% CI: 0.16, 0.87) although data are limited due to the small number of patients (n=44). 
Determination of MSI status was performed retrospectively by central laboratories. Of the 1581 patients 
randomised, 44 (2.8%) were MSI-H while 1377 (87.1%) were microsatellite stable (MSS).  
Finally, the MAH was requested to restrict the indication to HER2-negative patients given the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria and differences in prognosis and treatment of this patient population, unless 
a broad indication (i.e. HER2 agnostic) could be sufficiently justified. In this context the Applicant 
provided a discussion of the results from the subgroup analysis in patients with negative vs.  
undetermined HER2 status, with an observed HR for OS of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.99) and 0.71 (95% 
CI: 0.59, 0.85), respectively. Since the actual rate of HER2 negative subjects among the HER2 not 
reported/unknown subjects in the study is not known, the MAH conducted some simulations aimed at 
demonstrating that the reported treatment benefit with nivo+chemo vs. chemo alone in the HER2 
negative subgroup could in fact be an underestimation. Results from that analysis appear to support 
that as an increasing proportion of subjects who are not reported/unknown are included as HER2-
negative, the HR decreases, indicating greater treatment effect from nivo+chemo vs. chemo, but 
caution is needed when interpreting these data. Further, the MAH discussed other factors that may 
have played a role in the reported efficacy differences between the two subgroups i.e. regional 
differences, status of the disease at baseline and subsequent therapy received. Based on those 
results/discussion the MAH proposed to revise the indication as follows (revisions underlined): 
“OPDIVO in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based combination chemotherapy is 
indicated for the first-line treatment of adult patients with HER2 negative (or undetermined) advanced 
or metastatic gastric, gastro oesophageal junction or oesophageal adenocarcinoma (see sections 4.4 
Assessment report  
EMA/556100/2021  
Page 95/158 
 
 
 
 
and 5.1).”. The revised proposal was not considered acceptable. The MAH argues that (descriptive) 
data showed clinical benefit in nivo+chemo over chemo in HER2 undetermined patients (40.3% of the 
study population), and that the safety profile was manageable and acceptable in these patients. While 
it can be acknowledged that patients with undetermined status appear to benefit from treatment (see 
above), the need to specify them in the indication is not considered appropriate. ‘Undetermined’ HER2 
status does not constitute a recognized subgroup of patients within the target population and therefore 
the indication was amended to include treatment of HER2-negative patients only.

2.4.1.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In study CA209649 treatment with nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy (XELOX or FOLFOX) 
showed a statistically significant OS and PFS benefit compared with chemotherapy (XELOX or FOLFOX) 
alone in patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic GC, GEJ or OAC whose tumours express 
PD-L1 with a CPS≥5.  
2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
Safety data from 782 subjects treated with first-line nivo+chemo (nivolumab 240 mg + FOLFOX Q2W or 
nivolumab 360 mg + XELOX Q3W) and from 767 control subjects (treated with FOLFOX or XELOX) from 
study  CA209649  were  used  to  characterize  the  safety  profile  of  this  combination  regimen in  subjects 
with advanced or metastatic gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction or oesophageal adenocarcinoma. 
Patient exposure 
The  last  subject  randomization  occurred  on  27-May-2019  and  the  clinical  cutoff  occurred  on 
27-May-2020. The DBL occurred on 10-Jul-2020. Minimum follow-up (date of the last subject randomized 
to LPLV) was 12.1 months. A total of 1581 subjects were concurrently randomized in the nivo+chemo 
and chemo arms: 789 to the nivo+chemo arm and 792 to the chemo arm. 1549 subjects were treated: 
782  with  nivo+chemo  and  767  with  chemo.  Of  the 1549  treated  subjects,  123  (7.9%)  subjects  were 
continuing in the treatment at the time of database lock: 84 (10.7%) nivo+chemo-treated subjects and 
39 (5.1%) chemo-treated subjects. The overall rates of discontinuation were 89.3% and 94.9% in the 
nivo+chemo  and  chemo  arms,  respectively.  The  primary  reason  for  not  continuing  in  the  treatment 
period  was  disease  progression  in  both  treatment  arms  (1043  subjects,  67.3%):  515  (65.9%) 
nivo+chemo-treated  subjects  and  528  (68.8%)  chemo-treated  subjects.  Overall,  61  (3.9%)  subjects 
withdrew consent and did not complete the treatment period: 20 (2.6%) in the nivo+chemo arm and 41 
(5.3%) in the chemo. 
Overall, the median (min - max) duration of therapy was 6.75 (0.0 - 33.5) months in the nivo+chemo 
arm and 4.86 (0.0 - 34.9) months in the chemo arm (Figure 20). Among all treated subjects, 54.3% and 
38.7% had a duration of therapy > 6 months in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively. 
Assessment report

In the nivo+chemo arm, the median (min - max) duration of therapy was 6.49 (0.1 - 33.5) months with 
nivo+XELOX and 7.01 (0.0 - 30.0) months with nivo+FOLFOX.  
In the chemo arm, the median (min - max) duration of therapy was 4.86 (0.0 - 34.9) months with XELOX 
and 4.80 (0.1 - 33.2) months with FOLFOX. 
The median (min - max) number of doses received by all treated subjects and the proportion of subjects 
who  received  ≥ 90%  of  the  planned  dose  intensity  are  shown  in  Table  29.  Of  note,  prior  to  revised 
Protocol 07 (Amendment 23), all components were delayed together if a dose delay was required.

Chemotherapy dose modifications were permitted per local standard starting with cycle 2. Dose reduction 
was  not  allowed  for  nivolumab.  In  all  treated  subjects,  dose  delays  were  the  most  common  dose 
modification in both the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, while dose interruption and dose reductions were 
less common. 
Dose delays of study drug (proportion of subjects with at least 1 dose delay) were reported as follows: 
•  Nivo+chemo arm: 
−  Nivo+XELOX: 66.7% for nivolumab, 59.4% for oxaliplatin, and 66.4% for capecitabine. 
−  Nivo+FOLFOX: 78.2% for nivolumab, 74.6% for oxaliplatin, 77.0% for leucovorin, 75.8% for 5-
FU bolus, and 78.9% for 5-FU continuous.  
•  Chemo arm: 
−  XELOX: 48.2% for oxaliplatin and 54.8% for capecitabine.  
− 
FOLFOX: 70.2% for oxaliplatin, 71.4% for leucovorin, 70.6% for 5-FU bolus, and 73.4% for 5-
FU continuous. 
Dose reductions of chemotherapy (proportion of subjects with at least 1 dose reduction) were reported 
as follows: 
•  Nivo+chemo arm: 
−  Nivo+XELOX: 46.4% for oxaliplatin 
−  Nivo+FOLFOX: 41.0% for oxaliplatin, 26.8% for leucovorin, 30.9% for 5-FU bolus, and 42.9% 
for 5-FU continuous.  
•  Chemo arm: 
−  XELOX: 40.2% for oxaliplatin 
− 
FOLFOX: 44.6% for oxaliplatin, 34.5% for leucovorin, 36.3% for 5-FU bolus, and 37.2% for 5-
FU continuous. 
Infusion  interruptions  in  all  treated  subjects  occurred  most  frequently  during  oxaliplatin 
administration  in  both  the  nivo+chemo  and  chemo  arms.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  at  least  1 
infusion interrupted were reported as follows in all treated subjects: 
•  Nivo+chemo arm: 
−  Nivo+XELOX: 3.1% for nivolumab, 6.7% for oxaliplatin 
−  Nivo+FOLFOX: 4.0% for nivolumab, 15.6% for oxaliplatin, 8.8% for leucovorin, 1.0% for 5-FU, 
and 9.5% for 5-FU continuous.  
•  Chemo arm: 
−  XELOX: 5.8% for oxaliplatin 
− 
FOLFOX:  7.6%  for  oxaliplatin,  4.2%  for  leucovorin,  2.0%  for  5-FU  bolus,  and  5.9%  for  5-FU 
continuous. 
Infusion  rate  reductions  in  all  treated  subjects  occurred  most  frequently  during  oxaliplatin 
administration  in  both  the  nivo+chemo  and  chemo  arms.  The  proportion  of  subjects  with  at  least  1 
infusion rate reduction were reported as follows in all treated subjects: 
•  Nivo+chemo arm: 
Assessment report

−  Nivo+XELOX: 2.2% for nivolumab, 6.9% for oxaliplatin 
−  Nivo+FOLFOX: 3.6% for nivolumab, 16.6% for oxaliplatin, 10.0% for leucovorin, 10.9% for 5-
FU bolus, and 10.2% for 5-FU continuous.  
•  Chemo arm: 
−  XELOX: 5.3% for oxaliplatin 
− 
FOLFOX:  7.6%  for  oxaliplatin,  4.9%  for  leucovorin,  3.7%  for  5-FU  bolus,  and  4.7%  for  5-FU 
continuous. 
The most commonly reported cause of dose delay for nivolumab and chemotherapy was AE. Please refer 
to  the  section  discontinuations  for  a  more  detailed  discussion  of  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation,  dose 
reductions, and dose delays.

Potential overlapping AEs 
The  potential  overlapping  AEs  of  nivolumab  and  chemotherapy,  such  as  gastrointestinal,  respiratory, 
skin and liver toxicities, that were numerically higher in the nivo+chemo arm compared with the chemo 
arm, as well as nivolumab monotherapy, suggest potentially additive toxicity of the two drugs when used 
in combination. The most frequently reported potential overlapping AEs (regardless of causality) were 
the following: 
•  Nivo+chemo: nausea (47.6%), diarrhoea (39.4%), fatigue (32.9%), vomiting (31.3%), increased 
aspartate aminotransferase (20.1%), increased alanine aminotransferase (14.3%), palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (13.2%),  increased  blood  alkaline  phosphatase  (12.9%),  rash 
(11.0%),  increased  blood  bilirubin  (9.7%),  pruritis  (9.3%),  stomatitis  (8.2%),  and  pneumonia 
(5.8%). 
•  Chemo:  nausea  (43.5%),  diarrhoea  (33.6%),  vomiting  (28.8%),  fatigue  (28.6%),  increased 
aspartate  aminotransferase  (12.5%),  palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (11.7%), 
increased alanine aminotransferase (9.4%), blood alkaline phosphatase (7.6%), stomatitis (6.6%), 
increased blood bilirubin (6.4%), pneumonia (4.2%), rash (2.6%), and pruritis (2.0%). 
The most frequently reported potential overlapping drug-related AEs were the following: 
•  Nivo+chemo: nausea (41.3%), diarrhoea (32.4%), fatigue (25.8%), vomiting (24.9%), increased 
aspartate  aminotransferase  (15.6%),  palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (12.0%), 
increased alanine aminotransferase (11.4%), rash (9.5%), stomatitis (7.3%), pruritis (6.9%), blood 
alkaline phosphatase (6.6%), increased blood bilirubin (6.1%), and pneumonitis (4.5%).  
•  Chemo:  nausea  (38.1%),  diarrhoea  (26.9%),  fatigue  (22.6%),  vomiting  (21.6%),  palmar-plantar 
erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (10.6%),  increased  aspartate  aminotransferase  (9.0%),  increased 
alanine aminotransferase (6.5%), stomatitis (6.1%), blood alkaline phosphatase (4.4%), increased 
blood bilirubin (4.2%), rash (1.6%), pruritis (1.0%), and pneumonitis (0.3%). 
Exposure-adjusted adverse events rates 
When the AE occurrences were exposure-adjusted, AE incidence rates (per 100 person-year [P-Y]) were 
2273.3 with nivo+chemo treatment and 2139.1 with chemo treatment. The most frequently reported 
exposure adjusted AEs (all causality) for both the nivo+chemo and chemo arms were within the SOC of 
gastrointestinal disorders (475.5/100 P-Y for nivo+chemo vs. 533.3/100 P-Y for chemo). Nausea was 
the most frequently reported PT (116.0/100 P-Y for nivo+chemo vs. 128.4/100 P-Y for chemo). 
When  the  drug-related  AE  occurrences  were  exposure-adjusted,  drug-related  AE  incidence  rates  (per 
100 P-Y) were 1368.0 with nivo+chemo treatment and 1305.2 for chemo treatment. In the nivo+chemo 
arm,  the  most  frequently  reported  exposure  adjusted  drug-related  AEs  were  within  the  SOC  of 
investigations with decreased neutrophil count as the most frequently reported PT (64.5/100 P-Y). In 
the chemotherapy arm, the most frequently reported exposure adjusted drug-related AEs were within 
the SOC of gastrointestinal disorders with nausea as the most frequently reported PT (110.6/100 P-Y). 
Select adverse events 
In  order  to  characterize  AEs  of  special  clinical  interest  that  are  potentially  associated  with  the  use  of 
nivolumab, the MAH identified select AEs based on the following 4 guiding principles: 
•  AEs that may differ in type, frequency, or severity from AEs caused by non-immunotherapies 
•  AEs that may require immunosuppression (e.g., corticosteroids) as part of their management 
•  AEs whose early recognition and management may mitigate severe toxicity 
Assessment report  
EMA/556100/2021  
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  AEs for which multiple event terms may be used to describe a single type of AE, thereby necessitating 
the pooling of terms for full characterization 
Based  on  these  guiding  principles  and  taking  into  account  the  types  of  AEs  already  observed  across 
studies  of  nivolumab  monotherapy,  endocrinopathies,  diarrhoea/colitis,  hepatitis,  pneumonitis, 
interstitial nephritis, and rash are currently considered to be select AEs. Multiple event terms that may 
describe each  of  these  were  grouped into  endocrine,  gastrointestinal  (GI),  hepatic,  pulmonary,  renal, 
and skin select AE categories, respectively. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions were analysed along with 
the select AE categories, because multiple event terms may be used to describe such events and pooling 
of terms was, therefore, necessary for  full characterisation. Hypersensitivity/infusion reactions do not 
otherwise meet criteria to be considered select AEs. 
The  majority  of  select  AEs  were  Grade  1-2  and  most  select  AEs  were  considered  drug-related  by  the 
investigator. The most frequently reported drug-related select AE categories (any grade) were as follows 
in each treatment arm (Table 30): 
•  Nivo+chemo: gastrointestinal (33.5%), skin (27.4%) and hepatic (26.0%). 
•  Chemo: gastrointestinal (27.0%), hepatic (17.5%), and skin (13.7%). 
The most frequently reported drug-related select AEs by preferred term (any grade) were as follows in 
each treatment arm: 
•  Nivo+chemo: diarrhoea (32.4%), increased AST (15.6%), and palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome (12.0%). 
•  Chemo: diarrhoea (26.9%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome (10.6%), and increased 
AST (9.0%). 
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  serious  select  AEs  by  preferred  term  (any  grade)  were  as 
follows in each treatment arm: 
•  Nivo+chemo: diarrhoea (2.2%), pneumonitis (2.2%), and infusion related reaction (0.8%). 
•  Chemo: diarrhoea (1.3%). 
Across the select AE categories, the majority of events in the nivo+chemo arm were manageable using 
the  established  algorithms,  with  resolution  occurring  when  immune-modulating  medications  (mainly 
systemic corticosteroids) were administered (Table 33). Most drug-related select AEs with nivo+chemo 
had resolved (ranging from 43.0% to 98.2% across categories) at the time of database lock. The median 
time to resolution ranged from 0.14 to 23.43 weeks for select AEs. Some endocrine select AEs were not 
considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy.

Immune-mediated adverse events 
IMAE analyses included events, regardless of causality, occurring within 100 days of the last dose (i.e., 
with  extended  follow-up).  These  analyses  included  IMAE  categories  (diarrhoea/colitis,  hepatitis, 
pneumonitis, nephritis and renal dysfunction, rash, hypersensitivity/infusion reactions, and endocrine) 
with PTs describing specific events regardless of causality. These analyses were limited to subjects who 
received  immune-modulating  medication  for  treatment  of  the  event,  with  the  exception  of  endocrine 
events,  which  were  included  in  the  analysis  regardless  of  treatment  since  these  events  are  often 
managed without immunosuppression. In addition, these events were identified by the investigator as 
IMAEs with no clear alternate etiology and an immune mediated component.  
Overall,  the  majority  of  IMAEs  were  Grade  1-2.  The  most  frequently  reported  IMAEs  (any  grade)  by 
category were as follows in each treatment arm (Table 30): 
•  Nivo+chemo: hypothyroidism/thyroiditis (9.5%), rash (6.5%), and pneumonitis (4.2%). 
−  Of the treated subjects who experienced non-endocrine IMAEs, a higher frequency of Grade 3-4 
IMAEs  was  observed  in  the  following  categories:  hepatitis  (13/19  subjects),  diarrhoea/colitis 
(17/26  subjects),  nephritis  and  renal  dysfunction  (2/4  subjects)  and  pneumonitis  (15/33 
subjects). 
−  Of  the  treated  subjects  who  experienced  endocrine  IMAEs;  a  higher  frequency  of  Grade  3-4 
IMAEs was observed in hypophysitis (3/6 subjects) and diabetes mellitus (1/2 subjects). 
•  Chemo: hypothyroidism/thyroiditis (0.8%) and rash (0.5%). 
Across  IMAE  categories,  the  majority  of  events  were  manageable  using  the  established  management 
algorithms,  with  resolution  occurring  when  immune-modulating  medications  (mostly  systemic 
corticosteroids)  were  administered  (Table  34).  Except  for  some  endocrine  events,  most  IMAEs  with 
nivo+chemo  treatment  had  resolved  at the  time of  DBL.  Some  endocrine  IMAEs  were  not  considered 
resolved due to the continuing need for hormone replacement therapy (Table 34).  
Re-challenge  information  was  also  summarized  for  subjects  who  continued  to  receive  nivolumab 
treatment after the onset of an IMAE (Table 34). A re-challenge was considered as an unsuccessful or 
positive  re-challenge  if,  after  resolution  of  the  IMAE,  a  new  IMAE  of  the  same  type  occurred  with 
re-treatment of study drug. A re-challenge was considered as a successful or negative re-challenge if, 
after resolution of the IMAE, no new IMAEs of the same type occurred with re-treatment.

Other events of special interest (OESIs) 
OESIs are events that do not fulfill all criteria to qualify as IMAEs. These events may differ from those 
caused  by  non-immunotherapies  and  may  require  immunosuppression  as  part  of  their  management. 
Analyses  of  OESIs  had  extended  follow-up  (100-day  window);  and  OESIs  included  the  following 
categories:  demyelination,  Guillain-Barré  syndrome,  myasthenic  syndrome,  pancreatitis,  uveitis, 
encephalitis, myocarditis, graft versus host disease, and myositis/rhabdomyolysis. OESIs (regardless of 
causality or IMM treatment) with extended follow-up are summarized by category in Table 30 . 
OESIs  (regardless  of  causality  or  IMM  treatment,  with  extended  follow-up)  were  infrequent  in  both 
treatment arms (Table 30 and Table 35). Overall, OESIs were reported in 8/782 (1.0%) subjects (10 
events) in the nivo+chemo arm and 4/767 (0.5%) subjects (5 events) in the chemo arm. 9/10 OESIs in 
the nivo+chemo arm and 4/5 OESIs in the chemo arm were resolved at the time of database lock (Table 
35).  7/10  and  1/5  OESIs  were  resolved  with  IMM  treatment  in  the  nivo+chemo  and  chemo  arms, 
respectively.

Serious adverse event and deaths 
Serious adverse events 
The  overall  frequencies  of  SAEs  (all-causality  and  drug-related)  were  numerically  higher  with 
nivo+chemo than with chemo (Table 30, Table 36, Table 37). 
Any Grade SAEs (regardless of causality) were reported in 423 (54.1%) subjects in the nivo+chemo 
arm vs. 335 (43.7%) subjects in the chemo arm. Grade 3-4 SAEs were reported in 281 (35.9%) subjects 
in the nivo+chemo arm and 229 (29.9%) subjects in the chemo arm. 
The most frequently reported SAEs (regardless of causality) were: 
•  Nivo+chemo: malignant neoplasm progression (13.9%), vomiting (3.2%), and anaemia (3.1%). 
•  Chemo: malignant neoplasm progression (11.7%), vomiting (3.1%), and dysphagia (2.1%).  
Any-grade drug-related SAEs were reported in 172 (22.0%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm, and 93 
(12.1%) subjects in the chemo arm. Grade 3-4 drug-related SAEs were reported in 131 (16.8%) subjects 
in the nivo+chemo arm, and 77 (10.0%) subjects in the chemo arm. 
The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs were: 
•  Nivo+chemo: diarrhoea (2.2%), pneumonitis (2.2%), and febrile neutropaenia (2.0%). 
•  Chemo: vomiting (2.3%), diarrhoea (1.3%), and decreased appetite (1.0%).

Deaths 
As of the 10-Jul-2020 database lock, the number of treated subjects who died in the nivo+chemo arm 
was numerically lower vs. the chemo arm (Table 38). Disease progression was the most common cause 
of death in both arms. 
Note that only events that led to death within 24 hours were documented as Grade 5. Events leading to 
death > 24 hours after onset are reported with the grade at presentation.

Deaths attributed to other reasons 
Deaths attributed to other reasons were reported in 49 (6.3%) and 44 (5.7%) of treated subjects in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively (Table 
38). There were 4 events reported as “related” per investigator: thrombosis mesenteric vessel, disseminated intravascular coagulation, cerebral infarction and 
pneumonitis. All 4 subjects were in the nivo+chemo arm. Per investigator, the pneumonitis was reported as related to nivolumab and the other 3 events were 
reported as related to both nivolumab and chemotherapy (Table 40 below)

Laboratory findings 
A summary of clinical laboratory parameters that worsened relative to baseline is presented in Table 41. 
Haematology 
Abnormalities in haematology tests performed during treatment or within 30 days of last dose of study 
drug were primarily Grade 1-2. Grade 3 or 4 haematologic abnormalities reported in ≥ 5% of subjects 
were as follows (Table 41): 
•  Nivo+chemo:  decreased  absolute  neutrophil  count  (29.3%),  decreased  haemoglobin  (13.9%), 
decreased  absolute  lymphocytes  (12.2%),  decreased  leukocytes  (11.8%),  and  decreased  platelet 
count (6.8%) 
•  Chemo: decreased absolute neutrophil count (22.8%), decreased haemoglobin (9.5%), decreased 
absolute lymphocytes (9.2%), and decreased leukocytes (9.0%) 
Serum chemistry 
Liver tests 
During the treatment period, abnormalities in hepatic parameters (all increases) were primarily Grade 1-
2. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) increases were reported more 
frequently with nivo+chemo (37.0% and 51.7%, respectively) compared with chemo (29.5% and 47.5%, 
respectively) (Table 41). 
Based on laboratory results reported after the first dose and within 30 days of last dose of study therapy, 
13/764 (1.7%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm had concurrent ALT or AST > 3 ×  upper limit of normal 
(ULN) with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN within 1 or 30 days, while 6/737 (0.8%) and 7/737 (0.9%) subjects 
in the chemo arm had concurrent ALT or AST > 3 ×  ULN with total bilirubin > 2 × ULN within 1 day and 
within 30 days, respectively (Table 42). 
There were 13 subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 7 subjects in the chemo arm with concurrent ALT or 
AST >3×ULN with total bilirubin >2×ULN). 
In the nivo+chemo arm:  
• 
In 3 subjects, the abnormal hepatic laboratory findings were reported as related to nivolumab alone 
or to both nivolumab and chemotherapy.  
−  All 3 subjects were treated with high dose immune-modulating medication (IMM) and improved 
after treatment. This improvement supported the etiology as immune-mediated. 
− 
In  1  of  the  3  subjects,  the  abnormal  hepatic  laboratory  findings  led  to  study  treatment 
discontinuation.  
• 
In  10  subjects,  the  abnormal  hepatic  laboratory  findings  were  reported  as  not-related  to  study 
treatment, and other etiologies were implicated. 
− 
− 
In 6 subjects, abnormal hepatic laboratory findings were due to disease progression with liver 
or pancreatic metastasis (new lesions or increased existing lesions). 
In 4 subjects, abnormal hepatic laboratory findings were due to biliary duct stone or biliary duct 
infections.  
In the chemo arm: 
• 
In 2 subjects, abnormal hepatic laboratory findings were reported as related to chemotherapy.

− 
In  both  subjects,  the  abnormal  hepatic  laboratory  findings  led  to  study  treatment 
discontinuation.  
• 
In  5  subjects,  abnormal  hepatic  laboratory  findings  were  due  to  disease  progression  with  liver 
metastasis (new lesions or existing lesion increased). 
Kidney function tests 
Most  subjects  with  at  least  1 on-treatment  measurement  had  normal  creatinine  values  during  the 
treatment reporting period. The abnormalities in creatinine (increased) were primarily reported as Grade 
1 or 2. Grade 3-4 increased creatinine level was reported in 8 (1.0%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm 
and 4 (0.5%) subjects in the chemo arm (Table 41). 
Thyroid function tests 
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) increases (> ULN) from baseline (≤ ULN) were reported in 158/709 
(22.3%)  subjects  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm,  and  8/146  (5.5%)  subjects  in  the  chemo  arm.  Decreases 
(< lower limit of normal [LLN]) from baseline (>= LLN) were reported in 104/709 (14.7%) subjects in 
the nivo+chemo arm, and 2/146 (1.4%) subjects in the chemo arm (Table 43). 
Electrolytes 
Most  subjects  had  normal  electrolyte  levels  during  the  treatment  reporting  period.  Abnormalities  in 
electrolytes  during  treatment  were  primarily  Grade  1  to  2  in  severity.  The  following  Grade  3  or  4 
abnormalities  in  electrolytes  were  observed  in  ≥ 5%  of  treated  subjects  with  on-treatment  laboratory 
results (Table 41): 
•  Nivo+chemo: hypokalaemia (6.5%), hyponatraemia (6.3%) 
•  Chemo: hyponatraemia (5.5%)

Pregnancy tests 
All pregnancy tests were negative during the study. 
Vital signs and physical findings 
Vital  signs  and  oxygen  saturation  by  pulse  oximetry  were  monitored  and  recorded  at  the  site  per 
institutional standard of care during screening and treatment visits. These assessments were intended 
to  be  used  as  safety  monitoring  by  the  treating  physician.     Any  clinically  meaningful  safety  events 
related  to  these  vital  signs  were  captured  and  reported  as  adverse  events  (AEs)  or  serious  adverse 
events (SAEs) (Table 30). There was a higher frequency of vital sign related AEs and SAEs in nivo+chemo 
vs. chemo treated subjects, consistent with the entire safety profile; however, overall these events were 
infrequent. The majority of events in both treatment arms were Grade 1-2, and Grade 3-4 events were 
rare. There was 1 drug-related Grade 5 febrile neutropenia event reported in the nivo+chemo arm, as 
well as 2 Grade 5 arrhythmia events (1 in each treatment arm) that were unrelated to study treatment.

•  Among all nivo+chemo treated subjects, the frequencies of drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs in the US 
(includes US and Canada) (72.1%) appeared to be higher than those in other regions (Asia [54.2%] 
and ROW [57.4%) and also higher compared with the all-treated population (59.1%).  
−  Of  note,  drug-related  Grade  3-4  AEs  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm  were  higher  with  nivo+FOLFOX 
(67.8%) compared with nivo+XELOX (48.9%) and drug-related Grade 3-4 AEs in the chemo arm 
were higher with FOLFOX (49.5%) compared with XELOX (38.8%). Most treated subjects from 
the US and Canada received FOLFOX: 92.2% (119/129) of subjects in the nivo+chemo arm and 
91.1% (113/124) of subjects in the chemo arm. 
In  both  treatment  arms,  the  frequencies  of  Grade  3-4  drug-related  AEs  appeared  to  be  higher  in 
female subjects compared with male subjects (67.5% vs. 55.2% in the nivo+chemo arm, 54.9% vs. 
40.1% in the chemo arm).  
The frequencies of Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs in the nivo+chemo arm were numerically higher (with 
at  least  a  10%  difference)  compared  with  the  chemo  arm  for  the  most  of  the  subgroups  of  age, 
gender, race and geographic region; this is consistent with all treated subjects, where drug-related 
Grade 3-4 AEs were 14.6% higher with nivo+chemo vs. chemo.

The  special  population  “age  groups”  is  discussed  in more  detail. The  frequencies  of  all  causality  total 
AEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and AEs by MedDRA High-level Group Term (HLGT)/SMQs/SOC by 
age group are presented for nivo+chemo and chemo treated subjects in Table 46. 
The  frequencies  of  all  causality  AEs  for  subgroups  of  age  < 65,  65  to  74,  and  75  to  84  years  were 
generally similar to the frequencies reported for the overall study population by treatment, with a few 
exceptions: 
•  Nivo+chemo: 
−  Numerically  lower  frequencies  (≥  10% difference)  were  reported  in  the  75  to 84  years  of  age 
subgroup  vs.  the  overall  population  for  total  SAEs  (41.3%  vs.  54.1),  SAEs  with

hospitalization/prolongation  (34.7%  vs.  46.9%),  and  anticholinergic  syndrome  (22.7%  vs. 
35.8%). 
•  Chemo: 
−  Numerically higher frequencies (≥ 10% difference) were reported in the 75 to 84 years of age 
subgroup vs. the overall population for SAEs with fatal (death) outcome (27.7% vs. 13.8%), and 
sum of postural hypotension, falls, blackouts, syncope, dizziness, ataxia, fractures (21.5% vs. 
10.4%).  
Interpretation is limited by the small number of subjects in the > 85 years of age subgroup. 
Safety in subgroups by chemotherapy backbone 
Safety data for all treated subjects by chemotherapy backbone (XELOX and FOLFOX) are presented in 
Table 47. The frequencies of any grade AEs (all causality) and drug-related AEs were generally similar 
between the nivo+chemo arm compared with the chemo arm regardless of the backbone chemotherapy 
(FOLFOX or XELOX); however numerically higher frequencies of Grade 3-4 AEs (all causality) and Grade 
3-4 drug-related AEs were observed in the nivo+chemo arm compared with the chemo arm, regardless 
of the backbone chemotherapy (FOLFOX or XELOX). Also numerically higher frequencies of Grade 3-4 all 
causality  AEs  and  Grade  3-4  drug-related  AEs  were  observed  in  subjects  who  received  FOLFOX  as 
backbone chemotherapy compared with XELOX; this was observed in both the nivo+chemo and chemo 
arms.  The  frequencies  of  all  causality  and  drug-related  select  AEs  and  IMAEs  were  generally  similar 
between nivo+FOLFOX and nivo+XELOX. 
Safety in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 and CPS ≥ 1 
Safety data for all treated subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 in the nivo+chemo and the chemo arms were 
consistent with the safety data for all treated subjects. 
With  nivo+chemo  treatment,  the  overall  frequency  of  death  was  numerically  higher  for  subjects  with 
PD-L1  CPS  <  5  (73.9%)  compared  with  subjects  with  PD-L1  CPS  ≥  5  (65.2%).  This  difference  was 
attributed mainly to disease progression, where the frequency was 65.0% in subjects with PD-L1 CPS 
< 5 vs. 55.6% in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5. The frequency of death due to study drug toxicity for 
treated subjects in the nivo+chemo arm was comparable for subjects with PD-L1 CPS < 5 (1.0%) and 
subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 (1.7%). The frequencies of AEs (all causality and drug-related), SAEs (all 
causality and drug-related), AEs leading to discontinuation (all causality and drug-related), select AEs, 
and OESI were comparable in subjects with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 and PD-L1 CPS < 5. The numerically higher 
frequencies of all causality and drug related SAEs and AEs leading to discontinuation that were observed 
with nivo+chemo vs. chemo in all treated subjects, were also observed in the PD-L1 CPS ≥ 5 and < 5 
subgroups (with similar differences for nivo+chemo vs. chemo in the 2 subgroups). 
Also for the subgroup with PD-L1 CPS ≥ 1, safety data were consistent with the safety data for all treated 
subjects.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No data provided. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
AEs leading to discontinuation were defined as events when 1 or more study drugs of a multidrug regimen 
were discontinued, even if the subject remained on treatment or in follow-up. The overall frequencies of 
all-causality and drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were numerically higher in the nivo+chemo 
arm compared with the chemo arm (Table 30).  
Any-grade AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality) were reported in 371 (47.4%) 
subjects in the nivo+chemo arm, and 251 (32.7%) subjects in the chemo arm (Table 30). Grade 3-4 
AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 194 (24.8%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm, and 113 
(14.7%) subjects in the chemo arm. 
The most common AEs leading to discontinuation (regardless of causality) were: 
•  Nivo+chemo:  neuropathy  peripheral  (7.8%),  malignant  neoplasm  progression  (4.7%),  and 
peripheral sensory neuropathy (4.5%). 
•  Chemo:  neuropathy  peripheral  (5.3%),  peripheral  sensory  neuropathy  (4.7%)  and  malignant 
neoplasm progression (3.7%). 
Any-grade drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were reported in 284 (36.3%) subjects in 
the  nivo+chemo  arm,  and  181  (23.6%)  subjects  in  the  chemo  arm.  Grade 3-4  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation were reported in 132 (16.9%) subjects in the nivo+chemo arm, and 67 (8.7%) subjects 
in the chemo arm. 
The most common drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation were: 
•  Nivo+chemo: neuropathy peripheral (7.5%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (4.5%). 
•  Chemo: neuropathy peripheral (5.2%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (4.7%). 
The  most  common  reason  for  AEs  leading  to  dose  delays  or  reductions  in  both  the  nivo+chemo  and 
chemo arms was haematologic toxicity. Dose reductions were not permitted with nivolumab treatment, 
but they were permitted with chemotherapy as per local standard. The most frequently reported AEs of 
any grade leading to dose delay or reduction were as follows: 
•  Nivo+chemo arm: neutropaenia (20.1%), decreased neutrophil count (13.7%), decreased platelet 
count (10.7%), thrombocytopaenia (10.1%), and diarrhoea (7.8%). 
•  Chemo arm: neutropaenia (16.6%), decreased neutrophil count (10.2%), decreased platelet count 
(8.3%), thrombocytopaenia (7.0%), and diarrhoea (6.8%). 
The most frequently reported drug-related AEs of any grade leading to dose delay or reduction were as 
follows: 
•  Nivo+chemo arm: neutropaenia (18.2%), decreased neutrophil count (13.2%), decreased platelet 
count (10.5%), thrombocytopaenia (9.5%), and diarrhoea (7.3%). 
•  Chemo arm: neutropaenia (15.9%), decreased neutrophil count (9.9%), decreased platelet count 
decreased (8.0%), thrombocytopaenia (6.8%), and diarrhoea (6.4%).

Immunological events 
Of  the  681  nivolumab  ADA  evaluable  subjects  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm,  33  (4.8%)  subjects  were 
nivolumab ADA positive at baseline and 60 (8.8%) subjects were nivolumab ADA positive after the start 
of treatment (Table 4.1.2-1). The number of nivolumab ADA positive subjects was similar in subjects 
who received nivo+XELOX vs. nivo+FOLFOX (33 [10.3%] vs. 27 [7.5%]). 
•  One (0.1%) subject was considered persistent positive and 2 (0.3%) subjects were neutralizing ADA 
positive.  
• 
The highest titer value observed in nivolumab ADA positive subjects was 256. All other titers were 
low, ranging from 0 to 32. 
Effect of immunogenicity on efficacy 
Of the 60 subjects that were nivolumab ADA positive after nivo+chemo treatment, 5 subjects (8.3%) 
had a CR, 29 (48.3%) had a PR, and 19 (31.7%) had SD. The ORR among the ADA positive subjects 
(56.7%) was similar to the ORR (58.0%) in all randomized subjects in the nivo+chemo arm. An ADA 
positive result at the first testing timepoint did not appear to correlate with early disease progression or 
death. For the 2 subjects with neutralizing ADA positive, both had PR with a PFS of more than 1 year. 
Overall, the incidence of ADA or neutralizing ADA did not appear to have negative effects on the efficacy 
of nivo+chemo in this population. 
A swimmers plot of ADA and NAb occurrence in relation to PFS, BOR per BICR and OS in all randomized 
subjects is presented in Figure 21.

Effect of immunogenicity on safety 
The  effect  of  immunogenicity  on  safety  was  assessed  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm.  The  frequency  of 
hypersensitivity/infusion reactions in the ADA-evaluable subjects was 18.3% (11/60) in nivolumab ADA 
positive subjects and 15.8% (98/621) in nivolumab ADA negative subjects (Table 48).

Post marketing experience 
Nivolumab was first approved on 04-Jul-2014 in Japan for unresectable melanoma and has since been 
approved in multiple countries, including the US and in the EU, and for other indications as monotherapy 
(e.g.,  metastatic  NSCLC,  advanced  renal  cell  carcinoma,  classical  Hodgkin  lymphoma,  squamous  cell 
carcinoma of the head and neck, urothelial carcinoma, and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma). In US, 
nivolumab monotherapy was also approved for hepatocellular carcinoma, microsatellite instability-high 
or mismatch repair deficient metastatic colorectal cancer, and small cell lung cancer.  
The MAH states that based on pharmacovigilance activities conducted by BMS Worldwide Patient Safety, 
review  of  post  marketing  safety  data  is  consistent  with,  and  confirms  the  clinical  trial  safety  data  for

nivolumab.  The  safety  profile  of  nivolumab  in  the  post  marketing  setting  remains  favourable.  Post 
marketing  data  for  nivolumab  are  subject  to  continued  active  pharmacovigilance  monitoring  and 
reporting  as  per  applicable  safety  reporting  requirements.  Continuous  safety  monitoring  ensures  that 
updated safety information is available in a timely manner and that any future changes to the benefit-
risk  profile  of  nivolumab  are  appropriately  managed  and  reported.  For  the  most  current  company 
assessment  of  post  marketing  data  and  risk  management  actions  for  nivolumab,  the  MAH  refers  to 
nivolumab  Periodic  Benefit-Risk  Evaluation  Report  (PBRER)  Number  10  (submitted  in  a  separate 
procedure). 
Safety to support the SmPC 
In Section 4.8 of the proposed OPDIVO SmPC for the current application, a new column for the CA209649 
data is added to the adverse reaction table (Table 8), which contains approved data for Study CA2099LA 
(Adverse  reactions  with  nivolumab  in  combination  with  other  therapeutic  agents).  The  newly  added 
column is for the 782 subjects with advanced or metastatic GC/GEJC/EAC from Study CA209649 treated 
with first-line nivo+chemo (nivolumab 240 mg + FOLFOX Q2W or nivolumab 360 mg + XELOX Q3W). 
This regimen has a different composition than other approved regimens; therefore, these data are not 
pooled. 
Also in Section 4.8 of the proposed OPDIVO SmPC for the current application, a new column in Table 11 
has been added (Immune-related adverse reactions leading to permanent discontinuation or requiring 
high-dose corticosteroids by dosing regimen, nivolumab in combination with other therapeutic agents). 
The newly added column presents data for nivo+chemo (nivolumab 240 mg + FOLFOX Q2W or nivolumab 
360  mg  +  XELOX  Q3W)  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  advanced  or  metastatic  gastric  or  gastro-
oesophageal junction or oesophageal adenocarcinoma (CA209649). 
Remapping of preferred terms 
Some Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) preferred terms (PTs) were remapped for 
the purposes of generating summary tables to support Section 4.8 of the nivolumab SmPC (nivolumab 
240 mg + FOLFOX Q2W or nivolumab 360 mg + XELOX Q3W in first-line advanced or metastatic gastric 
or gastro-oesophageal junction or oesophageal adenocarcinoma). Remapping allows for pooling of PTs 
representing the same or similar clinical conditions.  
Identification of clinically relevant adverse reactions 
Selection of specific adverse reactions to be presented in Section 4.4 and Section 4.8 of the nivolumab 
SmPC was based on clinical relevance as determined by the BMS medical reviewer. PTs that met 1 or 
more of the following criteria were excluded from the SmPC: 
•  Overly general/non-specific 
•  No suspected causal relationship to nivolumab per BMS medical review 
•  Single case events with limited data 
•  Medical concept captured under a different term 
Presentation of clinically relevant adverse reactions 
The  list  of  clinically  relevant  adverse  reactions  with  nivolumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  in 
gastric, GEJ, or oesophageal adenocarcinoma is presented in Table 49 alongside the approved data from 
CA2099LA (and also in Section 4.8 of the OPDIVO SmPC). In this table, the frequencies are presented 
by system organ class and by frequency grouping as follows: very common (≥ 1/10); common ≥ 1/100 
to < 1/10); uncommon (≥ 1/1,000 to < 1/100); rare (≥ 1/10,000 to < 1/1,000); very rare (< 1/10,000). 
Within each frequency grouping, adverse reactions are presented in the order of decreasing seriousness.

dermatitis atopic, dermatitis bullous, drug eruption, exfoliative rash, nodular rash, and rash vesicular. 
b  Musculoskeletal pain is a composite term which includes back pain, bone pain, musculoskeletal chest pain, 
c 
myalgia, neck pain, pain in extremity, spinal pain, and musculoskeletal discomfort. 
Frequencies of laboratory terms reflect the proportion of patients who experienced a worsening from baseline in 
laboratory measurements. 
d  Anaemia is a composite term which includes iron deficiency anaemia and haemoglobin decreased. 
e 
Reported in clinical studies and in the post-marketing setting. 
To calculate the frequencies of laboratory adverse reactions, the MAH used the laboratory abnormality 
change  from  baseline  tables,  except  for  hyperglycemia  in  advanced  or  metastatic  GC/GEJC/EAC; 
hyperglycemia was based on the reported adverse reaction. This presentation is a conservative approach 
intended to capture the frequency of all laboratory abnormalities regardless of causality. In doing so, the 
denominator used to compute frequency is the number of patients for whom laboratory abnormalities 
data were reported, as opposed to all treated patients. Hence, there is variability in the denominator for 
each individual laboratory abnormality and their respective reported frequencies.

OPDIVO SmPC. In this application, no amendments or changes in the management of immune-related 
adverse reactions is proposed based on the data from CA209649.  
The following disease-specific precaution is added to Section 4.4 of the proposed OPDIVO SmPC: Patients 
who had baseline ECOG performance score ≥ 2, untreated CNS metastases, active, known, or suspected 
autoimmune disease, or medical conditions requiring systemic immunosuppression were excluded from 
the clinical trial in gastric, GEJ or oesophageal adenocarcinoma (see sections 4.5 and 5.1 of the OPDIVO 
SmPC). In the absence of data, nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy should be used with caution 
in these populations after careful consideration of the potential benefit/risk on an individual basis. Study 
CA209649 excluded patients with known HER2-positive status. Patients with undetermined status were 
allowed in the study and represented 40.3% of patients (see section 5.1 of the OPDIVO SmPC). 
The  MAH  proposed  to  pool  the  following  studies:  nivolumab  monotherapy,  nivolumab  in  combination 
with  chemotherapy,  nivolumab  in  combination  with  ipilimumab  (with  or  without  chemotherapy),  and 
maintain the nivolumab combination with cabozantinib separate due to the distinct safety profile. 
The  general  approach  will  be  that  pooled  data  will be  assessed  side  by  side, to  identify  any  potential 
differential safety profile of clinical relevance. Then, each pool will be displayed side by side with data 
from  studies  of  the  same  tumour  type  within  that  pool.  Based  on  these  assessments  text  will  be 
developed for the SmPC to describe any major potential differences of clinical relevance between and 
within  pools  warranting  different  management  for  an  indication  or  specific  treatment  combination,  or 
awareness. 
The plan for pooling and assessment of the pooled data are acceptable, as in line with the SmPC Guidance 
and the approach as described in Appendix 3 to the Guideline on the clinical evaluation of anticancer 
medicinal products, i.e. the Summary of Product Characteristics for an Anticancer medicinal product – 
mock-up of 4.8. This will be pursued in a future worksharing procedure for nivolumab and ipilimumab. 
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The database to characterise the safety profile of nivolumab in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and 
platinum-based combination chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with advanced 
or  metastatic  gastric,  gastro-oesophageal  junction  or  oesophageal  adenocarcinoma  is  based  on  782 
patients treated  with  nivo+chemo  in  the  investigational  arm  (360  in  combination  with  XELOX,  422  in 
combination with FOLFOX) and 767 patients treated with chemo in the control arm (361  XELOX, 406 
FOLFOX) in study CA209649. In the nivo+chemo arm patients were treated with nivolumab 360 mg plus 
XELOX Q3W or nivolumab 240 mg plus FOLFOX Q2W. The chemo arm included XELOX Q3W and FOLFOX 
Q2W. Subjects were treated until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or a maximum of 2 years 
(for nivolumab treatment). The last patient was randomised in May 2019 and DBL occurred in July 2020. 
Patient  exposure-  Minimum  follow-up  of  the  1549  patients  treated  in  study  CA209649  was  12.1 
months. Median (min-max) duration of therapy was 6.75 (0.0-33.5) months in the nivo+chemo arm and 
4.86 (0.0-34.9) months in the chemo arm. It is noted that in the nivo+chemo group median duration of 
therapy  of  the  nivolumab  component  was  longer  than  for  the  chemotherapy  component.  Especially 
Assessment report  
EMA/556100/2021  
Page 145/158 
 
 
 
 
 
exposure of oxaliplatin was shorter, which was also observed in the chemo control arm. Median duration 
of  chemotherapy  was  longer  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm  compared  to  the  chemo  arm,  suggesting  that 
tolerability  to  chemotherapy  did  not  decrease  by  the  addition  of  nivolumab.  In  the  nivo+chemo  arm 
89.3% discontinued and 94.9% in the chemo arm. The primary reason for discontinuation of treatment 
was  disease  progression  in  both  treatment  arms:  65.9%  in the nivo+chemo group  and  68.8%  in  the 
chemo group. In the nivo+XELOX arm the proportion of patients receiving ≥ 90% of the planned dose 
intensity  was  70.0%  for  nivolumab,  44.2%  for  oxaliplatin,  and  33.9%  for  capecitabine.  In  the 
nivo+FOLFOX arm this was 56.4% for nivolumab, 38.0% for oxaliplatin, 36.7% for leucovorin, 43.3% 
for 5-FU bolus, and 42.9% for 5-FU continuous. In the chemo arm 49.0% for oxaliplatin and 36.5% for 
capecitabine received ≥ 90% of the planned dose intensity in the XELOX arm and for the FOLFOX arm 
this  was  45.0%  for  oxaliplatin,  44.8%  for  leucovorin,  49.3%  for  5-FU  bolus,  and  51.0%  for  5-FU 
continuous.  Prior  to  revised  protocol  07,  all  components  of  the  combination  treatment  were  delayed 
together if a dose delay was required which can explain the relatively low dose intensity of all components 
including nivolumab.  The  majority  of  patients  received  ≥ 70%  of  the  planned dose  intensities  of  each 
component and exposure to chemotherapy was generally comparable in the nivo+chemo vs. chemo arm. 
This implies that adding nivolumab to a XELOX or FOLFOX regimen does not lead to a decreased dose 
intensity of the chemotherapy component. 
Adverse events- Almost all patients reported an AE during study treatment (99.2% in the nivo+chemo 
group vs. 98.0% in the chemo group). The most reported AEs were nausea (47.6%), diarrhoea (39.4%), 
and anaemia (38.2%) for the nivo+chemo arm. In the chemo arm nausea (43.5%), diarrhoea (33.6%), 
and  anaemia  (33.1%)  were  most  commonly  reported.  When  looking  specifically  to  drug-related  AEs, 
most often nausea (41.3%), diarrhoea (32.4%), and neuropathy peripheral (28.3%) were seen in the 
nivo+chemo  arm.  For  the  chemo  arm,  most  frequently  drug-related  AEs  reported  were  also  nausea 
(38.1%),  diarrhoea  (26.9%),  and  neuropathy  peripheral  (24.8%).  Grade  3-4  AEs  were  observed  in 
69.1% vs. 59.5% in the nivo+chemo vs. chemo arm, respectively. Neutropaenia (16.9%), decreased 
neutrophil count (11.5%), and anaemia (11.0%) were the most commonly seen Grade 3-4 AEs in the 
nivo+chemo arm; neutropaenia (13.0%), decreased neutrophil count (9.1%), and anaemia (7.3%) in 
the chemo arm. As shown by the frequencies of the most common AEs, the type of AEs are overlapping 
(gastrointestinal toxicity, bone marrow depression, and peripheral neuropathy) but the incidences are 
numerically higher in the nivo+chemo vs. the chemo arm suggesting additive toxicity when combining 
nivolumab with chemotherapy. The observed AEs are also more severe in grade, with a 10% difference 
in reported Grade 3-4 AEs between the treatment groups. 
Serious  adverse  events-  The  overall  frequencies  of  SAEs  (all-causality  and  drug-related)  were 
numerically higher with nivo+chemo than with chemo. Any Grade SAEs (regardless of causality) were 
reported in 54.1% in the nivo+chemo arm vs. 43.7% in the chemo arm. The most frequently reported 
SAEs in the nivo+chemo group were malignant neoplasm progression (13.9%), vomiting (3.2%), and 
anaemia  (3.1%).  For  the  chemo  arm  these  were  malignant  neoplasm  progression  (11.7%),  vomiting 
(3.1%), and dysphagia (2.1%). Any-grade drug-related SAEs were reported in 22.0% in the nivo+chemo 
arm and in 12.1% in the chemo arm. The most frequently reported drug-related SAEs were diarrhoea 
(2.2%), pneumonitis (2.2%), and febrile neutropaenia (2.0%) in the nivo+chemo arm. These numbers 
again show that the toxicity observed in the nivo+chemo group is more severe than in the chemo group. 
Deaths-  The  number  of  treated  patients  who  died  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm  was  numerically  lower 
compared to the chemo arm. Disease progression was the most common cause of death in both arms. 
Death attributed to study drug toxicity was reported in 12 (1.5%) and 4 (0.5%) treated patients in the 
nivo+chemo  and  chemo  arms,  respectively.  Per  investigator  assessment,  3  deaths  were  due  to 
nivolumab, 2 deaths were due to nivolumab and chemotherapy, and 7 deaths were due to chemotherapy 
in the nivo+chemo arm. The causes of death due to nivolumab were pulmonitis, interstitial lung disease 
and  pneumonitis.  The  causes  of  death  due  to  nivolumab  and  chemotherapy  were  infection  and 
Assessment report  
EMA/556100/2021  
Page 146/158 
 
 
 
 
 
gastrointestinal toxicity. The causes of death due to chemotherapy were neutropaenic fever, intestinal 
mucositis, stroke, gastrointestinal bleeding, septic shock, pneumonia, and febrile neutropaenia. Deaths 
attributed to other reasons were reported in 6.3% and 5.7% of treated patients in the nivo+chemo and 
chemo arms, respectively. There were 4 events reported as “related” per investigator (all in nivo+chemo 
arm):  thrombosis  mesenteric  vessel,  disseminated  intravascular  coagulation,  cerebral  infarction  and 
pneumonitis. Per investigator, the pneumonitis was reported as related to nivolumab and the other 3 
events were reported as related to both nivolumab and chemotherapy.  The MAH explained that in the 
4  cases  of  death  “attributed  to  other  reasons”  that  were  reported  as  “related”  per  investigator,  the 
investigators captured the deaths as “other” because the cause of death was attributed to multiple factors 
or in case study drug toxicity could not be fully ruled out. 
Discontinuations-  The  overall  frequencies  of  all-causality  and  drug-related  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation were numerically higher in the nivo+chemo (47.4% and 36.3%) arm compared with the 
chemo  arm  (32.7%  and  23.6%).  The  most  common  AEs  leading  to  discontinuation  (regardless  of 
causality) were neuropathy peripheral (7.8%), malignant neoplasm progression (4.7%), and peripheral 
sensory  neuropathy  (4.5%)  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm.  For  the  chemo  arm  these  were  neuropathy 
peripheral (5.3%), peripheral sensory neuropathy (4.7%) and malignant neoplasm progression (3.7%). 
The most frequently observed drug-related AEs leading to discontinuation in the nivo+chemo arm were 
neuropathy peripheral (7.5%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (4.5%). The most common reason for 
AEs leading to dose delays or reductions in both the nivo+chemo and chemo arms was haematologic 
toxicity. Although the reasons for discontinuation are not unexpected, the number of discontinuations 
are high in both arms with a 15% higher incidence in the nivo+chemo arm compared to the chemo arm. 
The  high  number  of  discontinuations  due  to  AEs  in  the  control  arm  reflect  that  toxicity  of  first-line 
chemotherapy  treatment  with  XELOX  or  FOLFOX  in  this  patient  population  is  considerable  and  the 
addition of nivolumab worsens the toxicity profile.  
Adverse events of special interest- Based on previous experience with (nivolumab) immunotherapy, 
the  MAH  defined  AEs  of  special  interest  and  reported  on  select  adverse  events,  immune-mediated 
adverse events (IMAEs) and other events of special interest (OESIs). Endocrine, gastrointestinal, hepatic, 
pulmonary,  renal,  skin  and  hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions  were  analysed  as  select  AE  categories. 
The  most  frequently  reported  drug-related  select  AE  categories  were  gastrointestinal  (33.5%),  skin 
(27.4%) and hepatic (26.0%) in the nivo+chemo arm and gastrointestinal (27.0%), hepatic (17.5%), 
and  skin  (13.7%)  in  the  chemo  arm.  On  PT  level,  diarrhoea  (32.4%),  increased  AST  (15.6%),  and 
palmar-plantar  erythrodysaesthesia  syndrome  (12.0%)  were  most  commonly  reported  in  the 
nivo+chemo arm. In the chemo arm, these were diarrhoea (26.9%), palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia 
syndrome (10.6%), and increased AST (9.0%). Most select AEs were Grade 1-2 and had resolved at the 
time  of  database  lock  with  a  median  time  to  resolution  ranging  from  0.14  to  72.14  weeks.  Some 
endocrine select AEs were not considered resolved due to the continuing need for hormone replacement 
therapy. 
IMAEs  included  diarrhoea/colitis,  hepatitis,  pneumonitis,  nephritis  and  renal  dysfunction,  rash, 
hypersensitivity/infusion  reactions,  and  endocrine  events  occurring  within  100  days  of  the  last  dose 
irrespective of causality but identified by the investigator with no clear etiology and an immune-mediated 
component.  With  the  exception  of  endocrine  events,  IMAEs  were  limited  to  events  needing  immune-
modulating medication. The majority of IMAEs were Grade 1-2 and the most frequently reported IMAEs 
in  the  investigational  arm  were  hypothyroidism/thyroiditis  (9.5%),  rash  (6.5%),  and  pneumonitis 
(4.2%). In the chemo arm hypothyroidism/thyroiditis and rash were most frequently observed with an 
incidence  of  <1%.  The  majority  of  events  were  manageable  using  the  established  management 
algorithms,  with  resolution  occurring  when  immune-modulating  medications  (mostly  systemic 
corticosteroids)  were  administered.  Except  for  some  endocrine  events,  most  IMAEs  with  nivo+chemo 
treatment had resolved at the time of DBL.

OESIs are events that do not fulfill all criteria to qualify as IMAEs. These events may differ from those 
caused  by  non-immunotherapies  and  may  require  immunosuppression  as  part  of  their  management. 
Overall, OESIs were reported in 8/782 (1.0%) patients (10 events) in the nivo+chemo arm and 4/767 
(0.5%) patients (5 events) in the chemo arm. The events observed in the nivo+chemo arm were Grade 3 
Guillain-Barre syndrome, Grade 2 chorioretinitis, Grade 3 encephalitis, 4 events of pancreatitis (Grade 
1-4), and 3 events of myocarditis (Grade 1 and 3). 9/10 OESIs in the nivo+chemo arm and 4/5 OESIs 
in the chemo arm were resolved at the time of database lock. 7/10 and 1/5 OESIs were resolved with 
immune-modulating medication in the nivo+chemo and chemo arms, respectively. 
The provided data on adverse events of special interest show that the toxicity profile of nivo+chemo is 
not only overlapping (see section on AEs above), but also differs from the chemo arm with the occurrence 
of immune-related adverse events. There are no suggestions that the addition of XELOX or FOLOX to 
nivolumab  induces  unexpected  immune-related  adverse  events  based  on  experience  with  previously 
approved indications. 
Laboratory  findings-  On-treatment  laboratory  abnormalities  were  more  frequently  observed  in  the 
nivo+chemo arm vs. the chemo arm, for haematology (main difference was found in decreased absolute 
neutrophil  count),  liver  tests,  kidney  functions  tests,  and  thyroid  tests.  Most  laboratory  abnormalities 
were Grade 1-2. Based on laboratory results reported after the first dose and within 30 days of last dose 
of study therapy, 13/764 (1.7%) patients in the nivo+chemo arm had concurrent ALT or AST >3×ULN 
with total bilirubin >2×ULN within 1 or 30 days, while 6/737 (0.8%) and 7/737 (0.9%) patients in the 
chemo  arm  had  concurrent  ALT  or  AST >3×ULN  with  total  bilirubin  >2×ULN  within  1 day  and  within 
30 days,  respectively.  In  3  of  the  13  cases  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm,  the  abnormal  hepatic  laboratory 
findings  were  reported  as  related  to  nivolumab  alone  or  to  both  nivolumab  and  chemotherapy.  All  3 
patients  were  treated  with  high  dose  immune-modulating  medication  and  improved  after  treatment, 
supporting that the aetiologie was immune-mediated. In 1 case the patients had to discontinue study 
treatment due to the abnormal hepatic laboratory findings led to study treatment discontinuation.   
Safety  in  subgroups-  Differences  between  frequencies  of  drug-related  AEs  were  observed  for 
subgroups. In the group of patients treated with nivo+chemo the frequency of Grade 3-4 AEs was higher 
in the US/Canada population (72.1%) vs. other regions (~55% and overall 59%). Of note, most patients 
in the US/Canada regions received FOLFOX and the number of Grade 3-4 AEs was higher in the FOLFOX 
versus XELOX group (67.8% in the nivo+FOLFOX group and 49.5% in the nivo+XELOX group), possibly 
explaining the differences found based on geographic region. In both treatment arms, female patients 
experienced more Grade 3-4 drug-related AEs compared to males. 
The frequencies of all causality AEs for subgroups of age <65, 65 to 74, and 75 to 84 years were generally 
similar to the frequencies reported for the overall study population by treatment. It is noted that for the 
age  group  75-84  years  treated  with  nivo+chemo,  the  number  of  SAEs,  vascular  disorders  and 
anticholinergic syndrome were lower. Conclusions are however difficult to draw with the small number 
of patients in this group (n=75). Only 2 patients older than 85 years were treated with nivo+chemo. 
Safety data for all treated patients with PD-L1 CPS ≥5 or ≥1 in the nivo+chemo and the chemo arms 
were consistent with the safety data for all treated patients. 
Immunogenicity- Of the 681 nivolumab ADA evaluable patients in the nivo+chemo arm, 33 (4.8%) 
patients were nivolumab ADA positive at baseline and 60 (8.8%) patients were nivolumab ADA positive 
after the start of treatment. One (0.1%) patient was considered persistent positive and 2 (0.3%) patients 
were neutralizing ADA positive. The ORR among the ADA positive subjects (56.7%) was similar to the 
ORR  (58.0%)  in  all  randomised  patients  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm.  For  the  2  patients  with  neutralising 
ADA positive, both had PR with a PFS of more than 1 year. The frequency of hypersensitivity/infusion 
reactions  in  the  ADA-evaluable  patients  was  18.3%  (11/60)  in  nivolumab  ADA  positive  patients  and 
15.8%  (98/621)  in  nivolumab  ADA  negative  patients.  The  incidence  of  ADA’s  is  similar  to  what  is 
Assessment report  
EMA/556100/2021  
Page 148/158 
 
 
 
 
 
previously reported for nivolumab in other tumour types. The presence of ADA’s did not appear to have 
an effect on the occurrence of hypersensitivity/infusion reactions. 
This  is  the  first  application  combining  nivolumab  mono-immunotherapy  with  chemotherapy  and  it  is 
therefore  difficult  to  put the  toxicity  profile into  perspective  with  what is  known  for  nivolumab.  When 
comparing  reported  frequencies  with  the  approved  indication  of  nivolumab  in  combination  with 
ipilimumab and 2 cycles of platinum-based chemotherapy for first-line metastatic NSCLC, all causality 
AEs and drug-related deaths appear to occur in similar frequencies. Grade 3-4 AEs (mainly drug-related), 
Grade 3-4 SAEs and discontinuations are reported more often in the study investigating gastric cancer 
(study  CA209649)  compared  with  the  NSCLC  study  (study  CA2099LA;  see  also  EPAR  procedure 
EMEA/H/C/xxxx/WS/1783).  It  is  however  also  noted  that  for  the  treatment  of  NSCLC,  patients  were 
treated  with  only  2  cycles  of  chemotherapy  and  also  the  toxicity  of  the  chemo  arm  in the  study  with 
gastric patients is higher than in the chemo arm of study with NSCLC patients. Furthermore, the patients 
groups studied (NSCLC or gastric cancer) are different populations. Definitive conclusions about how the 
safety profile found in CA209649 compares to other nivolumab studies are therefore difficult to make. 
Data for the nivo+ipi arm were not provided in this procedure. Enrollment was stopped in this arm due 
to observed increased early death rate in nivolumab plus ipilimumab arm as well as the increased toxicity 
rate. The final analysis of the nivo+ipi arm is planned for July 2021 and data submission for Q4 2021.  
The nivo+ipi arm of study CA209649 is added to the Letter of Recommendation. Of note, at the most 
recent safety review of the study in March 2021, the DMC recommended that the study should continue 
as planned.   
2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Treatment of nivo+chemo is characterised by substantial toxicity with a high number of discontinuations. 
Nivo+chemo treatment is less tolerated than treatment with chemo only as shown by the higher number 
of  (drug-related)  AEs,  Grade  3-4  AEs,  SAEs,  drug-related  deaths  due  to  AEs,  and  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuations. It is noted that the toxicity profile of the chemo control arm in this first-line population 
is  already  considerable.  Next  to  nivolumab  and  chemotherapy  overlapping  toxicities  such  as  gastro-
intestinal AEs, bone marrow depression, and peripheral neuropathy, also nivolumab-specific toxicity with 
immune-related AEs are observed with the addition of nivolumab to the chemotherapy regimen. Although 
the type of AEs are reflective of the known safety profile of nivolumab immunotherapy and chemotherapy 
and no new safety issues were identified, the severity of the toxicity is considerable and should be valued 
against  the  observed  benefit  in  patients  with  advanced  or  metastatic  gastric,  gastro-oesophageal  or 
oesophageal adenocarcinoma. 
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
The  MAH  is  seeking  an  extension  of  indication  for  OPDIVO  in  combination  with  fluoropyrimidine-  and 
platinum-based  combination  chemotherapy  for  the  first-line  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  HER2-
negative  advanced  or  metastatic  gastric,  gastrooesophageal  junction  or  oesophageal  adenocarcinoma 
whose tumours express PD-L1 with a combined positive score (CPS)≥5. 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Gastric  cancer  (GC)  is  the  5th  leading  cancer  and  the  3rd  leading  cause  of  cancer-related  deaths 
worldwide.  Oesophageal  cancer  is  the  7th  leading  cancer  and  the  6th  leading  cause  of  cancer-related 
deaths  worldwide.  GC/gastric  oesophageal  junction  carcinoma  (GEJC)/oesophageal  adenocarcinoma 
(OAC) remain a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, with an estimated 1 million deaths 
worldwide in 2018. 
Adenocarcinoma  is  the  most  common  (>  90%)  histological  subtype  for  GCs  worldwide  and  OAC  has 
increased in North America and Europe (EU). 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Treatment  recommendations  for  advanced  or  metastatic  GC,  GEJ  and  OAC,  are  almost  the  same. 
Platinum compounds (oxaliplatin and cisplatin) and fluoropyrimidines (5-fluorouracil, capecitabine, and 
tegafur/gimeracil/oteracil  potassium)  are  considered  first-line  standard-of-care  treatments  for 
metastatic GC/GEJC/OAC across geographic regions (ESMO 2016; NCCN 2020).  
In patients with HER2 positive tumour, the addition of trastuzumab to platinum and fluoropyrimidine-
based chemotherapy is recommended. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The  evidence  in  support  of  the  claimed  indication  is  based  on  results  from  the  study  CA209649 
(CheckMate  649).  The  study  CA209649  is  a  Phase  3,  randomised,  multicentre,  open-label  study  of 
nivolumab  plus  ipilimumab  or  nivolumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  (oxaliplatin  plus 
fluoropyrimidine)  versus  chemotherapy  (oxaliplatin  plus  fluoropyrimidine)  in  subjects  with  previously 
untreated  advanced  or  metastatic  gastric,  gastro  oesophageal  junction  (GEJ)  cancer  or  oesophageal 
adenocarcinoma (OAC). 
The primary endpoints were overall survival (OS) and progression free survival (PFS), as assessed by 
BIRC per RECIST 1.1 criteria, in patients with PD-L1 CPS≥5. OS in patients with PD-L1 CPS≥1 and all 
randomised  patients  were  included  as  secondary  endpoints.  Other  secondary  endpoint  were  PFS  and 
ORR. A hierarchical testing strategy was used for the primary endpoints and OS in PD-L1 CPS≥1 and all-
randomised patients.  
All the analyses presented below are on patients concurrently randomized to the nivo+chemo or chemo 
arm. A total of 1,581 were randomised to receive either nivo+chemo (n=789) or chemo (n =792). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Primary endpoints (PD-L1 CPS≥5) 
Assessment report  
EMA/556100/2021  
Page 153/158 
 
 
 
 
 
OS  results  (even  rate  65.3%  nivo+chemo  vs.  75.1%  chemo)  showed  a  statistically  significant 
improvement in favour of the nivo+chemo arm over chemo arm (HR 0.71; 98.4% CI: 0.59, 0.86). Median 
OS was of 14.39 (95% CI: 13.11, 16.23) months in the nivo+chemo group and 11.10 (95% CI: 10.02, 
12.09) months in the chemo group. 
PFS results were also statistically significant in favour of the nivo+chemo arm (HR 0.68; 98% CI: 0.56, 
0.81). Median PFS was 7.69 (95% CI: 7.03, 9.17) months and 6.05 (95% CI: 5.55, 6.90) months, in 
the nivo+chemo and chemo groups, respectively. 
Secondary endpoints 
In  patients  with  PD-L1  CPS≥1  a  statistically  significant  improvement  in  OS  was  observed  with 
nivo+chemo over chemo (HR 0.77; 99.3 CI: 0.64, 0.92). Median PFS was 13.96 (95% CI: 12.55, 14.98) 
months in the nivo+chemo arm vs. 11.33 (95% CI: 10.64, 12.25) months in the chemo arm.  
OS in the all-randomised patients (event rate of 69% in the nivo+chemo arm and 75% in the chemo 
arm), show a statistically significant benefit of nivo+chemo over control (HR of 0.80 [99.3% CI: 0.68, 
0.94]). Median OS was of 13.83 (95% CI: 12.55, 14.55) months and 11.56 (95% CI: 10.87, 12.48) 
months in the experimental and control arm, respectively.  
Results  in  terms  of  PFS  in  the  all-randomised  patients  were  consistent  with  the  OS  analysis  and 
favoured also the nivo+chemo arm (HR 0.77; 95% CI: 0.68, 0.87). Median PFS was 7.66 (95%CI: 7.10, 
8.54) months in the nivo+chemo arm versus 6.93 (95% CI: 6.60, 7.13) months in the chemo arm. 
The  ORR  was  higher  in  the  nivo+chemo  arm  compared  with  the  chemo  arm  (58%  vs.  46.1%, 
respectively), in the all-randomised patients with measurable disease at baseline. 
Updated efficacy data  
During  the  procedure  updated  efficacy  data,  including  OS  as  well  as  PFS,  ORR  and  DoR  per  BICR, 
providing  7.3  months  of  additional  follow-up  (DBL  of  16-Feb-2021)  were  submitted.  Results  are 
consistent with those previously reported. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
While  statistically  significant  benefit  of  nivo+chemo  over  chemo  in  terms  of  OS  (and  also  PFS)  was 
observed in the all-randomised patient population the effect appears to be driven by patients with PD-
L1 CPS≥5, which comprises the primary efficacy population in this study. In patients with PD-L1 CPS <5 
no clinically meaningful benefit was observed. Therefore, the indication has been restricted to patients 
with PD-L1 CPS≥5. 
Patients with known HER2-positive status were not allowed to enter the study. However, there were 643 
(40.7%) patients for whom HER2 status was undetermined. Although it is expected that most of these 
patients were HER2-negative (based on the expected prevalence of HER2 positivity in the intended target 
population)  this  has  not  been  confirmed.  In  the  absence  of  such  confirmation,  no  conclusion  can  be 
drawn  on  whether  HER2-positive  patients  could  also  benefit  from  the  addition  of  nivolumab  to 
chemotherapy treatment. This has been reflected in the wording of the indication. In fact, to demonstrate 
the  effect  of  nivolumab+chemotherapy  in  HER2-positive  patients  a  different  study  design,  with  a 
comparator including trastuzumab, would normally have been required.  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The database used for the safety profile of nivo+chemo in patients with advanced or metastatic gastric, 
gastro-oesophageal or oesophageal adenocarcinoma consists of 782 patients treated with nivo+chemo 
and is compared with 767 patients treated with chemo control with a minimum follow-up of 12.1 months. 
Assessment report  
EMA/556100/2021  
Page 154/158 
 
 
 
 
 
Median duration of therapy  was 6.75 months in the nivo+chemo arm and 4.86 months in the chemo 
arm. 
Nivo+chemo treatment is less well tolerated than treatment with chemo only as shown by the higher 
number of (drug-related) AEs (all causality 99.2% vs. 98.0%, drug-related 94.4% vs. 88.5%), Grade 3-
4 AEs (69.1% vs. 59.5%), SAEs (54.1% vs. 43.7%), drug-related deaths due to AEs (1.5% vs. 0.5%), 
and AEs leading to discontinuations (47.4% vs. 32.7%). 
Next to nivolumab and chemotherapy overlapping toxicities such as gastro-intestinal AEs, bone marrow 
depression,  and  peripheral  neuropathy,  also  nivolumab-specific  toxicity  with  immune-related  AEs  are 
observed. The most commonly reported AEs in the nivo+chemo group were nausea (47.6%), diarrhoea 
(39.4%),  and  anaemia  (38.2%).  When  looking  specifically  to  drug-related  AEs,  most  often  nausea 
(41.3%), diarrhoea (32.4%), and neuropathy peripheral (28.3%) were seen in the nivo+chemo arm. As 
expected, select AEs, immune-mediated adverse events (IMAEs), and other events of special interest 
(OESIs) occurred more frequently with nivo+chemo relative to chemotherapy. 
The most common AEs leading to discontinuation in the nivo+chemo arm (regardless of causality) were 
neuropathy  peripheral  (7.8%),  malignant  neoplasm  progression  (4.7%),  and  peripheral  sensory 
neuropathy (4.5%).  
The causes of death due to nivolumab were pulmonitis, interstitial lung disease and pneumonitis. The 
causes of death due to nivolumab and chemotherapy were infection and gastrointestinal toxicity. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety profile is based on an open-label design study which might introduce bias in the reporting of 
AEs.  The  type  of  AEs  reported  is  however  not  unexpected  with  what  is  known  about  nivolumab  and 
XELOX/FOLFOX treatments.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
In study CA209649 treatment with nivolumab in combination with chemotherapy (XELOX or FOLFOX) 
showed a statistically significant OS benefit compared with chemotherapy (XELOX or FOLFOX) alone in 
the  all-randomised  patient  population.  However,  results  appear  to  be  driven  by  patients  with  PD-L1 
CPS≥5 with lack of efficacy benefit observed in patients with PD-L1 CPS <5. Therefore, the indication 
has been restricted to patients with PD-L1 CPS≥5, which in fact was the primary efficacy population in 
this study. 
Assessment report  
EMA/556100/2021  
Page 156/158 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
From a safety point of view, treatment of nivo+chemo is characterised by substantial toxicity with a high 
number of discontinuations. Nivo+chemo treatment is less tolerated than treatment with chemo only as 
shown by the higher number of (drug-related) AEs, Grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs, drug-related deaths due to 
AEs, and AEs leading to discontinuations. It is noted that the toxicity profile of the chemo control arm in 
this  first-line  population  is  already  considerable.  Next  to  nivolumab  and  chemotherapy  overlapping 
toxicities  such  as  gastro-intestinal  AEs,  bone  marrow  depression,  and  peripheral  neuropathy,  also 
nivolumab-specific toxicity with immune-related AEs are observed with the addition of nivolumab to the 
chemotherapy regimen. Although the type of AEs are reflective of the known safety profile of nivolumab 
immunotherapy and chemotherapy and no new safety issues were identified, the severity of the toxicity 
is considerable and should be valued against the observed benefit in patients with advanced or metastatic 
gastric, gastro-oesophageal junction or oesophageal adenocarcinoma. 
Finally, the wording of the indication has been revised to include treatment of HER2-negative patients 
only. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In  study  CA209649  nivolumab  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  demonstrated  superiority  over 
chemotherapy alone in OS, PFS and ORR in the overall population (i.e. regardless of PD-L1 CPS status). 
However,  considering  the  lack  of  efficacy  benefit  observed  with  nivolumab+chemotherapy  in  patients 
with  PD-L1  CPS<5  and  that  the  proposed  combination  is  more  toxic  and  less  well  tolerated  than 
chemotherapy alone, the benefit/risk ratio in patients with PD-L1 CPS<5 is currently considered negative. 
Therefore, the indication has been restricted to patients with PD-L1 CPS≥5.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
N/A 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The benefit/risk ratio of OPDIVO in combination with fluoropyrimidine- and platinum-based 
chemotherapy for the first-line treatment of adult patients with HER2-negative advanced or metastatic 
GC, GEJ or OAC is considered positive for patients whose tumours express PD-L1 with a CPS≥5.

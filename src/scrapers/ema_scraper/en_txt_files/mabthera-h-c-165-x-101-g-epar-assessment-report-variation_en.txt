1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Roche Registration Limited submitted to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) on 05 
November 2014 an extension application grouped with two type II variations to the Marketing 
Authorisation of MabThera. The application concerned a new strength of 1600 mg solution for 
subcutaneous injection, an update of the product information of 1400 mg solution for subcutaneous 
injection strength as a consequence to the line extension application, and an update of the RMP to 
include new information relevant to chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and update of the educational 
materials. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, Annex I point 2(c) – Change or addition of a new 
strength/potency and Article 7.2 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 – Grouping of variations.

positive recommendation for the approval to the variations to Product Information and Risk 
Management Plan.  
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Rituximab is a chimeric murine/human monoclonal antibody that binds to cluster of differentiation 20 
(CD20) protein, a hydrophobic transmembrane protein present on the cell surface of pre-B- and mature 
B-lymphocytes but not on hematopoietic stem cells, pro-B-cells, normal plasma cells, or other normal 
tissue. In particular, CD20 is present on the malignant B-lymphocytes in the majority of patients with 
mature B-cell lymphomas and leukemias. The binding of rituximab to CD20 on B-lymphocytes eliminates 
these cells via a number of different possible mechanisms, including antibody-dependent cellular 
cytotoxicity, complement-dependent cytotoxicity, and induction of apoptosis. 
MabThera (rituximab) received MA in EU in June 1998 as concentrate for solution for infusion (strengths 
100 mg and 500 mg) for intravenous use initially for the treatment of CD20-positive non-Hodgkin’s 
lymphoma (NHL), and subsequently for the following indications: treatment of chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia (CLL), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), and microscopic 
polyangiitis (MPA). 
A subcutaneous formulation in which rituximab has been concentrated 12-fold to 120 mg/mL with the 
addition of recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20) was approved in February 2014 for the 
treatment of previously untreated patients with stage III-IV follicular lymphoma in combination with 
chemotherapy; as a maintenance therapy is indicated for the treatment of follicular lymphoma patients 
responding to induction therapy; as monotherapy for treatment of patients with stage III-IV follicular 
lymphoma who are chemoresistant or are in their second or subsequent relapse after chemotherapy;  for 
the treatment of patients with CD20 positive diffuse large B cell non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma in combination 
with CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, prednisolone) chemotherapy. The recommended 
dose of MabThera subcutaneous formulation used for adult patients with NHL is a subcutaneous injection 
at a fixed dose of 1400 mg irrespective of the patient’s body surface area.  
The  present  application  for  a  line  extension  provides  data  to  support  the  registration  of  an  additional 
strength of the subcutaneous formulation: 1600 mg, which is intended for the treatment of CLL only. 
Currently,  immunochemotherapy  with  rituximab,  fludarabine  and  cyclophosphamide  (R-FC)  is  the 
standard of care in previously untreated patients with CLL requiring treatment and clinically established 
treatment option for patients with previously treated CLL. The recommended dose of rituximab IV for 
patients with CLL (previously untreated and relapsed/refractory) is 375 mg/m2 body surface area (BSA) 
at the first treatment cycle followed by 500 mg/m2 BSA at each subsequent cycle at intervals of 4 weeks, 
for a total of six cycles.  
With the current rituximab IV formulations provided as concentrate, solutions have to be prepared and 
administered as infusions, over typically 2 − 4 hours. For many patients the relatively long infusion times 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 6/65 
 
 
and need for repeated invasive IV access are undesirable aspects of the current therapeutic approach. 
Increased usage of rituximab has also placed a strain on medical resources at many centers with respect 
to time and resources required to prepare and administer the infusion. As for MabThera 1400 mg solution 
for subcutaneous injection in NHL, the new 1600 mg subcutaneous strength, for use in CLL, will offer 
significant  benefits  for  both  patients  and  healthcare  providers  such  as:  a  shorter  administration  time 
(approximately 7 minutes), an alternative route of administration for patients with poor venous access, 
improved  patient  convenience  and  comfort,  alleviation  of  resource  constraints  associated  with  the  IV 
route of administration. 
The same technology as for MabThera 1400 mg solution for subcutaneous injection is used in the new 
1600 mg strength i.e. adding recombinant human hyaluronidase (rHuPH20), a permeation enhancer, in 
the SC  formulation. Hyaluronidase transiently hydrolyses hyaluronan (a component of the SC matrix) 
resulting in decreased viscosity of the SC matrix and, thus, to an improved delivery of SC administered 
drugs into the systemic circulation. The decreased viscosity of the  SC matrix  allows administration of 
larger volumes of fluid. 
The currently applied for indication for the subcutaneous formulation of rituximab has the same target 
population as rituximab IV, i.e. “MabThera 1600 mg solution for subcutaneous formulation injection is 
indicated  in  adults  in  combination  with  chemotherapy  for  the  treatment  of  patients  with  previously 
untreated  and  relapsed/refractory  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia.  Only  limited  data  are  available  on 
efficacy  and  safety  for  patients  previously  treated  with  monoclonal  antibodies  including  MabThera  or 
patients refractory to previous MabThera plus chemotherapy.” 
The applicant has received CHMP Scientific advice on quality aspects – specifically on use of rHUPH20 as 
an excipient, in line with advice received in the context of the 1400 mg SC strength; the advice has been 
followed. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
F. Hoffmann - La Roche Ltd. (Roche) is the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH) for MabThera. This 
medicinal product was initially approved for marketing in Europe in 1998 as concentrate for solution for 
infusion (strengths 100 mg and 500 mg (10 mg/ml)). 
A new formulation (solution for subcutaneous injection) was developed as an alternative to the currently 
above-mentioned licensed pharmaceutical forms: MabThera 1400 mg solution for subcutaneous injection 
(120 mg/ml), which was granted a Market Authorization on 21 March 2014 (EMEA/H/C/156/X/83). 
The  present  application  provides  data  to  support  the  registration  of  an  additional  strength  of  the 
subcutaneous  formulation:  1600  mg  solution  for  subcutaneous  injection.  The  active  substance  is 
formulated with the same excipients as the 1400 mg presentation. The finished product in MabThera 1600 
mg is presented in a Type I glass vial with butyl rubber stopper, aluminium over seal and a blue plastic 
flip-off disk. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The  manufacture  and  control  of  1400  mg  and  the  1600  mg  MabThera  SC  solutions  are  identical.  To 
achieve a higher strength corresponding to the fixed dose posology regimen of 1600 mg, the volume of 
finished product solution in the vial had to be increased accordingly and is therefore filled into a larger vial 
(20mL).  
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 7/65 
 
Although the filling of additional product into a slightly bigger vial only covers few sections of the dossier, 
all  previously  submitted  sections  in  Notice  to  Applicants  format  has  been  provided  again  but  now  as 
electronic  CTD  format.  Some  few  issues  have  been  introduced  into  these  new  CTD  dossier  sections. 
However, these changes are all based on requirements/issues raised in procedure EMEA/H/C/156/X/83 
(introduction of MabThera SC, 1400 mg) and are therefore acceptable. 
The manufacture and control of rituximab active substance 120 mg/ml remains unchanged compared to 
the approved process (EMEA/H/C/156/X/83). 
A shelf life of 24 months at -20°C is approved for rituximab SC active substance (120 mg/ml).  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description and composition of MabThera SC, 1600 mg is identical to the currently approved MabThera SC 
1400 mg (EMEA/H/C/156/X/0083).  
The only difference in the finished product manufacturing process of the 1600 mg strength, compared to 
the  currently  approved  process,  is  the  higher  fill  volume  needed  to  achieve  the  target  1600  mg 
strength.Validation  of  the  manufacturing  for  MabThera  SC  1600  mg  was  preceded  by  both  process 
development and extensive manufacturing experience with MabThera SC 1400 mg manufactured in the 
same facility. 
The  program  for  the  validation  of  the  MabThera  SC  1600  mg  finished  product  manufacturing  process 
consisted of the manufacture of three consecutive finished product batches at commercial batch size. All 
three validation batches were processed at the commercial manufacturing facility, using the process and 
type of equipment to be used for commercial manufacturing. All the relevant qualification procedures for 
the equipment (compounding, fill and finish) and areas were performed prior to the process validation 
batches. 
Beside  the  in-process  controls  applicable  to  the  routine  manufacturing  process  additional  testing  was 
performed during the validation. 
All in-process and release data presented for the three validation batches are within the specifications and 
support that the manufacture of MabThera SC 1600 mg is consistent and robust.  
The  finished  product  specification  for  MabThera  SC  1600  mg  is  identical  to  the  already  approved 
specification  for  MabThera  SC  1400  mg,  with  one  exception,  which  is  the  extractable  volume.  For 
MabThera SC 1600 mg the specification for extractable volume is: minimum 13.4 ml.  
The vial, stopper and seal used for MabThera SC 1600 mg are of the same quality as already used for the 
1400 mg presentation and do therefore not call for comments. For the 1600 mg presentation, a 20 ml vial 
is used. For the currently approved 1400 mg presentation, a 15 ml vial is used.  
Based on all the stability data generated with the commercial product (SC 1600 mg), together with the 
supportive stability data, a shelf life of MabThera SC 1600 mg (20 ml vial) of 30 months at 2-8°C is 
acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The issue identified during the review was addressed by the Applicant. This issue resulted in a 
Recommendation for future quality development. 
2.2.5. Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 8/65 
 
In conclusion, based on the review of the Quality data provided, this line extension application is 
considered approvable. 
2.2.6. Recommendation for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of marketing authorisation holders to take due account of technical and 
scientific progress, the CHMP recommended a point for investigation.  
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
In support of the current extension application for a 1600 mg rituximab SC formulation for use in CLL, the 
Applicant has submitted updated nonclinical overviews, and referenced the studies already submitted in 
support of the 1400 mg rituximab SC formulation (approved for NHL).  
In the overview, safety margins have been re-calculated to reflect the higher dose level of the current 
application. This higher dose (1600 mg rituximab), is achieved by administering a slightly higher volume, 
of the already approved formulation used for the 1400 mg rituximab SC.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
No new studies were submitted as part of this application. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new studies were submitted as part of this application. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
No new studies were submitted as part of this application.

N/A  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In support of the current extension application for a 1600 mg rituximab SC formulation for use in CLL, the 
Applicant has made reference to the studies already submitted in support of the 1400 mg rituximab SC 
formulation (approved for NHL).  
Overall the nonclinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology of rituximab SC have been well 
characterized. Overall, the available data are considered appropriate to support the proposed Extension 
Application of rituximab SC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 9/65 
 
Lack of any new nonclinical studies supporting the new strength of rituximab for subcutaneous injection 
is accepted. Furthermore, the slightly decreased margins of safety are considered to be of no concern, as 
rituximab is well known from use in the clinical setting, following IV administration.  
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The lack of any new nonclinical studies supporting the new strength of rituximab for subcutaneous 
injection is accepted. Current knowledge of non-clinical aspects is adequate to cover this new strength for 
sc use. No revisions of the PI were made as a result of the assessment of this line extension. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Data from study BO25341 are provided in this application to support the registration of MabThera 1600 
mg  solution  for  subcutaneous  injection  as  an  alternative  to  the  licensed  IV  formulation  in  the  CLL 
indications.  
Study design SAWYER 
Study  BO25341  was  a  two-part,  randomized, open-label,  parallel-group,  multicenter,  Phase  Ib  study. 
Part 1 was designed to investigate several test doses of rituximab SC in order to determine a dose of 
rituximab SC that would yield non-inferior Ctrough compared with the approved 500 mg/m2 IV dose in CLL.  
Part  2 was designed to demonstrate Ctrough non-inferiority of the 1600-mg dose of rituximab SC selected 
in Part 1 versus 500 mg/m2 rituximab IV given in combination with fludarabine and Cyclophosphamide 
(FC) every q4w. 
For Part 1 only, treatment with up to 4 cycles of rituximab IV (375 mg/m2 in Cycle 1 followed by 500 
mg/m2  in  Cycles  2-4)  in  combination  with  fludarabine  +  cyclophosphamide  (FC)  chemotherapy  as 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 10/65 
 
 
first-line therapy for CLL was allowed. For Part 2, eligible patients must not have received any previous 
treatment for CLL. 
Rituximab IV doses were calculated on a body surface area (BSA)-adjusted basis at study entry and the 
calculated  dose  was  not  subsequently  adapted  for  changes  in  body  weight  during  the  course  of  the 
treatment period. Rituximab SC was administered using a fixed dose principle (i.e., the dose was not 
adjusted to BSA, but could be amended based on PK results up to a maximum of 2200 mg). This trial was 
designed as a non-inferiority study to show that serum trough concentrations (Ctrough) of SC rituximab 
are comparable to IV rituximab. There was no expectation of major differences in efficacy between the 
two routes of administration.

Part 2 of study BO25341/SAWYER: Dose Confirmation 
Primary Pharmacokinetic Endpoint: Ctrough at Cycle 5 
Observed  PK  data  from  134 evaluable  patients  (69 patients  given  rituximab IV  and  65 patients  given 
rituximab SC in Cycles 5 and 6) were analysed using NCA. 
The PK results for the primary endpoint, a rituximab SC dose that yields comparable serum Ctrough to 
rituximab IV, demonstrate that 1600 mg of rituximab SC is non-inferior when compared to rituximab IV 
500  mg/m2 at  Cycle  5.  A  summary  of  the  observed  Ctrough  data  at  Cycle  5  is  shown  in  table  2.  The 
geometric mean Ctrough values for the IV and SC formulations are 61.5 µg/mL (CV% 63.9) and 97.5 µg/mL 
(CV% 42.6), respectively.  These values yield a mean Ctrough(SC)/Ctrough(IV) ratio (adjusted by tumour load 
at  baseline)  of  1.53  with  a  90%  CI:  1.27  to  1.85.    The  primary  objective  of  Part  2  of  the  trial, 
non-inferiority  of  Ctrough  for  the  SC  formulation  compared  with  the  IV  formulation  in  CLL,  has  been 
demonstrated, as the lower bounds of the 90% CIs are above the pre-specified non-inferiority boundary 
of 0.8. The variability in the Ctrough data at Cycle 5, as shown by the CV%, were lower for the rituximab SC 
arm at 42.6% compared with 63.9% in the rituximab IV arm.

Secondary Pharmacokinetic Endpoints 
AUC at Cycle 6 
The  secondary  endpoint  in  Part  2  was  the  estimated  ratio  of  observed  rituximab  serum  AUCsc/AUCiv 
during Cycle 6.  
The geometric mean AUCτ values for the IV and SC formulations, respectively, are 3630 µg • day/mL 
(CV%  32.8)  and  4088  µg • day/mL  (CV%  34.6).    These  values  yield  a  mean  AUCτ(SC)/AUCτ(IV)  ratio 
(adjusted by tumour load at baseline) of 1.10 with 90% CI 0.98 to 1.24). Variability in the AUC values was 
low, as expressed by the CV% (32.8% in the rituximab IV arm and 34.6% in the rituximab SC arm), and 
the data are comparable in both treatment arms. 
Cmax, tmax and t1/2 at Cycle 6 
Table 3 shows a summary of the other observed secondary PK parameters, Cmax, t max and t 1/2 data. The 
t max  for  rituximab  IV  occurs  soon  after  the  end  of  infusion  and  for  rituximab  SC  at  around  3  days  as 
expected.  The Cmax is lower for rituximab SC of 202 µg/mL, compared with rituximab IV of 280 µg/mL, as 
the  intravenous  dose  is  injected  directly  into  the  systemic  circulation  while  the  SC  dose  has  to  be 
absorbed and distributed to the circulation from the site of injection via the lymphatic system, resulting in 
slower  delivery  to  systemic  circulation  and  an  overlap  of  the  absorption  and  distribution/elimination 
phases after SC administration.  As expected, the half-life is the same for both routes of administration, 
showing that the terminal elimination is independent of the route of administration and as a consequence 
of comparable exposures in the central compartment.

Subgroup Analyses on Observed PK Data 
In moving from a BSA-adjusted dosing approach to a fixed-dose approach, it is important to ensure that 
patients with high BSA would be adequately exposed and those with low BSA would not be over-exposed 
to rituximab. For the Ctrough at Cycle 5, the geometric mean ratio showed no monotonic change as the BSA 
increased. Similarly for the AUC at Cycle 6, the geometric mean ratio showed no monotonic change with 
respect  to  BSA  in  the  subgroup  analysis.  This  confirms  that  patients  with  a  high  BSA  are  not  being 
underexposed. There was no effect of gender on exposure determined by Ctrough at Cycle 5 and AUC at 
Cycle 6. There appears to be a trend of increasing GMR with tumour load at baseline for both Ctrough and 
AUC. Results from these analyses are summarized in table 4.

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacodynamic Analysis 
Peripheral blood CD19+ lymphocyte counts (B cells) were summarized for the safety analysis population 
(SAP)  
B-cell Depletion and Repletion 
Pharmacodynamic markers from blood samples included peripheral blood CD19 +  B cell counts measured 
pre-dose before each administration of study drug and during follow-up. In this study, B-cell depletion 
was defined as < 80 cells/mm3. 
Part 1 
In  Part  1,  baseline  B-cell  counts  before  treatment  were  not  available  as  patients  had  already  begun 
treatment with rituximab IV. 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 13/65 
 
 
At pre-dose Cycle 5, a  high proportion (94%) of patients were already B-cell depleted and  > 90% of 
patients remained so until the 6-month follow-up visit. Patients’ B cells began to replete by the 9-month 
follow-up visit. At this time point, the proportion of patients who were B-cell depleted had dropped to 66% 
and continued to decrease during subsequent visits. At the 12-, 15-, 18-, 21- and 24-month follow-up 
visits, the proportion of B-cell depleted patients was 52% (25/48 patients), 43% (17/40), 36% (15/42), 
32% (13/41) and 21% (9/42), respectively. 
Consistent results were observed for the normal B-cell (CD5 − /CD19 +  B cells) depletion and repletion, 
with median B-cell counts of 0 cell/mm3 observed after the first cycle of treatment through the 6-month 
follow-up visit and a increase observed from the 9-month follow-up visit onwards. 
Part 2 
At baseline, as expected for this patient population, median B-cell counts were high; 69930 cells/mm3 in 
the rituximab IV arm versus 50565 cells/mm3 in the rituximab SC arm (Table 5).  Following the first cycle 
of treatment, patients began to deplete, with 28% of patients being B-cell depleted at pre-dose Cycle 2. 
A continuous increase in the proportion of B-cell depleted patients was observed with subsequent cycles 
of treatment and by Cycle 6, 96% of patients were B-cell depleted in the two treatment arms. Patients 
remained B-cell depleted until the 9-month follow-up visit, when signs of repletion were seen. At this time 
point,  the  proportion  of  patients  who  were  B-cell  depleted  had  dropped  to  66%  as  for  Part  1.  At  the 
12-month follow-up visit, the proportion of B-cell depleted patients was 41% (16/39 patients).  However, 
at later time points the number of patients was too low to provide meaningful data. The pattern of B-cell 
depletion was similar in the two treatment arms.

2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Rituximab SC 1400 mg was approved on March 21, 2014 as an alternative to rituximab IV for induction 
and maintenance treatment of patients with NHL. The dose and dosing interval of rituximab IV is different 
for NHL (375 mg/m2) and CLL indications (375 mg/m2 at Cycle 1 followed by 500 mg/m2 at Cycles 2 − 
6), therefore, a specific PK study investigating the CLL doses was conducted.   
Rituximab exerts its anti-B-cell activity upon binding to its target (CD20), after systemic distribution via 
the blood. In view of the identical active ingredient in both formulations, the clinical development program 
for rituximab SC is based on the assumption that serum rituximab levels after SC administration at least 
as high as after IV infusion would result in at least the same degree of target-site saturation and would 
hence result in at least the same degree of efficacy, regardless of the route of administration or first-line 
or  relapsed/refractory  settings.  Therefore,  the  clinical  development  program  for  the  rituximab  SC 
formulation was based on pharmacokinetic (PK)-bridging to the corresponding established rituximab IV 
doses and dosing intervals for NHL and CLL indications, demonstrating PK non-inferiority of the rituximab 
SC formulation. The dose and dosing interval of rituximab IV is different for NHL and CLL indications, 
therefore, separate PK-bridging studies for rituximab SC were conducted for NHL and CLL. 
This has been established in the development of rituximab SC 1400 mg, developed as an alternative to 
rituximab IV for induction and maintenance treatment of patients with NHL based on the results from 
studies BP22333/SparkThera and BO22334/SABRINA. In addition, data on safety, immunogenicity, and 
pharmacodynamics (B-cell depletion) collected from these studies showed comparability of the safety 
profile for both rituximab formulations. 
In CLL, the PK-bridging study BO25341 was designed as a non-inferiority study in order to ensure that all 
patients  would  have  a  non-inferior  Ctrough  rituximab  exposure  when  treated  with  a  fixed  dose  of 
rituximab SC as compared with the established rituximab IV regimen (375 mg/m2 at Cycle 1 followed by 
500 mg/m2 at Cycles 2 − 6). 
The  clinical  development  program  for  rituximab  1600  mg  SC  is  based  on  the  assumption  that  serum 
rituximab levels after SC administration at least as high as after IV infusion will result in at least the same 
degree of target-site saturation and will result in at least the same degree of efficacy, regardless of the 
route  of  administration.  Therefore,  the  clinical  development  program  supporting  the  current  line 
extension is based on a PK-based bridging study to the corresponding established rituximab IV doses and 
dosing  intervals  and  intended  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  of  the  rituximab  SC  formulation.  This  is 
considered acceptable.  
To limit the risk of underexposing patients to rituximab when administered SC, a non-inferior margin (of 
0.8) was applied only to the lower limit of the two sided 90% CI of the GMR of Ctrough(SC)/Ctrough(IV). 
As  was  agreed  for  the  SC  application  for  NHL,  the  use  of  non-inferiority  margins  rather  than 
bioequivalence margins is considered acceptable given the wide therapeutic window of rituximab. The risk 
of  adverse  effects  possibly  caused  by  overexposure  to  rituximab  and  was  further  substantiated  by 
subgroup analysis for  BSA and gender and based on experience regarding safety of rituximab gained 
previously in the development program.  
A two-step approach was followed to select and confirm a rituximab SC dose that achieves non-inferior 
serum Ctrough to rituximab IV 500 mg/m2: first, the fixed dose (1870mg) predicted from the phase Ib 
study BP22333 in follicular lymphoma was tested in Part 1 of study BO25341. Then, it was adjusted as 
necessary (by adding patient sub cohorts) to allow for the selection of a fixed SC dose that would yield 
comparable drug exposure to that achieved with the established rituximab IV dose for CLL (500 mg/m2). 
Subsequently, non-inferiority in terms of Ctrough with the selected dose of rituximab SC compared with 
rituximab IV was evaluated in Part 2 of study BO25341. 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 16/65 
 
The initial fixed dose used in Part 1 of the SAWYER study was predicted based on dose-finding studies 
performed in the SparkThera study, submitted as part of the approval of the sc formulation in the NHL 
indication.  This  extrapolation  is  considered  reasonable  as  SC  absorption  is  not  expected  to  differ 
significantly between NHL and CLL patients. 
However, based on preliminary population PK analyses of the first 10 patients dosed at 1870 mg, two 
further sub-cohorts were enrolled sequentially and dosed at 1400 mg and 1600 mg, respectively. Model 
based simulations predicting serum Ctrough and AUC showed that 1600 mg was to be used in Part 2 of the 
SAWYER study.  
In Part 2 of the SAWYER study the established fixed dose of 1600 mg rituximab SC was compared to 500 
mg/m2 rituximab IV. This was assessed by a non-inferiority test with a lower boundary of at least 0.8 for 
the  90%  CI  with  Ctrough  pre-dose  Cycle  6  as  the  primary  PK  endpoint  and  AUC  at  Cycle  6  as  the 
secondary PK endpoint. This is considered appropriate. 
The fixed dose of 1600 mg rituximab was chosen as this was predicted to yield a non-inferior Ctrough for 
rituximab SC over rituximab IV 500 mg/m2 given as a q4w regimen. In Part 2 of the SAWYER study, 
non-inferiority of the rituximab SC administration compared to the rituximab IV administration for the 
primary PK endpoint Ctrough was demonstrated and the variability in the Ctrough data at Cycle 5 were 
lower for the rituximab SC treatment group. 
For the secondary PK endpoint of AUC, the AUC(sc)/AUC(iv) was 1.10 with 90% CI 0.98-1.24 and a low 
variability in both the SC and the IV arms. This is endorsed. 
The tmax differed as expected between the SC and the IV dosing regimens and the tmax(sc)/tmax(iv) 
ratio was found to be 14.9. The Cmax(sc)/Cmax(iv) ratio was found to be 0.719. However, based on the 
rituximab MoA this difference is considered of less importance. Subgroup analyses of Ctrough at Cycle 5, 
the GMR showed no monotonic change as the BSA increased. Similarly for the AUC at Cycle 6, the GMR 
showed no monotonic change with respect to BSA in the subgroup analysis. This confirms that patients 
with a high BSA are not being underexposed. There was no effect of gender on exposure determined by 
Ctrough at Cycle 5 or AUC at Cycle 6. There appears to be a trend of increasing GMR with tumour load at 
baseline for both Ctrough and AUC.  
The  main  objective  of  the  SAWYER  study  was  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority  of  Ctrough  of  rituximab 
administered SC as compared to IV. 
To support rituximab 1600 mg SC as alternative for rituximab 500 mg/m2 in CLL, non-inferiority for the 
primary PK endpoint Ctrough of rituximab after cycle 5 was demonstrated comparing the rituximab 1600 
mg SC administration to the rituximab IV 500 mg/m2 administration.  
The main concern when changing from dosing based on BSA to a fixed dose is that this would result in 
higher  exposure  in  patients  with  lower  BSA  (and  thereby  possibly  a  systematic  overexposure  of  fx. 
Females) and a lower exposure in patients with higher BSA. However, fixed dosing proved possible as the 
higher exposure in females was not related to an increased frequency of AEs and efficacy of rituximab 
remained unchanged in patients with higher BSA indicating sufficient rituximab exposure. 
The total number of quantifiable plasma samples from the REACH and the SAWYER studies are considered 
sufficient to provide robust PK data.  
The  PK  parameter  estimates  were  in  good  agreement  with  the  results  of  the  earlier  population  PK 
analyses.  In  addition,  the  MAH  argues  that  time-dependent  clearance,  inter-compartment  clearance, 
central  compartment  volume,  peripheral  compartment  volume,  absorption  rate  constant  and 
bioavailability  were  in  the  range  typical  for  monoclonal  antibodies.  The  PK  results  included  in  this 
submission are considered sufficient. 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 17/65 
 
Study  BO25341  was  also  designed  to  provide  additional  data  on  safety,  immunogenicity  and 
pharmacodynamics to enable a comparison of the safety profile of both rituximab formulations and assess 
whether  a  change  in  the  route  of  administration  is  associated  with  new  and  clinically  relevant  safety 
findings. Further, exploratory efficacy endpoints (response rates and minimal residual disease [MRD]) 
were  assessed  as  additional  evidence  to  support  the  conclusion  based  on  study  BO22334  that  the 
subcutaneous route of administration does not impair the anti-B-cell activity of rituximab. 
There  was  no  difference  in  B-cell  depletion  apparent  between  rituximab  SC  and  rituximab  IV.  Eight 
patients  had  transient  antibody  (HACA)  expression  against  rituximab  (data  presented  under  Clinical 
safety). Presence of anti-rituximab HACAs seemed to result in lower rituximab exposure, however, no 
diminished effect on B-cell depletion was observed when positive HACAs were present.  
As expected, B-cell depletion was observed. The pattern of B-cell depletion was similar in the SC and the 
IV treatment arms.  
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  pharmacokinetic  data  submitted  are  considered  sufficient  to  support  the  1600  mg  strength  as 
administration  in  the  treatment  of  adult  patients  with  previously  untreated  and  relapsed/refractory 
chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia  -  in  combination  with  chemotherapy.  B-cell  repletion  was  observed  as 
anticipated.

Methods 
Part 1 (Pilot Dose Selection) 
An overview of Part 1 of the BO25341 study design is shown in Figure 1.  It was planned to enroll 10 
previously untreated CLL patients into Cohort A.  Following preliminary analysis of rituximab PK data from 
these first 10 patients, approximately 20 additional patients could be enrolled.  Dependent on further 
analysis,  and  considering  the  theoretical  possibility  of  observing  increased  variability  in  rituximab  PK 
parameters due to patients receiving either oral or IV FC, a further 30 patients could be enrolled i.e., 
Cohort A could include up to approximately 60 patients.  Patients were all enrolled to Cohort A; initially to 
the 1870 mg sub-cohort and then sequentially additional sub-cohorts depending on the PK results. 
Data from all patients enrolled after the initial 10 patients were analyzed on an ongoing basis.  Patients 
were  all  enrolled  to  Cohort A;  initially  to  the  1870 mg  sub-cohort  and  then  sequentially  additional 
sub-cohorts depending on the PK results. 
Patients could be enrolled at any point during their treatment with rituximab IV in combination with FC, 
prior to the commencement of treatment Cycle 5 and should have completed previous treatment without 
experiencing Grade 3 or 4 infusion-related reactions to rituximab (Figure 1).  In Cycle 5 (and previous 
cycles), patients received rituximab IV and subsequently in Cycle 6, rituximab IV was replaced by a single

Part 2 (Ctrough Non-Inferiority) 
An overview of Part 2 of the BO25341 study design is shown in Figure 2.  Approximately 170 patients with 
previously  untreated  CLL  were  planned  to  be  randomized  1:1  either  to  Cohort  B  (rituximab  IV)  or  to 
Cohort C (rituximab SC).  Patients received rituximab IV in the first treatment cycle. 
Cohort B: Patients received chemotherapy (FC) in combination with rituximab IV at a dose of 375 mg/m2 
in Cycle 1, and then FC in combination with rituximab IV 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of each subsequent cycle 
(Cycles 2-6). 
Cohort C: Patients received chemotherapy (FC) in combination with rituximab IV at a dose of 375 mg/m2 
in Cycle 1, and then FC in combination with rituximab SC at the dose selected in Part 1 in all subsequent 
cycles (Cycles 2-6).  
Rituximab pharmacokinetics was assessed throughout the study.

Post-Treatment Follow-Up 
The follow-up period comprised both regular follow-up and survival follow-up.  
Regular follow-up period 
All patients who completed study treatment without disease progression were followed up monthly for the 
first 3 months after their last dose of trial treatment and then every 3 months until 3 years, and every 6 
months until 4 years after their last dose of trial treatment.  In Part 2, responding patients who withdrew 
from treatment due to an AE after interim staging (to be performed before treatment Cycle 4) and did not 
receive further anti-leukemia treatment entered regular follow up. 
Assessment report

Survival follow-up period 
Patients who entered survival follow up directly after premature treatment withdrawal and patients 
withdrawn from regular follow up due to reasons other than death, withdrew consent or lost to follow up 
were followed for disease progression, new anti-leukemia treatment and survival for a maximum 4 years 
from the last dose of the study medication.

Treatments 
Rituximab IV 
Rituximab IV was administered at 500 mg/m2 (375 mg/m2 in Cycle 1).  This dose was calculated based on 
baseline body surface area (BSA) values and not subsequently adapted for changes in body weight during 
the course of the treatment period. 
Part 1 (Cohort A, Cycle 5) 
Cohort A patients received rituximab IV at 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of Cycle 5.  If enrolled at an earlier cycle, 
patients received rituximab IV at 375 mg/m2 in Cycle 1 (on Day 0 or Day 1 according to local practice) 
and 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2-5. 
Part 2 (Cohort B and C) 
Cohort B and C patients received rituximab IV at 375 mg/m2 on Day 0 of Cycle 1.  Cohort B patients 
further received rituximab IV at 500 mg/m2 on Day 1 of Cycles 2-6. 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 21/65 
 
Rituximab SC 
Rituximab SC was administered at a fixed dose of  ≤ 2200 mg with no dose adaptations made for BSA. 
Part 1 (Cohort A, Cycle 6) 
Cohort A patients received rituximab SC at a fixed dose of 1870 mg (the initial starting dose predicted 
from the NHL study BP22333) on Day 1 of Cycle 6.  This dose could be amended depending on PK results 
obtained during the conduct of Part 1 but was not to exceed 2200 mg. 
Part 2 (Cohort C) 
After receiving rituximab IV 375 mg/m2 in Cycle 1, Cohort C patients received on Day 1 of Cycles 2−6 
rituximab SC at a fixed dose, selected based on data from Part 1. 
The  SC  injection  should  be  manually  pushed  at  a  flow  rate  of  approximately  2 mL/min,  therefore  an 
administration volume of 15.6 mL (corresponding to the 1870 mg dose) should take approximately 7 to 
8 minutes. 
Fludarabine and Cyclosphosphamide 
Fludarabine and cyclophosphamide could be administered immediately one after the other.  Prior to the 
start of Part 2, the decision to administer FC chemotherapy IV or orally was made on a per center basis 
and each center was to use a single route of FC administration for all patients throughout Part 2 of the 
study.  
Fludarabine was administered either as an IV infusion at 25 mg/m2 on Days 1−3 of all cycles or given 
orally (p.o.) as part of an approved dosing regimen as follows: 
24 mg/m2 p.o. on Days 1–5 of all cycles  
30–40 mg/m2 p.o. on Days 1–3 of all cycles. 
Cyclophosphamide was administered as an IV infusion at 250 mg/m² on Days 1−3 of all cycles or given 
p.o. as part of an approved dosing regimen as follows: 
150 mg/m2 p.o. on Days 1−5 of all cycles  
200–250 mg/m2 p.o. on Days 1−3 of all cycles. 
A center could only administer oral fludarabine or cyclophosphamide at a different dosage from those 
outlined above following discussion and agreement with the Roche Clinical Scientist.  This did not include 
dose reductions or dose delays due to toxicity. 
Rituximab (both IV and SC) was administered prior to FC with full emergency resuscitation facilities 
immediately available and patients were closely supervised by the investigator at all times.

Part 2 (Ctrough non-inferiority) 
Primary objective:  
• 
To  demonstrate  non-inferiority  in  observed  Ctrough  levels  between  the  confirmed  rituximab  SC 
dose and the reference rituximab IV dose. 
Secondary objectives, in addition to those listed below in Section 0: 
• 
• 
To evaluate safety parameters with rituximab SC vs rituximab IV  
To assess site experience, specifically: 
o  physician / nurse opinions on time savings with rituximab SC vs rituximab IV 
o  physician / nurse opinions on the convenience of rituximab SC vs rituximab IV 
Exploratory objectives, in addition to those listed below in Section 0: 
•  Assessment of minimal residual disease (MRD) with rituximab SC vs rituximab IV 
Parts 1 and 2 
Secondary objectives for both Parts 1 and 2: 
• 
• 
• 
To assess additional PK parameters (including AUC) of both rituximab SC and IV 
To compare the immunogenicity of rituximab SC with that of rituximab IV 
To examine peripheral blood B-cell levels and B-cell depletion and repletion with rituximab SC vs 
rituximab IV 
Exploratory objectives for both Parts 1 and 2:  
•  Response  rate  [complete  response  (CR),  complete  response  with  incomplete  bone  marrow 
recovery (CRi), partial response (PR)] 
• 
• 
Progression-free survival (PFS) 
Event free survival (EFS) 
•  Overall survival (OS) 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint in Part 1 and Part 2 was the Ctrough level of rituximab after either rituximab IV or 
rituximab SC administration.  Secondary endpoints included AUC, Cmax, and tmax of rituximab. (See 
Clinical Pharmacology section). 
Exploratory efficacy endpoints were response rates, Time-to-event endpoints (PFS, EFS and OS) and 
minimal residual disease (MRD). 
Sample size 
A maximum of approximately 60 patients were planned for Part 1 and approximately 170 patients for Part 
2. In Part 2, the sample size was based primarily on C trough levels of rituximab.  A standard non-inferiority 
margin of 0.8 for the geometric mean ratio (GMR) of CtroughSC/CtroughIV was used based on a coefficient 
of variation of 63%.  With these assumptions, a sample size of 68 patients in each treatment group was 
required to achieve 80% power with a one-sided α value of 0.05, assuming that the true PK of rituximab 
SC was 5% above that for rituximab IV.  Allowing for a 20% dropout rate for not achieving valid PK data, 
a total of 170 patients were needed (85 per treatment arm). 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 23/65 
 
Randomisation 
In Part 1, all patients were enrolled into Cohort A and sequentially assigned to the 3 doses (1870 mg, 
1400 mg and 1600 mg) of rituximab SC depending on the variability of the PK data in the course of the 
conduct of Part 1 of this study. 
In Part 2, patients were randomized via an Interactive Voice Response System (IVRS) between the 
rituximab IV (Cohort B) or rituximab SC (Cohort C) formulation in a 1:1 fashion using permuted block 
randomization method.  Randomization was stratified by route of chemotherapy (oral versus IV) and 
Binet Stage (A, B or C). 
Patients who withdrew prior to treatment start could be replaced.  However, patients who prematurely 
discontinued from the study, for any reason, after receiving at least a single dose of treatment could not 
be replaced. 
Blinding (masking) 
Part 1 of the study was evaluated on an ongoing basis in an open-label fashion. 
For Part 2, the statistician, clinical scientist and clinical pharmacologist were fully blinded to treatment 
allocation.  However, the study was open-label to the physician and patient.  
Statistical methods 
Since efficacy data are considered exploratory, no formal statistical testing was performed. 
All efficacy endpoints were analyzed based on the “All Patients” population for Part 1 and the ITT 
population for Part 2.  The tumor response analysis for Part 2 was also performed on the PPP.  Patients 
were analyzed according to the treatment to which they were assigned (Part 1) or randomized (Part 2). 
Tumor response was assessed by the investigator based on peripheral blood counts, physical 
examination, B-symptoms, CT-scan and bone marrow biopsy results, if applicable.  
In Part 1, the response rates (CR, CRi and PR) at the 3 month follow-up visit are presented descriptively.  
In Part 2, response rates at the 3-month follow-up visit were analyzed in frequency tables including 95% 
Pearson-Clopper confidence intervals (CI) by treatment group.  For the difference in response rates, 95% 
CI (Hauck-Andersen) were calculated. 
For the analysis of tumor response rates, a patient was considered to be a responder if their response was 
either CR, CRi or PR.  Patients whose disease was stable (SD), had progressed (PD) or patients who had 
a missing response assessment were considered to be non-responders. 
Subgroup analyses were performed on response rate at the 3-month follow-up visit based on: 
•  BSA category: 
o  upper and lower 33rd percentiles: low (≤ 1.81 m2), medium (1.81 m2 < BSA ≤ 2.00 m2) 
and high (> 2.00 m2) 
o  upper  and  lower  20th  percentiles  (extreme  low/high  BSA):  low  (≤ 1.72 m2),  medium 
(1.72 m2 < BSA ≤ 2.07 m2) and high (> 2.07 m2) 
• 
gender 
•  Ctrough at cycle 5 (low: Ctrough ≤ 88.75 µg/mL & high: Ctrough > 88.75 µg/mL) 
Time to Event Endpoints 
Time-to-event endpoints (PFS, EFS and OS) are included in the study but were not analyzed by this 
cut-off. 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 24/65 
 
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) 
Analysis on MRD, which was assessed by quantitative PCR or flow cytometry, was performed in Part 2 
only.  The results of flow cytometry were only used where PCR results were unavailable. 
The MRD status was assigned as positive or negative based on a pre-defined cut-off.  MRD negativity was 
defined as a level of < 10-4 (i.e., 1 CLL cell in a background of 10,000 leukocytes).  MRD status is 
summarized in frequency tables including 95% Pearson-Clopper CI by treatment group.  For the 
difference in MRD negative status between treatment arms, 95% CI (Hauck-Andersen) were calculated.

Part 1 - Schematic Representation of Patient Disposition 
**One patient in this sub-cohort received 1000 mg of rituximab SC in error 
Source: pd002_E_001 and pd004_s001 
A total of 8 patients withdrew from part 1 of the study treatment period prior to receipt of their rituximab 
SC dose (Cycle 6).  The most common reason for withdrawal was due to AEs (4 patients).  Two patients 
were withdrawn due to a protocol violation.  One patient was withdrawn due to death (respiratory failure) 
and one patient withdrew consent.  
None of the 56 patients treated with rituximab SC withdrew from any dose sub-cohorts during Cycle 6 (SC 
dose). 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016

During the regular follow-up period, 5 patients were withdrawn from the 1400 mg SC sub-cohort (1 due 
to death, 3 due to disease progression and 1 due to an AE), 2 from the 1600 mg sub-cohort (both due to 
disease progression) and 4 from the 1870 mg SC sub-cohort (2 due to disease progression and 2 due to 
death).  During  the  survival  follow-up  period,  2  patients  withdrew  due  to  death,  1  in  the  1400 mg 
sub-cohort and 1 in the 1870 mg sub-cohort. 
Recruitment 
A total of 64 patients were enrolled in Part 1 from 33 sites in 12 countries (Italy 5 (14 patients -22% of 
study population), Germany 4 (highest recruiting country, enrolling 8 patients -11.9% of the study 
population), Poland 3, France 3, Spain 4, Czech Republic 3, Australia 3, Slovakia 2, Canada 2, Croatia 2, 
Mexico 1, Greece 1).  A total of 176 patients were enrolled in Part 2 from 68 sites in 19 countries 
(Germany 10, Italy 6, Poland 4, Russia 5, Spain 6, Czech Republic 3, Canada 4, Australia 5, Brazil 4, 
France 5, Mexico 2, Argentina 3, Turkey 3, Slovakia 1, Chile 2, Croatia 1, Portugal 1, New Zealand 2, 
Greece 1).   
Baseline data 
In Part 1 population comprised predominantly White (95%) male (73%) with a median age of 60 years 
(range 38 - 77 years) and median BSA of 1.94 m2.  When considering the small patient numbers in each 
dose  sub-cohort,  the  treatment  sub-cohorts  are  considered  comparable  with  respect  to  baseline 
demographic characteristics.  
At baseline, 55% of the patients had Binet Stage B disease, with the median time from diagnosis of CLL 
to  enrolment  being  16.4 months  (range  0.3 - 153.6  months).    The  majority  of  patients  did  not  have 
B-symptoms at screening (83%) or prior to the first line of rituximab-FC treatment (78%). 
The patient population in Part 2 was similar to that in Part 1 and comprised predominantly White (96%) 
male (65%) with a median age of 60 years (range 25-78 years) and median BSA of 1.9 m2).  The study 
arms were well balanced for baseline demographic characteristics except that there were more male in 
the rituximab SC arm (60% IV vs 71% SC). 
At baseline, the majority of patients had Binet Stage B disease (62%, a baseline stratification factor) and 
typical CLL characterization (93%), with the median time from diagnosis of CLL to randomization being 
18.5 months (range 0 - 388.5 months).  Approximately one-third of patients had B-symptoms at 
screening and prior to receiving rituximab IV (375 mg/m2) in Cycle 1.  The study arms were comparable 
with respect to baseline disease characteristics. 
Numbers analysed 
Outcomes and estimation 
Part 1  
Overall Response rate (ORR) 
In Part 1, the investigator assessed ORR at the 3 month follow-up visit was 95% for the overall 
population.  The ORR was similar across the three SC dose sub-cohorts (94%, 94% and 96% for the SC 
1400 mg, 1600 mg and 1870 mg sub-cohorts, respectively).  In the “ITT-like” patient population (53/64 
including patients who did not get an SC administration), the ORR was 83%. 
In this part of the study, patients could be enrolled at any treatment cycle prior to Cycle 5; therefore, for 
some patients the in-study baseline tumor assessment was not a pretreatment baseline tumor 
assessment.  In addition, no CT scan was required at study entry.  These may affect the response 
assessment at the 3-month follow-up visit.  Efficacy in Part 1 was assessed as an explorative endpoint and 
should be interpreted with caution.

Overall Response Rate (ORR) 
In Part 2, the ORR at the 3 month follow-up visit was similar in patients treated with rituximab IV and SC 
(80.7% for IV arm vs 85.2% for SC arm).  The proportion of patients with a complete response (CR/CRi) 
was similar in the rituximab IV (33.0%) and rituximab SC (26.1%) treatment arms (table 6).

EMA/276108/2016 
Page 28/65 
 
 
 
Table 6: Part 2 - Summary of Tumor Response at the 3-Month Follow-Up Visit (ITT 
Population) 
The results for ORR based on the PPP were consistent with those for the ITT population, with rates of 
95.5% and 96.7% for the rituximab IV and SC arms, respectively.  The proportion of patients with a 
complete response (CR/CRi) was also consistent with the results obtained from the ITT population (34.7% 
for the IV arm vs 31.6% for the SC arm). 
Ancillary analyses 
A number of subgroup analyses were performed. 
Subgroup Analyses of Overall Response Rate (ORR) by BSA, Gender and Ctrough 
The ORR at 3 months was analyzed on the ITT population by BSA category, gender and Ctrough. 
Overall, subgroup analyses supported the analysis on the total ITT population and ORR was comparable 
between rituximab IV and rituximab SC in the subgroups explored.  The greatest difference in ORR 
between treatment arms was observed in the medium BSA subgroup, with a 11.0% difference in ORR 
(95% CI: -9.1%;31.1%) in favor of rituximab SC). 
Note; some caution should be applied in interpreting the results given the possibility of bias introduced by 
other  baseline  prognostic  variables  (eg,  comorbidities,  patient’s  history,  environment),  the  risk  of 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 29/65 
 
 
 
false-positive findings resulting from multiple comparisons, and small sample sizes within subgroups (and 
therefore low statistical “power”). 
•  BSA 
Numerical differences were observed in the low, medium and high BSA sub-groups between the IV and 
the SC arms (upper and lower 33rd percentiles).  A 5.7% difference in ORR was observed in the low BSA 
subgroup in favor of rituximab IV; this is in contrast to ORR for the medium and high BSA subgroups, 
where  it  was  higher  (11.0%  and  5.7%)  in  favor  of  the  rituximab  SC  arm.    However,  the  ORR  CIs 
overlapped  for  all  subgroups,  and  there  were  no  apparent  differences  despite  the  variable  point 
estimates. 
A further exploratory analysis of response rates at the extremes of BSA based on the upper and lower 20th 
percentiles  of  BSA  demonstrated  that  response  rates  were,  in  general,  consistent  with  the  above 
analyses.  However, these analyses are again limited by the small sample size in the upper and lower 20th 
percentiles. 
•  Gender 
Although numerical differences between both arms in each gender and between gender in each arm were 
observed, there were no apparent differences when taking into consideration the small patient numbers 
and slight imbalance between the arms with respect to gender. 
•  Ctrough 
With  respect  to  Ctrough  at  Cycle  5,  the  ORR  was  numerically  higher  in  the  low  Ctrough  subgroup  (5.1% 
difference [95% CI: -8.9%;19.2%]), in favor of the SC arm.  Despite the numerical differences, in view 
of the small sample sizes, the ORR was considered to be comparable between low and high Ctrough at Cycle 
5 in both arms.

Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) 
At  the  3-month  follow-up  visit,  the  proportion  of  evaluable  patients  that  were  MRD  negative  was 
comparable between the IV and  SC arms (66.1% IV vs 53.1% SC).  It should  be noted that the MRD 
results at 3 months are all based on PCR except for one patient in the rituximab IV arm for whom no PCR

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
BO25341 is a two-part randomized, open-label, parallel-group, multicenter, Phase Ib study in patients 
with previously untreated CLL.  In Part 1 patients were eligible at any time prior to Cycle 5 of their 
first-line therapy with rituximab IV (375 mg/m2 in Cycle 1 followed by 500 mg/m2 in Cycles 2 − 4) in 
combination with FC chemotherapy.  
The efficacy data presented is based on a clinical cut-off date of 12 February 2014 and a snapshot date of 
7 May 2014. Efficacy parameters presented includes response rates and MRD assessment at 3 months of 
follow up. Time-to-event endpoints (PFS, EFS and OS) were not included yet as these data are not 
mature. 
The SAWYER study was designed as a PK-based bridging study with Ctrough being the primary endpoint. 
Efficacy endpoints were explorative as the SABRINA study had already previously evaluated the potential 
impact of the SC route of administration of rituximab and found it comparable to the IV route of 
administration. The design of the SAWYER study including inclusion and exclusion criteria, 
primary/secondary/exploratory endpoints, power calculations, randomisation, blinding and statistical 
methods are considered overall appropriate.   
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The dose of 1600 mg was selected for the part 2 of the study. 
Response rates were similar in each arm, with an overall response rate of 80.7% (95% CI: 70.9; 88.3) 
and 85.2% (95% CI: 76.1; 91.9) in the MabThera intravenous and subcutaneous arms, respectively. 
Complete response rate point estimates were 33.0% (95% CI: 23.3; 43.8) and 26.1% (95% CI: 17.3; 
36.6) in the MabThera intravenous and subcutaneous arms, respectively.  Overall the results confirm that 
MabThera subcutaneous formulation 1600 mg has a comparable benefit/risk profile to that of MabThera 
intravenous formulation 500 mg/m2. The results on efficacy exploratory endpoints -albeit that the study 
was not powered to compare the efficacy of IV and SC rituximab-  do not give rise to concern regarding 
the efficacy of SC rituximab. Time-to-event endpoints (PFS, EFS and OS) included in the study but were 
not analyzed by this cut-off. 
Pharmacoeconomic parameters (resource savings and convenience) were also included as secondary 
parameters in study BO25341 to assess site experience on time savings and convenience of rituximab SC 
compared with rituximab IV. Such data are not part of the scope of the present assessment.   
The recommended dose of MabThera subcutaneous formulation used for adult patients with CLL is a 
subcutaneous injection at a fixed dose of 1600mg irrespective of the patient’s body surface area.  
As it will be discussed under Clinical safety, in patients who had transient antibody (HACA) expression 
against rituximab and although presence of anti-rituximab HACAs seemed to result in lower rituximab 
exposure, no diminished effect on B-cell depletion was observed when positive HACAs were present. 
B-cell depletion is considered a measure of rituximab activity and thus may provide an indicator of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 32/65 
 
potential neutralizing effect of anti-rituximab antibodies, therefore, there was no apparent impact of the 
presence of anti-rituximab antibodies on B-cell depletion. 
The requirement for the final CSR of study SAWYER was already included in Annex II. Data from other 
ongoing studies as per the PhV will contribute to the long term efficacy and safety information with the sc 
rituximab. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
As it has been previously established that the subcutaneous route of administration has no impact on 
efficacy, the PK-based bridging study supported by exploratory response rate endpoints was considered 
sufficient to support the new strength of 1600 mg of rituximab  SC for the treatment of patients with 
previously  untreated  and  relapsed/refractory  chronic  lymphocytic  leukaemia  in  combination  with 
chemotherapy. Time-to-event endpoints (PFS, EFS and OS) were not analysed as not yet mature.   
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address issues related to efficacy:

Final CSR of study SAWYER will be submitted by Q4 2018. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
All patients who received at least one dose of study medication, whether prematurely withdrawn from the 
study or not, were included in the safety analysis population.  Patients were analysed according to the 
actual treatment received. 
Patient exposure 
Part 1 
The safety analysis population included all 64 patients enrolled into Part 1.  Of these, 8 patients did not 
receive any rituximab SC dose and are therefore summarized separately.  One further patient  assigned 
to the rituximab 1870 mg SC sub-cohort received rituximab SC 1000 mg during Cycle 6 in error; safety 
information is presented separately for this patient.  The treatment sub-cohorts included the following 
number of patients: 
16 patients rituximab SC 1400 mg  
17 patients rituximab SC 1600 mg 
22 patients rituximab SC 1870 mg  
1 patient rituximab SC 1000 mg 
8 patients no rituximab SC dose administered 
Part 2 
Of the 176 patients (88 in each arm) enrolled into Part 2 of the study, two patients (one in each arm) were 
excluded from the safety analysis population because they withdrew from the study prior to receiving any 
treatment.  Two additional patients in the SC arm, who only received the first dose of study treatment 
(rituximab IV), were included in the rituximab IV arm for the safety analyses. Hence, the safety analysis 
population comprised 89 patients in the IV arm and 85 patients in the SC arm.   
Exposure to rituximab - Part I of the study 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 33/65 
 
All patients in the three rituximab SC treatment sub-cohorts received treatment with rituximab IV 500 
mg/m2 during cycle 5 During Cycle 6, 16 patients received rituximab 1400 mg SC, 17 patients received 
rituximab 1600 mg SC and 22 patients received rituximab 1870 mg SC.  One patient received rituximab 
1000 mg SC in error during Cycle 6.  The median treatment duration in Cycles 5 and 6 was 29 days in all 
three sub-cohorts. 
Exposure to chemotherapy was comparable across the sub-cohorts.  In the overall safety population, the 
median cumulative dose of cyclophosphamide (oral and IV) administered in Cycles 5 and 6 was 2445 mg 
and the median duration of treatment was 31 days (range: 3-58 days).  For fludarabine (oral and IV), the 
figures were 264 mg and 31 days (range: 3-58 days), respectively. 
Exposure to rituximab - Part 2 of the study 
Apart from the 2 patients who withdrew prior to study drug treatment, all 174 patients received the first 
dose of rituximab IV (375 mg/m2) in Cycle 1.  A comparable proportion of patients in both arms (81% IV 
vs 86% SC) received all six scheduled cycles of study treatment.  Overall, the median treatment duration 
was 4.7 months.  The higher median cumulative dose of rituximab in the SC arm (8720 mg) compared to 
the IV arm (5232 mg) is due to the fixed dosing regimen for SC administration. 
The median duration of rituximab SC administration was 7.0 minutes, with the majority of SC injections 
(89%; 330/369 injections) being given in less than 9 minutes.  Very few injections (2%; 9/369) took 
longer than 11 minutes to administer.  
Of  note,  one  patient  is  reported  to  have  had  an  administration  time  of  66 minutes;  for  this  patient, 
administration was stopped and re-started. 
Exposure to chemotherapy 
Exposure to chemotherapy was comparable between the rituximab IV and SC arms.  In the overall Part 2 
safety population, the median number of cycles for both fludarabine and cyclophosphamide was six and 
the median cumulative doses (oral and IV) were 840 mg and 7508 mg, respectively 
The justification for which patients to include and exclude from the population on which patient exposure 
data were derived in both parts of the SAWYER study is endorsed. The MAH argues that the FC exposure 
was comparable between cohorts. This is endorsed.  
Adverse events 
Part 1 
In Part 1, patients could be enrolled at any point during their treatment with rituximab IV in combination 
with  FC,  prior  to  commencement  of  treatment  in  Cycle  5.    In  Cycle  5  (and  previous  cycles),  patients 
received rituximab IV and subsequently in Cycle 6, rituximab IV was replaced by a single rituximab SC 
dose (the first sub-cohort received 1870 mg rituximab SC and thereafter two sub-cohorts, with 1400 mg 
and 1600 mg rituximab SC doses, were sequentially opened).   
The presentation of safety information in this document is restricted to data collected in Cycle 6 since it is 
the only period during which rituximab SC was administered, and hence the only cycle which provides 
supportive safety information for rituximab SC.  An overview of safety data collected in Cycle 5 (rituximab 
IV) has been provided for comparison. 
The  overall  safety  experience  in  the  pooled  rituximab  SC  sub-cohorts  during  Cycle  6  was  generally 
consistent with that in Cycle 5 where rituximab IV was given.  There were no new safety signals identified 
for rituximab SC in Part 1 of Study BO25341.  When considering the limited number of patients in Part 1, 
the incidence of safety events are considered comparable during Cycles 5 and 6.  The most commonly 
reported AEs in Cycle 5 were neutropenia (1400 mg sub-cohort: 38%; 1600 mg sub-cohort: 18%; 1870 
mg sub-cohort: 23%) and leukopenia (1400 mg sub-cohort: 6%; 1600 mg sub-cohort: 24%; 1870 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 34/65 
 
sub-cohort:  0%)  and  in  Cycle  6  were  neutropenia  (1400  mg  sub-cohort:  19%;  1600  mg  sub-cohort: 
12%;  1870  mg  sub-cohort:  27%)  and  injection  site  erythema  (1400  mg  sub-cohort:  0%;  1600  mg 
sub-cohort: 12%; 1870 mg sub-cohort: 18%) and injection site pain (1400 mg sub-cohort: 0%; 1600 mg 
sub-cohort: 18%; 1870 mg sub-cohort: 14%).  Between the SC dose sub-cohorts (Cycle 6), a numerically 
higher incidence of all grade AEs was seen with increasing dose; the imbalance was already observed 
during  Cycle  5.    However,  the  incidence  of  Grade  ≥  3  AEs  and  SAEs  was  low  and  similar  in  all  three 
rituximab SC sub-cohorts.  Given the small sample size, the numerical differences observed between the 
SC dose sub-cohorts should be interpreted with caution. 
Part 2 
The overall safety profile of rituximab SC was comparable to that of rituximab IV and consistent with the 
expected safety profile of rituximab IV in a similar CLL population.  There were no new safety signals 
identified for rituximab SC.   
The incidence of safety events was similar between the treatment arms with the exception of a higher 
frequency of related AEs in the SC arm (58% IV vs 79% SC) mainly due to local cutaneous reactions.  The 
most commonly reported AEs were neutropenia (58% IV vs 65% SC), thrombocytopenia (26% IV vs 24% 
SC), pyrexia (25% IV vs 32% SC), nausea (35% IV vs 38% SC) and vomiting (22% IV vs 21% SC). 
Common adverse events 
Part 1, Cycle 6 
The majority of patients (66% [37/56]) experienced at least one AE during Cycle 6.  The most commonly 
reported AEs by preferred term were neutropenia (21%), injection site erythema (11%), injection site 
pain  (11%),  vomiting  (7%)  and  diarrhea  (7%).    All  other  AEs  were  reported  in  <= 5%  of  the  study 
population.   
Across the three SC dose sub-cohorts, numerical differences were seen in the incidence of all-grade AEs; 
44% (7/16), 59% (10/17) and 86% (19/22) for the 1400 mg, 1600 mg and 1870 mg arms, respectively, 
however this should be considered in light of the small number of patients in each sub-cohort.  Of note, 
a  similar  imbalance  between  the  SC  dose  sub-cohorts  was  already  observed  in  Cycle  5.    The  higher 
incidence of all-grade AEs in the 1600 mg and 1870 mg dose sub-cohorts was mainly driven by local 
cutaneous reactions (injection site erythema/pain) as well as gastrointestinal disorders (eg, diarrhea and 
vomiting).   
Part 2 
In Part 2, the proportion of patients reporting at least one AE of any grade was comparable between the 
study arms (91% IV vs 96% SC).  It should be noted that data from Cycle 1 (when all patients, including 
those in the rituximab SC arm received rituximab IV [375 mg/m2]) are included in the analysis.   
The most common (>50% in at least one study arm) SOCs in which AEs were reported were:  
Blood and lymphatic disorders:  70% IV vs 75% SC, most commonly neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, 
anemia and leukopenia.  
General  disorders  and  administration  site  conditions:    48%  IV  vs  71%  SC,  most  commonly  pyrexia, 
asthenia, chills, fatigue and injection site erythema/pain. 
Gastrointestinal disorders:  56% in each arm, most commonly nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. 
Infections and infestations: 49% IV vs 56% SC most commonly upper respiratory tract infections. 
AEs with a difference of >10% between treatment arms included injection site erythema (0% IV vs 26% 
SC) and injection site pain (0% IV vs 16% SC).   
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 35/65 
 
In addition, there was an overall higher incidence of AEs with SC compared to IV rituximab in the SOC of 
skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders (30% IV vs 44% SC; mainly due to erythema and pruritus) and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (22% IV vs 32% SC; mainly due to arthralgia and pain 
in  the  extremity).    Conversely,  a  higher  incidence  of  vascular  disorders  (21%  IV  vs  11%  SC;  mainly 
hypotension and hypertension) and the AE preferred term anemia (24% IV vs 13% SC) was reported in 
the rituximab IV arm. 
There  were  no  other  noteworthy  differences  between  the  study  arms  with  respect  to  the  type  and 
frequency of other all-grade AEs. 
The MAH argues that the overall safety experience in the pooled rituximab SC sub-cohorts during Cycle 6 
of Part 1 of the SAWYER  study was generally consistent with that in  Cycle 5  where rituximab  IV was 
administered. This is endorsed. 
Differences in frequency of AEs during Part 2 in the SOC of skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders and 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders were more prominent in the SC cohort as were injection 
site  erythema  and  injection  site  pain.  On  the  contrary,  a  higher  incidence  of  vascular  disorders  and 
anaemia was reported in the rituximab IV arm. The AEs on which differences were observed between 
groups were generally of low Grade severity. 
The MAH argues that the overall safety profile of rituximab SC was comparable to that of rituximab IV and 
consistent with the expected safety profile of rituximab IV in a similar CLL population. This is endorsed.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
SAEs 
Part 1, Cycle 6 
During Cycle 6 of Part 1, two patients in the rituximab SC 1600 mg sub-cohort experienced a SAE.  The 
cases were Grade 3 diarrhea and Grade 3 cholecystitis both of which were considered by the investigator 
as unrelated to rituximab.  There were no SAEs reported in the other sub-cohorts during Cycle 6. 
Part 2 
The overall frequency of SAEs was comparable between the study arms (33% IV vs 29% SC). The most 
common  SAEs  were  reported  in  the  SOC  of  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders  (mainly  febrile 
neutropenia and neutropenia) and infections and infestations (various events).  There was no noteworthy 
difference between the arms with respect to the frequency and type of SAEs, with the exception of febrile 
neutropenia which was more common in the rituximab SC arm (4% IV vs 11% SC) and neutropenia which 
was more common in the IV arm (9% IV vs 1% SC). 
The incidence of SAEs during Cycle 1 (when all patients received rituximab IV) was comparable in both 
treatment arms (8% IV vs 6% SC).  The incidence of SAEs during Cycles 2-6 was similar (17% IV vs 18% 
SC) and the incidence did not change notably over the course of treatment. 
The  MAH  argues  that  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  comparable  between  treatment  arms  and  that  the 
incidence did not change notably over the course of the treatment. This is endorsed. 
Deaths 
Part 1 
At the study snapshot date of May 7, 2014, six patients enrolled in Part 1 of the study had died, however, 
no deaths occurred during treatment Cycle 6.  Two patients died due to disease progression and four died 
due to an AE.   
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 36/65 
 
All but one death occurred during the follow-up period.  One patient died during the treatment phase 
(Cycle  4),  before  receiving  rituximab  SC,  due  to  acute  respiratory  failure.    The  cause  of  death  was 
reported after the data snapshot date.  All deaths were considered by the investigator as unrelated to 
rituximab.  One death occurred after data snapshot date.  One patient in the SC 1400 mg sub-cohort died 
from  a  brain  neoplasm,  more  than  2  years  after  the  last  dose  of  study  treatment.    This  death  was 
considered by the investigator as unrelated to rituximab. 
Part 2 
In Part 2, nine deaths had been reported by the snapshot date; 4/89 patients (5%) in the rituximab IV 
arm  and  5/85  patients  (6%)  in  the  rituximab  SC  arm.    The  majority  of  deaths  were  due  to  disease 
progression (2 IV  vs 3 SC).   The most common cause of death unrelated to disease progression was 
infections; listeriosis in the IV arm and herpes zoster and PML in the SC arm.  The two deaths (herpes 
zoster, PML) in the SC arm were considered by the investigator as related to rituximab. 
The deaths were, however, balanced between groups. This is endorsed.  
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
Part 1 
In Part 1 of the study, no meaningful changes from baseline were observed in haematology parameters. 
Part 2  
The observed changes in haematology laboratory parameters are consistent with those expected from 
rituximab in combination with chemotherapy. They included on-treatment decreases in white blood cell, 
neutrophil, lymphocyte counts and platelets which were recovering towards the normal range by the time 
of the data snapshot.  No noteworthy difference was observed between the arms with respect to median 
values  for  these  parameters  over  time.    There  were  no  meaningful  changes  observed  for  other 
hematologic parameters. 
There  was  no  notable  difference  between  the  study  arms  in  the  proportion  of  patients  with  clinically 
relevant  shifts  from  baseline  (from  Grade  0,  1  or  2  at  baseline  to  Grade  3  or  4  post-baseline)  in 
haematology laboratory parameters 
Serum Chemistry 
In both parts of Study BO25341, no consistent trends or patterns were observed with respect to changes 
from baseline in median values in serum chemistry parameters.  Median values generally showed little 
change  over  time  and  remained  within  the  normal  range.    No  noteworthy  differences  were  observed 
between the arms. 
There were no noteworthy clinically relevant shifts from baseline in serum chemistry parameters with the 
exception of high uric acid levels.  The proportion of patients with clinically relevant shifts of uric acid 
levels (from Grade 0 at baseline to Grade 3 or 4 post-baseline) was 20% in the IV arm and 14% in the SC 
arm.  Four patients in the rituximab IV arm and two patients in the rituximab SC arm experienced a shift 
from Grade 0 baseline to Grade 4 post-baseline.   
It should be noted that NCI-CTCAE Grade 1 is defined as values above the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
but ≤ 0.59  mmol/L  without  physiological  consequences  while  Grade  3  is  defined  as   > ULN  but ≤ 0.59 
mmol/L  with  physiological  consequences.    NCI-CTC  grading  does  not  allow  for  Grade  2.    In  Study 
BO25341, NCI-CTCAE grades for uric acid were assigned only on the basis of laboratory values and a 
worst-case analysis was applied in all cases.  Conservatively all values above the ULN but ≤ 0.59 mmol/L 
were set to Grade 3 regardless of clinical consequences.  In this study, none of the patients with this shift 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 37/65 
 
in  uric  acid  levels  experienced  AEs  of  Grade ≥ 3  severity  that  plausibly  could  have  been  a  result  of 
elevated uric acid levels.  Therefore, it appears that uric acid levels up to 0.59 mmol/L would have been 
assigned  to  NCI-CTCAE  Grade 1  rather  than  to  Grade 3  if  the  grading  had  been  assigned  by  the 
investigator.  
There was no consistent change in other biochemical markers that would suggest tumour lysis syndrome 
or uric acid nephropathy (eg, calcium, potassium, creatinine, and albumin). 
Observed  changes  in  haematology  laboratory  parameters  were  consistent  with  those  expected  from 
rituximab in combination with chemotherapy. No notable differences were observed between groups for 
neither  haematology  laboratory  parameters  nor  serum  chemistry  with  the  exception  of  high  uric  acid 
levels which were more prevalent in the IV group. 
No other indications of tumour lysis syndrome or uric acid nephropathy were detected. This is endorsed. 
Safety in special populations 
Data on AEs in subgroups are presented for only Part 2 of Study BO25341. 
•  Age 
The incidence of all-grade AEs in both treatment arms was comparable across the three age categories (< 
65 years, 65 - 70 years and > 70 years). The proportion of patients (>90%) who experienced AEs in the 
three age categories was comparable in the two treatment arms, and there was no trend in the incidence 
of adverse events with age. 
•  Gender  
In both treatment arms, the incidence of all-grade AEs was generally comparable between males and 
females (IV arm: 89% of females’ vs 92% of males; SC arm: 100% of females’ vs 95% of males). In both 
treatment arms, SAEs and Grade  ≥ 3 AEs occurred at a higher incidence in females than males (IV arm: 
42% of females vs 26% of males; SC arm: 36% of females vs 27% of males), with events in the SOC of 
blood and lymphatic system disorders being the main driver for the observed difference.   
There  were  no  other  noteworthy  differences  observed  with  respect  to  the  safety  of  rituximab 
administration (given IV or SC) and gender. 
•  Race 
Since the study population comprised predominantly White patients (90%), no analysis on the type and 
frequency of AEs by race was performed.     
•  Body Surface Area 
All-Grade Adverse Events 
The overall proportion of patients who experienced at least one AE in the IV and SC arms was comparable 
across the three BSA subgroups. In both treatment arms, patients in the low BSA compared with the 
medium and high BSA categories had a higher incidence of events in the blood and lymphatic system SOC 
(85% low vs 73% medium vs 58% high); mainly more AEs of neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.  
Within the low BSA subgroup, the incidence of AEs was generally comparable between the IV and SC arms 
except for injection site erythema which was reported exclusively in the SC arm (5/24 patients; 21%). 
There  were  no  other  noteworthy  differences  observed  between  the  treatment  arms  within  each  BSA 
category. 
Serious Adverse Events

The overall proportion of patients in the IV and SC arms who experienced at least one SAE was generally 
comparable across the three BSA subgroups.  In both arms, patients in the low BSA compared with the 
medium and high BSA categories had a higher incidence of events in the blood and lymphatic system SOC 
(22% vs 10% vs 11%, respectively); the difference was mainly accounted for by an imbalance in febrile 
neutropenia.   
There were no other noteworthy differences in the incidence of SAEs observed between treatment arms 
within each BSA category. 
Grade ≥ 3 Adverse Events 
The overall proportion of patients in the IV and SC arms who experienced at least one Grade ≥ 3 AE was 
higher in the low BSA subgroup compared with the medium and high BSA subgroups.    
In both treatment arms, the difference was mainly accounted for by a higher incidence of events in the 
blood and lymphatic system SOC in the low BSA subgroup (75% vs 58% vs 51%, respectively); mainly 
neutropenia and febrile neutropenia.   
There  were  no  other  noteworthy  differences  in  the  incidence  of  Grade ≥ 3  AEs  observed  between 
treatment arms within each BSA category. 
Adverse Events by BSA Category and Treatment Cycle 
In Cycle 1 and Cycles 2-6, a comparable proportion of patients experienced all-grade AEs and SAEs across 
the three BSA categories in both IV and SC arms.  Both in Cycle 1 and Cycle 2-6, there was a trend for a 
higher incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs in the low BSA subgroup in both IV and SC arms.  There were no other 
noteworthy differences observed.   
Adverse Events by Extremes of BSA  
Exploratory analyses of all-grade AEs, Grade > 3 AEs and SAEs at the extremes of BSA based on the 
upper (> 2.07) and lower 20th (< 1.72) percentiles of BSA demonstrated that the AE profile was generally 
consistent with the analyses based on the 33rd and 66th percentiles although interpretation of the results 
was limited by the small sample size in the  upper (16 IV vs 19 SC)  and lower (18  IV vs 12 SC) 20th 
percentile BSA categories. 
No different safety signals were detected based on age, gender or race. Patients in the low BSA group 
generally experienced a higher incidence of events in the blood and lymphatic system SOC compared with 
patients in the medium and high BSA categories. However, in general the differences between groups is 
considered sufficiently low to support a fixed dose SC rituximab regimen.

Immunological events 
Immunogenicity 
Monoclonal antibodies provide highly effective therapies but may be associated with unwanted effects 
such  as  immunogenicity  (i.e.,  they  induce  an  immune  response  in  patients).  The  assessment  of 
immunogenicity and the factors contributing to it are topics of much ongoing research and discussion. 
It is generally accepted that antibodies formed against therapeutic proteins may be transient with no 
clinical consequence or may have a range of implications on safety and/or efficacy of a drug (Shankar et 
al. 2014). 
The change of route of administration may influence the immunogenic potential of drugs; therefore the 
clinical  program  for  rituximab  SC  includes  a  comprehensive  assessment  of  human  anti-chimeric 
antibodies (HACAs; anti-rituximab antibodies) and human anti-human antibodies (HAHAs; anti-rHuPH20 
antibodies) following administration of rituximab SC versus rituximab IV. 
Part 1 
Anti-Rituximab Antibodies 
Samples  for  the  anti-rituximab  antibody  (HACA)  assay  were  collected  starting  pre-dose  Cycle  5 
(rituximab IV), and at each follow-up visit until 24 months after the last dose of rituximab.  
The incidence of HACA was low; 3 of the 61 patients tested, one in each SC dose, who were negative for 
HACA at pre-dose Cycle 5 had a positive result for HACA post-Cycle 5 (treatment-induced HACA). All 3 
patients  were  responders  at  the  3-month  follow-up  visit.  Given  the  limited  number  of  patients  with 
positive  HACA  results,  no  definitive  conclusion  on  the  incidence  of  HACA  positivity  and  their  clinical 
consequences can be made. 
Anti-rHuPH20 Antibodies 
In Part 1 of the study, patients received one of three fixed doses of rituximab SC (1400 mg, 1600 mg and 
1870  mg)  at  Cycle  6  only,  although  1  patient  received  1000 mg  by  mistake.  Samples  for  the 
anti-rHuPH20 (HAHA) assay were collected prior to the administration of the rituximab SC dose, and at 
each follow-up visit until 9 months after the last dose of rituximab.  
At baseline (pre-SC dose Cycle 6), 5/56 patients (9%) had positive results for HAHAs. 
Post-SC  dose  Cycle  6,  one  of  the  5  patients  who  had  a  HAHA-positive  result  at  baseline  became 
HAHA-negative  and  was  considered  to  have  a  treatment-unaffected  response.  The  other  4  patients 
(6.5%)  tested  positive  for  HAHAs  at  baseline  and  at  subsequent  time  points;  two  were  considered 
treatment unaffected and two were considered to have a treatment-enhanced response. 
A further 2 patients who were baseline-negative for HAHA became positive and were considered to have 
a  treatment-induced  response.  None  of  the  patients  with  positive  HAHA  samples  had  neutralizing 
antibodies. 
All patients with HAHAs were responders at the 3-month follow-up visit, with the exception of one patient 
who had stable disease. Due to the low number of HAHA-positive patients, full assessment of the impact 
of HAHA is limited. 
Part 2 
Anti-Rituximab Antibodies (HACAs) 
In Part 2, samples for the HACA assay were collected at each treatment cycle prior to the administration 
of rituximab and at each follow-up visit until 24 months after the last dose of rituximab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 40/65 
 
At  baseline,  prior  to  treatment  with  rituximab,  the  prevalence  of  HACA  was  1%  (2  patients  from  the 
rituximab SC arm) based on 172 evaluable patients. The two patients with a positive result at baseline 
became HACA negative after treatment with rituximab (i.e., these patients were considered to have a 
treatment unaffected response). 
Additionally,  8  patients  (6  patients  in  rituximab  IV  and  2  patients  in  rituximab  SC)  who  were  HACA 
negative  at  baseline  developed  a  positive  response  at  one  or  two  time  points  following  treatment 
(treatment-induced HACA response), giving a post-baseline incidence of HACA of 6.7% (6/89) and 2.3% 
(2/85), respectively. Among the patients with a positive HACA response at any time during the study 
there were no positive results for anti-rHuPH20 antibodies reported. 
Anti-Rituximab Antibodies  
To  assess  the  potential  impact  of  HACA  on  safety,  the  incidence  of  AEs,  ARRs,  and  AEs  potentially 
indicative of anaphylactic reactions was compared between patients who had a positive HACA response at 
any time point during the study and those who were negative for HACAs at all-time points. 
Overall, the results in patients who were positive for HACAs were consistent with those of the overall 
rituximab-treated population with the most frequent AEs being neutropenia (2 patients in the rituximab 
IV  arm,  4  patients  in  the  rituximab  SC  arm),  thrombocytopenia  (2  patients  in  each  arm),  nausea  (3 
patients vs. 1 patient), pyrexia (2 patients vs 1 patient), and asthenia (2 patients vs. 1 patient). 
ARRs were reported in 37/83 patients (45%) among HACA-negative patients and 3/6 patients among 
HACA-positive patients in the rituximab IV arm. In the rituximab SC arm, ARRs were reported in 35/81 
patients (43%) among HACA-negative patients and 2/4 patients among HACA-positive patients. 
AEs  potentially  indicative  of  anaphylactic  reactions  were  reported  in  36/83  patients  (43%)  among 
HACA-negative patients and 1/6 patients among HACA positive patients in the rituximab IV arm. In the 
rituximab SC arm, AEs potentially indicative of anaphylactic reactions were reported in 36/81 patients 
(44%) among HACA-negative patients compared with 1/4 patients among HACA-positive patients. 
Given  the  small  number  of  patients  who  developed  HACA  in  this  part  of  the  study,  as  for  Part  1,  no 
definitive conclusion on the impact of HACA on efficacy and/or safety can be made. 
Anti-rHuPH20 Antibodies 
In  Part  2,  anti-rHuPH20  antibodies  (HAHAs)  were  only  measured  in  patients  randomized  to  the 
rituximab SC  arm.  Samples  for  the  HAHA  assay  were  collected  at  each  treatment  cycle  from  Cycle  2 
onwards prior to the administration of rituximab SC and at each follow-up visit until 9 months after the 
last dose of rituximab. 
At baseline, prior to treatment with rituximab SC, the prevalence of HAHA was 10.7% (9/84 patients). 
After  study  drug  administration,  9/85  patients  were  considered  positive  for  anti-rHuPH20  antibodies, 
giving a post-baseline incidence of HAHAs of 10.5%. 
Four of the patients with positive HAHA results at baseline became HAHA negative (or had no increase in 
endpoint titer) post-baseline and were considered to have a treatment-unaffected response. The other 5 
patients with a positive HAHA result at baseline were considered to have a treatment-enhanced response.  
Four patients who had a negative HAHA result at baseline developed a positive HAHA response at one or 
two time points following treatment and were considered to have a treatment-induced HAHA response. 
Results  in  patients  who  were  positive  for  HAHAs  were  consistent  with  those  of  the  HAHA  negative 
population  with  the  most  frequent  AEs  occurring  in  the  SOCs  blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders, 
general and administration site conditions, and gastrointestinal disorders. 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 41/65 
 
In the rituximab SC arm, a higher percentage of patients who were positive for HAHAs (7/13 patients; 
54%) experienced ARRs compared with patients who were negative for HAHAs (30/72 patients; 42%). All 
ARRs in HAHA-positive patients were experienced by single patients, with the exception of injection site 
erythema, chills and vomiting which were each reported in 2 HAHA patients.  
Nine of the 13 patients (69%) who were positive for HAHAs experienced an AE potentially indicative of an 
anaphylactic reaction (SMQ Anaphylactic reaction Wide) versus 28/72 patients (39%) who were negative 
for HAHAs. the most common events in both populations being erythema, cough and rash.  
Due  to  the  low  number  of  patients  who  tested  positive  for  HAHAs  and  the  imbalance  in  sample  size 
between the HAHA-positive patients (13 patients) and HAHA-negative patients (72 patients) in the SC 
arm, differences in incidence of ARRs and AEs potentially indicative of an anaphylactic reaction must be 
interpreted with extreme caution. 
Three patients developed HACA antibodies during Pars 1 of the SAWYER study. All three patients were 
responders to rituximab treatment. Due to the limited number of patients with positive HACA results, no 
definitive conclusion on the incidence of HACA positivity and its possible clinical consequences can be 
drawn.   
During  Part  1  of  the  SAWYER  study,  five  patients  were  reported to  have  positive  results  for  HAHA  at 
baseline  (before  exposure  to  SC  rituximab).  A  further  2  patients  became  HAHA  positive  and  were 
considered to have a treatment-induced response.  
In  Part  2  of  the  SAWYER  study,  2  patients  had  positive  HACA  results  at  baseline  and  an  additional  8 
patients tested HACA positive during the study. This is endorsed. 
Based  on  the  limited  data  it  does  not  appear  that  the  presence  of  HACA  has  an  effect  on  the  PK  of 
rituximab.  In  addition,  all  10  patients  with  a  positive  HACA  response  were  responders  (indicative  of 
rituximab  efficacy  despite  the  presence  of  HACA)  but  that  given  the  small  number  of  patients  who 
developed HACA no definitive conclusion on the impact of HACA on efficacy and/or safety can be drawn.  
During  Part  2  of  the  SAWYER  study,  9  patients  tested  positive  for  HAHA  prior  to  SC  rituximab 
administration. Four of these became HAHA negative during the study whereas five patients developed 
positive  HAHA  results  during  the  study.  This  pattern  of  HAHA  is  similar  to  what  was  observed  in  the 
previously granted IV to SC MabThera line extension for NHL and thus gives no reason for concern. All 13 
patients who had a positive HAHA result were responders and moreover, antibodies towards an excipient 
are not expected to influence efficacy.   
There was an imbalance in the number of patients who were positive for HAHA and who experienced AEs 
potentially indicative of an anaphylactic reaction as compared with patients who were HAHA negative. 
However, the low number of patients who tested positive for HAHA and the imbalance in sample size 
between HAHA positive and negative patients should warrant caution when interpreting data.

Discontinuation due to AES 
Part 1, Cycle 6 
No patient discontinued study treatment due to an AE during Cycle 6. 
Part 2 
A comparable proportion of patients in both arms discontinued study treatment due to an AE (8% IV vs. 
11% SC).  The most common AEs which led to treatment discontinuation were neutropenia (3 IV vs 1 SC) 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 42/65 
 
and thrombocytopenia (1 IV vs 2 SC); all other AEs were reported in single patients.  The majority of AEs 
leading to withdrawal were of Grade 3 or 4 severity. 
Adverse Events Leading to Dose Interruption or Modifications 
The protocol did not permit dose reductions for rituximab IV or rituximab SC.  However, it was possible to 
delay a treatment cycle (due to AEs), stop and/or restart rituximab infusions/injections (due to AEs), or 
reduce the rate of the rituximab infusions.   
Part 1, Cycle 6 
During Cycle 6 Part 1, the proportion of patients who had a treatment modification (mainly dose delays) 
was  similaracross  the  three  SC  dose  sub-cohorts.    The  overall  incidence  of  modifications  across  the 
sub-cohorts was 32% with the majority being due to AEs.   
Part 2 
The  highest  incidence  of  treatment  modifications  occurred  in  Cycle  1,  where  all  patients  received 
rituximab IV (28% IV arm vs 31% SC).  During Cycles 2 and 3, more treatment modifications (mostly 
dose delays) occurred for patients in the IV arm than in the SC arm.  However, during Cycles 4 to 6, 
treatment modifications (mainly dose delays) were more common in the SC arm.  Overall, the majority of 
treatment modifications in each cycle were due to AEs. 
A comparable and acceptably low number of patients discontinued in Part 2 of the SAWYER study. The 
most common AEs leading to discontinuation were neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. This is regarded 
acceptable. Treatment modifications were relatively common and fairly evenly distributed between the 
SC and IV treatment groups. The majority of treatment modifications were due to AEs. 
Overdose 
One  patient  in  the  present  study  BO25341  erroneously  received  an  overdose  of  rituximab  SC  on  one 
occasion.  The patient randomized to the SC arm, received 660 mg of rituximab IV in the first treatment 
cycle, as planned.  In Cycle 2, the patient received rituximab SC 2200 mg instead of 1600 mg in error.   
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The incidence of SAEs was comparable between treatment arms and that the incidence did not change 
notably  over  the  course  of  the  treatment.  Differences  between  treatment  groups  were  observed  and 
cutaneous/subcutaneous/connective tissue AEs were more prevalent with the SC formulation, which is 
acceptable. The occurrence of SAEs was balanced as were the low number of deaths of which the majority 
were  due  to  disease  progression.  Laboratory  findings  were  similar  between  the  IV  and  SC  treatment 
groups.  
No  different  safety  signals  were  detected  based  on  special  populations  with  the  exceptions  of  BSA. 
Patients with low BSA generally experienced a higher incidence of AEs in the blood and lymphatic system 
SOC. However, in general the differences between groups were considered sufficiently low to raise any 
concern with the fixed dose SC rituximab regimen. 
The incidence of treatment induced / enhanced anti- rituximab antibodies was similar in the 2 treatment 
arms; 6.7% (IV) vs 2.4.% (SC). The incidence of treatment induced / enhanced anti- rHuPH20 antibodies, 
only measured in patients in the SC arm was 10.6%. None of the patients who tested positive for anti- 
rHuPH20 antibodies, tested positive for neutralising antibodies. Presence of HACA and HAHA antibodies 
did not seem to impact safety nor efficacy. The SAWYER study in general did not reveal any new safety 
signals which were not already expected based on previous experience with rituximab SC.

A comparable and acceptably low number of patients discontinued in Part 2 of the SAWYER study.  
Overdose occurred was moderate and no untoward events were observed. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing have

Hepatitis B Reactivation 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states:  
None. 
(All Indications) 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening, including 
HBsAg-status, HBsAb-status and HBcAb-status, 
should be performed in all patients before 
initiation of treatment with MabThera as per 
institutional guidelines. At minimum this should 
include HBsAg-status and HBcAb-status. These 
can be complemented with other appropriate 
markers as per local guideline. Patients with 
active hepatitis B disease should not be treated 
with MabThera. Patients with positive hepatitis B 
serology (either HBsAg or HBcAb) should consult 
liver disease experts before start of treatment 
and should be monitored and managed following 
local medical standards to prevent hepatitis B 
reactivation.

Hypogammaglobulinemia 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states: 
None. 
(RA and GPA/MPA) 
Physicians should exercise caution when 
considering the use of MabThera in patients with 
a history of recurring or chronic infections or with 
underlying conditions which may further 
predispose patients to serious infection, e.g., 
hypogammaglobulinaemia. It is recommended 
that immunoglobulin levels are determined prior 
to initiating treatment with MabThera. 
RA 
Section 4.8 of the EU SmPC states: 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgG or IgM below the 
lower limit of normal) has been observed in RA 
patients treated with MabThera. There was no 
increased rate in overall infections or serious 
infections after the development of low IgG or 
IgM. 
A small number of spontaneous and literature 
cases of hypogammaglobulinaemia have been 
observed in paediatric patients treated with 
MabThera, in some cases severe and requiring 
long-term immunoglobulin substitution therapy.

Hypogammaglobulinaemia has been 
observed in pediatric patients treated with 
MabThera/Rituxan, in some cases severe 
and requiring long-term immunoglobulin 
substitution therapy. The consequences of 
long term B cell depletion in pediatric 
patients are unknown. 
GPA/MPA 
Section 4.8 of the EU SmPC states: 
Hypogammaglobulinaemia (IgA, IgG or IgM 
below the lower limit of normal) has been 
observed in GPA/MPA patients treated with 
MabThera. There was no increased rate in overall 
infections or serious infections in patients with 
low IgA, IgG or IgM.  
Tumor Lysis Syndrome 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states:  
None. 
(NHL/CLL) 
Patients with a high tumour burden or with a high 
number (≥25 x 109/l) of circulating malignant 
cells such as patients with CLL, who may be at 
higher risk of especially severe cytokine release 
syndrome, should only be treated with extreme 
caution. These patients should be very closely 
monitored throughout the first infusion. 
Consideration should be given to the use of a 
reduced infusion rate for the first infusion in 
these patients or a split dosing over two days 
during the first cycle and any subsequent cycles 
if the lymphocyte count is still >25 x 109/L. 
Severe cytokine release syndrome is 
characterised by severe dyspnea, often 
accompanied by bronchospasm and hypoxia, in 
addition to fever, chills, rigors, urticaria, and 
angioedema. This syndrome may be associated 
with some features of tumour lysis syndrome 
such as hyperuricaemia, hyperkalaemia, 
hypocalcaemia, hyperphosphaetemia, acute 
renal failure, elevated Lactate dehydrogenase 
(LDH) and may be associated with acute 
respiratory failure and death. The acute 
respiratory failure may be accompanied by 
events such as pulmonary interstitial infiltration 
or oedema, visible on a chest x-ray. The 
syndrome frequently manifests itself within one 
or two hours of initiating the first infusion. 
Patients with a history of pulmonary insufficiency 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 55/65 
 
 
 
or those with pulmonary tumour infiltration may 
be at greater risk of poor outcome and should be 
treated with increased caution. Patients who 
develop severe cytokine release syndrome 
should have their infusion interrupted 
immediately (see section 4.2) and should receive 
aggressive symptomatic treatment. Since initial 
improvement of clinical symptoms may be 
followed by deterioration, these patients should 
be closely monitored until tumour lysis syndrome 
and pulmonary infiltration have been resolved or 
ruled out. 
Serious Viral Infections 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states: 
None. 
(NHL/CLL) 
Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur 
during therapy with MabThera. MabThera should 
not be administered to patients with an active, 
severe infection (e.g., tuberculosis, sepsis and 
opportunistic infections) or severely 
immunocompromised patients (e.g., in 
hypogammaglobulinemia or where levels of CD4 
or CD8 are very low). Physicians should exercise 
caution when considering the use of MabThera in 
patients with a history of recurring or chronic 
infections or with underlying conditions which 
may further predispose patients to serious 
infection. Patients reporting signs and symptoms 
of infection following MabThera therapy should 
be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately. 
Before giving a subsequent course of MabThera 
treatment, patients should be re-evaluated for 
any potential risk for infections. 
Gastrointestinal 
Section 4.8 of the EU SmPC states: 
None. 
Perforation 
(NHL/CLL) 
Gastrointestinal perforation in some cases 
leading to death has been observed in patients 
receiving MabThera for treatment of non Hodkgin 
lymphoma. In the majority of these cases, 
MabThera was administered with chemotherapy.

clinical trials. Symptoms included pain, swelling, 
induration, haemorrhage, erythema, pruritus 
and rash. Some local cutaneous reactions 
occurred more than 24 hours after the MabThera 
subcutaneous administration. The majority of 
local cutaneous reactions seen following 
administration of MabThera subcutaneous 
formulation was mild or moderate and resolved 
without any specific treatment.

leukoencephalopathy syndrome (RPLS) have 
been reported. Signs and symptoms include 
visual disturbance, headache, seizures and

hypertension. A diagnosis of PRES/RPLS requires 
confirmation by brain imaging. The reported 
cases had recognized risk factors for PRES/RPLS, 
including the patients underlying disease, 
hypertension, immunosuppressive therapy 
and/or chemotherapy. 
De Novo hepatitis B (RA 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states:

and GPA/MPA) 
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) screening should be 
performed in all patients before initiation of 
treatment with MabThera. At minimum this 
should include HBsAgstatus and HBcAb-status. 
These can be complemented with other 
appropriate markers as per local guidelines. 
Patients with active hepatitis B disease should 
not be treated with MabThera. Patients with 
positive hepatitis B serology (either HBsAg 
or HBcAb) should consult liver disease experts 
before start of treatment and should be 
monitored and managed following local medical 
standards to prevent hepatitis B reactivation. 
Opportunistic Infections 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states: 
None. 
(All Indications) 
Serious infections, including fatalities, can occur 
during therapy with MabThera. MabThera should 
not be administered to patients with an active, 
severe infection (e.g., tuberculosis, sepsis and 
opportunistic infections) or severely 
immunocompromised patients (e.g., in 
hypogammaglobulinemia or where levels of CD4 
or CD8 are very low). Physicians should exercise 
caution when considering the use of MabThera in 
patients with a history of recurring or chronic 
infections or with underlying conditions which 
may further predispose patients to serious 
infection. Patients reporting signs and symptoms 
of infection following MabThera therapy should 
be promptly evaluated and treated appropriately. 
Before giving a subsequent course of MabThera 
treatment, patients should be re-evaluated for 
any potential risk for infections.

Depletion 
In the clinical trial evaluating MabThera 
(All Indications) 
maintenance treatment, median IgG levels 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016 
Page 57/65 
 
were below the lower limit of normal (LLN) 
(< 7 g/L) after induction treatment in both 
the observation and the MabThera groups. 
In the observation group, the median IgG level 
subsequently increased to above the LLN, but 
remained constant in the MabThera group. The 
proportion of patients with IgG levels below the 
LLN was about 60 % in the MabThera group 
throughout the 2 year treatment period, 
while it decreased in the observation group (36 
% after 2 years). 
In patients treated for haematological 
malignancies, B cell recovery began within 6 
months of treatment and generally returned to 
normal levels within 12 months after completion 
of therapy, although in some patients this may 
take longer (up to a median recovery time of 23 
months post-induction therapy). In rheumatoid 
arthritis patients, immediate depletion of B cells 
in the peripheral blood was observed following 
two infusions of 1000 mg MabThera separated by 
a 14 day interval. Peripheral blood B cell counts 
begin to increase from week 24 and evidence for 
repopulation is observed in the majority of 
patients by week 40, whether MabThera was 
administered as monotherapy or in combination 
with methotrexate. A small proportion of patients 
had prolonged peripheral B cell depletion lasting 
2 years or more after their last dose of MabThera. 
In patients with granulomatosis with polyangiitis 
or microscopic polyangiitis, the number of 
peripheral blood B cells decreased to <10 
cells/μL after two weekly infusions of rituximab 
375 mg/m2, and remained at that level in most 
patients up to the 6 month timepoint. The 
majority of patients (81%) showed signs of B cell 
return, with counts >10 cells/μL by month 12, 
increasing to 87% of patients by month 18.

possible risk for the development of solid

although present data do not seem to suggest 
any increased risk. 
Impact on Cardiovascular 
Section 4.4 of the EU SmPC states:  
None. 
Disease 
There are no data on the safety of MabThera in 
(RA and GPA/MPA) 
patients with moderate heart failure (NYHA class 
III) or severe, uncontrolled cardiovascular 
disease. In patients treated with MabThera, the 
occurrence of pre-existing ischemic cardiac 
conditions becoming symptomatic, such as 
angina pectoris, has been observed, as well as 
atrial fibrillation and flutter. Therefore, in 
patients with a known cardiac history, the risk of 
cardiovascular complications resulting from 
infusion reactions should be considered before 
treatment with MabThera and patients closely 
monitored during administration. Since 
hypotension may occur during MabThera 
infusion, consideration should be given to 
withholding anti-hypertensive medications 12 
hours prior to the MabThera infusion. 
Gastrointestinal 
Section 4.8 of the EU SmPC states: 
None. 
Perforation 
Gastrointestinal perforation in some cases 
(RA and GPA/MPA) 
leading to death has been observed in patients 
receiving MabThera for treatment of non Hodkgin 
lymphoma. In the majority of these cases, 
MabThera was administered with chemotherapy. 
The GI perforation has been included in the 
EU-RMP as a theoretical risk based on the 
Oncology identified risk, and the concomitant use 
of NSAIDs or corticosteroids by RA patients. The 
risk in Oncology has been described as related to 
TLS, and would therefore not apply to RA or 
GPA/MPA patients. Nonetheless, the data in RA 
and GPA/MPA are being collected from registries 
(for serious events) as well as via standard 
pharmacovigilance.

to ensure that label wording in the label is 
maintained to reflect appropriate information 
related to off-label use.

received a second course of MabThera therapy 
for treatment of relapse of disease activity which 
occurred between 6 and 18 months after the first 
course of MabThera. The limited data from the 
present study preclude any conclusions 
regarding the efficacy of subsequent courses of 
MabThera in patients with GPA/MPA.  
Continued immunosuppressive therapy may be 
especially appropriate in patients at risk for 
relapses (i.e., with history of earlier relapses and 
Granulomatosis with polyangiitis, or patients 
with reconstitution of B-lymphocytes in addition 
to PR3-ANCA at monitoring). When remission 
with MabThera has been achieved, continued 
immunosuppressive therapy may be considered 
to prevent relapse. The efficacy and safety of 
MabThera in maintenance therapy has not been

In embryofetal developmental studies in mice, 
rHuPH20 caused reduced fetal weight and loss of 
implantations at systemic exposures sufficiently 
in excess of human therapeutic exposure. There 
is no evidence of dysmorphogenesis (i.e. 
teratogenesis) resulting from systemic exposure 
to rHuPH20.

Label for rituximab SC recommend that 
patients who conceive whilst treated with 
rituximab SC should discontinue treatment 
with the SC formulation. Change to the IV 
formulation should only be considered if 
the possible benefit of continued treatment

Lactation 
IgG immunoglobulins are known to cross the

placental barrier. 
B cell levels in human neonates following 
maternal exposure to MabThera have not been 
studied in clinical trials. There are no adequate 
and well-controlled data from studies in pregnant 
women, however transient B-cell depletion and 
lymphocytopenia have been reported in some 
infants born to mothers exposed to rituximab 
during pregnancy. For these reasons MabThera 
should not be administered to pregnant women 
unless the possible benefit outweighs the 
potential risk. 
Whether rituximab is excreted in human milk is 
not known. However, because maternal IgG is 
excreted in human milk, and rituximab was 
detectable in milk from lactating monkeys, 
women should not breastfeed while treated with 
MabThera and for 12 months following MabThera 
treatment. 
Due to the long retention time of rituximab in 
B cell depleted patients, women of childbearing 
potential should use effective contraceptive

requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
The SAWYER study has provided evidence that administration of rituximab SC is non-inferior with regard 
to Ctrough when compared to rituximab IV. Thus, efficacy and safety seem to be comparable and the 
benefit of rituximab SC for CLL is mainly driven by a more convenient route of administration.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Administration  of  rituximab  IV  is  usually  preceded  by  administration  of  antipyrexic  and/or 
antihistaminergic  drugs  as  pre-treatment  and  this  has  been  applied  in  the  SAWYER  study.  It  was 
considered  of  interest  to  clarify  whether  more/equal/less  pre-treatment  is  necessary  when  changing 
routes  of  administration  from  IV  to  SC.  The  role  of  pre-treatment  with  antipyrexic  and/or 
antihistaminergic drugs in relation to rituximab SC administration do not raise any further objections. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
In addition, rituximab SC has a safety profile which is acceptable when compared to rituximab IV. The 
SAWYER  study  has  demonstrated  that  administration  of  rituximab  SC  carries  with  it  a  higher  risk  of 
cutaneous AEs than does IV administration. Indeed, AEs related to the SOCs of skin and subcutaneous 
tissue  disorders  and  musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  were  more  prominent  in  the  SC 
cohort as were injection site erythema and injection site pain. However, these AEs were generally of low 
Grade severity. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
Assessment report  
EMA/276108/2016

Long term safety data are lacking and will be provided by the submission of clinical study reports from 
ongoing trials (see Annex II). Final CSR from BO25341 will include reports on long term safety in relation 
to BSA (as measure for exposure variation) and to gender. 
An improvement of the rHuPH20 activity assay, to reduce the assay variability, is on-going and this is 
highly recommended. Preliminary validation data do support that the improved assay will have a lower 
variability compared to the currently used version of the assay. 
Administration route error associated with the SC formulation is considered a potential risk (see RMP) 
which can be managed with sufficient differentiation of the outer carton (addition of the indication, a peel 
off sticker, colour coded cartons, etc.). Also, the educational material reflects these two packages and 
informs adequately about the different indications.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The SAWYER study has provided evidence that administration of rituximab SC is non-inferior with regard 
to Ctrough when compared to rituximab IV. In addition, rituximab SC has a safety profile which is 
acceptable when compared to rituximab IV. Thus, efficacy and safety seem to be comparable and the 
benefit of rituximab SC for CLL is mainly driven by a more convenient route of administration. 
It is considered adequately shown that the favourable effects generally outweigh the unfavourable effects 
of MabThera 1600 mg SC for CLL.  
Benefit-risk balance 
The Benefit/Risk of MabThera 1600 mg solution for subcutaneous formulation injection in the treatment 
of adult patients with previously untreated and relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic leukaemia in 
combination with chemotherapy is considered positive.  
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Rituximab is currently approved in an IV administration for the treatment of CLL. However, IV 
administrations of rituximab are given as infusions over several hours. The possibility of administering 
rituximab by the SC route would provide for a more convenient and less time-consuming administration 
regimen. This holds the possibility of enhancing the treatment experience for both patients, doctors and 
nurses and might serve to improve the resource utilization at the treatment facility.  
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that MabThera is not similar to obinutuzumab, ofatumumab and 
ibrutinib within the meaning of Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix X. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the risk-benefit balance of MabThera 1600 mg solution for subcutaneous formulation injection in the 
treatment of adult patients with previously untreated and relapsed/refractory chronic lymphocytic 
leukaemia in combination with chemotherapy is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the 
marketing authorisation subject to the following conditions:

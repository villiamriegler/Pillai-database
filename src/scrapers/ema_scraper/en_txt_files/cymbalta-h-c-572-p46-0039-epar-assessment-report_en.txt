I.       INTRODUCTION 
On  2009-04-08,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  for  duloxetine,  in  accordance  with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
The MAH stated that the  submitted paediatric study does not influence the benefit risk for duloxetine 
and that no consequential regulatory action is required. 
II.  SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
II.1  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  the  Study  HMFN  (An  Open-Label  Study  of  Tolerability,  Safety,  and 
Pharmacokinetics  of  Duloxetine  in  the  Treatment  of  Children  and  Adolescents  with  Major  Depressive 
Disorder) is a stand alone study.  This is provided in line with the current 6 months reporting timeline.  
II.2  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Duloxetine is authorised as 30 mg, 40 mg and 60 mg, hard gastro-resistant capsules. Duloxetine is not 
indicated for use in children. So far, no suitable paediatric formulation is available. No clinical studies 
have been conducted for patients less than 18 years of age, although post marketing, off-label use has 
been reported.  
The study drug was provided in the form of 20 and 30 mg capsules of duloxetine enteric-coated pellets. 
Patients were given one to four capsules daily. 
II.3  Clinical aspects 
1. Introduction 
The  MAH  submitted  a  final  report  for  Study  HMFN  (An  Open-Label  Study  of  Tolerability,  Safety,  and 
Pharmacokinetics  of  Duloxetine  in  the  Treatment  of  Children  and  Adolescents  with  Major  Depressive 
Disorder). 
2. Clinical study 
Study F1J-MC-HMFN was a Phase 2, multicenter, open-label, single-arm study designed to evaluate the 
range of duloxetine tolerable doses and characterization of duloxetine pharmacokinetics in children and 
adolescents (aged 7 through 17 years) diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD).  
  Methods 
•  Objectives 
Primary Objective 
To assess the safety and tolerability of duloxetine in children and adolescents diagnosed with MDD.  
Secondary Objectives 
• To characterize the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine at steady-state in children and adolescents.

• To compare the steady-state duloxetine pharmacokinetics in children and adolescents with historical 
adult duloxetine pharmacokinetics. 
• To assess the efficacy of duloxetine at a proposed dose range of 20 to 120 mg once daily (QD). 
•  Study design 
The study was up to 32 weeks in duration and consisted of 5 study periods: 
  Study Period I: Screening (2 weeks) 
  Study Period II: Dose Titration with Pharmacokinetic Sampling (10 weeks) 
Time to titrate each patient at 1- to 2-week intervals to the patient’s highest tolerable dose up to a 
maximum dose of 120 mg QD based on safety, tolerability, and treatment response (CGI-Severity 
score).  
  Study Period III: Safety and Tolerability (8 weeks)                                                         
The duloxetine dose remained fixed throughout this Study Period. 
  Study Period IV: Extended Safety and Tolerability (3 months)                                                     
The patient’s dose was escalated or decreased at the investigator’s discretion. 
  Study Period V: Taper Phase (2 weeks):  
Patients gradually reduced their duloxetine dose rather than abruptly discontinuing duloxetine.  
•  Study population /Sample size 
Inclusion Criteria 
Outpatient  children  and  adolescents  aged  7  to  17  years,  who  meet  criteria  for  MDD  without 
psychotic features, single or recurrent, as defined by the DSM-IV and confirmed by the K-SADS-PL, 
with  a  MDD  severity  of  moderate  or  greater  (a  CDRS-R  total  score  of    ≥40  and  a  CGI-Severity 
rating of ≥4).  
The K-SADS-PL was used as a supplementary diagnostic instrument. This clinician rated instrument 
assessed  the  extent  of  symptoms  of  MDD  and  other  diagnoses  and  allowed  for  rating  the  worst 
part of an episode as well as symptoms over the past week.

Exclusion Criteria 
Patients  were  excluded  from  the  study  if  they  had  any  diagnosis  of  bipolar  disorder,  psychotic 
depression,  schizophrenia  or  other  psychotic  disorder,  anorexia,  bulimia,  obsessive  compulsive 
disorder, pervasive development disorder, borderline personality disorder, a current primary DSM-
IV Axis I disorder other than MDD, a current secondary DSM-IV Axis I disorder that required any 
pharmacologic  treatment,  or  if  they  had  a  significant  suicide  attempt  within  1  year  of  Visit  1  or 
were a suicidal risk as defined in the protocol. 
Approximately 64 patients were to be enrolled (within 4 age groups: 7 through 9 years, 10 through 
12  years,  13  through  14  years,  and  15  through  17  years  of  age)  and  to  have  approximately  4 
study completers per age stratum with relatively equal male and female patients within this sample 
by the end of Study Period III.  
•  Treatments 
All enrolled patients were assigned to duloxetine. Patients took duloxetine orally, in a dose range of 
20 to 120 mg QD. The proposed starting dose of 20 or 30 mg QD was based on body weight (20 to 
40 kg and >40 kg, respectively).  
Concomitant  medications  with  primarily  central  nervous  system  (CNS)  activity  were  not  allowed. 
Patients were allowed the episodic use of these medications to treat cold symptoms or insomnia.  
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The following efficacy measures were collected:  
•  The  CDRS-R  (Children’s  Depression  Rating  Scale-Revised)  is  a  clinician-rated  instrument 
designed to measure the presence and severity of depression in children. The scale consists of 17 
items  scored  on  a  1-  to  5-point  scale  or  1-  to  7-point  scale.  A  rating  of  1  indicates  normal 
functioning. Total scores range from 17 to 113.   
•  The  CGI-Severity  Scale  evaluates  the  severity  of  illness  at  the  time  of  assessment.  The  score 
ranges from 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill patients).  
•  The  CGI-Improvement  records  the  degree  of  the  patient’s  improvement  at  the  time  of 
assessment  since  starting  the  study  drug.  The  score  ranges  from  1  (“very  much  improved")  to  7 
(“very much worse”). 
Efficacy analyses were secondary for this study and included the following: 
•  Mean  change  from  baseline  to  endpoint  for  CDRS-R  Total  score  (LOCF)  during  Study  Period  
II/III;  
• Mean change from baseline to endpoint for CGI-Severity score (LOCF) during Study Period II/III;  
•  observed  cases  visit  wise  summaries  during  Study  Period  II/III  for  the  CDRS-R  Total  score  and 
for the CGI-Severity score.  
The following safety measurements were collected: 
  Adverse Events 
  Adverse  Event  Monitoring  with  a  Systemic  Questionnaire:  The  C-SSRS  and  the  Self-Harm 
Follow-up  Form  were  used  for  additional  monitoring  of  suicide-related  events  behavior 
and/or ideations. 
  Concomitant Therapies 
 
  Vital Signs 
  Electrocardiograms 
Laboratory Data 
Safety  was  assessed  by  summarizing  AEs  and  changes  in  laboratory  analytes,  vital  signs,  and 
ECGs. Patients were included in the extent of exposure analyses if they had non-missing exposure 
data for the reporting interval. 
Duloxetine steady-state plasma concentration from 64 patients (5 to 8 plasma concentrations per 
patient) was obtained to characterize the pharmacokinetics of duloxetine in paediatric patients. A 
population  pharmacokinetic  model  was  developed  using  a  nonlinear  mixed  effects  modelling 
program.

•  Statistical Methods 
Efficacy  and  safety  analyses  were  conducted  on  an  intent-to-treat  (ITT)  basis.  Last-observation-
carried-forward  imputation  was  primarily  used  for missing  data.  Observed  cases  analyses  use  all 
data available with no imputation performed. 
A  lock  of  all  pharmacokinetic  Study  Period  II  data  occurred  after  the  last  patient  visit  was 
completed  for  Study  Period  II  for  the  purpose  of  assessing  duloxetine  doses  for  future  Phase  3 
studies. The number of patients that had completed through this time point was 58.  In addition, 
an  interim  lock  of  all  Study  Period  II/III  data  occurred  for  the  purpose  of  assessing  safety  and 
tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy. Results for this interim analysis were submitted within 
a  Briefing  Document  to  the  FDA;  however,  these  results  were  not  communicated  to  the 
investigators. 
Subsequent  to  database  lock,  an  error  in  the  reporting  database  was  discovered.  This  error 
remains in the reporting database that was used for all analyses in this clinical study report. It is 
believed that this error is minor and did not affect any conclusions in this clinical study report. 
  Changes in the conduct of the study or planned analyses 
o  Two additional blood draws for clinical chemistry tests were performed during Study Period 
II for Weeks 2 and 6.  
o  Ad  hoc  analyses  combining  data  from  Study  Periods  II,  III,  and  IV  were  completed  to 
better characterize the longer-term safety and tolerability of duloxetine. 
o  The incidence of sustained elevations in blood pressure was also evaluated. 
o  Some  changes  to  the  planned  pharmacokinetic  analysis  occurred  following  the  review  of 
the  data  and  model  evaluation:  smoking  status  was  not  tested  as  a  covariate,  Schwartz 
formula  was  used  to  calculate  the  creatinine  clearance  in  children  less  than  12  years  of 
age, changes of criteria for retention of a covariate in the final model.

•  Baseline data 
Patients  entered  the  study  with  moderate  to  moderately  high  levels  of  depression  (mean  baseline 
CDRS-R  total  score  of  61.7,  scores  ranged  from  40.0  to  81.0).  Similarly,  patients  entered  the  study 
with moderate to severe illness, with a mean baseline CGI-Severity score of 4.5 (scores ranged from 
4.0 to 6.0). 
For  the  72  enrolled  patients,  the  mean  age  at  first  episode  of  MDD  was  10.75  years  of  age,  and  the 
mean number of previous MDD episodes was <1 episode with a minimum and maximum range of 0-6 
episodes.  
The  percent  of  patients  who  met  the  definition  of  compliance  with  study  drug  administration  was 
greater than 85% at all visit intervals during Study Periods II, III, and IV.

•  Pharmacokinetic results 
The  population  pharmacokinetic  analysis  dataset  consisted  of  319  duloxetine  concentrations  and 
associated  dose,  dosing  time,  sampling  time,  and  patient  demographic  information  from  29  children 
(7-12 years) and 33 adolescents (13-17 years). A total of 90 samples were below of quantitation limit.   
Majority  of  the  patients  are  nonsmokers,  extensive  CYP2D6  metabolizers  (EMs)  and  Caucasians  and 
received  either  30-,  60-  or  90-mg  duloxetine  dose.  The  percent  of  poor  metabolizers  (PMs)  is 
consistent  with  the  prevalence  of  5%  –  7%  PMs  in  Caucasians.  The  typical  duloxetine  plasma 
concentrations increased in proportion to the increase in dose.

The  median  dose-normalized  duloxetine  concentration  is  similar  in  EMs  (0.55  ng/mL/mg)  and  Ultra 
rapid  metabolizers  (UMs)  (0.48  ng/mL/mg);  however,  the  median  dose-normalized  duloxetine 
concentrations  are  nearly  3-fold  higher  in  PMs  (1.69  ng/mL/mg).  However,  there  was  considerable 
overlap in the observed concentrations for the PMs and EMs patients. 
As  in  adults,  the  duloxetine  plasma-concentration  time  data  in  paediatric  patients  are  adequately 
described  by  a  one-compartment  pharmacokinetic  model.  The  base  model  is  able  to  determine  the 
inter-patient  variability  in  CL/F  and  V/F  with  covariance  using  the  omega  block.  The  residual  error  is 
described by a proportional/additive error model. 
Gender is the only covariate that had a statistically significant influence on CL/F. CL/F of duloxetine in 
female  patients  is  approximately  30%  lower  as  compared  with  the  male  patients.  Given  the 
interpatient and intrapatient variability, there is considerable overlap in duloxetine concentration-time 
profile in females and males as shown in the model predictions.

Dose-normalized  duloxetine  concentrations  following  QD  dosing  regimen  demonstrate  that  the 
duloxetine  concentration  in  paediatric  patients  (children:  0.57  and  adolescents:  0.56  ng/mL/mg)  is 
slightly lower than those observed in adults (0.7 ng/mL/mg). However, there is considerable overlap in 
the  concentration  range  and  the  range  of  concentration  in  paediatric  patients  are  within  the  range 
observed in adults.

•  Safety results 
All  72  patients  enrolled  in  this  study  were  exposed  to  duloxetine  during  Study  Period  II/III  with  an 
overall mean duration of exposure of 106.7 days. Twenty patients initiated duloxetine treatment at 20 
mg QD and 52 patients initiated duloxetine treatment at 30 mg QD based on body weight. A majority 
of  patients  (52/72;  72%)  had  a  modal  duloxetine  dose  of  60,  90,  or  120  mg  QD,  17  patients  had  a 
modal dose of 30 mg QD, and 3 patients had a modal dose of 20 mg QD.

The majority of patients (55/72; 76%) required escalation of the duloxetine dose to 60, 90, or 120 mg 
QD during Study Period II in order to optimize efficacy. No patients with a modal dose of duloxetine 20 
mg completed Study Period III. The 48 patients who entered Study Period IV had a mean duration of 
exposure during Study Period IV of 77.5 days. Nine patients (12.5%) required dose decreases due to 
tolerability, and of these 9 patients, patients required dose decreases to below duloxetine 60 mg QD.  
Analysis  results  for  Study  Period  II/III  and  Study  Period  IV  are  presented  separately  in  this  study 
report.  During  Study  Period  II/III,  nausea  was  the  most  common  TEAE  (18  patients,  25%).  Other 
TEAEs  reported  by  at  least  5%  of  patients  during  this  study  period  were  headache,  vomiting, 
nasopharyngitis,  dizziness,  sedation,  somnolence,  abdominal  pain  upper,  fatigue,  decreased  appetite, 
dry  mouth,  gasteroenteritis  viral,  and  rhinorrhea.  During  Study  Period  IV,  no  TEAE  was  reported  by 
more  than  2  patients.  Dry  mouth  (4.2%),  fatigue  (4.2%)  and  somnolence  (4.2%)  were  the  most 
common TEAEs reported during Study Period IV.

Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other Notable Adverse Events 
There were  no deaths reported  during the study.  Overall, 5 patients reported a total of 6 SAEs. All 6 
SAEs had an onset date during Study Period II/III. None of the SAEs reported were considered by the 
investigator  to  be  related  to  study  drug,  and  none  of  these  patients  were  identified  as  CYP2D6  poor 
metabolizers. 
•  A  male  experienced  the  SAE  of worsening  of  oppositional  defiant  disorder  (ODD).  The patient 
had a history of ODD, but was not taking any concomitant medications. 
•  An female experienced the SAE of self-injurious behaviour. The patient had a history of sexual 
abuse  and  MDD.  She  was  receiving  acetylsalicylic  acid  as  concomitant  medication  for  plantar 
warts. 
•  A female patient experienced the SAE of self-injurious behaviour. The patient had no previous 
history of such behaviour and was not taking any concomitant medications. 
•  A  female  assigned  to  open-label  duloxetine  for  the  treatment  of  MDD  experienced  the  SAE  of 
worsening of depression and suicidal ideation. The patient had a history of separation anxiety 
(resolved  in  2005)  and  a  motor  vehicle  accident  (2006),  which  resulted  in  whiplash, 
intermittent  headaches,  dizziness,  back,  neck,  and  shoulder  pain.  The  patient  was  taking  the 
concomitant medications of omega-3 supplement and calcium with magnesium. 
•  A female assigned to open-label duloxetine for the treatment of MDD, experienced the SAE of 
viral  gastroenteritis.  The  patient  had  no  relevant  medical  history  and  was  not  taking  any 
concomitant medications.

Adverse Events Reported as Reason for Discontinuation 
Three  patients  reported  1  AE  each  (nausea,  rash,  attention  deficit/hyperactivity  disorder)  that  led  to 
discontinuation  during  Study  Period  II/III.  These  events  were  considered  to  be  related  to  study 
treatment. One patient reported an AE that led to discontinuation during Study Period IV (irritability), 
and the event was not considered to be related to study treatment.  
 Suicide-Related Outcomes 
  Children’s Depression Rating Scale Item 13 
An emergence of any suicidal ideation was reported for Study Period II/III; that is, the percentage of 
patients  with  score  less  than  or  equal  to  2  at  all  baseline  visits  and  greater  than  2  within  the  study 
period was 2.8%. There was no incidence of emergence of substantial suicidal ideation in either Study 
Period II/III or Study Period IV; that is, the percentage of patients with score less than or equal to 2 at 
all  baseline  visits  and  greater  than  4  within  the  study  period  was  0%.  The  incidence  of  worsening  of 
suicidal ideation (that is, the maximum score within the study period was greater than the maximum 
baseline  score)  was  8.3%  for  Study  Period  II/III  and  2.1%  for  Study  Period  IV.  However,  an 
improvement  of  suicidal  ideation  (that  is,  a  decrease  from  the  maximum  baseline  score)  was  also 
shown  in  both  Study  Period  II/III  and  Study  Period  IV;  >35%  of  patients  had  a  decrease  from  the 
maximum suicidal ideation baseline score during these study periods.

  Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale 
One  (1.4%)  nonfatal  suicide  event  was  reported.  This  event  was  the  only  event  reported  for  the 
suicidal behaviour (1-5) category in the C-SSRS during Study Period II/III. During Study Period II/III, 
1 (1.4%) patients experienced worsening of suicidal ideation from baseline 
at any time during Study Periods II or III. 
No  suicidal  behaviours  (1-5  category  in  the  C-SSRS)  were  reported  during  Study  Period  IV.  During 
Study Period IV, 1 (2.2%) patient experienced worsening of suicidal ideation from baseline at anytime 
during Study Period IV. 
Out of 19 patients who reported suicidal ideation at baseline, 17 (89.5%) reported an improvement in 
suicidal ideation  at last  observation  during  Study Periods  II  and  III  (Table  HMFN.14.51).  For  patients 
who had suicidal ideation at baseline and continued in the study through Study Period IV (N=8), all 8 
patients (100%) reported an improvement in suicidal ideation at last observation during Study Period 
IV. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Baseline  to  endpoint  changes  were  observed  for  some  laboratory  analytes;  however,  these  changes 
were small relative to baseline and relative to the standard deviation. 
Greater than 5% of patients experienced low hematocrit (8, 13.3%), high creatine phosphokinase (6, 
8.7%),  and  high  inorganic  phosphorus  (16,  25.8%)  during  Study  Period  II/III.  The  only  laboratory 
value  with  a  potentially  clinically  significant  change  experienced  by  greater  than  5%  of  patients  was 
inorganic  phosphorus  (7.7%)  during  Study  Period  IV.  Transient  elevations  in  creatine  phosphokinase 
and inorganic phosphorus have also been observed in duloxetine-treated adults.

One patient experienced a potentially clinically significant (PCS) elevation of alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT).  After  approximately  14  weeks,  the  patient’s  ALT  reached  5X  upper  limit  of  normal  (ULN),  but 
total  bilirubin,  AST,  GGT,  and  CPK  were  all  normal.  A  retest  revealed  that  the  ALT  elevation  had 
returned  to  normal  within  3  days  while  the  patient  continued  to  take  study  drug,  and  the  event 
appeared to be an isolated elevation. 
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
During Study Periods II/III and Study Period IV, patients experienced mean increases in diastolic 
blood  pressure,  systolic  blood  pressure,  and  weight  as  well  as  a  mean  decrease  in  pulse.  Small 
increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure have also been observed in duloxetine-treated adults. 
Overall,  approximately  20%  of  patients  experienced  PCS  high  diastolic  blood  pressure  and 
approximately  10%  of  patients  experienced  PCS  high  systolic  blood  pressure,  while  3%  of  patients 
experienced PCS high pulse at anytime. The percentage of enrolled patients with sustained elevation of 
blood  pressure,  either  diastolic  or  systolic,  was  5.6%  (4/72).  One  patient  experienced  sustained 
elevation  of diastolic  blood  pressure,  and  3  patients  experienced  sustained  elevation  of systolic  blood 
pressure. 
3. Discussion on clinical aspects 
Duloxetine has been approved in the European Union for the treatment of severe urinary incontinence 
(Ariclaim,  Yentreve)  and  for  the  treatment  of  major  depressive  disorders,  the  treatment  of  diabetic 
peripheral neuropathic pain and the treatment of generalised anxiety disorder (Cymbalta, Xeristar). 
Treatment of children and adolescents with duloxetine is not recommended in the approved SPC. This 
study was conducted as part of a paediatric plan committed with the FDA. In the EU there is no agreed 
PIP  for  duloxetine  and  therefore  this  is  provided  as  a  standalone  study  in  line  with  the  current  6 
months reporting timeline. 
This study was conducted to provide preliminary results on safety and pharmacokinetics in paediatric 
MDD population. A total of 72 patients aged 7 to 17 years were titrated from 20 (or 30) mg to 120 mg 
and  41  were  treated  up  to  30  weeks.  Two  third  of  patients    were  escalated  up  to  60,  90  or  120  mg 
dosage, what it is within the range of adult dosage recommendations. The safety profile of duloxetine 
at  those  dosages  in  paediatric  population  resulted  in  general  similar  to  that  observed  in  adults.  The 
fragmented method of reporting of AEs by study period hampered having a global view of the product. 
Nevertheless, no new safety findings have been observed. Of concern, two suicidal ideations and two 
self-injurious  behaviour  AEs  were  reported.  The  evaluation  of  specific  suicide-related  outcomes  does 
not  provide  additional  concerns  on  this  issue,  what  could  be  considered  expectable  in  the  context  of 
the condition.      
Duloxetine plasma concentrations increased in proportion to the increase of the dose. Gender (and not 
age,  body  weight,  creatinine  clearance,  CYP2D6  status,  or  dose)  was  the  only  characteristic  that 
seemed  to  influence  the  pharmacokinetic  of  duloxetine.  As  it  was  observed  in  adults  the  inter-  and 
intrapatient variability is very high, with an overlap in duloxetine concentration-time profile in females 
and males.  
Children  and  adolescents  involved  in  the  trial  suffered  a  moderate  depression.  About  7%  of  patients 
had previously been treated with psychotherapy and over 40% received antidepressant drugs. Of note, 
amphetamine-derived  drugs  and  atomoxetine  were  reported  by  27/72  patients  although  apparently 
only  3  patients  reported  concomitant  attention  deficit/hyperactivity  disorder  diagnose.  Efficacy 
parameters measured after 8 weeks and 18 weeks of treatment showed lower scores (response) with 
respect  to  baseline  scores.  The  open  label  design  and  the  small  size  of  the  trial  make  these  results 
inconclusive.  
According to the MAH statement, results from this study will be informative for the designs of larger, 
controlled,  Phase  III  studies.  At  present  the  current  benefit/risk  ratio  of  duloxetine  use  in  children, 
which is considered negative, should remain without changes in the SPC.

Rapporteur’s Overall Conclusion AND RECOMMENDATION 
  Overall conclusion 
The  additional  data  provided  in  this  submission  do  not  change  the  current  benefit/risk  ratio  of 
duloxetine  use  in  children,  which  is  considered  negative,  as  stated  in  currently  approved  SPC. 
According  to  the  MAH’s  conclusion,  given  that  there  were  no  new  safety  findings  in  paediatric  MDD 
patients  relative  to  adult  patients  in  this  open  label  study,  the  additional  data  provided  in  this 
submission do no warrant an update of the product information. 
  Recommendation  
X  Fulfilled: 
No regulatory action required

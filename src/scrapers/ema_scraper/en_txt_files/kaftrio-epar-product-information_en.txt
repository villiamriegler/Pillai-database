CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Kaftrio tablets are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in patients aged 6 years and older who have at least one F508del mutation in the cystic 
fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Kaftrio should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals with experience in the treatment of CF. 
If the patient’s genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be 
performed to confirm the presence of at least one F508del mutation using a genotyping assay (see 
section 5.1). 
Monitoring of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin is recommended for all patients prior 
to initiating treatment, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. For 
patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring should be 
considered (see section 4.4).

Special populations  
Elderly population 
No dose adjustment is recommended for the elderly patient population (see sections 4.4 and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment 
Treatment of patients with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class B) is not recommended. 
For patients with moderate hepatic impairment, the use of Kaftrio should only be considered when 
there is a clear medical need, and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be 
used with caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3). 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but 
the exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with 
severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with Kaftrio. 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment 
(see Table 3) (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2).

Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There is 
no experience in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor in children aged less than 2 years 
have not yet been established. No data are available. 
Method of administration  
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
For oral use. Patients should be instructed to swallow the tablets whole. The tablets should not be 
chewed, crushed, or broken before swallowing because there are no clinical data currently available to 
support other methods of administration; chewing or crushing the tablet is not recommended. 
Kaftrio should be taken with fat-containing food. Examples of meals or snacks that contain fat are 
those prepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs, cheeses, nuts, whole milk, or meats (see 
section 5.2). 
Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with Kaftrio (see section 4.5). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Elevated transaminases and hepatic injury 
In a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension liver failure leading to transplantation has been 
reported while receiving IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with ivacaftor. IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination 
with IVA should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease (e.g., 
cirrhosis, portal hypertension) and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used in 
these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 
and 5.2). 
Elevated transaminases are common in patients with CF. In clinical studies, elevated transaminases 
were more frequently observed in patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA 
compared to placebo. In patients taking IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, these elevations 
have sometimes been associated with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. Assessments of 
transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin are recommended for all patients prior to initiating 
treatment, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter (see section 4.2). 
For patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring 
should be considered. In the event of ALT or AST >5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or 
AST >3 x ULN with bilirubin >2 x ULN, dosing should be interrupted, and laboratory tests closely 
followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following the resolution of transaminase elevations, the 
benefits and risks of resuming treatment should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment  
Treatment of patients with moderate hepatic impairment is not recommended. For patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment, the use of IVA/TEZ/ELX should only be considered when there is a 
clear medical need, and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used with 
caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3). 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX (see sections 4.2, 
4.8, and 5.2). 
Depression 
Depression (including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) has been reported in patients treated with 
IVA/TEZ/ELX, usually occurring within three months of treatment initiation and in patients with a 
history of psychiatric disorders. In some cases, symptom improvement was reported after dose 
reduction or treatment discontinuation. Patients (and caregivers) should be alerted about the need to 
monitor for depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical 
advice immediately if these symptoms present. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment  
There is no experience in patients with severe renal impairment/end-stage renal disease therefore 
caution is recommended in this population (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Patients after organ transplantation  
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has not been studied in patients with CF who have 
undergone organ transplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See 
section 4.5 for interactions with commonly used immunosuppressants. 
Rash events  
The incidence of rash events was higher in females than in males, particularly in females taking 
hormonal contraceptives. A role for hormonal contraceptives in the occurrence of rash cannot be 
excluded. For patients taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, interrupting treatment with 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA and hormonal contraceptives should be considered. 
Following the resolution of rash, it should be considered if resuming IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination 
with IVA without hormonal contraceptives is appropriate. If rash does not recur, resumption of 
hormonal contraceptives can be considered (see section 4.8). 
Elderly population 
Clinical studies of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA did not include sufficient number of 
patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether response in these patients is different from 
younger adults. Dose recommendations are based on the pharmacokinetic profile and knowledge from 
studies with tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) in combination with ivacaftor (IVA), and ivacaftor (IVA) 
monotherapy (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Interactions with medicinal products  
CYP3A inducers 
Exposure to IVA is significantly decreased and exposures to ELX and TEZ are expected to decrease 
by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, potentially resulting in the reduced efficacy of 
IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA; therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not 
recommended (see section 4.5). 
CYP3A inhibitors 
Exposures of ELX, TEZ and IVA are increased when co-administered with strong or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA should be adjusted when used concomitantly 
with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5 and Table 2 in section 4.2). 
Cataracts  
Cases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric 
patients treated with IVA-containing regimens. Although other risk factors were present in some cases 
(such as corticosteroid use, exposure to radiation) a possible risk attributable to treatment with IVA 
cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in 
paediatric patients initiating treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (see section 5.3).

4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Medicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of ELX, TEZ and/or IVA  
CYP3A inducers 
ELX, TEZ and IVA are substrates of CYP3A (IVA is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A). Concomitant 
use of strong CYP3A inducers may result in reduced exposures and thus reduced IVA/TEZ/ELX 
efficacy. Co-administration of IVA with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased 
IVA area under the curve (AUC) by 89%. ELX and TEZ exposures are also expected to decrease 
during co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers; therefore, co-administration with strong 
CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Examples of strong CYP3A inducers include: 
• 
rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John’s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum) 
CYP3A inhibitors 
Co-administration with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased ELX AUC by 2.8-fold and 
TEZ AUC by 4.0- to 4.5-fold. When co-administered with itraconazole and ketoconazole, IVA AUC 
increased by 15.6-fold and 8.5-fold, respectively. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA should be 
reduced when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and 
section 4.4). 
Examples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include: 
• 
• 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole 
telithromycin and clarithromycin 
Simulations indicated that co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors fluconazole, 
erythromycin and verapamil, may increase ELX and TEZ AUC by approximately 1.9- to 2.3-fold. Co-
administration of fluconazole increased IVA AUC by 2.9-fold. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA 
should be reduced when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 in section 4.2 
and section 4.4). 
Examples of moderate CYP3A inhibitors include: 
• 
• 
fluconazole 
erythromycin 
Co-administration with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately 
inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of ELX, TEZ and IVA. Food or drink containing grapefruit 
should be avoided during treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA (see section 4.2). 
Potential for interaction with transporters  
In vitro studies showed that ELX is a substrate for the efflux transporters P-gp and Breast Cancer 
Resistance Protein (BCRP) but is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Exposure to ELX is not 
expected to be affected significantly by concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors due to its high 
intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact. 
In vitro studies showed that TEZ is a substrate for the uptake transporter OATP1B1 and efflux 
transporters P-gp and BCRP. TEZ is not a substrate for OATP1B3. Exposure to TEZ is not expected 
to be affected significantly by concomitant inhibitors of OATP1B1, P-gp, or BCRP due to its high 
intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact. However, exposure to M2-TEZ 
(TEZ metabolite) may be increased by inhibitors of P-gp. Therefore, caution should be used when P-
gp inhibitors (e.g., ciclosporin) are used with IVA/TEZ/ELX. 
In vitro studies showed that IVA is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or P-gp. IVA and its 
metabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro. Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood 
of being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of IVA 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be clinically 
relevant. 
Medicinal products affected by ELX, TEZ and/or IVA  
CYP2C9 substrates  
IVA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalised ratio (INR) during 
co-administration of warfarin with IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA is recommended. Other medicinal 
products for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal 
products should be used with caution. 
Potential for interaction with transporters 
Co-administration of IVA or TEZ/IVA with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin 
AUC by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by IVA. Administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX 
and IVA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, 
which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used 
concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index such as 
ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus and tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. 
ELX and M23-ELX inhibit uptake by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro. TEZ/IVA increased the 
AUC of pitavastatin, an OATP1B1 substrate, by 1.2-fold. Co-administration with IVA/TEZ/ELX in 
combination with IVA may increase exposures of medicinal products that are substrates of these 
transporters, such as statins, glyburide, nateglinide and repaglinide. When used concomitantly with 
substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. Bilirubin is 
an OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate. In study 445-102, mild increases in mean total bilirubin were 
observed (up to 4.0 µmol/L change from baseline). This finding is consistent with the in vitro 
inhibition of bilirubin transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by ELX and M23-ELX.  
ELX and IVA are inhibitors of BCRP. Co-administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX, and IVA may increase 
exposures of medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP, such as rosuvastatin. When used 
concomitantly with substrates of BCRP, appropriate monitoring should be used. 
Hormonal contraceptives  
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has been studied with ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel and 
was found to have no clinically relevant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. 
IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA is not expected to have an impact on the efficacy of oral contraceptives. 
Paediatric population  
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ELX, TEZ 
or IVA in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with 
respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid 
the use of IVA/TEZ/ELX during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding  
Limited data show that ELX, TEZ, and IVA are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
or to discontinue/abstain from IVA/TEZ/ELX therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding 
for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility  
There are no data available on the effect of ELX, TEZ and IVA on fertility in humans. TEZ had no 
effects on fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at clinically relevant 
exposures. ELX and IVA had an effect on fertility in rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. 
Dizziness has been reported in patients receiving IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, TEZ/IVA 
in combination with IVA as well as IVA (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing dizziness should be 
advised not to drive or use machines until symptoms abate. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile  
The most common adverse reactions experienced by patients aged 12 years and older who received 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA were headache (17.3%), diarrhoea (12.9%), upper 
respiratory tract infection (11.9%) and aminotransferase increased (10.9%).  
Serious adverse reactions of rash experienced by patients aged 12 years and older were reported in 
1.5% patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Transaminase elevations 
In study 445-102, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, or >3 x the ULN 
was 1.5%, 2.5% and 7.9% in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.5% and 5.5% in 
placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations was 10.9% in 
IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 4.0% in placebo-treated patients. 
During the open label studies, some patients discontinued treatment due to elevated transaminases. 
Post-marketing cases of treatment discontinuation due to elevated transaminases have been reported 
(see section 4.4). 
Rash events 
In study 445-102, the incidence of rash events (e.g., rash, rash pruritic) was 10.9% in 
IVA/TEZ/ELX- and 6.5% in placebo-treated patients. The rash events were generally mild to 
moderate in severity. The incidence of rash events by patient sex was 5.8% in males and 16.3% in 
females in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 4.8% in males and 8.3% in females in placebo-treated 
patients. In patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX, the incidence of rash events was 20.5% in females 
taking hormonal contraceptive and 13.6% in females not taking hormonal contraceptive (see 
section 4.4). 
Increased creatine phosphokinase  
In study 445-102, the incidence of maximum creatine phosphokinase >5 x the ULN was 10.4% in 
IVA/TEZ/ELX- and 5.0% in placebo-treated patients. The observed creatine phosphokinase elevations 
were generally transient and asymptomatic and many were preceded by exercise. No 
IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients discontinued treatment for increased creatine phosphokinase. 
Increased blood pressure 
In study 445-102, the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
was 3.5 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively for IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients (baseline: 113 mmHg 
systolic and 69 mmHg diastolic) and 0.9 mmHg and 0.5 mmHg, respectively for placebo-treated 
patients (baseline: 114 mmHg systolic and 70 mmHg diastolic). 
The proportion of patients who had systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 
>90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 5.0% and 3.0%, respectively in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated 
patients compared with 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively in placebo-treated patients. 
Paediatric population  
The safety data of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in studies 102, 103, 104,106 and 111 was 
evaluated in 228 patients between 2 to less than 18 years of age. The safety profile is generally 
consistent among paediatric and adult patients. 
During study 445-106 in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase 
(ALT or AST) >8, >5, and >3 x ULN were 0.0%, 1.5%, and 10.6%, respectively. No 
IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients had transaminase elevation >3 x ULN associated with elevated total 
bilirubin >2 x ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4). 
During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase 
(ALT or AST) >8, >5, and >3 x ULN were 1.3%, 2.7%, and 8.0% respectively. No IVA/TEZ/ELX-
treated patients had transaminase elevation >3 x ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin 
>2 x ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4).

Rash 
During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, 15 (20.0%) subjects had at least 1 rash 
event, 4 (9.8%) females and 11 (32.4%) males. 
Lenticular opacity 
One patient had an adverse event of lenticular opacity.  
Other special populations  
With the exception of sex differences in rash, the safety profile of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with 
IVA was generally similar across all subgroups of patients, including analysis by age, baseline percent 
predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) and geographic regions. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No specific antidote is available for overdose with IVA/TEZ/ELX. Treatment of overdose consists of 
general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status 
of the patient.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX32 
Mechanism of action  
ELX and TEZ are CFTR correctors that bind to different sites on the CFTR protein and have an 
additive effect in facilitating the cellular processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR to increase the 
amount of CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface compared to either molecule alone. IVA 
potentiates the channel open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface.  
The combined effect of ELX, TEZ and IVA is increased quantity and function of F508del-CFTR at 
the cell surface, resulting in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR mediated chloride 
transport. With regard to non-F508del CFTR variants on the second allele, it is not clear whether and 
to what extent the combination of ELX, TEZ and IVA also increases the amount of these mutated 
CFTR variants on the cell surface and potentiates its channel open probability (or gating). 
Pharmacodynamic effects  
Effects on sweat chloride 
In study 445-102 (patients with an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele 
that predicts either no production of a CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that does not transport chloride 
and is not responsive to other CFTR modulators [IVA and TEZ/IVA] in vitro), a reduction in sweat 
chloride was observed from baseline at week 4 and sustained through the 24-week treatment period. 
The treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to placebo for mean 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -41.8 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -44.4, -39.3; P < 0.0001). 
In study 445-103 (patients homozygous for the F508del mutation), the treatment difference of 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA for mean 
absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at week 4 was -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -50.1, -40.1; 
P < 0.0001). 
In study 445-104 (patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele 
with a gating defect or residual CFTR activity), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from 
baseline through week 8 for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group was -22.3 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -24.5, -20.2; P < 0.0001). The treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with 
IVA compared to the control group (IVA group or TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA group) 
was -23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1; P < 0.0001).  
In study 445-106 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation 
or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation), the mean absolute change 
in sweat chloride from baseline (n=62) through week 24 (n=60) was -60.9 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -63.7, -58.2)*. The mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 12 
(n=59) was -58.6 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.1, -56.1).  
* Not all participants included in the analyses had data available for all follow-up visits, especially 
from week 16 onwards. The ability to collect data at week 24 was hampered by the COVID-19 
pandemic. Week 12 data were less impacted by the pandemic.  
In study 445-116 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation 
and a minimal function mutation), treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA resulted in 
reduction in sweat chloride through week 24, as compared to placebo. The LS mean treatment 
difference for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group versus placebo for absolute change 
in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -51.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -55.3, -47.1; nominal 
P<0.0001).  
Cardiovascular effects 
Effect on QT interval  
At doses up to 2 times the maximum recommended dose of ELX and 3 times the maximum 
recommended dose of TEZ and IVA, the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects was not prolonged to 
any clinically relevant extent. 
Heart rate  
In study 445-102, mean decreases in heart rate of 3.7 to 5.8 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline 
(76 bpm) were observed in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in patients with CF was demonstrated in six 
Phase 3 studies. Patients enrolled in these studies were homozygous for the F508del mutation or 
heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation with minimal function (MF), a gating defect, or 
residual CFTR activity on the second allele. Not all F508del heterozygotes have been clinically 
evaluated with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. 
Study 445-102 was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients who 
had an F508del mutation on one allele and an MF mutation on the second allele. CF patients eligible 
for this study were required to either have Class I mutations that predicted no CFTR protein being 
produced (including nonsense mutations, canonical splice mutations and insertion/deletion frameshift 
mutations both small (≤3 nucleotide) and non-small (>3 nucleotide)), or missense mutations which 
results in CFTR protein that does not transport chloride and is not responsive to IVA and TEZ/IVA 
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
in vitro. The most frequent alleles with minimal function assessed in the study were G542X, W1282X, 
R553X, and R1162X; 621+1G→T, 1717-1G→A, and 1898+1G→A; 3659delC, and 394delTT; 
CFTRdele2,3; and N1303K, I507del, G85E, R347P, and R560T. A total of 403 patients aged 12 years 
and older (mean age 26.2 years) were randomised and dosed to receive placebo or IVA/TEZ/ELX in 
combination with IVA. Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean ppFEV1 at 
baseline was 61.4% (range: 32.3%, 97.1%).  
Study 445-103 was a 4-week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study in patients who were 
homozygous for the F508del mutation. A total of 107 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 
28.4 years) received TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA during a 4-week open-label run-in period and 
were then randomised and dosed to receive either IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA or 
TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA during a 4-week double-blind treatment period. Patients had a 
ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline, following the run-in period was 
60.9% (range: 35.0%, 89.0%). 
Study 445-104 was an 8-week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study in patients who were 
heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele with a gating defect 
(Gating) or residual CFTR activity (RF). A total of 258 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 
37.7 years) received either IVA (F/Gating) or TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA (F/RF) during a 
4-week open-label run-in period and were dosed during the treatment period and patients with the 
F/R117H genotype received IVA during the run-in period. Patients were then randomised and dosed to 
receive either IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA or remained on the CFTR modulator therapy 
received during the run-in period. Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean 
ppFEV1 at baseline, following the run-in period, was 67.6% (range: 29.7%, 113.5%). 
Study 445-106 was a 24-week open-label study in patients who were homozygous for the F508del 
mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation. A total of 66 
patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.3 years) were dosed according to weight. 
Patients weighing <30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 37.5 mg/TEZ 25 mg/ELX 50 mg 
tablets in the morning and one IVA 75 mg tablet in the evening. Patients weighing ≥30 kg at baseline 
were administered two IVA 75 mg/TEZ 50 mg/ELX 100 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 
150 mg tablet in the evening. Patients had a ppFEV1 ≥40% and weighed ≥15 kg at screening. The 
mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 88.8% (range: 39.0%, 127.1%). 
Study 445-116 was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients aged 6 
to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.2 years) who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation 
and a minimal function mutation. A total of 121 patients were randomised to receive either placebo or 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. Patients who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with 
IVA weighing <30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 37.5 mg/TEZ 25 mg/ELX 50 mg tablets 
in the morning and one IVA 75 mg tablet in the evening. Patients weighing ≥30 kg at baseline were 
administered two IVA 75 mg/TEZ 50 mg/ELX 100 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 150 mg 
tablet in the evening. At screening, patients had a ppFEV1 ≥70% [mean ppFEV1 at baseline of 89.3% 
(range: 44.6%, 121.8%)], LCI2.5 result ≥7.5 [mean LCI2.5 at baseline of 10.01 (range: 6.91, 18.36)], 
and weighed ≥15 kg. 
Patients in these studies continued on their CF therapies (e.g., bronchodilators, inhaled antibiotics, 
dornase alfa and hypertonic saline), but discontinued any previous CFTR modulator therapies, except 
for study medicinal products. Patients had a confirmed diagnosis of CF. 
In studies 445-102, 445-103, 445-104, and 445-106, patients who had lung infection with organisms 
associated with a more rapid decline in pulmonary status, including but not limited to Burkholderia 
cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, or Mycobacterium abscessus, or who had an abnormal liver 
function test at screening (ALT, AST, ALP, or GGT ≥3 x ULN, or total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN), were 
excluded. Patients in studies 445-102 and 445-103 were eligible to roll over into a 192-week 
open-label extension study (study 445-105).

Patients in studies 445-104, 445-106, and 445-116 were eligible to roll over into separate open-label 
extension studies. 
Study 445-102 
In study 445-102 the primary endpoint was mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through 
week 24. Treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to placebo resulted in 
statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 of 14.3 percentage points (95% CI: 12.7, 15.8; 
P < 0.0001) (see Table 5). Mean improvement in ppFEV1 was observed at the first assessment on 
day 15 and sustained through the 24-week treatment period. Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed 
regardless of age, baseline ppFEV1, sex, and geographic region. 
A total of 18 patients receiving IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA had ppFEV1 <40 percentage 
points at baseline. The safety and efficacy in this subgroup were consistent to those observed in the 
overall population. The mean treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with 
IVA- compared to placebo-treated patients for absolute change in ppFEV1 through week 24 in this 
subgroup was 18.4 percentage points (95% CI: 11.5, 25.3).

Study 445-104 
In study 445-104 the primary endpoint was within-group mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from 
baseline through week 8 for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group. Treatment with 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA resulted in statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 
from baseline of 3.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.8, 4.6; P < 0.0001) (see Table 7). Overall 
improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, sex, baseline ppFEV1 geographic region, 
and genotype groups (F/Gating or F/RF).  
See Table 7 for a summary of primary and secondary outcomes in the overall trial population.  
In a subgroup analysis of patients with an F/Gating genotype, the treatment difference of 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (N = 50) compared with IVA (N = 45) for mean absolute 
change in ppFEV1 was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI: 3.5, 8.0). In a subgroup analysis of patients 
with an F/RF genotype, the treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (N = 82) 
compared with TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA (N = 81) for mean absolute change in ppFEV1 was 
2.0 percentage points (95% CI: 0.5, 3.4). The results of the F/Gating and the F/RF genotype subgroups 
for improvement in sweat chloride and CFQ-R respiratory domain score were consistent with the 
overall results.

Study 445-105 
Study 445-105 was a 192-week open-label extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
long-term treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA.Patients who rolled over from 
studies 445-102 (N=399) and 445-103 (N=107) received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. 
In study 445-105, patients from the control arms in the parent studies showed improvements in 
efficacy endpoints consistent with those observed in subjects who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in 
combination with IVA in the parent studies. Patients from the control arms as well as patients who 
received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in the parent studies, showed sustained 
improvements. Secondary efficacy endpoints are summarized in Table 8.

Study 445-107 
Study 445-107 is a 192-week, two-part (part A and part B), open-label extension study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in patients who completed study 445-
106. Efficacy endpoints were included as secondary endpoints. The analysis of Part A was conducted 
at 96 weeks in 64 paediatric patients aged 6 years and older. With 96 additional weeks of treatment, 
sustained improvements in ppFEV1, SwCl, CFQ-R RD score, and LCI2.5 were shown, consistent with 
the results observed in the study 445-106.  
Study 445-116 
In study 445-116, treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in patients aged 6 to less 
than 12 years resulted in statistically significant improvement through 24 weeks in the primary 
endpoint (LCI2.5). The LS mean treatment difference for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA 
group versus placebo for the absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 24 was -2.26 
(95% CI: -2.71, -1.81; P<0.0001). 
The European Medicines Agency has deferred the obligation to submit the results of studies with 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in one or more subset of the paediatric population in cystic 
fibrosis (see section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of ELX, TEZ and IVA are similar between healthy adult subjects and patients 
with CF. Following initiation of once-daily dosing of ELX and TEZ and twice-daily dosing of IVA, 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
plasma concentrations of ELX, TEZ and IVA reach steady state within approximately 7 days for ELX, 
within 8 days for TEZ, and within 3-5 days for IVA. Upon dosing IVA/TEZ/ELX to steady state, the 
accumulation ratio is approximately 3.6 for ELX, 2.8 for TEZ and 4.7 for IVA. Key pharmacokinetic 
parameters for ELX, TEZ and IVA at steady state in patients with CF aged 12 years and older are 
shown in Table 10.

Absorption  
The absolute bioavailability of ELX when administered orally in the fed state is approximately 80%. 
ELX is absorbed with a median (range) time to maximum concentration (tmax) of approximately 
6 hours (4 to 12 hours) while the median (range) tmax of TEZ and IVA is approximately 3 hours (2 to 
4 hours) and 4 hours (3 to 6 hours), respectively. ELX exposure (AUC) increases approximately 1.9- 
to 2.5-fold when administered with a moderate-fat meal relative to fasted conditions. IVA exposure 
increases approximately 2.5- to 4-fold when administered with fat-containing meals relative to fasted 
conditions, while food has no effect on the exposure of TEZ (see section 4.2). 
As exposures of ELX were approximately 20% lower after administration of the IVA/TEZ/ELX 
granules relative to the reference IVA/TEZ/ELX tablet, the formulations are not considered 
interchangeable. 
Distribution  
ELX is >99% bound to plasma proteins and TEZ is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, in 
both cases primarily to albumin. IVA is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to 
albumin, and also to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and human gamma-globulin. After oral administration 
of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, the mean (±SD) apparent volume of distribution of ELX, 
TEZ and IVA was 53.7 L (17.7), 82.0 L (22.3) and 293 L (89.8), respectively. ELX, TEZ and IVA do 
not partition preferentially into human red blood cells. 
Biotransformation  
ELX is metabolized extensively in humans, mainly by CYP3A4/5. Following oral administration of a 
single dose of 200 mg 14C-ELX to healthy male subjects, M23-ELX was the only major circulating 
metabolite. M23-ELX has similar potency to ELX and is considered pharmacologically active. 
TEZ is metabolized extensively in humans, mainly by CYP3A4/5. Following oral administration of a 
single dose of 100 mg 14C-TEZ to healthy male subjects, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ were the 
three major circulating metabolites of TEZ in humans. M1-TEZ has similar potency to that of TEZ 
and is considered pharmacologically active. M2-TEZ is much less pharmacologically active than TEZ 
or M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ is not considered pharmacologically active. Another minor circulating 
metabolite, M3-TEZ, is formed by direct glucuronidation of TEZ. 
IVA is also metabolized extensively in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that IVA is 
metabolized primarily by CYP3A4/5. M1-IVA and M6-IVA are the two major metabolites of IVA in 
22 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
humans. M1-IVA has approximately one-sixth the potency of IVA and is considered 
pharmacologically active. M6-IVA is not considered pharmacologically active. 
The effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on TEZ, IVA and ELX exposure is consistent 
with the effect of co-administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not clinically relevant. No 
dose-adjustment of TEZ, IVA or ELX is considered necessary. The effect in CYP3A4*22 
homozygous genotype patients is expected to be stronger. However, no data are available for such 
patients. 
Elimination  
Following multiple dosing in the fed state, the mean (±SD) apparent clearance values of ELX, TEZ 
and IVA at steady state were 1.18 (0.29) L/h, 0.79 (0.10) L/h and 10.2 (3.13) L/h, respectively. The 
mean (SD) terminal half-lives of ELX, TEZ and IVA following administration of the IVA/TEZ/ELX 
fixed-dose combination tablets are approximately 24.7 (4.87) hours, 60.3 (15.7) hours and 13.1 
(2.98) hours, respectively. The mean (SD) effective half-life of TEZ following administration of the 
IVA/TEZ/ELX fixed-dose combination tablets is 11.9 (3.79) hours. 
Following oral administration of 14C-ELX alone, the majority of ELX (87.3%) was eliminated in the 
faeces, primarily as metabolites. 
Following oral administration of 14C-TEZ alone, the majority of the dose (72%) was excreted in the 
faeces (unchanged or as the M2-TEZ) and about 14% was recovered in urine (mostly as M2-TEZ), 
resulting in a mean overall recovery of 86% up to 26 days after the dose. 
Following oral administration of 14C-IVA alone, the majority of IVA (87.8%) was eliminated in the 
faeces after metabolic conversion.  
For ELX, TEZ and IVA there was negligible urinary excretion of unchanged medicine. 
Hepatic impairment 
ELX alone or in combination with TEZ and IVA has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15). Following multiple doses of ELX, TEZ and IVA for 
10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) had an 
approximately 25% higher AUC and a 12% higher Cmax for ELX, 73% higher AUC and a 70% higher 
Cmax for M23-ELX, 20% higher AUC but similar Cmax for TEZ, 22% lower AUC and a 20% lower 
Cmax for M1-TEZ, and a 1.5-fold higher AUC and a 10% higher Cmax for IVA compared with healthy 
subjects matched for demographics. The effect of moderately impaired hepatic function on total 
exposure (based on summed values of ELX and its M23-ELX metabolite) was 36% higher AUC and a 
24% higher Cmax compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 
4.8). 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
Following multiple doses of TEZ and IVA for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic 
function had an approximately 36% higher AUC and a 10% higher Cmax for TEZ, and a 1.5-fold higher 
AUC but similar Cmax for IVA compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics.  
Ivacaftor 
In a study with IVA alone, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had similar IVA Cmax, 
but an approximately 2.0-fold higher IVA AUC0-∞ compared with healthy subjects matched for 
demographics.  
Renal impairment 
23 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ELX alone or in combination with TEZ and IVA has not been studied in patients with severe renal 
impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 mL/min] or in patients with end-
stage renal disease. 
In human pharmacokinetic studies of ELX, TEZ and IVA, there was minimal elimination of ELX, 
TEZ and IVA in urine (only 0.23%, 13.7% [0.79% as unchanged medicine] and 6.6% of total 
radioactivity, respectively). 
Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, exposure of ELX was similar in patients with 
mild renal impairment (N = 75; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min) relative to those with normal renal 
function (N = 341; eGFR 90 mL/min or greater). 
In population PK analysis conducted in 817 patients administered TEZ alone or in combination with 
IVA in phase 2 or phase 3 studies indicated that mild renal impairment (N = 172; eGFR 60 to less than 
90 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (N = 8; eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min) did not affect 
the clearance of TEZ significantly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Gender  
The pharmacokinetic parameters of ELX (244 males compared to 174 females), TEZ and IVA are 
similar in males and females.  
Race  
Race had no clinically meaningful effect on ELX exposure based on population PK analysis in whites 
(N = 373) and non-whites (N = 45). The non-white races consisted of 30 Blacks or African Americans, 
1 with multiple racial background and 14 with other ethnic background (no Asians). 
Very limited PK data indicate comparable exposure of TEZ in whites (N = 652) and non-whites 
(N = 8). The non-white races consisted of 5 Blacks or African Americans and 3 Native Hawaiians or 
other Pacific Islanders.   
Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of IVA in whites (N = 379) and non-whites 
(N = 29) based on a population PK analysis. The non-white races consisted of 27 African Americans 
and 2 Asians. 
Elderly  
Clinical trials of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA did not include sufficient number of patients 
aged 65 years and older to determine whether response in these patients is different from younger 
adults (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Paediatric population  
ELX, TEZ and IVA exposures observed in phase 3 studies as determined using population PK analysis 
are presented by age group in Table 11. Exposures of ELX, TEZ and IVA in patients aged 2 to less 
than 18 years are within the range observed in patients aged 18 years and older.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Elexacaftor  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. 
Fertility and pregnancy  
The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings was 55 mg/kg/day (2 times the 
maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite) in 
male rats and 25 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite) 
in female rats. In rat, at doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), degeneration and 
atrophy of seminiferous tubules are correlated to oligo-/aspermia and cellular debris in epididymides. 
In dog testes, minimal or mild, bilateral degeneration/atrophy of the seminiferous tubules was present 
in males administered 14 mg/kg/day ELX (15 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and 
its metabolite) that did not resolve during the recovery period, however without further sequelae. The 
human relevance of these findings is unknown. 
ELX was not teratogenic in rats at 40 mg/kg/day and at 125 mg/kg/day in rabbits (approximately 9 and 
4 times, respectively, the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite [for rat] and 
25 
 
 
 
 
 
AUC of ELX [for rabbit]) with developmental findings being limited to lower mean foetal body 
weight at ≥25 mg/kg/day. 
Placental transfer of ELX was observed in pregnant rats.  
Tezacaftor  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction and development. Placental transfer of TEZ was observed in pregnant rats. 
Juvenile toxicity studies in rats exposed during postnatal day 7 to 35 (PND 7-35) showed mortality 
and moribundity, even at low doses. Findings were dose related and generally more severe when 
dosing with tezacaftor was initiated earlier in the postnatal period. Exposure in rats from PND 21-49 
did not show toxicity at the highest dose which was approximately two times the intended human 
exposure. Tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ, are substrates for P-glycoprotein. Lower brain 
levels of P-glycoprotein activity in younger rats resulted in higher brain levels of tezacaftor and 
M1-TEZ. These findings are likely not relevant for the indicated paediatric population of 2 years of 
age and older, for whom P-glycoprotein expression levels are equivalent to levels observed in adults. 
Ivacaftor  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. 
Fertility and pregnancy  
The NOAEL for fertility findings was 100 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of 
IVA and its metabolites) in male rats and 100 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs 
of IVA and its metabolites) in female rats.  
In the pre- and post-natal study IVA decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in 
pup body weights. The NOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level of 
approximately 3 times the systemic exposure of IVA and its metabolites in adult humans at the 
MRHD. Placental transfer of IVA was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. 
Juvenile animals studies 
Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through day 35 at IVA 
exposure levels of 0.21 time the MRHD based on systemic exposure of IVA and its metabolites. This 
finding has not been observed in foetuses derived from rat dams treated with IVA on gestation days 7 
to day 17, in rat pups exposed to IVA through milk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week-old 
rats, nor in 3.5- to 5-month-old dogs treated with IVA. The potential relevance of these findings in 
humans is unknown (see section 4.4). 
Ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor  
Combination repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs involving the co-administration of ELX, 
TEZ and IVA to assess the potential for additive and/or synergistic toxicity did not produce any 
unexpected toxicities or interactions. The potential for synergistic toxicity on male reproduction has 
not been assessed.

CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Kaftrio granules are indicated in a combination regimen with ivacaftor for the treatment of cystic 
fibrosis (CF) in paediatric patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who have at least one F508del mutation 
in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene (see section 5.1). 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Kaftrio should only be prescribed by healthcare professionals with experience in the treatment of CF. 
If the patient’s genotype is unknown, an accurate and validated genotyping method should be 
performed to confirm the presence of at least one F508del mutation using a genotyping assay (see 
section 5.1). 
Monitoring of transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin is recommended for all patients prior 
to initiating treatment, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter. For 
29 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring should be 
considered (see section 4.4).

Special populations  
Hepatic impairment 
Treatment of patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh 
Class B) is not recommended. For patients aged 2 to less than 6 years with moderate hepatic 
impairment, the use of Kaftrio should only be considered when there is a clear medical need, and the 
benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used with caution at a reduced dose 
(see Table 3). 
Studies have not been conducted in patients with severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C), but 
the exposure is expected to be higher than in patients with moderate hepatic impairment. Patients with 
severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with Kaftrio. 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild (Child-Pugh Class A) hepatic impairment 
(see Table 3) (see sections 4.4, 4.8, and 5.2).

Renal impairment 
No dose adjustment is recommended for patients with mild and moderate renal impairment. There is 
no experience in patients with severe renal impairment or end-stage renal disease (see sections 4.4 
and 5.2). 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Kaftrio in combination with ivacaftor in children aged less than 2 years 
have not yet been established.  
No data are available. 
Method of administration  
For oral use. The entire contents of each sachet of granules should be mixed with one teaspoon (5 mL) 
of age-appropriate soft food or liquid and the mixture completely consumed. Food or liquid should be 
at room temperature or below. Each sachet is for single use only. Once mixed, the product has been 
shown to be stable for one hour, and therefore should be ingested during this period. Some examples 
of soft food or liquids include pureed fruits or vegetables, yogurt, water, milk, or juice. A fat-
containing meal or snack should be consumed just before or after dosing. 
Kaftrio should be taken with fat-containing food. Examples of meals or snacks that contain fat are 
those prepared with butter or oils or those containing eggs, cheeses, nuts, whole milk, or meats (see 
section 5.2). 
Food or drink containing grapefruit should be avoided during treatment with Kaftrio (see section 4.5). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance(s) or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Elevated transaminases and hepatic injury 
In a patient with cirrhosis and portal hypertension liver failure leading to transplantation has been 
reported while receiving IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with ivacaftor. IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination 
with IVA should be used with caution in patients with pre-existing advanced liver disease (e.g., 
cirrhosis, portal hypertension) and only if the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used in 
these patients, they should be closely monitored after the initiation of treatment (see sections 4.2, 4.8, 
and 5.2). 
Elevated transaminases are common in patients with CF. In clinical studies, elevated transaminases 
were more frequently observed in patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA 
32 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to placebo. In patients taking IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, these elevations 
have sometimes been associated with concomitant elevations in total bilirubin. Assessments of 
transaminases (ALT and AST) and total bilirubin are recommended for all patients prior to initiating 
treatment, every 3 months during the first year of treatment and annually thereafter (see section 4.2). 
For patients with a history of liver disease or transaminase elevations, more frequent monitoring 
should be considered. In the event of ALT or AST >5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN), or ALT or 
AST >3 x ULN with bilirubin >2 x ULN, dosing should be interrupted, and laboratory tests closely 
followed until the abnormalities resolve. Following the resolution of transaminase elevations, the 
benefits and risks of resuming treatment should be considered (see sections 4.2, 4.8, and 5.2). 
Hepatic impairment  
Treatment of patients with moderate hepatic impairment is not recommended. For patients with 
moderate hepatic impairment, the use of IVA/TEZ/ELX should only be considered when there is a 
clear medical need, and the benefits are expected to outweigh the risks. If used, it should be used with 
caution at a reduced dose (see Table 3). 
Patients with severe hepatic impairment should not be treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX (see sections 4.2, 
4.8, and 5.2). 
Depression 
Depression (including suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) has been reported in patients treated with 
IVA/TEZ/ELX, usually occurring within three months of treatment initiation and in patients with a 
history of psychiatric disorders. In some cases, symptom improvement was reported after dose 
reduction or treatment discontinuation. Patients (and caregivers) should be alerted about the need to 
monitor for depressed mood, suicidal thoughts, or unusual changes in behaviour and to seek medical 
advice immediately if these symptoms present. 
Renal impairment  
There is no experience in patients with severe renal impairment/end-stage renal disease therefore 
caution is recommended in this population (see sections 4.2 and 5.2). 
Patients after organ transplantation  
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has not been studied in patients with CF who have 
undergone organ transplantation. Therefore, use in transplanted patients is not recommended. See 
section 4.5 for interactions with commonly used immunosuppressants. 
Rash events  
The incidence of rash events was higher in females than in males, particularly in females taking 
hormonal contraceptives. A role for hormonal contraceptives in the occurrence of rash cannot be 
excluded. For patients taking hormonal contraceptives who develop rash, interrupting treatment with 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA and hormonal contraceptives should be considered. 
Following the resolution of rash, it should be considered if resuming IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination 
with IVA without hormonal contraceptives is appropriate. If rash does not recur, resumption of 
hormonal contraceptives can be considered (see section 4.8). 
Elderly population 
Clinical studies of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA did not include sufficient number of 
patients aged 65 years and older to determine whether response in these patients is different from 
younger adults. Dose recommendations are based on the pharmacokinetic profile and knowledge from 
33 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
studies with tezacaftor/ivacaftor (TEZ/IVA) in combination with ivacaftor (IVA), and ivacaftor (IVA) 
monotherapy (see sections 5.2).  
Interactions with medicinal products  
CYP3A inducers 
Exposure to IVA is significantly decreased and exposures to ELX and TEZ are expected to decrease 
by the concomitant use of CYP3A inducers, potentially resulting in the reduced efficacy of 
IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA; therefore, co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers is not 
recommended (see section 4.5). 
CYP3A inhibitors 
Exposures of ELX, TEZ and IVA are increased when co-administered with strong or moderate 
CYP3A inhibitors. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA should be adjusted when used concomitantly 
with strong or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see section 4.5 and Table 2 in section 4.2). 
Cataracts  
Cases of non-congenital lens opacities without impact on vision have been reported in paediatric 
patients treated with IVA-containing regimens. Although other risk factors were present in some cases 
(such as corticosteroid use, exposure to radiation) a possible risk attributable to treatment with IVA 
cannot be excluded. Baseline and follow-up ophthalmological examinations are recommended in 
paediatric patients initiating treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (see section 5.3). 
Excipients with known effect 
Lactose 
This medicinal product contains lactose. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose 
intolerance, total lactase deficiency or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicinal 
product. 
Sodium  
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per sachet, that is to say essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Medicinal products affecting the pharmacokinetics of ELX, TEZ and/or IVA  
CYP3A inducers 
ELX, TEZ and IVA are substrates of CYP3A (IVA is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A). Concomitant 
use of strong CYP3A inducers may result in reduced exposures and thus reduced IVA/TEZ/ELX 
efficacy. Co-administration of IVA with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A inducer, significantly decreased 
IVA area under the curve (AUC) by 89%. ELX and TEZ exposures are also expected to decrease 
during co-administration with strong CYP3A inducers; therefore, co-administration with strong 
CYP3A inducers is not recommended (see section 4.4). 
Examples of strong CYP3A inducers include: 
• 
rifampicin, rifabutin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine, phenytoin and St. John’s wort (Hypericum 
perforatum) 
CYP3A inhibitors 
Co-administration with itraconazole, a strong CYP3A inhibitor, increased ELX AUC by 2.8-fold and 
TEZ AUC by 4.0- to 4.5-fold. When co-administered with itraconazole and ketoconazole, IVA AUC 
increased by 15.6-fold and 8.5-fold, respectively. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA should be 
reduced when co-administered with strong CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 in section 4.2 and 
section 4.4). 
34 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Examples of strong CYP3A inhibitors include: 
• 
• 
ketoconazole, itraconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole 
telithromycin and clarithromycin 
Simulations indicated that co-administration with moderate CYP3A inhibitors fluconazole, 
erythromycin and verapamil, may increase ELX and TEZ AUC by approximately 1.9- to 2.3-fold. Co-
administration of fluconazole increased IVA AUC by 2.9-fold. The dose of IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA 
should be reduced when co-administered with moderate CYP3A inhibitors (see Table 2 in section 4.2 
and section 4.4). 
Examples of moderate CYP3A inhibitors include: 
• 
• 
fluconazole 
erythromycin 
Co-administration with grapefruit juice, which contains one or more components that moderately 
inhibit CYP3A, may increase exposure of ELX, TEZ and IVA. Food or drink containing grapefruit 
should be avoided during treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA (see section 4.2). 
Potential for interaction with transporters  
In vitro studies showed that ELX is a substrate for the efflux transporters P-gp and Breast Cancer 
Resistance Protein (BCRP) but is not a substrate for OATP1B1 or OATP1B3. Exposure to ELX is not 
expected to be affected significantly by concomitant use of P-gp and BCRP inhibitors due to its high 
intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact. 
In vitro studies showed that TEZ is a substrate for the uptake transporter OATP1B1 and efflux 
transporters P-gp and BCRP. TEZ is not a substrate for OATP1B3. Exposure to TEZ is not expected 
to be affected significantly by concomitant inhibitors of OATP1B1, P-gp, or BCRP due to its high 
intrinsic permeability and low likelihood of being excreted intact. However, exposure to M2-TEZ 
(TEZ metabolite) may be increased by inhibitors of P-gp. Therefore, caution should be used when P-
gp inhibitors (e.g., ciclosporin) are used with IVA/TEZ/ELX. 
In vitro studies showed that IVA is not a substrate for OATP1B1, OATP1B3, or P-gp. IVA and its 
metabolites are substrates of BCRP in vitro. Due to its high intrinsic permeability and low likelihood 
of being excreted intact, co-administration of BCRP inhibitors is not expected to alter exposure of IVA 
and M1-IVA, while any potential changes in M6-IVA exposures are not expected to be clinically 
relevant. 
Medicinal products affected by ELX, TEZ and/or IVA  
CYP2C9 substrates  
IVA may inhibit CYP2C9; therefore, monitoring of the international normalised ratio (INR) during 
co-administration of warfarin with IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA is recommended. Other medicinal 
products for which exposure may be increased include glimepiride and glipizide; these medicinal 
products should be used with caution. 
Potential for interaction with transporters 
Co-administration of IVA or TEZ/IVA with digoxin, a sensitive P-gp substrate, increased digoxin 
AUC by 1.3-fold, consistent with weak inhibition of P-gp by IVA. Administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX 
and IVA may increase systemic exposure of medicinal products that are sensitive substrates of P-gp, 
which may increase or prolong their therapeutic effect and adverse reactions. When used 
concomitantly with digoxin or other substrates of P-gp with a narrow therapeutic index such as 
ciclosporin, everolimus, sirolimus and tacrolimus, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. 
ELX and M23-ELX inhibit uptake by OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 in vitro. TEZ/IVA increased the 
AUC of pitavastatin, an OATP1B1 substrate, by 1.2-fold. Co-administration with IVA/TEZ/ELX in 
combination with IVA may increase exposures of medicinal products that are substrates of these 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
transporters, such as statins, glyburide, nateglinide and repaglinide. When used concomitantly with 
substrates of OATP1B1 or OATP1B3, caution and appropriate monitoring should be used. Bilirubin is 
an OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 substrate. In study 445-102, mild increases in mean total bilirubin were 
observed (up to 4.0 µmol/L change from baseline). This finding is consistent with the in vitro 
inhibition of bilirubin transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 by ELX and M23-ELX.  
ELX and IVA are inhibitors of BCRP. Co-administration of IVA/TEZ/ELX, and IVA may increase 
exposures of medicinal products that are substrates of BCRP, such as rosuvastatin. When used 
concomitantly with substrates of BCRP, appropriate monitoring should be used. 
Hormonal contraceptives  
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has been studied with ethinyl estradiol/levonorgestrel and 
was found to have no clinically relevant effect on the exposures of the oral contraceptive. 
IVA/TEZ/ELX and IVA is not expected to have an impact on the efficacy of oral contraceptives. 
Paediatric population  
Interaction studies have only been performed in adults. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy  
There are no or limited amount of data (less than 300 pregnancy outcomes) from the use of ELX, TEZ 
or IVA in pregnant women. Animal studies do not indicate direct or indirect harmful effects with 
respect to reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3). As a precautionary measure, it is preferable to avoid 
the use of IVA/TEZ/ELX during pregnancy. 
Breast-feeding  
Limited data show that ELX, TEZ, and IVA are excreted in human milk. A risk to the 
newborns/infants cannot be excluded. A decision must be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding 
or to discontinue/abstain from IVA/TEZ/ELX therapy taking into account the benefit of breast-feeding 
for the child and the benefit of therapy for the woman. 
Fertility  
There are no data available on the effect of ELX, TEZ and IVA on fertility in humans. TEZ had no 
effects on fertility and reproductive performance indices in male and female rats at clinically relevant 
exposures. ELX and IVA had an effect on fertility in rats (see section 5.3). 
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA has a minor influence on the ability to drive or use machines. 
Dizziness has been reported in patients receiving IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, TEZ/IVA 
in combination with IVA as well as IVA (see section 4.8). Patients experiencing dizziness should be

Description of selected adverse reactions  
Transaminase elevations 
In study 445-102, the incidence of maximum transaminase (ALT or AST) >8, >5, or >3 x the ULN 
was 1.5%, 2.5% and 7.9% in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 1.0%, 1.5% and 5.5% in 
placebo-treated patients. The incidence of adverse reactions of transaminase elevations was 10.9% in 
IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 4.0% in placebo-treated patients. 
During the open label studies, some patients discontinued treatment due to elevated transaminases. 
Post-marketing cases of treatment discontinuation due to elevated transaminases have been reported 
(see section 4.4). 
Rash events 
In study 445-102, the incidence of rash events (e.g., rash, rash pruritic) was 10.9% in 
IVA/TEZ/ELX- and 6.5% in placebo-treated patients. The rash events were generally mild to 
moderate in severity. The incidence of rash events by patient sex was 5.8% in males and 16.3% in 
females in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients and 4.8% in males and 8.3% in females in placebo-treated 
patients. In patients treated with IVA/TEZ/ELX, the incidence of rash events was 20.5% in females 
taking hormonal contraceptive and 13.6% in females not taking hormonal contraceptive (see 
section 4.4). 
Increased creatine phosphokinase  
In study 445-102, the incidence of maximum creatine phosphokinase >5 x the ULN was 10.4% in 
IVA/TEZ/ELX- and 5.0% in placebo-treated patients. The observed creatine phosphokinase elevations 
were generally transient and asymptomatic and many were preceded by exercise. No 
IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients discontinued treatment for increased creatine phosphokinase. 
Increased blood pressure 
In study 445-102, the maximum increase from baseline in mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure 
was 3.5 mmHg and 1.9 mmHg, respectively for IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients (baseline: 113 mmHg 
systolic and 69 mmHg diastolic) and 0.9 mmHg and 0.5 mmHg, respectively for placebo-treated 
patients (baseline: 114 mmHg systolic and 70 mmHg diastolic). 
The proportion of patients who had systolic blood pressure >140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure 
>90 mmHg on at least two occasions was 5.0% and 3.0%, respectively in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated 
patients compared with 3.5% and 3.5%, respectively in placebo-treated patients.

Paediatric population  
The safety data of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in studies 102, 103, 104, 106 and 111 was 
evaluated in 228 patients between 2 to less than 18 years of age. The safety profile is generally 
consistent among paediatric and adult patients. 
During study 445-106 in patients aged 6 to less than 12 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase 
(ALT or AST) >8, >5, and >3 x ULN were 0.0%, 1.5%, and 10.6%, respectively. No 
IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients had transaminase elevation >3 x ULN associated with elevated total 
bilirubin >2 x ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4). 
During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, the incidence of maximum transaminase 
(ALT or AST) >8, >5, and >3 x ULN were 1.3%, 2.7%, and 8.0% respectively. No IVA/TEZ/ELX-
treated patients had transaminase elevation >3 x ULN associated with elevated total bilirubin 
>2 x ULN or discontinued treatment due to transaminase elevations (see section 4.4). 
Rash  
During study 445-111 in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years, 15 (20.0%) subjects had at least 1 rash 
event, 4 (9.8%) females and 11 (32.4%) males. 
Lenticular opacity 
One patient had an adverse event of lenticular opacity.  
Other special populations  
With the exception of sex differences in rash, the safety profile of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with 
IVA was generally similar across all subgroups of patients, including analysis by age, baseline percent 
predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (ppFEV1) and geographic regions. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions  
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
No specific antidote is available for overdose with IVA/TEZ/ELX. Treatment of overdose consists of 
general supportive measures including monitoring of vital signs and observation of the clinical status 
of the patient.

PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1   Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Other respiratory system products, ATC code: R07AX32 
Mechanism of action  
ELX and TEZ are CFTR correctors that bind to different sites on the CFTR protein and have an 
additive effect in facilitating the cellular processing and trafficking of F508del-CFTR to increase the 
amount of CFTR protein delivered to the cell surface compared to either molecule alone. IVA 
potentiates the channel open probability (or gating) of the CFTR protein at the cell surface.  
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The combined effect of ELX, TEZ and IVA is increased quantity and function of F508del-CFTR at 
the cell surface, resulting in increased CFTR activity as measured by CFTR mediated chloride 
transport. With regard to non-F508del CFTR variants on the second allele, it is not clear whether and 
to what extent the combination of ELX, TEZ and IVA also increases the amount of these mutated 
CFTR variants on the cell surface and potentiates its channel open probability (or gating). 
Pharmacodynamic effects  
Effects on sweat chloride 
In study 445-102 (patients with an F508del mutation on one allele and a mutation on the second allele 
that predicts either no production of a CFTR protein or a CFTR protein that does not transport chloride 
and is not responsive to other CFTR modulators [IVA and TEZ/IVA] in vitro), a reduction in sweat 
chloride was observed from baseline at week 4 and sustained through the 24-week treatment period. 
The treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to placebo for mean 
absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -41.8 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -44.4, -39.3; P < 0.0001). 
In study 445-103 (patients homozygous for the F508del mutation), the treatment difference of 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA for mean 
absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline at week 4 was -45.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -50.1, -40.1; 
P < 0.0001). 
In study 445-104 (patients heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele 
with a gating defect or residual CFTR activity), the mean absolute change in sweat chloride from 
baseline through week 8 for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group was -22.3 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -24.5, -20.2; P < 0.0001). The treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with 
IVA compared to the control group (IVA group or TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA group) 
was -23.1 mmol/L (95% CI: -26.1, -20.1; P < 0.0001).  
In study 445-106 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation 
or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation), the mean absolute change 
in sweat chloride from baseline (n=62) through week 24 (n=60) was -60.9 mmol/L 
(95% CI: -63.7, -58.2)*. The mean absolute change in sweat chloride from baseline through week 12 
(n=59) was -58.6 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.1, -56.1).  
*Not all participants included in the analyses had data available for all follow-up visits, especially from 
week 16 onwards. The ability to collect data at week 24 was hampered by the COVID-19 pandemic. 
Week 12 data were less impacted by the pandemic.  
In study 445-116 (patients aged 6 to less than 12 years who are heterozygous for the F508del mutation 
and a minimal function mutation), treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA resulted in 
reduction in sweat chloride through week 24, as compared to placebo. The LS mean treatment 
difference for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group versus placebo for absolute change 
in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -51.2 mmol/L (95% CI: -55.3, -47.1; nominal 
P<0.0001).  
In study 445-111 (patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who are homozygous for the F508del mutation 
or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation), the mean absolute change 
in sweat chloride from baseline through week 24 was -57.9 mmol/L (95% CI: -61.3, -54.6).  
Cardiovascular effects 
Effect on QT interval  
At doses up to 2 times the maximum recommended dose of ELX and 3 times the maximum 
recommended dose of TEZ and IVA, the QT/QTc interval in healthy subjects was not prolonged to 
any clinically relevant extent. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Heart rate  
In study 445-102, mean decreases in heart rate of 3.7 to 5.8 beats per minute (bpm) from baseline 
(76 bpm) were observed in IVA/TEZ/ELX-treated patients. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
The efficacy of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in patients with CF was demonstrated in six 
Phase 3 studies. Patients enrolled in these studies were homozygous for the F508del mutation or 
heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation with minimal function (MF), a gating defect, or 
residual CFTR activity on the second allele. Not all F508del heterozygotes have been clinically 
evaluated with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. 
Study 445-102 was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients who 
had an F508del mutation on one allele and an MF mutation on the second allele. CF patients eligible 
for this study were required to either have Class I mutations that predicted no CFTR protein being 
produced (including nonsense mutations, canonical splice mutations and insertion/deletion frameshift 
mutations both small (≤3 nucleotide) and non-small (>3 nucleotide)), or missense mutations which 
results in CFTR protein that does not transport chloride and is not responsive to IVA and TEZ/IVA 
in vitro. The most frequent alleles with minimal function assessed in the study were G542X, W1282X, 
R553X, and R1162X; 621+1G→T, 1717-1G→A, and 1898+1G→A; 3659delC, and 394delTT; 
CFTRdele2,3; and N1303K, I507del, G85E, R347P, and R560T. A total of 403 patients aged 12 years 
and older (mean age 26.2 years) were randomised and dosed to receive placebo or IVA/TEZ/ELX in 
combination with IVA. Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean ppFEV1 at 
baseline was 61.4% (range: 32.3%, 97.1%).  
Study 445-103 was a 4-week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study in patients who were 
homozygous for the F508del mutation. A total of 107 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 
28.4 years) received TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA during a 4-week open-label run-in period and 
were then randomised and dosed to receive either IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA or 
TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA during a 4-week double-blind treatment period. Patients had a 
ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline, following the run-in period was 
60.9% (range: 35.0%, 89.0%). 
Study 445-104 was an 8-week, randomised, double-blind, active-controlled study in patients who were 
heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a mutation on the second allele with a gating defect 
(Gating) or residual CFTR activity (RF). A total of 258 patients aged 12 years and older (mean age 
37.7 years) received either IVA (F/Gating) or TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA (F/RF) during a 
4-week open-label run-in period and patients with the F/R117H genotype received IVA during the 
run-in period. Patients were then randomised and dosed to receive either IVA/TEZ/ELX in 
combination with IVA or remained on the CFTR modulator therapy received during the run-in period. 
Patients had a ppFEV1 at screening between 40-90%. The mean ppFEV1 at baseline, following the 
run-in period, was 67.6% (range: 29.7%, 113.5%). 
Study 445-106 was a 24-week open-label study in patients who were homozygous for the F508del 
mutation or heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation. A total of 66 
patients aged 6 to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.3 years) were dosed according to weight. 
Patients weighing <30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 37.5 mg/TEZ 25 mg/ELX 50 mg 
tablets in the morning and one IVA 75 mg tablet in the evening. Patients weighing ≥30 kg at baseline 
were administered two IVA 75 mg/TEZ 50 mg/ELX 100 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 
150 mg tablet in the evening. Patients had a ppFEV1 ≥40% and weighed ≥15 kg at screening. The 
mean ppFEV1 at baseline was 88.8% (range: 39.0%, 127.1%). 
Study 445-116 was a 24-week, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients aged 6 
to less than 12 years (mean age at baseline 9.2 years) who were heterozygous for the F508del mutation 
and a minimal function mutation. A total of 121 patients were randomised to receive either placebo or 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. Patients who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IVA weighing <30 kg at baseline were administered two IVA 37.5 mg/TEZ 25 mg/ELX 50 mg tablets 
in the morning and one IVA 75 mg tablet in the evening. Patients weighing ≥30 kg at baseline were 
administered two IVA 75 mg/TEZ 50 mg/ELX 100 mg tablets in the morning and one IVA 150 mg 
tablet in the evening. At screening, patients had a ppFEV1 ≥70% [mean ppFEV1 at baseline of 89.3% 
(range: 44.6%, 121.8%)], LCI2.5 result ≥7.5 [mean LCI2.5 at baseline of 10.01 (range: 6.91, 18.36)], 
and weighed ≥15 kg. 
Study 445-111 was a 24-week open-label study in patients aged 2 to less than 6 years (mean age at 
baseline 4.1 years). A total of 75 patients who are homozygous for the F508del mutation or 
heterozygous for the F508del mutation and a minimal function mutation were enrolled and dosed 
according to weight. Patients weighing 10 kg to < 14 kg at baseline were administered IVA 60 mg 
/TEZ 40 mg/ELX 80 mg once every morning and IVA 59.5 mg once every evening. Patients weighing 
≥ 14 kg at baseline were administered IVA 75 every 12 hours/TEZ 50 mg qd/ELX 100 mg qd. 
In studies 445-102, 445-103, 445-104, 445-106, and 445-111, patients in these studies continued their 
CF therapies, but discontinued any previous CFTR modulator therapies, except for study medicinal 
products. Patients who had lung infection with organisms associated with a more rapid decline in 
pulmonary status, including but not limited to Burkholderia cenocepacia, Burkholderia dolosa, or 
Mycobacterium abscessus, or who had an abnormal liver function test at screening (ALT, AST, ALP, 
or GGT ≥3 x ULN, or total bilirubin ≥2 x ULN), were excluded. In study 445-111, patients who had 
ALT or AST ≥ 2 x ULN were also excluded. 
Patients in studies 445-102 and 445-103 were eligible to roll over into a 192-week open-label 
extension study (study 445-105). Patients in studies 445-104, 445-106, 445-116, and 445-111 were 
eligible to roll over into separate open-label extension studies. 
Study 445-102 
In study 445-102 the primary endpoint was mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline through 
week 24. Treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA compared to placebo resulted in 
statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 of 14.3 percentage points (95% CI: 12.7, 15.8; 
P < 0.0001) (see Table 5). Mean improvement in ppFEV1 was observed at the first assessment on 
day 15 and sustained through the 24-week treatment period. Improvements in ppFEV1 were observed 
regardless of age, baseline ppFEV1, sex, and geographic region. 
A total of 18 patients receiving IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA had ppFEV1 <40 percentage 
points at baseline. The safety and efficacy in this subgroup were consistent to those observed in the 
overall population. The mean treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with 
IVA- compared to placebo-treated patients for absolute change in ppFEV1 through week 24 in this 
subgroup was 18.4 percentage points (95% CI: 11.5, 25.3).

Study 445-103 
In study 445-103 the primary endpoint was mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from baseline at week 4 
of the double-blind treatment period. Treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA 
compared to TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA resulted in a statistically significant improvement in

Study 445-104 
In study 445-104 the primary endpoint was within-group mean absolute change in ppFEV1 from 
baseline through week 8 for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA group. Treatment with 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA resulted in statistically significant improvement in ppFEV1 
from baseline of 3.7 percentage points (95% CI: 2.8, 4.6; P < 0.0001) (see Table 7). Overall 
improvements in ppFEV1 were observed regardless of age, sex, baseline ppFEV1 geographic region, 
and genotype groups (F/Gating or F/RF).  
See Table 7 for a summary of primary and secondary outcomes in the overall trial population.  
In a subgroup analysis of patients with an F/Gating genotype, the treatment difference of 
IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (N = 50) compared with IVA (N = 45) for mean absolute 
change in ppFEV1 was 5.8 percentage points (95% CI: 3.5, 8.0). In a subgroup analysis of patients 
with an F/RF genotype, the treatment difference of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA (N = 82) 
compared with TEZ/IVA in combination with IVA (N = 81) for mean absolute change in ppFEV1 was 
2.0 percentage points (95% CI: 0.5, 3.4). The results of the F/Gating and the F/RF genotype subgroups 
for improvement in sweat chloride and CFQ-R respiratory domain score were consistent with the 
overall results.

Study 445-105 
Study 445-105 was a 192-week open-label extension study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of 
long-term treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA. Patients who rolled over from 
studies 445-102 (N=399) and 445-103 (N=107) received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA.  
In study 445-105, patients from the control arms in the parent studies showed improvements in 
efficacy endpoints consistent with those observed in subjects who received IVA/TEZ/ELX in 
combination with IVA in the parent studies. Patients from the control arms as well as patients who 
received IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in the parent studies, showed sustained 
improvements. Secondary efficacy endpoints are summarized in Table 8.

Study 445-107 
Study 445-107 is a 192-week, two-part (part A and part B), open-label extension study to evaluate the 
safety and efficacy of long-term treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in patients who completed study 445-
106. Efficacy endpoints were included as secondary endpoints. The analysis of Part A was conducted 
at 96 weeks in 64 paediatric patients aged 6 years and older. With 96 additional weeks of treatment, 
sustained improvements in ppFEV1, SwCl, CFQ-R RD score, and LCI2.5 were shown, consistent with 
the results observed in the study 445-106.  
Study 445-116 
In study 445-116, treatment with IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA in patients aged 6 to less 
than 12 years resulted in statistically significant improvement through 24 weeks in the primary 
endpoint (LCI2.5). The LS mean treatment difference for the IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA 
group versus placebo for the absolute change in LCI2.5 from baseline through week 24 was -2.26 
(95% CI: -2.71, -1.81; P<0.0001). 
Study 445-111

5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
The pharmacokinetics of ELX, TEZ and IVA are similar between healthy adult subjects and patients 
with CF. Following initiation of once-daily dosing of ELX and TEZ and twice-daily dosing of IVA, 
plasma concentrations of ELX, TEZ and IVA reach steady state within approximately 7 days for ELX, 
within 8 days for TEZ, and within 3-5 days for IVA. Upon dosing IVA/TEZ/ELX to steady state, the 
accumulation ratio is approximately 3.6 for ELX, 2.8 for TEZ and 4.7 for IVA. Key pharmacokinetic 
parameters for ELX, TEZ and IVA at steady state in patients with CF aged 12 years and older are 
shown in Table 11.

Absorption  
The absolute bioavailability of ELX when administered orally in the fed state is approximately 80%. 
ELX is absorbed with a median (range) time to maximum concentration (tmax) of approximately 
6 hours (4 to 12 hours) while the median (range) tmax of TEZ and IVA is approximately 3 hours (2 to 
4 hours) and 4 hours (3 to 6 hours), respectively. ELX exposure (AUC) increases approximately 1.9- 
to 2.5-fold when administered with a moderate-fat meal relative to fasted conditions. IVA exposure 
increases approximately 2.5- to 4-fold when administered with fat-containing meals relative to fasted 
conditions, while food has no effect on the exposure of TEZ (see section 4.2). 
As exposures of ELX were approximately 20% lower after administration of the IVA/TEZ/ELX 
granules relative to the reference IVA/TEZ/ELX tablet, the formulations are not considered 
interchangeable. 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Distribution  
ELX is >99% bound to plasma proteins and TEZ is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, in 
both cases primarily to albumin. IVA is approximately 99% bound to plasma proteins, primarily to 
albumin, and also to alpha 1-acid glycoprotein and human gamma-globulin. After oral administration 
of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA, the mean (±SD) apparent volume of distribution of ELX, 
TEZ and IVA was 53.7 L (17.7), 82.0 L (22.3) and 293 L (89.8), respectively. ELX, TEZ and IVA do 
not partition preferentially into human red blood cells. 
Biotransformation  
ELX is metabolized extensively in humans, mainly by CYP3A4/5. Following oral administration of a 
single dose of 200 mg 14C-ELX to healthy male subjects, M23-ELX was the only major circulating 
metabolite. M23-ELX has similar potency to ELX and is considered pharmacologically active. 
TEZ is metabolized extensively in humans, mainly by CYP3A4/5. Following oral administration of a 
single dose of 100 mg 14C-TEZ to healthy male subjects, M1-TEZ, M2-TEZ and M5-TEZ were the 
three major circulating metabolites of TEZ in humans. M1-TEZ has similar potency to that of TEZ 
and is considered pharmacologically active. M2-TEZ is much less pharmacologically active than TEZ 
or M1-TEZ and M5-TEZ is not considered pharmacologically active. Another minor circulating 
metabolite, M3-TEZ, is formed by direct glucuronidation of TEZ. 
IVA is also metabolized extensively in humans. In vitro and in vivo data indicate that IVA is 
metabolized primarily by CYP3A4/5. M1-IVA and M6-IVA are the two major metabolites of IVA in 
humans. M1-IVA has approximately one-sixth the potency of IVA and is considered 
pharmacologically active. M6-IVA is not considered pharmacologically active. 
The effect of the CYP3A4*22 heterozygous genotype on TEZ, IVA and ELX exposure is consistent 
with the effect of co-administration of a weak CYP3A4 inhibitor, which is not clinically relevant. No 
dose-adjustment of TEZ, IVA or ELX is considered necessary. The effect in CYP3A4*22 
homozygous genotype patients is expected to be stronger. However, no data are available for such 
patients. 
Elimination  
Following multiple dosing in the fed state, the mean (±SD) apparent clearance values of ELX, TEZ 
and IVA at steady state were 1.18 (0.29) L/h, 0.79 (0.10) L/h and 10.2 (3.13) L/h, respectively. The 
mean (SD) terminal half-lives of ELX, TEZ and IVA following administration of the IVA/TEZ/ELX 
fixed-dose combination tablets are approximately 24.7 (4.87) hours, 60.3 (15.7) hours and 13.1 
(2.98) hours, respectively. The mean (SD) effective half-life of TEZ following administration of the 
IVA/TEZ/ELX fixed-dose combination tablets is 11.9 (3.79) hours. 
Following oral administration of 14C-ELX alone, the majority of ELX (87.3%) was eliminated in the 
faeces, primarily as metabolites. 
Following oral administration of 14C-TEZ alone, the majority of the dose (72%) was excreted in the 
faeces (unchanged or as the M2-TEZ) and about 14% was recovered in urine (mostly as M2-TEZ), 
resulting in a mean overall recovery of 86% up to 26 days after the dose. 
Following oral administration of 14C-IVA alone, the majority of IVA (87.8%) was eliminated in the 
faeces after metabolic conversion.  
For ELX, TEZ and IVA there was negligible urinary excretion of unchanged medicine.

Hepatic impairment 
ELX alone or in combination with TEZ and IVA has not been studied in subjects with severe hepatic 
impairment (Child-Pugh Class C, score 10-15). Following multiple doses of ELX, TEZ and IVA for 
10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function (Child-Pugh Class B, score 7-9) had an 
approximately 25% higher AUC and a 12% higher Cmax for ELX, 73% higher AUC and a 70% higher 
Cmax for M23-ELX, 20% higher AUC but similar Cmax for TEZ, 22% lower AUC and a 20% lower 
Cmax for M1-TEZ, and a 1.5-fold higher AUC and a 10% higher Cmax for IVA compared with healthy 
subjects matched for demographics. The effect of moderately impaired hepatic function on total 
exposure (based on summed values of ELX and its M23-ELX metabolite) was 36% higher AUC and a 
24% higher Cmax compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics (see sections 4.2, 4.4, and 
4.8). 
Tezacaftor and ivacaftor 
Following multiple doses of TEZ and IVA for 10 days, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic 
function had an approximately 36% higher AUC and a 10% higher Cmax for TEZ, and a 1.5-fold higher 
AUC but similar Cmax for IVA compared with healthy subjects matched for demographics.  
Ivacaftor 
In a study with IVA alone, subjects with moderately impaired hepatic function had similar IVA Cmax, 
but an approximately 2.0-fold higher IVA AUC0-∞ compared with healthy subjects matched for 
demographics.  
Renal impairment 
ELX alone or in combination with TEZ and IVA has not been studied in patients with severe renal 
impairment [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) less than 30 mL/min] or in patients with end-
stage renal disease. 
In human pharmacokinetic studies of ELX, TEZ and IVA, there was minimal elimination of ELX, 
TEZ and IVA in urine (only 0.23%, 13.7% [0.79% as unchanged medicine] and 6.6% of total 
radioactivity, respectively). 
Based on population pharmacokinetic (PK) analysis, exposure of ELX was similar in patients with 
mild renal impairment (N = 75; eGFR 60 to less than 90 mL/min) relative to those with normal renal 
function (N = 341; eGFR 90 mL/min or greater). 
In population PK analysis conducted in 817 patients administered TEZ alone or in combination with 
IVA in phase 2 or phase 3 studies indicated that mild renal impairment (N = 172; eGFR 60 to less than 
90 mL/min) and moderate renal impairment (N = 8; eGFR 30 to less than 60 mL/min) did not affect 
the clearance of TEZ significantly (see sections 4.2 and 4.4). 
Gender  
The pharmacokinetic parameters of ELX (244 males compared to 174 females), TEZ and IVA are 
similar in males and females.  
Race  
Race had no clinically meaningful effect on ELX exposure based on population PK analysis in whites 
(N = 373) and non-whites (N = 45). The non-white races consisted of 30 Blacks or African Americans, 
1 with multiple racial background and 14 with other ethnic background (no Asians). 
Very limited PK data indicate comparable exposure of TEZ in whites (N = 652) and non-whites 
(N = 8). The non-white races consisted of 5 Blacks or African Americans and 3 Native Hawaiians or 
other Pacific Islanders.   
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Race had no clinically meaningful effect on the PK of IVA in whites (N = 379) and non-whites 
(N = 29) based on a population PK analysis. The non-white races consisted of 27 African Americans 
and 2 Asians. 
Elderly  
Clinical trials of IVA/TEZ/ELX in combination with IVA did not include sufficient number of patients 
aged 65 years and older to determine whether response in these patients is different from younger 
adults (see sections 4.4). 
Paediatric population  
ELX, TEZ and IVA exposures observed in phase 3 studies as determined using population PK analysis 
are presented by age group in Table 12. Exposures of ELX, TEZ and IVA in patients aged 2 to less 
than 18 years are within the range observed in patients aged 18 years and older.

5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Elexacaftor  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. 
Fertility and pregnancy  
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The No Observed Adverse Effect Level (NOAEL) for fertility findings was 55 mg/kg/day (2 times the 
maximum recommended human dose (MRHD) based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite) in 
male rats and 25 mg/kg/day (4 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite) 
in female rats. In rat, at doses exceeding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), degeneration and 
atrophy of seminiferous tubules are correlated to oligo-/aspermia and cellular debris in epididymides. 
In dog testes, minimal or mild, bilateral degeneration/atrophy of the seminiferous tubules was present 
in males administered 14 mg/kg/day ELX (15 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and 
its metabolite) that did not resolve during the recovery period, however without further sequelae. The 
human relevance of these findings is unknown. 
ELX was not teratogenic in rats at 40 mg/kg/day and at 125 mg/kg/day in rabbits (approximately 9 and 
4 times, respectively, the MRHD based on summed AUCs of ELX and its metabolite [for rat] and 
AUC of ELX [for rabbit]) with developmental findings being limited to lower mean foetal body 
weight at ≥25 mg/kg/day. 
Placental transfer of ELX was observed in pregnant rats.  
Tezacaftor  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, and toxicity to 
reproduction and development. Placental transfer of TEZ was observed in pregnant rats. 
Juvenile toxicity studies in rats exposed during postnatal day 7 to 35 (PND 7-35) showed mortality 
and moribundity, even at low doses. Findings were dose related and generally more severe when 
dosing with tezacaftor was initiated earlier in the postnatal period. Exposure in rats from PND 21-49 
did not show toxicity at the highest dose which was approximately two times the intended human 
exposure. Tezacaftor and its metabolite, M1-TEZ, are substrates for P-glycoprotein. Lower brain 
levels of P-glycoprotein activity in younger rats resulted in higher brain levels of tezacaftor and 
M1-TEZ. These findings are likely not relevant for the indicated paediatric population of 2 years of 
age and older, for whom P-glycoprotein expression levels are equivalent to levels observed in adults. 
Ivacaftor  
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, and carcinogenic potential. 
Fertility and pregnancy  
The NOAEL for fertility findings was 100 mg/kg/day (5 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs of 
IVA and its metabolites) in male rats and 100 mg/kg/day (3 times the MRHD based on summed AUCs 
of IVA and its metabolites) in female rats.  
In the pre- and post-natal study IVA decreased survival and lactation indices and caused a reduction in 
pup body weights. The NOAEL for viability and growth in the offspring provides an exposure level of 
approximately 3 times the systemic exposure of IVA and its metabolites in adult humans at the 
MRHD. Placental transfer of IVA was observed in pregnant rats and rabbits. 
Juvenile animals studies 
Findings of cataracts were observed in juvenile rats dosed from postnatal day 7 through day 35 at IVA 
exposure levels of 0.21 time the MRHD based on systemic exposure of IVA and its metabolites. This 
finding has not been observed in foetuses derived from rat dams treated with IVA on gestation days 7 
to day 17, in rat pups exposed to IVA through milk ingestion up to postnatal day 20, in 7-week-old 
rats, nor in 3.5- to 5-month-old dogs treated with IVA. The potential relevance of these findings in 
humans is unknown (see section 4.4). 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
Ivacaftor/tezacaftor/elexacaftor  
Combination repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats and dogs involving the co-administration of ELX, 
TEZ and IVA to assess the potential for additive and/or synergistic toxicity did not produce any 
unexpected toxicities or interactions. The potential for synergistic toxicity on male reproduction has 
not been assessed.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Kaftrio is and what it is used for 
Kaftrio contains three active substances: ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor. The medicine helps 
lung cells to work better in some patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an inherited condition in 
which the lungs and the digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. 
Kaftrio taken with ivacaftor is for patients aged 6 years and over who have CF, with at least one 
F508del mutation in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. Kaftrio 
is intended as a long-term treatment. 
Kaftrio works on a protein called CFTR. The protein is damaged in some people with CF, if they have 
a mutation in the CFTR gene. 
Kaftrio is normally taken with another medicine, ivacaftor. Ivacaftor causes the protein to work 
better, while tezacaftor and elexacaftor increase the amount of protein at the cell surface. 
Kaftrio (taken with ivacaftor) helps your breathing by improving your lung function. You may also 
notice that you do not get ill as often, or that it is easier to gain weight. 
2.  What you need to know before you take Kaftrio 
Do not take Kaftrio: 
• 
If you are allergic to ivacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor, or any other ingredients of this medicine 
(listed in section 6). 
Talk to your doctor and do not take the tablets, if this applies to you. 
81 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Warnings and precautions 
• 
Talk to your doctor if you have liver problems, or have had them previously. Your doctor 
may need to adjust your dose. 
• 
Your doctor will do some blood tests to check your liver before and during treatment with 
Kaftrio, especially if your blood tests showed high liver enzymes in the past. Liver enzymes in 
the blood can increase in patients receiving Kaftrio. 
Tell your doctor right away if you have any symptoms of liver problems. These are listed in 
section 4. 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Depression (including suicidal thoughts and behaviours) has been reported in patients while 
taking Kaftrio, usually starting within the first three months of treatment. Talk to your doctor 
straight away if you (or someone taking this medicine) experience any of the following 
symptoms which may be signs of depression: sad or altered mood, anxiety, feelings of emotional 
discomfort or thoughts of harming or killing yourself. 
Talk to your doctor if you have kidney problems, or you have previously had them. 
Talk to your doctor before starting treatment with Kaftrio if you have received an organ 
transplant. 
Talk to your doctor if you are using hormonal contraception – for example, women using the 
contraceptive pill. This may mean you are more likely to get a rash while taking Kaftrio.   
Your doctor may do eye examinations before and during treatment with Kaftrio. Cloudiness 
of the eye lens (cataract) without any effect on vision has occurred in some children and 
adolescents receiving this treatment. 
Children under 6 
Do not give this medicine to children under the age of 6 years because it is not known if Kaftrio tablets 
are safe and effective in this age group. 
• 
Other medicines and Kaftrio 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken, or might take any other 
medicines. Some medicines can affect how Kaftrio works or may make side effects more likely. In 
particular, tell your doctor if you take any of the medicines listed below. Your doctor may change the 
dose of one of the medicines if you take any of these. 
• 
Antifungal medicines (used for the treatment of fungal infections). These include fluconazole, 
itraconazole, ketoconazole, posaconazole and voriconazole.

Kaftrio with food and drink 
Avoid food or drinks containing grapefruit during treatment as these may increase the side effects of 
Kaftrio by increasing the amount of Kaftrio in your body. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
•  Ask your doctor for advice before taking this medicine if you are pregnant or breast-feeding, 
think you may be pregnant or are planning to have a baby.  
•  Pregnancy: It may be better to avoid using this medicine during pregnancy. Your doctor will 
help you decide what is best for you and your child. 
•  Breast-feeding: Ivacaftor, tezacaftor, and elexacaftor pass into breast milk. Your doctor will 
consider the benefit of breast-feeding for your baby and the benefit of treatment for you to 
help you decide whether to stop breast-feeding or to stop treatment. 
Driving and using machines 
Kaftrio can make you dizzy. If you feel dizzy, do not drive, cycle, or use machines unless you are not 
affected. 
Kaftrio contains sodium 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol sodium (23 mg) per dose, that is to say essentially 
“sodium-free”.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Kaftrio is and what it is used for 
Kaftrio contains three active substances: ivacaftor, tezacaftor and elexacaftor. The medicine helps 
lung cells to work better in some patients with cystic fibrosis (CF). CF is an inherited condition in 
which the lungs and the digestive system can become clogged with thick, sticky mucus. 
Kaftrio taken with ivacaftor is for patients aged 2 to less than 6 years who have CF, with at least 
one F508del mutation in the CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) gene. 
Kaftrio is intended as a long-term treatment. 
Kaftrio works on a protein called CFTR. The protein is damaged in some people with CF, if they have 
a mutation in the CFTR gene. 
Kaftrio is normally taken with another medicine, ivacaftor. Ivacaftor causes the protein to work 
better, while tezacaftor and elexacaftor increase the amount of protein at the cell surface. 
Kaftrio (taken with ivacaftor) helps your child’s breathing by improving his/her lung function. You 
may also notice that your child does not get ill as often, or that it is easier for your child to gain 
weight. 
2.  What you need to know before your child takes Kaftrio

• 
If your child is allergic to ivacaftor, tezacaftor, elexacaftor, or any other ingredients of this 
medicine (listed in section 6).

Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ivacaftor / tezacaftor / 
elexacaftor, the scientific conclusions of PRAC are as follows:  
At its November plenary meeting, PRAC has recommended to update the wording on breastfeeding 
in the PSUSA procedures for ivacaftor monocomponent and ivacaftor/tezacaftor combination in 
order to reflect the available data. As Kaftrio contains the above substances the same update applies 
to the triple combinations as well. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall 
conclusions and grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ivacaftor / tezacaftor / elexacaftor the CHMP is of the 
opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ivacaftor / tezacaftor / 
elexacaftor is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

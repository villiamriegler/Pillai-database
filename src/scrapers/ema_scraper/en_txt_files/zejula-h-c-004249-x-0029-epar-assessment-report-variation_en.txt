2.  Scientific discussion  
2.1.  Problem statement  
This is a line extension application to the marketing authorisation of Zejula 100 mg hard capsules 
(EU/1/17/1235/001-003) to add a new pharmaceutical form, Zejula 100 mg film-coated tablet. Strength 
(100 mg), dosing and indication are the same as for the previously approved hard capsules. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition  
Zejula 100 mg film-coated tablet has been developed as a line extension (new formulation) to the reference 
product Zejula 100 mg hard capsule, and is intended to be used in the same indications as the capsule. 
Zejula is indicated:  
• 
• 
as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages 
III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response 
(complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high 
grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response 
(complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Ovarian cancer is the fifth overall cause of cancer death in women, representing 5% of all cancer deaths. It is 
also the deadliest of gynaecologic cancers in 2014, 14,270 women in the United States (US) and 18,303 in 
the European Union (EU) died from ovarian cancer. Across Europe, the estimated age standardised rate of 
newly diagnosed ovarian cancer cases in 2020 is 15.5/100,000 and the mortality is 10.3/100,000 (ECIS 
2020). 
2.1.3.  Biologic features  
Epithelial ovarian cancer represents the majority of malignant ovarian neoplasm (about 90%) (Chan JK et al 
2006; Jelovac D et al. 2011). The World Health Organization (WHO) classification of surface epithelial ovarian 
tumours includes six major histotypes - serous, mucinous, endometrioid, clear cell, transitional cell and 
epithelial-stromal. The serous subtype of ovarian carcinoma accounts for approximately 60-80% of ovarian 
cancer cases and is the most aggressive type of ovarian cancer. Grade is an additional prognostic 
determinant and a number of grading systems currently exist which are derived from reviewing the following 
tumour characteristics: architectural features, mitotic counts and nuclear atypia (ESMO Clinical Practice 
Guidelines, 2013). Low grade (grade 1, well differentiated) serous ovarian carcinoma is considered a distinct 
type of disease compared with high grade (grade 2 and 3 – moderately and poorly differentiated) serous 
carcinoma based on a number of clinical and molecular features, thus forming a 2 tier classification of low 
and high grade disease widely accepted and used in clinical practice (Levanon et al 2008; Vang et al 2009). 
Breast cancer genes (BRCA) 1 and 2 are tumour suppressors that play a role in DNA repair: a deleterious  
Assessment report  
EMA/294945/2022 
Page 8/29 
 
 
 
mutation in BRCA leads to an inability to repair DNA via the homologous recombination pathway. 
Approximately 15%-22% of ovarian cancer patients have germline or somatic BRCA mutations (Alsop et al. 
2012, Cancer Genome Atlas Research N 2011, Hennessy et al. 2010, Pal et al. 2010, Pennington et al. 2014).  
Recent research shows that homologous recombination deficiency can also be induced by other genes 
involved in DNA damage repair or by genetic alterations such as DNA methylation that lead to genomic 
instability. Approximately 41% to 50% of newly diagnosed ovarian carcinomas are estimated to exhibit 
homologous recombination deficiency (Elvin et al. 2017, Moschetta et al. 2016) which is also a phenotype 
that predicts improved rate of responses to platinum-based therapy and PARP inhibitors relative to tumours 
that are homologous recombination proficient (Kaufman et al. 2015). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis  
Ovarian cancer is often asymptomatic in the early stages and is, therefore, first detected in advanced stages, 
when prognosis is poor. For women who do experience symptoms in the early stages, ovarian cancer is 
sometimes misdiagnosed because the majority of symptoms are nonspecific. These symptoms may overlap 
those of gastrointestinal and other diseases, and as a result, many patients may be treated incorrectly for 
months or years. The advanced stage at which ovarian cancer is generally detected is reflected in the 5-year 
survival rates; 46% across all stages and 29% for advanced stages (Siegel et al 2017). 
2.1.5.  Management  
The paradigm for first-line treatment of newly diagnosed ovarian cancer includes a combination of surgery 
and chemotherapy: either primary debulking surgery (PDS) followed by adjuvant chemotherapy or 
neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) with subsequent interval debulking surgery (IDS) followed by additional 
chemotherapy. Worldwide, the use of NACT is increasing in patients with large volume Stage IIIC/IV disease, 
such that 45-60% of these patients will receive NACT (Epi Flatiron Database EMR Database 2019, Liu et al. 
2017, Vergote et al. 2010, Monitor IHGO 2019, Nicklin et al. 2017). The preferred standard of care 
chemotherapy regimen is carboplatin and paclitaxel, based upon an improved toxicity profile and comparable 
efficacy when compared to cisplatin and paclitaxel (Ozol et al. 2003, duBois et al. 2005).  
Bevacizumab is an additional option for first line treatment. The addition of bevacizumab to every-3-week 
paclitaxel and carboplatin, followed by continuation of maintenance for up to 15 cycles with bevacizumab 
improved PFS over placebo in the Phase 3 GOG 218 study (PFS hazard ratio [HR] 0.62) and in the high-risk 
population subgroup, as defined by Stage and residual disease, in the open-label Phase 3 ICON 7 study (PFS 
HR 0.68) (Burger et al. 2003, Perren et al. 2011). However, bevacizumab provided no overall survival benefit 
in the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) population in either study.  
Olaparib, a PARP inhibitor, was approved for use as a maintenance treatment in patients with ovarian cancer 
and a mutation in the breast cancer susceptibility gene (BRCAmut) following complete response (CR) or 
partial response (PR) to first line platinum based chemotherapy based on an improvement in PFS over 
placebo (HR 0.30; [OS data is not yet available]) in study SOLO-1 (see SmPC Lynparza).  
Data were recently reported from the Phase 3 PAOLA trial, which assessed the combination of bevacizumab 
plus olaparib versus bevacizumab in the ovarian cancer front line setting. Clinical benefit of the combination 
was observed in patients with homologous recombination deficiency (HR 0.33) but not in the remaining 
population (HR 0.92) (Ray-Coquard et al., paper presented at European Society for Medical Oncology 2019).

Observation, or “watch and wait” after response to first line therapy is included in the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), European Society for Medical Oncology, and American Society of 
Assessment report EMA/531223/2020 Page 12/168 Clinical Oncology guidelines and is the approach currently 
taken for the majority (>75%) of patients with advanced ovarian cancer (Epi Flatiron Database EMR 
Database 2019, Liu et al. 2017, Colombo et al. 2019).  
Despite high response rates to first line standard-of-care platinum-based chemotherapy, 85% of patients 
with advanced ovarian cancer will experience disease recurrence and ultimately die of the disease. Prolonging 
the benefit of first line platinum is currently the best chance these patients have to avoid recurrence and 
potentially improve survival outcomes. Development of new therapies is essential to address the unmet 
medical need and improve the overall outlook for patients with this lethal cancer (Lorusso et al. 2012). 
2.2.  About the product  
Niraparib is an orally available, highly selective poly(adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP) -1 
and -2 inhibitor exhibiting potent anti-tumour activity through the direct inhibition of PARP. 
Zejula (niraparib) is indicated:  
• 
• 
as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with advanced epithelial (FIGO Stages 
III and IV) high-grade ovarian, fallopian tube or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response 
(complete or partial) following completion of first-line platinum-based chemotherapy. 
as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed high 
grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer who are in response 
(complete or partial) to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
In first-line ovarian cancer maintenance treatment, the recommended starting dose of Zejula is 200 mg (two 
100-mg tablets), taken once daily. However, for those patients who weigh ≥ 77 kg and have baseline platelet 
count ≥ 150,000/μL, the recommended starting dose of Zejula is 300 mg (three 100-mg tablets), taken once 
daily (see section 4.4 and 4.8). 
In recurrent ovarian cancer maintenance treatment, the dose is three 100 mg tablets once daily, equivalent 
to a total daily dose of 300 mg. 
2.3.  Type of Application and aspects on development  
This is a line extension application to the marketing authorisation of Zejula 100 mg hard capsules 
(EU/1/17/1235/001-003) to add a new pharmaceutical form, Zejula 100 mg film-coated tablet. 
2.4.  Quality aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction  
This is a line extension application to the marketing authorisation of Zejula 100 mg hard capsules 
(EU/1/17/1235/001-003) to add a new pharmaceutical form, Zejula 100 mg film-coated tablet. The strength 
of the film-coated tablets, dosing and indication are the same as for the previously approved hard capsules. 
The finished product is presented as film-coated tablets containing niraparib tosylate monohydrate equivalent 
to 100 mg niraparib as active substance. 
Assessment report  
EMA/294945/2022

Other ingredients of the tablet core are: crospovidone, lactose monohydrate, magnesium stearate, 
microcrystalline cellulose (E 460), povidone (E 1201), silica colloidal hydrated. Ingredients of the film coating 
are: polyvinyl alcohol (E 1203), titanium dioxide (E 171), macrogol (E 1521), talc (E 553b) and iron oxide 
black (E 172). 
The product is available in OPA/aluminium/PVC/aluminium/vinyl/acrylic blister, as described in section 6.5 of 
the SmPC. 
2.4.2.  Active Substance  
The active substance documentation is identical to that of the previously approved capsule formulation and is 
acceptable.  
Physico-chemical properties of the active substance that are relevant for the new tablet formulation have 
been adequately addressed in the pharmaceutical development of the finished product. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product  
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development  
Niraparib Tablets, 100 mg, are immediate release, grey, oval-shaped (12 mm x 8 mm), film coated tablets, 
debossed with “100” on one side and “Zejula” on the other side. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur 
standards, except iron oxide, which complies with the purity criteria concerning colours for use in foodstuffs, 
CD/231/2012/EC. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of 
excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.4.3 of this report. 
The discriminating ability of the method was assessed by manufacturing and testing batches with intentional 
variations in different material attributes or process parameters which could impact dissolution performance. 
The discriminatory power of the dissolution method has been demonstrated. 
The primary packaging is OPA/aluminium/PVC/aluminium/vinyl/acrylic blister. The material complies with 
Ph.Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been validated by stability data 
and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls  
The  process  is  considered  to  be  a  standard  manufacturing  process  and  includes  blending,  granulation, 
compression and film coating. 
As the process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process, major steps of the manufacturing 
process will be validated in line with provided validation protocol, which was found acceptable. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: description 
(visual), identification (FT-IR, HPLC), identification of tosylate ion (HPLC), assay (HPLC), degradation products 
Assessment report  
EMA/294945/2022 
Page 11/29 
 
 
(HPLC), uniformity of dosage units (HPLC), dissolution (HPLC), water content (KF) and microbial enumeration 
(Ph. Eur.). 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment it 
can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls in the finished product 
specification. The information on the control of elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has 
been performed considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions and answers for 
marketing authorisation holders/applicants on the CHMP Opinion for the Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004 referral on nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products” (EMA/409815/2020) and the 
“Assessment report- Procedure under Article 5(3) of Regulation EC (No) 726/2004- Nitrosamine impurities in 
human medicinal products” (EMA/369136/2020). Based on the information provided, it is accepted that there 
is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or the related finished product. Therefore, no 
specific control measures are deemed necessary. 
Based on the data presented, niraparib tablets possess very low risk of microbial contamination. Utilizing ICH 
Q6A decision tree # 8, microbial testing of commercial lots of Zejula 100 mg film-coated tablets during 
routine release testing is not considered necessary. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided on two pilot scale batches and six commercial scale batches confirming 
the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product  
Stability data from three reduced scale batches of the finished product stored for up to 24 months under long 
term  conditions  (25  ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  for  up  to 6 months  under  accelerated  conditions  (40  ºC  /  75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of medicinal product are representative to those 
proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples  were  tested  for  description,  assay,  degradation  products,  dissolution,  water  content  and  microbial 
enumeration. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating. 
No significant changes nor trends have been observed during long term and accelerated conditions. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. The results demonstrate that the finished product is not light-sensitive. 
The stability evaluation of the tablets also includes studies under stress conditions. The stress studies 
involving storage under frozen conditions, freeze-thaw cycles, high humidity conditions (open dish). The data 
demonstrate that the finished product must be stored in their original container to protect the tablets from 
absorption of water under high humidity conditions. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 36 months and storage conditions store in the 
original package as stated in the SmPC (sections 6.3 & 6.4) are acceptable.

2.4.3.5.  Adventitious agents  
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as those 
used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the use of 
ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the Risk of 
Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal products. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should 
have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give 
reassurance on TSE safety. 
2.4.6.  Recommendations for future quality development  
Not applicable. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects  
No non-clinical data were submitted, This was considered acceptable as the current line extension is only 
introducing a new tablet formulation. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment studies were submitted. This is justified as the introduction of a new table 
formulation is not considered to result in any increase in the exposure of the environment to the active 
substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects  
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Both stages of the study consisted of a Screening Period (Day -21 to Day -1), a PK Phase (Study Drug and 
Washout/PK Period 1 and Study Drug and PK Period 2), an End of Treatment (EOT) Visit, and a Safety 
Follow-up Visit. When patients completed the PK Phase of the study (at least 7 days after the beginning of PK 
Period 2), they were eligible to participate in an Extension Phase prior to the EOT and Safety Follow-up Visits, 
following review of the Extension Phase inclusion criteria and completion of the required screening 
assessments. 
Blood was collected during the study for PK assessments at the following time points relative to niraparib 
dosing:  
Stage 1: predose (30 minutes prior to dosing) and at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 
168 hours postdose.  
Stage 2: predose (30 minutes prior to dosing) and at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 12, 24, 48, 72, 96, 120, and 
168 hours postdose. 
29 Patients with Advanced Solid Tumours were randomized in Stage 1 (for BA evaluation). In stage 2 
(demonstrating bioequivalence), 179 patients were randomized. 
•  Test and reference products  
Stage 1: The 100 mg capsules were bulk lot number 1703037, expiry date 31.03.2020. The 300 mg tablets 
were bulk lot number KH17/0077 (pilot scale batch), expiry date 28.02.2019. 
Stage 2: The 100 mg capsules were obtained from bulk lot numbers 1801021, 1808201 or M10642, expiry 
date ranging from February to July 2021. The 300 mg tablets were bulk lot numbers M10723, M10740 or

M10795 (production scale batches), expiry date ranging from May to July 2020. 
•  Population(s) studied 
29 Patients with Advanced Solid Tumors were randomized in Stage 1, and received either a single oral dose 
of 300 mg niraparib as three 100 mg capsules or one 300 mg tablet. All the patients completed the stage 1 
phase, however 23 patients (10 + 13) were included in the BA evaluable population. 5 of the 6 patients who 
were excluded from the BA evaluable population due to predose level >5% of Cmax in period 2 received the 
tablet in the first period and then the capsule. 
In stage 2, 179 patients with Advanced Solid Tumors were randomized, and received either a single oral dose 
of 300 mg niraparib as three 100 mg capsules or one 300 mg tablet. 130 patients completed the PK phase. 
The number of discontinued patients was comparable in the two treatment groups. 
Another 30 patients were excluded from the BE evaluable population: Patients with clinical events resulting in 
a high probability of the patients’ data being unevaluable for at least 1 parameter in PK Period 1 or 2 were 
allowed to go into the safety Extension Phase of the study without completing the remainder of the PK phase. 
The following population was defined for the safety analysis: 
•  All patients who received any amount of niraparib during the PK Phase of the study. 
The following populations were defined for the PK analysis of niraparib (PK Analysis Plan): 
• 
• 
PK Population: All patients who received at least 1 dose of niraparib and have at least 1 measurable 
concentration. 
PK Evaluable Population: All patients who completed at least 1 Study Drug and Washout/PK Period 
and had sufficient concentration data to accurately estimate PK parameters without significant 
niraparib carryover (baseline concentration >5% of Cmax) in at least 1 Period. Patients with carryover 
were excluded from the analysis of PK Period 2, but were included in the analysis of PK Period 1, as 
data were available. 
•  BA Evaluable Population (stage 1)/ BE Evaluable Population (stage 2): All patients who completed 
both Study Drug and Washout/PK Periods and had sufficient PK sample collection to accurately 
estimate PK parameters, without significant niraparib carryover (baseline concentration >5% of Cmax) 
in both PK Periods. Patients who had significant niraparib carryover from PK Period 1 in PK Period 2 
were completely excluded from the BA Evaluable Population. 
The following populations were defined for the Stage 1 PK analysis of M1: 
•  M1 PK Population: All patients who received at least 1 dose of niraparib and had at least 1 
measurable M1 concentration. 
•  M1 PK Evaluable Population: All patients who completed at least 1 Study Drug and Washout/PK 
Period and had sufficient M1 concentration data to accurately estimate PK parameters. 
•  Analytical methods 
The two stages of the study used two test analytical methods (BAC-KB-L010 and BAC-KB-L012). Both 
methods are used to measure niraparib and M1 metabolite in human plasma (K3EDTA) by LC-MS/MS. 
Assessment report  
EMA/294945/2022 
Page 16/29 
 
 
 
Analytes are extracted from the human plasma by protein precipitation, subsequently separated 
chromatographically and detected by the respective mass transitions in MRM scan mode. 
Validation of both bioassays (reports KB-0044-RB and KB-0167-RB) is in line with EMA guideline on 
bioanalytical method (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 Rev.1). 
•  Pharmacokinetic variables 
The PK parameters that were estimated for each stage included maximum observed plasma concentration 
(Cmax), area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 to the time of the last quantifiable concentration 
(AUC0-t), area under the concentration-time curve from time 0 extrapolated to infinity (AUC0-∞), apparent 
systemic clearance (CL/F), tmax, apparent terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), apparent volume of distribution 
(Vz/F), and apparent terminal rate constant (λz). To conclude BE of the tablet formulation relative to the 
capsule formulation, the 90% CIs of the ratios of geometric least squares mean (LSM) of the test (tablet) to 
reference (capsule) product were to be within 0.800 to 1.250 for AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and Cmax. 
BA of the tablet formulation relative to the capsule formulation was estimated based on AUC0-t, AUC0-∞, and 
Cmax obtained during stage 1. 
•  Statistical methods 
No formal sample size calculation was performed for Stage 1. Approximately 24 patients were planned to be 
enrolled in Stage 1. This sample size was considered adequate for preliminary assessment of the relative BA 
of the tablet compared to the capsules and for estimating the intrasubject CV, after accounting for patient 
drop-outs and potential carryover. Based on estimates from Stage 1, 100 BE evaluable patients were 
required in Stage 2.  
The PK parameters were derived by noncompartmental methods (Phoenix WinNonlin version 7.0 or higher) 
using actual sampling times and were summarized descriptively, including the number of observations, 
arithmetic mean, median, standard deviation, coefficient of variation (CV), minimum, maximum, geometric 
mean, and geometric CV%. PK parameters were summarized for the BA Evaluable and PK Evaluable 
Populations for niraparib and for the M1 PK Evaluable Population for M1. The intrasubject variability of Cmax, 
AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ was assessed as well as the number of patients with carryover from Period 1 to Period 2. 
A comparison of the logarithmically transformed niraparib PK parameters (Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞) was 
carried out to evaluate the relative BA between treatments (test versus reference) by performing an analysis 
of variance (ANOVA) model, accounting for sources of variation. Geometric least-squares mean (LSM), 
geometric mean ratios, and 90% CIs were presented.

Relative bioavailability (Stage 1): 
In Stage 1, 23 of the 29 randomised patients were included in the BA evaluable population. The six excluded 
patients had a predose level >5% of Cmax in period 2. 
The summary of plasma PK parameters of niraparib following administration of tablet and capsule for the BA 
Evaluable Population is presented in Table 5. 
Table 1. Summary of Pharmacokinetics Parameters of Niraparib by Treatment (BA Evaluable Population; 
Stage 1 PK Phase)  
Niraparib relative BA was assessed by comparing Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ for capsule (reference treatment) 
and tablet (test treatment) (Table 6).

The statistical evaluation of the PK parameters, Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞, for the BE Evaluable Population is 
presented in Table 8. The geometric LSM ratios for the tablet to capsule comparison were 0.9619, 0.9594, 
and 0.9566 for Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞, respectively, with 90% CIs within the 0.800 to 1.250 limits, 
demonstrating BE of the test tablet formulation to the reference capsule formulation. The intrasubject 
variability (CV %) was low and ranged from 18.1% to 23.7%.

•  Safety data 
In the Stage 1 PK Phase, observations related to TEAEs were as follows: 
• 
Two (6.9%) patients had dose reductions due to TEAEs. The TEAEs that led to dose reduction 
occurred during the PK Phase, and the dose reduction was implemented at the first dose of the 
Extension Phase. The events leading to dose reduction were increased AST (Grade 3) and increased 
ALT (Grade 2) in 1 patient and increased AST (Grade 3) in 1 patient; these 3 events were considered 
by the Investigator as related to study drug and were transient in nature as they eventually resolved. 
•  A total of 19 (65.5%) patients experienced at least 1 TEAE. TEAEs reported in more than 1 patient 
included nausea (7 [24.1%] patients); vomiting (4 [13.8%] patients); fatigue (3 [10.3%] patients); 
Assessment report  
EMA/294945/2022 
Page 21/29 
 
 
 
 
 
and AST increased, back pain, and hypomagnesaemia (2 [6.9%] patients each). 
•  Overall, related TEAEs were reported for 7 (24.1%) patients. The only TEAEs assessed as related to 
study drug by the Investigator in more than 1 patient in total were nausea (6 [20.7%] patients), 
vomiting (3 [10.3%] patients), and AST increased (2 [6.9%] patients). 
• 
In the Stage 1 PK Phase, there were no deaths, SAEs, discontinuations due to AEs, or AESIs 
reported. 
In Stage 2, observations related to TEAEs were as follows: 
•  A total of 125 (74.4%) patients experienced at least 1 TEAE. The TEAEs reported in ≥10% of 
patients overall were constipation (32 [19.0%] patients), nausea (31 [18.5%] patients), anemia (19 
[11.3%] patients), fatigue (18 [10.7%] patients), and vomiting (17 [10.1%] patients). 
•  Overall, 60 (35.7%) patients had treatment-related TEAEs, 36 (21.4%) patients had TEAEs with 
CTCAE toxicity Grade ≥3, and 8 (4.8%) patients had treatment-related TEAEs with CTCAE toxicity 
Grade ≥3. The TEAEs assessed as related to study drug by the Investigator in ≥5% of patients 
overall were nausea (21 [12.5%] patients), constipation (12 [7.1%] patients), vomiting (10 [6.0%] 
patients), and fatigue (9 [5.4%] patients). 
•  A total of 26 (15.5%) patients had serious TEAEs, 5 (3.0%) patients had TEAEs leading to treatment 
discontinuation, 3 (1.8%) patients had TEAEs leading to death, and no AESIs were reported. 
One patient experienced a TEAE in the Stage 2 PK Phase that led to the dose being reduced in the Extension 
Phase; the dose reduction could not be implemented in the Stage 2 PK Phase because only a single 
administered dose of niraparib tablet or capsule was allowed during this phase of the study. Two patients 
experienced TEAEs in the Stage 2 PK Phase that led to dose interruption. These patients had their study 
treatment delayed; one of whom eventually discontinued treatment due to disease progression. 
2.6.1.2.  Pharmacodynamics  
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application 
(introduction of a tablet formulation). 
Biowaiver for strength 
The bioequivalence study was performed on 300 mg dose. A biowaiver for strength was requested for the 
100 mg tablet strength that is intended for marketing: 
Multimedia comparative dissolution testing performed in support of the biowaiver request demonstrated 
similarity between the reference product (300-mg tablet biobatch) and test single tablet products (200- and 
100-mg tablets) across all physiologically relevant media. 
In a Phase 1 food effect study using the capsule formulation, a high fat meal did not have a clinically 
significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of niraparib.  
The niraparib tablet should behave similarly to the capsule formulation in the fed state: 
a)  niraparib is a BCS class II drug that just narrowly misses BCS class I requirements with high 
permeability and moderate solubility, 
Assessment report  
EMA/294945/2022 
Page 22/29 
 
 
 
b)  the tablet manufacturing process and excipients are not expected to affect fed bioavailability. 
c)  as the tablet and capsule formulations are bioequivalent, the same clinically insignificant effect of a 
high fat meal can be inferred on the tablet formulation as was observed for the capsule formulation. 
The comparative dissolution testing in support of the request for biowaiver for the 100 (and 200 mg) tablets 
met the criteria for similarity with f2 values ≥ 50.  
In conclusion, comparable in vitro dissolution was demonstrated between the 100 mg strength to be 
marketed, and the 300 mg strength that was demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the marketed hard capsule 
formulation (biobatch).   
2.6.2.  Discussion on clinical aspects  
Niraparib exhibits linear PK, and exposure is dose proportional. Absorption and clearance are dose 
independent (range: 30 to 400 mg). Niraparib is rapidly absorbed following oral dosing, with time to reach 
maximum observed plasma concentration (tmax) occurring within 3 hours. The oral capsule formulation has 
high bioavailability (BA; approximately 73%), and concomitant intake of a high-fat meal prior to dosing 
exerts only negligible effects on the extent and rate of absorption. 
A BA/BE study was performed to establish the bioequivalence between the previously approved hard capsule 
formulation and the new tablet formulation. The bioequivalence study was performed using the highest 
strength that was intended for marketing at the time (300 mg). With the extension of the wash-out period 
before stage 2, the design of the bioequivalence study was appropriate. 
Stage 1: Comparable performance of the capsule and tablet formulations was demonstrated; the 90% CIs of 
the geometric LSMs for Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞ were within the 0.80 to 1.25 limits. Pre-dose levels 
above 5% of Cmax was observed in period 2 in 5 out of 28 patients (18%), indicating that the wash-out 
period of 7 days was not sufficient. Considering that the wash-out period was increased to 14 days in stage 2 
of the study, and that the results from stage 2 are the primary evidence of bioequivalence, this is acceptable. 
It is considered that the primary objective of stage 1 was met: to obtain preliminary assessment of the 
relative bioavailability (BA) of 300 mg niraparib administered as a tablet versus capsule formulation and to 
estimate the intrasubject variability of niraparib pharmacokinetics. 
Stage 2: The results of stage 2 of this study was found to be consistent with the preliminary values reported 
in stage 1. BE was established between the niraparib tablet (1×300 mg) and capsule (3×100 mg) 
formulations using the BE Evaluable Population, which included patients with data in both PK Periods, as 
predefined in the protocol and the SAP. The 90% CIs of the geometric LSM ratios for tablet compared to 
capsules fell within the limits of 0.800 and 1.250 for all 3 primary niraparib PK parameters (Cmax, AUC0-t, 
and AUC0-∞). Intrasubject variability was low, ranging from 18.1% to 23.7% for the key PK parameters. 
The submitted bioequivalence study demonstrated bioequivalence between 3x100 mg hard capsules and 
1x300 mg tablet.  
Claiming that all conditions regarding biowaiver as described in the Guideline on the Investigation of 
Bioequivalence have been fulfilled, biowaiver has been requested for the additional strengths of 100 mg 
(scope of the application) and 200 mg (initially intended for marketing). It is considered that the conditions 
for biowaiver have been fulfilled:  
Assessment report  
EMA/294945/2022 
Page 23/29 
 
 
•  All the three strengths are manufactured at the same site by the same manufacturer and 
manufacturing process.  
• 
• 
The qualitative composition of the different strengths is the same.  
The composition of the strengths are quantitatively proportional (except for non-functional film 
coating)  
•  Comparable in vitro dissolution data (pH 1.2, pH 4.5 and pH 6.8) confirm the adequacy of waiving 
additional in vivo bioequivalence testing. Dissolution profiles were considered similar as supported by 
f2 value greater than 50.  
Comparative in vitro dissolution testing demonstrated that the 100 mg tablet can be supported by the 
bioequivalence result obtained with the 300 mg tablet. Consequently, a biowaiver for the additional strengths 
is considered acceptable. 
In conclusion, the combination of data provided establishes the equivalence of the niraparib tablets and the 
marketed capsule dosage form. 
2.6.3.  Conclusions on the clinical aspects  
Based on the presented bioequivalence study Zejula 3x100 mg hard capsules and 1x300 mg tablets are 
considered bioequivalent. The biowaiver for strength between the 300 mg tablet and the 100 mg tablet is 
acceptable.

The content of the new 100 mg film-coated tablet PL will be identical to the approved 100 mg hard capsule 
PL 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring  
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Zejula (niraparib) is included in the additional 
monitoring list as it contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU.  
Therefore, the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that his 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new safety 
information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
The bioequivalence study forms the pivotal basis with an open-label, 2-stage, randomized-sequence, single-
crossover design. The study design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence of this 
formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, 
overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
The test formulation of Zejula tablet met the protocol-defined criteria for bioequivalence when compared with 
the Zejula capsule. The point estimates and their 90% confidence intervals for the parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-
72h, and Cmax were all contained within the protocol-defined acceptance range. Bioequivalence of the two 
formulations was demonstrated. 
The benefit-risk balance of Zejula 100 mg tablets is comparable to the marketed Zejula 100 mg capsules.  
4.  Recommendations  
Outcome

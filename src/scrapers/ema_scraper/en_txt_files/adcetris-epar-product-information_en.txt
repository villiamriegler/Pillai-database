Special patient populations 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
Combination therapy 
Patients with renal impairment should be closely monitored for adverse events. There is no clinical 
trial experience using ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy in patients with renal 
impairment, where serum creatinine is ≥ 2.0 mg/dL and/or creatinine clearance or calculated creatinine 
clearance is ≤ 40 mL/minute. Use of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy should be 
avoided in patients with severe renal impairment.  
Patients with hepatic impairment should be closely monitored for adverse events. The recommended 
starting dose in patients with mild hepatic impairment receiving ADCETRIS in combination with 
AVD is 0.9 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 2 weeks. The 
recommended starting dose in patients with mild hepatic impairment receiving ADCETRIS in 
combination with CHP is 1.2 mg/kg administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 
3 weeks. There is no clinical trial experience using ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy in 
patients with hepatic impairment, where total bilirubin is > 1.5 times the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
(unless due to Gilbert syndrome), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or alanine aminotransferase 
(ALT) are > 3 times the ULN, or > 5 times the ULN if their elevation may be reasonably ascribed to 
the presence of HL in the liver. Use of ADCETRIS in combination with chemotherapy should be 
avoided in patients with moderate and severe hepatic impairment. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Monotherapy 
The recommended starting dose in patients with severe renal impairment is 1.2 mg/kg administered as 
an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Patients with renal impairment should be 
closely monitored for adverse events (see section 5.2). 
The recommended starting dose in patients with hepatic impairment is 1.2 mg/kg administered as an 
intravenous infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Patients with hepatic impairment should be 
closely monitored for adverse events (see section 5.2). 
Elderly 
The dosing recommendations for patients aged 65 and older are the same as for adults. Currently 
available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2. 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of ADCETRIS in children less than 18 years have not been established. 
Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a 
posology can be made. 
Method of administration  
The recommended dose of ADCETRIS is infused over 30 minutes.  
For instructions on reconstitution and dilution of the medicinal product before administration, see 
section 6.6. 
ADCETRIS must not be administered as an intravenous push or bolus. ADCETRIS should be 
administered through a dedicated intravenous line and it must not be mixed with other medicinal 
products (see section 6.2). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1.  
Combined use of bleomycin and ADCETRIS causes pulmonary toxicity (see section 4.5).  
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
John Cunningham virus (JCV) reactivation resulting in progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy 
(PML) and death can occur in ADCETRIS-treated patients. PML has been reported in patients who 
received this treatment after receiving multiple prior chemotherapy regimens. PML is a rare 
demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that results from reactivation of latent JCV and is 
often fatal.  
Patients should be closely monitored for new or worsening neurological, cognitive, or behavioural 
signs or symptoms, which may be suggestive of PML. ADCETRIS should be held for any suspected 
case of PML. Suggested evaluation of PML includes neurology consultation, gadolinium-enhanced 
magnetic resonance imaging of the brain and cerebrospinal fluid analysis for JCV DNA by polymerase 
chain reaction or a brain biopsy with evidence of JCV. A negative JCV PCR does not exclude PML. 
Additional follow up and evaluation may be warranted if no alternative diagnosis can be established. 
ADCETRIS dosing should be permanently discontinued if a diagnosis of PML is confirmed. 
7 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The physician should be particularly alert to symptoms suggestive of PML that the patient may not 
notice (e.g., cognitive, neurological, or psychiatric symptoms). 
Pancreatitis 
Acute pancreatitis has been observed in patients treated with ADCETRIS. Fatal outcomes have been 
reported. 
Patients should be closely monitored for new or worsening abdominal pain, which may be suggestive 
of acute pancreatitis. Patient evaluation may include physical examination, laboratory evaluation for 
serum amylase and serum lipase, and abdominal imaging, such as ultrasound and other appropriate 
diagnostic measures. ADCETRIS should be held for any suspected case of acute pancreatitis. 
ADCETRIS should be discontinued if a diagnosis of acute pancreatitis is confirmed.  
Pulmonary toxicity 
Cases of pulmonary toxicity, including pneumonitis, interstitial lung disease, and acute respiratory 
distress syndrome (ARDS), some with fatal outcomes, have been reported in patients receiving 
ADCETRIS. Although a causal association with ADCETRIS has not been established, the risk of 
pulmonary toxicity cannot be ruled out. In the event of new or worsening pulmonary symptoms (e.g. 
cough, dyspnoea), a prompt diagnostic evaluation should be performed and patients should be treated 
appropriately. Consider holding ADCETRIS dosing during evaluation and until symptomatic 
improvement. 
Serious infections and opportunistic infections 
Serious infections such as pneumonia, staphylococcal bacteraemia, sepsis/septic shock (including fatal 
outcomes) and herpes zoster, cytomegalovirus (CMV) (reactivation) and opportunistic infections such 
as Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia and oral candidiasis have been reported in patients treated with 
ADCETRIS. Patients should be carefully monitored during treatment for the emergence of possible 
serious and opportunistic infections. 
Infusion-related reactions 
Immediate and delayed infusion-related reactions (IRR), as well as anaphylactic reactions, have been 
reported.  
Patients should be carefully monitored during and after infusion. If an anaphylactic reaction occurs, 
administration of ADCETRIS should be immediately and permanently discontinued and appropriate 
medical therapy should be administered. 
If an IRR occurs, the infusion should be interrupted and appropriate medical management instituted. 
The infusion may be restarted at a slower rate after symptom resolution. Patients who have 
experienced a prior IRR should be premedicated for subsequent infusions. Premedication may include 
paracetamol, an antihistamine and a corticosteroid.  
IRRs are more frequent and more severe in patients with antibodies to brentuximab vedotin (see 
section 4.8). 
Tumour lysis syndrome 
Tumour lysis syndrome (TLS) has been reported with ADCETRIS. Patients with rapidly proliferating 
tumour and high tumour burden are at risk of tumour lysis syndrome. These patients should be 
monitored closely and managed according to best medical practice. Management of TLS may include 
aggressive hydration, monitoring of renal function, correction of electrolyte abnormalities, 
anti-hyperuricaemic therapy, and supportive care. 
8 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Peripheral neuropathy 
ADCETRIS may cause peripheral neuropathy, both sensory and motor. ADCETRIS-induced 
peripheral neuropathy is typically an effect of cumulative exposure to this medicinal product and is 
reversible in most cases. In clinical trials, the majority of patients had resolution or improvement of 
their symptoms (see section 4.8). Patients should be monitored for symptoms of neuropathy, such as 
hypoesthesia, hyperesthesia, paraesthesia, discomfort, a burning sensation, neuropathic pain or 
weakness. Patients experiencing new or worsening peripheral neuropathy may require a delay and a 
dose reduction of ADCETRIS or discontinuation of treatment (see section 4.2).  
Haematological toxicities 
Grade 3 or Grade 4 anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and prolonged (≥ 1 week) Grade 3 or Grade 4 
neutropenia can occur with ADCETRIS. Complete blood counts should be monitored prior to 
administration of each dose. If Grade 3 or Grade 4 neutropenia develops, refer to section 4.2. 
Febrile neutropenia 
Febrile neutropenia (fever of unknown origin without clinically or microbiologically documented 
infection with an absolute neutrophil count < 1.0 x 109/L, fever ≥ 38.5 0C; ref CTCAE v3) has been 
reported with treatment with ADCETRIS. Complete blood counts should be monitored prior to 
administration of each dose of treatment. Patients should be monitored closely for fever and managed 
according to best medical practice if febrile neutropenia develops. 
In combination therapy with AVD or CHP, advanced age was a risk factor for febrile neutropenia. 
When ADCETRIS is administered in combination with AVD or CHP, primary prophylaxis with 
G-CSF, beginning with the first dose, is recommended for all adult patients regardless of age. 
Severe cutaneous adverse reactions (SCARs) 
Cases of SCARs, including Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS), toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) and 
drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) have been reported with 
ADCETRIS. Fatal outcomes have been reported for SJS and TEN. If SJS, TEN or DRESS occur, 
ADCETRIS should be discontinued and appropriate medical therapy should be administered. 
Gastrointestinal complications 
Gastrointestinal (GI) complications including intestinal obstruction, ileus, enterocolitis, neutropenic 
colitis, erosion, ulcer, perforation and haemorrhage, some with fatal outcomes, have been reported in 
patients treated with ADCETRIS. In the event of new or worsening GI symptoms, perform a prompt 
diagnostic evaluation and treat appropriately. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Hepatotoxicity in the form of elevations in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST) has been reported with ADCETRIS. Serious cases of hepatotoxicity, 
including fatal outcomes, have also occurred. Pre-existing liver disease, comorbidities, and 
concomitant medications may also increase the risk. Liver function should be tested before initiating 
the treatment and routinely monitored in patients receiving ADCETRIS. Patients experiencing 
hepatotoxicity may require a delay, change in dose or discontinuation of ADCETRIS. 
Hyperglycaemia 
Hyperglycaemia has been reported during clinical trials in patients with an elevated Body Mass Index 
(BMI) with or without a history of diabetes mellitus. However, any patient who experiences an event 
of hyperglycaemia should have their serum glucose closely monitored. Anti-diabetic treatment should 
be administered as appropriate.  
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Infusion site extravasation 
Extravasation during intravenous infusion has occurred. Given the possibility of extravasation, it is 
recommended to closely monitor the infusion site for possible infiltration during drug administration. 
Renal and hepatic impairment 
There is limited experience in patients with renal and hepatic impairment. Available data indicate that 
MMAE clearance might be affected by severe renal impairment, hepatic impairment, and by low 
serum albumin concentrations (see section 5.2).  
CD30+ CTCL 
The size of the treatment effect in CD30 + CTCL subtypes other than mycosis fungoides (MF) and 
primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma (pcALCL) is not clear due to lack of high level 
evidence. In two single arm phase II studies of ADCETRIS, disease activity has been shown in the 
subtypes Sézary syndrome (SS), lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP) and mixed CTCL histology. These 
data suggest that efficacy and safety can be extrapolated to other CTCL CD30+ subtypes. 
Nevertheless, ADCETRIS should be used with caution in other CD30+ CTCL patients after careful 
consideration of the potential benefit-risk on an individual basis (see section 5.1). 
Sodium content in excipients 
This medicinal product contains 13.2 mg sodium per vial, equivalent to 0.7% of the WHO 
recommended maximum daily intake of 2 g sodium for an adult.  
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
Interaction with medicinal products metabolised through CYP3A4 route (CYP3A4 
inhibitors/inducers) 
Co-administration of brentuximab vedotin with ketoconazole, a strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitor, 
increased the exposure to the antimicrotubule agent MMAE by approximately 73%, and did not alter 
the plasma exposure to brentuximab vedotin. Therefore, co-administration of brentuximab vedotin 
with strong CYP3A4 and P-gp inhibitors may increase the incidence of neutropenia. If neutropenia 
develops, refer to Tables 1 and 2 for dosing recommendations for neutropenia (see section 4.2).  
Co-administration of brentuximab vedotin with rifampicin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer, did not alter the 
plasma exposure to brentuximab vedotin. Though PK data are limited, co-administration of rifampicin 
appeared to reduce plasma concentrations of MMAE metabolites that could be assayed.  
Co-administration of midazolam, a CYP3A4 substrate, with brentuximab vedotin did not alter the 
metabolism of midazolam; therefore brentuximab vedotin is not expected to alter the exposure to 
medicines that are metabolised by CYP3A4 enzymes. 
Doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD)  
The serum and plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics of antibody drug conjugate (ADC) and MMAE 
respectively following administration of brentuximab vedotin in combination with AVD were similar 
to that in monotherapy. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Co-administration of brentuximab vedotin did not affect the plasma exposure of AVD. 
Cyclophosphamide, Doxorubicin and Prednisone (CHP) 
The serum and plasma pharmacokinetic characteristics of ADC and MMAE, respectively, following 
administration of brentuximab vedotin in combination with CHP were similar to that in monotherapy. 
Co-administration of brentuximab vedotin is not expected to affect the exposure of CHP. 
Bleomycin 
There were no formal drug-drug interaction studies with brentuximab vedotin and bleomycin (B). In a 
phase 1 dose finding and safety study (SGN35-009), unacceptable pulmonary toxicity (including 
2 fatal events) was noted in 11 of 25 patients (44%) treated with brentuximab vedotin plus ABVD. No 
pulmonary toxicity or fatal events were reported with brentuximab vedotin + AVD. Therefore, 
co-administration of ADCETRIS with bleomycin is contraindicated (see section 4.3). 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Women of childbearing potential  
Women of childbearing potential should be using two methods of effective contraception during 
treatment with ADCETRIS and until 6 months after treatment.  
Pregnancy 
There are no data from the use of ADCETRIS in pregnant women. Studies in animals have shown 
reproductive toxicity (see section 5.3).  
ADCETRIS should not be used during pregnancy unless the benefit to the mother outweighs the 
potential risks to the foetus. If a pregnant woman needs to be treated she should be clearly advised on 
the potential risk to the foetus. 
See the fertility section below pertaining to advice for women whose male partners are being treated 
with ADCETRIS. 
Breast-feeding 
There are no data as to whether brentuximab vedotin or its metabolites are excreted in human milk.  
A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded.  
A decision should be made whether to discontinue breast-feeding or to discontinue/abstain from this 
therapy, taking into account a potential risk of breast-feeding for the child and the benefit of therapy 
for the woman. 
Fertility 
In non-clinical studies, brentuximab vedotin treatment has resulted in testicular toxicity, and may alter 
male fertility. MMAE has been shown to have aneugenic properties (see section 5.3). Therefore, men 
being treated with this medicine are advised to have sperm samples frozen and stored before treatment. 
Men being treated with this medicine are advised not to father a child during treatment and for up to 
6 months following the last dose.

4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
ADCETRIS may have a moderate influence on the ability to drive and use machines (e.g. dizziness), 
see section 4.8.  
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
The safety profile of ADCETRIS is based on available clinical trial data, the Named Patient Program 
(NPP), and post-marketing experience to date. Frequencies of adverse reactions described below and 
in Table 5 have been determined based on data generated from clinical studies.  
Monotherapy 
In the pooled dataset of ADCETRIS as monotherapy across HL, sALCL and CTCL studies 
(SG035-0003, SG035-0004, SGN35-005, SGN35-006, C25001, C25006 and C25007, see section 5.1) 
the most frequent adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were infections, peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, 
fatigue, diarrhoea, pyrexia, neutropenia, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, rash, cough, 
vomiting, pruritus, peripheral motor neuropathy, infusion-related reactions, constipation, dyspnoea, 
myalgia, weight decreased, and abdominal pain. 
Serious adverse drug reactions occurred in 12% of patients. The frequency of unique serious adverse 
drug reactions was ≤ 1%. 
Adverse events led to treatment discontinuation in 24% of patients receiving ADCETRIS.  
The safety data in patients retreated with ADCETRIS (SGN35-006, see section 5.1) were consistent 
with those observed in the combined pivotal phase 2 studies, with the exception of peripheral motor 
neuropathy, which had a higher incidence (28% vs. 9% in the pivotal phase 2 studies) and was 
primarily Grade 2. Patients also had a higher incidence of arthralgia, Grade 3 anaemia, and back pain 
compared to patients observed in the combined pivotal phase 2 studies. 
The safety data in patients with relapsed or refractory HL who had not received an autologous stem 
cell transplant and were treated with the recommended dose of 1.8 mg/kg every three weeks in a 
single-arm phase 4 study (n = 60), the phase 1 dose escalation and clinical pharmacology studies 
(n = 15 patients) and in the NPP (n = 26 patients) (see section 5.1) were consistent with the safety 
profile of the pivotal clinical studies.  
Combination therapy  
For safety information of chemotherapy agents given in combination with ADCETRIS (doxorubicin, 
vinblastine and dacarbazine (AVD) or cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone (CHP)), refer 
to their summary of product characteristics.  
In the studies of ADCETRIS as combination therapy in 662 patients with previously untreated 
advanced HL (C25003) and 223 patients with previously untreated CD30+ peripheral T-cell 
lymphoma (PTCL) (SGN35-014), the most common adverse reactions (≥ 10%) were: infections, 
neutropenia, peripheral sensory neuropathy, nausea, constipation, vomiting, diarrhoea, fatigue, 
pyrexia, alopecia, anaemia, weight decreased, stomatitis, febrile neutropenia, abdominal pain, 
decreased appetite, insomnia, bone pain, rash, cough, dyspnoea, arthralgia, myalgia, back pain, 
peripheral motor neuropathy, upper respiratory tract infection, and dizziness.  
In patients receiving ADCETRIS combination therapy, serious adverse reactions occurred in 34% of 
patients. Serious adverse reactions occurring in ≥ 3% of patients included febrile neutropenia (15%), 
pyrexia (5%), and neutropenia (3%).

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Neutropenia and febrile neutropenia 
Monotherapy 
In clinical trials, neutropenia led to dose delays in 13% of patients. Grade 3 neutropenia was reported 
in 13% and Grade 4 neutropenia was reported in 5% of patients. One patient required dose reduction 
and 1 patient discontinued treatment for neutropenia.  
Severe and prolonged (≥ 1 week) neutropenia can occur with this treatment which may increase the 
risk of patients developing serious infections. Febrile neutropenia reported in < 1% of the patients (see 
section 4.2). 
In the pivotal phase 2 population (SG035-0003 and SG035-0004), the median duration of Grade 3 or 
Grade 4 neutropenia was limited (1 week); 2% of patients had Grade 4 neutropenia that lasted 
≥ 7 days. Less than half of the patients in the pivotal phase 2 population with Grade 3 or Grade 4 
neutropenia had temporally associated infections, and the majority of temporally associated infections 
were Grade 1 or Grade 2. 
Combination therapy 
In the clinical trials of ADCETRIS as combination therapy, neutropenia led to dose delays in 19% of 
patients. Grade 3 neutropenia was reported in 17% and Grade 4 neutropenia was reported in 41% of 
patients. Two percent of patients required dose reduction and < 1% discontinued one of more of the 
study drugs due to neutropenia.  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Febrile neutropenia was reported in 20% of the patients who did not receive primary prophylaxis with 
G-CSF (see section 4.2). The frequency of febrile neutropenia was 13% in patients who received 
primary prophylaxis with G-CSF.  
Serious infections and opportunistic infections 
Monotherapy 
In clinical trials, serious infections and opportunistic infections occurred in 10% of patients, sepsis or 
septic shock occurred in < 1% of the patients. The most commonly reported opportunistic infections 
were herpes zoster and herpes simplex. 
Combination therapy 
In the clinical trials of ADCETRIS as combination therapy, serious infections including opportunistic 
infections occurred in 15% of patients; sepsis, neutropenic sepsis, septic shock or bacteraemia 
occurred in 4% of the patients. The most commonly reported opportunistic infections were herpes 
viral infections. 
Peripheral neuropathy 
Monotherapy 
In clinical trials treatment emergent neuropathy occurred in 57% of the population, peripheral motor 
neuropathy occurred in 13% of patients. Peripheral neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 
15%, dose reductions in 15%, and dose delays in 16% of patients. For patients who experienced 
peripheral neuropathy the median time of onset of peripheral neuropathy was 12 weeks. The median 
duration of treatment for patients who discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy was 11 cycles. 
Among patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy in the pivotal phase 2 studies (SG035-0003 
and SG035-0004) and randomised phase 3 monotherapy studies (SGN35-005 and C25001), the 
median follow up time from end of treatment until last evaluation ranged from 48.9 to 98 weeks. At 
the time of last evaluation, most of the patients (82-85%) who experienced peripheral neuropathy had 
resolution or improvement of their peripheral neuropathy symptoms. The median time from onset to 
resolution or improvement for all events ranged from 16 to 23.4 weeks.  
In patients with relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL who were retreated with ADCETRIS 
(SGN35-006), the majority of patients (80%) also had improvement or resolution of their peripheral 
neuropathy symptoms at the time of last evaluation. 
Combination therapy 
In the clinical trial of ADCETRIS as combination therapy with AVD, treatment emergent neuropathy 
occurred in 67% of the population; peripheral motor neuropathy occurred in 11% of patients. 
Peripheral neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 7%, dose reductions in 21%, and dose delays 
in 1% of patients. For patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy the median time of onset of 
peripheral neuropathy was 8 weeks. Patients who discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy received a 
median of 8 doses of ADCETRIS+AVD (A+AVD) before discontinuation of one or more agents.  
Among patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy, the median follow up time from end of 
treatment until last evaluation was approximately 286 weeks. At the time of last evaluation, most of 
the patients (86%) who experienced peripheral neuropathy had resolution or improvement of their 
peripheral neuropathy symptoms. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of 
peripheral neuropathy events was 17 weeks (ranged from 0 weeks to 283 weeks). 
In the clinical trial of ADCETRIS as combination therapy with CHP, treatment emergent neuropathy 
occurred in 52% of the population; peripheral motor neuropathy occurred in 9% of patients. Peripheral 
15 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
neuropathy led to treatment discontinuation in 1%, dose reductions in 7% and dose delays in < 1% of 
patients. For patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy the median time of onset was 9.1 weeks. 
Patients who discontinued due to peripheral neuropathy received a median of 5 doses of 
ADCETRIS + CHP (A+CHP) before discontinuation of one or more agents. 
Among patients who experienced peripheral neuropathy, the median follow up time from end of 
treatment until last evaluation was approximately 177 weeks. At the time of last evaluation, 64% who 
experienced peripheral neuropathy had resolution or improvement of their peripheral neuropathy 
symptoms. The median time from onset to resolution or improvement of peripheral neuropathy events 
was 19.0 weeks (ranged from 0 weeks to 205 weeks). 
Infusion-related reactions 
Monotherapy 
IRRs, such as headache, rash, back pain, vomiting, chills, nausea, dyspnoea, pruritus and cough were 
reported in 12% of patients. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported (see section 4.4). Symptoms of 
an anaphylactic reaction may include, but are not limited to, urticaria, angioedema, hypotension and 
bronchospasm.  
Combination therapy 
IRRs, such as headache, rash, back pain, vomiting, chills, nausea, dyspnoea, pruritus, cough, infusion 
site pain and pyrexia were reported in 8% of patients. Anaphylactic reactions have been reported (see 
section 4.4). Symptoms of an anaphylactic reaction may include, but are not limited to, urticaria, 
angioedema, hypotension and bronchospasm. 
Immunogenicity 
In clinical trials, patients were periodically tested for antibodies to brentuximab vedotin using a 
sensitive electrochemiluminescent immunoassay. There was a higher incidence of infusion-related 
reactions observed in patients with antibodies to brentuximab vedotin relative to patients who tested 
transiently positive or negative. 
The presence of antibodies to brentuximab vedotin did not correlate with a clinically meaningful 
reduction in serum brentuximab vedotin levels and did not result in a decrease in the efficacy of 
brentuximab vedotin. While the presence of antibodies to brentuximab vedotin does not necessarily 
predict the development of an IRR, there was a higher incidence of IRRs observed in patients with 
persistently positive anti-drug antibodies (ADA) relative to patients with transiently positive ADA and 
never positive ADA.  
Monotherapy Study C25002 
There was a trend of increased clearance of brentuximab vedotin in paediatric patients confirmed 
positive for ADAs. No patients aged < 12 years (0 of 11) and 2 patients aged ≥ 12 years (2 of 23) 
became persistently ADA positive. 
Combination Use Study C25004 
The rate of ADA positivity was low in Study C25004; 4 patients (aged ≥ 12 years) of 59 patients 
became transiently ADA positive, and no patients became persistently ADA positive. Due to the small 
number of transiently ADA positive patients, the impact of ADA on efficacy is inconclusive.

Paediatric population 
Monotherapy Study C25002 
Safety was evaluated in a phase 1/2 study in paediatric patients aged 7-17 years of age (n = 36) with 
relapsed or refractory (r/r) HL and sALCL (see section 5.1). In this study in 36 patients, no new safety 
concerns were reported. 
Combination Use Study C25004 
Safety was evaluated in an open-label, multicenter trial in 59 paediatric patients aged 6-17 years of age 
with previously untreated advanced-stage classical CD30+ HL in combination with chemotherapy (see 
section 5.1). In this study, no new safety concerns were reported. The most common serious adverse 
reaction reported in this study was febrile neutropenia (17%). G-CSF prophylaxis was considered at 
the physician’s discretion. Peripheral neuropathy events (per Standardized MedDRA Query) were 
reported in 24% of paediatric patients in this study. 
Elderly  
Monotherapy 
The safety profile in elderly patients is generally in line with that of adult patients. However, elderly 
patients may be more susceptible to events such as pneumonia, neutropenia and febrile neutropenia. 
Combination therapy 
In older patients (≥ 60 years of age; n = 186 [21%]), the incidence of adverse events was similar across 
treatment arms. More serious adverse events and dose modifications (including dose delays, 
reductions, and discontinuations) were reported in the older patients compared with the overall study 
population. Advanced age was a risk factor for febrile neutropenia in patients in both arms. Older 
patients who received G-CSF primary prophylaxis had lower incidence of neutropenia and febrile 
neutropenia than those who did not receive G-CSF primary prophylaxis. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
There is no known antidote for overdose of ADCETRIS. In case of overdose, the patient should be 
closely monitored for adverse reactions, particularly neutropenia, and supportive treatment should be 
administered (see section 4.4).

Mechanism of action 
Brentuximab vedotin is an ADC that delivers an antineoplastic agent that results in apoptotic cell 
death selectively in CD30-expressing tumour cells. Nonclinical data suggest that the biological 
activity of brentuximab vedotin results from a multi-step process. Binding of the ADC to CD30 on the 
cell surface initiates internalisation of the ADC-CD30 complex, which then traffics to the lysosomal 
compartment. Within the cell, a single defined active species, MMAE, is released via proteolytic 
cleavage. Binding of MMAE to tubulin disrupts the microtubule network within the cell, induces cell 
cycle arrest and results in apoptotic death of the CD30-expressing tumour cell. 
Classical HL, sALCL and subtypes of CTCL (including MF and pcALCL) express CD30 as an 
antigen on the surface of their malignant cells. This expression is independent of disease stage, line of 
therapy or transplant status. These features make CD30 a target for therapeutic intervention. Because 
of the CD30-targeted mechanism of action brentuximab vedotin is able to overcome chemo-resistance 
as CD30 is consistently expressed in patients who are refractory to multi-agent chemotherapy, 
irrespective of prior transplant status. The CD30-targeted mechanism of action of brentuximab 
vedotin, the consistent expression of CD30 throughout the classical HL, sALCL and CD30+ CTCL 
disease and therapeutic spectrums and clinical evidence in CD30-positive malignancies following 
multiple lines of treatment provide a biologic rationale for its use in patients with relapsed and 
refractory classical HL, sALCL with or without prior ASCT and CD30+ CTCL after at least 1 prior 
systemic therapy. 
Contributions to the mechanism of action by other antibody associated functions have not been 
excluded.  
Pharmacodynamic effects 
Cardiac electrophysiology 
Forty-six (46) patients with CD30-expressing haematologic malignancies were evaluable of the 
52 patients who received 1.8 mg/kg of brentuximab vedotin every 3 weeks as part of a phase 1, 
single-arm, open-label, multicenter cardiac safety study. The primary objective was to evaluate the 
effect of brentuximab vedotin on cardiac ventricular re-polarization and the predefined primary 
analysis was the change in QTc from baseline to multiple time points in Cycle 1. 
The upper 90% confidence interval (CI) around the mean effect on QTc was < 10 msec at each of the 
Cycle 1 and Cycle 3 post-baseline time points. These data indicate the absence of clinically relevant 
QT prolongation due to brentuximab vedotin administered at a dose of 1.8 mg/kg every 3 weeks in 
patients with CD30-expressing malignancies. 
Clinical efficacy and safety 
Hodgkin lymphoma 
Study C25003 
The efficacy and safety of ADCETRIS were evaluated in a randomised, open-label, 2-arm, multicenter 
trial in 1334 patients with previously untreated advanced HL in combination with chemotherapy 
(doxorubicin [A], vinblastine [V] and dacarbazine [D] [AVD]). Patients with nodular lymphocyte 
predominant HL (NLPHL) were excluded from the study. All patients had a histologically confirmed 
CD30-expressing disease. Sixty-two percent of patients had extranodal site involvement. Of the 
1334 patients, 664 patients were randomised to the ADCETRIS + AVD arm and 670 patients were 
randomised to the ABVD (doxorubicin [A], bleomycin [B], vinblastine [V] and dacarbazine [D]) arm 
and stratified by number of International Prognostic Factor Project (IPFP) risk factors and region. 
Patients were treated on days 1 and 15 of each 28-day cycle with 1.2 mg/kg of ADCETRIS 
administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes + doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, 
vinblastine 6 mg/m2, and dacarbazine 375 mg/m2. The median number of cycles received was 6

The primary endpoint in Study C25003 was modified PFS (mPFS) per independent review facility 
(IRF), defined as time from randomisation to disease progression, death, or evidence of non-complete 
response (non-CR) after completion of first-line therapy per IRF followed by subsequent anticancer 
therapy. Timing of the modified event was the date of the first PET scan post completion of first-line 
therapy demonstrating the absence of complete response (CR), defined as Deauville score of ≥ 3. The 
median modified PFS by IRF assessment was not reached in either treatment arm. The results in the 
intent-to-treat (ITT) population showed a statistically significant improvement in modified PFS for 
ADCETRIS+ AVD, with a stratified hazard ratio of 0.770 (95% CI, 0.603; 0.983, p = 0.035), 
indicating a 23% reduction in the risk of modified PFS events for ADCETRIS+ AVD versus ABVD.

between the two treatment arms in the elderly population (patients ≥ 60 years of age [n = 186] 
[HR = 1.00, 95% CI (0.58, 1.72)] and ≥ 65 years of age [n = 122] [HR = 1.01, 95% CI (0.53, 1.94)]) 
and patients without extranodal sites (n = 445) (HR = 1.04, 95% CI [0.67, 1.62]).

As of a 01 June 2021 cut-off date, approximately 5 years after enrollment of the last patient, the results 
in the ITT population showed a statistically significant improvement in OS in the ADCETRIS + AVD 
arm compared with patients treated with ABVD [HR = 0.59, 95% CI (0.396, 0.879)], see Figure 2.  
In the Stage III population, OS results indicated a 14% reduction in the risk of death in the A+AVD 
arm compared with patients in the ABVD arm (HR = 0.86, 95% CI [0.452, 1.648]); in the Stage IV 
population there was a 52% reduction in the risk of death (HR = 0.48, 95% CI [0.286, 0.799]). A 
subgroup analysis of OS showed no clinically meaningful difference between the two treatment arms 
for patients without extranodal sites (n = 445) (HR = 1.18, 95% CI [0.641, 2.187]). 
Median OS was not reached for either A+AVD or ABVD patients [95%◦CI (NE, NE)].

A descriptive analysis of OS was performed using data with median follow-up of over 7 years for OS. 
In the ITT population, a lower proportion of patients randomized to A + AVD had died (44 deaths, 
7%) compared with patients randomized to ABVD (67 deaths, 10%; HR = 0.61, 95% CI [0.414, 
0.892]). Similar proportions of Stage III patients randomized to A+AVD (20 deaths, 8%) and ABVD 
(20 deaths, 8%) had died (HR = 1.00, 95% CI [0.540, 1.866]). A lower proportion of Stage IV patients 
randomized to A + AVD (24 deaths, 6%) had died compared with patients randomized to ABVD 
(46 deaths, 11%; HR = 0.48, 95% CI [0.291, 0.784]).  
In the ITT population, 33% fewer patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVD in the ITT population 
received subsequent salvage chemotherapy (n = 66) and high-dose chemotherapy and transplant 
(n = 36) compared with those treated with ABVD (n = 99 and n = 54, respectively). In the Stage IV 
population, 35% fewer patients treated with ADCETRIS + AVD received subsequent salvage 
chemotherapy (n = 45) compared with those treated with ABVD (n = 69) and 22% fewer patients 
treated with ADCETRIS + AVD received high-dose chemotherapy and transplant (n = 29) compared 
with those treated with ABVD (n = 37). 
Study SGN35-005 
The efficacy and safety of ADCETRIS were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled, 2-arm multicenter trial in 329 patients with HL at risk of relapse or progression 
following ASCT. Patients with known cerebral/meningeal disease, including history of PML were 
excluded from the study. See Table 8 for patient characteristics. Of the 329 patients, 165 patients were 
randomised to the treatment arm and 164 patients were randomised to the placebo arm. In the study, 
patients were to receive their first dose after recovery from ASCT (between days 30-45 following 
21 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
ASCT). Patients were treated with 1.8 mg/kg of ADCETRIS or matching placebo intravenously over 
30 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 16 cycles. 
Eligible patients were required to have at least one of the following risk factors:  
• 
• 
• 
HL that was refractory to frontline treatment 
Relapsed or progressive HL that occurred < 12 months from the end of frontline treatment 
Extranodal involvement at time of pre-ASCT relapse, including extranodal extension of nodal 
masses into adjacent vital organs.

a.  At the time of the primary analysis, the median follow-up time for both arms was 30 months (range, 0 to 50).  
b.  Stratified log-rank test was not performed for PFS per Investigator. 
Pre-specified subgroup analyses of PFS per IRF were performed by patients’ best response to 
pre-ASCT salvage therapy, HL status after frontline therapy, age, gender, baseline weight, baseline 
ECOG performance status, number of treatments pre-ASCT, geographic region, pre-ASCT PET 
status, B symptom status after failure of frontline therapy, and pre-ASCT extranodal disease status. 
The analyses showed a consistent trend towards benefit for patients who received ADCETRIS 
compared with patients who received placebo with the exception of patients ≥65 years of age (n = 8). 
No differences were observed in quality of life between the treatment and placebo arms. Medical 
resource utilization (MRU) analysis showed that hospitalizations and outpatient visits, as well as 
working days/other activities missed by patients and caregivers were lower with ADCETRIS 
compared with placebo in patients with HL at increased risk of relapse. 
An updated analysis conducted after 3 years of follow-up showed a sustained PFS improvement per 
IRF (HR = 0.58 [95% CI (0.41, 0.81)]). 
As of study closure, approximately 10 years after enrollment of the first patient, PFS per investigator 
continued to show a benefit (HR = 0.51 [95% CI (0.37, 0.71)]). Overall survival results were 
consistent with those reported at the time of primary analysis (HR = 1.11 [95% CI (0.72, 1.70)]).

Post-hoc Risk Factor Analyses 
Post-hoc analyses were performed for the primary analysis of the primary endpoint to evaluate the 
impact of increased risk (number of risk factors) on clinical benefit (Table 10). Representative risk 
factors for these analyses were: 
• 
• 
HL that occurred <12 months or HL that was refractory to frontline therapy 
Best response of PR or SD to most recent salvage therapy as determined by CT and/or PET 
scanning  
Extranodal disease at pre-ASCT relapse 
B symptoms at pre-ASCT relapse 
Two or more prior salvage therapies.  
• 
• 
• 
The results of these post-hoc analyses suggest increased clinical benefit for patients with two or more 
risk factors but no difference based on any of the individual risk factors. No benefit in terms of PFS or 
OS has been observed in patients with one risk factor for relapse or progression.

Study SG035-0003 
The efficacy and safety of ADCETRIS as a single agent was evaluated in a pivotal open-label, 
single-arm, multicenter study in 102 patients with relapsed or refractory HL. See Table 11 below for a

Eighteen (18) patients (18%) received 16 cycles of ADCETRIS; and the median number of cycles 
received was 9 (ranging from 1 to 16).

Response to treatment with ADCETRIS was assessed by Independent Review Facility (IRF) using the 
Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson, 2007). Treatment response was 
assessed by spiral CT of chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis; PET scans and clinical data. Response 
assessments were performed at cycles 2, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 with PET at cycles 4 and 7. 
The objective response rate (ORR) per IRF assessment was 75% (76 of 102 patients in the 
intent-to-treat [ITT] set) and tumour reduction was achieved in 94% of patients. Complete remission 
(CR) was 33% (34 of 102 patients in the ITT set). The median overall survival (OS) is 40.5 months 
(the median observation time (time to death or last contact) from first dose was 35.1 months (range 
1.8 to 72.9+ months). The estimated overall survival rate at 5 years was 41% (95% CI [31%, 51%]). 
The investigator assessments were generally consistent with the independent review of the scans. Of 
the patients treated, 8 responding patients went on to receive an allogeneic SCT. For further efficacy 
results see Table 12.

An exploratory intra-patient analysis showed that approximately 64% of the HL patients treated with 
ADCETRIS as part of the SG035-0003 clinical study experienced an improvement in clinical benefit 
as measured by longer progression free survival (PFS) compared with their most recent prior line of 
therapy.  
Of the 35 patients (33%) who had B symptoms at baseline, 27 patients (77%) experienced resolution 
of all B symptoms at a median time of 0.7 months from initiation of ADCETRIS. 
Data in HL Patients Who Are Not Stem Cell Transplant (SCT) Candidates 
Study-C25007 
A phase 4 single-arm study was conducted in patients with relapsed or refractory HL (n = 60) who had 
received at least one prior chemotherapeutic regimen and at the time of treatment initiation with 
ADCETRIS were not considered candidates for SCT or multiagent chemotherapy. Eligible patients 
were not to have received a prior SCT. The median number of cycles was 7 (range 1 to 16 cycles). 
Patients were treated with 1.8 mg/kg of ADCETRIS every 3 weeks.  
At the time of the primary analysis of the primary endpoint, per IRF, the objective response rate 
(ORR) in the ITT population was 50% (95% CI, 37; 63%). A best overall response of CR was reported 
for 7 patients (12%); PR was reported for 23 patients (38%). Among these 30 patients, the median 
time to response, defined as the time from first dose to the soonest of PR or CR, was 6 weeks (range, 5 
to 39 weeks). The median time to best overall response, defined as the time from first dose to the 
27 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
clinical best response of CR or PR, was 11 weeks (range, 5 to 60 weeks). Twenty-eight patients (47%) 
went on to receive SCT after a median of 7 cycles (range, 4 to 16 cycles) of ADCETRIS treatment. 
The 32 patients (53%) who did not receive subsequent SCT also received ADCETRIS for a median of 
7 cycles (range, 1 to 16 cycles).  
Of the 60 patients in the study, 49 patients (82%) received > 1 prior cancer-related treatment and 
11 patients (18%) received 1 prior cancer-related treatment. Per IRF, the ORR was 51% 
(95% CI [36%, 66%]) for the patients who had received > 1 prior cancer-related treatment and 45% 
(95% CI [17%, 77%]) for the patients who had received 1 prior cancer-related treatment. For the 
patients who received > 1 prior cancer-related treatment, a best overall response of CR was reported 
for 6 patients (12%); PR was reported for 19 patients (39%). For the patients who received 1 prior 
cancer-related treatment, CR was reported for 1 patient (9%) and PR was reported for 4 patients 
(36%). Out of the 49 patients receiving > 1 line of prior treatment, 22 patients (45%) received 
subsequent SCT; of the 11 patients who had received 1 prior treatment, 6 patients (55%) received 
subsequent SCT. 
Data were also collected from patients (n = 15) in phase 1 dose escalation and clinical pharmacology 
studies, and from patients (n = 26) in a NPP, with relapsed or refractory HL who had not received an 
ASCT, and who were treated with 1.8 mg/kg of ADCETRIS every 3 weeks. 
Baseline patient characteristics showed failure from multiple prior chemotherapy regimens (median of 
3 with a range of 1 to 7) before first administration with ADCETRIS. Fifty nine percent (59%) of 
patients had advanced stage disease (Stage III or IV) at initial diagnosis.  
Results from these phase 1 studies and from the NPP experience showed, that in patients with relapsed 
or refractory HL without prior ASCT, clinically meaningful responses can be achieved as evidenced 
by an investigator-assessed, objective response rate of 54% and a complete remission rate of 22% after 
a median of 5 cycles of ADCETRIS.  
Study SGN35-006 (Retreatment Study) 
The efficacy of retreatment in patients who had previously responded (CR or PR) to treatment with 
ADCETRIS was evaluated in a phase 2, open-label, multicenter trial. Twenty patients with relapsed or 
refractory HL received a starting dose of 1.8 mg/kg and one patient received a starting dose of 
1.2 mg/kg of ADCETRIS administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. The median 
number of cycles was 7 (range, 2 to 37 cycles). Of the 20 evaluable patients with HL, 6 patients (30%) 
achieved a CR and 6 patients (30%) achieved a PR with ADCETRIS retreatment, for an ORR of 60%. 
The median duration of response was 9.2 and 9.4 months in patients who achieved OR (CR+PR) and 
CR, respectively. 
Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma 
Study SGN35-014 
The efficacy and safety of ADCETRIS were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, double-dummy, 
active-controlled, multicenter trial of 452 patients with previously untreated CD30+ PTCL in 
combination with cyclophosphamide [C], doxorubicin [H] and prednisone [P] (CHP). For enrollment, 
the trial required CD30 expression ≥ 10% per immunohistochemistry. Only patients with CD30+ 
PTCLs who were eligible for a cyclophosphamide [C], doxorubicin [H], vincristine [O] and 
prednisone [P] (CHOP)-based regimen were included. The combination of ADCETRIS + CHP has not 
been studied in all PTCL subtypes. See Table 13 for enrolled PTCL subtypes. Of the 452 patients, 
226 were randomised to treatment with ADCETRIS + CHP and 226 patients were randomised to 
treatment with CHOP. Randomisation was stratified by ALK-positive sALCL versus all other 
subtypes and by the International Prognostic Index (IPI) score. Patients were treated with 1.8 mg/kg of 
ADCETRIS administered as an intravenous infusion over 30 minutes on day 1 of each 21-day cycle + 
CHP (cyclophosphamide 750 mg/m2 every 3 weeks by IV infusion; doxorubicin 50 mg/m2 every 
3 weeks by IV infusion; and prednisone 100 mg on Days 1 to 5 of each 3-week cycle, orally) for 6 to

6 cycles of treatment, and 18% received 8 cycles of treatment. Table 13 provides a summary of 
baseline patient and disease characteristics.

The primary endpoint in SGN35-014 was PFS per IRF, defined as the time from the date of 
randomisation to the date of first documentation of progressive disease, death due to any cause, or 
receipt of subsequent anticancer chemotherapy to treat residual or progressive disease, whichever 
occurs first. Receipt of post-treatment consolidative radiotherapy, post-treatment chemotherapy for the 
purpose of mobilising peripheral blood stem cells, or consolidative autologous or allogeneic stem cell 
transplant were not considered as disease progression or as having started new anticancer therapy. 
Key secondary endpoints included PFS per IRF for patients with centrally-confirmed sALCL, CR rate 
per IRF following the completion of study treatment, OS and ORR per IRF following the completion 
of study treatment which were tested by a fixed sequence testing procedure following the statistical 
significance of PFS per IRF.  
The primary endpoint and alpha-protected, key secondary endpoints, which were evaluated 
hierarchically, were met. The median PFS per IRF for the ITT population was 48.2 months on the 
ADCETRIS + CHP arm versus 20.8 months on the CHOP arm. The stratified hazard ratio was 
0.71 (95% CI: 0.54; 0.93, p = 0.011), indicating a 29% reduction in the risk of PFS events for 
ADCETRIS + CHP versus CHOP. For overall survival, the stratified hazard ratio was 
0.66 (95% CI: 0.46; 0.95, p = 0.024), a 34% reduction in the risk of OS events for ADCETRIS + CHP 
versus CHOP.  
PFS per IRF for patients with centrally-confirmed sALCL was a pre-specified key secondary endpoint. 
The median PFS per IRF was 55.7 months on the ADCETRIS + CHP arm versus 54.2 months on the 
CHOP arm. The stratified hazard ratio was 0.59 (95% CI: 0.42; 0.84), compatible with a statistically 
significant 41% reduction in the risk of PFS events for ADCETRIS + CHP versus CHOP 
(p-value = 0.003), see Figure 6 and Table 14. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for patients with locally-diagnosed sALCL. For overall survival, 
the stratified hazard ratio was 0.54 (95% CI: 0.34; 0.87), a 46% reduction in the risk of OS events for 
ADCETRIS + CHP versus CHOP, see Figure 7. At the end of treatment, the CR rate by IRF 
assessment was 71.0% for patients on the ADCETRIS + CHP arm compared with 53.2% for patients 
on the CHOP arm with a difference of 17.7% (95% CI: 7.2%; 28.3%). At the end of treatment, the 
ORR rate by IRF assessment was 87.7% for patients on the ADCETRIS + CHP arm compared with 
70.8% for patients on the CHOP arm with a difference of 16.9% (95% CI: 8.1%; 25.7%). In the 
subgroup of patients with ALK+ sALCL and ALK- sALCL the stratified hazard ratio for PFS per IRF 
was 0.29 (95% CI: 0.11; 0.79) and 0.65 (95% CI: 0.44; 0.95), respectively.

As of study closure more than 7 years after enrollment of the first patient, PFS per investigator results 
in the ITT population indicated a 30% reduction in the risk of a PFS event in the ADCETRIS+CHP 
arm compared with patients treated with CHOP (HR = 0.70 [95% CI (0.53, 0.91)]). PFS per 
investigator results in the sALCL population indicated a 45% reduction in the risk of a PFS event in 
the ADCETRIS+CHP arm compared with patients treated with CHOP (HR = 0.55 [95% CI (0.39, 
0.79)]). 
As of study closure, overall survival results continued to show a benefit and were consistent with those 
reported at the time of the primary analysis. Overall survival results in the ITT population indicated a 
28% reduction in the risk of death in the ADCETRIS+CHP arm compared with patients treated with 
CHOP (HR = 0.72 [95% CI (0.53 to 0.99)]). Overall survival results in the sALCL population 
indicated a 34% reduction in the risk of death in the ADCETRIS+CHP arm compared with patients 
treated with CHOP (HR = 0.66 [95% CI (0.43, 1.01)]), see Figure 8.

a.  One patient had a baseline ECOG status of 2, which was prohibited by protocol and is captured as Inclusion Criteria Not 
Met. 
b.  Primary refractory sALCL is defined as a failure to achieve a complete remission to, or progressed within 3 months of 
completing frontline therapy. 
The median time from initial sALCL diagnosis to first dose with ADCETRIS was 16.8 months.  
Ten (10) patients (17%) received 16 cycles of ADCETRIS; the median number of cycles received was 
7 (range, 1 to 16).  
Response to treatment with ADCETRIS was assessed by Independent Review Facility (IRF) using the 
Revised Response Criteria for Malignant Lymphoma (Cheson, 2007). Treatment response was 
assessed by spiral CT of chest, neck, abdomen and pelvis; PET scans and clinical data. Response 
assessments were performed at cycles 2, 4, 7, 10, 13 and 16 with PET at cycles 4 and 7.  
The ORR per IRF assessment was 86% (50 of 58 patients in the ITT set). CR was 59% (34 of 
58 patients in the ITT set) and tumour reduction (of any degree) was achieved in 97% of patients. The 
estimated overall survival at 5 years was 60% (95% CI [47%,73%]). The median observation time 
(time to death or last contact) from first dose was 71.4 months. The investigator assessments were 
generally consistent with the independent review of the scans. Of the patients treated, 9 responding 
patients went on to receive an allogeneic stem cell transplant (SCT) and 9 responding patients went on 
to autologous SCT. For further efficacy results, see Table 16 and Figure 9.

Figure 9: Kaplan-Meier Plot of OS 
An exploratory intra-patient analysis showed that approximately 69% of the sALCL patients treated 
with ADCETRIS as part of the SG035-0004 clinical study experienced an improvement in clinical 
benefit as measured by longer progression free survival (PFS) compared with their most recent prior 
line of therapy. 
Of the 17 patients (29%) who had B symptoms at baseline, 14 patients (82%) experienced resolution 
of all B symptoms in a median time from initiation of ADCETRIS of 0.7 months. 
Study C25006 
The efficacy and safety of ADCETRIS as a single agent were also evaluated in a phase 4 open-label, 
single-arm multicenter study in 50 patients with relapsed or refractory sALCL. The ORR per IRF 
assessment was 64% (32 of 50 patients in the ITT set). The median DOR per IRF was not reached 
(95% CI 19.71 months, NE). The CR rate was 30% (15 of 50 patients in the ITT set), and tumour 
reduction (of any degree) was achieved in 93% of evaluable patients. The median DOCR per IRF was 
not reached (95% CI 10.61 months, NE). Response assessments were generally consistent between 
35 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IRF and investigator. Of the patients treated, 13 patients went on to receive a haematopoietic stem cell 
transplant.  
Pooled data from studies C25006 and SG035-0004 (N=108) show an ORR per IRF of 76% (82 of 
108 patients in the ITT set). The median DOR per IRF was 17.0 months (95% CI 12.62, 32.46). CR 
was 45% (49 of 108 patients in the ITT set) and tumour reduction (of any degree) was achieved in 
96% of evaluable patients. The median DOCR per IRF was 26.3 months (95% CI 16.16, NE). 
Response assessments per IRF and investigator were generally consistent.  
Study SGN35-006 (Retreatment study) 
The efficacy of retreatment in patients who had previously responded (CR or PR) to treatment with 
ADCETRIS was evaluated in a phase 2, open-label, multicenter trial. Seven patients with relapsed 
sALCL received a starting dose of 1.8 mg/kg and one patient received a starting dose of 1.2 mg/kg of 
ADCETRIS administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. The median number of cycles 
was 8.5 (range, 2 to 30 cycles). Of the 8 sALCL patients, 3 were retreated twice for a total of 
11 retreatment experiences. Retreatment with ADCETRIS resulted in 6 CRs (55%) and 4 PRs (36%), 
for an ORR of 91%. The median duration of response was 8.8 and 12.3 months in patients who 
achieved OR (CR+PR) and CR, respectively. 
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma 
Study C25001 
The efficacy and safety of ADCETRIS as a single agent was evaluated in a pivotal phase 3, 
open-label, randomised, multicentre study in 128 patients with histologically confirmed CD30+ 
CTCL. CD30 positivity was defined as ≥ 10% target lymphoid cells demonstrating membrane, 
cytoplasmic, and/or Golgi staining pattern based on an immunohistochemistry assay (Ventana 
anti-CD30 [Ber-H2]). Patients with a diagnosis of mycosis fungoides [MF] or primary cutaneous 
anaplastic large cell lymphoma [pcALCL] were considered eligible for the study. Patients were 
stratified by these disease types and randomised 1:1 to receive either ADCETRIS or the physician’s 
choice of either methotrexate or bexarotene. Patients with pcALCL received either prior radiation 
therapy or at least 1 prior systemic therapy and patients with MF received at least 1 prior systemic 
therapy. Patients with a concurrent diagnosis of systemic ALCL, Sezary syndrome and other 
non-Hodgkin lymphoma (except for lymphomatoid papulosis [LyP]) were excluded from this study. 
Patients were treated with 1.8 mg/kg of ADCETRIS intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for 
up to 16 cycles or physician’s choice for up to 48 weeks. The median number of cycles was 
approximately 12 cycles in the ADCETRIS arm. In the physician’s choice arm, the median duration of 
treatment (number of cycles) for patients receiving bexarotene was approximately 16 weeks 
(5.5 cycles) and 11 weeks (3 cycles) for patients receiving methotrexate. Table 17 provides a summary 
of the baseline patient and disease characteristics.

Pre-specified subgroup analyses of ORR4 per IRF were performed by patients’ CTCL subtype, 
physicians’ choice of treatment, baseline ECOG status, age, gender, and geographic region. The 
analyses showed a consistent trend towards benefit for patients who received ADCETRIS compared 
with patients who received physician’s choice. ORR4 was 50% and 75% in the ADCETRIS arm 
versus 10.2% and 20% in the physician’s choice arm for MF and pcALCL, respectively. 
No meaningful differences in quality of life (assessed by the EuroQol five dimensions questionnaire 
[EQ-5D] and Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-General [FACT-G]) were observed between 
the treatment arms. 
The efficacy and safety of ADCETRIS were evaluated in two additional open-label studies in 
108 patients with relapsed CD30+ CTCL (including MF and pcALCL as well as SS, LyP and mixed 
CTCL histology), regardless of CD30 expression level. Patients were treated with ADCETRIS 
1.8 mg/kg intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for up to 16 cycles. The safety and efficacy 
results in these studies were consistent with results in Study C25001. Overall response rates for MF 
were 54-66%; pcALCL, 67%; SS, 50%; LyP, 92%; and mixed CTCL histology, 82-85%. 
Paediatric population 
Combination therapy 
C25004 
The safety and anti-tumour activity of ADCETRIS were evaluated in an open-label, multicenter trial 
in 59 paediatric patients (6-17 years of age) with previously untreated advanced-stage classical 
CD30+ HL in combination with chemotherapy (doxorubicin [A], vinblastine [V] and dacarbazine [D] 
[AVD]). All patients had a histologically confirmed CD30-expressing disease. Fifty-nine percent of 
patients (n = 35) had extranodal site involvement. All 59 paediatric patients were treated on days 1 and 
15 of each 28-day cycle with 48 mg/m2 of ADCETRIS administered as an intravenous infusion over 
30 minutes + doxorubicin 25 mg/m2, vinblastine 6 mg/m2, and dacarbazine 375 mg/m2. The 
BSA-based dose of ADCETRIS was chosen to match the observed PK exposures in adults in Study 
C25003. The paediatric maximum tolerated dose (MTD) was not reached. The majority of patients 
(88%) achieved an objective response by IRF assessment at the EOT, with 76% achieving a CR. No

irradiation after Cycle 6. 
Monotherapy

The safety, pharmacokinetics and anti-tumour activity of ADCETRIS in 36 paediatric patients 
(7-17 years of age) with r/r HL and sALCL (children aged 7-11 years, n = 12 and adolescents aged 
12 to 17 years, n = 24) were evaluated in a phase 1/2 open-label, single-agent, multicentre 
dose-escalation study (C25002). Phase 1 of the study assessed the safety profile (see section 4.8), 
determined the paediatric maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and/or recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D), 
and assessed the pharmacokinetics of ADCETRIS (see section 5.2). Phase 1 included 3 r/r HL patients 
treated at 1.4 mg/kg and 9 patients (7 r/r HL and 2 sALCL) treated at 1.8 mg/kg. The MTD was not 
reached. The RP2D was determined to be 1.8 mg/kg. Across the study, a total of 16 patients with r/r 
HL and 17 patients with r/r sALCL, of whom 10 were in first relapse, were treated with 1.8 mg/kg of 
ADCETRIS. The overall response rate (ORR) per independent review facility (IRF) was analysed 
across both study phases at the RP2D. Of these 33 patients who received the RP2D, 32 were evaluable 
for response. The ORR was 47% in response-evaluable patients with r/r HL, 53% in patients with r/r 
sALCL and 60% in sALCL patients in first relapse. Eight HL patients and 9 sALCL patients went on 
to receive SCT following treatment with ADCETRIS.  
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
Monotherapy 
The pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin were evaluated in phase 1 studies and in a population 
pharmacokinetic analysis of data from 314 patients. In all clinical trials, brentuximab vedotin was 
administered as an intravenous infusion.  
Maximum concentrations of brentuximab vedotin ADC were typically observed at the end of infusion 
or the sampling timepoint closest to the end of infusion. A multiexponential decline in ADC serum 
concentrations was observed with a terminal half-life of approximately 4 to 6 days. Exposures were 
approximately dose proportional. Minimal to no accumulation of ADC was observed with multiple 
doses at the every 3-week schedule, consistent with the terminal half-life estimate. Typical Cmax and 
AUC of ADC after a single 1.8 mg/kg in a phase 1 study was approximately 31.98 μg/ mL and 
79.41 μg/ mL x day respectively. 
MMAE is the major metabolite of brentuximab vedotin. Median Cmax, AUC and Tmax of MMAE after 
a single 1.8 mg/kg of the ADC in a phase 1 study was approximately 4.97 ng/ mL, 37.03 ng/ mL x day 
and 2.09 days respectively. MMAE exposures decreased after multiple doses of brentuximab vedotin 
with approximately 50% to 80% of the exposure of the first dose being observed at subsequent doses. 
MMAE is further metabolised mainly to an equally potent metabolite; however, its exposure is an 
order of magnitude lower than that of MMAE. Thus, it is not likely to have any substantial 
contribution to the systemic effects of MMAE. 
In the first cycle, higher MMAE exposure was associated with an absolute decrease in neutrophil 
count. 
Combination therapy 
The pharmacokinetics of ADCETRIS in combination with AVD were evaluated in a single phase 3 
study in 661 patients. Population pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that the pharmacokinetics of 
ADCETRIS in combination with AVD were consistent to that in monotherapy.  
After multiple-dose, IV infusion of 1.2 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin every two weeks, maximal serum 
concentrations of ADC were observed near the end of the infusion and elimination exhibited a 
multi-exponential decline with a t1/2z of approximately 4 to 5 days. Maximal plasma concentrations of 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
MMAE were observed approximately 2 days after the end of infusion, and exhibited a 
mono-exponential decline with a t1/2z of approximately 3 to 4 days. 
After multiple-dose, IV infusion of 1.2 mg/kg brentuximab vedotin every two weeks, steady-state 
trough concentrations of ADC and MMAE were achieved by Cycle 3. Once steady-state was achieved, 
the PK of ADC did not appear to change with time. ADC accumulation (as assessed by AUC14D 
between Cycle 1 and Cycle 3) was 1.27-fold. The exposure of MMAE (as assessed by AUC14D 
between Cycle 1 and Cycle 3) appeared to decrease with time by approximately 50%. 
The pharmacokinetics of ADCETRIS in combination with CHP were evaluated in a single phase 
3 study in 223 patients (SGN35-014). After multiple-dose IV infusion of 1.8 mg/kg ADCETRIS every 
3 weeks, the pharmacokinetics of ADC and MMAE were similar to those of monotherapy. 
Distribution 
In vitro, the binding of MMAE to human serum plasma proteins ranged from 68-82%. MMAE is not 
likely to displace or to be displaced by highly protein-bound medicines. In vitro, MMAE was a 
substrate of P-gp and was not an inhibitor of P-gp at clinical concentrations. 
In humans, the mean steady state volume of distribution was approximately 6-10 L for ADC. Based on 
population PK estimation the typical apparent central volume of distribution of MMAE was 35.5 L. 
Metabolism 
The ADC is expected to be catabolised as a protein with component amino acids recycled or 
eliminated. 
In vivo data in animals and humans suggest that only a small fraction of MMAE released from 
brentuximab vedotin is metabolised. The levels of MMAE metabolites have not been measured in 
human plasma. At least one metabolite of MMAE has been shown to be active in vitro.  
MMAE is a substrate of CYP3A4 and possibly CYP2D6. In vitro data indicate that the MMAE 
metabolism that occurs is primarily via oxidation by CYP3A4/5. In vitro studies using human liver 
microsomes indicate that MMAE inhibits only CYP3A4/5 at concentrations much higher than was 
achieved during clinical application. MMAE does not inhibit other isoforms.  
MMAE did not induce any major CYP450 enzymes in primary cultures of human hepatocytes. 
Elimination 
The ADC is eliminated by catabolism with a typical estimated CL and half-life of 1.5 L/day and 
4-6 days respectively.  
The elimination of MMAE was limited by its rate of release from ADC, typical apparent CL and 
half-life of MMAE was 19.99 L/day and 3-4 days respectively.  
An excretion study was undertaken in patients who received a dose of 1.8 mg/kg of brentuximab 
vedotin. Approximately 24% of the total MMAE administered as part of the ADC during a 
brentuximab vedotin infusion was recovered in both urine and faeces over a 1-week period. Of the 
recovered MMAE, approximately 72% was recovered in the faeces. A lesser amount of MMAE (28%) 
was excreted in the urine. 
Pharmacokinetics in special populations 
Population PK analysis showed that baseline serum albumin concentration was a significant covariate 
of MMAE clearance. The analysis indicated that MMAE clearance was 2-fold lower in patients with 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
low serum albumin concentrations < 3.0 g/dL compared with patients with serum albumin 
concentrations within the normal range. 
Hepatic impairment 
A study evaluated the PK of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE after the administration of 1.2 mg/kg of 
ADCETRIS to patients with mild (Child-Pugh A; n = 1), moderate (Child-Pugh B; n = 5) and severe 
(Child-Pugh C; n = 1) hepatic impairment. Compared to patients with normal hepatic function, 
MMAE exposure increased approximately 2.3-fold (90% CI 1.27-4.12-fold) in patients with hepatic 
impairment. 
Renal impairment 
A study evaluated the PK of brentuximab vedotin and MMAE after the administration of 1.2 mg/kg of 
ADCETRIS to patients with mild (n = 4), moderate (n = 3) and severe (n = 3) renal impairment. 
Compared to patients with normal renal function, MMAE exposure increased approximately 1.9-fold 
(90% CI 0.85-4.21-fold) in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance < 30 mL/min). 
No effect was observed in patients with mild or moderate renal impairment. 
Elderly 
The population pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin were examined from several studies, 
including data from 380 patients up to 87 years old (34 patients ≥ 65-< 75 and 17 patients ≥ 75 years 
of age). Additionally, the population pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin in combination with 
AVD were examined, including data from 661 patients up to 82 years old (42 patients ≥ 65-< 75 and 
17 patients ≥ 75 years of age). The influence of age on pharmacokinetics was investigated in each 
analysis and it was not a significant covariate. 
Paediatric population 
Monotherapy 
C25002 
The pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE following a 30-minute intravenous 
infusion of BV administered at 1.4 mg/kg or 1.8 mg/kg given every 3 weeks were evaluated in a phase 
1/2 clinical trial of 36 paediatric patients (7-17 years of age) with r/r HL and sALCL (children aged 
7-11 years, n = 12 and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, n = 24) (see section 5.1). The Cmax of ADC 
was typically observed at the end of infusion or the sampling closest to the end of infusion. A 
multi-exponential decline in ADC serum concentrations was observed with a terminal half-life of 
approximately 4 to 5 days. Exposures were approximately dose proportional with a trend observed for 
lower ADC exposures at lower ages/ body weights in the study population.  
Median ADC AUC in children and adolescents from this study was approx. 14% and 3% lower than in 
adult patients, respectively, while MMAE exposures were 53% lower and 13% higher, respectively, 
than in adult patients. Median Cmax and AUC of ADC after a single 1.8 mg/kg dose were 29.8 µg/ mL 
and 67.9 µg*day/ mL, respectively, in patients < 12 years of age and 34.4 µg/mL and 
77.8 µg*day/mL, respectively, in patients ≥ 12 years of age. Median Cmax, AUC, and Tmax of MMAE 
after a single 1.8 mg/kg dose were 3.73 ng/mL, 17.3 ng*day/mL, and 1.92 days, respectively, in 
patients < 12 years of age and 6.33 ng/mL, 42.3 ng*day/mL, and 1.82 days, respectively, in patients 
≥ 12 years of age. There was a trend of increased clearance of brentuximab vedotin in paediatric 
patients confirmed positive for ADAs. No patients aged < 12 years (0 of 11) and 2 patients aged 
≥ 12 years (2 of 23) became persistently ADA positive. 
Combination therapy 
C25004 
The pharmacokinetics of brentuximab vedotin ADC and MMAE following a 30-minute intravenous 
infusion of BV administered at 48 mg/m2 every 2 weeks in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine, 
41 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and dacarbazine (AVD) were evaluated in a phase 1/2 clinical trial of 59 paediatric patients 
(6-17 years of age) with advanced-stage newly diagnosed CD30+ classical Hodgkin lymphoma 
(children aged 6-11 years, n = 11 and adolescents aged 12 to 17 years, n = 48). The Cmax of ADC 
occurred in serum approximately at the end of infusion and declined in a multiexponential manner 
with a terminal half-life of approximately 4 days. The Cmax of MMAE occurred in plasma 
approximately 2 days following BV administration with a half-life of approximately 2 days. 
Geometric mean Cmax and AUC of ADC following a single 48 mg/m2 dose were 22.5 µg/mL and 
46.7 µg*day/mL, respectively. Geometric mean Cmax and AUC of MMAE following a single 
48 mg/m2 dose were 4.9 ng/mL and 27.2 ng*day/mL, respectively. Similar ADC exposures were 
achieved following body surface area-based dosing of BV at 48 mg/m2 in combination with AVD 
among paediatric age groups (< 12 years, 12 – 16 years and > 16 years). 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
MMAE has been shown to have aneugenic properties in an in vivo rat bone marrow micronucleus 
study. These results were consistent with the pharmacological effect of MMAE on the mitotic 
apparatus (disruption of the microtubule network) in cells. 
The effects of brentuximab vedotin on human male and female fertility have not been studied. 
However, results of repeat-dose toxicity studies in rats indicate the potential for brentuximab vedotin 
to impair male reproductive function and fertility. Testicular atrophy and degeneration were partially 
reversible following a 16-week treatment-free period. 
Brentuximab vedotin caused embryo-foetal lethality in pregnant female rats.  
In nonclinical studies, lymphoid depletion and reduced thymic weight were observed, consistent with 
the pharmacologic disruption of microtubules caused by MMAE derived from brentuximab vedotin.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Adcetris is and what it is used for 
Adcetris contains the active substance brentuximab vedotin, an anti-cancer agent, which is made up 
of a monoclonal antibody linked to a substance intended to kill cancer cells. This substance is 
delivered to cancer cells by the monoclonal antibody. A monoclonal antibody is a protein which 
recognises certain cancer cells.  
Hodgkin lymphoma, systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma are 
types of cancer of the white blood cells. 
Classical Hodgkin lymphoma expresses specific proteins on the cell surface that are different from 
non-classical Hodgkin lymphoma.  
Adcetris is used to treat patients with advanced classical Hodgkin lymphoma who have not had 
treatment before. Adcetris will be given to you together with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine 
which are other chemotherapy medicines used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma.  
Adcetris is used alone to lower the likelihood of classical Hodgkin lymphoma coming back after an 
autologous stem cell transplant in patients with certain risk factors. 
Adcetris is also used alone to treat classical Hodgkin lymphoma that has: 
- 
come back after or not responded to an infusion of your own healthy stem cells into your body 
(autologous stem cell transplant), or 
come back after or never responded to at least two previous therapies, and where you cannot 
receive additional combination anti-cancer treatments or have an autologous stem cell 
transplant. 
- 
Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma found in your lymph 
nodes and/or throughout other parts of your body. 
Adcetris is used to treat patients with systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma who have not had 
treatment before. Adcetris will be given to you together with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 
prednisone which are other chemotherapy medicines used to treat these conditions. 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Adcetris is also used to treat systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma that has: 
- 
- 
not responded to other types of anti-cancer treatments, or  
come back after previous anti-cancer treatment. 
Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma is a cancer of a certain type of white blood cell called a ‘T-cell’ that 
mainly affects the skin. Adcetris is used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma where a specific type of 
protein is present on the cells’ surface. 
Adcetris is used to treat cutaneous T-cell lymphoma in patients who have previously received at least 
one anti-cancer medicine that travels through the bloodstream. 
2.  What you need to know before you are given Adcetris 
Do NOT use Adcetris if you 
- 
- 
are allergic to brentuximab vedotin or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
are currently using bleomycin, an anti-cancer agent.  
Warnings and precautions 
When you first receive this medicine and during the course of treatment, tell your doctor if you: 
- 
have confusion, trouble thinking, memory loss, blurred or loss of vision, decreased strength, 
decreased control or sensation in one arm or leg, a change in the way of walking, or loss of 
balance, as these may be symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal brain condition known as 
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). If you have these symptoms prior to 
treatment with this medicine, tell your doctor immediately about any changes in these 
symptoms. You should also inform your partner or caregivers about your treatment, since they 
may notice symptoms that you are not aware of 
have severe and persistent stomach pain, with or without nausea and vomiting, as these may be 
symptoms of a serious and potentially fatal condition known as pancreatitis (inflammation of 
the pancreas) 
have new or worsening shortness of breath or cough as these may be symptoms of a serious and 
potentially fatal lung complication (pulmonary toxicity) 
are taking, or have previously taken, medicines which may affect your immune system, such as 
chemotherapy or immunosuppressive agents  
have, or think you have, an infection. Some infections may be serious and can be due to viruses, 
bacteria, or other causes that may be life-threatening 
experience a whistling sound during breathing (wheezing)/difficulty breathing, hives, itching, or 
swelling (signs of an infusion reaction). For more detailed information, see “Infusion reactions” 
in section 4 
have any problems with a change in the sensitivity of the skin, especially in the hands or feet, 
such as numbness, tingling, a burning sensation, pain, discomfort or weakness (neuropathy) 
have headaches, feel tired, experience dizziness, look pale (anaemia), or have unusual bleeding 
or bruising under the skin, longer than usual bleeding after your blood has been drawn, or 
bleeding from your gums (thrombocytopenia)  
develop chills or shivering, or feel warm; you should take your temperature as you may have a 
fever. A fever with a low white blood cell count may be a sign of serious infection  
experience dizziness, decreased urination, confusion, vomiting, nausea, swelling, shortness of 
breath, or heart rhythm disturbances (this may be a potentially life-threatening complication 
known as tumour lysis syndrome) 
experience flu-like symptoms followed by a painful red or purplish rash that spreads and blisters 
including extensive detachment of the skin that may be life-threatening (this may be a serious 
skin reaction known as Stevens-Johnson syndrome and toxic epidermal necrolysis) 
experience widespread rash, high body temperature and enlarged lymph nodes (DRESS 
syndrome or drug hypersensitivity syndrome)

have new or worsening stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, constipation as these may be symptoms 
of a serious and potentially fatal stomach or intestinal complication (gastrointestinal 
complications) 
have abnormal liver test results as this may be related to a serious and potentially fatal liver 
injury (hepatotoxicity). Liver disease and other medical conditions that may have been present 
before you start taking Adcetris and some medications that you are currently taking might 
increase the risk of liver injury 
feel tired, have frequent urination, increased thirst, increased appetite with unintended weight 
loss, or irritability (hyperglycaemia) 
get a burning sensation, feel pain or tenderness at or surrounding the infusion site during the 
infusion, this could indicate that Adcetris has leaked outside the blood vessel. Tell your doctor 
or nurse immediately. If Adcetris has leaked outside the blood vessel, skin redness, pain, 
discolouration, swelling, blistering, peeling, or infection of deeper layers of your skin (cellulitis) 
at or surrounding the infusion site can occur within days or weeks after the infusion. 
have kidney or liver problems 
Your doctor will perform regular blood tests to make sure that it is safe for you to receive this 
medicine. 
Other medicines and Adcetris 
Tell your doctor if you are taking any other medicines, if you have taken any recently, or if you start 
taking new ones. This includes herbal medicines and other medicines you can obtain without a 
prescription.  
Pregnancy, breast-feeding and fertility 
You and your partner must use two methods of effective contraception during your treatment with this 
medicine. Women must continue using contraception for 6 months following the last dose of Adcetris. 
You should not use this medicine if you are pregnant unless you and your doctor decide that the 
benefit to you outweighs the potential risk to the unborn baby.  
It is important to tell your doctor before and during treatment if you are pregnant, think you may be 
pregnant, or are planning to get pregnant. 
If you are breast-feeding, you should discuss with your doctor whether you should receive this 
medicine. 
Men being treated with this medicine are advised to have sperm samples frozen and stored before 
treatment. Men are advised not to father a child during treatment with this medicine and for up to 
6 months following the last dose of this medicine.

3. 
How Adcetris will be given 
If you have any questions on the use of this medicine, ask the doctor or nurse who is giving you the 
infusion.  
Dose and frequency 
The dose of this medicine depends on your body weight.  
•  The usual dose of Adcetris given in combination with doxorubicin, vinblastine and dacarbazine is 
1.2 mg/kg given every 2 weeks for 6 months.  
•  The usual dose of Adcetris given in combination with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and 
prednisone is 1.8 mg/kg given every 3 weeks for approximately 4-6 months.  
See the package leaflets for these medicines given in combination with Adcetris for additional 
information on their use and effects. After the first dose of Adcetris in combination with 
chemotherapy, your doctor may also give you a medicine that will help prevent development or reduce 
the severity of neutropenia (decrease of white blood cell count) which can increase the risk of 
infection. Tell your doctor if you have kidney or liver problems as your doctor may lower your starting 
dose or may not recommend Adcetris. 
•  The usual dose of Adcetris given alone is 1.8 mg/kg, given once every 3 weeks for no more than 
one year. Your doctor may lower your starting dose to 1.2 mg/kg if you have kidney or liver 
problems. 
Adcetris is to be given to adults only. It is not for use in children.  
How Adcetris is given

Disposal 
Adcetris is for single use only. 
Any unused product or waste material should be disposed of in accordance with local requirements. 
Instructions for reconstitution  
Each single use vial must be reconstituted with 10.5 mL of water for injections to a final concentration 
of 5 mg/mL. Each vial contains a 10% overfill giving 55 mg of Adcetris per vial and a total 
reconstituted volume of 11 mL. 
1. 
2. 
3. 
Direct the stream toward the wall of the vial and not directly at the cake or powder.  
Gently swirl the vial to aid dissolution. DO NOT SHAKE.  
The reconstituted solution in the vial is a clear to slightly opalescent, colourless solution with a 
final pH of 6.6.  
The reconstituted solution should be inspected visually for any foreign particulate matter and/or 
discolouration. In the event of either being observed, discard the medicinal product. 
4. 
Preparation of Infusion Solution 
The appropriate amount of reconstituted Adcetris must be withdrawn from the vial(s) and added to an 
infusion bag containing sodium chloride 9 mg/mL (0.9%) solution for injection in order to achieve a 
final concentration of 0.4-1.2 mg/mL Adcetris. The recommended diluent volume is 150 mL. The 
already reconstituted Adcetris can also be diluted into 5% dextrose for injection or Lactated Ringer's 
for injection.  
Gently invert the bag to mix the solution containing Adcetris. DO NOT SHAKE.  
Any portion left in the vial, after withdrawal of the volume to be diluted, must be disposed of in 
accordance with local requirements.  
Do not add other medicinal products to the prepared Adcetris infusion solution or intravenous infusion 
set. The infusion line should be flushed following administration with sodium chloride 9 mg/mL 
(0.9%) solution for injection, 5% dextrose for injection, or Lactated Ringer's for injection.  
Following dilution, infuse the Adcetris solution immediately at the recommended infusion rate.  
Total storage time of the solution from reconstitution to infusion should not exceed 24 hours.

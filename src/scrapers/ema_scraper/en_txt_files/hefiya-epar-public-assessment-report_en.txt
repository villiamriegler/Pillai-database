1  Background information on the procedure 
1.1  Submission of the dossier 
The applicant Sandoz GmbH submitted on 23 November 2017 an application for marketing authorisation 
to the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for Hefiya, through the centralised procedure falling within the 
Article 3(1) and point 1 of Annex of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004. 
The applicant applied for the following indications: 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Hefiya in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or 
more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Hefiya can be given as monotherapy in case of 
intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the 
efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1 of the SmPC). Adalimumab has not been studied in patients 
aged less than 2 years. 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age 
and older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy 
(see section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had 
an inadequate response to conventional therapy. 
Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and / or MRI, who have had an 
inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the 
response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate.

2  Scientific discussion 
2.1  Problem statement 
2.1.1  Disease or condition 
Hefiya (also referred to as GP2017) is being developed as a biosimilar candidate to Humira (adalimumab).  
The reference product Humira is authorised for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis (RA), juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) (polyarticular JIA and enthesitis-related arthritis), axial spondyloarthritis 
(ankylosing spondylitis [AS], and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS), psoriatic 
arthritis (PsA), psoriasis (PsO), paediatric plaque psoriasis, Crohn’s disease (CD), paediatric Crohn’s 
disease, ulcerative colitis (UC), hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) including adolescent HS and non-infectious 
Uveitis (UV) including paediatric uveitis in the European Union.  
The Applicant claims the same therapeutic indications for Hefiya as are granted for Humira in the EU, 
except for rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Crohn’s disease (CD), pediatric Crohn’s and ulcerative colitis (UC).  
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Hefiya in combination with methotrexate is indicated for the treatment of active polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis, in patients from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to one or 
more disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Hefiya can be given as monotherapy in case of 
intolerance to methotrexate or when continued treatment with methotrexate is inappropriate (for the 
efficacy in monotherapy see section 5.1 of the SmPC). Adalimumab has not been studied in patients aged 
less than 2 years. 
Enthesitis-related arthritis 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of active enthesitis-related arthritis in patients, 6 years of age and 
older, who have had an inadequate response to, or who are intolerant of, conventional therapy (see 
section 5.1 of the SmPC). 
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe active ankylosing spondylitis who have had an 
inadequate response to conventional therapy. 
Axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic evidence of AS 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of adults with severe axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of AS but with objective signs of inflammation by elevated CRP and / or MRI, who have had an 
inadequate response to, or are intolerant to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. 
Psoriatic arthritis 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of active and progressive psoriatic arthritis in adults when the 
response to previous disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug therapy has been inadequate.  
Adalimumab has been shown to reduce the rate of progression of peripheral joint damage as measured by 
X-ray in patients with polyarticular symmetrical subtypes of the disease (see section 5.1 of the SmPC) 
and to improve physical function.

Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis in adult patients who 
are candidates for systemic therapy. 
Paediatric plaque psoriasis 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of severe chronic plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from 
4 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are inappropriate candidates for topical 
therapy and phototherapies. 
Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of active moderate to severe hidradenitis suppurativa (acne inversa) 
in adults and adolescents from 12 years of age with an inadequate response to conventional systemic HS 
therapy (see sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC). 
Uveitis 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of non-infectious intermediate, posterior and panuveitis in adult 
patients who have had an inadequate response to corticosteroids, in patients in need of 
corticosteroid-sparing, or in whom corticosteroid treatment is inappropriate. 
Paediatric uveitis 
Hefiya is indicated for the treatment of paediatric chronic non-infectious anterior uveitis in patients from 
2 years of age who have had an inadequate response to or are intolerant to conventional therapy, or in 
whom conventional therapy is inappropriate. 
As Hefiya is currently only available as a 40 mg prefilled syringe (PFS) and 40 mg pre-filled pen 
presentation, the Applicant claims the paediatric indications only for paediatric patients, for whom the full 
40 mg dose is appropriate. 
About the product 
Adalimumab, the active ingredient of Hefiya (development code “GP2017”) belongs to the 
pharmacotherapeutic group “immunosuppressants, tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α) inhibitors” 
(ATC code: L04AB04). Adalimumab is a recombinant human immunoglobulin IgG1 type monoclonal 
antibody specific for TNF-α. Adalimumab binds to soluble and membrane associated TNF-α, thereby 
inhibiting the interaction of TNF-α with the TNF-α receptors TNFR1 and TNFR2 and the resulting 
downstream pro-inflammatory cascade of events, which is considered the primary mechanism of action in 
all indications approved for Hefiya. 
Hefiya is presented as a 0.8 mL solution for injection in a single-dose pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen, 
containing 40 mg adalimumab, to be administered via subcutaneous (SC) injection. Hefiya is only 
available as 40 mg pre-filled syringe and pre-filled pen. Thus, it is not possible to administer Hefiya to 
patients that require less than a full 40 mg dose. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
This Marketing Authorisation Application is an abridged application for a similar biological medicinal 
product under Article 10 (4) of Directive 2001/83/EC as amended by Directive 2004/27/EC.  
Similarity is claimed to Humira (adalimumab) as the reference medicinal product, which has been 
marketed in the European Union for over 10 years. Humira 40 mg solution for injection in a prefilled 
syringe was first authorised in the EU on 8 September 2003; the Marketing Authorisation Holder is AbbVie 
Ltd.

2.2.2  Active Substance 
General information 
Adalimumab (also referred to as GP2017) is an IgG antibody composed of two kappa light chains each 
with a molecular weight of approximately 23 kDa and two IgG1 heavy chains each with a molecular weight 
of approximately 51 kDa (glycosylated), forming the typical Y-shape of IgG antibodies.  
Adalimumab binds specifically to TNF and neutralizes the biological function of TNF by blocking its 
interaction with the p55 and p75 cell surface TNF receptors. 
One adalimumab molecule contains a total of four inter-chain and twelve intra-chain disulfide bridges. 
The total molecular weight of adalimumab is 148 kDa (glycosylated). Each light chain consists of 214 
amino acid residues and each heavy chain consists of 451 amino acid residues. In total adalimumab 
consists of 1330 amino acids. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
GP2017 active substance is manufactured according to current Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP) at 
Sandoz GmbH Biopharmaceuticals Schaftenau (BPS), Biochemiestraße 10, 6336 Langkampfen, Austria 
and at Cook Pharmica LLC, 1300 S Patterson Dr., Bloomington, IN 47403, USA. 
Description of the manufacturing process and process controls 
For manufacture of GP2017, a fed-batch process with preceding expansion batches, followed by primary 
separation and a series of purification steps, typical for monoclonal antibodies, including chromatography 
steps as well as virus removal and inactivation steps, has been developed. 
The manufacturing process for the AS has been adequately described. The main steps are fermentation 
(fed-batch), purification (using several chromatographic steps), viral inactivation nano & ultrafiltration, 
filling and freezing.

There are some small differences between the manufacturing process performed at Sandoz, Austria and 
Cook, US. Several small differences between the two processes as technical adaptations are also 
described and considered acceptable, as comparability between these two processes has been 
demonstrated (see Comparability exercise for Active Substance). 
Control of materials 
The applicant is using a two-tiered cell bank system in overall accordance with ICH Q 5B and Q 5D 
guidelines.  Questions raised on the monoclonality of the MCB, use of WCB, and protocol for 
establishment of future WCBs have been resolved during the procedure.  
Details of the various solutions and media used in the manufacturing process are described. Information 
and testing for raw materials are provided. 
The two AS manufacturing sites, Sandoz BPS and Cook, use different raw materials. The specifications of 
the raw materials of the two sites correspond. All raw materials are of non-animal and non-human origin. 
Raw materials used for manufacturing of GP2017 AS are controlled by specifications that assure their 
identity, strength and purity. They are obtained from established suppliers together with a Certificate of 
Analysis. Upon receipt, these products are released according to Pharmacopoeia monographs or internal 
test procedures.  
Container closure system 
The GP2017 AS bulk solution is filled and stored in 2,000 mL Polyethylene tetraphthalate copolymer 
(PETG) bottles, closed with a High density polyethylene (HDPE) screw closure. 
All components are made of well-established materials for the packaging of medicinal products and are in 
line with USP and Ph. Eur. monographs, as applicable. The PETG bottles with their HDPE screw closure are 
irradiation-sterilized and non-pyrogenic. Specifications and technical drawing of the container closure 
system have been provided. The compatibility of the packaging components has been demonstrated and 
potential extractables from the container closure system have been addressed adequately in an 
extractable study and as part of the toxicological assessment. 
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Process controls performed during manufacture of GP2017 AS are categorized either as process 
parameters or as in-process controls. Based on risk assessment and results from process characterisation 
studies, the PPs and IPCs have been classified accordingly. 
A tabulated list all critical and selected key and non-key process parameters and in-process controls of the 
GP2017 AS manufacturing process has been provided by the applicant. Criticality, acceptable ranges and 
justification of ranges are provided and considered appropriate for control of the manufacturing process. 
Process validation 
Process validation was carried out at the Schaftenau site (Sandoz BPS), Austria and Cook Pharmica, 
Bloomington, USA. GP2017 is manufactured in either one of two production lines at different scales in 
building 520 at Sandoz BPS.  
Validation and qualification activities consisted of: 
• 
• 
Consistency validation (process performance qualification) of the GP2017 manufacturing process 
(upstream and downstream process) at manufacturing scale 
Evaluation of clearance capability of process- and product-related impurities

Validation of the transport procedure 
All validation requirements have been fulfilled. The validation program was successful and the entire 
manufacturing process of GP2017 AS at commercial scale is considered to be validated. 
Cook Pharmica: The process validation at Cook Pharmica was carried out on essentially the same 
process, which was implemented at Cook Pharmica with minor adaptations due to the different facility 
set-up. All validation requirements have been fulfilled. Validation of the entire manufacturing process of 
GP2017 AS at commercial scale at Cook, including hold times and transport was confirmed.  
Manufacturing process development 
A process characterisation was conducted in accordance with current ICH requirements including quality 
by design principles. Process characterisation included large scale and small scale data mining, risk 
assessments, and laboratory scale studies. A process risk assessment tool based on FMEA (failure mode 
and effects analysis) methodology was used to assess the process- and product-related risks of the 
GP2017 AS manufacturing process. Based on the outcome of the risk assessment selected process 
parameters were further investigated during experimental process characterisation studies.  
Process characterisation studies were considered adequate to establish a robust process with 
performance and product quality within defined ranges. The classification of the process parameters into 
critical, key, and non-key as well as definition of the respective acceptable ranges was considered well 
justified. The information presented provides sufficient evidence of a consistent and thorough approach in 
terms of control strategy development.  
Characterisation 
AS characterisation included tests for biochemical attributes such as primary structure, higher-order 
structures (secondary and tertiary structures), carbohydrate structure and molecular heterogeneity (e.g. 
by size, charge and hydrophobicity). Other attributes further including product-related substances and 
impurities were also determined. 
For functional characterisation of GP2017, a comprehensive portfolio of cell-based potency assays as well 
as binding assays was used to address the possible modes of action attributed to the adalimumab 
molecule. TNF-α neutralization assay as well as antibody dependent cell mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC), 
complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC), apoptosis inhibition and TNF-binding assays revealed 
comparable results for all GP2017 FP batches analyzed. Furthermore, consistent binding to TNF-α with 
sub-nanomolar KD values, as well as to different human Fc gamma receptors (FcγRs) and human 
neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) could be observed by surface plasmon resonance. 
The AS has been sufficiently characterised by physico-chemical and biological state-of-the art methods 
revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of adalimumab. The analytical results are 
consistent with the proposed structure. Furthermore, heterogeneity of the AS has been adequately 
characterised by analysing size and charge variants, glycosylation, and other product-related substances 
and impurities. Biological characterisation of GP2017 indicates that GP2017 binds to TNF and neutralizes 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 16/128 
 
 
 
 
the biological function of TNF as expected. In summary the characterisation is considered appropriate for 
this type of molecule. 
Specification 
The AS release specifications include tests for general quality attributes, identity and quantity, testing for 
the purity/product- and process related impurities and finally a functional assay for the biological activity.  
The proposed tests are considered appropriate to ensure that only AS of sufficiently high quality will be 
further manufactured to the FP. During the procedure information on the potential impact of 
high-mannoses variants and the level of terminal galactosylation on ADCC activity of GP2017 has been 
requested. The provided data indicates a linear relationship of the high mannose glycan content with 
ADCC. These new data also reflect the current scientific view from publications, which indicate a role of 
Man5 glycans in modulating ADCC activity of IgG1 antibodies.  
Based on these data the Applicant has established an appropriate glycan specification which ensure that 
ADCC activity of GP2017 will fall within the reference range of EU-Humira.  
Acceptable specification limits are in place for the controlled quality attributes. These proposed limits 
appropriately reflect the actual manufacturing capabilities. A justification for each specification limit 
based on pharmacopeial requirements as well as on the actual manufacturing capabilities was presented. 
As requested during the procedure certain specifications including level of residual host cell proteins and 
charged variants have been tightened whereas for the potency an acceptable justification for the initially 
proposed limits has been provided. 
Analytical methods 
Concerning the analytical procedures used for release testing of AS, detailed method descriptions have 
been provided for the non-compendial methods. These descriptions include the method principle but also 
summarize the procedure of the method. 
Bioactivity of GP2017 is assessed with a reporter gene assay (RGA) via measurement of TNFα 
neutralisation. 
Compendial methods are performed according to the respective Ph. Eur. monographs.  
Validation summaries as well as detailed validation reports have been submitted for those methods which 
are not conducted according to the Ph. Eur. The provided validation results indicate that the analytical 
methods for AS release control are suitable for their intended use.  
Batch analysis 
The batch analyses data provided demonstrate that all batches complied with the specifications set at the 
time of testing and thus support the conclusion of the Applicant that the AS manufacturing process can 
perform effectively and reproducibly to produce AS material meeting its predetermined specifications and 
quality attributes.  
Reference Standards 
During early development a sequential reference standard system based on the reference medicinal 
product Humira and early GP2017 AS material has been in place.  
This sequential reference system was then switched to a two-tiered reference standard system comprised 
of an in-house primary reference standard and an in-house working standard. The usage of primary and 
working standards as well as the concept for introduction of future in-house reference standards has been 
briefly outlined. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 17/128 
 
 
 
 
Release and periodical retests for both, the primary reference and the working reference standard have 
been submitted and are considered acceptable. For the primary reference standard a panel of analytical 
methods for additional characterisation has been presented.  
Stability 
The proposed shelf life of Hefiya active substance when stored at the recommended conditions is based on 
long-term stability data. The results demonstrate that Hefiya active substance is stable under the 
recommended conditions. Supporting information on accelerated and stress stability data and data from 
thermal freeze/thaw cycles as well as photo-stability data have been provided. 
Comparability exercise for Active Substance 
The development activities include the initial development of the AS manufacturing process, the following 
scale up and transfer from the pilot scale to the manufacturing scale at different plants and lines.  
Comparability was demonstrated in data between the development / clinical batches and process 
validation batches. Overall it is concluded, that comparability between batches produced throughout 
product development is demonstrated. 
A comparability exercise was executed between GP2017 AS batches produced at Sandoz BPS and Cook to 
assess the effect of the process transfer. The study compared results obtained from routine process 
controls (in-process testing) and batch release testing, in-depth characterisation and stability studies of 
GP2017 AS produced at both sites. All acceptance criteria were fulfilled. 
2.2.3  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
Hefiya FP is formulated as a solution for injection at a strength of 40 mg (40 mg/0.8 mL) for subcutaneous 
administration containing adalimumab as active substance. The solution is clear to slightly opalescent, 
colourless to slightly yellowish. 
Hefiya FP is filled with a 2.5% overfill of the nominal volume which is justified by the dead volume of the 
syringe and the capability of the filling process.  
Hefiya 40 mg solution for injection is supplied in either a single-use pre-filled syringe or a single-use 
pre-filled SensoReady pen. The primary packaging for both prefilled syringe and pen is 1 mL pre-filled 
syringes (clear, class I glass barrel with fixed needle, rigid needle shield, and a Flurotec coated 
bromobutyl plunger stopper) with a nominal fill volume of 0.8 mL.  
Hefiya single-use pre-filled syringe is supplied in a single-use clear type I glass syringe with a rubber 
stopper and a stainless steel needle with an automatic needle guard with finger flange, rubber needle cap 
and plastic plunger, containing 0.8 ml of solution.  
Hefiya single-use pre-filled pen is supplied in a single-use pre-filled syringe assembled into a 
triangular-shaped pen with transparent window and label (SensoReady pen). The syringe inside the pen 
is made of type I glass with a stainless steel needle, an inner rubber needle cap, and a rubber stopper 
containing 0.8 ml of solution. 
The composition of Hefiya FP differs from the reference product Humira with regard to the buffer system. 
All excipients are of compendial quality. Except for adipic acid, which is a known excipient but novel in its 
use in a parenteral formulation, the excipients are widely used in the production of parenteral 
biopharmaceutical products. No excipients of animal or human origin are used. The following excipients 
are used for the composition of Hefiya: Adipic acid, citric acid monohydrate, sodium chloride, mannitol, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 18/128 
 
 
 
 
polysorbate 80, sodium hydroxide (for pH adjustment), hydrochloric acid (for pH adjustment), and water 
for injections. 
The intended commercial formulation is the same as that used during clinical studies. 
The excipient adipic acid has been classified as a novel excipient and the respective data package 
provided. Adipic acid complies with Ph. Eur. 1586 and the information provided on Chemistry, 
Manufacturing, and Control is considered sufficient.  
The quality target product profile (QTPP) of Hefiya FP was defined to guide the biosimilar development 
and target ranges for relevant quality attributes (QA) were derived by testing multiple batches of the 
originator product EU and US Humira using orthogonal state-of-the-art analytical methods which included 
functional bioassays covering Fab and Fc related functions of adalimumab. An extensive set of QA was 
systematically evaluated for their impact on potency, PK/PD, and immunogenicity using a risk ranking 
approach as outlined in ICH Q9 to identify critical quality attributes (CQA) of Hefiya FP.  
Formulation development 
For formulation development a three step screening approach was chosen to evaluate multiple 
buffer/excipient combinations and their impact on selected QA. In addition, compatibility with the final 
primary packaging materials was evaluated. No clear differences were observed for the different 
combinations.  
The use of adipic acid in the commercial formulation has been adequately justified.  
Process development 
The Applicant gained knowledge on Hefiya FP and manufacturing from development and process 
characterisation studies. The studies are considered adequately designed and demonstrate extensive 
process knowledge.  
Standard materials for the primary packaging of medicinal products which are in line with pharmacopoeial 
requirements have been selected for primary packaging of Hefiya FP. Integrity of the container closure 
system and compatibility with the FP and the device parts was adequately demonstrated. Information on 
potential leachables and extractables from the primary packaging and process materials coming into 
contact with the FP has been provided.  
For the administration devices (i.e. prefilled syringe and pre-filled pen) comprehensive technical and 
scientific information has been provided. This included detailed information on design and safety features, 
shelf-life, transport validation, the assembly and packaging process of the combination products including 
IPC and release tests, process validations, functional testing, technical drawings, and a check for 
compliance with the essential requirements/ essential principles as outlined in Annex I of Directive 
93/42/EEC and GHTF/SG1/N68:2012.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacturing process and controls 
Hefiya FP solution for injection is produced using standard manufacturing steps. After preparation of the 
excipient solution, the thawed AS is mixed with the excipient solution. The resulting compounded FP 
solution is subject to a bioburden reduction filtration, sterile filtered and aseptically filled into syringes. 
The stoppered filled syringes are 100% visually inspected, labelled and stored at 2-8°C. After shipment to 
the assembly/packaging site, the labelled PFS are assembled either with NSD or AI and labelled in an 
automated (NSD) or semi-automated (AI) assembly and labelling process, respectively. Packaging of the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 19/128 
 
 
 
 
labelled Medicinal product-device combination into shipping boxes is done manually. The FP is stored at 
2-8°C.  
An FP lot is manufactured from a single AS batch without pooling of different AS batches. The batch 
formula has been provided in the dossier. Unique batch numbers are assigned to the individual batches by 
the material management system which ensures traceability.  
Process parameters and in-process controls with adequate limits have been established for the critical 
process steps which ensure consistent process performance and quality of the FP. The process design as 
well as the process and control limits are appropriately justified and supported by process development, 
characterisation studies and product knowledge. 
A traditional process validation approach was chosen by the Applicant. All analytical data of IPC and 
release testing complied with the specifications valid at time of testing and the proposed commercial 
release specification. The presented analytical data from batch release, IPC testing, and additional 
sampling demonstrate that the manufacturing process is reliable and delivers product of consistent 
quality.  
Hold and process times have been defined and are supported by adequate microbiological and 
physicochemical hold time studies.   
Adequacy of the established shipment conditions was verified by a transport validation study which 
included four shipments of Hefiya FP PFS from Mylan to Cook using qualified shipment containers and 
shippers. A potential impact of mechanical stress on quality and integrity of Hefiya bulk PFS was 
sufficiently addressed by a second transport validation study.  
A continued process verification program is in place to ensure process consistency throughout the 
life-cycle. 
To validate the assembly and packaging process three process runs were performed at Cook for each the 
NSD and AI. The presented AQL, IPC, functional testing and release data demonstrate that the assembly 
and packaging processes produce combination products of adequate quality. Transport validations 
covering the different pack sizes have been conducted. 
Product-related substances and impurities formed in the FP resemble the variants detected in AS and are 
adequately addressed.  
In line with ICH Q8 the established comprehensive control strategy for FP comprises multiple control 
elements and links the control elements to the QA of AS. In summary, the presented control strategy 
address including the relevant FP attributes are considered adequate to ensure consistent quality of 
Hefiya FP. 
The primary container closure system for Hefiya FP consists of a sterile, non-pyrogenic, single use, 
pre-filled syringe (PFS). Representative certificates of analysis for the components, registration of critical 
dimensions of the components, information on control of the silicone oil used as a lubricant and 
confirmation of compliance with relevant ISO standards for the syringe and rubber stopper sterilisation 
processes have been provided.  
The PFS is assembled with either one of two functional secondary packaging components, a plunger rod 
with a needle safety device (NSD) with an add-on finger flange, or an autoinjector pen. Details of these 
devices, including descriptions of components, technical drawings and dimensions, and specifications are 
sufficiently described in Module 3.2.R.

Product specification 
The proposed FP specification includes tests for identity, purity/impurities including microbiological 
attributes, content, potency, and general attributes, and is in line with Ph. Eur. 2031 and 0520 and 
guidelines EMA/CHMP/BWP/532517/2008 and ICH Q6B. The set of analytical methods is considered 
appropriate to ensure that only product of adequate quality will be released to the market. 
The set of analytical methods is considered appropriate to ensure that only product of adequate quality 
will be released to the market. The glycosylation pattern and residual levels of HCP, host cell DNA, and 
Protein A are part of the AS specification and hence testing at FP release is not required.  
In addition to the panel of analytical methods for release testing, the shelf life specification comprises a 
container closure integrity test (CCIT) by dye ingress. Specifications were based on compendial 
requirements, guidelines and manufacturing experience.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and (non-compendial methods) 
appropriately validated in accordance with ICH guidelines. 
Batch analysis 
A considerable number of large scale FP batches have been manufactured using the intended commercial 
process and production line. These batches have been produced for (pre)clinical studies, stability studies, 
and for process validation purposes. All batches complied with the FP specifications. In addition, release 
data for the three validation batches assembled with the single-use pre-filled syringe or SensoReady pen 
are presented and do not give raise to a concern. The batch analyses data of a considerable number of 
batches demonstrate that the manufacturing process reliably delivers consistent and uniform product. 
Reference material 
Hefiya FP the same references materials is used as for the AS. 
Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life of Hefiya FP is 2 years when stored in a refrigerator (2°C–8°C).  
The product should not be frozen and shaken. The product should be kept in the pre-filled syringe / 
pre-filled pen in the outer carton in order to protect from light. 
A single Hefiya pre-filled syringe / pre-filled pen may be stored at temperatures up to a maximum of 25 
° C for a period of up to 14 days. The pre-filled syringe / pre-filled pen must be protected from light, and 
discarded if not used within the 14-day period. 
Real time/real condition stability data from a number of FP batches in PFS and finished dosage form 
batches (autoinjector, needle safety device) including clinical and validation batches have been provided. 
The stability studies were conducted in accordance with ICH guidelines Q1A and Q5C; statistical 
evaluation of stability data was performed according to ICH guideline Q1E. The analytical program 
followed the shelf life specifications and included appropriate stability indicating methods.  
The claimed shelf life of 24 months at 5 ± 3°C including a 14 days period at 25 ± 2°C/ 60 ± 5% is 
supported by the presented stability data. All results were within specification for the proposed storage 
conditions and OOF conditions. It was confirmed that the secondary packaging protects the FP adequately 
against light-induced deterioration. 
Stability of the novel excipient adipic acid (in parental formulations) has been demonstrated in the 
finished product.   Any out of specification result will be reported to the Agency 
Assessment report

Adventitious agents 
Non-viral adventitious agents 
The testing strategy and applied methods for testing for contamination with bacteria, mycoplasma and 
fungi is considered adequate. 
Regarding TSE, no primary animal or human derived raw materials were used during cell banking and 
manufacturing of Hefiya FP.  
Viral adventitious agents 
Cell banks were appropriately tested for potential viral contaminants. In general, the applied test program 
on cell banks is deemed acceptable and in line with ICH Q5A requirements. 
The Company conducted virus validation studies to assess the capacity of the manufacturing process to 
remove/inactivate potential viral contaminants and retroviral particles. The virus validation studies were 
conducted using qualified small-scale models.  
The information on the selection of model viruses is considered adequate.  
Significant log10 reduction values were achieved as presented in the summary of log10 virus reduction 
factors.  
In conclusion the viral safety for Hefiya FP is considered adequately documented and ensured throughout 
the process. 
Biosimilar comparability exercise 
An analytical comparability exercise has been designed as a three-way comparison between EU-Humira, 
US-Humira and GP2017 and included the evaluation of structural and functional comparability of these 
three products.  
The samples were compared head-to-head on the physico-chemical and on in vitro functional biological 
level with respect to quality, safety and efficacy. The test items were compared using a number of 
different/orthogonal physico-chemical and biophysical methods. 
Biochemical attributes such as primary structure, higher-order structures (secondary and tertiary 
structures), carbohydrate structure, heterogeneity (e.g. by size, charge and hydrophobicity) and other 
attributes including product-related substances and impurities were determined. For the final assessment 
the following data have been taken into consideration: 
• 
• 
• 
Historical data of EU-Humira and US-Humira generated during GP2017 development 
Historical data of multiple representative commercial scale GP2017 batches 
Data of head-to-head analyses of six GP2017 FP batches (process validation), and three batches 
of each EU-Humira and US-Humira 
For data evaluation min-max range comparison, mean ± 3SD, and numerical or visual evaluation of data 
and their graphical representations were used in the analytical comparability exercise.  
The analytical comparability exercise is summarised in Table 4.

It is noted that a sufficient amount of EU Humira batches and Hefiya have been used for establishment of 
the biosimilarity ranges.  The respective established ranges as well as the amount of batches can be 
regarded as representative for the quality of the reference product available on the market 
A comprehensive set of analytical methods has been in place for characterisation and comparison of 
physicochemical and biological features of the adalimumab molecule. The methods are considered 
state-of-the art and suitable for the detection of even subtle differences between reference and biosimilar 
product. For most of the investigated quality attributes orthogonal methods have been used for 
characterisation and comparison. In summary, the analytics is sufficient for demonstration of 
biosimilarity and no concerns have been raised in this respect. 
The characterisation of the primary structure is based on  
• 
• 
• 
a comparison of the amino acid sequence with RP-HPLC-UV reducing peptide mapping and 
RP-HPLC-MS/MS orthogonal peptide mapping,  
a comparison of disulfide bonds with non-reducing peptide mapping and LC-MS, and 
a comparison of the content of free thiols with the Ellman’s assay. 
100% sequence coverage of the heavy and light chain was obtained and the results confirm that all three 
products, GP2017, US and EU-Humira, have identical amino acid sequences. The minor difference in the 
content of free thiols is not considered to be relevant, as lower amounts of free thiols lead to a more 
homogenous product, which is considered positive. A slightly reduced level of observed for the biosimilar 
FP batches were appropriately justified.  
Molecular mass and size was compared by

a descriptive comparison of the molecular weight with electrospray-ionization quadrupole 
time-of-flight mass spectrometer (ESI-qToF-MS) and with size exclusion chromatography with multi 
angle laser light scattering (SEC-MALLS)a comparison of high molecular weight variants with size 
exclusion chromatography (SEC) and analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC) 
a comparison of dimers with analytical ultracentrifugation  
a comparison of antibody fragments with size exclusion chromatography and non-reducing capillary 
gel electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulfate (CE-SDS) 
Comparable molecular weights determined for reduced light/heavy chain and the F(ab’)2 and Fc’ 
fragments for GP2017 FP and both, EU and US Humira, confirmed the integrity of the antibody. Slightly 
lower levels of high molecular weight variants have been observed by AUC for some of the investigated 
GP2017 FP batches, whereas in contrast SEC showed slightly higher levels of high molecular weight 
variants in certain GP2017 FP batches. However, the observed differences were considered minor and the 
different outcome when using these two orthogonal methods has been explained. The comparison of EU 
versus US Humira showed comparable levels of high molecular weight variants. Dimers were slightly 
higher in GP2017; however, this minor difference was not considered relevant. The amount of antibody 
fragments was comparable for GP2017, EU and US Humira. 
Purity was assessed by 
• 
• 
a comparison of the monomer with size exclusion chromatography (SEC) 
a comparison of the monomer with non-reducing capillary gel electrophoresis with sodium 
dodecyl sulfate (CE-SDS) 
With both orthogonal methods a comparable purity profile of GP2017, EU and US Humira could be 
demonstrated. 
Glycosylation was assessed by 
• 
• 
• 
a comparison of site occupancy of the Fc-located N-glycan by reducing capillary gel 
electrophoresis with sodium dodecyl sulfate (CE-SDS) 
a comparison of N-glycan galactosylation, non-fucosylated N-glycans and high-mannose 
N-glycans with glycan mapping 
a comparison of glycation with boronate affinity chromatography (BAC) 
Minor differences in the glycosylation site occupancy are not expected to have any impact on the 
biosimilarity claim. No differences were observed between EU and US Humira in terms of glycoforms or 
glycan profiles. However differences have been detected for the content of galactosylated, 
non-fucosylated and high mannose N-glycans: The non-fucosylated N-glycans ranges for all tested 
batches of GP2017 largely exceeded that of of EU Humira  
Concerning the galactosylated glycan variants most of the tested batches of GP2017 exceeded the range 
of EU Humira EU. 
For M5 which represents the major high mannose structure in Humira, all tested batches of GP2017 were 
below the range of EU Humira.  
The differences in galactosylated, non-fucosylated and high mannose N-glycans found between GP2017 
and Humira were not satisfactorily justified in the initial submission. Structure-activity relationship 
studies with varying levels of afucosylated and high-mannose glycan variants have been conducted upon 
request. Based on the data provided during the procedure it was concluded that ADCC activity is impacted 
by high complex type afucosylated glycans, whereas a less significant influence of high mannose type

EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 25/128 
 
 
 
 
glycans on ADCC activity of GP2017 was found. In addition testing a wider range of values indicates a 
more pronounced, linear relationship of the high mannose glycan content with ADCC. These data also 
reflect the current scientific view from publications indicating a role of Man5 glycans in modulating ADCC 
activity of IgG1 antibodies. Notably, despite the observed difference in the Man5 content comparable 
ADCC activity of GP2017 and EU Humira could be established.  
Furthermore, it could be shown that terminal galactosylation has no impact on ADCC activity of 
adalimumab. 
The ranges of glycation determined by BAC are highly overlapping between EU and US Humira. 
Charged variants and their distribution have been characterised by  
• 
• 
• 
a comparison of the sum of acidic and basis variants with cation exchange chromatography 
a comparison of the pI variants with imaged capillary isoelectric focusing (iCE) 
a comparison with two dimensional difference gel electrophoresis (2D-DIGE) 
Overall, the 2D-DIGE image of GP2017 is comparable to the ones generated for EU and US Humira which 
indicates a comparable charge distribution. Also the pI variants were comparable for all three products. 
The sum of acidic variants of many GP2017 batches was below the lower boundary defined by the range 
of EU Humira; the sum of basic variants for most tested GP2017 batches was below the lower limit defined 
by the range of EU Humira, whereas the comparison of EU and US Humira showed comparable results. 
Comparative biological data of the isolated CEX fractions have been provided during the procedure and it 
could be concluded that minor differences in bioactivity do not translate into clinical characteristics of 
GP2017. Furthermore, it could be demonstrated that the differences in basic variants are indeed 
predominantly due to differences in C-terminal lysine. 
Hydrophobicity was investigated by a descriptive comparison with hydrophilic interaction 
chromatography (HIC). The minor differences between GP2017 and Humira were attributed to a 
methionine oxidation and were considered to be irrelevant. 
Amino acid modifications and sequence variants were characterised by 
• 
• 
a comparison of methionine oxidation with reduced peptide mapping in combination with HPLC 
separation and UV detection 
comparison of isomerisation of aspartate residues to iso-aspartate by the ISOQUANT kit 
a comparison of N-terminal pyroglutamate, N-terminal extension, C-terminal lysine, C-terminal proline 
amide and deamidation with reduced peptide mapping LC-MS. The range of oxidation of Methionine 
determined for the GP2017 batches is in general lower than the one of EU Humira. Since 
Methioninoxidation occurs upon aging and stress, a lower amount is considered advantageous. As the 
amount of this variant is extremely low in both products it is not expected that the difference is of any 
relevance.Methionine oxidation in US and EU Humira is comparable.  
For all other investigated amino acid modifications either comparability was shown or differences could be 
sufficiently justified. 
Higher order structures were compared by FT-IR spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, 
differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), 1D 1H nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR), 2 D 
1H-1H NOESY NMR, X-ray crystallography and Hydrogen/deuterium exchange (H/D exchange) combined 
with mass spectrometry. All these methods confirmed a comparable higher order structure of GP2017, EU 
and US Humira. 
Product-related attributes were compared by

• 
a comparison the concentration of active ingredient with UV absorbance 
a comparison of the particulate contamination (visible and sub-subvisible) by visual inspection The 
content was found to be comparable between GP2017 FP and EU Humira as well as between EU and US 
Humira. Results for all samples of all batches tested correspond to the release specifications valid at the 
time of release. GP2017 and both Humira sourced in EU and US are comparable with regards to 
appearance of their containers. GP2017 samples exhibited a lower or equal number of sub-visible 
particles compared to EU Humira EU. EU Humira and US Humira are highly comparable regarding 
particles. 
The biological activity was compared by binding assays as well as by in vitro bioassays.  
The binding assays included 
• 
• 
• 
a comparison of binding to the target by surface plasmon resonance (SPR)  
a head-to-head comparison of binding the Fcγ receptors and the neonatal Fc-receptor with SPR a 
comparison of Off-target binding with SPR  
a comparison of binding to C1q with an ELISA.  
Based on the analysis of EU sourced Humira batches acquired it can be concluded that the range for TNF-α 
is fully indicative of the variability of the EU reference product on the market. 
The side by side comparison of the binding to various Fcγ- as well as the neonatal FcRn receptors 
nevertheless revealed that the generated data does not indicate any significant differences in the above 
mentioned binding characteristics 
Certain differences have been observed for binding to C1q, nevertheless it is agreed with the Company 
that this binding activity is not expected to play a role in the mode of action and thus this difference can 
be considered as irrelevant. All three products are comparable with respect to Off-target binding.  
The functional in-vitro assays included 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
a comparison of TNF-α neutralisation with a reporter gene assay (RGA) 
a comparison of the ADCC with a functional ADCC assay 
a comparison the CDC activity with CDC bioassay 
a comparison of apoptosis with an apoptosis inhibition assay 
a comparison of binding to membrane-bound TNF-α 
TNF-α neutralization activity showed highly comparable results between GP2017 and EU Humira, whereas 
slightly lower activity was found for a very limited number of US Humira batches when  
Of note, a certain shift towards lower ADCC activity values was found for GP2017 compared with EU 
Humira, whereas US Humira was comparable with EU Humira. This minor difference could be justified and 
additional measures to control ADCC activity were agreed during the procedure 
No difference between GP 2017, EU and US Humira with respect to CDC potency and apoptosis could be 
detected. 
A higher variability for GP2017, which led to values outside the established similarity range, was observed 
for binding to membrane-bound TNF-α. Based on the provided data and justification this difference is 
acceptable.  GP2017, EU and US Humira are comparable with regard to apoptotic response.

In addition to the in-depth characterisation, stability studies were performed to investigate long term 
stability behavior of GP2017 FP and Humira EU and Humira US at intended storage condition. 
Furthermore, stability was tested under accelerated and stress storage conditions. The currently available 
stability study data demonstrate comparable stability behaviour for GP2017, EU Humira and US Humira. 
2.2.4  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The Applicant has provided a comprehensive Module 3 within the marketing authorisation application for 
GP2017 as a biosimilar development to its reference product Humira.  
The manufacturing process for AS and FP has been described in sufficient detail; all raw and starting 
materials including the cell banks used in the manufacture of GP2017 are listed identifying where each 
material is used in the process. Information on the quality and control of these materials has been 
provided. All excipients used for FP formulation including the novel excipient adipic acid comply with the 
Ph. Eur. Relevant process controls and in-process controls ensure a consistent routine manufacture of 
GP2017. Process validation supports the conclusion that the manufacturing process for AS as well as for 
FP reliably generates AS and FP meeting its predetermined specifications and quality attributes. The 
provided batch analyses data support this conclusion. Comparability of the GP2017 throughout the 
development has been demonstrated. An appropriate control strategy ensures that material of sufficiently 
high quality will enter the market.  
A biosimilarity programme based on an extensive panel of standard and state-of-the-art methods has 
been conducted to prove similarity for relevant physicochemical and biological quality attributes. For the 
investigated quality attributes either similarity was shown or minor differences seen have been 
appropriately justified. A major concern on the extrapolation claim to other indications raised during the 
procedure could be resolved. A well-structured and comprehensive response document has been 
provided. The additional data sets as well as the provided justifications are reasonable and appropriately 
address the concerns raised.  
Following an inspection conducted in January 2018, the Major Objection concerning the missing GMP 
certificate for the FP manufacturing site Mylan has been fully resolved and a GMP certificate issues for the 
Mylan site provided.  
2.2.5  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following point for investigation: 
• 
• 
To implement release and shelf-life specifications for break-loose and gliding force  
Finalize membrane re-use study at contract manufacturing organization prior to commercial 
implementation. 
2.3  Non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant proposed a non-clinical package comprised a comprehensive panel of in vitro functional 
assays, a single dose PK study in rabbits and a comparative PD study in a mouse model overexpressing 
soluble human TNFα (Tg197 mice), and later also included a toxicological assessment in non-human 
primates. This was discussed in a scientific advice procedure (Procedure No.: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 28/128 
 
 
 
 
EMEA/H/SA/2108/1/2011/III), This proposal was accepted by the CHMP in general, with some 
suggestions with respect to the in vitro bio similarity exercise. 
2.3.1  Pharmacology 
The similarity of GP2017 to the reference product Humira was assessed by a comprehensive panel of in 
vitro assays as well as two comparative in vivo studies in transgenic mouse models overexpressing TNFα. 
The comparative functional in vitro assays cover all relevant effector functions attributed to the Fab- and 
Fc-related pharmacology/mode of action of adalimumab.  
The main mechanism of action of adalimumab, the binding to and neutralization of TNFα, was addressed 
by an SPR assay comparing the binding affinity of GP2017 and Humira, complemented by cell based 
assays (i.e. a TNFα neutralization reporter gene assay and an apoptosis inhibition assay with U937 cells).  
In addition, reverse signalling activity is involved in the immunomodulatory mode of action of 
adalimumab in some indications, according to published evidence. Comparative equilibrium binding to 
membrane bound TNFα was assessed in a cell based competitive binding assay. On- and off-rates were 
not examined (as clarified as part of the EMA Scientific Advice) based on limited feasibility in recombinant 
expression of transmembrane target.  
Overall, all TNFα binding assays showed relatively good comparability for GP2017 and EU- and 
US-licensed Humira, respectively. Fc-related functions were comparatively assessed by a cell-based, 
antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay and complemented by SPR-based assays 
for the high-affinity receptor FcγRIa and the low-affinity receptors FcγRIIa, FcγRIIb/c and FcγRIIIa/b. 
Complement dependent cytotoxicity (CDC) was addressed by cell-based CDC assay and an ELISA-based 
C1q binding assay. 
Moreover, the FcRn binding affinity was assessed for GP2017 in comparison to EU- and US-licensed 
Humira. 
Potential off-target binding of GP2017 and EU- and US-licensed Humira to cytokines structurally related 
to TNFα (TGF-β1, APRIL, IFN-γ, IL-1β, TNF-β, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, sCD40L, BAFF or RANKL) was analysed by 
SPR without revealing any relevant effects. 
In general, the results of the in vitro functional assays demonstrated that all batches of GP2017 met the 
predefined ± 3SD range.  
In support of the in vitro comparability exercise two comparative in vivo studies have been performed in 
transgenic mouse models of rheumatoid arthritis with GP2017 and EU-Humira.  
The efficacy of subtherapeutic doses (3 mg/kg) of GP2017 and EU-Humira on soluble TNF-α was 
investigated in Tg197 mice, with treatment starting shortly after onset of the disease at 6 weeks of age. 
Arthritic scores were evaluated on a weekly basis, histopathology scores after the end of the treatment 
period of 4.5 weeks (9 treatments, i.p.). GP2017 showed similar efficacy as compared to EU-Humira, and 
both treatment groups were significantly different from the vehicle and positive (30 mg/kg EU-Humira) 
controls.  
The second in vivo study utilised Tg5453 mice overexpressing mTNF-α. In order to achieve a preventive 
effect on the disease, treatment with GP2017 and EU-Humira (2.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg) started when 
mice were 2 weeks of age and was continued for 5 weeks. Both, Humira and GP2017, positively influenced 
progression of the disease and revealed statistically significant higher efficacy as compared to the buffer 
controls. However, from the third treatment week onwards a difference in efficacy in favour of Humira was 
observed regarding the in vivo arthritic scores, which resulted in statistically significant differences after 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 29/128 
 
 
 
 
5 weeks of treatment. This observation was confirmed by the histopathology scores evaluated at the end 
of the treatment period. The differences were more pronounced in the high dose group.  
Assessment of the GP2017 batch used in this in vivo study (within the scope of the comparability 
exercise) revealed relatively low ADCC activity (83%) but similar or high CDC (100%), TNFα-binding 
(115%) and TNFα-neutralization activity (91%) as compared to the mean value of the entire range of the 
reference product. Compared to the GP2017 batch, the Humira batch exhibited higher ADCC (107%) and 
CDC activity (111%). Neither of the batches was tested for in vitro mTNFα-binding. 
Based on the additional information provided by the Applicant, the reduced efficacy of GP2017 as 
compared to Humira in the Tg5453 mouse model for RA cannot be attributed to a difference in quality 
attributes analysed within the scope of the comparability exercise. Further elucidation of the difference in 
in vivo efficacy would in involve further animal studies which would not be in compliance with the 
principles of the 3Rs especially in the light of the Tg197 mouse study where similarity regarding in vivo PD 
was successfully demonstrated. Taking into account the limitations of the animal model as well the limited 
significance of in vivo studies as compared to in vitro assays in biosimilar development, this point was 
considered solved by the CHMP. 
The Applicant did not perform any studies on secondary PD or PD drug interactions whereas safety 
pharmacology aspects have been addressed within the scope of the repeat-dose toxicity study. This is in 
line with the both the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal antibodies 
– non-clinical and clinical issues EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and the provided scientific advice 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/70331/2012). Furthermore, the non-clinical data described in the SmPC of Humira 
will be reflected in the SmPC for GP2017. 
2.3.2  Pharmacokinetics 
Comparative PK data were generated in three single-dose studies in New Zealand white (NZW) rabbits 
namely GP17-001 (26024), GP17-004 (8240794) and GP17-007 (28088). In addition, exposure to 
GP2017 was compared with the exposure to EU-Humira in the pivotal 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study 
GP17-002 (8240754) in cynomolgus monkeys. In the latter, serum concentrations upon first and last 
treatments were monitored densely, supported by analysis of trough levels throughout the remaining 
treatment period. The comparative PK studies GP17-004 (8240794) and GP17-007 (28088) and the TK 
study GP17-002 (8240754) were conducted in compliance with GLP. 
All methods of analysis used for the assessment of in vivo PK parameters were sufficiently validated. 
In an early phase formulation screening PK Study GP17-001 (26024) animals were administered with 
seven different formulations of GP2017 and Humira each dose corresponding to 10 mg/kg b.w. The ratios 
of Cmax, AUC0-168h, AUC0-tlast and AUC0-∞ for all formulations to Humira ranged from 0.84-1.07 and 
were, thus, comparable to Humira. The highest exposure to GP2017 was achieved with a formulation 
containing 20 mM adipic acid which was chosen for further development. The actual composition of this 
formulation was 23 mM adipic acid and 1.3.mM citric acid which was revealed only by retrospective 
analysis.  
In a further PK study the selected formulation was tested head to head to Humira® resulting in a 25% 
higher exposure to Humira as compared to GP2017 which was in contrast to the early phase formulation 
study. This was attributed to either the formulation lacking citric acid (it was assumed that the selected 
formulation contained only adipic acid as the retrospective analysis was not performed yet) or to different 
handling of the animals by two different administrators. 
To rule out any uncertainties a third PK study was performed comparing various formulations containing 
citric acid in addition to adipic acid. This study confirmed that the initially chosen formulation containing 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 30/128 
 
 
 
 
23 mM adipic acid and 1.3 mM citric acid is biosimilar to Humira PK with respect to differences in exposure 
of below 5%.  
The TK properties of GP2017 were also determined after single and repeated (once weekly for 4 weeks, 
5 treatments) s.c. dosing to cynomolgus monkeys at the dose level of 100 mg/kg and were compared to 
that of EU-Humira in the GLP-compliant, pivotal 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study. 
The formulation development is considered comprehensive and the nonclinical studies performed for that 
purpose were considered adequate by the CHMP However, they were not comparative in nature and 
therefore cannot be used as part of the comparability exercise to Humira. 
2.3.3  Toxicology 
The toxicology program performed with GP2017 and reference product Humira was part of the 
biosimilarity assessment and included a 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, 
including TK and immunogenicity assessment, a single dose local tolerance study in NZW rabbits, and a 
tissue cross-reactivity study with frozen human tissues. All studies were performed in compliance with 
GLP. 
Single dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, and reproductive and developmental toxicity studies 
were not performed. This is considered acceptable for biosimilar medicinal products. 
The GLP-compliant comparative 4-week (29 days) repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys 
was conducted in order to compare the safety profile of GP2017 to the reference product EU-Humira 
(Study GP17-002(8240754)). Repeated weekly s.c. administrations of 100 mg/kg/week for four 
consecutive weeks without recovery period were applied to 6 animals (3 female and 3 male) per 
treatment group. Observations included the assessment of clinical signs, body weight, food consumption, 
opthalmoscopic examination, body temperature, electrocardiography (ECG), blood pressure, clinical 
pathology parameters, organ weights and anatomic pathology evaluation, as well as evaluation of serum 
levels of adalimumab and ADA determination. The obtained safety profiles of GP2017 and EU-approved 
Humira are highly comparable and no new toxicities were identified for GP2017 as compared to Humira. 
One female monkey presented with an increase in absolute weights of liver, spleen and adrenal glands, 
pale lesions on liver and lung, granulomatous inflammatory areas in the femur, liver, spleen and lung, and 
acid fast bacteria were confirmed within areas in the lung and spleen. The actual mycobacterium 
tuberculosis infection was confirmed by the animal supplier to have occurred also in other animals of this 
one group at the test facility and was thus not regarded to be of toxicological relevance. 
The dose, regimen, duration, and test species for the comparative monkey toxicology study were selected 
to allow detection of any meaningful toxicological differences between GP2017 and EU-Humira. 
The TK profiles of GP2017 and EU-Humira were comparable throughout the duration of the study, but 
slightly higher exposures (AUCs and Cmax) were observed with EU-Humira on day 1 and day 29 in male 
monkeys compared to GP2017. On the other hand, there is a tendency towards females being higher 
exposed to GP2017 compared to Humira on day 1 and day 8. Larger variabilities could be detected for 
tmax throughout the study. The CHMP agreed with the Applicants statement, that due to the low number 
of animals per treatment group limited statistical power needs to be considered. Further, the batch used 
to supply the repeat-dose toxicity study is a preclinical batch produced at laboratory scale only, and 
comparative in vitro study results for target and effector functions are not available. While this of course 
questions the added value of the toxicity study for purposes of examining comparability, clinical PK 
testing is anyway part of the comparability program. 
An ECL bridging immunogenicity assay for the assessment of anti-GP2017/Humira antibodies was 
developed and validated appropriately. No animal was identified to be positive for ADAs. Drug tolerance 
was estimated through spiking samples of polyclonal rabbit ADA in appropriate matrices with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 31/128 
 
 
 
 
adalimumab; however the samples were compared to blanks only, as the cut point was determined from 
pre-dosing serum values in each study. Due to the nature of the ADA response, the ‘true’ value for drug 
tolerance in a given sample is not possible to calculate and thus could be substantially different from the 
calculated value depending on the relative affinities of the antibodies produced and the polyclonal rabbit 
anti-adalimumab antibody used as the positive control in these studies. Furthermore, as the confirmatory 
assay acceptance criteria is set (arbitrarily) at 50% inhibition, and as relatively high concentrations of 
adalimumab were recorded in the repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, there is a 
significant risk of false negative results via this method. 
For the GLP-compliant local tolerance study (Study GP17-008 (30331)) conducted in female NZW rabbits 
to compare the local tolerability profile of GP2017 formulation buffer, GP2017, and EU-Humira (27G and 
29G needle), a single dose of 0.8 mL/injection site was administered either s.c. (intended route), i.a., i.v., 
p.v., respectively 0.5 mL/injection site i.m to 4 animals per treatment group. No treatment-related 
macroscopic or histopathological changes were observed at any of the injection sites or with any 
formulation tested. Thus, GP2017 is considered to be well-tolerated. 
A GLP-compliant tissue-cross reactivity study was conducted to assess potential off-target binding of 
GP2017 to human tissues (Study GP17-005(824079)). No unexpected off-target staining was observed in 
any of the human tissues examined. 
2.3.4  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
According to the CHMP Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) of Medicinal Products for 
Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr 2) for products containing vitamins, electrolytes, amino 
acids, peptides, proteins, carbohydrates and lipids as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), an ERA should 
be provided. This ERA may consist of a justification for not submitting specific ERA studies. 
According to Directive 2001/83/EC, applicants are required to submit an ERA also for applications under 
Art 10(4) similar biological applications. However, the ERA dossier may consist of an adequate 
justification for the absence of specific study data. The justification of the absence of significant increase 
of the environmental exposure, demonstrated by suitable information, can be accepted as a justification 
for the absence of a complete ERA. 
The Applicant provided sufficient documentation to justify that specific studies on environmental 
exposure are not required. The applicant concludes that the use, storage and disposal of GP2017 will not 
significantly alter the concentration or distribution of the substance, its metabolites or degradation 
products in the environment. No changes in the environmental risks that are not already identified for 
adalimumab are to be anticipated. 
The Applicant’s approach was agreed by the CHMP. 
2.3.5  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant provided a comprehensive panel of in vitro pharmacology studies in order to demonstrate 
comparability of GP2017 to the reference product Humira. The in vitro studies are considered suitable to 
investigate the reported main mechanism of action, i.e. neutralization of and binding to soluble and 
membrane-bound TNFα, respectively. Additional assays covering Fc-related functions were performed. In 
summary, GP2017 proved to be biosimilar to the reference product Humira with respect to all biological 
function parameters.  
In vivo pharmacology studies were performed in two different murine models for RA. In the Tg197 mouse 
strain, which overexpresses soluble TNF-α, comparable efficacy of GP2017 and Humira with respect to 
inhibiting disease progression could be demonstrated. In contrast, in the Tg5453 strain, which 
overexpresses membrane-bound TNFα, efficacy of GP2017 was clearly inferior as compared to the 
Assessment report

reference product. Based on the additional information provided by the Applicant, the reduced efficacy of 
GP2017 as compared to Humira in the Tg5453 mouse model for RA cannot be attributed to a difference in 
quality attributes analysed within the scope of the comparability exercise. Further elucidation of the 
difference in in vivo efficacy would involve further animal studies which would not be in compliance with 
the principles of the 3Rs especially in the light of the Tg197 mouse study where similarity regarding in vivo 
PD was successfully demonstrated. Taking into account the limitations of the animal model as well the 
limited significance of in vivo studies as compared to in vitro assays in biosimilar development, this point 
was considered solved by the CHMP. 
The Applicant did not perform any studies on secondary PD, safety pharmacology or PD drug interactions. 
This is in line with the both the Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing monoclonal 
antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010) and the scientific advice 
received for GP2017 (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/70331/2012). 
Single dose in vivo pharmacokinetics studies for the purpose of formulation development of GP2017 were 
performed in NZW rabbits. These studies were well conducted; however, they were not comparative in 
nature and therefore cannot be used as part of the comparability exercise to Humira.  
In a 4-week repeat-dose toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, which included also TK and 
immunogenicity assessment, no compound-related adverse effects of GP2017 in comparison to Humira 
were observed. The toxicology program performed with GP2017 and the reference product Humira 
further included a single dose local tolerance study in NZW rabbits and a tissue cross-reactivity study with 
frozen human tissues. All studies were performed in compliance with GLP. 
The Applicant did not submit specific ERA studies but provided sufficient documentation to justify that 
specific studies on environmental exposure are not required which is in line with EMA Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00 corr. 
2). The applicant concludes that the use, storage and disposal of GP2017 will not significantly alter the 
concentration or distribution of the substance, its metabolites or degradation products in the 
environment. No changes in the environmental risks that are not already identified for adalimumab are to 
be anticipated. The Applicant’s approach was agreed by the CHMP. 
2.3.6  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The Applicant provided a comprehensive panel of in vitro pharmacology studies in order to demonstrate 
comparability of GP2017 to the reference product Humira. Biosimilarity could be demonstrated for all 
parameters of biological function.  
With respect to in vivo PD data, GP2017 showed good comparability to EU Humira for the mode of action 
exerted via soluble TNF-α. However, in vivo assessment of PD effects linked to membrane-bound TNF-α 
revealed inferiority of GP2017 as compared to Humira. Taking into account the limitations of the animal 
model as well the limited significance of in vivo studies as compared to in vitro assays in biosimilar 
development, this point was considered solved by the CHMP.  
Toxicology data did not show any differences between GP2017 and Humira.

2.4.2  Pharmacokinetics 
PK biosimilarity between Humira and GP2017 was investigated in study GP17-101/GP17-104 and in the 
efficacy and safety study GP17-301. Further comparative PK data were generated in study GP17-102 (to 
describe PK of GP2017 after administration by AI versus PFS) and in study GP17-103 (to demonstrate PK 
biosimilarity between GP2017-Schaftenau and GP2017-Cook material from two drug substance 
production facilities). 
Analytical methods 
PK Assays 
The Applicant developed a sandwich ELISA to quantify adalimumab in human serum. To ensure that the 
method is suitable for its intended purpose, the method was validated in line with the Guideline on 
bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP//192217/2009). The lower and upper limits of 
quantification are 0.25 µg/mL and 8 µg/mL, respectively.  
For the quantification of adalimumab in human serum of patients with psoriasis, essentially the same 
method as for the quantification of adalimumab in human serum of healthy adults is used. 
Overall, the method validation was appropriately conducted and all relevant parameters were considered 
for method validation.  
Immunogenicity testing 
The Applicant submitted a well-structured set of immunoassays to detect anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) 
against GP2017 and Humira. A multi-tiered approach was used for the immunogenicity assessment in the 
PK studies GP17-101, GP17-102, GP17-103, GP17-104 in healthy subjects and in study GP17-301 in 
patients with psoriasis. This included a validated bridging immunogenicity assay for the screening and 
confirmation of binding ADAs, followed by a validated competitive ligand binding assay for the 
assessment of the neutralizing capacity of antibodies. 
Overall, the validation of the immunogenicity assays was appropriately conducted.

Clinical PK studies 
Study GP17-101 (EudraCT Number: 2012-004205-27) 
Study GP17-101 was a randomized, double-blind, 3-arm parallel group phase I study conducted in 
healthy male and female volunteers.  
Figure 1 - Design Study GP17-101 
A total of 219 healthy subjects aged 18 to 55 years were enrolled (144 male and 75 female subjects); 73 
subjects in each of the three treatment groups. In each group, all subjects received a single dose of 
adalimumab and were then observed for 72 days during which the PK, safety, tolerability, and 
immunogenicity measurements were made.  
The primary objective was to demonstrate PK comparability of GP2017, EU-authorized and US-licensed 
Humira in terms of Cmax, AUC0-inf and AUC0-last (9 comparisons) after a single 40 mg SC injection.  
Equivalence was based on the 90% CIs for the ratio of geometric LS Means of the primary variables, which 
should be contained within the pre-specified acceptance range of 0.8 to 1.25.  
The study failed to demonstrate PK biosimilarity between GP2017 and EU-authorized Humira as well as 
between EU- and US-licensed Humira, as the upper limits of the 90% CIs of the ratios of geometric means 
(GM) for the primary PK endpoints AUC0-last and AUC0-inf were above 1.25. Relevant results are 
displayed below:

licensed) 
The key secondary end-point of AUC0-360h was met and was within the pre-specified range of 0.8-1.25. 
Descriptive statistics for other secondary end-points were also provided and in many cases proved similar 
across all 3 arms. However for AUC extra and Kel, a greater than 20% difference was observed between 
the highest and lowest geometric mean value across all three arms.  
Inter-individual variability was higher than expected. Sample size calculation was based on a CV of 31% 
for AUC0-last based on historical literature; however, CVs for AUC0-last were approx. 10 % higher. While 
no root cause for the negative outcome of study GP17-101 could be identified, other reasons than the 
observed larger inter-subject CV for AUC0-last cannot be excluded. 
The impact of ADA formation on adalimumab exposure levels following administration of single-doses was 
investigated and an impact was noted. In keeping with published data on Humira, smaller AUC0-last and 
AUC0-inf values were observed in ADA positive subjects compared to ADA negative subjects in all three 
treatment arms. 
Study GP17-104 (EudraCT Number: 2015-000579-28) 
The study was a single-center, randomized, double-blind, parallel group PK study with three treatment 
arms to evaluate PK, safety and immunogenicity of GP2017, EU-Humira and US-Humira in 318 healthy, 
adult, male subjects. Randomization was stratified by body weight categories of 50.0 to 64.9 kg, 65.0 to 
79.9 kg and 80.0 to 95.0 kg. Two subjects discontinued the study prematurely.

Figure 4 – Design - Study GP17-104 
The primary objective was to demonstrate PK biosimilarity (90% CI of ratio of geometric means within the 
margins of [0.8; 1.25]) for GP2017 and EU-Humira, and PK biosimilarity for EU-Humira and US-Humira in 
terms of Cmax and AUC0-inf (4 comparisons) after a single s.c. injection of 40 mg/0.8 mL of adalimumab 
to healthy adult male subjects. 
Compared with study GP17-101 the study design was adapted in several aspects: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
restriction to only two co-primary endpoints (Cmax and AUC0-inf) 
increase of sample size 
pre-specification of descriptive comparison of AUC0-last and AUC0-inf for ADA positive and ADA 
negative subjects 
several restrictions with respect to baseline characteristics of the subjects, e.g. only male sex 
A concern was raised regarding the blinding of the study GP17-104, since ‘the identity of the study 
treatments could not be concealed as the appearance of the syringes differed’ due to use of commercially 
available PFS of reference product. Unblinded study site personnel not involved in any further study 
assessments administered treatments, whereas in study GP17-101 IMP was blinded at the pharmacy due 
to transfer to non-commercial tuberculin syringes. Blinding of subjects was maintained in study GP17-104 
by requesting the subject “to turn his head and look in an opposite direction or to firmly close his eyes or 
by using an eye mask or a separation/dividing wall”. Although PK levels are the key parameter of this 
study and are not impacted by the potential source of subjects’ unblinding, the possible impact on study 
outcome in terms of safety was considered. 
Results: 
For the comparison GP2017/EU-Humira, the point estimates of the ratios of the geometric LS means for 
Cmax and AUC0-inf were around 1 and the corresponding 90% CIs were entirely contained within the 
pre-specified margin of 0.8 – 1.25.

Point estimates for Cmax and AUCinf were consistently slightly greater than 1.0 in both trials GP17-101 
and GP17-104, for GP2017 versus EU Humira. Additional sensitivity analyses were conducted taking the 
following factors into account: 
- No covariate in the statistical model 
- Body weight category as covariate in the statistical model 
- BMI as covariate in the statistical model 
- PK parameters adjusted for protein content dose received by the subject 
- included all subjects for AUC0-inf (i.e. include all subjects regardless of %AUCextra value, adjusted 
correlation coefficient (R2 adj<0.75) values, and number of data points used in the terminal phase)

- excluding subjects based on %AUCextra value >20%, adjusted correlation coefficient (R2 adj<0.85) 
values, and number of data points used in the terminal phase. 
The 90% CIs of the ratios of the geometric LS means were contained within the margins of 0.8 to 1.25 for 
Cmax and AUC0-inf (for both comparisons GP2017/EU-Humira and EU-Humira/US-Humira). It can be 
concluded that the above named factors did not have an impact on biosimilarity outcome.   
Secondary endpoints (AUC0-360h, t1/2, tmax, %AUCextra, tmax, CL0-last and Kel) are roughly 
comparable across treatment arms. Results for t1/2 and tmax differ from results observed in study 
GP17-101. 
In the body weight sub-group analysis, for the majority of the comparisons in medium and high body 
weight categories, the 90% CIs of the ratios of the geometric LS means were contained within the 
margins of 0.8 to 1.25. While for the low body weight category, the majority of the 90% CIs of the ratios 
of the geometric LS means were not contained within the margins of 0.8 to 1.25.  
Pooled analysis of studies of PK data - exploratory analysis  
A number of pooled analyses with the objective of comparing the exposure across GP2017, EU-Humira 
and US- Humira using a larger sample of PK data include a number of post-hoc pooled analyses of PK 
bioequivalence results from studies GP17-101, GP17-102, GP17-103, and GP17-104.  
However, the study level data (from GP17-101 and GP17-104) should not be pooled and analysed. The 
level of additional relevant information coming from pooled PK (or meta-) analysis is considered limited, 
given the heterogeneity described for the two PK trials. 
Impact of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics (study GP17-101 and 
GP17-104) 
The majority of healthy volunteers developed antibodies from Day 16 on. ADA formation was shown to 
have an impact on exposure, as in ADA positive subjects, smaller AUC0-last and AUC0-inf values were 
observed compared to ADA negative subjects, in all HV studies. 
In study GP17-101, GP2017 shows a higher exposure in terms of AUC0-inf compared to EU-authorized 
Humira in both subgroups. Sub-group analyses demonstrated comparability for GP2017/EU-Humira only 
in ADA-positive subjects. Comparability for GP2017/US-Humira was only demonstrated for ADA-negative 
subjects, while comparability for EU-Humira/US-Humira was not demonstrated for any ADA sub-group 
analysis.  
In study GP17-104, GP2017 shows a higher exposure in the ADA negative subgroup (as also seen in the 
overall population) compared to EU-Humira, but a lower exposure in the ADA positive subgroup compared 
to EU-Humira. Results of the sensitivity analysis for the primary endpoints Cmax and AUC0-inf for both 
ADA-subgroups however support PK comparability between GP2017 and EU-Humira, given that the 90% 
CIs of the ratios of the geometric LS means were contained within the pre-specified PK comparability 
margin of 0.8-1.25 in each subgroup and included 1.  
Pharmacokinetics in target population (study GP17-301) 
The applicant also evaluated Ctrough levels of GP2017 and EU-/US-authorised Humira in its pivotal 
efficacy trial GP17-301 in all patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis at the 
following time points: at weeks 3, 7, 11, 17, 23, 29, 35, 41, 47 and 51. Steady state seems to be reached 
by week 3 (first measurement of Ctrough levels). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 43/128 
 
 
 
 
Overall, 11 patients had pre-dose concentrations of adalimumab at baseline, which might be due to 
previous anti TNFα therapy of these patients, as the bioanalytical test was sensitive to any anti TNFα 
antibody. Sensitivity analyses were performed excluding those 11 patients and were the one provided in 
the study report. 
For 7 sites, no or incomplete temperature log data were available, therefore a post hoc sensitivity analysis 
excluding PK data of these sites was performed, which showed similar results to the primary analysis.  
Some PK and ADA samples had experienced temperature excursions during storage. The presented 
partial validation studies indicate that PK and ADA samples are stable for up to 84 days when stored at the 
unintended storage condition (i.e. ≤-1°C instead of the required ≤-20°C), therefore the experienced 
temperature excursions during storage are not considered to impact the study outcome.

Means of concentration levels were higher for GP2017 compared to Humira from the first measurement at 
week 3 onwards. This trend was observed throughout the whole study period 1 (see Figure 9 and Table 
10).  
Continuous group 
Figure 8 - Arithmetic mean (SD) adalimumab serum concentration versus time by continued 
group – randomization to week 51 (SAF) 
In the continuous group (excluding patients with pre-dose concentrations), Ctrough levels were also 
higher in the GP2017 arm compared to the Humira treatment arm. This difference was observed 
throughout the whole study period.  
The applicant has provided as requested post-hoc descriptive analysis of the adalimumab serum 
concentrations for efficacy study GP17-301 as supportive to the PK studies. In Treatment period 1, the 
lower side of the 90% CI is contained within the 80% limit while for the upper 90% CI for 3 of 4 
time-points breaches the 125% limit. For the entire study, the majority of the lower intervals are met 
while the majority of the upper intervals are not met. Whilst the number of subjects with evaluable serum 
trough concentration data (values ≥250 ng/mL) decreased during the course of the study, even by week 
7, with nearly all patients evaluable, bioequivalence was not met. However this study was not powered to 
demonstrate PK comparability and these results should be considered descriptive in nature.

Encouragingly, across all groups, mean adalimumab trough serum concentrations were within the ranges 
(approximately 5000 to 10000 ng/mL) given in the Humira SmPC. 
Study GP17-102 (comparison AI vs. PFS) (EudraCT Number 
2014-002879-29) 
Study GP17-102 was a single-center, randomized, open-label, single-dose, two-arm parallel study. 
Figure 9 - Study GP17-102 
The primary objective was to describe the PK of GP2017 administered by AI or a PFS as a single SC 
injection of 40 mg to healthy adult male subjects with body weights between 50.0-94.9 kg in terms of the 
PK parameters Cmax and AUC0-360h.  
Randomization was stratified by body weight. A total of 108 subjects were randomized in the study. 
The study was not powered for formal equivalence testing. There were four weight categories (ranging 
from 50 to 140 kg) and overall one primary weight group (weight categories from 50 to 94.9 kg) upon 
which the analysis of the primary endpoint was based.

Table 10 - Summary statistical analysis – primary and secondary PK parameters (total PK 
analysis set; 50.0-140.0 kg body weight group) 
As can be seen from the tables above, for the primary body weight group (50-94.9kg), the 90%CIs for the 
ratios of geometric means between treatment groups were contained within 0.8-1.25 for the primary 
endpoints Cmax and AUC0-360h, as well as for the secondary endpoints AUC0-last and AUC0-inf. 
In this weight group, the additional secondary endpoints were comparable between treatment arms 
except for tmax and t1/2. In light of the high variability of these measures, the observed differences in 
tmax and t1/2 between treatment arms are not considered to impact the comparability conclusion 
between PFS and AI. 
Geometric LSmeans for Cmax and AUC0-360 are slightly lower for AI compared to PFS, whereas 
geometric LSmeans for AUC0-last and AUC0-inf are slightly higher for AI compared to PFS (total PK 
analysis and medium body weight group). Exposure seems roughly comparable over time and this applies 
to all weight categories. 
In the high and very high body weight group, all named endpoints show a trend of lower exposure of AI 
vs. PFS. In the low body weight group, Cmax and AUC0-360h show higher values for AI vs PFS and lower 
values for AUC0-last and AUC0-inf for AI vs PFS.  
Concomitant medications were higher in the AI arm (30%) than for the PFS arm (17%). The main 
difference between the treatment groups was due to paracetamol. The number of patients taking 
paracetamol is higher than in other studies. Paracetamol is unlikely to have any effect on PK. 
The impact of ADA formation on adalimumab exposure levels was investigated and a strong impact was 
noted. In ADA positive subjects, smaller AUC0-last and AUC0-inf values were observed compared to ADA 
negative subjects in both treatment arms. AUC0-last and AUC0-inf values were comparable in ADA 
negative and ADA positive subjects using the AI or the PFS, respectively.  
Study GP17-103 (comparison GP2017-Cook versus -Schaftenau) (EudraCT 
Number 2014-005229-11) 
The GP17-103 study was planned to complement the analytical data supporting comparability between 
drug substances manufactured at the manufacturing site Sandoz GmbH, Biopharmaceuticals Schaftenau 
(referred to as GP2017- Schaftenau) (BPS) in Langkampfen, Austria to the manufacturing site Cook 
Pharmica (referred to as GP2017- Cook), LLC, in Bloomington, IN, USA, and thus, to establish both sites 
as drug substance manufacturing sites. For both sites, drug substance was formulated and processed to 
drug product at Mylan, India. Of note, drug substance of all GP2017 batches used in the other clinical PK 
studies and the confirmatory efficacy and safety study GP17-301 had been manufactured at Schaftenau

Austria. The GP2017 drug product batch used in study GP17-104 was the same as the 
GP2017-Schaftenau batch in study GP17-103 (batch number 7007467). 
The primary objective of this study was to demonstrate PK biosimilarity (90% CI of the ratio of the 
geometric means within the margins of [0.8;1.25]) of GP2017-Cook and GP2017- Schaftenau in terms of 
Cmax, AUC0-inf, and AUC0-last after a single s.c. injection of 40 mg adalimumab to healthy adult male 
subjects.  
The primary endpoints, blood sampling time points, study population (healthy male volunteers), study 
duration (72 days) and study design (single dose [40 mg], double-blind, two-arm parallel group) are 
appropriate and not further commented. Comments made for study GP17-101/-104 apply also to this 
study. Demographic and other baseline characteristics were comparable across treatment arms.  
Overall, 178 subjects were randomized in this study. Randomization was stratified per treatment group 
by body weight.

As can be seen from the table above, the ratio of the geometric means for the primary endpoint Cmax 
(GP2017-Cook/ GP2017-Schaftenau) was 1.0322 with a 90% CI of (0.9692; 1.0993) and was hence 
contained within the (0.80-1.25) bioequivalence limits.  
However, in terms of AUC0-inf and AUC0-last, PK biosimilarity between GP2017-Cook and 
GP2017-Schaftenau was not demonstrated.  Analyses of Cmax, AUC0-inf, AUC0-last and AUC0-360h 
were repeated by body weight category. For medium body weight subjects, comparability was only 
demonstrated for Cmax, while for high body weight subjects, comparability was only demonstrated for 
Cmax and AUC0-360h. Secondary endpoints (AUC0-360h, tmax and AUCextrapolated [%]) were 
comparable across treatment arms. CL0-last and T1/2 slightly differed between treatment groups.  
Three subjects had pre-dose concentrations above LLOQ (250.0 ng/ml) (n=2, GP2017-Schaftenau; N=1, 
GP2017-Cook group). The results from the sensitivity analysis excluding these subjects were comparable 
to the results from the primary analysis (negative outcome for AUC0-inf and AUC0-last). 
A higher proportion of subjects in the Schaftenau group had an extrapolated part of AUC0-inf >20%: n=6 
(9.5%) in GP2017-Cook vs n=15 (16.9%) in GP2017-Schaftenau group. The Applicant argued that this 
might have contributed to the observed results. A post-hoc analysis was performed excluding subjects 
with <3 data points in the terminal phase or with extrapolation of the terminal phase >20%. Although the 
90% CIs of the ratio of the Geometric LS mean (Cook vs. Schaftenau) were contained within the BE limits 
(0.8-1.25) in this sensitivity analysis, it is not fully understood, why this imbalance in the extrapolated 
part of AUC0-inf was observed.   
Results of this clinical PK study are difficult to interpret, given that batches from different manufacturing 
sites were manufactured by the same processes and comparability between batches from different 
manufacturing sites seems to have been adequately demonstrated at the quality level.  
One notable omission from the list of quality attributes which could impact PK is the neonatal Fc receptor 
(FcRn). Increased binding to this receptor is known to prolong IgG half-life. Based on the data provided in 
the biosimilarity report, the FcRn equilibrium dissociation constants for these batches were 1.09 10-7M 
and 1.06 10-7M respectively. The difference between them is relatively minor therefore if can be 
concluded that differences in FcRn are unlikely to be responsible for the lack of bioequivalence. 
The exclusion of 3 extreme ADA titres is somewhat rationalised, although a higher occurrence of extreme 
ADA titers in the Cook treatment arm could also be suggestive of “true” differences between treatments. 
It is noted that when all PK set subjects were included, the AUC0-inf upper side of the 90% CI was 1.255, 
very close to the bioequivalence limit of 1.25.  
Although the primary endpoint for AUC0-inf was not met for study GP17-103, the applicant has adequately 
demonstrated that this is likely due to differences in immunogenicity and not likely due to product-related 
differences as demonstrated by the primary end-points being met for Cmax and AUC0-360, which are not 
influenced by late ADA formation (refer to “Impact of immunogenicity on PK”).  
Impact of immunogenicity on PK 
Subgroup analyses were performed for ADA negative and ADA positive subjects. 
In the ADA negative subgroup, the 90% CIs of the ratios of the geometric means were contained within 
the bioequivalence limits (0.8 to 1.25) for AUC0-inf and AUC0-last. 
In ADA-positive subjects, the 90% CIs for the ratios of the geometric means between GP2017-Cook and 
GP2017-Schaftenau were above the bioequivalence limits for both AUC0-inf and AUC0-last.The 90% CI of 
the geometric means ratio of AUC0-inf was contained within 0.8-1.25 in an exploratory analysis excluding 
those subjects with high ADA titers (4 subjects in the Schaftenau and 1 subject in the Cook group). Some 
Assessment report

uncertainty remains, as e.g., a higher occurrence of extreme ADA titers in the Schaftenau treatment arm 
could also be suggestive of “true” differences between treatments. 
Overall, PK biosimilarity in terms of AUC0-inf and AUC0-last could not be demonstrated between 
GP2017-Cook and GP2017-Schaftenau. The applicant plausibly attributed the failure of the study to 
demonstrate bioequivalence between GP2017-Schaftenau and GP2017-Cook to the unexpected higher 
rate of immunogenicity in GP2017-Schaftenau treated subjects, which impacted the demonstration of PK 
similarity for PK parameters affected by ADA development for AUC0-inf and AUC0-last. Although the 
difference in the total % of ADA positive subjects in study GP17-103 was minimal (4.1%) between the two 
different treatment arms, the rate of formation of ADAs differed by a maximum of 10.7% (day 30) 
between the two different treatment arms for study GP17-103 and differed by a maximum of 16.6% (day 
44) for the same batch of GP2017-Schaftenau in studies GP17-103 and GP17-104. Thus the rationale that 
differences in immunogenicity resulted in a failure to demonstrate bioequivalence for AUC0-inf is plausible 
and together with the totality of the data and the lack of quality concerns over batches produced at the 
different manufacturing sites, this response is acceptable. 
Reference is also made to section 2.6 Clinical safety, immunological events. 
2.4.3  Pharmacodynamics 
No clinical comparative PD study was submitted by the applicant. No accepted specific pharmacodynamic 
(PD) markers exist, being predictive of efficacy of adalimumab in patients. PD similarity of GP2017 and 
Humira in terms of TNF-α inhibition has been investigated in non-clinical in-vitro and in-vivo similarity 
studies.  
HsCRP (High sensitivity C-reactive protein) was among the biochemistry parameters investigated in study 
GP17-301 up to Week 51. There were no notable differences between the treatment groups, except for 
one patient that had an abnormally high level of hsCRP at week 17 with Humira treatment. This patient 
developed a high CRP value due to necrotizing pneumonia and sepsis and the patient was discontinued 
from treatment. Pneumonia and sepsis are both considered expected according to the Humira SmPC. 
With the exception of this patient, CRP levels appear similar across all treatment groups. 
2.4.4  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Healthy volunteers studies GP17-101 and GP17-104 
Study GP17-101 was conducted in healthy volunteers to establish comparability between GP2017 and 
EU- as well as US-licensed Humira in terms of Cmax, AUC0-inf and AUC0-last after a single SC dose of 40 
mg. The study failed to demonstrate PK biosimilarity between GP2017 and EU-authorized Humira, as well 
as between EU- and US-licensed Humira, for the primary PK endpoints AUC0-last and AUC0-inf.  
For secondary end-points AUC extra and Kel parameters there is a considerable (>20%) difference 
between the highest and lowest geometric mean values across the three arms. These differences are 
consistent with the study results, i.e. failing to meet its primary end-points. 
An extensive root cause investigation was performed as requested to identify possible sources driving the 
negative outcome of the first PK study GP17-101: batch selection (EU- and US-Humira), IMP storage and 
transport, IMP preparation, IMP administration, PK sampling, PK sample shipping and testing, impact of 
body weight on PK, impact of ADA development on PK and impact of other subject characteristics (e.g. 
medical history) were investigated. No root cause driving the negative outcome of study GP17-101 could 
be identified. 
The applicant also examined the clinical trial batches with regard to quality attributes which could 
potentially impact the PK (such as dose strength, Man5, Met256 oxidation and the glycovariants bGo, bG1 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 51/128 
 
 
 
 
and gG2), and satisfactorily discussed observed quality differences potentially influencing PK. None of 
them appears to be responsible for the differences in PK between GP2017 and EU-Humira in study 
GP17-101. 
The subsequently planned study GP17-104 incorporated an adapted study design with the aim to reduce 
inter-subject variability (by BMI-restriction and inclusion of only male subjects) and with an increased 
sample size (based on an observed inter- individual variability of 42% for AUC0-inf in study GP17-101, 
which was higher than assumed at the planning stage). Also, IMP handling and dosing was simplified by 
using the GP2017 PFS and the commercial PFS for EU- and US-Humira. 
For both primary PK endpoints, AUC0-inf and Cmax, the 90% CIs of the ratios of the geometric means 
between GP2017 and EU-Humira and between EU-Humira and US-Humira were contained within the 
pre-specified PK comparability acceptance limits; all point estimates were close to unity. These results 
were confirmed by further supportive analyses including an analysis that included all AUC0-inf values. The 
secondary endpoints AUC0-360h, t1/2, tmax, %AUCextra, tmax, CL0-last and Kel were also roughly 
comparable across treatment arms.  
When viewed in separation, results from study GP17-104 support biosimilarity in terms of 
pharmacokinetics. Point estimates for Cmax and AUCinf were consistently slightly greater than 1.0 in both 
trials GP17-101 and GP17-104, for GP2017 versus EU Humira.   
Similarity of GP2017 and Humira is furthermore supported by the PK data from the efficacy and safety 
trial GP17-301 (adalimumab Ctrough levels), which seem overall comparable for Humira and GP2017 
(although means of concentration levels were slightly higher for GP2017 compared to Humira troughout 
the whole study period). 
Due to confirmed heterogeneity between both PK studies the pooled analysis that the Applicant had 
initially submitted is not considered informative. 
The Applicant considers study GP17-104 a more sensitive and more relevant study model to detect 
potential differences between biosimilar candidate and reference product owing to the above mentioned 
study design adaptions. It is acknowledged that gender- and BMI-range restrictions were implemented in 
study GP17-104 as variance-reducing measures in reaction to the outcome of study GP17-101. In the 
context of adalimumab biosimilar exercises, inclusion of only male subjects for investigation of PK 
similarity is in general accepted and not criticized per se. The Applicant argued that variability in exposure 
may be higher in women than in man due to changes in female plasma water content during the 
menstrual cycle and that therefore women were not included in the second trial. This justification was 
endorsed by the CHMP. Indeed, by reducing the variance in the PK read-out, it can indeed be expected 
that the signal/noise ratio may be increased within the trial setting. 
As regards the interpretation of the outcome of GP17-101, the Applicant’s understanding is shared that 
the trial failed to demonstrate PK equivalence and that non-rejection of the null-hypothesis in this case 
does not necessarily imply the existence of a relevant PK-difference.  
Overall, the results of the larger study GP17-104 in a more homogenous population can be accepted as 
supporting PK similarity of GP-2017 and EU-Humira, and also establishing the PK bridge between EU- and 
US-Humira. 
Impact of immunogenicity on pharmacokinetics (study GP17-101 and GP17-104) 
The majority of healthy volunteers developed antibodies from Day 16 onwards. ADA formation was shown 
to have an impact on exposure, as in ADA positive subjects, AUC0-last and AUC0-inf values were lower 
compared to ADA negative subjects. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 52/128 
 
 
 
 
PK data in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis 
The Applicant also evaluated Ctrough levels of GP2017 and EU-/US-authorised Humira in the 
efficacy/safety trial GP17-301 in all patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.  A 
trend towards higher Ctrough levels of GP2017 versus Humira was observed.  
Given the high variability of the Ctrough measurements (in part caused by ADA development in a 
proportion of patients) this difference would be unlikely to be clinically meaningful. 
PK similarity of PFS and autoinjector 
Study GP17-102 was a two-arm parallel study to describe the PK, safety and immunogenicity of a single 
SC injection of GP2017 administered by AI or by PFS to adult male healthy subjects. The study was not 
powered for formal equivalence testing; Cmax and AUC0-360h were assessed as primary endpoints. 
There were four weight categories (ranging from 50 to 140 kg) and overall one primary weight group 
(weight categories from 50 to 94.9 kg) upon which the analysis of the primary endpoint was based.  
For the primary weight group, PK similarity was shown for the primary endpoints Cmax and AUC0-360h. 
Secondary endpoints were supportive of PK similarity between AI and PFS in this weight group. Exposure 
seems relatively comparable over time and this applies to all weight categories. In the high and very high 
body weight group, all named endpoints show a trend of lower exposure of AI vs. PFS. In the low body 
weight group, Cmax and AUC0-360h show higher values for AI vs. PFS and lower values for AUC0-last and 
AUC0-inf for AI vs. PFS.  
Conclusions to be drawn from this study are limited due to lack of power.  
PK similarity of drug substance GP2017-Cook versus GP2017-Schaftenau 
Study GP17-103 was a two-arm parallel trial to determine the PK, safety and immunogenicity of GP2017 
from two drug substance production facilities following a single SC injection in healthy male subjects. The 
primary endpoints were Cmax, AUC0-inf, and AUC0-last.  
The CI of the ratio of the geometric means for the primary endpoint Cmax (GP2017-Cook vs. 
GP2017-Schaftenau) was contained within the standard bioequivalence limits. However, in terms of 
AUC0-inf and AUC0-last, PK biosimilarity between the two sites could not be demonstrated. Exposure 
(AUC0-inf) of adalimumab was higher after administration of GP2017-Cook compared to 
GP2017-Schaftenau. A trend for lower exposure of GP2017 (Schaftenau) in study GP17-103 compared to 
the other HV studies (GP17-101, -104 and -102) using the same product was noted. 
Subgroup analyses were performed for ADA negative and ADA positive subjects. In the ADA negative 
subgroup, BE criteria were met for AUC0-inf and AUC0-last. In ADA-positive subjects however, the 90% 
CIs for the ratios of the GMs between GP2017-Cook and GP2017-Schaftenau were above 0.8 to 1.25 for 
both AUC0-inf and AUC0-last. 
Overall, although PK biosimilarity in terms of AUC0-inf and AUC0-last could formally not be demonstrated 
between GP2017-Cook and GP2017-Schaftenau, the applicant has adequately demonstrated that this is 
likely due to differences in immunogenicity and not likely due to product-related differences as 
demonstrated by the primary end-points being met for Cmax and AUC0-360, which are not influenced by 
late ADA formation. 
2.4.5  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Study GP17-101 failed to demonstrate PK biosimilarity between GP2017 and EU-authorized Humira, as 
well as between EU- and US-licensed Humira, for the primary PK endpoints AUC0-last and AUC0-inf. 
Assessment report

Ultimately, neither for the comparison GP2017/EU-Humira nor for the comparison EU-/US-Humira a clear 
reason/driving source for the observed differences in PK parameters in study GP17-101 was identified. 
However, that variability was reduced in the second PK study GP-104 and that biosimilarity was shown for 
all PK parameters and all comparisons.  
Considering results from study GP17-104 showing PK comparability between EU- and US-Humira, it can 
be concluded that the scientific bridge between EU-/and US-sourced Humira has been established.   
Auto-injector and pre-filled syringe showed relatively comparable PK results with regard to their exposure 
over time in the primary weight category. Conclusions to be drawn from study GP17-102 are limited due 
to lack of power.  
Comparability of drug substance derived from two drug substance production facilities (Cook vs. 
Schaftenau), although demonstrated on the quality level, could not formally be shown in study GP17-103 
in healthy volunteers. The failure to demonstrate bioequivalence between GP2017-Schaftenau and 
GP2017-Cook was likely due to the unexpected higher rate of immunogenicity (not likely to be product 
related) in GP2017-Schaftenau treated subjects, which impacted the demonstration of PK similarity for PK 
parameters affected by ADA development (AUC0-inf and AUC0-last). 
2.5  Clinical efficacy 
GP2017 has been developed as a biosimilar to US-licensed Humira and EU approved Humira. Efficacy data 
have only been provided by the confirmatory efficacy and safety study GP17-301 in patients with 
moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. 
2.5.1  Main study GP17-301 
Methods 
GP17-301 study design: 
This study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, comparator-controlled, confirmatory efficacy 
and safety (Phase III) study to assess equivalent efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the proposed 
biosimilar GP2017 and Humira (adalimumab) after 17 weeks of treatment in patients with moderate to 
severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.  
The study consisted of four periods: the Screening Period (at least 2 weeks and up to 4 weeks prior to 
dosing), Treatment Period 1 (Randomization to Week 17), Treatment Period 2 (Week 17 to Week 35), and 
the Extension Period (Week 35 to Week 51). Please also refer to the table and figure below for further 
details on study design.

Study Participants  
The patient population consisted of adult male and female patients who were at least 18 years of age with 
active, but clinically stable, moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. Eligible patients had to 
have a PASI score of at least 12, an IGA score of at least 3 and a total BSA of minimally 10%. The inclusion 
and exclusion criteria describe a study population equivalent to the population for which Humira is 
approved. 
The population is regarded as sensitive enough for the assessment of biosimilarity. Patients were 
recruited in the US and in the EU. For the population´s baseline characteristics, please refer to the section 
below. 
A study in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis is ongoing and the final study CSR is 
planned for September 2018. 
Treatments 
The proposed biosimilar GP2017 and Humira (US-Humira for patients recruited in the US and EU-Humira 
for patients recruited in the EU) was supplied to the investigators in prefilled syringes containing 40 mg of 
the active ingredient in a 0.8 mL solution.  
All test materials were supplied by Novartis Drug Supply Management. The batch numbers for both 
GP2017 and Humira are presented below.  
Table 13  - Study medication batch numbers 
One patient received expired study medication during the study. 
The dose and route of administration are in accordance with the current labels of US- and EU-Humira for 
the therapy of moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. 
Objectives 
The objective of the first treatment period was to confirm equivalent efficacy, and similar safety and 
immunogenicity of the proposed biosimilar GP2017 and Humira. The main objectives of the second 
treatment period (Week 17 to Week 35) and the extension Period (Week 35 to Week 51) were to compare 
long-term safety and immunogenicity and to explore effects of repeated switching of both study 
treatments.

Outcomes/endpoints 
The Primary Endpoint was defined as the PASI75 response rate at Week 16, i.e. the proportion of patients 
achieving a reduction of 75% or more of the PASI score at Week 16 compared with baseline. An 
equivalence margin of 18% was chosen.  
The key secondary efficacy variable was defined as the %-change from baseline in PASI score up to Week 
16. The key secondary efficacy variable was analyzed using MMRM and ATE with ANCOVA analysis. An 
equivalence margin of 15% was chosen.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints included Response Rates in PASI50, PASI75, PASI90, and PASI100, 
absolute and percentage change in PASI scores, proportion of IGA responders, as well as health-related 
quality of life assessments. Evaluation of these endpoints was done every other week until week 17 and 
every 6 weeks thereafter until week 51, and results were consequently presented over the whole 
treatment period. 
Additional PASI analyses were provided in response to the EMA D180 List of Questions: absolute change 
in PASI score from baseline to Week 16, absolute PASI scores at week 16, and PASI assessments at week 
13 (PASI75 response rate, absolute change from baseline in PASI score). 
Sample size 
The sample size calculation for the study was based on response rates reported in two earlier 
double-blind, placebo controlled studies with adalimumab for PASI75, i.e. the REVEAL study (Menter A, 
Tyring SK, Gordon K, et al (2008) Adalimumab therapy for moderate to severe psoriasis: A randomized, 
controlled phase III trial. J Am Acad Dermatol; 58(1): 106-15) and the CHAMPION study (Saurat JH, 
Stingl G, Dubertret L, et al (2008) Efficacy and safety results from the randomized controlled comparative 
study of adalimumab vs. methotrexate vs. placebo in patients with psoriasis. In similar populations, the 
following response rates for PASI75 after 16 weeks of treatment were observed: Adalimumab 40 mg 
every other week:  REVEAL: 71.0% (578 out of 814 patients) vs. placebo: 6.5% (26 out of 398) and 
CHAMPION: 79.6% (86 out of 108 patients) vs. placebo: 18.9% (10 out of 53).  
Based on these observed effect sizes of 64.5% (REVEAL) and 60.7% (CHAMPION) at Week 16, an 
equivalence margin of 18% was chosen so that GP2017 maintains more than 70% of the treatment effect 
seen for Humira. A response rate for the originator product Humira of 72% was assumed. Therapeutic 
equivalence in terms of PASI75 was planned be concluded if the exact confidence interval for the 
difference in the PASI75 rates was completely contained within the interval [−18%; 18%]. 
A Statistical Analysis Plan was planned to be set up for the analysis comparing US-licensed Humira to all 
available GP2017 patients using a 90% confidence interval. Another Statistical Analysis Plan was planned 
to be written to compare pooled Humira patients (US-Humira and EU-authorized Humira) to all GP2017 
patients using a 95% confidence interval for EU submission purposes. Based on the above described 
assumptions, using a 95% confidence interval, a sample size of approximately 448 patients (to maintain 
380 evaluable patients with an assumed drop-out and major protocol deviation rate of 15%, assuming a 
difference between treatments of 3%, was derived, providing a power of 90% to show equivalence 
between GP2017 and Humira. 
Randomisation 
Overall, 448 patients were planned to be randomized into the study. Patients were randomized at 73 
study centers in the EU and the US. Patients who dropped out after they had been randomized were not 
replaced. A screen failure rate of 20% and a post-randomization dropout rate of 15% were anticipated.

In Treatment Period 1, eligible patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio into either the GP2017 or the 
Humira treatment group. Randomization was stratified by body weight (measured during the 
randomization visit), prior systemic psoriasis therapy, and region.  
Only patients who achieved at least a PASI50 response at Week 16, qualified for proceeding into 
Treatment Period 2. At Week 17, the continuing patients of both treatment groups were re-randomized 
each in a 2:1 ratio to either remain on their initial study treatment (groups 1a and 2a) or to receive 
GP2017 or Humira treatment during 3 alternating periods of 6 weeks each up to Week 35 (groups 1b and 
2b). The re-randomization was stratified by region only. 
The Extension Period started at the time point of the Week 35 study drug administration, and ended at 
Week 51. During this period, the patients continued with the same study treatment as in Treatment 
Period 1. 
Efficacy analyses were planned to be performed including stratification factors. During the course of the 
study/dry runs it was noticed that some patients had been incorrectly stratified. Therefore where a 
patient was assigned to the incorrect stratification factor during randomization, for all statistical analyses 
the patient was planned be analyzed using the correct true stratification factor based on the clinical 
database rather than the assigned factor.  
For the efficacy analysis comparing GP2017 and Humira in the pooled dataset (combined US & EU), region 
was planned to be included in the statistical models.  
Blinding (masking) 
According to the Applicant, the identity of the study treatments could not be concealed, since the 
appearance of the syringes used to administer GP2017 or Humira differed. To ensure blinded treatment 
of the patients, patients were asked not to look at the syringes during study drug administration. To 
maintain the blind of the assessing investigator, independent, unblinded study site personnel not involved 
in the study assessments handled and administered the study treatment. 
Randomization data were not accessible by anyone involved in the study with the exceptions described in 
this section. 
A blinded/unblinded team charter and tracker were prepared to provide an unblinding plan and to 
describe the processes to control access to unblinded confidential information. After all patients who had 
continued in the study after Week 17 had completed or discontinued early from Treatment Period 2 and 
the Extension Period, the database of the study was finally locked and the sponsor was fully unblinded to 
the study drug assignment. 
After the database had been locked for the final Week 51 analysis, the patients, investigator staff, and 
persons performing the assessments at the sites were also allowed to be unblinded. 
Unblinding was only permitted in the case of patient emergencies, for specific sponsor personnel involved 
in the Treatment Period 1/Week 17 analysis, and at the conclusion of the study.

Full analysis set (FAS) 
The FAS was planned to consist of all randomized patients to whom study treatment had been assigned. 
Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients were planned to be analyzed according to the treatment 
assigned at randomization. 
Treatment Period 2 and Extension FAS (TP2+EP FAS) 
The TP2+EP FAS was planned to include all patients who were re-randomized into Treatment Period 2. 
Following the intent-to-treat principle, patients will be analyzed according to the treatment assigned at 
re-randomization. 
Extension Period FAS (EP FAS) 
The EP FAS was planned to include all patients who entered into the Extension Period. Following the 
intent-to-treat principle, patients were to be analyzed according to the treatment assigned at 
randomization. The EP FAS was foreseen be used for summary of patient disposition in Extension Period 
only. 
Per-protocol analysis set for Treatment Period 1 (PPS) 
The PPS was planned as the subset of the FAS consisting of patients who complete the study up to Week 
16 and have no major protocol deviations up to and including Week 16. Discontinuations due to 
unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (Lack of Efficacy) up to and including Week 16 were planned to be 
included in the PPS as non-responders provided they had received at least 4 weeks/2 doses of treatment. 
Patients who completed Treatment Period 1 but failed to meet the entry criteria for Treatment Period 2 - 
and therefore discontinued the study – were planned to be included in the PPS. 
During the Week 17 Analysis BDRM meetings the following additional criteria were defined that would 
additionally lead to exclusion from the per-protocol analysis set: 
• 
• 
• 
Patient must have a PASI score at baseline/Randomization visit 
Treatment compliance: patient must have had at least 9 (40 mg) doses of study treatment during 
Treatment period #1 and must have had the Week 15 dose 
PASI score to be used as primary endpoint must be within 14 days after Week 15 dose 
•  2 Patient un-blinded prior to Week 16 would be excluded from PPS 
Per-protocol analysis set for Treatment Period 2 and Extension PPS (TP2+EP PPS) 
The TP2+EP PPS was planned as a subset of patients of the TP2+EP FAS, consisting of patients who 
completed the study until Week 51 or who completed TP1, TP2, and post-treatment follow-up period as 
per applicable protocol version (i.e. protocol versions before amendment 3), and had no major protocol 
deviations or additional criteria (re-randomization criteria and treatment compliance criteria) during the 
study. Discontinuations due to unsatisfactory therapeutic effect (Lack of Efficacy) during TP2 and EP were 
to be included in the TP2+EP PPS. TP2+EP PPS was be used for the analysis of secondary objectives in TP2 
and EP, and for the analysis of secondary objectives in entire study. 
Safety analysis set for Treatment Period 1 & entire study (SAF) 
The SAF was planned to consist of all patients that received at least one dose of study treatment during 
Treatment Period 1. Patients were to be analyzed according to treatment received.

Detailed data descriptions were planned for disposition, demographics and baseline characteristics, 
including medical history. All study treatment and concomitant medication data was planned to be 
summarized using the SAF and TP2 & EP SAF. 
Primary efficacy comparison 
The following statistical hypotheses were defined to assess equivalence between GP2017 and US-Humira 
or GP2017 and Humira in the PASI 75 response at Week 16, and these were to be tested at the 5% level 
for GP2017 versus US-Humira or 2.5% level for GP2017 versus Humira: 
H0: |pGP2017 – pHumira| ≥0.18   versus   H1: |pGP2017 – pHumira| <0.18 
where px denotes the proportion of PASI 75 responders at Week 16 for treatment group x. 
Therapeutic equivalence in terms of PASI 75 was planned to be determined if the exact 95% confidence 
interval for GP2017 versus Humira for the difference in the PASI 75 rates was contained within the 
interval [−18%; 18%]. The primary analysis was planned to be performed adjusting for stratification 
factors (body weight, prior systemic treatment and region) using Logistic Regression. Covariate-adjusted 
difference in proportions and corresponding two-sided 95% confidence interval for the difference using 
Logistic Regression were planned to be presented. 
Logistic regression model (using PROC LOGISTIC) was supposed to include following terms: Treatment 
group, and body-weight category (“<90 kg” or “≥90 kg”), prior systemic therapy (“no prior systemic 
therapy” and, “any prior systemic therapy”), and region (“US” or “EU”) as factors in the model. The delta 
method was used to calculate a standard error for the difference and an associated confidence interval 
using a statistical code in SAS for the implementation of the method (method details and code are 
referred from Ge M, Durham LK, Meyer RD, et al (2011): Covariate-adjusted difference in proportions 
from clinical trials using logistic regression and weighted risk differences. Drug Information Journal; 
45(4): 481-93). 
The analysis of the primary endpoint was planned to be based on the PPS. No imputation of missing data 
were seen required for the primary endpoint analysis, as by definition no patient in the PPS analysis set 
were expected to have missing data for the primary endpoint.  
As a supportive analysis, the primary analysis was to be repeated on the FAS. For this analysis based on 
the FAS, missing values with respect to response variables based on PASI score will be imputed with 
non-response regardless of the reason for missing data (e.g. premature study discontinuation, missed 
visit, administrative issues). 
The SAP described several other supportive (sub-group) analyses for the primary variable, including 
dedicated analyses to explore the impact of the randomization errors concerning stratification, and to 
investigate consistency of primary efficacy outcome in sub-groups of strata defined.

Secondary efficacy comparison 
Key secondary variables were planned to be analyzed on the PPS and the FAS.  
Therapeutic equivalence in terms of relative change from baseline in PASI score until Week 16 was 
planned to be determined if the exact 95% CI for GP2017 versus Humira for the difference is contained 
within the interval [−15%; 15%]. An MMRM model was used with treatment group, visit, 
treatment-by-visit interaction and body-weight category, prior systemic therapy and region were to be 
fitted as factors and baseline score for the PASI was to be fitted as a continuous covariate.  
The mean Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of change from baseline in PASI between Week 1 and 16 was 
to be evaluated. The ATE was planned to be derived for each patient and then analyzed as a stand-alone 
endpoint to capture the overall difference between treatment groups. The ATE was defined as the average 
of percent change from baseline in PASI scores at Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 and 16. This parameter 
is the weighted average (weights based on the time intervals between two consecutive visits in weeks) of 
the relative response to treatment. The ATE analysis was planned to be performed using ANCOVA (PROC 
MIXED).  
All secondary efficacy variables were planned to be analyzed on the PPS or TP2+EP PPS analysis set. In 
addition, summaries were to be provided for the FAS or TP2+EP FAS. 
Safety analyses 
Standard descriptive statistical approaches were planned in the SAP for (comparative) evaluation of 
safety. AEs were coded using MedDRA coding dictionary (Version 19.0). For PK and PD data, summary 
and plots of mean PK concentrations by visit were planned to be provided. For these analyses the SAF was 
planned to be used primarily.

Results 
Participant flow and data sets analysed 
Figure 12 - Patient disposition 
The PPS data set was considered as the primary efficacy analysis set to demonstrate equivalence, with 
supportive analyses performed with the FAS. This is endorsed; however assessment of therapeutic 
equivalence equally focuses on the results both data sets. 
The PPS data set for the TP1 – Randomization to week 17 (with primary analysis at week 16) consisted of 
197 patients for GP2017 and 196 patients for Humira. The corresponding figures for the FAS were 231 
and 234, respectively.

Table 14 - Summary of analysis sets during treatment period 1 – study GP17-301 (FAS) 
For TP2, only PASI50 responders were re-randomized, leading to the exclusion of 23 patients (GP2017: 
12 patients; Humira: 11 patients) from re-randomization. The exclusion of non-responders is acceptable 
and the proportion of these patients is balanced between treatment arms. 
As longitudinal analysis of continuous efficacy outcomes is crucial for demonstration of biosimilarity, focus 
of assessment also lies on those patients who continuously received either GP2017 or Humira. Figures for 
the continued groups (TP2+EP) are shown in the following table:  
Table 15  - Summary of analysis sets during treatment period 2 and extension period by 
continued treatment group – study GP17-301 (TP2+EPFAS) 
Recruitment 
Overall, 448 patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis were planned to be 
randomized into the study. Patients were screened at 76 and randomized at 73 study centers in Bulgaria, 
France, Slovakia, and the US. 
It was initially planned to recruit patients at approximately 50-100 study sites worldwide and to use 
US-Humira as comparator product for patients in the US and EU-Humira for patients recruited outside the 
US. 
The first interpretable results from the phase I PK study (GP17-101) showed that GP2017 was 
bioequivalent to US-Humira. However, bioequivalence could formally not be shown between GP2017 and 
EU-Humira and between US-Humira and EU-Humira with regard to the AUC parameters, even though no 
relevant differences concerning safety and immunogenicity were observed between the 3 products. As 
EU-Humira is a well-established treatment of psoriasis with known efficacy and safety and no safety and 
immunogenicity issues were observed for GP2017, the study recruitment was continued in the 3 already 
activated countries (France, Bulgaria and Slovakia). The recruitment in Europe was to be capped at 90 
patients due to the shift of enrolment to the US. This was not planned to influence the total planned 
number of patients to be recruited (n=448).

Conduct of the study 
Protocol deviations 
The proportions of patients with protocol deviations were similar across treatment groups, on an overall 
level as well as by category, in treatment period 1 and 2.  
Major protocol deviations were defined as deviations which could have an impact either on the primary 
and key secondary objectives for TP1 only and/or for further secondary objectives during TP2 and EP. 
Major deviations led to exclusion of patients from the PPS, which is endorsed. No remarkable difference 
between treatment arms was observed. 
Other important protocol deviations: 
• 
Thirty five (35) patients (15.2%) in the GP2017 group and 40 patients (17.1%) in the Humira 
group had been incorrectly stratified for weight and prior systemic therapy in IRT. Statistical analyses 
were primarily performed using the correct stratification factor based on the clinical database rather than 
the IRT-assigned factor. 
• 
Eighteen (18) patients were dosed with study medication (GP2017 or Humira) that had 
experienced a temperature excursion. These patients were not excluded from PPS or TP2+EP PPS. 
Sensitivity analyses of the primary and key secondary analyses were performed excluding the 15 patients 
from site 1218. 
• 
Three hundred and sixty eight (368) patients achieved PASI50 at Week 16 and 379 patients were 
re-randomized into Treatment Period 2. This difference of 11 patients can be explained by 13 patients 
who were re-randomized in error at Week 17 and 2 other patients with PASI50 response discontinuing 
from the study at Week 17. 
Baseline data 
In the reference treatment arm, EU- and US-Humira were used for patients recruited in the EU or in the 
US, respectively. Following a protocol amendment, treatment of patients with EU reference product was 
restricted to 44 patients, while US-Humira was used in 190 patients. 
Demographics and baseline disease characteristics 
Demographic and disease characteristic information was presented separately for both regions:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 64/128 
 
 
 
 
Table 16  - Baseline characteristics of patients in GP17-301 study by region and treatment 
group (FAS) 
Baseline characteristics provided in table above indicate that there are relevant differences between both 
regions´ patient populations, e.g. in hand and feet involvement at baseline (4% vs. 45%, respectively), 
body weight (85 kg vs. 95 kg, respectively), duration of psoriasis (18 y vs. 15–16 y, respectively), mean 
baseline PASI score (22 vs. 20, respectively) and rate of prior systemic treatment (55% vs 42%, 
respectively). The latter three baseline disease characteristics could be the consequence of the 
EU-Humira label at the time of study set-up in 2013, approved at that date as 2nd line treatment (in 
contrast to US-Humira). This might have led to recruitment of a somewhat different patient population in 
the EU compared to the US, as reflected by longer duration of psoriasis, a slightly higher mean baseline 
PASI score, and a higher rate of prior systemic treatment. 
Concomitant medication 
Data about prior and concomitant medication were presented for the SAF. 
Concomitant medication was allowed according to predetermined criteria. Comparative data between the 
groups indicate that non-restricted concomitant treatments were mostly balanced between the GP2017 
and Humira arms. A slight imbalance was noted in the frequency of concomitant treatment with ibuprofen 
(17.3% vs. 9.9% for GP2017 and Humira continuous arms, respectively). 
Prohibited medication was broadly defined in the clinical study protocol and included medication with an 
active ingredient in the class of biologic immunomodulating therapy, other systemic immunomodulating 
therapy, other systemic psoriasis treatments, photochemotherapy, phototherapy, topical steroids or 
other topical treatment that is likely to impact signs and symptoms of psoriasis. Overall only 3 patients 
received prohibited medication between randomization and the primary efficacy assessment at week 16 
and no impact on efficacy in these patients has been observed.  
A higher proportion of patients took concomitant medication in US region compared to the EU region. 
However, within the regions, prior and concomitant medications were overall balanced between the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 65/128 
 
 
 
 
 
treatment arms. Focusing only on patients recruited in the US (based on which the conclusion on 
equivalent efficacy is drawn), a numerical difference was detected with regard to the percentage of 
patients taking concomitant medication: 78.7% vs. 69.5% for the GP2017 and Humira groups, 
respectively. This difference could mainly be attributed to ibuprofen and acetylsalicylic acid use (17% vs. 
11.1%; and 11.7% vs. 7.4% for both medications and groups, respectively). The clinical impact of this 
slight imbalance is regarded as marginal by the CHMP. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Efficacy Analysis 
Comparison GP2017 vs. Humira (pooled) 
For the primary endpoint analysis, the 95% CI for the difference in the PASI75 response rates at Week 16 
(GP2017 – Humira) was contained within the interval [-18%; 18.

Table 19 - Primary endpoint analysis by region: logistic regression analysis on PASI75 
response at week 16 – GPS2017 vs. Humira – study GP17-301 (PPS) 
Subgroup analyses - pooled analyses 
For bodyweight group <90 kg or ≥90 kg and prior systemic therapy no or yes, the adjusted response rates 
each were similar across groups, but due to the low number of patients in these subgroups, the analyses 
were not powered for the formal treatment comparisons and are therefore considered descriptive. 
The results of the supportive analyses in ADA negative patients also corroborated the primary analysis. 
The adjusted response rates at Week 16 in ADA positive patients were lower than in ADA negative 
patients, but similar across groups: 42.8% vs. 39.2% for GP2017 and Humira, respectively. Criteria for 
equivalence were not met (upper margin of the CI of the difference: 25.28). However, the analysis was 
not powered for the formal treatment comparison and is therefore considered descriptive. Furthermore, 
results analysing patients with ADA positive samples at week 3/7/11 are in favour for GP2017. Of note, 
these results are only representative for the region pooled data. No information about the impact on ADA 
status on efficacy in EU patients is available. Due to the very limited number of patients in the EU, further 
analyses in this direction would be inconclusive. 
Additional supportive analyses 
According to the Applicant, the following additional supportive analyses corroborated the main treatment 
comparison results: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
analysis of patients enrolled in the US, 
analysis of ADA negative patients at baseline, 
analysis using assigned stratification factors as per IRT, 
analysis excluding patients with pre-dose serum adalimumab concentration values, 
analysis excluding patients dosed with study drug that had experienced a temperature excursion, 
and 
analysis excluding patients enrolled at site 1268. 
For the following analyses there was a similar trend in adjusted response rates between treatment 
groups, but the numbers of patients were low and therefore results should be interpreted with caution:

Subgroup analyses - pooled analyses 
For bodyweight group <90 kg or ≥90 kg and prior systemic therapy no or yes, the LS means each were 
similar across groups, but due to the low number of patients in these subgroups, the analyses were not 
powered for the formal treatment comparisons and are therefore considered descriptive. 
The results of the supportive analyses in ADA negative patients and ADA positive patients corroborated 
the primary analysis. The LS means up to Week 16 in ADA positive patients were lower than in ADA 
negative patients, but similar across groups. However, due to the low numbers of patients in this 
subgroup, the analysis was not powered for the formal treatment comparison and is therefore considered 
descriptive.

Secondary Analyses 
Secondary Endpoints included Response Rates in PASI50, PASI75, PASI90, and PASI100, absolute and 
percentage change in PASI scores, proportion of IGA responders, as well as health-related quality of life 
assessments. 
Evaluation of these endpoints was done every other week until week 17 and thereafter every 6 weeks 
until week 51, and results were presented over the whole treatment period.  
As for the primary and key secondary efficacy analyses, it was requested to complement the presented 
data with results only for the EU region, i.e. separating the regions also for the test arm and not pooling 
those patients together in one analysis.  
PASI50, PASI75, PASI90, and PASI100 response rates 
EU and US regions pooled:  PASI response rates in the PPS were similar over time across treatment 
groups. Up to Week 16, the adjusted response rates for all evaluable assessments were similar and their 
95% CI margins each within [-18%, 18%]. PASI response rates in the TP2+EP PPS were also similar over 
time across continued and switched groups. The analysis on the FAS was consistent with the results in the 
PPS.

Design 
This study was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, 
comparator-controlled, confirmatory efficacy and safety (Phase III) study 
to assess equivalent efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of the proposed 
biosimilar GP2017 and Humira (adalimumab) after 17 weeks of treatment 
in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. In 
addition, the long-term effects including safety and immunogenicity up to 
Week 51 and the effect of repeated switching between GP2017 and Humira 
were to be analyzed. 
In this study US-licensed Humira was used to treat patients enrolled in the 
US and EU-authorized Humira was used to treat patients enrolled in the EU.

2.5.2  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Efficacy data have been provided from a randomized, double-blind, multicentre study GP17-301, 
intended to demonstrate similar efficacy and to compare safety and immunogenicity of GP2017 and 
Humira in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis.  
As part the EMA Scientific Advice (EMEA/H/SA/2108/1/2011/III), the Applicant was originally planning to 
perform the confirmatory study in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis. Based on CHMP 
and FDA interaction the approach was adapted and psoriasis was selected as the indication, in which to 
demonstrate similarity of GP2017 with Humira.  
In general, the study is adequately designed for a biosimilar exercise and consistent with the study aim. 
The focus of assessment for a MA in the EU is on patients who continuously received the biosimilar product 
or Humira.  
The patient population consisted of adult male and female patients with active, but clinically stable, 
moderate-to-severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. Eligible patients had to have a PASI score of at least 
12, an IGA score of at least 3 and a total BSA of minimally 10%. The selected population is considered 
sensitive to detect differences in efficacy. 
Patients were recruited in the EU and in the US. US-Humira was used as comparator product for patients 
in the US and EU-Humira for patients recruited outside the US. However, recruitment in Europe was 
capped at 90 patients and enrolment shifted to the US. This did not influence the total planned number to 
be recruited (n=448).  
For the primary and key secondary objective to be met, equivalence had to be demonstrated for both 
treatment comparisons: comparing all Humira and GP2017 treated patients (EU and US region pooled), 
as well as comparing patients treated with US-Humira (in the US region) and patients treated with 
GP2017 (EU and US region pooled).  
The primary endpoint was defined as the PASI75 response rate at Week 16; with an equivalence margin 
of 18%. The key secondary efficacy variable was defined as the %-change from baseline in PASI score up 
to (i.e. averaged over time points) Week 16 and was analysed using MMRM and ATE with ANCOVA 
Assessment report

analysis. An equivalence margin of 15% was chosen. Secondary endpoints included Response Rates in 
PASI50, PASI75, PASI90, and PASI100, absolute and %-change in PASI scores, proportion of IGA 
responders, as well as health-related quality of life assessments. 
With regard to the primary endpoint, the use of a continuous variable (absolute PASI score) would have 
been preferred. The defined margin is considered rather wide and an earlier time point could have been 
more sensitive to detect differences between treatments. While the key secondary endpoint represents a 
continuous variable, which is in principle endorsed, it is expected to provide limited additional insight in 
the evaluation of equivalent efficacy due to the statistical methodology chosen. Evaluation of other 
secondary endpoints was done in regular time intervals from randomization until end of study, which is 
strongly endorsed. The CHMP concluded that the definition of the endpoints was not optimal, but 
acceptable. 
Overall, the design of the study was considered appropriate for a biosimilar setting by the CHMP.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The sample sizes in the FAS (safety data set) as well as PPS (primary data set for efficacy analysis) seem 
to be overall balanced and sufficiently large. With regard to discontinuations per region, it is noted that 
more patients discontinued in the US region (14.4% and 15.3%) than in the EU region (7.0% and 9.1%) 
in TP1, for GP2017 and Humira, respectively. However, within regions no imbalances were seen between 
the treatment arms and the reasons for discontinuation were generally equally distributed. Therefore this 
was not further pursued by the CHMP. 
In the reference treatment arm, EU- and US-Humira were used for patients recruited in the EU or in the 
US, respectively.  
Following the results of the first PK equivalence study, the recruitment in Europe was to be capped at 90 
patients due to the shift of enrolment to the US. Consequently, treatment of patients with EU reference 
product was restricted to 44 patients, while US-Humira was used in 190 patients. This intervention was 
seen critically from a methodological perspective, as the shift of recruitment to the US and use of 
US-Humira in the majority of patients might influence the result of the phase 3 study. 
Efficacy results initially submitted by the Applicant strongly focussed on the treatment comparison 
GP2017 vs. Humira (i.e. data from patients treated with EU-Humira and data from patients treated with 
US-Humira were pooled into one Humira group), as well as on separate results for the US region. Overall 
pooled data analyses were planned to be the basis for the MAA in the EU.  
For the primary endpoint (PASI75 response rate at week 16), overall pooled data analysis showed a point 
estimate of the difference between treatments of 1.8, with 95% CI of [-7.46, 11.15] (PPS). 
Corresponding adjusted response rates were 66.8% for GP2017 and 65.0% for Humira. GP2017 is 
equivalent to Humira with regard to the primary efficacy endpoint. Analysis of the FAS data set support 
that result. 
During the assessment procedure, the Applicant was requested to present all relevant comparative 
efficacy data (primary, key secondary and secondary) by region. The provision of such data was 
considered important due to initial concerns related to signals for inconsistency of the treatment effect 
among regions and inferior efficacy of GP2017 compared to EU-Humira. These issues could be resolved 
during the assessment procedure. On a region level, the comparison between GP2017 (in patients 
recruited in the US) and US-Humira also met the criteria for equivalence. In contrast, the comparison in 
the EU region showed greater efficacy of the reference product compared to GP2017 at isolated visits 
including Week 16. It is however noted that the sample size in the EU was too small to draw any firm 
conclusions.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 81/128 
 
 
 
 
Mean %-change from baseline up to w16 (key secondary endpoint) was -60.7% for GP2017 and -61.5% 
for Humira (MMRM model, adjusted values). The point estimate was 0.8, with 95% CI of [-3.15; 4.84]. In 
order to complete the whole picture of equivalent efficacy, the Applicant was requested to provide 
additional analysis on the differences between treatments in absolute change from baseline in PASI score 
at week 16 (single time point), for the pooled and region-separated populations. The LS means were 
similar between GP2017 and Humira treatment groups for the overall study population as well as for both 
the EU and US regions. The differences between treatment arms were as follows: US region -0.11 
[-1.444, 1.220]; EU region 0.88 [-1.185, 2.938]. 
Other secondary endpoints, especially different PASI scores (50, 75, 90 and 100) mostly corroborate the 
findings and conclusion drawn from the primary and key secondary endpoints. The CHMP agreed that 
PASI75 response rates at time points other than week 16 as well as secondary endpoints generally 
demonstrate similar efficacy between biosimilar and reference product within the EU and US regions. 
Signals for inconsistencies in terms of a (not statistically significant) treatment*region interaction seen 
for the primary analysis seemed only to be exhibited at isolated visits and was found to be compatible with 
a chance-finding (mainly due to the small sample size).  
Efficacy results based on the US region only 
A concern with regard to patient homogeneity emerged. Information on baseline characteristics indicated 
that there were relevant differences between the EU and US region patient populations. At the time of 
study set-up, EU-Humira was approved as 2nd line treatment in contrast to US-Humira. Hence, a patient 
population with a longer duration of psoriasis, a slightly higher mean baseline PASI score, and a higher 
rate of prior systemic treatment could have been recruited in the EU compared to the US population. In 
response to the CHMP’s concern, the Applicant submitted a conclusive line of argument, a comprehensive 
overview of all available US results and a thorough discussion on the appropriateness of basing the 
decision of the EU marketing authorization on US data only. 
The majority of patients (n=378, 81%) in study GP17-301 were randomized in the US region and treated 
either with GP2017 (188 patients) or with US-Humira (190 patients). Patient disposition and 
discontinuation rates were similar in both treatment groups within the US: 14.4% vs. 15.3% 
discontinuations in treatment period 1 and 10.9% vs. 10% in treatment period 2, for the GP2017 and 
Humira groups, respectively. The reasons for discontinuations were also in general equally distributed 
between both arms. 
With regard to the US analysis sets, the full, safety and per-protocol analysis sets comprise highly similar 
numbers of patients in both treatment groups. It is agreed that similar proportions of patients were 
excluded from the PPS due to major protocol deviations in both treatment arms.  
The baseline characteristics are well balanced between both treatment groups in the US region. External 
validity (which however does not necessarily represent a prerequisite in a biosimilar exercise) is also 
given by similar characteristics of the US population studied in study GP17-301 as compared to the 
general psoriasis population and the patients studied in the clinical study of Humira. 
The analysis based on US data only concluded that the study population recruited in the US region was 
representative of the moderate to severe psoriasis population in the EU. Comparable efficacy of GP2017 
and US-Humira was consistently demonstrated based on the primary (PASI75 response rate at Week 16), 
key secondary (%change from baseline in PASI score up to Week 16) and other secondary endpoints. 
Equivalent efficacy was further supported by analyses of absolute change from baseline in PASI score and 
assessment of additional analyses of efficacy at an earlier time point (Week 13). In view of the totality of 
data provided in this application, the CHMP concluded that the US region results adequately support a 
marketing authorization in the EU.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 82/128 
 
 
 
 
Subgroup analyses evaluating the impact of ADA status on primary efficacy endpoint generally show 
similarity between treatments. While in ADA positive patients, criteria for equivalence were not met, 
interpretation should be done with caution due to the low number of patients included in the analyses. 
Adjusted PASI75 Response Rates were similar between treatments in ADA positive patients: 42.8% vs. 
39.2% for GP2017 and Humira, respectively. Further efficacy data separated by ADA status for the 
secondary endpoints were requested. The CHMP concluded that GP2017 and Humira exhibited similar and 
homogenous treatment effects within both the ADA-negative and ADA-positive subgroups. 
2.5.3  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The CHMP concluded that GP2017 and US-Humira show similar efficacy in the treatment of moderate to 
severe psoriasis, and in view of the totality of data provided in this application, the US region results 
adequately support a marketing authorization in the EU. 
2.6  Clinical safety 
As outlined in the EMA “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products containing 
biotechnology-derived proteins as active substance: non-clinical and clinical issues” 
(EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev. 1) and “Guideline on similar biological medicinal products 
containing monoclonal antibodies – non-clinical and clinical issues” (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), 
clinical evidence on comparability/similarity needs to be provided with respect to safety.  
The safety part of the clinical dossier for GP2017 includes data from 5 clinical studies, whereof 3 studies 
provide comparative information (GP2017 vs. Humira); studies GP17-104, GP17-101 (both PK) and study 
GP17-301 (efficacy and safety).  
For safety analyses, data from the healthy volunteer’s studies are presented as pooled data which is 
considered acceptable as study designs are sufficiently comparable. Separate analyses of safety aspects 
according to the respective reference product (EU- Humira or US- Humira) are available from studies 
GP17-104 and GP17-101 (the comparative PK studies) which enables more detailed assessment with this 
regard.  
The focus of the safety assessment, however, is on the pivotal, confirmative efficacy and safety trial in 
psoriasis patients (study GP17-301). For the reference product(s), the data of patients treated with either 
EU-Humira or US-Humira were pooled and analysed as a single Humira treatment group in this trial and 
this is acceptable in principle. However, safety data from the PK studies indicate differences in the safety 
profiles of US- and EU Humira. Therefore, separate analyses according to treatment group (EU-Humira or 
US-Humira) have been requested for study GP17-301 to gain further insight and exclude major 
divergences. 
Patient exposure 
In the studies included in this application, safety of GP2017 was investigated in 466 adult healthy subjects 
(single dose of 40 mg) and in 294 adult patients with chronic plaque-type psoriasis (multiple doses, initial 
dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week). 
Exposure in healthy subjects 
In the PK studies in healthy subjects, GP2017 was administered as a single s.c. dose of 40 mg/ 0.8 mL 
either by PFS (GP17-104, GP17-101, GP17-102, and GP17-103) or by AI (GP17-102). Apart from study 
GP17-103, where patients received GP2017  manufactured at Cook Pharmica, USA (referred to as 
GP2017-Cook) or at Sandoz GmbH, Austria (referred to as GP2017-Schaftenau), GP2017 drug product 
manufactured at Sandoz GmbH, Biopharmaceuticals Schaftenau, was used.

Table 28 - Exposure in healthy subjects 
Exposure in patients with psoriasis 
Patients received SC injections by PFS with a fixed dose of 40 mg (except for the initial loading dose, 
which was 80 mg) via a prefilled syringe. Trough serum levels were evaluated to provide supportive data 
on similarity with regard to systemic exposure. 
In the following sections, for study GP17-301 data are presented separately by treatment period and 
continued/switched groups. Please refer to the efficacy section for an overview on study design.  
Treatment Period 1 
During Treatment Period 1, there were no relevant differences in the exposure to study treatment 
between the two treatment groups. The mean (± SD) duration of exposure was 99.2 ± 21.19 days 
overall, and 390 patients (83.9%) received the maximum number of 10 doses (the loading dose of 80 mg 
was counted as 2 doses): 193 patients (83.5%) in the GP2017 treatment group and 197 patients (84.2%) 
in the Humira treatment group. 
Continued groups (Randomization to Week 51) 
During the entire study, there were no relevant differences in the exposure to study treatment between 
the two groups (table below). The mean (± SD) duration of exposure was 254.6 ± 120.92 days overall in 
the continued groups; 168 patients (49.6%) received the maximum number of 27 doses (the loading 
dose of 80 mg was counted as 2 doses): 81 patients (48.2%) in the continued GP2017 group and 87 
patients (50.9%) in the continued Humira group.

Table 29  - Summary of exposure to study treatment by continued group – randomisation to 
week 51 (SAF) 
Individual groups (Week 17 to Week 51) 
During Week 17 to Week 51, there were no relevant differences in the exposure to study treatment 
among the four individual groups (Humira to GP2017; continued Humira; GP2017 to Humira; and 
continued GP2017; Table below). The mean (± SD) duration of exposure was 198.1 ± 56.50 days overall 
in the individual groups; 252 patients (66.5%) received the maximum number of 17 doses: 37 patients 
(58.7%) in the Humira to GP2017 group, 89 patients (70.1%) in the continued Humira group, 42 patients 
(66.7%) in the GP2017 to Humira group, and 84 patients (66.7%) in the continued GP2017 group. Due 
to the 2:1 ratio at re-randomization patient exposure (in years) was about twice as high in the continued 
as in the switched groups. 
A sufficient number of patients were included in the “switched” groups to allow for reasonable comparison 
of safety profiles after switching of products.

Table 30 - Exposure across groups (week 17 to 51) 
Though the extent of exposure was comparable between the GP2017 and the pooled Humira groups 
throughout the whole study duration, there was a difference in exposure between the EU- and the US- 
reference product. When differences in PK-performances between EU- and US- Humira were discovered 
in study GP-17-101 during the recruitment stage of study GP17-301, recruitment in the EU-Humira arm 
was stopped As a result, the number of patients exposed to EU-Humira in this pivotal study is low (only 
44 patients were included in the EU-Humira arm at baseline).  
Hundred and four (104) patients from the continued Humira group and 100 patients from the continued 
GP2017 completed the phase III study. Eighty nine (89) patients in the continued GP2017 arm and 96 
patients in the continued Humira arm were exposed to study treatment for ≥ 49 weeks. While this is 
considered only borderline sufficient (100 patients exposed for a minimum of one-year are expected 
according to ICH E1), the numbers could be acceptable, considering the known safety profile of 
Adalimumab and the frequency of key AEs. Also, data from the switched groups are available and provide 
supportive evidence on long-term exposure. Fifty one (51) weeks is considered a sufficiently long 
duration of exposure to enable meaningful assessment of long-term safety and provide reasonable 
assurance for this known substance.  
Demographics and baseline characteristics and concomitant medication 
Inclusion and exclusion criteria did differ between the trials, in GP17-101 and GP17-301 male and female 
subjects were included while in all other (PK-) trials only male subjects were included. 
Due to the inclusion criteria, significantly more male than female subjects were exposed (especially in the 
PK studies at single dose) and there were also notable differences in distribution of subjects’ body weight 
across studies (body weight is assumed to be correlated to sex). No relationship of adalimumab safety 
and sex or body weight is presumed based on historical data (e.g. Menter A et al.; J Am Acad Dermatol. 
2010). The population is considered sensitive to detect differences between products on a safety level and 
therefore adequate for this biosimilarity exercise.  
There were no clinically relevant differences between the treatment groups in the use of concomitant 
medication in any study. The most frequently (>7% of patients in either group) used concomitant 
medications were ibuprofen, acetylsalicylic acid, paracetamol and lisinopril. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018

Adverse events 
In all studies, the occurrence of AEs was sought by non-directive questioning of the subject or patient at 
each visit during the study. AEs may also have been detected when they were reported by the subject 
during or between visits or identified through physical examination, laboratory test, or other 
assessments. 
In the following sections, only treatment-emergent AEs are presented. Treatment-emergent AEs were 
defined as AEs started on or after the administration of the IMP, or which were present prior to the 
administration of IMP but increased in severity, changed from being not suspected to being suspected of 
IMP relationship, or developed into SAEs after the IMP administration. All AEs including those reported 
before (first) administration of IMP were listed in the individual clinical study reports. Relationship of 
study treatment to AEs (suspected or not suspected) was assessed by the investigators. 
Healthy subjects 
In the pooled analysis of PK studies GP17-104, GP17-101, GP17-102 and GP17-103 in healthy subjects, 
the nature of AEs was similar between the GP2017 groups and the Humira groups. The most commonly 
affected primary system organ classes were infections and infestations, nervous system disorders, 
gastrointestinal disorders, musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and respiratory, thoracic and 
mediastinal disorders. 
Overall, GP2017 performed similarly or better (e.g. for Nasopharyngitis) in terms of AE frequencies when 
compared to the pooled Humira group (Table below). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 87/128 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Table 31  - Adverse events by preferred term (at least 2% of subjects in any group) in healthy 
subjects – pooled studies (safety set) 
When taking a closer look at AE frequencies according to the respective reference product (EU- or US), 
recognisable numerical differences in certain system organ classes become evident: infections and 
infestations were reported more frequently for subjects in the EU-Humira groups (45.3% and 42%) than 
for the subjects in the GP2017 (34.6% and 32%) and US-Humira groups (38.1% and 29%).  
The most commonly affected preferred terms were headache, nasopharyngitis, rhinitis, myalgia, nausea, 
abdominal pain, fatigue, and pharyngitis, all of which of mild or moderate severity. In study GP17-104, 
nasopharyngitis and rhinitis were driving the difference among groups observed in this system organ 
class as both AEs were reported more frequently in the EU-Humira group, and rhinitis also more 
frequently in the US-Humira group as compared to the GP2017 group. In study GP17-101, 
nasopharyngitis and pharyngitis were the most frequently affected preferred terms in this system organ 
class for subjects in the EU-Humira group, whereas rhinitis was most frequently affected preferred term 
for subjects in the GP2017 group. These findings are in line with that from other, recently published 
studies in healthy subjects using EU Humira and US-Humira as comparators, where differences between 
the proportions of EU-Humira or US-Humira treated subjects receiving reporting AEs, particularly 
nasopharyngitis, were described (Shin et al 2015, Hyland et al 2016, Wynne et al 2016, Kaur et al 2017). 
The Applicant argues that, as EU-Humira and US-Humira are analytically indistinguishable, there is no 
clear explanation for the imbalance in infections and infestations observed between the two groups. The 
Applicant further considers these differences clinically irrelevant as these only pertain to rather mild 
events of infections and infestations, which could in principle be agree upon. It is also noteworthy that 
GP2017 performed best when comparing frequencies of AEs to either reference group (EU- or US-Humira) 
and therefore these imbalances seem indeed of minor concern for the characterisation of GP2017. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 88/128 
 
 
 
 
 
However, these imbalances as regards safety performance are seen critically in light of the pooling of 
reference products. 
There were no clinically relevant differences pertaining to severity of events between the treatment 
groups in any of the studies. 
In trial GP17-102 (comparison AI vs. PFS), minor bleeding and injection fluid loss was seen at the 
injection site and was not considered to be clinically significant (e.g. bleeding was observed at a rate of 6 
and 7% in the PFS and AI arms and fluid loss was observed for 15% and 0% in the PFS and AI arms for 
this trial). The As explained by the Applicant bleeding or fluid loss at the injection site was only assessed 
in Trial GP17-102 comparing PK in healthy subjects receiving GP2017 via Autoinjector (AI) or Prefilled 
Syringe (PFS). There was no such specific focus on this type of hazard assessments in other PK studies, 
as this was a device related question. For all 8 cases where fluid loss from the injection site was reported 
in the PFS group, the hazard assessment was negative, implying that the amount of fluid lost was 
minimal, not impacting the total amount of medication received. For the autoinjector, one case of fluid 
loss potentially leading to less than the full dose being administered was noted.  No manufacturing or 
assembling defects were detected in the syringe and the sponsor considers the fluid loss was most likely 
attributable to the skinny physical built of the subject and lack of adequate adipose tissue to absorb the 
injected IMP. 
Patients with psoriasis 
Treatment Period 1 (Randomization to Week 17) 
There were no clinically relevant differences between the GP2017 and Humira groups with respect to the 
proportions of patients reporting AEs (overall and treatment related). The proportions of patients 
reporting SAEs (overall and related), severe AEs, AEs of special interest, AEs requiring study drug 
interruption, and discontinuations due to AEs were similar between the two treatment groups. Overall, 
239 patients (51.4%) reported a total of 541 AEs. The most commonly affected primary system organ 
class was infections and infestations (reported for 111 patients (23.9%) overall). The proportions of 
patients with AEs at system organ class and preferred term levels were similar between the treatment 
groups. The proportion of patients with gastrointestinal disorders (mainly diarrhoea) was higher in the 
Humira group than in the GP2017 group. Injection site reactions, including injection site erythema, were 
reported for a small number of patients.  In GP17-301 study a slightly higher number of events were 
reported in GP2017 as compared to Humira group however almost all ISR were mild or moderate in 
intensity. Only one patient (1.6%) in the GP2017 to Humira group experienced severe injection site pain. 
AEs suspected of being related to study drug were reported for 61 patients (13.1%) total during 
Treatment Period 1. The most commonly affected primary system organ class was general disorders and 
administration site conditions (reported for 26 patients (5.6%)), including the most commonly affected 
preferred term injection site erythema (reported for 12 patients (2.6%)). The proportions of patients with 
AEs suspected of being related to study drug were generally small on system organ class and preferred 
term levels and similar between treatment groups. 
Continued groups (Randomization to Week 51) 
There were no clinically relevant differences between the continued GP2017 and Humira groups with 
respect to the proportions of patients with AEs, treatment related AEs or SAEs, and AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study drug. The proportions of patients reporting severe AEs, SAEs (irrespective of 
relationship) or AEs of special interest were smaller, and the proportion of patients with AEs requiring 
study drug interruption was higher in the GP2017 group than in the continued Humira group (differences 
>5%).

Primary system organ classes and preferred terms reported by ≥3% of patients in any treatment group 
are presented in the table below. The proportions of patients with AEs at system organ class and preferred 
term levels were generally similar between the treatment groups except for gastrointestinal disorders, 
which were less frequently (with a difference of >10%) reported in the continued GP2017 group than in 
the continued Humira group. At the preferred term level, the gastrointestinal disorders that mainly 
contributed to this difference were diarrhoea (1.2% vs. 5.3%), dental caries (1.2% vs. 2.9%), abdominal 
pain (0.6% vs. 2.3%), constipation (0.6% vs. 2.3%), and gastrooesophageal reflux disease (0.0% vs. 
2.3%); other preferred terms in this system organ class were reported in similar proportions of patients 
or as single observations. Injection site erythema was reported for 7 patients (4.2%) in the continued 
GP2017 groups and for 5 patients (2.9%) in the continued Humira group. 
Most patients in either continued group reported AEs of mild or moderate severity during the entire study. 
Table 32 - Adverse events regardless of study treatment relationship by system organ class 
and preferred term (at least 3% of patients in any treatment group) by continued group – 
study GP17-301 – randomisation to week 51 (SAF) 
The proportions of patients in the continued groups who experienced AEs suspected of being related to 
study drug were <8% at system organ class level and <3% at preferred term level and similar between 
treatment groups during Randomization to Week 51.

Individual groups (Week 17 to Week 51) 
There were no clinically relevant differences across the four treatment groups (Humira to GP2017, 
continued Humira, GP2017 to Humira, and continued GP2017) with respect to the proportions of patients 
reporting AEs and SAEs during Week 17 to Week 51. 
The proportions of patients with AEs were similar for most system organ classes and preferred terms. At 
system organ class level, differences between groups were <10%. At preferred term level, except for 
nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, and headache, <5% of patients were reported per AE 
in any of the system organ classes. 
Most patients in any of the individual reported AEs of mild or moderate severity. 
The proportions of patients in the four individual groups (Humira to GP2017, continued Humira, GP2017 
to Humira, and continued GP2017) who experienced AEs suspected related to study drug during Week 17 
to Week 51 were <6.5% at system organ class level and <3.5% at preferred term level and similar among 
treatment groups. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
There were no deaths reported in the PK studies in healthy subjects. 
In the confirmatory efficacy and safety study GP17-301 in patients with psoriasis, 1 patient with a known 
history of depression in the continued GP2017 treatment group died on Day 178 (Treatment Period 2) as 
a result of completed suicide. The investigator did not consider the death to be related to study treatment 
and this can be endorsed. 
Other serious adverse events 
Healthy subjects 
No SAEs were reported in studies GP17-101 and GP17-103. 
In study GP17-104, 2 subjects (0.6%) experienced SAEs. One subject in the GP2017 group with a known 
history of pollinosis developed a moderate angioedema (known AE for Humira as per Humira SmPC and 
Humira US PI), which was reported 3 days after the single dose administration of 40 mg GP2017 and was 
suspected to be related to study treatment; the subject received treatment and the event was resolved 
after 13 days. Another subject, in the US-Humira group, experienced a severe femoral neck fracture after 
an accident, which occurred 4 weeks after single dose administration of US-Humira and was not 
suspected to be related to study treatment; the patient underwent surgical treatment and event resolved. 
Neither SAE led to discontinuation from the study.  
In study GP17-102, 1 subject in the GP2017-PFS group experienced mild appendicitis on Day 12, which 
was reported as an SAE and resulted in discontinuation of the subject from the study. The appendicitis 
was not considered to be related to study treatment; the patient underwent surgery and the event was 
resolved. 
Patients with psoriasis 
In the clinical study GP17-301 in patients with psoriasis, no safety signal or issues of concern have been 
identified. One patient (0.4%) in the Humira group experienced an SAE of toxic skin eruption during 
Treatment Period 1, which was reported as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction to the 
competent authorities and independent ethics committees/institutional review boards. The patient 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 91/128 
 
 
 
 
discontinued the study as a result of this SAE. One patient (0.6%) in the continued Humira group was 
reported to experience pulmonary tuberculosis during Treatment Period 2, which is listed as an adverse 
reaction in the Humira SmPC. The patient had been screened negative for tuberculosis prior to 
randomization. 
Overall, the proportions of patients reported with SAEs were low across all treatment groups and 
treatment periods. Throughout the study, 29 patients experienced 38 SAEs, one of which occurred 
pre-dose (preferred term: anal abscess). Of the remaining 37 SAEs, 11 were suspected to be related to 
study drug and 14 resulted in permanent discontinuation of study treatment. 
Treatment Period 1 (Randomization to Week 17) 
Overall, 13 patients (2.8%) reported SAEs during Treatment Period 1. Three patients (1.3%) in GP2017 
group and 10 patients (4.3%) in the Humira group experienced SAEs. On system organ class, ≤1.3% of 
patients reported SAEs in either treatment group. Except for basal cell carcinoma, which was reported for 
2 patients (0.9%) in each of the treatment groups, no more than 1 patient reported a specific SAE. 
Continued groups (Randomization to Week 51) 
Five patients (3.0%) in the continued GP2017 treatment group and 15 patients (8.8%) in the continued 
Humira group experienced SAEs. At the preferred term level, SAEs were all single observations except for 
abdominal pain, which was reported for 2 patients (1.2%) in the continued Humira group.    
Individual groups (Week 17 to Week 51) 
There were no clinically relevant differences across the four individual groups (Humira to GP2017, 
continued Humira, GP2017 to Humira, and continued GP2017) with respect to the proportions of patients 
reporting SAEs during Week 17 to Week 51. AEs were most frequently reported in the system organ class 
infections and infestations. At preferred term level, none of the SAEs were reported by more than 1 
patient in any treatment group. 
Adverse Events of special interest 
AEs of special interest were defined based on the Humira PI and included infections malignancies, allergic 
reactions, immune system disorders/autoimmune events, neurological events, hematological reactions, 
and congestive heart failure and are endorsed as such. The AE profile for adverse events of special 
interest revealed no obvious differences between the treatment groups. AEs of special interest were not 
defined in the healthy subject studies, which is acceptable. It is noted that two cases of hypersensitivity 
were reported in the GP2017 group and not in the Humira group. All cases suggesting allergic reaction to 
the treatment with GP2017 were thoroughly discussed and the ADA status for these patients was clarified. 
The reaction rates where very low, balanced across groups, mostly of moderate to mild intensity and 
seemed not related with immunogenicity findings. 
Treatment Period 1 (Randomization to Week 17) 
Overall, AEs of special interest were reported for 30 patients (6.5%) during Randomization to Week 17. 
The proportions of patients with AEs of special interest were similar between treatment groups (GP2017: 
13 patients (5.6%); Humira: 17 patients (7.3%)). The most commonly affected primary system organ 
class was infections and infestations (reported for 15 patients (3.2%)). At preferred term level, except for 
basal cell carcinoma (GP2017: 3 patients (1.3%); Humira: 2 patients (0.9%)), AEs of special interest 
were reported by 2 patients or less in any treatment group. One patient (0.4%) in the GP2017 group 
experienced a severe hypersensitivity, which was considered related to study treatment and led to 
permanent treatment discontinuation. No ADAs were identified in this patient.

Continued groups (Randomization to Week 51) 
The proportions of patients with AEs of special interest were similar between the continued groups, with 
13 patients (7.7%) in the continued GP2017 group and 22 patients (12.9%) in the continued Humira 
group. At preferred term level, AEs of special interest were reported for 3 patients (thrombocytopenia in 
the continued Humira group) or less in either treatment. 
Individual groups (Week 17 to Week 51) 
The proportions of patients with AEs of special interest were similar across the individual groups (Humira 
to GP2017: 3 patients (4.8%); continued Humira: 12 patients (9.4%); GP2017 to Humira: 6 patients 
(9.5%); and continued GP2017: 7 patients 5.6%)). At preferred term level, except for 2 patients (1.6%) 
each reporting herpes zoster or anaemia in the continued GP2017 group and thrombocytopenia in the 
GP2017 to Humira group, AEs of special interest were reported for not more than 1 patient per group. 
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions in healthy subjects 
Overall, the numbers and proportions of subjects with injection site reactions were similar among the 
GP2017, EU-Humira and US-Humira groups across all time points. Mainly mild injection site reactions 
were reported in any of the treatment groups (two moderate reactions were recorded, one in study 
GP17-101 in a subjects receiving EU-Humira and one in study GP17-102 in the GP2017-AI group). The 
majority of the subjects experienced no pain after administration. 
In study GP17-103, mild AEs of injection site pruritus were reported for 2 subjects in the 
GP2017-Schaftenau group. 
Concerning study GP17-102 5 subjects developed ISRs, one was moderate and the others mild.  
Injection site reactions in psoriasis patients (study GP17-301) 
In the confirmatory efficacy and safety study GP17-301, the investigator or designee assessed injection 
site reactions such as itching, redness, swelling, pain, or ulceration. Injection site reactions reported in 
the study included injection site erythema, pain, swelling, pruritus, bruising, haematoma, oedema, 
induration, urticaria, mass, and injection site reaction. 
The proportion of patients with injection site reactions was slightly higher in the GP2017 group (15 
patients (6.5%)) than in the Humira group (8 patients (3.4%)) during randomization to week 17. This 
difference disappears over time and no imbalance was recorded at later time points of safety assessment. 
There is no indication for an increased potential for injection site reactions from the preclinical studies. 
Though this finding is considered of minor clinical relevance, it is noted that injection site reactions could 
be an AE especially prone to be affected by defective blinding measures. 
Laboratory findings 
Healthy subjects 
In the PK studies in healthy subjects, no clinically meaningful differences were observed among the 
treatment groups in the four studies according to the Applicant. Abnormal laboratory findings were listed 
for several subjects, and according to the investigator’s medical judgement, all were considered as “not 
clinically significant (n)”. Events were overall too rare to enable meaningful comparison between groups.

Patients with psoriasis  
As for AE reporting, the main assessment of safety laboratory evaluations focuses on the phase III 
efficacy and safety trial GP17-301. Haematology, clinical chemistry and urine analysis data yielded similar 
results in the different treatment groups. No important treatment group differences were noted in the 
mean change from baseline for any parameter. There were no anomalies in the switched groups (Humira 
to Hymiroz or GP2017 to Humira). 
The following hematology parameters were analysed for all treatment groups: mean band neutrophils (% 
and absolute), basophils (% and absolute), eosinophils (% and absolute), lymphocytes (% and absolute), 
monocytes (% and absolute), mean neutrophils (% and absolute), hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelets, red 
blood cells, and white blood cells. The following clinical chemistry parameters were analyzed for all 
treatment groups: albumin, alkaline phosphatase, aspartate aminotransferase, alanine 
aminotransferase, bilirubin, blood urea nitrogen, calcium, creatinine, gamma glutamyltransferase, 
glucose, high sensitivity C-reactive protein, potassium, phosphate, sodium, total protein, and uric acid. 
The choice of parameters investigated is endorsed. 
Hematology 
No clinically relevant changes over time or differences between treatment groups were observed for 
hematology parameters (including erythrocytes, platelets, white blood cells and neutrophils). Across 
treatment periods, the proportions of patients with newly occurring clinically notable values of 
hematology parameters were low and there were no clinically relevant differences among groups.  
One patient in the Humira group experienced a severe neutropenia on Day 120 (Treatment Period 1), 
which was not considered related to study treatment and led to temporary interruption of study 
treatment.  
Shifts from baseline to low or high post-baseline values occurred similarly in all treatment groups and in 
a small number of patients across the treatment periods. 
Clinical chemistry 
No clinically relevant changes over time or differences between treatment groups were observed for 
clinical chemistry parameters (including liver function tests and creatinine). Across treatment periods, the 
proportions of patients with newly occurring clinically notable values of clinical chemistry parameters 
were low and there were no relevant differences among groups.  
Shifts from baseline to low or high post-baseline values occurred similarly in all treatment groups and in 
a small number of patients across the treatment periods. 
Urinalysis 
The following parameters were analyzed for all treatment groups: blood, glucose, ketones, protein, pH, 
specific gravity, urine pregnancy. No clinically relevant differences among groups were observed for 
urinalysis parameters among groups and across treatment periods. 
Safety in special populations 
The effect of intrinsic and extrinsic factors as well as the effect on fertility, pregnancy and lactation were 
not evaluated with GP2017 and will be extrapolated from the reference product EU-Humira, which is in 
accordance with regulatory guidance. GP2017 was developed as a biosimilar medicinal drug product; 
therefore respective information from the reference product EU-Humira also applies to GP2017. The 
respective PI wordings are in line with the originator PI and are adequate.

Immunological events 
Pooled PK studies in healthy subjects  
In healthy subjects, the samples for ADA measurement were collected pre-dose on Day 1, and on Days 
16, 30, 44, and 72. The time points and frequency of immunogenicity sampling appear adequate.   
Sixteen subjects (1.9%) had ADA positive results at pre-dose on Day 1. The ADA response was balanced 
between the pooled GP2017 and Humira groups, and the proportion of subjects with NAbs at the last 
positive ADA sample was similar in the two groups (see table below). 
Table 33  - Summary of immunogenicity results – pooled studies (safety analysis set) 
Study GP17-104 
Positive ADA results were seen from Day 16 until Day 72 with the highest incidence seen on Day 72. Nine 
subjects had ADA positive results at pre-dose on Day 1. The proportions of subjects with ADAs and NAbs 
were lower in the GP2017 group than in the EU-Humira and US-Humira groups. 
Study GP17-101 
Positive ADA results were seen from Day 16 until Day 72 with the highest incidence seen on Day 72 and 
were similar in the three groups. Three subjects had ADA positive results at predose on Day 1. The 
proportions of subjects with ADAs and NAbs were similar in the three groups. 
The incidences of anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies seem sufficiently comparable in 
healthy volunteers. GP2017 had lowest total ADA rates in both studies compared to the two reference 
groups (EU-Humira and US-Humira). 
Study GP17-102 
The ADA response was balanced between the GP2017-AI and GP2017-PFS groups, and the proportion of 
subjects with NAbs at the last positive ADA sample was similar in the two treatment groups. No subject 
had ADA positive results at pre-dose on Day 1. Positive ADAs were seen from Day 16 until Day 72 with the 
highest incidence seen on Day 72. 
ADA rates are considered comparable over time. Differences at some (earlier) time points are noted but 
are hard to interpret considering the small sample sizes of the groups.  
Study GP17-103 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 95/128 
 
 
 
 
 
Positive ADA results were seen from Day 16 until Day 72 with the highest incidence seen on Day 72. Four 
subjects had ADA-positive results at pre-dose on Day 1. The proportions of ADA-positive subjects were 
higher by 6.5-10.7% in the GP2017-Schaftenau group than in the GP2017-Cook group at each measured 
time point. The investigation of the difference in immunogenicity between GP2017-Cook and 
GP2017-Schaftenau groups did not reveal an underlying reason. There can be subject related risk factors, 
which were not investigated but might have played a role in the observed difference in immunogenicity 
between the two treatment groups. However, the overall proportions of subjects with ADA-positive 
results and with NAbs were similar in both groups. Higher proportions of ADA-positive subjects per each 
measured time point were observed in the GP2017-Schaftenau group in study GP17-103 as compared to 
the GP2017 group in study GP17-104. This is of note as one and the same GP2017 batch was used in 
studies GP17-103 and GP17-104. Both studies were carried out in a healthy subject population with 
similar inclusion and exclusion criteria, and the same analytical assay for detection of ADA was used. 
Though the same batch of IP was used in study GP17-103 in study GP17-104, higher proportions of 
ADA-positive subjects per each measured time point were observed in study GP17-103 for unknown 
reasons.  
Fewer patients with psoriasis developed the ADA response as compared to healthy volunteers. In the 
GP2017 treatment group overall 35.8% patients developed the ADA responses in comparison to 66.5% of 
healthy volunteers (pooled PK studies). Several factors such as chronic dosing, greater age and 
disease-related immunocompromised status may lead to a lower proportion of patients with psoriasis 
developing anti-drug antibodies as compared to healthy volunteers.  
Immunogenicity in patients with psoriasis (study GP17-301) 
The time points and frequency of immunogenicity sampling in the pivotal, comparative phase III trial 
appear adequate.   
While ADA data according to EU- and US Humira are displayed for the (pooled) PK studies, for study 
GP17-301 comparison to one pooled Humira reference group and by region is available. To exclude major 
differences between the products on an immunogenicity level and thus to recognize if comparison to a 
pooled reference group is reasonable and to enable assessment of a possible ‘region effect’, separate 
analyses of immunogenicity data according to the respective reference product (EU- or US- Humira) and 
GP2017 group (recruited in US or EU) were requested. ADA positive samples were further characterized 
in an ADA titer assay by the Applicant which is helpful to characterize the magnitude of the ADA response. 
The titer values are not continuous but semi-quantitative values for dilution steps (for example 1, 2, 6, 
10, 12 and so on without limit) and the Applicant argues that summary statistic calculated would not 
provide any clinically meaningful conclusion. In addition they say that the number of ADA titer values per 
visit and treatment group are too low (in particular for the EU region) to allow meaningful interpretation.

Table 34 - Summary of ADA and ADA titer levels during entire study by continued treatment 
groups and region (SAF) 
The provided table shows that there are rather large differences between the EU and the US region as 
regards ADA titers. The reasons for the drift of values between regions is not clear, might be a chance 
finding or caused by differences in baseline characteristics or correlated with earlier systemic therapy 
(higher rate of prior systemic therapy in the EU groups) The Applicant did not further elaborate on this 
difference. The US groups are larger and show considerably higher titers and might therefore be the more 
suitable groups for comparison (detecting a difference), however, within each regions (EU or US) the titer 
Assessment report

values are quite consistent. ADA (or nAB) titers seem not to have influenced AEs considerably; however, 
for an approval in Europe it is reassuring that in the EU both products have produced lower ADA titers. All 
patients with high ADA titer values ≥1800 were from the US region (7 GP2017 and 4 Humira patients). 
While a region effect on titer values could be observed, this seems of no relevance for the comparability 
exercise. There is no difference in the AE profile reported between ADA positive and negative patient 
subgroups. There was no signal that higher ADA titer values had a greater impact on safety or efficacy. 
Treatment Period 1 (Randomization to Week 17)  
During Randomization to Week 17, the numbers and proportions of patients with positive ADA responses 
were similar between the GP2017 and Humira groups at the individual visits, and the numbers and 
proportions of patients with at least one positive ADA response from Week 1 and up to Week 17 were also 
similar between treatment groups; NAbs were detected in similar proportions between groups (see table 
below).

had at least one ADA-positive result. There were no clinically meaningful differences in the proportions of

patients reporting AEs (overall and treatment related), SAEs (overall and related), severe AEs, AEs of 
special interest, AEs requiring study drug interruption, and discontinuations due to AEs between 
ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients and between the GP2017 and Humira groups within each 
subgroup. The nature of AEs reported for ADA-positive patients was similar to that reported for 
ADA-negative patients, therefore ADA development is not considered to have an impact on patients’ 
safety in this study. 
The relationship between ADA status (positive or negative) and adverse events was assessed over the 
whole study duration for all 4 groups (EU GP2017, EU Humira, US GP2017, US Humira). In the ADA 
negative subgroups, the overall incidence of TEAEs was higher than in ADA positive subgroups 
(continuous dataset). The Applicant argues that this difference was caused by seasonal viral exposure 
(driven by system organ class “Infections and infestations” and by preferred terms “nasopharyngitis, 
upper respiratory tract infection and sinusitis”). From AE data per region we know that the US groups had 
higher “Infections and infestations” rates than the EU groups. This could make sense as patients with high 
ADA rates (the majority of ADAs were of neutralizing nature) could have an impaired efficacy (less 
tnf-alpha inhibition) and thus a better immune response than patients with no ADAs (or nABs). However, 
these are theoretical assumptions which are not supported by efficacy data.  
Interestingly, the rate of “Injury, poisoning and procedural complications” in the ADA-negative groups 
was higher than in the ADA positive groups (continuous dataset). The reason or impact of this finding is 
unknown. 
Overall some differences between groups were found but no clear pattern that would be considered 
clinically meaningful was noted. 
Continued groups (Randomization to Week 51) 
The numbers and proportions of patients with positive ADA responses were similar between the continued 
groups at post-baseline time points up to Week 17 and lower in the continued GP2017 group compared to 
the continued Humira group at later time points visits. The numbers and proportions of patients with at 
least one positive ADA response from Week 1 and up to Week 51 were lower in the continued GP2017 
than in the continued Humira group at each time point, and NAbs were detected in similar high, 
proportions (see table below). 
Individual groups (Week 17 to Week 51)  
Differences in relation to the ADA response were observed between treatment groups.  At week 51 
(overall from week 1) in the continued GP2017 groups ADA response was reported in 35.8 % of patients 
whereas in the continued Humira group ADAs were found in 45.1 % of patients (see table below). The 
proportions of patients with positive ADA responses were higher in the switched groups compared with 
the continued groups at individual time points during Week 17 to Week 51 (see table below). In the 
GP2017 to Humira group this could be due to a higher rate of ADA positive patients being re-randomized 
to this group at week 17, however, this does not explain similar observation in the Humira to GP2017 
group. Overall, the differences were small and likely not of clinical significance. The differences are 
believed to be a chance finding. 
There is no clear indication for an increase in immunogenicity after transition from Humira to GP2017 or 
vice versa. The majority of ADAs was, again, neutralizing. The proportion of patients with at least one 
sample that was positive for NAbs from Week 1 was slightly higher in the Humira to GP2017 group than 
in the other three groups.

Table 36 - Summary of patients with confirmed positive anti-drug antibody response by 
individual group – study GP17-301 – randominsation to week 51 (TP2+EP SAF) 
The incidences of anti-drug antibodies and neutralising antibodies in psoriasis patients are mostly 
comparable across the groups. It is noteworthy, however, that in the continued GP2017 group the lowest 
ADA incidence of all 4 groups was measured at each time point.  
In the phase III trial, ADA incidences are significantly higher than those reported in the Psoriasis studies 
for the initial MAA of Humira (SmPC Humira). This is to be expected as more sensitive assays for the 
detection of anti-adalimumab antibodies were developed in the meantime. In addition, the incidence of 
ADAs is high but comparable in the GP2017 and Humira treatment groups.  
At the end of study GP17-301 at week 51, close to 100% of all ADA positive subjects had neutralising 
antibodies (across all treatment groups). It is noted that the assessment of ADA/nAB positivity on a 
qualitative level leads to limitations because it does not allow for stratification of ADA/nAB levels. Positive 
antibody and nAB responses should therefore generally also be reported as a titer to allow elucidation of 
the relationships between ADA/nAB levels and their impact on safety (and efficacy) for all three products 
used in this study. The assay used to evaluate neutralizing quality was a qualitative assay only, but highly 
sensitive and the result is the high rate of nABs. The assay is considered state of the art and deemed 
acceptable.  
According to the Applicant, the determined rate of neutralizing antibodies was expected. Comparable 
incidence rates are reported in the literature, the majority of binding anti-adalimumab antibodies (ADAs) 
are capable of neutralizing adalimumab (van Schouwenburg et al 2013). It is further described that ADAs 
against adalimumab are usually anti-idiotype antibodies that target the drug binding site, as this does not 
belong to the immunoglobuline repertoire of the host. The humoral response to adalimumab, for e.g. in 
RA patients was found to be highly restricted and limited to epitopes located in the TNF-binding region. As 
a result, anti-adalimumab antibodies are mostly neutralizing (i.e. they block the binding of the 
therapeutic agent to its target, TNF-α). In addition it was shown that more than 94% of the binding of 
anti-adalimumab antibodies could be blocked by the Fab fragment of a single monoclonal

anti-adalimumab antibody (van Schouwenburg et al 2013). Furthermore, according to the available 
literature, more than 97% of the anti-idiotype antibody response to adalimumab, could be inhibited by 
TNF (van Schie et al 2015), additionally supporting their neutralizing character. In the single dose study 
in healthy volunteers, almost all subjects were ADA-positive. The incidence of subjects with post-dose 
ADA to adalimumab was observed in 98.4% of subjects in the SB5 treatment group, 95.2% of subjects in 
the EU-ADL treatment group and all subjects in the US-ADL treatment group. Most ADA-positive subjects 
had NAbs, approximately 80% in each treatment group (Shin et al 2017). 
As the rate of nAB was close to 100%, the assessment and distribution of ADA titers per visit was 
considered as a surrogate for titers of Nabs, and this seems an acceptable approach. No impact of nABs 
on safety profile of the products was observed. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
Interactions with other medicinal products were not evaluated with GP2017 and this information will be 
extrapolated from the reference product EU-Humira, which is in line with regulatory guidance. GP2017 
was developed as a biosimilar medicinal drug product; therefore respective information from the 
reference product EU-Humira also applies to GP2017. The respective PI wordings are in line with the 
originator PI and are adequate. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There is no significant dysbalance for subjects terminating their study participation due to adverse 
events. 
Adverse events leading to discontinuation in healthy subjects 
There were no AEs leading to discontinuation reported in studies GP17-101, GP17-103, and GP17-104. In 
study GP17-102, 1 SAE (appendicitis) not related to study treatment led to study discontinuation. 
Adverse events leading to study drug discontinuation in patients with psoriasis (study GP17-301) 
Overall, the proportions of patients reported with AEs leading to discontinuation were low across 
treatment groups and across treatment periods.  
During Treatment Period 1 (Randomization to Week 17), 11 patients (2.4%) overall experienced AEs that 
led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment. Proportions of patients experiencing AEs leading to 
discontinuation of study treatment were similar between the treatment groups. 
At preferred term level, none of the AEs leading to discontinuation were reported by more than 1 patient 
in any treatment group, except for psoriasis (verbatim: worsening of psoriasis), which was reported by 2 
patients (0.9%) in the Humira treatment group. Five of the 11 patients experienced SAEs that led to 
permanent discontinuation of study treatment. In the GP2017 group, 1 patient experienced severe 
staphylococcal infection and hypersensitivity. Both events were considered related to study treatment. In 
the Humira group, 4 patients experienced SAEs that led to discontinuation of study treatment. These were 
SAEs of severe cellulitis and severe toxic skin eruption, which were both considered to be related to study 
treatment, and severe, unrelated SAEs of ectopic pregnancy and prostate cancer. The toxic skin eruption 
was reported as a suspected unexpected serious adverse reaction to the competent authorities and 
independent ethics committees/institutional review boards as required. In the GP2017 and Humira 
groups, 1 patient each experienced a non-serious AE, which was considered to be treatment related and 
led to permanent discontinuation of study treatment during Treatment Period 1. These were a moderate 
AE of increased body temperature in the GP2017 group and a moderate AE of hypoaesthesia in the 
Humira group. One patient (0.4%) in the GP2017 group and 2 patients (0.9%) reported unrelated, mild

or moderate AEs of psoriasis (verbatim: worsening of psoriasis), which were considered to be unrelated 
to study treatment and led to treatment discontinuation. Another patient in the GP2017 group 
permanently discontinued treatment due to a moderate skin infection, which was considered to be 
unrelated tostudy treatment. 
During Week 17 to Week 51, 12 patients (3.2%) overall experienced AEs that led to permanent 
discontinuation of study treatment, and 7 of these 12 patients (5 in the continued and 2 in the switched 
groups) experienced SAEs that led to treatment discontinuation. The proportion of patients reporting AEs 
leading to discontinuations was similar across the four individual groups (Humira to GP2017, continued 
Humira, GP2017 to Humira, and continued GP2017). At preferred term level, none of the AEs leading to 
discontinuation were reported by more than 1 patient in any group.  
During Week 17 to Week 35 (Treatment Period 2), in the continued GP2017 group, 1 patient committed 
suicide on Day 178. The death was not considered to be related to study treatment. 
2.6.1  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of GP2017 was explored in five clinical studies. In the four PK studies 466 adult healthy 
subjects provided data on single dose (40 mg) exposure in healthy volunteers, who were followed for 72 
days. The phase III study in 294 subjects (126 on continued GP2017, 127 on continued Humira, 63 on 
Humira and switching to GP2017 (week 17) and 63 on GP2017 switching to Humira (week 17)) provided 
comparative data on multiple dose treatment (initial dose of 80 mg followed by 40 mg every other week) 
with adalimumab for up to 51 weeks in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis. 
Data from this study thus provides safety data on transitioning from Humira to the biosimilar and vice 
versa. The phase III study GP17-301 is pivotal for the safety assessment of this application.  
Hundred and four (104) patients from the continued Humira group and 100 patients from the continued 
GP2017 completed the phase III study. Eighty nine (89) patients in the continued GP2017 arm and 96 
patients in the continued Humira arm were exposed to study treatment for ≥ 49 weeks. While this is 
considered only borderline sufficient (100 patients exposed for a minimum of one-year are expected 
according to ICH E1), the numbers could be acceptable, considering the known safety profile of 
Adalimumab and the frequency of key AEs. Also, data from the switched groups are available and provide 
supportive evidence on long-term exposure.  
Data on adverse events, serious adverse events and adverse events of special interest were provided in 
a descriptive manner. The characteristics of adverse events were overlapping in all arms and mirror the 
safety profile as described in the SmPC of Humira.  
From the comparative PK trials, separate analyses according to the reference product used (EU- or US 
Humira) are available. Recognisable numerical differences in the frequency of certain AEs were detected 
between treatment groups: infections and infestations were reported more frequently for subjects in the 
EU-Humira groups (45.3% and 42%) than for the subjects in the GP2017 (34.6% and 32%) and 
US-Humira groups (38.1% and 29%). These differences pertained only to mild events and GP2017 
performed best when comparing frequencies of these AEs to either reference group.  
Due to the low number of recruited EU-patients in the reference group there is also a shift towards the US 
population in study GP17-301. The factor ‘region’ could theoretically have an influence on certain safety 
aspects such as e.g. infection rates (which could differ at baseline pertaining to geographic area). 
Actually, a higher proportion of patients experienced AEs in the US region, largely driven by infections 
(rhinitis, nasopharygitis, sinusitis), which might have been a reflection of seasonal viral exposure.  
Within each region (EU or US), baseline data as well as safety results (apart from the infections and 
infestations system organ class) are quite comparable and seem each sufficiently similar to support 
assumption of similarity from a safety perspective. It remains unknown if one population (US or EU) is 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 102/128 
 
 
 
 
more “sensitive” in detecting differences in safety between the two products than the other, but both 
populations seem each equally appropriate for the comparison. However, it has to be considered that the 
overall incidence of events is low and also that the number of patients exposed to EU-Humira is rather 
low, possibly compromising the meaningfulness of results. Therefore the US comparison was finally 
considered more suitable to detect differences. For an approval in the EU however, it is important that the 
safety profile of the biosimilar is comparable or better than the safety profile of the originator in the EU 
population and this was supported by the AE data from the EU population. 
When considering EU- and US Humira as a single reference group, numbers of adverse events in the 
phase III study are not only comparable between the GP2017 and Humira treatment group but also 
overall comparable with PI information. The AE profiles remain overall similar for the continued groups 
and the groups who transitioned from Humira to GP2017 and vice versa.  
The proportion of patients with injection site reactions was slightly higher in the GP2017 group (15 
patients (6.5%)) than in the Humira group (8 patients (3.4%)) during randomization to week 17 in study 
GP17-301. This difference disappears over time and no imbalance was recorded at later time points of 
safety assessment. Also, there is no indication for an increased potential for injection site reactions from 
the preclinical studies. Though this finding is considered of minor clinical relevance, it is noted that 
injection site reactions could be an AE especially prone to be affected by defective blinding measures.  
Blinding was an issue in some of the studies included in this application and also in GP17-301. Although 
the Applicant argues that blinding was done in the best possible way, it is still considered suboptimal and 
maintain of the blind couldn’t be ensured. Serum drug concentrations are the key PK parameter of the 
biosimilar exercise and these measurements are considered robust against this kind of bias. However, 
biased assessment of subjective endpoints (e.g. safety endpoints) couldn’t be excluded. 
Small differences in relation to the ADA response were observed between treatment groups in study 
GP17-301. At week 51 (overall from week 1) in the continued GP2017 groups ADA response was reported 
in 35.8 % of patients whereas in the continued Humira group ADAs were found in 45.1 % of patients. The 
proportions of patients with positive ADA responses were slightly higher also in the switched groups 
compared with the continued groups at individual time points during Week 17 to Week 51. In the GP2017 
to Humira group this could be due to a higher rate of ADA positive patients being re-randomized to this 
groups at week 17; nonetheless, this does not explain similar observation in the Humira to GP2017 group. 
However, overall the differences, probably chance findings, were small, disappeared over time and were 
likely not of clinical significance. Currently there is no clear indication for an increase in immunogenicity 
after transition from Humira to GP2017 or vice versa. 
Fewer patients with psoriasis developed ADA response as compared to healthy volunteers. In the GP2017 
treatment group overall 35.8% patients developed the ADA responses in comparison to 66.5% of healthy 
volunteers (pooled PK studies). Several factors such as chronic dosing, greater age and disease-related 
immunocompromised status may lead to a lower proportion of patients with psoriasis developing 
anti-drug antibodies as compared to healthy volunteers. 
At the end of study GP17-301 at week 51, close to 100% of all ADA positive subjects had neutralising 
antibodies. This was observed across all treatment groups. ADA positive samples were further 
characterized in an ADA titer assay by the Applicant which is helpful to characterize the magnitude of the 
ADA response. While a region effect on titer values could be observed, this seems of no relevance for the 
comparability exercise, titers were comparable within each region (EU and US). There is no difference in 
the AE profile reported between ADA positive and negative patient subgroups. There was no signal that 
higher ADA titer values had a greater impact on safety or efficacy.

2.6.2  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety and immunogenicity profiles for GP2017 and Humira are mostly comparable, supporting the 
notion of biosimilarity for the two products in principle. The trials revealed the well-known adalimumab 
safety profile/AEs in comparable proportions across treatment groups. GP2017 was well tolerated and AE 
rates were low. 
A possible impact of regional differences on safety outcomes could be examined based on separate 
analyses for EU- and US Humira. Though a certain region effect could be observed, the US population, 
which is the major share of patients in study GP17-301, could be sufficiently representative also for the 
EU population. Major differences in frequencies of AEs and thus, safety performance between (i) regions 
or (ii) products can be excluded. Looking at Europe region data alone, EU-GP2017 was well tolerated and 
showed a comparable safety profile to EU-Humira. While some minor uncertainties (e.g. suboptimal 
blinding measures, impact of region effect) have to be considered in the benefit/risk balance of the 
product, the amount and quality of safety data is considered satisfactory.

3  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
The proposed biosimilar GP2017 is intended for some of the therapeutic indications approved for Humira 
in the EU: juvenile idiopathic arthritis (polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis and enthesitis-related 
arthritis), axial spondyloarthritis (ankylosing spondylitis and axial spondyloarthritis without radiographic 
evidence of AS), psoriatic arthritis, psoriasis, paediatric plaque psoriasis, hidradenitis suppurativa (HS), 
uveitis and paediatric uveitis. 
Hefiya is currently only available as a 40 mg prefilled syringe (PFS) or AI, and the Applicant intends to 
claim the paediatric indications only for patients, for whom the full 40 mg dose is suitable, depending on 
age, weight or body surface area. 
To support the biosimilarity claim the Applicant performed a comprehensive biosimilarity exercise at the 
quality level. An extensive panel of standard and state-of-the art techniques has been used for 
characterisation and comparison of relevant quality attributes of the adalimumab molecule. The panel 
includes analytical tests for physicochemical features as well as biological characteristics including binding 
to membrane-bound TNF-α and ADCC activity, and is considered appropriate for a robust comparison of 
the quality profiles of GP2017 with its reference medicinal product. 
In addition to the in vitro comparability exercise two comparative in vivo PD studies have been performed 
in two different mouse models, overexpressing soluble TNFα (Tg197 mice) and membrane-bound TNFα 
(Tg5453 mice), respectively.

Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 120/128 
 
 
 
 
 
Clinical studies to demonstrate similarity of GP2017 to (EU-sourced) Humira were conducted in healthy 
volunteers (PK, safety and tolerability), as well as in patients with psoriasis (efficacy, safety, tolerability, 
PK).  
The applicant performed two 3-arm, comparative PK studies in healthy volunteers (study GP17-101 and 
GP17-104). In both studies, similarity in PK, safety and immunogenicity between GP2017 and 
EU-Humira, between GP2017 and US-Humira, as well as between US and EU originator was studied. The 
Applicant also submitted an analysis pooling results from both PK studies GP17-101 and GP17-104. 
The confirmatory efficacy and safety trial GP17-301 was a randomised, double blind study in patients with 
moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis (n=465) over 51-weeks of treatment.  The primary 
objective was to evaluate similarity in efficacy between GP2017 and Humira based on a statistical 
comparison of the proportion of patients meeting the PASI75 response criteria at Week 16 (primary 
endpoint).  
Apart from the main clinical trials investigating biosimilarity between Humira and GP2017, two supportive 
trials were performed, aiming to describe the PK of GP2017 administered by an AI or a PFS in healthy 
volunteers and to compare GP2017 drug substances manufactured by two different manufacturing sites, 
respectively.  
In addition the applicant presented a discussion on the extrapolation to the indications of Humira, for 
which no comparative clinical data are available. The scientific justification for extrapolation includes 
structural, physico-chemical and functional analyses as well as nonclinical data, complemented with 
clinical data in psoriasis patients and a literature review of the mechanism of action of adalimumab. 
3.2  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality 
A similar quality profile between US and EU Humira could be demonstrated. Observed differences in 
critical quality attributes between GP2017 and the reference product (which have been raised as part of 
a multidisciplinary Major Objection at day 120) have been appropriately addressed by providing 
additional data sets as well as reasonable justifications: 
Of particular concern were differences in glycosylation variants, which are reported to impact Fc-related 
biological activities, as well as biological assays relevant for the mode-of-action, including binding to 
membrane-bound TNF-α and ADCC activity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 121/128 
 
 
 
 
 
These bioassays are important for claiming extrapolation to indications, for which no comparative clinical 
data are available. In addition, no further in vitro data were available in support of the extrapolation to 
indications where mTNFα-mediated mechanisms may play a more prominent role. Additional evidence 
and convincing justification was needed to rule out the possibility that these differences might alter the 
clinical performance of the biosimilar candidate (quality aspect of the multidisciplinary MO at day 120). 
With the responses, a well-structured and comprehensive response document has been provided. The 
additional data sets provided as well as the provided justifications are reasonable and appropriately 
address the previous concerns.  
In summary all concerns have been resolved and biosimilarity on the quality level has been 
demonstrated. 
Non-clinical 
Similar efficacy of GP2017 and Humira was shown in a murine in vivo model for RA overexpressing soluble 
TNFα. In vivo TK and toxicology studies showed comparable results for both, GP2017 and Humira. 
Pharmacokinetics 
Results from study GP17-104 support biosimilarity in terms of pharmacokinetics: For the comparison 
GP2017/EU-Humira, the point estimates of the ratios of the geometric LS means for Cmax and AUC0-inf 
were around 1 and the corresponding 90% CIs entirely contained within the equivalence margin of 0.8 – 
1.25 [AUCinf: 1.04 (90% CI: 0.96 – 1.13), Cmax: 1.05 (90% CI: 0.99 – 1.11)]. Comparability was also 
shown for EU vs. US-sourced Humira in study GP17-104. These results were confirmed by all requested 
supportive analyses including the one which included all AUC0-inf values. The secondary endpoints 
AUC0-360h, t1/2, tmax, %AUCextra, tmax, CL0-last and Kel were also roughly comparable across 
treatment arms.  
Similarity of GP2017 and Humira is furthermore supported by the PK data in the target population from 
the efficacy and safety trial GP17-301 (adalimumab Ctrough levels), which seem overall comparable for 
Humira and GP2017.  
Efficacy 
The confirmatory efficacy study GP17-301 was adequately designed for a biosimilar exercise.  
In the primary analysis pooling results from patients recruited in the EU and in the US (i.e. pooling 
GP2017 administered to patients in EU and US as well as pooling EU- and US-Humira), biosimilarity 
between GP2017 and Humira was shown for the primary efficacy endpoint (PASI75 response rate at week 
16) (in the PPS as well as for the FAS data set). The point estimate of the difference between treatments 
was 1.8, with 95% CI [-7.5; 11.15]. 
Equivalence between both treatment arms with regard to the primary efficacy endpoint was also shown in 
the population subset only recruited in the US.  
Biosimilarity was also shown in the key secondary endpoint “mean %-change from baseline up to week 
16”, for the pooled analysis as well as for the region-specific subgroup analyses (including the comparison 
GP2017 vs. EU-Humira for patients only recruited in the EU). The point estimate of the difference between 
treatments for the pooled analysis was 0.8, with a 95% CI [-3.15; 4.84].  
Evaluation of secondary endpoints over the whole treatment period shows that GP2017 and US-Humira, 
as well as GP2017 and EU-Humira, are (descriptively) similar.

Safety 
The comparative safety results of the studies in healthy volunteers as well as in psoriasis patients largely 
support the biosimilarity of GP2017 to Humira; no major difference in the occurrence of unfavourable 
effects was identified in the programme. GP2017 performed comparably or better compared with the 
pooled reference Humira group in the pivotal efficacy and safety trial GP17-301. Incidence of ADAs was 
mostly comparable for GP2017 and Humira. The incidence of neutralising antibodies (59% for GP2017 vs 
60.8% for Humira, pooled studies, safety analysis set - Table 36) was rather high but balanced over the 
treatment groups.   
The adverse events captured in comparative clinical studies mirror those described in the SmPC for 
Humira. 
3.3  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
Quality 
For some of the quality attributes the comparative tests were initially conducted with a limited number of 
batches using wide comparability ranges. These data were supplemented with additional datasets and 
overall, no concerns on biosimilarity remain.  
Non-clinical 
In transgenic mice overexpressing membrane-bound TNF-α, the PD effects of GP2017 were significantly 
lower than those of Humira. However, the contribution of the mTNF-α RA model to the overall assessment 
of biosimilarity is considered to be of limited value.  
Pharmacokinetics 
In study GP17-101, PK biosimilarity between GP2017 and EU-authorized Humira as well as between EU- 
and US-licensed Humira could not be demonstrated, as the upper limits of the 90% CIs of the ratios of 
GMs for the primary PK endpoints AUC0-last and AUC0-inf were above 1.25. An extensive root cause 
investigation was conducted, but was not able to explain the outcome of GP17-101. The applicant also 
examined the clinical trial batches with regard to quality attributes which could potentially impact the PK 
(such as dose strength, Man5, Met256 oxidation and the glycovariants bGo, bG1 and gG2), and 
satisfactorily discussed observed quality differences potentially influencing PK. None of them appears to 
be responsible for the differences in PK between GP2017 and EU-Humira in study GP17-101.  
Although GP17-101 failed to demonstrate PK equivalence, the CHMP concluded that non-rejection of the 
null-hypothesis in this case does not necessarily imply the existence of a relevant PK difference. Indeed, 
when concluding on PK similarity, results of the PK investigations should always be interpreted and 
weighed in the context of all other data. It is therefore important to consider also the quality 
characteristics and data on binding properties when judging the likelihood of potential pharmacokinetic 
differences.  
Study GP17-103 failed to demonstrate bioequivalence in PK between GP2017-Schaftenau and 
GP2017-Cook. The primary end-points for AUC0-inf and AUC0-last were not met most likely due to 
differences in the rate of ADA development; this assumption is supported by the fact that the primary 
end-points for Cmax and AUC0-360, which are not influenced by late ADA formation, have been met.

Efficacy 
The recruitment of the confirmatory efficacy and safety trial GP17-301 in Europe was to be capped at 90 
patients due to the shift of enrolment to the US. This intervention is seen critically from a methodological 
perspective by the CHMP, as shift of recruitment to the US and use of US-Humira in the majority of 
patients might influence the result of the phase 3 study. 
During the assessment procedure, the CHMP raised a concern regarding the signal for inconsistency of the 
treatment effect among the US and EU regions, in terms of a (not statistically significant) 
treatment*region interaction and inferior efficacy of GP2017 vs. EU-Humira at isolated visits including 
Week 16. However, it was concluded that this ‘interaction’ was only exhibited at isolated visits and that 
due to the small sample size in the EU subgroup, small differences in the number of patients achieving 
PASI75 response resulted in large differences in response rates (a difference of 4 patients resulted in a 
15% difference in response rates). The isolated results were considered to be compatible with a 
chance-finding. 
Concern emerged that populations included in study GP17-301 the EU and in the US differ in certain 
baseline characteristics, e.g. hand and feet involvement at baseline (4% vs. 45%), body weight (85 kg vs. 
95 kg), duration of psoriasis (18 y vs. 15–16 y), mean baseline PASI score (22 vs. 20) and rate of prior 
systemic treatment (55% vs 42%). This might be partly a consequence of a difference in the Humira 
labels at the time of study set-up in 2013 (approved then as 2nd line treatment in the EU, in contrast to 
US). A somewhat different patient population might have been recruited in the EU. 
Safety 
Some regional differences between the EU and the US population could be observed at baseline (e.g. 
differences in body weight, baseline PASI -both accounted for by stratification- but also others), which is 
not considered ideal for comparability exercise. Also, some regional differences occurred in safety events 
(e.g. a higher rate of infections in the US areas, differences in ADA titres). 
Blinding measures were not ideal in studies GP17-104 and GP17-301. Biased assessment of subjective 
endpoints (e.g. local tolerance, other potentially treatment-related AEs) cannot be entirely excluded; the 
impact of this is however considered to be minor. 
3.4    Discussion on biosimilarity 
Similarity was shown for the investigated quality attributes; small differences which have been observed 
for critical glycan variants as well as for certain mode-of-action relevant biological assays, including 
binding to membrane-bound TNF-α and ADCC activity, have been appropriately justified. Taking the 
additional data sets including additional data on ADCC activity as well as the provided justifications into 
account, the initial concerns have been adequately resolved.  
The Applicant intends to manufacture the drug substance at two different sites: Biopharmaceuticals 
Schaftenau (BPS), Austria; and Cook Pharmica, USA. In all clinical studies (except study GP17-103) 
GP2017 manufactured from drug substance produced at Schaftenau was used. In a comprehensive 
comparability exercise the applicant has provided evidence of an adequate bridge between both 
manufacturing sites. On a quality level, comparability of biosimilar drug substance produced at the 
different lines and sites was shown. Comparable efficacy of Humira and GP2017 was demonstrated in a 
murine model for RA based on the overexpression of soluble TNFα. However, in mice overexpressing 
membrane-bound TNF-α, PD effects of GP2017 were significantly lower than those of Humira. However, 
the murine mTNF-α model  is of limited value for the overall assessment of biosimilarity.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/520007/2018  
Page 124/128 
 
 
 
 
Neither for the comparison GP2017/EU-Humira nor for the comparison EU-/US-Humira any clear 
reason/driving source for the observed differences in PK parameters in study GP17-101 was identified. 
The applicant also examined the clinical trial batches with regard to quality attributes which could 
potentially impact the PK and discussed observed quality differences potentially influencing PK. A larger 
study (GP17-104) was conducted, and the variability was reduced and biosimilarity was shown in the 
second PK study.  
When concluding on PK similarity, results of the PK investigations should always be interpreted and 
weighed in the context of all other data. It is important to consider also the quality characteristics and 
data on binding properties when judging the likelihood of potential pharmacokinetic differences. 
EU- and US-Humira have been shown to be highly similar at the quality level and considering results from 
the successful study GP17-104, showing PK comparability between EU- and US-Humira, the scientific 
bridge between EU- and US-sourced Humira has been established.   
For study GP17-301, the pooled efficacy data show comparability with regard to the primary and key 
secondary endpoints; the point estimates as well as CI are contained within the predefined equivalence 
margins. However, results at the region level were found to be indicative of inconsistencies of the 
treatment effect and the populations included in the EU and in the US differed in certain baseline disease 
characteristics (hand and feet involvement, duration of psoriasis, mean baseline PASI score and rate of 
prior systemic treatment). This might have contributed to a heterogeneous treatment response between 
both regions, as efficacy results also indicate a trend towards higher efficacy of both products (biosimilar 
and reference product) in the EU region.  
A comprehensive overview of all available US results and a thorough discussion on the appropriateness of 
basing the decision of the EU marketing authorization on US data only was submitted. For the US region, 
comparable efficacy of GP2017 and US-Humira was consistently demonstrated based on the primary, key 
secondary and other secondary endpoints. Equivalent efficacy was further supported by analyses of 
absolute change from baseline in PASI score and assessment of efficacy at an earlier time point (Week 
13). Furthermore, the study population recruited in the US region is regarded as representative of the 
moderate to severe psoriasis population. Based on the presented US data, it can be concluded that 
GP2017 and Humira show similar efficacy in the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis, and that in 
view of the totality of data provided in this application the US region results adequately support a 
marketing authorization in the EU. 
The safety and immunogenicity results of the comparative studies in healthy volunteers and psoriasis 
patients broadly support biosimilarity of GP2017 and Humira; only some minor differences were 
identified. The observed adverse events mirror those described in the Humira SmPC.  
3.5  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The Applicant presented a comprehensive set of models on the quality, preclinical and clinical level to 
justify extrapolation to all indications of Humira.  
3.6  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, Hefiya is considered biosimilar to Humira. Therefore, a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
Assessment report

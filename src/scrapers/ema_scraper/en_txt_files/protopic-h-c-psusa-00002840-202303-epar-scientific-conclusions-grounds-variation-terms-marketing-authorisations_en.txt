Scientific conclusions  
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for , the scientific conclusions of the 
PRAC are as follows:  
In view of available data on the risk of significant systemic absorption when used off-label to treat 
pyoderma gangrenosum from cases in the literature, the PRAC concluded that the product information of 
products containing topical tacrolimus should be amended to add pyoderma gangrenosum to the list of 
conditions mentioned in the SmPC for which tacrolimus ointment is not recommended. 
Having reviewed the PRAC recommendation, the CHMP agrees with the PRAC overall conclusions and 
grounds for recommendation. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for tacrolimus (topical formulations) the CHMP is of the opinion 
that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing tacrolimus (topical formulations) is 
unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

SCIENTIFIC DISCUSSION 
1.1 
Introduction and rationale 
The MAH submitted an extension application under Annex II, point 2 iii to Commission Regulation  (EC) 
No  1085/2003 to request the approval of a 150 mg tablet as a monthly dosing regimen of ibandronate only 
for  the  indication  of  “treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, in  order to  reduce the risk of 
vertebral fractures”. This claim is based on the results of a phase III study MOBILE (BM16549) comparing 
100 and 150 mg once monthly to 2.5 mg once daily. 
Due to the inconveniences associated with intake of oral bisphosphonates (i.e. fasting conditions, frequent 
upper  gastrointestinal  intolerance)  that  may  result  in  poor  compliance,  it  was  considered  desirable  to 
develop a more convenient drug formulation. Hence a 150 mg once monthly oral regimen is expected to 
offer greater convenience to postmenopausal women when compared to the currently approved 2.5mg once 
daily tablet.  
The development programme 
No  new  pre-clinical  pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  performed  in  addition  to 
those  included  in  the  previous  submission  for  ibandronate  2.5  mg  daily  oral  tablets.  The  previously 
performed  studies  in  oestrogen-depleted  animal  models  had  demonstrated  the  intermittent  treatment  was 
equally effective when compared to daily treatment, provided the total cumulative dose was the same.  
Three  new  single  dose  toxicity  studies  and  two  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  (of  2  weeks  and  6  months 
duration  respectively),  with  i.v.-administered  ibandronate,  were  performed  in  rats.  In  the  6-month  study 
zoledronate was used as a reference compound. The goal of the toxicity studies was to further characterise 
the renal effects and in particular to assess the renal safety when using ibandronate iv.  
Four  clinical  studies  have  been  conducted  in  total  for  the  development  of  the  monthly  ibandronate 
formulations: Two bioequivalence studies (SB 743830/002 and SB 743830/003), a clinical pharmacology 
monthly  oral  pilot  study  (BP16331),  and  a  pivotal  Phase  III  study  (BM16549)  for  the  treatment  of 
postmenopausal  osteoporosis.  In  addition,  a  recently  completed  bioavailability  study  (BP16469)  was 
performed to collect further information with regard to the effect of food on oral doses of ibandronate. 
Quality aspects 
Introduction 
Composition 
Bonviva  is  presented  as  film-coated  tablets  containing  ibandronic  acid  as  the  active  substance  in  a  core 
formulation,  which  also  contains  lactose,  microcrystalline  cellulose,  crospovidone,  povidone,  stearic  acid 
and  colloidal  silica.  The  film  coating  consists  of  a  conventional  Opadry/macrogol  6000  mixture.  The 
product is packaged in alu-blisters. 
Active Substance  
Ibandronic  acid  is  present  in  the  tablets  as  the  sodium  salt  monohydrate.  Two  polymorphs  of  the  drug 
substance  have  been  identified.  Both  polymorphic  forms  have  similar  solubility  and  intrinsic  dissolution 
properties, therefore no  effect of the crystal  modification on the in  vivo drug release is expected. This is 
confirmed  by  dissolution  profiles  of  two  20  mg  ibandronate  batches  prepared  with  different  crystalline 
modifications in the drug substance. The modification present in the finished product is the same as in the 
respective active substance lot used for the manufacture.

The active substance quality and the batch control test procedures are identical to the ones that have already 
been approved for the 2.5 mg strength. The stability of the active substance has already been demonstrated 
with studies performed in accordance with the ICH requirements. 
Medicinal Product  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The  formulation  is  based  on  the  development  of  the  2.5  mg  strength.    The  pharmaceutical  development 
resulted in tablets that dissolve rapidly in aqueous media.  
The  film-coated  tablets  are  formulated  with  well-known  excipients,  which  are  identical  to  those  used  for 
the 2.5 mg strength. All excipients comply with Eur. Ph. Lactose monohydrate derives from cow’s milk. 
The milk is sourced from healthy animals in the same conditions as milk collected for human consumption.

Manufacture of the Product 
The  manufacturing  process  involves  conventional  operations  such  as  granulations,  drying,  sieving, 
blending, tablet compressing and film-coating. 
All critical process parameters have been identified and are controlled by appropriate in process controls. 
The validation report demonstrates that the process is robust and produces tablets of consistent quality. 
Product Specification 
The  finished  product  specification  at  release  includes  tests  for  assay,  and  uniformity  of  content, 
disintegration, and microbiological aspects. The specifications are in line with ICH Q6A and identical to the 
specifications  approved  for  the  2.5  mg,  except  for  the  limits  on  degradation  products,  which  have  been 
decreased. The control tests comply with Ph. Eur. where relevant. 
Stability of the Product 
Stability  studies  were  carried  out  according  to  the  ICH  requirements.  The  parameters  tested  were  assay, 
degradation products, colour and disintegration. 
In  all  cases  the  stability  results  presented  were  satisfactory  and  support  the  proposed  shelf-life  for  the 
commercially packaged product under the conditions specified in the SPC.  
Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects. 
This is a conventional standard formulation of a soluble substance resulting in a rapidly dissolving tablet. 
The active substance is very stable well characterised and documented. The excipients are commonly used 
and comply with Ph. Eur. requirements. The packaging material is commonly used and well documented. 
The manufacturing process of the finished product is a standard process that has been adequately described. 
Stability  tests  indicate  that  the  product  under  ICH  guidelines  conditions  is  chemically  stable  for  the 
proposed shelf life. 
Non-clinical aspects 
Introduction 
The ‘Note for Guidance on Postmenopausal Osteoporosis in Women’ (CPMP/EWP/522/95 rev 1; London, 
January  2001)  recommends  for  medicinal  products  aimed  for  use  in  prevention  and/or  treatment  of 
3
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
postmenopausal  osteoporosis  in  women  an  evaluation  of  bone  quality  in  two  species;  the  adult 
ovariectomised rat and an other animal with oestrogen deficiency. The studies should cover a period of 6 
remodelling  cycles  and  should  include  bone  mass  and  bone  density  measurements,  bone  architecture, 
histology and histomorphometry as well as biomechanical testing of bone strength. These studies have been 
submitted with the original Marketing Authorisation application. The new studies presented to support the 
current application for 150 mg once a month are toxicological studies discussed in the relevant section. 
Pharmacology 
There have been no new pharmacological studies performed. The non-clinical primary pharmacology data 
previously  submitted  as  part  of  the  initial  MAA  for  the  2.5  mg  film-coated  tablets  included  daily  and 
rats,  OVX  dogs  and 
intermittent  administration  of 
ovariohysterectomised (OHX) monkeys and provide a good basis for the intended intermittent ibandronate 
administration  in  humans.  The  results  of  these  studies  have  been  assessed  previously  and  are  now 
summarised in a published study (Bauss and Russel, 20041).  
in  ovariectomised 
ibandronate 
(OVX) 
The duration of action of intermittently applied ibandronate most likely depends on a combination of dose, 
dosing  frequency,  and  underlying  bone  turnover  rate.  Taking  into  account  the  age-dependent  and  OVX-
dependent bone turnover changes in rats, it can be concluded that the bone remodelling time in OVX rats is 
about 5-6 times less than in humans. Since the bone remodelling time in pre-menopausal humans is about 
90-120 days, the bone remodelling time in OVX rats can be calculated to be about 15-24 days. Thus, the 
therapy-free  interval  of  2,  4  and  6  weeks  tested  in  OVX  rats  roughly  represents  1,  2  and  3  remodelling 
cycles  in  rats.  Conversely,  a  monthly  dosing  interval  in  humans,  which  was  tested  in  the  clinical  study 
(BM16549/MOBILE), would correspond to a dosing interval of about 10 days in monkeys and of about 5-8 
days in rats. Therefore, the studies performed in rats, dogs and monkeys roughly reflect a dosing duration 
of  up  to  5  years  in  humans.  Since  bone  re-modelling  times  in  postmenopausal  women  are  increased,  the 
numbers  calculated  can  be  regarded  as  a  conservative  estimate.  Overall,  these  data  indicate  that  the 
intermittent treatment regimens with ibandronate have been appropriately compared between species. 
The  safety  pharmacology  programme  for  the  2.5mg/day  treatment  regimen  also  supports  intermittent 
dosing. 
Overall,  the  previously  submitted  non-clinical  pharmacology  data  support  the  present  application  (line 
extension) for the oral intermittent dosing with 150 mg ibandronate once monthly.  
Pharmacokinetics 
ADME studies were performed in the rat, dog and monkey and submitted with the initial MAA for the 2.5 mg 
film-coated tablet. No new Pharmacokinetic data were submitted as part of this application. 
The  non-clinical  pharmacokinetic  studies  with  ibandronate  showed  the  known  characteristics  of 
aminobisphosphonates: A very low absorption rate from the GI tract, a high affinity to bone (about 40-50% 
of  the  administered  ibandronate  is  located  in  bone  with  a  very  long  half-life  of  300-500  days),  no 
biotransformation of the drug and a predominantly renal excretion of the unmetabolised drug. 
It  was  shown  in  OVX  rats  that  the  concentration  of  ibandronate  in  vertebrae  (L1)  and  tibia  was  dose-
dependent  and  linear.  Importantly,  subcutaneous  ibandronate  dosing  once  daily  or  cyclical  intermittent 
every 25 days resulted in similar concentrations of ibandronate in vertebrae and tibia, if the applied total 
(cumulative) dose was about the same. These findings provide the basis for the similar pharmacodynamic 
effects observed with daily or intermittently applied ibandronate in rats.

The previously submitted toxicology programme characterised extensively the toxicity of ibandronate and 
supported the daily administration of 2.5 mg ibandronate for the treatment of postmenopausal women.  
In support of the monthly oral regimen for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis three new single 
dose  toxicity  studies  and  two  new  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies  (with  ibandronate  administered  by  the 
intravenous route) were submitted. These new GLP-studies were conducted to support the renal safety of 
intermittent dosing.  
Single dose toxicity studies 
The three new single-dose studies were conducted in order to characterise the minimum nephrotoxic 
dose and the impact of Cmax on the incidence and severity of renal lesions. 
In the first study, groups of 5-6 female Wistar rats were administered a single i.v.dose of 1-20 mg/kg 
ibandronic acid as a bolus dose and/or an i.v. infusion over 2.5-60 minutes. A Non Toxic Effect Level 
(NTEL) was not established since most animals had minimal microscopical degeneration or necrosis 
of PCT cells at 1 mg/kg. This is consistent with the NTEL of 0.3 mg/kg established in earlier studies 
of intermittent i.v. dosing in the rat.  
In the second study, 3 groups of 11 male Wistar rats were administered 1 mg/kg ibandronic acid by 
bolus  i.v.  or  a  15-minute  i.v.  infusion.  Two  of  the  groups  had  undergone  unilateral  nephroectomy 
whereas  a  sham  operation  was  performed  on  the  controls.  As  expected,  serum  creatinine  and  urea 
increased  in  the  unilaterally  nephrectomised  animals.  However,  there  was  no  difference  in  the 
histopathological lesions in the PCT between treatment groups and controls. 
In the last single-dose study, groups of 6 female Wistar rats were given an i.v. bolus injection of 1, 3, 
6 or 10 mg/kg of zolendronate or 1 or 3 mg/kg of ibandronic acid. Half the animals were examined 
one day after treatment and the remainder after 4 days. With both drugs, subclinical histopathological 
changes in the PCT were observed after 4 days at doses equal to or higher than 3 mg/kg.  
Repeat-dose toxicity Studies 
Two new repeat-dose studies were conducted in order to characterise the impact of Cmax and repeated 
dosing  on  the  incidence  and  severity  of  renal  lesions  and  to  assess  the  risk  for  cumulative  kidney 
toxicity in an intermittent i.v. dose regimen. 
In  the  first  study,  groups  of  5  male  and  female  Wistar  rats  were  treated  for  2  weeks  with  0,  1  or  3 
mg/kg/day of ibandronic acid by i.v. bolus injection, i.v. infusion over 15 minutes or i.v. infusion over 
60 minutes. One 3 mg/kg/day female died on day 10, presumably from acute renal failure. There was 
a  dose-  and  infusion-time-related  increase  in  serum  ALT,  AST,  creatinine  and  urea,  incidence  of 
kidney  discoloration,  absolute  and  relative  kidney  weight  and  microscopic  kidney  lesions  (tubular 
basophilia, dilatation, casts and necrosis), with secondary effects on body weight, food consumption 
and serum electrolytes.  
In the second repeat-dose toxicity study, ibandronic acid was administered as an i.v. bolus injection or 
15-30 minute-infusion to groups of 6 female Wistar rats at dose levels of  0 or 1 mg/kg every 3 weeks 
for a total of 6 months. One group remained untreated until the last study week and then received a 
single  i.v.  bolus  injection  (singe-dose  group).  This  study  design  was  also  applied  to  zolendronate 
which  was  administered  at  1  and  3  mg/kg/3  weeks  as  a  positive  control.  At  1  mg/kg  both 
bisphosphonates  caused  degeneration  and/or  necrosis  of  PCT  cells  which  was  somewhat  more 
frequent after repeat than after single dosing. Repeat dosing of either drug also caused mild epithelial 
cell  hypertrophy  and  hyperplasia  of  the  collecting  ducts  and  distal  tubules,  whereas  these  structures 
were not affected by single dosing. The incidence and severity of these changes were unrelated to the 
Cmax of ibandronic acid.

Ibandronate – Drug interaction 
Specific  toxicology  studies  with  combined  treatment  of  ibandronate  with  other  potentially  nephrotoxic 
drugs  were  not  conducted.  However,  a  number  of  dedicated  nephrotoxicity  studies  were  performed  in 
animals  to  examine  the  renal  effects  in  more  detail,  especially  minimal  nephrotoxic  doses,  to  better 
understand the underlying pathomechanism, and to further evaluate the risk of renal safety under specific 
treatment  regimes.  The  results  from  these  studies  and  the  published  information  on  other  classes  of 
potentially nephrotoxic compounds, allows a risk assessment for the combination of ibandronate with other 
drugs  based  on  theoretical  considerations,  i.e.  comparison  of  findings  and  pathomechanisms.  The  main 
outcome of this risk assessment is summarised in the table 1. below:

Based on the above, there is no overt evidence that co-administration of ibandronate with other commonly 
used potentially nephrotoxic, drugs is likely to increase the risk of nephropathy. 
Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The  Environmental  Risk  Assessment  (ERA)  was  revised  to  account  for  the  increase  in  use,  which  may 
result from the line extension. Including all brands, dosage forms and strengths, the revised risk quotient is 
0.011. Since this is lower than 1, it is agreed that the proposed line extension is unlikely to result in any 
perceivable risk to the environment. 
Reproductive and developmental studies 
Reproduction and developmental toxicity studies were not performed, but are not required, as ibandronate 
will only be used in postmenopausal women.   
Local tolerance / Skin irritation studies 
6
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Ibandronic acid proved corrosive in a skin irritation test in rabbits. Although this route is irrelevant to the 
proposed line extension, it nevertheless indicates that there may be a potential for irritation or burns to the 
oesophagus and/or gastric mucosa, particularly as the proposed tablet is 60 times stronger than the currently 
marketed  product.  However,  the  potential  for  the  150-mg  tablet  to  cause  GI  tract  intolerance  was  not 
evaluated non-clinically, but monitored closely in clinical trials. Since it would be impractical to administer 
the 150-mg tablet to experimental animals, this approach is considered acceptable. 
Other toxicity studies 
Other safety aspects (including potential of genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, local tolerance, skin irritation and 
sensitization,  the  risk  of  QT/QTc  interval  prolongation  and  all  pharmacodynamic  related  effects)  are 
considered to remain unaffected by the change of the treatment regimen from daily to monthly intervals.  
Discussion 
The new non-clinical studies to support the 150 mg dose once a month have focused on the toxicology of 
the dose and more specifically on the renal safety. 
Three  single-dose  toxicity  studies  (as  presented  above)  were  conducted  to  characterise  the  minimum 
nephrotoxic  dose  and  the  impact  of  Cmax  on  the  incidence  and  severity  of  renal  lesions.  In  all  studies, 
ibandronic acid was administered by i.v. bolus injection or by short-term i.v. infusion. The LTEL (Lowest 
Toxic Effect Level) was 1 mg/kg. At this dose level, unilateral nephrectomy did not increase the incidence 
and  severity  of  PCT  lesions  in  the  remaining  kidney.  In  a  study  (ies)  comparing  ibandronic  acid  with 
zolendronate (which has been reported to cause isolated cases of acute renal insufficiency in patients), both 
drugs caused similar pathology and the LTEL was 3 mg/kg in both cases.  
When ibandronic acid was administered by i.v. injection or infusion at different speeds for 2 weeks at 0, 1 
or  3  mg/kg/day,  all  changes  in  kidney  pathology  and  kidney-related  clinical  chemistry  parameters  were 
found to depend on the Cmax values whereas pharmacodynamic effects such as changes in serum calcium 
and red blood cells (RBC) parameters were independent of injection speed. 
In a 6-month study in which ibandronic acid was administered by i.v. injection or infusion at 0 or 1 mg/kg 
every  3  weeks  or  once  at  the  end  of  the  study,  the  only  abnormal  finding  was  subclinical  degeneration 
and/or  necrosis  of  PCT  cells  and  mild  epithelial  cell  hypertrophy  and  hyperplasia  of  the  collecting  ducts 
and  distal  tubules.  There  was  no  relationship  between  Cmax  values  and  the  incidence  or  severity  of  these 
findings. The severity of the PCT lesions was similar after single and repeat dosing, but the frequency was 
somewhat  higher  after  repeat  dosing  (2/6  animals)  than  after  single  dosing  (1/6  animals).  Lesions  of  the 
distal tubules and collecting ducts were only seen after repeat dosing. 
Renal  safety  margins  were  calculated  based  on  human  AUC  and  Cmax  values  determined  in  a 
bioequivalence study in postmenopausal women and from a supplementary Phase I study, using maximum 
values as well as the upper bound of the 90% confidence interval. Since there are no repeat-dose toxicity 
studies  using  intermittent  oral  administration,  animal  AUC  and  Cmax  values  were  based  on  rat  and  dog 
studies using either intermittent (twice monthly) i.v. or daily oral administration of ibandronic acid. Based 
on maximum human values of 1000 ng.h/ml and 250 ng/ml, respectively, the AUC-based safety margins 
ranged  from  1-3  and  Cmax-based  safety  margins  were  about  5-17.  Based  on  the  upper  bound  of  the  90% 
confidence  intervals,  safety  margins  were  approximately  twice  as  high.  These  safety  margins  are 
comparable  to  those  observed  with  other  bisphosphonates  and/or  dosing  regimens  and  suggest  that  the 
proposed dosing regimen of 150 mg ibandronic acid p.o. once a month is unlikely to be associated with any 
significant risk of kidney toxicity. 
Specific toxicology studies with combined treatment of ibandronate with other potentially nephrotoxic drug 
were  not  conducted.  Based  on  the  available  knowledge  about  the  underlying  pathomechanisms  of  the 
nephrotoxicity  of  ibandronate  and  published  information  from  other  classes  of  potentially  nephrotoxic 
compounds,  there  is  no  overt  evidence  that  co-administration  of  ibandronate  with  other  commonly  used, 
potentially nephrotoxic, drugs is likely to increase the risk of nephropathy.

Clinical aspects 
Introduction 
An extensive clinical pharmacokinetic evaluation of ibandronate has been performed and submitted in 
the  original  MAA  for  Bonviva  2.5  mg  daily.  To  support  this  line  extension  application  (150  mg), 
clinical studies have been performed in order to investigate the tolerability, relative bioavailability and 
effect  on  bone  turnover  of  three  monthly  oral  doses  of  ibandronate  (BP16331),  the  bioequivalence  of 
single-unit  tablets  to  multiples  of  the  50  mg  tablets  (SB743830/003  and  SB743830/002),  and 
bioavailability of various time intervals between food and tablet intake (BP16469). Additionally, in support 
of the newly proposed indication “treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis” 2-year efficacy and safety 
data from the pivotal non-inferiority phase III study, BM16549 (MOBILE) was submitted. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic data submitted during the original MAA for Bonviva 2.5 mg daily were derived 
from  over  700  subjects  (including  studies  performed  in  healthy  male  volunteers,  healthy 
postmenopausal women, postmenopausal women with osteoporosis, patients with varying degrees of 
renal  impairment  and  in  patients  with  metastatic  bone  disease)  within  24  clinical  pharmacology 
studies,  one phase  II  study  (MF  4427)  and  from  clinical  pharmacology  assessments  within  2 
therapeutic trials (MF 4386, MF 4348). In support of the once monthly oral regimen four additional 
PK studies have been performed: 
A pilot Phase I study in postmenopausal women to investigate the tolerability, relative bioavailability and 
effect on bone turnover of three monthly oral doses of ibandronate (50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg) given as 
multiples of 50 mg tablets (BP16331). Two studies investigating the bioequivalence of single-unit tablets 
(100  mg  and  150  mg)  to  multiples  of  the  50  mg  tablets  (SB743830/003  and  SB743830/002).  Finally,  a 
study,  which  investigated  the  effect  on  bioavailability  of  various  time  intervals  between  food  and  tablet 
intake, performed since the original MAA, is also included (BP16469). 
These  studies  were  submitted  as  part  of  the  current  application  and  provided  additional  information 
regarding dose dependency of ibandronate PK as well as new information regarding the importance of time 
intervals between administration of ibandronate and intake of food.  
Apart  from  this  information  no  new  data  regarding  the  ADME  for  ibandronate  has  been  included. 
Moreover, two single-dose  studies  have been undertaken to demonstrate bioequivalence between the 100 
mg or 150 mg tablets intended for marketing and multiples of 50 mg tablets used in the clinical studies. 
The  methods  used  are  appropriate  for  the  studies  undertaken.  For  studies  on  bioavailability  or 
bioequivalence the methods used are in accordance with the CPMP “Note for Guidance on Postmenopausal 
Osteoporosis in Women”. Analytical methods are the same as used in the original MAA for ibandronate 2.5 
mg once daily raising no concerns regarding comparability of results. 
Bioavailability 
No new data is presented. The original MAA investigated the dose proportionality in the range 2.5-50 
mg orally and found no signs of dose-dependent PK. Oral bioavailability and dose proportionality for 
oral doses above 50 mg were investigated in the pilot study BP 16331.  
The oral bioavailability of ibandronate is low (~0.6%), highly variable and is markedly reduced in the 
presence  of  food  (see  also  below).  After  oral  administration,  ibandronate  is  rapidly  absorbed  with 
median peak plasma concentrations reached by one hour.

Dose dependency 
Ibandronate 50, 100 and 150 mg (all as multiples of 50 mg tablets) were administered as oral doses 
every 30 days for 3 months. Serum samples for ibandronate measurement were collected following the 
first  dose  only;  urine  samples  were  collected  following  the  first  and  third  dose  of  ibandronate  to 
characterize the pharmacokinetics of ibandronate. The relative bioavailabilities of the 100 mg and 150 
mg dose relative to the 50 mg dose are shown in Table 2 below.

The  exposure  following  administration  of  50,  100  or  150 mg  as  multiples  of  50  mg  tablets  was  not 
dose  proportional,  with  both  AUC  and  Cmax  showing  greater  increase  in  exposure  with  increasing 
dose.  
From  a  pure  mathematical  point  of  view  70  mg  once  monthly  corresponds  to  2.5  mg  daily  in 
cumulative  dose  and  modelling  of  data  from  the  pivotal  study  supporting  the  daily  dosage  regime 
(MF4411) suggests that 100 mg once monthly is likely to provide comparable BMD increase as daily 
treatment.  However,  by  choosing  150  mg  as  target  for  once  monthly  therapy  it  is  aimed  at 
demonstrating superiority compared to once daily dosing and further compensate for the long interval 
between dosing (also discussed below). 
The study BM 16549 (MOBILE) was designed to demonstrate that the 1- and 2- year increases in lumbar 
spine  BMD  with  a  monthly  regimen  were  non-inferior  to  the  daily-approved  regimen,  with  clinical 
fractures being recorded as adverse events. It allows also the comparison between the 150 mg and 100 mg 
regimens regarding the BMD as it is discussed below. The results of the study are discussed in detail in the 
Clinical Efficacy section. 
Drug-food interaction 
It  is  currently  recommended  that  ibandronate  is  taken  60  minutes  before  food  based  on  studies 
included  in  the  original  MAA.  In  order  to  further  characterise  the  effect  of  various  time  intervals 
between food and tablet intake on the bioavailability of ibandronate a new study (BP 16469) has been 
provided. 
Twenty-four healthy male volunteers received, according to a randomized crossover design, a 20 mg 
tablet  at  the  following  times  relative  to  a  standard  meal:  3 hours  after  a  meal  with  a  second 
standardized meal 1 hour post dose (Treatment A); 4 hours after a meal, with a second meal 1 hour 
post dose (Treatment B); 4 hours after a standardized meal in the evening with the subjects becoming 
supine  1  hour  post  dose  (Treatment  C);  and  1  hour  before  the  first  meal  of  the  day  (Treatment  D).  
Blood  and  urine  samples  were  collected  for  24  hours  after  drug  administration  to  determine  the 
pharmacokinetics of ibandronate. 
Mean serum concentration-time profiles for the four treatments are shown in Figure 1 and the values 
for relative bioavailability are presented in Table 3.

Following administration of ibandronate after an overnight fast (reference), serum levels rose rapidly, 
reaching an average maximum concentration of 3.9 ng/mL with a mean tmax of 0.75 hours, and then 
declined  in  a  multiphasic  manner.    Lower  exposures  were  observed  for  the  two  treatments  which 
simulated a mid-day administration, with the average maximum concentrations reduced by about one 
third following a 4 hour pre-dose fast and to only about one fifth of the reference level following a 3 
hour  pre-dose fast. For an evening administration, where dosing followed a 4 hour fast but subjects 
then  retired  at  1  hour  post-dose,  the  average  maximum  concentration  was  similar  to  that  for  the 
reference  fasted  treatment  (reference).  However,  an  evening  dose  is  not  recommended  due  to 
practicalities such as staying fasted for four hours after the evening meal and timing the bedtime to be 
at least five hours after the evening meal. 
This  study  has  substantially  contributed  to  the  knowledge  of  the  sensitivity  of  ibandronate  to  food 
administration.

Dose proportionality 
The original MAA investigated the dose proportionality in the range 2.5-50 mg orally and found no 
signs of dose-dependent PK. In the BP16331 study, 36 postmenopausal women each received 50 mg 
(1 × 50 mg tablet), 100 mg (2 × 50 mg tablets), or 150 mg (3 × 50 mg tablets) oral doses every 30 
days for 3 months. The 50 mg group was subdivided into two groups of 18; one group received 50 mg 
on all 3 occasions and a second group that received 50 mg for the first dose and 100 mg (2 × 50 mg) 
for the second and third doses (50/100 mg group). Serum samples for ibandronate measurement were 
collected following the first dose only; urine samples were collected following the first and third dose 
of ibandronate to characterize the pharmacokinetics of ibandronate. 
Mean serum concentration-time profiles for the four treatments are shown in Figure 2. Variability in 
serum  concentrations  at  individual  time  points  within  treatments  was  high  and  this  was  reflected  in 
estimates of peak concentration (Cmax) and AUC with coefficients of variation across the three doses 
in the ranges 66 - 206% and 57 - 158% respectively. Average estimated half-lives were 27, 33, 59 and 
72  hours  for  subjects  receiving  50 mg,  50/100  mg,  100 mg  and  150 mg  respectively.  This  apparent 
trend  towards  increased  half-life  with  increasing  dose  is  a  direct  consequence  of  the  incomplete 
description of the very slow rate of decline of the terminal portion of individual curves. This is caused 
by  the  generally  lower  serum  concentrations  with  low  doses  that  frequently  were  below  the 
quantification limit before reaching the scheduled last time point.

The relative bioavailabilities of the 100 mg and 150 mg dose relative to the 50 mg dose are shown in 
Table 4. The exposure following  administration of  50, 100 or 150 mg as multiples of 50 mg tablets 
was  not  dose  proportional,  with  both  AUC  and  Cmax  showing  greater  increase  in  exposure  with 
increasing dose. The reason for this dose-dependent PK with doses above 50 mg has not been fully 
elucidated, but was not associated with any adverse events or other safety issues.

Knowing  that  bisphosphonates  are  nephrotoxic  in  animals  and  may  be  associated  with  rare  skeletal 
adverse events such as aseptic osteonecrosis, the long-term safety (> 12 month) of the 150 mg once 
monthly dose in comparison to the current 2.5 mg daily administration has been carefully considered 
(see clinical safety). 
Bioequivalence  
Bioequivalence  of  a  single  100  mg  or  150  mg  tablet  of  ibandronate  relative  to  2  ×  50  mg  or  3  ×  50  mg 
tablets of ibandronate was evaluated in study SB 743830/003 (100 mg) and study SB 743830/002 (150 mg) 
respectively. 
The single unit dose tablet formulation of 100 mg was bioequivalent to 2x50 mg tablets. The single unit 
dose  tablet  formulation  of  150  mg  was  bioequivalent  to  3x50  mg  tablets.  In  both  studies  the  90% 
confidence  intervals  for  the  ratio  of  the  adjusted  geometric  means  for  ibandronate  AUC(0-∞)  and  Cmax 
were contained within the acceptance range of 0.80 to 1.25 according to the CPMP “Note for guidance on 
the  investigation  of  bioavailability  and  bioequivalence”,  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98,  rev.  2001).  This 
range  was  prespecified  in  the  study  protocol  for  AUC,  but  not  for  Cmax  (the  prespecified  equivalence 
range for Cmax was 0.75 to 1.33).  
Bioequivalence between the 100 mg or 150 mg tablets intended for marketing and the corresponding 
doses given as multiples of 50 mg tablets has been demonstrated. 
Distribution 
No  new  data  has  been  provided  which  is  acceptable.  From  the  original  MAA  it  is  known  that  the 
volume  of  distribution  is  high  (~90L),  most  likely  related  to  substantial  distribution  within  skeletal 
tissue, i.e. preclinical studies indicating that ibandronate binds primarily to bone, with some uptake in 
the  spleen,  liver  and  kidney.  The  amount  of  dose  removed  from  the  circulation  via  the  bone  is 
estimated to be 40% to 50%. Ibandronate is moderately bound to human plasma proteins (84% - 86% 
at  therapeutic  drug  concentrations)  and  is  not  taken  up  by  erythrocytes  or  platelets.  The  protein 
binding  for  ibandronate  is  relatively  constant  over  clinically  relevant  concentrations  (0.5  -  2000 
ng/mL).  
Elimination 
No new data has been provided, but only the following information is available. Plasma elimination of 
ibandronate is multiphasic. Renal clearance and distribution into bone accounts for the rapid and early 
decline in plasma concentrations, which reach 10% of the Cmax within 3 to 8 hours. This is followed 
by  a slower  clearance  as  ibandronate  redistributes  back into the blood from the bone. The observed 
apparent terminal half-life for ibandronate is generally in the range of 10 to 72 hours, but this is likely 
to be a gross underestimate as the values calculated are largely a function of the duration of study, the 
12
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
dose used and assay sensitivity. The ‘true’ terminal half-life is likely to be substantially longer than 72 
hours as is common with other bisphosphonates. 
Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No  new  in  vitro  data  has  been  submitted.  Due  to  the  lack  of  biotransformation  of  ibandronate  the 
potential for drug-drug interactions through inhibition or induction of CYP-isozymes are unlikely to 
occur. 
No  new  in  vitro  data  has  been  submitted.  The  active  renal  secretory  pathway  that  appears  to  be 
involved  is  specialized,  involving  neither  acidic  nor  basic  tubular  transport  processes  and  thus, 
ibandronate  is  not  anticipated  to  interfere  with  the  excretion  of  other  drugs  by  those  systems  in 
humans.  Potential  pharmacokinetic  interactions  between  ibandronate  and  drugs  likely  to  be 
concurrently  administered  and  whose  pharmacology  suggested  a  potential  interaction  have  been 
examined.  Interaction  studies  in  postmenopausal  women  and  in  patients  with  multiple  myeloma 
demonstrated the absence of any interaction potential with tamoxifen, hormone replacement therapy 
(estrogen),  or  melphalan/prednisone.  Although  ranitidine  caused  an  increase  in  ibandronate 
bioavailability  of  about  20%,  this  is  considered  to  be  of  no  clinical  significance  and  no  dose 
adjustment  is  required  when  ibandronate  is  administered  with  H2-antagonists  or  other  drugs  that 
increase gastric pH. In addition to the low and variable absorption of ibandronate in the presence of 
food, products containing calcium and other multivalent cations, such as aluminium, magnesium and 
iron, are likely to interfere with absorption. 
Pharmacodynamics 
The  antiresorptive  effects  of  bisphosphonates  are  well  established  and  have  not  been  further 
investigated  in  the  present  application.  However,  dose  finding  for  the  once  monthly  treatment  has 
been performed in a pilot Phase I study investigating the tolerability, relative bioavailability and effect 
on  bone  turnover  of  three  monthly  oral  doses  of  ibandronate  (50 mg,  100  mg  or  150  mg)  given  as 
multiples  of  50  mg  tablets.  Urinary  markers  of  bone  turnover  were  used  as  primary  endpoint.  In 
addition to these studies results from computer PK/PD-simulations have been provided investigating 
the behaviour of a monthly oral ibandronate regimen in terms of effect on the urinary excretion of the 
C-telopeptide of the alpha chain of type I collagen (uCTX). Studies of hormone replacement therapy 
and  alendronate  therapy  suggest  that  a  ‘threshold’  level  of  suppression  of  biochemical  markers  of 
bone turnover is predictive for a positive and clinically meaningful response in BMD. Attainment of 
steady state in uCTX under regular dosing as well as non-compliant patient behaviour was explored 
using this PK/PD model. 
Results  from  this  simulation  clearly  shows  that  both  once  monthly  doses  are  expected  to  result  in 
relative  suppression  of  uCTX  equivalent  to  that  which  has  been  seen  with  the  current  2.5  mg  daily 
dosing  recommendation.  Moreover,  the  PK/PD  model  was  also  used  to  evaluate  the  effect  of  non-
compliance (e.g. missed doses or ‘late’ doses) on the time course and AUC for uCTX (percent change 
from baseline). This simulation show that if one monthly dose is missed after 1, 2, 3, 6 and 8 regular 
doses, a small increase in AUC of uCTX is incurred (between 2.5% and 16.7% increase in AUC as 
compared to compliant drug intake over 15 months), with the uCTX time course profiles reconciling 
within  3  months.    If  the  dose  is  taken  ‘late’  e.g.  within  7  days  of  the  next  scheduled  dose,  then  a 
smaller  transient  increase  in  the  AUC  of  uCTX  of  ~  0.7%  is  predicted,  with  the  uCTX  time  course 
profiles  reconciling  within  6  months.  Thus,  based  on  mathematical  modelling  on  marker  of  bone 
turnover, there is no concern that a 3-week delayed or even a missed dose may compromise efficacy. 
‘Real  life’  compliance  with  their  once  monthly  therapy  as  compared  to  e.g.  daily  or  weekly  dosage 
regimens is to be submitted post-authorisation.   
Clinical efficacy  
Introduction 
13
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The approval of a 2.5 mg daily oral tablet formulation of ibandronate for the prevention and treatment of 
postmenopausal  osteoporosis  (February  2004)  was  based  on  the  results  of  the  pivotal  Phase 3  study 
MF4411,  in  which  a  reduction  in  the  risk  of  new  morphometric  vertebral  fractures  and  progressive 
increases  in  bone  mineral  density  (BMD)  in  lumbar  spine  and  hip  of  patients  with  postmenopausal 
osteoporosis was demonstrated. 
Clinical Studies 
In support of the newly proposed indication “treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis” 2-year efficacy 
and safety data from the pivotal non-inferiority phase III study, BM16549 (MOBILE) is submitted.   
The evaluation of the efficacy of the once monthly treatment of osteoporotic postmenopausal women with 
ibandronate  is  based  on  a  single  pivotal  multicenter,  randomised,  double-blind,  parallel  group  Phase  III 
study  (BM16549)  which  was  designed  to  demonstrate  non-inferiority,  in  terms  of  lumbar  BMD  changes 
from baseline, between daily and monthly ibandronate applications. 
The study enrolled 1609 postmenopausal women between the age of 54 and 80 years who had osteoporosis 
as  indicated  by  a  lumbar  spine  (L2  –  L4)  BMD  T-score  of  <-2.5.  Patients  were  randomly  allocated  in  a 
double-blind manner to one of four treatment groups; 100 mg monthly (on a single day, n=402), 100 mg 
monthly  (split  over  two  consecutive  days,  n=404),  150  mg  monthly  (n=401)  and  2.5  mg  daily  (n=402). 
Stratification  according  to  baseline  lumbar  spine  BMD  was  performed  in  order  to  ensure  that  across  all 
treatment groups, the distribution of baseline BMD was comparable. Due to the large number of centres in 
this study, patients were also stratified by center.  
The study BM 16549 included women with a mean lumbar spine (L2 - L4) BMD T-score below -2.5 but 
not lower than -5.0 
A significant risk reduction for new vertebral fractures with 2.5 mg ibandronate daily was demonstrated in 
patients with a BMD T-score ≤ -2.0 SD and in the subgroup of patients with a BMD T-score ≤ -2.5 SD in 
the pivotal fracture study MF4411 (in original application). Thus regarding the study population there is no 
relevant difference between the studies MF4411 and BM16549.  
The doses of ibandronate were 2.5 mg/daily and 50/50 mg, 100 mg or 150 mg once monthly (to be taken in 
the morning with plain water after an overnight fast of at least 6 hours, and patients were to remain fasting 
and  upright  for  one  hour  post  dose).  As  generally  recommended,  all  patients  received  calcium  (500 
mg/day) and vitamin D (400 IU/day) supplements (to be taken in the evening). 
Bone  mineral  density  measurements  by  dual-energy  X-ray  absorptiometry  (DXA)  were  analysed  at  a 
central reading site. CTX measurements were performed at a central laboratory. Both the investigators and 
the sponsor were blinded to the results of the BMD and CTX analyses during the study.  
Results after 2 years 
Ibandronate  150  mg  once  monthly  was  associated  with  a  significant  and  robust  increase  in  BMD  at  the 
lumbar spine (LS) and proximal femur (Table 5). This increase was significantly and consistently greater 
than that seen with the 2.5 mg daily regimen after two years. Furthermore, the mean additional increase in 
BMD during the second year of treatment was greatest in the 150 mg monthly group (1.6%), as shown in 
Figure 3.

In addition, the increase in LS BMD after one and two years of treatment was consistently greater in the 
150 mg monthly Ibandronate group, when compared with 100 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily, in patients at 
highest risk for osteoporotic fractures (Table 6).

Responder Rate 
The “CPMP Note for Guidance on Postmenopausal Osteoporosis in Women (CPMP/EWP/552/95 rev 1)” 
defined responders to treatment as the incidence of patients who had an increase in BMD above baseline. 
In  study  BM  16549,  responders  were  defined  by  the  incidence  of  patients  who  had  an  increase  in  BMD 
above  or  equal  to  baseline,  and  also  as  the  incidence  of  patients  whose  lumbar  spine  or  total  hip  BMD 
increased by ≥ 6% or ≥ 3% from baseline, respectively, after one and two years of treatment.  
After one and two years of treatment with Ibandronate 150 mg once monthly, more than 90% of patients 
had an increase in lumbar spine or total hip BMD greater or equal to baseline, and this was significantly 
greater compared with the 2.5 mg daily treatment group (LS: Year 1, p = 0.008; Year 2, p = 0.004; TH: 
Year  1  and  Year  2,  p  <  0.001).  After  two  years,  the  incidence  of  responders  in  the  150  mg  monthly 
treatment group after 2 years was also greater than that in the 100 mg monthly treatment group at lumbar 
spine (93.5% vs. 87.8%; p = 0.019) and total hip (93.4% vs. 88.8%; p = 0.053).  
Considering  both  lumbar  spine  and  total  hip  BMD  increase,  after  one  and  two  years  of  treatment  with 
Ibandronate 150 mg once monthly, more than 80% of patients had an increase at both sites greater or equal 
to baseline. This BMD gain was significantly greater when compared  with the 2.5 mg daily (Year 1 and 
Year  2,  p  <  0.001)  treatment  group,  and  after  two  years  with  the  100  mg  monthly  (p =  0.014)  treatment 
group. 
The greatest incidence of patients with a lumbar spine BMD increase of ≥ 6% when compared to baseline, 
was seen in the 150 mg monthly Ibandronate group after one and two years of treatment (34.4% and 54.3% 
respectively); the incidence of responders was significantly greater than in the 2.5 mg daily treatment group 
(Year  1,  p  =  0.005  and  Year  2,  p  <  0.001),  and  significantly  greater  than  in  the  100  mg  monthly 
Ibandronate group after two years (p = 0.032). 
After one and two years of treatment, the greatest incidence of patients with a total hip BMD increase of 
≥ 3%  when  compared  to  baseline  was  seen  in  the  150  mg  monthly  Ibandronate  group;  the  incidence  of 
responders  was  significantly  greater  than  in  the  2.5  mg  daily  treatment  group  (Year  1  and  Year  2,  p  < 
0.001). Table 7 summarises these results.

The effect of monthly Ibandronate dosing on biochemical markers of bone turnover, are consistent with the 
higher level of BMD improvement over time.  
The 150 mg monthly dose produced significantly greater reductions in bone resorption activity (assessed 
using serum CTX) than the oral daily regimen (Table 9). Similarly, it also reduced bone formation (Table 
8)

Responders  were  defined  as  those  patients  with  a  decrease  in  serum  CTX  from  baseline  of  ≥  50%, 
corresponding to the least significant change, or ≥ 70%.  
The incidence of patients with a ≥ 50% decrease in serum CTX from baseline levels was greater in the 150 
mg  monthly  group  (Year  1,  83.1%;  Year  2,  78.7%),  than  in  the  100  mg  monthly  group  (Year  1,  71.0%; 
Year 2, 63.5%) and the 2.5 mg daily group (Year 1, 73.5%; Year 2, 65.6%). The incidence of responders 
after  one  and  two  years  of  treatment  was  significantly  greater  in  the  150  mg  monthly  treatment  group 
compared with the 2.5 mg daily treatment group (p < 0.05) (Table 9). 
Similarly,  the  incidence  of  patients  with  a  ≥ 70%  decrease  in  serum  CTX  from  baseline  levels  was  also 
greater in the 150 mg monthly group (Year 1, 62.5%; Year 2, 48.1%), than in the 100 mg monthly group 
(Year  1,  47.8%;  Year  2,  35.1%)  and  the  2.5  mg  daily  group  (Year  1,  44.1%;  Year  2,  35.3%)  (Table  9).

In  conclusion,  the  new  submitted  2-years  data  confirm  that  12-month  data  further  demonstrating 
significantly higher efficacy on BMD of the 150 mg dose compared to the daily dose and the lower 100 mg

Discussion 
The primary objective of the pivotal BM 16549 was to show non-inferiority of lumbar spine (L2 - L4) 
BMD changes after one year of treatment with oral ibandronate at monthly doses of 100 mg and 150 
mg,  versus  daily  treatment  with  2.5  mg  ibandronate.  As  the  mean  increase  in  lumbar  spine  BMD 
relative to baseline in all monthly treatment groups (4.1% - 4.9%) at one year was demonstrated to be 
non-inferior to the 2.5 mg daily regimen (3.9%) this objective was met.  
17
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Regarding  the  150  mg  monthly  treatment  regime,  the  increase  in  BMD  relative  to  baseline  was  in 
subsequent analyses shown to be superior to that in seen in the 2.5 mg daily treatment group. Subsequent 
post-hoc  analyses  revealed  that  treatment  with  monthly  doses  of  150  mg  ibandronate  was  superior  to 
monthly doses of 100 mg ibandronate. In all treatment groups an absolute increase from baseline in mean 
lumbar spine was observed after one year of treatment. At the proximal femur, increases from baseline in 
total hip (2.0% - 3.1%), femoral neck (1.7% - 2.2%) and trochanter (3.2% - 4.6%) BMD after one year of 
treatment with ibandronate were seen with both the daily and monthly treatment regimens.  
The mean increase in BMD was more pronounced for the 100 mg and 150 mg monthly treatment groups 
compared to the daily treatment group in the femoral neck and thereby the total hip, whereas this was not 
the  case  in  the  trochanter  region..  More  patients  treated  with  monthly  doses  of  100  mg  or  150  mg 
ibandronate  versus  daily  treatment  with  2.5  mg  ibandronate,  responded  to  treatment  with  an  increase  in 
BMD values equal to or above baseline at the lumbar spine, total hip and trochanter  
For both the 100 mg and 150 mg monthly treatment groups, more patients responded to treatment with an 
increase in lumbar spine BMD of 6%, or an increase in total hip BMD of 3% at one year than in the 2.5 mg 
daily treatment group. All dosing regimens of ibandronate suppressed bone resorption as assessed by serum 
CTX.  At  all  time  points the decrease in serum CTX was  greater in  the  150 mg monthly treatment group 
compared  to  the  other  groups.  More  patients  in  the  150  mg  monthly  treatment  group  were  classified  as 
responders and had a decrease in serum CTX from baseline of ≥ 50% or ≥ 70% than in the daily treatment 
group. 
The efficacy of ibandronate over 2 years in the study BM16549 confirms the results of the 1-year analysis. 
A significant greater effect (p<0.05) with 150 mg/monthly compared the 2.5 mg/daily application has been 
observed regarding the relative increase in spinal BMD from baseline (150 mg/mo: 4.76%, 1 y; 6.55%, 2 
y), or responder rate (LS BMD) judged as equal or increase from baseline (150 mg/mo: 90.8%, 1 y; 93.5%, 
2 y), or judged as increase from baseline > 6% (150 mg/month: 34.4%, 1 y; 54.3%, 2 y), or bone turnover 
judged as decrease in serum CTX trough values (150 mg/month: 76%, 1 y, 68%, 2 y), or judged as percent 
responder >50% decrease (83%, 1 y, 78%, 2 y), or >70% decrease (62%, 1 y, 48%, 2 y). 
A significant greater effect (p<0.05) with 150 mg/monthly compared to the 100 mg/month application has 
been observed regarding the relative increase in spinal BMD from baseline at 2 y (100 mg/month: 5.58%, 
150 mg/month: 6.55%). The responders in LS BMD increase judged as equal or increase from baseline at 2 
y (100 mg/month: 87.8%; 150 mg/month: 93.5%r), or judged as increase from baseline > 6% at 2 y (100 
mg/month: 45.3%; 150 mg/month: 54.3%) 
Since the increase in BMD obtained with bisphosphonates correlates with mechanical properties of bone, 
generally, an increase in BMD in shorter period of times could have a positive effect on the risk reduction 
of new vertebral fractures.  
Clinical safety 
Clinical safety data are available from the use of oral monthly ibandronate in the pivotal trial BM 16549 
comparing dosages of 100 mg and 150 mg monthly ibandronate to 2.5 mg daily ibandronate (N=1602). In 
addition, safety data are included from a pilot dose finding study BP 16331, a randomised, double blind, 
parallel-group,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  pilot  study  in  144  healthy  postmenopausal  women 
investigating  the  tolerability  and  safety,  pharmacokinetics  and  effect  on  bone  turnover  of  three  oral 
monthly doses (50 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg) of ibandronate. This was the first ibandronate study with monthly 
treatment regimens. Safety data are also included from two bioequivalence studies in 148 postmenopausal 
women  (study  SB 743830/002  conducted  to  demonstrate  bioequivalence  between  a  single  150 mg  tablet 
and  three  50 mg  ibandronate  tablets  and  study  SB 743830/003  conducted  to  demonstrate  bioequivalence 
between  a  single  100 mg  tablet  and  two  50 mg  ibandronate  tablets)  as  well  as  a  food  effect  study  in  24 
healthy  male  volunteers  (BP  16469).  Data  from  these  studies  have  not  been  pooled  since  the  studies 
differed in terms of patient population, study objectives, study design (including the nature of the control), 
18
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
extent  of  exposure,  and  the  nature  and  schedule  of  the  various  assessments  for  efficacy,  safety, 
pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics.  
Among  the  individual  body  systems,  there  was  no  major  difference  in  the  overall  incidence  of  adverse 
events across the treatment groups after two years of treatment. The most commonly affected body systems 
were infections and infestations (36.5% in the 2.5 mg daily group compared with 36.9% in the 100 mg and 
33.8% in the 150 mg monthly groups), musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (28.1% in the 2.5 
mg  daily  group  compared  with  32.1%  in  the  100  mg  and  34.8%  in  the  150  mg  monthly  groups),  and 
gastrointestinal disorders (32.2% in the 2.5 mg daily group compared with 32.8% in the 100 mg and 32.3% 
in the 150 mg monthly groups).  
The slightly higher incidence of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders in the monthly treatment 
groups was due to a variety of adverse events that each occurred in only one to two patients, but primarily 
to a higher incidence of pain in extremity (heterogeneous locations) in the 100 mg (3.3%) and in the 150 
mg monthly groups (5.6%) compared to daily treatment group (2.0%). 
Relationship of Adverse Events to Treatment 
The overall incidence of adverse events assessed as remotely, possibly or probably related to trial treatment 
was comparable across the treatment groups, being reported by 36.1% in the 100 mg and 36.9% in the 150 
mg monthly groups, compared with 32.4% in the 2.5 mg daily group.  
The most frequently reported adverse events considered remotely, possibly or probably related to treatment 
were those of the gastrointestinal system (20.8% for 2.5 mg, 24.2% for 100 mg and 22.2% for 150 mg) and 
the musculoskeletal system (6.8% for 2.5 mg, 6.6% for 100 mg and 9.3% for 150 mg). 
Intensity of Adverse Events 
The majority of adverse events in each treatment group were mild or moderate in intensity. Severe or life-
7threatening adverse events were reported with a similar incidence in the 2.5 mg daily [70 (23.2%) and 2 
patients respectively, of the 302 patients who reported an adverse event], in the 100 mg [50 (16.0%) and 4 
patients respectively, of the 313 patients who reported an adverse event] and in the 150 mg [54 (17.0%) and 
3 patients respectively, of the 317 patients who reported an adverse event], monthly groups. 
The  body  systems  most  commonly  affected  by  severe  adverse  events,  were  infections  and  infestations, 
musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, and gastrointestinal disorders, and the overall rates were 
generally similar in all groups. 
Serious Adverse Events 
Regarding the Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) over the two years of the study it was shown that there is no 
significant  imbalance  in  the  SAE  data  for  150  mg  monthly  Ibandronate  compared  with  the  currently 
approved 2.5 mg daily Ibandronate, with a higher incidence of SAEs in the 100 mg monthly group, with no 
evidence of causal relationship.  
Adverse Events Leading to Withdrawal from Trial Treatment 
The incidence of adverse events leading to premature withdrawal from trial treatment over the two years of 
the study was similar across all treatment groups (10.4% in 2.5 mg daily group, 11.1%, and 9.3% in 100 
mg  and  150  mg  monthly  treatment  groups,  respectively).  In  each  treatment  group,  this  was  only  slightly 
higher than that reported during the first year of the study (8.9% in the daily group, 9.1% and 7.8% in the 
100  mg  and  150  mg  monthly  groups,  respectively),  and  the  incidence  of  adverse  events  leading  to 
withdrawals during the second year of treatment was well-balanced among all groups (1.5 % in the 2.5 mg 
daily group, 2.0% and 1.5% in the 100 mg and 150 mg monthly treatment groups, respectively. 
Compared  to  the  data  reported  after  one  year  of  treatment,  there  was  no  evidence  that  the  incidence  of 
withdrawals during the second year of treatment increased  appreciably in any of  the  body systems, or in 
one treatment group compared to another. From six months onwards, the rate of discontinuation due to an 
19
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
adverse  event  was  similar  in  all  treatment  groups,  with  only  a  different  rate  for  all  monthly  groups 
occurring during the first three months. The withdrawal rate in the 150 mg monthly group remained lower 
than that in the 100 mg monthly group. 
Events of special interest 
Upper Gastrointestinal Adverse Events 
The overall incidence of upper gastrointestinal adverse events over the two years of the study was similar 
in the 2.5 mg daily treatment group (22.8%), and 150 mg (22.5%) monthly groups, and slightly higher in 
the  100  mg  monthly  group  (25.8%).  The  two-year  data  confirm  the  similar  upper  gastro-intestinal 
tolerability of the 150 mg monthly dose, compared to the 100 mg monthly and 2.5 mg daily, as reported in 
the one-year study report. 
Flu – Like Symptoms 
Special  attention  was  paid  to  adverse  events  occurring  within  three  days  of  each  monthly  treatment  that 
might be indicative of a Flu-like reaction. Similar to what had been reported after one year of treatment, the 
overall incidence of patients with Flu-like events (as pre-defined) remained higher over the two years of the 
study, in the monthly groups, than in the 2.5 mg daily group. This difference was due primarily to a higher 
rate  of  adverse  events  classified  as  general  disorders  (mainly  ‘influenza  like  illness’  and  ‘acute  phase 
reaction’), and musculoskeletal disorders (primarily myalgia). 
Regardless of the dose, most of the Flu-like symptoms occurred following the first dose, and the majority 
of  events  (excluding  nausea)  which  occurred  during  the  first  three  months  of  treatment,  did  not  reoccur 
after the second and third doses.  
Clinical Fractures 
Over  the  two  years  of  the  study,  112/1583  (7.1%)  patients  experienced  a  clinical  fracture  defined  as  a 
symptomatic  radiologically  confirmed  fracture,  including  all  vertebral  and  non-vertebral  fractures.  This 
incidence is similar to the one reported by Rizzoli and colleagues (2002)2, with alendronate 70 mg once-
weekly (7.3%). 
Over the two years of the study, the overall incidence of all non vertebral fractures was similar in the 150 
mg (5.3%) and 100 mg (5.1%) monthly groups, compared with the 2.5 mg daily group (5.1%), lower than 
reported with risedronate 35 mg once weekly (8.5%). 
Renal Safety 
There is no evidence that the higher total systemic dose delivered by the 150 mg monthly dose adversely 
affects  renal  function  relative  to  the  2.5  mg  daily  dose.  After  two  years  of  treatment  with  150  mg  once 
monthly,  no  differences  have  been  seen  in  the  incidence  of  defined  increases  in  serum  creatinine  or  in 
changes to estimated creatinine clearance between the 2.5 mg daily, 100 mg and 150 mg monthly groups. 
This is consistent with the high margin of safety derived by comparison to the no adverse effect dose level 
in chronic toxicity testing in two animal species.  
Osteonecrosis of the Jaw 
The  mechanism  underlying  osteonecrosis  of  the  jaw  (ONJ)  is  currently  not  known.  Likewise  it  is  not 
known if it is due to intrinsic properties of the molecule, the absolute dose, the cumulative dose or whether 
the underlying condition (most cases have been associated with cancer) represents the largest risk.

Over  the  two  years  of  the  study  there  were  six  deaths.  Four  deaths  occurred  during  the  first  year  of 
treatment  (myocardial  infarction  [one  patient  in  the  2.5  mg  daily  group],  cardiopulmonary  failure,  and 
cerebrovascular  accident  [one  patient  each  in  the  100  mg  monthly  group],  and  haemorrhagic  cerebral 
infarction [one patient in the 150 mg monthly group]), and two deaths occurred during the second year of 
treatment  (acute  respiratory  failure  [one  patient  in  the  2.5  mg  daily  group],  and  cerebrovascular  accident 
(one  patient  in  the  50/50  mg  monthly  group).  All  deaths  are  considered  as  unrelated  to  treatment,  and  a 
predisposing  history  or  confounding  factors  were  present  in  all  patients.  The  two-year  data  confirm  the 
safety profile observed after one year, with regards to relationship, intensity and deaths. 
Discussion 
The major part of safety data arises from the pivotal study BM 16549. In this study the nature and overall 
incidence  of  AEs  was  comparable  between  treatment  groups.  However,  there  was  a  higher  incidence  of 
musculoskeletal  and  connective  tissue  disorders  in  the  50/50 mg  and  150 mg  monthly  treatment  groups 
compared  to  the  daily  treatment  group.  In  accordance  with  that  the  most  frequent  individual  AEs  were 
arthralgia,  back  pain,  pain  in  extremity,  localized  osteoarthritis,  myalgia,  and  bone  pain  and  the  rate  of 
musculoskeletal  AEs was  considerably higher in the 50/50 mg and 150 mg groups compared to the daily 
group.  
Furthermore,  in  terms  of  AEs  considered  1)  remotely,  possibly  or  probably  or  2)  possibly  or  probably 
related  to  treatment  there  was  a  higher  incidence  of  musculoskeletal  events  in  the  150 mg  group  in  the 
monthly treatment groups as compared to the daily treatment group. Although, these differences might be 
due to a higher frequency of pre-existing osteoarthritis and localized osteoarthritis in the 150 mg monthly 
group,  further  analyses  addressing  this  topic  are  needed.  Additionally,  Flu-like  symptoms,  which  were 
transient  and  mainly  attributable  to  a  higher  rate  of  influenza-like  illness  were  higher  in  the  monthly 
treatment groups than in the 2.5 mg daily treatment group. These events were most frequent in the 150 mg 
monthly  group  and  were  not  serious  in  nature  or  severe  in  intensity.  This  potential  difference  between  a 
daily dosing and the monthly treatment regimes has been appropriately reflected in the SPC. The overall 
incidence  of  SAEs  was  higher  in  the  monthly  treatment  groups  (6.8%-7.8%)  compared  with  the  2.5 mg 
daily  treatment  group  (4.8%).  There  was  no  significant  imbalance  in  the  SAE  data  for  150  mg  monthly 
ibandronate group compared with the currently approved 2.5 mg daily ibandronate. The two groups where a 
total  of  100  mg  ibandronate  was  administered  monthly,  show  a  higher  incidence  of  SAEs. The  increased 
incidence is due in part to significant imbalances in SAE reporting in three body systems, a review of which 
has found no evidence of a causal relationship. The remainder of the imbalance is due to small differences 
occurring in several body systems, which it is not considered to represent a safety trend. This explanation 
provided  seems  to  justify  that  there  actually  is  no  causal  relationship  between  these  events  and  the 
treatment.  For  the  most  commonly  represented  body  systems  (GI  and  cardiac  disorders,  infections  and 
infestations),  the  incidence  of  SAEs  was  similar  across  all  treatment  groups.  There  were  no  differences 
between daily and monthly dosing with regard to deaths, serious or severe/life-threatening AEs, premature 
withdrawals or laboratory abnormalities. There were no differences between treatment groups regarding GI 
AEs, renal function abnormalities or decreases in calcium levels. The frequency and nature of AEs were in 
general  comparable  to  incidences  reported  in  previous  ibandronate  trials.  No  safety  advantage  was  seen 
with  the  50/50  mg  dose,  which  was  administered  over  two  days  compared  with  100  mg  or  150  mg 
administered on a single day.  
In  conclusion  the  two  years  safety  data  provide  evidence  that  the  use  of  150  mg  once-monthly  dose  is 
associated  with  a  generally  acceptable  safety  profile.  Especially  no  indications  of  nephrotoxicity  or 
development of aseptic osteonecrosis appear after 2 years of treatment.

The  quality  of  the  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the  conditions 
defined in the SPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of 
the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. There are no unresolved quality 
issues, which have a negative impact on the Benefit Risk balance of the product. 
Non-clinical  
Administration  of  ibandronate  150  mg  as  a  once  monthly  dose  is  a  promising  new  therapeutic 
approach  for  treatment  of  postmenopausal  osteoporosis  minimizing  the  patient  inconvenience 
associated  with  daily  administration  of  bisphosphonates.  The  new  non-clinical  studies  undertaken  to 
support the 150 mg dose once a month have focused on the toxicology of the dose and more specifically on 
the  nephrotoxicity  and  the  severity  of  the  renal  lesions.  During  these  studies  these  safety  margins  are 
comparable  to  those  observed  with  other  bisphosphonates  and/or  dosing  regimens  and  suggest  that  the 
proposed dosing regimen of 150 mg ibandronic acid p.o. once a month is unlikely to be associated with any 
significant risk of kidney toxicity. 
Clinical  
The CHMP concluded that the benefit/risk of Ibandronate 150 mg monthly dose is considered as positive in 
the  claimed  indication.  Selection  of  the  150  mg  dose  as  compared  to  lower  doses  for  once  monthly 
administration  does  not  lead  to  any  clinically  important  adverse  effects  although  this  dose  results  in  a 
considerable  increase  in  cumulative  systemic exposure as  compared to once  daily dosing of 2.5 mg.  The 
results from the submitted pivotal phase-III study demonstrate that oral ibandronate, at a dose of 150 mg 
once  monthly,  is  non-inferior  to  the  approved  2.5  mg  daily  regimen.  Subsequent  post-hoc  analyses 
revealed that treatment with 150 mg monthly doses of ibandronate was superior to monthly doses of 100 
mg  ibandronate. In terms of safety no new major safety aspects occurred from the present dataset. It 
appears that the small difference between the 150 mg/month and 100 mg/month group in patients having 
possible/probably related AEs and the fact that the serious AEs and withdrawals due to AEs were similar, 
justifies the clinical use of the 150 mg/month tablet. However, long-term data are needed to fully assess 
the  safety  of  the  proposed  dosing  regimen.  The  once  monthly  administered  dosing  has  not  previously 
been  investigated  and  clinical  effects  of  non-compliance  could  be  questioned.  However,  the  MAH  has 
provided  a  thorough  simulation  of  the  effects  of  non-compliance  at  different  time-points  on  biochemical 
markers of bone turnover clearly demonstrating limited effects with possible minor clinical consequences. 
Furthermore,  the  Flu-like  events  also  associated  with  the  150  mg  dose  appear  to  be  transient,  non-
serious, mostly not treatment-limiting, and manageable, 
Until assuring long-term safety data are available these safety issues need to be continuously reflected 
in the SPC. 
In conclusion, the two years safety data provide evidence that the use of a 150 mg once-monthly dose is 
associated with a generally acceptable safety profile. Especially, there are no indications of nephrotoxicity 
or any development of aseptic osteonecrosis after 2 years of treatment. 
Benefit/risk assessment 
Based on these results the risk/benefit-ratio for use of ibandronate 150 mg once monthly in the treatment of 
postmenopausal osteoporosis is considered to be positive. The proposed indication:  
“Treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women, in order to reduce the risk of vertebral fractures. 
Efficacy on femoral neck fractures has not been established.”  
is in accordance with data provided and therefore acceptable.

Update of section 5.3 of the SmPC based on final 
1 Notifications are issued for type I variations and Article 61(3) notifications (unless part of a group including a type II variation or extension application or a worksharing application). Opinions 
are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

homocysteine increase' as a new ADR with the 
frequency ‘common’ and SmPC section 4.4 to add a 
related warning. The Package Leaflet is being 
updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to update the contact details of the local 
representatives for Malta and Cyprus in the Package 
Leaflet. 
An updated RMP version 1.4 was agreed during the 
procedure: consequences of blood homocysteine 
increase is being added as a new important potential 
risk, the clinical and post-marketing exposure is 
being updated and the due dates for ALN-AS1-002 
and ALN-AS1-003 final study reports are being 
revised. 
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data 
with acute hepatic porphyria (AHP), vitamin deficiencies, or 
chronic kidney disease.  During treatment with givosiran, 
increases in blood homocysteine levels have been observed 
compared to levels before treatment. The clinical relevance 
of the elevations in blood homocysteine during treatment 
with givosiran is unknown. However, homocysteine 
elevations have been previously associated with an 
increased risk of thromboembolic events. Measurement of 
blood homocysteine levels prior to initiating treatment and 
monitoring for changes during treatment with givosiran is 
recommended. In patients with elevated homocysteine 
levels homocysteine-lowering therapy can be considered.

Product Characteristics.

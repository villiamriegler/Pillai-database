Withdrawal of Marketing Authorisation Application for: 
Tibsovo 250 mg Film-coated Tablets (Ivosidenib, INN) 
EMA Product Number: EMEA/H/C/005056 
Dear Dr Enzmann 
We write to inform you that, at this point in time, Agios Netherlands B.V. (Agios) has taken 
the decision to withdraw the Conditional Marketing Authorisation Application for Tibsovo 
250 mg Film-coated Tablets (ivosidenib, INN) which was intended to be used for the 
treatment of relapsed or refractory acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) with an isocitrate 
dehydrogenase-1 (IDH1) R132 mutation in adult patients who have received at least 2 prior 
regimens, including at least 1 standard intensive chemotherapy regimen, or who are not 
candidates for standard intensive chemotherapy and have received at least 1 prior non-
intensive regimen. 
This withdrawal is based on feedback from the CHMP that the available clinical data from a 
single arm, Phase 1 study do not allow the Committee to conclude on a positive benefit-risk 
balance for the proposed indication. 
The withdrawal of this application has no impact on ongoing clinical trials with ivosidenib.   
We reserve the right to make further submissions at a future date in this or other therapeutic 
indications. 
Agios would like to take this opportunity to thank the CHMP and PRAC (Co-)Rapporteurs, 
CHMP and PRAC Members, and the EMA for the time and effort dedicated to their review of 
this application, and the guidance provided during the procedure. 
We agree for this letter to be published on the European Medicines Agency website. 
Yours sincerely,

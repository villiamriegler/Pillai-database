2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This centralised application refers to a generic application according to Article 10(1) of Directive 2001/83/EC, 
as amended, for the product Plerixafor Accord 20 mg/ml solution for injection, developed by Accord S.L.U.  
The reference medicinal product is Mozobil 20 mg/ml solution for injection, marked by Genzyme Europe B.V., 
The Netherlands, which was first approved in the Union on 31 July 2009 (Union MA No: EU/1/09/537). 
Assessment report  
EMA/889120/2022 
Page 9/22 
 
 
 
 
 
The active substance of this product is plerixafor.  
As  both  medicinal  products,  the  reference  and  the  generic,  are  aqueous  solutions  for  injection  to  be 
administered subcutaneously and the generic contains the same active substance in the same concentration 
and  the  same  excipients  in  identical  amounts  as  the  reference  product,  according  to  the  provisions  of  the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1) no bioequivalence studies 
have been submitted. Therefore, for the current generic application the essential similarity with the reference 
medicinal product is only based on pharmaceutical equivalence. 
The reference product Mozobil is indicated for  
Adult patients 
Mozobil is indicated in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance mobilisation 
of haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation 
in adult patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma whose cells mobilise poorly. 
Paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years) 
Mozobil  is  indicated  in  combination  with  G-CSF  to  enhance  mobilisation  of  haematopoietic  stem  cells  to  the 
peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in children with lymphoma or solid 
malignant tumours, either: 
- pre-emptively, when circulating stem cell count on the predicted day of collection after adequate mobilization 
with G-CSF (with or without chemotherapy) is expected to be insufficient with regards to desired hematopoietic 
stem cells yield, or 
- who previously failed to collect sufficient haematopoietic stem cells. 
The applicant has applied for all the indications of the reference product. The proposed posology and method 
of administration are identical to the reference product.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction  
The finished product is presented as solution for injection containing 20 mg/ml of plerixafor as active substance.  
Other  ingredients  are:  sodium  chloride,  concentrated  hydrochloric  acid  and  sodium  hydroxide  (for  pH 
adjustment) and water for injections.  
The product is available in a 2-mL type I clear glass vial with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium flip-
off  seal  with  polypropylene  (PP)  plastic  blue  mate  top,  as  described  in  section  6.5  of  the  SmPC.  Each  vial 
contains 1.2 mL of solution.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
The chemical name of plerixafor is 1,1′-[1,4-Phenylenebis(methylene)]bis[1,4,8,11-tetraazacyclotetradecane] 
corresponding to the molecular formula C28H54N8. It has a relative molecular mass of 502.78 g/mol and the 
following structure: 
Figure 1: active substance structure 
The chemical structure of plerixafor was elucidated by a combination of UV spectroscopy, elemental analysis, 
IR  spectroscopy,  mass  spectroscopy,  carbon  nuclear  magnetic  resonance  spectroscopy,  proton  nuclear 
magnetic resonance spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and differential scanning colorimetry, and relevant 
spectra were provided.  
The  active  substance  is  a  white  to  off-white  crystalline,  hygroscopic  solid,  soluble  in  dichloromethane  and 
slightly soluble in water. Plerixafor is an achiral molecule and hence does not exhibit isomerism.  
Polymorphism has not been observed for plerixafor. The solid state properties of the active substance were 
measured by XRD. XRD diffractograms demonstrated that the manufacturing process consistently produces the 
same pattern. 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing of the active substance has been provided in the restricted part of 
the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. 
Plerixafor is synthesised by a single manufacturer in three main steps using commercially available well-defined 
starting materials with acceptable specifications. 
Adequate  in-process  controls  are  applied  during  the  synthesis.  The  specifications  and  control  methods  for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The  characterisation  of  the  active  substance  and  its  impurities  are  in  accordance  with  the  EU  guideline  on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged with nitrogen purging in a bag, which complies with Commission Regulation 
(EU) No. 10/2011 as amended.  
2.2.2.3.  Specification(s) 
The  active  substance  specification  includes  tests  for:  appearance  (visual),  solubility  (visual),  identity  (IR, 
HPLC), water content (KF), colour and clarity of solution (UV), residue on ignition (in-house), assay (HPLC), 
Assessment report  
EMA/889120/2022 
Page 11/22 
 
 
 
 
related  substances  (HPLC),  residual  solvents  (GC),  microbial  limit  tests,  tests  for  pathogens,  and  bacterial 
endotoxin test (in house). 
Related substances are controlled according to ICH Q3A, and specifications were tightened during the CHMP 
review as requested.  
Residual solvents are controlled to ICHQ3C levels, and specifications were tightened as requested by the CHMP.  
The  absence  of  benzene,  elemental  impurities  and  genotoxic  impurities  was  demonstrated..  Based  on  the 
results, routine monitoring is not deemed necessary. 
The  analytical  methods  used  have  been  adequately  described  and  (non-compendial  methods)  appropriately 
validated  in  accordance  with  the  ICH  guidelines.  Satisfactory  information  regarding  the  reference  standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data of commercial size batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch.  
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in  the  intended  commercial  packaging  stored under  long  term  conditions  (25ºC  /  60%  RH)  and  accelerated 
conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Photostability testing following the 
ICH  Q1B  guideline  was  performed.  Results  on  stress  conditions  (thermal  stress,  humidity,  UV)  were  also 
provided. 
The samples were tested for all stability indicating parameters included in the specification.  
The analytical methods used were the same as for release and were stability indicating. 
All tested parameters were within the specifications. No photodegradation was observed. 
As per the post-approval stability commitment, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative 
trend, should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable.  The  stability  results  justify  the  proposed  retest  period  with  storage  condition  as  proposed  by  the 
applicant. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  solution  for  injection  containing  20  mg/mL  of  plerixafor  as  active 
substance.  
The finished product was developed to be a generic equivalent to the reference medicinal product Mozobil 20 
mg/mL solution for injection. 
Assessment report  
EMA/889120/2022 
Page 12/22 
 
 
 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur standards. 
There  are  no  novel  excipients  used  in  the  finished  product  formulation.  The  list  of  excipients  is  included  in 
section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
A  biowaiver  was  granted  since  the  proposed  generic  medicinal  product  has  an  identical  qualitative  and 
quantitative composition compared to the approved reference medicinal product, Mozobil 20 mg/mL solution 
for  injection,  and  the  same  pharmaceutical  form  and  route  of  administration  as  a  solution  for  injection  for 
subcutaneous use. The essential similarity with the reference medicinal product is only based on pharmaceutical 
equivalence. 
An initial risk assessment of the overall manufacturing process parameters was performed to identify the high-
risk steps that may affect the CQAs of the finished product (description, pH, assay, related substances). Based 
on the outcome of the risk assessment development studies were performed. 
Based on the results of the development studies and exhibit batch data, the risk assessment of the process 
parameters  was  updated  to  be  low  for  all  parameters.  The  process  is  considered  well  controlled,  having  no 
process parameters with high risk. 
The product is sterile.  
The primary packaging is a 2 mL type I clear glass vial with a chlorobutyl rubber stopper and aluminium flip-
off seal with PP plastic blue mate top. The glass vials comply with Ph. Eur. type I glass. The rubber stoppers 
comply with Ph. Eur. monograph 3.2.9 for “rubber closures”. The choice of the container closure system has 
been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.  
2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
Major  steps  of  the  manufacturing  process  have  been  validated.  It  has  been  demonstrated  that  the 
manufacturing  process  is  capable  of  producing  the  finished  product  of  intended  quality  in  a  reproducible 
manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing process for a sterile solution in a 
vial. 
During the procedure, one quality major objection (MO) was raised, related to inadequate GMP evidence of one 
of  the  proposed  packaging  sites. In  response the applicant  removed the  concerned  packaging  site  from  the 
dossier. 
2.2.3.3.  Product specification(s)  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: appearance 
(visual), identity (UV, HPLC), pH, colour and clarity of solution (Ph. Eur.), bacterial endotoxins test (Ph. Eur.), 
extractable volume (Ph. Eur.), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), related substances (HPLC), sterility 
(Ph. Eur.), osmolality (Ph. Eur.), and Uniformity of Dosage Units (Ph. Eur.) 
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed following a risk-based 
approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk assessment it can be 
concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental impurity controls. The information on the control of 
elemental impurities is satisfactory.  
Assessment report  
EMA/889120/2022 
Page 13/22 
 
 
 
A risk assessment concerning the potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in the finished product has been 
performed (as requested by CHMP) considering all suspected and actual root causes in line with the “Questions 
and  answers  for  marketing  authorisation  holders/applicants  on  the  CHMP  Opinion  for  the  Article  5(3)  of 
Regulation  (EC)  No  726/2004  referral  on  nitrosamine 
impurities 
in  human  medicinal  products” 
(EMA/409815/2020)  and  the  “Assessment  report-  Procedure  under  Article  5(3)  of  Regulation  EC  (No) 
726/2004-  Nitrosamine  impurities  in  human  medicinal  products”  (EMA/369136/2020).  Based  on  the 
information provided, it is accepted that there is no risk of nitrosamine impurities in the active substance or 
the related finished product. Therefore, no specific control measures are deemed necessary.  
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch  analysis  results  are  provided  for  three  commercial  scale  batches  confirming  the  consistency  of  the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
Stability data from three commercial scale batches of finished product stored under long term conditions (25ºC 
/ 60% RH) and under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. 
The batches of finished product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing.  
Samples were tested for all stability indicating parameters included in the specification/analytical procedures 
used are stability indicating. Under long term conditions (25ºC / 60% RH) no significant changes have been 
observed. Under accelerated conditions (40ºC / 75% RH) an increase in degradation products is observed but 
all results were within the specification limits.  
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines1, any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, 
should be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA. 
Since the active substance was observed to be photostable, no photostability testing was performed on the 
finished product. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 21 months without any special storage conditions 
as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) are acceptable. 
2.2.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Plerixafor Accord has been developed as a generic of Mozobil 20 mg/mL solution for injection.

Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. During the procedure, one quality MO was raised, related to inadequate 
GMP  evidence  of  one  of  the  proposed  packaging  sites.  In  response  the  applicant  removed  the  concerned 
packaging site from the dossier.  
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, 
and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance 
in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the CHMP 
recommends the following points for investigation: none. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A  non-clinical  overview  on  the  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  has  been  provided,  which  is 
based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional  non-clinical  pharmacology,  pharmacokinetics  and  toxicology  data.  The  non-clinical  aspects  of  the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No  environmental  risk  assessment  studies  (ERA)  were  submitted.  This  was  justified  by  the  applicant  as  the 
introduction of Plerixafor Accord manufactured by Accord Healthcare S.L.U. is considered unlikely to result in 
any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all plerixafor containing products and the exposure 
of the environment to the active substance, so the ERA is expected to be similar. The applicant was asked to 
provide suitable information to substantiate the claim that an increase in environmental exposure of the active 
substance is not to be expected. In response to the request the applicant submitted a conservative calculation 
of the Predicted Environmental Concentration that resulted in a lower value than the action limit of 0.01 μg/l.

Calculation of the Predicted Environmental Concentration 
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant has not performed non-clinical studies. Non-clinical data are submitted from published literature 
data.  This  is  reasonable  and  acceptable  since  plerixafor  is  a  well-known  active  substance.  Grounds  for  not 
providing new non-clinical data are adequately justified. 
A brief discussion of the active substance and product impurities specification limits has been included in the 
non-clinical overview, with the conclusion that as all the impurities are within the acceptable limits, no further 
toxicological assessment was deemed necessary. Review of Module 3 data also shows that the limits applied to 
the elemental impurities, related substances and ICH classified solvents are in line with the relevant guidelines.  
All excipients are compendial and there are no toxicological concerns raised with regard to the excipients.  
The SmPC sections 4.6 and 5.3 are in line with those for the innovator Mozobil 20 mg/ml solution for injection, 
Genzyme Europe B.V., The Netherlands and are therefore acceptable. 
The calculation of the PEC resulted in a lower value than the action limit of 0.01 μg/l, therefore it is agreed that 
a Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis is not deemed necessary. No additional environmental impact 
as compared to that of the originator’s is anticipated related to this generic application for Plerixafor solution 
for injection 20 mg/mL. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections regarding the marketing approval of Plerixafor Accord, Solution for injection 20 mg/ml 
from a non-clinical point of view. The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the absence of

non-clinical  studies  based  on  the  literature  review  and  the  claim  that  Plerixafor  Accord  is  a  generic  of  the 
reference product Mozobil. The literature data presented in the dossier is considered acceptable and sufficient 
for the assessment of non-clinical aspects of Plerixafor Accord in the applied indications. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy  and  safety  of  plerixafor  based  on  published  literature.  The  SmPC  is  in  line  with  the  SmPC  of  the 
reference product. 
No CHMP scientific advice pertinent to the clinical development was given for this medicinal product.  
For the clinical assessment the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98) in 
its current version, is of particular relevance. 
Exemption  
This is a generic centralised application for a medicinal product supplied as a solution for injection in glass vials 
for single use.  
According to the Appendix II of the Guideline on the investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 
Rev. 1): “In the case of other parenteral routes, e.g. intramuscular or subcutaneous, and when the test product 
is of the same type of solution (aqueous or oily), contains the same concentration of the same active substance 
and the same excipients in similar amounts as the medicinal product currently approved, bioequivalence studies 
are not required”. 
No bioequivalence study was conducted and none is required since the applied product is to be administered 
as an aqueous solution for injection for subcutaneous administration containing the same active substance in 
the same concentrations as the currently authorised originator product. In addition, Plerixafor Accord contains 
the same excipients in identical amounts as the reference product and the excipients are not known to interact 
with the drug substance nor to otherwise affect the disposition of the drug substance. 
Therefore, for the current generic application, the essential similarity with the reference medicinal product is 
only based on pharmaceutical equivalence, which is accepted by the CHMP. 
2.4.2.  Clinical pharmacology 
2.4.2.1.  Pharmacokinetics 
The generic medicinal product has an identical qualitative and quantitative composition in active substance and 
excipients compared to the approved reference medicinal product and the same pharmaceutical form and route 
of  administration.  Therefore,  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the 
investigation  of  Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1) bioequivalence studies are not required in this case.

2.4.4.1.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
No  bioequivalence  study  has  been  submitted  and  none  are  required  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the 
investigation  of  bioequivalence  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.  1  Appendix  II).  A  biowaiver  has  been 
requested, which is acceptable from a pharmacokinetic point of view. The essential similarity with the reference 
medicinal product is only based on pharmaceutical equivalence. 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
A clinical overview based on published clinical data was submitted where clinical pharmacology, efficacy and 
safety  of  plerixafor  were  discussed.  Pharmacodynamic  and  pharmacokinetic  profiles,  efficacy  and  safety  of 
plerixafor are well known and adequately characterised. 
According  to  the  Directive  2001/83/EC,  no  further  obligations  are  required  for  this  generic  application  and 
Plerixafor Accord is considered essentially similar to Mozobil. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
There are no objections regarding the marketing approval of Plerixafor Accord, Solution for injection 20 mg/ml 
from a clinical point of view. A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Plerixafor Accord and 
justifications  that  the  active  substance  does  not  differ  significantly  in  properties  with  regards  to  safety  and 
efficacy of the reference product Mozobil was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance 
with the relevant guideline and additional clinical studies were not considered necessary.

3.  Benefit-risk balance  
This application concerns a generic version of plerixafor, solution for injection. The reference product Mozobil 
is indicated for  
Adult patients 
Mozobil is indicated in combination with granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) to enhance mobilisation 
of haematopoietic stem cells to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation 
in adult patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma whose cells mobilise poorly. 
Paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years) 
Mozobil  is  indicated  in  combination  with  G-CSF  to  enhance  mobilisation  of  haematopoietic  stem  cells  to  the 
peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in children with lymphoma or solid 
malignant tumours, either: 
- pre-emptively, when circulating stem cell count on the predicted day of collection after adequate mobilization 
with G-CSF (with or without chemotherapy) is expected to be insufficient with regards to desired hematopoietic 
stem cells yield, or 
- who previously failed to collect sufficient haematopoietic stem cells. 
No  nonclinical  studies  have  been  provided  for  this  application  but  an  adequate  summary  of  the  available 
nonclinical  information  for  the  active  substance  was  presented  and  considered  sufficient.  From  a  clinical 
perspective,  this  application  does  not  contain  new data  on  the  pharmacokinetics  and pharmacodynamics  as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical aspects 
based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
No  bioequivalence  studies  have  been  submitted  and  none  are  required  according  to  the  Guideline  on  the 
investigation of bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1 Appendix II) since Plerixafor Accord is to be 
administered as an aqueous solution for injection for subcutaneous use containing the same active substance 
in  the  same  concentrations  as  the  currently  authorised  originator  product.  In  addition,  Plerixafor  Accord 
contains the same excipients in identical amounts as the reference product and the excipients are not known 
to interact with the drug substance nor to otherwise affect the disposition of the drug substance. A biowaiver 
has been requested and is acceptable from a pharmacokinetic point of view.  
Therefore, for the current generic application, the essential similarity with the reference medicinal product is 
only based on pharmaceutical equivalence, which is considered adequate. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The  CHMP,  having  considered  the  data  submitted  in  the  application  and  available  on  the  chosen  reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those

included in the product information. 
4.  Recommendations 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Plerixafor Accord is not similar to Adcetris, Gazyvaro, Kymriah, 
Ledaga, Minjuvi, Polivy, Poteligeo, Tecartus, Yescarta, Blenrep, Darzalex, Farydak, Imnovid, Kyprolis, Ninlaro, 
Trecondi  and  Abecma  within  the  meaning  of  Article  3  of  Commission  Regulation  (EC)  No.  847/2000.  See 
appendix. 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Plerixafor Accord is favourable in the following indication: 
Adult patients 
Plerixafor  Accord  is  indicated  in  combination  with  granulocyte-colony  stimulating  factor  (G-CSF)  to  enhance 
mobilisation  of  haematopoietic  stem  cells  to  the  peripheral  blood  for  collection  and  subsequent  autologous 
transplantation in adult patients with lymphoma or multiple myeloma whose cells mobilise poorly. 
Paediatric patients (1 to less than 18 years) 
Plerixafor Accord is indicated in combination with G-CSF to enhance mobilisation of haematopoietic stem cells 
to the peripheral blood for collection and subsequent autologous transplantation in children with lymphoma or 
solid malignant tumours, either: 
- 
pre-emptively,  when  circulating  stem  cell  count  on  the  predicted  day  of  collection  after  adequate 
mobilization with G-CSF (with or without chemotherapy) is expected to be insufficient with regards to 
desired hematopoietic stem cells yield, or 
-  who previously failed to collect sufficient haematopoietic stem cells. 
The  CHMP  therefore  recommends  the  granting  of  the  marketing  authorisation,  subject  to  the  following 
conditions:

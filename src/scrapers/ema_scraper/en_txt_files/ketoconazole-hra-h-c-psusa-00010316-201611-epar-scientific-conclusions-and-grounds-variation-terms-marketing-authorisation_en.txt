Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for ketoconazole (centrally 
authorised product only), the scientific conclusions of CHMP are as follows:  
Ketoconazole  is  a  potent  inhibitor  of  CYP3A4  enzyme  and  P-gp  transporter.  Pharmacokinetics  of 
medicines  that  are  substrates  of  CYP3A4  and  P-gp  can  be  affected  when  administered  concomitantly 
with  ketoconazole,  potentially  leading  to  serious  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs)  and/or  need  for  dose 
adjustment  of  these  medicinal  products.  The  PRAC  considers  that,  in  view  of  the  available  data  the 
interaction  of  ketoconazole  with  edoxaban  and  isavuconaziole  should  be  added  to  the  product 
information.  
Therefore, in view of the data presented in the reviewed PSUR, the PRAC considered that changes to the 
product information of medicinal products containing ketoconazole were warranted. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for ketoconazole (centrally authorised product only) the CHMP 
is of the opinion that the benefit-risk balance of the medicinal product(s) containing ketoconazole 
(centrally authorised product only) is unchanged subject to the proposed changes to the product 
information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

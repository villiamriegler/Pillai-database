2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Pregabalin Mylan is a generic medicinal product of Lyrica, which has been authorised in the EU since 6 July 2004.  
The active substance of Pregabalin Mylan is pregabalin, an analogue of the neurotransmitter 
gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). Pregabalin decreases central neuronal excitability by binding to an auxiliary 
subunit (α2-δ protein) of a voltage-gated calcium channel on neurons in the central nervous system. Pregabalin 
reduces the release of several neurotransmitters, including glutamate, noradrenaline, and substance P. 
The safety and efficacy profile of pregabalin has been characterised in several clinical trials, details of which can 
be found in the EPAR for Lyrica. In addition, there is a long-term post-marketing experience contributing to the 
knowledge of the clinical use of this product. Since this application is a generic application referring to the 
reference medicinal product Lyrica, summary of the clinical data of pregabalin is available and no new clinical 
studies regarding pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and efficacy and safety have been conducted. 
Pregabalin Mylan hard capsules have the same qualitative and quantitative composition, in terms of active 
substance, and the same pharmaceutical form as the reference product Lyrica. Bioequivalence of the 50 mg 
dose with the reference 50 mg Lyrica capsule and 300mg dose with the reference 300mg Lyrica capsule was 
demonstrated clinically. For the remaining doses, CHMP has accepted a biowaiver.  
Pregabalin Mylan is a duplicate application of Pregabalin Mylan Pharma, due to patent reasons. The indication 
proposed for Pregabalin Mylan is a subset of the indication authorized for the Reference medicinal product Lyrica.  
The proposed pack sizes are consistent with the dosage regimen and duration of use.

2.2.2.  Active substance 
General Information 
The information on the active substance is provided according to the Active Substance Master File (ASMF) 
procedure. 
The chemical name of pregabalin is (S)-3-(aminomethyl)-5-methylhexanoic acid and it has the following 
structure and properties: 
Molecular formula: C8H17NO2   -   Relative molecular mass: 159.23gmol-1 
The structure of pregabalin was confirmed by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, mass 
spectrometry, elemental analysis and XRPD. 
Pregabalin is a white to off-white, non-hygroscopic, crystalline powder, slightly soluble in water and methanol. 
Pregabalin has a single chiral centre, created during the synthetic process. 
Polymorphism has been observed for pregabalin. The proposed commercial form is non-solvated but additional 
hydrated and solvated forms have been observed. Polymorphic form is controlled by an XRPD test in the active 
substance specification.

EMA/CHMP/90129/2015 
Page 10/29 
 
  
  
 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
A single ASMF is provided to document the manufacture of pregabalin. Three manufacturers are used to produce 
the same intermediate from well-defined starting materials in a single step. The equivalent quality of 
intermediate from all suppliers has been demonstrated. A fourth manufacturer converts the intermediate to 
pregabalin in two additional steps. Enantiopurity is controlled by the process and is tested in the active 
substance by specific optical rotation. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented and are considered adequate. 
Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their origin and characterised. 
The active substance is packaged in a closed LDPE bag inside a heat-sealed HMLDPE bag. This is stored inside a 
heat-sealed triple laminated aluminium bag, further packaged in an HDPE drum. The LDPE bags comply with the 
EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011. 
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility, identity (IR, HPLC), polymorphic 
form (XRPD), particle size (sieve retention), assay (HPLC), impurities (HPLC), residual solvents (GC), water 
content (KF), specific optical rotation (Ph. Eur.), enantiopurity (chiral HPLC), residue on ignition (Ph. Eur.) and 
heavy metals (Ph. Eur.). One starting material is a potential genotoxin and its proposed limit in the active 
substance is in line with the TTC approach. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Analysis data on three production scale batches of the active substance are provided. The results are within the 
specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored in 
the intended commercial package for up to 12 months under long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up 
to 6 months under accelerated conditions  (40 ºC / 75% RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The 
following parameters were tested: appearance, identity, polymorphic form, assay, impurities, water content and 
enantiopurity. The analytical methods used were stability indicating. There were no significant to changes to any 
of the measured parameters. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. No degradation was 
observed, indicating that pregabalin is not photosensitive. 
Forced degradation studies were also carried in aqueous solution under conditions of high and low pH, at high 
temperature, in the presence of oxidant and in the solid state at high temperature.  Pregabalin degrades on 
heating at extremes of pH and under oxidative conditions. However, no racemisation was observed under any 
condition. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period and storage conditions in the proposed container.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The aim of development was to produce immediate release capsules of pregabalin, pharmaceutically equivalent 
to Lyrica, with comparable dissolution profiles and acceptable stability. Since Lyrica is a hard capsule 
formulation, the same presentation was chosen for Pregabalin Mylan. 
Pregabalin is highly soluble over the physiological pH range and highly permeable (BCS I) and has reasonable 
flow properties. Therefore, a dry blending process was investigated, followed by filling into the hard capsules.  
Excipients were chosen based on the functionality of those in the reference product, literature information, and 
experience with similar products. The finished product composition is qualitatively and quantitatively different to 
that of Lyrica. The main difference is in the dry blend composition, where low substituted hydroxypropylcellulose 
is used in place of lactose monohydrate. There are also minor differences in the gelatin shell components with a 
resulting difference in colour. However, the impurity profiles of Pregabalin Mylan and Lyrica are similar. 
Binary mixtures of the proposed excipients with pregabalin were studied and no compatibility issues were 
identified. The levels of excipients were varied in order to optimise flow properties and dissolution profile. 
Specifications for particle size of active substance and dry blend excipients have been set in line with the 
validation batches to ensure content uniformity. All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and 
their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product 
formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of the SmPC. 
The 75-300 mg strength capsules are dose proportional and are distinguished by different sized capsule shells, 
colour, and imprints. The 25 and 50 mg capsules are proportional to each other, but contain a higher excipient 
content than the 75-300 mg strengths. They are also made distinct from each other by differences in size, colour 
and imprints. 
The dissolution method was developed using Ph. Eur. apparatus and conditions. Complete release of the product 
was demonstrated at pHs 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8. A series of qualitatively and quantitatively different formulations 
were tested and the method thus shown to be discriminatory. 
A bioequivalence study was performed with the 50 and 300 mg strengths (representing both active 
substance:excipient ratio formulations) manufactured using the proposed commercial process and formulation, 
indicating equivalent in vivo performance to Lyrica capsules of the same strengths. Further comparison of the in 
vitro performance of all tablet strengths with their Lyrica equivalents at pHs 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8 indicate similar 
dissolution profiles. The batches used in bioequivalence studies were also compared in vitro against their dose 
proportional strengths (i.e. 300 mg vs 75, 150, 200 and 225 mg; 50 vs 25 mg), as well as with capsules from 
validation batches. In line with CPMP guidance on the Investigation of Bioequivalence – 
CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98-Rev 01 – August 2010, the dissolution profiles of all these batches can be considered 
as similar. Therefore, biowaivers are granted for those strengths not tested in the bioequivalence studies. 
The primary packaging is PVC/PVDC-Al blister packs, PVC/PVDC-Al perforated unit dose blister packs, or HDPE 
bottles. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system 
has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product.

Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of three main steps: dry blending of excipients, encapsulation and 
packaging. The dry blend can be completely converted to a single strength capsule or sub-divided between 
dose-proportional strengths. The process is considered to be a standard manufacturing process. 
The dry blend is tested for identity, content uniformity, assay, and loss on drying before encapsulation. Tests are 
also in place to ensure mass uniformity, average fill weight, disintegration, and correct appearance and printing 
during the encapsulation process. Leak-testing during packing is also carried out. Studies indicate that holding 
times of 60 days for the bulk powder blend and 12 months for the filled capsules are acceptable. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process have been validated on pilot scale. It has been demonstrated that the 
manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. 
A validation protocol has been provided and a commitment received that the full scale process will be validated 
before commercialisation of the product. The in-process controls are adequate for this type of manufacturing 
process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification  
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form and comprise 
of  tests  for  appearance  (visual  inspection),  identification  (HPLC,  IR),  colour  identification  (for  iron  oxide, 
titanium dioxide and erythrosine), dissolution (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), assay (HPLC), 
impurities  (HPLC),  loss  on  drying  (Ph.  Eur.)  and  microbial  content  (Ph.  Eur.).  Microbial  testing  and  colour 
identification will be carried out on the first three production scale batches and thereafter on one in every ten 
batches with a minimum of one batch per year. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with the 
ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities testing 
has been presented. 
Batch analysis results are provided for three pilot scale batches of each strength used to validate the process 
confirming the consistency of the manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product 
specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data on three pilot scale batches of each strength of finished product, stored for up to 12 months under 
long term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches of finished product were identical to those proposed 
for marketing and were stored in the intended commercial blister packs and HDPE bottles as well as in a bulk 
shipment pack differing only in terms of dimensions to that intended to be used in routine production. 
Samples were tested for appearance, loss on drying, impurities, dissolution, assay, and microbial content. The 
analytical procedures used are stability indicating. No significant trends were observed for any of the parameters 
tested under either condition. 
In addition, one batch each of the 50 mg and 300 mg strengths were exposed to light as defined in the ICH 
Guideline on Photostability Testing of New Drug Substances and Products. The results indicate that the finished 
product is not photosensitive. 
In-use stability studies were performed in compliance with the CPMP guideline “Note for Guidance on In-use 
stability testing of human medicinal products” (CPMP/QWP/2934/99). Two batches of Pregabalin Mylan of each 
Assessment report

strength, stored in the commercial HDPE bottles, were tested in a phased study. All tested parameters were 
within the specifications, indicating the proposed 100 day in-use shelf-life is acceptable. 
Based on available stability data, the shelf-life and storage conditions as stated in the SmPC are acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
Gelatine obtained from bovine sources is used in the product. A valid TSE CEP from the suppliers of the gelatine 
used in the manufacture is provided. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of 
important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have 
a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions defined 
in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of the product 
have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented to give reassurance on 
viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development   
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects   
2.3.1.  Introduction 
A non-clinical overview based on up-to-date and adequate scientific literature on the pharmacology, 
pharmacokinetics and toxicology was provided. The overview justifies why there is no need to generate 
additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology data. The non-clinical aspects of the 
SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was 
considered acceptable.  
Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Pregabalin Mylan manufactured by Generics UK Limited is considered unlikely to result in any significant 
increase in the combined sales volumes for all pregabalin containing products and the exposure of the 
environment to the active substance. Thus, the environmental risk is expected to be similar and not increased. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/90129/2015 
Page 14/29 
 
  
  
The CHMP endorsed this view.  
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
NA 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The non-clinical overview presented by the applicant is largely based on published scientific literature which is 
acceptable since pregabalin is a well-known active substance.  
There are no objections to the approval of Pregabalin Mylan from a non-clinical point of view. The SmPC of 
Pregabalin Mylan is in line with that of the reference product Lyrica and is therefore acceptable.  
2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for hard capsules containing pregabalin. To support the marketing authorisation 
application the applicant conducted 2 bioequivalence studies with cross-over design under fasting conditions; 
Study 005-14 (with the highest strength, 300 mg), and Study 006-14 (with 50 mg).These studies were pivotal 
for the assessment. 
The biowaivers for 25 mg (from the 50 mg strength), and for 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 225 mg 
strengths (from the 300 mg strength) are acceptable. 
The applicant provided a clinical overview outlining the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as well as 
efficacy and safety of pregabalin based on published literature. The SmPC is in line with the SmPC of the 
reference product. 
No scientific advice by the CHMP was given for this medicinal product. For the clinical assessment the Guideline 
on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev.1/Corr**) is of particular relevance.   
GCP 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
Exemption  
According to the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (Doc. Ref.: CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 1/ 
Corr **), if the pharmacokinetic of the active substance is linear and that the bioequivalence is demonstrated for 
one strength, in vivo bioequivalence studies for the other strengths could be waived. An exemption from the 
requirement to perform bioequivalence studies would be justified when the following conditions are met: the 
pharmaceutical products have the same manufacturer, same qualitative composition, same ratio between active 
substance and excipients and in vitro dissolution profile comparable to the reference product. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/90129/2015 
Page 15/29 
 
  
  
The composition of the strengths 25 and 50 mg of the test product is quantitatively proportional. Further, the 
composition of the strengths 75, 100, 150, 200, 225 and 300 mg of the test product is quantitatively 
proportional. Therefore, two single-dose bioequivalence studies have been conducted with the highest strength 
of both composition groups, i.e. with 50 and 300 mg hard gelatine capsules. 
A biowaiver has been applied for the 25 mg (from the 50 mg strength), and for 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg 
and 225 mg strengths (from the 300 mg strength). The applicant provided a tabular listing of the composition 
of the respective strengths and their dissolution curves at pH 1.2, 4.5 and 6.8. More than 85% of the drug was 
dissolved within 15 minutes at all pH values tested.  
Based on these results, the CHMP concluded that the general biowaiver criteria were met. Therefore, two 
bioequivalence studies with the 50 mg and the 300mg doses and a biowaiver for the additional strengths were 
considered adequate. 
Clinical studies 
To support the application, the applicant has submitted 2 bioequivalence studies; Study 005-14 (with the 
highest strength, 300 mg), and Study 006-14 (with 50 mg). Neither pharmacodynamic nor therapeutic 
equivalence studies were submitted.

Blood samples (1 x 6 mL) were collected in pre-labelled vacutainer tubes containing K3EDTA during each period. 
The venous blood samples were withdrawn at pre-dose (0.00) hour and at 0.25, 0.50, 0.75, 1.00, 1.25, 1.50, 
1.75, 2.00, 2.50, 3.00, 3.50, 4.00, 5.00, 6.00, 8.00, 10.00, 12.00, 16.00, 24.00 and 36.00 hours of post dose 
in each period. Bed-side sampling was done up to 5.0 hours post dose. 
Study 006-14 
This study was an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-treatment, two-sequence, two-period, cross-over, 
single dose, comparative oral bioavailability study of Pregabalin capsules 50 mg and Lyrica hard capsules 50 mg 
in healthy, adult subjects under fasting conditions. A washout period of 9 days was maintained between each 
treatment schedule. 
Blood samples were taken in accordance with the same schedule as in study 005-14.

Pregabalin 300 mg hard capsules manufactured by Generics UK Limited (batch No. 2003362, manufacturing 
date May 2013; exp. Date April 2015) has been compared to Lyrica 300 mg hard capsules manufactured by 
Pfizer Limited (Batch No: 0642062 U, exp. date May 2015). 
Study 006-14 
Pregabalin 50 mg hard capsules manufactured by Generics UK Limited (batch No. 2003304, manufacturing date 
May 2013; exp. Date April 2015) has been compared to Lyrica 50 mg hard capsules manufactured by Pfizer 
Limited (Batch No: 0709052 U, exp. date April 2015). 
Population studied   
Study 005-14 and Study 006-14 
Assuming  a  true  ratio  between  0.95  and  1.05  and  an  inter-subject  variability  of  18%  or  less  for  primary 
pharmacokinetic parameters, a minimum of 22 subjects for each study was required to conclude bioequivalence 
with  approximately  90%  power.  To  account  for  subject  withdrawal  and  dropouts  due  to  adverse  events, 
non-compliance or personal reasons, 24 subjects were planned to be randomized and dosed.  
For each study, a total of 24 subjects aged from 21 to 44 years with a body mass index (BMI) in the range of 
18.56-29.76 kg/m2 were selected according to the inclusion and exclusion criteria. They were assessed to be 
healthy according to medical, systemic and physical examination including vital signs, and normal laboratory 
test results (haematology, biochemistry, and urinalysis), 12-lead ECG and chest X-Ray.  
Analytical methods   
Study 005-14 and Study 006-14 
The  analyte  quantitated  in  the  study  was  pregabalin.  The  plasma  samples  of  subjects  were  analysed  using 
LC/MS/MS method for  pregabalin in Human Plasma  (High Performance Liquid Chromatography method with 
Tandem Mass Spectrometry). Internal standard was Pregabalin D4. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/90129/2015 
Page 17/29 
 
  
  
 
The analytical method was developed and validated over a concentration range of 30.003 to 12001.134 ng/ml 
for Pregabalin. Quantitation was performed using a weighted (1/x2) linear least squares regression analysis. 
The bioanalytical method (pre-study and within study) has been satisfactory validated. 
In-study validation for study 005-14: 
The range of precision and accuracy of back-calculated concentration of calibration standards of Pregabalin was 
as follows: 
 
Precision (%): 1.33-3.70. 
  Accuracy (%): 94.10-107.33. 
  Range of calibration: 29.853 ng/mL to 11941.272 ng/mL. 
884 blood samples were analysed. Incurred sample reanalysis was performed on 88 samples. 100% of those 
ISR had less than 20% difference with the original. 
In-study validation for study 006-14: 
The range of precision and accuracy of back-calculated concentration of calibration standards of Pregabalin: 
 
Precision (%): 0.95-1.81. 
  Accuracy (%): 98.83-101.74. 
  Range of calibration: 30.006 ng/mL to 2200.427 ng/mL. 
889 samples were received, 847 blood samples were analysed. Incurred sample reanalysis was performed on 88 
samples. 100% of those ISR had less than 20% difference with the original. 
Pharmacokinetic variables  
Study 005-14 and Study 006-14 
Calculation  of  pharmacokinetic  parameters  was  done  for  pregabalin  using  drug  concentration  time  data  by 
non-compartmental method using WinNonlin Professional Software Version 5.0.1 (Pharsight Corporation, USA). 
These parameters were derived individually for each analysed subject from the concentration vs. time data of 
Pregabalin in plasma. Values below the lower limit of quantification were set to zero. 
The primary pharmacokinetic variables for the assessment of bioequivalence were Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf. The 
secondary pharmacokinetics variables were AUC%, Tmax, Kel and T1/2.  
Statistical methods   
Study 005-14 and Study 006-14 
Statistical comparison of the pharmacokinetic parameters of the two formulations was carried out using PROC 
GLM of SAS® Release 9.1.3 (SAS Institute Inc., USA) to assess the bioequivalence of Pregabalin. 
ANOVA was computed for un-transformed and ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters of Pregabalin Cmax, 
AUC0-t and AUC0-inf. ANOVA model included treatment received, the period at which it is given along with the 
Assessment report

sequence in which each treatment being received and the subject effect (nested within the sequence). Sequence 
effect was tested by using the subject nested within sequence mean square from the ANOVA as the error term. 
Ratio analysis was computed for un-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters of Pregabalin Cmax, AUC0-t and 
AUC0-inf. Descriptive statistics were computed and reported for all pharmacokinetic parameters of Pregabalin. 
An F-test was performed to determine the statistical significance of the period and treatment effects involved in 
the model at a significance level of 5% (alpha=0.05) and sequence effect tested at 10% (alpha=0.10). 
A 90% confidence intervals for the ratio of the test and reference product averages (geometric least squares 
means) were calculated for Pregabalin Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf. 
The power of test to detect 20% difference between test and reference formulations was computed and reported 
for Pregabalin. 
Intra-subject variability was calculated for un-transformed and Ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters of 
Pregabalin Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf.

Safety data 
Study 005-14 
Four subjects experienced a total of four adverse events (vomiting) which led to the withdrawal of these subjects 
from the study. The adverse events were mild in severity.  
No serious adverse events were reported. All subjects were found to be in normal health status at the time of 
post study medical examination. 
Study 006-14 
Two subjects experienced a total of two adverse events (vomiting) which led to the withdrawal of these subjects 
from the study. The adverse events were mild in severity.  
No serious adverse events were reported. All subjects were found to be in normal health status at the time of 
post study medical examination. However, post study safety evaluation was not performed for 2 subjects who 
were absent for period-II and were considered as lost to follow-up.

Conclusions 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study 005-14 Pregabalin Mylan 300 mg is considered bioequivalent with 
Lyrica 300mg. The results can be extrapolated to other strengths: 75 mg, 100 mg, 150 mg, 200 mg and 225 
mg, according to conditions in the Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98. 
Based on the presented bioequivalence study 006-014 Pregabalin Mylan 50 mg is considered bioequivalent with 
Lyrica 50 mg. The results can be extrapolated to other strengths 25 mg strength, according to conditions in the 
Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application. 
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The chosen pharmacokinetic parameters of the BE studies were adequate according to the current guidelines. 
The  statistics  have  been  adequately  described  and  the  standard  acceptance  criteria  were  acceptable.  The 
threshold of a 10% significance level sequence effect (vs. the 5% threshold for period and treatment effects) 
was unusual. However, the CHMP was of the opinion that it did not have consequences on the interpretation of 
the data.  
The number of sample points around Cmax was considered adequate for the estimation of Cmax, calculation of the 
terminal elimination life was considered acceptable, and the analytical method has been validated in a suitable 
range. In study 006-14, the upper range of calibration was lower than the upper range of calibration in the 
method validation. This was acceptable since lower pregabalin plasma concentrations were expected following 
administration of a 50 mg dose.  
A single dose bioequivalence studies were considered sufficient since the application concerns an immediate 
release formulation.  Steady state studies are not indicated as no accumulation of pregabalin is expected, and 
bioavailability is not affected by repeated doses.  
There were no deaths or serious adverse events reported during the conduct of the studies. All adverse events, 
were mild in nature and  resolved. The safety of pregabalin is well documented and both test and reference 
products are expected to have a comparable safety profile.  
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
Based on the results of the pivotal bioequivalence studies submitted, Pregabalin Mylan hard capsules are 
considered bioequivalent to Lyrica hard capsules.

2.8.  Product information 
2.8.1.  User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on the basis of 
a double bridging report making reference to Lyrica (for content) and Memantine Mylan 10 mg film-coated 
tablets (for style and format). The bridging report submitted by the applicant has been found acceptable.  
3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of pregabalin hard capsules. The reference product Lyrica is 
indicated for the treatment of peripheral and central neuropathic pain in adults, adjunctive therapy in adults 
with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation and treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder 
(GAD) in adults. Pregabalin Mylan indication is limited to adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with 
or without secondary generalisation and treatment of Generalised Anxiety Disorder (GAD) in adults, which is 
acceptable. No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the 
available nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a 
clinical perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics 
as well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview based on information 
from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The bioequivalence studies form the pivotal basis with an open-label, balanced, randomized, two-sequence, 
two-period, cross-over, single dose design. The design was considered adequate to evaluate the bioequivalence 
of this formulation and was in line with the respective European requirements. Choice of dose, sampling points, 
overall sampling time as well as wash-out period were adequate. The analytical method was validated. 
Pharmacokinetic and statistical methods applied were adequate. 
Based on the presented bioequivalence studies 005-14 and 006-14, Pregabalin capsules 300 mg are considered 
bioequivalent with Lyrica™ hard capsules 300 mg with respect to rate and extent of absorption of Pregabalin; 
and Pregabalin capsules 50 mg are considered bioequivalent with Lyrica™ hard capsules 50 mg with respect to 
rate and extent of absorption of Pregabalin. 
The results of study 005-14 with 300 mg formulation can be extrapolated to other strengths: 75 mg, 100 mg, 
150 mg, 200 mg and 225 mg, and the results of study 006-14 with 50 mg formulation can be extrapolated to 
the other strength 25 mg, according to conditions in the relevant Guideline. 
A benefit/risk ratio comparable to the reference product can therefore be concluded. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information.  
4.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Pregabalin Mylan in the treatment of 
- adjunctive therapy in adults with partial seizures with or without secondary generalisation.

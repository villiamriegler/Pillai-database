2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a common clinical and pathological condition. The incidence and 
prevalence rates of CHD remain high throughout the world. The estimated number of deaths from 
CHD is 1.95 million in Europe and 0.7 million within the EU. Whilst overall cardiovascular mortality, 
incidence and case fatality rates are declining in most Northern, Southern and Western European 
countries  they  are  not  falling  as  fast  or  even  rising  in  Central  and  Eastern  European  countries. 
Within  Europe,  the  age-standardized  death  rates  from  CHD  show  geographical  variations  with 
lowest rates in Mediterranean countries and highest rates in Eastern Europe.  
Following  an  ACS  event,  patients  are  at  high  risk  of  another  morbid  event  of  ACS  or  stroke  or 
dying  from  a  CV  cause.  An  important  component  of  the  current  standard  care  for  post  ACS 
patients is the long term use of antiplatelet agents, principally ASA with or without the addition of 
a thienopyridine, such as clopidogrel. 
Despite the widespread use of antiplatelet agents in the acute and chronic setting, the incidence of 
CV events such as CV death, MI or stroke in the post-ACS population remains high; the CV event 
rate was 9.8% at 12 months in patients treated with ticagrelor in the PLATO trial. Since many of 
the clinical events that occur in ACS patients are due to acute and subacute thrombosis, an 
additional management strategy is the use of an anticoagulant either instead of or in addition to 
antiplatelet (ASA and thienopyridine) therapy.  
The development programme/compliance with CHMP 
guidance/scientific advice 
At  the  scientific  advice  meetings  held  at  EMA  in  2007  and  2008,  the  MAH  presented  the  clinical 
development program for the ACS indication and discussed the phase II program and the design of 
the  single  large  multicenter,  randomized,  double-blind,  non-inferiority,  event-driven  phase  III 
study in patients with ACS. 
Furthermore  in  2008,  the  MAH  presented  preliminary  results  of  the  phase  II  study  and  the  next 
steps  in  clinical  development  program  (i.e.  phase  III  study)  for  the  “prevention  of  cardiovascular 
events  in  patients  with  ACS”.  At  that  meeting  the  program  for  the  conduct  of  the  single  large 
multicenter phase III study in patients with ACS was discussed. 
The  following  topics  discussed  at  that  meeting  were  adhered  to  and  implemented  into  the 
development  program.  These  covered  1)  single  trial  concept,  2)  choice  of  dose,  3)  inclusion  and 
exclusion  criteria,  4)  definition  of  the  primary  efficacy  outcomes,  5)  definition  of  the  safety 
outcomes, 6) statistical plan, 7) PK/PD investigations, 8) streamlined monitoring approach, 9) AE s 
of  special  interest,  10)  liver  monitoring  and  11)  reporting  requirements  for  efficacy  and  safety 
endpoints. 
Standard of care treatment was in accordance with the relevant international guideline documents 
of the relevant international scientific societies. 
Overall  it  can  be  stated  that  recommendations  given  in  the  scientific  advice  procedures  were 
followed during the clinical development program.

and / or batch release site are not considered necessary for completion of the module 3 
assessment. 
GLP:  
The MAH stated that all pivotal toxicology studies have been performed under GLP. 
GCP:  
The company stated that all studies included in this application were conducted and reported in 
accordance with the ethical principles originating in the Declaration of Helsinki and in accordance 
with International Conference on Harmonisation Good Clinical Practice guidelines, applicable 
regulatory requirements, and in compliance with the respective protocols. During the assessment 
of the submitted clinical data no signal were detected which would raise overall doubts about this 
statement. 
Type of application and other comments on the submitted dossier 
This is a line extension application for Xarelto (rivaroxaban) according to article 8(3) according to 
directive 2001/83/EC for a new proposed indication 
“Prevention of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis in patients after 
an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (non-ST elevation or ST elevation myocardial infarction or 
unstable angina) in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus a 
thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine).” 
Rivaroxaban is a potent selective oral direct factor Xa inhibitor. The drug substance is 
manufactured at Bayer Pharma AG, Wuppertal, Germany, and is micronised at Bayer Pharma AG, 
Leverkusen, Germany. 
Rivaroxaban is a white or yellowish solid. It crystallizes in three modifications with melting points 
of 230°C (Modification I) and 203°C (Modification II), a transition point of about 127°C 
(Modification III), furthermore a NMP solvate (= N-methyl-pyrrolidone solvate), a THF inclusion 
compound, and a hydrate. The amorphous form (glass transition point: about 83°C) can exist at 
room temperature. From absolute zero (-273°C) to its melting point (230°C) modification I is the 
thermodynamically stable polymorph. The identity of modification I is controlled by Raman 
spectroscopy. 
Rivaroxaban is practically insoluble in 0.1 and 0.01 M hydrochloric acid, in buffered solutions  
pH = 3 to pH = 9, water, n-heptane, toluene and in 2-propanol. It is very slightly soluble in 
ethanol, methanol and ethyl acetate. It is slightly soluble in acetone, acetonitrile, dichloromethane 
and macrogol 400. Rivaroxaban is soluble in dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidone and 
dimethylsulfoxide. 
In 2008 an immediate-release film-coated tablet containing 10 mg rivaroxaban for oral 
use was centrally approved in the European Union under the brand name Xarelto. The 
indication was the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in adult patients 
undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery. The 15 mg and 20 mg rivaroxaban 
film-coated tablets, which were approved in 2011, are indicated for the treatment of 
deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE, and prevention of recurrent 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013  
Page 9/75 
 
 
 
 
 
DVT and pulmonary embolism (PE) in adults. (See section 4.4 for haemodynamically 
unstable PE patients.)  
The initially applied indication for rivaroxaban 2.5 mg film-coated tablet is for the prevention of 
cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis in patients after an acute 
coronary syndrome (ACS) (non-ST elevation or ST elevation myocardial infarction or unstable 
angina) in combination with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus a thienopyridine 
(clopidogrel or ticlopidine). 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The product is presented as film coated tablets containing 2.5 mg of rivaroxaban (as ethanolate) 
as active substance. 
The composition is described in section 6.1. of the SmPC. 
The product is packaged in the same Polypropylene/Aluminium foil blisters as the previously 
authorised strengths. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Rivaroxaban active substance used for the manufacture of Xarelto 2.5 mg film-coated tablets is of 
the  same  quality  as  that  used  for  the  already-marketed  Xarelto  10  mg,  15  mg  and  20  mg  film-
coated tablets.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Pharmaceutical Development 
The new 2.5 mg strength was developed as a small sized film-coated tablet to be used exclusively 
in  a  new  proposed  indication: prevention of  cardiovascular  death,  myocardial infarction  and  stent 
thrombosis in patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) (non-ST elevation or ST elevation 
myocardial  infarction  or  unstable  angina)  in  combination  with  acetylsalicylic  acid  (ASA)  alone  or 
with ASA plus a thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine). 
The 2.5 mg film-coated tablets are manufactured with the currently approved active substance 
which is already used for the other authorised strengths. The formulation development studies are 
analogous to those provided for the previously authorised strengths. 
 Xarelto coated tablets 2.5 mg are manufactured as a standard immediate-release formulation 
with a standard fluid-bed granulation process followed by tableting and standard film-coating. 
During development and scale-up, the impact of manufacturing conditions on target properties of 
the final dosage form such as tablet hardness, disintegration, dissolution, content uniformity and 
stability were investigated. Tablet hardness, disintegration, content uniformity and stability were 
determined to be non-critical product properties. Tablet dissolution rate was determined to be 
influenced by the active substance particle size. Therefore, particle size of rivaroxaban is 
considered critical and is controlled by appropriate specification limits for the active substance. 
Assessment report

The  composition  of  tablets  intended  for  market  supply  does  not  change  compared  to  the  clinical 
trials formulation except for the colour of film-coating. 
The excipients used in the 2.5 mg strength are the same as those used for the already authorised 
strengths. All the excipients comply with the Ph. Eur. 
The finished product is packaged in polypropylene-aluminium blister. The packaging material used 
is in compliance with Ph. Eur. requirements. The stability studies indicate that the primary 
packaging is suitable for maintaining finished product quality. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition 
as those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared 
without the use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on 
Minimising the Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and 
veterinary medicinal products. 
Manufacture of the product 
The finished product is manufactured as standard immediate-release formulation with a standard 
fluid-bed granulation process followed by tableting and standard film-coating. 
The manufacturing process has been validated by a number of studies for the major steps of the 
manufacturing  process  and  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  capable  and  to  be  able  to  reproducibly 
produce finished product of the intended quality. The in process controls are adequate for this film- 
coated tablet preparation.  
The batch analysis data (n=3) shows that the tablets can be manufactured reproducibly according 
to the agreed finished product specification, which is suitable for control of this oral preparation. 
Product specification 
The  finished  product  release  specifications  are  identical  to  the  already  authorized  strengths  and   
include appropriate tests for appearance (visual inspection), identity (HPLC, TLC/NIR), dissolution 
(HPLC,  UV/vis),  degradation  products  (HPLC),  assay  (HPLC,  95.0  %  -  105.0  %),  uniformity  of 
dosage units (HPLC), and microbiological purity (Ph. Eur.). 
Batch analysis results in 3 full-scale batches validate consistency and uniformity of manufacture 
and indicate that the process is capable and under control. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data was generated for 3 pilot batches stored in the primary packaging intended for use 
in the marketed product under normal and intermediate conditions (25°C ± 2°C, 60 %RH ± 5 %RH 
and 30°C ± 2°C, 75 %RH ± 5 %RH) for 24 months and under accelerated conditions (40°C ± 2°C, 
75 %RH ± 5 %RH) for 6 months. Additionally the batches were stored for a period of 60 months at 
5°C without control of relative humidity. Bulk stability data was also generated for 24 months in 1 
batch  in  a  polyethylene  bag  and  tightly  closed  tin  can  and  stored  under  climate  zone  I–IV 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013

conditions.  The  containers  were  opened  repeatedly  to  remove  one  bag  for  each  time  point.  Data 
covering a period of 24 months are documented. 
Samples  of  the  finished  product  were  stored  under  thermal  and  hydrolytic  stress  in  order  to 
investigate  the  formation  of  potential  degradation  products  and  to  assess  the  influence  of 
temperature  and  humidity  on  the  physico-chemical  properties  of  the  formulation.  The  thermal 
stress was projected for 12 months and the humidity stress for 24 months. 
Photostability  studies  were  performed  according  to  ICH  guideline  Q1B,  "Photostability  Testing  of 
New Drug Substances and Products". The finished product is stable upon exposure to light without 
immediate packaging. 
The parameters studied were appearance (formulation, form, colour), any unspecified degradation 
product,  sum  of  all  degradation  products,  assay,  dissolution  after  30  min.,  and  microbial  purity. 
Additionally  the  tests  for  hardness,  disintegration  and  water  were  performed  on  an  informative 
basis  using  the  pharmacopoeial  test  methods  of  the  Ph.  Eur..  All  batches  were  packaged  in  the 
commercial packaging material.  
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life as stated in the SmPC is acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information  on  development,  manufacture  and  control  of  the  new  2.5  mg  strength  Xarelto  film-
coated  tablets  has  been  presented  in  a  satisfactory  manner.  The  results  of  tests  carried  out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn 
lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in the 
clinic. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological 
aspects 
The  quality  of  this  product  is  considered  to  be  acceptable  when  used  in  accordance  with  the 
conditions  defined  in  the  SmPC.  Physicochemical  and  biological  aspects  relevant  to  the  uniform 
clinical  performance  of  the  product  have  been  investigated  and  are  controlled  in  a  satisfactory 
way.  
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
Not applicable 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
Rivaroxaban, an oxazolidinone derivate, is a potent, selective, orally active small-molecule and 
direct FXa inhibitor. 
The activated serine protease Factor X (FXa) plays a central role in the blood coagulation, as it 
acts at the convergence point of the intrinsic and extrinsic coagulation pathways. FXa catalyzes the 
conversion of prothrombin to thrombin; one molecule of FXa results in the generation of more than 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013  
Page 12/75 
 
 
 
 
 
1000 thrombin molecules. Inhibition of FXa blocks this burst of thrombin generation, thereby 
diminishing thrombin-mediated activation of coagulation. Thus, inhibition of FXa is supposed to be 
an effective strategy for the prevention of both arterial and venous thrombosis. 
In addition to previously submitted and assessed studies new in vitro and in vivo investigations 
have now been performed to further characterize the pharmacological profile of rivaroxaxaban, 
especially regarding mode of action and interaction potential with inhibitors of platelet 
aggregation. 
In contrast to the direct thrombin inhibitors, rivaroxaban did not increase thrombin generation in 
the presence of thrombomodulin (which activates the protein C pathway) suggesting that it does 
not suppress the negative-feedback reaction by inhibition of protein C activation. 
Rivaroxaban did not increase a hypercoaguable status; it indirectly reduced thrombin induced 
platelet aggregation, showed antithrombotic efficacy in preventing arterial thrombosis in 
hypercholesterolemic atherosclerotic mice and in stent thrombosis in an extracorporeal circuit in 
pigs. The antithrombotic efficacy was further enhanced in the presence of ASA, P2Y12 receptor 
blockers (clopidogrel or ticagrelor) and their combinations. In addition, a plaque stabilizing effect 
of rivaroxaban in atherosclerotic mice was also indicated, as was an inhibitory effect on 
inflammatory signalling in human atrial slices.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetic profile of rivaroxaban is well known. No new data have been submitted in this 
application except for studies on transporters which are discussed and assessed in the Clinical 
part. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology  
Rivaroxaban/Xarelto has been approved for other indications in 2008 and 2011, respectively, and 
a full non-clinical programme has thus been submitted previously. In the present application four 
additional studies in juvenile animals, two pilot studies and two pivotal studies have been 
submitted. 
The NOAEL of the subchronic repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats was established at 20 mg/kg for 
males and at 60 mg/kg for females in the first study using the same vehicle throughout the study 
and at 60 mg/kg in the second study in which the vehicle was changed at day 20 and an increased 
exposure was achieved. In the first study histopathological examination revealed a slight increase 
of periinsular alterations (hemorrhage, fibrosis, inflammation) in the pancreas of high dose males. 
In the thyroid glands of males dosed at 60 mg/kg, a higher incidence of colloidal alteration was 
seen in the first juvenile study (0-0-1-5 out of 12 animals at 0, 6, 20 and 60 mg/kg, respectively), 
whereas follicular cell hypertrophy showed no clear-cut treatment-related effect (3-1-2-5 out of 12 
animals). In the second juvenile study, in which significantly higher exposures were achieved at 
the same doses, the incidence of colloidal alteration seen in the thyroid glands of male rats was 
not different in exposed animals as compared to controls (3-1-3-4 out of 12 animals) and no clear-
cut treatment-related effect on follicular cell hypertrophy was neither seen (7-5-8-5 out of 12 
animals in males and 1-3-2-1 out of 12 animals in females). 
It is concluded that the investigations of rivaroxaban in juvenile rats did not reveal any new 
toxicity so far unknown from testing adolescent or adult animals and thus that the safety profile in 
juvenile rats appears to be in line with previous findings. Minor effects on pancreatic peri-insular 
findings as well as on the thyroid gland seen in the first subchronic toxicity study were not 
confirmed in the second study showing significantly higher systemic exposure. The numerical

increase in pancreatic peri-insular lesions (hemorrhage, hemosiderin, and fibrosis) and colloid 
alteration in the thyroids in the first juvenile study was therefore considered to be incidental. 
Overall, the toxicological profile of rivaroxaban remains unchanged considering the new juvenile 
toxicity data in rats. 
The SmPC section 5.3 was updated accordingly to reflect the results of the juvenile toxicity study.  
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
In the previous submitted ERA for the maximum recommended daily dose of 30 mg 
(EMEA/H/C/0944/X/10) it was concluded (based on generated experimental data) that no 
environmental risk for rivaroxaban in surface-, groundwater and waste water treatment plants, 
respectively, was anticipated.  
The conclusion is therefore that the lower daily dose of 5 mg Rivaroxaban applied for in the 
present application is neither expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.5.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Rivaroxaban is already approved in different indications for prevention and treatment of thrombo-
embolic events. The maximum recommended daily dose is 20 mg once daily for chronic use and 
30 mg/day (2x15 mg) for short term use. For the indication “Secondary Prevention of Acute 
Coronary Syndrome” a lower dose of 5 mg (2.5 mg bid) is proposed. Rivaroxaban was investigated 
in different in vitro and in vivo models to further characterize its pharmacological profile especially 
regarding mode of action and interaction potential with inhibitors of platelet aggregation and in 
repeat-dose studies in juvenile rats. The new nonclinical data on primary pharmacodynamics as 
well as on pharmacodynamic drug-drug interaction and data on juvenile animal toxicity of 
rivaroxaban do not influence the overall nonclinical risk assessment which thus remains 
unchanged. In summary, no new safety concerns emerged from the updated non clinical data. The 
new lower dosage level of Rivaroxaban applied for is not expected to pose a risk to the 
environment. 
2.3.6.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
There are no objections to approval from a non-clinical perspective. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The rivaroxaban ACS program was a multinational program to evaluate the efficacy and safety of 
rivaroxaban compared with placebo in addition to standard care antiplatelet therapy in subjects 
with ACS.  The program included: 
•  1 supportive global phase II study BAY 59 7939/11898, also known as the ATLAS ACS TIMI 46 
Trial (Anti-Xa Therapy to Lower cardiovascular events in addition to Aspirin with or without 
thienopyridine therapy in Subjects with Acute Coronary Syndrome). 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013

•  1 pivotal global phase III study BAY 59 7939/13194, also known as the ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 
Trial (The second trial of Anti-Xa Therapy to Lower cardiovascular events in Addition to 
standard therapy in Subjects with Acute Coronary Syndrome). 
Both studies were multicenter, prospective, randomized, parallel group/or sequential parallel-
group, placebo controlled, multi-dose, and double-blind studies that compared the efficacy and 
safety of oral rivaroxaban with placebo in addition to standard care antiplatelet therapy (aspirin or 
aspirin combined with a thienopyridine) in subjects with a recent ACS event. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The  MAH  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK part of the application consists of three parts, the in vivo biopharmaceutical 
characterization of the new rivaroxaban tablet strength (2.5 mg), some new in vitro transporter 
studies as well as population PK/PD and exposure-response analyses of rivaroxaban in the target 
population. 
Characterization of the new rivaroxaban tablet strength (2.5 mg) (Study 12361) 
Study 12361 was conducted in a single-center, randomized, non-blinded, 3-way cross-over, non 
placebo controlled design. 24 healthy male subjects aged 20 to 45 years were enrolled. 23 
subjects completed the 3 periods of the study according to protocol and were included in the PK 
analysis set. 
The study drug was administered under fasting conditions. 
The results are presented below:

An exploratory across-study analysis of covariance on 42 Phase 1 trials, covering rivaroxaban 
single-dose administrations from 1.25 to 80 mg and multiple-dose administrations from 5 to 30 
mg, showed that the intake of rivaroxaban tablets with or without food did have a statistically 
significant effect on AUC and Cmax of rivaroxaban plasma concentrations over all applied doses: 
AUC was approximately 20% higher and Cmax was approximately 40% higher under fed condition 
compared to fasting condition. However, this food effect was primarily driven by data obtained 
with rivaroxaban doses greater than 10 mg. When limiting the across-study analysis to 
rivaroxaban tablet doses less than or equal to 10 mg, any relevant food effects were less 
apparent, while for tablet doses equal and above 15 mg food effects became obvious and 
pronounced. 
Based on the results from this pooled analysis and the lack of a relevant food effect observed in a 
food effect study with a 10 mg rivaroxaban tablet, a dedicated food effect study was not conducted 
on lower strength formulations, in particular the 2.5 mg tablet strength. 
in vitro studies, transport proteins (study PH-36523 and study PH-36522) 
In study PH-36523, the uptake of rivaroxaban into human embryonic kidney control cells and cells 
overexpressing OATP1B1 and OATP1B3 was investigated. No active uptake of rivaroxaban was 
observed for OATP1B1 and for OATP1B3. Rivaroxaban did not reduce the active uptake of 
pravastatin into HEK-OATP1B1 cells and HEK-OATP1B3 cells at concentrations of 1 μM and 10 μM.

In study PH-36522, the uptake of rivaroxaban into human embryonic kidney control cells and cells 
overexpressing OAT1, OAT3 and OCT2 was investigated. Based on this in vitro data, rivaroxaban is 
neither a substrate nor an inhibitor of OAT1 and OCT2 at clinically relevant concentrations. 
Rivaroxaban showed an interaction potential in OAT3-expressing HEK cells. The uptake of 
rivaroxaban was 1.5-fold higher in OAT3-transfected cells than in vector-transfected cells. Further, 
the OAT probe substrate Estrone 3-sulfate and the OAT-inhibitor probenecid showed a weak 
inhibition of the uptake of rivaroxaban. In OAT3-transfected cells, 1 μM rivaroxaban caused a 
significant inhibition of 22% of the OAT3 mediated uptake of estrone 3-sulfate. 
In study PH-36581, the inhibitory potential of dronedarone towards P-gp mediated efflux of 
rivaroxaban was investigated with P-gp-transfected LLC-PK1 cells. The efflux of rivaroxaban in 
LLC-MDR1 cells was inhibited by dronedarone with an IC50 of 0.37 μM.  
Population PK/PD and exposure-response analyses of rivaroxaban in the target population 
The pharmacokinetic data from study RIVAROXACS2001 / ATLAS ACS TIMI 46 was evaluated using 
population pharmacokinetic modelling (PopPK). The PK of rivaroxaban in patients with ACS was 
adequately described by an oral one-compartment model with first-order absorption and first-
order elimination. The patient covariates included in the model, were age and renal function 
effects on CL/F, and body weight and age effects on V/F. The typical values of CL/F and V/F in 
patients with ACS at a dose of 2.5 mg were comparable to those in patients with VTE following 
knee and hip surgery at a 2.5-mg dosing regimen. 
The PK/PD analyses of the ATLAS study were conducted in a subgroup of patients where time 
matched PK and PD samples were collected. The PD measurements include prothrombin time (PT) 
and prothrombinase induced clotting time (PiCT). Rivaroxaban plasma concentrations showed a 
close-to-linear relationship with PT in the ACS population. The parameter estimates for the current 
ACS population are consistent with those reported for the DVT and AF populations. 
A statistical analysis of data from the ATLAS study was performed to quantify the influence of 
rivaroxaban exposure on the hazard of clinically significant bleeding in addition to clinically 
relevant covariates, and to test if there was a difference in the bleeding hazard between the once 
daily regimens and twice daily regimens in the exposure-bleeding outcome relationship. A Cox 
Proportional Hazards model relating AUC24 and rivaroxaban treatment (dichotomous variable) 
linearly to the hazard of clinically significant bleeding was used to describe the data. 
2.4.1.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Rivaroxaban is a potent and highly selective direct FXa inhibitor that is orally bioavailable. 
In a subgroup of ACS patients from study ATLAS TIMI 46, prothrombin fragment 1 and 2 (F1.2) 
was measured. Compared to patients receiving placebo, rivaroxaban administration was associated 
with a significant reduction in F1.2 concentration 8-24 hours after administration which continued 
throughout the 180 days of treatment, indicating a persisting effect of rivaroxaban on reduction of 
thrombin generation over time. 
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacodynamics for rivaroxaban have been well characterised in studies assessed in earlier 
applications. 
Assessment report

2.4.3.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
There are no objections to approval from a pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic perspective. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study (study 11898) 
The main purpose of the phase II study, ATLAS ACS TIMI 46, study 11898, was to estimate the 
correct dose of rivaroxaban that should be given to patients with a recent ACS. The secondary 
purpose was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of rivaroxaban in subjects with acute coronary 
syndrome who received standard care antiplatelet therapy. 
Efficacy and safety endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint was the composite of all-cause death, MI, stroke, or SRIR (severe 
recurrent ischemia requiring revascularization).  
The key secondary efficacy endpoint was the composite of all-cause death, MI, or stroke. 
The primary safety endpoint was the incidence of clinically significant bleeding, a composite of 
TIMI major bleeding, TIMI minor bleeding, or bleeding requiring medical attention. 
For ATLAS ACS TIMI 46 study (11898) the following main inclusion and exclusion criteria were 
applied.

Methods 
The ATLAS ACS TIMI 46 study was randomized, multicenter, double-blind and placebo-controlled. 
The study was originally planned in 2 stages: Stage 1 for dose escalation and Stage 2 for dose 
confirmation. Stage 1 enrollment was expanded obviating the need for Stage 2, which was never 
performed. 
The study consisted of a 6-month double-blind treatment period and a 1-month follow up period 
and compared once-daily dosing with twice-daily dosing within the same total daily dose (TDD). A 
total of 3,491 subjects with ACS were randomized to various rivaroxaban dose groups. This 
included 761 (21.8%) in Stratum 1 (ASA only) and 2730 (78.2%) in Stratum 2 
(ASA+thienopyridine); among them, 2,331 subjects were randomly assigned to receive 
rivaroxaban and 1160 subjects to receive placebo. 
Dosage 
If the subject received intravenous UFH or bivalirudin, the first dose of study drug was to be 
administered at the time that the UFH or bivalirudin infusion was stopped. If the subject received 
subcutaneous UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux the first dose of study drug was to be administered at 
the time that the next planned dose of subcutaneous UFH, LMWH, or fondaparinux would have 
been given (e.g., 12 to 24 hours after the previous dose). If no form of anticoagulation was 
administered at the time of randomization, dosing may have begun immediately. To minimize time 
beyond the recommended interval on the first day, it was preferred to begin dosing in the 
afternoon or evening. If a PCI had been performed, dosing was initiated as described above, but 
≥4 hours following PCI. Study drug was taken with or without food. In both strata individual 
subjects remained on the dose and dosing regimen to which they were randomized, for the 6-
month treatment period. 
2.5.1.1.  Results 
The rate of primary composite endpoint of all-cause death, MI, stroke or SRI requiring 
revascularization was 6.0% (141/2331) for the rivaroxaban combined dose group and 7.2% 
(83/1160) for the placebo group. A relative risk reduction (RRR) of 16% was observed with a

hazard ratio (HR) of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.64, 1.10), and a Log-rank p-value of 0.213. The rate of key 
secondary composite endpoint of all-cause death, MI or stroke was 4.3% (101/2331) for the 
rivaroxaban combined dose group and 5.7% (66/1160) for the placebo group. A RRR of 24% was 
observed with a HR of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.55, 1.03) and a Log-rank p-value of 0.077. (see below

Dose response 
In Stratum 1, there was an indication of a dose response of rivaroxaban. For the primary efficacy 
endpoint, the Hazard Ratio (HR) (95% CI) for rivaroxaban 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg TDD groups, 
as compared with the pooled placebo group were 0.65 (0.35, 1.22), 0.64 (0.36, 1.15), and 0.40 
(0.19, 0.84), respectively. For the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the HR (95% CI) for 
rivaroxaban 5 mg, 10 mg, and 20 mg TDD groups, as compared with the pooled placebo group 
were 0.78 (0.41, 1.47), 0.62 (0.33, 1.18), and 0.37 (0.16, 0.84), respectively. The trend of the 
risk reduction over the dose levels for the key secondary efficacy endpoint was statistically 
significant (p-value = 0.01). 
In Stratum 2, MAH found that the primary and key secondary efficacy results showed no clear 
dose response for rivaroxaban, but rather a similar reduction with all doses. For the primary 
efficacy endpoint, the HR (95% CI) for rivaroxaban 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg TDD groups, 
as compared with the pooled placebo group were 1.07 (0.53, 2.19), 0.82 (0.54, 1.26), and 1.43 
(0.89, 2.29), and 1.10 (0.69, 1.76), respectively. For the key secondary efficacy endpoint, the HR 
for rivaroxaban 5 mg, 10 mg, 15 mg, and 20 mg TDD groups, as compared with the pooled 
placebo group were 0.62 (0.22, 1.73), 0.75 (0.45, 1.23), 1.47 (0.86, 2.51), and 0.80 (0.44, 1.47), 
respectively. The trend of the risk reduction over the dose levels for the key secondary efficacy 
endpoint was not statistically significant (p = 0.99). 
The detailed results of the primary endpoint and its components are shown in the table E3 below.

Table E3 : Treatment Effect of Primary and Key Secondary Efficacy Endpoints by Dose 
Level Against Pooled Placebo Group (Study Atlas ACS TIMI 46: Intent-to-Treat Analysis 
Set 
There was a significant interaction (p=0.04) in the effect of treatment with rivaroxaban on the 
composite endpoint of death, MI, and stroke, indicating effect modification by background 
antiplatelet therapy resulting in different risk reduction between the 2 strata. MAH also concluded, 
that the margin for additional risk reduction by anticoagulants in Stratum 2 with ASA plus a 
thienopyridine appeared to be narrower than that in Stratum 1 with ASA alone. 
Bleedings 
The primary safety endpoint was the incidence bleeding events that were classified as major, 
minor, or bleeding requiring medical attention. 
• 
• 
TIMI Major Bleeding: was defined as any intracranial bleeding or clinically overt bleeding 
that was associated with a decrease in hemoglobin of ≥5 g/dL or an absolute drop in 
hematocrit of ≥15%; 
TIMI Minor Bleeding: was defined as any clinically overt bleeding, including bleeding that is 
evident on imaging studies, that was associated with a decrease in hemoglobin by ≥3 g/dL 
but <5 g/dL from baseline hemoglobin value; 
•  Bleeding Requiring Medical Attention: was defined as any bleeding that required medical 
treatment, surgical treatment, or laboratory evaluation and did not meet criteria for major 
or minor bleeding, as defined above. 
The results are summarised in the following table : 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013  
Page 23/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The overall results for the twice-daily dosing regimen tended to be numerically better than the 
once-daily dosing regimen results. For the primary efficacy endpoint, the HR (95% CI) was 1.14 
(0.82, 1.58) for the once-daily dosing regimen versus the twice-daily dosing regimen.  
Stratum 1, once-daily dosing was slightly better than twice-daily dosing [HR (95% CI), 0.91(0.49, 
1.70)]; whereas, for Stratum 2, once-daily dosing was worse than twice-daily dosing [HR (95% 
CI), 1.24(0.84, 1.84)].  
Similar results were observed for the individual rivaroxaban dose level compared with the pooled 
placebo group, or compared with each placebo dose level. Comparison of the effect of the 
rivaroxaban 5 mg and 10 mg TDD groups (administered as either 5 mg, and 10 mg once-daily or 
2.5 mg, and 5 mg twice-daily) on the key secondary efficacy endpoint showed a greater RRR with 
the twice-daily dosing regimen. Across strata, rivaroxaban at doses of 2.5 mg and 5 mg twice-
daily resulted in 46% and 37% relative reductions in risk for the key secondary efficacy endpoint 
while rivaroxaban doses of 5 mg and 10 mg administered once-daily resulted in 8% and 24% RRR 
in the same endpoint. This was observed in both Stratum 1 and Stratum 2. 
The MAH concluded, that rivaroxaban TDD of 5 and 10 mg appeared to have an acceptable safety 
profile, had less bleeding than the higher doses, and within these 2.5 mg and 5 mg twice daily 
were numerically more efficacious than the once-daily doses, and offered a more favorable net 
clinical benefit. Higher doses of rivaroxaban were not associated with increased efficacy in subjects 
receiving rivaroxaban in addition to dual antiplatelet therapy. This led to the selection of 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg and 5 mg twice-daily doses for testing in the phase III ATLAS ACS2-TIMI 51 
study. 
For the secondary goal of evaluating the efficacy of rivaroxaban in subjects with ACS in addition to 
standard care antiplatelet therapy, MAH concluded that although the phase II study was not 
powered to identify differences between individual dose groups, the results suggested that 
rivaroxaban may meaningfully reduce major CV events with an acceptable incremental bleeding 
risk in addition to ASA or ASA plus a thienopyridine in ACS patients.

2.5.1.2.  Discussion 
The study was a well-designed dose-escalating and dose-finding study planned to be performed in 
two sequentially stages. According to the MAH, due to that enrollment proceeded quickly in Stage 
1, additional dose panels were tested and previously tested dose panels repeated. The increased 
size of Stage 1 lead to that the planned confirmation stage was never initiated and the efficacy and 
safety analyses planned in Stage 2 was performed within Stage 1. The study was however not 
powered for assessing treatment effects for individual doses or dose regimens.  
However, some important patient groups, and patients with a recent ischemic stroke or transient 
ischemic attack (TIA) were excluded from the study. 
There was no prominent difference between the doses for the primary and key secondary efficacy 
results in Stratum 2 and there was no clear indication for a reduction in any dose group.  
The twice-daily rivaroxaban dosing regimen had a numerically greater effect on the primary and 
key secondary endpoints than the once-daily regimen. 
It is important to note, that the margin for additional risk reduction appeared to be less when the 
patient is treated with dual antiplatelet therapy. A clear dose-response relationship with regard to 
bleedings was demonstrated. The bleeding pattern was consistent with what has been recorded for 
rivaroxaban in other indications with a predominance for mucosal bleedings. 
There was a significant interaction (p=0.04) in the effect of treatment with rivaroxaban on the 
composite endpoint of death, MI, and stroke, indicating effect modification by background 
antiplatelet therapy resulting in different risk reduction between the 2 strata. MAH concluded, that 
the margin for additional risk reduction by anticoagulants in Stratum 2 with ASA plus a 
thienopyridine appeared to be narrower than that in Stratum 1 with ASA alone. 
Thus the margin for additional risk reduction appeared to be less when the patient is treated with 
dual antiplatelet therapy.  
The reasons for the twice daily dosing regimen in the phase III study and the safety profile 
appeared to be somewhat more advantageous in the phase II trial as highlighted by the MAH 
appear acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.5.2.  Main study (study 13194) 
The main study is the ATLAS ACS2-TIMI 51 study (The Second Trial of Anti-Xa Therapy to Lower 
Cardiovascular Events in Addition to Aspirin with or without Thienopyridine Therapy in Subjects 
with Acute Coronary Syndrome), study number 13194. The ATLAS ACS2-TIMI 51 study was a 
randomized, multicenter, double-blind, event-driven and placebo-controlled phase III study.  
15526 patients were included at 766 centers in 44 countries.  
The study was designed to determine whether rivaroxaban in addition to standard care antiplatelet 
therapy reduces the risk of the composite of CV death, MI, or stroke in subjects with a recent ACS 
event compared with placebo.

Study participants  
The study ATLAS ACS2-TIMI 51 enrolled adult subjects who had been hospitalized for symptoms 
suggestive of ACS or developed ACS while being hospitalized, and who were receiving ASA therapy 
(75 to 100 mg/day) alone or in combination with a thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine, per 
the national or locally indicated dosage).  This population was chosen as the company considered 
it representative of those patients with a recent ACS who were at moderate to high risk for 
thromboembolic CV complications. About 50% of all randomized subjects had STEMI. NSTEMI and 
unstable angina comprised about 25% each of the ACS index events for admitting diagnosis. 
•  Key Inclusion Criteria 
Subjects had to satisfy the following criteria to be enrolled in the study: 
•  Man or woman, 18 years of age or older 
•  Currently receiving ASA therapy (75 to 100 mg/day) alone or in combination with a 
thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine per national dosing recommendation) 
•  Had been hospitalized for symptoms suggestive of ACS that lasted at least 10 minutes at 
rest, and occurred 48 hours or less before hospital presentation or who developed ACS 
while being hospitalized for an indication other than ACS, and have a diagnosis of: 
o  STEMI: 
o  NSTEMI: 
o  UA with at least 1 of the following: 
–  transient or persistent ST-segment deviation 0.1 mV or greater in 1 or more ECG 
leads 
–  TIMI risk score of ≥4. 
•  Subjects who were 18 to 54 years of age inclusive must also have had either diabetes 
mellitus or a prior MI in addition to the presenting ACS event. 
Patients with STEMI had to have elevated biomarkers of myocardial necrosis (CK-MB or troponin).

•  Key Exclusion Criteria 
Potential subjects who met any of the following criteria were to be excluded from participating in 
the study: 
Bleeding risk: 
•  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, contraindicated anticoagulant 
therapy or would have an unacceptable risk of bleeding, such as, but not limited to, the 
following: 
o  active internal bleeding, clinically significant bleeding, bleeding at a noncompressible 
site, or bleeding diathesis within 30 days of randomization 
o  platelet count <90,000/μL at screening 
o  history of intracranial hemorrhage 
o  major surgery, biopsy of a parenchymal organ, or serious trauma (including head 
trauma) within 30 days before randomization 
clinically significant gastrointestinal bleeding within 12 months before randomization 
o 
o  have an International Normalized Ratio (INR) known to be >1.5 at the time of 
screening 
o  abciximab bolus or infusion within the 8 hours prior to randomization, or an eptifibatide 
or tirofiban bolus or infusion within the past 2 hours before randomization 
o  any other condition known to increase the risk of bleeding 
Severe concomitant diseases such as: 
•  Cardiogenic shock at the time of randomization 
•  Ventricular arrhythmias refractory to treatment at the time of randomization 
•  Calculated creatinine clearance <30 mL/min at screening 
•  Known significant liver disease (e.g., acute hepatitis, chronic active hepatitis, cirrhosis), or 
liver function test (LFT) abnormalities (confirmed with repeat testing) which would require 
study drug discontinuation, i.e., alanine aminotransferase (ALT) >5x upper limit of normal 
(ULN) or ALT >3x ULN plus total bilirubin >2x ULN 
•  A prior ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (TIA) in subjects who the investigator 
planned to include in Stratum 2 (ASA plus thienopyridine). (Note: subjects with a prior 
ischemic stroke or TIA were eligible for inclusion in the study only if they intended to be 
treated with ASA only). Subjects with a prior hemorrhagic stroke were excluded completely 
from the study.  
•  Anemia (i.e., hemoglobin <10 g/dL) at screening 
•  Known clinical history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection at screening 
•  Substance abuse (drug or alcohol) problem within the previous 6 months 
•  Any severe condition that would limit life expectancy to less than 6 months 
Atrial fibrillation was also an exclusion criterion, except for subjects younger than 60 years of age 
who had no clinical or echocardiographic evidence of cardiopulmonary disease and who had only a 
single episode of atrial fibrillation that occurred more than 2 years ago.  
Patients with a prior ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack, TIA, were excluded from 
inclusion in the group that were supposed to receive both ASA and a thienopyridine.

Treatments 
Patients were randomized to rivaroxaban 2.5 mg or 5 mg, or placebo, twice daily in addition to 
conventional therapy (ASA + clopidogrel or ticlopidine). The conventional therapy 
(ASA+clopidogrel or ticlopidine) was given per national dosing recommendation. 
Differences regarding the loading dose of the thienopyridine or with respect to the duration of dual 
antiplatelet treatment might have occurred in the study. Currently these issues cannot be 
sufficiently clarified from the information available and more information is needed to exclude a 
relevant impact on study outcome.  
The duration of dual antiplatelet treatment was at the discretion of the investigator and could have 
varied depending on the subject's diagnosis or whether a bare metal stent or drug eluting stent 
was implanted. Thus, upon CHMP request the MAH provided further clarification on the duration of 
dual antiplatelet treatment which in conclusion, did not raise further concern by the CHMP as 
having no impact on the results. 
Subjects were randomly assigned to study drug up to 7 calendar days after the subject had 
beenhospitalized for the index ACS event, when parenteral anticoagulant therapy would normally 
be discontinued. Enrollment was to occur as soon as possible after the initial treatments for the 
index ACS event, including revascularization procedures, but could not occur during the first 24 
hours following hospitalization. 
Subjects returned to the study center every 12 weeks until the global treatment end 
date; the projected date of accrual of approximately 983 primary efficacy endpoint 
events anticipated to be adjudicated as mITT events. The Executive Committee (EC) 
notified sites in advance of the global treatment end date via written communication, 
and study sites scheduled subjects for EOT visits as soon as possible on or after the 
date. Subjects were instructed not to discontinue their study drugs on the global 
treatment end date, but rather at the EOT visit; therefore, some subjects were treated 
with study drug after the global treatment end date. Thirty days after their last dose of 
study drug, subjects were to complete the final end-of-study (EOS) contact (either in 
person or by telephone) to assess efficacy and safety data.  
Subjects who permanently discontinued the study drug before the specified number of primary 
efficacy endpoint events had occurred were to complete an end-of-treatment/early withdrawal visit 
at the time of treatment discontinuation. These subjects were to be contacted 30 days later, and 
continue to be contacted every 12 weeks thereafter until the study ended to assess efficacy and 
safety endpoint data. 
• 
Objectives 
Based on time from randomization to the first occurrence of the primary efficacy endpoint, the 
objective of the primary efficacy analysis was to determine whether rivaroxaban is superior to 
placebo, in addition to standard care, in the reduction of primary efficacy endpoint events in 
subjects with a recent ACS. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary efficacy endpoint in the phase III ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 study was the composite of 
CV death, MI, or stroke. 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013  
Page 28/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The secondary efficacy endpoints were: 
1.  The composite of all-cause death, MI, or stroke 
2.  Net clinical outcome, defined as the composite of CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, or TIMI 
major bleeding event not associated with coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery 
(non-CABG TIMI major bleeding) 
3.  The composite of CV death, MI, stroke, or severe recurrent ischemia requiring 
revascularization (SRIR) 
4.  The composite of CV death, MI, stroke, or severe recurrent ischemia leading to 
hospitalization (SRIH) 
In addition the individual components of the composite primary and major secondary endpoints 
were to be analyzed. 
Safety Evaluations 
The primary safety endpoint in this study was the occurrence of non-CABG TIMI major bleeding 
events. Other safety evaluations included all reported bleeding events, serious adverse events, 
adverse events leading to discontinuation of study drug, adverse events of special interest and 
clinical laboratory tests.  
• 
Sample size 
This was an event-driven study to be stopped when at least 983 adjudicated primary efficacy 
endpoints had accrued across both strata, with at least 728 adjudicated primary efficacy endpoints 
in Stratum 2. The total sample size estimation was based on the predicted number of adjudicated 
events required and the following assumptions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Enrollment projection and placebo event rates (12% at 1 year in Stratum 1; 6% at 1 year in 
Stratum 2) similar to those for the Phase 2 ATLAS ACS TIMI 46 study 
Total enrollment period of approximately 27 months 
Total treatment duration of approximately 33 to 34 months 
Yearly dropout (e.g., withdrawal of consent, lost to follow-up, premature discontinuation of 
study drug) rate of 10% in each treatment group. 
A total of 983 primary efficacy endpoint events were estimated to have approximately 96% power 
to detect a 22.5% relative reduction (i.e., hazard ratio=0.775) between pooled doses of 
rivaroxaban and placebo arms pooled across Stratum 1 and 2, with a 2-sided type I error rate of 
0.05. It was also based on the sum of the events required at approx. 90% power in each stratum, 
to detect a 35% relative reduction in Stratum 1 (255 primary events) and a 22.5% relative 
reduction in Stratum 2 (728 primary events) comparing combined rivaroxaban doses and placebo 
arms within each strata.  
Each individual dose arm, pooled across Stratum 1 and 2, was powered at approx. 90% for an 
overall relative risk reduction of 22.5%, within each individual dose arm, and within each 
individual stratum the study was powered at approx. 80% for the assumed relative risk reduction 
of 35% in Stratum 1 and 22.5% in Stratum 2. 
Originally, approximately 13,570 subjects (2,079 subjects in Stratum 1 and 11,491 subjects in 
Stratum 2) were estimated to be needed to reach the expected number of primary efficacy 
endpoint events and the targeted study power.  The protocol allowed for the sample size to be 
increased to 16,000 subjects if planning assumptions were modified based on a blinded data 
review; since Stratum 1 enrollment was slower than originally projected, the final sample size was 
increased to approximately 15,500.

• 
Randomisation 
Randomization was to occur as soon as possible after the initial treatments or revascularization 
procedures for the index ACS event had been performed, up to 7 days after the hospitalization for 
the index ACS event.  
Randomization was stratified by the intention to use thienopyridine (yes, stratum 2; or no, stratum 
1) as standard care, in addition to low-dose ASA therapy 75 to 100 mg/day. Within each stratum, 
subjects was randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily, 
rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily, or placebo twice daily. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
In addition to the double-blind design, a central Clinical Events Committee (CEC) adjudicated and 
classified all efficacy and primary safety endpoint events while blinded to treatment assignment. 
• 
Statistical methods 
The study was stopped based on the estimated accrual of 983 primary efficacy endpoints 
anticipated to be adjudicated as mITT events. A formal interim review of efficacy and safety data 
was performed when approximately 70% (688) of the required total number (983) of primary 
efficacy events, had occurred, in order to assess whether the study should be stopped for 
overwhelming superiority. However, the study continued unaltered following that analysis. 
Two simultaneous evaluation strategies were selected on the basis of advice from health 
authorities in different regions. The primary strategy was based on data combined across both 
strata. A second evaluation strategy was based on the FDA-recommended approach of combined 
analyses across both dose regimens in subjects in Stratum 2 (ASA+Thienopyridine) only. The use 
of simultaneous evaluation strategies based on the total population and stratum 2 only due to 
different regulatory requirements above described is considered acceptable although it may raise 
concerns regarding multiplicity. 
The statistical methods for efficacy and safety analyses are appropriate. The stratified 
randomization was taken into account in the analysis. 
For the primary endpoint, a closed hierarchical testing procedure was applied, which adequately 
controls the type 1 error for the tests of superiority of the combination of the dose groups and the 
single dose groups. As the hierarchical testing procedure for the secondary endpoints was 
performed independently for the two dose groups using a 0.05 significance level, the family-wise 
type 1 error was not strongly controlled at the 0.05 level. Nevertheless, it is agreed that a strong 
control of type 1 error may not be needed considering the high correlation of primary and 
secondary endpoints. 
The sensitivity analyses are appropriate. However, for the analyses based on the ITT and Total-ITT 
population, it has to be taken into account that information on occurrence of endpoint events for 
the time after discontinuation of study drug was not available for all subjects who discontinued 
study drug prematurely. However, the MAH has collected vital data on patients that discontinued 
the trial prematurely. The results of these analyses are judged to support the conclusions made on 
the basis of the primary efficacy analyses.

The conclusion of consistent treatment effect across subgroups in case of lack of significant 
interaction between treatment group and subgroup variable is not acceptable because the study 
was not powered to show significant interactions. However, the consistency of the treatment effect 
across subgroups can be evaluated based on the hazard ratios that were provided for each of the 
subgroups. 
At the planning stage, stent thrombosis was not considered a formal study endpoint and was only 
to be summarized.  
Study results  
• 
Participant flow  
As the study was event-driven, subjects were exposed to the study drug for varying lengths of 
time, depending on when they were randomized. The median total duration of treatment was 397 
days in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily group. Across all treatment groups, more than 75% of 
subjects were exposed to study drug for ≥6 months, more than half for ≥12 months, and almost 
one-third were exposed for ≥18 months.

Conduct of the study 
The study was initiated in November 2008 and was completed in September 2011. In total 766 
sites in 44 countries worldwide randomized subjects in this study. The majority of subjects were 
white (73.5%). The highest enrolling region was Eastern Europe (6074 [39.1%]), followed by Asia 
(3195 [20.6%]) and Western Europe (2241 [14.4%]); and 874 subjects enrolled in the North 
America region (5.6%) 
A formal interim review of efficacy and safety data was performed when approximately 70% (688) 
of the required total number (983) of primary efficacy events, best available or adjudicated by the 
Clinical Events Committee, had occurred, in order to assess whether the study should be stopped 
for overwhelming superiority. The data cut-off for the interim analysis was November 29, 2010, 
based on 704 total primary efficacy events. The IDMC met on January 12, 2011 to review the 
data. The study continued unaltered following that analysis. 
In summary, the study was well designed and the amendments improved the quality of the study. 
Subjects from 3 sites (i.e, 091001, 091019, and 091026) were excluded from the efficacy 
population due to potential trial misconduct. The MAH has clarified and justified the exclusion of 
these sites in response to the CHMP which was considered to be acceptable. This concerned a 
minor percentage of the total study population (1.2%), equally distributed between treatment 
groups and was also decided prior to the unblinding of the study.  
• 
Baseline data  
The majority of all randomized subjects had CV risk factors, such as hypertension (67.4%), 
diabetes mellitus (32.0%) or history of MI (26.9%). There were 60.5% subjects who had a 
revascularization procedure for the index event; the vast majority of these procedures were 
percutaneous coronary intervention, PCI (99.3%).  
A relatively low proportion of the subjects were women (25.3%), and only a few were elderly 
(36.5% of patients were older than 65 years old, and 9.0% of patients were older than 75 years 
old). Mean age was 61.8 years. Approximately 74 % of the subjects were white, and 0.7% of the 
patients were black or African-American.

Table E5 Prior Medications of Interest 
The most common medication used prior to randomization was ASA (15,312 [98.6%]). The vast 
majority (14181 [98.0%]) of subjects in Stratum 2 were receiving a thienopyridine prior to 
randomization compared with only 232 (22.0%) of 1,053 randomized subjects in Stratum 1. 
There were no important imbalances or relevant asymmetries in characteristics across treatment 
groups and strata in baseline demographic or disease characteristics at time of randomisation. 
However, as a high discontinuation rate was observed demographic and disease characteristics 
were reanalysed in the patients that discontinued and compared with the overall study population. 
It was found that the characteristics of the patients that discontinued were more similar to the 
patients that survived than to those that died.

Numbers analysed 
Of the 15,526 subjects randomized in the study, 15,342 (98.8%) subjects (5,114 in the 2.5 mg 
b.i.d. group, 5,115 in the 5 mg b.i.d. group, and 5,113 in the placebo group) were included in the 
efficacy population, and 15,350 (98.9%) subjects (5,115 in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group, 5,110 in the 5 
mg b.i.d. group, and 5,125 in the placebo group) received at least 1 dose of study drug and were 
included in the safety population.

Table E7 : Primary Reasons for Premature Discontinuation From Double-Blind Treatment 
Period  (Study RIVAROXACS3001: Safety Analysis Set) 
In summary, the efficacy population included all randomized subjects except subjects randomised 
at one of three sites excluded due to potential study misconduct. They were however included in 
the Safety population. Overall it was about 1% in each of the treatment groups that never started 
treatment with study drug.  Regarding the different analysis populations used for efficacy they 
differed only in the censoring rules for determining evaluable efficacy and safety events 
respectively, i.e. the number of subjects in each of the mITT, ITT and ITT-Total population 
respectively was 5114, 5115, and 5113 in the 2.5 mg BID, 5 mg BID and the placebo group

respectively. The only exception was for the per protocol population used in one sensitivity 
analysis of the primary efficacy endpoint.

Figure E4 : Effect of Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg BID Compared with Placebo on the Primary Efficacy 
Endpoint (First Occurrence of Cardiovascular Death, MI, Stroke) in All Strata (Study 
RIVAROXACS3001) 
The sensitivity analyses supported the conclusions in the primary analysis. Due to the overall low 
incidence rates different censoring rules lead to that although more events were included in the 
analyses, the number of additional events were low and seems also to have been similar in each of 
the treatment group (2.5 mg vs. placebo). This lead to that there was almost no or only small 
differences between the analyses based on the different analysis sets, including the PP analysis. 
The latter probably due also to how the censoring rules was defined in the primary mITT analysis 
(censoring data or events occurring 30 days following treatment discontinuation and 30 days after 
randomization for those subjects who were randomized but not treated).

Hierarchical Testing – Event rate, Hazard Ratio and 95% Confidence Interval for Time to 
the First Occurrence of Efficacy Endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint events (composite of CV death, MI or stroke) 
In All Strata, the effect of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d. on the primary efficacy endpoint was largely 
driven by the reduction in CV deaths (HR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.86), including a numerical 
reduction in fatal MIs. The result in the 5 mg b.id group was primarily driven by a reduction in MIs, 
even though a small numerical reduction in CV deaths was observed in this group.

The described numerical inconsistencies between the two dose groups for the components of the 
composite efficacy endpoint have been extensively discussed in the responses to the CHMP LoQ:s. 
One explanation for the inconsistency observed provided by the MAH is that patients in the 5 mg 
bid dose group had more bleedings putting them at increased risk also for ischemic events. There 
is also some external support for such an association from other trials within this area  
Further, for All Strata, the combined rivaroxaban doses were superior to placebo, in addition to 
standard care, in reducing the occurrence rate of primary efficacy endpoint events (i.e., composite 
of CV death, MI or stroke) in subjects with a recent ACS in the mITT analysis set (HR: 0.84, 95% 
CI: 0.74, 0.96; p=0.008).  
Within Stratum 1 (ASA only) there was no statistically significant difference between any of the 
rivaroxaban dose groups vs. placebo. The relatively small number of patients on ASA only also 
precludes any firm conclusions on the efficacy to be expected in this subgroup, however, the 
overall trend for the composite primary endpoint was consistent with the overall results. 
No reduction of the stroke incidence was seen and the differences for the other components of the 
primary endpoint was somewhat inconsistent between dose groups and strata as discussed further 
below. 
As the high discontinuation rate with slightly imbalances between the groups was observed, a bias 
from risk differences between the treatment arms might have had an impact on the study 
outcome. Therefore, the MAH has provided comparisons of demographic and disease 
characteristics at time of randomisation and in those subjects included in the efficacy analysis.  
The MAH, upon CHMP request, has performed extensive analyses on the patients that discontinued 
early  and  has  also  made  efforts  to  retrieve  vital  data  for  these  patients  and  in  conclusion,  the 
results supported the primary efficacy analysis. 
Cardiovascular deaths 
In all Strata, the combined rivaroxaban doses were superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of 
CV deaths (HR: 0.80, 95% CI: 0.65, 0.99; nominal p value=0.038). The incidence of CV death 
was 1.8% in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group and 2.6% in the 5 mg b.i.d. group, compared with 2.8% in 
the placebo group. Rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d. was superior to placebo in reducing CV deaths (HR: 
0.66, 95%CI: 0.51, 0.86; nominal p value=0.002); the incidence of CV deaths in the rivaroxaban 
5 mg b.i.d. group was not significantly different compared with placebo (HR: 0.94, 95%CI 0.75, 
1.20). 
In Stratum 2, the results were consistent with those seen in All Strata. The combined rivaroxaban 
doses were superior to placebo in reducing the incidence of CV deaths (HR: 0.78, 95% CI: 0.63, 
0.97; nominal p value=0.028). Notably, the largest reduction in CV deaths compared with placebo 
was observed in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group (HR: 0.62, 95% CI: 0.47, 0.82; nominal p 
value=<0.001), while the incidence of CV deaths in the 5 mg b.i.d. and placebo groups were not 
significantly different (HR: 0.95, 95% CI 0.74, 1.21). 
In All Strata, death due to MI in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group was similar to that of placebo group (18 
[0.4%] versus 23 [0.4%]) and was numerically higher in the 5 mg b.i.d. group (30 [0.6%]). 
CHF/cardiogenic shock as cause of death was lowest in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group (8 [0.2%]), 
followed the placebo group (17 [0.3%]), and highest in the 5 mg b.i.d. group (19 [0.4%]).  
The reduction in death observed in the 2.5 mg twice daily group was due to a reduction in sudden 
or un witnessed deaths and deaths due to congestive heart failure/ cardiogenic shock. In the 5 mg 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013  
Page 40/75 
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
twice daily group, no reduction was seen on death due to heart failure/ cardiogenic shock, and 
there was a higher number observed in the deaths due to MI and non-intracranial hemorrhagic 
deaths compared with placebo. 
Bleeding-related causes of death, whether due to intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) or not, were 
balanced between the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group and placebo; however, extracranial hemorrhage as 
cause of death was numerically higher in the 5 mg b.i.d. group than that in placebo group (5/5115 
versus 1/5113).  
In conclusion, the 2.5 mg b.i.d dose showed a reduction in CV death, which was not shown with 
the 5 mg b.i.d dose.  
The somewhat higher frequency in death due to CHF/cardiogenic shock, MI, and 
extracranial haemorrhage in the 5 mg b.i.d. group may have contributed to the 
diminished effect of the 5 mg b.i.d. dose on reducing CV death. In stratum 2 
(ASA+Thienopyridine), there is a slight tendency to a higher number of deaths due to 
infection in the 5 mg group (0.2%)  than in the 2.5 mg group (<0.1%) and the placebo 
group (<0.1%). The MAH has reviewed all available safety data on infection rates in 
clinical studies and the incidence rates of treatment-emergent adverse events in the 
System Organ Class Infections and Infestations were overall comparable between the 
rivaroxaban and the control group. In conclusion, there is no clear signal for increased 
infection rates.  
Table E11 : Summary of Cardiovascular Deaths by Primary Cause  
Myocardial infarctions 
In all Strata, 29 of the 179 (16.2%) subjects with MIs in the 5 mg b.i.d. group had a fatal outcome 
as reported by the investigators, compared to 16 of the 205 (7.8%) subjects with MIs in the 2.5 
mg b.i.d. group and 18 of 229 (7.9%) in the placebo group. Similarly, in Stratum 2, 27 of the 169 
(15.9%) subjects with MIs in the 5 mg b.i.d. group had a fatal outcome as reported by the 
investigators, compared to 15 of the 189 (7.9%) subjects with MIs in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group and 
18 of 207 (8.7%) in the placebo group.  
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013  
Page 41/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A greater reduction in the incidence of MIs was observed with rivaroxaban 5 mg b.i.d. compared 
with the 2.5 mg b.i.d. dose; however, a numerically higher percentage of MIs in the 5 mg b.i.d. 
group were fatal. 
It is striking that the frequency of MI with fatal outcome is approximately doubled when doubling 
the dose. However, the numbers are small and it is agreed with the MAH that these may have 
been due to chance. 
Stroke 
In All Strata and Stratum 2, subjects in rivaroxaban treatment groups had numerically more 
strokes than the placebo group. The incidence of stroke in All Strata was 0.9% in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. 
group and 1.1% in the 5 mg b.i.d. group, compared with 0.8% in the placebo group. 
In Stratum 2, the results were similar to All Strata, with the lowest incidence occurring in the 
placebo group. The incidence of stroke was 0.9% in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group and 1.0% in the 5 mg 
b.i.d. group, compared with 0.7% in the placebo group. 
Interestingly, subjects in Stratum 1 treated with rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d had numerically fewer 
strokes (0.6% in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group and 2.3% in the 5 mg b.i.d. group) compared with 
subjects in the placebo group (2.0%). However, the number of stroke events was small in both 
groups. 
Secondary Efficacy endpoint Events 1 (composite of all-cause death, MI or stroke) 
The secondary efficacy endpoint 1 events consisted of the composite of all-cause death, MI and 
stroke. For All Strata, both the 2.5 mg b.i.d. and the 5 mg b.i.d. doses of rivaroxaban were 
individually superior to placebo, in addition to standard care, in reducing the occurrence of 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 1 events (i.e., composite of all-cause death, MI or stroke). 
In stratum 2, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg was superior to placebo in reducing the occurrence of Secondary 
Efficacy Endpoint 1 events. This was driven by a statistically significant reduction in all-cause 
mortality. Since rivaroxaban 5 mg b.i.d was not significantly different compared with placebo in 
the primary efficacy analysis, it was not formally tested in the secondary endpoint analyses. 
However, in stratum 2 (ASA+Thienopyridine), there is a tendency to a higher number of deaths 
due to infection in the 5 mg group (0.2%)  than in the 2.5 mg group (<0.1%) and the placebo 
group (<0.1%).

Table E12 : Summary of All Cause Deaths by Primary Cause (Stratum 2) (safety analysis set) 
Secondary Efficacy endpoint Events 2 (composite of CV death, MI, ischemic stroke, or non-CABG 
TIMI major bleeding) = Net clinical outcome 
For the net clinical outcome (the Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 2, defined as the composite of CV 
death, MI, ischemic stroke, or non-CABG TIMI major bleeding) neither the combined doses, the 
2.5 mg b.i.d. nor the 5 mg b.i.d. dose of rivaroxaban significantly decreased the occurrence of 
events ( in All Strata and Stratum 2) compared with placebo. The rate of non-CABG TIMI major 
bleeding was nominally significantly increased in all rivaroxaban groups (combined rivaroxaban: 
HR: 3.40, 95%CI: 2.19, 5.26; p<0.001; 2.5 mg b.i.d.: HR: 2.99, 95%CI: 1.86, 4.80; p<0.001; 5 
mg b.i.d.: HR: 3.81, 95%CI: 2.40, 6.04; p<0.001). 
As a result, the hierarchical testing for the rest of the secondary endpoints in All Strata was 
stopped.

Table E13 Effect of Rivaroxaban Compared With Placebo on Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The additional secondary efficacy endpoints are the composite of CV death, MI, stroke, or severe 
recurrent ischemia requiring revascularization (SRIR) (Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 3) and the 
composite of CV death, MI, stroke, or severe recurrent ischemia leading to hospitalization (SRIH) 
(Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 4). Overall, rivaroxaban treatment did not reduce the occurrence of 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 3 events, but rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d. reduced the occurrence of  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoint 4 events compared with placebo, both in All Strata (HR: 0.84, 95% 
CI: 0.73, 0.96) and in Stratum 2 (HR: 0.85, 95% CI: 0.73, 0.98). 
According to the pre-specified hierarchical testing strategy, if an individual test during any step 
was not statistically significant, further testing could continue but significance could not be 
claimed.  
Assessment report

Due to the end of the pre-specified formal statistical testing on the secondary efficacy endpoints 3 
and 4 according the SAP, it is not possible to draw further conclusion with respect to the results 
regarding these endpoints. Although the significant result for the 2.5 mg group (p<0.011, HR 
0.85, 95%CI: 073, 0,98) is noted. 
Stent thrombosis 
For all CV deaths and cardiac ischemic events requiring adjudication, the possibility of stent 
thrombosis was assessed by ARC (Academic Research Consortium) definitions. In All Strata, 61 
(1.2%) subjects in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d. group and 61 subjects (1.2%) in the 5 mg b.i.d. 
group had stent thrombosis defined as “definite”, “probable” or “possible” by ARC definitions, 
compared to 87 (1.7%) subjects in the placebo group. In Stratum 2, a similar reduction in stent 
thrombosis was observed in the rivaroxaban treatment groups compared with placebo. In the ITT-
Total analysis set, the incidence of stent thrombosis observed in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group (58 
[1.2%]) was significantly lower than that observed with placebo (85 [1.8%]) (HR: 0.68, 95% CI: 
0.49, 0.95). Similarly, in the 5 mg b.i.d. group, 60 (1.3%) subjects had stent thrombosis 
compared to 85 (1.8%) subjects in the placebo group (HR: 0.71, 95% CI: 0.51, 0.99).  
Regarding the analyses of the occurrence of stent thrombosis the comparisons between 
rivaroxaban and placebo were post-hoc. It is agreed that nominally statistically significant 
difference have been showed. It is however not clear on what grounds it was decided not only to 
summarize this outcome but also to perform analyses comparing the rivaroxaban dose groups with 
the placebo group. These analyses were no part of the hierarchical testing procedure and hence, 
nor the initially planned confirmatory strategy. Formally this may be a false positive finding, and, 
strictly, no claims should be made as a part of the indication. 
Clinical studies in special populations 
There was no significant interaction in the primary efficacy endpoint results by region; subjects 
across all regions benefitted from treatment with rivaroxaban compared with placebo. The benefit 
of rivaroxaban was also consistently demonstrated irrespective of whether subjects had STEMI, 
NSTEMI or unstable angina as their index event. For further information, please see the clinical 
assessment report. 
In the Follow-Up Scientific Advice dated 26 June 2008, it was also pointed out that standard 
treatment in ACS patients is very different depending if the patients are candidates for reperfusion 
therapy or not (fibrinolysis or a catheter-based treatment). It was also pointed out, that subgroup 
analysis should be performed based on the use of fibrinolytic, IIb-IIIa antagonist. Such analyses 
have been provided and the differences between the treatment groups are consistent with the 
overall efficacy findings.  
From a biostatistical point of view, the conclusion of consistent treatment effect across subgroups 
in case of lack of significant treatment by subgroup interaction is not acceptable, because the 
study was not powered to show significant interactions. However, the consistency can be 
evaluated descriptively based on the provided hazard ratios for the subgroups.  
Supportive study 
No supportive study in addition to the ATLAS ACS TIMI 46 study has been provided.

2.5.3. Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The design and the size of the clinical programme are judged to be largely adequate for an 
assessment of the efficacy to be expected in ACS patients at high risk for future cardiovascular 
events. The studies have been well performed. The included population, concomitant medication 
and background therapy seems to be essentially representative for a European ACS population 
although a somewhat low proportion of women (25%) is noted. However, the results in the 
subgroup of women was consistent with the overall results.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
From an efficacy perspective the choice of doses to be brought forward was not easily defined 
based on the dose-finding study. Actually, there was no indication of a reduction of the primary 
composite endpoint (all-cause death, MI, stroke, or severe recurrent ischemia) in stratum II 
(patients on a combination of ASA and thienopyridin) which can be regarded as the most relevant 
stratum in the current clinical setting. Of primary importance for dose selection were obviously the 
safety outcomes that seem to have formed the basis for the final decision of what doses to take 
forward to the phase III study. 
Considering the efficacy results of all dose groups in the dose finding study twice daily dosing had 
a slightly larger reduction as compared to placebo than od dosing, the choice of the twice daily 
dosing appears reasonable, but is inconsistent with the approved dosing regimens for other 
indications. However, in light of the available clinical evidence, these differences in dosing intervals 
for the different indications can be accepted. 
In the pivotal three-arm study, rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid and 5 mg bid was compared to placebo in 
addition to standard care in patients with ACS after the initial treatment. The included population 
represents a population where treatment for cardiovascular disease was frequent already at 
baseline. In addition patients under the age of 55 were required to have diabetes or hypertension 
to be included.  
Overall high rate of subjects who discontinued prematurely was observed. Premature 
discontinuation was more often observed in the rivaroxaban groups (all strata) than in the placebo 
group [28.2 % (n=2880/10225) for the combined riovaroxaban versus (26.4 % (n=1351/5125)].  
The composite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke was 
reduced in the 2.5 mg bid group in the over-all population with event rates/100 patient-years of 
7.04 vs. 5.92 (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72; 0.97, p=0.020) in the rivaroxaban and placebo groups 
respectively approximately corresponding to an absolute reduction of one percent events/year. 
The results were driven by stratum II (ASA and thienopyridin) as the proportion of patients in 
stratum 1 (only ASA for platelet inhibition) was small (6.8%), but where a consistent trend was 
observed.  
In the 5 mg bid dose group a similar reduction was seen with event rates/100 patient-years of 
7.04 vs 6.03 (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.73, 0.98, p=0.028). Also these results were driven by stratum 
II.  
The hazard ratios for stratum I were consistent with the overall results in both dose groups and 
actually numerically somewhat lower than in stratum II but as the proportion of patients treated 
with ASA only was small no firm conclusions can be drawn. It could, however, be speculated based 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013  
Page 46/75 
 
 
 
 
 
on the phase II and III study results that the additional benefit is larger if rivaroxaban is added to 
less intensive platelet  inhibition. 
In summary, the outcome with regard to the components of the primary efficacy end-point was 
inconsistent. 
In All Strata, the effect of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d. on the primary efficacy endpoint was largely 
driven by the reduction in CV deaths, including a reduction in fatal MIs. A numerical non-significant 
reduction in MIs reduction was noted in that dose group as compared to placebo, but no reduction 
of strokes was seen. Rather, a small numerical increase of strokes was observed. 
In the 5 mg bid dose group no significant reduction of CV deaths in comparison with placebo was 
seen but rather a weak numerical trend. In this dose group the significant results were driven by a 
significant reduction of MIs. However, in All Strata as well as in Stratum 2, a higher percentage of 
MIs in the 5 mg b.i.d. group were fatal compared to the 2.5 mg b.i.d group and the placebo group.  
All-cause deaths in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group was reduced in consistency with the reduction of CV 
deaths (HR: 0.68, 95%CI: 0.53, 0.87, p=0.002). In the 5 mg bid group no such reduction was 
seen (HR 0.95; 0.76,1.19, p=0.662. 
It is also noteworthy that the pre-defined net clinical outcome endpoint (Secondary Efficacy 
Endpoint 2 where primary efficacy results were balanced with TIMI major bleedings) did not 
improve with rivaroxaban treatment. 
The most important finding in support for the proposed 2.5 mg bid rivaroxaban regimen is the 
reduction of all-cause deaths. The numerically inconsistency between the two dose groups with 
regard to the components of the composite primary endpoint has been extensively discussed and 
it is recognized that the trends observed are consistent. The MAH has also brought forward the 
explanation that the increased bleeding tendency in the 5 mg b.i.d dose group could partially 
explain the apparently less pronounced effect on mortality as compared with the 2.5 mg b.i.d. 
group. It is accepted that this explanation provided some external support. (see further discussion 
in the report).  
Additional Expert consultation 
Before reaching its final opinion, the CHMP asked the view of the Cardiovascular Scientific Advisory 
group (CV-SAG) in order to further discuss the benefit/risk in the targeted indication. The outcome 
of the CV-SAG consultation is mentioned below: 
1.  Is the benefit shown for 2.5 mg rivaroxaban in the ATLAS studies regarding the 
composite primary endpoint (cardiovascular deaths, myocardial infarction or stroke) 
clinically relevant and large enough to balance the increase in bleedings observed in 
the pivotal study? 
The SAG was of the view that the benefit of 2.5 mg bid rivaroxaban with reference to the 
composite primary endpoint was relevant and sizable, and in the enrolled population outweighed 
the occurrence of clinically relevant bleedings. Nevertheless, as the enrolled population is not fully 
representative of the general European population of Patients with ACS and the bleeding risk of 
enrolled patients was not high, the real net benefit of its widespread use in the ACS population 
cannot be predicted based on the available data. In particular the patients in the trial were 
relatively young, with little co-morbidity when compared with other studies and European 
registries. In this regard, some specific points were raised and emphasised by the SAG: 
a/   In Europe, the use of PCI is extensive. However, in ATLAS TIMI 51 only approximately 
60% of the Patients underwent early PCI, and the absolute risk reduction with reference to 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013  
Page 47/75 
 
 
 
 
 
the primary endpoint was low in the subgroup of patients having undergone baseline PCI 
and consequently the benefit/risk balance remains questionable in these patients that have 
high a risk of bleeding. 
b/   ATLAS TIMI 51 investigated only the association of rivaroxaban and either clopidogrel or 
ticlopidine. However, the benefit/risk profile of its association with newer anti-platelet 
agents Ticagrelor and Prasugrel has not been investigated and co-administration should 
therefore be avoided since it could possibly be harmful. 
c/   In the currently proposed indication, rivaroxaban should not be used in patients with a 
platelet count of less than 90,000/μL, anaemia (i.e. haemoglobin level of less than 10 
g/dL), a creatinine clearance of less than 30 mL/minute, clinically significant 
gastrointestinal bleeding within 12 months, or in patients with previous intracranial 
haemorrhage, stroke or transient ischaemic attack while already on aspirin and 
thienopyridines, since a positive benefit/risk profile in these conditions has not been 
demonstrated. 
2.  Is the increased bleeding risk, as reported in the ATLAS studies, manageable in daily 
practice where often patients with a relative high bleeding risk are being treated, in 
particular elderly patients and patients with comorbidities such as renal dysfunction? 
The SAG was of the view that in ATLAS TIMI 51 bleeding risk was manageable although quite 
substantial (TIMI bleeding requiring medical attention: 12.9% in the 2.5 mg bid group vs. 7.5% in 
the placebo group). Further, the experts agreed that the management of bleedings should be 
possible also in a similar population in real clinical practice. However, concerning patients at higher 
risk of bleeding, with multiple complex co-morbidities (in particular renal dysfunction) and elderly 
patients, as these groups were underrepresented in the pivotal study, no information on the 
impact and management of bleeding can be derived from this study.  
3.  Is there a subset of ACS patients, where long term rivaroxaban in addition to aspirin 
and clopidogrel can be recommended in particular taking into account literature data 
(including data with other oral anticoagulants), clinical experience, results of the 
pivotal study and the MAH proposal for a target population? 
Based on the data obtained with rivaroxaban in the ATLAS TIMI 51 study, the SAG members 
agreed that it is not possible to clearly define a subset of ACS patients that would benefit more 
from long-term rivaroxaban treatment in addition to aspirin and/or clopidogrel/ticlopidine. The 
decision for treatment has to be taken on an individual basis taking into account the absolute 
thrombotic risk and the specific bleeding risk of the individual patient.  
Further, the SAG members were of the view that the use of markers of myocardial necrosis should 
be further validated by prospective evaluation before introduction as a guide for rivaroxaban 
treatment in ACS patients as proposed by the MAH. 
CHMP discussion following the SAG consultation 
The CHMP considered that a significant reduction of the primary composite endpoint events being 
consistent in the two dose groups had been demonstrated. A highly relevant reduction of CV-
mortality and total mortality in the 2.5 mg bid dose group, corresponding to the dose 
recommended for approval. 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013  
Page 48/75 
 
 
 
 
 
With regards to bleeding complications, they are considered manageable in the vast majority of 
patients, although it is recognised that the patients included in the ATLAS TIMI51 study 
represented a group with lower risk of bleeding to what is anticipated in the daily practice.  
Thus the representativeness of the study population of the EU population was extensively 
discussed given the low risk patients included in this study and the risk of bleeding anticipated to 
be higher when considering daily practice, older patients with more comorbidities. 
It was however recognised that patients included in clinical trials are selected patients with lower 
risk and the ALTAS TIMI51 study in this respect could be considered comparable with other recent 
clinical studies in this population with acute coronary syndrome. 
The external support for the efficacy of anticoagulant treatment in this population (support also 
when added to dual antiplatelet therapy) was discussed and several views considered.  
Taking into account the APPRAISE1 dose finding study performed on apixaban and although 
limited data are available at present, it is considered that the concept to add a low dose of an 
anticoagulant to the antiplatelet therapy appears attractive in a selected group of patients and can 
be justified also from what is known of the pathogenetic mechanisms. The MAH provided also 
further clarification during the Oral Explanation regarding possible external support from other 
studies in term of population studied which helped to reinforced the issue related to external 
validity raised by the CHMP.  
The problem has always been with regards to bleeding risks and it is noted that a clearly higher 
dose was used in the apixaban phase III study equivalent to the dose given in AF, bleeding 
outweighed the beneficial effects. 
For rivaroxaban, two lower 2 doses were compared with placebo in a double blind manner and the 
dose proposed (2.5 bid) represents only one quarter of the dose approved in atrial fibrillation. It is 
also considered by the CHMP that the twice daily regimen is probably an additional advantage with 
the proposed regimen taking the PK characteristics into account. 
As shown below, it is recognised that the results for the patients that underwent PCI were less 
impressive in absolute terms which has been discussed in the responses to the CHMP questions. 
However, the relative reduction in CV-mortality and all-cause mortality in this subgroup was 
consistent with the overall results.   
For patients who underwent PCI and had elevated cardiac biomarkers who underwent PCI and had 
elevated cardiac biomarkers showed a nominally statistically significant reduction of CV death (HR 
0.57; 95% CI: 0.34, 0.94; p = 0.027) and stent thrombosis (HR 0.64; 95% CI: 0.42, 0.96; p = 
0.028) compared with reduction of CV death (HR 0.54; 95% CI: 0.33, 0.89; p = 0.013) and stent 
thrombosis (HR 0.64; 95% CI: 0.43, 0.95; p = 0.026) in the overall population.

In summary, the proportion of patients treated with ASA only (stratum 1) was small, thus no firm 
conclusions can be drawn for that stratum. It could, however, be speculated based on the hazard 
ratios observed in the phase II and III study results that the additional benefit is larger if 
rivaroxaban is added to less intensive platelet inhibition. Therefore, the CHMP considered 
reasonable and acceptable to include ACS patients treated with ASA only in the target population. 
Considering the CV-SAG concerns raised related to the ad hoc retrospective analysis of elevated 
cardiac biomarkers and the recommendation for the proposed indication, the CHMP considering the 
published results with cardiac biomarkers and its use in practice was nevertheless further 
reassured and agreed with the MAH revised proposal for the use in the prevention of 
atherothrombotic events in adult patients after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated 
cardiac biomarkers.

It is also emphasised that other platelet function inhibitors have been approved recently in ACS 
patients, e.g. ticagrelor that has an approved indication similar to the one now requested for 
rivaroxaban. Nothing can be said about the effects of adding rivaroxaban to such treatment. 
2.5.4. Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The reduction in the composite primary endpoint is judged to be sufficiently well demonstrated 
with consistent results in the two dose groups. The reduction of CV mortality and all cause 
mortality has been demonstrated in the 2.5 mg dose group which is the dose proposed for 
approval. The less impressive reduction of mortality in the 5 mg dose group could partly be 
explained by the higher bleeding rate in that dose group and it could partly be a chance finding in 
light of the overall results.  
In summary the overall results appear sufficiently convincing in the targeted subgroup of patients 
after an acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers (post hoc analysis). 
Summary of main study (study 13194) 
The following tables summarise the efficacy results from the main studies supporting the present 
application. These summaries should be read in conjunction with the discussion on clinical 
efficacy as well as the benefit risk assessment (see later sections).

Study 
identifier 
RIVAROXACS3001 (BAY59-7939/13194) 
EudraCT Number: 2008-002708-25 
Design 
Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, event-driven, multicenter study  
The study was conducted in 3 phases: a 6-day screening phase, a double-blind treatment phase, and a follow up 
phase. 
Two oral doses of rivaroxaban (2.5 mg twice daily and 5 mg twice daily) were studied in comparison with placebo 
twice daily (on top of ASA alone or ASA plus a thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine)). Randomization was 
stratified by the intention to use thienopyridine (yes [Stratum 2] or no [Stratum 1]) as standard care, in addition to 
low-dose aspirin/acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) therapy (75 to 100 mg/day). 
Within each stratum, subjects were randomly assigned in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive rivaroxaban 2.5 mg twice daily, 
rivaroxaban 5 mg twice daily or placebo twice daily. 
Duration of main phase: 
Event driven; 
Across all treatment groups, more than 75% of subjects were 
exposed to study drug for ≥6 months, more than half for ≥12 
months, and almost one-third were exposed for ≥18 months; 
The median time on treatment was 13 months and overall treatment 
duration was up to 31 month.

Patient exposure 
Overall exposure in ACS patients 
The total rivaroxaban treated safety population in support of the ACS indication consisted of 
15,350 subjects.  
In the dose finding ATLAS ACS TIMI 46 a total of 3,491 subjects were randomized and received at 
least 1 dose of study drug. The mean treatment duration was 167 days and 158 days in the 
rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d. and 5 mg b.i.d. groups, respectively, and 164 days for the placebo 
group.  
A total of 15,526 subjects were randomized in the pivotal ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 study. The mean 
total duration of treatment for All Strata combined, was 396 days and 386 days in the rivaroxaban 
2.5 mg b.i.d. and 5 mg b.i.d. groups, respectively, and 400 days in the placebo group. 
In the pivotal ATLAS ACS 2 TIMI 51 study the time of exposure was as follows:

Adverse events 
The primary safety endpoint in the Phase II Clinical ATLAS ACS TIMI 46 was the incidence bleeding 
events that were classified according to the TIMI scale as major, minor, or bleeding requiring 
medical attention  
The overall bleeding rates in this study is summarised under the dose finding discussion above. 
The incidence rates of non-bleeding adverse events in the phase II study, including treatment-
emergent adverse events/SAEs, adverse events and serious adverse events with an onset greater 
than 2 days after discontinuation of study drug had similar patterns across treatment groups and 
strata. 
In the pivotal phase III study 13194 safety was assessed by evaluation of adverse events, 
bleeding events, clinical laboratory tests including liver-related laboratory tests, 
electrocardiograms, vital signs, and physical examinations. Serious adverse events, adverse 
events leading to discontinuation of study drug, and adverse events of special interest were 
recorded in the case report form (CRF) and followed by the investigator throughout the study; 
other non serious adverse events were not routinely recorded in the CRF. 
Adverse events of special interest were defined in the protocol as: 
•  Any bleeding event that did not meet the criteria for a serious adverse event.  
•  Any liver-related adverse event, including ALT >3 times the ULN (and normal baseline) with 
confirmation by retesting (within 5 days) 
•  Any event that occurred within 30 days before a permanent discontinuation. 
Three bleeding event scales were used. The TIMI scale was the primary bleeding scale for this 
study with categories of major, minor, requiring medical attention, and insignificant bleeding 
events. Two additional bleeding scales were used to provide additional information on bleeding. 
The ISTH major bleeding event classification has categories of major bleeding events, clinically 
relevant non-major bleeding events, and minimal bleeding events. Bleeding events associated with 
CABG were adjudicated independently with the TIMI, ISTH, or GUSTO scales in order to allow for 
more sensitive bleeding assessments since CABG surgery is associated with excessive transfused 
blood volume. For detailed definitions, see the clinical AR. 
Hepatic Events 
•  Hepatic events meeting any of the selection criteria listed below were assessed by the Hepatic 
Event Assessment Committee (HEAC): 
•  Any ALT > 8xULN (includes symptomatic and asymptomatic cases) 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013  
Page 56/75 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  All deaths with ALT >3x ULN within 30 days of death 
•  Combined ALT >3xULN with Total bilirubin >2x ULN 
•  Concurrent elevations (concurrent refers to laboratory analyses drawn from the same sample) 
•  Non-concurrent elevations if the ALT elevation is followed by a Total bilirubin elevation within 
30 days, 
•  Other (includes cases of possible concern not meeting any of the 3 categories listed above). 
Visits occurred at screening, baseline, Weeks 4, 12, and then every 12 weeks thereafter for the 
duration of the double-blind treatment period until the specified number of primary efficacy 
endpoint events had been reached. 
The overall incidences of treatment-emergent adverse events are given in the table below. With 
the exception of bleedings there were no differences in treatment emergent adverse events 
between the three groups.

Table S2. Treatment emergent adverse events in at least 1% of subjects in study 3001 
A higher incidence of discontinuation due to bleedings, primarily mucosal bleedings, was observed 
in the rivaroxaban groups.

Table S3 Treatment-emergent adverse events in study 3001 resulting in permanent discontinuation 
of study drug in at least 0.25% of subjects in any treatment group in the safety analysis set 
The primary safety endpoint, bleedings according to the TIMI scale, are given in the table below. 
As expected a dose response relationship with regard to all bleeding categories is observed. The 
hazard ratios for bleedings in comparison with placebo were higher for stratum 2 than for stratum 
1 which could be due to more intense platelet function inhibition. Analyses of bleeding rates 
according to the two additional bleeding scales that were used gave similar results.

The hepatic laboratory and clinical adverse events were carefully recorded and in line with the 
clinical studies in other indications no increased risk could be found among the rivaroxaban treated 
patients. 
Liver-Related Laboratory Values 
In All Strata, ALT, AST and total bilirubin post baseline and treatment emergent values >3x ULN 
were balanced across the 2.5 mg b.i.d. and 5 mg b.i.d. rivaroxaban and placebo groups (post 
baseline ALT: >3x ULN combined rivaroxaban 136 [1.4%], placebo 73 [1.5%]; treatment 
emergent ALT >3x ULN: combined rivaroxaban 92 [1.1%], placebo 49 [1.1%]). Balance between 
treatment groups was also seen at higher ALT levels of >5x, 8x, 10x and 20x ULN. 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013 
Page 62/75 
 
  
  
 
 
Based on central laboratory data, means and mean changes from baseline over time for ALT AST, 
Total (Direct, Indirect) Bilirubin and Alkaline Phosphatase were similar across the treatment 
groups. 
Hepatic Disorder Serious Adverse Events 
There were no liver-related deaths considered to be associated with study drug observed in this 
study. 
The incidence of hepatic disorder treatment emergent serious adverse events was 0.8% (combined 
rivaroxaban 83/10225, placebo 40/5125) in both the combined rivaroxaban and placebo treatment 
groups. 
A total of 92 liver events in 90 subjects were identified and sent for HEAC review.  
There were no cases with a majority probable causality assessment based on the composite 
criteria causality assessment by the HEAC. 
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation 
Overall there were no noteworthy changes in clinical laboratory test results between any of the 
rivaroxaban dose groups or placebo. Creatinine, haemoglobin, WBC, platelet numbers, alkaline 
phosphatises were followed in the majority of patients.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Treatment-emergent serious adverse events occurred at similar rates in the three treatment 
groups, see table below.

2.6.1. Discussion on clinical safety 
In terms of number of patients the exposure of rivaroxaban in the proposed indication is 
considered sufficient for a qualified assessment of the safety characteristics of the proposed 
regimen. The incidences of non-bleeding adverse events were similar in the rivaroxaban groups as 
compared to placebo and there were no signals for an increased incidence of non-bleeding hepatic, 
renal, laboratory adverse events which is in line with earlier experience in other indications. The 
primary safety end-point, TIMI major bleeding was higher in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid group as 
compared to placebo with a hazard ratio of 3.46 (95% CI; 2.1, 5.8) corresponding to an absolute 
rate of 1.3% compared with 0.4% or approximately an increase of 1%. The corresponding figures 
for the 5 mg bid dose group was an HR of 4.47 (95% CI; 2.7, 7.4) or approximately an increase of 
1.2% from 0.4 % to 1.6%. Increased bleeding rates in the acute clinical setting have been shown 
to have major impact on the long-term risk for cardiovascular complications in ACS patients. 
However, the data provided by the MAH demonstrate that the benefit obtained seem to persist 
over time during the follow up. Fatal bleeding events or total mortality was not increased in the 
2.5 mg group as compared with placebo during the study observation period.  
It is highlighted that clinically relevant haemorrhage at critical sites including intracranial bleedings 
with potential long-term consequences of long-term functional incapacity is of concern but it is 
considered to be adequately addressed in the SmPC (section 4.4).  However, the bleeding pattern 
is consistent with what has been shown for rivaroxaban in other indications with a large proportion 
of mucosal bleedings.

In summary, the long-term cardiovascular consequences of the clearly increased bleeding rates 
when rivaroxaban is added to platelet function inhibitors for secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis 
in ACS patients are of concern and these uncertainties must be taken into account in the overall 
benefit/risk evaluation. 
Upon  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  proposed  a  post  marketing  non-interventional  study  (XA 
1301/16773)  of  Xarelto  in  combination  with  antiplatelet  therapy  or  standard  dual  antiplatelet 
therapy  for  secondary  prevention  of  major  cardiovascular  events  in  patients  with  acute  coronary 
syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers. 
11,000 patients are planned for enrollment and the study would end 12 months after enrollment of 
the  last  patient.  This  study  will  provide  further  information  on  the  use  of  rivaroxaban  in  routine 
clinical practice especially in elderly patients and in patients with co-morbidities. This is particularly 
important  in  view  of  the  limited  external  data  supporting  the  use  of  anticoagulants  on  top  of 
antiplatelet agents.  
2.6.2. Conclusions on the clinical safety 
In summary the exposure of rivaroxaban in the proposed indication is considered sufficient for 
assessment of the safety characteristics of the proposed regimen. The incidences of non-bleeding 
adverse events were similar in the rivaroxaban groups as compared to placebo and there were no 
signals for an increased incidence of non-bleeding hepatic, renal, laboratory adverse events which 
is in line with earlier experience in other indications. 
In summary, the long-term cardiovascular consequences of the clearly increased bleeding rates 
when rivaroxaban is added to platelet function inhibitors for secondary cardiovascular prophylaxis 
in ACS patients are of concern and must be taken into account in the overall benefit/risk 
evaluation. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in 
the Summary of Product Characteristics.  
The CHMP considered the need for update of the PSUR cycle as a result of the approval of this 
new indication. Thus the MAH should submit 6 monthly PSURs and then follow the standard PSUR 
cycle as set out in the EURD list. 
The post marketing non-interventional study (XA 1301/16773) will provide further information on 
the use of rivaroxaban in routine clinical practice especially in elderly patients and in patients with 
co-morbidities.  Given  the  limited  external  data  supporting  the  use  of  anticoagulants  on  top  of 
antiplatelet  agents,  this  study  is  considered  key  to  monitor  the  benefit/risk  in  the  post 
authorization setting and will provide further support to the daily use of rivaroxaban to adequately 
monitor  the  benefit  risk  in  daily  practice,  through  regular  interim  analysis  reports  provided  on  a 
yearly  basis  and  at  specified  milestones  (such  as  5000  patients  followed  for  at  least  3  months). 
Thus,  this  post  authorization  study  is  a  condition  to  the  marketing  authorisation  in  this  new 
indication.

2.7  Pharmacovigilance 
Detailed description of the pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the Pharmacovigilance system as described by the MAH fulfils the 
legislative requirements and provides adequate evidence that the MAH has the services of a 
qualified person responsible for pharmacovigilance and has the necessary means for the 
notification of any adverse reaction suspected of occurring either in the Community or in a third 
country.

The  RMP  has  been  updated  (version  7.10)  to  include  the  new  proposed  indication  of  ACS 
[Prevention  of  cardiovascular  death,  myocardial  infarction,  and  stent  thrombosis  in  patients  after 
an  acute  coronary  syndrome  (ACS)  (non-ST  elevation  or  ST  elevation  myocardial  infarction  or 
unstable  angina)  in  combination  with  acetylsalicylic  acid  (ASA)  alone  or  with  ASA  plus  a 
thienopyridine (clopidogrel or ticlopidine)]. 
Upon  CHMP  request,  the  MAH  has  proposed  a  post  marketing  non-interventional  study  (XA 
1301/16773),  of  Xarelto  in  combination  with  antiplatelet  therapy  or  standard  dual  antiplatelet 
therapy  for  secondary  prevention  of  major  cardiovascular  events  in  patients  with  acute  coronary 
syndrome  (ACS)  with  elevated  cardiac  biomarkers.  11,000  patients  are  planned  for  enrollment, 
and the study would end 12 months after enrollment of the last patient. 
As discussed above, this study is considered of key importance to continue monitoring the use of 
xarelto  in  this  new  indication.  Regular  interim  analysis  are  planned  with  yearly  reporting  and 
additional reporting after 5000 patients prior to final study report is submitted.  
The MAH should ensure that the sample is collected as quickly as possible (e.g. by including more 
centers from various countries) and within the agreed timelines.  
A  study  concept  has  been  included  in  the  updated  RMP.  The  concept  submitted  is  endorsed 
provided that an updated protocol is submitted by June 2013 for final review.  
This  PASS  should  be  a  condition  of  Marketing  Authorisation  and  therefore  is  to  be  inserted  in 
Annex II of the RMP. The RMP has been be updated in line with the CHMP requests. 
The ongoing risk minimisation activities aimed at increasing awareness about the potential risk of 
bleeding  during  treatment  with  Xarelto  and  providing  guidance  on  how  to  manage  that  risk  are 
extended  to  the  new  proposed  indication  in  order  to  target  all  physicians  and  patients  who  are 
expected to prescribe/use Xarelto.   
3. BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
The design and the size of the clinical programme are considered to be adequate for an 
assessment of the efficacy to be expected in Acute Coronary Syndrome patients with the proposed 
dose regimen. The large pivotal three arm study had an attractive design comparing two doses of 
rivaroxaban against placebo and it is considered well performed. 
From an efficacy perspective, the choice of doses was not easily defined based on the dose-finding 
study (ATLAS ACS TIMI 46). Actually, there was no indication of a reduction of the primary 
composite endpoint (all-cause death, MI, stroke, or severe recurrent ischemia) in stratum II 
(patients on a combination of ASA and thienopyridin) which can be regarded as the most relevant 
stratum in the current clinical setting. Of primary importance for dose selection were obviously the 
safety outcomes that have formed the basis for the final decision of what doses to take forward to 
the phase III study (2.5mg and 5 mg). 
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013 
Page 68/75 
 
  
  
 
Considering the efficacy results of all dose groups in the dose finding study, twice daily dosing 
showed a non-significant trend for a larger reduction as compared to placebo than once daily 
dosing. Based on the phase II study, the choice of the twice daily dosing appears reasonable, but 
is inconsistent with the dosing frequency for other approved indications. A bid regimen was also 
considered by the MAH to be potentially safer in the target population expected to have a 
comparatively high bleeding tendency. 
In the pivotal study, three-arm rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid and 5 mg bid was compared to placebo in 
addition to standard care in patients with ACS after the initial treatment. The included population, 
concomitant medication and background therapy seems to be essentially representative for a 
European ACS population although a somewhat low proportion of women (25%) is noted. 
However, the results in the subgroup of women was consistent with the overall results.  
The composite primary endpoint of cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke was 
reduced in the 2.5 mg bid group in the over-all population with event rates/100 patient-years of 
7.04 vs. 5.92 (HR 0.84, 95% CI 0.72; 0.97, p=0.020) in the rivaroxaban and placebo groups 
respectively approximately corresponding to an absolute reduction of one percent events/year. 
The results were driven by stratum II (ASA and thienopyridin) as the proportion of patients in 
stratum 1 (only ASA for platelet inhibition) was small (6.8%), but where a consistent trend was 
observed.  
In the 5 mg bid dose group a similar reduction was seen with event rates/100 patient-years of 
7.04 vs 6.03 (HR 0.85; 95% CI 0.73, 0.98, p=0.028). Also these results were driven by stratum 
II.  
As the proportion of patients treated with ASA only (stratum 1) was small, no firm conclusions can 
be drawn for that stratum. It could, however, be speculated based on the hazard ratios observed 
in the phase II and III study results that the additional benefit is larger if rivaroxaban is added to 
less intensive platelet  inhibition. Based on the data submitted, the CV-SAG recommendation and 
further discussion with the MAH during the oral explanation, it is finally considered acceptable to 
approve Xarelto for patients with ASA only and taking into account the more restricted indication 
in patients with elevated cardiac biomarkers.  
The effect of rivaroxaban 2.5 mg b.i.d. on the primary efficacy endpoint was largely driven by the 
reduction in CV deaths, including a reduction in fatal MIs. A numerical non-significant reduction in 
MIs was noted in that dose group as compared to placebo, but no reduction of strokes was seen. 
On the contrary, a small numerical increase of stroke rate was observed. 
In the 5 mg bid dose group no significant reduction of CV deaths in comparison with placebo was 
seen but rather a weak numerical trend. In this dose group the significant results were driven by a 
significant reduction of MIs. 
In conclusion, the observed numerical differences between the dose groups for the components of 
the composite endpoints have been sufficiently well explained by the MAH. 
All-cause deaths in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. group was reduced in consistency with the reduction of CV 
deaths (HR: 0.68, 95%CI: 0.53, 0.87, p=0.002). In the 5 mg bid group no such reduction was 
seen (HR 0.95; 0.76, 1.19, p=0.662). 
It is also noteworthy that the pre-defined net clinical outcome endpoint (Secondary Efficacy 
Endpoint 2 where primary efficacy results were balanced with TIMI major bleedings) did not 
improve with rivaroxaban treatment.

Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The addition of an anticoagulant to antiplatelet therapy for long term treatment after an ACS event 
has external support with regard to a reduction of cardiovascular ischemic events but these 
benefits has been outweighed by an increased bleeding tendency. Thus the external support for a 
positive benefit/risk balance for the proposed regimen where an anticoagulant is added to dual 
antiplatelet therapy is difficult in this proposed indication. This application is essentially supported 
by one pivotal study in a controversial area where other studies have failed. Thus the confirmatory 
study has to be compelling and the robustness of the findings has been challenged during the 
assessment. However, in light of the sensitivity analyses performed, the consistency of the 
primary efficacy endpoint between the two dose groups, and the external support for a reduction 
in ischemic events by the proposed strategy, the CHMP accepted that a reduction of the primary 
composite end-point has been demonstrated.  
Of all randomised patients (n=15526) 500 (3.2%) had died, 13728 (88,4%) were alive and for 
1298 (8.4%) vital status was unknown at the global treatment end day. When baseline 
parameters judged to be of prognostic relevance were compared the group with missing data was 
more similar with the group of survivors than with those that died. It is however difficult to if 
establish if events during or after the acute ACS episode may have rendered the patients with 
missing data to be at higher risk. In order to reverse the overall primary efficacy results to being 
non-significant for stratum 2 in the 2.5 mg group the incidence rate in the group with missing data 
would need to increase from 5.6% in the patients followed to 8.7% in those with missing data. 
Such a difference is not considered to be plausible. Furthermore, the retrieved vital data of 
patients that had discontinued the trial prematurely provided further reassurance. 
The stroke rates were numerically increased among the rivaroxaban treated patients, primarily 
due to an increase in haemorrhagic strokes. Patients with an earlier history of TIA or stroke were 
not to be included in stratum II and there is a clear indication that treatment may be harmful with 
regard to risk for recurrent stroke in such patients. It should be recognised that earlier episodes of 
TIA are often difficult to establish retrospectively. However the exclusion of patients with 
stroke/TIA from the target population has been appropriately addressed in the SPC. 
The MAH has accepted to not include a claim for a reduction of stent thrombosis in SPC section 
4.1. However it accepted that they are included in section 5.1 together with the overall results in 
the important subgroup of patients who underwent PCI for the primary ACS-event. 
The results for the primary composite end-point in the subgroup of patients that underwent PCI 
were less impressive which has been discussed in the responses to the CHMP questions. However, 
the reduction in CV-mortality and all-cause mortality in that subgroup was consistent with the 
overall results. A summary of the efficacy outcome data as well as bleeding incidences in the 
patients with elevated biomarkers who underwent PCI was also provided. 
It is noteworthy that other platelet function inhibitors have been approved recently in ACS 
patients, e.g. ticagrelor that has an approved indication similar to the one now requested for 
rivaroxaban. Nothing can be said about the effects of adding rivaroxaban to such treatment.

Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
In terms of number of patients the exposure of rivaroxaban in the proposed indication is 
considered sufficient for a qualified assessment of the safety characteristics of the proposed 
regimen.  
The incidences of non-bleeding adverse events were similar in the rivaroxaban groups as 
compared to placebo and there were no signals for an increased incidence of non-bleeding hepatic, 
renal, laboratory adverse events which is in line with earlier experience in other indications.  
The bleeding pattern is consistent with what has been shown for rivaroxaban in other indications 
with a large proportion of mucosal bleedings. 
The primary safety end-point, TIMI major bleeding was higher in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg bid group 
as compared to placebo with a hazard ratio of 3.46 (95% CI; 2.1, 5.8) corresponding to an 
absolute rate of 1.3% compared with 0.4% or approximately an increase of 1%. The 
corresponding figures for the 5 mg bid dose group was an HR of 4.47 (95% CI; 2.7, 7.4) or 
approximately an increase of 1.2% from 0.4 % to 1.6%.  In a Kaplan-Meier analysis the risk for a 
clinically significant bleeding was 11.6% in the rivaroxaban 2.5 mg big group, 15.3% in the 5 mg 
bid group and 6.3% in the placebo group. Furthermore the number of intracranial bleeds were 14, 
18 and 5 in the three groups, respectively. 
The increased bleeding rates are of concern. They were mirrored in the lack of demonstrated effect 
in the predefined secondary efficacy end-point “net clinical benefit”. The observation that fatal 
bleeding events or total mortality was not increased in the 2.5 mg dose group as compared with 
placebo during the study observation period are to some extent reassuring and the results indicate 
that the overwhelming majority of bleedings could be managed clinically.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The study population in the pivotal study is on average somewhat younger than what is known for 
the European target population although it is noticed that 9% of the included patients were above 
the age of 75. It could also be expected that more patients with complicating co-morbidities will be 
treated in clinical routine. Thus the study population may not be fully representative for the 
population that will be treated in the post-marketing setting. This was highlighted and discussed 
by the CV-SAG and CHMP during the assessment. Taking also into account the CV-SAG 
recommendations and argumentations provided during the Oral Explanation, reassurance 
regarding the study population baseline compared with other studies, was provided. Nevertheless, 
it is highlighted that further information is needed to be collected in the post authorisation setting 
under routine clinical practice.  
Upon request by CHMP, the MAH has agreed to perform a post marketing observational safety 
study enrolling 11000 patients. This will provide further insight with regard to these concerns and 
regular interim analysis have been requested in order to monitor the use of xarelto in daily 
practice. This study is considered important to further monitor the benefit risk in daily practice and 
is added as a condition to the marketing authorisation. The RMP has been appropriately updated 
and will be further updated when the study protocol of the post-marketing study is reviewed and 
adopted.

It has been seen in recent trials in ACS patients that bleeding may adversely affect the CV event 
rate and mortality in the long term perspective and not only in relation to the acute bleeding 
event. Similar findings are made in the pivotal trial in this application. The MAH partially explains 
the lack of clear benefit for CV mortality in the 5 mg dose group with the higher bleeding incidence 
in this group as compared with the 2.5 mg bid dose group. It is accepted that this may have 
contributed to the differences in CV mortality between the two dose-groups, 
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
A reduction of the mortality rate when rivaroxaban is added to ASA or ASA in combination with 
clopidogrel of approximately 1% as demonstrated in the 2.5 mg bid dose group is an important 
beneficial effect of obvious clinical relevance.  
The MAH has calculated NNT/NNH rates based on the study results and estimated that 125 non-
bleeding CV death, MI and ischemic strokes are prevented, while treatment causes 10 fatal 
bleedings or ICH per 10.000 patient years. These calculations should be interpreted with caution. 
The estimation that 68% of the primary efficacy events prevented would be CV deaths relies solely 
on the results for the different components in the 2.5 mg arm with little support from the 5 mg 
treatment arm. However, this is the best estimation that can be made based on current knowledge 
and it clearly indicates effects of important clinical relevance. 
The results from the pivotal study need to be put into perspective and can be compared with the 
results of recent trials in this patient population. The comparability of patients included in the Atlas 
study with the recent trials was also discussed and reassurance was provided during the oral 
explanation, providing further external support and validity of the study in the ACS population. In 
the pivotal trial supporting the approval of ticagrelor a reduction of a similar primary composite 
endpoint of approximately 2% per treatment year as compared to clopidogrel was shown, both in 
combination with ASA. Thus, the reduction seen in this application appears less impressive. 
Significant reductions in CV mortality, total mortality and MI were seen in this study (PLATO). This 
was achieved with only a slight numerical non-significant increase in TIMI major bleedings (HR 
1.04) vs the comparative treatment. Comparisons between studies must be done with great 
caution and there are major uncertainties associated with such comparisons. It is agreed with the 
MAH that ASA and clopidogrel will most probably remain as a viable treatment alternative for ACS 
patients in the future. 
Benefit-risk balance 
In  summary, the majority of the CHMP considered that a statistically significant and clinically 
relevant reduction of the primary composite endpoint was demonstrated in the 2.5 mg b.i.d. dose 
group driven by a reduction in mortality. Additional sensivity analyses support the robustness of 
the primary efficacy results. The increased bleeding tendency is considered to be acceptable with 
no observed differences between the 2.5 mg dose group and placebo for fatal bleedings or 
intracranial bleedings. The overwhelming majority of bleedings observed were clinically 
manageable. 
Taking into account the CV-SAG recommendation, and the discussion at the oral explanation, the 
CHMP finally agreed with the narrow indication than initally proposed.  
Assessment report  
EMA/342289/2013 
Page 72/75 
 
  
  
Xarelto, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or 
ticlopidine, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients after an 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
A justification for this restriction has been provided by the MAH in response to the CHMP questions 
and the restriction as such is acceptable in the CHMP opinion. 
Nevertheless, the post approval study (XA1301) planned to enroll 11000 patients in a short time 
frame will provide further insight on the use of xarelto in the post approval setting. Regular interim 
analysis on a yearly basis will enable appropriate monitoring of benefit risk of xarelto in the post 
authorisation setting under routine daily practice.  
However, there were divergent opinions expressed by some members who considered that the 
benefit/risk balance was negative based on the  safety profile considered insufficiently 
demonstrated especially with regard of major bleedings. 
Conclusions 
The CHMP agreed with the extension of the indication for Xarelto specifically for this new strength 
(2.5 mg) and considered that a positive benefit risk balance has been demonstrated in the 
targeted restricted indication.  
The approved indication is as follows :  
Xarelto co-administrated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) alone or with ASA plus clopidogrel or 
ticlopidine, is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients after an 
acute coronary syndrome (ACS) with elevated cardiac biomarkers (see sections 4.3, 4.4 and 5.1). 
User consultation 
No full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet has been performed on 
the basis of a bridging report making reference to Xarelto and a focused user test. For future 
reference, the bridging report is not considered acceptable since the justification lacks vital 
information and a critical discussion. However, the focus test presents that the vital sections of 
the package leaflet are considered readable, and the focus test is therefore acceptable. However, 
the CHMP suggested some additional changes to the Package Leaflet due to the result of the user 
test. These changes will improve readability even further and have been implemented in the 
adopted Product information.  
Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by 
majority that the risk-benefit balance of Xarelto co-administrated with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA)

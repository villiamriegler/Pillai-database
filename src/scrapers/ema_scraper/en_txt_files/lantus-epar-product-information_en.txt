CLINICAL PARTICULARS 
4.1  Therapeutic indications 
Treatment of diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. 
4.2  Posology and method of administration 
Posology 
Lantus contains insulin glargine, an insulin analogue, and has a prolonged duration of action. 
Lantus should be administered once daily at any time but at the same time each day.  
The dose regimen (dose and timing) should be individually adjusted. In patients with type 2 diabetes 
mellitus, Lantus can also be given together with orally active antidiabetic medicinal products. 
The potency of this medicinal product is stated in units. These units are exclusive to Lantus and are not 
the same as IU or the units used to express the potency of other insulin analogues (see section 5.1). 
Special population 
Elderly population (≥65 years old) 
In the elderly, progressive deterioration of renal function may lead to a steady decrease in insulin 
requirements. 
2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Renal impairment 
In patients with renal impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced insulin 
metabolism.  
Hepatic impairment 
In patients with hepatic impairment, insulin requirements may be diminished due to reduced capacity 
for gluconeogenesis and reduced insulin metabolism.  
Adolescents and children aged 2 years and older patients 
Paediatric population 
• 
Safety and efficacy of Lantus have been established in adolescents and children aged 2 years and older 
(see section 5.1). The dose regimen (dose and timing) should be individually adjusted. 
• 
The safety and efficacy of Lantus have not been established. No data are available. 
Children below 2 years of age  
Switch from other insulins to Lantus 
When switching from a treatment regimen with an intermediate or long-acting insulin to a regimen 
with Lantus, a change of the dose of the basal insulin may be required and the concomitant 
antidiabetic treatment may need to be adjusted (dose and timing of additional regular insulins or 
fast-acting insulin analogues or the dose of oral antidiabetic medicinal products). 
Switch from twice daily NPH insulin to Lantus 
To reduce the risk of nocturnal and early morning hypoglycaemia, patients who are changing their 
basal insulin regimen from a twice daily NPH insulin to a once daily regimen with Lantus should 
reduce their daily dose of basal insulin by 20-30% during the first weeks of treatment.  
Switch from insulin glargine 300 units/ml to Lantus 
Lantus and Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml) are not bioequivalent and are not directly 
interchangeable. To reduce the risk of hypoglycemia, patients who are changing their basal insulin 
regimen from an insulin regimen with once daily insulin glargine 300 units/ml to a once daily regimen 
with Lantus should reduce their dose by approximately 20%. 
During the first weeks the reduction should, at least partially, be compensated by an increase in 
mealtime insulin, after this period the regimen should be adjusted individually. 
Close metabolic monitoring is recommended during the switch and in the initial weeks thereafter. 
With improved metabolic control and resulting increase in insulin sensitivity a further adjustment in 
dose regimen may become necessary. Dose adjustment may also be required, for example, if the 
patient's weight or life-style changes, change of timing of insulin dose or other circumstances arise that 
increase susceptibility to hypo- or hyperglycaemia (see section 4.4). 
Patients with high insulin doses because of antibodies to human insulin may experience an improved 
insulin response with Lantus. 
Method of administration 
Lantus is administered subcutaneously. 
Lantus should not be administered intravenously. The prolonged duration of action of Lantus is 
dependent on its injection into subcutaneous tissue. Intravenous administration of the usual 
subcutaneous dose could result in severe hypoglycaemia. 
There are no clinically relevant differences in serum insulin or glucose levels after abdominal, deltoid 
or thigh administration of Lantus. Injection sites must be rotated within a given injection area from one 
injection to the next in order to reduce the risk of lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis (see 
section 4.4 and 4.8). 
3 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Lantus must not be mixed with any other insulin or diluted. Mixing or diluting can change its 
time/action profile and mixing can cause precipitation. 
Lantus 100 units/ml solution for injection in a vial 
For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 
Lantus 100 units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge 
Lantus 100 units/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
For further details on handling, see section 6.6. 
Lantus SoloStar 100 units/ml solution for injection in a pre-filled pen 
Lantus SoloStar 100 units/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.4). 
Before using SoloStar, the instructions for use included in the package leaflet must be read carefully 
(see section 6.6). 
4.3  Contraindications 
Hypersensitivity to the active substance or to any of the excipients listed in section 6.1. 
4.4  Special warnings and precautions for use 
Traceability 
In order to improve the traceability of biological medicinal products, the name and the batch number 
of the administered product should be clearly recorded. 
Lantus is not the insulin of choice for the treatment of diabetic ketoacidosis. Instead, regular insulin 
administered intravenously is recommended in such cases. 
In case of insufficient glucose control or a tendency to hyper- or hypoglycaemic episodes, the patient's 
adherence to the prescribed treatment regimen, injection sites and proper injection technique and all 
other relevant factors must be reviewed before dose adjustment is considered. 
Transferring a patient to another type or brand of insulin should be done under strict medical 
supervision. Changes in strength, brand (manufacturer), type (regular, NPH, lente, long-acting, etc.), 
origin (animal, human, human insulin analogue) and/or method of manufacture may result in the need 
for a change in dose. 
Patients must be instructed to perform continuous rotation of the injection site to reduce the risk of 
developing lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis. There is a potential risk of delayed insulin 
absorption and worsened glycaemic control following insulin injections at sites with these reactions. A 
sudden change in the injection site to an unaffected area has been reported to result in hypoglycaemia. 
Blood glucose monitoring is recommended after the change in the injection site, and dose adjustment 
of antidiabetic medications may be considered. 
Hypoglycaemia 
The time of occurrence of hypoglycaemia depends on the action profile of the insulins used and may, 
therefore, change when the treatment regimen is changed. Due to more sustained basal insulin supply 
with Lantus, less nocturnal but more early morning hypoglycaemia can be expected. 
Particular caution should be exercised, and intensified blood glucose monitoring is advisable in 
patients in whom hypoglycaemic episodes might be of particular clinical relevance, such as in patients 
with significant stenoses of the coronary arteries or of the blood vessels supplying the brain (risk of 
cardiac or cerebral complications of hypoglycaemia) as well as in patients with proliferative 
retinopathy, particularly if not treated with photocoagulation (risk of transient amaurosis following 
hypoglycaemia). 
4 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Patients should be aware of circumstances where warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia are 
diminished. The warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia may be changed, be less pronounced or be 
absent in certain risk groups. These include patients: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
in whom glycaemic control is markedly improved, 
in whom hypoglycaemia develops gradually, 
who are elderly, 
after transfer from animal insulin to human insulin, 
in whom an autonomic neuropathy is present, 
with a long history of diabetes, 
suffering from a psychiatric illness, 
receiving concurrent treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
Such situations may result in severe hypoglycaemia (and possibly loss of consciousness) prior to the 
patient's awareness of hypoglycaemia. 
The prolonged effect of subcutaneous insulin glargine may delay recovery from hypoglycaemia. 
If normal or decreased values for glycated haemoglobin are noted, the possibility of recurrent, 
unrecognised (especially nocturnal) episodes of hypoglycaemia must be considered. 
Adherence of the patient to the dose and dietary regimen, correct insulin administration and awareness 
of hypoglycaemia symptoms are essential to reduce the risk of hypoglycaemia. Factors increasing the 
susceptibility to hypoglycaemia require particularly close monitoring and may necessitate dose 
adjustment. These include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
change in the injection area, 
improved insulin sensitivity (e.g., by removal of stress factors), 
unaccustomed, increased or prolonged physical activity, 
intercurrent illness (e.g. vomiting, diarrhoea), 
inadequate food intake, 
missed meals, 
alcohol consumption, 
certain uncompensated endocrine disorders, (e.g. in hypothyroidism and in anterior pituitary or 
adrenocortical insufficiency), 
concomitant treatment with certain other medicinal products (see section 4.5). 
- 
Intercurrent illness 
Intercurrent illness requires intensified metabolic monitoring. In many cases urine tests for ketones are 
indicated, and often it is necessary to adjust the insulin dose. The insulin requirement is often 
increased. Patients with type 1 diabetes must continue to consume at least a small amount of 
carbohydrates on a regular basis, even if they are able to eat only little or no food, or are vomiting etc. 
and they must never omit insulin entirely. 
Insulin antibodies 
Insulin administration may cause insulin antibodies to form. In rare cases, the presence of such insulin 
antibodies may necessitate adjustment of the insulin dose in order to correct a tendency to hyper- or 
hypoglycaemia (see section 5.1). 
Pens to be used with Lantus 100 units/ml in cartridges 
Lantus 100 units/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. The Lantus cartridges should only be 
used with the following pens:  
- 
- 
dose increments. 
These cartridges should not be used with any other reusable pen as the dosing accuracy has only been 
established with the listed pens.  
JuniorSTAR which delivers Lantus in 0.5 unit dose increments  
ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar and AllStar PRO which all deliver Lantus in 1 unit 
5 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country (see section 4.2 and 6.6) 
Handling of the SoloStar pre-filled pen 
Lantus SoloStar 100 units/ml in pre-filled pen is only suitable for subcutaneous injections. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used (see section 4.2). Before using SoloStar, 
the instructions for use included in the package leaflet must be read carefully. SoloStar has to be used 
as recommended in these instructions for use (see section 6.6). 
Medication errors 
Medication errors have been reported in which other insulins, particularly short-acting insulins, have 
been accidentally administered instead of insulin glargine. Insulin label must always be checked 
before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin glargine and other insulins. 
Combination of Lantus with pioglitazone 
Cases of cardiac failure have been reported when pioglitazone was used in combination with insulin, 
especially in patients with risk factors for development of cardiac heart failure. This should be kept in 
mind if treatment with the combination of pioglitazone and Lantus is considered. If the combination is 
used, patients should be observed for signs and symptoms of heart failure, weight gain and oedema. 
Pioglitazone should be discontinued if any deterioration in cardiac symptoms occurs.  
Excipients 
This medicinal product contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially 
‘sodium-free’. 
4.5 
Interaction with other medicinal products and other forms of interaction 
A number of substances affect glucose metabolism and may require dose adjustment of insulin 
glargine. 
Substances that may enhance the blood-glucose-lowering effect and increase susceptibility to 
hypoglycaemia include oral antidiabetic medicinal products, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) 
inhibitors, disopyramide, fibrates, fluoxetine, monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors, pentoxifylline, 
propoxyphene, salicylates and sulfonamide antibiotics. 
Substances that may reduce the blood-glucose-lowering effect include corticosteroids, danazol, 
diazoxide, diuretics, glucagon, isoniazid, oestrogens and progestogens, phenothiazine derivatives, 
somatropin, sympathomimetic medicinal products (e.g. epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, 
terbutaline), thyroid hormones, atypical antipsychotic medicinal products (e.g. clozapine and 
olanzapine) and protease inhibitors. 
Beta-blockers, clonidine, lithium salts or alcohol may either potentiate or weaken the 
blood-glucose-lowering effect of insulin. Pentamidine may cause hypoglycaemia, which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
In addition, under the influence of sympatholytic medicinal products such as beta-blockers, clonidine, 
guanethidine and reserpine, the signs of adrenergic counter-regulation may be reduced or absent. 
4.6  Fertility, pregnancy and lactation 
Pregnancy 
For insulin glargine no clinical data on exposed pregnancies from controlled clinical studies are 
available. A large amount of data on pregnant women (more than 1000 pregnancy outcomes) indicate 
no specific adverse effects of insulin glargine on pregnancy and no specific malformative nor 
feto/neonatal toxicity of insulin glargine. Animal data do not indicate reproductive toxicity.  
The use of Lantus may be considered during pregnancy, if clinically needed. 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
It is essential for patients with pre-existing or gestational diabetes to maintain good metabolic control 
throughout pregnancy to prevent adverse outcomes associated with hyperglycemia. Insulin 
requirements may decrease during the first trimester and generally increase during the second and 
third trimesters. Immediately after delivery, insulin requirements decline rapidly (increased risk of 
hypoglycaemia). Careful monitoring of glucose control is essential. 
Breast-feeding 
It is unknown whether insulin glargine is excreted in human milk. No metabolic effects of ingested 
insulin glargine on the breast-fed newborn/infant are anticipated since insulin glargine as a peptide is 
digested into aminoacids in the human gastrointestinal tract. Breast-feeding women may require 
adjustments in insulin dose and diet. 
Fertility 
Animal studies do not indicate direct harmful effects with respect to fertility.  
4.7  Effects on ability to drive and use machines 
The patient's ability to concentrate and react may be impaired as a result of hypoglycaemia or 
hyperglycaemia or, for example, as a result of visual impairment. This may constitute a risk in 
situations where these abilities are of special importance (e.g. driving a car or using machines). 
Patients should be advised to take precautions to avoid hypoglycaemia whilst driving. This is 
particularly important in those who have reduced or absent awareness of the warning symptoms of 
hypoglycaemia or have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia. It should be considered whether it is 
advisable to drive or use machines in these circumstances. 
4.8  Undesirable effects 
Summary of the safety profile 
Hypoglycaemia (very common), in general the most frequent adverse reaction of insulin therapy, may 
occur if the insulin dose is too high in relation to the insulin requirement (see section 4.4). 
Tabulated list of adverse reactions 
The following related adverse reactions from clinical investigations are listed below by system organ 
class and in order of decreasing incidence (very common: ≥1/10; common: ≥1/100 to <1/10; 
uncommon: ≥1/1,000 to <1/100; rare: ≥1/10,000 to <1/1,000; very rare: <1/10,000; not known: cannot

Description of selected adverse reactions 
Metabolism and nutrition disorders 
Severe hypoglycaemic attacks, especially if recurrent, may lead to neurological damage. Prolonged or 
severe hypoglycaemic episodes may be life-threatening. 
In many patients, the signs and symptoms of neuroglycopenia are preceded by signs of adrenergic 
counter-regulation. Generally, the greater and more rapid the decline in blood glucose, the more 
marked is the phenomenon of counter-regulation and its symptoms (see section 4.4). 
Immune system disorders 
Immediate-type allergic reactions to insulin are rare. Such reactions to insulin (including insulin 
glargine) or the excipients may, for example, be associated with generalised skin reactions, 
angio-oedema, bronchospasm, hypotension and shock, and may be life-threatening. 
Eyes disorders 
A marked change in glycaemic control may cause temporary visual impairment, due to temporary 
alteration in the turgidity and refractive index of the lens. 
Long-term improved glycaemic control decreases the risk of progression of diabetic retinopathy. 
However, intensification of insulin therapy with abrupt improvement in glycaemic control may be 
associated with temporary worsening of diabetic retinopathy. In patients with proliferative retinopathy, 
particularly if not treated with photocoagulation, severe hypoglycaemic episodes may result in 
transient amaurosis. 
Skin and subcutaneous tissue disorders 
Lipodystrophy and cutaneous amyloidosis may occur at the injection site and delay local insulin 
absorption. Continuous rotation of the injection site within the given injection area may help to reduce 
or prevent these reactions (see section 4.4).

Injection site reactions include redness, pain, itching, hives, swelling, or inflammation. Most minor 
reactions to insulins at the injection site usually resolve in a few days to a few weeks. 
Rarely, insulin may cause sodium retention and oedema particularly if previously poor metabolic 
control is improved by intensified insulin therapy. 
Paediatric population 
In general, the safety profile for children and adolescents (≤18 years of age) is similar to the safety 
profile for adults.  
The adverse reaction reports received from post marketing surveillance included relatively more 
frequent injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions (rash, 
urticaria) in children and adolescents (≤18 years of age) than in adults. 
Clinical study safety data are not available for children under 2 years. 
Reporting of suspected adverse reactions 
Reporting suspected adverse reactions after authorisation of the medicinal product is important. It 
allows continued monitoring of the benefit/risk balance of the medicinal product. Healthcare 
professionals are asked to report any suspected adverse reactions via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. 
4.9  Overdose 
Symptoms 
Insulin overdose may lead to severe and sometimes long-term and life-threatening hypoglycaemia. 
Management 
Mild episodes of hypoglycaemia can usually be treated with oral carbohydrates. Adjustments in dose 
of the medicinal product, meal patterns, or physical activity may be needed. 
More severe episodes with coma, seizure, or neurologic impairment may be treated with 
intramuscular/subcutaneous glucagon or concentrated intravenous glucose. Sustained carbohydrate 
intake and observation may be necessary because hypoglycaemia may recur after apparent clinical 
recovery. 
5. 
PHARMACOLOGICAL PROPERTIES 
5.1  Pharmacodynamic properties 
Pharmacotherapeutic group: Drugs used in diabetes, insulins and analogues for injection, long-acting. 
ATC Code: A10AE04. 
Mechanism of action 
Insulin glargine is a human insulin analogue designed to have a low solubility at neutral pH. It is 
completely soluble at the acidic pH of the Lantus injection solution (pH 4). After injection into the 
subcutaneous tissue, the acidic solution is neutralised leading to formation of micro-precipitates from 
which small amounts of insulin glargine are continuously released, providing a smooth, peakless, 
predictable concentration/time profile with a prolonged duration of action. 
Insulin glargine is metabolised into 2 active metabolites M1 and M2 (see section 5.2).  
Insulin receptor binding: In vitro studies indicate that the affinity of insulin glargine and its 
metabolites M1 and M2 for the human insulin receptor is similar to the one of human insulin.  
IGF-1 receptor binding: The affinity of insulin glargine for the human IGF-1 receptor is approximately 
5 to 8-fold greater than that of human insulin (but approximately 70 to 80-fold lower than the one of 
9 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
IGF-1), whereas M1 and M2 bind the IGF-1 receptor with slightly lower affinity compared to human 
insulin. 
The total therapeutic insulin concentration (insulin glargine and its metabolites) found in type 1 
diabetic patients was markedly lower than what would be required for a halfmaximal occupation of the 
IGF-1 receptor and the subsequent activation of the mitogenic-proliferative pathway initiated by the 
IGF-1 receptor. Physiological concentrations of endogenous IGF-1 may activate the 
mitogenic-proliferative pathway; however, the therapeutic concentrations found in insulin therapy, 
including in Lantus therapy, are considerably lower than the pharmacological concentrations required 
to activate the IGF-1 pathway. 
The primary activity of insulin, including insulin glargine, is regulation of glucose metabolism. Insulin 
and its analogues lower blood glucose levels by stimulating peripheral glucose uptake, especially by 
skeletal muscle and fat, and by inhibiting hepatic glucose production. Insulin inhibits lipolysis in the 
adipocyte, inhibits proteolysis and enhances protein synthesis. 
In clinical pharmacology studies, intravenous insulin glargine and human insulin have been shown to 
be equipotent when given at the same doses. As with all insulins, the time course of action of insulin 
glargine may be affected by physical activity and other variables. 
In euglycaemic clamp studies in healthy subjects or in patients with type 1 diabetes, the onset of action 
of subcutaneous insulin glargine was slower than with human NPH insulin, its effect profile was 
smooth and peakless, and the duration of its effect was prolonged. 
The following graph shows the results from a study in patients: 
Activity profile in patients with type 1 diabetes 
*determined as amount of glucose infused to maintain constant plasma glucose levels (hourly mean 
values) 
The longer duration of action of subcutaneous insulin glargine is directly related to its slower rate of 
absorption and supports once daily administration. The time course of action of insulin and insulin 
analogues such as insulin glargine may vary considerably in different individuals or within the same 
individual. 
In a clinical study, symptoms of hypoglycaemia or counter-regulatory hormone responses were similar 
after intravenous insulin glargine and human insulin both in healthy volunteers and patients with 
type 1 diabetes. 
10 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In clinical studies, antibodies that cross-react with human insulin and insulin glargine were observed 
with the same frequency in both NPH-insulin and insulin glargine treatment groups. 
Effects of insulin glargine (once daily) on diabetic retinopathy were evaluated in an open-label 5 year 
NPH-controlled study (NPH given bid) in 1024 type 2 diabetic patients in which progression of 
retinopathy by 3 or more steps on the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) scale was 
investigated by fundus photography. No significant difference was seen in the progression of diabetic 
retinopathy when insulin glargine was compared to NPH insulin. 
The ORIGIN (Outcome Reduction with Initial Glargine INtervention) study was a multicenter, 
randomised, 2x2 factorial design study conducted in 12,537 participants at high cardiovascular (CV) 
risk with impaired fasting glucose (IFG) or impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) (12% of participants) or 
type 2 diabetes mellitus treated with ≤1 antidiabetic oral agent (88% of participants). Participants were 
randomised (1:1) to receive insulin glargine (n=6264), titrated to reach FPG ≤95 mg/dl (5.3 mM), or 
standard care (n=6273).  
The first co-primary efficacy outcome was the time to the first occurrence of CV death, nonfatal 
myocardial infarction (MI), or nonfatal stroke, and the second co-primary efficacy outcome was the 
time to the first occurrence of any of the first co-primary events, or revascularisation procedure 
(coronary, carotid, or peripheral), or hospitalisation for heart failure. 
Secondary endpoints included all-cause mortality and a composite microvascular outcome.  
Insulin glargine did not alter the relative risk for CV disease and CV mortality when compared to 
standard of care. There were no differences between insulin glargine and standard care for the two 
co-primary outcomes; for any component endpoint comprising these outcomes; for all-cause mortality; 
or for the composite microvascular outcome.  
Mean dose of insulin glargine by study end was 0.42 U/kg. At baseline, participants had a median 
HbA1c value of 6.4% and median on-treatment HbA1c values ranged from 5.9 to 6.4% in the insulin 
glargine group, and 6.2% to 6.6% in the standard care group throughout the duration of follow-up.  
The rates of severe hypoglycaemia (affected participants per 100 participant years of exposure) were 
1.05 for insulin glargine and 0.30 for standard care group and the rates of confirmed non-severe 
hypoglycaemia were 7.71 for insulin glargine and 2.44 for standard care group. Over the course of this 
6-year study, 42% of the insulin glargine group did not experience any hypoglycaemia. 
At the last on-treatment visit, there was a mean increase in body weight from baseline of 1.4 kg in the 
insulin glargine group and a mean decrease of 0.8 kg in the standard care group.  
Paediatric population 
In a randomised, controlled clinical study, paediatric patients (age range 6 to 15 years) with type 1 
diabetes (n=349) were treated for 28 weeks with a basal-bolus insulin regimen where regular human 
insulin was used before each meal. Insulin glargine was administered once daily at bedtime and NPH 
human insulin was administered once or twice daily. Similar effects on glycohemoglobin and the 
incidence of symptomatic hypoglycemia were observed in both treatment groups, however fasting 
plasma glucose decreased more from baseline in the insulin glargine group than in the NPH group. 
There was less severe hypoglycaemia in the insulin glargine group as well. One hundred forty three of 
the patients treated with insulin glargine in this study continued treatment with insulin glargine in an 
uncontrolled extension study with mean duration of follow-up of 2 years. No new safety signals were 
seen during this extended treatment with insulin glargine. 
A crossover study comparing insulin glargine plus lispro insulin to NPH plus regular human insulin 
(each treatment administered for 16 weeks in random order) in 26 adolescent type 1 diabetic patients 
aged 12 to 18 years was also performed. As in the paediatric study described above, fasting plasma 
glucose reduction from baseline was greater in the insulin glargine group than in the NPH group. 
HbA1c changes from baseline were similar between treatment groups; however blood glucose values 
11 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
recorded overnight were significantly higher in the insulin glargine/ lispro group than the NPH/regular 
group, with a mean nadir of 5.4 mM versus 4.1 mM. Correspondingly, the incidences of nocturnal 
hypoglycaemia were 32% in the insulin glargine / lispro group versus 52% in the NPH / regular group. 
A 24-week parallel group study was conducted in 125 children with type 1 diabetes mellitus aged 2 to 
6 years, comparing insulin glargine given once daily in the morning to NPH insulin given once or 
twice daily as basal insulin. Both groups received bolus insulin before meals. 
The primary aim of demonstrating non-inferiority of insulin glargine to NPH in all hypoglycaemia was 
not met and there was a trend to an increase of hypoglycemic events with insulin glargine [insulin 
glargine: NPH rate ratio (95% CI) = 1.18 (0.97-1.44)].  
Glycohaemoglobin and glucose variabilities were comparable in both treatment groups. No new safety 
signals were observed in this study. 
5.2  Pharmacokinetic properties 
In healthy subjects and diabetic patients, insulin serum concentrations indicated a slower and much 
more prolonged absorption and showed a lack of a peak after subcutaneous injection of insulin 
glargine in comparison to human NPH insulin. Concentrations were thus consistent with the time 
profile of the pharmacodynamic activity of insulin glargine. The graph above shows the activity 
profiles over time of insulin glargine and NPH insulin. 
Insulin glargine injected once daily will reach steady state levels in 2-4 days after the first dose. 
When given intravenously the elimination half-life of insulin glargine and human insulin were 
comparable. 
After subcutaneous injection of Lantus in diabetic patients, insulin glargine is rapidly metabolized at 
the carboxyl terminus of the Beta chain with formation of two active metabolites M1 
(21A-Gly-insulin) and M2 (21A-Gly-des-30B-Thr-insulin). In plasma, the principal circulating 
compound is the metabolite M1. The exposure to M1 increases with the administered dose of Lantus. 
The pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic findings indicate that the effect of the subcutaneous 
injection with Lantus is principally based on exposure to M1. Insulin glargine and the metabolite M2 
were not detectable in the vast majority of subjects and, when they were detectable their concentration 
was independent of the administered dose of Lantus. 
In clinical studies, subgroup analyses based on age and gender did not indicate any difference in safety 
and efficacy in insulin glargine-treated patients compared to the entire study population. 
Paediatric population 
Pharmacokinetics in children aged 2 to less than 6 years with type 1 diabetes mellitus was assessed in 
one clinical study (see section 5.1). Plasma “trough” levels of insulin glargine and its main M1 and 
M2 metabolites were measured in children treated with insulin glargine, revealing plasma 
concentration patterns similar to adults, and providing no evidence for accumulation of insulin 
glargine or its metabolites with chronic dosing. 
5.3  Preclinical safety data 
Non-clinical data reveal no special hazard for humans based on conventional studies of safety 
pharmacology, repeated dose toxicity, genotoxicity, carcinogenic potential, toxicity to reproduction.

6.6  Special precautions for disposal and other handling 
Inspect Lantus before use. It must only be used if the solution is clear, colourless, with no solid 
particles visible, and if it is of water-like consistency. Since Lantus is a solution, it does not require 
resuspension before use. 
Lantus must not be mixed with any other insulin or diluted. Mixing or diluting can change its 
time/action profile and mixing can cause precipitation. 
Insulin label must always be checked before each injection to avoid medication errors between insulin 
glargine and other insulins (see section 4.4). 
Lantus 100 units/ml solution for injection in a cartridge 
Insulin pen 
Lantus 100 units/ml in cartridges is only suitable for subcutaneous injections from a reusable pen. If 
administration by syringe is necessary, a vial should be used. The Lantus cartridges are to be used only 
in conjunction with the pens: ClikSTAR, Autopen 24, Tactipen, AllStar, AllStar PRO or JuniorSTAR 
(see section 4.2 and 4.4). Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country.  
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer.  
14 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
Cartridge 
Before insertion into the pen, the cartridge must be stored at room temperature for 1 to 2 hours. 
Air bubbles must be removed from the cartridge before injection (see instructions for using the pen). 
Empty cartridges must not be refilled.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lantus is and what it is used for 
Lantus contains insulin glargine. This is a modified insulin, very similar to human insulin. 
Lantus is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. 
Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of 
blood sugar. Insulin glargine has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Lantus 
Do not use Lantus 
- 
If you are allergic to insulin glargine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
Warnings and precautions 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lantus.  
Follow closely the instructions for posology, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical 
activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see box at the 
end of this leaflet). 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Lantus). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor 
may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose.

Travel 
Before travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting, 
supplies of insulin, syringes etc., 
correct storage of your insulin while travelling, 
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling, 
the possible effects of changing to different time zones, 
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
Illnesses and injuries 
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care (for example, 
adjustment to insulin dose, blood and urine tests): 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early. 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you 
require insulin. 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone (oral anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus) and 
insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you 
experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling (oedema). 
Children 
There is no experience with the use of Lantus in children below the age of 2 years. 
Other medicines and Lantus 
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes,  
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure),  
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as acetylsalicylic acid, used to relieve pain and 
lower fever),  
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
37 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation),  
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure),  
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control), 
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  
somatropin (growth hormone),  
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders),  
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as clozapine, olanzapine), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV). 
- 
- 
- 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure),  
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
- 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Lantus with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent.

Important information about some of the ingredients of Lantus  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Lantus 
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
Although Lantus contains the same active substance as Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml), these 
medicines are not interchangeable. The switch from one insulin therapy to another requires medical 
prescription, medical supervision and blood glucose monitoring. Please, consult your doctor for further 
information. 
Dose 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin 
usage, your doctor will: 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Lantus per day you will need and at what time, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests, 
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Lantus. 
Lantus is a long-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a short-acting 
insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are 
able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or 
too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Lantus can be used in adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. Use this medicine exactly as 
your doctor has told you.  
Frequency of administration 
You need one injection of Lantus every day, at the same time of the day.  
Method of administration 
Lantus is injected under the skin. Do NOT inject Lantus in a vein, since this will change its action and 
may cause hypoglycaemia. 
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Lantus. With each injection, 
change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
How to handle the vials 
Look at the vial before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike, and has 
no visible particles in it. Do not shake or mix it before use. Make sure that neither alcohol nor other 
disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin. Do not mix Lantus with any other insulins or 
medicines. Do not dilute it. Mixing or diluting may change the action of Lantus. 
Always use a new vial if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. This 
is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a problem 
with Lantus, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist 
39 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Insulin mix-ups 
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Lantus and 
other insulins.  
If you use more Lantus than you should 
− 
If you have injected too much Lantus, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). 
 Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must eat more 
food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see box 
at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Lantus 
− 
If you have missed a dose of Lantus or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood 
sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. 
For information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
− 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Lantus 
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Lantus without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
If you notice signs of your blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take the action to increase 
you blood sugar straight away (see the box at the end of this leaflet). Hypoglycaemia (low blood 
sugar) can be very serious and is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 10 
people). Low blood sugar means that there is not enough sugar in your blood.  If your blood sugar 
level falls too low, you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain 
damage and may be life-threatening. For more information, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
Severe allergic reactions (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) – the signs may include 
large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous 
membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and 
sweating. Severe allergic reactions to insulins may become life-threatening. Tell a doctor straight away 
if you notice signs of severe allergic reactions. 
 Skin changes at the injection site:  
• 
If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the skin may either shrink (lipoatrophy) (may affect up 
to 1 in 100 people) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change 
the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. 
40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site 
Common reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  
• 
The signs may include reddening, unusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or 
inflammation. This can spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually 
disappear in a few days to a few weeks. 
Eye reactions 
Rare reported side effect (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)  
• 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
• 
In rare cases, insulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body, with swelling 
in the calves and ankles. 
General disorders 
Very rare reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) 
In very rare cases, dysgeusia (taste disorders) and myalgia (muscular pain) can occur. 
Use in children and adolescents 
In general, the side effects in children and adolescents of 18 years of age or less are similar to those 
seen in adults. 
Complaints of injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions 
(rash, urticaria) are reported relatively more frequently in children and adolescents of 18 years of age 
or less than in adults. 
There is no experience in children under 2 years. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA 
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Lantus"). 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia 
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin. 
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia? 
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions. 
Why does hypoglycaemia occur? 
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever, 
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Lantus"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
44 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation, (when changing 
from your previous basal insulin to Lantus hypoglycaemia, if it occurs, may be more likely to 
occur in the morning than at night) 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia 
-In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain. 
-In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels, 
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Lantus, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Lantus"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing 
can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia? 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously.  
The recovery of hypoglycaemia may be delayed because Lantus has a long action. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
45 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lantus is and what it is used for  
Lantus contains insulin glargine. This is a modified insulin, very similar to human insulin. 
Lantus is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. 
Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of 
blood sugar. Insulin glargine has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Lantus  
Do not use Lantus 
- 
If you are allergic to insulin glargine or any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6).  
Warnings and precautions 
Lantus in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen (see also 
section 3). Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lantus. 
Follow closely the instructions for posology, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical 
activity (physical work and exercise) as discussed with your doctor. 
If your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see box at the 
end of this leaflet). 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Lantus). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor 
47 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,  
supplies of insulin, needles etc.,  
correct storage of your insulin while travelling,  
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,  
the possible effects of changing to different time zones,  
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
Illnesses and injuries  
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care (for example, 
adjustment to insulin dose, blood and urine tests): 
- 
- 
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia).  
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you 
require insulin. 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone (oral anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus) and 
insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you 
experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling (oedema). 
Children 
There is no experience with the use of Lantus in children below the age of 2 years. 
Other medicines and Lantus 
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
- 
- 
- 
48 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
- 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as acetylsalicylic acid, used to relieve pain and 
lower fever),  
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation),  
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention),  
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia),  
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis),  
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders),  
somatropin (growth hormone),  
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders), 
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as clozapine, olanzapine),  
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV). 
- 
- 
- 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders).  
- 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Lantus with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
49 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Lantus  
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Lantus  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
Although Lantus contains the same active substance as Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml), these 
medicines are not interchangeable. The switch from one insulin therapy to another requires medical 
prescription, medical supervision and blood glucose monitoring. Please, consult your doctor for further 
information. 
Dose 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin 
usage, your doctor will: 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Lantus per day you will need and at what time, 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,  
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Lantus. 
Lantus is a long-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a short-acting 
insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are 
able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or 
too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Lantus can be used in adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. Use this medicine exactly as 
your doctor has told you. 
Frequency of administration 
You need one injection of Lantus every day, at the same time of the day.  
Method of administration 
Lantus is injected under the skin. Do NOT inject Lantus in a vein, since this will change its action and 
may cause hypoglycaemia.  
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Lantus. With each injection, 
50 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using. 
How to handle the cartridges 
Lantus in cartridges is only suitable for injecting just under the skin using a reusable pen. Speak to 
your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
To ensure you get the accurate dose, the Lantus cartridges are to be used only with the following pens: 
- 
- 
Not all of these pens may be marketed in your country. 
JuniorSTAR which delivers doses in steps of 0.5 units 
ClikSTAR, Tactipen, Autopen 24, AllStar or AllStar PRO which deliver doses in steps of 1 unit. 
The pen should be used as recommended in the information provided by the device manufacturer. 
The manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen must be followed carefully for loading the cartridge, 
attaching the needle, and administering the insulin injection. 
Keep the cartridge at room temperature for 1 or 2 hours before inserting it in the pen. 
Look at the cartridge before you use it. Only use it if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike, 
and has no visible particles in it. Do not shake or mix it before use. 
Always use a new cartridge if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. 
This is because the insulin may have lost some of its effectiveness. If you think you may have a 
problem with Lantus, have it checked by your doctor or pharmacist. 
Special care before injection 
Before injection remove any air bubbles (see instructions for using the pen). 
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.  
Do not re-fill and re-use empty cartridges. Do not add any other insulin to the cartridge. Do not mix 
Lantus with any other insulins or medicines. Do not dilute it. Mixing or diluting may change the action 
of Lantus. 
Problems with the insulin pen? 
Refer to the manufacturer’s instructions for using the pen. 
If the insulin pen is damaged or not working properly (due to mechanical defects) it has to be 
discarded, and a new insulin pen has to be used. 
Insulin mix-ups 
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Lantus and 
other insulins.  
If you use more Lantus than you should 
- If you have injected too much Lantus, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you must 
eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of hypoglycaemia, see 
box at the end of this leaflet. 
51 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
If you forget to use Lantus 
- If you have missed a dose of Lantus or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood sugar 
level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For information on 
the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
- Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Lantus 
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Lantus without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
If you notice signs of your blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take action to increase you 
blood sugar level straight away (see the box at the end if this leaflet). Hypoglycaemia (low blood 
sugar) can be very serious and is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 10 
people). Low blood sugar means that there is not enough sugar in your blood If your blood sugar level 
falls too low you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain 
damage and may be life-threatening. For more information, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
Severe allergic reactions (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) – the signs may include 
large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous 
membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and 
sweating. Severe allergic reactions to insulins may become life-threatening. Tell a doctor straight away 
if you notice signs of severe allergic reaction. 
 Skin changes at the injection site:  
• 
If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the skin may either shrink (lipoatrophy) (may affect up 
to 1 in 100 people) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change 
the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. 
Common reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  
•  Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site 
The signs may include reddening, unusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or 
inflammation. This can spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually 
disappear in a few days to a few weeks. 
Rare reported side effect (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)  
•  Eye reactions 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
•  General disorders 
In rare cases, insulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body, with swelling 
in the calves and ankles. 
Very rare reported side-effects (may affect up to1 in10,000 people) 
52 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In very rare cases, dysgeusia (taste disorders) and myalgia (muscular pain) can occur. 
Use in children and adolescents 
In general, the side effects in children and adolescents of 18 years of age or less are similar to those 
seen in adults. 
Complaints of injection site reactions (injection site pain, injection site reaction) and skin reactions 
(rash, urticaria) are reported relatively more frequently in children and adolescents of 18 years of age 
or less than in adults. 
There is no experience in children under 2 years. 
Reporting of side effects  
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine. 
5. 
How to store Lantus

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA 
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include:  
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage,  
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Lantus"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia 
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine. Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin.  
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia?  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.  
Why does hypoglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever,  
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Lantus"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
56 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation (when changing 
from your previous basal insulin to Lantus hypoglycaemia, if it occurs, may be more likely to 
occur in the morning than at night), 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.  
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,  
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Lantus, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Lantus").  
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing 
can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia?

3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
The recovery of hypoglycaemia may be delayed because Lantus has a long action. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
57 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Contents of the pack and other information 
1.  What Lantus is and what it is used for 
Lantus contains insulin glargine. This is a modified insulin, very similar to human insulin. 
Lantus is used to treat diabetes mellitus in adults, adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. 
Diabetes mellitus is a disease where your body does not produce enough insulin to control the level of 
blood sugar. Insulin glargine has a long and steady blood-sugar-lowering action. 
2.  What you need to know before you use Lantus  
Do not use Lantus 
- 
If you are allergic to insulin glargine or to any of the other ingredients of this medicine (listed in 
section 6). 
Warnings and precautions 
Lantus in pre-filled pen is only suitable for injecting just under the skin (see also section 3). Speak to 
your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by another method. 
Talk to your doctor, pharmacist or nurse before using Lantus. 
Follow closely the instructions for posology, monitoring (blood and urine tests), diet and physical 
activity (physical work and exercise), injection technique as discussed with your doctor. 
If your blood sugar is too low (hypoglycaemia), follow the guidance for hypoglycaemia (see box at the 
end of this leaflet). 
Skin changes at the injection site 
The injection site should be rotated to prevent skin changes such as lumps under the skin. The insulin 
may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area (see How to use Lantus). Contact your doctor if 
you are currently injecting into a lumpy area before you start injecting in a different area. Your doctor 
59 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
may tell you to check your blood sugar more closely, and to adjust your insulin or your other 
antidiabetic medications dose. 
Travel 
Before travelling consult your doctor. You may need to talk about  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
the availability of your insulin in the country you are visiting,  
supplies of insulin, needles etc.,  
correct storage of your insulin while travelling,  
timing of meals and insulin administration while travelling,  
the possible effects of changing to different time zones,  
possible new health risks in the countries to be visited, 
what you should do in emergency situations when you feel unwell or become ill. 
Illnesses and injuries  
In the following situations, the management of your diabetes may require a lot of care (for example, 
adjustment to insulin dose, blood and urine tests): 
- 
- 
In most cases you will need a doctor. Make sure that you contact a doctor early.  
If you are ill or have a major injury then your blood sugar level may increase (hyperglycaemia). 
If you are not eating enough your blood sugar level may become too low (hypoglycaemia). 
If you have type 1 diabetes (insulin dependent diabetes mellitus), do not stop your insulin and continue 
to get enough carbohydrates. Always tell people who are caring for you or treating you that you 
require insulin. 
Insulin treatment can cause the body to produce antibodies to insulin (substances that act against 
insulin). However, only very rarely, this will require a change to your insulin dose. 
Some patients with long-standing type 2 diabetes mellitus and heart disease or previous stroke who 
were treated with pioglitazone (oral anti-diabetic medicine used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus) and 
insulin experienced the development of heart failure. Inform your doctor as soon as possible if you 
experience signs of heart failure such as unusual shortness of breath or rapid increase in weight or 
localised swelling (oedema). 
Children 
There is no experience with the use of Lantus in children below the age of 2 years. 
Other medicines and Lantus 
Some medicines cause changes in the blood sugar level (decrease, increase or both depending on the 
situation). In each case, it may be necessary to adjust your insulin dose to avoid blood sugar levels that 
are either too low or too high. Be careful when you start or stop taking another medicine. 
Tell your doctor or pharmacist if you are taking, have recently taken or might take any other 
medicines. Before taking a medicine ask your doctor if it can affect your blood sugar level and what 
action, if any, you need to take. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to fall (hypoglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
all other medicines to treat diabetes, 
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors (used to treat certain heart conditions or high 
blood pressure), 
disopyramide (used to treat certain heart conditions), 
fluoxetine (used to treat depression), 
fibrates (used to lower high levels of blood lipids), 
monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors (used to treat depression), 
- 
- 
- 
- 
60 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
- 
- 
pentoxifylline, propoxyphene, salicylates (such as acetylsalicylic acid, used to relieve pain and 
lower fever), 
sulfonamide antibiotics. 
Medicines that may cause your blood sugar level to rise (hyperglycaemia) include: 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
corticosteroids (such as "cortisone" used to treat inflammation), 
danazol (medicine acting on ovulation), 
diazoxide (used to treat high blood pressure), 
diuretics (used to treat high blood pressure or excessive fluid retention), 
glucagon (pancreas hormone used to treat severe hypoglycaemia), 
isoniazid (used to treat tuberculosis), 
oestrogens and progestogens (such as in the contraceptive pill used for birth control),  
phenothiazine derivatives (used to treat psychiatric disorders), 
somatropin (growth hormone), 
sympathomimetic medicines (such as epinephrine [adrenaline], salbutamol, terbutaline used to 
treat asthma), 
thyroid hormones (used to treat thyroid gland disorders),  
atypical antipsychotic medicines (such as clozapine, olanzapine), 
protease inhibitors (used to treat HIV). 
- 
- 
- 
Your blood sugar level may either rise or fall if you take: 
beta-blockers (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
clonidine (used to treat high blood pressure), 
- 
lithium salts (used to treat psychiatric disorders). 
- 
Pentamidine (used to treat some infections caused by parasites) may cause hypoglycaemia which may 
sometimes be followed by hyperglycaemia. 
Beta-blockers like other sympatholytic medicines (such as clonidine, guanethidine, and reserpine) may 
weaken or suppress entirely the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise a hypoglycaemia. 
If you are not sure whether you are taking one of those medicines ask your doctor or pharmacist. 
Lantus with alcohol 
Your blood sugar levels may either rise or fall if you drink alcohol. 
Pregnancy and breast-feeding 
Ask your doctor or pharmacist for advice before taking any medicine. 
Inform your doctor if you are planning to become pregnant, or if you are already pregnant. Your 
insulin dose may need to be changed during pregnancy and after giving birth. Particularly careful 
control of your diabetes, and prevention of hypoglycaemia, is important for the health of your baby. 
If you are breast-feeding consult your doctor as you may require adjustments in your insulin doses and 
your diet. 
Driving and using machines 
Your ability to concentrate or react may be reduced if: 
- 
- 
- 
you have hypoglycaemia (low blood sugar levels), 
you have hyperglycaemia (high blood sugar levels), 
you have problems with your sight. 
61 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Keep this possible problem in mind in all situations where you might put yourself and others at risk 
(such as driving a car or using machines). You should contact your doctor for advice on driving if: 
- 
- 
you have frequent episodes of hypoglycaemia, 
the first warning symptoms which help you to recognise hypoglycaemia are reduced or absent. 
Important information about some of the ingredients of Lantus 
This medicine contains less than 1 mmol (23 mg) sodium per dose, i.e. it is essentially ‘sodium-free’. 
3. 
How to use Lantus  
Always use this medicine exactly as your doctor has told you. Check with your doctor or pharmacist if 
you are not sure. 
Although Lantus contains the same active substance as Toujeo (insulin glargine 300 units/ml), these 
medicines are not interchangeable. The switch from one insulin therapy to another requires medical 
prescription, medical supervision and blood glucose monitoring. Please, consult your doctor for further 
information. 
Dose 
Based on your life-style and the results of your blood sugar (glucose) tests and your previous insulin 
usage, your doctor will 
- 
- 
- 
determine how much Lantus per day you will need and at what time. 
tell you when to check your blood sugar level, and whether you need to carry out urine tests,  
tell you when you may need to inject a higher or lower dose of Lantus. 
Lantus is a long-acting insulin. Your doctor may tell you to use it in combination with a short-acting 
insulin or with tablets used to treat high blood sugar levels. 
Many factors may influence your blood sugar level. You should know these factors so that you are 
able to react correctly to changes in your blood sugar level and to prevent it from becoming too high or 
too low. See the box at the end of this leaflet for further information. 
Use in children and adolescents 
Lantus can be used in adolescents and children aged 2 years and above. Use this medicine exactly as 
your doctor has told you. 
Frequency of administration 
You need one injection of Lantus every day, at the same time of the day.  
Method of administration 
Lantus is injected under the skin. Do NOT inject Lantus in a vein, since this will change its action and 
may cause hypoglycaemia.  
Your doctor will show you in which area of the skin you should inject Lantus. With each injection, 
change the puncture site within the particular area of skin that you are using.

How to handle SoloStar 
SoloStar is a pre-filled disposable pen containing insulin glargine. Lantus in pre-filled pen is only 
suitable for injecting just under the skin. Speak to your doctor if you need to inject your insulin by 
another method. 
Read carefully the "SoloStar Instructions for Use" included in this package leaflet. You must 
use the pen as described in these Instructions for Use.  
A new needle must be attached before each use. Only use needles that are compatible for use with 
SoloStar (see “SoloStar Instructions for Use”). 
A safety test must be performed before each injection. 
Look at the cartridge before you use the pen. Do not use SoloStar if you notice particles in it. Only use 
SoloStar if the solution is clear, colourless and waterlike. Do not shake or mix it before use. 
To prevent the possible transmission of disease, never share your pen with anyone else. This pen is 
only for your use. 
Make sure that neither alcohol nor other disinfectants or other substances contaminate the insulin.  
Always use a new pen if you notice that your blood sugar control is unexpectedly getting worse. If you 
think you may have a problem with SoloStar, consult your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
Empty pens must not be re-filled and must be properly discarded.  
Do not use SoloStar if it is damaged or not working properly, it has to be discarded and a new 
SoloStar has to be used. 
Insulin mix-ups 
You must always check the insulin label before each injection to avoid mix-ups between Lantus and 
other insulins.  
If you use more Lantus than you should 
− 
If you have injected too much Lantus, your blood sugar level may become too low 
(hypoglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. In general, to prevent hypoglycaemia you 
must eat more food and monitor your blood sugar. For information on the treatment of 
hypoglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
If you forget to use Lantus 
− 
− 
If you have missed a dose of Lantus or if you have not injected enough insulin, your blood 
sugar level may become too high (hyperglycaemia). Check your blood sugar frequently. For 
information on the treatment of hyperglycaemia, see box at the end of this leaflet. 
Do not take a double dose to make up for a forgotten dose. 
If you stop using Lantus 
This could lead to severe hyperglycaemia (very high blood sugar) and ketoacidosis (build-up of acid in 
the blood because the body is breaking down fat instead of sugar). Do not stop Lantus without 
speaking to a doctor, who will tell you what needs to be done. 
If you have any further questions on the use of this medicine, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse.

4. 
Possible side effects 
Like all medicines, this medicine can cause side effects, although not everybody gets them. 
If you notice signs of you blood sugar being too low (hypoglycaemia), take action to increase your 
blood sugar level straight away (see the box at the end of this leaflet). Hypoglycaemia (low blood 
sugar) can be very serious and is very common with insulin treatment (may affect more than 1 in 10 
people). Low blood sugar means that there is not enough sugar in your blood. If your blood sugar level 
falls too low, you may pass out (become unconscious). Serious hypoglycaemia may cause brain 
damage and may be life-threatening. For more information, see the box at the end of this leaflet. 
Severe allergic reactions (rare, may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people) – the signs may include 
large-scale skin reactions (rash and itching all over the body), severe swelling of skin or mucous 
membranes (angiooedema), shortness of breath, a fall in blood pressure with rapid heart beat and 
sweating. Severe allergic reactions to insulins may become life-threatening. Tell a doctor straight away 
if you notice signs of severe allergic reaction. 
 Skin changes at the injection site:  
• 
If you inject insulin too often at the same place, the skin may either shrink (lipoatrophy) (may affect up 
to 1 in 100 people) or thicken (lipohypertrophy) (may affect up to 1 in 10 people). Lumps under the 
skin may also be caused by build-up of a protein called amyloid (cutaneous amyloidosis; how often 
this occurs is not known). The insulin may not work very well if you inject into a lumpy area. Change 
the injection site with each injection to help prevent these skin changes. 
Skin and allergic reactions at the injection site 
Common reported side effects (may affect up to 1 in 10 people)  
• 
The signs may include reddening, unusually intense pain when injecting, itching, hives, swelling or 
inflammation. This can spread around the injection site. Most minor reactions to insulins usually 
disappear in a few days to a few weeks. 
Eye reactions 
Rare reported side effect (may affect up to 1 in 1,000 people)  
• 
A marked change (improvement or worsening) in your blood sugar control can disturb your vision 
temporarily. If you have proliferative retinopathy (an eye disease related to diabetes) severe 
hypoglycaemic attacks may cause temporary loss of vision. 
• 
In rare cases, insulin treatment may also cause temporary build-up of water in the body, with swelling 
in the calves and ankles. 
General disorders 
Very rare reported side-effects (may affect up to 1 in 10,000 people) 
In very rare cases, dysgeusia (taste disorders) and myalgia (muscular pain) can occur. 
Use in children and adolescents 
In general, the side effects in children and adolescents of 18 years of age or less are similar to those 
seen in adults. 
Complaints of injection site reactions (injection site reaction, injection site pain) and skin reactions 
(rash, urticaria) are reported relatively more frequently in children and adolescents of 18 years of age 
or less than in adults. 
There is no experience in children under 2 years. 
Reporting of side effects 
If you get any side effects, talk to your doctor or pharmacist. This includes any possible side effects 
not listed in this leaflet. You can also report side effects directly via the national reporting system 
listed in Appendix V. By reporting side effects you can help provide more information on the safety of 
this medicine.

HYPERGLYCAEMIA AND HYPOGLYCAEMIA 
Always carry some sugar (at least 20 grams) with you. 
Carry some information with you to show you are diabetic. 
HYPERGLYCAEMIA (high blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar is too high (hyperglycaemia), you may not have injected enough insulin. 
Why does hyperglycaemia occur?  
Examples include: 
- 
you have not injected your insulin or not injected enough, or if it has become less effective, for 
example through incorrect storage,  
your insulin pen does not work properly, 
you are doing less exercise than usual, you are under stress (emotional distress, excitement), or 
you have an injury, operation, infection or fever, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Lantus"). 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hyperglycaemia 
Thirst, increased need to urinate, tiredness, dry skin, reddening of the face, loss of appetite, low blood 
pressure, fast heart beat, and glucose and ketone bodies in urine . Stomach pain, fast and deep 
breathing, sleepiness or even loss of consciousness may be signs of a serious condition (ketoacidosis) 
resulting from lack of insulin.  
What should you do if you experience hyperglycaemia?  
Test your blood sugar level and your urine for ketones as soon as any of the above symptoms 
occur. Severe hyperglycaemia or ketoacidosis must always be treated by a doctor, normally in a 
hospital. 
HYPOGLYCAEMIA (low blood sugar levels) 
If your blood sugar level falls too much you may become unconscious. Serious hypoglycaemia may 
cause a heart attack or brain damage and may be life-threatening. You normally should be able to 
recognise when your blood sugar is falling too much so that you can take the right actions.  
Why does hypoglycaemia occur? 
Examples include: 
- 
- 
- 
you inject too much insulin, 
you miss meals or delay them, 
you do not eat enough, or eat food containing less carbohydrate than normal (sugar and 
substances similar to sugar are called carbohydrates; however, artificial sweeteners are NOT 
carbohydrates), 
you lose carbohydrates due to vomiting or diarrhoea, 
you drink alcohol, particularly if you are not eating much, 
you are doing more exercise than usual or a different type of physical activity, 
you are recovering from an injury or operation or other stress, 
you are recovering from an illness or from fever,  
you are taking or have stopped taking certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines 
and Lantus"). 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
68 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Hypoglycaemia is also more likely to occur if 
- 
you have just begun insulin treatment or changed to another insulin preparation (when changing 
from your previous basal insulin to Lantus hypoglycaemia, if it occurs, may be more likely to 
occur in the morning than at night), 
your blood sugar levels are almost normal or are unstable, 
you change the area of skin where you inject insulin (for example from the thigh to the upper 
arm), 
you suffer from severe kidney or liver disease, or some other disease such as hypothyroidism. 
- 
- 
- 
Warning symptoms of hypoglycaemia  
- In your body 
Examples of symptoms that tell you that your blood sugar level is falling too much or too fast: 
sweating, clammy skin, anxiety, fast heart beat, high blood pressure, palpitations and irregular 
heartbeat. These symptoms often develop before the symptoms of a low sugar level in the brain.  
- In your brain 
Examples of symptoms that indicate a low sugar level in the brain: headaches, intense hunger, nausea, 
vomiting, tiredness, sleepiness, sleep disturbances, restlessness, aggressive behaviour, lapses in 
concentration, impaired reactions, depression, confusion, speech disturbances (sometimes total loss of 
speech), visual disorders, trembling, paralysis, tingling sensations (paraesthesia), numbness and 
tingling sensations in the area of the mouth, dizziness, loss of self-control, inability to look after 
yourself, convulsions, loss of consciousness. 
The first symptoms which alert you to hypoglycaemia ("warning symptoms") may change, be weaker 
or may be missing altogether if 
- 
you are elderly, if you have had diabetes for a long time or if you suffer from a certain type of 
nervous disease (diabetic autonomic neuropathy), 
you have recently suffered hypoglycaemia (for example the day before) or if it develops slowly, 
you have almost normal or, at least, greatly improved blood sugar levels,  
you have recently changed from an animal insulin to a human insulin such as Lantus, 
you are taking or have taken certain other medicines (see section 2, "Other medicines and 
Lantus").  
- 
- 
- 
- 
In such a case, you may develop severe hypoglycaemia (and even faint) before you are aware of the 
problem. Be familiar with your warning symptoms. If necessary, more frequent blood sugar testing 
can help to identify mild hypoglycaemic episodes that may otherwise be overlooked. If you are not 
confident about recognising your warning symptoms, avoid situations (such as driving a car) in which 
you or others would be put at risk by hypoglycaemia. 
What should you do if you experience hypoglycaemia? 
1. 
2. 
3. 
4. 
Do not inject insulin. Immediately take about 10 to 20 g sugar, such as glucose, sugar cubes or a 
sugar-sweetened beverage. Caution: Artificial sweeteners and foods with artificial sweeteners 
(such as diet drinks) are of no help in treating hypoglycaemia. 
Then eat something that has a long-acting effect in raising your blood sugar (such as bread or 
pasta). Your doctor or nurse should have discussed this with you previously. 
The recovery of hypoglycaemia may be delayed because Lantus has a long action. 
If the hypoglycaemia comes back again take another 10 to 20 g sugar. 
Speak to a doctor immediately if you are not able to control the hypoglycaemia or if it recurs. 
69 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Tell your relatives, friends and close colleagues the following: 
If you are not able to swallow or if you are unconscious, you will require an injection of glucose or 
glucagon (a medicine which increases blood sugar). These injections are justified even if it is not 
certain that you have hypoglycaemia. 
It is advisable to test your blood sugar immediately after taking glucose to check that you really have 
hypoglycaemia.

Lantus SoloStar solution for injection in a pre-filled pen. INSTRUCTION FOR USE 
SoloStar is a pre-filled pen for the injection of insulin. Your doctor has decided that SoloStar is 
appropriate for you based on your ability to handle SoloStar. Talk with your doctor, pharmacist or 
nurse about proper injection technique before using SoloStar. 
Read these instructions carefully before using your SoloStar. If you are not able to use SoloStar or 
follow all the instructions completely on your own, you must use SoloStar only if you have help from 
a person who is able to follow the instructions completely. Hold the pen as shown in this leaflet. To 
ensure that you read the dose correctly, hold the pen horizontally, with the needle on the left and the 
dosage selector to the right as shown in the illustrations below. 
You can set doses from 1 to 80 units in steps of 1 unit. Each pen contains multiple doses. 
Keep this leaflet for future reference. 
If you have any questions about SoloStar or about diabetes, ask your doctor, pharmacist or nurse or 
call the local representative number on the front of this leaflet. 
Important information for use of SoloStar: 
Schematic diagram of the pen 
•  Always attach a new needle before each use. Only use needles that are compatible for use with 
SoloStar. 
•  Do not select a dose and/or press the injection button without a needle attached. 
•  Always perform the safety test before each injection (see Step 3). 
•  This pen is only for your use. Do not share it with anyone else.  
• 
If your injection is given by another person, special caution must be taken by this person to avoid 
accidental needle injury and transmission of infection. 
•  Never use SoloStar if it is damaged or if you are not sure that it is working properly.  
•  Always have a spare SoloStar in case your SoloStar is lost or damaged. 
Step 1. Check the insulin 
A. 
B. 
C. 
Check the label on your SoloStar to make sure you have the correct insulin. The Lantus Solostar 
is grey with a purple injection button. 
Take off the pen cap. 
Check the appearance of your insulin. Lantus is a clear insulin. Do not use this SoloStar if the 
insulin is cloudy, coloured or has particles. 
Step 2. Attach the needle 
Always use a new sterile needle for each injection. This helps prevent contamination, and potential 
needle blocks. 
A. 
Remove the protective seal from a new needle.  
71 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
B. 
Line up the needle with the pen, and keep it straight as you attach it (screw or push on, 
depending on the needle type). 
• 
If the needle is not kept straight while you attach it, it can damage the rubber seal and cause 
leakage, or break the needle. 
Step 3. Perform a Safety test  
Always perform the safety test before each injection. This ensures that you get an accurate dose by: 
• 
• 
ensuring that pen and needle work properly 
removing air bubbles 
A. 
Select a dose of 2 units by turning the dosage selector. 
B. 
Take off the outer needle cap and keep it to remove the used needle after injection. Take off the 
inner needle cap and discard it. 
C.  Hold the pen with the needle pointing upwards. 
D. 
Tap the insulin reservoir so that any air bubbles rise up towards the needle. 
72 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
E. 
Press the injection button all the way in. Check if insulin comes out of the needle tip. 
You may have to perform the safety test several times before insulin is seen.  
• 
• 
• 
If no insulin comes out, check for air bubbles and repeat the safety test two more times to 
remove them. 
If still no insulin comes out, the needle may be blocked. Change the needle and try again. 
If no insulin comes out after changing the needle, your SoloStar may be damaged. Do not use 
this SoloStar. 
Step 4. Select the dose 
You can set the dose in steps of 1 unit, from a minimum of 1 unit to a maximum of 80 units. If you 
need a dose greater than 80 units, you should give it as two or more injections. 
A. 
B. 
• 
• 
Check that the dose window shows “0” following the safety test. 
Select your required dose (in the example below, the selected dose is 30 units). If you turn past 
your dose, you can turn back down. 
Do not push the injection button while turning, as insulin will come out. 
You cannot turn the dosage selector past the number of units left in the pen. Do not force the 
dosage selector to turn. In this case, either you can inject what is remaining in the pen and 
complete your dose with a new SoloStar or use a new SoloStar for your full dose. 
Step 5. Inject the dose 
A.  Use the injection method as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
B. 
Insert the needle into the skin. 
73 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
C.  Deliver the dose by pressing the injection button in all the way. The number in the dose window 
will return to “0” as you inject. 
D.  Keep the injection button pressed all the way in. Slowly count to 10 before you withdraw the 
needle from the skin. This ensures that the full dose will be delivered. 
The  pen  plunger  moves  with  each  dose.  The  plunger  will  reach  the  end  of  the  cartridge  when  the 
total of 300 units of insulin has been used.  
Step 6. Remove and discard the needle 
Always remove the needle after each injection and store SoloStar without a needle attached. 
This helps prevent: 
• 
• 
Contamination and/or infection, 
Entry of air into the insulin reservoir and leakage of insulin, which can cause inaccurate dosing. 
A. 
• 
Put the outer needle cap back on the needle, and use it to unscrew the needle from the pen. To 
reduce the risk of accidental needle injury, never replace the inner needle cap. 
If your injection is given by another person, or if you are giving an injection to another person, 
special caution must be taken by this person when removing and disposing of the needle. Follow 
recommended safety measures for removal and disposal of needles (contact your doctor, 
pharmacist or nurse) in order to reduce the risk of accidental needle injury and transmission of 
infectious diseases. 
B.  Dispose of the needle safely, as instructed by your doctor, pharmacist or nurse. 
C.  Always put the pen cap back on the pen, then store the pen until your next injection. 
Storage instructions  
See the reverse (insulin) side of this leaflet for instructions on how to store SoloStar.  
If your SoloStar is in cool storage, take it out 1 to 2 hours before you inject to allow it to warm up. 
Cold insulin is more painful to inject. 
Discard your used SoloStar as required by your local authorities. 
Maintenance 
Protect your SoloStar from dust and dirt.  
You can clean the outside of your SoloStar by wiping it with a damp cloth. 
Do not soak, wash or lubricate the pen as this may damage it. 
It should be handled with care. Avoid situations where SoloStar might be damaged. If you are 
concerned that your SoloStar may be damaged, use a new one.

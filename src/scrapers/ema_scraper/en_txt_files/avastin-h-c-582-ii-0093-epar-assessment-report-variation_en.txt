Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision 
P/0005/2014 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP). 
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0005/2014 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0005/2014. 
1.2.  Rationale for the proposed change 
The MAH submitted paediatric study results performed in compliance with a paediatric investigational plan 
which does not support a paediatric indication. 
The MAH proposed an update of sections 4.2 Posology and method of administration, 4.8 Undesirable 
effects, 5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties and 5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties of the Avastin SmPC in order 
to update the safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic information based on the results from the paediatric 
HERBY study. 
As a consequence to the SmPC updates, section 2 of the package leaflet (PIL) has also been updated in line 
with the EU SmPC guideline. No updates to the labelling are foreseen.  
No updated RMP is included with this submission.

With the inclusion of the study results in the Avastin product information, the present submission will allow 
the MAH to fulfil the obligations agreed under the Paediatric Investigational Plan 
EMEA-000056-PIP03-10-MO2 in order to obtain the 6-month extension of the supplementary protection 
certificate reward as specified in article 36 of the Paediatric Regulation. 
2.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
The MAH has provided the CSR for study BO25041 that evaluated the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of 
bevacizumab when added to RT/T compared with RT/T alone in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed 
HGG. A previous interim CSR based on the first 60 randomized patients who were followed for 1 year did not 
meet 
the  protocol-specified 
threshold  of  10% 
improvement 
in  1-year  EFS 
rate 
in 
the 
bevacizumab-containing  arm,  therefore,  Study  BO25041  was  considered  futile.  However,  since  patient 
recruitment was completed and there was no safety concern, the iDMC recommendation was to continue 
treatment of ongoing patients as per protocol. The submitted CSR presented the updated analysis of the 
enrolled 121 patients in the main protocol who were followed for at least 1 year after randomization, unless 
patient withdrawal or death occurred. 
As also concluded by the MAH, the results from the interim analysis, the primary endpoint was not met and 
the updated analysis of EFS (CRRC-assessed) showed no improvement when bevacizumab was added to the 
RT/T arm compared with RT/T alone (HR = 1.44; 95% CI: 0.90, 2.30). These results were consistent in 
various  sensitivity  analyses  and  in  clinically  relevant  subgroups.  The  results  for  all  secondary  endpoints 
(investigator assessed EFS, and ORR and OS) were consistent in showing no improvement associated with 
the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  the  RT/T  arm  compared  with  the  RT/T  arm  alone.  Overall,  safety  was 
consistent to that expected with TMZ and RT with the addition of the known safety profile of bevacizumab, 
and there were no new safety signals identified. 
The use of Avastin in high grade glioma, being in the adult or paediatric population, is not an approved 
indication. At present section 4.2 of the SmPC states that; Avastin should not be used in children aged 3 
years to less than 18 years with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma because of efficacy concerns 
(see section 5.1 for results of paediatric trials).  
The legal requirement to inform in the SmPC about the paediatric development has been noted. With this 
variation application the MAH proposes updates to SmPC section 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 along with update to 
section 2 of the PIL in order to appropriately reflect the data. These changes are acceptable. Otherwise the 
overall benefit risks, in the approved indications remain positive. 
Scientific Summary for the EPAR 
4.2 Posology and method of administration 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of bevacizumab in children less than 18 years old have not been established. 
Currently available data are described in sections 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 but no recommendation on a posology can 
be made. 
There is no relevant use of bevacizumab in the paediatric population in the indications for treatment of 
cancers of the colon, rectum, breast, lung, ovarian, fallopian tube, peritoneum, cervix and kidney. 
4.8 Undesirable effects 
Paediatric population 
The safety and efficacy of Avastin in children less than 18 years old have not been established.

In study BO25041 of Avastin added to postoperative radiation therapy (RT) with concomitant and adjuvant 
temozolomide in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial, infratentorial, cerebellar, or 
peduncular high-grade glioma, the safety profile was comparable with that observed in other tumour types 
in adults treated with Avastin. 
5.1 Pharmacodynamic properties 
High-grade glioma 
In a randomized phase II study (BO25041) a total of 121 patients aged ≥ 3 years to <18 years with newly 
diagnosed supratentorial or infratentorial cerebellar or peduncular high-grade glioma (HGG) were treated 
with post-operative radiation therapy (RT) and adjuvant temozolomide (T) with and without bevacizumab: 
10 mg/kg every 2 weeks IV. 
 The study did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a significant improvement of EFS (Central 
Radiology Review Committee (CRRC)-assessed) when bevacizumab was added to the RT/T arm compared 
with RT/T alone (HR = 1.44; 95% CI: 0.90, 2.30). These results were consistent with those from various 
sensitivity analyses and in clinically relevant subgroups. The results for all secondary endpoints (investigator 
assessed EFS, and ORR and OS) were consistent in showing no improvement associated with the addition of 
bevacizumab to the RT/T arm compared with the RT/T arm alone. 
Addition of Avastin to RT/T did not demonstrate clinical benefit in study BO25041 in 60 evaluable children 
patients with newly diagnosed supratentorial or infratentorial cerebellar or peduncular high- grade glioma 
(HGG) (See section 4.2 for information on paediatric use). 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties  
Paediatric population 
The pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab were evaluated in 152 children, adolescents and young adults (7 
months to 21 years, 5.9 to 125 kg) across 4 clinical studies using a population pharmacokinetic model. The 
pharmacokinetic results show that the clearance and volume of distribution of bevacizumab were 
comparable between paediatric and young adult patients when normalised by body weight, with exposure 
trending lower as body weight decreased. Age was not associated with the pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab 
when body weight was taken into account. 
The pharmacokinetics of bevacizumab was well characterized by the paediatric population PK model for 70 
patients in Study BO20924 ((1.4 to 17.6 years; 11.6 to 77.5 kg) and 59 patients in Study BO25041 (1 to 17 
years; 11.2 to 82.3 kg). In Study BO20924, bevacizumab exposure was generally lower compared to a 
typical adult patient at the same dose. In Study BO25041, bevacizumab exposure was similar compared to 
a typical adult at the same dose. In both studies, bevacizumb exposure trended lower as body weight 
decreased.

Paediatric data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan P/0005/2014 and the results of these studies are reflected in the Summary of Product 
Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, the Package Leaflet. 
4.  Scientific discussion 
4.1.  Introduction 
On  23  August  2016,  the  MAH  submitted  a  completed  paediatric  study  BO25041  (HERBY)  for  Avastin,  in 
accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. The outcome of that procedure; 
EMEA/H/C/582/P46 0084, was adopted in November 2016. 
Study  BO25041  evaluated  the  efficacy,  safety,  tolerability,  and  PK  of  bevacizumab  when  added  to  RT/T 
compared  with  RT/T  alone  in  paediatric  patients  with  newly  diagnosed  HGG.  This  is  not  an  approved 
indication for bevacizumab. With this submission the MAH is providing the variation in order to update the 
SmPC with the legally required information on the paediatric development. With the inclusion of the study 
results in the Avastin product information, the present submission will allow the MAH to fulfil the obligations 
agreed  under  the  Paediatric  Investigational  Plan  EMEA-000056-PIP03-10-MO2  in  order  to  obtain  the 
6-month  extension  of  the  supplementary  protection  certificate  reward  as  specified  in  article  36  of  the 
Paediatric Regulation. 
4.2.  Clinical aspects 
4.2.1.  Introduction 
The MAH has submitted the study; HERBY (BO25041), as per article 46 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, as 
a paediatric study post authorization measure since it is included in a PIP (EMEA-C-000056-PIP03-10-M02). 
In addition, the results for the Young Patient Cohort substudy are presented. For the Young Patient Cohort, 
children  aged  ≥  6  months  to  <  3  years  with  localized  or  metastatic,  supratentorial  or  infratentorial,

non-brainstem WHO Grade III or IV high grade glioma (HGG) recurring or progressing after first-line therapy 
with surgery and chemotherapy received up to twelve 28-day cycles of TMZ and bevacizumab. Only children 
who could receive at least four 28-day cycles of combined TMZ and bevacizumab were considered for this 
substudy.  
4.2.2.  Clinical study 
Clinical  study  BO25041  (HERBY)  HGG  Efficacy  and  tolerability  Research  of  Bevacizumab  in 
Young children and adolescents. 
Study BO25041 
Study  BO25041  (HERBY:  HGG  Efficacy  and  tolerability  Research  of  Bevacizumab  in  Young  children  and 
adolescents)  is  an  open-label,  randomized,  multicenter,  comparator  Phase  II  study  of  the  addition  of 
bevacizumab to adjuvant chemoradiation with temozolomide (TMZ) followed by adjuvant TMZ in pediatric 
patients from ≥  3 years to < 18 years of age with newly diagnosed, localized, supratentorial or infratentorial 
cerebellar or peduncular high-grade glioma (HGG).  
Eligible patients who fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria and completed the screening assessments 
were randomized on a 1:1 basis to one of the two treatment arms: 
•  Arm  A  (RT/T  arm):    chemoradiation  with  TMZ  for  6  weeks,  then  a  TMZ  treatment  break  of 
approximately 4 weeks followed by up to 12 cycles (48 weeks) of TMZ 
•  Arm B (Bv + RT/T arm):  bevacizumab delivered concomitantly with chemoradiation and TMZ for 
6 weeks, during the TMZ treatment break of approximately 4 weeks, and thereafter concomitantly 
with adjuvant TMZ for up to 12 cycles (48 weeks)   
Randomization was stratified by age ( ≥ 3 to < 6 years, ≥ 6 to < 13 years, ≥ 13 to < 18 years), WHO Grade 
(Grade III vs. Grade IV) and type of surgery (total/near-total resection vs. others).  Patients with diffuse 
intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) were systematically excluded: the inclusion of patients with a peduncular 
tumor had to be validated by a central radiology review committee (CRRC) before randomization.   
The study duration was expected to be approximately 8 years, including a 36-month recruitment period, up 
to 58 weeks of treatment period, and 5 years of safety follow-up.  After randomization, patients were treated 
with concurrent TMZ and radiation therapy for 6 weeks without (Arm A) or with bevacizumab (Arm B).  After 
chemoradiation, a TMZ treatment break of approximately 4 weeks occurred during which bevacizumab was 
administered on Day 15 in Arm B.  After the TMZ break, patients received adjuvant TMZ for up to 12 cycles 
of  four  28-day  cycles  each  (up  to  48  weeks  of  adjuvant  period).    Treatment  continued  until  the 
protocol−defined  treatment  was  completed  or  until  an  EFS  event  was  observed,  unacceptable  toxicity 
occurred, or consent was withdrawn.   
In addition, the results for a Young Patient Cohort substudy were presented in this update analysis.  The 
Young Patient Cohort was not randomized. 
Randomized patients are being followed for a minimum of 5 years after randomization or until last patient 
last visit (LPLV), whichever occurs first.  
Overview of Efficacy 
Per the updated analysis, Study BO25041 did not meet its primary endpoint of demonstrating a significant 
improvement of EFS when bevacizumab was added to the RT/T arm compared with the RT/T arm alone:  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/59238/2017 
Page 7/13 
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
CRRC-assessed EFS: The hazard ratio (HR) was 1.44 (95% CI: 0.90, 2.30) and the Kaplan-Meier-estimated 
median EFS was 11.8 months (95% CI: 7.85, 16.39) in the RT/T arm and 8.2 months (95% CI: 7.75, 12.68) 
in the Bv + RT/T arm.  
The addition of bevacizumab to RT/T did not show a benefit in the primary endpoint, EFS, compared with 
RT/T alone. 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/59238/2017 
Page 8/13 
 
  
  
 
 
 
The  results  of  all  secondary  endpoints  were  consistent  in  showing  no  improvement  associated  with  the 
addition of bevacizumab to the RT/T arm compared with the RT/T arm alone:  
At 1 year, the Kaplan-Meier estimated event-free rates per CRRC were 48.4% (95% CI: 34.8%, 60.7%) in 
the RT/T arm and 38.3% (95% CI: 25.8%, 50.6%) in the Bv + RT/T arm  
The overall response rate (ORR) was comparable among evaluable patients between the treatment arms 
(40.0% RT/T [95% CI: 19.1%, 66.8%] vs. 41.7% Bv + RT/T [95% CI: 18.1%, 70.6%]) when structural 
imaging was used.  
Investigator-assessed EFS: The HR was 1.49 (95% CI: 0.92, 2.40), and the Kaplan-Meier-estimated median 
EFS was 11.8 months in the RT/T arm and 11.3 months in the Bv + RT/T arm. 
The OS HR was 1.23 (95% CI: 0.72, 2.09), with a Kaplan-Meier-estimated median OS of 27 months (95% 
CI: 14.0, 33.8) in the RT/T arm compared with 18.3 months (95% CI: 16.2, 28.1) in the Bv + RT/T arm. 
Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup  analyses  were  performed  for  CRRC-assessed  EFS  using  the  following  factors:  sex,  age  group, 
race, bone age group at baseline, WHO-defined grade of HGG, complete resection or biopsy, MGMT gene 
promoter status, histone mutation status, KPS scale score, and Lansky Play-Performance Status score. The 
results  of  the  subgroup  analyses  were  generally  consistent  with  the  results  of  the  randomized  patients 
population (Figure 7). The differences observed in some of the subgroups are most likely due to randomness 
considering the small number of patients. 
Overview of Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetics  (PK)  of  bevacizumab  for  the  PK-evaluable  pediatric  patients  (n = 59)  from 
Study BO25041  were  well  characterized  by  a  comprehensive  pediatric  PopPK  model  that  was  previously 
developed with data from 152 pediatric patients across four clinical studies.  These 59 PK-evaluable patients 
included 3 patients in the Young Patient Cohort.  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/59238/2017 
Page 9/13 
 
  
  
 
 
Covariates associated with bevacizumab PK in pediatric patients were similar to those found with adults with 
body  weight  (BW),  gender,  and  albumin  levels  having  significant  impact  on  bevacizumab  exposure.    In 
addition, pediatric patients with primary central nervous system tumors (e.g., Study AVF3842s/PBTC022 
and Study BO25041) were also found to be a specific PK associated covariate in the pediatric PopPK model.  
No other PK-associated covariates were observed for patients in Study BO25041.  Importantly, age was not 
found to be associated with bevacizumab PK when BW was taken into account. 
Bevacizumab  exposure  in  PK-evaluable  pediatric  patients  was  found  to  generally  fall  within  the  90% 
prediction  intervals  of  adults  when  administered the  same  dose  regimen  (10 mg/kg  twice  weekly)  as  in 
Study  BO25041  with  a  downward  trend  in  exposure  as  BW  (age)  decreases.    Lower  exposure  with 
decreasing BW was expected due to the influence of BW on PK parameters described in the comprehensive 
pediatric PopPK model.

OVERVIEW OF SAFETY 
Overall, safety was consistent with that expected of radiotherapy and TMZ  use, with the addition of the 
established safety profile of bevacizumab therapy.  No new safety signals were identified for bevacizumab in 
this pediatric study.   
The incidence of Grade ≥ 3 AEs was similar between treatment arms, although the incidences of Grade ≥ 3 
AESIs and SAEs were higher in the Bv + RT/T arm.   
AEs leading to withdrawal of study treatment occurred at a higher incidence in the Bv + RT/T arm and were 
mainly driven by proteinuria, an identified AESI of bevacizumab.

Young Patient Cohort 
The  Young  Patient  Cohort  was  comprised  of  children  aged ≥ 6  months  to < 3  years  with  localized  or 
metastatic,  supratentorial  or  infratentorial,  non-brainstem  WHO  Grade  III  or  IV  HGG  recurring  or 
progressing after first-line therapy with surgery and chemotherapy received up to twelve 28-day cycles of 
TMZ and bevacizumab.  Only children who could receive at least four 28-day cycles of combined TMZ and 
bevacizumab were considered for this substudy. Three patients were enrolled. CRRC-assessed time to EFS 
for the 3 patients were 50 days, 90 days, and 545* days (*censored observation), respectively.  Among 
these patients the majority of the AEs reported were of Grade 1 or Grade 2 severity, with the exception of 
two Grade 3 AEs in two patients: decreased platelet count and decreased neutrophil count. 
Impact on product information 
Study  BO25041  failed  to  meet  its  primary  endpoint  and  no  new  safety  signals  have  been  identified.  
Therefore, the marketing authorization holder will not seek an indication nor amend existing indications.  
The  data  included  in  this  submission  do  not  affect  the  benefit-risk  balance  and  therefore  do  not  require 
further  regulatory  action  on  the  marketing  authorization.    However,  with  this Type  II  variation  the  MAH 
intends  to  update the  SmPC  with  results  from  Study  BO25041  and  fulfill  the  obligations  for  the  Avastin 
Paediatric investigation Plan (EMEA-000056-PIP03-10-M02). 
Conclusions  
Study  BO25041  did  not  meet  its  primary  endpoint  of  significantly  improved  CRRC-assessed  EFS  when 
bevacizumab was added to the RT/T arm compared with RT/T alone (HR = 1.44; 95% CI: 0.90, 2.30).  These 
results were consistent in various sensitivity analyses and in clinically relevant subgroups.   
The results for all secondary endpoints (investigator assessed EFS, and ORR and OS) were consistent in 
showing no improvement associated with the addition of bevacizumab to the RT/T arm compared with the 
RT/T arm alone.  
Overall, safety in Study BO25041 was consistent with that expected with TMZ and RT with the addition of the 
known safety profile of bevacizumab, and there were no new safety signals identified.  
 Pharmacokinetics results indicated that bevacizumab exposure in pediatric patients tends to decrease with 
decreasing BW, although exposure in pediatric patients from Study BO25041 was similar to adult exposure 
following a similar dose and regimen.  Body weight, sex, and serum albumin concentration were significant 
covariates associated with bevacizumab PK in pediatric patients in this study, and are in agreement with 
covariates identified in previous pediatric and adult studies.  The presence of primary CNS tumors was found 
to be a specific covariate associated with pediatric PK.  Age was not found to be associated with bevacizumab 
PK when BW was taken into account.   
4.2.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
The MAH has provided the CSR for study BO25041 that evaluated the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and PK of 
bevacizumab when added to RT/T compared with RT/T alone in paediatric patients with newly diagnosed 
HGG. A previous interim CSR based on the first 60 randomized patients who were followed for 1 year did not 
meet 
the  protocol-specified 
threshold  of  10% 
improvement 
in  1-year  EFS 
rate 
in 
the 
bevacizumab-containing  arm,  therefore,  Study  BO25041  was  considered  futile.  However,  since  patient 
recruitment was completed and there was no safety concern, the iDMC recommendation was to continue 
treatment of ongoing patients as per protocol. The submitted CSR presented the updated analysis of the 
enrolled 121 patients in the main protocol who were followed for at least 1 year after randomization, unless 
patient withdrawal or death occurred.

As also concluded by the MAH, the results from the interim analysis, the primary endpoint was not met and 
the updated analysis of EFS (CRRC-assessed) showed no improvement when bevacizumab was added to the 
RT/T arm compared with RT/T alone (HR = 1.44; 95% CI: 0.90, 2.30). These results were consistent in 
various  sensitivity  analyses  and  in  clinically  relevant  subgroups.  The  results  for  all  secondary  endpoints 
(investigator assessed EFS, and ORR and OS) were consistent in showing no improvement associated with 
the  addition  of  bevacizumab  to  the  RT/T  arm  compared  with  the  RT/T  arm  alone.  Overall,  safety  was 
consistent to that expected with TMZ and RT with the addition of the known safety profile of bevacizumab, 
and there were no new safety signals identified. 
The use of Avastin in high grade glioma, being in the adult or paediatric population, is not an approved 
indication. At present section 4.2 of the SmPC states that; Avastin should not be used in children aged 3 
years to less than 18 years with recurrent or progressive high-grade glioma because of efficacy concerns 
(see section 5.1 for results of paediatric trials).  
The legal requirement to inform in the SmPC about the paediatric development has been noted. With this 
variation application the MAH proposes updates to SmPC section 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 along with update to 
section 2 of the PIL in order to appropriately reflect the data. These changes are acceptable. Otherwise the 
overall benefit risk, in the approved indications remain positive. 
4.3.  Changes to the Product Information 
As a result of this variation, section(s) 4.2, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC are being updated. The Package 
Leaflet (PL) is updated accordingly. 
Please refer to Attachment 1 which includes all agreed changes to the Product Information.

1.  Introduction 
On 20th June 2018, the MAH submitted a completed paediatric study for delamanid, in accordance with 
Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
These  data  are  generated  as  part  of  the  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP)  for  delamanid  (Deltyba) 
agreed upon by the European Medicines Agency’s decision P/275/2011 on 11 November 2011. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Information on the development program 
The  MAH  stated  that  Study  242-12-232    (Phase  1,  Open-label,  Multiple-dose,  and  Age  De-escalation 
Trial to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Delamanid [OPC-67683] in Paediatric 
Multidrug-resistant  Tuberculosis  Patients  on  Therapy  with  an  Optimized  Background  Regimen  of 
Antituberculosis Drugs) is part of a clinical development program. The extension application consisting 
of the full relevant data package (containing several studies) is expected to be submitted by 05/20. A 
line listing of all the concerned studies is annexed. 
2.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Delamanid  was  granted  conditional  marketing  authorisation  in  the  EU  via  a  centralised  procedure  in 
2014. This authorisation was renewed in February 2018. It is currently registered and approved in 39 
countries but not currently licensed in the US.  Delamanid is indicated for use as part of an appropriate 
combination  regimen  for  the  treatment  of  pulmonary  multi-drug  resistant  tuberculosis  (MDR-TB)  in 
adults  only,  when  an  effective  treatment  regimen  cannot  otherwise  be  composed  for  reasons  of 
resistance or tolerability. It is not currently licensed for use in children since the safety and efficacy of 
delamanid in children below 18 years of aged have not yet been established.  
In  Study  242-12-232,  delamanid  was  administered  to  paediatric  MDR-TB  subjects  on  optimised 
background regimen (OBR) therapy and was supplied in labelled blister cards as 5 mg, 25 mg, and 50 
mg tablets. Delamanid 50 mg  film-coated tablets is the currently licensed adult formulation and  was 
administered to children from the age of 6 years. For patients younger than 6 years, specific paediatric  
formulations,  developed  as  part  of  an  agreed  PIP,  were  used.  A  dispersible  25mg  tablet  was 
administered  to  children  aged  3  to  5  years  and  a  5  mg  dispersible  delamanid  paediatric  formulation 
(DPF) was given to children under the age of 3 years. The DPF was mixed with water and administered 
orally as an extemporaneous suspension.  
Delamanid  was  administered  with  water  and  food  in  both  a  morning  and  an  evening  dose, 
approximately 10 hours apart. Food composition was typical for the children’s age and needs. 
Assessor’s comments:  
Study  242-12-232  is  part  of  a  Paediatric  Investigation  Plan  (PIP),  first  agreed  by  the  Paediatric 
Committee (PDCO) in November 2011. There were  5 subsequent modifications, the last modification, 
EMEA-001113-PIP01-10-M05,  was  agreed  in  the  August  2016.  The  latest  EMA  decision  for  this 
modified PIP, P/0269/2016, was published on 7th October 2016. The indication targeted for paediatric 
development is the “treatment of multi drug resistant tuberculosis.” There are no waivers agreed in the 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006

PIP for the development for this product. 
The PIP contains 5 studies: 1 paediatric formulation development study, a juvenile toxicity assessment 
and 3 clinical studies. Trial 242-12-232 is study 4 of the agreed PIP. All studies are completed with the 
exception  of  the  6-month  open  label  extension  trial  which  is  currently  ongoing  and  due  to  be 
completed by November 2019.  
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH submitted a final report for: 
• 
Trial  242-12-232:  Phase  1,  Open-label,  Multiple-dose,  Age  De-escalation  Trial  to  Assess  the 
Pharmacokinetics,  Safety,  and  Tolerability  of  Delamanid  (OPC-67683)  in  Paediatric  Multidrug-
resistant Tuberculosis Patients on Therapy with an Optimised Background regimen (OBR). 
2.3.2.  Clinical study 
Trial  242-12-232:  Phase  1,  Open-label,  Multiple-dose,  Age  De-escalation 
Trial to Assess the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Tolerability of Delamanid 
(OPC-67683)  in  Paediatric  Multidrug-resistant  Tuberculosis  Patients  on 
Therapy with an Optimised Background regimen.  
Description 
Trial  242-12-232  was  a  phase  1,  multicentre,  open-label,  uncontrolled,  multiple-dose,  age  de-
escalation  trial  to  assess  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  delamanid  in  paediatric  subjects  with  MDR-TB 
who were also receiving OBR. The goal of this trial was to define the paediatric dose for delamanid in 
children  from  birth  (0)  to  17  years  of  age  that  results  in  delamanid  plasma  exposure  similar  to  the 
plasma  exposure  in  adult  patients  that  has  been  demonstrated  to  be  safe  and  effective  for  the 
treatment of Multidrug-resistant Tuberculosis (MDR-TB). 
Methods 
Objectives 
• 
• 
• 
To  determine  the  PK  of  delamanid  and  its  metabolites  in  combination  with  OBR  in  paediatric 
MDR-TB subjects. 
To  determine  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  delamanid  in  combination  with  OBR  in  paediatric 
MDR-TB subjects. 
To determine the palatability of the delamanid paediatric formulation. 
Study design 
This  trial  was  conducted  at  two  (2)  Phase  1  sites  qualified  to  treat  paediatric  subjects  with  MDR-TB. 
The protocol was approved by the appropriate national competent authorities (CAs) and the respective 
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
Deltyba

IRBs/IECs. Compliance with any other regional or local notification or approval requirements was met 
and maintained. 
The trial was conducted sequentially in 4 groups of paediatric subjects: Group 1 (ages 12 – 17 years, 
inclusive, n = 7 ), Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive, n = 6), Group 3 (ages 3 – 5 years, inclusive, 
n = 12), Group 4 (ages birth - 2 years, inclusive, n = 12). 
Subjects who dropped out or who completed this trial (Trial 242-12-232) and decided not to participate 
in the 6-month extension trial (Trial 242-12-233) were replaced. 
The study population included male and female subjects between birth and 17 years of age, inclusive, 
with  a  confirmed  diagnosis  of  MDR  TB  culture  positive  for  Mycobacterium  tuberculosis  (MTB)  with 
isoniazid  and  rifampicin  resistance  on  drug  sensitivity  testing  (DST),  or  a  positive  rapid  test 
demonstrating  resistance  to  rifampicin  alone,  or  to  rifampicin  and  isoniazid,  OR  a  presumptive 
diagnosis  of  pulmonary  or  extrapulmonary  MDR-TB,  such  that  the  treating  physician  had  decided  to 
treat the subject for MDR-TB. Subjects also had one of the following criteria:  
1) Clinical specimen (e.g., cerebrospinal fluid [CSF], pleural fluid, ascitic fluid, lymph node aspirate, or 
other tissue) suggestive of tuberculosis disease;  
2) Persistent cough lasting > 2 weeks;  
3) Fever, weight loss, and failure to thrive;  
4) Findings on recent chest radiograph (prior to Visit 1) consistent with TB;  
5)  AND  household  contact  with  a  person  with  known  MDR-TB  or  with  a  person  who  died  while 
appropriately  taking  drugs  for  sensitive  TB;  OR  on  first-line  TB  treatment  but  with  no  clinical 
improvement.  
6) Negative urine pregnancy test for female subjects who had reached menarche. 
Trial-specific  written  informed  consent/assent  obtained  from  a  subject/guardian  or  legally  acceptable 
representative,  as  applicable  for local laws  prior  to the  initiation  of  any  protocol-required  procedures. 
In addition, for Groups 1 and 2, the subjects were required provide informed nod at screening and be 
able to fully understand that he or she were able to withdraw from the trial at any time. 
The trial comprised the following periods: 
Pre-treatment Period 
•  Screening and eligibility assessment from Day −22 to Day −2 (Groups 1, 2, and 3); Day −31 
to Day −2 (Group 4). 
•  Baseline safety assessment on Day −1. 
Treatment Period: Day 1 to Day 18 
•  Delamanid administration from Day 1 to Day 10 
• 
PK sampling on Days 1, 2, 10, 11, 13 (Groups 1 and 2 only), 15, and 18 
•  Safety assessments on Days 1, 10 (clinical laboratory tests and urinalysis were conducted only 
for Groups 1 and 2), and 18 
•  Discharge on Day 18 after completing all assessments 
Follow-up Period: Day 19 to Day 40 (± 2 days)

All subjects who completed their last scheduled visit were contacted by telephone 28 to 30 days after 
the  last  dose  of  delamanid  to  assess  any  new  or  ongoing  adverse  events  (AEs).  This  follow-up 
telephone contact occurred on Day 40 (± 2 days). Subjects who terminated from the trial prior to their 
last scheduled visit were contacted by telephone or home visit 14 days (± 2 days) after the last dose 
of delamanid to assess for any new or ongoing AEs. 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 44 subjects were screened for this trial. The trial enrolled 37 males and females ages birth to 
17 years, inclusive, who  were receiving OBR for confirmed or presumptive MDR-TB. Subjects were to 
be enrolled in 4 sequential age groups.  
•  Group  1  (ages  12  -  17  years,  inclusive)  was  expected  to  enrol  a  minimum  of  6  subjects  and 
must have enrolled at least 2, but not more than 5, females.  
•  Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive) was expected to enrol a minimum of 6 subjects.  
•  Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years, inclusive) and Group 4 (ages birth - 2 years, inclusive) each were 
expected to enrol a minimum of 12 subjects.  
Thirty-seven  subjects  inclusive  of  all  age  and  dose  groups  completed  this  trial.  All  enrolled  subjects 
who completed Trial 242-12-232 were rolled over to Trial 242-12-233, an open-label, uncontrolled, 6-
month extension trial to evaluate the long-term safety, tolerability, and PK of delamanid administered 
BID  for Groups 1, 2, and  3; and once or twice daily, depending upon body weight for Group 4, for 6 
months  in  paediatric  subjects  with  MDR-TB.  Trial  242-12-233  was  initiated  as  required  under  the 
approved Paediatric Investigation Plan. 
Treatments 
Delamanid  was  administered  to  study  subjects  for  10  days  with  8  days  of  safety  follow-up  and  PK 
sampling.  
Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive) received adult formulation delamanid 100 mg dosing twice per 
day (BID) + OBR (n = 7) 
Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive) received adult formulation delamanid 50 mg BID + OBR (n = 6) 
Group  3  (ages  3  -  5  years,  inclusive)  received  delamanid  paediatric  formulation  (DPF)  25  mg  BID  + 
OBR (n = 12) 
Group 4 (ages birth - 2 years, inclusive) received the following DPF dose based on body weight during 
baseline visit (n = 12): 
•  Subjects > 10 kg received DPF 10 mg BID + OBR 
•  Subjects > 8 and ≤ 10 kg received DPF 5 mg BID + OBR 
•  Subjects ≥ 5.5 kg and ≤ 8 kg received DPF 5 mg QD + OBR 
The  morning  dose  of  the  delamanid  BID  regimen  was  given  within  30  minutes  after  the  start  of  a 
standard breakfast meal. The evening dose of the BID dose regimen was given 10 hours post morning 
dose and within 30 minutes after the start of a standard dinner meal. For the QD regimen, delamanid 
was administered within 30 minutes after the start of a standard breakfast meal. Food composition was 
typical for the children’s age and needs.

The  second-line  medications  generally  used  in  developing  OBR  for  MDR-TB  subject  treatment  are  as 
follows: 
•  Amikacin 
•  Capreomycin 
•  Cycloserine 
• 
• 
• 
Ethambutol 
Ethionamide 
Prothionamide 
•  Gatifloxacin 
• 
Levofloxacin 
•  Kanamycin 
•  Ofloxacin 
• 
• 
P-aminosalicylic acid 
Pyrazinamide 
•  Streptomycin 
Medications with an unclear role in the treatment of MDR-TB and not recommended for routine use for 
MDR-TB  treatment,  though  sometimes  used  for  highly  drug-resistant  MDR-TB  subjects,  are  described 
in  the  WHO  Treatment  Guidelines  for  MDR-TB.  Moxifloxacin  was  excluded  from  the  list  of  allowed 
medications. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
For  each  subject,  the  following  PK  parameters  were  determined  for  delamanid  and  delamanid 
metabolite (DM-6705): 
•  Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24h on Day 1 and Day 10 
• 
t ½ z on Day 10 
•  Rac Day 10/Day 1 for AUC0-24h, and apparent total clearance (CLss/F) for delamanid only 
Safety of delamanid was assessed by the following variables: 
•  Reported treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) 
•  Vital signs 
• 
ECGs 
•  Holter monitoring (if applicable) 
•  Clinical  laboratory  assessments  (haematology,  serum  chemistry,  urinalysis,  and  other 
laboratory tests) 
The  palatability  of  the  paediatric  formulation  was  assessed  using  an  age-appropriate  visual  hedonic 
scale and clinical assessment.  
Assessment report for paediatric studies submitted according to Article 46 of the 
Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 
Deltyba 
Page 8/20 
 
 
 
 
 
The  palatability  result  was  based  on  one  of  5  responses:  Dislike  very  much,  Dislike  a  little,  Neither 
liked  nor  disliked,  Like  a  little,  Like  very  much.  The  test  was  assessed  only  for  Groups  3  and  4 
receiving  the  delamanid  paediatric  formulation.  The  test  result  was  scored  by  the  investigator  and 
either a parent or subject score. The frequency counts for subject with each score were summarized at 
visits that palatability is assessed (Day 1, Day10 and ET). 
Statistical Methods 
Determination of Sample Size: 
This was a phase 1, open-label trial to assess the PK parameters, safety and tolerability of delamanid. 
No formal statistical hypothesis testing was planned. Thus, no formal sample size calculation based on 
statistical power was required. All statistical presentations are descriptive. 
Subject Samples: 
• 
Enrolled Sample: comprised all subjects who signed informed consent to enrol into the current 
trial and without screen failure. 
•  Safety  Sample:  comprised  the  subjects  who  had  received  any  amount  of  trial  medication  in 
Trial 242-12-232, regardless of any protocol deviation or violation. 
• 
PK Sample: consisted of the safety sample having a valid PK parameter. 
The following delamanid PK parameters were determined using noncompartmental analysis: 
• 
Peak  (maximal)  concentration  of  drug  in  plasma  (Cmax),  time  of  peak  concentration  of  drug 
(tmax), area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time 0 to 24 hours (AUC0-24h) 
on Day 1 and Day 10 
•  Accumulation ratio Day 10/Day 1 for AUC0-24h 
•  Apparent terminal phase elimination half-life (t1/2z) and apparent total clearance 
Delamanid  plasma  concentrations  across  age  groups  will  be  analysed  using  a  population 
pharmacokinetics (POPPK) modelling approach, which will be reported separately. 
PK analysis of delamanid metabolite (DM-6705) plasma concentrations was performed where feasible. 
• 
The following PK parameters were determined for DM-6705 using noncompartmental analysis: 
Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24h on Day 1 and Day 10 and t1/2z. 
Plasma  concentrations  and  PK  parameters  when  determined,  were  reported with  descriptive  statistics 
in the PK report. No prior inferential statistical comparisons were performed. 
Safety  parameters  were  summarized  by  incidence  rates  and  their  change  from  baseline  if  applicable. 
Change  from  baseline  was  summarized  for  observed  cases  at  each  scheduled  post-baseline  visit  and 
for the last visit.

A total of 44 subjects were screened for this trial. The trial included 37 males and females ages birth to 
17 years, inclusive, who were receiving OBR for confirmed or presumptive MDR-TB were enrolled in 4 
sequential age groups. Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive), Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive), 
Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years, inclusive) and Group 4 (ages birth - 2 years, inclusive) each were planned 
to include a minimum of 12 subjects. 
Thirty-seven subjects inclusive of all age and dose groups completed this trial. 
Baseline data 
Overall, the subjects enrolled were predominantly Asian (25 of 37 [67.6%]). The total number of male 
and  female  subjects  were  approximately  equal  (18  of  37  subjects  were  male  [48.6%]  and  19  of  37 
subjects  were  female  [51.4%]).  The  mean  ages  of  Group  1,  2,  3  and  4  were  15.29,  9.42,  4.28,  and 
1.64  years,  respectively.  The  mean  weight  of  Group  1,  2,  3,  and  4  were  39.0,  24.9,  14.2,  9.8  kg, 
respectively. 
Bioanalytical Results 
A total of 582 plasma samples were received by the bioanalytical laboratory. Concentration results for 
delamanid  and  DM-6705  were  generated  for  556  samples;  the  remaining  26  samples  were  backups 
and were not analysed. 
Efficacy results 
There are no efficacy results. 
Assessor’s comments: 
A  total of  2  subjects  had  2  major  protocol  deviations  that  pertained to  entry criteria.  No  subject  was 
discontinued due to a protocol deviation and none of the protocol deviations were determined to have 
an impact on the study analyses. 
This  study  was  designed  to  assess  the  PK  safety  and  tolerability  of  delamanid  in  the  paediatric 
population.  There  were  no  efficacy  analyses  and  thus  no  conclusions  on  the  treatment  effect  of 
delamanid use in children can be made.  
Pharmacokinetic results 
Median plasma delamanid concentration versus time profiles following oral doses of delamanid on Day 
1 and Day 10 to paediatric subjects with MDR-TB (Group 1 - 100 mg BID, Group 2 - 50 mg BID, Group 
3  -  25  mg  BID,  Group  4  -  5  to  20  mg)  are  presented  in  Figure  1  and  Figure  2.  Pharmacokinetic 
assessment of CSF was not conducted.

In  Groups  1  to  4,  the  median  delamanid  Cmax  on  Day  10  was  557,  573,  500,  and  179  ng/mL, 
respectively;  the  median  AUC0-24h  on  Day  10  was  9790,  12000,  9290,  and  2740  ng*h/mL, 
respectively. The Cmax and the AUC0-24h ranges were reasonably similar for Groups 1 to 3 but were 
much lower for Group 4. 
The  MAH  notes  that  the  ratio of  AUC0-24h  on  Day  10  of  DM-6705 to  delamanid  appears  to  decrease 
with decreasing age, indicating that either the formation of DM-6705 is decreasing or its elimination is 
increasing or a combination of the two scenarios. The median terminal elimination half-life of DM-6705 
was  237.3  hours  in  Group  1  and  128.2  hours  for  Group  4,  indicating  a  more  rapid  elimination  with 
decreasing age. 
In  order  to  compare  the  exposures  across  the  groups,  the  weight  normalized  oral  clearance,  was 
calculated  for  each  regimen.  The  median  weight-normalized  oral  clearance  on  Day  10  for  delamanid 
was 8.92, 6.11, 6.68, and 8.34 for Groups 1 to 4, respectively. 
The results indicated that the clearances for all groups, including most subjects in Group 4, were within 
a narrow range and the lower exposures observed in Group 4 were due to this group receiving lower 
doses of delamanid. 
Assessor’s comments:  
No  subjects  had  missing  PK  data.  Delamanid  exposures  in  children  aged  2  years  to  <18  years  in 
Groups  1  to  3,  were  comparable  to  each  other  but  higher  than  in  adults.  When  considering  all  age 
groups, delamanid exposures were the lowest for the youngest children aged from birth to less than 2 
years (Group 4).  
The dosing regimen for Group 4 was determined by modelling PK data from the previous three groups 
and it was thus expected that the delamanid doses used would have a higher predicted bioavailability 
for  children  in  this  age  cohort.  However,  the  current  data  suggest  that  a  higher  delamanid  dose  is 
needed in the youngest children.  
There  is  a  trend  for  more  rapid  elimination  with  decreasing  age,  but  the  effect  of food  on  absorption 
and  plasma  exposure  might  be  a  significant  factor  for  lower  delamanid  exposure  in  this  age  group. 
Although there were no efficacy nor PK/PD analyses performed in this study, the dose administered in

the youngest cohort could potentially result in sub-optimal exposures, with a reduction in cures rates in 
young children and might encourage the development of microbiological resistance. A discussion of the 
effect of food on delamanid exposure in young infants, should be considered for inclusion in the SmPC 
when the MAH submits their application to extend the indication to children.   
These  data  are  proposed  to  update  the  model  used  to  predict  the  dose  in  young  children.  This  is 
acceptable, however, further data may have to be generated to confirm if the updated dosing regimen 
has  similar  exposure  and  safety  profile  to  older  children  and  adults,  to  support  the  extrapolation  of 
efficacy from adults.  
The data support further paediatric development but at this stage, do not fully determine the benefit: 
risk of delamanid in the paediatric population.  
Safety results 
•  All 37 subjects (100%) enrolled in the trial received all doses of IMP for 10 days. Overall safety 
results for this open-label, multiple-dose, and age de-escalating trial of 37 subjects showed: 
•  No subject had a fatal outcome during the trial and no subject discontinued the trial. 
•  Overall a total of 126 TEAEs were reported by 31 of 37 subjects (83.8%). 
• 
The  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs  were  vomiting  (9  of  37  subjects  [24.3%])  followed  by 
hyperuricaemia (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]), nausea (5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]), and toothache 
(5 of 37 subjects [13.5%]). 
•  All 12 subjects (100.0%) aged 0 to 2 years experienced ≥ 1 TEAE during the trial followed by 9 
of 12 subjects (75.0%) aged 3 to 5 years, 5 of 6 subjects (83.3%) aged 6 to 11 years, and 5 
of  7  subjects  (71.4%)  aged  12  to  17.  There  was  no  clinically  meaningful  difference  of  TEAE 
incidences across all age groups. 
•  Most  TEAEs  were  mild  or moderate  in  intensity  except  for the  TEAE  of  lower  respiratory  tract 
infection, which was considered to be severe in intensity. 
• 
Two  subjects  (5.4%)  each  had  a  SAE;  for  one  subject  the  SAE  was  hepatitis  A  (aged  3to  5 
years)  and  for  the  other  subject  the  SAE  was  lower  respiratory  tract  infection  (aged  0  -  2 
years). Both SAEs were not related to IMP. 
•  Of 37, 9 subjects (24.3%) subjects experienced ≥ 1 TEAE that was related to the IMP; the most 
frequently  reporting  terms  were  diarrhoea  (2  subjects  [5.4%])  and  ECG  QT  prolongation  (2 
subjects [5.4%]). 
•  All IMP-related TEAEs were mild or moderate in severity. 
• 
There were no IMP-related TEAEs experienced by subjects aged 12 to 17 years and 3 subjects 
each from all other age groups reported IMP-related TEAEs. There were no clinically meaningful 
differences between the age groups. 
•  Overall, eosinophilia (2 of 37 subjects (5.4%]; 1 subject aged 3 - 5 and 1 subject aged 0 - 2) 
and neutropenia (1 of 37 subjects (2.7%]; 1 subject aged 3 - 5) were the TEAEs reported for 
blood  and  lymphatic  system  disorders.  One  incidence  of  eosinophilia  and  neutropenia  were 
assessed as IMP-related TEAEs.

•  Concurrent  elevation  of  transaminases  (≥  3  ×  ULN)  and  bilirubin  levels  (≥  2  ×  ULN)  was 
experienced by 1 subject (2.7%) with diagnosed hepatitis A. 
•  No  subject  had  an  abnormal  physical  examination  finding  that  was  considered  to  be  clinically 
significant. 
• 
Potentially clinically significant abnormalities in vital signs only included changes ≥ 5% in body 
weight for 8 subjects across all age groups. A decrease ≥ 5% in body weight was only reported 
for  1  of  37  subjects  (2.7%).  An  increase  of  ≥  5%  in  body  weight  was  reported  for  7  of  37 
subjects (18.9%) which can be considered as a benefit for the purpose of this trial. 
•  Overall,  2  of  12  subjects  (16.7%)  aged  3  to  5  years  experienced  TEAEs  related  to  ECGs;  1 
subject experienced PR prolongation, QT prolongation, and presence of U  wave and the other 
subject experienced QT prolongation. These incidences were reported as IMP-related TEAEs. 
•  No  clinically  relevant  differences  were  noted  for  clinical  laboratory  results,  ECGs,  vital  signs, 
physical findings, or other observations relating to safety parameters a13.  
Assessor’s comments:  
Most paediatric patients in this study reported adverse events (AE’s). However, none of the AEs led to 
discontinuation of delamanid or to a fatal outcome during the trial. Only 2 patients had TEAEs classed 
as serious: 1 subject in Group 3 and 1 subject in Group 4 each had 1 serious TEAE.  
Changes to ECGs were recorded in the majority of study patients, with the oldest group of paediatric 
patients  (group  1)  having  fewer  ECG  abnormalities  compared  to  the  younger  age  cohorts.  (4  of  7 
subjects  [57.1%]  in  Group  1,  5  of  6  subjects  [83.3%]  in  Group  2,  10  of  12  subjects  in  Group  3 
[83.3%],  and  11  of  12  subjects  [91.6%]  in  Group  4).  The  most  commonly  reported  ECG  rhythm 
abnormalities were sinus tachycardia and sinus bradycardia. Of the new ECG conduction abnormalities 
reported in 23 of 37 subjects (62.1%) the most frequently observed were intraventricular conduction 
defects,  prolonged  QTc  and  1st    degree  AV  block.    Regarding    the  investigational  TEAEs  of  special 
interest, no new onset changes > 500 msec in QTcB or QTcF were reported. None of the reported ECG 
changes  led  to  withdrawal  of  study  treatment.  Overall,  the  changes  in  ECG  findings  were  within 
acceptable limits. The ECG and QT changes described are known to be associated with adult delamanid 
use and are documented in Sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC. 
No  other  TEAEs  of  special  interest  were  identified  during  the  study.  Any  changes  from  baseline  for 
clinical laboratory test parameters were not clinically significant across the age groups. All of the AE’s 
reported are similar to those in adults and are currently listed in the SmPC. No new safety concern has 
been identified that warrants an update to the SmPC and PIL or additional risk management measures.   
Palatability results 
The majority of the subjects in Groups 3 and 4 found the paediatric formulation to be highly palatable. 
In subjects aged 3 to 5 years (Group 3), it was reported at both Visit 3 and Visit 12 that the majority 
of the subjects liked the taste of delamanid “very much” based on the investigator or designee score 
and the parent/patient score. In subjects aged 0 to 2 years (Group 4), it was reported at Visit 3 and 
Visit 12 that the majority of the subjects liked the taste of delamanid “very much” or “a little” based on 
the  investigator  or  designee  score  and  the  parent/patient  score.  A  palatability  rating  of  “dislike  very

much” was only reported by 1 (8.3%) subject aged 0 to 2 years at Visit 3 based on the investigator or 
designee score. 
2.3.3.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
This was a phase 1, multicentre, open-label, uncontrolled, multiple-dose, and age de-escalation trial of 
delamanid administered for 10 days with 8 days of safety follow-up and PK sampling. The trial enrolled 
37  paediatric  MDR-TB  subjects  from  Philippines  and  South  Africa.  Four  different  dosses  of  delamanid 
were administered to the subjects in 4 different age groups: Group 1 (ages 12 - 17 years, inclusive), 
Group 2 (ages 6 - 11 years, inclusive), Group 3 (ages 3 - 5 years, inclusive), and Group 4 (ages 0 - 2 
years, inclusive). Subjects in Groups 1 and 2 received the adult formulation and subjects in Groups 3 
and 4 received the paediatric formulation cross the age groups. 
The objectives of this trial were to determine PK of delamanid and its metabolites in combination with 
OBR, safety, and tolerability of delamanid in combination with OBR, and palatability of DPF. In Groups 
1 to 4, the median delamanid Cmax on Day 10 was 557, 573, 500, and 179 ng/mL, respectively; the 
median AUC0-24h on Day 10 was 9790, 12000, 9290 ng*h/mL, and 2740, respectively. The Cmax and 
the AUC0-24h ranges were reasonably similar for Groups 1 to 3 but were much lower for Group 4. The 
median weight-normalized oral clearance on Day 10 for delamanid was 8.92, 6.11, 6.68, and 8.34 for 
Groups 1 to 4, respectively.  
Since  the  dosing  regimens  were  different  for  each  group  as  well  as  subject  to  body  weights,  to 
compare  the  exposures  across  the  groups,  the  weight  normalized  oral  clearance,  was  calculated  for 
each  regimen.  A  visual  check  of  the  numbers  indicated  that  when  normalized,  the  median  oral 
clearance  normalized  to  subject  body  weight  (CL/F/BW)  ranged  between  6.11  to  8.92  for  all  Groups, 
except for the two subjects (# 43 and # 45) in Group 4 (5 mg QD), whose CL/F/BW was about twice 
the  value  of  the  other  groups,  (i.e.,  17.8).  This  could  be  due  to  either  impaired  absorption  (F)  or 
increased intrinsic clearance. It is unlikely to be due to increased intrinsic clearance as this would have 
been indicated by a systematic increase in oral clearance across the groups, which was not observed. 
The  impaired  absorption  could  be  due  to  either  the  dosage  strength  or  the  amount/type  of  food 
ingested along with the dose. The dosage strength of 5 mg in Group 4 appears unlikely as a factor in 
explaining the lower exposure, as the subjects receiving 10 mg BID (5 mg × 2 BID) and 5 mg BID had 
CL/F/BW  values  within  the  range  seen  in  other  groups.  Since  the  absorption  of  delamanid  is  affected 
by food it is very possible that subjects in Group 4, being the youngest in the trial, consumed both a 
lower total amount of food as well as relatively, a lower amount of fat with delamanid administration. 
Overall, this indicates that the delamanid oral clearance in the paediatric subjects was within a narrow 
range and the lower exposures observed in Group 4 can be overcome by administering higher doses of 
delamanid.  
For comparison to the adult data, following 100 mg BID delamanid administration in adults with MDR-
TB,  on  Day  14,  the  median  Cmax  was  371  ng/ml  and  the  AUC0-24h  was  6811  ng*h/ml22  which  are 
lower  than  that  observed in  Groups  1  to  3  paediatric  subjects.  The  median  clearance  on  Day  14  was 
0.602  L/h/kg  which  is  equal  to  10.03  mL/min/kg,  a  value  somewhat  higher  that  the  clearance 
observed  in  the  paediatric  subjects.  It  appears  that  the  ratio  of  AUC0-24h  on  Day  10  of  DM-6705  to 
delamanid  decreased  with  decreasing  age,  indicating  that  either  the  formation  of  DM-6705  is 
decreasing or its elimination is increasing or a combination of the two scenarios. The median terminal 
elimination  half-life  of  DM-6705  is  237.3  hours  in  Group  1  and  128.2  hours  for  Group  4,  indicating  a 
more rapid elimination with decreasing age.

The safety results exhibited during this trial are consistent across all age groups. The TEAEs observed 
in this 10-day trial were consistent with the current safety  profile of delamanid. There were no trends 
in  the  incidences  of  TEAEs  across  the  age  groups.  Overall,  the  most  frequently  reported  TEAEs 
occurred in the MedDRA SOCs of gastrointestinal disorders (17 of 37 subjects [45.9%]) and Infections 
and Infestations (15 of 37 subjects [40.5%]). Overall, the most frequently reported TEAE was vomiting 
(9  of  37  subjects  [24.3%])  followed  by  hyperuricaemia  (5  of  37  subjects  [13.5%]),  nausea  (5  of  37 
subjects  [13.5%]),  and  toothache  (5  of  37  subjects  [13.5%]).  Poor  dental  hygienic  conditions  were 
observed during this 10-day trial in subjects aged 12 to 17 years, 6 to 11 years, and 3 to 5 years. The 
assessment  of  ECGs,  vital  signs,  and  clinical  laboratory  tests  did  not  show  any  consistent  differences 
across the age groups. Overall, elevated uric acid (8.3%), elevated AST (3.1%), elevated ALT (2.9%), 
elevated  total  bilirubin  (2.9%),  elevated  cholesterol  (2.7%),  and  elevated  prothrombin  time  (2.9%) 
were the only reported clinically significant laboratory test abnormalities. One subject (2.7%) aged 3 to 
5 years reported elevated levels of transaminases and total bilirubin and with diagnosed hepatitis A. 
New  onset  changes  >  450  msec  (40.5%)  in  QTcB,  new  onset  changes  >  450  msec  (8.1%)  in  QTcF, 
new abnormal rhythm (81.0%), and new conduction abnormalities (62.1%) were the most frequently 
reported  clinically  significant  abnormalities  or  changes  in  ECG  results.  There  were  no  new  onset 
changes > 500 msec in QTcB or QTcF. Decrease of ≥ 5% of body weight (2.7%) and increase of ≥ 5% 
of body weight (18.9%) were the potentially clinically significant abnormalities reported for vital signs. 
There  were  no  clinically  relevant  differences  in  the  mean  changes  from  baseline  for  the  various  vital 
sign  parameters  across  the  age  groups.  The  majority  of  the  subjects  aged  0  to  5  years  liked  the 
palatability of the DPF. 
Summary 
Delamanid exposures were higher in the MDR-TB paediatric population, except Group 4, compared to 
adult  data.  Exposures  of  delamanid  metabolite  DM-6705  were  lower  in  the  paediatric  population, 
compared  to  adults  with  MDR-TB.  The  terminal  half-life  of  DM-6705  decreased  with  decreasing  age. 
Delamanid  demonstrated  an  acceptable  safety  profile  in  the  paediatric  population  studied  during  this 
10-day  trial  and  no  new  safety  concerns  were  identified.  Delamanid  paediatric  formulation  was 
palatable in children aged from birth to  5 years. 
The Trial 242-11-232 involved children aged 0-17 years , a patient population for which the treatment 
with  Deltyba  is  not  yet  approved  in  the  EU.  The  MAH  states  that  the  results  of  the  trial  are  of 
significant  importance  for  the  future  application  of  the  approval  of  delamanid  paediatric  MDR-TB 
indication,  however,  do  not  require  an  immediate  change  of  the  current  SmPC  for  Deltyba.  This  is 
acceptable.  
Further MS comments were received regarding PK data, which are endorsed by the Rapporteur:  
No  conclusions  can  be  drawn  on  the  basis  of  the  current  PK  analyses.  The  sampling  times  were  too 
sparse to have reliable results with noncompartmental analysis. With that none of the PK parameters 
the Company is showing (Cmax, tmax, AUC0-24h on Day 1 and Day 10 and t1/2z) is reliable. This is 
also  very  clear  from  the  values  of  Tmax  shown  in  tables  1  (Delamanid  Day  1)  and  2  (Delamanid 
Day10) on page 13 of the assessment report: with Tmax values of 23-96 hours  in group 3 (table 1) or  
13-75  hours  in  group  4  (table  2)  with  BID  dosing.  These  Tmax  values  do  not  correspond  with  the 
currently proposed dose regimen. 
Given  the  sampling  schedule,  popPK  analysis  makes  more  sense.  PopPK  analysis  is  planned,  but  this 
will be reported separately, after completion of the follow-up study 233.

3.  Rapporteur’s overall conclusion and recommendation 
This  study  provides  preliminary  PK,  safety  and  tolerability  data  for  delamanid  administration  in 
children. However, no conclusions can be made based on the current PK analyses. These data can be 
used  to  support  further  paediatric  development  of  this  product.  At  this  stage  of  paediatric 
development,  they  do  not  fully  determine  the  benefit:  risk  of  delamanid  in  the  paediatric  population. 
Therefore, no update to the product information is required.

patients weighing ≥ 100 kg (range 100 -121 kg) were 
kg. Update of sections 4.4, and 4.6 of the SmPC with 
recommendations during pregnancy. Annex II has 
been updated to reflect the closure of the Eurartesim 
Pregnancy Registry (as endorsed by CHMP in 
procedure II/32).  
The package leaflet is amended accordingly and 
The list of local representatives has also been 
updated in the Package leaflet.
C.I.4 - Change(s) in the SPC, Labelling or PL due to 
new quality, preclinical, clinical or pharmacovigilance 
data
treated with 4 tablets 320/40 mg PQP/artenimol for 3 days. 
Twenty-two of these patients were shown to be parasitic 
free at the last microscopic analysis of the blood sample; 
three patients did not complete parasitological blood 
analysis. All patients were clinically cured. 
Recommendation There are no data on which to base a 
dose recommendation in patients weighing >100 kg is now 
introduced in the product information.
Based on animal data, Eurartesim is suspected to cause 
serious birth defects when administered during the first 
trimester of pregnancy (see sections 4.4 and 5.3). 
Reproductive studies with artemisinin derivatives have 
demonstrated teratogenic potential with an increased risk 
during early gestation. Piperaquine was not teratogenic in 
the rat or rabbit. Therefore, Eurartesim should not be used 
during the 1st trimester of pregnancy in situations where 
other suitable and effective anti-malarials are available.
A large amount of data (more than 3000 exposed 
Page 2/10
outcomes) from the use of artenimol/piperaquine during 
the 2nd and 3rd trimester indicate no fetotoxicity. In 
perinatal and postnatal studies in rats, piperaquine was 
associated with delivery complications. However, there was 
no delay in neonatal development following exposure in 
utero or via milk. Consequently, if Eurartesim is more 
suitable for a pregnant woman than other artemisinin-
based combination therapies with a higher range of 
experience (or sulfadoxine–pyrimethamine), Eurartesim 
may be used in the 2nd and 3rd trimester.

Annex II
Following submission and assessment of the final study 
EMEA/H/C/PSR/S/0018
report, no new safety signals were identified and there are 
no outstanding issues. Therefore, the PRAC considers that 
the obligation is fulfilled.
In view of available data regarding the PASS final study 
report, the PRAC considered that changes to the conditions 
of the marketing authorisation were warranted.

2.1.  Problem statement 
Not applicable 
2.2.  About the product 
Trastuzumab  is  a  humanized  recombinant  IgG1  monoclonal  antibody  specifically  directed  against  the 
HER2 receptor. Trastuzumab binds with high affinity and specificity to sub-domain IV, a juxta-membrane 
region of HER2’s extracellular domain. Binding of trastuzumab to HER2 inhibits ligand-independent HER2 
signalling and prevents the proteolytic cleavage of its extracellular domain, an activation mechanism of 
HER2. As a result, trastuzumab has been shown, in both in vitro assays and in animals, to inhibit the 
proliferation  of  human  tumour  cells  that  overexpress  HER2.  Additionally,  trastuzumab  is  a  potent 
mediator  of  antibody-dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC).  In  vitro,  trastuzumab-mediated 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 12/99 
 
  
 
 
 
ADCC has been shown to be preferentially exerted on HER2 overexpressing cancer cells compared with 
cancer cells that do not overexpress HER2. 
Trastuzumab as Herceptin is currently authorised for the treatment of breast cancer and gastric cancer. 
Herceptin is available as a 150 mg Powder for concentrate for solution for infusion for intravenous (IV) 
use and as a 600 mg Solution for injection (SC) for subcutaneous use. 
Herwenda  (trastuzumab)  also  referred  EG12014  has  been  developed  as  a  biosimilar  to  the  reference 
product Herceptin (trastuzumab) authorised in the European Union (EU) via the Centralised Procedure 
in 2000, claiming the same therapeutic indications than those of the reference product for the treatment 
of  HER2-positive  early  and  metastatic  breast  cancer  (EBC  and  MBC),  and  metastatic  gastric  cancer 
(MGC). 
Efficacy  and  safety  study  in  early  breast  cancer  patients  are  provided,  and  the  other  indications  are 
sought to be extrapolated. 
2.3.  Type of application and aspects on development 
This  application  is  submitted  under  Article  10(4)  of  Directive  2001/83/EC  relating  to  applications  for 
biosimilar medicinal products. The reference product is Herceptin (150 mg powder for concentrate for 
solution  for  infusion:  Roche  Registration  Limited).  Herceptin  was  authorised  in  the  EU  on  28  August 
2000. 
CHMP scientific advice were given on quality, nonclinical and clinical development. 
The development program of EG12014 included exercises to demonstrate similarity of EG12014 to EU 
Herceptin  based  on  data  derived  from  analytical,  animal,  and  clinical  studies  (reported  below).  The 
clinical programme was initiated with the aim to show biosimilarity between both products in the setting 
of  early  breast  cancer,  and  extrapolating  similarity  to  the  other  indications  in  case  biosimilarity  was 
confirmed in EBC in regard to quality, non-clinical, PK, pharmacodynamic and clinical aspects.  
To  establish  a  PK  bridge  to  EU  Herceptin  efficacy  and  safety  data  and  justify  the  relevance  of  data 
generated  using  EU  Herceptin  as  the  comparator  in  the  clinical  phase  3  study  EGC002,  a  study 
(EGC001)  of  biosimilarity  in  PK  between  EG12014,  US  Herceptin  and  EU  Herceptin  after  a  single  90 
minutes  IV  infusion  of  6  mg/kg  trastuzumab  was  conducted.  Study  EGC001  was  a  double  blind, 
randomised, parallel-group, single-dose, three-arm, two-stage study in healthy male subjects. This study 
was  designed  in  support  of  a  global  clinical  development  concept  in  consideration  of  regulatory 
guidelines,  in  particular  “Guideline  on  Similar  Biological  Medicinal  Products  Containing  Monoclonal 
Antibodies – Non-clinical and Clinical Issues” (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010, 2012), “Guideline on the 
Investigation  of  Bioequivalence”  (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98  Rev.  1/  Corr,  2010).  The  methodological 
approach was in accordance with the EMA SA (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/466179/2015). 
2.4.  Quality aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction

Medicinal Product (RMP) Herceptin. 
The  finished  product  is  presented  as  sterile,  single-use,  white  to  pale  yellow,  preservative-free, 
lyophilised powder for intravenous administration. The finished product (FP) is to be reconstituted with 
7.2 mL of sterile water for injections prior to administration. Each vial of FP contains 150 mg EG12014 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 13/99 
 
  
 
 
(trastuzumab). The composition is identical to that of the RMP and composed of L-histidine, L-histidine 
hydrochloride monohydrate, polysorbate 20 and trehalose trihydrate.  The lyophilised powder containing 
150 mg of trastuzumab is presented in 20 mL clear glass type I vial with a fluoropolymer-coated butyl 
rubber stopper and aluminium seal with flip-off cap. 
2.4.2.  Active substance 
2.4.2.1.  General Information 
The  active  substance  trastuzumab  is  a  humanised  monoclonal  antibody  (MAb)  that  binds  to  Human 
Epidermal  growth  factor  Receptor  2  protein  (HER2)  that  is  overexpressed  in  breast  cancer  cells.  The 
mechanism of action of trastuzumab is known to be its inhibition of proliferation of human tumour cells 
that overexpress HER2. The active substance is produced by recombinant DNA technology in a Chinese 
hamster  ovary  (CHO)  mammalian  expression  system.  EG12014  contains  an  identical  amino  acid 
sequence to the originator trastuzumab except that no Lys exists in the C-termini of heavy chains. The 
schematic  structure  of  trastuzumab  is  presented  and  described  in  the  submission.  EG12014  contains 
four pairs of inter-chain disulphide bonds (two between heavy and light, and two between two heavy 
chains)  and  12  pairs  of  intra-chain  disulfide  bonds,  which  is  identical  to  the  originator  trastuzumab. 
EG12014  is  heterogeneously  glycosylated,  with  one  glycosylation  site  at  Asn-300  of  the  heavy  chain 
carrying  complex  biantennary  oligosaccharides.  The  average  molecular  mass  with  glycosylation  is 
approximately 148 kDa.

2.4.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Manufacture 
EG12014  active  substance  (AS)  is  manufactured  at  the  commercial  manufacturing  site.  The 
manufacturing and analytical testing sites associated with the commercial manufacture of EG12014 AS 
are  provided.  A  valid  proof  of  GMP  compliance  has  been  provided  for  the  sites  responsible  for  the 
manufacture and storage of the Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB), and for the active 
substance  manufacturing  and  QC  testing  sites  located  in  Taiwan.  During  the  assessment,  a  Major 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 14/99 
 
  
 
 
 
Objection  relating  to  demonstration  of  GMP  compliance  for  active  substance  manufacturing  sites  was 
resolved. 
The manufacturing process for EG12014 AS uses a recombinant CHO cell line. The manufacturing process 
is a typical antibody manufacturing process, with preceding expansion steps followed by cell clarification 
and a series of purification steps. A detailed description of the manufacturing process is presented in the 
dossier.  Several  schematic  overviews  and  flowcharts  are  included.  The  selected  process  parameters, 
their classification and acceptable ranges are provided in the detailed description of the manufacturing 
process. Reprocessing is proposed in nanofiltration and final AS bulk filtration. Reprocessing will only be 
performed  in  case  of  a  failed  filter  integrity  test.  After  manufacturing,  EG12014  AS  is  filled  and  then 
frozen and stored at -30°C/-40°C.  
Control of materials 
The  DNA  coding  sequences  of  trastuzumab  used  to  construct  the  expression  vector  were  initially 
synthesized based on the known amino acid sequence excluding the last C-terminal lysine in heavy chain.  
The source, history and generation of the cell banking system is adequately described, and the cell banks 
have been properly qualified. The testing of cell banks (MCB and WCB) was performed with regards to 
cell and product identity as well as microbial and viral contaminations.  
Characterisation  of  end-of-production-cells  has  been  addressed  and  genetic  stability  has  been 
demonstrated for WCB. The results provided for cell growth characteristics, production stability, target 
gene sequence, and gene copy number are acceptable. A release testing programme for future WCBs is 
presented.  
Two master cell banks were prepared, characterised and used during EG12014 development. One MCB  
was used for manufacturing of the Phase 1 clinical batches. Another MCB was used to prepare the current 
WCB which was used for manufacturing of the Phase 3 clinical batches and future commercialization. To 
ensure similar product quality between the AS generated from the sub-clone and the parental clone, a 
series of comparative studies at different production scales were performed. The results are adequately 
presented.  
The generation of the cell substrate is in accordance with ICH Q5D. The cell banking system of EG12014, 
as well as the characterization of established cell banks including identity, purity, and the cell substrate 
stability is in accordance with ICH Q5A and Q5D. 
Details on raw materials as well as the compendial status of the raw materials used are included. Raw 
materials of animal origin which were used during cell line development and cell bank preparation are 
indicated.  Method  description of  cell bank  testing  is included.  A  protocol  for  the  preparation  of  future 
WCBs  is  described,  and  the  detailed  process  parameters  (PPs)  and  in  process  controls  (IPC)  for  the 
preparation process are presented, with acceptance criteria.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
The applicant provided an overview of process parameters, as well as of all in-process controls. Overall, 
the control strategy is deemed sufficient. There are no AS intermediates isolated in the manufacturing 
process of EG12014. 
Process validation 
Process validation (PV) of the EG12014 AS manufacturing process was performed on several consecutive 
batches of AS manufactured according to the proposed commercial AS process  
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 15/99 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Results from process parameters and in-process monitoring were provided. All PPQ results presented for 
process parameters as well as in-process quality controls met the predefined acceptance criteria and are 
not significantly different between the PV batches.  
The AS manufacturing process showed sufficient capacity for removal of process-related impurities,. The 
successful removal of product-related impurities was demonstrated for all validation batches.  
Bioburden  and  endotoxins  were  monitored  throughout  the  production  process  and  after  each  critical 
step. The PPQ data demonstrate sufficient clearance and consistent low levels for both parameters. 
Validation  of  the  procedures  for  transport  of  the  AS  from  the  AS  manufacturing  site  to  the  FP 
manufacturing site is presented.  
Reprocessing is planned for nanofiltration and bulk filtration. An acceptable reprocessing protocol is 
presented.  
Based on the process validation results presented for the AS batches, it can be concluded that the AS 
manufacturing process is capable of a consistent and reproducible production of AS that meets the 
relevant specifications. 
Process development 
The  EG12014  AS  manufacturing  process  development  history  is  divided  into  four  periods  The  key 
changes in materials, process parameters, equipment, utility and facility, and the purposes of changes 
in each period are summarized in the comparability report.   
Based on the results provided, it is concluded that all quality attributes are analytically comparable for 
the batches. 
Characterisation 
Detailed characterisation has been performed on several batches of EG12014.  
2.4.2.3.  Specification 
The  applicant  has  presented  a  broad  control  panel  of  analytical  procedures  for  release  and  stability 
testing of AS.  
In general, the acceptance criteria are considered acceptable. 
Analytical procedures 
The  analytical  test  methods  for  release  testing  of  EG12014  AS  and  their  validation/verification 
parameters  are  adequately  presented.  Further  details  on  procedure  validations  are  provided  in  the 
dossier as individual documents. 
Batch analysis 
An overview of all batches and full release testing data were provided, including the AS process validation 
batches  manufactured  according  to  the  final  commercial  process.  All  results  were  compliant  with  the 
specifications. 
Reference standards 
The applicant has provided an overview of the establishment of the in-house reference standard system 
as well as acceptance criteria for the release of future working reference standards.  
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 16/99 
 
  
 
 
 
At  the  commercialisation  stage,  a  two-tier  reference  standard  system  is  applied.  A  qualified  primary 
reference standard is used for qualifying future working reference standard, which is used in all assays 
where usage of a reference standard is required. The primary reference standard was manufactured via 
the commercial process and qualified by comprehensive characterisation. 
The working reference standard (WRS) has been manufactured via the commercial process as well and 
has  been  qualified  using  primary  reference  standard.  A  protocol  for  qualification  and  the  release 
specifications for future WRS is presented. 
Container closure 
The applicant has provided detailed information on the AS container which complies with Ph. Eur. quality 
standards. A release specification is defined. Identification test and endotoxin test are performed, and 
technical drawings are presented. Extractables and leachables studies have been performed, which did 
not indicate any safety risk. 
2.4.2.4.  Stability 
Stability  studies  that  included  physicochemical  and  biological  tests  at  different  conditions  (including 
temperature  stress  and  repeated  freezing  and  thawing  stress)  were  performed  according  to  stability 
protocols over the whole shelf-life of the AS. 
When stored frozen, all parameters remained within specifications and no trends were observed. 
The stability study is ongoing and the intention is to extend the shelf-life once the stability study results 
are available. The stability indicating parameters have been assigned based on results from accelerated 
and/or stress condition testing. 
The protocol for shelf-life extension is provided. The dossier states that any shelf-life extensions will only 
be implemented following regulatory approval via the appropriate variation application. 
2.4.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.4.3.1.  Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
EG12014  FP  is  provided  as  a  lyophilised  powder  in  a  dosage  strength  of  150  mg.  The  FP  is  to  be 
reconstituted with 7.2 mL of sterile water for injection prior to administration. The same buffer system 
as  the  reference  product  Herceptin  is  used;  L-histidine  (buffering  agent),  L-histidine  hydrochloride 
monohydrate (buffering agent) Polysorbate 20 (stabiliser and surfactant), trehalose dihydrate (bulking 
agent).  The  components  of  the  finished  product  are  commonly  used  in  parenteral  products  and  are 
described in sufficient detail with regards to function and standards. The product is delivered with an 
appropriate  overfill  to  ensure  a  sufficient  deliverable  dose  provided  from  each  vial  following 
reconstitution. The target fill volume was established to ensure that the deliverable amount EG12014 is 
comparable to that of Herceptin. The product is supplied without any overages.   
A  quality  target  product  profile  (QTPP)  is  defined  and  includes  the  targets  for  physico-chemical 
properties.  Quality  attributes  were  evaluated  regarding  their  impact  on  biological  activity/potency, 
pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD), immunogenicity and safety. The quality attributes with 
moderate  to  very  high  criticality  were  defined  as  Critical  Quality  Attributes  (CQAs).  Overall,  the 
formulation development studies are adequately described. Data are presented to support the conclusion 
that the chosen formulation is sufficiently robust and are in accordance with the results of the stability 
studies.  
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 17/99 
 
  
 
 
Identification  of  the  process  parameters  per  unit  operation  and  acceptable  ranges  for  operation  have 
been investigated through experiments in the laboratory and at small and production scale. Justification 
of  process  parameters  with  regards  to  criticality  and  impact  on  the  quality  of  the  product  has  been 
described in sufficient detail and the ranges are considered adequately justified. 
The results on elemental impurities of EG12014 FP PPQ batches are provided, and also a summary of 
elemental impurity risk assessment on lyophilised FP, in accordance with pharmacopeia guidelines USP 
<232>, Ph. Eur. 5.20 and ICH Q3D. 
The EG12014 FP manufacturing process development history is described. This includes manufacturing 
of clinical phase I supplies , clinical manufacture of Phase III supplies using commercial equipment and 
PPQ lots using the proposed commercial process. The differences during manufacturing development are 
mainly due to increase in batch scale and different manufacturing sites. The changes are summarised 
with regard to impact and risk and are appropriately justified. The applicant has presented a side-by-
side comparison between the commercial and the clinical material. The FP manufacturing processes can 
be considered comparable.  
Material compatibility studies revealed that polysorbate 20 (PS20) showed an increased adsorption to 
the  sterile  filters  over  time.  Holding  times  and  flush  volumes  are  critical  to  recover  PS20  content.  A 
lyophilisation process robustness study has been performed. Together with the presented batch data, 
this supports the conclusion that the lyophilisation conditions are robust and do not impact the product 
quality. 
The lyophilised powder containing 150 mg of trastuzumab is presented in 20 mL clear glass type I vial 
with a fluoropolymer-coated butyl rubber stopper and aluminium seal with flip-off cap. 
Compatibility of the vial and stopper is demonstrated by the stability, extractable and leachable studies. 
The applicant committed to extend the ongoing leachables study in line with the stability protocol and 
should provide the remaining results of the leachables study  post-approval. 
The same quality of vials and stoppers was used during formulation development studies as well as in 
all clinical supplies and for the commercial product. Container closure integrity (CCI) through the claimed 
shelf-life is demonstrated. This approach is acceptable. Compatibility of the finished product has been 
shown for the container closure for lyophilised finished product, reconstituted finished product in vial, 
infusion diluent and materials for infusion. Based on the data presented, reconstituted EG12014 FP (in 
water for injection) is chemically and physically stable for 7 days when stored at 5 ± 3°C. Reconstituted 
FP further diluted in 0.9% sodium chloride at both low dose (80 mg dissolved in 250 ml) and high dose 
(1112 mg dissolved in 250 ml) was stable for 33 days, stored at 5 ± 3°C and for 48 hours stored at 
30°C. 
2.4.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
The manufacturing sites involved in the manufacture and analytical testing of EG12014 FP are listed in 
the dossier. A valid proof of GMP compliance has been provided for the finished product manufacturing 
and  QC  testing  sites.  During  the  assessment  a  Major  Objection  relating  to  demonstration  of  GMP 
compliance for finished product manufacturing sites was resolved. 
A  standard  manufacturing  process  is  performed  that  comprises  thawing  of  the  active  substance, 
preparation  of  excipient  buffer  solutions,  compounding,  sterile  filtration,  aseptic  filling,  lyophilization, 
stoppering and sealing. 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 18/99 
 
  
 
 
Process controls and validation /verification 
In process controls (IPCs) for each step of the manufacturing process are listed. Acceptable ranges for 
the process parameters (PP) have been defined, and criticality is specified. The PP ranges and criticality 
scores are based on existing process knowledge and existing data. IPCs are appropriately described, and 
acceptance ranges or limits are provided in addition to criticality score. The manufacturing process has 
been validated using consecutive commercial scale FP batches (PPQ). Results on process performance 
and batch release results of the PPQ batches confirms a consistent manufacturing process. Hold times 
are defined and validated through hold-time studies.  
Filtration  steps  have  been  validated,  and  filter  integrity  testing  is  included  as  IPCs.  Aseptic  filling  is 
validated by media fills. Consistency of the lyophilisation process has been adequately addressed.  
Process  performance  and  product  quality  are  monitored  as  part  of  continuous  process  verification.  A 
representative shipping qualification study has been performed and appropriate temperature conditions 
are ensured during shipment by qualified thermo-controlled shipping systems. 
2.4.3.3.  Product specification 
Specifications 
The  analytical  methods  applied  for  release  and  shelf-life  testing  include:  appearance,  osmolality,  pH, 
water content, reconstitution time, visible and sub-visible particles, uniformity of dosage unit, protein 
content, purity, activity, microbiological aspects  and container integrity.  
Analytical methods used for FP release testing have been described and validated or refers to Ph. Eur. 
In-house  developed  analytical  methods  are  validated  in  line  with  ICH  guideline  Q2(R1).  Method 
performance parameters are adequately addressed in the presented validation reports. 
Batch  analysis  results  of  EG12014  FP  have  been  presented.  The  data  from  all  batches  meet  the 
acceptance criteria of the FP specifications, with reference to the specification valid at the time of release 
for each of the batches. 
The relevant impurities are described for AS, and no impurities specific to the FP are known. A summary 
of nitrosamine risk evaluation is provided and considered satisfactory.  
Reference standards 
The  applicant  has  provided  an  overview  of  the  establishment  of  the  reference  standard  –  see  active 
substance. 
Specifications and drawings of all the container closure components are provided. The vial and rubber 
stopper complies with Ph. Eur. Stability studies support that the container closure system is suitable. 
2.4.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The presented long-term (5°C ± 3°C) and accelerated data (25°C ± 2 °C / 60 ± 5% RH) for primary 
batches (commercial process) support a shelf-life of 36 months based on real time stability data as stated 
in SmPC. 
Stability  indicating  parameters  are  defined.  Data  are  within  the  defined  specifications  and  showed  no 
significant  changes  for  36  months  at  long-term.  For  the  accelerated  studies  a  decrease  in  purity  is 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 19/99 
 
  
 
 
 
observed  with  corresponding  increase  in  impurities  and  product-related  variants.  A  slight  decrease  in 
activity is observed for some batches but are within the method variability. 
A temperature cycling study demonstrated the robustness of the product following repeated freeze thaw 
cycles.  
In-use stability is supported by stability studies together with compatibility and robustness studies during 
pharmaceutical development. In-use stability studies demonstrate a chemical and physical stability for 
the reconstituted finished product for 7 days at 2°C – 8°C and for the diluted finished product up to 33 
days at 2°C – 8°C and further 48 hours at temperatures not exceeding 30°C. 
Photostability  studies  on  both  lyophilized  and  reconstituted  product  show  that  the  finished  product  is 
sensitive to light and that the original carton provides adequate protection. The reconstituted product 
showed  a  more  significant  degradation  than  the  lyophilized  product.  The  testing  of  relative  potency 
indicates  that  the  light/UV  exposure  for  the  reconstituted  FP  can  significantly  impact  the  activity  of 
EG12014. Photostability studies revealed that the relative potency to RS of all the testing samples was 
reduced,  together  with  an  increase  in  the  level  of  aggregation  and  degradation  and  an  increase  in 
fragmentation . 
A  suitable  post-approval  stability  protocol  and  commitment  is  presented.  The  dossier  states  that  any 
shelf-life extensions will only be implemented following regulatory approval via the appropriate variation 
application. 
2.4.3.5.  Biosimilarity 
Similarity between EG12014 and the reference product, EU-approved Herceptin, is addressed using a 
wide  range  of  analytical  exercises  covering  physiochemical  and  biological  properties.  A  forced 
degradation  study  is  also  presented.  The  applicant  has  presented  biosimilarity  data  also  from  US 
Herceptin.  Overall,  the  US  Herceptin  quality  profile  is  considered  comparable  to  EU  Herceptin  and 
EG12014. 
Critical quality attributes have been assigned to different categories and risk ranked according to their 
impact on safety, efficacy and immunogenicity.   
The  applicant  has  included  data  from  batches  of  EG12014  and  batches  of  EU  approved  Herceptin  for 
biosimilarity analysis.  
EG12014 has been designed without a C-terminal lysine, which makes the primary structure different 
form  that  of  Herceptin.  The  modification  has  been  justified  and  discussed  with  regards  to  possible 
differences in physiochemical and biological properties. Similarity between EG12014 and EU-Herceptin 
is shown for secondary and tertiary structure.  
For the determination of intact mass, the MS spectra with different glycoforms between EG12014 and 
Herceptin have been compared.

The amount of free thiols in EG12014 compared to EU-Herceptin is slightly higher. The applicant claims 
that since low amounts of free-thiols  have been routinely detected in IgG molecules including IgG from 
serum and recombinant mAbs, the minor difference between EU-Herceptin and EG12014 is considered 
non-critical. This can be accepted, since these small differences do not seem to impact structure/purity 
and biological activity/functionality, as shown by the available biosimilarity data. 
Purity and impurities were addressed. The applicant claims that there is no clear correlation between 
purity,  target  binding  and  effector  function  of  EG12014.  The  results  show  that  the  monomer  level  of 
EG12014  is  outside  the  predefined  quality  range,  with  lower  levels  than  that  of  the  EU-approved 
Herceptin. The difference is due to increased levels of HMW, observed in EG12014. The applicant further 
justifies  the  observed  difference  in  purity  with  EG12014  having  similar  efficacy  and  a  similar 
safety/immunogenicity  profile  compared  to  EU-approved  Herceptin.  As  a  general  comment,  the  EMA 
biosimilarity guideline states that clinical data cannot be used to justify substantial differences in quality 
attributes  (CHMP/437/04  Rev  1).  However,  the  applicant  demonstrated  with  forced  degradation  data 
that there is no obvious change in binding and activity in case of increase in aggregates and concomitant 
decrease of monomer level upon high pH exposure. 
Charged variants , deamidated and oxidation species , and glycosylation are determined by state of art 
methods. For the basic variants, some EG12014 lots are outside the lower limit of the quality range of 
EU  Herceptin.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  major  variants  of  basic  fractions  in  trastuzumab  include 
aspartic acid converted to succinimide, and that the Asp102 in CDR3 of the trastuzumab heavy chain is 
susceptible  to  succinimide  formation  and  isomerisation,  leading  to  an  increase  of  basic  variants  and 
potential loss of potency. The differences in charge variants do not seem to impact potency and biological 
activities, as shown by the available biosimilarity data. 
Higher  oxidation  levels  at  Met  in  EG12014  compared  to  EU  Herceptin  is  observed.  The  low  overall 
oxidation  level  in  EG12014  could  support  the  low  criticality  score,  also  considering  that  there  is  no 
reported impact of oxidation on the complementarity-determining regions of trastuzumab. The stability 
of oxidation level during long-term storage, similarities in biological activity, and similar PK profile further 
indicate that the observed levels have no significant impact on clinical profile of EG12014 and does not 
preclude a biosimilarity claim. 
For afucosylation, all batches fall within the predefined quality range while some EG12104 batches fall 
outside the quality range. The observed differences in the average level of afucosylation and the relevant 
batches displaying less afucosylation than the predefined QR are unlikely to have significant impact on

product  quality.  This  is  further  justified  by  the  similarities  observed  in  biological  activity  ,  thus  the 
observed differences do not preclude a biosimilarity claim. 
In vitro comparative functional studies between EG12014 and EU Herceptin are addressed by functional 
assays for immunochemical properties , and biological activity . 
In  the  statistical  analysis  of  receptor  binding,  some  EG12014  batches  fall  outside  the  quality  range. 
These batches fall within the quality range in biological activity, and the data does not indicate a major 
deviation from the other batches in terms of magnitude. It can therefore be agreed that the difference 
in binding affinity does not preclude a determination of similarity for  receptorbinding. Data presented 
for  one  of  the  batches  show  a    binding  affinity  range  well  within  the  quality  range  during  long-term 
storage which according to the applicant indicates that the values falling outside of the quality range is 
likely to be due to assay variability. Taken together, the observed differences in binding does not preclude 
a determination of similarity for EG12014. 
Similarity  was addressed  for Fc binding affinity and similarity between EU Herceptin and EG12014 is 
supported by these analyses. 
For C1q, although there is a weak trend for increased C1q binding in EG12014 batches, similarity with 
Herceptin can be agreed. 
Comparison of potency was analysed using several analytical approaches. For the cell based assays, all 
EG12014 batches fall within the predefined QR, supporting similarity of EG12014 potency to Herceptin. 
For CDC activity, no activity was detected for EG12014 or the reference medicinal product, in line with 
the known mechanism of action for trastuzumab. For ADCP, one batch of EG12014 batches falls outside 
the upper limit of the QR. Taking into consideration the orthogonal assays falling within the QR of EU 
Herceptin,  it  can  be  agreed  that  the  ADCP  activity  of  EG12014  is  not  likely  to  impact  clinical  efficacy 
compared to the reference medicinal product and does not preclude a biosimilarity claim for EG12014. 
Although batches from several attributes fail the biosimilarity acceptance criteria between EG12014 and 
the reference medicinal product, these do not preclude a conclusion of biosimilarity. 
A forced degradation study has been included in the biosimilarity exercise. The samples were tested for 
formation of aggregation , fragmentation), changes of variants , and biological activities (. 
The forced degradation study includes EG12014 FP batches as well as EU-approved Herceptin and US-
licenced Herceptin batches. From the presented data, EG12014 seems to be somewhat more prone to 
aggregation upon low or high pH stress compared to EU-Herceptin. 
The forced degradation study indicates that the EG12014 and EU Herceptin are sensitive for the same 
types of stress.   
Based  on  the  review  of  the  submitted  data,  EG12014  is  considered  biosimilar  to  Herceptin  and  a 
benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
2.4.3.6.  Adventitious agents 
All  raw  materials  used  for  manufacturing  EG12014  AS  and  FP  are  of  non-human/  non-animal  origin 
except  for  goat  anti-human  IgG  and  HyClone  medium.  Goat  anti-human  IgG  (Sigma,  US  origin)  was 
extracted  from  goat  blood  and  contains  1%  bovine  serum  albumin  (BSA)  of  US  origin  that  serves  as 
stabiliser.  The  antibody  was  used  during  cell  pool  selection  prior  to  the  second  limiting  dilution.  Risk 
assessment was conducted by the supplier. Residual goat anti-human IgG and BSA is likely to be largely 
reduced in the subsequent steps of cell line preparation and poses a low risk in TS/BSR transmission. 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 23/99 
 
  
 
 
  
HyClone medium contains cholesterol (country of origin New Zealand, source ovine wool) and cod liver 
oil  (country  of  origin  Norway,  source:  cod  liver).  Neither  of  these  are  considered  as  risk  material  as 
defined in Commission Decision 97/534/EC. 
The risk of microbial and mycoplasma contamination is adequately addressed, and the cell banks (MCB, 
WCB and EPC) are demonstrated to be free from adventitious microbial contaminants. 
Unprocessed  bulk  harvest  (UBH)  is  tested  routinely  for  mycoplasma  and  bacteria/fungi.  The  release 
specification  includes  tests  for  bacterial  endotoxin  and  microbial  sterility.  UBH  testing  supports  the 
absence of mycoplasma and bacteria/fungi during the manufacturing process. During manufacturing of 
FP, the compounded solution is sterilized by filters, followed by aseptic filling. 
A  virus  clearance  study  was  conducted  to  assess  the  virus  removal  capability  of  the  manufacturing 
process.  
The model viruses chosen for virus clearance studies are considered appropriate, and the LRV of removal 
or inactivation of each virus by the EG12014 purification process is considered acceptable.  
The relevant testing methods for examining adventitious agents in cell banks and UBH have been briefly 
described  in  the  dossier,  and  the  original  study  reports  for  the  adventitious  agents  safety  evaluation 
studies are provided.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
EG12014 is developed as a trastuzumab similar biological medicinal product (biosimilar) to the Reference 
Medicinal Product Herceptin. A recommendation was raised for future development. 
The  manufacturing  processes  for  AS  and  FP  reflects  a  standard  process  used  for  the  manufacture  of 
monoclonal antibodies. Several sites are responsible for the manufacturing, cell bank manufacture and 
storage, packaging, release, in-process and stability testing. The batch release sites for EEA are Novartis 
Pharma  GmbH,  Nürnberg,  Germany  and  Novartis  Farmacéutica,  S.A.,  Barcelona,  Spain.    During  the 
assessment a Major Objection relating to demonstration of GMP compliance for manufacturing sites was 
resolved. 
EG12014 has been thoroughly characterised using a comprehensive set of analytical methods. FP release 
and shelf-life specifications includes a broad panel of tests. 
EG12014  FP  is  provided  as  a  lyophilised  powder  in  a  dosage  strength  of  150  mg.  The  FP  is  to  be 
reconstituted with 7.2 mL of sterile water for injection prior to administration. The same buffer system 
as the reference product Herceptin is used. 
In-use stability studies demonstrate a chemical and physical stability for the reconstituted FP for 7 days 
at 2°C – 8°C and for the diluted FP up to 33 days at 2°C – 8°C and further 48 hours at temperatures 
not  exceeding  30°C.  The  presented  long-term  (5°C  ±  3°C)  and  accelerated data  for  primary  batches 
(commercial process) supports a shelf-life of 36 months based on real time stability data. 
Similarity between EG12014 and the reference product, EU-approved Herceptin, is addressed using a 
wide range of analytical exercises covering physiochemical and biological properties, as well as a forced 
degradation  study.  Most  of  the  quality  attributes  proved  to  be  highly  similar.  The  main  differences 
between EG12014 and Herceptin include level of aggregates, oxidation, free thiols and basic variants, 
however, these differences do not seem to have a significant impact on biological activities and potency 
assays. EG12014 can thus be considered as a biosimilar to EU-Herceptin. 
The information provided in the adventitious agents sections is acceptable.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, the marketing authorisation application 
for Herwenda is approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.4.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, 
the CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
The applicant should submit (through a post-approval variation application) the remaining results of 
the DP container closure system leachables study when these data become available. 
2.5.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
The EG12014 non-clinical programme consists of one pharmacodynamic xenograft mouse model study 
and a PK study in mice. The studies were done in comparison with Herceptin. The submitted non-clinical 
comparative in vivo studies included one primary PD study and one PK study that were conducted under 
non-GLP conditions. 
2.5.2.  Pharmacology 
Trastuzumab  is  an  immunoglobulin  G1  (IgG1)  kappa  isotype  antibody  specific  for  human  epidermal 
growth  factor  receptor-2  (HER2).  Binding  of  trastuzumab  to  HER2  inhibits  ligand  independent  HER2 
signalling  and  inhibit  the  proliferation  of  human  tumour  cells  that  overexpress  HER2.  In  addition, 
trastuzumab  is  a  potent  mediator  of  antibody-dependent  cell-mediated  cytotoxicity  (ADCC).  In  vitro 
assays were conducted to address biocomparability between EG12014, Herceptin-EU and Herceptin-US. 
See 2.4. Quality aspects for critical evaluation of the similarity assessment.  
An in vivo study was conducted in a xenograft mouse model, comparing the pharmacology of EG12014 to 
Herceptin-EU and Herceptin-US. Further, a single dose PK study was conducted in mice at three dose 
levels of EG12014 (1, 10, 100mg/kg) and one dose level of Herceptin (10mg/kg). An in vivo study was 
performed to compare the tumour growth inhibitory potential in a xenograft mouse model with BT-474 
breast carcinoma cells (EG12014 and EU Herceptin). EG12014 and EU Herceptin showed a similar tumour 
growth inhibition rate relative to control animals. 
Studies on secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
were not conducted. 
2.5.2.1.  Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro studies 
In vitro PD studies (Table 1) showed according to applicant similarity between EG12014, EU Herceptin 
and US Herceptin with regard to the biological activities associated with Fab- and Fc-mediated functions 
of trastuzumab (for more details, please refer to 2.4. Quality aspects).

Study R103XX317-1 V2 
A  non-GLP  efficacy  study  was  performed  to  compare  anti-tumour  effects  between  with  EG12014  (lot 
B14007)  and  EU  Herceptin  (lot  H4277)  in  a  xenograft  model  using  BT-474  breast  carcinoma  cells 
characterized by the overexpression of HER2 and oestrogen receptors. 
BT-474 cells were subcutaneously implanted in the flank of severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) 
mice.  Tumour-bearing  mice  (the  average  tumour  volume  reached  135  mm3)  received  twice  weekly 
intraperitoneal trastuzumab doses of 0.01 mg/kg, 0.1 mg/kg or 1 mg/kg or vehicle, for a 4- week period, 
and were assessed for changes in tumour growth that denoted anti-proliferative activity (Table 2:). 
The percentage of tumour growth inhibition (TGI), based on tumour volume assessed twice weekly, was 
comparable between EG12014 1 mg/kg and EU Herceptin 1 mg/kg treated mice on Day 24 (56.0% and 
51.1% for EG12014 and EU Herceptin, respectively; p=0.998) and on Day 28 (61.3% and 47.7% for 
EG12014 and EU Herceptin, respectively; p=0.984).

At  a  trastuzumab  dose  of  1  mg/kg,  a  comparable  inhibitory  effect  on  tumour  growth  was  shown  for 
EG12014  and  EU  Herceptin  treated  animals,  which  was  significantly  higher  on  Day  24  and  Day  28 
(p<0.05) compared to control animals. 
At the lowest dose of 0.01 mg/kg there was no significant effect on tumour growth for EG12014 or EU 
Herceptin treated mice as compared to control mice up to Day 28. At a dose of 0.1 mg/kg, on Day 28 
the tumour growth inhibition rate was 32.2% (p=0.0320) for EG12014, however the antitumor effect 
was not statistically significant at 0.1 mg/kg for EU Herceptin treated animals.

2.5.2.2.  Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
No secondary pharmacodynamics studies were performed. 
2.5.2.3.  Safety pharmacology programme 
No stand-alone studies have been conducted with EG12014. 
2.5.2.4.  Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic drug interaction studies were performed with EG12014. 
2.5.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The  non-clinical  program  of  EG12014  included  a  single-dose  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  study  in  mice, 
conducted to demonstrate similarity of EG12014 to the reference product EU Herceptin. The study was 
carried out at an early development stage of EG12014 (R&D lot B14007) in 2015. 
Methods of analysis 
An  enzyme  linked  immunosorbent  assay  (ELISA)  based  method  was  used  for  the  quantitative 
determination  of  trastuzumab  (EG12014  or  EU  Herceptin)  in  mouse  serum  (qualification  report  SC-
14/147-001). To assess accuracy and precision, both EG12014 and Herceptin qualification samples were 
analysed  in  5  independent  assay  runs  analysed  by  3  analysts  at  5  concentration  levels  covering  the 
anticipated assay range. One assay failed because the standard curve failed.  
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 27/99 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
The data for the calibration standards and quality control (QC) samples indicated that the method was 
performed reliably during the study sample analysis. The calibration curve ranged from 0.25 to 100.0 
μg/mL and the linearity (mean R2) of the calibration curves was 0.995. The lower limit of quantification 
(LLOQ) and the upper limit of quantification (ULOQ) for trastuzumab in mouse serum samples was 1.00 
μg/mL and 80.0 μg/mL, respectively. All runs passed the acceptance criteria for accuracy (% relative 
error [RE]) and precision (% coefficient of variation [CV]). All QC replicate responses were ± 20 %RE 
and ≤20 %CV of the nominal value. In mouse serum, EG12014 was stable through 5 freeze-thaw cycles. 
The stability at room temperature and at 2-8 ֯C was 24 hours.  
Absorption 
A  pharmacokinetic  (non-GLP)  study  in  male  CD1  mice  after  single  IV  administration  with 
EG12014 (Study No. 146393) 
Eight to nine weeks old male CD-1 mice were divided into four groups comprising 75 animals in each 
group and received a single IV bolus injection of EG12014 at doses of 1 mg/kg (Group 1), 10 mg/kg 
(Group 2), 100 mg/kg (Group 3) or 10 mg/kg of EU Herceptin (Group 4). Blood samples for determination 
of PK parameters were collected at 15 time points: pre-dose, 0.25, 1, 6, 24 hours and 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 10, 
15, 20, 28, 56 days after dosing and separated into serum. Five animals were used for each time point 
in each study group. Serum trastuzumab concentrations for PK analysis were measured using an ELISA 
based method and PK parameters were calculated by non-compartmental analysis. 
The test doses of 1, 10 and 100 mg/kg were selected based on previously conducted comparative non-
clinical studies for trastuzumab in mice (Trazimera, 2017, Hurst et al., 2014). The dose of 10 mg/kg was 
chosen to be compared between EG12014 and EU Herceptin as it was the most representative equivalent 
dose to the recommended clinical dose (i.e. weekly maintenance doses of 2 mg/kg in patients with HER2-
overexpressing  early  or  metastatic  breast  cancer)  (EU  Herceptin  SmPC,  2021)  among  the  three  test 
doses.  
The  PK  parameters  and  PK  parameter  ratios  of  EG12014  and  EU  Herceptin  calculated  from  mean 
trastuzumab  serum  concentrations  are  presented  in  Table  3.  IV  administration  of  EG12014  or  EU 
Herceptin at 10 mg/kg resulted in comparable trastuzumab exposures (AUC0-t: 19,342 hr*μg/mL and 
21,599 hr*μg/mL for EG12014 and EU Herceptin, respectively; AUC0-inf: 22,648 hr*μg/mL and 22,142 
hr*μg/mL for EG12014 and EU Herceptin, respectively).  
EG12014 or EU Herceptin showed comparable values for Vz (189 mL/kg and 168 mL/kg) and CL (0.442 
mL/hr/kg and 0.452 mL/hr/kg), and comparable t1/2 (297 hours and 258 hours). At the last PK timepoint 
(1344  hrs  post-dose)  both  EG12014  and  EU  Herceptin  serum  concentrations  were  below  the  level  of 
quantification (BLQ) for almost all mice sampled. All PK parameters showed less than 20% difference 
between EG12014 and EU Herceptin except for Cmax which was 23% higher for EG12014 (190 μg/mL) 
compared  to  EU  Herceptin  (154  μg/mL)  despite  comparable  tmax  (0.25  hours  for  EG12014  and  EU 
Herceptin).

A recalculation of PK parameters was conducted due to several apparent outliers, and the desire for a 
more robust method of addressing BLQ values. Hence, the same PK calculation as originally performed 
were  reconducted  with  the  following  changes  to  obtain  more  robust  PK  results:  (1)  The  originally 
performed PK calculation was based on mean serum trastuzumab concentrations; the recalculation was 
based  on  median  serum  trastuzumab  concentrations;  (2)  For  the  originally  performed  PK  calculation, 
means of serum trastuzumab concentrations at any individual time point were only calculated if at least 
2/3 of the values were above the LLOQ per time point; furthermore, for the calculation of mean values, 
the  data  point  which  was  <LLOQ  were  set  to  zero.  These  restrictions  were  not  applied  for  the  PK 
recalculation; (3) For the PK recalculation, the first value which was <LLOQ was set to ½BLQ (i.e. 0.5 x 
1.00 μg/mL).  
The  PK  parameters  and  PK  parameter  ratios  of  EG12014  and  EU  Herceptin  calculated  from  median 
trastuzumab serum concentrations are presented in Table 4.

2.5.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Trastuzumab is already marketed and no significant increase in environmental exposure is anticipated 
with Herwenda. Furthermore, the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products 
for  Human  Use”  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00  corr.  2)  makes  specific  reference  for  certain  types  of 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 30/99 
 
  
 
 
products such as proteins, that due to their nature they are unlikely to result in a significant risk to the 
environment.  
2.5.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
As  indicated  in  Guideline  on  similar  biological  medicinal  products  containing  monoclonal  antibodies  – 
non-clinical and clinical issues (EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010), a stepwise approach should be applied 
when evaluating non-clinical biosimilarity. Step 1 comprises several comparative in vitro studies. As the 
in vitro assays may be more specific and sensitive than studies in animals, these assays are considered 
paramount  in  the  nonclinical  comparability  exercise.  Based  on  the  in  vitro  assay  findings,  a  decision 
should  then  be  made  as  to  the  extent  of  what,  if  any,  in  vivo  work  will  be  required.    For  Herwenda, 
however, an in vivo pharmacology study was conducted at an early research/development stage. 
A number of in vitro functional assays were conducted to substantiate similarity between EG12014 and 
the  EU  reference  product  Herceptin  with  regard  to  biological  activities  associated  with  Fab-  and  Fc-
mediated functions of trastuzumab (see 2.4. Quality aspects). 
An in vivo study was performed to compare the tumour growth inhibitory potential in a xenograft mouse 
model  with  BT-474  breast  carcinoma  cells  (EG1204  and  EU  Herceptin).  EG12014  and  EU  Herceptin 
showed a similar tumour growth inhibition rate relative to control animals.  
The  in  vivo  PD  study  in  a  xenograft  model  showed  no  statistically  significant  differences  in  tumour 
inhibitory efficacy between EG12014 and Herceptin. This study was conducted when EG12014 was at its 
research and development stage in 2014/2015 and was retrospectively revisited in 2020/2021 by the 
sponsor in preparation for this MAA. The 2015 final Report of findings (version 1, dated 12-Feb-2015) 
was expanded, with more details of the study, in 2021, providing a revised, more comprehensive report, 
103XX317-1  version  2  (dated  01-September-2021).  Although  the  original  data  are  provided  in  the 
Report,  the documentation  sources  of  raw  data  at  the  Department of  Pharmacology,  the  Institute  for 
Drug Evaluation Platform, Development Center for Biotechnology (hereinafter termed “DCB”), where the 
study  was  conducted  in  2014/2015,  are  no  longer  available.  This  was  according  to  the  applicant 
attributed to the fact that the DCB was contracted to keep study documents and specimens for up to 1 
year  after  the  reports  were  finalized,  namely  until  2016.  The  study  could,  however,  be  regarded  as 
supportive. 
Studies on secondary pharmacodynamics, safety pharmacology and pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
were not conducted, in line with EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010. 
The analytical method showed acceptable results in terms of precision, accuracy, and stability. Serum 
trastuzumab concentrations were determined by an ELISA assay, shown to be precise and accurate for 
the quantitative determination of trastuzumab in mouse serum samples. 
The  comparison  of  the  PK  was  conducted  at  only  one  dose  level  (10  mg/kg)  that  was  the  most 
representative equivalent dose to the recommended clinical dose (i.e. weekly maintenance doses of 2 
mg/kg  in  patients  with  HER2-overexpressing  early  or  metastatic  breast  cancer)  (EU  Herceptin  SmPC, 
2021) among the three test doses.  
The PK parameters AUC0-t, AUC0-inf, Vz, CL, t1/2 and tmax of trastuzumab were comparable between 
EG12014 and EU Herceptin after a single dose of 10 mg/kg in mice. Cmax was, however, approximately 
30%  higher  for  EG12014  than  EU  Herceptin.  A  high  inter-animal  coefficient  of  variation  of  serum 
trastuzumab  concentrations  ≤1  hour  after  administration  might  have  limited  the  evaluation  on  Cmax 
comparability and contributed to the observed variability. 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 31/99 
 
  
 
 
In the CHMP SA from 2015 it was stated that a definitive conclusion regarding the PK similarity between 
EG12014 and Herceptin could not be reached, since the study only included one dose level of Herceptin. 
Human PK data have however confirmed PK similarity between EG12014, EU Herceptin and US Herceptin 
in terms of AUC0-inf, AUC0-t and Cmax (Phase 1 study EGC001 in healthy volunteers). Thus, the lack 
of additional Herceptin dose levels in the PK study in mice is considered acceptable (see 2.6). 
The  lack  of  distribution,  metabolism,  excretion  and  interaction  studies  is  acceptable,  and  in  line  with 
EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010. 
Pharmacokinetic  properties  of  EG12014  and  Herceptin  were  characterised  in  mice  following  single  iv 
infusions. An ELISA assay was used for quantification of EG12014 and Herceptin concentrations in mouse 
serum (ELISA). The analytical method is of adequate quality and is considered fit for purpose. 
In mice, the main serum concentration profile and pharmacokinetic parameters of EG12014 were similar 
to  EU-Herceptin  after  iv  administration  of  10  mg/kg.  Maximum  serum  concentrations  (Cmax)  were 
however 34% higher for EG12014 than for EU Herceptin despite similar time to reach Cmax. The inter-
animal variability in serum trastuzumab concentrations ≤1 hour after administration was approximately 
30% in the EG12014 and EU Herceptin treatment groups. The differences in Cmax values are considered 
related to study conduct. 
To conclude, the PK study in mice indicated similarity in most of the serum PK parameters, except for 
Cmax  values  that  differed  by  approximately  30%  due  to  inter-individual  variability.  Human  PK  data, 
however, have confirmed PK similarity between EG12014, EU Herceptin and US Herceptin in terms of 
AUC0-inf, AUC0-t and Cmax (Phase 1 study EGC001 in healthy volunteers). For the PK comparability, 
human  data  are  considered  more  informative  and,  hence,  supersede  the  animal  data,  including  the 
formation of ADAs (see 2.6). 
No distribution, metabolism or excretion studies were performed. This is acceptable, and in accordance 
with guideline EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1. 
The  lack  of  single-dose  and  repeat-dose  toxicity  studies,  genotoxicity  studies,  reproductive  or 
developmental  toxicity  studies  and  of  other  toxicity  studies  is  considered  acceptable  and  in  line  with 
current guidelines.  
EG12014 is a monoclonal antibody, unlikely to pose a significant risk to the environment. Environmental 
risk assessment studies are therefore not required, in accordance with EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00.  
2.5.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
EG12014 can be considered similar to the reference product Herceptin from a non-clinical point of view. 
2.6.  Clinical aspects 
2.6.1.  Introduction 
GCP aspects 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The applicant has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.  
The clinical program comprised a phase 1 pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity study (EGC001) in healthy 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 32/99 
 
  
 
 
males, and a phase 3 efficacy and safety study (EGC002) in female HERB-2 positive EBC patients. 
Immunogenicity has been evaluated in both clinical studies. Population pharmacokinetic (popPK) 
modelling of EG12014 and Herceptin in patients with HER2+ EBC using data from the neoadjuvant part 
of study EGC002 is submitted as supportive PK information. In accordance with 
EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/42832/2005 Rev1 and EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/31329/2005, further PK studies are not 
considered relevant for the development of a biosimilar product. Due to absence of validated PD 
biomarkers for trastuzumab, clinical PD and PK/PD studies were not performed. 
Study EGC002 is a randomised, multicentre, double-blind study in female HER2-positive early breast 
cancer (EBC) patients with the primary objective to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence between 
EG12014 and EU Herceptin in terms of efficacy and to compare the safety, immunogenicity and PK 
between the trastuzumab products. In accordance with the EMA SA (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/306598/2017) 
the use of EU Herceptin as comparator in this study was considered justified since comparative 
analytical and PK data of the pivotal EGC001 study provided the scientific bridge between EG12014, 
EU Herceptin and US Herceptin.

Two  clinical  studies  were  submitted  to  support  PK  similarity  between  Herwenda  and  Herceptin:  One 
pivotal phase I study, and a phase III study with secondary PK endpoint. 
Study EGC001 was a double blind, randomised, parallel-group, single-dose, three-arm, two-stage study 
in healthy male subjects. 
EMA/514898/2023

Study EGC002 is a randomised, multi-center, double-blind study in female HER2-positive early breast 
cancer  (EBC)  patients  with  the  primary  objective  to  demonstrate  therapeutic  equivalence  between 
EG12014  and  EU  Herceptin  in  terms  of  efficacy  and  to  compare  the  safety,  immunogenicity  and  PK 
between the trastuzumab products. 
In support, trastuzumab PK following administration of either EG12014 or Herceptin in the neoadjuvant 
part of study EGC002  were characterised using two separate PopPK models.  The effect of age, race, 
weight, clinical laboratory parameters, ECOG status and immunogenicity status were explored for both 
models. 
Analytical methods 
The concentration of free trastuzumab was determined in serum samples from healthy individuals (study 
EGC001) and in serum samples from HER-2 positive EBC patients (EGC002) using an ELISA method. 
The ELISA method was shown to be accurate and precise within the detection range of 2,000-70,000 
ng/mL EG12014 in human serum. A concentration of up to 2000 ng/ml recombinant human ErbB2/HER2 
did not interfere with the assay. No effect was observed by 2.5% or 5% hemolysate or lipemic matrix. 
Long term stability of samples was addressed by QC samples (5,000 ng/ml or 60,000 ng/ml) stored at 
-70 or -20°C for 8 days, which is in line with the storage of study samples. 
No samples for serum HER2 testing were collected and therefore no analysis has been carried out for 
the determination of HER2 levels in human breast cancer patient serum. High HER2 levels can interfere 
with the detection of trastuzumab and patients with higher baseline shed antigen levels are likely to have 
lower serum trough concentrations of trastuzumab. However, based on popPK, it is concluded that the 
serum HER2 concentrations among the population enrolled into the EGC002 study are much lower than 
the model predicted serum HER2 concentrations necessary to alter trastuzumab PK. In addition, it has 
been demonstrated in study EGC002 that levels up to 2,000 ng/mL serum HER2 did not interfere with 
the detection of EG12014. 
Screening,  confirmatory  and  characterisation  assays  were  used  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of 
trastuzumab (see section 2.6.8.7. ). Samples with signals above the screening cut point were considered 
positive and further analysed with the confirmatory assay. Confirmed positive ADA samples were further 
characterised by performing serial dilutions to determine the titer and neutralising capacity was analysed 
by a validated NAb screening assay. In study EGC001 (healthy individuals) the contract laboratory IPM 
GmbH  conducted  and  validated  the  ECLA  assay  for  ADA  analysis,  whereas  in  study  EGC002  (HER-2 
positive EBC patients) the ECLA assay was conducted and validated by ICON Laboratory Services. 
An electrochemiluminescence (ECL) technology using a bridging assay format has been applied for the 
detection of ADAs directed against trastuzumab in human serum samples collected in studies EGC001 
(healthy  subjects;  contract  laboratory  IPM  GmbH)  and  EGC002  (HER2-positive  EBC  patients;  ICON 
Laboratories  services).  In  the  applied  assays,  SULFO-tag  labelled  EG12014  is  used  for  capturing  and 
detection of ADAs against trastuzumab. Biotinylated EG12014 is used for capturing and bind the SULFO-
tag-ADA complex to the microtiter plate. To increase drug tolerance, an acid dissociation pre-analytical 
step is included. The ECL signal detected is proportional to the amount of ADAs present in the sample. 
The NAb assay used a (non-cell-based) competitive ligand binding (CLB) format reflecting the mechanism 
of  action  (MOA)  of  trastuzumab,  which  involves  the  binding  of  trastuzumab  to  HER2.  The  CLB  assay 
measures  the  binding  of  trastuzumab  to  HER2  and  inhibition  of  the  binding  if  NAbs  are  present. 
Biotinylated EG12014 was used to capture NAbs present in serum samples and to bind the NAbs to a 
streptavidin coated binding plate. The captured NAbs were eluted by acid dissociation, transferred to an 
EG12014-coated plate, and incubated with a SULFO-tag labelled target molecule.

Clinical studies 
In the pivotal PK study, the primary PK endpoint was AUC0-inf of trastuzumab. Additional endpoints were 
the  maximum  serum  concentration  (Cmax),  AUC  from  time  zero  to  the  last  observed  concentration  at 
time t (AUC0-t), residual area under the curve (AUCres), terminal elimination half-life (t1/2), time to reach 
Cmax (Tmax), apparent volume of distribution at terminal phase (Vz), elimination rate constant at terminal 
phase (λz), and total body clearance (CL). 
The trial was performed according to a two-stage design with interim power monitoring and sample size 
adaption as described by Potvin et al (Figure 2). The nominal alpha values to be used at stage 1 and at 
stage  2  evaluations  were  chosen  as  alpha1=0.0294  and  alpha2=0.0294.  These  values  are  shown  by 
Potvin et al. to maintain an overall alpha=0.05 of the two-stage test procedure.  
Figure 2. Two-stage design for the pivotal PK study 
The study was regarded as final at stage 1 since PK similarity between EG12014, EU Herceptin and US 
Herceptin for the primary endpoint (AUC0-inf of trastuzumab) was demonstrated. 
In the phase III study, blood samples for PK analysis were sampled as described in Table 4. Peak and 
trough concentrations were summarised by descriptive statistics according to treatment, cycle (C) and 
collection time. 
Pivotal PK study EGC001 
For the phase I clinical study EGC001, no GCP inspections have been conducted or requested, nor have 
been announced by any regulatory authority according to the applicant’s knowledge. The sponsor has 
performed audits at the study site and the bioanalytical laboratory, and confirms that the study has been 
conducted and analysed in accordance with international GCP requirements. 
Following  a  single  dose  IV  infusion  of  6  mg/kg  trastuzumab,  mean  (±SD)  trastuzumab  serum 
concentration-time profiles by treatment group are presented in the figure below:

However, it is noted that all subjects had Cmax above the calibration curve (Cmax range in the pivotal PK 
study 88.000-211.000 ng/ml; mean Cmax in the phase 3 study around 180.000 ng/ml; calibration curve 
2.000 to 70.000 ng/ml). 
Sparse PK data have been collected during the phase 3 EGC002 study. Geometric mean peak and trough 
values for EG12014 and Herceptin in patients HER2 positive EBC receiving the 8 mg/kg + 6 mg/kg Q3W 
dosing regimen were comparable in neoadjuvant cycles C5-C8.  
Population pharmacokinetic modelling 
Separate  population  pharmacokinetic  (popPK)  models  were  developed  for  EG12014  and  Herceptin  in 
patients with HER2+ EBC using data from the neoadjuvant part of Study EGC002 (i.e. 383 patients and 
2927 observations for EG12014, and 380 patients and 2805 observations for Herceptin). Both EG12014 
and Herceptin PK were described by two-compartment disposition models with zero-order input and first-
order elimination, and with IIV on all parameters. Both CL and Vc increased with baseline body weight 
(Table 11).

The shrinkages of individual random effects for CL, Vc, Q and Vp were estimated as 12, 12, 51, and 31% 
for Run EGR004 and as 8, 13, 40 and 37% for Run HER004. Body weight explained some of the observed 
variability, e.g. IIV for CL were 24.7 %CV and 31.0 %CV in base models and 23.6 %CV and 27.1 %CV 
in final models for EG12014 and Herceptin, respectively.

For  a  typical  patient  of  70  kg,  the  linear  CL  (0.166  and  0.160  L/day)  and  Vc  (3.06  and  3.12  L)  for 
EG12014 and Herceptin, respectively, were similar between treatment groups (Table below). Also, the 
non-linear elimination component was comparable between drug products. 
The PK parameter estimates for the updated database containing both neoadjuvant and adjuvant data 
from  study  EGC002  (i.e.  9  139  post-dose  trastuzumab  concentrations  from  795  patients)  are  shown 
below. To improve model fit of the observed data, the popPK models’ structures were updated to describe 
elimination  as  a  combination  of  non-linear  and  non-linear  target-mediated  elimination  (which  was 
observed between the neoadjuvant and adjuvant treatment with trastuzumab).

2.6.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical development program for the applied drug product was conducted in accordance with current 
EMA guidelines relevant for biosimilars, and in accordance with Scientific Advice received from the CHMP. 
The proposed indications, body-weight-based dosage, and IV route of administration for EG12014 are 
identical to those for EU Herceptin. 
The concentration of free trastuzumab was determined in serum samples from healthy individuals (study 
EGC001)  and  in  serum  samples  from  HER-2  positive  EBC  patients  (EGC002)  using  an  ELISA  method. 
The ELISA method was shown to be accurate and precise within the detection range of 2,000-70,000 
ng/mL EG12014 in human serum. 
Screening,  confirmatory  and  characterisation  assays  were  used  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of 
trastuzumab. See section 2.6.9. Discussion on clinical safety. 
EMA Scientific advice was received on the two-stage design approach of the pivotal PK study EGC001 
and  this  approach  was  supported  (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/466179/2015,  EMA/CHMP/SAWP/306598/2017). 
In the case of a monoclonal antibody with per definition a long half-life and a potential of immunogenicity, 
a  parallel  design  is  accepted  by  EMA  and  commonly  used.  Efforts  were  made  to  reduce  the  risk  for 
potential  imbalance  between  the  groups.  Crossover  study  is  not  practical,  due  to  the  long  half-lives 
leading to long treatment periods and long washout interval. PK sampling up to 70 days was considered 
adequate. The study design was considered acceptable. 
The  test  and  reference  products  and  the  mode  of  administration  were  considered  adequate  for  a 
bioequivalence study. The certificates of analysis of the bio-batches and the protein concentrations for 
each  product  were  presented  in  annex  16.1.1  to  the  clinical  study  report.  The  test-  and  reference 
products were comparable in terms of assay (well within the ± 5% requirement). 
The pivotal phase I PK study EGC001 in healthy volunteers, apparently demonstrates similarity of the 
pharmacokinetics of EG12014 and Herceptin. Following a single dose IV infusion of 6 mg/kg trastuzumab, 
highly similar pharmacokinetic profiles were observed among all three groups of subjects. No significant 
differences  in  serum  exposures  or  half-life  of  trastuzumab  was  observed  between  Test  (EG12014), 
Reference 1 (EU Herceptin) or Reference 2 (US Herceptin) trastuzumab products. 
For all subjects, after administration of both EG12014 and Herceptin, the percentage of the AUC0-inf due 
to extrapolation was less than 15% demonstrating that the sampling schedule ensured the majority of 
AUC was captured. 
The  applicant  referred  to  EPARs  for  other  trastuzumab  biosimilars  Trazimera,  Ogivri  and  Ontruzant, 
where  similar  observations  to  the  results  of  comparative  statistical  evaluation  concerning 
pharmacokinetic (PK) similarity of the test IMP compared to each one of both Reference IMPs with respect 
to the primary endpoint AUC0-∞ and additional endpoint AUC0-t of trastuzumab were made: Trazimera 
vs.  EU  Herceptin  (86.03%  -  98.69%),  Ogivri  vs.  EU  Herceptin  (89%  -  99%)  and  Ontruzant  vs.  US 
Herceptin (87% - 99%). These results support the conclusion of biosimilarity of EG12014 to the reference 
product Herceptin in terms of PK, irrespective of the observation that the 90.0% CI fell below 100% for 
the GMR of AUC0-inf and AUC0-t. 
In the phase 3 study EGC002, trastuzumab median concentrations pre-dose and 1-hour post-dose were 
comparable  for  the  EG12014  and  Herceptin  treatment  arms  and  consistent  for  the  two  arms  at 
neoadjuvant Cycles 5, 6, 7, and 8 visits, and at the pre-surgery visit. Comparable exposures were also 
observed in the adjuvant phase. 
The  results  from  the  two  clinical  studies  indicate  that  the  test  product  EG12014  and  Herceptin  are 
bioequivalent. 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 46/99 
 
  
 
 
Similar  PK  (CL  and  Vc)  of  EG12014  and  Herceptin  in  EBC  patients  is  also  indicated  based  on  popPK 
modelling  using  sparse  PK  data  from  the  neoadjuvant  part  of  study  ECG002.  Similar  steady  state  PK 
were  indicated  in  the  updated  and  refined  model  analysis  using  PK  observations  from  both  the 
neoadjuvant and adjuvant parts of study EGC002 (D121 response). Based on examination of GoF plots, 
the models were able to describe the central tendency and the variability of the available data reasonably 
well for the current use of the models. 
Analyses in special populations are not relevant in the context of a biosimilar application. No formal drug-
drug interaction studies are considered needed. 
2.6.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK data support biosimilarity of EG12014 versus the reference product Herceptin.

 The EGC002 study 
The pivotal phase III study EGC002 was performed in patients with HER2-positive early breast cancer. 
The objective was to demonstrate therapeutic equivalence of EG12014 and EU Herceptin (clinical efficacy 
and  safety)  as  neoadjuvant  treatment  in  combination  with  anthracycline/paclitaxel-based  systemic 
therapy. It is a randomised, multicentre, double-blinded study. Study completion was 20 Jan 2022. 
Primary endpoint for the pivotal phase III study is the risk difference of pathological complete response. 
The study is divided into 2 parts: The neoadjuvant part (Part 1) consists of data until the interim analysis 
with database lock in February 2021, including the first randomisation. This part is the basis of this MAA. 
The  adjuvant  part  (Part  2)  was  finished  by  the  time  of  responses  to  the  Day  120  LoQ.  The  applicant 
finalised their report by September 2022, based on database lock date 18 February 2022.

•  Treatments 
Neoadjuvant study treatment 
Patients fulfilling the eligibility criteria were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to one of two active, parallel 
trastuzumab treatment groups (EG12014 or Herceptin), as seen in 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 50/99 
 
  
 
 
 
 
Figure 8. 
1.  Study  subjects  received  four  3-week  cycles  Anthracycline-based  chemotherapy  (90  mg/m2 
epirubicin; 600 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide; given as separate intravenously, IV, infusions). The 
applicant based their choice of epirubicin rather than doxorubicin on the fact that epirubicin is 
known to have a slightly more favourable cardiovascular toxicity profile and is more commonly 
applied in Canada, Europe and parts of Asia. 
2.  Four  3-weekly  cycles  paclitaxel  (175  mg/m2;  IV  infusion)  and  trastuzumab  (EG12014  or  EU 
Herceptin; loading dose: 8 mg/kg; maintenance dose: 6 mg/kg body, IV infusion).  
3.  Surgery consisted of breast and axillary lymph nodes resection at 3 to 6 weeks after completion 
of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (approximately Week 24 to 27). During surgery, either segmental 
or  total  mastectomy,  samples  were  collected  for  assessment of  pCR  as  the primary  endpoint. 
Hole-breast radiation was offered to all patients with breast-conserving surgery. 
Adjuvant study treatment following surgery 
Eligibility  criterion  for  adjuvant  therapy  were  no  sequelae,  e.g.,  impairment  in  cardiac  function,  have 
occurred after neoadjuvant therapy.  
Treatment  with  trastuzumab  started  2  to  6  weeks  after  surgery.  Patients  previously  administered 
EG12014 continued with EG12014 treatment. Those previously treated with i.v. Herceptin were randomly 
assigned (Randomisation 2 [1:1]) to either switch to treatment with EG12014 or to continue Herceptin. 
In the protocol, a 3:1 randomisation was planned in the Herceptin study arm, while the EG12014 arm 
was  planned  for  a  mock  randomisation.  The  randomisation  was  planned  to  occur  at  visit  12,  after 
eligibility  for  the  adjuvant  part.  Interactive  response  technology  was  applied  in  the  randomisation 
process, which is no further described. Treatment was continued up to 12 months of monotherapy with 
trastuzumab, with safety follow-up until 20 weeks after final dose of study drug. Trastuzumab (EG12014 
or EU Herceptin; loading dose: 8 mg/kg; maintenance dose: 6 mg/kg, IV infusion every 3 weeks) was 
continued to complete 12 months of overall trastuzumab treatment.  
All data from the neoadjuvant part of the EGC002 study are based on the interim analysis. Data from 
the adjuvant part of the EGC002 study are based on final analysis. 
•  Objectives 
The  primary  objective  for  this  study  was  to  demonstrate  therapeutic  equivalence  of  EG12014  and 
Herceptin of EU origin in subjects with HER2+ early breast cancer.  
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
The efficacy of EG12014 was determined by pathological complete response (pCR), regardless of in-situ 
changes, assessed by a central laboratory.  
A stratified 2-sided 95% CI for the pCR probability difference was calculated for the different data sets. 
The null hypothesis H0 was rejected if the stratified 2-sided 95% CI for the pCR probability difference 
was covered by the equivalence region (-0.13; 0.13).  
The secondary objectives were: Further evaluation of pCR at surgery (1. absence of residual invasive 
cancer and of in-situ changes. 2. Absence of invasive cancer in breast tissue only), event-free survival, 
EFS, overall response, ORR, and overall survival, OS, in addition to immunogenicity. 
•  Sample size 
Sample size determination was based on the following considerations of the primary endpoint:  
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 51/99 
 
  
 
 
 
1.  Neoadjuvant pCR risk difference 
2.  The equivalence region for pCR risk difference: [-0.13, 0.13] 
3.  Two-sided 95% CI for pCR risk difference 
4.  True pCR probability of 0.35 EG12014 and EU Herceptin based on historical data 
Drop-outs during the neoadjuvant study part included in the primary statistical efficacy analysis as pCR 
non-responders (same for patients with missing pCR data due to other reasons). 
These assumptions resulted in a planned sample size of 400 patients in the EG12014 treatment group 
and  400  patients  in  the  EU  Herceptin  treatment  group  (in  total  800  patients)  and  a  power  of 
approximately 95% for the FAS-neo, and 93% for the PPS-neo, assuming 5% of FAS-neo patients were 
excluded  from  the  PPS-neo.  The  sample  size  was  discussed  with  EMA  prior  to  study  conduct 
(EMA/CHMP/SAWP/306598/2017). 
•  Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The randomization scheme and codes were not provided in the interim Clinical Study Report (CSR Part 
1). This information was included in the final Clinical Study Report (CSR Parts 1 + 2). 
The  EGC002  study  includes  two  points  of  randomisation:  In  the  allocation  to  neoadjuvant  treatment 
(study part 1) and to adjuvant treatment (study part 2). The randomisation was done during a visit, at 
a point where all screening procedures were completed. Randomisation was stratified by tumour stage 
(stage II or IIIa), ER status and geographic region.  
At the end of study part 1, a second randomisation was planned. This randomisation happened at visit 
no. 12, either a randomisation or a sham/mock-randomisation in a 1:1 ratio. Study participants who had 
complications  of  treatment  in  the  neoadjuvant  part  were  excluded.  In  the  second  randomisation, 
interactive response technology was applied. The two study arms were further divided into three arms 
in part two (as seen in the study flow chart, Figure 8). The second randomisation affected only study 
subjects in the Herceptin arm, while the study subjects in the EG12014 arm were involved in a sham-
randomisation. According to the protocol, a randomisation ratio of 3:1 was originally planned. However, 
the second randomisation was later changed to a 1:1 ratio. This randomisation in the Herceptin arm is 
termed the switch strategy. 
•  Statistical methods 
Analysis sets, neoadjuvant part (Part 1) 
Full Analysis Set (FAS-neo): All patients randomized at the start of the neoadjuvant study part, analysed 
according to the randomized treatment group (Herceptin or EG12014). Per-Protocol Set (PPS-neo): All 
patients in the FAS-neo who did not experience any major protocol deviations having a potential impact 
on the primary efficacy endpoint pCR up to the end of the neoadjuvant study part, who received at least 
one dose of study drug in the neoadjuvant part and underwent surgery.  
Safety Set (SAF-neo): All patients in the FAS-neo who received at least one dose of study treatment in 
the  neoadjuvant  study  part.  Patients  will  be  analysed  according  to  the  actual  study  drug  received 
(EG12014,  Herceptin,  or  none).  If  a  patient  receives  both  EG12014  and  Herceptin  in  error  in  the 
neoadjuvant study part, then the treatment group assigned for the statistical analysis will be that of the 
first dose of study drug they received in the neoadjuvant study part.  
PK Set (PK-neo): All patients in the SAF-neo who had at least one study drug concentration recorded 
after administration of study drug (Herceptin or EG12014) in the neoadjuvant study part. 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 52/99 
 
  
 
 
 
Analysis sets for neoadjuvant + adjuvant part (Part 1 + 2) 
Full Analysis Set (FAS): All patients randomized at the start of the neo-adjuvant study part. Patients will 
be  analyzed  according  to  the  randomized  treatment  group  (Herceptin  or  Herceptin/EG12014,  or 
EG12014). 
Per-Protocol  Set  (PPS):  All  patients  in  the  FAS  who  did  not  experience  any  major  protocol  deviations 
having a potential impact on the primary efficacy endpoint pCR and received at least one dose of study 
drug in both the neoadjuvant and adjuvant study parts and underwent surgery. 
Primary efficacy analysis 
To analyse therapeutic equivalence, the difference in pCR proportion between the two study arms was 
estimated. Therapeutic equivalence was claimed when the stratified 2-sided Newcombe 95% confidence 
interval  (CI)  for  the  pCR  probability  difference  was  covered  by  the  equivalence  region  (-0.13;  0.13). 
Therapeutic  equivalence  regions  for  pCR  probability  difference  were  justified  by  fixed  effects  meta-
analyses  of  existing  studies  comparing  Herceptin  plus  chemotherapy  against  chemotherapy  alone, 
according  to  protocol.  The  analysis  was  stratified  by  tumor  stage  (stage  II  or  stage  IIIa),  ER  status 
(positive  or  negative)  and  geographic  region.  The  result  was  compared  to  the  corresponding  95% 
confidence interval to equivalence margins. The analysis was done in both the intention-to-treat and the 
per-protocol population. 
The null hypothesis for the primary statistical analysis 
H0: |πEG - πHer| ≥ 0.13 (“pCR probabilities differ by at least 0.13”) was tested against the respective 
alternative hypothesis: 
HA: -0.13 < πEG - πHer < 0.13 (“pCR probabilities differ by less than 0.13”). 
An equivalence region of (-0.13; 0.13) for pCR probability differences was justified in two randomized 
studies  of  Herceptin  plus  chemotherapy  versus  chemotherapy  alone,  as  seen  in  Table  14.  Treatment 
effects expressed as pCR probability differences were estimated as 0.389 in the Buzdar et al. study and 
0.190 in the NOAH/Gianni et al. study. 
Table 15. Meta-analysis for the equivalence margins of pCR 
Interim Analyses 
Interim analysis for efficacy and safety after completion of the neoadjuvant part was conducted on the 
12th of February 2021. Time of interim analysis was planned to be when all data from the neoadjuvant 
part were at the clinical research organization. Further, interim analysis was planned when all related 
data  queries  had  been  resolved,  and  the  assignment  of  participants  to  the  analysis  sets  had  been 
completed, the study was unblinded to a dedicated team of statisticians, otherwise not involved in study 
operations.  The  entire  study  team,  site  personnel,  participants,  and  third-party  providers  remained 
blinded. The Sponsor was partially unblinded for the interim clinical study report (Part 1) and regulatory 
submission document preparation. All data from the neoadjuvant part and the available safety data from 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 53/99 
 
  
 
 
  
the adjuvant part were analysed and reported in CSR part 1. Final analyses were reported in CSR part 
1+2. 
Multiplicity 
There  is  no  need  for  any  multiplicity  adjustment  as  only  one  pre-specified  hypothesis  linked  to  the 
primary objective was tested for the EMA analysis. Moreover, no hypothesis testing was planned for the 
secondary endpoints and the statistics were purely descriptive.

In  sum,  807  subjects  were  enrolled  in  the  study,  of  which  405  in  the  EG12014  arm  and  402  in  the 
Herceptin  arm.  In  Table  18  baseline  characteristics  and  demographics  of  the  study  participants  are 
shown.  
Allocation: Randomisation of participants to the neoadjuvant part of the study, occurred at visit 2 after 
all  screening  procedures  had  been  performed  and  eligibility  for  the  study  had  been  confirmed.  After 
surgery, patients were eligible for adjuvant therapy with blinded EG12014 or Herceptin monotherapy if 
no sequelae have occurred after neoadjuvant therapy, in particular cardiac function.  
For the adjuvant study part, (mock) randomisation of patients to adjuvant study treatments occurred at 
visit 12 after eligibility for the adjuvant study part has been confirmed. For any (mock) randomisation 
of patients, the investigator applied an interactive response technology.

Protocol deviations: Protocol deviations involved 666 subjects (83%) in the neoadjuvant part of the study 
(FAS-neo).  The  total  number  of  protocol  deviations  of  the  neoadjuvant  part  of  the  study  were  2426. 
Major protocol deviations included 129 (16%) study participants, with 164 (7%) events in total. Major 
protocol  deviation  included  (in  descending  order)  study  procedure  or  assessment,  randomisation 
procedure,  study  medication,  visit  completion  or  timing,  serious  adverse  events,  adverse  events, 
inclusion/exclusion criteria or informed consent.  
In the adjuvant part, overall protocol deviations involved 338 subjects (44%), with a total number of 
634 deviations (FAS). Major protocol deviations were 103 in 80 study participants. 
•  Recruitment 
The EGC002 study was initiated on 16 October 2018. The neoadjuvant part was defined to start at visit 
no. 2 and end at the post-surgery visit, no. 11. The study was completed on 20 January 2022. 
•  Conduct of the study 
There  were  several  changes  in  the  study  conduct,  which  were  implemented  by  different  protocol 
amendments. The main changes are as follows: 
•  Adjuvant study part: Change in randomisation scheme for randomisation 2 (1:1 ratio of participants 
previously treated with Herceptin during the neoadjuvant part to receive EG12014 or Herceptin. The 
ratio was 3:1 prior to the change, with 75% receiving EG12014 and 25% Herceptin).  
• 
Planned recruitment was changed from approximately 84 centres  
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 56/99 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
•  Clarification of instruction in participants who were clinically node-negative from requirement to a 
recommendation to be further assessed by sentinel lymph node biopsy. 
•  Clarification of the duration of treatment with the study drug. 
•  Changes to the biostatistics section with a widening of the equivalence region from (-0.11, 0.11) to 
(-0.13, 0.13) and submission of the neoadjuvant part before the adjuvant part was completed. The 
widening of the equivalence margins was done by the sponsor, for the reason that other trastuzumab 
biosimilars had similar or wider equivalence margins. 
•  Central Pathology Charter removed as appendix. 
•  Baseline data 
The  demographic  and  baseline  characteristics  of  the  treatment  groups  (EG12014  and  Herceptin)  are 
presented in Table 18.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
The  primary  efficacy  endpoint  was  pathological  complete  response  (pCR)  between  EG12014  and 
Herceptin  at  the  time  of  surgery.  Pathological  complete  response  was  defined  as  absence  of  residual 
cancer, regardless of ductal carcinoma in situ. The primary analysis for equivalence was a risk difference 
test (Newcombe approach) including a 95% CI with equality margins of (-0.13; 0.13). The risk difference 
calculation was stratified by:  
Tumour stage 
• 
•  ER status 
•  Geographic region  
The risk difference (95% CI) for EG12014 vs Herceptin was -0.026 (95% CI: -0.089 to 0.037) for the 
FAS-neo  and  -0.024  (95%  CI:  -0.091  to  0.043)  for  the  PPS-neo,  as  seen  in  Table  22.  The  95%  CIs 
contained 0 and fell within the pre-defined equivalence margins (-0.13, 0.13).

Abbreviations: FAS-neo, full analysis set in the neoadjuvant part. PAS-neo, per protocol set, neoadjuvant part.  
Secondary efficacy endpoints of resected specimen 
Secondary efficacy endpoints related to resected specimen were pathological complete response without 
ductal  carcinoma  in  situ  and  pathological  complete  response  as  absence  of  invasive  cancer  in  breast 
tissue only. For the Neoadjuvant Part (FAS-neo and PPS-neo), results from secondary efficacy analysis 
of pCR without  DCIS were a risk difference of -0.026 [95% CI: -0.089 to 0.037] for the  FAS-neo and -
0.024 [95% CI: -0.091 to 0.043] for the PPS-neo). Similarly, results from analysis of pCR as absence of 
invasive cancer in breast tissue only were a risk difference of -0.001 [95% CI: -0.070 to 0.067] for the 
FAS-neo and -0.007 [95% CI: -0.079 to 0.065] for the PPS-neo). See Table 23. 
Event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) 
As of the interim analysis, 13 participants in the EG12014 arm and 22 participants in the Herceptin arm 
met the definition for EFS. For OS, three participants in the EG12014 arm and four participants in the 
Herceptin  arm  met  the  definition.  Because  of  the  small  percentage  (≤5.5%)  of  participants  with  EFS 
events in each treatment arm, no Kaplan-Meier estimates could be calculated. Similarly for OS, (≤ 1.0%) 
of participants with events in each treatment arm, no Kaplan-Meier estimates could be calculated. 
At  the  final  analysis,  25  (6.2%)  participants  in  the  EG12014  arm  and  30  (7.5%)  participants  in  the 
Herceptin arm met the definition of an event in the EFS analysis. For OS, 4 (1.0%) participants in the 
EG12014 arm and 5 (1.2%) participants in the Herceptin arm met the definition of an event. The HR 
estimate for EFS was 0.775 (95% CI 0.45, 1.33) and for OS 0.74 (95% CI: 0.20, 2.77), respectively.  
Objective response rate 
ORR is defined as PR or CR according to RECIST v1.1 in FAS-neo analysis set in neoadjuvant treatment. 
The overall ORR (PR and CR categories combined) (95% CI) were for the EG12014: 83.8% [95% CI: 
79.8%  to  87.4%]  and  for  Herceptin  83.6%  [95%  CI:  79.5%  to  87.1%]  treatment  arms.  The  overall 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 60/99 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
RECIST response in PPS-neo analysis set was 83.8% (95% CI: 79.7% to 87.4%]) for the EG12014 arm 
and 84.9% (95% CI: 80.7% to 88.4%) for the Herceptin arm. 
•  Ancillary analyses 
In two ancillary analyses the result differed from the primary endpoint:  
• 
• 
In the subgroup analysis of age, the result differed: For participants equal to 65 years of age (n 
=18 for the EG12014 arm and n = 11 for the Herceptin arm), the proportion of responders to 
EG12014 was 4/18 (22 %) and for Herceptin 5/11 (45 %). The subgroup’s risk difference (95% 
CI) was -0.449 (95% CI: -0.732 to -0.067); the 95% CI did not contain 0.  
The  number  of  progesterone  receptor  positive  responders  in  the  two  study  arms  were  for 
EG12014 n=56 and Herceptin n=78. The risk difference (95% CI) in the PrR positive category 
of EG12014 vs Herceptin was -0.071 (95% CI: -0.170 to 0.031). The 95% CI contained 0 but 
was outside the lower bound of the pre-defined equivalence margins (-0.13, 0.13). 
In the other subgroup analysis, the results were supporting the primary endpoint.

2.6.5.4.  In vitro biomarker test for patient selection for efficacy 
HER2-positivity of the tumour was defined as 3+ score by immunohistochemistry (IHC) or fluorescence 
positive by FISH. The result was confirmed centrally, according to the applicant. In the HER2 IHC test, 
a Herceptest from Dako was applied. In the case of the FISH-test, a test from Pathvision, Vysis, was 
utilised. Both tests are commercially available.

2.6.6.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  clinical  development program  to  show  potential  biosimilarity  between  EG12014  and  Herceptin  is, 
beside a pivotal PK-study (EGC001), also based on a phase III study (ECG002) comparing the efficacy 
and  safety  of  EG12014  and  Herceptin  in  neoadjuvant  and  adjuvant  treatment  in  HER2-positive  early 
breast cancer.  
A single pivotal phase III equivalence study comparing the test- and reference product was considered 
adequate by CHMP to support the biosimilar application. Overall, the in- and exclusion criteria as defined 
are considered adequate in face of the investigational setting and questions. As noted later, the study 
design includes a second randomisation step at the start of the adjuvant phase. The demographic and 
baseline characteristics including mean age, race/ethnicity (with approximately 90% Caucasian in each 
treatment arm), childbearing potential, tumour stage (with the majority [>83%] in tumour stage II), 
geographic region, hormone receptor status and time from date of diagnosis were comparable between 
the two treatment groups (EG12014 and Herceptin) in the different data sets. Mostly, the study is in line 
with the CHMP guidance: the applicant has chosen a patient population with early breast cancer (rather 
than  metastatic  breast  cancer),  which  is  considered  a  more  sensitive  population  for  evaluating 
biosimilarity.  Furthermore,  the  CHMP  accepted  widening  of  the  equivalence  margins,  that  should  be 
clinically and statistically justified, however. The second randomisation, prior to the adjuvant phase, also 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 64/99 
 
  
 
 
 
 
termed ‘the switch strategy’, was not endorsed by the CHMP. Consequently, the randomisation ratio was 
changed by the applicant from 3:1 to 1:1 (i.e., from 75% of the participants switching from Herceptin 
to EG12014, to 50% switching from Herceptin to EG12014).  
The  risk  for  loss  of  long-term  data  was  considered  present  at  the  time  of  application.  The  applicant 
claimed that the switch strategy may demonstrate interchangeability between the reference product and 
EG12014.  In  addition,  the  switch  strategy  could  increase  the  exposure  of  EG12014  in  the  studied 
population. The risk of compromising safety and survival data in subjects who received Herceptin and 
EG12014, is considered reduced by a sufficient number of study subjects in each treatment group. The 
safety and survival profile between study and reference product seem comparable and there is no need 
to further analyse study subjects in this perspective. The study was conducted in different regions of the 
world, although predominantly subjects of Caucasian origin were included. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Pathologic  complete  response  (pCR)  was  chosen  as  primary  efficacy  endpoint  for  biosimilarity 
assessment and was considered acceptable and sensitive for this purpose.  
The equivalence margins of pCR have been discussed in several scientific advice procedures, and clinical 
and statistical justification has been warranted. The margins applied in EGC002 are comparable to, or 
even narrower than, equivalence margins in previous approved biosimilars, [i.e., up to (-0.15, 0.15)]. 
The  equivalence  margins  are  considered  acceptable.  Further  discussion  of  the  efficacy  results  is  not 
decisive in a study of biosimilarity, and no further data are requested. 
The EGC002 trial has demonstrated that the risk difference of pCR at the time of surgery was within its 
predefined margins of ±13%. However, in the progesterone receptor positive responders, the result did 
not support similarity since the estimated risk difference was outside the lower bound of the pre-defined 
equivalence margins (data not shown). 
Secondary  efficacy  endpoints  related  to  resected  specimen  (pathological  complete  response  without 
ductal  carcinoma  in  situ  and  pathological  complete  response  as  absence  of  invasive  cancer  in  breast 
tissue only) had comparable findings in FAS-neo and PPS-neo analysis sets. The 95% CIs contained 0 
and fell within the pre-defined equivalence margins (-0.13, 0.13). Overall, results of secondary surgery-
related  endpoints  of  the  study,  sensitivity  analyses  and  most  of  the  sub-group  analyses  reflect  the 
primary  endpoint  and  are  also  supporting  therapeutic  similarity  (see  Table  23).  As  anticipated  after 
surgical  and  medical  treatment,  the  overall  survival  is  expected  to  be  high  and  hence  not  ideal  to 
distinguish absence of therapeutical similarity relatively early after treatment. Maturity of EFS and OS 
are <8% and <2%, respectively. No indications of any detrimental effects are seen in the study arms. 
2.6.7.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The efficacy study met its primary endpoint with the 95% CI of the treatment difference contained within 
the  equivalence  margins.  Overall,  secondary  endpoints  also  supported  the  outcome  of  therapeutic 
equivalence of EG12014 to Herceptin in both a neoadjuvant and an adjuvant setting. In the subgroup 
analysis  there  are  some  opposing  results,  with  uncertain  meaning.  Equivalence  is  not  unambiguously 
supported in some subgroups, but for these, sample sizes are relatively small and hence it is difficult to 
conclude  on  its  statistical  or  clinical  relevance  (Table  23).  This  is  the  case  for  subjects  with  positive 
progesterone receptor, oestrogen receptor negative subjects and subjects with breast cancer stage IIIa. 
Event-free and overall survival are, as expected, highly immature. Apart from these inconsistencies, that 
may be anticipated and unremarkable, the submitted efficacy data support therapeutic similarity. 
The  robustness  of  the  results  is  determined  by  the  primary  endpoint  of  the  study,  pCR,  which  is 
frequently applied in studies of early breast cancer, even if pCR has obvious limitations. Pragmatically 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 65/99 
 
  
 
 
speaking, pCR is believed to be a sensitive endpoint and considered appropriate for demonstration of 
biosimilarity of trastuzumab in HER2 positive early breast cancer. Overall, biosimilarity between EG12014 
and reference product is supported by clinical efficacy data. 
2.6.8.  Clinical safety 
2.6.8.1.  Patient exposure 
Phase 1 Study EGC001 
In the completed PK-study EGC001, the safety set included 84 enrolled healthy male subjects which 
received a single dose of trastuzumab (6 mg/kg as IV infusion). Twenty-eight (28) of the 84 subjects 
received EG12014, 28/84 of subjects received EU Herceptin and 28/84 subjects received US Herceptin. 
Two (2) subjects discontinued prematurely from the study due to severe adverse events (SAEs)/adverse 
events (AEs), one subject who received EU Herceptin and one subject who received US Herceptin. 
Phase 3 Study EGC002 
EGC002 is a study where HER2-positive EBC patients (n=807) were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive 
trastuzumab (EG12014 or EU Herceptin with a loading dose of 8 mg/kg followed by a maintenance dose 
of 6 mg/kg) for four cycles every three weeks (12 weeks in total) in the neoadjuvant study part, prior 
to  surgery.  Following  surgery,  the  patients  received  trastuzumab  (with  a  loading  dose  of  8  mg/kg 
followed  by  a  maintenance  dose  of  6  mg/kg)  every  3  weeks  to  complete  12  months  of  overall 
trastuzumab  treatment.  Patients  treated  neoadjuvantly  with  EG12014,  continued  treatment  with 
EG12014 in the adjuvant setting; patients treated neoadjuvantly with EU Herceptin, were randomized in 
a  1:1  ratio  to  either  continue  treatment  with  EU  Herceptin  or  to  switch  to  EG12014  treatment  in  the 
adjuvant setting. The overall trastuzumab treatment duration did not exceed 12 months. 
Patients received four 3-weekly cycles anthracycline (AC)-based chemotherapy (90 mg/m2 epirubicin; 
600 mg/m2 cyclophosphamide; given as separate IV infusions) before start of the trastuzumab therapy.  
Trastuzumab (EG12014 or EU Herceptin) was administered in combination with paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 
IV infusion) in the neoadjuvant study part, and as single treatment in the adjuvant study part. 
The safety sets for the neoadjuvant part (SAF-neo) comprised all patients who received at least one dose 
of  study  treatment  in  the  neoadjuvant  part.  The  safety  set  for  the  entire  study  (SAF)  comprised  all 
patients  who  received  at  least  one  dose  of  study  treatment.  Safety  analyses  were  performed  for  the 
neoadjuvant part (SAF-neo) according to the actual study drug received (EG12014, Herceptin, or ‘None’) 
and  were  performed  for  the  adjuvant  part  and  entire  study  (SAF)  according to  the  actual  study  drug 
received (EG12014, Herceptin/EG12014, Herceptin, or “None”). 
For the neoadjuvant part, a total of 807 female patients were enrolled; 805 (99.8%) patients received 
chemotherapy at neoadjuvant cycle 1 visit, 797 (98.8%) patients received study drug (EG12014 or EU 
Herceptin) at neoadjuvant cycle 5 visit, and 779 (96.5%) patients, evenly distributed in both groups, 
underwent  surgery.  For  the  adjuvant  part,  safety  data  have  been  analysed  for  762  (94.4%)  patients 
(386 in the EG12014 arm, 188 in the EU Herceptin/EG12014 arm, and 188 in the EU Herceptin arm) 
who were randomized and received study treatment at adjuvant cycle 1 visit, 754 (93.4%) patients have 
received study treatment at adjuvant cycle 5 visit, 736 (91.2%) patients at adjuvant cycle 9 visit, and 
713 (88.4%) patients at adjuvant cycle 13 visit. 
A total of 711 (88.1%) patients have completed the follow-up period (20 weeks after final dose of study 
drug) of whom 681 (84.4%) completed the study (completed the EoS visit).

When  all  data  from  the  Neoadjuvant  Part  and  the  Adjuvant  Part  were  transferred  to  the  CRO  and  all 
related  data  queries  had  been  resolved,  the  study  was  unblinded.  All  data  as  of  the  final  DBL  on 
18 February 2022 were analysed and reported in the final CSR (Part 1+ Part 2). 
Exposure to trastuzumab 
The  exposure  to  study  drug  (EG12014  or  EU  Herceptin)  during  the  neoadjuvant  part  is  presented  in 
Table 24.

Exposure to Epirubicin, Cyclophosphamide and Paclitaxel 
According to the applicant, the total mean (SD) dose of epirubicin and cyclophosphamide, administered 
at cycles 1 to 4 (neo adjuvant part) was consistent for all 4 cycles and was comparable for the EG12014 
and  EU  Herceptin  treatment  arms.  The  applicant  also  states  that  delay  in  administration  and  dose 
adjustment  of  epirubicin  and  cyclophosphamide  was  comparable  for  the  EG12014  and  EU  Herceptin 
arms. 
The  applicant  also  states  that  the  total  mean  (SD)  dose  of  paclitaxel  administered  at  cycles  5  to  8 
(neoadjuvant part) was consistent for all 4 cycles and was comparable for the EG12014 and EU Herceptin 
treatment arms. According to the applicant, delay in administration and dose adjustment of paclitaxel 
were comparable for the EG12014 and EU Herceptin arms. 
Disposition of Subjects 
A total of 807 patients were enrolled in the study and randomized into the neoadjuvant part, 405 in the 
EG12014  arm  and  402  in  the  EU  Herceptin  arm  (FAS-neo).  For  the  entire  study,  405  patients  were 
included in the EG12014 arm, 188 patients in Herceptin/EG12014 arm (switch arm), and 214 patients 
in the Herceptin arm (FAS). 
Study treatment was discontinued for 19 (4.7%) EG12014 patients and 26 (6.5%) EU Herceptin patients 
during the neoadjuvant part. During the entire study, withdrawal from the study was reported for 60 
(14.8%) EG12014 patients, 20 (10.6%) EU Herceptin/EG12014 patients, and 46 (21.5%) EU Herceptin 
patients. 
2.6.8.2.  Adverse events 
The AEs recorded were coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 
20.0 in study EGC001, and the MedDRA version 23.0 in study EGC002. 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 68/99 
 
  
 
 
 
The AEs in both studies are assessed by severity grade (mild, moderate, severe in study EGC001 and 
severity grade 1-5 in EGC002). The probability of AEs being caused by study treatment was assessed 
by the investigator, using a five-level causality scale. 
Adverse events of special interest (AESI) were defined in study EGC002, and include cardiac dysfunction, 
embryo-foetal toxicity, infusion reactions, allergic-like reactions, hypersensitivity, haematotoxicity, and 
pulmonary events. The AESIs were identified considering the warnings and precautions and undesirable 
effects of Herceptin (EU Herceptin SmPC, 2021, US Herceptin Prescribing Information, 2021).

3.3.7.3.2  Serious Adverse Events 
Phase 1 Study EGC001 
No serious adverse event (SAE) was reported in the EG12014 or US Herceptin treatment group in study 
EGC001.  One  SAE  was  reported  in  a  subject  in  the  EU  Herceptin  treatment  group,  gastrointestinal 
bacterial infection (PT) requiring a 4-day hospitalization, which was assessed by the investigator to be 
of moderate intensity and to be unlikely related to EU Herceptin.  
Phase 3 Study EGC002 
In study EGC002, a total of 54 SAEs (listed in Table 36)  occurred in 48 patients during the neoadjuvant 
part (28 SAEs occurred in 25 patients [6.3%] in the EG12014 arm and 26 SAEs occurred in 23 patients 
[5.8%] in the EU Herceptin group [SAF-neo]). Each PT was reported in ≤ 4 [1.0%] patients for all study 
treatment arms.

The most frequently reported (>2 patients in any treatment arm) serious TEAEs were related to COVID-
19 infection, including COVID-19 (3 [0.8%] EG12014 patients and 1 [0.3%] EU Herceptin patients) and 
COVID-19 pneumonia (4 [1.0%] and 1 [0.3%], respectively). According to the applicant, none of the 
SAEs reported in the neoadjuvant part of the study were considered as related to trastuzumab.  
During the adjuvant part, a total of 93 SAEs occurred in 90 patients (46 SAEs occurred in 44 patients 
[11.4%] in the EG12014 arm, 21 SAEs occurred in 20 patients [10.6%] in the EU Herceptin/EG12014 
arm, and 26 SAEs in 26 patients [13.8%] in EU Herceptin arm (

SAEs  were  related  to  COVID  19  including    asymptomatic  COVID-19  (4  [1.0%]  EG12014  patients,  6 
[3.2%] EU Herceptin/EG12014 patients, and 4 [2.1%] EU Herceptin patients), COVID-19 (16 [4.1%], 4 
[2.1%], and 9 [4.8%], respectively), and COVID-19 pneumonia (15 [3.9%], 2 [1.1%], and 7 [3.7%], 
respectively).

2.6.8.4.  Laboratory findings 
Phase 1 Study EGC001 
Haematology/Urinanalysis 
According  to  the  applicant,  there  were  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  (entry  visit)  in 
haematological or urinalysis parameters in the EG12014, US Herceptin or EU Herceptin treatment group. 
Clinical Chemistry 
According  to  the  applicant,  there  were  no  clinically  meaningful  changes  from  baseline  (entry  visit)  in 
clinical chemistry parameters in the EG12014, EU Herceptin or US Herceptin treatment group except for 
one  subject  in  the  EU  Herceptin  treatment  group  who  experienced  a  clinically  significant  increase  in 
hepatic enzymes which was reported as secondary AE to the SAE gastrointestinal bacterial infection in 
this subject. The investigator suspected that the intake of food supplements and other drugs caused the 
increase in liver enzymes and assessed the AE (PT hepatic enzyme increased) as unlikely related to EU 
Herceptin. 
Phase 3 Study EGC002 
Haematology 
For  both  the neoadjuvant and  adjuvant  part,  according  to  the applicant,  the majority  of  patients had 
normal  haematology  values  for  all  parameters  at  all  timepoints  and  the  percentage  of  patients  with 
normal or abnormal (clinically significant or non-clinically significant (CS or NCS)) values was comparable 
for the EG12014 and EU Herceptin arms for all parameters at all timepoints. The parameters with the 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 84/99 
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
highest  percentage  of  patients  who  had  abnormal-CS  values  were,  according  to  the  applicant, 
haemoglobin and neutrophils.  
The majority of participants in the EG12014 and Herceptin arms had worst grade values that remained 
at a Grade 0 or shifted from Grade 0 to Grade 1 after Cycle 1. The parameter with the highest percentage 
of  participants  with  shifts  to  a  worst  grade  of  ≥  Grade  2  was  lymphocyte  count  decreased  for  both 
treatment arms. A shift from Grade 0 to a worst grade of Grade 4 was reported for lymphocyte count 
decreased (3 participants), neutrophil count decreased (1 participant), and platelet count decreased (1 
participant) in the EG12014 arm. 
Serum chemistry 
For  the  neoadjuvant  part,  according  to  the  applicant,  the  majority  of  patients  had  normal  serum 
chemistry  values  for  all  parameters  at  all  timepoints,  and  the  percentage  of  patients  with  normal  or 
abnormal (CS or NCS) values was comparable for the EG12014 and Herceptin arms for all parameters 
at  all  timepoints.  For  ALT,  the  percentage  of  patients  in  the  EG12014  and  EU  Herceptin  arms  with 
abnormal-CS values increased from baseline (0.3% and 0.3%, respectively) to cycle 8 (8.8% and 8.4%, 
respectively);  and  then  decreased  by  pre-surgery  (7.6%  and  7.2%,  respectively)  and  post-surgery 
(4.8% and 4.1%, respectively). For AST, the percentage of patients in the EG12014 and EU Herceptin 
arms with abnormal-CS values increased from baseline (0% and 0.3%, respectively) to cycle 7 (4.5% 
and  4.8%,  respectively);  and  then  decreased  by  cycle  8  (3.5%  and  4.6%,  respectively),  pre-surgery 
(2.8% and 2.8%, respectively) and post-surgery (2.4% and 1.6%, respectively).  
Shift  results  were  summarized  in  the  CSR  for  serum  chemistry  parameters  by  timepoint  for  the 
neoadjuvant  part.  For  all  the  parameters,  the  majority  of  participants  in  the  EG12014  and  Herceptin 
arms had worst grade values that remained at a Grade 0 or shifted from Grade 0 to Grade 1 after Cycle 
1. The parameters with the highest percentage of participants with shifts to a worst grade of ≥Grade 2 
were ALT increased, cholesterol high, GGT increased, hyperkalaemia, and hypertriglyceridemia for both 
treatment arms.  
For the adjuvant part, the majority of patients had normal serum chemistry values for all parameters at 
all timepoints. In addition, the percentage of patients with normal or abnormal (CS or NCS) values was 
comparable for the EG12014, EU Herceptin/EG12014, and EU Herceptin arms for all parameters at all 
timepoints. The parameters with the highest percentage of patients with abnormal-CS values were the 
same as parameters observed during the neoadjuvant part, i.e., ALT, AST, cholesterol, and GGT. 
Urinalysis 
For  both  the neoadjuvant and  adjuvant  part,  according  to  the applicant,  the majority  of  patients had 
normal urinalysis values for all parameters at all timepoints and the percentage of patients with normal 
or abnormal values was comparable for the study drug arms for all parameters at all timepoints.

2.6.8.7.  Immunological events 
Immunogenicity has been assessed as a secondary objective in study EGC001 in healthy volunteers and 
in study EGC002 in patients with HER2-positive EBC. The immunogenicity endpoints included incidence 
of ADAs and NAbs against trastuzumab. PK (peak and trough concentrations) and ADA were sampled as 
shown in Table 5 and Table 40. 
Screening,  confirmatory  and  characterisation  assays  were  used  to  evaluate  the  immunogenicity  of 
trastuzumab. Samples with signals above the screening cut point was considered positive and further 
analysed with the confirmatory assay.  Confirmed positive ADA samples were further characterised by 
performing  serial  dilutions  to  determine  the  titre,  specificity  was  tested,  and  neutralising  activity  was 
analysed by a NAb screening assay. 
In study EGC001 (healthy individuals) the contract laboratory IPM GmbH conducted and validated the 
ECLA assay for ADA analysis, whereas in study EGC002 (HER-2 positive EBC patients) the ECLA assay 
was  conducted  and  validated  by  ICON  Laboratory  Services.  However,  due  to  an  unexpectedly  high 
number  of  invalid  assay  runs  observed  during  study  sample  analysis  and  failed  incurred  sample 
reanalysis, data for the determination of trastuzumab used for PK-profiling were implausible and could 
not  be  used  as  final  results.  EirGenix  therefore  decided  to  transfer  the  PK  sample  analysis  to  ICON 
Laboratory  Services.  The  latter  developed  and  fully  validated  an  independent  PK  method.  Using  this 
method for analysis, all runs fulfilled run acceptance criteria and ISR passed as well for 97.1% of samples 
in study EGC001.  
In study EGC001 and using the ADA assay developed at IPM Biotech GmbH, the incidence of baseline 
ADAs was 3.6% (1/28 subjects), 7.1% (2/28 subjects) and 3.6% (1/28 subjects) in the EG12014, US 
Herceptin and EU Herceptin treatment groups, respectively (Table 39). None of the subjects with ADA-
negative results at baseline (95.2%) developed ADAs 1680 hours post-infusion, and no neutralising ADAs 
(NAb) were reported. Only baseline and samples at 1680h, unless positive, were analysed. 
Following reanalysis of all available 415 samples from 84 subjects using the same ADA assay as for study 
EGC002  (Table  40),  six  patients  had  ADAs  pre-trastuzumab.  Of  four  patients  who  were  post-dose 
positive, two patients developed “de novo” (i.e. treatment-emergent ADAs in patients who were negative 
at baseline) ADAs post-trastuzumab (EG12014:1, EU Herceptin: 1). Samples were not tested for NAbs.

In the neoadjuvant part of study EG002, the incidence of baseline ADAs was 5.8% (N=23) and 4.0% 
(N=16)  in  the  EG12014  and  EU  Herceptin  arm,  respectively  (Table  41).  Of  these,  36/39  participants 
were  ADA  negative  after  the  first  administration  of  trastuzumab  during  the  neoadjuvant  part.  Three 
participants (all in the EG12014 arm) showed one positive ADA result each also after the first study drug 
administration.  Following  trastuzumab  administration,  four  versus  seven  patients  with  ADA-negative 
results at baseline tested positive in the EG12014 and EU Herceptin arm, respectively (Table 42). Only 
one  patient  with  neutralising  activity  (study  EGC002,  pre-trastuzumab  administration  i.e.  baseline 
neoadjuvant C1D1, EG12014 arm) was reported.

Table 44. Incidence of de novo Anti-Drug Antibodies after the first study drug administration 
(SAF) – Adjuvant Part and End of Treatment (EGC002 study report, table 12-42). 
No  systematic  differences  in  pharmacokinetics  were  apparent  for  subjects  developing  ADAs  following 
trastuzumab  administration  in  study  EGC001  and  EGC002  (data  not  shown),  and,  according  to  the 
applicant, a lack of efficacy due to antibody formation is not likely. 
Overall, for the neoadjuvant part, the incidence of TEAEs in study EGC002 was similar in patients who 
were ADA negative or ADA positive, indicating that ADAs do not have any influence on the safety profile. 
The four ADA positive participants in the EG12014 arm reported 32 TEAEs and the seven ADA positive 
participants in the Herceptin arm reported 41 TEAEs. Among participants who were ADA positive after 
the first study drug administration, no TEAEs of infusion reaction were reported. 
Among  patients  who  were  de  novo  ADA  positive  after  the  first  study  drug  administration  during  the 
adjuvant part, 3 of 4 (75.0%) patients in the EG12014 arm reported 6 TEAEs (leukopenia, neutropenia, 
vision  blurred,  metastases  to  central  nervous  system,  headache,  and  pulmonary  embolism),  1  of  3 
(33.3%) patients in the Herceptin/EG12014 arm reported 4 TEAEs (lymphopenia, asthenia, COVID-19 
pneumonia, and respiratory distress), and 1 of 3 (33.3%) patients in the Herceptin arm reported 1 TEAE 
(weight increased). 
During the entire study, de novo positive ADA result after the first study drug administration was reported 
for a total of 28 of 805 (3.5%) patients (13 of 394 [3.3%] patients in the EG12014 arm, 5 of 185 [2.7%] 
patients in the Herceptin/EG12014 arm, and 10 of 210 [4.8%] patients in the Herceptin arm).  
The majority of TEAEs reported in the three treatment arms during the entire study occurred in patients 
who were ADA negative, 3389 of 3428 (98.9%) total TEAEs in the EG12014 arm, 1731 of 1755 (98.6%) 
total TEAEs in the EU Herceptin/EG12014 arm, and 1712 of 1736 (98.6%) total TEAEs in the EU Herceptin 
arm. The most frequently reported TEAE among ADA negative patients was alopecia (89.2% of EG12014 
patients, 85.7% of EU Herceptin/EG12014 patients, and 84.2% of EU Herceptin patients). The next most 
frequently reported TEAE was nausea (35.4%, 33.0%, and 33.7%, respectively).

2.6.8.9.  Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Phase 1 Study EGC001 
Adverse events leading to study discontinuation 
One  SAE  was  reported  in  a  subject  in  the  EU  Herceptin  treatment  group;  the  subject  had  a 
gastrointestinal  bacterial  infection  (PT)  requiring  a  4-day  hospitalization,  which  was  assessed  by  the 
investigator to be of moderate intensity and to be unlikely related to EU Herceptin (onset: 36 days after 
administration of study medication). The SAE was initially documented as gastroenteritis acuta, with a 
further specification of the diagnosis to gastrointestinal bacterial infection applied in the follow-up report. 
The subject was treated for the SAE and the outcome of the event was reported as recovered/resolved. 
The subject discontinued the study as exclusion/withdrawal criteria applied. 
Phase 3 Study EGC002 
Adverse events leading to study discontinuation 
During the neoadjuvant part, 3 patients in the EG12014 arm were discontinued from the study due to 
anaemia (1 event), ejection fraction decreased (1 event), and metastases to meninges (1 event) and 
three (3) patients in the EU Herceptin arm were discontinued from the study due to cardiac failure chronic 
(1 event), acute hepatitis B (1 event), and ejection fraction decreased (1 event). 
During the adjuvant part, 7 patients in the EG12014 arm were discontinued from the study, 1 patient 
was discontinued due to myocardial infarction (1 event) and COVID-19 pneumonia (1 event), and 6 other 
patients were discontinued due to systolic dysfunction (1 event), acute hepatitis B (1 event), and ejection 
fraction  decreased  (4  events,  1  patient  each).  Four  (4)  patients  in  the  EU  Herceptin/EG12014  arm 
discontinued from the study due to cardiac failure (1 event), ventricular dysfunction (1 event), infusion-
related  reaction  (1  event),  and  ejection  fraction  decreased  (1  event).  Four  (4)  patients  in  the  EU 
Herceptin  arm  were  discontinued  from the  study  due  to left  ventricular  failure  (1  event)  and ejection 
fraction decreased (3 events). 
Overall, 20 (2.5%) patients had 21 TEAEs leading to study discontinuation during the entire study. 
Adverse Events Leading to Trastuzumab Withdrawal 
In the neoadjuvant part, TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal were reported for 6 (1.5%) EG12014 
patients (6 events) and 11 (2.8%) EU Herceptin patients (12 events). Metastases to bone was reported 
in  3  (0.8%)  EU  Herceptin  patients;  and  metastases  to  the  lung  was  reported  in  2  (0.5%)  EG12014 
patients. No other TEAE was reported in > 1 participant in either study drug arm. 
In  the  adjuvant  part,  TEAEs  leading  to  study  drug withdrawal  were  reported  for  20  (5.2%)  EG12014 
patients (20 events), 5 (2.7%) EU Herceptin/EG12014 patients (5 events), and 9 (4.8%) EU Herceptin 
patients (10 events). Metastases to central nervous system was reported in 5 (1.3%) EG12014 patients, 
and  1  (0.5%)  EU  Herceptin  patient;  ejection  fraction  decreased  was  reported  in  4  (1.0%)  EG12014 
patients, 1 (0.5%) EU Herceptin/EG12014 patients, and 3 (1.6%) EU Herceptin patients; and metastases 
to  the  liver  was  reported  in  3  (0.8%)  EG12014  patients,  and  2  (1.1%)  EU  Herceptin  patients;  and 
metastases to lymph nodes was reported in 2 (0.5%) EG12014 patients. No other TEAE was reported in 
> 1 patient in any study drug arm. 
2.6.8.10.  Post marketing experience 
EG12014 is currently not marketed in any country worldwide and therefore, no post-marketing data are 
available. 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 89/99 
 
  
 
 
2.6.9.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Comparative safety data of EG12014 was derived from two clinical studies: 
•  EGC001 – A randomised, phase 1, double-blind, single-dose study to compare pharmacokinetic 
characteristics and safety of EG12014 with those of EU-Herceptin and US-Herceptin, in 84 healthy 
male subjects. 
•  EGC002 – A randomised, phase 3, multicenter, double-blind study in female HER2-positive early 
breast cancer (EBC) patients (n=807) with the primary objective to demonstrate therapeutic 
equivalence between EG12014 and EU Herceptin in terms of efficacy and to compare the safety, 
immunogenicity, and PK between the trastuzumab products. 
Throughout the assessment, emphasis has been put on the EGC002 study (final database lock date on 
18 February 2022).  
Overall, the size of the safety database is considered appropriate to evaluate the general safety profile 
of EG12014. However, it does not allow for characterisation and evaluation of rare events. In addition, 
a switch study design was chosen although it was not supported by the scientific advice, as it may 
confound the size of the database necessary for comparison of long-term safety.  
In study EGC001 (healthy male volunteers), Herwenda, EU-approved Herceptin, and US-licensed 
Herceptin were well tolerated. The overall safety profile, as reflected by the most frequently reported 
AEs, seems overall comparable in all treatment arms. However, the interpretation of these results 
should be cautious due to the very limited number of subjects (n=28 in each arm). A total of 86 TEAEs 
were reported: 25 TEAEs in 19/28 (67.9%) of subjects in the EG12014 treatment group, 42 TEAEs 
were reported in 17/28 (60.7%) of subjects in the US Herceptin treatment group and 19 TEAEs were 
reported in 13/28 (46.4%) of subjects in the EU Herceptin treatment group. One (1) SAE was reported 
in the EU Herceptin treatment group (assessed as unlikely related to study treatment). 
In study EGC002, neoadjuvant part, the overall incidence of TEAEs was comparable between the 
EG12014 and Herceptin treatment arms, 99.2% vs 98.5%. The severity of TEAEs was similar between 
the EG12014 and Herceptin arms; Grade 1 (75.4% vs 75.1%), Grade 2 (84.2% vs 84.2%), Grade 3 or 
4 (30.6% vs 25.9%) respectively. The number of patients reporting TEAEs related to chemotherapy 
(98.7% vs 96.5%) and to trastuzumab (22.3% and 23.6%) were comparable between the EG12014 
and the Herceptin arm respectively, and so was the proportion of TEAEs reported as related to 
trastuzumab (229/2777 vs 240/2778).  
In the adjuvant part, the overall incidence, severity, and causality of TEAEs were comparable for the 
three study drug arms. The severity of TEAEs for EG12014 and Herceptin were; Grade 1 (44.6% vs 
45.2%), Grade 2 (31.1% vs 39.9%), Grade 3 or 4 (8.3% vs 9.0%) respectively. The incidence of 
TEAEs reported as related to trastuzumab was 18.9% vs 24.5% vs 21.8% for EG12014, 
Herceptin/EG12014 and Herceptin respectively. 
The overall incidence of TEAEs by PT and SOC in the neoadjuvant part was comparable for EG12014 
and Herceptin. The most frequently observed TEAEs by PT were alopecia (88.2% vs 84.7%, nausea 
(34.8% vs 33.4%), asthenia (22.6% vs 26.1%), neutropenia (22.3% vs 20.6%), anaemia (17.3% vs 
16.1%, alanine aminotransferase (ALT) increased (16.3% vs 14.1%) and arthralgia (13.3% vs 
15.8%), for EG12014 and Herceptin respectively, and the severity of these TEAEs was similar between 
the treatment arms. In addition, the frequency of the most frequent treatment-related adverse events 
was similar between EG12014 and Herceptin. TEAEs reported for the adjuvant part, in ≥ 5% of 
patients in any study drug arm (by PT), were leukopenia, neutropenia, asthenia, ALT increased, 
ejection fraction decreased and weight increased. 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 90/99 
 
  
 
 
During the neoadjuvant part, the incidence of AESIs was comparable for the EG12014 arm (27 (6.8%) 
patients (40 events)) and Herceptin arm (38 (9.5%) patients (53 events)). Cardiac disorders were 
reported for 1 patient (0.3%, 1 event) in the EG12014 arm and 5 patients (1,3%, 5 events) in the EU 
Herceptin arm. Infusion related reactions were reported in 1 patient (0.3%) in the EG12014 arm, while 
it was reported in 4 patients (1%) in the EU Herceptin arm. The incidence of ejection fraction 
decreased was numerically slightly lower in the EG12014 (3 patients, 0.8%) vs the EU Herceptin arm 
(6 patients, 1.5%) although it is of note that the numbers are very small. 
AESIs occurring during the adjuvant part were reported in 26 (6.7%) EG12014 patients (34 events), 
20 (10.6%) EU Herceptin/EG12014 patients (31 events), and 20 (10.6%) EU Herceptin patients (27 
events) and were thus comparable between the treatment arms. As reported for the neoadjuvant part, 
the incidence of ejection fraction decreased in the adjuvant part was numerically slightly lower in the 
EG12014 (7 patients, 1.8%) vs the EU Herceptin arm (12 patients, 6.4%) although again, the numbers 
are very small.  
The incidence of AESIs Grade 3 or higher (provided in the D120 response) was low; <2% in all 
treatment arms for both the neoadjuvant and the adjuvant part.  
A total of nine deaths were reported as of the iDBL, evenly distributed in the treatment arms and 
according to the investigator, seven of them were considered as “not related” to trastuzumab 
treatment by the investigator, while two of the deaths (myocardial infarction and cerebrovascular 
accident) were considered “unlikely related” to trastuzumab.  Four (4) of the deaths (myocardial 
infarction, cerebrovascular accident, hepatic failure (due to disease progression) and metastases to 
meninges) occurred during the neoadjuvant part (3/4 were in the EU Herceptin arm). Five (5) of the 
deaths occurred during the adjuvant part, 3 of which were in the EG12014 arm (metastases to central 
nervous system (2 patients) and pulmonary embolism), and 2 of which were in the EU Herceptin arm 
(metastases to peritoneum and “breast cancer metastatic”). Severe pulmonary events have been 
reported with the use of trastuzumab in the post-marketing setting, as stated in the SmPC. However, 
in the patient narratives, this event of pulmonary embolism was only stated as assessed not to be 
related to trastuzumab treatment.  
Overall, a total of 54 SAEs occurred in 48 patients during the neoadjuvant part (28 SAEs occurred in 
25 patients (6.3%) in the EG12014 arm and 26 SAEs occurred in 23 patients (5.8%) in the EU 
Herceptin group. The incidence of SAEs was thus comparable for the treatment arms, and none of the 
events were considered as related to trastuzumab treatment by the investigator.  
The incidence of SAEs that occurred during the adjuvant part was comparable for the treatment arms. 
A total of 93 SAEs occurred in 90 patients (46 SAEs occurred in 44 patients [11.4%] in the EG12014 
arm, 21 SAEs occurred in 20 patients [10.6%] in the EU Herceptin/EG12014 arm, and 26 SAEs in 26 
patients [13.8%] in EU Herceptin arm. Five (5) events were considered related to trastuzumab 
(EG12014 or EU Herceptin) treatment. Three of these events were in the SOC Cardiac disorders 
(myocardial infarction, cardiac failure, and angina unstable). All of the five SAEs occurred relatively 
late, between study day 311-472, reinforcing the importance of having the complete safety data for 
the final assessment of the SAEs in the adjuvant part. 
For EGC002, overall, 20 (2.5%) patients had 21 TEAEs leading to study discontinuation during the 
entire study and the distribution was comparable for the treatment arms. 
TEAEs leading to trastuzumab withdrawal during the neoadjuvant part was slightly numerically lower in 
the EGC014 arm (6 patients, 1.5%) compared to the EU Herceptin arm (11 patients, 2.8%). However, 
the numbers are very small and in the adjuvant part, TEAEs leading to study drug withdrawal reported 
were similar between EGC014 (20 patients, 5.2%) and EU Herceptin (9 patients, 4.8%).  
Immunogenicity 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 91/99 
 
  
 
 
Regarding  immunogenicity,  the  analytical  methods  are  adequately  described,  and  their  validations 
presented.  In  general,  the  methods  have  been  acceptably  validated.  The  applied  biosimilar  EG12014 
appears to have a low immunogenicity potential. Overall, the incidence of treatment emergent ADAs for 
EG12014  was  relatively  low  (~3.3%)  and  comparable  to  Herceptin  in  EBC  patients  irrespective  of 
concomitant chemotherapy. No treatment-emergent NAbs were observed in baseline-negative patients 
with  post-dose  ADAs  in  study  EGC002.  NAbs  were  not  tested  in  the  pivotal  PK  study  EGC001.  The 
clinical relevance of ADAs is not known; there is no apparent impact on PK, efficacy and safety, however 
data are limited. 
2.6.10.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Overall, the data submitted appears to support biosimilarity between EG12014 and Herceptin.

additional monitoring list as it is a biological product authorised after 1 January 2011.  
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Biosimilarity assessment 
3.1.  Comparability exercise and indications claimed 
Herwenda  is  being  developed  as  a  biosimilar  to  the  reference  product  Herceptin.  The  administration, 
posology, and indications are according to the reference product, as described in the Herceptin SmPC. 
Trastuzumab  is  a  recombinant  humanised  IgG1  monoclonal  antibody  against  the  human  epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).  
Herwenda is claimed for the following indications:  
• 
treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer 
o  Monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two chemotherapy 
regimens for their metastatic disease.  
o 
o 
In  combination  with  paclitaxel  or  docetaxel  for  the  treatment  of  those  patients  who  have  not 
received chemotherapy for their metastatic disease.  
In combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with 
hormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. 
treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer following surgery, chemotherapy 
(neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable). 
In combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin for the treatment of adult patients 
with HER2-positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-oesophageal junction who 
• 
• 
have not received prior anticancer treatment. 
Summary of analytical comparability (quality data)  
The applicant has performed extensive testing of EG12014 batches and EU Herceptin batches.  
Similarity between EG12014 and EU-approved Herceptin is addressed using a wide range of analytical 
exercises covering physiochemical and biological properties, as well as a forced degradation study. 
Most of the quality attributes proved to be highly similar. The main differences between EG12014 and 
Herceptin include level of aggregates, oxidation, free thiols and basic variants, however, these 
differences do not have a significant impact on biological activities and potency assays. 
Summary of non-clinical data 
The EG12014 non-clinical programme consists of one pharmacodynamic xenograft mouse model study 
and a PK study in mice. 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 94/99 
 
  
 
 
As indicated in EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010, a stepwise approach should be applied when 
evaluating non-clinical biosimilarity. Step 1 comprises a number of comparative in vitro studies.  
Summary of clinical comparability data 
The  clinical  program  comprised  a  pivotal  phase  1  pharmacokinetic  (PK)  similarity  study  (EGC001)  in 
healthy males, and a phase 3 efficacy and safety study (EGC002) in female HER-2 positive EBC patients. 
Immunogenicity (incidence of ADAs and NAbs against trastuzumab) has been assessed as a secondary 
objective in both studies. Population pharmacokinetic (popPK) modelling of EG12014 and Herceptin in 
patients with HER2+ EBC is submitted as supportive PK information. 
Study EGC001 was a double blind, randomised, parallel-group, single-dose (90 minutes IV infusion of 6 
mg/kg  trastuzumab),  three-arm,  two-stage  study  in  healthy  male  subjects.  The  primary  PK  endpoint 
was AUC0-inf of trastuzumab, and additional endpoints were Cmax, AUC0-t, AUCres, t1/2, Tmax, Vz, λz, and 
CL. 
The clinical efficacy and safety development program to demonstrate equivalence between EG12014 and 
the  reference  product  EU-Herceptin  consists  of  a  randomised,  double-blind  study  (EGC002)  in  807  
female  HER2-positive  early  breast  cancer  (EBC)  patients  (405  and  402  patients  in  EG12014  and 
Herceptin arms, respectively). 
The primary efficacy endpoint was pathological complete response (pCR) at time of surgery after the 
neoadjuvant treatment with four cycles of Anthracycline-based chemotherapy followed by four cycles 
with paclitaxel and trastuzumab. The pCR was defined as the absence of residual invasive cancer of the 
complete resected breast specimen and all sampled sentinel and/or axillary lymph nodes as assessed 
by central laboratory. Secondary endpoints included other histological definitions of pCR, overall 
response rate (ORR), event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS). Up to ten blood samples per 
patient were collected: before start of trastuzumab therapy, pre-infusion in the trastuzumab 
neoadjuvant part, pre-surgery, pre-infusion at beginning of and during adjuvant therapy and three 
weeks after the end of study. 
3.2.  Results supporting biosimilarity 
Quality data 
Most  of  the  quality  attributes  proved  to  be  highly  similar.  For  attributes  which  fail  the  predefined 
biosimilarity acceptance criteria, justifications are provided. These deviations were mostly regarded as 
unlikely to have an impact on safety and/or efficacy, and as the results from the orthogonal assays were 
within quality range, similarity can be supported.  
Importantly, for the biological function parameters of EG12014 none of the deviations were considered 
to preclude biosimilarity. 
EG12014 can thus be considered as a biosimilar to EU-Herceptin from a quality perspective. 
Non-clinical data 
As indicated in EMA/CHMP/BMWP/403543/2010, a stepwise approach should be applied when evaluating 
non-clinical  biosimilarity.  Step  1  comprises  a  number  of  comparative  in  vitro  studies  considered 
paramount  for  non-clinical  similarity  assessment.  Similarity  between  EG12014  and  EU  Herceptin  has 
been  addressed  in  a  biosimilarity  exercise  covering  physiochemical  and  biological  properties,  and 
EG12014 can thus be considered as a biosimilar to EU-Herceptin from a non-clinical perspective. 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 95/99 
 
  
 
 
Clinical data 
Pharmacokinetics 
In  the  pivotal  phase  I  PK  study  EGC001  in  healthy  volunteers  the  AUC0-inf  point  estimate  (GMR)  for 
EG12014 versus EU Herceptin was 89.81 (94.12 %CI: 82.11, 98.23). PK data obtained as secondary 
endpoints  in  the  phase  1  (EGC001)  and  phase  3  study  EGC002,  also  indicated  similarity  of  the 
pharmacokinetics of EG12014 and Herceptin. Based on popPK modelling using neoadjuvant data from 
study EGC002, the total clearance and central volume of distribution were 0.210 and 0.234 L/day, and 
3.07 and 3.08 L for EG12014 and Herceptin, respectively. Similar clearance is also indicated at steady 
state (adjuvant phase). 
Efficacy 
Similar outcomes in the two treatment groups were reported for the primary efficacy analysis (in the full 
analysis  data  set).  In  total,  191  subjects  (47%)  in  the  EG12014  arm  and  192  (48%)  subjects  in  the 
Herceptin arm were responders according to pCR (regardless of in-situ changes). The pCR risk difference 
(95% CI) between the two arms was -0.004 (-0.072, 0.065), which is within the pre-defined equivalence 
margins  of  ±13%.  Most  of  the  stratification  subgroup-  and  sensitivity  analyses  reflect  the  primary 
endpoint. 
The secondary endpoint of pCR defined otherwise than the primary endpoint (in breast tissue only and 
exclusive  in-situ  changes),  had  comparable  findings,  with  the 95%CI  risk  difference  containing  0  and 
within  its  equivalence  margins.  The  objective  response  rate  (95%  CI)  prior  to  surgery  was  in  the 
EG12014 arm 84% (80-87%) and in the Herceptin arm 84% (80-87%). So, the ORR results support the 
outcome of the primary endpoint. The result is hence based on multimodal tests (i.e., pathologic, and 
radiologic data). 
For the entire study, event-free survival was 25 subjects in the EG12014 arm and 30 in the Herceptin 
arm. Overall survival was 4 in the EG12014 arm and 5 in the Herceptin arm. Hazard ratios for EFS and 
OS were 0.775 (95% CI: 0.45, 1.33) and 0.741 (95%CI: 0.20, 2.77), respectively. So, very few survival-
related events were found in total, and no indication of any differences could be seen in EG12014 and 
reference product. No indications of any detrimental effect are seen in the study arms. 
In conclusion, a comparable efficacy profile of EG12014 to the reference product support biosimilarity. 
Safety 
In  the  Phase  1  study  EGC001,  the  incidence  of  TEAEs  was  similar  between  the  EG12014  and  US 
Herceptin arms, 67.9% vs 60.7%, while it was slightly lower in the EU Herceptin arm, 46.4%. It is of 
note  that  these  numerical  imbalances  are  not  unexpected  in  such  a  small  study  (28  subjects  in  each 
arm). 
In the pivotal phase 3 study EGC002, neoadjuvant part, the overall incidence and severity of TEAEs was 
comparable between the EG12014 and Herceptin treatment arms, 99.2% vs 98.5% respectively. There 
were  no  obvious  differences  noted  between  the  treatment  arms  in  the  frequencies  of  patients 
experiencing TEAEs within reported SOCs or PTs. Likewise, laboratory findings and cardiac assessments 
(LVEF  and  ECG)  appeared  balanced  between  the  treatment  arms.  For  the  adjuvant  part,  the  overall, 
incidence, severity, and causality of TEAEs were comparable for the three study drug arms. 
Immunogenicity of EG12014 appears to be relatively low (“de novo” ADAs: incidence ~3.3%, no NAbs, 
no apparent persistence) and comparable to the reference product EU Herceptin based on available data 
in EBC patients. 
Overall, a comparable safety immunogenicity profile has been shown between the proposed biosimilar 
EG12014 and the originator product, establishing biosimilarity (in combination with taxanes). 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 96/99 
 
  
 
 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about biosimilarity 
There are no remaining uncertainties and limitations that have an impact on the conclusion of 
biosimilarity. 
3.4.    Discussion on biosimilarity 
EG12014 can be considered as a biosimilar to EU-Herceptin from a quality point of view, a non-clinical 
point of view and clinical point of view. The comparability exercise has been successful and similarity to 
the reference medicinal product in terms of quality characteristics, biological activity, safety and efficacy 
has been established. 
The pivotal phase I PK study EGC001 in healthy volunteers, apparently demonstrates similarity of the 
pharmacokinetics of EG12014 and Herceptin. PK data obtained as secondary endpoints in the phase 3 
study EGC002, also indicated similarity of the pharmacokinetics of EG12014 and Herceptin. Similar PK 
(CL  and  Vc)  of  EG12014  and  Herceptin  in  EBC  patients  is  indicated  based  on  popPK  modelling  using 
sparse PK data from the neoadjuvant part of study ECG002. 
Pathological complete response (pCR) was chosen as the primary efficacy endpoint, in accordance with 
CHMP guidance. The EGC002 trial has demonstrated that the risk difference of pCR at the time of surgery 
was within its predefined margins. Results of secondary surgical-related and survival-related endpoints 
of the study, sensitivity analyses and most of the sub-group analyses reflect the primary endpoint and 
are also supporting therapeutic similarity. 
3.5.  Extrapolation of safety and efficacy 
The  indications  granted  for  the  reference  product  EU-Herceptin  150  mg  are  all  claimed  for  the 
trastuzumab biosimilar EG12014. 
The mechanism of action of trastuzumab is the same in all three indications. The dosage is also similar 
for all three indications, and trastuzumab is administered via the same route in all indications 
mentioned. Based on these points extrapolation of all originator indication can be supported given that 
robust evidence from the quality characterisation, functional assays, clinical pharmacokinetics, efficacy 
and safety including immunogenicity is demonstrated. 
3.6.  Additional considerations  
Not applicable. 
3.7.  Conclusions on biosimilarity and benefit risk balance 
Based on the review of the submitted data, EG12014 is at present considered biosimilar to Herceptin 
and a benefit/risk balance comparable to the reference product can be concluded. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Herwenda is favourable in the following indication(s): 
EMA/514898/2023  
Page 97/99 
 
  
 
 
Breast cancer 
Metastatic breast cancer 
Herwenda is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic breast cancer 
(MBC): 
- 
as monotherapy for the treatment of those patients who have received at least two 
chemotherapy regimens for their metastatic disease. Prior chemotherapy must have included at least 
an anthracycline and a taxane unless patients are unsuitable for these treatments. Hormone-receptor 
positive patients must also have failed hormonal therapy, unless patients are unsuitable for these 
treatments. 
- 
in combination with paclitaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease and for whom an anthracycline is not suitable. 
- 
in combination with docetaxel for the treatment of those patients who have not received 
chemotherapy for their metastatic disease. 
- 
in combination with an aromatase inhibitor for the treatment of postmenopausal patients with 
hormone-receptor positive MBC, not previously treated with trastuzumab. 
Early breast cancer 
Herwenda is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with HER2 positive early breast cancer (EBC): 
- 
following surgery, chemotherapy (neoadjuvant or adjuvant) and radiotherapy (if applicable) 
(see section 5.1). 
- 
following adjuvant chemotherapy with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide, in combination with 
paclitaxel or docetaxel. 
- 
- 
in combination with adjuvant chemotherapy consisting of docetaxel and carboplatin. 
in combination with neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by adjuvant Herwenda therapy, for 
locally advanced (including inflammatory) disease or tumours > 2 cm in diameter (see sections 4.4 
and 5.1). 
Herwenda should only be used in patients with metastatic or early breast cancer whose tumours have 
either HER2 overexpression or HER2 gene amplification as determined by an accurate and validated 
assay (see sections 4.4 and 5.1). 
Metastatic gastric cancer 
Herwenda in combination with capecitabine or 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin is indicated for the treatment 
of adult patients with HER2 positive metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach or gastro-esophageal 
junction who have not received prior anti-cancer treatment for their metastatic disease. 
Herwenda should only be used in patients with metastatic gastric cancer (MGC) whose tumours have 
HER2 overexpression as defined by IHC2+ and a confirmatory SISH or FISH result, or by an IHC3+ 
result. Accurate and validated assay methods should be used (see sections 4.4 and 5.1).

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Lamzede is intended as long-term enzyme replacement therapy in adults, adolescents and children 
aged 6 years and older with alpha-mannosidosis. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
The prevalence of alpha-mannosidosis reported in the literature ranges from 1:500 000-1:1 000 000 
worldwide. A study from Norway reported six (later eight) patients in a population of 4.5 million (Malm 
D, et al. 1995). 
Alpha-mannosidosis has been described in most parts of the world, and is not specific to any ethnic 
group or sex. 
2.1.3.  Aetiology and pathogenesis 
Alpha-mannosidosis is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorder caused by mutations in the 
MAN2B1 gene on chromosome 19 which codes for the enzyme alpha-mannosidase. The alpha-
mannosidosis Mutation Database maintained by the University of Tromsø, the Arctic University of 
Norway, and the University Hospital of North Norway currently reports 155 mutations identified in 190 
patients. No mutation is predominant, most are private mutations, and 3 mutations are present in 
more than 30% of European alpha-mannosidosis patients.  
The effect of the enzyme deficiency is blockage of the degradation of glycoproteins, which results in 
the accumulation of mannose rich oligosaccharides in all tissues. Progressive lysosomal accumulation 
of non-degradable metabolites results in generalized cell and tissue dysfunction and multi-systemic 
pathologies.  
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Clinical presentation 
The disorder is generally classified into three separate subtypes: mild (type 1), moderate (type 2) and 
severe (type 3). Most affected individuals diagnosed fall into the moderate subtype. It is important to 
note, because of the highly variable nature of the disorder, that affected individuals will not have all of 
the symptoms discussed below. 
The mild form may not be evident until the teen years and progresses slowly. Symptoms typically 
include muscle weakness. Skeletal abnormalities are usually not present. Most patients have normal 
cognitive and physical development, although some present with mild to moderate intellectual 
disability.  
In the moderate form of the disorder signs of skeletal abnormalities and muscle weakness may appear 
before ten years of age and progress slowly. Ataxia (an impaired ability to coordinate voluntary 
movements) may develop by the age of 20-30. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 9/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The severe form begins within the first year of life. In most cases, infants appear normal at birth, but 
the condition grows progressively worse. Type 3 alfa-mannosidosis is characterized by rapid 
progression of intellectual disability, hydrocephalus, progressive impairment of the ability to coordinate 
voluntary movements (ataxia), enlargement of the liver and spleen (hepatosplenomegaly), skeletal 
abnormalities, and coarse facial features. Intellectual disabilities associated with alfa-mannosidosis can 
range from mild cognitive impairment to profound mental deficiency. A diminished or abnormal 
immune system response can make affected individuals more susceptible to bacterial infections, 
particularly of the respiratory system. Infections affecting the middle ear and gastrointestinal tract are 
also common.  
The wide range of disease severity may reflect allelic forms of the disease. The variability in the clinical 
course of the disease even in patients with the same mutations suggests the existence of epigenetic 
effects (Govender et al.2014). 
Some experts have recognized that the disease encompasses “a continuum of clinical findings from a 
perinatal-lethal form to one that is not diagnosed until adulthood”. In general, phenotypes of patients 
with alpha-mannosidosis are not considered “clearly distinguishable” and the prediction of the clinical 
course for an individual patient is very challenging. 
There is no clear relationship between the degree of alpha-mannosidase activity loss and the clinical 
phenotype or a defined genotype-phenotype relationship.  
Diagnosis 
A diagnosis is made by measuring the enzymatic activity of alpha-D-mannosidase in white blood cells. 
If there is a decreased level of the enzyme in comparison to standard levels, a diagnosis can be made. 
It is thought that this disorder might be under-diagnosed for a few different reasons—the diagnosis is 
often made late in the disease's progression, symptoms are often mild, or the biochemical diagnosis 
does not yield conclusive results. 
Prognosis 
The life expectancy in alpha-mannosidosis is highly variable. Individuals with early onset severe and 
rapid progressive disease often do not survive beyond childhood, whereas those with milder disorders 
may survive well into adult life.  
2.1.5.  Management 
Given the clinical severity and the typical age of diagnosis, most severe patients are potential 
candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow transplantation (BMT).  
Currently, no licensed therapy is available, and the older less severe patients are managed with 
supportive care including symptom management, medical and surgical treatment of complications (e.g. 
infections, skeletal deformities), and physical therapy. 
About the product 
Lamzede is a recombinant human alpha mannosidase developed as an intravenous enzyme 
replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of alpha-mannosidosis. The objective of treatment with 
velmanase alfa is to administer the deficient enzyme into the blood stream, from where it will be 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 10/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
internalised by the cells and transported to the lysosomes. Here it will act as the endogenous enzyme, 
which these patients are known to be deficient in. The ERT is given life long and aims to normalise 
oligosaccharide levels in the body, to prevent progression of the disease thereby preventing 
abnormalities from being developed and to improve the patient’s condition. 
The claimed indication for Lamzede was for the long-term enzyme replacement therapy in patients 
with alfa-mannosidosis. Lamzede is indicated in adults, adolescents and children aged 6 years and 
older. 
The indication approved by the CHMP was “Enzyme replacement therapy for the treatment of non-
neurological manifestations in patients with mild to moderate alpha-mannosidosis.” 
The recommended dose regimen of Lamzede is 1 mg/kg of body weight administered once every week 
by intravenous infusion at a controlled speed.  
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant sought scientific advice in 2010, 2011 and 2014. The initial advice was in relation to pre-
clinical development and the proposed target population and age of patients, as well as dose selection 
and design of the phase III placebo controlled study, and selection of endpoints.  
The follow up advice related to the phase-3 trial choice of endpoints, the placebo/control ratio and the 
possibility for an application under exceptional circumstances. The final advice related to quality and 
pre-clinical issues. 
The application was submitted as a full application according to Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC, 
•  Exceptional circumstances 
The Applicant considered that the grounds for marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances apply to Lamzede according to the Article 14 (8) of Regulation (EC) 276/2004 and to 
Part II.6 of Annex I to Directive 2001/83/EC and provided justification based on the inability to provide 
comprehensive efficacy and safety data due to rarity of indication.  
Alpha-mannosidosis is an orphan condition, with an estimated prevalence of approximately 
1:1,000,000 people, and received orphan medicinal product designation in 2005 for the treatment of 
alpha-Mannosidosis (EU/3/04/260).  
At present, there are no orphan medicinal products marketed in the EU for the treatment of alpha-
mannosidosis.  
The applicant also noted that:  
• 
• 
• 
the availability of subjects for conduct of trials is very limited; 
the clinical development programme has been conducted taking into account limitations due to the 
extremely low incidence of the disease and the limited availability of patients; 
due to the rarity and extreme variability in clinical symptomatology there is no disease-specific 
validated clinically relevant endpoint.

mannitol and glycine. 
The product is available in a 10 ml vial (Type I glass) with a bromobutyl rubber stopper, an aluminium 
seal and a polypropylene flip off cap. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
2.2.2.1.  General Information 
Genetic deficiency of lysosomal alpha-mannosidase leads to the accumulation of non-degraded 
oligosaccharides in the lysosome and symptoms consistent with the lysosomal storage disease, alpha-
mannosidosis. Lysosomal alpha-mannosidases are members of the glycoside hydrolase family 38 
(GH38 Class II). They are involved in the catabolism of Asn-linked glycans of glycoproteins and play a 
vital role in maintaining cellular homeostasis. These enzymes catalyse the hydrolysis of α-1,2-, α-1,3- 
and α-1,6-glycosidic bonds with retention of confirmation of the anomeric carbon of the released 
mannose residue. 
Velmanase alfa is an active form of the human lysosomal enzyme alpha-mannosidase which is 
expressed in genetically modified Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells as a 1011 amino acid precursor 
including a 49 residue N-terminal signal sequence. The molecular mass of mature velmanase alfa 
(monomer) including glycosylation is 130 kDa. The velmanase alfa glycoprotein was identified to have 
11 potential N-glycosylation sites and 10 of them were found to be fully or partially glycosylated. 
After internalisation into the lysosome the enzyme is further processed/maturated to 5 peptides that 
are held together with disulfide bridges, ionic or hydrophobic forces maintaining the 3D structure. Once 
in the lysosome, the active enzyme then sequentially starts to degrade stored oligomannoses releasing 
mannoses which can then be reused by the body. The uptake at lower concentrations is mediated via 
the mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) but at higher enzymatic concentrations other receptors or 
mechanisms also seem to be involved. 
2.2.2.2.  Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The manufacturing site for the active substance is Rentschler Biopharma SE, Germany.  
A cell culture fed-batch process is used as upstream process. The seed train includes cell expansion 
from the WCB via shake flasks followed by a bioreactor. The production of velmanase alfa is performed 
in a fed-batch bioreactor system. At the end of the production stage, the supernatant is harvested by 
centrifugation and clarified by depth filtration and finally filtered through a bioburden reduction filter.  
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 12/109 
 
 
 
 
 
The purification process starting from clarified culture supernatant contains four chromatographic 
steps. The active substance bulk is formulated in a sodium phosphate/glycine/ D-Mannitol buffer.  
The container closure consists of a sterile bag. Sufficient information on the container closure system 
has been provided.  
Control of Materials 
The parental cell line used for the transfection was derived from the Chinese hamster cell line CHO 
DG44 that was originally obtained as an adherent cell line, and was routinely sub-cultured in fetal 
bovine serum (FBS). The cell line was adapted to serum free suspension culture for production in 
larger scale. The history of the parenteral cell line and the generation of the velmanase alfa cDNA and 
expression vector have been described in sufficient detail.  
A two-tier cell bank system, consisting of a Master Cell Bank (MCB) and Working Cell Bank (WCB) has 
been established. In addition, ‘end of production’ (EOP) cell banks have also been generated. The MCB, 
WCB and EOP cell banks have been characterized and tested for identity, purity, stability and 
adventitious agents as per ICH guidelines. 
Extensive information has been provided on raw materials, including overviews of all compendial and 
non-compendial raw materials (the latter with specifications). In addition, the composition of all buffers 
used during purification has been specified in detail.  
Control of critical steps and intermediates 
There are no intermediates isolated within the active substance manufacturing process. 
Due to the fact that the protein is quite large (2 x 130 kDa) and cannot be fully and conclusively 
characterised and controlled, the control of the process is of utmost importance to ensure a consistent 
quality of the desired product. The Applicant provided an appropriate overview of the control strategy 
for the manufacturing process.  
In process controls (IPCs) and performance indicators have been provided. Upon request, the applicant 
has provided a list of identified critical quality attributes (CQAs) including a justification for the 
assignment. The CQAs are reflected in the specification. The information provided on the classification 
of CQAs is considered acceptable. 
Process verification studies and small scale studies of selected steps and parameters generally support 
the identified IPCs.  
Classification of critical process parameters (CPPs) is relatively conservative. Full linkage studies 
between CQAs and CPPs have not been performed, but are also not expected, taking into consideration 
that the process is not developed by a full Quality by Design approach.   
Ranges and/or operational set points have been established for the CPPs. The implication of the 
classification of process parameter and performance indicators, including handling of deviations and 
changes, is sufficiently transparent. 
Process validation 
The applicant has provided an overview of small scale evaluation studies for the upstream and 
downstream process (USP and DSP). These process evaluation studies were based on criticality 
evaluation by FMEA (Failure Mode and Effect Analysis) assessment. Small scale models were used to 
support process characterisation. Suitability of the models was demonstrated by running them in 
parallel to full scale GMP lots.  The results of individual unit operations of the small scale runs were 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 13/109 
 
 
 
 
 
compared to the results of the full scale runs. The evaluation studies were used to adapt and optimise 
the manufacturing process and to establish a control strategy. 
The results from the process verification were satisfactory. The hold times have been appropriately 
justified. Impurity removal evaluation has been performed for some impurities in small scale models.   
Removal of impurities throughout the process has been validated at full scale for host cell DNA and 
HCP.  
Aggregates were tested as high molecular weight (HMW) species. The proposed commercial life time of 
the chromatography resins is set in accordance with results from small scale studies. A verification 
program will be implemented at full scale when the number of lifetimes exceeds the number currently 
verified by production scale runs.  
A satisfactory risk assessment and information on extractables/leachables has been provided for 
container closure systems such as Bioprocess containers used to store/hold process buffers and 
product containing process solutions, the primary packaging material for active substance, the tubing 
used for transfer of product containing process solution (aliquotation) and process and sterile filters.  
Manufacturing process development 
The process history has been described in detail. The active substance manufacturing process has 
undergone minor process optimisations during non-clinical and clinical development. The 
manufacturing process principles in terms of the USP and DSP steps have not changed, but some steps 
were optimised to reduce product loss, to simplify the subsequent finished product manufacturing 
process, and to ensure process robustness and reproducibility.  
Retrospective review of IPC data for each affected process step and active substance batch analysis 
data have been provided. In order to support the claim that the USP and DSP process optimizations 
have not impacted on product quality, the results of performance parameters for each process batch 
and batch analysis result ranges for each process iteration have been retrospectively reviewed and are 
presented. A change history of the specification has also been provided. Based on the data provided 
the comparability of the GMP batches is considered demonstrated. 
Characterisation 
In the active native state the enzyme forms a homodimer of 2 x 130 kDa. In the lysosome, the 
enzyme is maturated by proteolytic cleavage into five peptides linked together with disulphide bridges 
and/or hydrophobic and electrostatic forces, maintaining the 3D structure. The enzyme coordinates 
one Zn2+ ion in the active site and has 4 disulphide bridges and one free thiol. The enzyme is heavily 
glycosylated and has a wide variety of isoforms. Eleven potential glycosylation sites have been 
identified and 10 of them are fully or partially glycosylated.   
The applicant has employed a range of techniques in order to elucidate the primary structure of 
velmanase alfa, including intact mass analysis by MALDI-TOF (matrix assisted laser desorption 
ionization-time of flight), determination of amino acid composition by acid hydrolysis and RP-HPLC 
(reversed phase high performance liquid chromatography), peptide mapping, N and C-terminal 
sequencing by MALDI-ISD (matrix assisted laser desorption ionization – in source decay) and SDS-
PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis). 100% amino acid sequence 
coverage was achieved by peptide mapping. All other results also confirm the primary structure of the 
active substance. Disulphide bridges have been investigated by LC/MS-MS (Liquid chromatography-
tandem mass spectrometry) and also circular dichroism studies have been performed for the 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 14/109 
 
 
 
 
 
determination of the secondary structure. The 3D structure of the enzyme has been characterised by 
X-ray crystallography.  
N-glycan characterisation has been performed and the structures have also been confirmed using mass 
spectrometry. N-glycan profiling and mannose-6-phosphate analysis of digested N-glycans has been 
performed. The content of sialylated glycans has been determined. HILIC (hydrophilic interaction liquid 
chromatography) chromatograms of three active substance batches and two finished product batches 
have been presented.  
Size variants have been analysed by PAGE and SEC (size exclusion chromatography). The results of 
the SEC analysis confirmed the qualitative data of the Native-PAGE analysis, in that the most abundant 
form of the protein was dimer. Monomer was present, while low amounts of the multimer form was 
detected. Aggregation properties have been intensively investigated with UV-Vis absorbance, 90° light-
scattering, intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy, Nile Red fluorescence spectroscopy, 1,8-ANS 
fluorescence spectroscopy, Nile Red fluorescence microscopy, SEC-MALS, mFF-MALS and FFF-MALS. 
Low levels of aggregates have been observed. 
Purity has also been studied with RP-HPLC. Co-elution of peaks has been observed and fraction 
analysis of shoulders by SDS-PAGE has been performed. Characterisation data for the peaks observed 
in the RP-HPLC chromatograms have been provided. Fractionation of the peaks followed by peptide 
mapping has been performed. Deamidation and oxidation have been studied. 
Due to glycosylation several isoforms of the velmanase alfa protein exist. Further characterisation by 
chromatographic methods yielded a complex pattern of heterogeneity, which is mainly due to 
sialylation. 
Deamidation and oxidation has been studied by peptide mapping. 
In vitro studies have demonstrated that a small proportion of added velmanase alfa can enter cells via 
the M6P receptor which is considered as the main uptake mechanism at therapeutic doses of 
velmanase alfa. A biological assay for measuring enzymatic activity against accumulated natural 
substrate has been performed. All batches were found to be equally effective in removal of the storage 
products.  
A synthetic substrate was used for the quantitative determination of the enzymatic activity for all 
active substance and finished product batches. The results were similar, indicating that the catalytic 
efficiency between velmanase alfa batches can be considered equivalent.  
Forced degradation studies investigating effects of temperature, agitation, pH and light have been 
performed.  
2.2.2.3.  Specification 
The active substance specification consists of the following attributes: appearance and description 
(colour, clarity, and pH), microbiology (bioburden and bacterial endotoxins), identity (peptide map and 
SDS-PAGE, reduced), content (protein concentration), potency (enzymatic activity), purity (HCP, size, 
related substances, charge) and carbohydrate structure. 
For each attribute of the specification a justification of the respective acceptance criteria has been 
provided. Process capability and manufacturing history have been taken into account for the setting of 
specifications. 
The uptake of velmanase alfa into the target cells is necessary for the clinical efficacy. In vitro 
experiments have indicated that at therapeutic doses of velmanase alfa the cellular uptake is mediated 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 15/109 
 
 
 
 
 
by mannose-6-phosphate (M6P) receptors. As cellular uptake is crucial for clinical efficacy suitable 
tests addressing the cellular uptake should be included into the active substance specification. A major 
objection was raised during the procedure regarding the specification for M6P (mol/mol) and the 
absence of a validated cellular uptake assay.  
A cell-based method is being developed to analyse the ability of velmanase alfa to be internalized by 
target cells (cellular uptake), with the read-out of the method being velmanase alfa intracellular 
enzymatic activity.  
Upon request, the acceptance criteria for the M6P specification were tightened during the procedure. 
The limits should also be reviewed when further experience has been gained, with a view to further 
tightening the limits. 
With regard to the oligosaccharide profile, quantitative criteria have been introduced. The approach is 
considered acceptable in general to control consistency of glycosylation.   
Analytical methods 
The analytical methods have been satisfactorily described and validated according to ICH Q2. A 
surrogate enzyme assay using a synthetic substrate is used to determine the potency of velmanase 
alfa. The relative activity of an unknown sample is defined in comparison to the reference material.  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data for active substance batches manufactured at the 250L scale, including batches 
manufactured using the intended commercial process, have been provided. All results comply with the 
specifications in force at the time of testing. Development of the specifications has been adequately 
described. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 16/109 
 
 
 
 
 
Reference materials 
Sufficient information on the history of the active substance reference standards has been provided as 
well as a description of the generation of future reference standards. 
2.2.2.4.  Stability 
The stability studies were performed in accordance with ICH Q5C. 
All quality attributes tested demonstrated no change when active substance was stored at -70 °C and 
no significant trends could be observed. Data is available for up to 24 months for three batches and up 
to 12 months for one batch. Data for up to 6 months at -70 °C is available for the batches filled in 
Celsius bags. 
Data has also been presented for all pivotal batches stored under accelerated conditions for 6 months 
and stressed conditions for 4 weeks. 
A 24 month shelf life at -70 ± 10 °C is considered sufficiently justified based on the provided data.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
2.2.3.1.  Description of the product and Pharmaceutical Development 
The finished product (10 mg) is supplied in a 10 mL Type I glass vial as a powder for solution for 
infusion (white to off-white powder) which is to be reconstituted with 5 mL water for injections (not 
supplied) prior to use. The reconstituted finished product is a colourless liquid with pH 7.5 ± 0.5.  The 
strength of the reconstituted finished product is 2 mg/mL, formulated in glycine, mannitol and 
Na2HPO4/NaH2PO4. The finished product includes a 6% overfill.   
The excipients are commonly used and comply with compendial requirements (Ph.Eur).  
The container closure for the finished product consists of a sterile, clear 10 mL Type I glass vial sealed 
with 20 mm Bromobutyl stopper with an aluminium seal and green polypropylene flip off cap.   
The formulation development studies were based on an initial formulation, which had previously been 
successful for other similar products and then challenging its performance against modified 
formulations by testing a number of Critical Quality Attributes (CQAs).  Formulation variables such as 
pH, ionic strength, buffer system were tested as well as addition of detergents, sucrose, albumin, EDTA 
and protease inhibitor cocktail.  Ultimately the original formulation buffer using the conservative 
lyophilisation cycle was considered to be fit for purpose.  
Three distinct manufacturing processes (process 1-3) were used for manufacturing finished product for 
clinical studies.  
The strategy to confirm the change from Process 2 to Process 3 is based on comparison of release 
testing and additional characterisation on one batch of old versus new. The batch analysis results of 
five Process 3 batches are well in line with those of process 2 batches. Furthermore, the additional 
characterisation data indicate similar quality attributes and it is concluded that Process 2 and Process 3 
product are highly similar.  
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018

2.2.3.2.  Manufacture of the product and process controls 
One batch of finished product comprises aliquots of one or more active substance batch, pooled, 
aseptically filtered, filled, lyophilized and capped.  There are no additional formulation steps in the 
manufacture of finished product following receipt of the active substance bulk. 
The finished product manufacturing process has been appropriately described. 
Process parameters are presented as set points and, if applicable, ranges. Relevant lyophilisation 
parameters are provided as set points for each lyophilisation step. Critical process parameters have 
been satisfactorily identified and the process is adequately controlled. 
Process verification studies consist of three velmanase alfa finished product batches that were 
produced in accordance with the process validation protocol using two active substance batches. All 
process parameters were operated within their predefined operating ranges.  Performance indicator 
testing results were within the predefined acceptance criteria. Homogeneity of fill was demonstrated at 
the start, beginning and end of fill by monitoring multiple quality attributes of the product. The 
lyophilisation process was validated at minimum and maximum loads according to a pre-defined 
sampling plan. The process verification studies were adequately designed and the yielded results are 
considered satisfactory.  
2.2.3.3.  Product specification 
The finished product specification includes tests for appearance and description for the lyocake and 
reconstituted product, microbiology (sterility and bacterial endotoxins), identity (isoelectric focusing 
and SDS-PAGE, reduced), content (protein concentration), potency (enzymatic activity) and purity 
(size, related substances). The approach for setting the acceptance criteria for each specification has 
been described and analytical results from batches have been provided. Upon request, the acceptance 
criteria of a number of specifications were tightened in order to ensure that the quality of future 
batches will be comparable to those used in clinical trials.  
Analytical methods 
With the exception of appearance, residual moisture and reconstitution time of the freeze-dried 
product, the non-compendial methods are the same as those used for the active substance. As the 
matrix of the active substance and the reconstituted finished product are identical, the active 
substance validation data are also applicable to the finished product.   
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data were provided. All batches complied with the specifications in place at the time of 
manufacture. 
Reference materials 
Please refer to the active substance section. The same reference standards are used for testing both 
the active substance and finished product. 
2.2.3.4.  Stability of the product 
The proposed shelf life for the finished product is 2 years when stored at 2-8 °C.  
The stability studies are based on the principles outlined in ICH Q5C. The primary packaging material 
used is representative of the proposed commercial primary packaging (type I glass vial). 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 18/109 
 
 
 
 
 
Long term stability data are available up to 24 months for four batches. No clear trends were observed 
and the studies indicate that the product is stable for 24 months at 2-8 °C. 
The applicant has presented compatibility/in-use stability data covering storage at 5°C for 24 hours, 
storage at 25°C for 10 hours and infusion time bracketing the worst case scenarios for body weight. 
These in-use studies adequately support the information in the SmPC, i.e. chemical and physical in-use 
stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 2-8 °C.   
Based on results from a photostability study it was concluded that the finished product should be 
stored protected from light. This is appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
In conclusion, the proposed shelf life of 2 years when stored at 2-8 °C is acceptable. 
2.2.3.5.  Adventitious agents 
The velmanase alfa manufacturing process contains 4 orthogonal viral clearance steps, including virus 
inactivation and removal steps. These manufacturing steps have been validated using suitable model 
viruses in accordance with ICH Q5A (R1): Viral Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology Products Derived 
from Cell Lines of Human or Animal Origin. 
The unfiltered harvest (unprocessed bulk) is tested for the presence of adventitious viruses and 
mycoplasma in accordance with the European Pharmacopoeia. 
Two virus assays are routinely performed. 
An acceptable retroviral risk assessment has been presented; the risk of a retrovirus-like particle 
contamination in the finished product is considered to be negligible.  
In summary, the data on adventitious agents and virus validation data suggest that viral safety of 
velmanase alfa is sufficiently assured.  
2.2.3.6.  Post Approval Change Management Protocol for the Finished Product 
The Applicant included a Post Approval Change Management Protocol (PACMP) to add a second finished 
product manufacturing and batch release as well as stability testing site. Consequential changes are 
adaption of the finished product manufacturing process to the new site and introduction of primary 
packaging materials of the same quality but with slightly different dimensions.  
To demonstrate the suitability of the newly defined manufacturing parameters, process validation runs 
with commercial scale batches will be performed following a pre-defined validation protocol. 
Specifications for process controls and testing of samples taken at each step of the manufacturing 
process have been provided. 
A comparability assessment following the principles outlined in ICH Q5E will be initiated. 
The PACMP was considered acceptable. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate satisfactory 
consistency and uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the 
conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 19/109 
 
 
 
 
 
Due to the fact that the protein is quite large (2 x 130 kDa) and cannot be fully and conclusively 
characterised and controlled by analytical methods, especially as regards monomer/dimer formation, 
charge heterogeneity, biological activity and glycosylation, the control of the process is of utmost 
importance to ensure a consistent quality of the desired product.  
During the procedure a major objection was raised on the control strategy of the active substance. In 
response the Applicant amended the control strategy as regards CQAs and CPP and the process is now 
considered sufficiently under control.  
In vitro experiments indicate that at therapeutic doses of velmanase alfa the cellular uptake is 
mediated by M6P receptors. As cellular uptake is essential for clinical efficacy suitable tests addressing 
the cellular uptake should be included into the active substance specification.  A major objection was 
raised during the procedure regarding the specification for M6P and the absence of a validated cellular 
uptake assay. In response, the Applicant tightened the limit for M6P which provides additional 
reassurance with respect to consistent quality of the product. In addition, the limits should be reviewed 
when further experience has been gained.  Further control is however needed by implementation of a 
cellular uptake assay, which is currently being developed. The Applicant committed to finalise the 
development and validation of the cellular uptake assay and to include it in the release specifications.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been 
presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Lamzede  (velmanase  alfa)  is  a  form  of  human  alpha-mannosidase  produced  in  mammalian  Chinese 
Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells by recombinant DNA technology. 
The non-clinical testing strategy followed for the development of velmanase alfa took into account the 
ICH  S6 (R1) guidance on  Preclinical Safety Evaluation of Biotechnology- Derived Pharmaceuticals and 
guidance obtained in the Scientific Advice Procedure with the EMA in 2010 and 2014.  
2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies  
In vitro experiments were conducted to establish the cellular uptake mechanisms and stability of 
velmanase alfa. These studies demonstrated that fibroblasts from alpha-mannosidosis patients were as 
efficient as HeLa (human cervical cancer cells) and J774 cells (mouse monocytic/macrophage cell line) 
in internalizing velmanase alfa whereas MPR 46/300 cells (Mannose-6-Phosphate (M6P ) receptor 
deficient mouse fibroblasts) did not take up any appreciable amounts of velmanase alfa (data not 
shown). 
Assessment report

In order to further establish the contribution of the M6P receptor to the cellular uptake of velmanase 
alfa, cell cultures from alpha-mannosidosis patients were fortified with M6P concomitantly with 
velmanase alfa  
(Figure 1).

MPR300 cells in the absence and presence of M6P (C) and in relation to dose (D) Immunofluorescence 
staining of WT fibroblasts (E) and M6P receptor deficient cells (F) demonstrating localization of 
velmanase alfa (red) in LAMP1 (green, inset) positive vesicles 
Experiments were also conducted to assess the uptake of velmanase alfa into fibroblast from different 
species (Figure 2). The cells were grown confluent before addition of velmanase alfa (rhLAMAN in 
figure) in different concentrations. After 2 days incubation, the cells were harvested and intracellular 
LAMAN activity was measured and correlated to total protein content. 
Figure 2. Cellular uptake of velmanase alfa (26U/mg) by fibroblasts from different species 
A number of different in vivo ERT studies in mice models of α-mannosidosis were conducted and are 
summarised in Table 1.  
Six investigations were conducted in α-mannosidosis KO mice. Since repeated dosing in α-m KO mice 
resulted in a progressive immune response, a different α-mannosidosis mouse model (Tg+/α-mKO 
mice) was developed to circumvent the immunogenicity of velmanase alfa  (4.2.1.1.5; 4.2.1.1.6; 
4.2.1.1.9). The immune tolerance was achieved by inserting a gene that expresses an inactive form of 
the human LAMAN enzyme (MutH72L) into blastocysts which were then implanted into pseudopregnant 
mice (4.2.1.1.5). The litters that expressed the transgene were then used for backcrossing into α-mKO 
mice.  Prior to investigating the dose response relationship of velmanase alfa in these Tg+/α-mKO

mice, the tissue expression of the transgene was demonstrated and there was also demonstration of 
deficient α-mannosidase activity

4.2.1.1.2) 
This study examined the effect of single iv dose of bovine LAMAN and recombinant mouse and human 
LAMAN (rhLAMAN) on tissue LAMAN activity and impact on tissue neutral oligosaccharides. The effect 
of two iv injections of rhLAMAN given 3 days apart was also studied.  
The clearance decreased from bovine to human to mouse LAMAN with plasma half-times of 4, 8 and 12 
min, respectively. The apparent half-life of the internalized enzyme was dependent on the enzyme 
source as well as tissue type and varied between 3 and 16 h.  
Injections of 100 mU of mouse LAMAN to α-mKO mice, showed a maximum LAMAN activity in 
investigated organs at 2–4 h after injection. Between 4 and 10 hrs after injection the enzyme activity 
decreased rapidly in liver, spleen and kidney with an apparent half-life of about 3 hrs.

The corrective effect on the tissue storage of neutral oligosaccharides was transient but also time-, 
tissue- and dose-dependent (for time- and tissue dependency, After a single dose of rhLAMAN the 
maximum corrective effect was observed between 3 and 6 days after injection. In general the 
corrective effect of the rhLAMAN was higher than that of the mouse LAMAN. Injection of 250 mU 
rhLAMAN/g body weight followed by a subsequent injection 3.5 days later was sufficient to clear liver, 
kidney and heart from neutral oligosaccharides. A decrease in mannose containing oligosaccharides 
was also observed in the brain, with levels lower than 30% of those found in control animals.

Another study in α-mKO mice, was conducted to further assess the cellular/tissue uptake of velmanase 
alfa and investigate the dose-response (Figure 3), effects on behavioural deficits (Figure 4) and 
impact on tissue oligosaccharides (Figure 5).

during the challenge phase of the experiment.

Tissue distribution of large scale rhLAMAN material in α-mKO mice – study 4.2.1.17 
A separate tissue distribution study in α-mKO mice was conducted to verify the tissue enzyme activity 
of clinical scale velmanase alfa . A single iv dose of 1000 U/kg showed highest LAMAN activity at 1 hr 
post dose in liver. The order of activity in other investigated tissues was heart > lung > spleen > 
thymus > kidney > brain. At 24 hrs post injection, the alpha-mannosidase activity was reduced by 
more than 50% except for the brain which showed higher enzyme activity at 24 hours compared to at 
one hour suggesting a slow transport of enzyme across the BBB and/or the blood-CSF barrier.    
Tissue LAMAN activity and impact on tissue oligosaccharides in 12 weeks study in younger 
LAMAN Tg+/KO mice (study 4.2.1.1.5) 
Two 12-week efficacy studies were conducted with Tg+/α-mKO mice. One study assessed the dose 
response of bi-weekly injections with 125, 250, 375 and 500 U/kg (corresponding to 4.8, 9.7, 15 and 
19 mg/kg) velmanase alfa and the other assessed the effect of weekly injections with 125 – 750 U/kg 
(corresponding to 4.7-28 mg/kg) velmanase alfa. In the dose-response study, the dose levels were 
125, 250, 375 and 500 U/kg (corresponding to 4.8, 9.7, 15 and 19 mg/kg) and WT mice and Tg+/α-
mKO mice injected with PBS served as controls. Activity assessment was based on tissue LAMAN

activity, measurement of β-hexosaminidase (lysosomal enzyme upregulated due to primary sugar 
storage), oligosaccharide storage in brain and spleen and measurement of free cholesterol in brain and 
microglia activation.  
Velmanase alfa treated Tg+/α-mKO mice showed a dose dependent increase of brain lysate LAMAN 
activity (5-14% of WT activity) while the β-hexosaminidase activity was reduced/normalized (75-82 % 
of WT levels) in all treated mice (Figure 2.1.2.6). 
A dose-dependent effect on the content of oligosaccharides in brains was also demonstrated with the 
highest dose (500 U/kg) being most effective.  Also the lowest dose of 125 U/kg showed a brain 
storage reduction of oligosaccharides of > 50%. At this dose, a complete reduction of stored sugars 
was observed in the spleen.  
The staining of brain tissue of WT mice and PBS and velmanase alfa treated Tg+/α-KO mice for free 
cholesterol and activated microglia (CD68 positive cells), showed no change in free cholesterol in 
velmanase alfa treated Tg+/α-KO mice whereas microglia activation was reduced in both the lowest 
and highest velmanase alfa dose, 125 and 500 U/kg, respectively.  
In the 12-week study in Tg+/α-mKO mice where the injection frequency was reduced to once weekly 
(4.2.1.1.5), the highest increase in brain lysate LAMAN activity was observed in brains of mice treated 
with 750 U/kg, the highest dose investigated, whereas use of lower doses did not demonstrate a dose 
dependent uptake of velmanase alfa.  Measurements of β-hexosaminidase activity revealed reduced 
enzyme levels in all ERT treated mice when compared to non-treated mice independent of the used 
dosage but this effect was less pronounced compared to that observed in bi-weekly treated mice.  The 
high dose of 750 U/kg were needed to significantly reduce storage of mannosyl-linked oligosaccharides 
in the brain and decrease microglia activation thus demonstrating the importance of dosing frequency 
(continuous exposure) for pharmacological response. 
Tissue LAMAN activity and impact on tissue oligosaccharides in 12 weeks study in older 
LAMAN Tg+/KO mice (study 4.2.1.1.6)   
To extend the information obtained in the dose-response study, a separate experiment was conducted 
in “older” Tg+/α-KO mice (4 months old at start of treatment) where velmanase alfa was administered 
as biweekly injections of 500 U/kg (15.6 mg/kg) for 14 weeks (4.2.1.1.6). Similar to previous studies, 
500 U/kg was effective in reducing oligosaccharide tissue storage and LAMP-1 levels and in normalizing 
lysosomal enzyme levels.  CD68 staining showed clear attenuation of microglia activation in the 
hippocampus, cerebral cortex and thalamus but not in the cerebellum. Improved neuromotor function 
was observed when assessed in the treadmill and there were indications of improvement in short-term 
working memory but not in “long-term reference memory”; the latter assessment were from water 
maze experiments.  
Tissue LAMAN activity and impact on tissue oligosaccharides in 39 weeks study in LAMAN 
Tg+/KO mice (study 4.2.1.1.9) 
The effect of once weekly dosing of velmanase alfa was examined also in a longer study (9 months)) 
than the above referenced 12-week study (4.2.1.1.6). The dose administered was 500 U/kg (15.6 
mg/kg), a dose also used in the 12-week study. Compared to the 12-week study, a more extensive 
battery of endpoints was investigated. Velmanase alfa reduced oligosaccharide storage and neuro-
inflammation in hippocampus.  Treatment of 30 weeks or longer improved spatial-cognitive abilities of 
α-mannosidosis mice to a significant degree whereas the shorter treatment period (10 weeks+) 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 25/109 
 
 
 
 
 
resulted in a more modest effect. Long-term ERT was, however, unable to restore higher cognitive 
abilities (measured in the Morris-type water maze with hidden escape platform) to the level observed 
in healthy mice.  
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Due to the specific activity of velmanase alfa no secondary pharmacodynamic effects are anticipated 
and therefore secondary pharmacodynamic studies were not conducted.  
Safety pharmacology programme 
The potential adverse effect of velmanase alfa on vital organs system was investigated in the repeat 
dose toxicity studies which are presented in Section 2.2.4 of this Report.    
Pharmacodynamic drug interactions 
No pharmacodynamic interaction studies were submitted as the applicant considered that unless 
patients are treated other ERT’s which utilizes the M6P receptor for cellular uptake of the enzyme, no 
pharmacodynamic interactions are expected when using the velmanase alfa. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
Absorption 
The plasma disposition of iv administered velmanase alfa was similar in the species used for repeat 
dose toxicity testing (Table 2).

Distribution 
The PK data obtained from samples collected on the first day of dosing in the conducted repeat dose 
toxicity study in monkeys (4.2.3.2.1), the pharmacokinetic study in rats (4.2.2.7.1) and the 26-week 
toxicity study in Tg+/α-mKO mice (4.2.3.2.2), gave volume of distribution (Vd area) figures in low dose 
females/males of 80/77, 57/66 and 92/81 mL/kg, respectively.  The calculated Vdarea in mice was 
much higher (approximately 2.5-fold) when calculated from the 26-week data than one calculated from 
the Day 1 data. 
Metabolism and Excretion 
There are no data that specifically address the metabolism or degradation of velmanase alfa. It is 
expected that velmanase alfa, just like the endogenous LAMAN and other proteins, will undergo 
proteolytic digestion to its amino acid constituents and subsequently to CO2 and H2O when fully 
metabolised.   
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
There are no non-clinical studies addressing pharmacokinetic drug interactions. Such interactions 
affecting either the safety or efficacy of the product are not expected owing to the nature of the 
product (endogenous enzyme) and the method of administration (intravenous injection). 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The non-clinical toxicity of velmanase alfa has been investigated in a set of repeat dose toxicity studies 
as well as in a full program of reproduction toxicity studies including a 10-week study in the juvenile 
rat. These studies were all GLP compliant. 
Single dose toxicity 
No specific single dose toxicity studies was performed in accordance with GLP but data on the acute 
toxicity of velmanase alfa can be extracted from investigative/pilot studies in the juvenile rat, in the 
monkey and in the rabbit.  
Acute toxicity in rat 
In a preliminary juvenile toxicity study in rats (Study 4.2.3.5.4.1), groups of 11 and 28 day old rats 
were administered velmanase alfa iv at dose levels of 466 and 1400 U/kg twice weekly (~19 mg/kg 
and 58 mg/kg, respectively). After the first dose and thereafter, swollen feet/limbs, swollen muzzles 
and/or piloerection, which lasted up to 4 hours after dosing, were observed. In high dose animals, 
excessive grooming was also noted. When rats, who had been treated twice weekly for three weeks at 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018

1400 U/kg (~58 mg/kg) were dosed twice daily for 3 consecutive days no clinical observation was 
observed from the morning of the second consecutive dosing day and throughout the rest of the 
dosing period.  
Acute toxicity in monkey 
In a dose escalation study in monkeys where velmanase alfa was administered biweekly as a slow iv 
bolus for 8 weeks, 1400 U/kg was shown to cause a marked reduction in food consumption whereas 
466 U/kg was associated with increased salivation (Study 4.2.3.1.1). 
Acute toxicity in rabbit 
In a small study in rabbits (n=2), a slow iv bolus dose of approximately 485 U/kg (20 mg/kg) was 
found to be well tolerated (Study 4.2.3.5.2.3).

Genotoxicity  and carcinogenicity  
Since velmanse alfa is a recombinant human enzyme, no genotoxicity or carcinogenicity studies were 
conducted, in accordance with the ICHS6 (R1) guidance on Preclinical Safety Evaluation of 
Biotechnology- Derived Pharmaceuticals (EMA/CHMP/ICH/731268/1998).  
Reproduction Toxicity 
Investigations  of  the  toxicity  of  velmanase  alfa  on  reproduction  consisted  of  a  standard  package  of 
reproduction  toxicity  studies  i.e.  a  fertility  and  early  embryonic  development  study  in  the  rat,  two 
embryo-fetal development studies, one in the rat and one in the rabbit (both supported by preliminary 
Assessment report

or dose-finding studies) and a prenatal and postnatal development study in the rat. In addition, a 10-
week juvenile rat toxicity study was conducted and supported by a pilot study in juvenile animals.

1The NOAEL’s related to bi-weekly dosing in all studies except for the EFD studies in rats and rabbits 
where daily dosing during organogenesis was used.2 The safety margins calculations have adjusted 
for the different dose regimens in the repeat dose toxicity studies compared to the clinical use which 
is once weekly. For the reproduction studies, there has been no adjustment for the different regimens 
used when calculating safety margins on a mg/kg and mg/m2 basis.  3The steady-state mean clinical

Local Tolerance 
Local Tolerance was investigated by a thorough macroscopic and histopathological examination of the 
injection/infusion sites from the repeated dose toxicity studies and the juvenile rat developmental 
study. There were no findings in the 26-week TG+KO mouse study or in the 10 week juvenile rat 
study. In the 13 week monkey study, which in contrast to the rodent studies used a 1 hour infusion, a 
number of histological changes were observed at the infusion site primarily involving the tail vein. 
However, these changes were also observed in control animals and were attributed to the mechanical 
trauma associated with the repeated catheterization of the infusion site vein.

Monkey PMW001 
Sera from rh-LAMAN injected monkeys taken six weeks after study start from three individual 
cynomolgus monkeys were analysed for inhibitory antibodies. The inhibition was calculated by 
comparing each immune serum to a pool of cynomolgus monkey pre-sera. The average inhibition for 
each serum was significantly below 8 % and was not considered to be inhibitory. LAMAN activity was 
also measured in the samples. The results for all three sera were below the linear range of the assay.  
Monkey- CRL 515896 
Sera from two rh-LAMAN injected monkeys (taken 18, 39 and 54 days from study start) were 
analysed. The sera were compared to a pool of cynomolgus monkey non immune sera.  No sample was 
found to be inhibitory. 
Monkey PWM002 
Sera from six rhLAMAN injected monkeys (two per dose group, 4 and 13 weeks from study start) were 
analyzed. The inhibition was calculated by comparing each immune serum to a pool of cynomolgus 
monkey pre-sera 1010047180, 1010047181, 1010047182 and 1010047183 (from study CRL 515896). 
None of the sera gave inhibition and there was no detectable rhLAMAN activity in any samples. 
Rat - CRL495110 
In the rat study all samples contained high concentrations of rhLAMAN and it could not be excluded 
that these samples contain inhibitory antibodies. Sera collected at week 5 and 10 from 1 male and one 
female from each of the two dose groups investigated in the preliminary juvenile rat toxicity study was 
also assayed for inhibitory antibodies. Since high velmanase alfa concentrations were present in the 
samples assayed, the inhibitory activity of the antibodies could not be determined. 
Other studies  
Velmanase alfa is a human enzyme and the protein is produced in CHO cells. The protein will be 
broken down into amino acids, which are naturally occurring in the human body and the environment. 
Given the nature of the product and its mechanism of action, no dedicated studies were submitted to 
address immunotoxicity, dependence, metabolism, and impurities. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No ERA specific studies were submitted, as velmanase alfa is a therapeutic enzyme which is classified 
as a protein and in accordance with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal 
Products for Human Use (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), it is considered unlikely that Lamzede will pose 
a significant risk to the environment.  
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In vitro experiments showed a low uptake (0.5 to 2%) of velmanase alfa in cells of different tissues 
and species, among them fibroblasts of an alpha-mannosidosis patient.  
When single fibroblast cell lines of several species were investigated for velmanase alfa uptake, mouse 
and human fibroblasts showed the highest uptake, rat, rabbit and cynomolgous monkey intermediate 
uptake and dog and pig fibroblasts the lowest uptake. This observation was used for the selection of 
mice, rats, rabbits, monkeys as the species in non-clinical safety studies.

Addition of M6P to the incubation medium containing velmanase alfa led in wild-type (WT)-cells and 
cells expressing at least one type of M6P receptor led to a decrease of the amount of enzymatic activity 
taken up into cells. This result and the observation that velmanase alfa is taken up to a much smaller 
extent in M6P receptor deficient cell lines compared to M6P receptor non-deficient cell lines indicates 
M6P receptor dependent uptake into cells. As uptake of enzymatic activity was also demonstrated 
using high velmanase alfa concentrations in fibroblasts lacking M6P receptors, M6P receptor 
independent uptake also contributes to the uptake of velmanase alfa into cells. These results indicate 
that there are at least two mechanisms involved in the uptake of velmanase into cells.  
Intracellullar distribution to lysosomes was indicated using immunohistochemistry after in vitro 
incubation of WT fibroblasts in medium containing a high velmanase alfa concentration. 
Relative high doses were needed to demonstrate a clear reduction of mannosyl-linked oligosaccharides 
in central and peripheral nervous tissues; four injections of 500 U/kg (~42 mg/kg) were needed for 
reduction in the cortex while 250 U/kg was needed for a reduction in the neurones of the trigeminal 
ganglion. The four injections of 500 U/kg in α-mKO mice resulted in 14.8% of the measured LAMAN 
activity in brain lysates of WT mice suggesting that not complete restoration of LAMAN activity is 
needed for significant reduction of CNS oligosaccharides.   
Examination of neuromotor (treadmill), total exploratory (open-field, elevated plus maze) and 
neurocognitive (water maze) abilities 4 days after the last injection in velmanase alfa-treated α-mKO 
mice (biweekly injections for two weeks of 500 U/kg) showed a complete or nearly complete reversal 
of ataxic symptoms but no or only marginally improvement in neurocognitive and exploratory defects. 
A possible explanation for this is that two weeks of treatment may be too short for reversing 
neurobehavioral deficits.  
Although proof of concept was shown in the mouse model, extrapolation of the efficacy of the product 
in mice to the human situation was hampered, as mice were dosed higher than humans. In addition, 
the in vitro assay showed that uptake in human cells reached a plateau at 200 mU/mL (which is likely 
reached as Cmax, with the recommended once weekly dose of 1 mg/kg). However, uptake in mice 
cells was more efficient than in human cells and did not reach a plateau at the highest concentration 
used in the assay of 400 mU/mL. Cmax in animals used for in vivo PD studies reaches levels of 12 fold 
(low dose) and 50 fold (high dose) the highest tested concentration in the in vitro PD studies 400 
mU/mL. Thus, it is assumed that more velmanase alfa is taken up in mice cells. As a reduction of 
oligosaccharides was observed in mouse brains, it was concluded that velmanase alfa can cross the 
BBB. However, in humans, velmanase alfa activity was not detected in the CSF, indicating that most 
likely it does not cross the BBB in humans.  
Single dose toxicity studies were not conducted. Acute toxicity symptoms, retrieved from preliminary 
studies or dose escalation studies, revealed swollen feet/limbs, swollen muzzles and piloerection in 
rats. Monkeys showed marked reduction in food consumption and in rabbits velmanase alfa was well 
tolerated. 
A 26 week repeated dose toxicity study has been conducted in immune tolerant transgenic Tg+/α-mKO 
mice. In this study, antibodies against velmanase alfa were developed as well as in the 13 weeks 
monkey repeated dose study. Antibodies seem to affect T ½ of and exposure to velmanase alfa. In the 
juvenile study in rat, one high dose animal developed antibodies without effect on exposure and T ½. 
In the EFD studies, both rat and rabbits developed antibodies against velmanase alfa, which seems to 
decrease exposure levels. As exposure in animals was sufficiently in excess compared to exposure in 
humans, antibody formation does not compromise the safety assessment of velmanase alfa in animals.  
Velmanase alfa is a recombinant human enzyme and genotoxicity studies are not warranted (ICH S6). 
The absence of genotoxicity and carcinogenicity studies is thus agreed.

The applicant did not submit a complete tissue distribution study. However, the distribution and 
efficacy pharmacology study present in the PD section suffices as a tissue distribution study for this 
product.  
Fertility, embryonic foetal development, pre and post-natal development were conducted in Han Wistar 
rats and the juvenile toxicity studies have been conducted in Sprague Dawley rats. As a second species 
for EFD study, New Zeeland White rabbits were used.  
In the fertility studies in male and female Han Wistar rats at doses of 3.3, 10 and 30 mg/kg biweekly, 
swollen muzzles and piloerection (females) were observed starting at mid dose treated animals, which 
is not regarded as a serious adverse event. 
In the rat EFD study, the F1 generation showed major abnormalities in 4/223 foetuses present in 3/20 
litters of high dose group. Effects were seen at a ± 50 fold higher Cmax and exposure, compared to 
humans. Data from historical controls are not provided, but considering the nature of the product and 
the indication of enzyme replacement, it is unlikely that these effects are related to treatment nor 
relevant for humans. 
In the main juvenile toxicity study Sprague Dawley rat were dosed with 5.5, 17 or 50 mg/kg biweekly 
(corresponding to 142, 426 and 1290 U/kg, respectively). Swelling was observed in the feet/limbs, 
muzzles and tail bases in all groups and as the rats did not appear to be in any pain, and the NOAEL 
was considered to be the high dose, i.e. 1290 U/kg administered twice weekly. 
Antibodies against velmanase alfa develop in nearly all animal studies including the 26 weeks study 
with velmanase alfa in Tg+/α-mKO mouse, expected to be immune tolerant, as well as in the 13 weeks 
monkey repeated dose study. Antibodies affect T½ of and exposure to velmanase alfa.  In the juvenile 
study in rat, one high dose animal developed antibodies without effect on exposure and T½. In the 
EFD studies, both rat and rabbits developed antibodies against velmanase alfa, which decrease 
exposure levels.  
The analysis of presence of velmanase alfa inhibitory antibodies is only possible when no velmanase 
alfa stimulatory activity is present in the sample. For the rat, inhibitory antibodies could not be 
detected due to presence of velmanase alfa activity. In the monkey, it seemed that antibodies were 
not inhibitory. However as exposure in mice is considerably higher than human exposure, the assay 
may also be of limited relevance.

The pharmacologic, pharmacokinetic, and toxicological characteristics of velmanase-alfa have been 
adequately characterised from a non-clinical perspective.

Studies rhLAMAN-07 and rhLAMAN-09 are long-term follow-up studies of identical design. Study -07 
is for patients in France, and Study -09 is for patients in Poland and Norway. The data collected in 
these studies have not been summarised separately but are included in the dataset for the rhLAMAN-
10 integrated analysis. 
Abbreviations: IV=intravenous; NA=not applicable 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The PK profile of velmanase alfa was investigated following a single IV infusion at escalating doses 
(6.25 to 100 U/kg, approximately 0.2 to 3.2 mg/kg) and after multiple infusions following weekly 
doses of 25 or 50 U/kg (0.8 or 1.6 mg/kg) up to approximately 4 years. These data has been 
generated from 34 patients diagnosed with alpha-mannosidosis from 6 clinical studies.  
The PK Analysis Set was defined as all patients from the safety analysis set excluding patients without 
any valid PK measurement or with major protocol deviations significantly affecting PK. 
Dose Conversion  
The dose selected for clinical development was rounded up to 1 mg/kg for dose convenience.  Although 
the 1 mg/kg dose is actually equivalent to a dose of approximately 30 U/kg, for the purposes of the 
integrated PK analyses, the 25 U/kg (0.8 mg/kg) dose was considered to be equivalent to 1 mg/kg. 
This was considered acceptable as all 16 patients received 1 mg/kg at first and last PK assessment 
(Day 1 and steady state, respectively) except for one patient who received 25 U/kg at Day 1. 
Absorption  
After single-dose administration, Cmax appeared to increase proportionally with the dose up to 100 
U/kg, except from the lowest 6.25 U/kg, where dose-normalized Cmax was up to 50% lower as 
compared to other doses. At steady-state Cmax was proportional at both 25 and 50 U/kg. AUC 
increased in a more than dose-proportional manner after both a single dose and at steady-state. At 
steady state after weekly infusion of 1 mg/kg, mean Cmax was approximately 8000 μg/L and was 
reached at 1.8 hours after the start of the infusion. The mean AUC accumulation ratio at steady state 
versus Day 1 was 1.6 (range 1.0 to 1.9; CV 16%). Mean t1/2 was approximately 2-fold higher (15 vs 
30 hrs), mean total body clearance was lower (10.7 vs 6.7 ml/h/kg), and the volume of distribution 
was slightly higher (2.2 vs 2.7 L/kg).  
Distribution 
The steady state volume of distribution was low (0.27 L/kg), indicating distribution confined to plasma.

Elimination 
Velmanase alfa is a recombinant version of the naturally occurring human enzyme, and the metabolic 
pathway is, therefore, predicted to be similar to other natural occurring proteins that degrade into 
small peptides and finally into amino acids. Mean clearance (normalised by body weight) was 6.7 
mL/h/kg after repeated weekly dosing of 1 mg/kg CHF-LMZYMAA1. At steady state, velmanase alfa 
clearance normalised by body weight in paediatric patients (<18 years, N=4) was higher than 
clearance in adult patients (≥18 years, N=8): 86 mL/h/kg versus 57 mL/h/kg, respectively. Mean 
elimination half-life was 30 hours after repeated dosing.  
Dose proportionality and time dependencies 
Dose proportionality was evaluated based on the data from studies rhLAMAN-02 and rhLAMAN-03.  
The mean velmanase alfa serum concentrations over 7 days of a single dose of 6.25, 12, 25, 50 or 
100 U/kg from Study rhLAMAN-02 is presented in Figure 6. The PK profile for all patients which 
received the proposed therapeutic dose of 1 mg/kg is presented in Table 7.

Intra- and Inter-Individual Variability in AUCinf and Cmax 
Mean  intra-individual  variability  in  AUCinf  and  Cmax  (the  mean  of  all  individual  CV%)  was  30%  and 
24%, respectively. 
The inter-individual variability in AUCinf and Cmax (CV%) was 33% and 20%, respectively. 
Special populations 
No studies were submitted using velmanase alfa to investigate PK in special populations. Velmanase 
alfa is predicted to be degraded into small peptides and finally into amino acids. 
The influence of age (<18 years and ≥18 years) on the PK of velmanase alfa was investigated in the 
rhLAMAN-10 integrated analysis in patients who received the 1 mg/kg dose.  
The PK profiles at Day 1 and the last PK assessment are plotted for patients below 18 years and for 
patients 18 years and above in Figure 7 and Figure 8.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Due to nature of the product, no interactions at CYP450 level or other drug-drug interactions are 
expected.  
Population PK analysis 
The objective of this population analysis was to develop a model to describe the pharmacokinetics of 
velmanase alfa in patients with alpha-mannosidosis, and to identify sources of interindividual variability 
in the PK of velmanase alfa. 
Population PK models were developed using nonlinear mixed-effects modeling which had 2 
components:  
(1) a structural model (one- or two-compartment model) that characterised the concentration-time 
relationship after velmanase alfa administration; 
(2) a random effects model containing inter-individual variability (IIV) in the PK parameters, and a 
residual-error component that accounted for intra-individual variability and measurement errors. 
Both one- and two-compartment models were fitted to the plasma concentration data. The structural 
parameters for a two-compartment model included clearance (CL), volume of distribution of the central 
compartment (V1), inter-compartmental clearance (Q), and volume of distribution of the peripheral 
compartment (V2). 
The predictability of the final model was evaluated using the visual predictive check (VPC) method 
(Yano 2001). 
Results 
Data set 
The final dataset for analysis contained 420 plasma concentration-time records from 34 subjects (20 
males and 14 females). The subjects contributed a total of 64 plasma concentration-time profiles. 
Subjects received single or repeated administrations of velmanase alfa administered as IV infusion at 
doses ranging from 6.25 to 100 U/kg. Subjects in the active treatment groups ranged in age between 
6 and 35 years (median = 17 years), in body weight (WT) between 18.7 and 105 kg (median = 62.6 
kg), in height (HT) between 112 and 191 cm (median = 159 cm), and in body mass index (BMI) 
between 14.6 and 35.4 kg/m2 (median = 24.5 kg/m2). 
Covariate Model 
Demographic variables such as weight, BMI, age, and height were highly correlated. Unexpected 
correlations were also observed between Study and Dose (higher doses in early studies) and 
demographics likely due to the unique design of the clinical development program (lower age and body 
weight (WT) in early studies).  Diagnostic plots from the base model revealed a strong correlation 
between IIV of all four PK parameters and WT. Once WT was added to the model, age and sex were 
tested as covariates of CL and V1. The results indicate that neither age nor sex were significant 
covariates of CL and V1 (data not shown).

The correlation between predicted and observed concentrations is shown in Figure 9. No significant 
(P<0.01) correlations were observed between the interindividual estimates across the primary PK 
parameters. The results of the Visual Predictive Check demonstrated that most of the observed data 
fell within the range of the 5th and 95th percentiles of the predicted steady-state data (data not 
shown).

Comparable pharmacokinetics were observed in children below the age of 6 years and above the age 
of 6 years, after 1 mg/kg weekly administrations, when doses were normalised by body weight. The 
simulation data obtained for children above 6 years of age was comparable to the data obtained from a 
PK study in children above 6 years of age. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
The primary PD action of velmanase alfa is reduction of serum oligosaccharides, which has been 
evaluated in patients across the clinical programme as a primary efficacy marker. The velmanase alfa 
enzyme is only active at acid pH in alpha-mannosidosis patients and so does not directly degrade 
oligosaccharides present in the serum.  
A reduction in serum oligosaccharides is representative of the intracellular lysosomal activity of CHF-
LMZYMAA1, which is lacking in alpha-mannosidosis patients. 
Primary and Secondary pharmacology 
Serum oligosaccharides were measured in all studies and are presented in detail in the clinical efficacy 
section of this report. 
Based on studies in in the murine LAMAN knockout model and confirmed by human PD markers (CSF 
oligosaccharides, neurodegenerative biomarkers and brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of 
white matter, grey matter and centrum semiovale) it can be concluded that velmanase alfa does not 
enter the CNS.  
No secondary pharmacologic effects were reported in the documentation submitted by the applicant. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 44/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
No PD drug interaction studies were performed as these are not anticipated based on the structure of 
the drug substance (recombinant human glycoprotein). 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Velmanase alfa is a recombinant version of the naturally occurring human enzyme, and the metabolic 
pathway is, therefore, predicted to be similar to other natural occurring proteins that degrade into 
small peptides and finally into amino acids. 
Velmanase alfa exhibited an approximately linear (i.e. first-order) pharmacokinetic profile, and Cmax 
and AUC increased approximately proportionally to the dose with doses ranging from 0.8 to 1.6 mg/Kg 
(corresponding to 25 and 50 U/Kg). The steady state volume of distribution was low (0.27 L/Kg), 
indicating distribution confined to plasma. Cmax appeared to increase proportionally with the dose up 
to 100 U/kg, except from the lowest 6.25 U/kg, where dose-normalized Cmax was up to 50% lower as 
compared to other doses. This partly could be explained by the fact that subjects in this dose group 
received only 80% of the planned dose. 
The  clearance  from  plasma  (mean  6.7  mL/h/Kg)  is  consistent  with  a  rapid  cellular  uptake  of  the 
velmanase alfa via mannose receptors. At steady state, velmanase alfa clearance normalised by body 
weight  in  paediatric  patients  was  higher  than  clearance  in  adult  patients.  However,  the  observed 
difference  could  be  due  to  a  small  number  of  subjects,  since  in  popPK  analysis  age  was  not  a 
significant covariate. 
After the end of the infusion, velmanase alfa plasma concentrations fell in a biphasic fashion with a 
mean terminal elimination half-life of about 30 hours. 
The mean intra-individual variability in AUCinf and C max (the mean of all individual CV%) was 30% and 
24%,  respectively.  The  inter-individual  variability  in  AUCinf  and  Cmax  (CV%)  was  33%  and  20%, 
respectively. 
Due to the expected degradation of velmanase alfa into small peptides and amino acids, studies in 
hepatic impairment are not considered necessary. In addition, proteins larger than 50.000 Da, as 
velmanase alfa, are not eliminated renally. The lack of studies in patients with renal impairment is thus 
justified. Pharmacokinetic data in elderly is not considered necessary as no patients older than 41 
years are described across Europe. Furthermore, due to nature of the product, no interactions at 
CYP450 level or other drug-drug interactions are expected. 
The PK properties of velmanase alfa after intravenous administration were described by an 
allometrically scaled two-compartment model with first-order elimination. Due to the scarcity of data, 
only a limited number of covariates (body weight, height, age, dose and study) were available for 
investigation. 
The predicted concentrations were highly correlated to the observed concentrations, with a slope of 
approximately 1, demonstrating the adequacy of the population fit. Likewise, residuals were uniformly 
distributed with time and concentrations with no obvious bias. 
Neither age nor sex, were statistically significant covariates of CL and V1in the final model, once body 
weight was added to the model.  
Velmanase alfa is an ERT aiming to replace the deficient alpha-mannosidase enzyme in patients with 
alpha-mannosidosis. A reduction in serum oligosaccharides (discussed in detail in the clinical efficacy 
section of this report) is indicative of intracellular lysosomal activity of velmanase alfa, which is 
reduced/lacking in alpha-mannosidosis patients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 45/109 
 
 
 
 
 
No secondary pharmacologic effects were investigated by the applicant. As no potential off-target or 
unintentional effects of velmanase alfa are foreseen the lack of secondary pharmacology studies is 
acceptable. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The clinical pharmacology of velmanase alfa is considered to have been adequately characterised from 
the submitted data and no additional measures are considered necessary. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response studies 
Two dose response studies were conducted in the same population (rhLAMAN-02 and RhLAMAN-03 
(patients from study 2 rolled over into study 3). 
Study rhLAMAN-02, was a single center, open-label, dose escalation study of the safety and 
pharmacokinetics (PK) of velmanase alfa for the treatment of patients with alpha-mannosidosis. 
Study, rhLAMAN-03, was a single center, randomized, open-label, multiple-dose study of the efficacy 
and long-term safety of velmanase alfa for the treatment of patients with alpha-mannosidosis. 
Participants were included in these studies after a diagnosis of alpha-mannosidosis, which was 
confirmed by alpha-mannosidase activity < 10% of normal activity in blood leukocytes. Patients were 
between ≥ 5 year and ≤ 20 years of age at screening. 
In Study rhLAMAN-02, two patients were allocated to each of the following groups: Group 1: 6.25 
U/kg, Group 2: 12.5 U/kg and group 3: 25 U/kg, group 4: 50 U/kg and group 5: 100 U/kg body 
weight. Treatment was assigned by stratification. Following evaluation of baseline assessments, all 10 
patients were stratified based on what was considered of primary importance; sex and age, to obtain 
homogenous pairs in each group. The pairs of patients were to be randomized to dose with the 
restriction that both the youngest and the oldest should be represented in one of the high dose groups. 
After a single infusion in study rhLAMAN-02, Cmax was proportional to dose with an estimated 
proportionality factor for Cmax versus dose of 1.03 (CI: 0.86 to 1.21). For AUC, the estimate of 
exposure-dose proportionality was a factor of 1.42 (CI: 1.19 to 1.64).  
In study rhLAMAN-03, the dose levels randomised were in blocks in the rhLAMAN-03 randomization, 
i.e. one patient from each dose level in study rhLAMAN-02 was randomized to 25 U/kg and 50 U/kg 
respectively. The demographic and baseline characteristics of the patients included in study rhLAMAN-
03 are summarised in Table 10.

2.5.2.  Main studies 
Study rhLAMAN-05: A multi-centre, double-blind, randomized, placebo controlled, parallel group 
trial, investigating the efficacy and safety of repeated velmanase alfa treatment of subjects with alpha-
mannosidosis. 
Methods 
The trial consisted of a screening visit (visit -1), a baseline visit (visit 0, prior to first dose) in order to 
evaluate inclusion/exclusion criteria and to perform the baseline procedures, a first dose visit (visit 1), 
up to 55 dose visits, a midterm evaluation after 26 weeks (visit 26a) and an end evaluation after 52 
weeks (visit 52a). An additional last EOT visit was performed at week 56 (visit 56). 
A midterm evaluation was done at week 26 for demonstration on efficacy evaluation of the 3MSCT and 
serum oligosaccharide values. A statistical significant improvement for 3MSCT of p≤ 0.05 (two-sided) 
and p≤ 0.025 (two-sided) for serum oligosaccharide reduction was considered for the midterm 
analyses. 
In case of statistical improvement the Placebo group would be shifted to active treatment and the 
remainder of the trial would be for safety evaluation only, otherwise the blinded trial continued until 
end evaluation after 52 weeks (visit 52a), where positive effect was defined as a trend in the efficacy 
endpoints and statistical significant (p≤ 0.025) serum oligosaccharide reduction. The trend was defined 
as an improvement in the mean value of 3MSCT for active compound compared to Placebo. Since no a 
statistical significant change emerged at the midterm evaluation (week 26), the trial continued as 
blinded until the final evaluation after 52 weeks (visit 52a).

Sample size 
A total of 26 patients were screened in the rhLAMAN-05 trial. There was one screening failure due to 
level of IgE not compatible with exclusion criteria. Twenty five (25) patients were enrolled in the study. 
No formal estimation of sample size was performed for the trial. 
Randomisation 
Randomization, in a 3:2 ratio, into active or placebo group was stratified on age and was used to 
allocate the patients into blocks. Within the blocks, a standard randomization into active and placebo 
was performed. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Placebo and active drug infusions were visually and physiological 
indistinguishable. 
Statistical methods 
Primary and prioritized secondary efficacy variables 
The primary analysis on the two primary endpoints (serum oligosaccharides and 3MSCT) and two 
prioritized secondary endpoints (6MWT and FVC [in %]) was performed on the relative change from 
baseline to week 52. Data were log-transformed and then submitted to an analysis of covariance 
(ANCOVA) with treatment as fixed factor, corresponding baseline values and age as continuous 
covariates. The adjusted means in each treatment group, the adjusted mean difference between 
velmanase alfa and placebo, their 95% CIs and associated p-values were estimated by the model. 
The following sensitivity analyses were performed to check the robustness of the results: 
• 
• 
• 
The primary model with absolute change from baseline to week 52 
The primary model with the relative change from baseline to week 26 using log-
transformation.  
The primary with model the absolute change from baseline to week 26.  
A responder analysis was also undertaken, where a responder was defined as follows: 
• 
• 
for serum oligosaccharides a percentage reduction ≥70%. 
for 3MSCT, 6MWT and FVC (%) a percentage increase ≥ 10%. 
Demonstration of efficacy was defined as: 
•  a statistically significant improvement in the two primary endpoints (under significance levels 
of 0.025 and 0.05, respectively) at the interim analysis; 
or 
•  a statistically significant reduction in serum oligosaccharides (under a significance level of 
0.025) and a trend for improvement in the 3MSCT and one of the prioritized secondary 
endpoints at the 52 week analysis.

Study rhLAMAN-10: A single center, open label clinical trial investigating the long-term efficacy of 
rhLAMAN-(recombinant human alpha-mannosidase or Lamazym) treatment in subjects with alpha-
mannosidosis who previously participated in Lamazym trials. 
Methods 
Patients included had all previously been treated with Lamazym in the phase 1, 2a, 2b or phase 3 trials 
(rhLAMAN-02, rhLAMAN-03, rhLAMAN-04 and rhLAMAN-05). All patients were receiving weekly 
intravenous infusions of Lamazym according to the AfterCare Program.  
Patients attended a Screening visit (Visit 0) on Day 1, at which eligibility was checked and informed 
consent was signed. After consent was obtained, patients attended an evaluation visit (also on Day 1), 
at which they underwent pre-infusion evaluations, and then received their infusion of investigational 
medicinal product (IMP). This infusion was the weekly infusion for that week as part of the AfterCare 
program in which they were already enrolled, and was the same dose in mg/kg body weight as usually 
administered according to the local treatment in the AfterCare Program. Further evaluations were then 
carried out over Days 1-6. An End of Trial (EOT) visit was held on Day 6 after the evaluations had been 
completed and before the patient left the trial site. 
Study Participants  
Inclusion criteria 
• 
• 
• 
• 
The patient must have had participated in the previously conducted phase 1, 2a, 2b or 3 trials 
with recombinant human alpha-mannosidase; 
The patient had to still be receiving weekly intravenous infusions of velmanase alfa according 
to the AfterCare Program; 
The patient or patients legally authorized guardian (s) had to provide signed, informed consent 
prior to performing any trial-related activities; 
The patient and his/her guardian (s) had to have the ability to comply with the protocol. 
Inclusion Criterion number 2 was evaluated according to a patient-specific clinical report produced by 
the local site of treatment. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 59/109 
 
 
 
 
 
Exclusion criteria 
•  History of BMT 
• 
Presence of known clinically significant cardiovascular, hepatic, pulmonary or renal disease or 
other medical conditions that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would have precluded 
participation in the trial. Patients unable to perform the motor tests independently from 
support were permitted to participate in the trial and were to be evaluated for the remnant non 
motor endpoints; 
•  Any other medical condition or serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating circumstance that, in 
the opinion of the investigator, would have precluded participation in the trial; 
• 
• 
• 
Pregnant and/or lactating women could not participate in the trial. Concerning women of child 
bearing potential, the investigators decided whether or not there was a need for contraception. 
This assessment was done through interviews with the patient and parents; 
Participation in other interventional trials testing IMP, including rhLAMAN-07 and rhLAMAN-09  
trials with velmanase alfa; 
Pause of the IMP for 2 consecutive weeks during the last month. Patients were allowed to be 
re-screened. 
Exclusion Criterion number 6 was evaluated according to a patient-specific clinical report produced by 
the local site of treatment. 
Treatments 
Each patient was to receive weekly a single dose of velmanase alfa at a dose of 1mg/kg body weight 
intravenously. The infusion duration was calculated individually from the maximum infusion rate of 45 
mL/hour to control the protein load, though infusion duration was to be a minimum of 50 minutes. 
Objectives 
The primary objective of the trial was to evaluate the impact of the long-term treatment with 
velmanase alfa in patients with alpha-mannosidosis upon the level of biomarker oligosaccharides in 
serum and upon the endurance as measured by the change from Baseline in the number of steps 
climbed in 3 minutes. 
As secondary objectives, the long term efficacy of velmanase alfa was investigated upon endurance as 
measured by the change from Baseline in the number of meters walked in six minutes (6MWT), upon 
pulmonary function, motor proficiency by BOT-2 and hearing capability by audiometry.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
Efficacy

Sample size 
No formal calculation of sample size was performed for this trial. The total number of patients 
represents the available patients from the previous AfterCare program. Up to 20 patients were 
expected to be enrolled in this trial. Patients enrolled in this trial were pooled with those currently 
enrolled in the rhLAMAN-07 protocol (n=7) and the rhLAMAN-09 protocol (n=8). Thus up to 34 
patients were expected to be included in the analysis.

Other endpoints: Childhood health assessment questionnaire (CHAQ) 
Disability Index (DI) 
The mean (SD) Disability Index (score) at baseline was 1.36 (0.77). There was a decrease in the CHAQ 
Disability Index from Baseline to the last observation, but this change was not statistically significant: 
the mean (SD) CHAQ Disability Index score at the last observation was 1.23 (0.66), representing a 
mean (SD) absolute change from Baseline of -0.13 (0.44) and a mean (SD) percentage change of -
2.41% (45.03%). 
Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) Pain 
At Baseline the mean (SD) CHAQ pain VAS score was 0.618 (0.731). There was no statistically 
significant absolute or percentage change from Baseline at any time point or at last observation. At last 
observation the mean (SD) CHAQ Pain VAS score was 0.431 (0.616), representing a mean (SD) 
change from Baseline of -0.173 (0.647) and a mean (SD percentage change from Baseline of -17.0% 
(109.8%).  
CHAQ general VAS 
At Baseline the mean (SD) CHAQ general VAS score was 1.049 (0.770). There were no statistically 
significant absolute or percentage changes from Baseline at any time point or at last observation. At 
last observation the mean (SD) CHAQ general VAS score was 0.952 (0.723), representing a mean (SD) 
change from Baseline of -0.068 (0.621). 
Subgroups by ADA Immune Response 
A conservative approach was taken to classify patients as ADA positive (i.e. including patients who 
were ADA positive at any time, including pre-treatment, and setting a relatively low threshold of 1.4 
U/mL to determine ADA status). With this definition, 8/33 patients were considered to be ADA positive 
for at least one time point on-treatment and at least one further confirmatory positive result was 
present in 6 of these patients. In 2 patients the titre level of ADAs was >80 U/mL (with a maximum 
value of 1012 U/mL in one patient and remaining very low (<30 U/mL) in the remnant patients. No 
clear differences were seen between patients who were ADA negative throughout the study, and those 
who became ADA positive at some point during the study in any of the efficacy endpoints evaluated by 
ADA status (serum oligosaccharides, 3MSCT and 6MWT [m and % predicted]. 
Ancillary analyses 
To address the evaluation of the clinical relevance of the observed changes, the Applicant defined a 
Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MID) threshold for each efficacy variable and organized the 
overall set of variables into clusters based on their similarity (i.e. their belonging to homogeneous 
functional domains). 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 67/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  MIDs  for  the  clinical  endpoints  tested  in  the  velmanase  alfa  development  trial  have  not  been 
previously  defined  for  alpha-mannosidosis.  As  a  consequence,  the  Applicant  decided  to  import  MIDs 
used in diseases with similar characteristics. 
In  order  to  address  this  issue,  the  Applicant  conducted  an  extensive  review  of  the  literature  and 
consulted  with  experts  in  the  field.  The  key  guiding  element  in  the  definition  of  proxies  was  the 
similarity  with  other  rare  diseases,  and  in  particular  lysosomal  storage  disorders  with  limitation  in 
mobility, as well as the age range during which these diseases manifest. 
Table 27 summarises the MID threshold identified for the key efficacy variables serum 
oligosaccharide, 6MWT, 3MSCT, FCV, CHAQ-DI, and CHAQ-VAS.

Clinical studies in special populations 
No studies in special populations were submitted.  
Supportive studies 
Studies rhLAMAN-02, -03, -05, -07 and -09 were part of the integrated analysis (rhLAMAN-10) 
described above.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
In all submitted velmanase alfa clinical studies, alpha-mannosidosis was defined for study eligibility as 
alpha-mannosidase activity <10% of normal activity in blood leukocytes. Patients were all over the age 
of 5 at screening. Furthermore patients should have been able to physically and mentally cooperate in 
the tests. In all clinical studies, patients with a history of BMT were excluded as were patients who 
could not walk without aids or who had psychosis.  
Therefore only patients with mild to moderate disease burden were evaluated. The most severely 
affected young patients were not included in the submitted studies. The mean age at the first dose of 
active treatment of the 33 patients included in the rhLAMAN-10 integrated analysis was 17.1 years, 
and the median was 15 years (range: 6 to 35 years).  
In the dose-escalation study (Study rhLAMAN-02), pairs of patients were randomized to 6.25, 12.5, 
25, 50, or 100 U/kg iv velmanase alfa. All 10 patients included in rhLAMAN-02 were enrolled in study 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 77/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
rhLAMAN-03 and randomised in a 1:1 ratio to receive weekly iv infusions of 25 U/kg or 50 U/kg 
velmanase alfa. The 9 patients who completed the study were then enrolled in Study rhLAMAN-04 to 
evaluate 1 mg/kg iv velmanase alfa, the intended clinical dose.  
In study rhLAMAN-05, 25 naïve patients were randomized to treatment or placebo in a 3:2 ratio and 
were randomly allocated to active treatment of 1 mg/kg iv or placebo. Using this design and sequence 
of studies the applicant efficiently used the very limited number of patients available to gain some 
information on dose finding. Combining these limited data with those obtained from the non-clinical 
studies the choice of 1 mg/kg (25 IU/kg) given as a weekly infusion is well justified.  
Study rhLAMAN-05 was a placebo controlled study which provides information on the efficacy 
compared to a placebo. For this is a double blind randomised design this study is the only source of 
information between treated and untreated patients with a comparable burden of disease. The 
integrated analysis (rhLAMAN-10) lacks the direct comparison but provides efficacy data for over 4 
years.  
The applicant used many endpoints ranging from pharmacodynamic (oligosaccharides in serum, urine 
and CSF), endurance (6MWT and 3MSCT), lung function (FVC, FEV1 and PEF), hearing, motor 
development (BOT-2), psychological development (Leiter-R) and quality of live (CHAQ and EQ-5D-5L). 
All endpoint are relevant for the disease and changes compared to placebo could be assessed in the 
rhLAMAN-05 study.  
At the request of the CHMP and to support the assessment of the overall effect, the applicant 
performed a post-hoc responder analysis. Endpoints were grouped into three domains, identified as 
pharmacodynamic (serum oligosaccharide response), functional (3MSCT, 6MWT and FVC% predicted) 
and quality of life (CHAQ disability index and CHAQ VAS pain). 
The Minimal Important Differences (MIDs) for the functional domain have not been previously defined 
for alpha-mannosidosis. To define MIDs the applicant conducted an extensive literature review and 
consulted with experts. 
For the FVC% predicted the proposed MID by the applicant was accepted. A MID for the 6MWT is more 
difficult to define as major differences in MID for various conditions using this endpoint have been 
reported. For the CHAQ disability index and CHAQ VAS pain scores the only available information is 
from one publication. For the 3MSCT no publications evaluating the MID were submitted as the 
applicant failed to identify relevant publications.  
Given the limited information available on the matter, the CHMP considered the definitions of MID 
proposed by the applicant in this very rare condition acceptable. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The biological activity of velmanase alfa was confirmed in study rhLAMAN-5, by the significant 
difference between groups in clearing serum oligosaccharides. The adjusted mean relative change (%) 
in serum oligosaccharides from baseline to week 52 was -77.60 (95% CI: -81.58, -72.76) in the 
velmanase alfa group and -24.14 (95% CI: -40.31, -3.59) in the placebo group. The adjusted mean 
difference for velmanase alfa vs placebo was -70.47 (95% CI: -78.35, -59.72) showing a statistically 
significant difference between the two groups (p<0.001) in favour of the velmanase alfa group. 
With respect to the 3MSCT as primary endpoint, the treatment with velmanase alfa 1 mg/kg i.v. once 
weekly resulted in a modest improvement in the 3MSCT in the overall population of alpha-
mannosidosis patients. The adjusted mean relative change (%) from baseline to week 52 was -1.07 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 78/109 
 
 
 
 
 
(95% CI: -9.05, -7.61) in the velmanase alfa group and –3.97 (95% CI: -13.38, 6.47) in the placebo 
group. The adjusted mean difference in the 3MSCT for velmanase alfa vs placebo was 3.01 (95% CI: -
9.86, 17.72). Although a numerical improvement was observed the comparison between the two 
groups was not statistically significant (p=0.648).  
Numerical improvement of endurance was also captured in the 6MWT. The adjusted mean relative 
change (%) from baseline to week 52 was 0.64 (95% CI: -4.74, 6.32) in the velmanase alfa group and 
-1.20 (95% CI: -7.63, 5.68) in the placebo group. The adjusted mean difference for velmanase alfa vs 
placebo was 1.86 (95% CI: -6.63, 11.12). The comparison between the two groups was not 
statistically significant (p=0.664).  
For the FVC (% of predicted) the adjusted mean relative change (%) from baseline to week 52 was 
10.11 (95% CI: 1.31, 19.67) in the velmanase alfa group and 1.58 (95% CI: -9.48, 13.99) in the 
placebo group. The adjusted mean difference for velmanase alfa vs placebo was 8.40 (95% CI: -6.06, 
25.08). The comparison between the two groups was not statistically significant (p=0.269). 
Overall, the endpoints with the highest clinical relevance did not show a statistical significant change 
compared to placebo but only a numerical improvement over placebo (2 to 8%) in the year of 
observation. The small but consistent improvement observed suggests that velmanase alfa may slow 
down the existing disease progression. This is further supported by the fact that patients included in 
the study did not deteriorate as would have been expected given the natural history of the disease. It 
is therefore likely that a one year observation is too limited to expect differences between treated and 
untreated patients for the endpoints investigated. The Expert Advisory Group which was consulted for 
this application (see below, Additional expert consultation)  also considered that trials of longer 
duration than the timeframe of the placebo-controlled study would be required to establish the true 
magnitude of effect of velmanase alfa, especially in adult patients. However, the CHMP acknowledged 
that such trials could not realistically be expected in this very rare condition. 
In a post-hoc analysis conducted by the applicant, age appeared as the most critical prognostic 
parameter for a response in motor function (3MSCT) results. Numerical improved responses were also 
observed in the youngest treated patients across multiple domains (Peripheral Nervous System by 
BOT2, respiratory tests with pronounced improvement in FVC as % of predicted, data not shown) 
which suggest that the clinical benefits of velmanase alfa might be more clinically pronounced if 
administered to younger patients under 6 years old which were not included in the clinical trial.  
The Expert Group which was convened to discuss this application also stressed that clinical benefits of 
velmanase treatment could be expected, regardless of the age of the patient. The Group however, 
acknowledged that the available data does not allow for the use of the product in the most severely 
affected patients with skeletal abnormalities, and obvious progression, leading to an early death from 
primary CNS involvement or myopathy.  
Based on the definition of the MCID, the applicant submitted responder analyses for the various 
endpoints as well as a multi-parametric responder analysis. The responder analysis of rhLAMAN-05 
showed a discernible treatment difference between the two groups, with a clinical response in at least 
two domains at 12 months observed in 87% of patients treated with velmanase alfa compared to 30% 
treated with placebo. Moreover, 13% of the velmanase alpha treated patients but none of the placebo 
patients reported a clinically significant response in all three domains. 
In the integrated overview study (rh-LAMAN-10), results demonstrated an acute effect on the serum 
oligosaccharides which was maintained for the duration of the trial. At baseline, mean (SD) serum 
oligosaccharides were 6.90 (2.30) μmol/L. There was a statistically significant decrease in serum 
oligosaccharides from Baseline to the last observation: mean (SD) serum oligosaccharide levels at the 
Assessment report

last observation were 2.31 (2.19) μmol/L, representing a mean (SD) absolute change from Baseline of 
-4.59 (3.23) μmol/L, and a mean (SD) percentage change from baseline of -62.8% (33.61%) 
(p<0.001 for both absolute and percentage changes from Baseline).  
In addition there was a statistically significant improvement in both the 3MSCT (6.4 steps/minute), the 
6MWT (22.4 metres) as well as in predicted FVC. This supports the notion that to observe clinical 
meaningful effects, exposure to velmanase alfa, longer than the study period of rhLAMAN-05 would be 
required.  
In the post-hoc responder analysis at 12 months, 79% of patients showed a significant response in at 
least two domains, and 24% in all three. The proportion increases at Last Observation with a important 
response in at least two domains achieved in 88% patients (100% of paediatric patients and 71% of 
adult patients) and in all three domains in 45% patients (53% of paediatric patients and 36% of adult 
patients). 
There were no statistically significant changes in any CHAQ endpoint (CHAQ Disability Index, CHAQ 
pain VAS and CHAQ general VAS) from Baseline to any time point or to the last observation. The mean 
changes from Baseline in the CHAQ Disability Index did not reach the minimal clinically important 
improvement of 0.13 at the last observation in the patients.  
In both rhLAMAN-05 and rhLAMAN-10 velmanase alfa treatment had limited or no impact on CSF 
oligosaccharides, CSF proteins or cognitive function. These results are not unexpected as velmanase 
alfa does not appear to cross the BBB in humans.  This is of significant clinical importance as a high 
proportion of patients with Alpha-mannosidosis have intellectual impairment (approximately 85% of 
those participating in rhLAMAN-05 had diagnosis of mental retardation at baseline). As a result the 
CHMP considered that the lack of an effect on the neurological manifestations of the diseases should be 
explicitly stated in the approved indication for Lamzede.  
The CHMP considering the totality of the data and the comments raised by the Expert Group concluded 
that it would not be appropriate to restrict the population that could be treated with velmanase alfa to 
patients above 6 years old as was initially proposed by the applicant.  The CHMP noted that all 
available data indicate that patients most likely to benefit the most are younger patients. Therefore, it 
is important that treatment is to be initiated as early as possible in patients with the mild to moderate 
form after manifestation of the symptoms of the disease in order to prevent damage from prolonged 
accumulation of polysaccharides in the various tissues.  
Additional expert consultation 
An Ad-Hoc Expert Advisory Group was asked to provide their view on the following issues: 
1.      How do you judge the clinical relevance of the observed effects of velmanase alfa on 
the pharmacodynamic and functional outcomes in patients with alpha-mannosidosis? 
The  expert  group  noted  the  significant  effect  of  velmanase-alpha  on  the  serum  concentration  of 
oligosaccharides  and  highlighted  that  a  pharmacodynamic  effect  in  the  context  of  an  enzyme 
replacement therapy was an absolute requirement to demonstrate efficacy. However, the expert group 
noted  that  such  a  response  would  not  be  sufficient  to  predict  any  clinical  benefit  of  treatment  with 
velmanase alfa.  
The  expert  group  also  noted  that  the  results  for  the  functional  outcomes  did  not  reach  statistical 
significance but suggested some effect of the active treatment compared to placebo. Interpretation of 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 80/109 
 
 
 
 
 
the true clinical relevance of these results is difficult, due to both the rarity, the heterogeneity of the 
disease as well as the variability of the chosen outcome parameters. 
The  expert  group  considered  that  based  on  the  results  from  rhLAMAN-05,  only  a  sub-population  of 
patients  with  alpha-mannosidosis  would  probably  benefit  from  treatment  with  velmanase  alfa. 
Identifying these patients however would be challenging, and is discussed further in the responses to 
Questions 2 and 3 below. 
The  expert  group  finally  noted  the  absence  of  any  meaningful  effect  on  the  endpoints  used  to 
determine the impact of velmanase treatment on the Central Nervous System, which is expected since 
velmanase alfa does not cross the Blood Brain Barrier. 
2.  Can  the  expected  clinical  benefits  of  velmanase  alfa  be  extrapolated  to  patients  with 
alpha-mannosidosis, not included in the clinical trial programme? For instance, can the 
experts  give  their  views  on  the  role  of  velmanase  alfa  in  the  very  young  patients  with 
the  most  severe  manifestations,  asymptomatic  patients  or  those  with  very  mild 
symptoms or late onset of disease? 
As noted above, it is difficult to ascertain which patients are the ones most likely to benefit the most 
from  velmanase  alfa  treatment.  The  expert  group  noted  that  younger  patients,  under  the  age  of  18 
that were included in the trial seemed to benefit the most. Nevertheless, the expert group by majority 
considered  that  based  on  the  observed  results,  it  would  be  reasonable  to  expect  clinical  benefits  in 
very  young  patients  (i.e. below 6  years  of  age)  with  mild  or  moderate  manifestations  of  the  disease. 
Some  concerns  were  raised  about  extrapolating  to  such  patients,  mainly  as  safety  in  that  population 
has not been investigated. The expert group agreed that further data would be required, for the very 
young patients with severe (type 1) phenotype.  
For adult patients, the expert group considered that velmanase treatment could be of benefit only for 
some  of  them,  but  in  the  absence  of  data  on  the  natural  disease  course  in  adults,  caution  should  be 
taken  with  initiation  of  therapy.  Studies  of  longer  duration  (2-3  years)  in  larger  groups  of  patients 
would  probably  be  required  to  determine  the  magnitude  of  effect  in  those  patients.    The  group 
suggested  to  initiate  treatment  in  adults  only  in  those  with  potentially  reversible  signs  or  symptoms, 
i.e. excluding skeletal or neurological/psychiatric disease as a sole criterion to start therapy. They also 
noted that they were not aware of any adult patients where central nervous system involvement was 
not  a  prominent  feature  and  this  would  limit  any  potential  benefits  of  velmanase  treatment  in  this 
population. 
3.  Within  the  different  sub-types  of  alpha-mannosidosis,  are  there  patients  you  would 
expect  to  benefit  more  than  others  from  velmanase  alfa  treatment?  Are  there  any 
disease  related  or  prognostics  factors  that  can  be  helpful  to  decide  which  patients 
should be treated or not treated? 
Available data do not allow for clear identification of patients that would benefit the most. The expert 
group considered that, according to the mechanism of action of the medicine and the pathophysiology 
of the disease, the earlier treatment starts the higher the benefit to be expected. However it was also 
noted  that  there  are  no  prognostic  factors  which  could  help  determine  which  patients  would  respond 
better to treatment.  
The  expert  group  also  recommended  that  the  effects  of  treatment  with  velmanase  should  be 
periodically  evaluated  and  discontinuation  of  treatment  considered  in  cases  where  no  clear  benefits 
could be observed.

4.      Given the rarity of the disease and the limited data available, further information in 
the post-marketing setting, most likely in the form of a registry, would be important. 
What would be the most relevant efficacy and safety outcome data for a disease 
registry to further evaluate the effects of velmanase alfa? 
The expert group highlighted the importance of establishing a disease registry to collect further data in 
this rare disease setting. The expert group considered that preferably such a registry should be directly 
under the governance of the clinicians treating the patients that would be included in the registry.  
In  terms  of  data  collection,  emphasis  should  be  given  Patient  Reported  Outcomes  as  well  as  Mental 
Health Scales, as for example those relevant for psychosis, which is a known complication in patients 
with alpha mannosidosis. Additional data on infections and antibiotic use would be relevant as well. It 
would  also  be  important  to  collect  information  on  antibodies  in  treated  patients  to  characterise  any 
potential effect they may have on effectiveness over long term treatment. 
Additional efficacy data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that the data set on 
the clinical efficacy of Lamzede under normal conditions of use could not be considered comprehensive 
as for a number of clinical endpoints only a numerical improvement was shown for Lamzede over 
placebo but this was not confirmed from a statistical view point.  
The CHMP noted that it is not feasible to generate a comprehensive data set due to the rarity of the 
disease which reduces dramatically the availability of the subjects for the conduct of the trials but also 
the variability in clinical symptoms of the condition which means that there is no disease specific 
validated clinically relevant endpoint. In addition, due to the nature of the disease it is reasonable to 
expect that in order to demonstrate statistically compelling effects, clinical trials of longer duration 
would be required. Such placebo-controlled trials are not considered feasible due to ethical 
considerations.  
The CHMP was therefore of the view that a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
should be granted subject to a number of obligations, including a disease registry in order to evaluate 
the long-term effectiveness of treatment with Lamzede under conditions of routine clinical care. Data 
collection from this registry will also enable further characterisation of the alpha mannosidosis 
population with regards to the variability of clinical manifestation and disease progression. 
In addition, the results of an ongoing open label 24 month study will be submitted in order to provide 
further confirmation of efficacy in children ≤ 6 years which were not included in the Lamzede clinical 
trial programme.   
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
A clear pharmacodynamic effect (decrease of serum oligosaccharides), has been demonstrated for 
velmanase alfa from the data submitted in patients with alpha-mannosidosis.  For most of the clinical 
endpoints consistent numerical differences were also shown in the randomised clinical trial, however 
the observation period of 1 year is not considered sufficient to fully characterise the magnitude of 
change in the various endpoints in this condition and in which disease progression can be slow.  
Additional evidence of efficacy was provided from the integrated analysis of all the clinical studies 
conducted with velmanase alfa. In a post-hoc, multi-parametric responder analysis a large majority of 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 82/109 
 
 
 
 
 
patients showed a significant response in two of the three investigated domains (pharmacodynamic, 
functional and Quality of Life). Additional analyses revealed that the youngest patients were the ones 
most likely to benefit from treatment. 
Therefore, it was concluded that velmanase alfa is an effective treatment option for patients with alpha 
mannosidosis. 
However, the CHMP considered that the available data set on the clinical efficacy was not 
comprehensive and that the following measures would be necessary to generate additional efficacy 
data in the context of a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances: 
•  An alpha-mannosidosis disease registry, to evaluate long tem effectiveness of treatment with 
velmanase alfa 
•  An open label study to further characterise the efficacy in patients from birth to < 6 years of 
age. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
The safety data submitted in support of the use of velmanase alfa in patients with alpha mannosidosis 
is combined from a number of different sources as outlined below: 
1) Patients treated with CHF-LMZYMAA1 who completed the dose-ranging studies (rhLAMAN-02, 03 
and 04) and who were: 
a) exposed for ~4 years and were monitored in the follow-up studies (rhLAMAN-07 or 09) giving 
~4 years of exposure with continuous safety data records or 
b) treated in the compassionate use programme with only standard expedited reporting giving ~4 
years of exposure with ~2 years of continuous safety data records and a follow-up visit in 
rhLAMAN-10. 
2) Patients initially treated with CHF-LMZYMAA1 in the placebo-controlled study (rhLAMAN-05) and 
who were: 
a) monitored in the follow-up studies (rhLAMAN-07 or 09) giving ~2 years of continuous safety 
data records or 
b) treated in the compassionate use programme with only standard expedited reporting giving ~2 
years of exposure with ~1 year of continuous safety data records and a follow-up visit in 
rhLAMAN-10. 
3) Patients initially treated with Placebo in rhLAMAN-05 study who then received CHFLMZYMAA1 and 
who were: 
a) monitored in the follow-up studies (rhLAMAN-07 or 09) giving ~1 year of continuous safety 
data records or 
b) treated in the compassionate use programme with only standard expedited reporting giving ~1 
year of exposure with Baseline data pre-treatment and a single follow-up visit in rhLAMAN-10.

Patient exposure 
Overall, thirty-three (33) patients have received treatment with velmanase alfa during clinical studies. 
Exposure data from patients who were treated with velmanase alfa in the compassionate use 
programme (18 patients) were also included in the SAS. Therefore, approximately one third of patients 
(9 patients (27.3%) had been exposed to velmanase alfa up to 48 months. However, during the 
compassionate use programme only spontaneous reports were collected.  
Duration of exposure periods for all patients included in the SAS are detailed in  
Table 31.

Adverse events 
An overall summary of Treatment Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), by age group is presented in 
Table 32.

analysis set 
Serious treatment related TEAEs (related events: Defintely, possible or probable according to

Dose finding studies 
In the dose-ranging studies a total of 239 TEAEs were reported by the 10 patients during the 
rhLAMAN-02 and -03 trials and by the remaining 9 patients in the rhLAMAN-04 trial. The most 
frequently reported TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (35 events in 10 patients), excoriation (14 events in 4 
patients), headache (13 events in 6 patients), pyrexia (9 events in 6 patients), arthralgia (9 events in 
4 patients), contusion (8 events in 5 patients) and weight increased (7 events in 6 patients). The 
majority of TEAEs were mild (207 events in 10 patients) or moderate (31 events in 8 patients). One 
(1) patient reported 1 severe AE (loss of consciousness), which was also an SAE. 
rhLAMAN -05 study 
In the placebo controlled rhLAMAN-05 study, a total of 270 TEAEs were reported by 24 patients: 157 
events in the velmanase alfa group and 113 events in the placebo group. The most frequently reported 
TEAEs were nasopharyngitis (30 events in 10/15 patients of the velmanase alfa group and 16 events in 
7/10 patients of the placebo group), pyrexia (11 events in 6/15 patients of the velmanase alfa group 
and 11 events in 5/10 patients of the placebo group) and headache (7 events in 5/15 patients of the 
velmanase alfa group and 9 events in 3/10 patients of the placebo group). All related TEAEs were of 
mild and moderate intensity: 27 events were mild (20 in 5/15 patients of the velmanase alfa group 
and 7 in 4/10 patients of the placebo group) while 12 events were moderate (10 in 4/15 patients of 
the velmanase alfa group and 2 in 1/10 patient of the placebo group). 
rhLAMAN-010 study 
In the pooled safety analysis set (SAS), 546 TEAEs were reported in 29 (87.9%) patients (Table 33).

In the Compassionate use programme only one serious event of infection was spontaneously reported. 
Serious TEAEs were considered to be related to treatment in 2 patients: 
One case of Loss of Consciousness (severe, possibly related, resolved)  
A patient allocated to 6.25 U/kg, 50 U/kg and 1 mg/kg of velmanase alfa in the rhLAMAN- 02, -03 and 
-04 trials, respectively. 14 months after start of treatment and 7.8 days after last dose administration 
had difficulties in breathing, and his mother found the patient unconscious in his bed with stiffness of 
the body (tonic seizure).

The patient gained consciousness within 2-3 minutes and was brought to the hospital by ambulance, 
where he was treated with i.v. saline and glucose infusions. All examinations were normal, and he 
recovered completely after 6.5 hours and was discharged from the hospital with no further follow-up. 
The patient was subsequently examined by the local doctor/hospital and no clinically significant 
observations were made. The patient continued in the trial with no change in dose level. The 
investigator assessed this severe and serious loss of consciousness to be possibly related to trial drug.  
One case of Acute renal failure (moderate, possibly related, resolved)  
The patients experienced a serious ADR of acute renal failure 291 days after start of treatment. 
The event, which occurred in the context of long-term therapy with Ibuprofen, 600mg BID, was 
moderate in intensity, led to an interruption of study treatment for 4 weeks, and subsequently resolved 
after a duration of 92 days.  
Immunological events 
Serum samples for antidrug antibody (ADA) testing were collected at baseline and every 2 weeks 
(Study rhLAMAN-02), every 4 weeks (Studies rhLAMAN-03, -04, and 05), or every 12 weeks (studies 
rhLAMAN-07 and -09); a single sample was also collected for patients in the compassionate use 
programme enrolled in rhLAMAN-10 at the CEV. Although antibody data were collected through the 
ongoing Studies rhLAMAN-07 and 09, data were only extracted for the CEV used in the integrated 
analysis in rhLAMAN-10. Anti-velmanase alfa IgG was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
assay, and samples from the seropositive patients were then tested for the presence of inhibitory 
antibodies. 
Overall, 11 of the 34 patients included in the development program had positive titres for anti-drug 
antibodies (ADA) (≥1.4U/mL) at any time during the study, however 5 of these were detected during 
placebo treatment and a further 3 were present at baseline before treatment with velmanase alfa. No 
on-treatment data is available for one of these patients.  
Of the remaining ten, 6 patients were confirmed as ADA+ under treatment, but only 4 patients were 
ADA+ at the last on-treatment assessment, and in one of these the titre at endpoint was lower than 
the titre at baseline. 
There were only 2 ADA+ patients with titres recorded above 80 U/mL and these were also the only 
ADA+ patients to report IRR. Narratives for these patients are provided in subparagraph Infusion 
Related Reactions . The remaining patients had titres <30 U/mL. 
A summary of ADA status by time point and age group is presented in Table 35. 
Serum oligosacharride levels increased above baseline in three patients, but in each patient this was at 
a single visit. For the first patient, serum oligosacharides were 8.2 µmol/L at screening, 5.6 µmol/L 
during placebo treatment and 5.1 µmol/L at baseline for the integrated analysis. This patient was 
assessed on-treatment only at the CEV. At the CEV the patient was ADA-, serum oligosacharides were 
5.8 µmol/L pre-infusion dropping to 1.2 µmol/L at 5 days.  
The second patient was ADA- at baseline, recorded a single low positive titre of 1.7U/L during placebo 
treatment, but was ADA- again at the baseline for the integrated analysis. Serum oligosacharides were 
4.5 µmol/L at screening 4.5 µmol/L during placebo treatment and 4.8 µmol/L at baseline. This patient

assessed on-treatment only at the CEV. At the CEV the patient was ADA+ (24U/L), Serum 
oligosacharides were 5.5 µmol/L pre-infusion dropping to 1.3 µmol/L at 72 hours.

a “overall” includes Baseline. One patient was ADA positive at Baseline, but not on-treatment. Another 
patient had ADA measurements ≥1.4 U/mL during placebo treatment and the patient was therefore 
considered as ADA+ in the Listings. However, after the first dose of velmanase alfa the patient only 
had ADA measurements <1.4 and therefore is considered ADA negative in this table. One patient who 
was excluded from the FAS due to no on-treatment data, was also ADA+ at baseline. 
1. Data from Study rhLAMAN 03 are not summarised for one patient who was also positive for ADA in 
this earlier study, and therefore overall during a longer treatment exposure than reported in the

Serum oligosacharides levels increased above baseline in three patients, but in each patient this was at 
a single visit. For the first patient, serum oligosacharides were 8.2 µmol/L at screening, 5.6 µmol/L 
during placebo treatment and 5.1 µmol/L at baseline for the integrated analysis. This patient was 
assessed on-treatment only at the CEV. At the CEV the patient was ADA-, serum oligosacharides were 
5.8 µmol/L pre-infusion dropping to 1.2 µmol/L at 5 days.  
The second patient was ADA- at baseline, recorded a single low positive titre of 1.7U/L during placebo 
treatment, but was ADA- again at the baseline for the integrated analysis. Serum oligosacharides were 
4.5 µmol/L at screening 4.5 µmol/L during placebo treatment and 4.8 µmol/L at baseline. This patient 
assessed on-treatment only at the CEV. At the CEV the patient was ADA+ (24U/L), Serum 
oligosacharides were were 5.5 µmol/L pre-infusion dropping to 1.3 µmol/L at 72 hours. 
The third patient also experienced an infusion related reaction and showed no quantifiable velmanase 
alfa plasma levels during the CEV. At the previous assessment, ADA was below 250 U/mL, while at the 
CEV, ADA increased to 1012 U/mL. 
Infusion Related Reactions  
Infusion related reactions (IRRs) were defined as those ADRs which occurred during or up to two hours 
after the infusion of velmanase alfa and that were assessed by the investigator as being infusion 
related.  
The IRR encountered during clinical development concern 3 paediatric patients with the majority of 
events experienced by one patient. Most of the IRR (11/19 events) involved disturbances of 
temperature homeostasis. The IRR did not involve any of the body systems leading to concerns 
regarding anaphylaxis. There were no respiratory symptoms, and no rashes associated with IRR.  
Amongst the 3 patients who had IRR reported, one was ADA negative throughout the study, and 
experienced an IRR of mild pyrexia during the first infusion (100 U/kg) only. The other two patients 
had IRR with a consistent pattern of onset - more than 1 month after initiation of treatment; 
seroconversion - neither were ADA+ prior to first infusion; increased ADA titres (above 80 U/mL); 
management by premedication and reductions in infusion speed and with appropriate premedication, 
ADA titres reduced with time and, in the longer term, management measures could be reduced or 
stopped. 
The 3 patients with IRR were all paediatric patients initially treated in the dose-ranging studies and 
occurred in 3/10 of those patients. In the 14 treatment-naïve patients who received velmanase alfa 
during Study rhLAMAN-05 no IRRs were observed during the course of the study. No IRR were 
reported in any of the 10 patients originally under placebo treatment who received their first infusion 
of velmanase alfa during Studies rhLAMAN-07, or -09, or during the Compassionate use programme. 
Hypersensitivity  
In the clinical development programme of velmanase alfa, there were 9 reports of hypersensitivity 
(Preferred term) in 4 patients out of 33 patients. These were considered non-serious ADRs. 
Medication Errors  
Medication errors (human-error or device-related) have been identified as an Important Potential Risk 
for this product in common with other enzyme replacement therapies. During the clinical development 
programme, errors in administration of volume of investigational product were reported as minor 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 92/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
protocol deviations. These medication errors consisted of a lower or higher dose administered 
compared to the dose as planned in the protocol. No medication errors were recorded as having clinical 
sequelae and none were considered overdoses. 
Laboratory findings 
Haematology 
In the pooled safety population, severe abnormalities in haematological parameters occurred in only 
2 patients (6.1%, all neutropenia). Both patients were aged <18 years old, and neither abnormality 
was reported as a TEAE. Mild to moderate abnormalities in haematological parameters were reported 
(in order of descending frequency) for leukocytes in 14 patients (42.4%), neutrophils in 11 patients 
(33.3%), haemoglobin in 10 patients (30.3%), platelets in 8 patients (24.2%) and lymphocytes in 6 
patients (18.2%).  
Abnormalities in haemoglobin were reported in a similar frequency of patients aged <18 years and 
≥18 years old. All other parameters had a higher proportion of abnormalities reported in patients <18 
years old; abnormalities in lymphocytes and leukocytes were only reported in patients <18 years old.  
Biochemistry 
In the pooled safety population, severe abnormalities in biochemistry parameters occurred in 3 
patients (9.1%) who had hyperphosphatemia in the context of polyarthritis. None of these 
abnormalities were reported as TEAEs by the investigators. Mild to moderate decreases in biochemistry 
parameters were reported (in order of descending frequency) for albumin in 10 patients (30.3%), 
phosphate and sodium both in 6 patients (18.2%) and potassium in 3 patients (9.1%). Mild to 
moderate increases in biochemistry parameters were reported (in order of descending frequency) for 
alkaline phosphatase in 13 patients (39.4%), sodium in 12 patients (36.4%), potassium in 9 patients 
(27.3%), creatinine and bilirubin both in 6 patients (18.2%), ALT in 5 patients (15.2%), amylase in 
4 patients (12.1%) and creatinine kinase in 1 patient (3.0%).  
Abnormalities in biochemistry parameters tended to be reported in a higher proportion of patients aged 
<18 years than aged ≥18 years, with the exception of ALT and potassium, where the incidence was 
similar for both age groups. 
Coagulation 
Coagulation CTC abnormalities reported in the pooled safety population were all mild to moderate 
increases in prothrombin INR, which occurred in one third of patients (11 patients, 33.3%), with a 
similar incidence in patients aged <18 years and those aged ≥18 years.

eosinophils, glucose, IgG, lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, erythrocytes and leukocytes. 
Urinalysis 
In the dose-ranging studies, 1 patient reported positive leukocytes in urine. Another patient reported 
positive leukocytes, protein and nitrite in urine. Neither event was considered related to treatment. 
Otherwise, no clinically significant abnormal laboratory values were seen during the trials.  
Safety in special populations 
Safety in patients with renal or hepatic impairment has not been evaluated, due to the rarity of the 
disease. Safety has not been evaluated in patients with cardiac impairment. 
No data are available and no relevant use in elderly is described, due to the rarity of the disease. No 
patients older than 41 years have been described across Europe (rhLAMAN-01: The natural history of 
alpha-Mannosidosis). 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No PD drug interaction studies were performed as these are not anticipated based on the structure of 
the drug substance (recombinant human glycoprotein). 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
One patient in rhLAMAN-03 was reported as having a mild anaphylactoid reaction but this period was 
excluded from the pooled analysis.  
This patient was only included in the pooled analyses from the Baseline of Study rhLAMAN-05. This 
patient dosed at 25 U/kg was withdrawn from Study rhLAMAN-03 following a long term interruption of 
treatment due to repeated IRR (mild, treatment-related, anaphylactoid reaction) and the patient’s 
desire not to receive premedication. The patient was later enrolled in Study rhLAMAN-05, dosed at 1 
mg/kg, and tolerated further IRR managed by reduction in infusion rates and pre-medications. No 
other TEAEs led to discontinuation. 
Post marketing experience 
No Marketing Authorisation is currently available for velmanase alfa. However, a Compassionate use 
programme is ongoing. As of May 2016, 18 patients in the compassionate use programme are still 
under treatment. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
In the integrated study rhLAMAN-10, patients from study rhLAMAN-07 protocol (n=7), rhLAMAN-09 
protocol (n=8), and the compassionate use program (n=19) were included. The parental studies, for 
patients and data included in the FAS, was rhLAMAN-02 for 9 (all paediatric) patients (27.3%) and 
rhLAMAN-05 for 24 patients (72.7%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 94/109 
 
 
 
 
 
In study rhLAMAN-02 the 9 paediatric patients received short term velmanase alfa as result of dose 
finding. In rhLAMAN-05, 15 patients (45.5%) received the proposed dose of 1 mg/kg and 9 patients 
(27.3%) first received placebo treatment for 12 months.  
In the pooled studies reported in rhLAMAN-10, all 33 patients were exposed to velmanase alfa for at 
least 12 months. It should also be noted that data during this period were not recorded systematically 
for patients in the compassionate use program. Over half the subjects (19/33 subjects 57.6%) were 
exposed for 24 months or more.   
In the pooled safety analysis set (integrated study rhLAMAN-010), 546 TEAEs were reported in 29/33 
(87.9%) patients. In patients <18 years 423 events were reported compared to patients aged ≥18 
years for whom 123 events were reported. This might be contributed the longer exposure in the 
patients <18 years, especially those (n=9) of study rhLAMAN-02. It should be noted that overall 
similar frequencies for TEAEs are reported between both age-groups, 89.5% versus 85.7%.  
The most frequently affected SOCs were Infections and Infestations (in 24 patients, 72.7%), 
Gastrointestinal Disorders (21 patients, 63.6%), Musculoskeletal and Connective Tissue Disorders (18 
patients, 54.5%) and General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (17 patients, 51.5%).   
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. 
In study rhLAMAN-10, serious TEAEs were reported in a similar proportion of patients aged <18 years 
(7 patients, 36.8%) and aged ≥18 years (5 patients, 35.7%) and no preferred term was reported as 
serious in more than one patient. Serious TEAEs were considered to be ADRs in 2 patients: loss of 
consciousness and acute renal failure.  Both of these adverse events are included in the RMP as 
important potential risks and in Section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Three of 33 patients (9.1%) reported IRR’s and it was concluded that these events were related to 
velmanase alfa administration. Overall, there were approximately 2800 velmanase alfa infusions in the 
clinical trials included in the integrated analyses, with approximately 2000 of these in paediatric 
patients. Thus only 1 in 147 infusions overall, or 1 in 105 infusions in children, led to an IRR.  
IRRs are included in the RMP as an important identified risk and information is provided in the product 
information regarding the management of IRRs, which should be based on the severity of the reaction. 
In addition the patient is recommended to remain under observation for IRRs for one hour or longer 
after the infusion, according to the treating physician’s judgement.  
Overall,  11  of  the  34  patients  included  in  the  development  program  had  positive  titres  for  anti-drug 
antibodies  (ADA)  (≥1.4U/mL)  at  any  time  during  the  study. Three  of  these  patients  were  detected 
positive at baseline before treatment with velmanase alfa. The CHMP noted the relatively low threshold 
of  1.4  U/mL  was  established  to  determine  ADA  positive  status  to  ensure  that  all  positive 
immunogenicity  samples  would  be  identified,  although  it  also  increased  the  possibility  of  identifying 
false  positives.  However,  the  applicant  has  developed  a  new  analytical  method  for  detecting  ADAs, 
which  has  been  shown  to  be  more  accurate  and  allows  for  more  precise  results  and  less  intra-  and 
inter  variability  between  samples.  The  new  bioanalytical  method  will  be  used  for  new  patient 
assessments. 
No clear correlation was found between antibody titres (velmanase alfa IgG antibody level) and 
reduction in efficacy or occurrence of anaphylaxis or other hypersensitivity reactions. Nevertheless, 
immunogenicity is included in the RMP as an important identified risks and the product information 
states that, in instances of development of severe IRRs or lack or loss of treatment effect, patients 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 95/109 
 
 
 
 
 
should be tested for the presence of anti velmanase alfa antibodies. In case the patient’s condition 
deteriorates during ERT, cessation of treatment should be considered. 
There were 9 report of hypersensitivity reactions reported. All were considered as non-serious ADRs, 
however, as with any intravenous protein product, allergic-type hypersensitivity reactions are possible. 
Therefore, hypersensitivity is included in the RMP as an important identified risk, and the product 
information stipulates that appropriate medical support should be readily available when velmanase 
alfa is administered. If a severe allergic or anaphylactic-type reaction occurs, immediate 
discontinuation of velmanase alfa is recommended and current medical standards for emergency 
treatment should be followed. 
Safety in patients with renal, hepatic or cardiac impairment were not evaluated, due to the rarity of the 
disease. Therefore, use of velmanase alfa in those patients is included in the RMP as missing 
information.   
No data are available in elderly and no relevant use is described, due to the rarity of the disease. 
Although currently no patients older than 41 years are described across Europe it is to be expected 
that with the advancement in the understanding and management of the disease older patients can be 
anticipated in the future. Therefore this population is also included in the RMP as missing information. 
As children aged 0 to 6 years were not included in the clinical trials submitted, safety information in 
this population is lacking, even though it is expected that the safety profile in these patients would be 
in line with that of the older patients. Additional safety information in these patients will be collected 
through the disease registry but also through Study rhLAMAN-8, which will exclusively enrol patients 
within that age range. 
No interaction studies were performed. Velmanase alfa is a recombinant protein product and is unlikely 
to affect cytochrome P450 related metabolism. 
There are no data from the use of velmanase alfa in pregnant women. This has been added as missing 
information in the RMP. 
No overdose was reported during the clinical studies. Some medication errors were reported, though 
these were not associated with any clinically important effects. However, further rinformation will be 
collected on  medication erros through the activities described in the RMP in which it has been 
classified as an important potential risk. 
Additional expert consultations 
See discussion on clinical efficacy. 
Additional safety data needed in the context of a MA under exceptional 
circumstances 
Taking into account the totality of the available data, the CHMP was of the view that the data set on 
the clinical safety of Lamzede under normal conditions of use could not be considered comprehensive 
due to the small size of the clinical trials and the limited duration of follow-up for a life-long condition 
with highly variable clinical manifestations and disease progression rates.  
The CHMP acknowledged that the rarity of the disease and ethical considerations prevent the conduct 
of bigger and of longer duration controlled trials.  
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 96/109 
 
 
 
 
 
The CHMP was therefore of the view that a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
should be granted subject to specific obligations, including the implementation of the alpha 
mannosidosis disease registry to evaluate the long term safety profile of Lamzede and in particular 
with regards to the important identified an potential risks associated with velmanase alfa use.  
Additional safety information for patients below 6 years of age will also be collected through an 
ongoing open label study. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
Despite the limited size of the safety database, due to the rarity of alpha-mannosidosis, the overall 
safety profile of velmanase alfa is considered acceptable. The main safety concerns identified are of 
infusion related reactions, immunogenicity and hypersensitivity which are addressed adequately 
through appropriate routine risk minimisation measures.  
The CHMP considers the following measures necessary to address the missing safety data in the 
context of a MA under exceptional circumstances: 
•  The Alpha-Mannosidosis disease registry to evaluate the long-term safety profile of 
Lamzede, especially in relation to IRR, immunogenicity hypersensitivity, loss of 
consciousness, acute renal failure and medication errors  
• 
rhLAMAN-8 ( 2) an open label, 24 month study to characterise the pharmacokinetics and 
safety of Lamzede in patients from birth to < 6 years

Conclusion 
The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 05.1 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  pharmacovigilance  system  summary  submitted  by  the  applicant  fulfils 
the requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion.  
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that velmanase alfa has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product 
in the European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers velmanase alfa to be a new active substance as it is 
not a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on 
the readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Lamzede (velmanase alfa) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as: 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any 
medicinal product authorised in the EU; 
• 
It is approved under exceptional circumstances [REG Art 14(8), DIR Art (22)] 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that 
this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of 
new safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
Alpha-mannosidosis is a rare monogenic autosomal recessive disorder, consisting of a deficiency of 
lysosomal alpha-mannosidase. The effect of the enzyme deficiency is blockage of the degradation of 
glycoproteins, which results in the accumulation of mannose rich oligosaccharides in all tissues. 
Progressive lysosomal accumulation of non-degradable metabolites results in generalized cell and 
tissue dysfunction and multi-systemic pathologies.  
Based on the clinical presentation 3 sub-types for alpha-mannosidosis have been described (Malm et 
al., 2008):  
• 
• 
• 
a severe form with early death from central nervous system involvement or infection (type 3). 
a moderate form, clinically recognized at childhood (prior the age of 10 years), with myopathy, 
slow progression, and skeletal abnormalities (type 2). 
a mild form clinically recognized during adolescence or late in life (after the age of 10 years), 
with myopathy, slow progression, and absence of skeletal abnormalities. In Europe, no patients 
over the age of 50 years are known (type 1). 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Currently there is no available treatment for alpha-mannosidosis. The most severe patients are 
potential candidates for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) or bone marrow 
transplantation.  
The less severe alpha-mannosidosis patients are managed with supportive care including symptom 
management, medical and surgical treatment of complications (e.g. infections, skeletal deformities), 
and physical therapy. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The patients included in the pivotal studies represent a subpopulation of alpha-mannosidosis patients 
with a mild to moderate disease burden (type 1 and type 2 alpha mannosidosis). The younger patients 
with a higher disease burden, fast progression and the highest medical need are not included, neither 
are the older patients with a very mild disease burden.  
At baseline the patients included showed a 20% reduction of endurance and lung function as compared 
to their healthy peers. The cognitive development for the children (<18 years) is about 6 years behind 
compared to the healthy peers. 
In Study rhLAMAN-05, 25 treatment naïve patients were randomized to active treatment or placebo in 
a 3:2 ratio. 
The integrated analysis (rhLAMAN-10) includes all patients (N=33) from previous finalised studies 
(rhLAMAN-02, -03, -05, -05, 07 and -09) and the patients included in the compassionated use

program. This is an open label analysis with no comparator. The integrated analysis provides efficacy 
data for over 4.5 years for some patients.  
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Comparison with placebo (rhLAMAN-05) 
The adjusted mean absolute change in serum oligosaccharides (μmol/l) from baseline to week 52 was -
5.11 (95% CI: - 5.66, -4.56) in the velmanase alfa group and -1.61 (95% CI: -2.28, -0.94) in the 
placebo group. The adjusted mean difference for velmanase alfa vs placebo was -3.50 (95% CI: -4.37; 
-2.62) showing a statistically significant difference between the two groups (p< 0.001). 
The adjusted mean absolute change in the 3MSCT (steps/min) from baseline to week 52 was 0.46 
(95% CI: - 3.58, 4.50) in the velmanase alfa group and -2.16 (95% CI: -7.12, 2.80) in the placebo 
group. The adjusted mean difference for velmanase alfa vs placebo was 2.62 (95% CI: -3.81, 9.05, 
p=0.406) indicating a numerical improvement for the active treated patients.  
Some numerical improvement of endurance was captured in the 6MWT. The adjusted mean difference 
for velmanase alfa vs placebo was 7.35 m (95% CI: -30.76; 45.46, p=0.692). 
For the mean absolute change in FVC (% of predicted) the adjusted mean difference for velmanase 
alfa vs Placebo was 8.21 (95% CI: 1.79, 14.63) indicating an improvement in the actively treated 
population. The comparison between the two groups was not statistically significant (p=0.269).  
A post-hoc analysis was performed on serum IgG (g/l). The adjusted mean difference for active arm vs 
Placebo arm was 3.47 (95%CI: 2.12, 4.81) showing a statistically significant difference between the 
two groups (p<0.001) in favour of velmanase alfa.  
Based on the definition of the MCID as proposed by the applicant, the responder analysis of rhLAMAN-
05 showed a discernible treatment difference between the two groups, with a clinical response in at 
least two domains at 12 months observed in 87% of patients treated with velmanase alfa compared to 
30% treated with placebo. Moreover, 13% of the velmanase alpha treated patients but none of the 
placebo patients reported a clinically significant response in all three domains. 
Integrated analysis (rhLAMAN-10) 
There was an absolute decrease of -4.59 µmol/l in serum oligosaccharides from Baseline to the last 
observation (p<0.001). 
There was an improvement in 3MSCT from Baseline to the last observation (absolute change of 
6.4 steps/ min, p≤0.004). 
There was an absolute increase in 6MWT from Baseline to the last observation of 22.4 (63.2) m 
(p=0.050). There was an increase in the percentage of predicted FVC from Baseline to the last 
observation of 8.1% (14.8%) (p=0.007).  
For absolute FVC, FEV1 (percentage of predicted and absolute), PEF, BOT-2 total point, score Leiter-R 
total equivalent age, and hearing, a non-significant increase to last observation was demonstrated. 
No clear changes were reported for CHAQ and EQ-5D-5L Health Index and VAS.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Although the inclusion of 33 patients in the clinical development programme is acceptable given the 
rarity of the condition, the number is still limited especially when considering the wide range of 
phenotypes that patients can have. 
Even though the results of the placebo controlled study show a consistent numerical improvement for 
most of the clinical endpoints, statistical significance was not established. There are a number of 
potential explanations for this, including the relatively short duration of the trial which is probably not 
sufficient to demonstrate a statistically compelling effect. 
With regard to effects on CNS, in the clinical studies CSF oligosaccharides, tau proteins, NFL and GFAp 
and any of the MRI or MRS endpoints included both increases and decreases with no clear trend for a 
change over time in any parameter. Moreover, the clinical data suggests that velmanase does not pass 
the blood brain barrier and thus no direct effect on the neurological manifestations of the disease are 
to be expected and this is explicitly stated in the indication of the product. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Patients treated with velmanase alfa showed similar frequencies in AEs as those in the placebo-group. 
All related TEAEs were of mild and moderate intensity. The most frequently reported TEAEs were 
pyrexia and headache. For the nervous system disorders, despite similar reported frequencies for 
headache and dizziness, syncope was reported in two patients in the velmanase alfa arm and not 
reported in the placebo arm.  
Two cases of serious TEAEs were reported, e.g. syncope and acute renal failure. One case of the 
reported of loss of consciousness was actually part of a tonic seizure episode. Acute renal failure was 
considered treatment related. 
In the integrated study rhLAMAN-010, TEAEs were reported in a similar proportion of patients aged 
<18 years and aged ≥ 18 years. No preferred term was reported in more than one patient. 
Three of 33 patients (9.1%) reported infusion related reactions (IRR’s). All three were paediatric 
patients. Eleven of 34 patients were anti-drug antibody positive (ADA positive) sometime during 
treatment.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The safety data presented in the dossier were based upon the last data lock point 27 September 2015. 
Only 9 patients had follow-up data of 4 years or more. Twenty-three patients had follow-up data of two 
years or more.  
The safety in children aged 0 to 6 years is not known, as such patients were not included in the clinical 
studies. The safety profile of velmanase alfa in these patients with mild or moderate disease burden 
however is expected to be in line with the population included in the studies however additional 
information will be collected through the ongoing and planned open label studies and the disease 
registry as described in the RMP. The safety in patients diagnosed with a severe form is not known and 
cannot be extrapolated form the information from patients with mild to moderate disease forms. 
Assessment report  
EMA/205473/2018  
Page 104/109 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The safety in patients with renal, hepatic or cardiac impairment and pregnant women has not been 
evaluated. Use of velmanase alfa in these sub-populations is included in the RMP as missing 
information.  
Three patients were ADA positive pre-treatment and 5 patients in the placebo group were ADA 
positive. Immunogenicity is included in the RMP as an important identified risk, and further information 
on the impact of ADAs on the effectiveness and safety of velmanase alfa is expected to be collected 
through the disease registry.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A clear pharmacodynamic effect was demonstrated, which indicates uptake of the enzyme in the 
lysosome and also enzyme activity. It can therefore be expected that velmanase alfa has the potential 
to arrest disease. Given the results of the natural history study some clinically relevant effects can only 
be expected after more than 2 years of treatment. 
Compared to placebo a small numerical improvement in the most important clinical endpoints (3MSCT, 
6MWT, predicted FVC, predicted FEV1, absolute FVC, absolute FEV1 and PEF) could be demonstrated., 
however, given the results of the natural history study some clinically relevant effects can only be 
expected after more than 2 years of treatment.

In the overall analysis the results of the endurance tests (3MSCT and 6MWT) and the lung function 
tests (predicted FVC, predicted FEV1, absolute FVC, absolute FEV1 and PEF) also showed some 
numerical improvement compared to baseline. Further clinical benefit is suggested by the post-hoc 
responder analysis based on MCID.  
Although statistically compelling evidence is lacking for the clinical endpoints, the data suggests some 
further improvement or stabilisation of disease progression under continued treatment with velmanase 
alfa. The proposed long-term disease registry study (including untreated patients and patients treated 
with velmanase alfa or other treatments) will collect additional efficacy and safety data which to 
further confirm the positive trend in beneficial effects as observed in the studies. 
Most adverse events reported during the clinical development programme of velmanase alfa appear to 
be mild and transient in nature. As expected, infusion related reactions were observed in patients 
receiving treatment. Adequate safety warnings to minimise this risk are included in the product 
information, and further data to better characterise the magnitude and the frequency of this risk can 
be expected through the alpha-mannosidosis registry. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
In the placebo controlled study a pharmacodynamic effect in terms of a decrease of serum 
oligosaccharides, has been demonstrated. Despite the slow disease progression in the placebo-treated 
patients and the natural history study and the short observation period most of the differences in 
endpoints compared to placebo showed a numerical improvement in favour of the velmanase alfa 
treated patients and therefore support efficacy of velmanase alfa.  
In the placebo-controlled study, the younger group of patients showed a more pronounced 
improvement after 12 months of treatment when compared to the group of patients above 18 years. 
This finding is confirmed by the post-hoc responder analysis. Therefore, the lower age-limit of 6 years 
in the indication as initially proposed by the applicant has been replaced by a restriction to patients 
with mild to moderate disease. It is expected that the benefits of velmanase alfa can be fully 
extrapolated to patients below age 6 years as long as they do not suffer from the most severe type of 
alfa-mannosidosis that progresses rapidly, also with regard to neurological deterioration that is unlikely 
to be treatable by the drug.  
The observed marginal improvement in older patients is thought to be related to irreversible damage 
resulting from prolonged disease activity that cannot be reversed by the drug. Nevertheless, disease 
stabilisation is considered beneficial in these older patients.  
Velmanase alfa does not appear to cross the blood-brain-barrier, as illustrated by the lack of effect 
reported for the pharmacodynamic CNS related endpoints and the lack of effect on hearing loss and 
ataxia. Therefore, a direct effect on the neurological manifestations of alpha-mannosidosis deficiency is 
not expected. Hence, the indication is restricted to “Long-term enzyme replacement therapy for the 
treatment of non-neurological manifestations in patients with mild to moderate alpha-mannosidosis”.  
From the integrated analyses, there was also a numerically improvement for most endpoints compared 
to baseline. Some clinical effect is also suggested by the post-hoc responder analysis based on MCID. 
The proposed long-term disease registry study will collect more efficacy and safety data to further 
confirm the positive trend in beneficial effects as observed in the studies. 
The overall safety profile of velmanase alfa does not raise any particular concerns. In common with 
other enzyme replacement therapies, infusion related reactions were reported but it is expected that in 
clinical practice these can be easily managed.

Only two serious TEAEs were observed (acute renal failure, syncope (loss of consciousness)). Both are 
included in the RMP, as important potential risks, and further information to confirm a causal 
association with velmanase alfa treatment will be collected through the disease registry. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances 
As comprehensive data on the product are not available, a marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances was requested by the applicant in the initial submission. 
The CHMP agreed that due to the very rare nature of the disease but also the rather slow disease 
progression in mild to moderate alpha mannosidosis which does not allow for more data to be 
generated within a reasonable time frame. The CHMP considers that the applicant has sufficiently 
demonstrated that it is not possible to provide comprehensive data on the efficacy and safety under 
normal conditions of use, because the applied indication is encountered so rarely that the applicant 
cannot reasonably be expected to provide comprehensive evidence. 
Therefore, recommending a marketing authorisation under exceptional circumstances is considered 
appropriate subject to the following specific obligations: 
• 
• 
In order to collect additional information on the long term effectiveness and safety of 
treatment with velmanase alfa and to further characterise the entire alpha-mannosidosis 
population, including variability of clinical manifestation, progression and natural history, the 
applicant is required to set up an alpha-mannosidosis disease registry; 
In order to investigate the safety and efficacy of velmanase alfa  treatment in paediatric 
patients  <6 years of age with alpha-mannosidosis the applicant is required to submit the 
results of a 24-month open label study. 
Data from the disease registry should be generated on a regular basis for review in the context of the 
annual re-assessments 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Lamzede is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Lamzede is favourable in the following indication: 
treatment of non-neurological manifestations in patients with mild to moderate alpha-mannosidosis. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation under exceptional 
circumstances subject to the following conditions:

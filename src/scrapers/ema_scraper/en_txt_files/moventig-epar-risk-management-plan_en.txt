Brief description of the 
product 
Indication(s) 
Chemical class: Peripherally acting  mu-opioid 
receptor antagonist (PAMORA). Naloxegol is a 
PEGylated derivative of the mu-opioid receptor 
antagonist naloxone 
Summary of mode of action: PEGylation reduces 
naloxegol’s passive permeability and also renders the 
compound a substrate for the P glycoprotein (P-gp) 
transporter. Due to poorer permeability and increased 
efflux of naloxegol across the blood-brain barrier 
(BBB), related to P-gp substrate properties, the central 
nervous system (CNS) penetration of naloxegol is 
minimal. 
Current: Naloxegol is indicated for the treatment of 
Opioid-Induced Constipation (OIC) in adult patients 
who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s) 
Dosage 
Current:  25 mg once daily oral route.

PART II: SAFETY SPECIFICATION 
PART II: Module SI – Epidemiology of the indication and target population 
2.1.1 
Opioid-induced constipation (OIC) 
2.1.1.1 
Incidence 
Currently, there is limited observational data estimating the incidence of OIC. The 
observational study data that are available were derived from three studies 
conducted within a United Kingdom (UK) or United States (US) electronic 
healthcare database. Results reported from electronic healthcare database study are 
of limited value with respects to estimating incidence of OIC. Specifically, 
diagnosis codes specific to OIC are either non-existent or rarely used given the 
underlying purpose of the database (e.g., billing reimbursement in the United 
States). 
Consistent estimates of OIC incidence were not observed in externally reported 
clinical trials. Incidence estimates across trials ranged from 0.7% to 51.7% and 
differed as much as 4% to 26% within a trial. (See Wirz et al 2008, Wallace et al 
2009, Flogegard and Ljungman 2003, Ruoff et al 2003, Caldwell et al 2002, Payne 
et al 2001, Goldblum 2000, Hale et al 2009, Hartrick et al 2009, Karlsson and 
Berggren 2009, Perrot et al 2006, Gilron et al 2005, Likar et al 2006). The recently 
published European expert consensus statement which focused on the 
pathophysiology and management of opioid-induced constipation reported that OIC 
occurs in 51-87% of patients receiving opioids for cancer and between 41-57% 
patients receiving opioids for chronic non-cancer pain (Farmer et al, 2018). 
2.1.1.2  Prevalence 
Identifying a consistent estimate is more challenging given methodological 
differences across population-based studies. Definition of constipation, data source 
and type of opioid are just a few of the differences that may impact the estimates. 
Population heterogeneity is another factor that may impact the prevalence estimates 
of OIC. For example, cancer patients tend to suffer from constipation, regardless of 
pain management due to metabolic changes, dehydration and/or decreased mobility 
(Pappagallo 2001).  The inconsistency between estimates are highlighted in a 
review where the authors evaluated 16 studies, clinical trials and observational, to 
report a range of OIC prevalence between 15-95% within the given study 
population (Boswell et al 2010).  Given these challenges, estimates for prevalence 
of OIC should be qualified according to the population of interest. US-based 
observational studies estimate the prevalence of OIC in non-cancer pain patients to 
range between 17-57% (Brown et al 2006, Mahowald et al 2005, Cook et al 2008). 
An elevated prevalence of OIC (60-95%) as well as regional inconsistency was 
observed for cancer pain, as reported by European- and US-based observational 
9 of 96 
 
 
 
 
 
studies (Boswell et al 2010, Droney et al 2008, Lundorff et al 2008, Braiteh et al 
2007, Sykes 1998, Meuser et al 2001). Cancer populations are more likely to be 
exposed to morphine than other opioids (Pergolizzi et al 2008, Salvato et al 2003), 
which may partially contribute to the higher constipation rates observed in these 
studies. Within the ranges reported by underlying disease, prevalence may differ by 
type of opioid and frequency of opioid use. This additional level of heterogeneity 
was demonstrated in a population-based survey conducted among 2055 adults 
taking chronic opioids for pain management of non-cancerous conditions where a 
prevalence of 67% was reported in patients utilizing morphine and 17% to 34% for 
patients treated with other opioids (oxycodone, codeine, hydrocodone, 
propoxyphene, tramadol) (Cook et al 2008). Finally, heterogeneity in prevalence 
estimates can be observed within opioid use patterns where a prevalence study 
conducted among patients with chronic non-cancer pain reported constipation 
related to chronic daily opioid use in 39% of patients versus 27% among patients on 
intermittent opioid use (p=0.05) (Brown et al 2006). 
2.1.1.3  Demographics of the population in the authorised indication and risk factors 
for the disease 
Two US administrative claims-based observational studies of patients utilizing 
opioids chronically for non-cancer pain provide some insight into the demographic 
profile from which OIC patients originate. One study described patients in a 
privately and publicly insured population where both populations were mostly 
female (private=59%, public=72%) with an average of 50 and 53 years, respectively 
(Braden et al 2008). Similar demographic characteristics (63% female, average age 
of 57 years) were reported among privately insured patients dispensed opioids for 
≥180 days per year (Cicero et al 2009). Survey based studies in the US provided 
additional demographic detail of chronic opioid users. The majority of patients 
using opioids “at least several times a week for a month or more” are female 
(60.9%), white (87.8%), aged 30-45 years (37.1%), married (66.9%), and have 
received a maximum of a high school diploma (67.3%) (Hudson et al 2008). 
Separate AstraZeneca-initiated UK and German electronic healthcare database 
studies among adult patients (≥18 years of age) utilizing chronic opioids (≥183 days 
of continuous use) reported the study populations to be mostly female (>67%) with 
a median age of 66 and 76, respectively (internal data). 
Given the condition, OIC, is a side-effect of opioid exposure, risk factors in this 
case must be a component of the opioid exposure. Specifically, type of opioid, 
dosing frequency, and route of administration are risk factors for opioid-induced 
constipation. A population-based survey conducted among 2,055 adults taking 
chronic opioids for pain management of non-cancerous conditions reported a 
prevalence of 67% in patients utilizing morphine and 17% to 34% for patients 
10 of 96 
 
 
 
 
treated with other opioids (oxycodone, codeine, hydrocodone, propoxyphene, 
tramadol). In addition, a prevalence study conducted among patients with chronic 
non-cancer pain reported constipation related to chronic daily opioid use in 39% of 
patients versus 27% among patients on intermittent opioid use (p=0.05) (Brown et 
al 2006). Oral administration may be associated with a higher risk of developing 
OIC. Oral administration appears to cause more constipation than intravenous, 
intramuscular, epidural, subcutaneous or transdermal administration, which are 
broadly equivalent (Hanks et al 2001). Several studies have shown that the risk of 
OIC was higher with oral morphine compared with transdermal fentanyl (p<0.001). 
(See Allan et al 2001, Ahmedzai and Brooks 1997, Hanks et al 2001, Staats et al 
2004, Tassinari et al 2008, Donner et al 1996.) 
2.1.1.4  The main existing treatment options 
The recently published “Pathophysiology and management of opioid-induced 
constipation: European expert consensus statement”, is the first evidence-based 
guideline for managing OIC.  The guidelines recommend that a step-wise approach 
is used in the management of OIC.  When a patient reports constipation, the first 
step would be to address lifestyle aspects, in order to assess if there are alternative 
reasons for the constipation such as psychological aspects, inactivity, concomitant 
medications or metabolic abnormalities. Standard laxatives such as osmotic agents 
and stimulants are good first-line choices in the next step of the management of 
OIC. If laxatives are ineffective and the constipation is clearly related to 
commencing, escalating or a switch in opioids, then an opioid-receptor antagonist 
would be the next step as these are known to alleviate the adverse effects of opioids. 
Several opioid antagonists with local action within the gut or peripherally-acting 
mu-opioid receptor antagonists (PAMORAs), such as naloxegol, have become 
available, and these have been shown to be safe and effective in treating OIC. 
Another generally accepted approach to management of constipation is as follows 
(World Gastroenterology Organisation 2010, Leppert 2010, Thomas and Cooney 
2008): 1) Non-pharmacologic treatment strategies include increasing fluid intake, 
dietary fibre, or exercise; 2) Pharmacologic treatment strategies that do not involve 
altering the current opioid regimen for pain management which include the use of 
over-the-counter laxatives (stool softeners, stimulant laxatives, osmotic laxatives or 
bulk-forming laxatives); 3) Prescription treatments, such as opioid-receptor 
antagonists which target the underlying cause of opioid-induced constipation, 
lubiprostone which activates chloride channels to promote fluid secretion into the 
intestinal lumen, or plecanatide, a guanylate cyclase-C agonist can be used in the 
event the ‘desired result’ is not achieved with other therapeutic options. If oral 
laxatives are found to be ineffective, rectal measures may be introduced. In 
11 of 96 
 
 
 
 
emergency situations, medical procedures such as bowel disimpaction in a hospital 
setting can be utilized to resolve constipation. 
Given that traditional laxatives do not target μ-opioid receptors, evidence from 
observational studies suggests that traditional laxatives are insufficient to prevent or 
alleviate the symptoms of OIC for many patients (Brock et al 2012). The PROBE 1 
survey of patients taking oral opioids and laxatives in the US and EU (n=322) 
reported that, despite these patients taking laxatives, the majority (81%) of patients 
were still experiencing constipation, 45% reported <3 bowel movements per week, 
and 58% reported straining (Bell et al 2009). A separate US-based survey of opioid 
treated patients reported laxative therapy to be sub-optimal with 46% of patients not 
achieving the desired treatment outcome >50% of the time (Pappagallo 2001). 
2.1.1.5  Natural history of the indicated condition in the untreated population, 
including mortality and morbidity 
In some patients, OIC may become so severe and distressful that patient may taper 
or even discontinue opioid use in an attempt to relieve their discomfort, as they 
prefer tolerating their pain rather than suffering from continued bowel dysfunction 
(Panchal et al 2007, Mueller-Lissner 2010, Hjalte et al 2010). OIC is one of the 
most common reasons why patients stop opioid treatment regimens (Bell et al 
2009). However, this compromises effective analgesia, leading to a return of the 
pain being treated (Bell et al 2009, Dhingra et al 2013, Panchal et al 2007). It has 
also been suggested that some patients receiving long-term opioid treatment for any 
type of pain would rather endure their pain rather than the constipation opioids may 
cause (Panchal et al 2007). 
The PROBE 1 survey of patients taking oral opioids and laxatives in the US and EU 
(n=322) reported that one-third of patients missed, decreased, or stopped using 
opioids specifically in order to ease defecation and pass a bowel movement (Bell et 
al 2009). In addition, 92% of patients subsequently reported that they experienced 
increased pain after doing so (Bell et al 2009). A small qualitative US self-reported 
survey of advanced cancer patients with OIC (n=12) indicated decreasing or 
stopping the use of opioid medications to relieve OIC is common, indicating that 
OIC may be a prominent barrier to effective pain management (Dhingra et al 2013). 
To our knowledge, there is no published epidemiologic literature that describes 
mortality rate within OIC patients or directly explores the relationship between OIC 
and mortality. Looking beyond OIC, two observational studies using US 
administrative claims databases evaluated risk of safety events among elderly 
patients treated with opioid therapy (Solomon et al 2010b, Solomon et al 2010a). 
One of the studies reported incidence rates for all-cause mortality, death related to 
an adverse event, and out-of-hospital-cardiac death equal to 75, 12, and 17 per 
12 of 96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
1000-person years, respectively (Solomon et al 2010b). When compared to non- 
selective non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) using a propensity score 
matched analysis for baseline characteristics, the same study reported that opioid 
therapy is associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (Hazard 
Ratio=1.87, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.39-2.53) and out-of-hospital death 
(Hazard Ratio 1.96, 95% CI: 1.05-3.67) (Solomon et al 2010b). The second study 
indicated that the type of opioid impacts mortality, with risk increased in oxycodone 
users RR 2.43; 95%CI 1.47-4.00) and codeine relative risk (RR) 2.05 (95% CI: 
1.22-3.45) versus hydrocodone (Solomon et al 2010a). 
2.1.1.6 
Important co-morbidities 
To our knowledge, there is no published literature of observational studies 
describing co-morbidities of patients with OIC; however, published literature 
(Hudson et al 2008, Cicero et al 2009, Carman et al 2011) describing 
epidemiological studies and surveys of chronic opioid users and patients newly 
initiating chronic opioid therapy, as well as an observational study assessing the 
burden of OIC, reported the following baseline/concurrent conditions: 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
• 
Pain, including arthritis or rheumatism, chronic back problems, 
migraine/chronic headaches, dorsalgia, pain syndrome, and neuralgia. 
Cardiovascular conditions, including hypertension, ischaemic heart 
disease, angina, and heart failure.

PART II: Module SII – Non-clinical part of the safety specification 
2.2.1 
Toxicity 
Key issues identified from acute or repeat-dose toxicity studies 
The liver was identified as a target organ of toxicity in chronic studies (weight 
increase and hypertrophy in rodents, weight increase in dogs). The liver findings 
were slight, reversible, non-adverse in nature and occurred at significant margins to 
clinically relevant exposures indicating little relevance to man. There has been no 
liver signal observed in clinical trials. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity 
Naloxegol did not impair fertility in rats. Any potentially naloxegol-mediated 
effects in the reproductive/development studies were seen at significant maternal 
exposure margins of at least 79x to the maximum recommended human dose 
(MRHD).  The relevance of the observed developmental effects observed in rats 
and rabbits to human safety is considered negligible since they occurred at maternal 
exposures that are not clinically relevant. 
Genotoxicity 
Naloxegol oxalate did not show any mutagenic activity in a bacterial mutation 
(Ames) test. Naloxegol (free base) did not induce mutations in the mouse 
Lymphoma TK assay or chromosome damage in the in vivo mouse micronucleus 
test. The overall weight of evidence supports the conclusion that naloxegol is not 
genotoxic 
Carcinogenicity 
Neoplastic changes were observed in rats and are well known hormonal and 
centrally- mediated effects that are known not to translate to man. Naloxegol does 
not have any carcinogenic potential relevant for humans. 
2.2.2 
Safety pharmacology 
Cardiovascular system including potential effect on the QT interval 
Cardiovascular effects were noted in the dog telemetry study and were limited to 
moderate decreases in arterial blood pressure, left ventricular systolic pressure and 
indices of cardiac contractility. The no-observed-adverse-effect-level (NOAEL) for 
these effects was at an exposure (maximum concentration [Cmax]) comparable to 
14 of 96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
human exposure at the MRHD. However, cardiovascular effects were not seen in 
the isolated dog myocyte or rat isolated heart and naloxegol was only a weak 
inhibitor of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) ion channel 
(IC50>300µM) and was inactive at a further 7 cardiac ion channels. 
The telemetry findings in the dog study are unlikely to be of clinical relevance. 
There has been no clear or consistent cardiovascular-type safety signal observed in 
clinical trials. 
Gastrointestinal system 
Naloxegol decreased gastric emptying and intestinal transport. The NOAEL was 15 
times and 112 times the human exposure (Cmax) at MRHD for gastric emptying 
and intestinal transport, respectively. Gastrointestinal effects occurred at significant 
margins to clinically relevant exposures indicating little relevance to man. 
Nervous system 
Naloxegol did not show any central nervous system (CNS) effects, including any 
potential abuse or drug dependence liability. At clinically relevant doses, naloxegol 
administration is not expected to cause any CNS effects and has no abuse potential 
or drug dependence liability. 
Renal system 
Mild to moderate effects on renal function were noted. The NOAEL was 347 times 
the human exposure (Cmax). Renal effects occurred at significant margins to 
clinically relevant exposures indicating little relevance to man.

PART II: Module SIII: Clinical trial exposure 
2.3.1 
Summary of clinical trial exposure 
Overall cumulative subject exposure are provided in Table 2, based on actual 
exposure data from completed interventional clinical trials and 1 ongoing phase I 
interventional study paediatric study, which currently has 46 patients treated (33 
female patients and 13male patients as of 15-Sep-2021, D3820C00016). The 
completed studies are Phase IIb Study 07-IN-NX003 and Phase III Studies 
D3820C00004, D3820C00005, D3820C00006, D3820C00007, D3820C00008. 
Additionally, study D3820C00006 (n=13), on OIC patients with cancer pain, ended 
enrolment early due to slow recruitment. The decrease in the number of patients 
exposed for ≥50 weeks to ≥52 weeks is mainly due to the treatment completion visit 
schedule and not due to discontinuations in Study D3820C00008. 
Additionally, study D3820R00009, on OIC patients with cancer pain, was 
discontinued due to low patient accrual, time required to reach target patient 
numbers, inability to obtain all required data from data sources, limited options for 
additional data sources (other sources alongside the THIN, PHARMO and GePaRD 
databases were also assessed for feasibility), and inability to adapt or reduce target 
patient numbers (considered as not scientifically feasible or statistically valid). 
Cumulative summary tabulations of exposure by age/gender and by racial group are 
presented in  
Table 3 and Table 4 respectively. Exposure by dose is presented in Table 5.   All 
numbers provided in the below tables are derived from completed studies (Phase 
IIb Study 07-IN-NX003 and Phase III Studies D3820C00004, D3820C00005,

PART II: Module SIV – Populations not studied in clinical trials 
2.4.1 
Exclusion Criteria in pivotal clinical studies within the development 
programme 
Important exclusion criteria in the pivotal clinical studies are described in Table 6  
below. 
Table 6: Exclusion criteria in pivotal clinical studies 
Criteria 
Reason for exclusion 
Conditions that increase the risk 
of  gastrointestinal (GI) 
perforation 
Patients receiving opioid 
treatment for cancer pain 
Patients were excluded from the 
clinical trials because they were at 
increased risk for GI perforation, a 
fatal adverse reaction observed 
with a structurally similar drug, 
methylnaltrexone. GI perforation 
can also rarely be caused by 
prolonged constipation resulting 
from chronic opiate therapy. 
Patients with cancer pain may be 
receiving treatment for the cancer 
and not taking a stable regimen of 
opioids. Therefore, these patients 
were excluded to avoid factors that 
might confound a complete 
understanding of the safety and 
efficacy of naloxegol 
18 of 96 
Is it considered to be included as 
missing information? 
No. 
Rationale: Naloxegol is contraindicated 
in patients with known or suspected GI 
obstruction   or in patients at increased 
risk of recurrent obstruction, due to the 
potential for GI perforation. 
Therefore, use in this population of 
patients is not relevant for inclusion 
as missing information. 
 No. 
Rationale: Data from over 500 patients 
treated in a real world setting 
(KYONAL,NACASY, MovE) 
•  Cobo Dols 2021 One-year 
efficacy and safety of 
naloxegol on symptoms and 
quality of life related to opioid-
induced constipation in patients 
with cancer: KYONAL study. 
•  Davies 2022. A prospective, 
real-world, multinationals

missing information? 
Study of naloxegol for patients 
with cancer pain diagnosed 
with opioid-induced 
constipation: NACASY Study. 
•  Lemaire 2021. Effectiveness of 
naloxegol in patients with 
cancer pain suffering from 
opioid-induced constipation: 
MovE Study. 
•  Ostan 2021. Can naloxegol 
therapy improve quality of life 
in patients with advanced 
cancer?  
These data show that naloxegol is 
frequently added to an existing laxative 
treatment in patients with OIC (48.4 to 
75.9% of patients) with cancer related 
pain. A greater relief of constipation was 
seen following combination treatment 
with naloxegol and a second laxative. 
The safety profile seen during combined 
use was comparable to that of naloxegol 
alone. 
Based on the data from these studies, 
safety in patients with cancer pain is no 
longer considered as missing 
information. 
Yes 
Yes 
Criteria 
Reason for exclusion 
Diagnosis of liver cirrhosis as 
defined by Child-Pugh classes 
of  B (moderate) or C (severe) 
or acute liver disease 
Patients with creatinine clearance 
< 30 mL/min 
The safety profile of naloxegol in 
this patient population was 
expected to be different because of 
the potential for decreased 
metabolism of naloxegol and 
enhanced CNS penetration of 
naloxegol due to potential 
disruption of the blood-brain 
barrier. 
Patients with this degree of renal 
impairment were excluded because 
of potential accumulation of 
naloxegol that could change the 
safety profile. 
19 of 96 
 
 
 
Is it considered to be included as 
missing information? 
No. 
Rationale: It is known that patients with 
these conditions are at increased risk 
for opioid withdrawal and reversal of 
analgesia because naloxegol can enter 
the CNS. In the EU SmPC in section 
4.4 Special warnings and special 
precautions for use it notes that 
naloxegol should be prescribed with 
caution in such patients taking into 
account their individual benefit-risk 
balance with observation for potential 
CNS  effects, such as symptoms of 
opioid withdrawal or reversal of 
analgesia.Thus, although  the safety 
profile of this population may be 
different to that of the general target 
population it is not relevant or 
warranted to consider this population 
as missing 
information and to further evaluate the 
safety profile. 
Yes. 
Criteria 
Reason for exclusion 
Any condition that may have 
affected the permeability of 
the blood-brain barrier, eg, 
multiple    sclerosis, recent 
brain injury, Alzheimer’s 
disease, and uncontrolled 
epilepsy. 
Patients were excluded from the 
clinical trials in order to avoid 
factors that may confound a 
complete understanding of the 
safety and efficacy of naloxegol. 
Naloxegol may cross the blood- 
brain-barrier in patients with these 
conditions and interfere with the 
analgesic effect of the opiate or 
cause opioid withdrawal. 
Patients who are at increased 
risk for ventricular arrhythmia, 
including those that have a prior 
history of serious ventricular 
arrhythmia, family history of 
sudden cardiac death, family 
history of long QT syndrome, 
have a recent history of 
myocardial infarction within 6 
months before randomization or 
who have overt cardiovascular 
disease 
The safety of naloxegol in these 
patients was unknown. 
Cardiovascular effects were noted 
in the dog telemetry study and 
another member of the same drug 
class as naloxegol had a post- 
marketing safety signal of 
myocardial infarction. As a 
consequence, patients with overt 
cardiac disease could be more 
susceptible to serious 
cardiovascular adverse reactions. 
Pregnancy or lactation 
Yes 
Patients who were pregnant or 
lactating were excluded from the 
clinical trials due to safety reasons. 
The blood-brain barrier in humans 
is not fully developed until at least   
6 months of age postpartum so 
there is a theoretical potential for 
provoking opioid withdrawal in the 
foetus or the nursing infant who is 
not older than 6 months of 
age with use of an opioid receptor 
antagonist in the mother, who is 
concurrently using an opioid. 
20 of 96 
 
 
Criteria 
Reason for exclusion 
Strong inhibitors of 
cytochrome P450 3A4 
(CYP3A4) and P- 
glycoprotein (PGP) are prohibited 
These drugs were prohibited 
because of safety. These inhibitors 
have the potential to increase the 
blood levels of naloxegol and the 
risk for its toxicity. 
Is it considered to be included as 
missing information? 
No. 
Rationale: Naloxegol is a substrate    of 
CYP3A4 enzyme and a substrate of P-
gp transporter. 
Concomitant use with dual P- 
gp/strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. 
ketoconazole, clarithromycin, 
ritonavir) or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
(e.g. voriconazole) can significantly 
increase exposure to naloxegol and is 
contraindicated (see section 5.2 EU 
SmPC Pharmacokinetic properties). It 
is therefore not relevant to include use 
with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors or P-
gp as missing information. The 
starting dose of naloxegol should be 
12.5 mg once daily when co-
administered with moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors or dual Pgp/moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors (see sections 4.2 
Posology and method of 
administration, 4.5 Interaction with 
other medicinal products and other 
forms of interaction and 5.2 
Pharmacokinetic properties). 
After 168,554 patient- years of 
exposure in marketed use, there have 
been 4 cases of drug interactions 
reported that involve CYP3A4. Three 
interactions involved moderate 
inhibitors and one interaction involved 
phenytoin, a strong CYP3A4 inducer. 
The result of the phenytoin interaction 
was not reported as a decreased effect 
of naloxegol, but a reduced serum 
phenytoin level. Therefore, although 
there is evidence of a different safety 
profile when given with moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors there is little 
evidence of a significant clinical 
impact and thepotential risk is 
managed effectively through the 
product    labeling.

PART II: Module SV – Post-authorisation experience 
2.5.1  Method used to calculate exposure 
The post-marketing patient exposure data presented is estimated based on 
naloxegol’s monthly actual ex-factory sales volume from each local marketing 
company. These data represent all naloxegol formulations delivered to various 
distribution channels (for example wholesalers, pharmacies, etc) worldwide. The 
database has the ability to pull data for complete months only and is limited to sales 
data only. 
The sales volume is provided as the number of tablets distributed. The estimated 
post-marketing patient exposure data for the reporting period is an approximation 
based on the assumption that each patient took 1 tablet of naloxegol a day. 
Therefore, a patient-year worth of exposure is calculated by multiplying number of 
tablets per day by 365 days per patient year. 
The current methodology does not distinguish between sales that are related to 
initial prescriptions versus those related to repeat prescriptions. Therefore, it is not 
possible to estimate the number of patients exposed to naloxegol. More detailed 
patient-level data (e.g. gender, ethnicity, age category, off-label use, specific 
populations etc) are not available. 
2.5.2 
Exposure 
The cumulative global post-marketing patient exposure to naloxegol, since launch 
to 15 September 2021, has been estimated to be approximately 352,855  patient-
years.

PART II: Module SVI – Additional EU requirements for the safety 
specification 
2.6.1 
Potential for misuse for illegal purposes 
Based on the totality of non-clinical and clinical abuse potential data, it is concluded 
that naloxegol does not have abuse or dependence potential. 
Pharmacologically, as a μ-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxegol is devoid of μ- 
opioid receptor partial agonist activity and does not have affinity for other receptors 
that are known to mediate the actions of a substance of abuse. 
Non-clinical data strongly suggest that naloxegol is unlikely to be abused in man.

2.7.1.2  Risks considered important for inclusion in the list of safety concerns in the 
RMP 
Important Identified Risk: Opioid withdrawal syndrome 
Opioid withdrawal syndrome is a listed ADR and is described in Section 4.8 
Undesirable effects of the naloxegol CDS (Appendix 1). Case reports of OWS have 
been reported in the naloxegol clinical programme according to the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM]-5 definition. OWS is a cluster of 
three or more of the following signs or symptoms: dysphoric mood, nausea or 
vomiting, muscle aches, lacrimation or rhinorrhoea, pupillary dilation or 
piloerection or sweating, diarrhoea, yawning, fever or insomnia. OWS typically 
develops within minutes to several days following administration of an opioid 
antagonist.  The FDA definition of opioid withdrawal includes ≥1 non-GI 
symptoms in addition to having ≥3 OWS signs/symptoms with onset on the same 
day. According to the CDS, naloxegol at therapeutic doses has minimal uptake 
across the blood-brain barrier. In some patients, however, a constellation of 
symptoms has been reported, which resembles the syndrome of central opioid 
withdrawal. Most of these reports were observed shortly after initial administration 
with the medicinal product and symptoms were mild or moderate in intensity. 
In clinical trials opioid drug withdrawal in the absence of risk factors identified for 
opioid withdrawal (disrupted blood-brain barrier or overdose) was reported in < 1% 
of patients. About 12 % of the cases in the naloxegol safety database were 
considered serious.  As of 15-Sep-2021, a review of the cumulative data in the 
naloxegol safety database does not change the current understanding of this topic. 
28 of 96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Risk-benefit impact: When an opioid withdrawal occurs following naloxegol use, 
the increase in pain as well as other symptoms related to the withdrawal create a 
need to stop naloxegol. 
Important Identified Risk: Clinically important gastrointestinal (GI) events 
In clinical trials, all patients recovered from the clinically important GI events and 
no patient died. Reports of severe  abdominal pain and/or severe diarrhoea have 
been observed in clinical trials with the 25 mg dose of naloxegol, typically 
occurring shortly after initiation of treatment. As a review of the naloxegol safety 
database, the majority of GI AEs reported were non-serious. A few cases of 
intestinal perforation reported occurred in a patient with peritoneal metastases 
which is a contraindication in the naloxegol SmPC. 
Risk-benefit impact: Clinically important GI events can result in hospitalisation. 
Diarrhoea or vomiting can be serious if they aggravate pre-existing medical 
conditions such as renal insufficiency, hypotension or hypokalaemia. It is important 
that GI events are appropriately managed with naloxegol withdrawal. 
Important Identified Risk: Gastrointestinal perforation 
There were no reports of GI perforation in any of the Phase II/III studies. In 
addition, in the Phase III studies, all GI SAEs were adjudicated by an independent 
external adjudication committee to determine the potential for meeting the criteria 
for a bowel perforation event. All of the adjudicated events in naloxegol-treated 
patients were ‘not related’ to bowel perforation, according to the adjudication 
committee.  Several reports of GI perforation have been received in the post 
marketing setting, a few of which have resulted in fatal outcomes in patients who 
were at risk for GI perforation. Many of these patients had known risk factors for 
GI perforation. As patients at risk of gastrointestinal perforation were  excluded 
from clinical trials the role of naloxegol in contribution of these events cannot be 
excluded. 
Risk-benefit impact: GI perforation is a surgical and life-threatening emergency and 
is generally associated with substantial morbidity as well as a high frequency 
(approximately 20 to 40%) of mortality (Azer 2009), being further associated with 
septic shock and multi-organ failure. 
Although the precise nature of the GI perforation with naloxegol is unclear due to 
the small number of cases observed, the severity and potential implications of the 
condition in general impact the risk benefit balance of naloxegol. 
29 of 96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Important Identified Risk: Interactions with drugs modulating CYP3A4 and P-gp 
activities 
Naloxegol is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4 enzyme and a substrate of P-gp 
transporter. Co-administration of dual P-gp/ strong or moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors, 
or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors significantly increases naloxegol plasma 
concentrations. Conversely, co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 inducer results 
in decreased plasma concentration. 
Risk-benefit impact: Impact is that naloxegol may require cessation of therapy and 
the OIC may recur. 
Important Potential Risk: Haemodynamic changes potentially leading to serious 
cardiovascular events (including effects on blood pressure and syncope) 
The overall incidence of adjudicated major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) 
was low and similar across treatment groups both in the placebo-controlled studies 
and in the randomised, long-term safety study. The incidence of MACE 
adjudicated by the CV-EAC as meeting formal diagnostic criteria was 0.6% (9/700 
patients) for placebo or UC versus 0.4% (5/1386 patients) for naloxegol. 
Case reports of cardiovascular events have been noted in clinical studies and post 
marketing experience. The serious cardiovascular events reported were 
hypertension, hypotension, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial infarction, 
syncope and dyspnoea. More than half of these cases were reported as serious with 
several resulting in a fatal outcome. A causal association between naloxegol and 
serious CV events could not be established based on review of cases from clinical 
trials and post-marketing setting. 
Risk-benefit impact: Serious cardiovascular events require intervention and possible 
hospitalisation. If not adequately managed these events can result in disability or 
even death. 
Important Potential Risk: Interference with opioid mediated analgesia 
All of the pain events in clinical studies were non-serious. Most patients recover 
from the pain event. In some cases, the patients recover during treatment with 
naloxegol; some patients recover after the naloxegol is discontinued. It is unlikely 
that the patients who recovered during treatment in the clinical trials were 
experiencing pain due to naloxegol’s peripheral antagonism of opioid analgesia. 
Most patients who have opioid withdrawal induced by naloxegol do not have 
reversal of analgesia or decreased opioid effect suggesting that the patients are 
experiencing peripheral opioid withdrawal. 
A review of the naloxegol drug safety database identified few cases of events of 
increased pain or decreased opioid efficacy in the absence of the opioid withdrawal 
syndrome. The majority of reported pain events were non-serious. 
30 of 96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Post-hoc analysis and spontaneous reports suggest that naloxegol may rarely 
contribute to increased pain in some patients in the absence of the opioid 
withdrawal syndrome. In general, events such as increased pain are not associated 
with appreciable morbidity or mortality. Most cases were mild to moderate in 
intensity. A review of spontaneous reports where an outcome is provided indicate 
that generally naloxegol is discontinued and the patient recovers. 
Risk-benefit impact: Impact is that naloxegol may require cessation of therapy and 
the OIC may recur. 
Missing information: Use in high risk CV patients 
There is insufficient information to determine if the safety profile in this 
population/utilisation is different to that of the general target population however 
due to medical judgement there is a concern that these patients may be at risk 
because of the preclinical findings in the dog and the fact that in some studies the 
incidence of cardiovascular events such as hypotension, hypertension, syncope, 
malignant hypertension and accelerated hypertension were higher than seen with 
usual care or a placebo. 
Risk-benefit impact: The impact on individual patients is unknown due to there 
being insufficient data for analysis in high risk CV patients. 
Missing information: Safety beyond one year of exposure 
There is very little experience in patients exposed to naloxegol for longer than 1 
year. As of 15-Sep-2021, there were only a few cases identified with use >1 year 
and the reports were all non-serious. No controlled study has been conducted. 
It is unknown how long naloxegol will continue to work or if there are risks 
associated with use greater than 1 year. 
Risk-benefit impact: The impact on individual patients is unknown due to there 
being insufficient data for analysis in patients who have used naloxegol for longer 
than one year. 
Missing information: Use in methadone-treated patients 
Patients receiving methadone for pain relief were included in clinical trials and had 
more frequent side effects affecting the gut (such as abdominal pain and diarrhoea) 
than patients not receiving methadone. Symptoms suggestive of opioid withdrawal 
were observed in a higher proportion of patients taking methadone than those not 
taking methadone. Patients taking methadone for treatment of opioid addiction 
31 of 96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
were not included in the clinical development programme, and Moventig should be 
used with caution in these patients. Patients who experience severe side effects 
affecting the gut may have the dose lowered to 12.5 mg. 
Risk-benefit impact: The impact on individual patients is unknown due to there 
being insufficient data for analysis in methadone-treated patients. 
Missing information: Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Patients who were pregnant or lactating were excluded from the clinical trials due to 
safety reasons. The blood-brain barrier in humans is not fully developed until at 
least 6 months of age postpartum so there is a theoretical potential for provoking 
opioid withdrawal in the foetus or the nursing infant who is not older than 6 months 
of age with use of an opioid receptor antagonist in the mother, who is concurrently 
using an opioid. 
Risk-benefit impact: The impact on individual patients is unknown due to there 
being insufficient data for analysis in use in pregnancy and lactation. 
Missing information: Use in patients over 75 years of age 
There is a small effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of naloxegol (approximately 
0.7% increase in AUC for every year increase in age). No dose adjustment is 
recommended for elderly patients. Patients over 65 years of age have been 
represented in the phase III studies. Clinical studies of naloxegol did not include 
sufficient numbers of patients aged 75 years or over to determine whether they 
respond differently than younger patients. 
Risk-benefit impact: The impact on individual patients is unknown due to there 
being insufficient data for analysis in patients over 75 years of age. 
Missing information: Use in patients with severe renal impairment 
Patients with severe renal impairment were excluded from clinical trials because of 
potential accumulation of naloxegol that could change the safety profile. There is 
limited data available to confirm if the safety profile in this patient population is 
different to that of the general target population. 
Risk-benefit impact: The impact on individual patients is unknown due to there 
being insufficient data for analysis in patients with severe renal impairment. 
Missing information: Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
This patient population was excluded from clinical trials as the safety profile of 
naloxegol was expected to be different because of the potential for decreased 
metabolism of naloxegol and enhanced CNS penetration of naloxegol due to 
32 of 96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
potential disruption of the blood-brain barrier. There is insufficient data for analysis 
to confirm if the safety profile is different in this patient population. 
Risk-benefit impact: The impact on individual patients is unknown due to there 
being insufficient data for analysis in patients with severe hepatic impairment. 
2.7.2 
New safety concerns and reclassification with a submission of an updated RMP 
Efficacy/safety in cancer pain population, previously categorized as a missing 
information in the EU RMP version 7.2 has been removed from the list of safety 
concerns based on the data from three non-interventional observational studies 
(KYONAL,NACASY, MovE). These data show that naloxegol is frequently added to 
an existing laxative treatment in patients with OIC (48.4 to 75.9% of patients) with 
cancer related pain. A greater relief of constipation was seen following combination 
treatment with naloxegol and a second laxative. The safety profile seen during 
combined use was comparable to that of naloxegol alone. Thus, safety in patients with 
cancer pain is no longer considered as missing information. 
2.7.3 
Details of important identified risks, important potential risks and missing 
information 
2.7.3.1  Presentation of important identified risks 
The important identified risks of opioid withdrawal syndrome, clinically important 
GI events, gastrointestinal perforation and interactions with drugs modulating 
CYP3A4 and P-gp activities are summarised in Table 12, Table 13, Table 14 and 
Table 15 respectively.

Risk 
Potential mechanism 
Opioid withdrawal syndrome 
Opioid receptors are distributed throughout the entire body, including in many 
locations outside the CNS. While this remains an area of evolving understanding, it is 
known that opioid receptors are present in the peripheral nervous system and also 
have a broad visceral distribution (Vadivelu et al 2011, Peng et al 2012). The 
intended mechanism of action for naloxegol is preferential antagonism of opioids at 
their receptors in the enteric plexi. The efficacy and GI AEs observed directly after 
initial naloxegol administration is likely related to localised gastrointestinal reversal 
of chronic, constipating opioid effects (i.e., reversal of impaired GI motility and 
decreased intestinal fluid absorption). Data from both animal studies and human 
studies support the involvement of peripheral opioid receptors in analgesia, 
especially in the presence of inflammation. (Sehgal et al 2011). The concept of 
central opioid withdrawal syndrome is more widely recognised in the literature than 
a peripherally-mediated syndrome. Central opioid withdrawal is characterised in the 
DSM-5 as a constellation of clinically important symptoms occurring together in 
time and also temporally related to either cessation of opioid use or the use of an 
opioid antagonist drug. Indeed, the clinical use of peripherally selective opioid 
antagonists to treat opioid-induced constipation is relatively recent and has been 
limited, to date, to small and well-circumscribed populations. 
Evidence 
source(s) and 
strength of 
evidence 
Characterisation 
of the risk 
In clinical trials the opioid withdrawal syndrome was characterised as a syndrome 
resembling central opioid withdrawal and occurred uncommonly (≥1/1000, <1/100) 
in patients. The syndrome was more frequent in the naloxegol group than in the 
placebo or usual standard care group and there is a plausible mechanism of action 
for naloxegol to lead to this risk. 
Opioid withdrawal syndrome is a listed ADR and is described in Section 4.8 
Undesirable effects of the naloxegol CDS (Appendix 1). Case reports of OWS have 
been reported in the naloxegol clinical programme according to the Diagnostic and 
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [DSM]-5 definition. OWS is a cluster of 
three or more of the following signs or symptoms: dysphoric mood, nausea or 
vomiting, muscle aches, lacrimation or rhinorrhoea, pupillary dilation or 
piloerection or sweating, diarrhoea, yawning, fever or insomnia. OWS typically 
develops within minutes to several days following administration of an opioid 
antagonist.  The FDA definition of opioid withdrawal includes ≥1 non-GI 
symptoms in addition to having ≥3 OWS signs/symptoms with onset on the same 
day. According to the CDS, naloxegol at therapeutic doses has minimal uptake 
across the blood-brain barrier. In some patients, however, a constellation of 
symptoms has been reported, which resembles the syndrome of central opioid 
withdrawal. Most of these reports were observed shortly after initial administration 
with the medicinal product and symptoms were mild or moderate in intensity. 
In clinical trials opioid drug withdrawal in the absence of risk factors identified for 
opioid withdrawal (disrupted blood-brain barrier or overdose) was reported in < 1% of 
patients.  As of 15-Sep-2021, a review of the cumulative data in the naloxegol safety 
database does not change the current understanding of this topic.

Important Identified 
Risk 
Risk factors 
and risk groups 
Preventability 
Opioid withdrawal syndrome 
Risk factors for opioid withdrawal include use of methadone, an opioid daily dose 
≥200 meu and a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2. Patients with any one of these risks experience 
opioid withdrawal at a much higher rate. There have been a few 
reports of the opioid drug withdrawal syndrome in patients concomitantly 
treated with other narcotic antagonists. The dose of naloxegol may also be a risk 
factor since it may be seen with overdoses in the absence of a blood-brain barrier 
disruption. However, review of the naloxegol safety database suggests that the 
opioid withdrawal occurs generally in the absence of these risk factors. 
Approximately 90% of all cases reported as opioid drug withdrawal codes (PTs 
withdrawal syndrome and drug withdrawal syndrome) did not include a specific 
pain event. Although most reports provide limited information, about 2% of the 
cases are reported to have a condition associated with disruption of the blood-brain 
barrier. 
The SmPC includes a number of warnings to reduce the occurrence of the opioid 
withdrawal syndrome. Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use 
warns about an increased risk of opioid withdrawal or reversal of opioid analgesia 
in patients with conditions that disrupt the blood-brain barrier and provides some 
examples of these conditions. Section 4.9 of the SmPC reminds prescribers to be 
alert to symptoms of withdrawal syndrome if the patient takes an overdose of 
naloxegol. 
Impact on the risk-
benefit balance of the 
product 
When an opioid withdrawal occurs following naloxegol use, the increase in pain as 
well as other symptoms related to the withdrawal, create a need to stop naloxegol. 
Public health impact 
As the impact is to the treated population only there is no public health impact.

2.7.3.1.2  Clinically important gastrointestinal events 
Information concerning the risk of clinically important gastrointestinal events are 
summarised in Table 13.

(GI) events

Clinically important gastrointestinal (GI) events 
Potential mechanisms 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Characterisation of the 
risk 
Mu-opioid receptors have a multitude of physiologic effects on the bowel that 
increase the likelihood of constipation, including increased absorption of fluid, 
decreased propulsive peristalsis, and increased contraction of sphincters. The 
blockade of these receptors by naloxegol decreases opioid stimulation of 
receptors, which decreases the physiologic sequelae of opioids on the bowel 
that lead to constipation. These pharmacologic actions can occasionally be 
exaggerated in some individuals producing serious diarrhoea, vomiting or 
abdominal pain. 
In the Phase III confirmatory studies (12 weeks), the frequency of patients 
with GI SAEs was low, with no imbalance between naloxegol (0.3%) and 
placebo (0.2%).  However, the frequency of patients with SAEs was greater 
with naloxegol (3.9%) than with placebo (1.4%). There was a higher incidence 
of severe and/or SAEs of abdominal pain in patients taking the 25 mg dose 
compared to placebo (5.6% for naloxegol 25 mg vs. 0.9% placebo) and 
diarrhoea (1.6% for naloxegol 25 mg vs. 1.1% for placebo). 
In these trials, all patients recovered from the clinically important GI events 
and no patient died. Reports of severe abdominal pain and/or severe diarrhoea 
have been observed in clinical trials with the 25 mg dose of naloxegol, 
typically occurring shortly after initiation of treatment. As a review of the 
naloxegol safety database, the majority of GI AEs reported were non-serious. 
A few cases of intestinal perforation reported occurred in a patient with 
peritoneal metastases which is a contraindication in the naloxegol SmPC. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk factors for non-serious gastrointestinal events are the use of methadone, 
an  opioid  daily  dose  ≥200  meu,  a  BMI  ≥  30  kg/m2 and  the  dose  of  naloxegol. 
It is likely that these are also risk factors for clinically important GI events. 
Preventability 
Potential risk factors seen in serious post-marketing cases of abdominal pain 
included opioid withdrawal in 15% of cases, a history of GI disease in 30% of 
cases and the remainder had no reported risk factor. One serious case was 
associated with a drug interaction between diltiazem and naloxegol. 
Clinically important GI effects can be avoided by not administering naloxegol 
to patients at high risk for GI obstruction or perforation (see Section 4.3 
Contraindications, Section 4.4 Special warnings and precautions for use and 
Section 4.2 Posology and method of administration of the SmPC). The 
severity of the gastrointestinal event can be reduced by following the 
instruction in the SmPC to reduce the dose to 12.5 mg and for the patient to 
promptly report severe, persistent or worsening abdominal pain or diarrhoea to 
their doctor.

Important Identified Risk 
Clinically important gastrointestinal (GI) events 
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Clinically important GI events can result in hospitalisation. Diarrhoea or 
vomiting can be serious if they aggravate pre-existing medical conditions such 
as renal insufficiency, hypotension or hypokalaemia. It is important that GI 
events are appropriately managed with naloxegol withdrawal. 
Public health impact 
As the impact is to the treated population only there is no public health impact. 
2.7.3.1.3  Gastrointestinal perforation 
Information concerning the risk of gastrointestinal perforation are summarised in Table 14. 
Table 14: Important Identified Risk - Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation 
Important Identified Risk 
Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation 
Potential mechanisms 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
With respect to an OIC population both spontaneous colonic perforation and 
stercoral colonic perforation are relevant. Spontaneous colonic perforation, as 
the name implies, occurs in the absence of overt risk factors and, while rare, is 
likely often misdiagnosed. Stercoral perforation refers to rupture of the GI 
tract by its internal contents, most typically by hardened faeces (i.e., 
faecaloma) associated with chronic constipation and in the absence of other 
risk factors. Also considered a rare (but possibly under diagnosed) disorder, it 
is believed to be caused by either intrinsic gut hypomotility or drug-induced 
hypomotility. It is reported more commonly in the distal colon, where a 
confluence of factors (less water content, more precarious blood supply and 
narrowness of the local bowel) conspire to increase susceptibility to 
mechanical insult (Haddad et al 2005). The final common denominator 
regarding the pathophysiology of stercoral perforation is thought to be an 
ischaemic pressure necrosis with associated inflammatory change (Dubinsky 
1996). 
Clinical studies and post-marketed use. 
GI perforations have been observed with naloxegol use, two of which have 
been fatal. A search of the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (April 24, 
2008 through October 13, 2009) identified 6 cases of GI perforation for 
patients receiving methylnaltrexone. In addition, three AstraZeneca initiated 
observational studies utilizing US, UK and German electronic healthcare 
databases reported incidence rates of GI tract perforations among adult 
patients (≥18 years of age) with chronic continuous opioid use and a US-based 
administrative claims study reported an incidence rate of 0.007 per patient 
year. This rate increased to 0.541 per patient-year when patients with a prior 
history of GI tract perforations were included. Using the UK CPRD-HES 
linkage, incidence of GI tract perforation was 0.0001 per patient year. This 
rate increased to 0.0003 when including indicators of prior GI tract 
perforations. Using the German IMS Disease Analyzer database, an incidence 
rate of 0.001 per patient year was reported. Allowing for prior history of GI 
tract perforation, it increased the rate to 0.503 per patient year.

Important Identified Risk 
Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation 
Characterisation of the 
risk 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
There were no reports of GI perforation in any of the Phase II/III studies. In 
addition, in the Phase III studies, all GI SAEs were adjudicated by an 
independent external adjudication committee to determine the potential for 
meeting the criteria for a bowel perforation event. All of the adjudicated 
events in naloxegol-treated patients were ‘not related’ to bowel perforation, 
according to the adjudication committee. Several reports of GI perforation 
have been received in the post marketing setting, a few of which have 
resulted in fatal outcomes in patients who were at risk for GI perforation. 
Many of these patients had known risk factors for GI perforation.  As patients 
at risk of gastrointestinal perforation were excluded from clinical trials the 
role of naloxegol in contribution of these events cannot be excluded. 
The most notable risk factor is a medical history including GI events, this is 
reflected in the naloxegol SmPC where use in contraindicated in patients with 
known or GI obstruction or in patients at increased risk of recurrent 
obstruction. In addition, Section 4.4 of the SmPC recommends caution with 
regards to the use of naloxegol in patients with any condition which might 
result in impaired integrity of the gastrointestinal tract wall (e.g. severe peptic 
ulcer disease, Crohn's Disease, active or recurrent diverticulitis, infiltrative 
gastrointestinal tract malignancies or peritoneal metastases) 
Some cancer patients may be at risk for GI perforation for multiple reasons. Of 
particular note are anti-angiogenic agents, particularly bevacizumab, a 
monoclonal antibody targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). 
This risk seems to be higher in patients with advanced ovarian cancer. At 
highest risk are patients with pre-existing GI tract tumour involvement 
(obstruction or bowel wall thickening) and those who have undergone recent 
surgery or received prior pelvic radiation. Bowel perforation occurred at a 
median of 71 days after initiation of bevacizumab therapy and 14 days after 
the last dose of drug. 
Patients with advanced or recurrent malignancies known to be associated with 
higher rates of malignant bowel obstruction, such as advanced or recurrent 
ovarian, colon, or small bowel cancer, may also be at increased risk.

Important Identified Risk 
Gastrointestinal (GI) perforation 
Preventability 
The SmPC contraindicates the use of naloxegol when the patients are at risk 
for GI perforation. (section 4.3 Contraindications) It also mitigates the risk if 
it does occur by warning the patients to contact their doctor if they develop 
any signs of perforation. 
Section 4.4, Special warnings and special precautions for use in the 
naloxegol SmPC states that cases of gastrointestinal perforation have been 
reported in post-marketing setting, including fatal cases when naloxegol was 
used in patients who were at an increased risk of gastrointestinal (GI) 
perforation. Naloxegol must not be used in patients with known or suspected 
gastrointestinal obstruction or in patients at increased risk of recurrent 
obstruction, or in patients with underlying cancer who are heightened risk of 
GI perforation. Caution with regards to the use of naloxegol should be 
exercised in patients with any condition which might result in impaired 
integrity of the gastrointestinal tract wall, taking into account the overall 
benefit-risk profile for a given patient. Patients should be advised to 
discontinue therapy with naloxegol and promptly notify their physician if they 
develop unusually severe or persistent abdominal pain. 
Section 4.8 lists gastrointestinal perforation as an adverse reaction which 
occurs at ‘unknown’ frequency. 
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
GI perforation is a surgical and life-threatening emergency and is generally 
associated with substantial morbidity as well as a high frequency 
(approximately 20 to 40%) of mortality (Azer 2009), being further associated 
with septic shock and multi-organ failure. 
Although the precise nature of the GI perforation with naloxegol is unclear 
due to the small number of cases observed, the severity and potential 
implications of the condition in general impact the risk benefit balance of 
naloxegol. 
Public health impact 
As the impact is to the treated population only, there is no public health 
impact.

2.7.3.1.4  Interactions with drugs modulating CYP3A4 and P-gp activities 
Information concerning the risk of interactions with drugs modulating CYP3A4 and P-gp activities are 
summarised in Table 15. 
Table 15: Important Identified Risk – Interactions with drugs modulating CYP3A4 and P-gp 
activities 
Important Identified Risk 
Interactions with drugs modulating CYP3A4 and P-gp activities 
Potential mechanisms 
The metabolic stability of naloxegol was studied in vitro in the presence of 
individual human cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes (CYP1A2, CYP2C9, 
CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A4) expressed in bacterial membranes. 
Naloxegol was metabolised primarily by CYP3A4 and not by the other CYP 
enzymes tested.  This was further confirmed in human liver microsomes. 
Naloxegol is not a substrate for organic anion transporter protein (OATP) 1B1, 
OATP1B3, or breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) but is a p-glycoprotein 
(P-gp) substrate in vitro. As renal elimination is a minor route of clearance for 
naloxegol, the potential for naloxegol to act as a substrate of organic cation 
transporter (OCT) 2, organic anion transporter (OAT) 1, or OAT3 was not 
examined.

Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Interaction with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In an open-label, non-randomized, fixed-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, 
crossover study to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of ketoconazole on the 
single dose PK of naloxegol, co-administration of ketoconazole and naloxegol 
resulted in a 12.9 fold (90% CI: 11.3-14.6) increase in naloxegol AUC and a 
9.6-fold increase in naloxegol Cmax (90% CI: 8.1-11.3), compared to when 
naloxegol was administered alone. Therefore, concomitant use with strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors is contraindicated. Grapefruit juice has been classified as a 
potent CYP3A4 inhibitor when consumed in large quantities. No data are 
available on the concomitant use of naloxegol with grapefruit juice. 
Concomitant consumption of grapefruit juice while taking naloxegol should 
generally be avoided and considered only in consultation with a healthcare 
provider. 
Interaction with moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors 
In an open-label, non-randomised, fixed sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, 
crossover study to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of diltiazem on the 
single dose PK of naloxegol, co-administration of diltiazem and naloxegol 
resulted in a 3.4-fold (90% CI: 3.2-3.7) increase in naloxegol AUC and a 2.9- 
fold increase in naloxegol Cmax (90% CI: 2.6-3.1), compared to when 
naloxegol was administered alone. Therefore, a dose adjustment is 
recommended when co-administered with diltiazem or other moderate 
CYP3A4 inhibitors. 
Interaction with strong CYP3A4 inducers 
In an open-label, nonrandomized, fixed-sequence, 3-period, 3-treatment, 
single-dose, crossover study to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of 
rifampin on the single dose PK of naloxegol, coadministration of rifampin and 
naloxegol resulted in a 89% (90% CI: 88%-90%) decrease in naloxegol AUC 
and a 76% decrease in naloxegol Cmax (90% CI: 69%-80%), compared to 
when naloxegol was administered alone. Therefore, Moventig is not 
recommended in patients who are taking strong CYP3A4 inducers. 
Interaction with P-gp inhibitors 
A double-blind, randomised, 2-part, crossover, single-center study was 
conducted to evaluate the effect of quinidine on the PK of naloxegol and the 
effect of the co-administration of naloxegol and quinidine on morphine- 
induced miosis in healthy volunteers. Co-administration of the P-gp inhibitor 
quinidine resulted in a 1.4-fold increase in the AUC (90% CI: 1.3-1.5) and a 
2.4-fold increase in the Cmax (90% CI: 2.2-2.8) of naloxegol. Co- 
administration of naloxegol and quinidine did not antagonize the morphine- 
induced miosis effect, suggesting that P-gp inhibition does not meaningfully 
increase the capacity of naloxegol to cross the blood-brain barrier at 
therapeutic doses. 
As the effects of P-gp inhibitors on the PK of naloxegol were small relative to 
the effects CYP3A4 inhibitors, the dosing recommendations for Moventig 
when co-administered with medicinal products causing both P-gp and 
CYP3A4 inhibition should be based on CYP3A4 inhibitor status - strong, 
moderate or weak. 
Characterisation of the 
risk 
Naloxegol is a sensitive substrate of CYP3A4 enzyme and a substrate of P-gp 
transporter. Co-administration of dual P-gp/ strong or moderate CYP3A4 
inhibitors, or strong CYP3A4 inhibitors significantly increases naloxegol 
plasma concentrations. Conversely, co-administration of a strong CYP3A4 
inducer results in decreased plasma concentration. 
41 of 96 
 
 
 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Preventability 
Based on its in vitro enzyme and transporter induction and inhibition profile, 
naloxegol is not likely to perpetrate pharmacokinetic-based drug-drug 
interactions. Naloxegol is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 and is a substrate 
of P-gp. Drugs that modulate CYP3A4 and P-gp activities are likely to 
influence the PK of naloxegol. 
The SmPC contains a number of warnings regarding the concomitant use of 
naloxegol and drugs modulating CYP3A4 and P-gp activities. 
Section 4.2 of the SmPC: 
The starting dose for patients taking moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. 
diltiazem, verapamil) is 12.5 mg once daily. The dose can be increased to 
25 mg if 12.5 mg is well tolerated by the patient (see section 4.5). No dose 
adjustment is required for patients taking weak CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. 
alprazolam, atorvastatin. 
Section 4.3 of the SmPC: 
Strong CYP3A4 inhibitors 
Concomitant use with strong CYP3A4 inhibitors (e.g. clarithromycin, 
ketoconazole, itraconazole or telithromycin; protease inhibitors such as 
ritonavir, indinavir or saquinavir; grapefruit juice when consumed in large 
quantities) 
Section 4.4 of SmPC: 
Naloxegol is not recommended in patients who are taking strong CYP3A4 
inducers (e.g. carbamazepine, rifampin, St. John’s wort) 
Section 4.5 of the SmPC reiterates the warnings in section 4.2, 4.3 and 4.4 of 
the SmPC and details the evidence source of this risk as summarized above. 
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Impact is that naloxegol may require cessation of therapy and the OIC may 
recur. 
Public health impact 
As the impact is to the treated population only, there is no public health 
impact. 
2.7.3.2  Presentation of important potential risks 
The important potential risks of haemodynamic changes potentially leading to 
serious cardiovascular events (including effects on blood pressure and syncope) and 
interference with opioid mediated analgesia are summarised in Table 16 and Table 
17.

Important Potential Risk 
Haemodynamic changes potentially leading to serious cardiovascular events 
(including effects on blood pressure and syncope) 
Potential mechanisms 
Cardiovascular effects were observed in the dog telemetry study and were 
limited to moderate decreases in arterial blood pressure, left ventricular 
systolic pressure and indices of cardiac contractility. The NOAEL for these 
effects was at 5mg/kg and an exposure (maximum concentration [Cmax]) 
comparable to human exposure at the MRHD. 
The mechanism for this pre-clinical finding is currently unknown. Of note, the 
effects of naloxegol on contractility parameters in canine ventricular myocytes 
were investigated at 0.1, 1, 10 and 100 μmol/L.  Draft data show that 
naloxegol had no effect on cardiac myocyte contractility at any of the 
concentrations tested, suggesting this finding might not be due to direct effects 
of naloxegol on the cardiac contractility. 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Non-clinical studies, clinical studies and potential class effect. 
Syncope 
Across the Phase III studies during the treatment periods (N=2134), 6 patients 
reported an AE of syncope, and 1 patient reported pre-syncope. All 7 patients 
were randomised to naloxegol with 2/7 patients on the 12.5 mg dose and 5/7 
patients on the 25 mg dose. The single report of pre-syncope occurred on Day 
55 in conjunction with an AE of “infection.” 
Serious CV SAEs 
A total of 68 unique events of CV SAEs and potentially relevant CV AEs (23 
AEs in 18/700 patients who received placebo or usual-care (UC) and 45 AEs 
in 36/1386 patients who received naloxegol) for 54 unique patients were 
submitted to the Cardiovascular-Event Adjudication Committee (CV-EAC) for 
adjudication. Of these, 10 events in 9 patients were adjudicated as MACE. 
Major adverse cardiovascular events were identified as possible risks due to a 
potential CV safety signal (myocardial ischaemia) reported from a long-term 
safety study of alvimopan, another peripherally acting opioid antagonist. 
However, no biologically plausible mechanism for increased cardiovascular 
toxicity has been identified. 
The overall incidence of adjudicated MACE was low and similar across 
treatment groups both in the placebo-controlled studies and in the randomised, 
long-term safety study. The incidence of MACE adjudicated by the CV-EAC 
as meeting formal diagnostic criteria was 0.6% (9/700 patients) for placebo or 
UC versus 0.4% (5/1386 patients) for naloxegol.

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Case reports of cardiovascular events have been noted in clinical studies 
and post marketing experience. The serious cardiovascular events reported 
were hypertension, hypotension, cerebrovascular accident, myocardial 
infarction, syncope and dyspnoea. More than half of these cases were 
reported as serious with several resulting in a fatal outcome. A causal 
association between naloxegol and serious CV events could not be 
established based on review of cases from clinical trials and post-marketing 
setting. 
Based on a post-hoc assessment of CV risk, two thirds of the patients had at 
least 1 CV risk factor and one third of the patients had CV disease, diabetes, or 
≥2 CV risk factors consistent with the minimally restrictive nature of the 
eligibility criteria. Patients with a history of hypertension may be at increased 
risk for hypertension with minimal difference compared to placebo. A history 
of syncope or use of concomitant antihypertensives or low baseline blood 
pressure appears to increase the risk of syncope. In a post-hoc analysis,1% 
patients taking an opioid dose ≥200 meu with naloxegol 25 mg experienced 
malignant hypertension or presyncope. There is also evidence from a post-hoc 
analysis that the risk for adverse cardiovascular events may also be higher in 
patients with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. In a post-hoc analysis of the 12-week pool, 
naloxegol 25-mg patients with a BMI≥ 30 kg/m2 (N=226 on naloxegol 25 mg/ 
N=216 on placebo) had the following frequencies of CV AEs: syncope and 
blood pressure increased (both 0.4% on naloxegol 25 mg vs 0% on placebo), 
hypertension (1.8% vs 0.5%, respectively), hypotension (0.9% vs 0.5 %, 
respectively), and malignant hypertension, orthostatic hypotension, and 
accelerated hypertension (all 0.4% vs 0%, respectively). 
Preventability 
There is no information in the SmPC of naloxegol to prevent or minimize this 
potential risk. 
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Serious cardiovascular events require intervention and possible hospitalisation. 
If not adequately managed these events can result in disability or even death. 
Public health impact 
As the impact is to the treated population only, there is no public health 
impact. 
2.7.3.2.2  Pain due to reduced efficacy of the opioid in the absence of the opioid 
withdrawal syndrome 
Information concerning the risk of pain due to reduced efficacy of the opioid in the 
absence of the opioid withdrawal syndrome are summarised in Table 17.

Important Potential Risk 
Interference with opioid mediated analgesia 
Potential mechanisms 
As a μ-opioid antagonist, PEGylated naloxegol has been designed to not enter 
the CNS at the dose range anticipated for clinical use. 
Evidence source(s) and 
strength of evidence 
Characterisation of the 
risk 
Theoretically, disruption of the Blood-Brain Barrier (BBB) could allow access 
of naloxegol into the CNS, with interference with opioid mediated analgesia 
resulting in increased pain. Some patients appear to be dependent on 
peripheral opioid receptors for analgesia and blockade of these receptors 
decreases the opioid analgesic effect. Evidence suggests that the peripheral 
opioid receptors play a particularly important role in the presence of 
inflammation. 
In an invitro pre-clinical study, the dose required to reduce analgesia was 2.4 
times greater than dose required to reduce the constipation. Clinical trials 
show a higher incidence of pain events in naloxegol group vs standard of care 
group. In the Phase III long-term study (52 weeks), the frequency of 
pain-related AEs (N=481 on naloxegol 25 mg/ N=240 on UC) in naloxegol 25 
mg compared to UC were as follows: back pain (8.9% on naloxegol 25 mg vs 
8.8% on UC), pain in extremity (3.5% vs. 3.3%, respectively), fibromyalgia 
(2.1% vs 1.3%, respectively), osteoarthritis (1.5% vs 1.3%, respectively), 
neuralgia (1.0% vs 0.8%, respectively), and cervical neuritis, drug effect 
decreased, and cervical radiculitis (all 0.2% vs 0%, respectively). In clinical 
trials opioid withdrawal occurred uncommonly in the absence of a blood- 
brain-barrier disruption; peripheral decreases in analgesic effect may be 
occurring in a few post-marketing cases since opioid withdrawal is not 
reported nor are any symptoms. 
All of the pain events in clinical studies were non-serious. Most patients 
recover from the pain event. In some cases, the patients recover during 
treatment with naloxegol; some patients recover after the naloxegol is 
discontinued. It is unlikely that the patients who recovered during treatment in 
the clinical trials were experiencing pain due to naloxegol’s peripheral 
antagonism of opioid analgesia. Most patients who have opioid withdrawal 
induced by naloxegol do not have reversal of analgesia or decreased opioid 
effect suggesting that the patients are experiencing peripheral opioid 
withdrawal. 
A review of the naloxegol drug safety database identified few cases of events 
of increased pain or decreased opioid efficacy in the absence of the opioid 
withdrawal syndrome. The majority of reported pain events were non-
serious.  
Post-hoc analysis and spontaneous reports suggest that naloxegol may rarely 
contribute to increased pain in some patients in the absence of the opioid 
withdrawal syndrome. In general, events such as increased pain are not 
associated with appreciable morbidity or mortality.  Most cases were mild to 
moderate in intensity. A review of spontaneous reports where an outcome is 
provided indicate that generally naloxegol is discontinued and the patient 
recovers.

Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Preventability 
There is evidence that the incidence of opioid drug withdrawal and possibly 
decreased opioid effect may be higher with the use of methadone than other 
opioid agonists, but this comparison has not been directly made. The incidence 
of withdrawal with methadone has only been compared to placebo in post hoc 
analyses. In a post-hoc analysis of the 12-week pool, naloxegol 25-mg patients 
receiving methadone therapy as their primary therapy for chronic pain 
conditions had low frequencies of pain-related AEs (event included if 
frequency was numerically higher in naloxegol 25 mg than placebo), such as 
back pain (3.7 % on naloxegol 25 mg vs 3.4% on placebo) and peripheral 
neuropathy (3.7% vs 0%, respectively). There is also evidence from post-hoc 
analysis that the risk of opioid withdrawal and possibly decreased analgesic 
efficacy may be higher when an opioid dose is ≥200 meu and the patient has 
BMI ≥30 kg/m2. The incidence of pain events also appears to be higher in 
patients using naloxegol long-term versus 12 weeks. Spontaneous reports 
suggest that reduced opioid efficacy occurs with all opioids. There is 
insufficient information to determine whether the severity is greater with 
methadone. 
The SmPC notes that reversal of analgesic effect may occur in 2 situations in 
the presence of a condition associated with a disrupted blood-brain barrier 
(Section 4.4, Special warnings and special precautions for use) or overdose 
(Section 9). 
Impact on the risk-benefit 
balance of the product 
Impact is that naloxegol may require cessation of therapy and the OIC may 
recur. 
Public health impact 
As the impact is to the treated population only, there is no public health 
impact. 
2.7.3.3  Presentation of missing information 
The missing information of use in high risk CV patients, safety beyond one year of 
exposure, use in methadone-treated patients, use                    in pregnancy and lactation, use in 
patients over 75 years of age, use in patients with                    severe renal impairment and use 
in patients with severe hepatic impairment are summarised in Table 18, Table 19, 
Table 20, Table 21, Table 22, Table 23 and Table 24 respectively.

Missing information 
Use in high risk CV patients 
Evidence source 
There is insufficient information to determine if the safety profile in this 
population/utilisation is different to that of the general target population 
however due to medical judgement there is a concern that these patients may 
be at risk because of the preclinical findings in the dog and the fact that in 
some studies the incidence of cardiovascular events such as hypotension, 
hypertension, syncope, malignant hypertension and accelerated hypertension 
were higher than seen with usual care or a placebo.

further characterisation 
Data for use in high risk CV patients is being collected in PASS study

Information concerning the missing information of safety beyond one year of 
exposure are summarised in Table 19.

Missing information 
Safety beyond one year of exposure 
Evidence source 
There is very little experience in patients exposed to naloxegol for longer than 
1 year. As of 15-Sep-2021, there were only a few cases identified with use >1 
year and the reports were all non-serious. No controlled study has been 
conducted. 
It is unknown how long naloxegol will continue to work or if there are risks 
associated with use greater than 1 year.

2.7.3.3.3  Use in methadone-treated patients 
Information concerning the missing information of use in methadone-treated 
patients are summarised in Table 20. 
Table 20: Missing information – Use in methadone-treated patients 
Missing information 
Use in methadone-treated patients 
Evidence source 
Patients taking methadone as primary therapy for their pain condition were 
observed in clinical trials to have a higher frequency of gastrointestinal 
adverse reactions (such as abdominal pain and diarrhoea) than patients not 
receiving methadone. In a few cases, symptoms suggestive of opioid 
withdrawal when taking naloxegol 25 mg were observed in patients taking 
methadone for their pain condition. This was observed in a higher proportion 
of patients taking methadone than those not taking methadone. Patients taking 
methadone for treatment of opioid addiction were not included in the clinical 
development programme and use of naloxegol in these patients should be 
approached with caution. 
2.7.3.3.4  Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Information concerning the missing information of use in pregnancy and lactation are summarised 
in Table 21. 
Table 21: Missing information – Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Missing information 
Use in pregnancy and lactation 
Evidence source 
Pregnancy 
There are limited data from the use of naloxegol in pregnant women. Studies 
in animals have shown reproductive toxicity where systemic exposures were 
several times above the therapeutic exposure level (see section 5.3). There is a 
theoretical potential for provoking opioid withdrawal in the foetus with use of 
an opioid receptor antagonist in the mother, who is being treated with a 
concurrent opioid. Naloxegol use is therefore not recommended during 
pregnancy. 
Lactation 
It is unknown whether naloxegol is excreted in human milk. Available 
toxicological data in rats have shown naloxegol excreted in milk (see 
section 5.3). At therapeutic doses, most opioids (e.g. morphine, meperidine, 
methadone) are excreted into breast milk in minimal amounts. There is a 
theoretical possibility that naloxegol could provoke opioid withdrawal in a 
breast-fed neonate whose mother is taking an opioid receptor agonist. 
Therefore, use in nursing mothers is not recommended.

2.7.3.3.5  Use in patients over 75 years of age 
Information concerning the missing information of use in patients over 75 years of 
age are summarised in Table 22. 
Table 22: Missing information – Use in patients over 75 years of age 
Missing information 
Use in patients over 75 years of age 
Evidence source 
There is a small effect of age on the pharmacokinetics of naloxegol 
(approximately 0.7% increase in AUC for every year increase in age). No dose 
adjustment is recommended for elderly patients. Patients over 65 years of age 
have been represented in the phase III studies. Clinical studies of naloxegol 
did not include sufficient numbers of patients aged 75 years or over to 
determine whether they respond differently from younger patients, however, 
based on the mode of action of the active substance there are no theoretical 
reasons for any requirement for dose adjustments in this age group. 
2.7.3.3.6  Use in patients with severe renal impairment 
Information concerning the missing information of use in patients with severe renal 
impairment are summarised in Table 23. 
Table 23: Missing information – Use in patients with severe renal impairment 
Missing information 
Use in patients with severe renal impairment 
Evidence source 
As renal clearance is a minor route of elimination for naloxegol, regardless of 
severity (i.e. moderate, severe and end stage renal failure), the impact of renal 
impairment on the pharmacokinetics of naloxegol was minimal in most 
subjects. However, in 2 out of 8 patients (in both the moderate and severe 
renal impairment groups but not in the end stage renal failure group) up to 
10-fold increases in the exposure of naloxegol were observed. In these patients 
renal impairment may adversely affect other clearance pathways (hepatic/gut 
drug metabolism, etc.) resulting in higher exposure. The starting dose for 
patients with moderate or severe renal insufficiency is 12.5 mg. If side effects 
impacting tolerability occur, naloxegol should be discontinued. The dose can 
be increased to 25 mg if 12.5 mg is well tolerated by the patient (see 
section 4.2). Exposure of naloxegol in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients 
on hemodialysis was similar to healthy volunteers with normal renal function.

Use in patients with severe hepatic impairment 
Evidence source 
Less than 20% decrease in AUC and 10% decrease in Cmax were observed in 
patients with mild and moderate hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class A and 
B). Effect of severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh Class C) on the 
pharmacokinetics of nalogexol was not evaluated. Use in patients with severe 
hepatic impairment is not recommended.

Study Population: 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the overall risk of major adverse 
Cardio Vascular (CV) events (ie, CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, 
non-fatal stroke and MACE) among naloxegol treated patients compared to that 
among patients on prescription non-peripherally acting μ-opioid antagonist OIC 
treatment. 
A retrospective new-user cohort design is used to assess the risk of MACE in 
persons receiving naloxegol or comparison medication (lubiprostone or 
linaclotide). 
Patients 18 years of age or older without a prior diagnosis of cancer and who 
receive chronic opioid treatment. Subjects will be identified from 2015–2020, 
using data from HealthCore (HC) and the US Veterans Health Administration 
(VHA).

Routine risk minimisation activities 
Opioid withdrawal syndrome 
Routine risk communication: 
SmPC Section 4.4, Special warnings and special precautions for use 
states this identified event is more likely to occur in patients with 
disrupted blood-brain barrier 
PIL Section,4 Possible side effects- up to 1% of patients experience 
opioid withdrawal and describes the side effects of opioid withdrawal 
Routine risk minimisation activities recommending specific clinical 
measures to address the risk: 
SmPC Section 4.4 recommends caution when prescribing naloxegol to 
patients with clinically important disruptions to the blood-brain barrier, 
taking into account their individual benefit-risk balance with observation 
for potential CNS effects, such as symptoms of opioid withdrawal. 
SmPC Section 4.9, Overdose recommends that patients who have an 
overdose of naloxegol be monitored closely for potential evidence of 
opioid withdrawal symptoms. 
PIL Section 2, Take special care before taking naloxegol if the natural 
protective barrier between the blood vessels in the head and in the brain 
is damaged, such as after a recent brain injury, or if you have a disease of 
the central nervous system like multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer’s Disease

Routine risk minimisation activities recommending specific clinical 
measures to address the risk: 
SmPC Section 4.4 Special warnings and special precautions for use 
advises patients to promptly report severe, persistent or worsening GI 
symptoms to their physician. Consideration may be given to lowering the 
dose to 12.5 mg in patients experiencing severe GI events. 
PIL Section 2, Take special care before taking naloxegol if you have you 
currently have severe or persistent stomach pain and/or diarrhoea or are 
taking methadone; if: you develop severe or persistent stomach pain 
and/or diarrhoea contact your physician 
PIL Section 4, Possible side effects- Tell your doctor immediately if you 
have severe or persistent stomach pain and or diarrhoea.

Haemodynamic changes potentially 
leading to serious cardiovascular 
events (including effects on blood 
pressure and syncope) 
Routine risk communications: 
SmPC Section 4.2 states that no dose adjustment is necessary for 
concomitant use of naloxegol with dual Pgp/weak CYP3A4 inhibitors 
SmPC Section 4.3 states that concomitant use with dual Pgp/strong 
CYP3A4 inhibitors can significantly increase exposure to naloxegol and 
is contraindicated. 
SmPC Section 4.4 reinforces the warnings included in Section 4.2 In 
addition it states that grapefruit has been classified as a CYP3A4 
inhibitor. No data is available of the concomitant use of naloxegol and 
grapefruit, so it is recommended that concomitant use is avoided and 
considered only in consultation with a healthcare provider. 
SmPC Section 4.5 includes a summary of the data available relating to 
this risk including that grapefruit has been classified as a potent CYP3A4 
inhibitor when consumed in large quantities. No data is available of the 
concomitant use of naloxegol and grapefruit, so it is recommended that 
concomitant use is avoided and considered only in consultation with a 
healthcare provider. 
PIL Section 2 warns that naloxegol should not be taken if the patient is 
taking other medications such as ketoconazole or itraconazole (to treat 
fungal infections), clarithromycin or telithromycin (antibiotics) or 
ritonavir, indinavir or saquinavir (to treat HIV). It also warns that 
patients should not drink large amounts of grapefruit juice whilst taking 
naloxegol. 
Routine risk minimisation activities recommending specific clinical 
measures to address the risk: 
SmPC Section 4.2 details recommends patients concomitantly taking 
moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors or dual Pgp/moderate CYP3A4 inhibitors 
should start on a dose of 12.5 mg, which can be increased to 25 mg if

PART VI: SUMMARY OF THE RISK MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR 
MOVENTIG 
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Moventig. The RMP 
details important risks of Moventig, how these risks can be minimised, and how 
more information will be obtained about Moventig’s risks and uncertainties 
(missing information). 
Moventig's Summary of Product Characteristics (SmPC), (which is the prescribing 
information) and its Package Leaflet (PL) give essential information to healthcare 
professionals and patients on how Moventig should be used. 
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of the Moventig RMP. 
6.1 
The medicine and what it is used for 
Moventig is authorised for the treatment of Opioid-Induced Constipation (OIC) in 
adult patients who have had an inadequate response to laxative(s) (see SmPC for the 
full indication). It contains naloxegol as the active substance and it is given by the 
oral route. 
Further information about the evaluation of Moventig’s benefits can be found in 
Moventig’s EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA 
website, under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/moventig 
6.2 
Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimise or further 
characterise the risks 
Important risks of Moventig, together with measures to minimise such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about Moventig’s risks, are outlined below. 
Measures to minimise the risks identified for medicinal products can be: 
•  Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals; 
•  Important advice on the medicine’s packaging; 
•  The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so 
to ensure that the medicine is used correctly; 
•  The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimise its risks. 
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimisation measures. 
64 of 96 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In addition to these measures, information about adverse reactions is collected 
continuously and regularly analysed so that immediate action can be taken as 
necessary. These measures constitute routine pharmacovigilance activities. 
If important information that may affect the safe use of Moventig is not yet 
available, it is listed under ‘missing information’ below. 
6.2.1 
List of important risks and missing information 
Important risks of Moventig are risks that need special risk management activities 
to further investigate or minimise the risk, so that the medicinal product can be 
safely taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified 
risks are concerns for which there is sufficient proof of a link with the use of 
Moventig. Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this 
medicine is possible based on available data, but this association has not been 
established yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to 
information on the safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and 
needs to be collected (e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine). 
A summary of the important risks and missing information for Moventig is 
provided in Table 30.

Non-clinical studies confirmed that naloxegol is metabolised mainly by CYP3A4 
and is a substrate of P-gp. Drugs that modulate CYP3A4 and P-gp activities are 
likely to influence the pharmacokinetics of Moventig. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
Risk minimisation 
measures 
Use of Moventig with medicines that are cleared from the body in the same way as 
Moventig may result in either an increase in Moventig levels in the blood, with 
possible increase in side effects, or a decrease of Moventig levels in the blood, with 
possible loss of effectiveness. 
Routine risk communications: 
SmPC Section 4.2 states that no dose adjustment is necessary for concomitant use of 
Moventig with dual Pgp/weak CYP3A4 inhibitors 
SmPC Section 4.3 states that concomitant use with dual Pgp/strong CYP3A4

SmPC Section 4.5 includes a summary of the data available relating to this risk 
including that grapefruit has been classified as a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor when 
consumed in large quantities. No data is available of the concomitant use of

Important potential risk – Haemodynamic changes potentially leading to serious cardiovascular events 
(including effects on blood pressure and syncope) 
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the medicine 
Post-marketing experience with alvimopan,(another peripheral opioid receptor 
antagonist), preclinical evidence and clinical trials 
Serious CV SAEs 
A total of 68 unique events of CV SAEs and potentially relevant CV AEs (23 AEs 
in 18/700 patients who received placebo or UC and 45 AEs in 36/1386 patients who 
received Moventig) for 54 unique patients were submitted to the Cardiovascular- 
Event Adjudication Committee (CV-EAC) for adjudication. Of these, 10 events in 9 
patients were adjudicated as MACE. Major adverse cardiovascular events were 
identified as possible risks due to a potential CV safety signal (myocardial 
ischaemia) reported from a long-term safety study of alvimopan, another 
peripherally acting opioid antagonist.  However, no biologically plausible 
mechanism for increased cardiovascular toxicity has been identified. 
Risk factors and risk 
groups 
A post-hoc assessment of CV risk found two thirds of the patients had at least 1 CV 
risk factor and one third of the patients had CV disease, diabetes, or ≥2 CV risk

D3820R00008: United States Post-Marketing Observational Cardiovascular Safety Study in 
Patients Taking Naloxegol. 
Purpose of the study: 
The purpose of the study is to collect data and assess rates regarding the overall risk of major 
adverse cardiovascular events in naloxegol-treated patients compared to patients on 
prescription non-peripherally acting μ-opioid antagonist OIC treatment. 
Rationale and study objectives: 
A retrospective new-user cohort design is used to assess the risk of MACE in persons 
receiving naloxegol or comparison medication (lubiprostone or linaclotide). 
The primary objective of this study is to assess the overall risk of major adverse 
Cardiovascular (CV) events (ie, CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke 
and MACE) among naloxegol-treated patients compared to that among patients on 
prescription non-peripherally acting mu-opioid antagonist OIC treatment. 
Patients 18 years of age or older without a prior diagnosis of cancer and who receive chronic 
opioid treatment. Subjects will be identified from 2015–2020, using data from HealthCore 
(HC) and the US Veterans Health Administration (VHA).

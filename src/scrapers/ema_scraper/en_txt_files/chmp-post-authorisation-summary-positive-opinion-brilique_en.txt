EMA/CHMP/730883/2015  
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) 
Summary of opinion1 (post authorisation) 
Brilique 
ticagrelor 
On 17 December 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion recommending changes to the terms of the marketing authorisation for the medicinal product 
Brilique. The marketing authorisation holder for this medicinal product is AstraZeneca AB. 
The CHMP adopted a new indication and a change to the existing indication as follows2:  
“Brilique, co-administered with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), is indicated for the prevention of atherothrombotic 
events in adult patients with 
• 
acute coronary syndromes (ACS) (unstable angina, non ST elevation myocardial infarction [NSTEMI] or 
ST elevation myocardial infarction [STEMI]); including patients managed medically, and those who are 
managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG) or 
•  a history of myocardial infarction (MI) and a high risk of developing an atherothrombotic 
event (see sections 4.2 and 5.1).” 
As the recommended dose for patients with a history of MI is 60 mg twice daily, the CHMP also 
recommended extending the marketing authorisation to include 60 mg film-coated tablets. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the updated summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the revised European public assessment report (EPAR), 
and will be available in all official European Union languages after a decision on this change to the marketing 
authorisation has been granted by the European Commission.

are issued for all other procedures. 
2 A Commission decision (CD) is issued for procedures that affect the terms of the marketing authorisation (e.g. summary of product characteristics, annex II, labelling, package leaflet). The 
CD is issued within two months of the opinion for variations falling under the scope of Article 23.1a(a) of Regulation (EU) No. 712/2012, or within one year for other procedures.

conditions for biological medicinal products, when the 
stability studies have not been performed in 
accordance with an approved stability protocol 
controlled and validated aseptic conditions by adequately 
trained staff. Under these conditions, chemical and physical 
stability has been demonstrated for 24 hours at 25°C when 
stored in a 50 ml syringe (polypropylene). If not used 
immediately, the conditions prior to use are the 
responsibility of the user and the in-use storage time must 
not be longer than as stated above.

a PSUR review by the CHMP, and a MAH safety analysis to 
their own database including clinical trials and Post 
Marketing Experience data the MAH updated section 4.8 
and section 4.9. 
In sections 4.6 the paragraph regarding lactation was 
amended as follows:  
It is unknown whether rFVIIa is excreted in human breast 
milk. The excretion of rFVIIa in milk has not been studied 
in animals. A decision on whether to continue/discontinue 
breast-feeding or to continue/discontinue therapy with 
NovoSeven should be made taking into account the benefit 
of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of NovoSeven 
therapy to the woman.  
An updated number of cases of overdose was introduced in 
section 4.9 with other minor modifications.  
Finally section 4.8 was completely revised in accordance 
with the safety analysis of post marketing and clinical trials 
as well as the current SmPC guideline recommendations. In 
particular, the table listing undesirable effects was revised 
both for frequency and nature of adverse drug reactions 
mentioned.  
Specific subsections were also introduced under the table in 
section 4.8. In particular, a higher risk of arterial 
thrombotic events observed from a meta-analysis of pooled 
data from placebo controlled trials was added in section 
4.8, with a clear statement that NovoSeven should not be 
used outside the approved indications.  
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly.

formulation involves the introduction of two new excipients. 
Furthermore, in order to facilitate the calculation of the 
dose needed for the individual patient, the drug product 
presentations of the new formulation will comprise three 
single use vials of 1, 2, and 5 mg of lyophilized rFVIIa per 
vial. Reconstitution with the appropriate volumne of the 
Histidine solvent will provide 1.0 mg rFVIIa/ml for each 
strength. Comparative characterisation studies confirmed 
that the change in formulation does not lead to changes in 
the physical and chemical characteristics of rFVIIa. 
There are no changes of indications, dose 
recommendations, undesirable effects or warnings and 
precautions, as compared to the current formulation of 
NovoSeven. 
Overall, based on the available data, the benefit/risk of the 
new formulation of NovoSeven was considered positive.  
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having 
considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that 
pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of 
routine pharmacovigilance were needed to investigate 
further some of the safety concerns and that additional risk

The MAH applied for a type II variation to update section 
5.2 Pharmacokinetic properties of the SPC based on the 
results from two pharmacokinetic studies.  
The pharmacokinetics of NovoSeven were investigated in 
35 healthy Caucasian and Japanese healthy subjects. The 
pharmacokinetic profiles indicated dose proportionality and 
were similar across sex and ethnic groups.  
In a study in 12 paediatric (2-12 years) and 5 adult 
patients with haemophilia A and B with inhibitors in non 
bleeding state, dose proportionality was established in 
children for the investigated doses of 90 and 180 ?g per kg 
body weight. Mean clearance was approximately 50% 
higher in paediatric patients relative to adults and 
increased towards a lower age.  
Consequently, section 4.2 of the SPC was updated with 
regards to dosing information in children as follows: 
"Dosing in children 
Current clinical experience does not warrant a general 
differentiation in dosing between children and adults, 
although children have faster clearance than adults. 
Therefore, higher doses of rFVIIa may be needed in 
paediatric patients to achieve similar plasma concentrations 
as in adult patients (see section 5.2)." 
Minor editorial changes to the SPC are also included.

recommendation. In addition to the current 
recommendation of 90  g /kg, which may be repeated as 
required, a single dose of 270  g/kg/body weight is 
recommended for the treatment of mild to moderate 
bleeding episodes in haemophilia A or B patients with 
inhibitors to factor VIII or factor IX in order to achieve 
rapid haemostasis and reduce the number of injections. 
This is based on clinical data from 2 double-blind clinical 
studies and relevant literature data. 
The section 4.4 is updated with a warning for the elderly 
population since there is no clinical experience in this 
population. 
The PL is updated accordingly.

MAH. The MAH proposed a new vial adaptor to facilitate the 
transfer of water from the solvent vial to the NovoSeven 
vial. 
The change of device concerns a substitution of the current 
transfer needle with a needle-free vial adaptor for the 
reconstitution process of NovoSeven. Due to different size 
of the proposed vial, the dimensions of the outer packaging 
box are changed. Moreover, in the redesigned packaging

box the current plastic tray is replaced by a carton tray, 
and a separate inner-carton for the powder and solvent 
vials is introduced for the fixation of the vials.  
As a consequence of the changes, the SPC and PIL have 
also been adapted. 
The MAH proposed a new vial adaptor to facilitate the 
transfer of water from the solvent vial to the NovoSeven 
vial. This change aims to improve the current reconstitution 
procedure preventing  the risk of the current transfer 
needle with stick injuries in patients and health care 
professionals.  Changes related to the reconstitution 
procedure are included in the package leaflet. Pictures have 
also been added to make the description of the 
reconstitution procedure more user-friendly. 
On the basis of the information provided by the MAH, the 
CHMP recomended the aproval of the new proposed vial 
adaptor and the change on the dimensions of the 
packaging box.

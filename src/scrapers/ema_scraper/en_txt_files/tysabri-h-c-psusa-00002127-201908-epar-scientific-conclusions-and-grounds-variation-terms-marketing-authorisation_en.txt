Scientific conclusions 
Taking into account the PRAC Assessment Report on the PSUR(s) for natalizumab, the scientific 
conclusions of CHMP are as follows: 
The MAH conducted a retrospective analysis on the impact of plasma exchange/plasmapheresis (PLEX) on 
the outcome (2-year survival post-PML) of natalizumab-associated progressive multifocal 
leukoencephalopathy (PML). This analysis suggested that PLEX is not associated with a statistically 
significant effect on survival and appears to have no impact on improving post-PML outcomes. As PLEX is 
frequently used in clinical practise for treatment of PML, PRAC agreed that physicians should be informed 
about the new data on PLEX via an update of the sections 4.4 and 5.2 of the SmPC. 
Further, the MAH proposed updating the adverse drug reaction (ADR) frequencies of some adverse events 
(from “common” to “very common”) in the section 4.8 of SmPC and Package Leaflet. The changes in ADR 
frequencies are to correct typographical errors and are considered acceptable. 
The CHMP agrees with the scientific conclusions made by the PRAC. 
Grounds for the variation to the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) 
On the basis of the scientific conclusions for natalizumab the CHMP is of the opinion that the benefit-risk 
balance of the medicinal product(s) containing natalizumab is unchanged subject to the proposed changes 
to the product information 
The CHMP recommends that the terms of the marketing authorisation(s) should be varied.

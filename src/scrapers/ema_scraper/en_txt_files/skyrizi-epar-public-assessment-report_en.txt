2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
The risankizumab psoriasis clinical development program designed to support the proposed indication 
included 4 pivotal Phase 3 studies of the dose and dosing regimen (risankizumab 150 mg subcutaneous 
[SC] injection at Weeks 0, 4, and every 12 weeks [q12w] thereafter) in adults who had stable moderate 
to severe chronic plaque psoriasis ≥ 6 months (with or without psoriatic arthritis), defined as body surface 
area (BSA) involvement ≥ 10%; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥ 12; Static Physician 
Global Assessment (sPGA) ≥ 3. 
The proposed indication is for treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis when systemic treatment 
is needed. 
The route of administration is subcutaneous.  Risankizumab is intended for use under the guidance and 
supervision of a physician experienced in the diagnosis and treatment of psoriasis. After training in 
subcutaneous injection technique, patients may self-inject if deemed appropriate. 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Psoriasis is a chronic debilitating immunologic disease characterized by marked inflammation and 
thickening of the epidermis that result in thick, scaly plaques involving the skin. In most developed 
countries, prevalence is between 1.5 and 5%. 
Psoriasis may be classified according to morphologic and clinical presentation: plaque psoriasis, guttate 
psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis, generalized pustular and localized pustular psoriasis, and inverse or 
intertriginous psoriasis. 
Plaque psoriasis is the most common form, affecting approximately 80% to 90% of patients. In patients 
with plaque psoriasis, approximately 80% have mild to moderate disease, with 20% having moderate to 
severe disease. Nails of hands and feet are often involved. Nail psoriasis, which has an estimated 
prevalence of 50% in patients with plaque psoriasis, presents a spectrum of challenges to patients: pain 
associated with nail bed hyperkeratosis, functional deficits caused by nail plate crumbling and 
onycholysis, and cosmetic disfigurement, leading to poor self-image and social stigmatization. 
Psoriatic arthritis occurs in 30% or more of patients with psoriasis and involves joint pain and destruction, 
and patients with psoriatic arthritis have reduced quality of life (QoL) and functional capacity compared 
with psoriasis patients or healthy controls. 
The uncontrolled inflammation of psoriasis may contribute to commonly associated comorbidities, 
including cardiovascular (CV) disease (including hypertension and increased risk for myocardial 
infarction, stroke, and CV death), obesity, type 2 diabetes, arthritis, and chronic renal disease. Psoriasis 
is also associated with serious psychiatric comorbidities, including depression, anxiety, and suicidality, as 
well as substance abuse. 
Topical corticosteroids are commonly used for mild to moderate cases. Other topical medications include 
keratolytic agents, anthralin, coal tar, vitamin D analogs, and retinoids. For more widespread disease, 
phototherapy (ultraviolet B [UVB] or psoralen with ultraviolet A [PUVA]) is commonly used. 
Systemic therapy, including methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine, synthetic retinoids, and fumaric acid are 
often effective in patients with moderate or severe disease. Due to the potential adverse side effects of 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 12/181 
 
 
 
systemic agents, these medications are generally administered in rotation to avoid long-term or 
cumulative toxicities. 
Biologics have emerged as a promising alternative treatment option for patients with Psoriasis and are 
increasingly being used as first line systemic treatment options. 
Anti-TNF agents such as etanercept, adalimumab, and infliximab are approved for the treatment of 
moderate to severe psoriasis.  Ustekinumab, a p40 IL 12/23 inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of 
moderate to severe psoriasis. While the clinical efficacy of ustekinumab indicates a role for both IL-12 and 
IL-23 in the pathogenesis of psoriasis, more recent data suggest that IL-23 is disproportionately involved 
in the maintenance of chronic psoriasis. Guselkumab, an IL-23 inhibitor, was approved in the US in July 
2017 and in the EU in November 2017 for the treatment of adults with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis. 
In addition, brodalumab, ixekizumab, and secukinumab, which target IL-17, are approved for the 
treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. 
Psoriasis manifests in a wide range of severities, affecting 2 to 3% of the general population with 
significant variation by geographic location and age. The prevalence of psoriasis varies in the EU from 
0.6% to 8.5.  
2.1.2.   Aetiology pathogenesis and clinical presentation 
Psoriasis is a chronic, immune-mediated inflammatory disease characterized by the hyper proliferation of 
keratinocytes and skin-infiltrating T-lymphocytes that overexpress pro-inflammatory mediators. The 
disease is a chronic, painful immune-mediated inflammatory skin disease and has a lifelong remitting and 
relapsing course with varying factors that trigger exacerbations in susceptible individuals, thus making 
treatment challenging. Psoriasis is also associated with serious comorbidities and significant psychosocial 
disability with negative impacts on quality of life. The uncontrolled inflammation of psoriasis may 
contribute to commonly associated comorbidities, including cardiovascular (CV) disease (including 
hypertension and increased risk for myocardial infarction, stroke, and CV death), obesity, type 2 
diabetes, arthritis, and chronic renal disease. Psoriasis is also associated with serious psychiatric 
comorbidities, including depression, anxiety, and suicidality, as well as substance abuse.  
The current therapeutic options for moderate to severe plaque psoriasis include phototherapy, topical 
agents (e.g., corticosteroids), conventional systemic therapy (e.g., cyclosporine, methotrexate, and oral 
retinoids), and biologic therapy including TNF-α antagonists (adalimumab, etanercept, infliximab), 
anti-IL12/IL23 and anti-IL17 (ustekinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab).  
The conventional therapies are associated with dose- and treatment-limiting options. The most common 
reasons for discontinuation of these therapies are lack of efficacy, adverse events (AEs), and treatment 
inconvenience.  
The biologic agents have been associated with higher objective response rates in clinical trials. However, 
even with these newer agents, most patients do not achieve optimal efficacy, such as total skin clearance.  
Although newer treatment options provide improved outcomes compared with traditional systemic 
therapies, there remains a significant unmet patient need for novel agents and mechanisms that can 
provide a rapid onset of effect, improved and sustained skin clearance, and minimization of drug-specific 
safety concerns (e.g. serious infections including opportunistic infections and tuberculosis, malignancies 
including lymphoma, immunogenicity and demyelinating neurologic events).

EMA/191996/2019  
Page 13/181 
 
 
 
2.1.3.  Management 
The primary goal of psoriasis therapies is clearance of psoriatic plaques. Milder forms of psoriasis are 
typically managed with topical therapies, while more extensive or severe forms of psoriasis are typically 
managed with phototherapy or systemic therapy, which includes small molecules, usually given orally, 
and biologics, which are large molecules usually given by injection or infusion.  
In clinical practice, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists were the first biological therapies approved 
for psoriasis and represent a current treatment option for moderate-to-severe chronic plaque psoriasis. 
Ustekinumab (human IgG1 /κ monoclonal antibody against the p40 subunit of both IL-12 and IL-23 
cytokines), secukinumab (human IgG1 monoclonal antibody against IL-17A), and ixekizumab (human 
IgG4 monoclonal antibodies against IL-17A cytokine) have also been approved for the treatment of 
patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in patients who are candidates for phototherapy or 
systemic therapy.  
There are a small proportion of subjects who require biologic therapy due to a variety of reasons including 
lack of effectiveness, inadequate response or intolerant to conventional therapy. Many subjects do not 
achieve adequate response, as defined by subjects achieving at least a 75% improvement in Psoriasis 
Area and Severity Index (PASI) score (PASI 75), with anti-TNF agents and find that current therapies can 
lose efficacy over time. Another concern is as this is a chronic condition compliance in psoriasis patients 
is found generally to be poor. 
About the product 
Risankizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that is directed against 
IL-23 p19. The framework of the risankizumab antibody has been engineered with 2 mutations in the Fc 
region to reduce Fcγ receptor and complement binding. Binding of risankizumab to IL-23 p19 inhibits the 
action of IL-23 to induce and sustain T helper (Th) 17 type cells, innate lymphoid cells, γδT cells, and 
natural killer (NK) cells responsible for tissue inflammation, destruction and aberrant tissue repair.

available in packs containing 2 pre-filled syringes and 2 alcohol pads. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
General information 
Risankizumab is a humanized antibody which selectively binds to IL-23p19 and therefore inhibits binding 
of IL-23 to its receptor. Risankizumab is composed of two heterodimers of a heavy and a light polypeptide 
chain. Each heavy chain (HC) is composed of 449 amino acids and each light chain (LC) contains 214 
amino acids. The antibody molecule contains a total of 12 intra-chain disulfide bonds, four within each of 
the two HCs and two within each of the two LCs. The framework of the antibody has been engineered with 
two mutations in the Fc region, Leu234Ala and Leu235Ala to reduce the potential effector function. The 
C-terminal lysine of the heavy chain has been deleted to reduce potential charge heterogeneity. Each HC 
contains a single N-linked glycosylation site at asparagine 297. The Mw is 146 kDa. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Description of manufacturing process and process controls 
The active substance is manufactured at Boehringer Ingelheim Pharma GmbH & Co KG, Biberach an der 
Ris, Germany. Appropriate evidence of GMP certification has been provided for each site involved in active 
substance manufacturing and testing.  
The manufacture of risankizumab represents a standard manufacturing process for the manufacture of 
antibodies. It is achieved in three main parts, the upstream process, which produces the antibody, the 
downstream process, which purifies the antibody and the formulation of the active substance. 
The manufacturing process is well described in the dossier and details of in-process controls and process 
parameter normal operating ranges (NORs) and proven acceptable ranges (PARs) are listed for each 
manufacturing step. The critical process parameters (CPPs) and in-process controls (IPCs) are also 
indicated. 
Reprocessing is registered for certain unit operation steps. It was supported by data and appropriately 
justified. 
Each manufacturing step is described in sufficient detail and the appropriate controls are listed. The 
registered in-process controls are considered appropriate for control of a mAb. 
Control of materials 
Details of compendial and non-compendial raw materials are provided. Acceptable specifications are 
registered for all non-compendial raw materials. No materials of human or animal origin are used in the 
manufacture of the active substance. The viral risk arising from the use of cell line media, reagents and 
materials has been appropriately discussed and addressed. The qualitative composition of the media and 
supplements used in the manufacturing process has been registered. 
Details of developmental genetics and the establishment of the Master Cell bank (MCB) have been 
provided in line with ICH Q5B.  
Characterisation of the cell banks has been carried out in line with ICH Q5D. The MCB, WCB and PPCB 
were tested for adventitious agents in line with ICH Q5A.

Control of critical steps and intermediates 
Details of in-process controls (IPCs) and critical process parameters (CPPs) have been provided. IPCs are 
separated into those with action limits and those with specifications.For the upstream process, IPC action 
limits are registered. IPCs with specifications are registered only for the production bioreactor.For the 
downstream process, IPCs with action limits are registered for each manufacturing stepThere are no 
specification IPC limits for the downstream process, however taking into consideration the release 
specifications and the overall control strategy, this approach is accepted.  
CPPs are defined in line with ICH Q8 as parameters that have impact on CQAs. The CPPs with their 
respective PARs and associated NORs are provided and considered acceptable. Overall the control 
strategy in terms of CPPs and IPCs is considered acceptable to ensure adequate control of the active 
substance manufacturing process. Hold times are supported by appropriate data. 
Process validation 
Process validation PPQ runs were carried out on consecutive commercial scale batches. IPC and process 
parameter results, including CPPs and non-CPPs, have been provided for each manufacturing step for the 
PPQ batches. All process parameters were within the registered NORs and all IPC results were within 
registered limits. No non-conformance events were reported. Therefore, the process validation data show 
that the process is capable of consistently manufacturing active substance batches within the established 
control ranges.  
Impurity clearance data have been provided. Hold time data has been provided which supports the hold 
times registered. The currently available full scale resin and membrane lifetime data have been provided. 
Manufacturing process development 
A detailed description has been provided on the manufacturing process development, including the 
control strategy, manufacturing process history, process characterization studies, impurity clearance 
studies, and extractables and leachables assessment. 
Process characterisation studies (PCS) used a risk assessment approach to identify the process 
parameters to further study in scale down models. The ranges of process parameters were challenged in 
the scale down models to establish the PARs. The scale down models were shown to be representative of 
commercial scale using an equivalency test statistical approach. The final registered ranges of the PARs 
have been appropriately supported by data.  
Data has been provided in support of the resin reuse cycles. 
Characterisation 
The active substance has been sufficiently characterised by physicochemical and biological 
state-of-the-art methods revealing that the active substance has the expected structure of a humanized 
IgG1-type antibody. Studies were performed to characterize risankizumab with respect to primary 
structure, higher order structure, disulphide bonds, mass heterogeneity, charge heterogeneity, size 
heterogeneity, oligosaccharides, and biological function as well as structure/function relationships. 
Identity has been confirmed using adequate techniques.  
The applicant did not measure ADCC or CDC activity but has presented a reasonable argument as to why 
risankizumab is very unlikely to exhibit effector function. Risankizumab demonstrates comparable 
binding compared to the wild-type IgG1 reference molecule.  
In summary, the characterization is considered appropriate for this type of molecule.

standards has been described and is considered sufficient to prevent any potential future drift in potency 
between standards. A protocol for qualification of future reference standards is provided and is 
acceptable. 
Stability 
Stability data has been provided in support of the claimed shelf life. The stability studies were in general 
performed in accordance with ICH Q5C.  Overall the data provided support of the claimed shelf-life for 
active substance. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is supplied as a sterile solution in a single-use, prefilled syringe (75 mg risankizumab 
/ 0.83 ml) assembled into a needle stick protection (NSP) device. The finished product formulation 
consists of risankizumab as the active substance, sorbitol, disodium succinate hexahydrate, succinic acid, 
polysorbate 20 and water for injections. All excipients are compendial, complying with either Ph. Eur., 
USP/NF or JPE, and have been used in other centrally authorised parenteral medicinal products.  
The primary packaging is pre-filled glass syringe with a fixed needle and needle cover, assembled in an 
automatic needle guard. The material complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the 
container closure system has been validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the 
product. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is of compendial grade. There 
are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019

The quality target product profile and critical quality attributes (CQAs) of the finished product were 
outlined and are appropriate for a monoclonal antibody. 
Pharmaceutical development 
The robustness of the formulation has been adequately demonstrated.  
In addition, traceability of formulated product has been assured. 
The manufacturing process has changed during development. Comparability of process batches, 
characterisation testing and stability data are acceptable. Process characterisation was conducted. 
Product homogeneity is further assured by the results of PPQ data.  
An assessment of leachables and extractables from product contact material of the manufacturing 
process was conducted and it was concluded that the material poses no risk with regard to leachables. 
Some elemental impurities were identified but they were below the PDE limits as defined in ICH Q3D and 
therefore acceptable.  
A range of studies was conducted adequately demonstrating the functionality of the primary container 
closure system. No impurities of safety concern were identified from leachable, extractable or elemental 
analysis studies. The choice of primary container closure system is considered to be appropriately 
justified.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the 
product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use. No Major Objections were 
raised as regards the quality documentation. A number of deficiencies (Other Concerns) were observed 
but have been satisfactorily addressed. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the active substance and the finished 
product and their manufacturing process. A design space is claimed for the potency assay and 
multivariate ranges for several factors are registered for the method. The available data supports the 
proposed design space for the assay. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance 
of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has been presented 
to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends some points for investigation. 
The applicant shall review the specifications for the active substance and the finished product when 
sufficient number of batches have been released and tighten specification limits for potency, purity and 
impurity parameters if appropriate and justified. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Risankizumab  (INN)  is  a  humanised  immunoglobulin  G1  (IgG1)  monoclonal  antibody  that  selectively 
binds  with  high  affinity  to  the  p19  subunit  of  human  interleukin  23  (IL-23)  cytokine  and  inhibits  its 
interaction with the IL-23 receptor complex. IL-23 is a naturally occurring cytokine that is involved in 
inflammatory and immune responses.  
The applicant submitted a comprehensive non clinical package in support of human administration. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacodynamics 
Primary Pharmacodynamics 
Risankizumab specifically binds to the p19 subunit of IL-23 with high affinity, it does not bind to the p40 
subunit of IL-23 which is also a subunit of IL-12. The epitope was determined to be located within the p19 
subunit,  there  was  no  binding  observed  to  the  p40  subunit.  Also,  there  was  no  specific  effect  on  the 
on-rate or overall affinity of risankizumab in the presence of human serum. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 20/181 
 
 
 
 
 
In in vitro pharmacology assays risankizumab binds to human IL-23 with a dissociation constant (Kd) of 
≤ 29 pM. High affinity binding of risankizumab to cynomolgus monkey IL-23 was also demonstrated with 
a Kd of less than 1 pM. Risankizumab has a higher affinity for the p19 subunit of cynomolgus monkey 
IL-23 than the human p19 subunit of IL-23, however this may be due to the detection limit of the surface 
platon resonance (SPR) technology used.  
Binding is specific with no detectable binding to human IL-12 at a concentration of 1 μM. No binding to rat 
IL-23 was observed at concentrations of up to 1 μM, the same top concentration tested for human IL-12 
binding. Binding to mouse IL-23 was significantly decreased with a Kd of 15 nM.  
Risankizumab  inhibits  cynomolgus  monkey  and  human  IL-23  functions,  but  not  mouse  or  rat. 
Risankizumab potently inhibits human IL-23 induced phosphorylation of signal transducer and activator 
of transcription 3 (STAT3) in the human B lymphoblast cell line DB with an IC50 value of 24 pM.  
Additionally, risankizumab inhibits the induction of IL-17 by human and cynomolgus monkey IL-23 in 
mouse splenocytes, but does not inhibit the induction of interferon gamma (IFNγ) by human IL-12 in 
phytohaemagglutinin  (PHA)  blasts.  In  an  in  vivo  mouse  ear  thickening  model,  risankizumab  inhibits 
human IL-23-induced ear thickening as well as the induction of tissue IL-17 and IL-22. 
Secondary Pharmacodynamics 
Specific studies evaluating secondary pharmacodynamics of risankizumab have not been conducted. As a 
highly specific antibody against IL-23 the lack of secondary pharmacodynamics studies is acceptable. 
Safety Pharmacology  
Safety  pharmacology-related  endpoints  were  incorporated  into  the  two  Good  Laboratory  Practice 
repeat-dose cynomolgus monkey toxicology studies. Cardiovascular parameters evaluated included heart 
rate,  PR,  QRS,  RR,  QT  and  QTc  intervals.  Other  parameters  evaluated  included  clinical  observations, 
ophthalmology,  and  neurobehavioral  evaluations.  Risankizumab  did  not  demonstrate  any  effect  on 
neurological, respiratory, or cardiovascular function including electrocardiograms, in the four-week and 
26-week toxicology studies.  
Overall risankizumab is a highly potent and selective monoclonal antibody for the p19 subunit of IL-23, in 
both  cynomolgus  monkey  and  humans.  The  provided  non-clinical  pharmacology  package  can  be 
considered sufficient to support the marketing authorisation application in psoriasis patients. 
2.3.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
In the single- and 4 week repeat-dose studies in cynomolgus monkeys, a validated ELISA method was 
used  for  the  measurements  of  risankizumab.  In  the  remaining  repeat-dose  studies  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys the method was transferred to another analytical CRO and revalidated, the calibration range 
remained the same. Two validated ligand-binding ADA assays (first and second generation) were applied 
that used an electrochemiluminescence (ECL) detection principle. 
The risankizumab pharmacokinetic and immunogenic profile was characterized after a single intravenous 
or  subcutaneous  dose  in  female  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Repeat  dose  TK  was  evaluated  as  part  of  the 
toxicology studies in cynomolgus monkeys. The risankizumab pharmacokinetic profile after a single dose 
was typical of a monoclonal antibody, with low volumes of distribution (Vss 40.7 mL/kg), low clearance 
(CL 0.243 mL/hr/kg) and a long terminal elimination half-life of 173 hours (7.2 days) following a single 1 
mg/kg  intravenous  dose  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  The  terminal  half-life  following  a  1.5  mg/kg 
subcutaneous dose averaged 7.7 days, with 71.8% bioavailability. 
Two repeat dose studies characterized the risankizumab pharmacokinetics following weekly 5, 20 or 50 
mg/kg intravenous or subcutaneous administration. At treatment durations ranging from 4 to 26 weeks, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 21/181 
 
 
 
there  were  no  consistent  differences  in  exposure  between  male  and  female  monkeys.  Risankizumab 
exposures were roughly proportional to the administered doses, with accumulation in agreement with the 
observed half-life and dosing interval. In the 4-week study, systemic exposure of risankizumab following 
subcutaneous administration of 20 mg/kg was lower than that following intravenous administration at the 
same dose level, with a mean SC/IV AUC0-168hr ratio averaging approximately 45% in both Week 1 and 
Week 4. In the 26-week study where risankizumab was dosed at 5, 20 and 50 mg/kg SC, some degree of 
accumulation was observed. The Cmax and AUC0-168hr values of risankizumab in Weeks 4 and 26 were 
generally greater than those in Week 1; exposures in Week 26 were comparable to those in Week 4. No 
consistent difference in risankizumab exposure was observed between males and females in Weeks 1, 4 
and 26. 
Although the metabolic pathways of  therapeutic  mAbs  are  unknown,  the  expected  consequence  of  
metabolism  of  biotechnology derived mAbs is  the catabolism to small peptides and individual amino 
acids  in  the  same  manner    as    endogenous    IgG.    Therefore,  classical  biotransformation  studies  as 
performed for small molecule pharmaceuticals are not needed for therapeutic mAbs (ICH S6 [R1]). 
Following  single  administration  of  risankizumab  to  monkeys  and  humans,  differences  in  certain  PK 
parameters  were  observed.  Following  IV  infusion  of  1  mg/kg,  Cmax  of  61.4  μg/ml  was  measured  in 
monkeys compared to 12.3 μg/ml in humans. Following SC administration of 1.5 mg/kg Cmax was 16.1 
μg/ml in monkeys and 5.73 μg/ml in humans. There were also differences observed in the half-life of 
risankizumab in monkeys compared to humans, in monkeys the 173 hours following IV infusion and 184 
h  following  SC  administration.  In  humans  the  half-life  was  665  hours  following  either  IV  or  SC 
administration. As half-life is a combination of clearance and volume of distribution, the longer half-life in 
human is attributed to the higher volume of distribution. It is noted that the Tmax after IV administration 
of  a  dose  of  1  mg/kg  (10  minutes  constant  rate  infusion)  was  2  hours,  which  is  unusual  for  IV 
administration, although in these animals, sampling was only performed at 10 minutes and 8 hours (and 
later  time  points)  after  administration,  which  may,  together  with  the  slow  distribution  and  clearance, 
explain the relatively high mean Tmax in this study.  
Risankizumab is a typical IgG monoclonal antibody targeting a soluble target, distribution is assumed to 
be limited to the vascular space with limited distribution to the extracellular space due to its size and 
hydrophilicity. The expected consequence of metabolism of biological products is degradation to small 
peptides  and  amino  acids,  and  elimination  via  catabolism.  On  the  basis  of  that  any  potential  small 
molecule  co-dosed  with  risankizumab  is  unlikely  to  share  the  same  elimination  mechanisms  as  this 
antibody. Nonetheless inhibition of IL-23 by risankizumab in patients may suppress directly or indirectly 
the pathophysiological expression of downstream cytokines such as IL-17, IL-6, IL-10, IFNγ and TNF-α. 
Some of these cytokines are known to impact CYP isoforms. A clinical study carried out by the applicant 
demonstrated that 150mg risankizumab administered SC every four weeks had no effect on the AUC of 
CYP probe drugs or their metabolites. Clinically relevant drug interactions are not expected. 
In the 4-week repeat dose study, only monkeys in the highest IV dose group (8/10 at 50 mg/kg) were 
anti-drug antibody (ADA) positive at more than one consecutive time point based on a screening assay. 
The incidence of ADA was low in the 26-week general toxicity study, with two of 12 monkeys in the control 
group,  one  of  eight  monkeys  in  the  5  mg/kg  group  and  six  of  12  monkeys  in  the  50  mg/kg  group 
exhibiting the presence of confirmed ADAs. The incidence of ADA was also low in the enhanced pre- and 
postnatal developmental (ePPND) toxicity study, with 9/21 monkeys in the 50 mg/kg treatment group 
confirmed  positive.  In  general,  samples  with  confirmed  positive  anti-risankizumab  antibody  had  ADA 
signals just above the cut-point of the assay. Animals with confirmed ADA positive status were generally 
only  either  transiently  or  intermittently  ADA  positive  during  the  course  of  the  study.  The  presence  of 
confirmed positive ADA status did not appear to affect the serum concentrations of risankizumab. 
CHMP assessment report

In a pre-postnatal study with 5 or 50 mg/kg/week subcutaneous doses of risankizumab in cynomolgus 
monkeys,  samples  for  serum  concentration  analysis  were  obtained  from  the  dosed  mothers  and 
corresponding  infants  14,  28  and  91  days  after  birth.  Measurable  risankizumab  concentrations  were 
maintained for at least 91 days postpartum in most adult female monkeys and all infants. The mean infant 
serum exposures were 25% and 17% of the mean maternal serum exposures on Birth Day (BD) 14 in the 
5 and 50 mg/kg/week treatment groups, identifying the ability of risankizumab to cross the placenta. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
The nonclinical toxicity studies were intended to assess the systemic and local toxicity of risankizumab 
using relevant animal species is described in ICH S6(R1). The relevant animal species chosen was the 
cynomolgus  monkey.  The  cynomolgus  monkey  was  the  only  relevant  species  due  to  insufficient 
cross-reactivity of risankizumab to IL-23 from rodents. Risankizumab showed high binding affinity and 
potency  against  both  human  and  monkey  IL-23.  In  cynomolgus  monkey  at  the  NOAEL  of  50  mg/kg 
exposure  levels  69-fold  greater  than  the  highest  exposure  levels  in  human  subjects  were  observed 
following SC administration, which is the intended clinical route of administration. 
Repeat dose toxicity 
Repeat dose toxicity of risankizumab was evaluated in a four-week study after IV administration of up to 
50 mg/kg/week and at 20 mg/kg/week after SC administration, and in a 26  week chronic study with 
subcutaneous doses of up to 50 mg/kg/week. Reversibility of effects after an 8-week recovery period was 
tested in both studies in the control and high-dose groups. 
In  the  four-week  study,  risankizumab  was  well  tolerated  at  all  dose  levels,  with  no  evidence  of  test 
item-related effects on clinical signs, body weight, ophthalmology, neurobehavioral evaluations, clinical 
pathology  (pretest,  termination,  at  end  of  recovery),  electrocardiograms,  organ  weights,  macroscopic 
observations and microscopic pathology. Nine of ten 50 mg/kg IV animals had positive results for ADAs, 
but the presence of ADAs did not appear to affect the systemic exposure to risankizumab and did not 
produce any ADA-dependent safety findings (e.g., hypersensitivities). The NOAELs were 50 mg/kg/week 
for IV administration and 20 mg/kg/week for SC administration; the corresponding exposure levels at 
week 4 (meanAUC0–168hr of 92 mg•hr/mL and 27 mg•hr/mL respectively) were 74-fold (IV) and 21-fold 
(SC) greater than the highest exposure level in human subjects.  
In  the  26-week  study,  risankizumab  was  administered  SC  to  male  and  female  cynomolgus  monkeys 
(four/sex/group) at 0, 5, 20 and 50 mg/kg/week; two animals/sex/group from the control and high dose 
group  went  into  an  eight-week  recovery  period.  No  deaths  occurred  during  the  study,  and  no 
risankizumab-related effects were seen in clinical observations, body weight, food consumption, organ 
weights, 
body 
temperatures, 
blood 
pressure 
(indirect  measurement), 
ophthalmology, 
electrocardiography,  veterinary  physical  examination  findings,  neurobehavior  assessments,  clinical 
pathology parameters, lymphocyte phenotyping, T-cell dependent antibody response, and macroscopic 
or microscopic pathology findings. No evidence of opportunistic infections or precancerous microscopic 
changes was observed. Systemic exposure (Cmax and AUC0-168hr) to risankizumab generally increased 
proportionately with dose on Day 1, Weeks 4 and 26 and some degree of accumulation was observed. 
ADA positive results were observed in one of eight and six of twelve animals in the 5 and 50 mg/kg/week 
groups,  respectively.  Serum  risankizumab  concentrations  were  unaffected  by  ADAs  and  no 
ADA-dependent safety events were observed. The ADAs did not block the ability of risankizumab to bind 
to the IL-23 target in the IL-23 target capture assay. The NOAEL in this study was the highest dose tested 
(50 mg/kg/week) with an exposure level at Week 26 being 69-fold greater than the highest exposure in 
human subjects (a mean corresponding AUC0–168hr of 86 mg•hr/mL)

In  a  26-week  repeat-dose  reproductive  toxicity  study  in  sexually  mature  male  monkeys  at  50 
mg/kg/week,  no  risankizumab-related  effects  on  reproductive  parameters  (that 
included  a 
stage-dependent  histopathological  evaluation  of  spermatogenesis)  were  found.  An  initial  concern 
regarding potential disruption of spermatogenesis in monkeys was determined after review by specialists 
in veterinary pathology to be unrelated to risankizumab, but due to the inclusion in the 26-week study of 
several monkeys that did not fully reach sexual maturity being included. The overall conclusion is that 
male  and  female  fertility  was  not  affected  by  chronic  exposure  to  risankizumab  at  doses  up  to  50 
mg/kg/week, and this is reflected in section 4.6 of the SmPC. 
The  risankizumab  toxicological  assessment  conducted  in  cynomolgus  monkey  did  not  identify  any 
toxicologically significant findings in any of the repeat-dose studies. The NOAEL was 50 mg/kg/week, the 
highest dose tested, with exposure levels that were significantly above the recommended clinical dose in 
psoriasis patients (150 mg SC on Weeks 0 and 4, then every 12 weeks), providing a margin of exposure 
of approximately 70. 
Genotoxicity and Carcinogenicity 
Neither  genotoxicity  nor  carcinogenicity  studies  were  conducted  with  risankizumab.  A  monoclonal 
antibody  is  not  expected  to  cause  genotoxicity  by  either  direct  interaction  with  DNA  or  by  affecting 
chromosomal structure. Therefore, genotoxicity testing was not carried out in line with ICH S6(R1) and 
this is acceptable.  
As  risankizumab  does  not  bind  rodent  IL-23  and  lacks  pharmacological  activity  in  these  species, 
evaluation  of  the  effect  of  risankizumab  blockade  of  IL-23  binding  to  its  receptor  to  influence 
carcinogenesis  was  not  feasible  in  these  species.  Therefore,  a  weight  of  evidence  approach  was 
undertaken to evaluate the potential malignancy risk of risankizumab for humans.  
Data indicate that IL-23 promotes tumorigenesis by inducing inflammatory responses, promoting tissue 
proliferation, angiogenesis, and suppressing immune surveillance against tumour initiation, progression, 
elimination and metastasis. Thus, blocking IL-23 by risankizumab may be beneficial in preventing tumour 
growth. In addition, genetically modified mice lacking IL-23 show a lower incidence of tumours and a 
longer  latency  to  develop  tumours  in  several  chemically  induced  tumour  models.  Blocking  the  IL-23 
signaling with anti-IL-23 antibodies in mice or using genetically modified mice was shown to result in 
reduced growth and/or metastasis of transplanted tumour cell lines. 
In the completed toxicology package, no increased risk of malignancy has been observed in toxicology 
studies with risankizumab. There was no evidence of preneoplastic or neoplastic lesions and there was no 
evidence of immunosuppression in the chronic 26-week monkey study with subcutaneous (SC) dosing of 
up to dose levels of 50 mg/kg/week. Furthermore, in clinical trials with dosing of risankizumab for up to 
52 weeks, there is to date no evidence for an increased risk of malignancies. 
On the basis of the weight of evidence approach in conjunction with the observations in preclinical and 
clinical studies, the risk of malignancy from dosing with risankizumab is considered to be low. 
Reproduction and Developmental toxicity 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity assessment was conducted with risankizumab in cynomolgus 
monkeys.  The  potential  for  effects  on  male  and  female  fertility  was  assessed  by  evaluation  of  the 
reproductive tract as part of the 26-week chronic toxicity study. There were no effects observed on the 
female reproductive tract.  In 4 of 14 male monkeys, minimal to slight hypospermatogenesis (multifocal 
reduction in the number of round and elongating spermatids in the affected seminiferous tubules without 
apparent spermatid degeneration) was observed. Based on this assessment a further 26-week fertility 
study was undertaken in male cynomolgus monkeys. No risankizumab-related effects occurred for any of 
the endpoints evaluated, and there were no testis weight differences or gross or microscopic pathology 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 24/181 
 
 
 
findings. As there were no adverse effects in the male reproductive study a Pathology Working Group 
(PWG) reviewed the findings from the first 26-week toxicology study, the originally observed findings 
were  determined  following  review  not  to  be  dose  dependent  non-adverse  hypospermatogenesis,  but 
rather reflected normal testicular development in young peripubertal cynomolgus monkeys. The lack of 
findings in the second study support the conclusion of the PWG. Male and female fertility in monkeys is 
therefore not likely to be affected after chronic dosing with risankizumab at doses up to 50 mg/kg/week. 
The  effects  of  risankizumab  on  embryo-foetal  as  well  as  on  pre-  and  postnatal  development  were 
evaluated  in  an  enhanced  pre-  and  postnatal  development  (ePPND)  toxicity  study  in  cynomolgus 
monkeys.  Pregnant  cynomolgus  monkeys  were  administered  doses  up  to  50  mg/kg/week  by 
subcutaneous  injection  once  weekly  from  Gestation  Day  (GD)  20  to  22  until  parturition  for  up  to  22 
doses/animal. Infants were evaluated for growth and development, toxicokinetics and infant immunologic 
parameters (TDAR and blood lymphocyte subset analysis) for six months post-partum.  
Maternal toxicity was not observed and infant growth and development through six months postpartum 
were unaffected by treatment. 
Group-wise differences in foetal/infant losses that were reflected in lower survival were determined to be 
consistent  with  the  testing  laboratory's  range  of  normal  outcomes  (i.e.,  historic  controls)  for  ePPND 
studies  in  cynomolgus  monkeys  as  well  as  being  consistent  with  incidence  rates  reported  in  scientific 
literature. It was concluded that risankizumab administration had no effect on foetal/infant survival. The 
NOAEL  for  both  maternal  and  developmental  outcomes  was  50  mg/kg/week,  the  highest  dose 
administered. 
In an enhanced pre- and postnatal toxicity study in cynomolgus monkeys, it was shown that infants were 
exposed to risankizumab. Although foetal exposure (i.e. during pregnancy) has not been investigated, it 
is known that in general, IgG antibodies are transported efficiently to the foetus, especially in the last 
period of gestation (Pentsuk 2009). Risankizumab exposure in infants is attributed to placental transfer, 
not transfer from milk. It is noted though, that this has not been proven by the applicant, since there are 
no data from exposure in foetuses nor analyses in milk. However, based on the general knowledge that 
IgG content in primate milk is low, and immunoglobulins are not absorbed in significant amounts in the 
gastrointestinal  tract  of  primates,  it  is  agreed  that  indeed  it  can  be  expected  that  the  majority  of 
risankizumab exposure is the result of placental transfer.  
In the ePPND study infants were observed for six months post-partum, no dedicated juvenile toxicology 
studies  were  carried  out  and  this  is  acceptable.  The  ePPND  study  conducted  in  cynomolgus  monkeys 
revealed  no  risankizumab-related  effects  in  infant  monkeys  up  to  six  months  of  age.  Based  on  the 
pharmacology of risankizumab, the toxicity data, including lack of toxicity of the immune system, and as 
the major organ systems are developed in cynomolgus monkey by 6 months of age and humans by 2 
years, this data is considered to sufficiently address the safety profile for all age groups.  
Local tolerance 
Local  tolerance  was  evaluated  during  the  four-week  toxicology  study  in  monkeys  for  both  SC  and  IV 
administration. No adverse histopathology findings were identified at either the IV or SC injection site 
after several injections, indicating that the risk of injection site local irritation due to risankizumab was 
low. 
Other toxicity studies 
Antigenicity 
Human antibodies are expected to be immunogenic to cynomolgus monkeys, the presence of ADAs did 
not affect exposure in toxicity studies. Results showed that a substantial portion of total risankizumab was 
able to bind to target, even in plasma from monkeys that screened ADA positive, indicating that the ADAs 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 25/181 
 
 
 
formed in the monkeys did not block the ability of risankizumab to bind to its target and should not affect 
interpretation of the data. 
Immunotoxicity 
Administration of risankizumab to cynomolgus monkeys for up to 26 weeks of administration in the repeat 
dose  toxicity  study,  or  in  the  ePPND  study  did  not  produce  any  adverse  signs  or  perturbation  of  the 
immune  system.  No  signs  of  any  clinical  infection  occurred  during  the  toxicology  studies.  No  adverse 
changes in haematology or responses to KLH immunization were observed and no adverse microscopic 
changes  were  observed  in  lymphoid  tissues.  Overall,  risankizumab  has  not  demonstrated  signs  of 
immunosuppression in the toxicity studies. 
Dependence 
No dedicated study on abuse liability was conducted; the toxicology studies did not show evidence for 
abuse potential of risankizumab. 
Metabolites 
The metabolism of a biological product such as a monoclonal antibody is degradation to small peptides 
and  amino  acids  using  the  same  metabolic  processes  as  for  endogenous  proteins.  These  peptide  and 
amino acids are not expected to trigger any toxicity. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 26/181 
 
 
 
 
 
Studies on Impurities 
Dedicated purification processes to remove impurities and contaminants have been established instead of 
conducting preclinical testing for their qualification (ICH S6R1). The drug substance/drug product used in 
the  definitive  pharmacology  and  toxicology  studies  was  comparable  to  the  drug  product  used  for  the 
clinical studies. 
Tissue cross reactivity study 
Risankizumab was found to bind on extracellular granular material in the placenta. Expression of IL-23 in 
several placental tissue elements has been described in the literature. 
Haemocompatibility 
Risankizumab  was  found,  not  to  induce  haemolysis  in  human  whole  blood  up  to  a  concentration  of  2 
mg/ml. 
Extractables and leachables assessment 
For theactive substance, any extractables identified, the potential maximum daily exposure is well below 
the estimated PDE value indicating that the containers are suitable for the intended use, and that there is 
no safety hazard to humans regarding leachables. 
For thedrug product, no substances of toxicological concern in the  simulant extracts were detectable. 
Only  expected  organic  substances  were  found  in  the  organic  solvent  extracts,  the  overall  risk  of 
leachables migrating in the aqueous risankizumab DP formulation is negligible. Also, the daily dose based 
calculations are a worst case scenario approach, as risankizumab is planned to be dosed quarterly during 
clinical maintenance. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Risankizumab is an antibody (specifically a monoclonal immunoglobulin), and as such is a protein and a 
natural substance, the use of which will not alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in the 
environment. Therefore, risankizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Pharmacology 
The  non-clinical  pharmacological  properties of  risankizumab  have  been  adequately  characterised.  The 
studies provided have demonstrated that risankizumab has a high affinity for the p19 subunit of both 
human and cynomolgus monkey IL-23. Risankizumab does not bind human IL-12, it also does not bind 
rodent IL-23. Risankizumab appears to have higher affinity for the p19 subunit of cynomolgus monkey 
IL-23  than  the  human  p19  subunit  of  IL-23,  but  this  may  be  due  to  the  detection  limit  of  the  SPR 
technology used. 
Functionally, in vitro, risankizumab inhibits the downstream signaling of IL-23, and IL-17 production in 
response  to  human  IL-23.  In  an  in  vivo  mouse  ear  thickening  model,  risankizumab  inhibits  human 
IL-23-induced ear thickening as well as the induction of tissue IL-17 and IL-22. 
Safety  pharmacology  studies  were  incorporated  into  the  two  GLP  repeat  dose  toxicity  studies. 
Risankizumab  did  not  demonstrate  any  effect  on  neurological,  respiratory,  or  cardiovascular  function 
including electrocardiograms, in the four-week and 26-week toxicology studies.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 27/181 
 
 
 
 
 
Pharmacokinetics 
The  pharmacokinetic  profile  of  risankizumab  was  sufficiently  characterized.  The  pharmacokinetics 
observed after a single dose was typical of a monoclonal antibody, with low volumes of distribution, low 
clearance  and  a  long  terminal  elimination  half-life.  There  were  differences  observed,  however,  in  the 
half-life and Cmax values observed after the single dose studies in monkeys compared to humans, and 
this may be attributed to differences in volume of distribution between monkey and human. It is also 
noted that the Tmax after IV administration of a dose of 1 mg/kg (10 minutes constant rate infusion) was 
2  hours,  which  although  unusual  for  IV  administration  may  be  explained  by  slow  distribution  and 
clearance.  
Animals with confirmed ADA positive status were generally only either transiently or intermittently ADA 
positive during the course of the study. The presence of confirmed positive ADA status did not appear to 
affect the serum concentrations of risankizumab. 
Toxicology 
Repeat dose toxicity of risankizumab was evaluated in two GLP studies. For both IV and SC administration 
the  NOAEL  was  the  highest  dose  tested,  50  mg/kg/week.  The  risankizumab  toxicological  assessment 
conducted in cynomolgus monkey did not identify any toxicologically significant findings in any of the 
repeat-dose studies. In cynomolgus monkey at the NOAEL of 50 mg/kg/week exposure levels are 69-fold 
greater than the highest exposure levels in human subjects were observed following SC administration, 
which is the intended clinical route of administration. 
Neither  genotoxicity  nor  carcinogenicity  studies  were  conducted  with  risankizumab.  A  monoclonal 
antibody  is  not  expected  to  cause  genotoxicity  by  either  direct  interaction  with  DNA  or  by  affecting 
chromosomal  structure.  On  the  basis  of  the  weight  of  evidence  approach  in  conjunction  with  the 
observations in preclinical and clinical studies, the risk of malignancy from dosing with risankizumab is 
considered to be low. 
Reproductive and developmental toxicity assessment was conducted with risankizumab in cynomolgus 
monkeys.  Male  and  female  fertility  in  monkeys  is  not  likely  to  be  affected  after  chronic  dosing  with 
risankizumab at doses up to 50 mg/kg/week. The effects of risankizumab on embryo-foetal as well as on 
pre- and postnatal development were evaluated in an enhanced pre- and postnatal development (ePPND) 
toxicity  study  in  cynomolgus  monkeys.  Maternal  toxicity  was  not  observed  and  infant  growth  and 
development through six months postpartum were unaffected by treatment. Six months of age in monkey 
correlates  to  approximately  2  years  of  age  in  humans.  No  dedicated  juvenile  toxicology  studies  were 
carried  out  and  this  is  acceptable.  Based  on  the  pharmacology  of  risankizumab,  the  toxicity  data, 
including  lack  of  toxicity  of  the  immune  system,  and  as  the  major  organ  systems  are  developed  in 
cynomolgus monkey by 6 months of age and humans by 2 years, this data is considered to sufficiently 
address the safety profile for all age groups. Also in the ePPND study it was demonstrated that infants 
were exposed to risankizumab. Risankizumab exposure in infants is attributed to placental transfer, not 
transfer from milk. It is noted though, that this has not been proven by the applicant, since there are no 
data from exposure in foetuses, nor analyses in milk. However, based on the general knowledge that IgG 
content  in  primate  milk  is  low,  and  immunoglobulins  are  not  absorbed  in  significant  amounts  in  the 
gastrointestinal  tract  of  primates,  it  is  agreed  that  indeed  it  can  be  expected  that  the  majority  of 
risankizumab exposure is the result of placental transfer. Measurable risankizumab concentrations were 
present in both maternal and fetal plasma up to 91 days post birth.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Introduction 
This application is seeking approval for risankizumab for the treatment of moderate to severe chronic 
plaque psoriasis. The proposed clinical dose is 150 mg administered subcutaneously (SC) at Week 0, 
Week 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter for all subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. 
The to-be-marketed drug product is supplied in a pre-filled syringe containing 75 mg of risankizumab in 
0.83 mL (90 mg/mL).

Studies conducted to date that were pertinent to risankizumab pharmacokinetics included a Phase 1 study 
in healthy subjects (Study M16-513) and a Phase 1 study in subjects with moderate to severe plaque 
psoriasis (Study 1311.1), to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity, along with safety and 
tolerability, of risankizumab. The pharmacokinetics, immunogenicity, efficacy and safety of risankizumab 
were evaluated in one Phase 2 study (Study 1311.2) and four Phase 3 studies (Study M16-008, Study 
M16-010, Study M15-995 and Study M15-992), in subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque 
psoriasis. The therapeutic protein-drug interaction potential for risankizumab was investigated in a Phase 
1 study (Study M16-007) in subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. In addition to 
these individual studies, population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed using combined data from 
these Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies to support the overall characterization of the pharmacokinetics of 
risankizumab.  
Pharmacokinetic parameters for risankizumab were determined using non-compartmental 
pharmacokinetic analysis methods. For the population pharmacokinetic analysis, the risankizumab PK 
data were analysed using non-linear mixed effects modelling software NONMEM (Version 7.4). 
Analytical Methods 
Evaluation of free risankizumab in human plasma 
An ELISA assay was developed to determine the free concentration of risankizumab in human plasma. In 
brief, risankizumab is captured by a polyclonal antibody that has been coated on an ELISA plate. Captured 
drug is then bound by a biotinylated blocking anti-idiotypic risankizumab antibody. The assay was 
validated for accuracy, precision, linearity, selectivity, specificity, matrix interference, dilutional integrity 
and sample stability. The defined assay performance specifications and the method validation carried out 
are, in general, in line with the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation 
(EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 rev.1 corr.2). Queries raised on the evaluation of sample stability and 
the potential impact of anti-drug antibodies on the performance of the ELISA have been satisfactorily 
addressed.  
Evaluation of cytochrome P450 probe substrates in human plasma 
LC-MS/MS bioanalytical methods were developed and validated for the quantitative determination of the 
cytochrome P450 (CYP450) probe substrates (caffeine, omeprazole, midazolam, warfarin and 
metoprolol) administered alone or in combination with risankizumab in the drug-drug interaction study 
(study M16-007 [1311.36]). The assays were validated for accuracy, precision, linearity, selectivity, 
specificity, matrix interference/effect, matrix factor cross-analyte interference, dilution integrity, 
recovery, sample stability and carryover ().  In general, the method validation was carried out in line with 
the Guideline on Bioanalytical method validation (EMEA/CHMP/EWP/192217/2009 rev.1 corr.2). 
Evaluation of anti-Risankizumab antibodies in human plasma 
The method is a qualitative electrochemiluminescent (ECL) immunoassay designed to detect 
anti-Risankizumab antibodies in human plasma. In accordance with the Guideline on Immunogenicity 
assessment of biotechnology-derived therapeutic proteins (EMEA/CHMP/BMWP/14327/2006 Rev.1), the 
presence of anti-drug antibodies was evaluated using the recommended three tiered approach: an initial 
screening assay to identify potentially anti-drug antibody positive samples, a confirmation assay based on 
competition with exogenously added risankizumab and a determination of the titer of antibodies for 
confirmed positive samples. There are two versions of the assay however the only modification relates to 
sample dilution prior to analysis. 
The assay controls and system suitability criteria described in the method description meet current 
required standards and are acceptable.  In general, the data presented supports adequate validation of 
the method in terms of sensitivity, precision, selectivity and stability of samples. although some queries 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 31/181 
 
 
 
are raised. Queries relating to the intra- and Inter- assay precision estimates for the screening and 
confirmatory assays have been addressed. With respect to drug tolerance, the sensitivity of the assay in 
the presence of drug has  been justified with respect to the actual levels of drug in plasma at the time of 
sampling during the studies. Additional queries raised in relation to the sample stability, 
robustness/reproducibility and carry-over evaluations for the method have been resolved. In addition, 
the results of incurred samples reanalysis have  been provided.. Further information has been presented 
in relation to the positive control antibody used during sample analysis.  
A number of points for clarification raised in relation to the cut point determinations have  been 
addressed. Adequate justification has been presented for the multiplicative correction factors used during 
sample analysisand the derivation of these correction factors has been explained. 
Evaluation of Risankizumab NAbs in study plasma.  
The NAB assay is a cell-based method followed by an ELISA analysis of phospho-STAT3. In brief, 
Risankizumab causes a reduction in IL-23 dependent phosphorylation of STAT3. The assay detects ADAs 
that can neutralise this mechanism of action.  
While a confirmatory step is normally not included in NAb evaluation, the applicant has confirmed that 
NAb analysis is only performed on samples already screened and confirmed to be ADA positive.  
Population PK analysis 
A population PK analysis of risankizumab was conducted using PK data from healthy subjects and subjects 
with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, enrolled in seven Phase 1 to 3 clinical trials, who received at 
least one dose of risankizumab administered IV or SC. Overall, 13,501 risankizumab plasma 
concentration measurements from 1899 subjects were included in the analyses. 
A two-compartment model with a first-order absorption for SC administration and first-order elimination 
adequately described risankizumab pharmacokinetics. The parameters of the final population 
pharmacokinetic model were estimated with acceptable precision (%RSE ranging from approximately 2% 
to 17%). Model evaluation using goodness-of-fit plots, visual predictive checks, and bootstrap analyses 
indicated that the model described risankizumab pharmacokinetics acceptably well. 
Risankizumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases, resulting in 
approximately 30% lower exposure in patients with increased body weight (>100 kg). However, changes 
in efficacy of risankizumab observed with increased body weight were not considered to be clinically 
meaningful. Risankizumab clearance was increased in patients with ADA titer ≥128 units, resulting in an 
estimated 30% decrease in risankizumab exposure. However, changes in efficacy of risankizumab 
observed in ADA positive patients were not considered to be clinically meaningful. None of the other 
statistically significant covariates identified had a meaningful impact on risankizumab exposures 
(risankizumab exposures were well within the default 80 to 125% equivalence boundaries over the range 
of covariate values observed in subjects with psoriasis).

Absorption 
The absorption of monoclonal antibodies after SC administration is believed to be primarily mediated 
through the lymphatic system. 
•  Bioavailability 
In the population pharmacokinetic analysis, risankizumab absolute SC bioavailability was estimated to be 
89% for the to-be-marketed Phase 3 clinical regimen. Following SC administration, risankizumab reached 
peak plasma concentrations between 3 and 14 days after dosing. The population estimate for the 
absorption rate constant (Ka) was 0.23 day-1.  
•  Bioequivalence 
Risankizumab drug substance was initially generated using a manufacturing process coded as CMC1. 
CMC1 process batches include the early 10 mg/mL vial for IV administration, and the 90 mg/mL 1 mL 
pre-filled syringe (PFS) for SC administration, used in Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical studies. Following a 
change in the manufacturing process, CMC2 batches were produced for Phase 3 trials. This will be the 
commercial formulation and process. In addition to change in process, CMC2 batches are presented in a 
different type (brand) of syringe containing 75 mg of risankizumab in 0.83 mL (90 mg/mL). The 
comparability between CMC1 batches and CMC2 batches is detailed in Section 3.1 Quality aspects. 
Distribution 
Monoclonal antibodies are largely confined to the vascular and interstitial spaces and have a small 
apparent volume of distribution compared to low molecular weight drugs, primarily due to their large 
molecular size and poor lipophilicity. 
Based on population PK modelling, the estimated mean steady-state volume of distribution of 
risankizumab was approximately 9.1 L in a typical 70 kg patient, and approximately 11.2 L in a typical 90 
kg patient, indicating that there was some limited distribution into tissue. 
Elimination 
The elimination routes of monoclonal antibodies involve proteolysis/catabolism into smaller proteins and 
peptides inside lysosomes of mainly endothelial cells throughout the body following internalization via 
either receptor or target-mediated endocytosis or non-specific pinocytosis. As an IgG1 monoclonal 
antibody, risankizumab is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic metabolic enzymes or renal 
elimination. 
Based on population PK modelling the plasma clearance of risankizumab was 0.24 L/day for a typical 70 
kg patient and 0.31 L/day for a typical 90 kg patient. Clearance of risankizumab was best described by a 
linear elimination process. The terminal phase elimination half-life was estimated to be 28 days.  
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
•  Dose proportionality 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 34/181 
 
 
 
 
Dose proportionality of risankizumab following SC administration was observed in two Phase 1 trials 
(Studies 1311.1 and 1311.16) and one Phase 2 trial (1311.2). 
Study 1311.1 was a rising single dose trial in patients with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Subjects 
received either a single-dose of risankizumab or matching placebo via IV or SC administration. In patients 
with psoriasis, single doses of risankizumab from 0.01 mg/kg up to 5 mg/kg IV resulted in dose 
proportional increases in serum risankizumab exposure, as measured by AUC0-∞, AUC0-tz, and Cmax. 
Increases in exposure also appeared to be approximately dose proportional with SC doses of 0.25 mg/kg 
and 1 mg/kg. However, dose-proportionality at the recommended SC dose of 150 mg cannot be assumed 
from this study alone. 
Study 1311.16 was a rising single dose trial in healthy male subjects. Subjects received either a 
single-dose of risankizumab or matching placebo via IV or SC administration. Subjects received single 
doses of risankizumab of 200 mg, 600 mg or 1200 mg IV; or single doses of 18 mg, 80 mg or 300 mg SC. 
The results indicated that risankizumab exposures across the SC and IV dose ranges were approximately 
dose proportional. 
Study 1311.2 evaluated three risankizumab SC dosing regimens in patients with moderate to severe 
plaque psoriasis - single (18 mg) or multiple (90 mg and 180 mg) SC injection at weeks 0, 4 and 16. 
Risankizumab exposure increased in an approximately dose proportional manner across the dose range 
analysed in this study.

(90 mg and 180 mg) SC injection at weeks 0, 4 and 16. 
• 
Time dependency 
Time dependency of risankizumab following SC administration was assessed in four Phase 3 trials 
(1311.28, 1311.3, 1311.30 and 1311.4), as well as in the population PK analyses. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 35/181 
  
 
 
 
Across the Phase 3 studies, following SC dosing of risankizumab at the proposed clinical regimen (150 mg 
at Weeks 0, 4 and every 12 weeks thereafter), the steady-state plasma concentrations of risankizumab in 
subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis were approximately achieved by Week 16. In the 
population PK study, based on empirical Bayesian pharmacokinetic parameter estimates, after SC dosing 
of risankizumab at the proposed clinical regimen, the mean (± SD) model-predicted risankizumab trough 
plasma concentrations were 2.48 ± 1.35 μg/mL at Week 16, 2.03 ± 1.19 μg/mL at Week 28, and 1.91 ± 
1.17 μg/mL at Week 52. These data support the absence of time-dependent behaviour. 
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
The data from Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies showed moderate to high inter-subject variability of risankizumab 
after SC dosing, with CV% values on risankizumab exposure ranging from approximately 19% to 89%. In 
phase 3 studies, there was no clear intra-subject effect of ADAs on risankizumab exposure. In the 
population PK modelling study, the inter-individual variability (%CV) for risankizumab CL, Vc and Ka 
parameters were 24%, 34%, and 63%, respectively, and residual variability was 19%. 
Table 2: Inter-individual and residual variability for risankizumab parameters in final 
population PK model 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic model, risankizumab plasma clearance (CL), central volume of 
distribution (Vc), peripheral volume of distribution (Vp), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), and 
terminal phase elimination half-life were estimated to be approximately 0.24 L/day, 4.86 L, 4.25 L, 9.1 L, 
and 28 days, respectively, for a typical patient 70 kg subject. Risankizumab absolute SC bioavailability 
was estimated to be 89% for the Phase 3 clinical regimen. Risankizumab PK parameters were not 
significantly different between healthy volunteers and subjects with psoriasis.

Special populations 
• 
Impaired renal function 
In the population PK analyses, serum creatinine was statistically correlated with risankizumab clearance. 
However, based on the simulations conducted using the final population pharmacokinetic model, serum 
creatinine had no significant impact on risankizumab model predicted steady-state Cmax and AUC 
following the proposed clinical dosing regimen of 150 mg SC at Week 0, 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter, 
with exposure ratios relative to the reference group being within the default equivalence boundaries of 
0.8 to 1.25. 
• 
Impaired hepatic function 
In the population PK analyses, hepatic function (bilirubin, ALT and AST), was not significant correlated 
with risankizumab clearance. 
•  Gender 
In the population PK analyses, gender did not significantly influence risankizumab PK. 
•  Race 
One Phase 1 study [Study M16-513 (1311.16)] was performed, as well as the population pharmacokinetic 
modelling study, to examine the impact of race on the pharmacokinetics of risankizumab. 
In Study 1311.16, after single SC doses of risankizumab 18 mg to 300 mg to healthy Caucasian, Chinese 
and Japanese subjects, the difference in risankizumab exposure (AUC) in Japanese or Chinese healthy 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 37/181 
 
 
 
 
 
subjects compared with healthy Caucasian subjects was approximately 30% higher in Japanese subjects 
and approximately 20% higher in Chinese subjects. After adjusting for bodyweight, risankizumab 
exposure was comparable across ethnic groups (less than 5% difference), suggesting that exposure 
differences between ethnicities were driven by bodyweight differences. 
In the population PK analyses, race (Asian vs white and other) was not found to be a significant covariate 
on risankizumab pharmacokinetic parameters. 
•  Weight 
In the population PK analyses, body weight was statistically correlated with risankizumab clearance, 
central volume of distribution, and peripheral volume of distribution. Based on the simulations conducted 
using the final population pharmacokinetic model, subjects with bodyweight >100 kg were estimated to 
have approximately 30% lower risankizumab exposure (Cmax, AUC)  than those with bodyweight ≤100 
kg. This difference was considered small and not clinically relevant at the proposed clinical regimen (150 
mg SC at Weeks 0, 4 and q12w thereafter). Subgroup analyses, comparing PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 
responses at week 1 based on body weight ≤100 kg vs >100 kg using the pooled data across Phase 3 
studies in subjects with psoriasis, also suggested that body weight had no impact on risankizumab 
efficacy. Further, exposure-response analyses indicated that the proposed clinical regimen of 
risankizumab achieved the plateau of efficacy for the evaluated endpoints (PASI 90, PASI 100 and sPGA 
0/1) at Week 16 and Week 52 across the entire body weight range evaluated in subjects with psoriasis. 
• 
Elderly 
In the population PK analyses, age (18 to 85 years) was not a statistically significant covariate for 
risankizumab pharmacokinetic parameters. 
Interactions 
The expected consequence of metabolism of biological products is degradation to small peptides and 
amino acids, the same metabolic processes as for endogenous proteins. As these processes typically have 
high capacity, they are not likely to be impacted by other co-administered medications. Further, any 
potential small molecule co-dosed with risankizumab is unlikely to share the same elimination 
mechanisms as this antibody. 
IL-23 plays a key role in the pathophysiology of inflammatory diseases through induction and 
maintenance of Th17 type cells that secrete inflammatory cytokines. Inhibition of IL-23 by risankizumab 
in patients may suppress directly or indirectly the pathophysiological expression of downstream 
cytokines, like IL-17, IL-6, IL-10, IFN-γ and TNF-α (Gaffen et al, 2014). Some of these cytokines are 
known to impact the expression and stability of various cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme isoform (Lee et 
al, 2010).  
In a clinical drug interaction study [Study M16-007 (1311.36)], risankizumab was shown to have a low 
potential for drug-drug interactions. In this trial, repeated administration of risankizumab 150 mg SC 
every 4 weeks had no effect on the exposures of probe substrates of CYP1A2 (caffeine 100 mg), CYP2C9 
(warfarin 10 mg), CYP2C19 (omeprazole 20 mg), CYP2D6 (metoprolol 50 mg) and CYP3A (midazolam 2 
mg) in subjects with plaque psoriasis. The 90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the probe substrates 
Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞, when administered 6 days following the fourth dose of risankizumab 150 mg 
SC every 4 weeks versus when these substrates were administered prior to initiating risankizumab 
treatment, were within the default no-effect boundaries of 0.8 to 1.25 (with exception of the lower 90% 
confidence bound for omeprazole Cmax ratio which extended slightly below 0.8). Consistent with these 
results, risankizumab had no effect on evaluated metabolite-to-parent AUC ratios for these probe 
substrates.

metabolite-to-parent drug AUC ratios (bottom). 
Immunogenicity 
Development of anti-risankizumab antibodies was measured throughout the clinical program. Overall, 
across Phase 3 studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs following risankizumab SC treatment 
was <30% and, in general, approximately half of these ADA-positive subjects were positive for 
neutralizing antidrug antibodies. Most ADA-positive subjects had relatively low ADA titers (<5 units), with 
a low proportion having titers >100 units. Comparisons of mean risankizumab concentrations in 
ADA-positive vs ADA-negative subjects did not show a clear impact of ADAs on risankizumab plasma 
exposures.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 39/181 
 
 
 
 
 
In the population pharmacokinetic analyses of risankizumab data, using data from Phase 2 and 3 clinical 
trials, ADA titer was significantly correlated with clearance. Anti-risankizumab antibodies did not have any 
impact on risankizumab clearance in the majority of ADA positive subjects. In a small subset of subjects 
(28/1807 ADA-positive subjects representing 1.5% of ADA-evaluable subjects in Phase 2 and Phase 3 
studies) who developed ADA titer ≥ 128 units, risankizumab clearance was estimated to increase by 43%, 
resulting in an estimated 30% decrease in risankizumab AUC, on average. This small difference in 
exposure was considered to be not clinically relevant for the short-term efficacy (Week 16) or long-term 
(Week 52) maintenance of efficacy (PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1) as confirmed by subgroup analyses for ADA 
positive subjects versus ADA negative subjects in Phase 3 trials. Presence of neutralizing antibodies (NAb) 
to risankizumab was not correlated with risankizumab clearance. 
Exposure relevant for safety 
The exposure-response relationships for safety were performed using pooled data from subjects who 
received at least one dose of risankizumab across the four Phase 3 studies. The exposure-response 
relationships were explored for the safety events in relevant areas of interest (any adverse event [AE], 
serious adverse event [SAE], infection and serious infection) through the first 16 weeks (Week 0 – 16; 
placebo-controlled period) as well as through the first 52 weeks (Week 0 – 52 for Study M16-008 
[1311.3], Study M15-995 [1311.28] and Study M15-992 [1311.4]) and Week 0 – 44 for Study M16-010 
[1311.30]). 
As shown in Figure 11 and Figure 12 (below), there was no apparent relationship between risankizumab 
exposure and any AE, SAE, infection and infestation or serious infection over the first 16 weeks and up to 
52 weeks duration.

Conclusion 
The pharmacokinetics of risankizumab were studied and characterised sufficiently. Important issues 
arising from the population PK study including the impact of body weight and ADA status on clinical 
response have been resolved. 
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Risankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with 
high affinity to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with 
the IL-23 receptor complex. IL-23 is up-regulated in lesional skin in comparison to non-lesional skin of 
patients with plaque psoriasis. By blocking IL-23 from binding to its receptor, risankizumab inhibits 
IL-23-dependent cell signalling and release of proinflammatory cytokines. 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Primary pharmacology 
The exploratory assessment of pharmacodynamic and disease biomarkers in skin biopsies and plasma 
samples were performed following administration of single dose of risankizumab in the Phase 1 study in 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 42/181 
 
 
 
 
subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis (Study 1311.1). Consistent with the mechanism of 
action of inhibiting IL-23 binding to its receptor and subsequently the downstream signaling, treatment 
with risankizumab resulted in decrease in the transcriptomic and protein biomarkers associated with IL 
23/IL-17 axis in both plasma and psoriatic skin lesions in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis 
compared to placebo. 
Following single doses of risankizumab, genes associated with the IL-23/IL-17 axis (IL-23A, IL-22, 
IL-22RA1, IL-22RA2, IL-17A, IL-17F, IL-17RA, IL-17RC), epidermal hyperplasia and tissue inflammation 
(β-defensin 2, neutrophil gelatinase lipocalin, and S-100A7/A8), keratinocyte and epithelial cell 
differentiation (late cornified envelope protein, transglutaminase 1, and cornifelin) were significantly 
downregulated in lesional skin biopsy samples compared with placebo. Additionally, 
immunohistochemistry analysis showed that treatment with risankizumab also resulted in decrease in 
biomarkers associated with thickening of the keratinocyte layer and hyperproliferation, dermal infiltration 
by T-cells, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and markers of epidermal hyperplasia and tissue inflammation in 
psoriatic skin lesions. The levels of β-defensin 2, a surrogate marker for disease activity in psoriasis, in 
plasma were decreased after treatment with risankizumab compared with placebo at multiple time points. 
Secondary pharmacodynamic studies 
Secondary pharmacology 
A thorough QT study with risankizumab was not conducted. In the Scientific Advice in October 2015, 
CHMP agreed that a thorough QT study with risankizumab was not required. 
Safety pharmacology programme 
Pharmacodynamic interactions with other medicinal products or substances 
No clinical studies were conducted. 
Genetic differences in PD response 
No information was provided. 
Relationship between plasma concentration and effect 
The PK-PD study was based on all available pharmacokinetic data from the completed Phase 1 study 
(1311.1) and data through at least week 12 from all subjects receiving risankizumab in the ongoing Phase 
2 study (1311.2). A sequential exposure-response modelling approach was used to fit the PK (plasma 
concentration-time) and PD (PASI score-time) of risankizumab in subjects with psoriasis. PK parameters 
were obtained from a population PK model developed for risankizumab. The response (PD effect) was the 
reduction in PASI score by inhibiting the formation of psoriatic skin plaques.

2.4.4.  Results of predictions (simulations) with the PK-PD model of 
PASI scores for a range of doses and regimens is detailed and discussed 
in the Clinical efficacy section .Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The proposed clinical dose is 150 mg risankizumab SC at Week 0, Week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter, 
which has been used in four Phase 3 studies. The administration routes in the clinical studies of 
risankizumab were SC and/or IV. 
Pharmacokinetics 
The pharmacokinetics was studied in healthy volunteers and patients with psoriasis. Non-compartmental 
PK analysis was conducted in studies with intensive PK data and some with sparser PK data. A population 
pharmacokinetic model was developed to identify patient-specific factors that may explain

Population PK modelling 
Data from seven studies were used for population PK modelling. Risankizumab PK, after single or multiple 
administrations through IV or SC routes in healthy subjects or subjects with psoriasis, was adequately 
described by a 2-compartment PK model with linear absorption after SC administration and linear 
elimination from the central compartment.  
Risankizumab clearance and volume of distribution increase as body weight increases resulting in reduced 
exposure in patients with increased body weight (>100 kg). However, changes in efficacy of risankizumab 
observed with increased body weight were not considered to be clinically meaningful. Risankizumab 
clearance was increased in patients with ADA titer ≥128 units. However, changes in efficacy of 
risankizumab observed in ADA positive patients were not considered to be clinically meaningful. None of 
the other statistically significant covariates identified had a meaningful impact on risankizumab 
exposures. 
Bioavailability 
Following SC administration, risankizumab reached peak plasma concentrations between 3 and 14 days 
after dosing with absolute bioavailability estimated to be 89% based on cross-study population 
pharmacokinetic analyses, which is consistent with results from non-compartmental analysis. The 
population estimate for Ka was 0.23 day-1. With the clinical dosing regimen of 150 mg SC at Weeks 0, 4, 
and q12w thereafter, risankizumab steady-state exposure was approximately achieved by Week 16 with 
estimated steady-state peak and trough plasma concentrations of approximately 12 and 2 µg/mL, 
respectively. 
Distribution 
Monoclonal antibodies are largely confined to the vascular and interstitial spaces and have a small 
apparent volume of distribution compared to low molecular weight drugs, primarily due to their large 
molecular size and poor lipophilicity. 
Based on population PK modeling, the estimated mean steady-state volume of distribution of 
risankizumab was approximately 9.1 L in a typical 70 kg patient, and approximately 11.2 L in a typical 90 
kg patient, indicating that there was some limited distribution into tissue. 
Elimination 
The elimination routes of monoclonal antibodies involve proteolysis/catabolism into smaller proteins and 
peptides inside lysosomes of mainly endothelial cells throughout the body following internalization via 
either receptor or target-mediated endocytosis or non-specific pinocytosis. As an IgG1 monoclonal 
antibody, risankizumab is not expected to undergo metabolism by hepatic metabolic enzymes or renal 
elimination. 
Based on population PK modelling, the plasma clearance of risankizumab was 0.24 L/day for a typical 70 
kg patient and 0.31 L/day for a typical 90 kg patient. Clearance of risankizumab was best described by a 
linear elimination process. The terminal phase elimination half-life was estimated to be 28 days.  
Dose proportionality and time dependency 
The pharmacokinetics of risankizumab appeared to be linear with dose-proportional increase in exposure 
across the evaluated dose ranges of 18 to 300 mg or 0.25 to 1 mg/kg SC, and 200 to 1200 mg or 0.01 to 
5 mg/kg IV, and no time-dependent kinetics were observed.  
Intra- and inter-individual variability 
In phase 3 studies, there was no clear intra-subject effect of ADAs on risankizumab exposure. The data 
from Phase 1, 2 and 3 studies indicate that inter-subject variability (CV%) of risankizumab after SC 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 46/181 
 
 
 
administration is moderate to high, with CV% values on risankizumab exposure ranging from 
approximately 19% to 89%. In the population PK modelling, the estimates of inter-individual variability 
(CV%) for CL, Vc and Ka were 24%, 34%, and 63%, respectively. 
Pharmacokinetics in the target population 
Based on the population pharmacokinetic model, risankizumab plasma clearance (CL), central volume of 
distribution (Vc), peripheral volume of distribution (Vp), volume of distribution at steady state (Vss), and 
terminal phase elimination half-life were estimated to be approximately 0.24 L/day, 4.86 L, 4.25 L, 9.1 L, 
and 28 days, respectively, for a typical patient 70 kg subject. Risankizumab absolute SC bioavailability 
was estimated to be 89% for the Phase 3 clinical regimen. Risankizumab PK parameters were not 
significantly different between healthy volunteers and subjects with psoriasis. 
Special populations 
Renal function (serum creatinine, creatinine clearance), hepatic function (ALT, AST, bilirubin), gender, 
race (Asian vs white and other), age (18 to 85 years), disease category (healthy vs psoriasis patient), 
concomitant medications used in Phase 3 studies, as well as NAb, did not appear to significantly affect 
exposure to risankizumab. Exposure to risankizumab is decreased in patients with increased body weight 
and in patients with high ADA titer. However, clinically meaningful changes in efficacy of risankizumab 
were not observed in patients with increased body weight or in ADA positive patients. 
Body weight was significantly correlated with risankizumab clearance. Subjects with body weight 
> 100 kg were estimated to have approximately 30% lower risankizumab exposure than subjects with 
body weight ≤ 100 kg. However, this difference in exposure was considered not clinically relevant at the 
clinical regimen (150 mg SC at Weeks 0, 4 and q12w thereafter), since body weight had minimal impact 
on risankizumab efficacy as assessed by the PASI 90 and sPGA of clear or almost clear responses. 
Anti-drug antibodies (anti-risankizumab antibodies) did not have any impact on risankizumab clearance 
in the majority of anti-drug antibody positive subjects. Only ADA titers of at least 128 were found to have 
any impact on risankizumab clearance.  In the small subset of subjects who developed ADA titer ≥ 128 
(28/1807; representing 1.5% of anti-drug antibody evaluable subjects in Phase 2 and Phase 3 studies), 
risankizumab clearance was estimated to increase by 43%, resulting in approximately 30% decrease in 
risankizumab AUC on average. This difference in exposure was shown to be not clinically relevant for the 
short-term efficacy (Week 16) or long-term (Week 52) maintenance of efficacy (PASI 90 and sPGA of 
clear or almost clear) as confirmed by subgroup analyses for anti-drug antibody positive versus negative 
subjects in Phase 3 trials. 
Interactions 
Risankizumab was shown to have a low potential for drug-drug interactions. In a clinical drug interaction 
study, repeated administration of risankizumab 150 mg SC every 4 weeks had no effect on the exposures 
of probe substrates of CYP1A2 (caffeine 100 mg), CYP2C9 (warfarin 10 mg), CYP2C19 (omeprazole 20 
mg), CYP2D6 (metoprolol 50 mg) and CYP3A (midazolam 2 mg) in subjects with plaque psoriasis. The 
90% confidence intervals for the ratios of the probe substrates Cmax, AUC0-t, and AUC0-∞, when 
administered 6 days following the fourth dose of risankizumab 150 mg SC every 4 weeks versus when 
these substrates were administered prior to initiating risankizumab treatment, were within the default 
no-effect boundaries of 0.8 to 1.25 (with exception of the lower 90% confidence bound for omeprazole 
Cmax ratio which extended slightly below 0.8). Consistent with these results, risankizumab had no effect 
on evaluated metabolite-to-parent AUC ratios for these probe substrates. 
Immunogenicity 
Development of anti-risankizumab antibodies was measured throughout the clinical program. Overall, 
across Phase 3 studies, the incidence of treatment-emergent ADAs following risankizumab SC treatment 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 47/181 
 
 
 
was <30% and, in general, approximately half of these ADA-positive subjects were positive for 
neutralizing antidrug antibodies. Most ADA-positive subjects had relatively low ADA  titers (<5 units), 
with a low proportion having titers >100 units. Comparisons of mean risankizumab concentrations in 
ADA-positive vs ADA-negative subjects did not show a clear impact of ADAs on risankizumab plasma 
exposures.  
In the population pharmacokinetic analyses of risankizumab data, using data from Phase 2 and 3 clinical 
trials, ADA titer was significantly correlated with clearance. In ADA-positive subjects with ADA titers of 
128 or higher, on average, risankizumab AUC decreased by 30%. However, in subgroup analysis, it was 
shown that this reduction in exposure was not clinically relevant for the short-term efficacy or long-term 
maintenance of efficacy, which is accepted.  
Exposure relevant to safety 
There was no apparent relationship between risankizumab exposure and any AE, SAE, infection and 
infestation or serious infection over the first 16 weeks and up to 52 weeks duration using pooled data from 
all four Phase 3 studies of risankizumab in subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. 
Pharmacodynamics 
Risankizumab is a humanised immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that selectively binds with 
high affinity to the p19 subunit of human interleukin 23 (IL-23) cytokine and inhibits its interaction with 
the IL-23 receptor complex. By blocking IL-23 from binding to its receptor, risankizumab inhibits 
IL-23-dependent cell signalling and release of proinflammatory cytokines. 
Primary pharmacology 
The exploratory assessment of pharmacodynamic and disease biomarkers in skin biopsies and plasma 
samples were performed following administration of single dose of risankizumab in the Phase 1 study in 
subjects with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Consistent with the mechanism of action of inhibiting 
IL-23 binding to its receptor and subsequently the downstream signaling, treatment with risankizumab 
resulted in decrease in the transcriptomic and protein biomarkers associated with IL 23/IL-17 axis in both 
plasma and psoriatic skin lesions in subjects with moderate to severe psoriasis compared to placebo. 
Relationship with plasma risankizumab concentration and effect 
The PK-PD study was based on all available pharmacokinetic data from the completed Phase 1 study 
(1311.1) and data through at least week 12 from all subjects receiving risankizumab in the ongoing Phase 
2 study (1311.2). A sequential exposure-response modelling approach was used to fit the PK (plasma 
concentration-time) and PD (PASI score-time) of risankizumab in subjects with psoriasis. PK parameters 
were obtained from the population PK model developed for risankizumab. The response (PD effect) was 
the reduction in PASI score by inhibiting the formation of psoriatic skin plaques. 
A semi-mechanistic PK/PD model describing the relationship with plasma risankizumab concentrations 
and PASI response over time was developed. The time course of PASI response was modelled using the 
indirect response PK-PD modeling approach, which is appropriate for these types of data. Modelling 
indicated a clear exposure-response relationship. Model parameters were estimated with acceptable 
precision. Inter-patient variability of parameters was moderate. In general, the goodness of fit plots 
showed that the PK-PD model was able to adequately predict PASI time-course data. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 48/181 
 
 
 
An important issue arising from the PK-PD study (as well as the population PK study) was the potential 
impact of body weight on clinical response. Additional data provided by the applicant showed that PASI 
responses seem to be consistent across different weight categories up to 130 kg, but not above. This 
observation is in line with the assumption that the plasma levels are mostly on the plateaux of the 
concentration-effect curve. However, the concentration-effect curve is quite steep, and even a small 
decrease of Cavg concentration may lead to a substantial efficacy loss. At Cavg levels below 
2.5 - 3 µg/mL, the efficacy loss steeply accelerates, and the mean concentration of obese patients (> 130 
kg) is at this critical level. Therefore, about 50% of this obese patient population had concentrations 
below the critical level. Body weight tiered dosing does not seem to be a realistic and useful alternative. 
The SmPC  was amended to inform about lesser efficacy in patients with body weight above 130 kg. This 
has been implemented. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of risankizumab were well studied and characterised.  No 
major objections were raised in terms of clinical pharmacology for this application. The applicant has 
responded adequately to all concerns. 
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
The  recommended dose  and  dosing  regimen  used  in  the  Phase  3  studies  were  selected based on  the 
safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data from the Phase 1 (Study 1311.1) and Phase 2 (Study 1311.2) 
studies  in  adult  patients  with  plaque  psoriasis,  formulation  considerations,  patient  acceptability 
considerations, as well as exposure-response analyses. 
In phase I first-in-human single dose study (study 1311.1), at doses of 0.25 mg/kg (~19 mg for 75 kg 
patient), 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg (~375 mg for 75 kg patient) by IV or SC administration, all active dose groups 
showed improvement in mean PASI scores at 24 week follow-up with doses > 1 mg/kg showing near 
maximal PASI reduction.  
2.5.1.  Dose response study 
For the phase II dose ranging study (Study 1311.2) 3 doses were selected e.g mg 18 SC single dose at 
Week 0, and 90 and 180 mg SC multiple doses at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. In this study the dose-response was 
evaluated on outcomes such as PASI responder rates at 90% at week 12 (primary endpoint), 75, 50 and 
100% levels, PGA scores and DLQ index. This is in line with the EMA psoriasis Guideline that recommends 
using a global psoriasis endpoint along with PASI response.  
The  selected  study  population  was  compatible  with  the  patient  population  in  the  pivotal  studies  and 
representative of the target population. 
In this study, overall, best results were obtained for 90mg and 180 mg dose as compared to 18 mg for 
which a significant difference as compared to Stelara was not seen for most endpoints.  
For doses 90 mg and 180 dose mixed efficacy results were reported. Both 90mg and 180 mg doses were 
superior as compared to Stelara for PASI 90 at Week 12 but not for PASI 90 at Week 24 as at this time 
point only 180 mg dose was better to Stelara. On the other hand for PASI75 at Week 12 only 90mg dose 
was superior to Stelara. 
For pivotal studies 150 mg dose was selected. In line with the SmPC the recommended dose is 150 mg 
(two 75 mg injections) administered by subcutaneous injection at Week 0, Week 4, and every 12 weeks 
thereafter. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 49/181 
 
 
 
The 150 mg dose and dosing regimens (e.g Week 0, Week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter) was selected 
based  on  the  results  of  the  Population  Pharmacokinetic  and  Exposure-Response  Analyses  of 
Risankizumab from Phase 1 and 2 Studies in Subjects with Psoriasis  which included data from phase I 
(study 1311.1) and phase II study (study 1311.2). It can be noted that the proposed dosage regimen is 
the same as the posology approved for Stelara (ustekinumab), with the same target (IL-23) and with a 
similar half-life as  risankuzumab (approximately 3 weeks). 
Under the proposed regimen, doses of 150 mg are predicted to result in near maximal PASI 90 and PASI 
100 rates; additional increases in dose of risankuzumab up to two-fold (300 mg) are predicted to result 
in no more than a 5% increase in PASI 90 response rates.  
In  addition  alternative  dosing  regimens  were  investigated  in  this  PK/PD  analysis.  Based  on  PK-PD 
considerations alone, the 0, week4 q8 regime offers only minimal advantages over q12 while for q16 
decreased efficacy was observed. It is noted that the predicated time to the first loss of PASI 90 response 
for doses >90 mg was long e.g > 300 days.   
It is known that patients with psoriasis tend to be overweight or obese. Some of the biological products 
approved for use in psoriasis have a weight-based posology (Remicade, Stelara), while others don´t (e.g. 
Humira, Enbrel and Cosentyx). For Stelara (ustekinumab), a cut-off is applied, with patients weighing 
>100 kg receiving the double dose. The applicant claims that the weight-based posology is not required 
as the predicted median response rates for PASI 90 and PASI 100 would only differ by about 5% for a 
body weight of 60 kg vs. 120 kg based on the PASI PK-PD model. For subjects with body weight >130kg 
information has been included to inform about lesser efficacy. However no dose adjustment is considered 
necessary.  
2.5.2.  Main studies 
2.5.2.1.  Study M15-995 (1311.28) and M16-008 (1311.3) 
Studies Risankizumab/Protocol M15-995 and Risankizumab/Protocol M16-008 were of the same design 
and therefore are presented and discussed together. 
The main objectives of both studies were to assess the efficacy and safety of risankizumab, compared to 
ustekinumab and placebo in subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  
In addition, both assessed pharmacokinetics (PK) and the emergence of anti-drug antibodies (ADA) and 
their effect on efficacy and safety. 
•  Methods/study design 
Both  studies  were  Phase  3,  multi-center,  multi-national,  randomized,  double-blind,  double-dummy, 
placebo- and active-comparator-controlled, parallel design study compared risankizumab to ustekinumab 
and placebo in subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints were evaluated at Week 16. Additional endpoints were evaluated at 
Week 12, 16 and 52. 
Approximately 500 subjects with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis were planned for this study. 
Subjects who failed screening were not to be re-screened. 
The screening period ranged from 1 to 6 weeks, followed by a 16-week treatment period (Part A). Patients 
were randomised into a 3:1:1 (risankizumab, ustekinumab and placebo). 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 50/181 
 
 
 
At Week 16, all subjects initially randomized to placebo began receiving 150 mg risankizumab. Subjects 
were to continue to receive treatment through Week 40 and were to be followed through at least 52 weeks 
(Part B). 
Subjects could then either end their study participation or enter the open-label extension study (Study 
M15-997) provided they met eligibility criteria and desired to continue treatment. Subjects not wishing to 
continue in the open-label study were to have a final visit at 56 weeks.

Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoints 
There are co-primary endpoints to assess the efficacy of  risankizumabfor the treatment of moderate to 
severe chronic plaque psoriasis. These are as follows: 
•  Achievement of ≥ 90% reduction from baseline PASI score (PASI 90) at Week 16 
•  Achievement of a sPGA score of clear or almost clear at Week 16 
At the trial level, the co-primary endpoints will be the proportion of patients achieving PASI 90 and a sPGA

• 
Sample size 
Based on the outcome from the trials 1311.1 and 1311.2, the PASI 90 response rate at Week 16 is 
assumed to be at least 65% in the risankizumab arm and at most 45% in the ustekinumab arm.  
The achievement of sPGA clear or almost clear rate at Week 16 is assumed to be at least 85% in the 
risankizumab arm and at most 67.5% in the ustekinumab arm.Using a 3:1 randomisation scheme 
(risankizumab:ustekinumab), 300 patients in the risankizumab arm and 100 in the ustekinumab arm will 
provide 94% power for PASI 90 AND will provide at least 95% power for the sPGA endpoint.

• 
Randomisation 
An IRT will be used to allocate medication to patients through medication numbers.  
Study drugs were administered subcutaneously. Injections were given in a double blind/dummy fashion 
with each patient receiving 2 injections of risankizumab or matching placebo and 1 injection of 
ustekinumab or matching placebo for a total of 3 injections at each dosing visit.  
Randomisation was stratified by weight (≤ 100 kg versus >100 kg) and prior exposure to TNF antagonists 
(0 versus ≥1). 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
Patients, investigators and everyone involved in trial conduct or analysis or with any other interest in this 
double-blind trial remain blinded with regard to the randomised treatment assignments until after 
database lock. 
The randomisation code was kept confidential by Clinical Trial Support up to database lock. 
Bioanalytics will not disclose the randomisation code or the results of their measurements until the trial is 
officially unblinded. Serum drug levels and demographic data together with treatment assignments and 
dosing information may be made available to individuals outside of the trial team for the purpose of PK 
dataset generation and analysis in accordance with sponsor’s standard procedures. 
Unblinding and breaking the code 
Emergency unblinding will be available to the investigator / pharmacist / investigational drug storage 
manager via IRT. It was only be used in an emergency situation when the identity of the trial drug must 
be known to the investigator in order to provide appropriate medical treatment or otherwise assure safety 
of trial participants. The reason for unblinding were to be documented in the source documents and/or 
appropriate eCRF page along with the date and the initials of the person who broke the code. 
• 
Statistical methods 
Statistical analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were conducted in the 
Intention-to-treat population comprising all subjects randomised to one of the three treatment arms 
(risankizumab 150 mg, ustekinumab, and placebo) at week 0. Subjects were analysed according to the 
treatment group to which they were randomised, regardless of any protocol deviations.  
The primary null hypothesis is that risankizumab is not different to placebo in achieving ≥ 90% reduction 
from baseline in the PASI score (PASI 90) and sPGA score of clear(0) or almost clear(1) at Week 16 in 
participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  
Testing of ranked secondary endpoints was conducted in a hierarchical manner, only if both co-primary 
endpoints were rejected. 
The co-primary binary endpoints of PASI 90 and sPGA (0 or 1) were each analysed using the 
Cochran-Mantel Haenszel risk difference estimate stratified by the stratification factors of baseline weight 
(≤ 100 kg versus >100 kg) and prior exposure to TNF antagonists (0 versus ≥1). The CMH weights 
proposed by Greenland and Robins were used. 
Binary secondary endpoints were analysed using the same method as for the co-primary endpoints. 
Change from baseline in PSS at Week 16 was analysed using the stratified van Elteren test using the 
stratification factors of baseline weight (≤ 100 kg versus >100 kg) and prior exposure to TNF antagonists 
(0 versus ≥1). Differences between treatment groups on other continuous variables were analysed using 
ANCOVA with treatment group, baseline value and stratification factors in the model. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019

Additional secondary analyses, without multiplicity control, included time-to-event analyses of time to 
first endpoint and time to loss of endpoint. Time-to-event data were analysed using Kaplan-Meier 
estimates for each treatment group and stratified log-rank tests for treatment group comparisons. 
Consistency of the treatment effect for the primary efficacy endpoints was examined in subgroup 
analyses over demographic and other baseline characteristics including age, sex, race, smoking status, 
BMI, baseline PASI score, baseline sPGA, psoriatic arthritis status, past treatment history and region. 
Similar analyses were conducted in the per-protocol population comprising subjects who were most 
compliant with the protocol in ways the sponsor believed could impact the observed treatment effect. 
Last Observation Carried Forward was used as the primary method for handling missing values in 
continuous variables, and the secondary approach in the analyses of categorical variables. 
Complete case (or as-observed case analysis) was used as the secondary method for handling missing 
values in continuous variables. 
Multiple imputation was used as the sensitivity approach for the co-primary and ranked secondary 
endpoints. Imputation was primarily conducted under a missing at random assumption, although 
subjects who discontinued due to adverse event of “worsening of disease under study” were treated as 
non-responders at all subsequent visits. 
Logistic regression or MMRM models were proposed if multiple imputation approaches could not be 
applied to the collected data.

Participant flow  
Study M16-008  
A total of 506 subjects were randomized from 79 sites across 8 countries (Australia, Canada, Czech 
Republic, France, Germany, Japan, Republic of Korea, and US). Similar proportions of subjects 
discontinued study drug prematurely in the placebo and risankizumab treatment groups through Week 16 
of Part A.

Study M15-995 
A total of 491 subjects were randomized from 64 sites across 10 countries (Austria, Belgium, Canada, 
France, Germany, Mexico, Poland, Portugal, Spain, and US). A larger proportion of subjects discontinued 
study drug prematurely in the placebo group compared to the risankizumab group through Week 16 of 
Part A.  
For both studies through Week 52, the overall rate of premature discontinuation was low, and similar 
proportions of subjects on risankizumab or ustekinumab discontinued the study prematurely. Adverse 
events, lost to follow-up, and withdrawal by subject were the most frequently reported reasons for study 
drug discontinuation.

M15-995 
One Site was closed during study conduct due to failure of the site to adhere to the signed agreement, the 
study protocol and procedures, and GCP. The 11 subjects enrolled at this site were excluded from the 
efficacy and safety analyses as planned in the SAP.  
A sensitivity analysis of the co-primary endpoints at Week 16 including these subjects was generated. 
In addition to the deviations summarized above, a number of subjects had blood samples for evaluation 
of ADA and/or DNA banking drawn without signing a separate ICF that was required for these optional 
study procedures. In all instances, the subject was notified. If the subject did not agree to the sample 
being used for those purposes, the sample was destroyed. If the subject agreed to having the sample 
used, he/she was re-consented at the next visit. This was not considered to impact subject safety or 
subject rights. 
• 
Recruitment 
The protocol stated that the recruitment was competitive.  
• 
Conduct of the study 
The studies were conducted in accordance with the protocol, International Council for 
Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use (ICH) guidelines, applicable 
regulations and guidelines governing clinical study conduct, and ethical principles that have their origin in 
the Declaration of Helsinki. 
An Independent Ethics Committee/IRB approval of the protocol, informed consent, and subject 
information and/or advertising, as relevant, was obtained prior to the authorization of drug shipment to 
a study site. 
Changes in conduct of the study 
Both trials: 
Substantive changes from the original protocol to Amendment 1 were to require an additional ADA sample 
was required at Week 4, to clarify the definition of analysis sets in the Statistical Methods upon a request 
from Health Authorities, and to add a definition for "time to onset of endpoint." 
Substantive changes from Amendment 1 to Amendment 2 were to transition the US 
Investigational New Drug application for risankizumab from BI to AbbVie, to change the sponsor for Study 
M16-008 within the US to AbbVie, and to change the Sponsor information and the ownership of various 
study responsibilities (e.g., statistical analysis). 
None of the amendments are considered to have an impact on the integrity or interpretation of the data.

Statistical Changes 
After the protocol was finalized, the rank order of the secondary endpoints was revised. 
The company made 15 changes to the ranked secondary endpoints in both studies (see protocol), to be 
analyzed in the intent-to-treat (ITT) and per protocol (PP) Populations only if the null hypothesis for the 
co-primary endpoints has been rejected: 
Other secondary endpoints included achievement of PASI 75 at Week 16, achievement of a sPGA of clear 
or almost clear at Week 52, and achievement of PASI 75 at Week 52. 
Further efficacy endpoints were defined in statistical analysis plan (SAP). The SAP was finalized prior to 
blind break. 
• 
Baseline data 
The baseline demographics were similar between the treatment arms within each study. Comparing 
between the studies there were some differences M16-008 were slightly older but had a lower mean 
weight and lower mean BMI. There were more males than females in the study. The majority of patients 
were Caucasians. 
Baseline mean scores on PASI and BSA and the distribution of sPGA scores were balanced between the 
treatment groups. Approximately 10% of subjects in each group had a diagnosis of PsA, and another 
approximately 20% in each group had suspected PsA. The treatment groups were balanced with regard to 
prior psoriasis medication history. 
PASI, BSA, NAPSI, PSSI, PPASI, and PSS Scores at Baseline (ITT Population) 
The baseline disease parameters are generally in line with entry criteria and were well-balanced between 
the study arms. 75% and 25% of study subjects were moderately and severely affected, respectively. 
As psoriasis also affects nails scalp and plantar surfaces and also significantly impacts on patients quality 
of life the additional secondary efficacy endpoints examining the effect of treatment is agreed.  
sPGA Scores at Baseline (ITT Population) 
The applicant primarily targeted a moderate disease population average percent of moderate disease 
ranged 78.6 to 84.4%. The baseline disease severity s PGA was similar between treatment arms within 
the studies however comparing the studies M15-995 appears to have a higher percentage of more severe 
patients compared to study M16-008.However this is in line with other development programmes. 
Disease History at Baseline (ITT Population) 
Some differences were noted for each study that patients with psoriatic arthritis was higher for both 
placebo groups compared to both active arms. The applicant is asked to comment on whether this may 
have advantaged the Risankizumab treatment as patients with concomitant psoriatic arthritis may have 
more difficult disease to control. 
Psoriasis Medication History (ITT Population) 
The average amount of patients who had biologics ranged between 34.4 and 41.3 %, however a higher 
percentage of patients were treated with non-biologic systemic therapy 47.3- 51.6%. Approximately a 
third of patients were naïve to systemic therapy and 16.4 to 24.4 % of patients were naïve to all therapies 
(other than topical). Therefore the majority of patients were in the moderate category which is in line with 
s PGA data.   
Exposure was comparable between treatment groups during Part A and Part B

Outcomes and estimation 
Primary Endpoints 
The co-primary endpoints (Part A) were achieved in each study. Statistically significantly larger 
proportions of subjects in the risankizumab groups achieved both PASI 90 and sPGA clear or almost clear 
at Week 16 compared with the placebo groups. 
Table 5:Studies M15-995 (1311.28) and M16-008 (1311.3): Analysis Results of Primary 
Endpoints, NRI (ITT Populations) 
Treatment effects in all pre-specified subgroups were in favour of risankizumab with 95% confidence 
interval of the treatment difference excluding zero in every subgroup in each study (Study M15-995 Study 
M16-008). 
The sensitivity analyses of the primary endpoints including the 11 subjects from one Site who were 
excluded from the efficacy analysis also yielded similar results (Study M15-995). 
Ranked Secondary Endpoints 
Risankizumab treatment was compared with placebo and ustekinumab treatment with respect to the 
ranked secondary endpoints PASI 100, PASI 90, PASI 75, sPGA clear, sPGA clear or almost clear, DLQI 0 
or 1, and PSS at specified time points. 
Statistically significant treatment effects favoring risankizumab were achieved for all ranked secondary 
endpoints in each study, indicating that risankizumab treatment was superior to placebo and 
ustekinumab.

Study M15-995 
Study M16-008 
Starting at Week 12, statistically significant differences in favour of risankizumab for proportions of 
subjects who achieved all PASI 75/90/100, as well as sPGA of clear/clear or almost clear were observed 
through Week 16 compared with subjects in the placebo and ustekinumab groups. Subjects who received 
continuous risankizumab experienced persistent or increased responses through study completion, with 
approximately 60% of subjects achieving complete clearance at Week 52. Subjects who were randomized 
to placebo and then switched to risankizumab at Week 16 achieved similar response rates of PASI 
90/100, as well as sPGA of clear and sPGA of clear or almost clear by the end of the study. Among subjects 
who entered Part B as PASI 100/90 and sPGA clear/clear or almost clear responders, (Study M16-008: 
81.7%/88.6% and 81.3%/92.1% study M15-995: 78.5%/88.6% and 78.7%/89.4%) maintained their 
response at Week 52, respectively.

Other efficacy endpoints 
Statistically significantly differences were observed between risankizumab and placebo groups at Week 
16 on measures of improvement of nail psoriasis, palmoplantar psoriasis, and scalp psoriasis. 
Improvement from baseline was also significantly better with risankizumab compared with ustekinumab 
for nail and scalp psoriasis at Week 52.

Trial in Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis to Assess Safety and Efficacy After 16 Weeks of Treatment 
and After Incomplete Adalimumab Treatment Response (IMMvent). 
•  Methods/ Study design 
This Phase 3, multi-national, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active controlled, 
parallel-design study compared risankizumab(BI 655066) with adalimumab. 
This study is designed to show a benefit of risankizumab over adalimumab in terms of PASI 90 response 
and sPGA scores of clear or almost clear at Week 16. 
Study Design Schematic 
Patients initially randomized to risankizumab will stay on risankizumab. 
At Week 16, patients initially on adalimumab and <PASI 50 will be switched to risankizumab. 
At Week 16, patients initially on adalimumab and >PASI 90 will stay on adalimumab. 
At Week 16, patients initially on adalimumab and >PASI 50 and <PASI 90 will be re-randomised 1:1 to 
receive either risankizumab or adalimumab.

• 
Treatments 
Multiple  doses  of  risankizumab,  comparator  drug  adalimumab  and  matching  placebos  to  both 
risankizumab and adalimumab were administered subcutaneously. 
- Risankizumab  was administered by 2 injections à 75mg at randomization, at Weeks 4, 16 and 28 for 
patients initially randomized to risankizumab and who continue on risankizumab; 2 injections 75mg at 
Weeks  16,  20  and  32  for  patients  crossing  over  from  adalimumab  to  risankizumab  at  Week  16.  The 
duration of treatment was therefore 16 or 28 weeks. 
-  Placebo  Matching  Risankizumab  was  given  0.9%  sodium  chloride  solution  presented  in  a  pre-filled 
syringe. This was given as 
a)  2  injections  at  Week  20  and  32  for  patients  who  start  with  risankizumab  and  continue  on  
risankizumab 
b)  2  injections  at  randomization,  Weeks  4  and  28  for  patients  switching  from  adalimumab  to 
risankizumab at Week 16 
c)  2  injections  at  randomization,  Weeks  4,  16,  20,  28,  and  32  for  patients  who  start  with 
adalimumab and continue on adalimumab. 
-Adalimumab (Brand Name Humira) 2 injections à 40mg at randomization (80 mg loading dose), then 1 
injection à 40mg at Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7, etc., every other week until Week 41 for patients who start with and 
continue  on  adalimumab;  or  only  up  to  Week15  for  patients  who  switch  from  adalimumab  to 
Risankizumab at Week 16. 
- Placebo to match Adalimumab.  0.9% sodium chloride solution presented in a pre-filled syringe. This 
was administered as 2 injections at randomization, followed by 1 injection at Weeks 1, 3, 5, 7 etc., every 
other  week.  Duration  was  41  weeks  in  patients  who  started  riszakizumab  or 24  weeks  for  those  who 
switched from Adalimumab to risankizumab. 
Restrictions regarding concomitant treatment were the same as the same as the previous studies so are 
not mentioned again here. 
•  Objectives 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 68/181 
 
 
 
The  main  objectives  of  this  study  are  to  assess the efficacy  and  safety  of  Risankizumab  compared  to 
adalimumab in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The primary efficacy evaluation 
will be performed at 16 weeks and an assessment of maintenance of response will be performed at 44 
weeks.  Evaluation  of  the  efficacy  of  a  28  week  treatment  with  Risankizumab  in  patients  who  had  an 
insufficient or only partial response with adalimumab, and then switched to Risankizumab treatment from 
Week 16 to Week 44. 
Assess  PK  and  the  emergence  of  anti-drug  antibodies  (ADA)  and  their  effect  on  efficacy  and  safety. 
Influence on gene and protein expression levels and disease specific protein markers and metabolic risk 
factors  
•  Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoint(s) 
There are co-primary endpoints to assess the efficacy of risankizumab for the treatment of moderate to 
severe chronic plaque psoriasis. These are as follows: 
Achievement of ≥ 90% reduction from baseline PASI score (PASI 90) at Week 16 
Achievement of an sPGA score of clear or almost clear at Week 16. 
Key Secondary Endpoints: 
The key secondary endpoints are as follows: 
Achievement of ≥75% reduction from baseline PASI score (PASI 75) at Week 16 
Achievement of 100% reduction from baseline PASI score (PASI 100) at Week 16 
Achievement of ≥90% reduction from baseline PASI score (PASI 90) at Week 44 for those patients who 
are re-randomized at Week 16 
Other Secondary Endpoints: 
The other secondary endpoints are as follows: 
Achievement of an sPGA score of clear or almost clear (0 or 1) at Week 44 
Achievement of sPGA score of clear (0) at Week 44 
Other endpoints  
These were similar to the previous studies so are not presented in detail, here. Included PASI responses 
various levels, time to achieve PASI responses, s GPA, time to loss of response. Other efficacy endpoints 
NAPSI, PSSI, PPASI, DLQI 
•  Randomisation 
After the eligibility criteria are confirmed, the patient will be randomized 1:1 to either risankizumab or 
adalimumab on Day 1 (Visit 2) through IRT call or website entry. At visits where study medication is to be 
administered or dispensed to the patient, study sites will be required to complete the medication resupply 
module in the Interactive Response Technology/Tool (IRT). 
Randomization was stratified by weight (≤ 100 kg vs. >100 kg) and prior exposure to TNF antagonists (0 
vs. ≥1). 
•  Blinding (masking) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 69/181 
 
 
 
Patients, investigators and everyone involved in trial conduct or analysis or with any other interest in this 
double-blind trial were to remain blinded with regard to the randomized treatment assignments until after 
database lock. 
Emergency  unblinding  was  available  to  the  Investigator  /  Pharmacist  /  investigational  drug  storage 
manager via IRT in an emergency situations. 
•  Statistical methods 
Part A 
Statistical analyses of the co-primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were conducted in the 
Intention-to-treat population comprising all subjects randomised to one of the two treatment arms 
(risankizumab 150mg and adalimumab) at week 0. Subjects were analysed according to the treatment 
group to which they were randomised, regardless of any protocol deviations.  
The primary null hypothesis is that risankizumab is not different to adalimumab in achieving ≥ 90% 
reduction from baseline in the PASI score (PASI 90) and sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear(1) at 
Week 16 in participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  
In order to control the trial-wise type I error rate, both co-primary endpoints must be statistically 
significant simultaneously at the 5% level. Testing of ranked secondary endpoints was conducted in a 
hierarchical manner, only if both co-primary endpoints were rejected. 
The co-primary binary endpoints of PASI 90 and sPGA (0 or 1) were each analysed using the 
Cochran-Mantel Haenszel risk difference estimate stratified by the stratification factors of baseline weight 
(≤ 100 kg versus >100 kg) and prior exposure to TNF antagonists (0 versus ≥1). The CMH weights 
proposed by Greenland and Robins were used. 
Binary secondary endpoints were analysed using the same method as for the co-primary endpoints. 
Differences between treatment groups on continuous variables were analysed using ANCOVA with 
treatment group, baseline value and stratification factors in the model. 
Additional secondary analyses, without multiplicity control, included time-to-event analyses of time to 
first endpoint and time to loss of endpoint. Time-to-event outcome data were analysed using 
Kaplan-Meier estimates for each treatment group and stratified log-rank tests for treatment group 
comparisons. 
Consistency of the treatment effect for the primary efficacy endpoints in Part A was examined in subgroup 
analyses over demographic and other baseline characteristics including age, sex, race, smoking status, 
BMI, baseline PASI score, baseline sPGA, psoriatic arthritis status, past treatment history and region. 
Similar analyses were conducted in the per-protocol population comprising subjects who were most 
compliant with the protocol in ways the sponsor believed could impact the observed treatment effect. 
The robustness of observed treatment effects for the co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints to 
alternative assumptions about the missing data mechanism was investigated in a number of sensitivity 
analyses. 
Non-response imputation was the default method for handling missing data for the co-primary endpoints. 
All subjects who dropped out of the study were treated as non-responders in the primary efficacy 
analyses. Intermittent missing values were imputed as responders if the first non-missing values pre- and 
post- the missing visit both indicated response to treatment; otherwise they were imputed as 
non-response. Subjects that took prohibited medications to treat psoriasis were handled the same as 
those that discontinued from the trial – i.e. subsequent visits following start of prohibited medication were 
considered as failure for binary endpoints. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 70/181 
 
 
 
Last Observation Carried Forward was used as the primary method for handling missing values in 
continuous variables, and the secondary approach in the analyses of categorical variables. 
Complete case (or as-observed case analysis) was used as the secondary method for handling missing 
values in continuous variables. 
Multiple imputation was used as the sensitivity approach for the co-primary and ranked secondary 
endpoints. Imputation was primarily conducted under a missing at random assumption, although 
subjects who discontinued due to adverse event of “worsening of disease under study” were treated as 
non-responders at all subsequent visits. 
Logistic regression or MMRM models were proposed should it not be possible to apply multiple imputation 
approaches to the collected data. 
Part B 
Statistical analyses of the primary and ranked secondary efficacy endpoint were conducted in the 
intention-to-treat population comprising all subjects re-randomised to one of the two treatment arms 
(risankizumab 150mg and adalimumab) at week 16. Subjects were analysed according to the treatment 
group to which they were randomised, regardless of any protocol deviations.  
The primary null hypothesis is that risankizumab is not different to adalimumab in achieving ≥ 90% 
reduction from baseline in the PASI score (PASI 90) at Week 44 among patients re-randomized at Week 
16. This endpoint will be tested independently with a type I error rate of 0.05 
The null hypothesis for the single ranked secondary endpoint is that risankizumab is not different to 
adalimumab in the achievement of 100% reduction in baseline PASI score (PASI 100) at Week 44 among 
patients re-randomized at Week 16. This was tested using a two-sided test at the 5% level, only if the 
primary endpoint was rejected. 
The primary binary endpoints of PASI 90 was  analysed using the Cochran-Mantel Haenszel risk difference 
estimate stratified by the stratification factors of baseline weight (≤ 100 kg versus >100 kg) and prior 
exposure to TNF antagonists (0 versus ≥1). The CMH weights proposed by Greenland and Robins were 
used. 
Binary secondary endpoints were analysed using the same method as for the co-primary endpoints. 
Differences between treatment groups on other continuous variables were analysed using ANCOVA with 
treatment group, baseline value and stratification factors in the model. 
Consistency of the treatment effect for the primary efficacy endpoints  in Part B was examined in 
subgroup analyses over demographic and other baseline characteristics including age, sex, race, smoking 
status, BMI, baseline PASI score, baseline sPGA, psoriatic arthritis status, past treatment history and 
region. 
Similar analyses were conducted in the per-protocol population comprising subjects who were most 
compliant with the protocol in ways the sponsor believed could impact the observed treatment effect. 
Methods for handling missing data were identical to those for part A.

•  Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint result 
The  primary  efficacy  analyses  were  conducted  in  the  ITT  population  in  Part  A  (ITT_A)  and  the  ITT 
re-randomized population in Part B (ITT_B_RR). Only the primary and ranked secondary variables were 
analyzed for the per-protocol populations using the methods of handling missing data described in the 
SAP. 
The co-primary endpoints were achieved. A statistically significantly larger proportion of subjects in the 
risankizumab group achieved both PASI 90 and sPGA clear or almost clear at Week 16 compared with the 
adalimumab group. Sensitivity and per protocol analyses supported the primary analysis. Point estimates 
were consistently in favour of the risankizumab group across strata.

In addition to the pre-specified subgroup analyses, the proportion of re-randomized subjects (PASI 50 to 
< PASI 90) who achieved PASI 90 at Week 44 was analyzed by subgroups based on PASI response at the 
entry to Part B: < PASI 75 and ≥ PASI 75. In each subgroup, a statistically significantly larger proportion 
of  subjects  who  were  re-randomized  to  risankizumab  achieved  PASI  90  at  Week  44  compared  with 
subjects who were re-randomized to adalimumab.  
Pre-specified subgroup analyses also supported the data as in each subgroup, a statistically significantly 
improvement was demonstrated.

Title: BI 655066 [risankizumab] Versus Placebo in a Multicenter Randomized Double-Blind Study in 
Patients with Moderate to Severe Chronic Plaque Psoriasis Evaluating the Efficacy and Safety with 
Randomized Withdrawal and Re-Treatment 
•  Methods  
This Phase 3, multinational, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study compares 
risankizumab with placebo in the treatment of moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. It includes an 
88-week treatment period and a 16-week follow-up period. All subjects had completed the double-blind, 
placebo-controlled part of the study (Part A1), and all continuing subjects had completed at least 52 
weeks of study at the data cut-off date for this interim report. 
Eligible subjects were randomized at a ratio of 4:1 to one of 2 treatment arms.  
At the Week 16 visit (co-primary endpoints), all subjects were to receive risankizumab 150 mg active 
treatment. 
At the Week 28 visit, all subjects were to be assessed for response. Subjects in Arm 1 who met the 
protocol-defined response criterion (Static Physician Global Assessment [sPGA] clear or almost clear) 
were to be re-randomized in a ratio of 1:2 to double-blind risankizumab or placebo, while subjects who 
did not meet the criterion were to receive open-label risankizumab 150 mg from Week 28 through Week 
88, while all subjects in Arm 2 who met the criterion were to receive blinded risankizumab 150 mg at 
Week 28. After the end of treatment (EOT) at Week 88, all subjects were to continue in the 16 week 
follow-up period. Beginning at Week 32, all subjects in both arms who received blinded study drug at 
Week 28 and had sPGA ≥ 3 (relapse) were to be switched to open-label risankizumab. If relapse occurred 
from Week 32 through Week 70, open-label risankizumab 150 mg was to be administered at 0, 4, and 16 
weeks after relapse. If relapse occurred after Week 70 through Week 82, open-label risankizumab 150 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 78/181 
 
 
 
 
 
mg was to be administered at 0 and 4 weeks after relapse. If relapse occurred after Week 82 through 
Week 88, the subject was to receive re-treatment with a single dose of risankizumab. 
Figure 1: Trial design 
•  Study participants  
Adult subjects were enrolled with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis, defined by a PASI≥12, sPGA ≥3, 
and BSA involvement of at least 10%, who were candidates for systemic or phototherapy. Enrolment 
criteria were well in accordance with the EMA psoriasis guideline requirements. 
• 
The main exclusion criteria  
Following patients were excluded:  
Patients with non-plaque forms of psoriasis, current drug-induced psoriasis, active ongoing inflammatory 
diseases other than psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis that might confound trial evaluations according to the 
investigator’s judgment.  
Patients who had known chronic or relevant acute infections, such as HIV (Human Immunodeficiency 
Virus), viral hepatitis, or tuberculosis, any documented active or suspected malignancy or history of 
malignancy within 5years prior to screening. Patients with latent tuberculosis with low risk of reactivation 
could be enrolled. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 79/181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
•  Treatments 
Risankizumab and matching placebo were to be administered in the study. Risankizumab 150 mg for 
subcutaneous (SC) administration was to be provided in 2 pre-filled syringes (PFS) of 75 mg each. 
Placebo was also to be administered subcutaneously via a PFS. 
• 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of this trial are to assess the safety and efficacy of risankizumab 150 mg in 
comparison to placebo in patients with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis. The primary efficacy 
evaluation was performed at 16 weeks. In addition, the maintenance of response following drug 
withdrawal was assessed after Week 28 through Week 104. 
Subsequent to drug withdrawal, patients who experience relapse were retreated with risankizumab to 
assess response after retreatment. 
• 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary Endpoints: 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints in Part A1: Achievement of ≥ 90% reduction from baseline PASI 
score (PASI 90) at Week 16 and achievement of sPGA of clear or almost clear (0 or 1) at Week 16. 
The primary efficacy endpoint in Part B: Achievement of sPGA clear or almost clear response at Week 
52. 
Key Secondary Endpoints: 
Ranked secondary endpoints in Part A1 
•  Achievement of 75% reduction from baseline PASI score (PASI 75) at Week 16 
•  Achievement of 100% reduction from baseline PASI score (PASI 100) at Week 16 
•  Achievement of an sPGA score of clear (0) at Week 16 
•  Achievement of a Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) score of 0 or 1 at Week 16 
•  Ranked secondary endpoints in Part B: achievement of sPGA of clear or almost clear at Week 104. Of 
note, this endpoint will be analyzed in the final clinical study report (CSR). 
Other Secondary Endpoints Further endpoints see clinical AR’s. 
• 
Sample size 
Based on the interim results from 1311.2 (c03272682-01), it is assumed at most 10% of the patients in 
the re-randomized  risankizumabarm will lose sPGA response of clear or almost clear (0 or 1) at Week 52 
whereas approximately 25% of patients in the re-randomized placebo arm will lose response. Using a 4:1 
randomisation will yield a total sample size of 500 = 400:100 for risankizumab: placebo. Based on the 
outcome from trials 1311.1 and 1311.2, the PASI 90 response rate at Week 16 is assumed to be at least 
65% in the risankizumab arm and approximately 5% for placebo. For sPGA clear or almost clear at Week 
16, the response rate for the risankizumab arm is assumed to be at least 80% and approximately 5% for 
placebo. This trial will have >99% power for comparing each risankizumab arm to placebo on both of 
these endpoints.

• 
Randomisation 
At Visit 2, patients were randomized in blocks to double-blind treatment to either risankizumab 150 mg or 
placebo in a 4:1 ratio. Randomisation will be stratified with respect to weight (≤ 100 kg vs. >100 kg) and 
prior exposure to TNF antagonists (0 vs. ≥1). At week 28, patients were separated into “responder” and 
“non-responder”  groups.  A  patient  were  considered  as  a  “responder”  if  the  week  28  sPGA  is  clear  or 
almost  clear  (0  or  1);  otherwise  the  patient  were  considered  a  “non-responder”.  Among  responders, 
patients originally randomized to risankizumab 150 mg (Arm 1) were rerandomized in a 1:2 ratio to either 
150  mg  of  risankizumab  or  placebo  in  a  second  double-blinded  portion  (Part  B)  of  the  trial. 
Re-randomisation was stratified by weight (≤ 100 kg vs. >100 kg) and prior exposure to TNF antagonists 
(0 vs. ≥1). Patients originally randomized to placebo (Arm 2) continued to receive blinded study drug 
every 12 weeks in Part B of the trial, to maintain the blind to the original randomized treatment arm. 
Regardless of originally randomized treatment group, non-responders received open label risankizumab 
every 12 weeks, starting at Week 28, for the remainder of the trial. 
• 
Blinding (masking) 
During “Part A” of this trial all patients received double-blind treatment. At Week 28, the start of “Part B”, 
non-responders (sPGA≥ 2) from Arm 1 and 2 received open label drug and will know future treatments 
are risankizumab. 
At Week 28, responders (sPGA of 0 or 1) from Arm 1 in “Part A” were re-randomized to either maintain 
treatment of risankizumab or to receive placebo; these treatments were be double-blinded to ensure that 
patients and investigators remain blinded to re-randomized treatment during “Part B.” To maintain 
blinding, if a patient in Arm 2 reaches a sPGA of 0 or 1 at Week 28, continued to receive blinded 
risankizumab treatment assigned from IRT. 
• 
Statistical methods 
Part A 
Statistical analyses of the primary and secondary efficacy endpoints were conducted in the 
Intention-to-treat population comprising all subjects randomised to one of the two treatment arms 
(risankizumab 150 mg and placebo) at week 0. Subjects were analysed according to the treatment group 
to which they were randomised, regardless of any protocol deviations.  
The primary null hypothesis is that risankizumab is not different to placebo in achieving ≥ 90% reduction 
from baseline in the PASI score (PASI 90) and sPGA score of clear(0) or almost clear (1) at week 16 in 
participants with moderate to severe chronic plaque psoriasis.  
In order to control the trial-wise type I error rate, both co-primary endpoints must be statistically 
significant simultaneously at the 5% level. Testing of ranked secondary endpoints was conducted in a 
hierarchical manner, only if both co-primary endpoints were rejected. 
The co-primary binary endpoints of PASI and sPGA (0 or 1) were each analysed using the Cochran-Mantel 
Haenszel risk difference estimate stratified by the stratification factors of baseline weight (≤ 100 kg 
versus >100 kg) and prior exposure to TNF antagonists (0 versus ≥1). The CMH weights proposed by 
Greenland and Robins were used. 
Binary secondary endpoints were analysed using the same method as for the co-primary endpoints. 
Differences between treatment groups on other continuous variables were analysed using ANCOVA with 
treatment group, baseline value and stratification factors in the model. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 81/181 
 
 
 
 
Additional secondary analyses, without multiplicity control, included time-to-event analyses of time to 
first endpoint and time to loss of endpoint, analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates for each treatment 
group and stratified log-rank tests for treatment group comparisons. 
Consistency of the treatment effect for the primary efficacy endpoints was examined in subgroup 
analyses over demographic and other baseline characteristics including age, sex, race, smoking status, 
BMI, baseline PASI score, baseline sPGA, psoriatic arthritis status, past treatment history and region. 
Similar analyses were conducted in the per-protocol population comprising subjects who were most 
compliant with the protocol in ways the sponsor believed could impact the observed treatment effect. 
The robustness of observed treatment effects for the co-primary and ranked secondary endpoints to 
alternative assumptions about the missing data mechanism was investigated in a number of sensitivity 
analyses. 
Non-response imputation was the default method for handling missing data for the co-primary endpoints. 
All subjects who dropped out of the study were treated as non-responders in the primary efficacy 
analyses. Intermittent missing values were imputed as responders if the first non-missing values pre- and 
post- the missing visit both indicated response to treatment; otherwise they were imputed as 
non-response. Subjects that took prohibited medications to treat psoriasis were handled the same as 
those that discontinued from the trial – i.e. subsequent visits following start of prohibited medication were 
considered as failure for binary endpoints. 
Last Observation Carried Forward was used as the primary method for handling missing values in 
continuous variables, and the secondary approach in the analyses of categorical variables. 
Complete case (or as-observed case analysis) was used as the secondary method for handling missing 
values in continuous variables. 
Multiple imputation was used as the sensitivity approach for the co-primary and ranked secondary 
endpoints. Imputation was primarily conducted under a missing at random assumption, although 
subjects who discontinued due to adverse event of “worsening of disease under study” were treated as 
non-responders at all subsequent visits. 
Logistic regression or MMRM models were proposed should it not be possible to apply multiple imputation 
approaches to the collected data. 
Part B 
Statistical analyses of the primary and ranked secondary efficacy endpoint were conducted in the 
intention-to-treat population comprising all subjects who were initially randomized to risankizumab 150 
mg and were subsequently re-randomised to one of the two treatment arms (risankizumab 150mg or 
placebo) at week 28. Subjects were analysed according to the treatment group to which they were 
randomised, regardless of any protocol deviations.  
The primary null hypothesis is that risankizumab is not different to placebo in achieving sPGA score of 
clear(0) or almost clear(1) at Week 52 among patients re-randomized at Week 28. This endpoint will be 
tested independently with a type I error rate of 0.05 
The null hypothesis for the single ranked secondary endpoint is that risankizumab is not different to 
placebo in the achievement of sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) at Week 52 among patients 
re-randomized at Week 28. This was tested using a two-sided test at the 5% level, only if the primary 
endpoint was rejected. 
The primary binary endpoint of sPGA (0 or 1) was analysed using the Cochran-Mantel Haenszel risk 
difference estimate stratified by the stratification factors of baseline weight (≤ 100 kg versus >100 kg) 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019

and prior exposure to TNF antagonists (0 versus ≥1). The CMH weights proposed by Greenland and 
Robins were used. 
Binary secondary endpoints were analysed using the same method as for the co-primary endpoints. 
Differences between treatment groups on other continuous variables were analysed using ANCOVA with 
treatment group, baseline value and stratification factors in the model. 
Time to loss of response and time to relapse were performed among those achieving response 
at-re-randomization, analysed using Kaplan-Meier estimates for each treatment group and stratified 
log-rank tests for treatment group comparisons. 
Consistency of the treatment effect for the primary efficacy endpoints  in Part B was examined in 
subgroup analyses over demographic and other baseline characteristics including age, sex, race, smoking 
status, BMI, baseline PASI score, baseline sPGA, psoriatic arthritis status, past treatment history and 
region. 
Similar analyses were conducted in the per-protocol population comprising subjects who were most 
compliant with the protocol in ways the sponsor believed could impact the observed treatment effect. 
Methods for handling missing data were identical to those for part A. 
Results 
• 
Participant flow  
A total of 507 subjects were randomized from 60 sites across 9 countries. Similar proportions of subjects 
discontinued study drug prematurely in the placebo and risankizumab treatment groups through Week 16 
(Part A1). Through Week 28, subjects who were randomized to risankizumab and received study drug at 
Weeks  0,  4,  and  16  had  low  rates  of  premature  discontinuation.  Of  the  407  subjects  randomized  to 
risankizumab, 403 completed Part A1 (through Week 16) and 399 completed Part A2 (through Week 28) 
and continued to Part B; 336 were sPGA clear or almost clear responders at Week 28. These responders 
were re-randomized in a ratio of 2:1 to withdrawal from risankizumab treatment (placebo;n = 225) or 
continue risankizumab treatment (n = 111) in Part B. Similar proportions of subjects discontinued from 
the study prematurely in re-randomized treatment groups (see figures below).

During  the  amendment  2  the  trial  design  was  amended  to  protect  the  blind  to  initial  randomized 
treatment. In the amended protocol, all subjects who had sPGA < 2 at Week 28 continued to receive 
blinded study drug, regardless of initial treatment group. Likewise, subjects who had sPGA ≥ 2 at Week 
28 received open-label risankizumab at Week 28 and every 12 weeks (q12w) thereafter, regardless of 
initial treatment group. This amendment was put in place before any subject reached the Week 28 visit.

Table 19: Psoriasis Medication History by Therapy Type, All Randomized Subjects (ITT_A1 
Population) 
In general demographic parameters were well-balanced across arms.Also baseline disease characteristics 
were well-balanced between arms. The majority of patients enrolled to this study had moderate psoriasis 
(79%) and 21% had severe psoriasis as per sPGA score.  
Mean PASI score was 21.17 in the placebo group and 19.9 in the risankizumab, mean BSA was 28.3% in 
the placebo group and 25.6% in the risankizumab group.  
55%  of  patients  received  biologic  therapy  before  enrolment  (36%  TNF  antagonist  and  41%  other 
biologic).These  medications  were  adalimumab,  etanercept,  infliximab,  onercept,  abatacept,  alefacept, 
briakinumab, brodalumab, efalizumab, ixekizumab and rituximab. 
Part B 
Part B (responders to blinded risankizumab re-randomized to either risankizumab (RZB/RZB/RZB) or 
placebo (RZB/RZB/PBO). ITT_B_R population  
Two groups: 
•  RZB/RZB/RZB- responders to blinded risankizumab re-randomized to risankizumab 
•  RZB/RZB/PBO- responders to blinded risankizumab re-randomized to placebo 
399 out of 407 patients originally assigned to risankizumab group in part A entered part B of the study. 
336 patents classified as responders were re-randomized to ether placebo (225 subjects) or risankizumab 
(111 subjects) 63 out of 407 from the original risankizumab group were classified as non-responders. 
Baseline demographic characteristics of responders who were re-randomized and participated in part B of 
the study was very similar to the initial study population (part A study).  For this population (ITT_B_R 
Population) mean PASI score was 19.9, BSA was 25% and the majority of subjects (80%) had moderate 
psoriasis.  
As indicated above  63 patients did not respond to risankizumab at entry of Part B and were included in 
the  ITT_B_NR  Population.  It  seems  that  in  the  group  of  non-responders  more  patients  had  severe 
psoriasis at baseline (27%) as compared to 19 % in the responders group and there were more females 
in this group. In addition mean weight was slightly higher at baseline in the non-responses group.  
•  Numbers analysed 
It is noted that 40 patients in the placebo-re-randomised group received rescue therapy whereas only 3 
such patients were in the risankizumab re-randomised group.

Primary endpoints  
There were 2 co-primary endpoints in this study w.g achievement of ≥ 90% reduction from baseline PASI 
score (PASI 90) at Week 16 and achievement of an sPGA score of clear or almost clear (0 or 1) at Week 
16. 
The co-primary endpoints were achieved. A statistically significantly larger proportion of subjects in the

Clear at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16, Part A1 (ITT_A1 Population) 
Statistically significant differences were observed between the risankizumab and placebo groups during 
Part A1 on measures of improvement of PsA (changes from Baseline in TJC, SJC, DAS28, and HAQ-DI), 
nail psoriasis (NAPSI), palmoplantar psoriasis (PPASI), and scalp psoriasis (PSSI) at Week 16. 
Among subjects with confirmed PsA, the risankizumab group had a statistically significantly greater mean 
reduction (–0.532 in Disability Index of the Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ-DI] score at Week 16 
compared with subjects in the placebo group (–0.138). In addition, larger proportions of subjects in the 
risankizumab group achieved a reduction ≥ 0.3 points in the HAQ-DI compared with the placebo group 
(45.2% versus 25.0%); however, the difference was not statistically significant due to the small sample 
size (31 subjects in the risankizumab and 12 subjects in the placebo groups). 
In  subjects  with  confirmed  PsA,  the  risankizumab  group  had  a  statistically  significantly  greater  mean 
change  in  tender  joint  count  (TJC)  (–3.4)  compared  with  the  placebo  group  (–0.9)  at  Week  16.  The 
risankizumab group also had a statistically significantly greater mean change in swollen joint count (SJC) 
(–3.6) compared with the placebo group (0.7) at Week 16. 
Significantly better results as compared to placebo were achieved also for The Dermatology Life Quality 
Index (no impairment):

Primary endpoint 
Part B – Re-Randomized Subjects -(ITT_B_R) population: All subjects who were randomized 
to Arm 1 at Baseline and re-randomized at Week 28 
In the statistical plan the proportion of re-randomized subjects who achieved sPGA of clear or almost clear 
at Week 52 was pre-specified as a primary endpoint for part B of the study.  
In  the  study  the  primary  endpoint  for  Part  B  was  also  achieved.  A  statistically  significantly  larger 
proportion of subjects who were re-randomized to continue risankizumab treatment in Part B achieved 
sPGA clear or almost clear at Week 52 compared with subjects who were withdrawn from risankizumab 
therapy (re-randomized to placebo). 
Of  note,  subjects  who  discontinued  due  to  AE  of  "Worsening  of  disease  under  study,"  or  received 
retreatment  with  risankizumab  for  relapse  during  Part  B,  were  counted  as  nonresponders  in  all  visits 
thereafter in the NRI and  MI analyses, and  will have their last observation prior to discontinuation or 
retreatment with risankizumab carried forward in the LOCF analyses.”

Pre-specified subgroups analysis  
Among subjects re-randomized to placebo or risankizumab, treatment effects in prespecified subgroups 
were in favor of risankizumab with 95% confidence intervals of the treatment difference excluding zero in 
the vast majority of the subgroups for sPGA clear or almost clear.

Secondary endpoints for part B 
Among Week 28 risankizumab responders who were re-randomized to continue risankizumab treatment 
or  to  withdraw  from  risankizumab  treatment  (placebo),  statistically  significant  differences  in  favor  of 
risankizumab were observed in proportions of subjects who achieved PASI 75, PASI 90, and PASI 100 at 
Week 52. 
Response rates for PASI 90, PASI 100 and sPGA of clear in re-randomized subjects supported the primary 
endpoint results (sPGA of clear or almost clear) for Part B. Statistically significantly larger proportions of 
subjects  who  were  re-randomized  to  continue  risankizumab  treatment  achieved  those  responses 
compared with subjects withdrawn from risankizumab treatment (placebo).

Time until loss of response and time until sPGA score of ≥ 3 (relapse) 
The interim analysis of data was performed before many subjects had lost response; therefore, a large 
number of subjects were censored by the cutoff date. However, the Kaplan-Meier curves showed a clear 
separation between the 2 treatment groups indicating a faster loss of response among subjects who were 
re-randomized to withdrawal from the treatment.

2.5.2.4.  Study M15-997 (1311.31) 
Title: A Multicenter, Open Label Study to Assess the Safety and Efficacy of Risankizumab for Maintenance 
in Moderate to Severe Plaque Type Psoriasis 
•  Methods: 
This Phase 3, single-arm, multicenter, OLE study was designed to investigate the long-term safety and 
efficacy of risankizumab 150 mg administered every 12 weeks in the treatment of moderate to severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis. Approximately 2000 subjects who meet the entry criteria were planned to be 
enrolled  in  this  study,  rolling  over  from  the  lead-in  Studies  M16-008,  M15-992,  M15-995,  M16-010, 
M16-004,  and  M16-178  (Phase  2/3,  randomized  clinical  studies  in  subjects  with  moderate  to  severe 
chronic plaque psoriasis conducted by AbbVie or BI). 
To enter Study M15-997, all subjects must have completed 1 of the lead-in Phase 2/3 psoriasis studies. 
Subjects preferably have the baseline visit of Study M15-997 on the same day as the completion visit of 
the lead-in study; however, the Baseline visit can be delayed up to 8 weeks, if needed. 
Study visits for dosing and efficacy and safety assessments are performed every 12 weeks starting from 
baseline until the end of Treatment Visit at Week 156,

Table 32: Data Sets and Treatment Groups Analyzed in the Study M15-997 Interim CSR 
For the UST_RZB Population, all subjects switched from ustekinumab to risankizumab at entry of Study 
M15-997. Therefore, efficacy and safety results from all subjects are presented in the text of this interim 
report. 
For the ADA_RZB Population, subjects in 2 treatment groups switched from adalimumab to risankizumab 
at entry of Study M15-997: 
•  Subjects  who  were  re-randomized  to  adalimumab  at  entry  of  Part  B  in  Study  M16-010  who 
switched from adalimumab to risankizumab in Study M15-997 (denoted in this report as subjects 
re-randomized to adalimumab in Study M16-010 [in text] or Re-randomized to  adalimumab [in 
tables]) 
•  Adalimumab  responders  (subjects  who  achieved  PASI  90)  who  continued  with  adalimumab  at 
entry  of  Part  B  in  Study  M16-010  and  switched  from  adalimumab  to  risankizumab  in  Study 
M15-997 (denoted in this report as adalimumab responders [in text] or B_R [in tables]) 
This interim CSR does not include analyses of the following 3 additional populations described in the SAP, 
which will be used for efficacy analyses in the final CSR and are presented in the Integrated Summary of 
Efficacy: 
RZB Population: This population consists of subjects who were randomized to risankizumab in Studies 
M16-008 (1311.3), M16-010 (1311.30), M15-995 (1311.28), and M16-178. This population will be used 
to evaluate the long term efficacy of risankizumab with a loading dose. 
RZB_NL Population: This population consists of subjects who were randomized to placebo in the lead-in 
study and continued to risankizumab (without a loading dose) in Studies M16-008 (1311.3), M15-992 
(1311.4), and M15-995 (1311.28). This population will be used to evaluate the long-term efficacy of 
risankizumab without an initial loading dose.

Immunogenicity of risankizumab  was assessed using a 3-tiered approach. In  this tiered approach, all 
anti-drug  antibody  samples  were  first  analysed  in  a  screening  assay  (Tier  1).  The  samples  that  were 
screened positive were confirmed in the confirmatory assay (Tier 2) followed by the titer determination 
step (Tier 3) in which titers were determined for the confirmed positive samples. The confirmed positive 
samples were also evaluated in the NAb assay to detect the presence of NAbs. 
For  immunogenicity  assessment,  the  evaluable  subjects  (subjects  with  at  least  1  reportable 
immunogenicity assessment for at least 1 sampling time during the study postbaseline) were used to 
calculate the anti-drug antibody (treatment emergent) or NAb incidence. 
Incidence of anti-drug antibody (treatment emergent) to risankizumab was defined when a subject was 
(1) anti-drug antibody-negative or missing assessment at baseline (prior to first risankizumab dose) and 
became  anti-drug  antibody-positive  at  1  or  more  time  points  postbaseline,  or  (2)  anti-drug 
antibody-positive at baseline and showed a 4-fold or greater increase in titer values relative to baseline or 
a titer value of 2 or greater in at least 1 post-dose sample if the baseline titer value was less than 1 (in this 
case 4-fold increment over midpoint of 0.5 was used). 
The  time  to  first  appearance  of  anti-drug  antibody  was  also  calculated  among  the  antidrug  antibody 
(treatment  emergent)  positive  subjects  using  actual  time  following  the  first  dose  of  risankizumab  for 
subjects who received at least 1 dose of risankizumab in the study. 
The ADA and NAb to risankizumab across Phase 1 – 3 studies in subjects with psoriasis were characterized 
as follows: 
• 
• 
• 
In  the  Phase  1  single-dose  study  (Study  1311.1),  ADA  incidence  (treatment  emergent)  was  11% 
(2/18) and 0% (0/13) following single IV and SC risankizumab doses, respectively. 
In the Phase 1 therapeutic protein-drug interaction study (Study M16-007 [1311.36]); ADA incidence 
(treatment-emergent) was 24% (5/21 of subjects) following administration of risankizumab 150 mg 
SC doses every 4 weeks. 
In  the  Phase  2  study  (Study  1311.2),  ADA  and  NAb  incidence  (treatment  emergent)  were  14.5% 
(18/124) and 3.2% (4/124) following SC dosing with risankizumab over 48 week duration. 
•  For subjects who received the proposed clinical regimen of risankizumab in psoriasis (150 mg at Week 
0, Week 4, and q12w thereafter) in Phase 3 trials: 
−  The anti-drug antibody and NAb incidence (treatment emergent) to risankizumab was 19% and 
8%, respectively over 16 weeks duration (based on 1288 evaluable subjects) and 24% and 14% 
respectively over 52 weeks duration (based on 1079 evaluable subjects). 
−  The median time to appearance of ADA was 16 weeks across studies. 
A total of 16 subjects (out of 1079 evaluable subjects, representing 1.5% of ADA evaluable subjects) had 
ADA titer values greater than or equal to 128.

Antibodies) and Neutralizing Antibodies to Risankizumab for up to 52 Weeks Duration in 
Phase 2 and Phase 3 Studies in Subjects with Moderate to Severe Plaque Psoriasis

Based  on  the  population  pharmacokinetic  analyses,  ADA  to  risankizumab  did  not  have  an  effect  on 
risankizumab clearance or exposure in majority of ADA-positive subjects, with exception of few subjects 
(28/1807; representing 1.5% of ADA-evaluable subjects) who developed ADA titer ≥ 128 titer units, in 
which risankizumab clearance was estimated to increase by 43% and steady-state AUCtau was estimated 
to  decrease  by  30%,  on  average.  Presence  of  neutralizing  antibodies  (NAb)  to  risankizumab  was  not 
correlated with risankizumab clearance. 
To assess the effect of immunogenicity to risankizumab on efficacy, PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 responses 
were  compared  between  ADA-positive  and  ADA-negative  as  well  as  NAb-positive  and  NAb-negative 
subjects  using  pooled  data  across  Phase  3  studies.  The  Week  16  comparisons  were  done  using 
placebo-controlled population and ustekinumab-controlled population from Phase 3 studies. The Week 52 
comparisons were done using ustekinumab-controlled population.

Table 41: Risankizumab PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 Responses by NAb Status 
PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 responses at Week 16 and Week 52 were comparable between subjects who were 
ADA  or  NAb  positive  and  those  who  were  ADA  or  NAb  negative.  Additionally,  in  exposure-response 
analyses, the ADA and NAb status (positive or negative) were not found to be significant covariates for 
efficacy endpoints, PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100 or sPGA0/1 at Week 16 or at Week 52.

Study identifier 
M16-010 
Design 
Multi-national, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, active 
controlled, parallel-design study compared risankizumab with adalimumab. 
This study is designed to show a benefit of risankizumab over adalimumab in terms 
of PASI 90 response and sPGA scores of clear or almost clear at Week 16 
Duration of main phase: 
16 weeks 
Duration of Extension phase:  To week 44 
Hypothesis 
Superiority to Adalimumab 
At week 16 Patients who did not response to  Adalimumab PASI < 50 were switched 
to Risankizumab. Patients who achieved PASI < 50 but < 90 were re randomized to 
Risankizumab or continue with  Adalimumab. 
The study also examined whether patients who did not achieve a clinical response to  
Adalimumab would benefit from Risankizumab

2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Introduction 
The clinical development plan follows a standard clinical package for a new product for the treatment of 
plaque psoriasis and is in line with in line with scientific advice received from the CHMP and the Guideline 
on  clinical 
investigation  of  medicinal  products 
indicated 
for 
the 
treatment  of  psoriasis 
(CHMP/EWP/2454/02 corr).  
The  Applicant  has  conducted  an  extensive  clinical  development  program  in  support  of  the  marketing 
authorisation in moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. Risankizumab has been investigated in phase 2 
study (Study 1311.2) and three pivotal studies (studies M15-995, M16-008 and M16-010). In addition 
study M15-992 after the initial 28 weeks double-blind period investigated the effect of withdrawal and 
re-treatment  with  risankizumab.  Maintenance  of  efficacy  was  further  investigated  in  the  open-label 
extension study.  
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The study designs are agreed with respect to study design, duration, patient population, clinical endpoints 
and chosen active comparators.  
The co primary endpoints of PASI 90 and s PGA 0/1 are agreed as they are clinically relevant and in line 
with other centralised authorisations. Recent authorised products have demonstrated excellent results in 
terms of response therefore it is justified that higher PASI responses are measured (PASI 90 and 100), 
however, for comparative purposes, PASI 50 and PASI 75 are also useful parameters. 
The s PGA is considered a valid measure of psoriasis disease severity and has a more stringent definition 
for a score of 1 (“almost clear”) and 0 (Clear).  
PASI 90 was considered by CHMP to represent a clinically more relevant improvement over PASI 75, and 
the sPGA was considered to be a validated, standardised, global score that is recommended to be used in 
conjunction  with  PASI.  The  CHMP  advised  that  a  6-point  PGA  scale  (severe,  moderate  to  severe, 
moderate,  mild,  almost  clear,  clear)  should  preferably  be  used  in  account  of  comparability  to  recent 
studies in psoriasis. A 5-point scale was ultimately employed in the risankizumab studies. The 5-point 
sPGA scale used is similar to the scales used in recently approved drugs for psoriasis, including Tremfya 
and Cosentyx. The only real difference is an additional 'very severe' level at the 'high' end of the 6-point 
scale compared with the highest level of 'severe' for the 5-point scale. This difference is expected to have 
minimal impact on the patient population included in the clinical trials. 
Longer duration of effect at 44 and 52 weeks were measured and also quality of life measurements for 
patients in the trial. The applicant also developed and validated a patient reported outcome instrument, 
psoriasis severity  
The  pivotal  studies  were  multicentre  and  all  had  a  randomized  double-blind  placebo-  and 
active-controlled parallel group study design.  The co primary endpoints were assessed at week 16 for 
efficacy.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 119/181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Maintenance of effect was examined up to 52 weeks in studies M15-995, M16-008 or up to 44 weeks in 
study M16-010. In the M15-992 study it is planned to investigate the efficacy up to 88 weeks however in 
the interim report the data upto 52 weeks were provided. The long term extension study is ongoing with 
the plan to monitor efficacy up to week 156 and included in the RMP as category 3 study. 
The  included  patient  population  corresponds  to  the  definition  of  moderate  to  severe  chronic  plaque 
psoriasis in terms of disease severity (PASI score and body surface area) and were in need of systemic 
therapy. 
Patients enrolled had heterogeneous treatment history and varied from treatment naïve to prior failure to 
other biological therapies. Patients entering the trial were stratified on anti TNF failure and body weight (> 
or < 100kgs).  
Ustekinumab was chosen as an active comparator in studies M15-995, M16-008 and in study M16-010 
Adalimumab was the active comparator. Both are considered as acceptable as active comparators as both 
are prescribed in practise and have different pathways. 
Furthermore patients who were not adequately controlled on either of these active comparators were 
switched to Risankizumab to demonstrate whether additional benefit was observed. 
The efficacy results using Ustekinumab as an active comparator were similar to the original studies and 
therefore added to internal validity. 
As both studies M15-995, M16-008 were identical and the findings were consistent and therefore quite 
robust. 
The applicant has developed and validated a patient reported outcome instrument, psoriasis symptom 
scale (PSS). PSS is a patient-reported outcome measure developed by the Applicant.  This was aimed to 
detect  signs  and  symptoms  experienced by  a  patient  on  a  daily  basis.  During  validation  high  internal 
consistency- and test-retest-reliability were demonstrated. 
Study  M15-992  (1311.4)  was  placebo  controlled  randomized  double-blind  study  in  patients  with 
moderate  to  severe  chronic  plaque  psoriasis  evaluating  the  efficacy  and  safety  with  randomized 
withdrawal and re-treatment. In part A of this study subjects were randomized to one of 2 treatment 
arms: risankizumab (arm A1) or placebo (arm A2). At the Week 28 visit, all subjects were assessed for 
response.  Subjects  in  Arm  1  (originally  randomized  to  risankizumab)  who  met  the  protocol-defined 
response criterion (Static Physician Global Assessment [sPGA] clear or almost clear) were re-randomized 
in a ratio of 1:2 to double-blind risankizumab or placebo (part B of the study). Beginning at Week 32, all 
subjects in who received blinded study drug or placebo at Week 28 and had sPGA ≥ 3 (relapse) were 
switched to open-label risankizumab.  
The study design was in line with the current EMA guidance on clinical investigation of products for the 
treatment of psoriasis. The subsequent withdrawal and re-treatment phase allows examining the duration 
of response, rebound and time to relapse.  
The clinical studies were adequately powered to detect clinically meaningful differences between groups 
on the primary endpoints. The statistical methods used to analyse the primary and secondary endpoints 
were appropriate with adequate control of the study-wise type I error. The methods for handling missing 
data were appropriate given the context of the disease under study, the limited proportion of missing data 
observed in each study and the magnitude of the observed treatment effects. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Dose response studies 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 120/181 
 
 
 
 
The recommended dose and dosing regimen used in the Phase 3 studies were selected based on safety, 
efficacy and pharmacokinetic data from the Phase 1 (Study 1311.1) and Phase 2 (Study 1311.2) studies 
in adult patients with plaque psoriasis, formulation considerations, patient acceptability considerations, 
as well as exposure-response analyses. 
An  indirect-response  PK-PD  model  was  developed  using  PK  and  time  course  of  PASI  score  data  from 
Studies 1311.1 and 1311.2. 
The PK-PD modelling is in agreement with the clinical data where modelling indicates the 150 mg SC dose 
provides efficacy at the plateau of exposure-response relationship for efficacy. Doses above 150 mg were 
predicted to result in minimal improvements (< 5%) in PASI 90 or PASI 100 responses. The modelling 
also predicted that inclusion of the additional dose at week 4 would provide higher PASI 90 response rates 
at earlier time points (e.g., Week 12 and Week 16) compared with regimens without this additional dose. 
In phase I first-in-human single dose study (study 1311.1), at doses of 0.25 mg/kg (~19 mg for 75 kg 
patient), 1, 3, and 5 mg/kg (~375 mg for 75 kg patient) by IV or SC administration, all active dose groups 
showed improvement in mean PASI scores at 24 week follow-up with doses > 1 mg/kg showing near 
maximal PASI reduction.  
For the phase II dose ranging study (Study 1311.2) 3 doses were selected e.g mg 18 SC single dose at 
Week 0, and 90 and 180 mg SC multiple doses at Weeks 0, 4, and 16. In this study the dose-response was 
evaluated on outcomes such as PASI responder rates at 90% at week 12 (primary endpoint), 75, 50 and 
100% levels, PGA scores and DLQ index. This is in line with the EMA psoriasis Guideline that recommends 
using a global psoriasis endpoint along with PASI response.  
The  selected  study  population  was  compatible  with  the  patient  population  in  the  pivotal  studies  and 
representative of the target population. 
In this study, overall, best results were obtained for 90mg and 180 mg dose as compared to 18 mg for 
which a significant difference as compared to Stelara was not seen for most endpoints.  
For doses 90 mg and 180 mg dose mixed efficacy results were reported. Both 90mg and 180 mg doses 
were superior as compared to Stelara for PASI 90 at Week 12 but not for PASI 90 at Week 24, as at this 
time  point only  180  mg  dose  was  better  to  Stelara.  Also  at  Week  12  the  90mg  dose  was  superior to 
Stelara for PASI 75.  
In  line  with  the  SmPC  the  recommended  dose  is  150  mg  (two  75  mg  injections)  administered  by 
subcutaneous injection at Week 0, Week 4, and every 12 weeks thereafter. 
The  150  mg  dose  and  dosing  regimens  (e.g.  Week  0,  Week  4,  and  every  12  weeks  thereafter)  was 
selected  based  on  the  results  of  the  Population  Pharmacokinetic  and  Exposure-Response  Analyses  of 
Risankizumab from Phase 1 and 2 Studies in Subjects with Psoriasis  which included data from phase I 
(study 1311.1) and phase II study (study 1311.2). It can be noted that the proposed dosage regimen is 
the same as the posology approved for Stelara (ustekinumab), with the same target (IL-23) and with a 
similar half-life as risankizumab (approximately 3 weeks). 
Under the proposed regimen, doses of 150 mg are predicted to result in near maximal PASI 90 and PASI 
100 rates; additional increases in dose of risankizumab up to two-fold (300 mg) are predicted to result in 
no more than a 5% increase in PASI 90 response rates.  
In  addition  alternative  dosing  regimens  were  investigated  in  this  PK/PD  analysis.  Based  on  PK-PD 
considerations alone, the 0, week4 q8 regime offers only minimal advantages over q12 while for q16 
decreased efficacy was observed. It is noted that the predicated time to the first loss of PASI 90 response 
for doses >90 mg was long e.g. > 300 days. It is known that patients with psoriasis tend to be overweight 
or obese. Some of the biological products approved for use in psoriasis have a weight-based posology 
CHMP assessment report

(Remicade, Stelara), while others don´t (e.g. Humira, Enbrel and Cosentyx). For Stelara (ustekinumab), 
a cut-off is applied, with patients weighing >100 kg receiving the double dose. The applicant claims that 
the weight-based posology is not required as the predicted median response rates for PASI 90 and PASI 
100 would only differ by about 5% for a body weight of 60 kg vs. 120 kg based on the PASI PK-PD model.  
Phase 3 studies  
A total of 2109 subjects were randomized in the Phase 3 studies.  Of those subjects, 1306 were 
randomized to risankizumab.  An additional 375 subjects switched to risankizumab in later parts of the 
pivotal studies, and 348 subjects switched to risankizumab in the open-label extension Study M15-997.   
Studies M15-995, M16-008 
For  the  identical  phase  3  studies  M15-995,  M16-008  the  co  primary  endpoints  were  statistically 
significantly higher for Risankizumab treatment compared to both placebo and Ustekinumab. 
Starting  at  Week  12,  statistically  significant  differences  in  favour  of  risankizumab  for  proportions  of 
subjects who achieved all PASI 75/90/100, as well as sPGA of clear/clear or almost clear were observed. 
At week 16 PASI 90 responses were 74.8% to 75.3 % with Risankizumab treatment compared to placebo 
responses of 2-4.9% and were statistically significant (p< 0.001). 
S PGA responses at Week 16, ranged from 83.7% to  87.8% compared with placebo (ranged 5.1 to 7.8%) 
and were also highly statistically significant (p< 0.001). 
Both  showed  similar  positive  results.  The  applicant  also  conducted  several  sensitivity  analyses  which 
supported the primary ITT analyses. 
Ranked secondary endpoints which involved comparisons to placebo and active comparator Ustekinumab 
were all statistically in favour of Risankizumab treatment. 
These endpoints included higher response rates such as s PGA clear at 16 weeks (ranged 36.8- 51 % P < 
0.001) and PASI 100 (ranged from 35.9- 50.7% P < 0.001) when compared to placebo. 
Higher responses were also seen in compared to Ustekinumab at week 16 sPGA 0/1 was between 22.1%- 
24.8% p < 0.001 and for PASI 90 at week 16 were 22.8 to 25.7% higher both p < 0.001. 
The  co  primary  endpoints  at  week  16  were  maintained  until  week  52  and  achieved  better  results 
compared to Ustekinumab s PGA was 17.2 to 17.5% higher P < 0.001 and for PASI 90 at week 52 30.15 
to 37.9 %  P < 0.001 in favour of Risankizumab. 
It was also noted that statistically significant improvement in more difficult to treat areas of psoriasis were 
noted such as Palmoplantar Psoriasis (PPASI), Nail psoriasis (NAPSI) and scalp psoriasis at 16 and at 52 
weeks with Risankizumab treatment.  This information will be added to the SPC in section 5.1. 
The applicant is asked to further discuss the NAPSI, PSSI, PPASI and PSS scores at baseline and the cut 
off values for mild moderate and severe categories.  
Improvements were observed in psoriasis involving the scalp, the nails, and the palms and soles at week 
16 and week 52 in subjects treated with risankizumab as mentioned below.

Also  the  improvements  in  psoriasis  correlated  with  improvements  in  quality  of  life  for  patients.  
Statistically  significant  improvement  in  DLQI  score  and  PSS  at  16  weeks  were  achieved  with 
Risankizumab treatment.  Additional endpoints included HAQ DI, HADS, and DLQI score form baseline, at 
later time points week 52 were also measured.  As some were comparable or better than Ustekinumab not 
all were statistically better further information is requested on their clinical meaning.  
The Company developed a PSS is a 4-item patient-reported outcome (PRO) instrument designed for this 
program that assesses the severity of psoriasis symptoms in patients with moderate to severe psoriasis. 
The PSS was developed based on published evidence supporting the development of 2 similar, proprietary 
PRO instruments: the Psoriasis Symptom Inventory and the Psoriasis. 
Symptom Diary. The PSS items assess severity of pain, itching, redness, and burning during the past 24 
hours.  These measures were developed in accordance with FDA PRO Guidance and have demonstrated its 
evidence of reliability, validity, and ability to detect change. 
The Applicant stated that responder definition (clinically meaningful changes) in PSS symptom and signs 
summary score was estimated by using both an anchor and distribution-based approach a change in s 
PGA  score  and  a  PASI  improvement  at  week  16  were  considered  as  reasonable  anchors  to  establish 
response 
The  psychometric  analysis  findings  support  the  validity  and  responsiveness  of  the  PSS.  Additionally, 
cumulative distribution functions indicate that across the full distribution of changes in PSS total score, 
risankizumab is associated with greater percentages of patients with improvement in psoriasis-related 
symptoms versus placebo or ustekinumab. 
The Applicant also conducted extensive subgroup analyses in the population for each co primary endpoint 
and showed clear separation from placebo in each group. 
In  the  phase  3  studies,  all  protocol  amendments  occurred  before  database  lock.  Protocol  violations 
discussed by the Applicant in the CSRs could not influence the integrity of studies.  
However  a  GCP  issue  was  noted  and  occurred  in  study  M15-995.  One  Site  was  closed  during  study 
conduct due to failure of the site to adhere to the signed agreement, the study protocol and procedures, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 123/181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and GCP. The 11 subjects enrolled at this site were excluded from the efficacy and safety analyses as 
planned in the SAP.  
A sensitivity analysis of the co-primary endpoints at Week 16 including these subjects was generated, 
however did not affect the results.  
Study M16-010 
This  was  a  Phase  3,  multi-national,  multicentre,  randomized,  double-blind,  double-dummy,  active 
controlled, parallel-design study compared risankizumab (RZB) with adalimumab. 
This study is designed to show a benefit of risankizumab over adalimumab in terms of PASI 90 response 
and sPGA scores of clear or almost clear at Week 16, duration was 44 weeks and enrolled 605 patients in 
a 1:1 ratio. 
At Week 16, patients initially on adalimumab and >PASI 50 and <PASI 90 will be re-randomised 1:1 to 
receive either risankizumab or adalimumab, Patients achieving < PASI 50 were switched to Risankizumab 
and those achieving PASI > 90 continued on Adalimumab. 
The trial population and endpoints were similar to the identical phase 3 studies (M15-995 and M16-008). 
Psoriasis  medication  history  was  generally  balanced  among  inadequate  adalimumab  responders  who 
were re-randomized to risankizumab compared with adalimumab. However, a notably larger proportion 
of subjects who were re-randomized to risankizumab (60.4%) had prior non-biologic systemic therapy 
compared with subjects re-randomized to adalimumab (41.1%). 
The co primary endpoints were statistically significantly in favour of Risankizumab treatment at 16 weeks. 
PASI 90; 72.4 % compared to 47.4% and sPGA 83.7% compared to 60.2% (both p < 0.001 risankizumab 
and Adalimumab resp). 
A statistically higher proportion of patients re randomised to Risankizumab arm after 16 weeks (patients 
who achieved PASI > 50 and < 90 previously treated on ADA) achieved PASI 90 or s PGA response at 
week 44. This was also supported by the sensitivity analyses. The response rate for PASI 90 is slightly 
lower 66% compared to 72.4 % initially (i.e. at 16 weeks) and also for s PGA response of 0/1 was 73.6% 
compared to 83.7% at week 16, however this may because the population could be more difficult to treat. 
Subjects who received continuous risankizumab saw persistent or increased responses until the end of 
the  study;  157/301  (52.2%)  achieved  sPGA  clear  159/301  (52.8%)  achieved  PASI  100  at  Week  44. 
However it was not clear how the PASI 90 at week 52 and s PGA responses in patients who continued on 
Risankizumab throughout the study compared to the identical phase 3 studies M15-995 and M16-008. 
Overall however a statistically significant better response was demonstrated compared to Adalimumab 
and patients who did not achieve the target response of PASI 90 or s PGA response achieved significantly 
better results when switched to risankizumab. 
Study M15-992 
There were 2 co-primary endpoints in this study e.g achievement of ≥ 90% reduction from baseline PASI 
score (PASI 90) at Week 16 and achievement of an sPGA score of clear or almost clear (0 or 1) at Week 
16. 
The objectives of part B of the M15-992 (1311.4) study was to investigate the maintenance of response 
following drug withdrawal and to assess response after retreatment. Cases of relapse and the potential 
cases of rebound effect were also planned to be captured.  
The maintenance of effect was measured by the achievement of an sPGA of clear or almost clear (0 or 1) 
at Week 52 for subjects who were re-randomization to either risankizumab or placebo at week 28. This 
CHMP assessment report

was the primary endpoint for Part B of this study. In this analysis subjects who discontinued due to AE of 
"Worsening of disease under study," or received retreatment with risankizumab for relapse during Part B, 
were counted as nonresponders. For patients re-randomised at Week 28 time until loss of sPGA of 0 or 1 
response, time until sPGA score of ≥ 3 (relapse) and the time until loss of PASI 50, PASI 75, PASI 90, and 
PASI 100 were also investigated.  
A  total  of  507  subjects  were  randomized  to  part  A  of  the  study  (407  patients  received  blinded 
risankizumab and 100 received placebo). 399 out of 407 patients originally assigned to the risankizumab 
group in part A entered part B of the study. 336 patients classified as responders were re-randomized to 
ether placebo (225 subjects) or risankizumab (111 subjects). 63 out of 407 subjects from the original 
risankizumab group were classified as non-responders.   
In  general  demographic  parameters  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  were  well-balanced  between 
arms. The mean age of enrolled subjects was 49.2 years, the majority of subjects were male and only 
18% of patients had normal body weight. 55% of patients received biologic therapy before enrolment 
(36%  TNF  antagonist  and  41%  other  biologic).  The  majority  of  patients  enrolled  to  this  study  had 
moderate psoriasis (79%) and 21% had severe psoriasis as per sPGA score. Mean PASI score was 21.17 
in the placebo group and 19.9 in the risankizumab, mean BSA was 28.3% in the placebo group and 25.6% 
in the risankizumab group. 
Baseline demographic characteristics of responders who were re-randomized and participated in part B of 
the study was very similar to the initial study population (part A study). 
As indicated above 111 out of 336 patients did not respond to risankizumab and 63 patients from this 
group were included in the ITT_B_NR Population. The comparison of baseline characteristic of patients 
who responded to treatment (ITT_B_R Population) to those who did notrespond was further clarified upon 
request. It seems that in the group of non-responders more patients had severe psoriasis at baseline 
(27%) as compared to 19 % in the responders group and there were more females in this group.  In 
addition mean weight was slightly higher at baseline in the non-responses group. 
Significantly better results as compared to placebo were achieved also for The Dermatology Life Quality 
Index. At week 16 in the risankizumab group 65% of patients achieved DLQI 0 or 1 as compared to only 
3 % of patients in the placebo group.  
The proportion of re-randomized subjects who achieved sPGA of clear or almost clear at Week 52 was 
pre-specified as a primary endpoint for part B of the study  
The primary endpoint in Part B was achieved and at day 52 statistically better results were observed in the 
groups  of  patients  who  were  re-randomized  to  risankizumab  as  compared  to  those  re-randomized  to 
placebo. It needs to be highlighted that the treatment effect was much smaller (26 % difference between 
the  treatment  groups)  as  compared  to  the  treatment  effect  recorded  during  the  initial  randomization 
period (A1). Such small difference between the treatment groups was due to the fact that at week 52 (24 
weeks after withdrawal treatment with risankizumab) 61.3 % of patients in the placebo group had still 
sPGA of clear or almost clear. 
The median time until loss of sPGA of 0 or 1 response in the placebo group was 218/31 weeks (25th 114 
days/16 weeks, 75th 290 days/41weeks), the median time to relapse (sPGA>=3) in this group was 288 
days/41 weeks. The median time until loss of PASI 90 in part B among subjects who achieved PASI 90 at 
week  28  was  209  days/29  weeks.  The  median  time  to  loss  response  could  not  be  estimated  for  the 
maintenance group e.g. patients re-randomized to risankizumab. In the phase II study (Study 1311.2) 
the time to the first loss of PASI90 response was longer and it was established (median) as 309 days/44 
weeks (for 90 mg dose) and 345 days/49 weeks (for 180 mg dose). No cases of rebound (defined as ≥ 
25% increase in PASI relative to baseline within 60 days after re-randomization) occurred in subjects who 
had risankizumab treatment withdrawn. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 125/181 
 
 
 
Statistically better results were observed in the risankizumab re-randomized group as compared to the 
placebo group for also other endpoints such as PASI 75, PASI 90 and PASI 100. 
In relation to the subgroups analysis the results better than placebo were observed in the vast majority 
of the subgroups. No difference as comparing to placebo were observed only in the following subgroups: 
race non – white, BMI<25 kg and for subjects from region Asia. 
40 patients who were sPGA responders at Week 28 who were re-randomized to withdrawal (placebo) in 
Part B and relapsed (sPGA ≥ 3), and had at least 1 dose of risankizumab re-treatment were analysed for 
the response.  It was noted that 85% (34/40) regained sPGA of clear or almost clear at 16 week after 
re-treatment. On the other hand only 65.0% achieved PASI 90 at Week 16 of re-treatment which is a 
slightly worse result as comparing to naïve patients who received treatment with risankizumab at the 
beginning of the study. It is noted that the re-treated subjects received risankizumab every 12 weeks 
without the induction dose (e.g. dose at week 4), unless they relapsed and re-treated before Week 70 in 
which case they would receive the Week 4 dose after relapse.  
Only 3 subjects who were re-randomized to continue risankizumab treatment relapsed and received a 
loading dose at least 16 weeks prior to the re-treatment data cut-off (22 September 2017); therefore, no 
conclusions were drawn. 
63  patients  did  not  respond  to  risankizumab  at  week  28.  However  it  seems  that  some  initial 
non-responder may respond later e.g 38.1% of these patients achieved sPGA clear or almost clear at 
Week 32, and 49.2% achieved sPGA clear or almost clear at Week 52. 
The Applicant proposed to include the following recommendation in the SmPC which can be accepted: 
Consideration should be given to discontinuing treatment in patients who have shown no response after 
16  weeks  of  treatment.  Some  patients  with  initial  partial  response  may  subsequently  improve  with 
continued treatment beyond 16 weeks. 
Study M15-997  
Study M15-997 (1311.31) study was a multicentre, open label study to assess the safety and efficacy of 
Risankizumab for Maintenance in Moderate to Severe Plaque Type Psoriasis.  
As indicated by the Applicant, the goal of the provided interim report was to present novel  efficacy data 
for  the  subset  of  subjects  who  were  switched  from  ustekinumab  (169  subjects)  or  adalimumab  (260 
subjects) to risankizumab at entry of Study M15-997.  
In general demographic parameters and baseline disease characteristics were similar to those reported 
for other studies. The mean age of enrolled subjects was 47.4 years, the majority of subjects were male 
(>70%) and less than 19% of patients had normal body weight. 
The majority of patients enrolled to this study had moderate psoriasis (>80%). Mean PASI score was 
19.03 for the groups of patients transferred from ustekinumab (UST_RZB group) and 19.61 for the group 
of patients transferred from adalimumab (ADA_RZB group), mean BSA was 22.8% in the UST_RZB group 
and 25.5% in the ADA_RZB group. 
In  general  in  both  groups  e.g  patients  transferred  from  ustekinumab  and  patients  transferred  from 
adalimumab the efficacy results improve with risankizumab treatment.  
Among subjects who completed Studies M15-995 (1311.28) and M16-008 (1311.3) on ustekinumab and 
switched  to  risankizumab  in  Study  M15-997,  the  proportions  of  subjects  who  achieved  sPGA  clear  or 
almost clear, sPGA clear, PASI 90, PASI 100, and PASI 75 increased at Week 12. For example sPGA clear 
or almost clear increased from 58.6% at study entry to 85.2% at week 12, whereas PASI 90 increased 
from 47.3% to 72.8%.  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 126/181 
 
 
 
Also  among  subjects  who  completed  M16-010  (1311.30)  study  on  adalimumab  and  were  switched  to 
risankizumab in Study M15-997, the proportions of subjects who achieved sPGA clear or almost clear, 
sPGA  clear,  PASI  90,  PASI  100,  and  PASI  75  increased  at  Week  12.    Among  initial  responders  who 
continued  with  adalimumab  and  switched  to  risankizumab  in  M15-997,  sPGA  clear  or  almost  clear 
increased from 78.5% to 90.6% whereas PASI 90 increased from 73.1% to 92.2%. Among subjects who 
were re-randomized to adalimumab and switched to risankizumab in M15-997, sPGA clear or almost clear 
increased from 32.7% to 70.4% whereas PASI 90 increased from 22.4% to 77.8%.The proportions of 
subjects who achieved sPGA clear or almost clear, sPGA clear, PASI 90, PASI 100, and PASI 75 increased 
in  all  adalimumab  subgroups  including  adalimumab  responders  and  non-responders.  In  relation  to 
adalimumab  responders  very  good  resulted  observed  at  the  study  entry  were  further  improved  with 
treatment with risankizumab. 
Efficacy and Antibodies to Risankizumab 
For subjects who received the proposed clinical regimen of risankizumab in psoriasis (150 mg at Week 0, 
Week 4, and q12w thereafter) in Phase 3 trials: 
−  The anti-drug antibody and NAb incidence (treatment emergent) to risankizumab was 19% and 
8%, respectively over 16 weeks duration (based on 1288 evaluable subjects) and 24% and 14% 
respectively over 52 weeks duration (based on 1079 evaluable subjects). 
−  The median time to appearance of ADA was 16 weeks across studies. 
−  A  total  of  16  subjects  (out  of  1079  evaluable  subjects,  representing  1.5%  of  ADA  evaluable 
subjects) had ADA titer values greater than or equal to 128. 
ADA positivity to risankizumab could be observed already at the baseline, after placebo treatment and in 
subjects  treated  with  ustekinumab  or  adalimumab.  Some  of  these  risankizumab  naïve  patients  were 
positive for anti risankizumab neutralizing antibodies as well. Based on the population pharmacokinetic 
analyses, ADA to risankizumab did not have an effect on risankizumab clearance or exposure in majority 
of ADA-positive subjects, with exception of few subjects (28/1807; representing 1.5% of ADA-evaluable 
subjects) who developed ADA titer ≥ 128 titer units, in which risankizumab clearance was estimated to 
increase by 43% and steady-state AUCtau was estimated to decrease by 30%, on average. Presence of 
neutralizing antibodies (NAb) to risankizumab was not correlated with risankizumab clearance. 
To assess the effect of immunogenicity to risankizumab on efficacy, PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 responses 
were  compared  between  ADA-positive  and  ADA-negative  as  well  as  NAb-positive  and  NAb-negative 
subjects  using  pooled  data  across  Phase  3  studies.  The  Week  16  comparisons  were  done  using 
placebo-controlled population and ustekinumab-controlled population from Phase 3 studies. The Week 52 
comparisons  were  done  using  ustekinumab-controlled  population.  The  incidence  of  ADA  and  NAb  to 
risankizumab  per  visit  was  comparable  from  Week  16  onwards  to  week  52,  indicating  stable  ADA 
incidence following longer term treatment. 
PASI 90 and sPGA 0/1 responses at Week 16 and Week 52 were comparable between subjects who were 
ADA  or  NAb  positive  and  those  who  were  ADA  or  NAb  negative.  Additionally,  in  exposure-response 
analyses, the ADA and NAb status (positive or negative) were not found to be significant covariates for 
efficacy endpoints, PASI 75, PASI 90, PASI 100 or sPGA0/1 at Week 16 or at Week 52.  
The applicant provided further data which showed that patients who are ADA negative or have titres < 
128 have similar results, however those with ADA titres ≥ 128 (n = 6 to 7) appear to achieve a lower 
response. However it is acknowledged that the numbers of patients was extremely small.

2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The clinical development plan consists of a standard clinical package for a new product for the treatment 
of plaque psoriasis and is in line with the Guideline on clinical investigation of medicinal products indicated 
for  the  treatment  of  psoriasis  (CHMP/EWP/2454/02  corr).  The  pivotal  clinical  studies  are  standard 
randomised  controlled  trials.  The  studies  are  agreed  with  respect  to  study  design,  duration,  patient 
population and clinical endpoints.  
The response to the 150mg given at baseline (loading dose), 4 weeks and every 12 weeks was statistically 
significantly than placebo and compared to Ustekinumab as well as Adalimumab. Furthermore improved 
efficacy was demonstrated in patients who had an inadequate response to Adalimumab treatment for 16 
weeks. The effects of implementing a loading dose at Week 4 versus dosing every 12 weeks with no 
loading dose were examined by comparing efficacy results from integrated results of 3 analysis 
populations. efficacy rates at later time points (Week 24 and later) are comparable across the 
risankizumab treatment groups, this is to be expected given that the loading dose impacts the early 
period of treatment (onset for high levels of efficacy) and that risankizumab plasma levels in the 
populations that did not receive a loading dose would be approaching steady state after 5 half-lives of 
risankizumab. The loading dose is particularly impactful at Weeks 8 and 12, the time points at which 
time-to-effect has been assessed.   
Maintenance of effect over 52 weeks was demonstrated in the 2 identical phase 3 studies and also over 44 
weeks when compared to Adalimumab. 
The results of the randomized withdrawal and re-treatment phase of study suggest that less frequent 
dosing interval or dosing based on patient’s response (on demand) instead of continuous administration 
every two weeks may be an option. It was finally agreed that the recommended dose is 150 mg (two 
75 mg  injections)  administered  by  subcutaneous  injection  at  week  0,  week  4,  and  every  12  weeks 
thereafter.  
As indicated above in the M15-992 study the median time until loss of sPGA of 0 or 1 response in the 
placebo group was 218/31 weeks (25th 114 days/16 weeks, 75th 290 days/41weeks), the median time 
to relapse (sPGA>=3) in this group was 288 days/41 weeks.   
The efficacy results demonstrated superiority of risankizumab over placebo at Week 16, and at Week 52, 
as the 95% confidence intervals of the treatment difference excluding zero in all subgroups. There was no 
clear subgroup identified interims of baseline disease, previous treatment of baseline demographics in 
which efficacy may not be optimal. 
Overall, the applicant has demonstrated clinical relevance and consistent treatment effect in moderate to 
severe plaque psoriasis with a comprehensive clinical dossier. Rapporteur overall therefore agrees that 
Risankizumab could be approvable for MAA subject to addressing the remaining list of issues. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Nine integrated analysis populations characterised the safety profile of risankizumab. Three integrated 
analysis sets, the Primary Safety Pool, Ustekinumab Controlled and All Risankizumab-Psoriasis, were 
identified by the applicant as primary to characterizing the safety and benefit/risk profile of risankizumab 
as they provide data regarding the short-term and long-term safety of risankizumab in subjects with 
psoriasis. 
As part of the responses to the day 120 list of questions the applicant produced a Safety Update Report 
(SUR) as an update to the CSS (Module 2, Section 2.7.4). This SUR provides approximately 7 months of 
additional safety data from the data cut-off for the initial submission (01 September 2017) and includes 
all data up to 29 March 2018 (SUR data cut-off) for both the All Risankizumab and All Risankizumab – 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 128/181 
 
 
 
Psoriasis analysis datasets. The additional 237 subjects included in this SUR for the All Risankizumab – 
Psoriasis Analysis Set were a result of new data from Studies M15-997, M16-178, and M16-004 
(1311.38). The additional exposure data is the result of subjects who initiated risankizumab since the 
initial submission, as well as continued follow-up data from Studies M15-992 (1311.4), M15-997, and 
M16-009 (1311.13). 
Integrated Analysis Sets –Primary Focus of this safety review 
Patient exposure 
Overall exposure 
Of the total 2,234 subjects exposed to at least 1 dose of risankizumab (18, 90, 150, or 180 mg), 1,590 
received at least 1 dose of risankizumab 150 mg with a total of 1,688.0 PY of exposure.  A total of 1,091 
subjects received risankizumab 150 mg for ≥ 1 year. Only 3 patients received risankizumab 150mg for 
greater than 18months. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 129/181 
  
 
 
 
 
In the Safety update report, the number of subjects exposed to at least 1 dose of risankizumab (18, 75, 
90,150, or 180 mg) in the psoriasis Phase 1, Phase 2, and Phase 3 studies increased to 2,471 subjects 
with  a  total  of  3351.6  PY  of  treatment  duration,  representing  an  additional1185.0  PY  of  treatment 
compared  with  the  duration  reported  in  the  initial  submission.  In  total,  1671  (67.6%)  subjects  were 
exposed to risankizumab for at least 1 year, 163 (6.6%) subjects for at least 2 years, and 85 (3.4%) 
subjects had ≥ 3 years of risankizumab treatment duration. 
Primary safety pool 
The total PY of exposure in the total risankizumab group was 420.7 PY and risankizumab 150 mg group 
was 395.3 PY.  This compares to study drug exposure of 89.9 PY, 72.3 PY, and 93.5 PY in the placebo, 
ustekinumab, and adalimumab groups respectively. 
Ustekinumab controlled safety population 
The  total  PY  of  exposure  for  the  risankizumab  group  was  584.0  PY  compared  to  190.8  PY  for  the 
ustekinumab group. 
Four studies were ongoing at the data cut-off date M15-997 (n=1392/2000); Study M16-009 (N=110) 
Study; M15-992 ongoing N=507/500 and Study M16-007.  
Subject Disposition 
In the primary safety pool there were higher study discontinuation rates for the adalimumab (4.3%) and 
ustekinumab (9.6%) groups compared with the risankizumab 150mg group (1.4%) and placebo group 
(3.7%).  However,  over  98%  of  patients  treated  with  risankizumab  150mg  completed  week  16.  The 
commonest reasons across all treatment groups for discontinuation were adverse events, withdrawal by 
subject, loss to follow up and ‘other’ reasons. High study completions rates (95%) were maintained over 
52 weeks for the ustekinumab controlled analysis group. For the All Risankizumab analysis.  The available 
data reveals a similar patient disposition pattern to that observed in the randomized control studies. Of 
the  1590  subjects  treated  with  risankizumab  150mg,  6.6%  discontinued  study  drug.  The  commonest 
reason  participants  dropped  out  of  the  studies  was  due  to  withdrawal  by  subject,  loss  to  follow  up, 
adverse events and other causes. 1.6% of subjects treated with risankizumab 150mg withdrew due to 
adverse events.  
Demographic  characteristics,  baseline  morbidity  and  co-morbidity,  as  well  as  use  of  concomitant 
medications were generally well balanced across the treatment groups and between the safety analysis 
groups. Across analysis sets, approximately one third of participants were female, 80% were white 3%

Black or African Americans,10% of subjects were between 65 and 74 years of age and approximately 1% 
were  75  years  of  age  or  older.  The  majority  of  patients  were  TNFI  naïve.  The  average  subject  was 
mid-forties in age and weighed approximately 90 kg. Although females, Black or African Americans and 
subjects  over  65years  were  underrepresented  in  the  study  populations,  however  the  results  are  not 
expected to be different from the studied population. 
Adverse events 
Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
In the first 16 weeks of the Phase 2 and 3 psoriasis studies (Primary Safety Pool), the incidence rates of 
overall AEs were higher than placebo but lower than those seen with ustekinumab and adalimumab. The 
rates of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were low overall and occurred at a lower rate in the 
risankizumab 150 mg group (2.7E/100PY) compared to placebo (9.8E/100PY) ustekinumab (4.0E/100PY) 
and adalimumab (6.3E/100PY).  At 16 weeks the exposure adjusted serious adverse event and severe 
adverse  event  rate  in  the  primary  safety  pool  is  lower  for  risankizumab  150mg  compared  with  the 
comparator groups (placebo, ustekinumab and adalimumab. 
Table 47: Overview of Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (Primary Safety Pool, 16 Weeks) 
Overall, the adverse event rate at 76 weeks decreases slightly to 245.7E/100PY. The SAE, severe adverse 
event rates  and discontinuations due to AE rates for risankizumab 150mg either decrease or remain 
stable over longer term exposure.

Treatment emergent adverse events 
Upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  viral  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  headache,  arthralgia,  and 
fatigue occurred in at least 2% of subjects in the risankizumab group (150 mg or total populations). The 
reporting  pattern  of  events  at  16  weeks  is  similar  across  the  treatment  groups  in  the  primary  safety 
analysis with a trend towards higher rates of AEs in the ustekinumab and adalimumab groups compared 
to  risankizumab  treated  group.    There  is  no  obvious  dose-related  impact  on  event  reporting  rates. 
Injection site AEs were reported by 1.5% of the risankizumab treated population compared with 1.0% of 
the placebo population, 3.8% of the ustekinumab groups and 5.6% of the adalimumab reported AEs this 
group which suggests that the SC injection site reactions were less frequent with risankizumab compared 
to adalimumab and ustekinumab. 
Common  adverse  events  were  predominately  mild  (>97%).    The  SOCs  with  the  highest  numbers  of 
subjects with severe events at 16 weeks were- Infections and Infestation SOC: 6 subjects with severe 
infections (2 cases of cellulitis, 1 each of herpes zoster, diverticulitis, osteomyelitis, sepsis).  Hepatobiliary 
disorders  3  subjects  with  severe  events  (cholecystitis,  drug  induced  liver  injury,  liver  injury). 
Gastrointestinal  disorders  SOC  2  subjects  (enterovesical  fistula  gastric  dilatation.  Cardiac  disorders  2 
subjects with severe events (acute myocardial infarction, aortic valve disease mixed).

After 52 weeks of exposure, the overall proportion of subjects with AEs in the risankizumab 150mg (70%) 
group was slightly lower than ustekinumab (79%). The most frequently reported AEs (≥ 5% of subjects) 
reported with risankizumab treatment were viral upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract 
infection,headache and arthralgia. 5.2% of risankizumab-treated subjects and 5.5% 
ustekinumab-treated subjects had AEs assessed as severe. The SOCs with the highest numbers of 
subjects with severe events were –Infections and infestations SOC seven subjects reported 8 types of 
events; cellulitis, pneumonia and sepsis (in 2 subjects each) pyelonephritis, osteomyelitis, herpes Zoster, 
gastroenteritis, diverticulitis. Cardiac disorders 6 subjects: SVT, mitral valve incompetence, coronary 
artery disease, Congestive cardiac failure, unstable angina, cardiac aneurysm. Gastrointestinal disorders 
4 subjects: GERD, gastric dilatation, enterovesical fistula, dysphagia.

Table 49: Most Frequent Adverse Events Reported in ≥ 2% of Risankizumab Subjects, by 
Frequency of PT in Descending Order (Ustekinumab Controlled Analysis Set, 52 Weeks) 
After long-term treatment with risankizumab 150 mg (up to 77 weeks [542 days]) influenza was the only 
new adverse event occurring  in ≥ 2% of Risankizumab subjects identified compared to those observed 
during the first 16 weeks of treatment. In the All-risankizumab 150mg group approx. 75% of patients 
reported an AE compared with approx. 50% of patients treated with risankizumab 150mg up to 16 weeks 
which could be explained due to the longer duration of exposure. Similar to the other safety analysis sets 
viral URTI and URTI, arthralgia and headache were the commonest adverse events.  5.7% of subjects 
reported severe events. The SOCs with the highest numbers of subjects with severe events (≥ 3 subjects 
in  the  All  Risankizumab  group)  were  Cardiac  disorders:  6  (0.3%  subjects:  coronary  artery  disease.), 
Infections  and  infestations  SOC:  sepsis  in  6  (0.3%)  subjects  each;  cellulitis  3  (0.1%),  pneumonia  3 
(0.1%). (See adverse events of special interest, serious adverse events and deaths).

Table 50: Most Frequent Adverse Events Reported in ≥ 2% of All Risankizumab Subjects, by 
Frequency of PT in Descending Order in the All Risankizumab Group (All Risankizumab – 
Psoriasis Analysis Set) 
In the SUR The frequencies of AEs overall in the All Risankizumab – Psoriasis Analysis Set increased from 
approximately  66%  to  76%,  which  is  attributed  to  the  longer  follow-up  period.  the  overall  TEAE 
exposure-adjusted  incidence  rate  did  not  increase  between  the  CSS  (236.0  E  100/PYs)  and  the  SUR 
(212.9 E/100 PYs). 
There was a notable difference in the rate of viral upper respiratory tract infections (15.6% of subjects in 
the  initial  submission  versus  1.3%  in  this  SUR)  and  nasopharyngitis  (1.6%  of  subjects  in  the  initial 
submission versus 21.7% in the SUR). This was due to a change in MedDRA versions between the initial 
submission (20.0) and this SUR (20.1). No other substantial increases in the rates of AEs of safety interest 
were observed in this SUR and no new events of interest were identified. 
Treatment related adverse events 
Treatment-related adverse events were reported in 12% of risankizumab group at week 16 compared to 
10% of placebo group, 15.1% of ustekinumab and 20.1% of the adalimumab treated population. Approx. 
20% of the 52 week ustekinumab controlled risankizumab 150mg treated group compared to 26% of the 
ustekinumab treated population and 20% of the overall risankizumab 150mg treated population reported 
treatment related AEs. The treatment related adverse event profiles are similar across all three safety 
populations  (URTI,  viral  URTI  ,  headache,  fatigue,  injection  site  erythematic)  with  the  exception  of 
injection site erythematic which is reported in ≥ 1% Risankizumab 150 mg Subjects  at 52 weeks and in 
the long term safety population  but not at  the 16 weeks primary safety analysis.

In the Safety update review the AEs most frequently assessed by the investigators as having a reasonable 
possibility of being related to risankizumab treatment (≥ 2% subjects) were nasopharyngitis (consistent 
with remapping of lower level terms from the PT of viral upper respiratory tract infection to the PT of 
nasopharyngitis in this SUR) and upper respiratory tract infection. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse  events  in  seven  areas  of  safety  interest  were  specifically  examined  because  of  their  higher 
prevalence  in  the  moderate  to  severe  psoriasis  population,  concerns  with  injected  immunoglobulin 
products, the immunomodulatory activity of the product, or by general regulatory interest. The areas of 
special interest identified were : Infections (including serious infections, tuberculosis (TB), opportunistic 
infections, fungal infections, and herpes zoster); injection-site reactions; hepatic events; malignancies 
(including  all  possible  malignancies,  malignant  tumours,  nonmelanoma  skin  cancer  [NMSC],  and 
malignant  tumours  excluding  NMSC);hypersensitivity  and  anaphylactic  reactions;  cardiovascular  (CV) 
events (including major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), extended MACE, and other CV events) 
depression and suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB). 
Infections  (including  serious  infections,  tuberculosis  (TB),  opportunistic  infections,  fungal 
infections, and herpes zoster) 
There was a higher rate of infection for subjects treated with risankizumab compared with placebo and 
ustekinumab but not adalimumab through Week 16, (22.1% for 150 mg risankizumab (90.8 E/100 PY) 
vs.  14.7%  (56.5  E/100  PY)  for  placebo,  24.3%  (104.2    E/100  PY)  for  adalimumab  and  20.9%  for 
ustekinumab (87.0 E/100 PY)). After 52 weeks of exposure, 44.8% of subjects treated with risankizumab 
(73.9 E/100 PYs) and 52.3% of subjects treated with ustekinumab (90.1 E/100 PY) reported infection AEs 
(Ustekinumab- Controlled Analysis Set). Over the entire psoriasis program, 40.8% of subjects in the All 
Risankizumab group (All Risankizumab – Psoriasis Analysis Set) reported infection AEs (75.5 E/100 PY) 
compared  with  50.1%  of  subjects  (72.1  E/100  PY)  in  the  SUR.  In  the  primary  safety  pool  the  most 
frequently reported infection AEs in the risankizumab 150 mg group (≥ 1% of subjects) were viral upper 
respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, and sinusitis. 
The proportion of infections classified as serious infections was low across all three analysis populations. 
In the Primary Safety Pool 0.4% (1.7 E/100 PY) of the risankizumab group vs. 0.3%(1.1 E/100 PYs) of 
placebo group  0.3% (2.1 E/100 PY) of the adalimumab group and 1.7% (5.3 E/100PY) of ustekinumab 
group  reported  serious  infections  with  most  being  single  events  without  a  clear  pattern  .  Cellulitis  (2 
reports) was the only SAE reported more than once. In the Ustekinumab controlled 52-week study 1.3% 
subjects in the risankizumab group experienced a total of 11 serious infections (1.8 E/100 PY) compared 
to  2.0%  subjects  in  the  ustekinumab  group  with  4  serious  infections  (2.0(E/100  PY).  For  the 
All-risankizumab  group,  29  (1.3%)  subjects  (1.7  E/100  PY)  treated  with  risankizumab  in  the  initial 
submission, reported  serious infections compared with 38 (1.5%) subjects (1.4 E/100 PY) in the safety 
update report.  Although the overall rate of serious infection is low, overall including the updated review 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019

through 29 March 2018, 5 reports of cellulitis, 7 reports of sepsis 5 reports of pneumonia, 2 reports of 
osteomyelitis and 2  reports of serious herpes zoster were reported. 
There was an increase in fungal infections reported in risankizumab treated patients compared to placebo 
and the Ustekinumab but not adalimumab at 16 weeks. Over 16 weeks 1.5% subjects in the risankizumab 
150 mg group experienced fungal infections (5.2  E/100 PY) compared to 0.3% of the subjects in the 
placebo  group  (1.1  E/100PY),  0.8%  subjects  in  the  ustekinumab  group  (2.6  E/100  PY),  and  2.0% 
subjects in the adalimumab group (7.4 E/100 PY). The event report rate remained stable over longer term 
exposure.  Over  52  weeks  4.0%  subjects  in  the  risankizumab  150mg  group  experienced  a  total  of  26 
fungal infections (4.2 E/100 PY) compared to 1.0% subjects in the ustekinumab group (1.0 E/ 100 PY). ). 
In the All- risankizumab group  the  event rate of fungal infections in the All-Risankizumab group  in the 
initial submission was 3.9 E/100 PY for Risankizumab 150 mg patients compared with 3.2 E/100 PY in the 
SUR.  
The commonest fungal infections reported in the risankizumab groups across all analyses included tinea 
cruris,  tinea  manum  tinea  pedis,  body  tinea,  tinea  versicolour,  and  fungal  skin  infection  and 
onychomycosis. These infections were generally mild to moderate in severity responsive to treatment and 
did not require treatment discontinuation.  
Ten cases of candidiasis were reported in the original overall safety analysis (Balanitis candida 1 case, 
Oral candidiasis 4 cases and oesophageal candidiasis 1 case, skin candida 1 case, vulvovaginal candidiasis 
4 cases) Oral candidiasis cases and oesophageal candidiasis are captured both as fungal infections and 
opportunistic  infections.  These  events  did  not  result  in  discontinuation  of  study  drug  and  were  not 
identified as cases of serious, systemic fungal infections in the studies. With longer duration of treatment 
as assessed in the SUR, 22 cases of candida infection and oral candidiasis were reported. The exposure 
adjusted event rates increased slightly for oral candidiasis from 0.2E/100PY to 0.3E/100PY otherwise the 
events rates remained unchanged. 
The overall event rate of opportunistic infections among risankizumab-treated subjects with psoriasis was 
0.3 E/100 PY. This remained unchanged over the additional time period covered by the SUR. In the initial 
submission, there was one event of laboratory diagnosis of CMV and 5 reports of oral candidiasis and 1 
report of oesophageal candidiasis. 
There were six reports (0.4E/100PY) of Herpes Zoster in the 150 mg arm including 2 that were classified 
as serious infections. Through the SUR data cut-off date, a total of 13 subjects (0.5%) experienced 14 
adverse events of Herpes Zoster. The number of reports of herpes zoster increased from 6 to 14 with 
inclusion of patients from the safety update.  However, when adjusted for exposure the rate of infection 
increased from 0.3E/100PY to 0.4E/100PY. The overall rate of herpes zoster remained broadly stable. 
There were no new serious cases of herpes zoster in the SUR. 
Regarding tuberculosis, the inclusion criteria specified that patients with active tuberculosis (TB) were 
excluded from the studies. Patients with latent tuberculosis could participate in the studies. All patients 
underwent  TB  Quantiferon  test  at  screening.  Across  the  Phase  3  psoriasis  clinical  studies,  of  the  72 
subjects with latent tuberculosis (TB) who were concurrently treated with risankizumab and appropriate 
TB prophylaxis during the studies, none developed active TB during a mean follow-up of 61 weeks on 
risankizumab. Ofthe 31 subjects in Study M15-992 who had latent TB  who did not receive prophylaxis 
during the study, none developed active TB during the mean follow-up of 55 weeks on risankizumab.. Of 
note there were no cases of active TB. Eight cases of latent TB (0.4%: 0.4/100PY) were reported over up 
to  77  weeks  exposure  to  risankizumab  150mg.  Overall  8  subjects  in  the  All  Risankizumab  group  (all 
doses) reported latent TB but had no clinical symptoms. One additional case of latent TB was identified in 
the SUR. There were no cases of active TB among risankizumab treated patients or cases of reactivation 
of latent TB. Overall the rates of opportunistic infections (0.3E/100PY) were low.

Injection site reactions 
The rates of injection site reactions were low across all safety analyses. At 16 weeks the proportion of 
subjects in the risankizumab 150 mg group who had injection site reaction AEs was higher than placebo 
(1.5% vs. 1.0%, respectively), but lower than with ustekinumab (3.8%) or adalimumab (5.6%). In the 
All Risankizumab Psoriasis Analysis Set 69 subjects (3.1%) reported injection site reactions compared 
with 84 subjects (3.4%) in the SUR. None of the injection site reactions were considered to be severe or 
led to study discontinuation. Injection site erythema was the commonest adverse event. Injection site 
reactions  (injection  site  bruising,  erythema,  haematoma,  haemorrhage,  irritation,  pain,  pruritus, 
reaction, and swelling) are included as common side effects in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Hepatic events 
During  the  16-week  treatment  period  hepatic  events  were  more  frequent  in  placebo  than  for  the 
risankizumab 150 mg treated group, 1.5% subjects in the risankizumab 150 mg group experienced a 
total of 24 hepatic AEs (6.0 E/100 PY) compared to 6 (2.0%) in the placebo group (7.6 E/100 PY). Overall 
(up  to  77  weeks  exposure)  AEs  were  reported  in  62  subjects  (3.9%)  (5.9/100PY)  treated  with 
risankizumab 150mg compared with 112 of subjects (4.5%) (5.4E/100PY) in the SUR. In the original CSS 
there were two reports of drug induced liver injury. One subject reported drug induced hepatitis and 1 
subject  reported  laboratory  hepatic  injury  -liver  injury.    Both  cases  were  confounded  by  underlying 
medical conditions and concomitant medications. Both cases of liver injury were considered to be related 
to study drug by the investigator. A further case in the Phase 2 psoriatic arthritis study, Study M16-002, 
met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s law 56 days after the last dose of study drug. This event occurred 
almost 2 months after receipt of study drug suggesting that treatment with risankizumab may have been 
unlikely to have played a role in the aetiology of this event. The investigator assessed the event as having 
a reasonable possibility of being related to study drug.  Severe cases of raised LFTs (4 cases of raised AST, 
3  cases  of  raised  ALT  and  1  case  raised  LFT  were  also  reported,  only  one  of  which  resulted  in 
discontinuation of study medication. In the SUR an additional two subjects are reported as having had 
serious hepatic AEs. In the first case the subject reported autoimmune hepatitis approximately 1yr after 
starting risankizumab. The patient had a history of hypothyroidism, dyslipidaemia and coronary heart 
disease.  Study  drug  was  discontinued  and  LFTs  normalised  following  treatment  with  prednisone.  The 
event was reported as ongoing and not related to study medication. In the second case a subject with a 
baseline history of compensated cirrhosis (aetiology not reported underwent additional diagnostic tests 
for  thrombocytopenia.  Radio-diagnostics  revealed  portal  hypertension  and  multinodular  liver,  and  a 
diagnosis of compensated cirrhosis was made.  
Liver function tests at the time of the diagnosis were not abnormal. Study drug was not interrupted due 
to this event and the event was considered ongoing as of the date of last contact. Both the Investigator 
and AbbVie considered the event of hepatic cirrhosis as having no reasonable possibility of being related 
to study drug and more likely due to the underlying cirrhosis.

Table 53:Summary of Hepatic AEs (All Risankizumab – Psoriasis) 
Cardiovascular  (CV)  events  (including  major  adverse  cardiovascular  events  (MACE), 
extended MACE, and other CV events  
The MACE analysis also included extended MACE and other CV events. There was no evidence of increased 
MACE events with risankizumab compared to placebo after 16 weeks of treatment. In the Primary Safety 
Pool, the MACE rate in the risankizumab 150 mg group was 0.2 E/100 PYs compared to 1.1 E/100 PYs in 
the  placebo  group.  No  MACE  events  were  reported  for  adalimumab  and  ustekinumab  in  the  initial 
16-week  analysis.  The  exposure  adjusted  event  rates  for  extended  MACE  (0.5/100PY)  and  other  CV 
events (0.5/100PY) for risankizumab 150mg  were lower than those seen in the placebo arm (1.1/100PY 
and 3.3 /100/PY respectively) 
 Over 52 weeks two (0.3%) subjects (0.3 E/100 PY) in the risankizumab group experienced a MACE whilst 
none of the patient in the ustekinumab comparator group experienced a MACE. 
In  the  overall  risankizumab  (all  doses)  analysis  a  total  of  9  (0.4%)  risankizumab-treated  subjects 
experienced  a  treatment-emergent  MACE  (0.5  E/100  PY)  of  which  5  (0.2%)  subjects  had  a  nonfatal 
myocardial infarction, 2 (< 0.1%) subjects had a nonfatal stroke and 3 (0.1%) subjects had a CV death. 
Originally  4  of  5  treatment  emergent  deaths  in  patients  treated  with  risankizumab  150mg  were 
adjudicated as CV deaths. One event originally described as sudden cardiac death was later attributed to 
an opioid overdose. All three deaths occurred in patients with multiple CV disease risk factors, including 
hypertension, hyperlipidaemia, diabetes, and past history of coronary artery disease and/or intervention. 
All were considered unrelated to study drug by the investigator. All the events occurred in males ranging 
in age from age 32 to 60 yrs. No cardiac deaths were reported for adalimumab or ustekinumab and only 
one cardiac death was noted in the placebo group. (see section on deaths for further details).In the SUR, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019

13 subjects (0.5%;0.4E/100PY ) experienced treatment emergent MACE(6 non-fatal MI,3 nonfatal stroke 
and  5 CV deaths (see sections on deaths). 
The overall MACE event rate (0.5 E/100PY) was shown by the applicant to be in the range of MACE rates 
reported for ustekinumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, and guselkumab at the time of their 
initial  submissions.  There  was  a  slight  trend  towards  increased  numbers  of  events  of  extended  MACE 
(0.8/100PY) and CV events (0.8/100PY) with exposure to risankizumab 150mg over the longer term. In 
the SUR, which included safety data up to March 2018 the numbers of events of  extended MACE and CV 
events were 0.6E/100PY  and 0.4E/100PY respectively. Although risankizumab did not appear to have any 
clinically significant effects on the cardiovascular functions (blood pressure, heart rate, or QT-interval) in 
the  majority  of  the  patients,  temporal  blood  pressure  excursions  were  experienced  by  5.5%  of  the 
risankizumab patients through Week 52. This proportion showed slight increase up to 6.8% in the SUR. 
(For further details see Laboratory findings-vital signs subheading of the Clinical Safety part of this AR.) 
Table 54: Summary of Adjudicated Cardiovascular Endpoints (All Risankizumab – Psoriasis) 
Malignancy 
After 52 weeks of exposure, the event rate of malignancies in the risankizumab and ustekinumab treated 
population was 0.5 E/100 PY. In the All Risankizumab – Psoriasis Analysis Set, 23 (1.0%,1.3E/100PY) 
subjects had malignant tumours in the initial submission compared with 35 (1.4%; 1.4E/100PY) in the 
updated  safety  summary.  In  the  All  Risankizumab  (150mg)  Psoriasis  Analysis  Set,  the  event  rate  for 
malignant tumours was 1.5/100PY.  Fourteen (0.6%) of those 23 subjects had NMSC, including basal cell 
carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma of skin, and Bowen's disease, with basal cell carcinoma being the 
most  frequently  reported  tumour.    The  exposure-adjusted  event  rate  for  basal  cell  carcinoma  and 
squamous cell carcinoma of skin were 0.6 E/100 PY and 0.2 E/100 PY, respectively.  One subject had 
Bowen's disease (< 0.1 E/100 PY). In the SUR a similar picture was seen .0.7% of subjects had NMSC.The 
exposure  adjusted  event  rate  for  basal  cell  and  squamous  cell  carcinoma  was  0.4E/100PY  and 
0.2E/100PY. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019

The most frequent non-NMSC malignant tumours were malignant melanoma in situ and prostate cancer 
that  occurred  in  2  subjects  each  (<  0.1  E/100  PY)  and  breast  cancer  in  3  subjects  (events  of  breast 
cancer, invasive ductal breast carcinoma, and invasive lobular breast carcinoma). In the SUR breast and 
prostate cancer occurred in 3 subjects each (<0.1E/100PY). 
Table 55: Summary of Malignant Tumour and Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer AEs (All 
Risankizumab – Psoriasis Analysis Set) 
Hypersensitivity reactions 
Over 16 weeks’ hypersensitivity event rates were 10.7 E/100 PYs in the risankizumab 150 mg group, 10.9 
E/100 PYs in the placebo group, 5.3 E/100 PYs in the ustekinumab group, and 11.6 E/100 PYs in the 
adalimumab group. The only notable difference between the placebo and risankizumab groups was the 
rates of eczema, rash and urticaria associated with risankizumab compared to placebo, which was 
reported in (0.8%) (0.2%) and (0.5%) of the risankizumab-treated subjects and (0.3%) (0.0%) and 
(0.3%) placebo-treated subjects respectively.  Over 52 weeks event rates were 7.9 E/100 PY in 
risankizumab 150mg treated group compared with 5.4 E/100 PY for ustekinumab . In the overall 
Risankizumab 150mg group the event rate was 8.5 E/100 PYs.In the SUR the event rate was 7.1E/100PY.  
Across both analyses the commonest hypersensitivity AEs (dermatitis contact, eczema, dermatitis, 
urticaria, and rash) were mild to moderate in severity. No subject exposed to risankizumab in the 
psoriasis clinical trials experienced anaphylactic reactions or serum sickness-like reactions. In the SUR 
one patient reported a case of erythema multiforme due to an insect bite.  Of note 2 additional cases of 
anaphylactic reaction were reported in subjects treated with risankizumab for Crohns disease (attributed 
to IV iron infusion and not considered to be related to study drug) and psoriatic arthritis (considered by 
investigator to possibly be related to study drug and resulted in discontinuation of study medication.

Following review by the applicant the case was not considered to be related to study drug).  No 
association between hypersensitivity and treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies was established.  
Summary of Hypersensitivity Reaction AEs (All Risankizumab – Psoriasis Analysis Set) 
Depression and suicidal ideation and behaviour (SIB) 
In the Primary Safety Pool, the depression event rates in the risankizumab150 mg group and placebo 
group were 1.0 E/100 PY and 2.2 E/100 PY, respectively. Depression event rates were 1.1 E/100 PYs in 
the adalimumab group and 2.6 E/100 PYs in the ustekinumab group. Overall the depression event rate 
was 1.2 E/100 PYs in the risankizumab 150 mg group. In the SUR (All Risankizumab psoriasis analysis 
set) the depression event rate was 0.9E/100PY. 
There were no completed suicides in the risankizumab treated population.  In the Primary Safety Pool, the 
SIB event rates were 0.5 E/100 PYs in the risankizumab 150 mg group, 1.1 E/100 PYs in the placebo 
group, 1.3 E/100 PYs in the ustekinumab group, and 1.1 E/100 PYs in the adalimumab group.One subject 
had a self-injurious ideation AE that was not serious and 1 subject had a suicide attempt that was serious. 
Both events of SIB were in subjects with multiple confounding factors. The applicant has indicated that 
the SIB event rate (< 0.1 E/100 PY) is comparable to other recent clinical development programs 
(guselkumab 0.10/100 subject-yrs., secukinumab, 0.06/100 subject-yrs.; ixekizumab, 0.14/100 subject 
yrs.) .There were no new cases of suicidal ideation and behaviour in the SUR. 
Adverse Drug Reaction 
Following a review of aall AEs reported during the 16-week controlled periods of the Phase 2 and Phase 3 
clinical  studies  and  a  review  of  events  with  longer  latency  and  rare  events  in  the  52  week 
Ustekinumab-Controlled Analysis Set, the OLE study data, and SAE reports from other indications, the 
CHMP assessment report

Sponsor  considers  the  following  events  to  be  adverse  drug  reactions  (ADRs):    upper  respiratory 
infections, headache, fatigue, injection site reactions, tinea infections, and folliculitis. Cough and pruritus 
occurred at a rate of ≥ 1% of subjects in the risankizumab group with a higher rate than the placebo group 
during  the  16-week  controlled  period  of  pooled  studies.  These  terms  have  been  included  as  ADRs  or 
justification for their exclusion should be provided.  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
Serious adverse events 
In the primary safety pool (16 weeks), Thirty-one (2.4%) subjects in the risankizumab 150 mg group (9.9 
E/100 PY), compared to 12 (4.0%) subjects in the placebo group (17.4E/100 PY), 12 (5.0%) subjects in 
the ustekinumab group (18.4 E/100 PY), and 9(3.0%) subjects in the adalimumab group (14.7E/100 PY) 
had SAEs. Five subjects treated with risankizumab had SAEs that were assessed by the investigators as 
possibly  being  related  to  study  drug:  drug-induced  liver  injury,  liver  injury,  cellulitis,  herpes  zoster, 
osteomyelitis,  and  asthma.  SAEs  resulting  in  discontinuation  of  study  drug  were  cardiac  failure 
congestive, drug-induced liver injury, liver injury, invasive lobular breast carcinoma, and oesophageal 
carcinoma. 
After 52 weeks of exposure, 42 (7.0%) subjects in the risankizumab 150mg group had SAEs (9.4E/100 
PY) compared to 18 (9.0%) subjects in the ustekinumab group (10.9E/100PY). SAEs reported by more 
than 1 risankizumab-treated subject were cardiac failure congestive, coronary artery disease, cellulitis, 
pneumonia, sepsis, basal cell carcinoma, and abortion spontaneous (2 subjects each). 8 (1.3%) subjects 
in the risankizumab group had SAEs in the cardiac disorder SOC compared to 1 (0.5%) subject in the 
ustekinumab group. 5 subjects had SAEs assessed by the investigators as being possibly related to study 
drug 1 subject each had drug-induced liver injury, herpes zoster, and pneumonia; 1 subject had cellulitis 
and osteomyelitis; and 1 subject had pyelonephritis and sepsis. 
In the All Risankizumab 150mg Group 6.9% had SAEs (9.9 E/100 PY) compared with 8.3% (9.3E/100PY) 
of subjects in the SUR (All Risankizumab Psoriasis Analysis Set). The most frequently reported SAEs (≥ 3 
All  Risankizumab  subjects)  were  basal  cell  carcinoma,  sepsis,  cellulitis,  pneumonia,  coronary  artery 
disease,  transient  ischemic  attack,  squamous  cell  carcinoma  of  skin,  cardiac  failure  congestive,  and 
myocardial infarction. New SAEs reported ≥3 subjects in the SUR acute MI, breast cancer, cholecystitis, 
cholelithiasis, depression, erisypelas, fall, ischaemic stroke, osteoarthritis, prostate cancer and syncope.  
Infections and infestations was the SOC with the highest number of subjects with SAEs. Overall SAEs 
were most commonly reported in the Cardiac Disorders Infections, Neoplasm and Hepatic Disorders SOC 
across  all  three  analyses  populations.  Overall  a  total  23  subjects,  16  of  whom  were  treated  with 
risankizumab  150mg  had  SAEs  assessed  by  the  investigator  as  possibly  being  related  to  study  drug 
compared  with  1.6%;  1.5E/100PY  in  the  SUR.    Most  SAEs  assessed  as  related  by  the  investigator 
occurred in 1 subject.  The SAEs which occurred in more than 1 subject were cellulitis, erysipelas, herpes 
zoster, osteomyelitis, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, and basal cell carcinoma (2 subjects each) and 
sepsis (5 subjects 3 of whom were treated with RZB150mg). Two notable SAEs that occurred in the SUR 
were  one  case  of  autoimmune  encephalitis  and  one  case  of  demyelination.  The  case  of  autoimmune 
encephalitis was not confirmed. There are limited details and relationship to study drug is not discussed. 
The case of demyelination was reported in a subject (with a history of focal demyelinating changes at 
baseline), approximately 9 months after starting therapy with risankizumab. The investigator considered 
the  event  as  having  a  reasonable  possibility  of  being  related  to  study  drug  whereas  the  applicant 
considered there was no reasonable possibility of the event being related to study drug.

In the original safety summary, deaths were reported in 5 male subjects treated with risankizumab and 
2 subjects treated with adalimumab. An additional 5 new deaths were reported in the SUR . 
Of  the  5  deaths  reported  in  the  original  application  in  risankizumab-treated  subjects,  4  were 
treatment-emergent (i.e., occurred within 105 days after the last dose of risankizumab).   There were no 
deaths in the clinical studies conducted in other (non-psoriasis) indications. Four of the deaths occurred 
>50  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug.  One  death  was  reported  9  days  following  last  dose  of 
risankizumab 150mg (acute myocardial infarction [MI]).  Of the 5 deaths, 2 were adjudicated as cardiac 
deaths  (Acute  MI  and  sudden  cardiac  death)  however  one  of  these  was  later  attributed  to  a  drug 
overdose, 2 were due to unknown cause, and 1 was a cancer death. The two cases attributed as ‘due to 
unknown  cause’,  had  complex  background  cardiovascular  comorbidities  and  in  the  absence  of  an 
alternative aetiology, are likely to be cardiac in nature. 
Table 56: Listing of All Deaths in Phase 2/3 Psoriasis Studies 
Five new deaths were reported as of the SUR data cutoff, all of which occurred in psoriasis studies in 
subjects treated with risankizumab. The 5 new deaths all occurred in male patients ranging in age from 37 
to  74  years  of  age.  Cause  of  death  was,  epileptic  seizure(undetermined  death),death(adjudication 
pending),  pancreatitis(undetermined  death),cardiac  arrest  (adjudication  pending)  and  cardiac  failure 
(adjudication pending). All of the deaths occurred 14-88 days after the last dose of study drug. One death 
was reported 14 days following last dose of risankizumab 150mg (pancreatitis undetermined death). The 
five new deaths are highlighted in bold in the table below.

Laboratory findings 
For haematology, mean changes from Baseline with risankizumab treatment groups were small and were 
not considered to be clinically meaningful. Rates were comparable to adalimumab and ustekinumab with 
no significant differences to placebo at 16 weeks. Following longer term exposure CTC toxicity grade 3 
was noted for decreased Hb 1 case, platelets 1 case , leucocytes 4 cases, lymphocytes 6 cases)  Grade 4 
CTC toxicity values were  observed for neutrophils decreased and lymphocytes decreased in 1 subject 
each. There were no significant increases in the frequencies of clinically important haematology values 
between the initial submission and the SUR. 
For clinical chemistry, mean changes from Baseline with risankizumab treatment groups were small and 
were not considered to be clinically meaningful. Rates were comparable to adalimumab and ustekinumab 
with no significant differences to placebo at 16 weeks. 
The  most  common  CTC  grade  ≥ 3  clinical  chemistry  abnormalities  over  long  term  exposure  in  the 
risankizumab group were elevations in glucose, and triglyceride elevations, which occurred in 4.2%, and 
4.7%, respectively, of subjects in the risankizumab treated group. Increased levels of triglycerides CTC 
Grade ≥ 3 (>5.7mmol) were recorded in 89 subjects and 13 had readings >11.4 mmol/L. 86 patients had 
CTC Grade ≥ 3 blood glucose >13.9 mmol/L. There were 8 reports (0.6%) of creatine kinase increased 
and3 reports (0.2%) of a CTC AE toxicity grade 4 at 16 weeks. The overall percentage of grade 3 events 
(0.9%) and the percentage of grade 4 events (0.6%) increased over longer term exposure. There were 3 
reports of a CTC AE toxicity grade 4 chemistry abnormality (elevated ALT two cases and AST one case), 
all of which occurred within 16 weeks of starting treatment. AST and ALT elevation ≥ 5 ULN were reported 
in <1% of subjects. There were 2 subjects with ALT elevation of > 20 × ULN. Subjects also had AST 
elevation of > 20 × ULN) associated with a drug induced liver injury (SAE). This case was identified as an 
adverse event of special interest. Subject who were treated with 90 mg risankizumab had a history of 
fatty liver. The elevation resolved after 2 weeks. This was not considered to be an SAE. No cases in the 
risankizumab psoriasis safety population fell into the possible Hy’s law range. 
Of note an additional case in the Phase 2 psoriatic arthritis study met the laboratory criteria for Hy’s law 
56 days after the last dose of study drug (risankizumab 150 mg at Week 0 and Week 12).  The case was 
considered by the investigator to be related to study drug. The case was confounded by a history of fatty 
liver; baseline elevated liver enzymes and ongoing alcohol abuse. The MAH considered the AEs as having 
no reasonable possibility of being related to study drug. The events were reported resolved at the end of 
the study. 
Rates  of  potentially  clinically  relevant  clinical  chemistry  values  were  comparable  between  the  original 
safety  review  and  the  updated  safety  report.  The  most  common  CTC  grade  ≥ 3  clinical  chemistry 
abnormalities  in  the  risankizumab  group  in  the  SUR  were  elevations  in  glucose,  and  triglyceride 
elevations,  which  occurred  in  4.7%,  and  5.9%,  respectively,  of  subjects  in  the  risankizumab  treated 
group. The proportion of patients with clinically important LFT elevations remained low. One additional 
subject met the criteria for Hy’s law. A subject  with a history of cardiac disease, hypertension, obesity, 
anxiety  obesity  and  atrial  fibrillation  who  reported  abnormal  LFTs  (ALT  4  times  ULN  :  AST  3  times 
ULN:ALK phos 0.5 times ULN and total bilirubin 2 times ULN)  at day 575.  The applicant assessed the liver 
enzyme elevation as being related passive hepatic congestion secondary to worsening heart failure. 
Two additional cases of AST values 10-20 times ULN were reported both occurring in women. Both cases 
were  described  as  having  reasonable  possibility  of  being  related  to  study  drug.  The  first  case  was 
confounded  by  treatment  with  nitrofurantoin.  No  other  cause  was  identified  for  the  second  case. 
Additional information is being sought by the applicant. 
There was no evidence for any clinically meaningful changes from baseline in QT interval values in the 
pooled safety analysis sets.  No cases of Torsade de pointes/QT prolongation were reported as AEs.

Overall a rather small proportion of subjects experienced increased systolic or diastolic blood pressure 
potentially clinically important vital sign abnormalities. A total of 5.5% of subjects exhibited systolic blood 
pressures  ≥160mm  Hg  and  ≥20mm  Hg  change  from  baseline  systolic  blood  pressure  compared  with 
6.8% in the SUR. Justification of BP and BP change threshold values was provided by the Applicant and 
are discussed below.  
The AbbVie definition of a potentially clinically significant increase in systolic and diastolic BP values was 
guided by the grade 3 hypertension definition in CTCAE v4.03 (systolic BP above 160 mmHg or diastolic 
BP above 100 mmHg). There is a difference of 5 mmHg in the potentially clinically significant diastolic 
blood pressure (BP) elevation cutoff between the CTCAE and the Applicant’s definition (> 100 mmHg for 
grade  3  per  CTCAE  definition  versus  >  105  mmHg  for  Grade  3  per  the  Applicant's  definition).  Since 
roughly  the  one-third  of  psoriasis  patients  in  PSO  Phase-3  studies  had  hypertension  at  baseline,  the 
Applicant’s definition for threshold values of the potentially clinically significant systolic and diastolic BP 
might be acceptable. 
The clinically important BP change threshold values were based on the 2018 ESC/ESH guidelines for the 
management of arterial hypertension (European Heart Journal, Volume 39, Issue 33, 1 September 2018, 
Pages 3021–3104) on one hand and on the NCI CTCAE definition of grade 2 hypertension on the other 
hand.  In  the  ESC/ESH  Guideline,  the  thresholds  for  the change  in  the  categories of  hypertension  are 
based on a 20 mmHg change in SBP and a 10 mmHg change in DBP (Table 33). The NCI CTCAE definition 
of grade 2 hypertension includes symptomatic increase of diastolic blood pressure by >20 mmHg. Thus, 
the 15 mmHg threshold for DBP chosen by the Applicant falls between the CTCAE guidance of 20 mmHg 
increase in DBP and the ESH between-category difference of 10 mmHg in DBP. 
Table 57:Classification of Office Blood Pressure and Definitions of Hypertension Grade (2018 
ESC/ESH guidelines for the management of arterial hypertension) 
Further, Applicant performed an updated analysis of DBP data using a cutoff of ≥100 mmHg (i.e. grade 3 
Hypertension per CTCAE definition) and an increase of ≥10 mm Hg for the DBP cutoff based on the ESH 
hypertension categories (Table 34).

Table  58:Number  and  Percentage  of  Subjects  Meeting  Criteria  for  Potentially  Clinically 
Important Diastolic Blood Pressure 
According to this updated analysis, proportions of patients with potentially clinically important DBP and 
DPB change values increased with the decreased cutoff values for all treatment groups. Comparison of 
proportions  of  patients  concerned  for  different  treatment  groups  shows  that  the  between-treatment 
group ratios of patients with potentially clinically important DBP and DPB change values are rather similar.  
The only exception is the Risankizumab 150 mg group in the Ustekinumab-controlled population, where 
the 7.7% of proportion of patients with potentially clinically important DBP and DPB change values seems 
to be somewhat higher than expected. (For example, according to the original analysis, 0.8% and 1.5% 
of  the  Risankizumab  150  mg  patients  in  the  Primary  Safety  Pool  and  the  Ustekinumab-controlled 
population, respectively had DBP  higher than 105  mmHg with a DBP increase higher than 15 mmHg. 
According to the updated analysis, the proportions of Risankizumab 150 mg patients experiencing DBP 
higher than 100 mmHg with a DBP increase higher than 10 mmHg are 3.6% and 7.7% for Primary Safety 
Pool and the Ustekinumab-controlled population, respectively. Further, according to the original analysis, 
potentially clinically important DBP and DPB change values were experienced by 2.5% and 1.5% of the 
Ustekinumab and Risankizumab 150 mg patients, respectively in the Ustekinumab-controlled population. 
The updated analysis showed an opposite relationship with incidence of potentially clinically important 
DBP and DPB changes of 7.0% for Ustekinumab treatment group and 7.7% for Risankizumab 150 mg 
treatment group.) 
However,  these  comparisons  should  be  handled  with  caution  due  to  the  small  number  of  patients 
concerned in the original DBP analysis setting (DBP higher than 105 mmHg with a DBP increase higher 
than 15 mmHg). 
In summary, Applicant’s justification for BP and BP changes threshold values can be accepted. 
Safety in special populations 
Gender 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  reporting  rates  were  slightly  higher  in  females  (53%)  compared  with  males 
(47%) at 16 weeks. A similar picture was seen over longer term exposure to risankizumab 150mg 79% 
females  compared  with  males  73%  males  experienced  treatment  emergent  adverse  events.  The 
proportions  of  subjects  with  SAEs,  or  who  discontinued  due  to  an  AE  in  the  risankizumab  group  was 
generally similar among men and women for each over the short and longer term exposure.   All  five 
deaths following treatment with risankizumab occurred in males.

Age 
The  overall  rates  of  AE  experienced  in  subjects  ≥  65  years  of  age  and  are  comparable  to  the  overall 
population however higher rates of SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and severe AEs were higher in 
the elderly population.

Baseline static Physician's Global Assessment and body weight 
Impact of Baseline static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA; 3, 4), and body weight (≤ 100 kg, ≥ 100 
kg) on the overall safety profile of risankizumab should be summarised and presented for review. (LOQ).  
Previous use of psoriasis therapies 
Analysis by previous use of psoriasis therapies only included Prior TNF inhibitor use. There were no 
clinically meaningful differences in safety between subjects who were TNFi naïve or experienced for AEs, 
SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and severe AEs. Of note two deaths occurred in prior TNFi 
population. Prior treatment with phototherapy or prior use of nonbiologic systemics should also be 
presented.  
Immunological events 
The  effect  of  immunogenicity  (ADA  or  anti-risankizumab  antibodies)  on  risankizumab  safety  was 
assessed using treatment-emergent adverse events in relevant areas of safety interest, which include 
hypersensitivity  reaction  and  injection-site  reactions.  The  incidence  of  injection  site  reactions  for  the 
Primary Safety Pool was higher among ADA positive (2.7%) than the ADA negative (1.3%). The incidence 
of  hypersensitivity  reactions  for  the  Primary  Safety  Pool  was  comparable  among  antidrug  antibody 
positive (2.3%) and the antidrug antibody negative (3%) subjects. Across 52 weeks of exposure, the 
incidence of injection site reactions was 5% among ADA positive subjects and 3.3% for the ADA negative 
subjects. The incidence of hypersensitivity reactions was 7.6% vs. 7% in ADA-positive vs. ADA-negative 
subjects across 52 weeks of risankizumab exposure. In the original application ADAs were only evaluated 
for up to 52 weeks exposure as ADA data were not available from the OLE studies for this period of time.

Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
The potential for drug-drug interactions between risankizumab and CYP450 enzyme activity, including 
CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6, and CYP3A using their probe substrates was assessed in the Phase 
1 Study M16-007(1311.36).  Based on the results of this study, no dose adjustments are required for the 
drugs  that  are  substrates  of  these  CYP  enzymes  during  co-administration  with  risankizumab.  
Additionally, population PK analyses indicated that the clearance of risankizumab was not impacted by 
common concomitant medications (antihypertensives, antihyperlipidemics, antidiabetics, analgesics, and 
levothyroxine)  used  in  the  Phase  3  studies  by  subjects  with  plaque  psoriasis.    These  PK  results  are 
discussed in the Clinical Pharmacology section. 
Discontinuation due to AES 
Over the 16 week primary safety analysis period < than 1% of subjects (2.7 E/100PY) in the risankizumab 
150 mg treatment group discontinued study drug due to AEs. This was comparable with ustekinumab 
(1.3%) and adalimumab (2.0%). Discontinuations in the placebo group were higher (3.0%) due to the 
subjects who discontinued due to psoriasis (7 [2.3%] subjects). No TEAEs leading to discontinuation of 
study  drug  were  reported  in  more  than  1  risankizumab-treated  subject.  The  AEs  leading  to 
discontinuation  of  study  drug  that  were  also  SAEs  were  cardiac  failure  congestive,  drug-induced  liver 
injury, liver injury, invasive lobular breast carcinoma, and oesophageal carcinoma. Over 52 weeks 0.8% 
(0.8E/100PY)  of  the  risankizumab  treated  group  compared  with  2%  (2E/100PY)  of  the  ustekinumab 
treated group discontinued study drug. The AEs leading to the discontinuation of risankizumab treatment 
in  5  subjects  included  cardiac  failure  congestive,  oedema  peripheral,  drug-induced  liver  injury, 
pneumonia,  and vasculitis.  In  the  All  Risankizumab  150mg  Analysis  population  1.8%  of  risankizumab 
treated patients (2.2 E/100PY) discontinued due to an AE. The AEs leading to discontinuation of study 
drug that were also SAEs were lymphadenopathy mediastinal, cardiac failure congestive, drug-induced 
liver injury, liver injury, pneumonia, sepsis, arthralgia, muscular weakness, hemiplegia, and all the AEs 
reported in the Neoplasms benign, malignant and unspecified SOC.  The discontinuations due to chronic 
hepatitis B, hepatitis B, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) were in asymptomatic subjects who 
tested positive at the time of the annual infection screening and were discontinued per protocol. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The applicant conducted an integrated safety analysis based on 3 key safety pools which included the 
phase 2, phase and open label studies. These datasets have a rational basis and the pooled reporting is 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 152/181 
 
 
 
 
consistent with that from the separate studies. The groups provide short and longer term comparative 
data with longer term uncontrolled data up to 77 weeks. Three studies were ongoing at the data cut-off 
date  M15-997  (n=1392/2000);  Study  M16-009  (N=110)  Study;  M15-992  ongoing  N=507/500.    The 
applicant has submitted a safety update report (SUR) updating the original Clinical Summary of Safety. 
This SUR provides approximately 7 months of additional safety data from the original data cut-off in 01 
Sep 2017 up to 29 March 2018. This data originated from Study M15-997, M15-992 and Study M16-009. 
Exposure 
With over 1590 patients exposed for up to 77 weeks the ICH E1 safety exposure requirements of >1500 
patients exposed (300 to 600 for 6 months, > 100 for 1 year) were met. In the primary safety pool the 
number of patients in the comparator arms was small compared to risankizumab 150mg recipients (RZB 
150 mg (N=1306) UST (N=239)  Adalimumab (N=304) PBO (N= 300).  
In the ustekinumab controlled population there was an imbalance in the numbers of patient who were 
treated with risankizumab compared to ustekinumab (RZB 150 mg (N=598) UST (N = 199)) however this 
analysis does provide some information on the safety of risankizumab compared with ustekinumab at 52 
weeks in subjects with psoriasis. The All Risankizumab –Psoriasis (N = 2234) assesses the risankizumab 
exposure over 77 weeks. It also includes an overview of safety at higher dosages and lower dosages of 
risankizumab  (90mg  and  180mg).    Exposure  adjusted  analysis could  be  acceptable  in  addressing  the 
imbalance in numbers in the various treatment groups.  
In the original application 2,234 patients received at least 1 dose of risankizumab representing 2167 PY 
of exposure. The SUR includes data from an additional 237 subjects that  representing an additional 1185 
PY of exposure for a total of 3352 PY of exposure. In total 68% were exposed to risankizumab for for at 
least 1yr, 7% for at least two years  3.4% had ≥ 3 years of risankizumab treatment. . Due to the risk of 
side  effects  with  a  long  induction  period  (e.g.  malignancy,  MACE)  long  term  safety  data  has  been 
identified as missing data for the RMP.  
Subject Disposition 
Completions rates were high across all three analysis groups. <2% of subjects discontinued due to AEs 
across the three safety analysis populations. Male and female patients > 18 years of age with moderate 
to  severe  plaque  psoriasis,  poorly  controlled  by  topical  treatments,  systemic  treatments  (either 
non-biologic or biologic), or phototherapy were recruited to the phase 2 and 3 studies. Patients with latent 
TB, active ongoing cardiovascular, hepatic disease, treated basal cell carcinoma and patients who were 5 
years’ period remission free from other malignancies were eligible for recruitment to these studies. This 
is similar to patient population recruited to studies for similar type treatment for psoriasis. 
Demographic characteristics 
Demographic  characteristics,  baseline  morbidity  and  co-morbidity,  as  well  as  use  of  concomitant 
medications were generally well balanced across the treatment groups and between the safety analysis 
groups. Eighty percent of participants were white, 3% Black or African Americans.   Approximately one 
third  of  participants  were  female,  10  %  of  subjects  were  between  65  and  74  years  of  age.  Under 
representation of females, Black or African Americans and subjects over 65years was not shown to impact 
on the generalisability of the outcomes.

Adverse events 
In the first 16 weeks of the Phase 2 and 3 psoriasis studies (Primary Safety Pool), the incidence rates of 
overall AEs and SAEs were comparable to the rates with placebo and more favourable than those seen 
with ustekinumab and adalimumab. The rates of AEs leading to discontinuation of study drug were low 
overall and occurred at a lower rate in the risankizumab 150 mg group (2.7E/100PY) compared to placebo 
(9.8E/100PY) ustekinumab (4.0E/100PY) and adalimumab (6.3E/100PY). Exposure-adjusted TEAE rates 
for risankizumab 150mg calculated as events/100 PY tended to decrease across the three safety analysis 
populations with longer exposure(318 E/100PY at 16 weeks; 228E/100PY at 52 weeks and 246E/100PY 
up to 77 weeks). 
In the primary safety pool, representing the first 16 weeks of treatment in the phase 2 and 3 studies, 
upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  viral  upper  respiratory  tract  infections,  headache,  arthralgia,  and 
fatigue were the commonest AEs occurring in at least 2% of subjects in the risankizumab group (150 mg 
or total populations). The  reporting pattern of events at 16 weeks is similar across the risankizumab, 
placebo and ustekinumab treatment groups with a trend towards higher rates of AEs in the adalimumab 
group.  ISRs  like  injection  site  erythema,  pruritus,  pain  and  swelling  were  lower  for  the  risankizumab 
group. 
 At 52 weeks the most frequently reported AEs (≥ 2% of subjects) reported with risankizumab treatment 
were viral upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, arthralgia, headache, 
hypertension, fatigue, gastroenteritis, diarrhoea, back pain, influenza, sinusitis and folliculitis. 
 In the overall risankizumab 150mg safety analysis set at up to 77 weeks viral URTI and URTI, arthralgia 
and headache, hypertension, back pain and diarrhoea, influenza, UTI, gastroenteritis, sinusitis, fatigue, 
cough and bronchitis  were the commonest adverse events. In general, the rates for AEs through Week 16 
to  77  were  similar  with  the  highest  frequency  of  AEs  in  the  infections  SOC  across  the  three  analysis 
periods. The majority of AEs including infections was of mild to moderate severity and was self-limiting 
and didn’t result in discontinuation of study medication.  
Rates of severe AEs were comparable across the three analysis sets. (Primary safety pool 9E/100 PY; 52 
week  ustekinumab  controlled  group  7.6E/100  PY;  and  all  risankizumab  safety  pool  8.5E/100PY).  The 
SOCs with the highest number of severe events were Cardiac disorders SOC, Infections and infestations 
SOC  and  gastrointestinal  disorders  and  hepatic  disorders  SOC.    Treatment-related  adverse  events 
occurred  in  12%  of  risankizumab  group  at  week  16  which  was  higher  than  placebo  but  lower  than 
adalimumab  or  ustekinumab  treated  patients  over  the  same  period.  Approx.  20%  of  the  52  week 
ustekinumab  controlled  risankizumab  150mg  treated  group  and  the  All-risankizumab  150mg  treated 
population  reported  treatment  related  AEs.  The  treatment  related  adverse  event  profiles  are  similar 
across all three safety populations with the exception of injection site erythema which is reported at 52 
weeks and in the long term safety population. 
No information has been provided on the emergence of adverse event rates over time. A summary of 
AEs/SAEs  by  3  month  intervals/treatment  cycle  was  provided  over  the  entire  treatment  period  Over 
repeat  treatments  the  safety  profile  remains  generally  stable  with  an  overall  trend  towards  reduced 
incidence of serious adverse events and AEs in areas of special interest (ASI) over longer term treatment. 
No new safety concerns have been identified following review of the safety summary for SAEs and AEs 
over 90-180-day time intervals. 
Serious adverse events and deaths 
After 16 weeks the SAE event rate was markedly lower for the risankizumab 150 mg group at 9.9E/100PY 
compared with the placebo group at 17.4E/100PY, ustekinumab at 18.4 E/100PY and adalimumab groups 
group at 14.7E/100PY.

At 52 weeks the exposure adjusted SAE rate for risankizumab 150mg was slightly lower at 9.4E/100PY 
compared with 10.9E/100PY for ustekinumab over the same period.  The overall event rate for subjects 
exposed to risankizumab 150g up to 77 weeks with serious adverse events was also 9.9E/100PY. The 
exposure adjusted SAEs rate in the risankizumab 150mg treated groups was comparable across three 
analysis periods. The rate of serious AEs (SAEs) also did not increase between the CSS (All Risankizumab 
– Psoriasis Analysis Set) (9.8 E/100 PY) and the SUR (9.3 E/100 PY). At 16 weeks the exposure adjusted 
event rate in the primary safety pool is much lower for risankizumab 150mg compared with the 
comparator groups. The ustekinumab exposure adjusted SAE rate is almost double that at 52 weeks. This 
was attributed by the applicant to the different study populations included in the 16 week and 52 week 
analyses.   Overall these findings don’t impact on the determination of the safety profile for Risankizumab. 
This issue will not be further pursued. The most frequently reported SAEs in risankizumab treated 
subjects were infection-related events, cardiac events and neoplasms. Overall 1% of the risankizumab 
population had treatment related SAEs. The treatment-related SAE s were most frequently reported for 
the Infections and infestations SOC. These were mainly bacterial infections including pneumonia, sepsis, 
osteomyelitis and cellulitis. Despite the serious nature of these infections study medication was only 
discontinued for 1 case of pneumonia and 1 case of sepsis. The rate of discontinuation of risankizumab 
due to AEs was unchanged in the SUR.  (See discussion on adverse events of special interest) 
There were 5 deaths in risankizumab treated patients in the original safety review. All occurred in males 
between the age of 32 yrs. and 70yrs.  Four of the 5 deaths were originally adjudicated as CV deaths and 
1 death was due to malignancy. Three of the deaths (acute MI, cause undetermined 2 cases) occurred in 
subjects with multiple cardiac risk factors and were likely to have had a cardiac cause. The remaining 
death  was  attributed  to  a  drug  overdose.  All  of  the  deaths  were  considered  by  the  Applicant  to  be 
unrelated to study treatment. One death was reported 9 days following last dose of risankizumab 150mg. 
Four occurred >50 days after the last dose of study drug. The lack of a temporal association undermines 
any  possible  link  with  risankizumab  treatment.  There  were  no  adjudicated  CV  deaths  in  placebo, 
ustekinumab or adalimumab groups. All of these deaths were confounded by past CV history. In the SUR, 
5  additional  deaths  were  reported  in  subjects  receiving  Risankizumab  (Preferred  Terms  of  epileptic 
seizure, pancreatitis, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, and death), for a total of 10 deaths. Two and possibly 
a third death (adjudication pending) were cardiovascular. These are currently being adjudicated. The two 
other deaths pancreatitis and epileptic seizure are likely explained by underlying medical issues. No trend 
or pattern in type or cause of mortality could be discerned. The mortality rate in the All Risankizumab arm 
(i.e.,  any  subject  treated  with  risankizumab  regardless  of  dose)  of  the  All  Risankizumab  Psoriasis 
Population through the SUR cut-off was 0.3 events per 100 patient-years. The applicant calculated an 
SMR of 0.659 (95% CI: 0.315 to 1.211) using the raw number of deaths and the expected annual death 
rate yield. This calculation suggests that the mortality rate in the risankizumab clinical studies was not 
higher than what would be expected in the general population after adjusting for country, age, and sex. 
Adverse events of special interest 
Adverse  events  of  special  interests  evaluated  were  infections,  malignancies,  cardiovascular  events, 
hepatic events, injection site and immune reactions, Depression and Suicidal behaviors. With additional 
safety  data  from  the  SUR  (data  cutoff  29March  2018),  no  new  important  risks  have  been  identified 
compared with the initial submission.  
The rate of infection events for subjects treated with risankizumab 150mg was lower than adalimumab 
but higher when compared with placebo and ustekinumab over week 16 and 52. Comparing the exposure 
adjusted  incidences  of  infections  between  the  Primary  safety  pool  (16  weeks)  and  the  Ustekinumab 
controlled  group  (52  weeks)  for  subjects  treated  with  risankizumab  150mg  (90.8E/100PY  vs. 
73.9E/100PY)  suggests  a  reduction  in  infections  over  the  longer  exposure.  The  exposure  adjusted 
infection  rate  for  the  overall  risankizumab  150mg  treated  group  (75.5E/100PY)  was  similar  to  the 
Ustekinumab  controlled  group  After  52  weeks  of  exposure.  The  proportion  of  infections  classified  as 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 155/181 
 
 
 
serious infections was low across all three analyses (<2%). The overall rate of serious infection with the 
additional cohort of patients in the SUR reduced from 1.8/E/100PY 95% CI 1.27, 2.45 (PY=2179.0) to 
1.4E/100PY 95% (PY=3404.7). Similar to the original CSS, the most common serious infections in the 
tabulated summary of serious infections in the SUR were gastrointestinal infections, sepsis, urosepsis, 
skin infections and lower respiratory tract infections.This included a number of serious bacterial infections 
including 5 reports of cellulitis and 7 reports of sepsis and 5 of pneumonia and 2 cases of osteomyelitis. 
Disruption of the IL23/IL17 axis and its impact on the risk for the development of serious infections such 
as sepsis, cellulitis, and pneumonia was further discussed by the applicant. The applicant provided a very 
brief overview of the literature describing the impact of IL-23 blockade on host defences against acute 
bacterial and Herpes Zoster Infections. Some evidence is presented describing the role of IL-23 in early 
host resistance to klebsiella, toxoplasmosis and GI pathogens. Lack of IL-p19 subunit does not appear to 
impact  on  the  ability  to  induce  or  maintain  an  immune  response  to  a  mycobacterial  infection.  The 
pathophysiologic  mechanism  for  this  increased  risk  of  infection  in  patients  with  psoriasis  is  poorly 
understood. It is unclear what role if any IL-23 inhibition could contribute to this process.   An overview 
of these cases with dose, time of onset, risk factors outcome etc. has been provided for further review. A 
detailed review of the individual events of serious pneumonia, cellulitis, osteomyelitis, sepsis, and herpes 
zoster demonstrates one or more predisposing risk factors in the majority of cases. No clear trends were 
identified  and  in  the  majority  of  cases,  no  recurrence  of  infection  despite  continued  treatment  with 
risankizumab. The risk of infection is greatest in the first 9 months of treatment with an overall trend 
towards a decrease in serious infections over 1 year of treatment. Although the overall serious infection 
for risankizumab is similar to other similar treatments the complication of serious infections with sepsis 
could suggest that the infections are more complicated. Serious infection will be monitored as part of a 
post  marketing  safety  study.    Clinically  important  active  serious  infection  has  been  included  as  a 
contraindication.  
Section 4.8 includes additional wording regarding infections. Information on serious infections has also 
been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC.  
Section 4.4 also includes a warning that patients with a chronic infection or known risk of infection or a 
history  of  recurrent  infection  who  develop  signs  or  symptoms  of  clinically  important  chronic  or  acute 
serious infection should be advised to seek medical advice and should   be closely monitored. A further 
statement  in  section  4.4  recommends  that    treatment  with  risankizumab  should  not  be  initiated  in 
patients with any clinically important active infection until the infection resolves or is adequately treated 
and if a patients develops an infection on treatment and is not responding to standard therapy for the 
infection, the patient should be closely monitored and risankizumab should not be administered until the 
infection resolves. 
Based on the mechanism of action of risankizumab, the clinical findings in this application and previous 
experiences of similar immune-modulating biological medicinal agents, Serious Infections is included as 
an important potential risk in the RMP. This is endorsed by the CHMP/PRAC. 
There was an increase in fungal infections reported in risankizumab treated patients compared to placebo 
and  ustekinumab at 16 and 52 weeks. Overall exposure adjusted rates of fungal infection in patients 
treated with risankizumab 150mg declined slight over time ((5.2 E/100 PY) at 16 weeks compared with 
3.9  E/ 100 PY overall. Tinea fungal infections accounted for some of this increased reporting rate of fungal 
infections reported in the risankizumab groups across all analyses including cases of tinea cruris, tinea 
manum tinea pedis, body tinea, tinea versicolour, and fungal skin infection and onychomycosis. These 
infections  were  generally  mild  to  moderate  in  severity  responsive  to  treatment  and  did  not  require 
treatment discontinuation. Tinea infections (tinea pedis, tinea cruris, body tinea, tinea versicolour, tinea 
manum) are included in the proposed SmPC as ADRs. Onychomycosis (tinea unguium infections) has also 
been included as an ADR in section 4.8. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019

 There  was  also  a  significant  clustering  of  reports  of  oral,  oesophageal,  cutaneous  candidiasis  and 
vulvovaginal  candidiasis  following  treatment  with  risankizumab  over  the  longer  term.  Oral  and 
oesophageal candidiasis are captured both as fungal infections and opportunistic infections. These events 
did not result in discontinuation of study drug and were not identified as cases of serious, systemic fungal 
infections  in  the  studies  however  Candida  infections  could  be  expected  following  treatment  with 
risankizumab due to its disruption of the IL23/IL17 axis. Candida infections have been further discussed 
by the applicant. It is suggested that   selective blockade of the IL23-specific p19 subunit with respect to 
distal blockade of IL-17A or its receptor protects against the development of candida infections. This is a 
hypothesis rather than an established fact. Although Candida infections are the second commonest group 
of  fungal  infections  after  tinea  infections  reported  in  the  risankizumab  safety  database,  there  was  no 
significant increased reporting of candida infection compared to placebo in the Primary Safety Pool .It is 
agreed  that  candida  infections  can  be  omitted  from  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.    Increased  Candida 
colonization has been confirmed in subjects with psoriasis. (Pietrzak 2018). The potential risk for Candida 
infections  during  treatment  with  novel  biologic  drugs  such  as  risankizumab  is  a  potential  concern. 
Therefore, candida infections should be monitored using routine pharmacovigilance measures in future 
PSURs. 
Although Herpes Zoster infections were low overall (<1% risankizumab group treated subjects across any 
of the 3 analyses) 7 cases including 2 that were considered to be treatment related were reported in the 
original  clinical  safety  summary.  Cases  of  Herpes  zoster  associated  with  risankizumab  were  further 
discussed by the applicant. The number of reports of herpes zoster increased from 7 to 14 with inclusion 
of patients from the safety update.  However, when adjusted for exposure the rate of infection increased 
from 0.3E/100PY to 0.4E/100PY. This suggests a slight trend towards increased rates of herpes zoster 
with additional exposure. This will be further monitored by the applicant in the post authorisation setting. 
Across the Phase 3 psoriasis clinical studies, 72 subjects with latent tuberculosis (TB) were concurrently 
treated with risankizumab and appropriate TB prophylaxis during the studies. From the 31 subjects in 
Study M15-992 who had latent TB on screening and did not receive prophylaxis during the study, none 
developed active TB during the follow-up. Six cases of latent TB (0.4%: 0.4/100PY) were reported over 77 
weeks  exposure  to  risankizumab  150mg.Overall  8  subjects  in  the  All  Risankizumab  group  (all  doses) 
reported latent TB but had no clinical symptoms. There continued to be no cases of active tuberculosis 
(TB)  among  risankizumab-treated  subjects  in  this  SUR,  including  no  reactivation  of  TB  in  subjects 
diagnosed with latent TB.  
The SmPC states that risankizumab must not be given to patients with active TB and   recommends that 
patients with latent TB should be considered for anti-TB therapy prior to initiating risankizumab. This 
warning has been revised to include the warning that patients TB status should be evaluated prior to 
starting  treatment  and  should  be  monitored  for  signs  and  symptoms  of  active  TB  during  and  after 
treatment.   
The rates of injection site reactions were higher than placebo (1.5% vs. 1.0%, respectively), but lower 
than with ustekinumab (3.8%) or adalimumab (5.6%).  In the All Risankizumab Psoriasis Analysis Set the 
ISR reporting rate remained low at 3.1% compared with 3.4% in the SUR. Injection site erythema was the 
commonest adverse event. Injection site reactions (injection site bruising, erythema, haematoma, 
haemorrhage, irritation, pain, pruritus, reaction, and swelling) are included as common side effects in 
section 4.8 of the SmPC. In the Primary Safety Pool and the All Risankizumab Psoriasis Analysis Set, the 
incidence of injection site reactions was numerically higher among antidrug antibody positive than the 
antidrug antibody negative subjects. The incidence of injection site reactions is numerically higher in the 
ADA-positive than the ADA-negative groups in both the Primary Safety Pool (2.7% vs. 1.3%) and the All 
Risankizumab Psoriasis Population (5.0% vs 3.3%). Although anti-drug antibodies with a significant (≥ 
128) titer were rarely (~1% of treated patients) occurring, most of these patients were NAb positive, and 
the occurrence of these higher titer antibodies apparently did have a negative impact on clinical response. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 157/181 
 
 
 
Increase rates of ISRs were seen at 16 weeks and over longer term treatment in ADA positive subjects. 
This has been reflected in section 4.8.   
In the primary safety analysis hepatic events were  more frequently reported for placebo than for the 
risankizumab  150mg  treatment  groups.  Although  there  was  no  overall  signal  of  more  potential  for 
hepatotoxicity in risankizumab patients compared to placebo or comparator treatment over the short to 
medium  term,  the  incidence  of  3  cases  of  possible  drug  induced  liver  injury  following  treatment  with 
risankizumab: 2 cases following treatment with 150mg risankizumab for psoriasis and 1 case following 
treatment with risankizumab 150mg for psoriatic arthritis. Both cases in the psoriasis studies occurred 
within 30 days of treatment with risankizumab. Both were confounded by underlying medical conditions 
and concomitant medications however both cases case of liver injury were considered to be related to 
study drug by the investigator. One case in the Phase 2 psoriatic arthritis study met the laboratory criteria 
for  Hy’s  law  56  days  after  the  last  dose  of  study  drug.  This  case  was  also  confounded  by  underlying 
medical conditions and concomitant medications. The events were reported resolved at the end of the 
study. This case was considered to be related to study drug by the investigator. This was the only one of 
the  3  cases  associated  with  a  high  rate  of  combined  elevations  in  hepatic  transaminases  and  serum 
bilirubin. The MAH argues that given the presence of multiple confounders, the case does not meet the 
criteria for a Hy's Law case. The fact that the events occurred almost 2 months after receipt of study drug 
does  suggest  that  treatment  with  risankizumab  may  have  been  unlikely  to  have  played  a  role  in  the 
aetiology of this event. Severe cases of raised LFTs (4 cases of raised AST, 3 cases of raised ALT and 1 
case raised LFT) were also reported, only one of which resulted in discontinuation of study medication. 
Patients  with  hepatic  impairment  were  not  excluded  from  the  studies.  PK  of  risankizumab  was  not 
evaluated in patients with hepatic impairment. An overview of safety in patients with hepatic impairment 
has  been  provided  by  the  applicant  including  a  review  of  hepatic  events  from  the  7  month  safety 
extension period covered by the SUR. Overall (up to 77 weeks exposure) AEs were reported in 62 subjects 
(3.9%)  (5.9/100PY)  treated  with  risankizumab  150mg  compared  with  112  of  subjects  (4.5%) 
(5.4E/100PY)  in  the  SUR.  In  the  SUR  an  additional  two  subjects  are  reported  as  having  had  serious 
hepatic  AEs.  However  only  one  report  is  detailed.  This  patient  (54year  old  white  female)  reported 
autoimmune hepatitis approximately 1yr after starting risankizumab. Details of the second case should 
be  provided  for  review.  Two  additional  cases  of  AST  values  10-20  times  ULN  were  reported.  One 
additional subject met the criteria for Hy’s law. This was attributed to liver congestion secondary to CHF. 
This patient subsequently died from CHF.  
Although  there  was  no  overall  signal  of  more  potential  for  hepatotoxicity  in  risankizumab  patients 
compared  to  placebo  or  comparator  treatment  over  the  short  and  longer  term  treatment  term,  the 
incidence of 3 significant hepatobiliary SAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug is a concern. There 
was no preclinical signal for hepatotoxicity and neither has it been identified as risk with other similar type 
agents. There is no clear mechanistic basis for hepatoxicity associated with risankizumab. Currently no 
warnings  in  SmPC  regarding  hepatotoxic  potential  or  need  for  monitoring  of  hepatic  enzymes  are 
required.  The  CHMP  agrees  that  there  is  insufficient  evidence  to  include  hepatoxicity  including  drug 
induced hepatotoxicity as a potential risk in the RMP. 
MACE events  were more commonly reported in the  placebo group compared with risankizumab at 16 
weeks. No MACE events were reported for adalimumab and ustekinumab in the initial 16-week analysis. 
The overall MACE event rate (0.5 E/100PY) was low and was shown by the applicant to be in the range of 
MACE rates reported for ustekinumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, brodalumab, and guselkumab at the 
time of their initial submissions. The treatment-emergent MACE event rate remained low at 0.4E/100PY 
in the SUR. Although the overall MACE event rate is low, after adjusting for exposure, there was a trend 
towards increased numbers of MACE, and other CV events with exposure to risankizumab over the longer 
term. Significant cardiovascular events were also more common following treatment with risankizumab 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 158/181 
 
 
 
compared to ustekinumab over 52 weeks. However, rates of MACE and other CV never exceeded event 
rates reported for placebo at 16 weeks.  
MACE is included as an identified potential risk in the RMP. A review of exposure-adjusted event rates of 
long-term data for MACE including a cluster of 5 adjudicated CV deaths) , Extended MACE and Other CV 
AE categories did not show increase over time in either CV event category. Event rates are comparable 
with short term event rates in RZB clinical studies as well as with CV event rates observed for psoriasis 
patients not undergoing biological PSO therapy. . In the Primary Safety Pool, 3.7% of RZB patients 
exhibited systolic blood pressure values ≥ 160 mmHg and ≥ 20 mmHg increase from Baseline until Week 
16. Slightly higher frequencies (Risankizumab 150 mg subgroup: 6.2%, All RZB patients: 5.5%) were 
observed in All Risankizumab PSO Analysis Set.  
Threshold for clinically relevant elevated blood pressure was based by Applicant on CTCAE Grade 3 
hypertension definition: systolic BP >= 160mmHg or diastolic BP >=100mmHg, but for the latter 
105mmHg was used as potentially clinically significant value. 
Threshold for potentially clinically significant increase of > 20mmHg for systolic and >15 mmHg for 
diastolic blood pressure was clarified and finally accepted. 
Risankizumab did not appear to have any clinically significant effects on the other cardiovascular 
functions (heart rate, or QT-interval).  
When comparing risankizumab to ustekinumab at 52 weeks, the exposure adjusted incidence rates of 
malignancies appear similar, with 0.5 events per 100 PY for each treatment arm. The overall exposure 
adjusted event rate in patients treated with risankizumab 150mg was higher at 1.5E/100PY. The overall 
event rate for NMSC through Week 76 was 0.9E/100 PY in the risankizumab 150mg treated group. 
Corresponding event rates for malignancies other than NMSC through Week 76 were 0.6E/100 PY. The 
overall event rate (1.5E/100PY) was slightly higher than the range (0.81 – 1.3 events per 100 PYs) 
reported for other non-TNF biologics in psoriasis population at the time of their initial submission as 
presented by the applicant. The malignancy event rate (1.4E/100PY) remained stable over the extended 
safety period covered in the analysis. There was no preclinical signal relating to malignancy for 
risankizumab. There is a well-established association between psoriasis and non-melanoma skin cancers, 
in particular squamous cell carcinoma associated with psoralen-PUVA-therapy.  The safety data is limited 
considering the length of tumour induction, thus no conclusions concerning the possible cause of the 
slightly higher event rate of malignancies can be made.  Malignancies are included as an important 
potential risk in the RMP. An additional pharmacovigilance study is proposed to evaluate safety risks, 
including malignancies. This is endorsed. 
No association between hypersensitivity and treatment-emergent anti-drug antibodies was established. 
However, a warning regarding discontinuation of treatment if a serious hypersensitivity reaction occurs 
should  be  included  in  section  4.4.  The  applicant  has  adequately  justified  the  omission  of  the  ADR 
Hypersensitivity reaction (dermatitis contact, eczema, dermatitis, urticaria, and rash) from   section 4.8. 
Serious  hypersensitivity  reactions  is  included  as  an  identified  potential  risk  in the  RMP  as  monoclonal 
antibody products carry a theoretical risk of immune reactions against the small nonhuman part of the 
antibody. This is endorsed. 
The overall rates of depression and depression related events in risankizumab treated patients were low 
(1.2  E/100  PY).    Two  subjects  had  a  depression  related  SAE.    None  of  the  depression  events  led  to 
discontinuation of study drug. There were no completed suicides in the risankizumab treated population.  
One subject had a self-injurious ideation AE that was not serious and 1 subject had a suicide attempt that 
was serious. Both events of SIB were in subjects with multiple confounding factors. The applicant has 
indicated  that  the  SIB  event  rate  (0.1  E/100  PY)  is  comparable  to  other  recent  clinical  development 
programs  (guselkumab  0.10/100  subject-yrs.,  secukinumab,  0.06/100  subject-yrs.;  ixekizumab, 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 159/181 
 
 
 
0.14/100  subject  yrs.).  There  is  no  current  evidence  of  causality  of  any  of  the  SIB  events  with 
risankizumab. The CHMP agrees that there is insufficient evidence to include SIB as a potential risk in the 
RMP.  
Retreatment Analysis Set 
No new safety concerns were identified in patients withdrawn from treatment following improvement in 
their disease who then relapsed, and were retreated with risankizumab or in subjects who were switched 
from Adalimumab to Risankizumab.  
On the basis of the information provided by the applicant the safety profile for the population who did not 
receive a loading dose is more favourable than the population who did receive a loading dose. Of the 899 
subjects randomized to risankizumab 150 mg with loading Dose, 669 (74.4%) subjects had at least 1 AE. 
Three subjects died.  Sixty-six (7.3%) subjects had an SAE and 19 (2.1%) subjects discontinued study 
drug due to an AE. whereas of the 191 subjects who didn’t receive a loading dose, 132 (69.1%) subjects 
had  at  least  1  AE.    No  subjects  died.    Seven  (3.7%)  subjects  had  an  SAE,  and  2  (1.0%)  subjects 
discontinued due to an AE. As outlined in the efficacy review, there is an increased benefit with the loading 
dose. As the differences in safety reporting is most likely due to methodological differences in how the 
data was collected rather than any real difference in safety profile between these two cohorts.  These 
differential safety findings are not considered to impact on the R/B profile. Adverse Drug reactions 
Estimates  of  the  adverse  drug  reactions  were  based  on  safety  data  from  the  primary  safety  pool, 
complementing it with findings of significant adverse reactions observed throughout the studies. Events 
with longer latency and rare events were also evaluated this approach is acceptable. The AEs, considered 
by the applicant to be adverse drug reactions (ADRs):  upper respiratory infections, headache, fatigue, 
injection site reactions, tinea infections, and folliculitis are acceptable.  
Cough and pruritus occurred at a rate of ≥ 1% of subjects in the risankizumab group with a higher rate 
than the placebo group during the 16-week controlled period of pooled studies.  Pruritus is included in the 
footnote ‘e’ for injection site reactions in section 4.8. However, the reports of pruritus were not specifically 
related to injection site reactions. Pruritus should be moved to the main body of the table. Cough was 
excluded  from  section  4.8  on  the  basis  that  it  was  an  uncommon  nonspecific  event  with  no  clear 
mechanistic basis. This is accepted by CHMP.  
Laboratory findings 
For haematology, mean changes from Baseline with risankizumab treatment groups were small and were 
not considered to be clinically meaningful. Rates were comparable to adalimumab and ustekinumab with 
no significant differences to placebo at 16 weeks. Following longer term exposure CTC toxicity grade 3 
was noted for decreased Hb 1 case, platelets 1 case , leucocytes 4 cases, lymphocytes 6 cases)  Grade 4 
CTC toxicity values were  observed for neutrophils decreased and lymphocytes decreased in 1 subject 
each.  Although  neutropenia  is  a  potential  risk,  due  the  impact  of  blockade  of  IL23  /  IL17  on  innate 
immunity  and  neutrophil  biology  the  number  of  reports  of  neutropenia  is  low  (0.3%).    There  is  no 
evidence of a clinically relevant impact on haematology values. 
The mean changes from baseline with risankizumab treatment groups for clinical chemistry values, were 
small  and  were  not  generally  considered  to  be  clinically  meaningful.  Rates  were  comparable  to 
adalimumab and ustekinumab with no significant differences to placebo at 16 weeks.  
The  most  common  CTC  grade  ≥ 3  clinical  chemistry  abnormalities  over  long  term  exposure  in  the 
risankizumab group were elevations in glucose, and triglyceride elevations, which occurred in 4.2%, and 
4.7%, respectively, of subjects in the risankizumab treated group. Increased levels of triglycerides CTC

Grade ≥ 3 (>5.7mmol) were recorded in 89 subjects and 13 had readings >11.4 mmol/L. A similar picture 
was seen in the SUR. 
66 patients treated with risankizumab 150mg had CTC Grade ≥ 3 blood glucose >13.9 mmol/L. No long 
term  controlled  data  (i.e. ustekinumab)  is  presented  for  clinical  chemistry  values.  Of  note  3  cases  of 
severe diabetes mellitus were reported over the same long-term exposure period. The high percentage of 
patients treated with risankizumab 150mg who had CTC Grade ≥ 3 blood glucose >13.9 mmol/L is for the 
main part explained by the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in the overall psoriasis patient population. 
However, it noted that only 54 of the 66 patient with grade 3 blood glucose had a diagnosis of diabetes 
mellitus. It is unclear where the other 12 cases were reported. This should be clarified by the applicant. It 
is noteworthy however that over 52 weeks there was a small increase from baseline in blood glucose in 
the  risankizumab  150  mg  arm  and  in  the  ustekinumab  arms  (0.2  mmol/L  mean  vs.  0.3  mmol/L 
respectively). The clinical significance of this finding is unclear. The applicant has committed to continuing 
to monitor blood glucose in all ongoing and planned studies, to evaluate the impact of risankizumab on 
blood glucose levels. 
There were 8 reports (0.6%) of creatine kinase increased including 3 reports (0.2%) of a CTC AE toxicity 
grade 4 at 16 weeks. The overall percentage (0.9%) including the percentage of grade 4 events (0.6%) 
increased over longer term exposure. The applicants’ analysis of the Grade 3 and Grade 4 increases in 
creatine  kinase  for  risankizumab  150  mg  over  shorter  and  longer  term  treatment  indicates  that  an 
association  between  creatine  kinase  increases  and  risankizumab  treatment  is  unlikely.  There  were  3 
reports of a CTC AE toxicity grade 4 chemistry abnormality (elevated AST n= 2 and ALT n=1). All of which 
occurred within 16 weeks of starting treatment. (See discussion on Liver Function test values below) At 16 
weeks  the  proportions  of  subjects  with  potentially  clinically  important  changes  in  ALT,  AST,  ALP,  and 
bilirubin values in the risankizumab 150mg group were recorded in <2% of patients and were broadly 
comparable among treatment groups.  
Overall (up to week 77) the proportions of subjects with potentially clinically important changes in ALT, 
AST, ALP, and bilirubin values in the risankizumab 150mg group were recorded in <3% of patients. AST 
and ALT elevation ≥ 5 ULN were reported in <1% of subjects. There were 2 subjects with ALT elevation of 
> 20 × ULN.. Subjects  also had AST elevation of > 20 × ULN) associated with a drug induced liver injury 
(SAE) this case is further discussed as an adverse event of special interest. A subject who was treated 
with 90 mg risankizumab had a history of fatty liver. The elevation resolved after 2 weeks. This was not 
considered to be an SAE. 
Special populations 
Treatment-emergent  AEs  were  slightly  higher  in  females  compared  with  males.  The  proportions  of 
subjects with SAEs, or who discontinued due to an AE in the risankizumab group was generally similar 
among men and women over short and longer term treatment apart from reports of deaths.  Five deaths 
occurred  in  male  however,  this  may  be  accounted  for  by  males  being  the  majority  (70%  in  All 
Risankizumab – Psoriasis) of the subject population.   
The  overall  rates  of  AE  experienced  in  subjects  ≥  65  years  of  age  and  are  comparable  to  the  overall 
population however higher rates of SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and severe AEs may relate as 
suggested by the applicant to increasing comorbidities in the elderly population.  However, rates of SAEs, 
AEs leading to discontinuation, and severe AEs were further discussed by the applicant. The applicant’s 
response has not provided complete reassurance regarding the safety of risankizumab in this population 
as the dataset is so limited particularly in patients over 75. A statement to the effect that safety data in 
older patients is limited has  been included in section 4.8 of the SmPC. .  
Impact of  Baseline static Physician's Global Assessment (sPGA; 3, 4), and body weight (≤ 100 kg, ≥ 100 
kg) had no discernible impact on the overall safety profile of risankizumab .

Despite  the  requirement  that  women  of  childbearing  potential  were  required  to  use  highly  effective 
methods of birth control in the studies 17 women became pregnant. The current wording in section 4.6 is 
in line with the recommendations of the Guideline on Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products on Human 
Reproduction and Lactation. The SmPC advises that it is preferable to avoid the use of risankizumab in 
pregnancy.  However Psoriasis is common in women of childbearing age, with many women requiring 
ongoing therapy to maintain remission and improve quality of life. Therefore, pregnancy and the use of 
biologics in lactation may be frequently encountered in clinical practice. Pregnancy is included as missing 
information in the RMP and a dedicated cohort study of pregnancy exposures and outcomes in women 
with psoriasis, including mother-infant linkage, is planned.  
The SmPC statement on breastfeeding has also been revised to reflect the fact that although currently it 
is unknown whether risankizumab is excreted in human milk it is known that some Human IgGs are 
excreted in breast milk during the first few days after birth therefore a risk to the breast-fed infant cannot 
be excluded . Any decision to discontinue/abstain from risankizumab therapy should take into 
consideration the benefit of breast-feeding to the child and the benefit of risankizumab therapy to the 
woman. 
Immunogenicity 
The incidence of treatment emergent ADAs (19%) at 16 weeks increased up to 24% after 52 weeks. A 
total  of  9%  and  14  %  of  patients  treated  with  risankizumab  at  the  recommended  dosing  regimen 
developed neutralizing antibodies to risankizumab at 16 and 52 Weeks respectively. The overall incidence 
of ADA and NAB appears to further increase following stopping then retreating with risankizumab. Despite 
the  high  levels  of  ADA,  no  subject  exposed  to  risankizumab  in  the  psoriasis  studies  experienced 
anaphylactic  reactions  or  serum  sickness-like  reactions  however  2  subjects  in  the  psoriatic  arthritis 
studies did experience anaphylactic reactions.  
The incidence of injection site reactions was higher among ADA positive (2.7% and 5%) than the ADA 
negative (1.3% and 3.3%) at 16 and 52 weeks respectively. The Applicant provided additional data from 
Study  M15-992  up  to  104  weeks.    The  overall  incidence  of  treatment  emergent  ADAs  and  NABs  are 
relatively high at 52 weeks (26% and 16%)   following treatment with risankizumab but remain relatively 
stable  (27%  and  17%)  over  longer  term  follow-up  up  to  104  weeks.  The  incidence  of  injection  site 
reactions are numerically higher in the ADA-positive than the ADA-negative groups at 16 and 52 weeks. 
The wording of section 4.8 has  been revised accordingly. Persistent relatively high levels of antibodies 
were attributed to the sensitivity of the assay. Rates of ISRs and hypersensitivity reactions were low. 
Addition of immunogenicity as an important potential risk in the RMP is not currently warranted. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Data from 2234 patients of whom 1590 were initially treated with risankizumab 150mg s up to 77 weeks 
have  been  used  to  characterise  the  safety  profile  of  risankizumab.  This  has  been  supplemented  by  a 
safety update report including data from an additional 237 subjects representing an additional 1185.0 PY 
of exposure for a total of 3351.6 PY of exposure. The overall adverse event rates of risankizumab in the 
pooled data tended to be more favourable to the active comparators adalimumab and ustekinumab. In 
the 16-week period after initial treatment, the exposure adjusted event rate for overall adverse events 
was higher than placebo but lower than ustekinumab and adalimumab.  
SAEs and severe adverse  events and AEs leading to discontinuation of study  drug were reported less 
frequently  for  risankizumab  compared  to  placebo,  adalimumab  and  ustekinumab  treatment  groups 
suggesting that in the initial treatment period risankizumab has a more favourable safety profile however 
this was not consistent across all SOCs e.g. infections were more frequently reported following treatment 
with risankizumab compared with ustekinumab. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 162/181 
 
 
 
 Over the longer term (52 weeks) the safety profiles of risankizumab treated patients reported slightly 
less  AEs  and  SAEs  but  had  more  severe  AEs  than  ustekinumab.  Exposure-adjusted  TEAE  rates  for 
risankizumab 150mg calculated as events/100 PY were similar across the three safety analyses groups 
suggesting that there was no increase in the event rate for AEs with longer exposure to risankizumab. 
Overall  risankizumab  150mg  was  well  tolerated  with  discontinuation  due  to  adverse  events  <2%. 
Common adverse events were predominately mild (>97%). Viral URTI and URTI, arthralgia and headache 
were  the  commonest  adverse  events.  Local  tolerability  was  better  compared  to  adalimumab  and 
ustekinumab. 
 Although  serious  infections  were  reported  in  <1%  of  risankizumab  treated patients  at  16  weeks  and 
exposure adjusted rates of serious infections were comparable between risankizumab analyses at 16, 52 
and 77 weeks, and over the additional 7month safety review. Increased mucocutaneous fungal infections 
(tinea and candidiasis) were noted following treatment with risankizumab particularly over longer term 
treatment. This is stated in he SmPC.  
Three  cases  of  drug  induced  liver  injury  were  experienced  in  the  patients  treated  with  risankizumab. 
Although all of these cases were confounded, all three cases resulted in study drug discontinuation and 
were  considered  to  be  related  to  study  drug  by  the  investigator.  There  is  insufficient  data  to  include 
hepatotoxicity  as  a  potential  risk  in  the  RMP.  Cases  of  hepatoxicity  will  be  monitored  using  routine 
pharmacovigilance. 
The overall malignancy rate in subjects exposed to risankizumab 150mg was slightly higher than those 
reported in the clinical development program for similar type agents. The effect of risankizumab on blood 
glucose homeostasis will be further characterised in the post authorisation setting.  
Immunogenicity over 104 weeks has been characterised.

The CHMP and PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.5 is acceptable.  
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
The CHMP considered that the pharmacovigilance system summary submitted by the applicant fulfils the 
requirements of Article 8(3) of Directive 2001/83/EC. 
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the Annex II, Section C of the CHMP Opinion. The applicant did not request alignment of the PSUR cycle 
with the international birth date (IBD).The new EURD list entry will therefore use the EBD to determine 
the forthcoming Data Lock Points. 
2.9.  New Active Substance 
The applicant declared that risankizumab has not been previously authorised in a medicinal product in the 
European Union. 
The CHMP, based on the available data, considers risankizumab to be a new active substance as it is not 
a constituent of a medicinal product previously authorised within the Union. 
2.10.  Product information 
2.10.1.  User consultation 
The results of the user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet submitted by the 
applicant show that the package leaflet meets the criteria for readability as set out in the Guideline on the 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 167/181 
 
 
 
 
 
 
readability of the label and package leaflet of medicinal products for human use. 
2.10.2.  Quick Response (QR) code 
A request to include a QR code in the labelling (outer carton) and package leaflet for the purpose of 
providing statutory and additional information (see below) on the medicinal product has been submitted 
by the applicant and has been found acceptable. 
The following elements have been agreed to be provided through a QR code: link to a website (URL: 
www.skyrizi.eu) including the package leaflet (statutory information) in an interactive, more easily 
navigable format, and a video on how to safely inject Skyrizi (additional information). This video is based 
on section 7 of the package leaflet and aims to be an additional tool to support the patient. 
The company was requested to confirm that during the life cycle of the product, the QR code would be 
amended as appropriate. The company confirmed and clarified that due to lead times of producing 
physical packs, elabelling websites such as the QR website will always be updated faster than the printed 
version of the Package Leaflet in the pack.  On the Skyrizi QR website, a statement on the bottom of each 
page ‘This page was last revised : [MM/YYYY]’ will inform about the last update.  
2.10.3.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(1) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Skyrizi (risankizumab) is included in the 
additional monitoring list as 
• 
• 
It contains a new active substance which, on 1 January 2011, was not contained in any medicinal 
product authorised in the EU; 
It is a biological product that is not covered by the previous category and authorised after 1 
January 2011; 
Therefore the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet includes a statement that this 
medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this will allow quick identification of new 
safety information. The statement is preceded by an inverted equilateral black triangle. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Psoriasis is a chronic debilitating immunologic disease characterized by marked inflammation and 
thickening of the epidermis that result in thick, scaly plaques involving the skin. In most developed 
countries, prevalence is between 1.5 and 5%. 
Plaque psoriasis is the most common form, affecting approximately 80% to 90% of patients. In patients 
with plaque psoriasis, approximately 80% have mild to moderate disease, with 20% having moderate to 
severe disease. 
The proposed indication is for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are 
candidates for systemic therapy. 
The goal of treatment is to control signs and symptoms of plaque psoriasis and improve quality of life for 
patients with this condition. 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 168/181 
 
 
 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Topical corticosteroids are commonly used for mild to moderate cases. Other topical medications include 
keratolytic agents, anthralin, coal tar, vitamin D analogs, and retinoids. For more widespread disease, 
phototherapy (ultraviolet B [UVB] or psoralen with ultraviolet A [PUVA]) is commonly used. Systemic 
therapy, including methotrexate (MTX), cyclosporine, synthetic retinoids, and fumaric acid are often 
effective in patients with moderate or severe disease. Due to the potential adverse side effects of 
systemic agents, these medications are generally administered in rotation to avoid long-term or 
cumulative toxicities. 
Biological therapies have emerged as an alternative treatment option for patients with moderate to 
severe psoriasis in need of systemic therapy as detailed below. 
Expression of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-induced proteins in psoriatic plaques provided the rationale 
for the development of TNF-neutralizing therapies for psoriasis,20 and the anti-TNF agents etanercept, 
adalimumab, and infliximab are approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. 
Ustekinumab, a p40 IL 12/23 inhibitor, is approved for the treatment of moderate to severe psoriasis. 
Recently more targeted biological therapies such as Guselkumab, an IL-23 inhibitor (p19 subunit of 
IL-23) and anti-IL-17 monoclonal antibodies such as brodalumab, ixekizumab, and secukinumab have 
been approved. 
These more targeted therapies such as IL-17 and IL-12/23 inhibitors have added incremental clinical 
benefit. While there is not a large unmet need, newer more efficacious treatments compared to earlier 
approved biological therapies are welcome to improve clinical response and quality of life of plaque 
psoriasis patients. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The risankizumab psoriasis clinical development program designed to support the proposed indication 
included 4 pivotal Phase 3 studies of the dose and dosing regimen (risankizumab 150 mg subcutaneous 
[SC] injection at Weeks 0, 4, and every 12 weeks [q12w] thereafter) in adults who had stable moderate 
to severe chronic plaque psoriasis ≥ 6 months (with or without psoriatic arthritis), defined as body surface 
area (BSA) involvement ≥ 10%; Psoriasis Area and Severity Index (PASI) score ≥ 12; Static Physician 
Global Assessment (sPGA) ≥ 3. 
Studies M15-995 (1311.28) (UltIMMa-2), M16-008 (1311.3) (UltIMMa-1): Multicentre, randomized, 
double-blind, placebo- and active-controlled studies that compared the efficacy and safety of 
risankizumab treatment with placebo and ustekinumab treatment. 
Study M15-992 (1311.4) (IMMhance): A multicentre, randomized, double blind study that compared the 
efficacy and safety of risankizumab treatment with placebo, evaluated the effects of continuous 
risankizumab compared with withdrawal in risankizumab responders, and evaluated re-treatment of 
subjects who experienced relapse. This study is still ongoing (interim results provided). 
Study M16-010 (1311.30) (IMMvent): A multicentre, randomized, double blind study that compared the 
efficacy and safety of risankizumab with adalimumab and evaluated switching from adalimumab to 
risankizumab for adalimumab non-responders and those with inadequate response to adalimumab. 
(Study M15-997) Long-term efficacy and safety of risankizumab.  This study is ongoing; the data cut-off 
date was 01 September 2017. 
The pivotal studies were supported by a Phase 2 study dose finding study (Study 1311.2) and its OLE 
(Study M16-009 [1311.13]), and a Phase 1 study (Study 1311.1).

The endpoints chosen by the company are agreed and are of clinical relevance, furthermore they are in 
line with relevant guidelines and previous therapies which have been authorised. 
The co primary endpoints PASI 90 responses and IGA0-1 were agreed as the primary endpoints as were 
the secondary endpoints which examined for longer term efficacy, relative efficacy and symptomatic 
endpoints QoL measurements. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
A total of 2109 subjects were randomized in the Phase 3 studies of those subjects, 1306 were randomized 
to risankizumab. An additional 375 subjects switched to risankizumab in later parts of the pivotal studies, 
and 348 subjects switched to risankizumab in the open-label extension Study M15-997. 
Demographic characteristics and disease severity were balanced across treatment groups and studies 
and were consistent with those seen in other recent trials of biologics in plaque psoriasis. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints in the first period of Phase 3 pivotal studies (Part A, Baseline to Week 
16), PASI 90 and sPGA of clear or almost clear at Week 16, were in agreement with CHMP scientific advice 
and regulatory advice received prior to starting the Phase 3 program. 
Risankizumab was superior to placebo as demonstrated by statistically significant differences between 
groups in the proportions of subjects who achieved PASI 90 (73.2 % -75.3% vs 2.0-4.9% risankizumab 
versus placebo respectively) and sPGA of clear or almost clear (83.5% to 87.8% vs 5.1 to 7.8% 
risankizumab versus placebo respectively- both p < 0.001 studies M15-995, M16-008, M15-992).  
Risankizumab was superior to Adalimumab for both co primary endpoints at week 16 PASI 90 (72.4% vs 
47.4 % Risankizumab vs Adalimumab resp) and s PGA (83.7% vs 60.2% Risankizumab vs Adalimumab 
resp. both p < 0.001 study M16-010). 
Consistent effects were demonstrated for the co primary endpoints across the four studies. 
Key secondary endpoints examined for the co primary endpoints at week 52 this showed consistent 
effects with week 16 results and achieved slightly higher efficacy:  s PGA (83.3% – 86.2%) and PASI 90 
(91.5%-91.8%) at week 52.  
Higher efficacy such as PASI 100 and s PGA of clear at weeks 16 and at week 52 (studies M15-995, 
M16-008) were also demonstrated, as superiority was achieved with risankizumab compared to either 
placebo or Ustekinumab at both week 16 and 52 for sPGA clear (average diff vs Ustekinumab + 45.6% at 
week 16, + 32.9% at week 52) PASI 100 (average diff Ustekinumab + 25.2 % week 16, + 32.25% at 
week 52). 
Treatment effects in all subgroups were in favour of risankizumab with 95% confidence intervals of the 
treatment difference excluding zero in all subgroups (includes age, sex, race, body weight, baseline PASI 
score, concurrent psoriatic arthritis, previous receipt of a non-biologic systemic therapy, previous biologic 
treatment, and failure of previous biologic treatment) for PASI 90 and sPGA of clear or almost clear at 
Week 16 In addition, consistent response rates were shown in PASI 90 and sPGA of clear or almost clear 
regardless of anti-drug antibody status and NAb status. 
Risankizumab was also superior to placebo for improving the extent and severity of nail, palmoplantar, 
and scalp psoriasis, as demonstrated by statistically significant differences as the secondary endpoint  (P 
< 0.001 for each comparison) between treatment groups in favour of risankizumab in mean changes from 
Baseline in NAPSI (-10.6 ls mean vs placebo at week 16), PPASI (-4.35 ls mean vs placebo at week 16), 
and PSSI (-14.4 ls mean vs placebo at week 16) in the Placebo- Controlled Population. Additionally, 
superiority to ustekinumab for improving the extent and severity of nail and scalp psoriasis compared 
with ustekinumab (both p< 0.0010) however but not for palmoplantar psoriasis.

Switching to risankizumab for subjects who had inadequate initial response to adalimumab (PASI 50 to < 
PASI 90 at Week 16) also produced statistically significant improvement for PASI 90 at Week 44 (adjusted 
difference 45% p < 0.001). 
Across the pivotal studies significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes of DLQI (DLQI 0/1) and 
PSSD (clinically meaningful change in both symptom and sign scores) were observed. 
Two-thirds of subjects in the risankizumab group achieved DLQI of 0 or 1 (psoriasis had no impact on 
subject's quality of life) at Week 16 compared with 5% of subjects who received placebo. At Week 52, 
over 70% of subjects who were randomized to receive risankizumab 150 mg at Baseline reported no 
impact on their quality of life from psoriasis, and approximately 56% of subjects who received 
risankizumab in Studies M16-008 and M15-995 reported no itch, pain, burning, or redness. 
Risankizumab also showed meaningful impact on patient-reported psoriasis symptoms (itch, pain, 
redness and burning), as measured by the Psoriasis Symptom Score (PSS), and quality of life. Almost 
one-third of subjects in the risankizumab group achieved a PSS score of 0 at Week 16 compared with 1% 
of subjects in the placebo group. 
Overall incidence of antidrug antibodies was 19% across the clinical programme with 8% incidence of 
neutralising antibodies at 16 weeks. This was increased at week 52 to ADA 24% and Nab incidence 14%.  
Presence of anti-drug antibodies or NAb to risankizumab also did not impact treatment effect at either 
Week 16 or Week 52. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The majority of subjects who were randomized to risankizumab were male (69.5%) and white (78.1%) 
subjects had a median baseline PASI score of 17.80 and a median BSA of 20.0% and were mostly middle 
aged. Therefore other races female population and elderly were under represented however there is no 
indication to date that other races would respond differently to the overall population. 
Overall very high PASI 90 and s PGA 0/1 responses were demonstrated however not all patients respond 
(14% s PGA and < 20% PASI 90) while subgroup analyses did not identify a single variable of concern and 
statistically significant and clinically relevant differences from placebo were seen, it was demonstrated 
that the effects s PGA 0/1 were lower with high body weight (patients < 106 kg 81.9% vs patients > 128.2 
kgs 69.7 % difference from placebo). Also in patients with high ADA titres, although antibody responses 
were not shown to have affected the efficacy results the number of patients who developed antibodies is 
very low and the duration is limited, however evidence to date is favourable.  
Although the patient numbers were low it was observed that patients with high ADA titres ≥ 128 did not 
achieve the same favourable results as the patients with ADA titres < 128.  
It is unclear what results would be achieved in patients with body very high body weight and high ADA 
responses,  Nevertheless a slight loss of efficacy was observed in patients with more than 130 kgs 
compared with those <130 kgs. However no dose adjustment is considered necessary. 
Overall the majority of patients had moderate disease as baseline sPGA score was severe in 19.3% of 
subjects. Although it is agreed that the indication is for moderate and severe plaque psoriasis the analysis 
included both populations support the effects in each subgroup separately. 
It does not appear that patients were allowed rescue therapy during the programme however if patients 
required use, such as moderate to high potency topical steroids or systemic steroids whether any 
additional benefit would have been demonstrated or indeed the safety of this combination is unclear.

 In Study M15-992 patients who were randomised to withdrawal or continued treatment, a waning of 
efficacy was noted as early as Week 40, after missing only one dose, with a statistically significantly 
greater proportion of subjects on continuous risankizumab treatment maintaining sPGA 0/1 compared to 
those who were randomised to placebo at Week 40 (91.9% versus 81.8%, P < 0.01).  If a dose was 
missed it is advised to take the dose immediately and resume dosing regimen at the regular time. 
For PASI responses the effect size between risankizumab and placebo was 33.1% for PASI 90 and 33.7% 
for PASI 100, and the median time to loss of PASI 100 was shorter, at 113 days (HR 0.286, P < 0.001), 
with a 25th percentile of 57 days.  While there appears to be still a high maintenance of effects following 
withdrawal there is a decline noted in patients some of whom may have failed other treatments, it is not 
known whether patients who achieve sustained clinical remission could be managed with lower of less 
frequent dosing, the applicant is encouraged to further explore this in the post authorisation setting. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
With over 2,471 subjects with a total of 3351.6 PY of treatment duration the ICH E1 safety exposure 
requirements of >1500 patients exposed, 300 to 600 for 6 months, > 100 for 1 year met however less 
than 6.6%% were exposed for two years or more. 
Eighty percent of participants were White, 3% Black or African American. Approx. one third of participants 
were female. Ten percent of subjects were between 65 and 74 years of age.  
In  the  first  16  weeks  of  treatment,  22.1%  of  subjects  in  the  risankizumab  150  mg  group  reported 
infection  AEs  (90.8  E/100  PY)  compared  to  14.7%  of  subjects  in  the  placebo  group  (56.5  E/100  PY), 
20.9% of subjects in the ustekinumab group (87.0 E/100PY), and 24.3% of subjects in the adalimumab 
group (104.2E/100 PY) based on the Infections and infestations SOC. After 52 weeks of exposure, 44.8% 
of subjects treated with risankizumab (73.9 E/100 PY) compared with 52.3% of subjects treated with 
ustekinumab  (90.1  E/100  PY)  reported  infection  AEs.  Over  the  entire  psoriasis  program,  40.8%  of 
subjects  in  the  All  Risankizumab  group  reported  infection  AEs  (75.5  E/100  PY).  The  most  commonly 
reported infections viral upper respiratory tract infection, upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract 
infection, and sinusitis The majority of infections (97.8%) were non serious and mild to moderate (Grade 
1 or 2) in severity most of which did not necessitate treatment discontinuation.  
At 16 weeks five (0.4%) subjects in the risankizumab 150mg group experienced serious infections (1.7 
E/100 PY) compared to (0.3%) of the subjects in the placebo group (1.1 E/100 PY). After 52 weeks in the 
ustekinumab controlled analysis eight (1.3%) subjects in the risankizumab group experienced serious 
infections (1.8 E/100 PY) compared to 4(2.0%) subjects in the ustekinumab group (2.0E/100 PY). Over 
the entire psoriasis program (all doses), serious infections (using the Infections and infestations SOC) 
were  reported  in  29  (1.3%)  subjects  treated  with  risankizumab  (1.8E/100  PY  (95%  CI  1.27,  2.45) 
(1.5E/100PY in the SUR)). Serious infections in the risankizumab population (all doses) reported in ≥ 3 
subjects included sepsis (7 cases), cellulitis (5 cases), and pneumonia (4 cases). There were 2 serious 
cases  each  of  osteomyelitis  and  herpes  zoster.  One  case  each  of  pneumonia  and  sepsis  resulted  in 
discontinuation of study medication. Erysipelas was also reported in ≥ 3 subjects this SUR. 
The overall rate of fungal infections in the risankizumab 150 mg group was higher than in the placebo and 
ustekinumab groups (over short and long term exposure) and lower than in the adalimumab group. Over 
16 weeks 1.5% subjects in the risankizumab 150 mg group experienced fungal infections (5.2 E/100 PY) 
compared to 0.3% of the subjects in the placebo group (1.1 E/100PY), 0.8% subjects in the ustekinumab 
group (2.6 E/100 PY), and 2.0% subjects in the adalimumab group (7.4 E/100 PY).  Over 52 weeks 4.0% 
subjects  in  the  risankizumab  group  experienced  fungal  infections  (4.2  E/100  PY)  compared  to  1.0% 
subjects  in  the  ustekinumab  group  (1.0  E/  100  PY).  Over  the  entire  psoriasis  program  (risankizumab 
150mg group) 3.5% of the risankizumab treated patients (3.9 E/100PY (95% CI 3.04, 4.99)) experienced 
CHMP assessment report

fungal  infections.  Mucocutaneous  tinea  and  candida  fungal  infections  accounted  for  this  increased 
reporting rate of fungal infections Tinea infections reported in the risankizumab groups across all analyses 
including cases of tinea cruris, tinea manum tinea pedis, body tinea, tinea versicolour, and fungal skin 
infection and onychomycosis. These infections were generally mild to moderate in severity responsive to 
treatment and did not require treatment discontinuation. There was also a significant clustering of reports 
of  oral,  oesophageal,  cutaneous  candidiasis  and  vulvovaginal  candidiasis  following  treatment  with 
risankizumab  over  the  longer  term.  Oral  and  oesophageal  candidiasis  are  captured  both  as  ‘Fungal 
infections  and  opportunistic  infections.  Overall  5  cases  of  candida  were  reported  as  opportunistic 
infections. None of these events resulted in discontinuations in the studies and were not identified as 
cases of serious, systemic fungal infections. Candida infections were mild to moderate in severity and 
none led to treatment discontinuation.  
At  16  weeks  Grade  3  neutropenia  was  reported  in  one  patient  treated  with  risankizumab.  Overall  4 
subjects reported Grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, 2 of whom had a single excursion to Grade 3 followed by 
return to Baseline or close to Baseline (1 was described in the Primary Safety Pool above). The other 2 
subjects had low neutrophil counts (Grade 3 or 4) prior to receipt of study drug and remained low through 
most of the study. None of the Grade 3 neutropenia was associated with severe or serious infections. 
Eight subjects in the All Risankizumab group reported latent tuberculosis but had no clinical symptoms. 
The incidence of treatment emergent ADAs (19%) at 16 weeks increased up to 24% after 52 weeks and 
remained  stable  at  27%  over  104  weeks.  A  total  of  9%  ,  14  %  and  17%  of  patients  treated  with 
risankizumab at the recommended dosing regimen developed neutralizing antibodies to risankizumab at 
16 ,and 104 52 Weeks respectively. The overall incidence of ADA and NAB appears to further increase 
following stopping then retreating with risankizumab. Despite the high levels of ADA, no subject exposed 
to  risankizumab  in  the  psoriasis  studies  experienced  anaphylactic  reactions  or  serum  sickness-like 
reactions.  
The incidence of hypersensitivity AEs in risankizumab treated patients was comparable to placebo and 
adalimumab groups but higher than the ustekinumab group over both short and longer term exposure, 
driven  by  higher  rates  of  dermatitis  contact,  eczema,  dermatitis,  and  urticaria.  None  of  the 
hypersensitivity reactions were serious or led to discontinuation of study drug. Two cases of anaphylaxis 
have been reported in patients treated with risankizumab for Crohn’s disease and Psoriatic arthritis.  
Non-alcoholic  fatty  liver  disease  (NAFLD)  and  non-alcoholic  steatohepatitis  (NASH)  are  recognized 
comorbidities for psoriasis patients, despite this the overall reporting of hepatic events in these studies 
was low. During the 16-week treatment period hepatic events were more frequently reported for placebo 
(7.6 E/100 PY) and the ustekinumab (9.2 E/100 PY) treated patients and less frequently for adalimumab 
(5.3 E/100 PY) compared to risankizumab 150mg treated patients (6.0 E/100 PY). Overall the hepatic 
event rate was 5.6 E/100 PY.  Similarly, the incidence of serious and severe hepatic adverse events was 
low.  However,  it  is  noteworthy  that  three    cases  of  possible  drug  induced  liver  injury  were  reported 
following  treatment  with  risankizumab,  2  cases  following  treatment  with  150mg  risankizumab  for 
psoriasis  and  1  case  following  treatment  with  risankizumab  for  psoriatic  arthritis.  All  three  cases  had 
significant  confounding  factors  (liver  disease,  concomitant  medications.  All  three  were  considered 
possibly related to study drug by the investigator. Study was discontinued in all three cases. The case 
following treatment with risankizumab for psoriatic arthritis met the biochemical criteria for a Hy's Law 
case;  however,  following  clinical  review,  given  the  presence  of  multiple  confounders,  the  applicant 
considers that case does not meet the criteria for a Hy's Law case. Four cases of raised LFTs were reported 
as severe.  One additional patient met the criteria for HY’s law in the safety report. This was attributed to 
liver congestion following CHF. 
Injection  site  reactions  following  treatment  with  risankizumab150mg,  were  reported  more  frequently  
than with placebo (1.5% vs. 1.0%, respectively), but less frequently than with ustekinumab (3.8%) or 
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019

adalimumab (5.6%).The incidence of injection site reactions was higher among ADA positive (2.7% and 
5%) than the ADA negative (1.3% and 3.3%) at 16 and 52 weeks respectively. Overall (3.1%) reported 
injection  site  reactions.  None  of  the  injection  site  reactions  were  considered  severe  or  led  to  study 
discontinuation.  
The overall malignancy event rate (All Risankizumab – Psoriasis Analysis Set) was 1.3% (1.5 E/100 PY 
(0.96, 2.19)) for subjects exposed to risankizumab 150mg. The majority of these were nonmelanoma 
skin  cancers  (0.9  E/100  PY).  There  were  no  reports  of  lymphoma  or  lung  cancer.  Rates  of  malignant 
tumours for patients treated with risankizumab 150mg were slightly higher than those reported in the 
ustekinumab, ixekizumab, secukinumab, guselkumab, and brodalumab clinical development programs 
(0.81 – 1.3 E/100 PY) (Centocor 2008, FDA 2016, CDER 2016a, van de Kerkhof 2016, CDER 2016b). One 
patient treated with risankizumab 150mg died from metastatic bowel cancer. This was not considered 
related to study drug. 
 Patients with moderate to severe psoriasis have been shown to have an increased risk of myocardial 
infarction, stroke and CV mortality.  MACE, extended MACE, and other CV events were adjudicated by 
blinded external experts. The MACE rate in the risankizumab 150 mg group in the controlled portions of 
the studies (16 weeks of treatment) was 0.2 E/100 PY (1 case of CV death), compared to 1.1 E/100 PY in 
the placebo group. There were no MACE events in the comparator ustekinumab or adalimumab groups. 
One additional subject experienced an extended MACE and 2 subjects experienced CV events.  
After 52 weeks of exposure, the MACE rate in the risankizumab group was 0.3 E/100 PY.  Two (0.3%) 
subjects  in  the  risankizumab  group  experienced  a  MACE.    Two  additional  subjects  experienced  an 
extended MACE and 7 risankizumab-treated subjects experienced other CV events (1.3 E/100 PY). There 
were no MACE or other CV events reported in the ustekinumab comparator group. 
The overall MACE event rate for subjects with psoriasis treated with risankizumab 150mg is 0.5 E/100PY). 
Four additional subjects experienced extended MACE, a further 13 subjects had other CV events. Four of 
5  deaths  in  patients  treated  with  risankizumab  150mg  were  adjudicated  as  treatment  emergent  CV 
deaths (one of these deaths was subsequently attributed to a drug overdose) and 2 other deaths that 
were classified as cause undetermined. Three of the deaths occurred in subjects with multiple cardiac risk 
factors and were likely to have had a cardiac cause. All of the deaths were considered by the Applicant to 
be unrelated to study treatment.  
Five  additional  deaths  were  reported  in  the  safety  update  report  submitted  during  the  procedure. 
(Preferred Terms of epileptic seizure, pancreatitis, cardiac arrest, cardiac failure, and death). This doubles 
the total number of deaths, bringing it to a total of 10 deaths, following treatment with risankizumab. Two 
and possibly a third death being adjudicated as cardiovascular deaths. All 10 deaths occurred in male 
patients. 
Neuropsychiatric disorders are more frequent in patients with psoriasis. Depression as well as suicidal 
ideation  and  behaviour  are  more  commonly  reported  in  patients  with  psoriasis.  Suicidal  Ideation 
behaviour (SIB) has been identified as potential safety concern in other therapies that act on the same 
pathways in plaque psoriasis. Overall (All Risankizumab 150mg – Psoriasis Analysis Set), the depression 
event rate in the All Risankizumab group was 1.2 E/100 PY.  Twenty (1.3%) subjects had a depression 
event, 16 of which were AEs of depression.  Of the 16 subjects with depression, 2 subjects had an SAE.  
None of the depression events led to discontinuation of study drug. In this analysis set, the SIB event rate 
was also low (0.1 E/100 PY).  There were no completed suicides in the risankizumab psoriasis clinical 
studies.  One subject had a self-injurious ideation AE that was not serious and 1 subject had a suicide 
attempt that was serious.  There were no discontinuations due to SIB AEs. Both events of SIB were in 
subjects with multiple confounding factors. The  SIB event rate (0.1 E/100 PY) is comparable to the SIB 
rate  in  other  recent  clinical  development  programs  (guselkumab  0.10/100  subject-yrs,  secukinumab, 
0.06/100 subject-yrs; ixekizumab, 0.14/100 subject yrs).  
CHMP assessment report  
EMA/191996/2019  
Page 174/181 
 
 
 
The  overall  rates  of  AE  experienced  in  subjects  ≥  65  years  of  age  and  are  comparable  to  the  overall 
population however higher rates of SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuation, and severe AEs were reported in 
over 65 age group. 
Overall 78.7% of women and 73.2% of men reported AEs. The proportions of subjects with SAEs, or who 
discontinued due to an AE in the risankizumab group was generally similar among men and women apart 
from reports of deaths.   
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Although 7 months additional safety data has been submitted by the applicant long-term exposure to 
risankizumab (>18months) is limited. Only 6.6% were exposed for more than 2 years and only 3.4% 
exposed for more than 3 years in clinical trials. This extent of exposure is insufficient to fully characterize 
the unfavourable effects particularly those with a long induction period (malignancy) or those that might 
change with repeat exposure over time (ADA profile and immunological AEs). Long term data has been 
included  as  missing  data  in  the  RMP.  Long  term  safety  will  be  further  characterised  in  the  post 
authorisation setting. 
The most frequently reported adverse events were infections. At 16 weeks exposure-adjusted infection 
AEs in the risankizumab treated population were higher than placebo and ustekinumab but lower than 
adalimumab. Over longer tem treatment, the exposure adjusted event rate decreased and was lower than 
the ustekinumab event rate at week 52. There was a slight increase up to 77 weeks of exposure but 
overall the exposure adjusted event rate for infections was stable over longer term exposure.  
Although  the  overall  rate  of  serious  infection  is  low  and  remained  stable  across  short  and  long-term 
exposure, there were(including reports from the SUR) 5 reports of cellulitis and 7 reports of sepsis, 2 
reports of osteomyelitis 14 reports of herpes Zoster (2 serious reports) and 5 reports of pneumonia in the 
overall  risankizumab  treated  population,  half  of  which  were  considered  related  to  study  drug  by  the 
investigator and two of which resulted in discontinuation of study drug. The extent to which disruption of 
the IL23 pathway and its impact on the risk for the development of serious bacterial infections will be 
further characterized in the post authorisation setting. 
There was an increased reporting rate for fungal infections in risankizumab treated patients compared to 
placebo and ustekinumab (over 16 and 52 weeks). Tinea fungal infections accounted for some of this 
increased  reporting  rate  of  fungal  infections  reported  in  the  risankizumab  groups  across  all  analyses. 
There  was  also  a  significant  clustering  of  reports  of  oral,  oesophageal,  cutaneous  candidiasis  and 
vulvovaginal candidiasis following treatment with risankizumab over the longer term. Candida infections 
could  be  expected  following  treatment  with  risankizumab  due  to  its  disruption  of  the  IL23  immune 
pathway. 
Although  there  was  no  overall  signal  of  more  potential  for  hepatotoxicity  in  risankizumab  patients 
compared to placebo or comparator treatment over the short and longer term treatment, the incidence of 
3 significant hepatobiliary SAEs leading to discontinuation of study drug is a concern. Inclusion   drug 
induced hepatotoxicity as a potential risk in the RMP is currently not warranted. Cases of hepatotoxicity 
will continue to be monitored in PSURs. 
The incidence of treatment emergent ADAs was relatively high, 19% of subjects at 16 weeks developed 
ADAs increasing up to 24% after 52 weeks. A total of 9% and 14 % of patients treated with risankizumab 
at  the  recommended  dosing  regimen  developed  neutralizing  antibodies  to  risankizumab  at  16  and  52 
Weeks  respectively.  The  incidence  of  injection  site  reactions  was  numerically  higher  among  antidrug 
antibody positive than the antidrug antibody negative subjects. Immunogenicity has a small but clinically 
relevant  impact  on  injection-site  reactions.  This  is  included  in  section  4.8  of  the  SmPC.  Inclusion  of 
immunogenicity as a potential risk in the RMP is currently not warranted.

Although the overall MACE event rate is low (0.5E/100PY), after adjusting for exposure, there was a slight 
trend towards increased numbers of MACE, and other CV events with exposure to risankizumab over the 
longer term. At 16 weeks the reporting rate for MACE in the risankizumab 150 mg group was 0.2 E/100 
PY  compared  with  0.3  E/100  PY  at  52  weeks  and  0.5E/100PY  overall  although  the  event  rate  never 
exceeded the event rate for placebo at 16 weeks (1.1E/100PY). Significant cardiovascular events were 
more common following treatment with risankizumab compared to ustekinumab at 16 and over 52 weeks. 
Four of five deaths initially reported for risankizumab were initially adjudicated as CV deaths. Three of the 
four patients who died had significant confounding CV history. The remaining death was attributed to an 
opioid drug overdose.  
Overall  the  event  rate  of  any  malignant  tumour  (including  nonmelanoma  skin  cancer  [NMSC])  with 
risankizumab (all doses) was 1.3 E/100 PY and slightly higher at 1.5E/100PY for subjects treated with 
risankizumab 150mg only. This is slightly higher than the rates of malignant tumours reported in the 
ustekinumab,  ixekizumab,  secukinumab,  guselkumab,  and  brodalumab  clinical  programs  (0.81  –  1.3 
E/100 patient-years). 
The overall suicidal ideation and behaviour rate was low. Although suicidal ideation and behaviour have 
been included in the RMPs for other similar type products, there is insufficient data to support its inclusion 
as an important potential risk in the RMP for risankizumab.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Risankizumab is a humanized immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1) monoclonal antibody that is directed against 
IL-23 p19 as a targeted biological treatment for patients with plaque psoriasis. Binding of risankizumab to 
IL-23 p19 inhibits the action of IL-23 to induce and sustain T helper (Th) 17 type cells, innate lymphoid 
cells, γδT cells, and natural killer (NK) cells responsible for tissue inflammation, destruction and aberrant 
tissue repair.  
Risankizumab has been robustly demonstrated to work very effectively in a very heterogeneous 
population with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis and a significant proportion of patients achieved 
disease clearance. As the effect size of complete clearance – the desired treatment outcome - as 
measured by PASI 100 and sPGA-0 responders was also large.

Statistically significant results were demonstrated versus placebo and when compared with active 
treatment- Ustekinumab, this translated into an improvement in the quality of life and also demonstrated 
significant improvements in signs and symptoms of psoriasis. 
Furthermore, improvements were demonstrated in patients not achieving an adequate response to 
Adalimumab therapy (PASI < 50, AND PASI 50-90) which may be a more treatment resistant population. 
Therefore, Risankizumab provides additional treatment options for a wide range of patients from naïve to 
systemic therapy through to those patients who are not adequately controlled on Adalimumab or 
ustekinumab. Improvements in regional psoriasis such as nail, scalp, foot and hand involvement were 
also demonstrated 
Maintenance of effect was demonstrated. The vast majority of patients with continuous Risankizumab 
treatment at 52 weeks maintained their initial PASI and s PGA responses seen at week 16. 
Subgroups analyses showed a consistently superior effect compared to placebo and active comparator 
Ustekinumab and no notable differences in efficacy were seen. 
The  most  relevant  safety  concerns  identified  so  far  with  treatment  with  risankizumab  are  related  to 
infections, (serious infection, fungal infections, Herpes Zoster infections).  The applicant has committed 
to including serious infections as a safety outcome in the planned post-marketing registry-based cohort 
study, (category 3 in the RMP) and further evaluating the risks of serious infections in psoriasis patients 
exposed to risankizumab relative to similar patients on other systemic psoriasis treatments. Although the 
overall rate of serious infections is comparable to other similar type agents the progression of serious 
infections to cases of sepsis is a concern. Serious infection is identified as a potential risk in the RMP and 
the applicant plans to conduct a post-marketing safety study to further monitor serious infections that 
require hospitalisation. 
Three cases of drug induced hepatotoxicity were identified in the overall risankizumab development plan. 
These  were  heavily  confounded  were  unlikely  to  be  attributed  to  treatment  with  risankizumab.    Two 
additional hepatic SAEs were identified in the SUR. (autoimmune hepatitis; hepatic cirrhosis). Regarding 
malignancies  there  was  a  slightly  higher  rate  of  malignancy  seen  with  risankizumab  compared  with 
similar agents. Further longer term data is needed to fully characterise the risk of malignancies. This will 
be monitored in the ongoing long term study mentioned in the RMP. 
The effect of risankizumab on cardiovascular system over longer term exposure should continue to be 
monitored. MACE is included as a potential risk in the RMP. Additional safety-related issues concerning 
safety in patients >65yrs, clinical impact of immunogenicity has been addressed by the section 4.8 of the 
SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The efficacy of Risankizumab in the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis was robustly 
demonstrated across a wide population as need in treatment naïve, previous systemic therapy and in 
disease severity.  The onset was achieved near maximal effect at week 16 and maintenance of effect was 
demonstrated to 52 weeks. The effect size was highly statistically significant, clinically relevant and 
superior to two active comparators. 
Overall risankizumab has a low rate of adverse events which is comparable to placebo and generally more 
favourable than ustekinumab and adalimumab. Other concerns identified include fungal infections, MACE 
over longer term exposure. Safety data in patients >65 is limited as stated in the SmPC. Longer term data 
(>18months) is limited however an OLE study (M15-997) over 3years is ongoing (listed as category 3 in 
the RMP) and will provide further long term data. Overall, based on the data presented, the beneficial 
effects outweigh the unfavourable effects seen in the clinical programme.

Risankizumab can be self-administered which after initial treatment (loading dose and 4 weeks) is 
administered every 12 weeks this is considered convenient for patients as it limits the number of 
subcutaneous injections. Furthermore, as the frequency is every 12 weeks’ compliance should not pose a 
concern this was also reflected in the trials. 
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Skyrizi is positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Skyrizi is favourable in the following indication: 
Skyrizi is indicated for the treatment of moderate to severe plaque psoriasis in adults who are candidates 
for systemic therapy. 
The CHMP therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation subject to the following 
conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal product subject to restricted medical prescription. 
Other conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation

Summary of opinion1 (initial authorisation) 
Pemetrexed Sandoz 
pemetrexed 
On 23 July 2015, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) adopted a positive 
opinion, recommending the granting of a marketing authorisation for the medicinal product Pemetrexed 
Sandoz, intended for the treatment of unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma and locally advanced 
or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology.  
The applicant for this medicinal product is Sandoz GmbH. 
Pemetrexed Sandoz will be available as a powder (100 mg, 500 mg and 1,000 mg) for concentrate for 
solution for infusion. The active substance of Pemetrexed Sandoz, pemetrexed, is a multi-targeted anti 
cancer antifolate agent (ATC code: L01BA04) that exerts its action by disrupting crucial folate dependent 
metabolic processes essential for cell replication. 
Pemetrexed Sandoz is a generic of Alimta, which has been authorised in the EU since 20 September 
2004. Studies have demonstrated the satisfactory quality of Pemetrexed Sandoz. Since Pemetrexed 
Sandoz is administered intravenously and is 100% bioavailable, a bioequivalence study versus the 
reference product Alimta was not required. A question and answer document on generic medicines can be 
found here. 
The full indication is:  
"Malignant pleural mesothelioma 
Pemetrexed Sandoz in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the treatment of chemotherapy naïve 
patients with unresectable malignant pleural mesothelioma. 
Non-small cell lung cancer 
Pemetrexed Sandoz in combination with cisplatin is indicated for the first line treatment of patients with 
locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell 
histology (see section 5.1).

Pemetrexed Sandoz is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of locally advanced or 
metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology in patients whose 
disease has not progressed immediately following platinum-based chemotherapy (see section 5.1). 
Pemetrexed Sandoz is indicated as monotherapy for the second line treatment of patients with locally 
advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell histology (see 
section 5.1)." 
It is proposed that Pemetrexed Sandoz be subject to prescription and administered under the supervision 
of physicians experienced in the use of anti-cancer chemotherapy. 
Detailed recommendations for the use of this product will be described in the summary of product 
characteristics (SmPC), which will be published in the European public assessment report (EPAR) and 
made available in all official European Union languages after the marketing authorisation has been 
granted by the European Commission.

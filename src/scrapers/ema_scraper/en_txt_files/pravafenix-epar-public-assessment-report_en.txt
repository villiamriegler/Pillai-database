2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Mixed  hyperlipidemia is  characterised  by  an  elevation  of  total  cholesterol  (TC)  and  triglycerides  (TG), 
or  by  the  elevation  of  low-density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (LDL-C)  and  TG,  either  acquired  or  familial. 
High-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) level is often low. 
Among  the  most  notable  elevated  risk  factors  for  the  development  of  atherosclerotic  cardiovascular 
(CV) disease are the elevated levels of LDL-C and the reduced levels of HDL-C.  
Overall  prevalence  of  mixed  hyperlipidemia  varies  between  10  and  25%  with  many  cases  being  the 
result  of  secondary  causes.  Familial  mixed  hyperlipidaemia  is  one  of  the  most  common  hereditary 
disorders  predisposing  to  early  coronary  death.  Many  patients  have  polygenic  mixed  hyperlipidemia 
and/or  insulin  resistance  or  diabetes  mellitus,  while  a  small  fraction  of  patients  (0.2%)  have 
monogenic hyperlipidemia. Patients with polygenic or monogenic mixed hyperlipidemia form a high risk 
group for development of atherosclerosis especially coronary heart disease (CHD). 
The  achievement  of  lipid  control  in  mixed  dyslipidaemia  usually  requires  progressive  treatment:  diet 
and  exercise,  followed  by  pharmacological  intervention  with  an  HMG  CoA  reductase  (statins)  in 
monotherapy, subsequently with statins in combination with niacin or fibrates. 
Pravafenix 40/160 mg is a fixed dose combination (FDC) of pravastatin and fenofibrate formulated as 
hard capsules. Only one fixed dose combination containing 160 mg fenofibrate and 40 mg pravastatin 
is claimed. 
Fenofibrate is a fibric acid derivative, introduced on the market in 1975. It exerts his effects mainly 
by  activating  the  peroxisome  proliferator-activated  receptor-alpha  (PPAR-alpha).  It  is  generally 
authorised in patients with mixed dyslipidaemia.  At the time being, the benefit/risk of fibrates is under 
review by the CHMP under article 31 of Directive 2001/83 EEC, as amended. Indeed, in 2005, due to 
the publication of the FIELD study (Effects of long term fenofibrate therapy on cardiovascular events in 
9795  people  with  type  2  diabetes  mellitus;  a  randomised  controlled  trial.  Lancet  2005,  366,  9500: 
1849-62;  ERRATUM:  Lancet,  2006,  Vol  368,  October  21,  p1419-1420),  a  risk-benefit  assessment  on 
the fibrate class was performed, which concluded that overall, despite the long presence of fibrates on 
the market, there is only limited evidence of a long term clinical benefit from their use in the primary 
or  secondary  prevention  of  cardiovascular  disease.  It  was  agreed  that  the  use  of  fibrates  at  first  line 
therapy  in  the  treatment  of  primary  hypercholesterolaemia  is  not  justified  anymore.  However,  there 
are  subgroups  of  patients,  who  may  still  benefit  from  this  therapy.  Thus,  it  was  agreed  that  the 
product information for all fibrates should be updated to indicate that fibrates should be considered as 
first line treatment in patients with severe hypertriglyceridaemia with or without low HDL cholesterol. 
In patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia, fibrates should be given only when statins are contraindicated 
or  not intolerated.  Finally,  a  statement  should  be  included  in  the  Summary  of  Product  Characteristics 
(SmPC)  of  all  products  to  indicate  that  treatment  with  fibrates  may  reduce  coronary  heart  disease 
events  but  no  beneficial  effect  on  all  cause  mortality  in  the  primary  or  secondary  prevention  of 
cardiovascular  disease  has  been  confirmed.  These  recommendations  were  further  challenged  and  a 
procedure under Art 31 of directive 2001/83 EEC, as amended was triggered.  
Pravastatin  sodium  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  pravastatin)  is  a  hydrophilic  3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl-coenzyme  A  (HMG-CoA)  reductase  inhibitor  (statin),  which  reduces  cholesterol 
biosynthesis by interfering with the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step 
in  cholesterol  biosynthesis.  Pravastatin  has  been  used  worldwide  for  more  than  10  years  in  the 
following indications: 
Hypercholesterolemia:  Treatment  of  primary  hypercholesterolemia  or  mixed  dyslipidaemia,  as  an 
adjunct  to  diet,  when  response  to  diet  and  other  non-pharmacological  treatments  (e.g.  exercise, 
weight reduction) is inadequate. 
Primary prevention: Reduction of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with moderate or 
severe hypercholesterolemia and at high risk of a first cardiovascular event, as an adjunct to diet.

Secondary prevention: Reduction of cardiovascular mortality and morbidity in patients with a history of 
myocardial infarction or unstable angina pectoris and with either normal or increased cholesterol levels, 
as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors. 
Post  transplantation:  Reduction  of  post  transplantation  hyperlipidaemia  in  patients  receiving 
immunosuppressive therapy following solid organ transplantation.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
Pravafenix  (Fenofibrate/Pravastatin  sodium)  160/40  mg  fixed  dose  combination  is  a  new combination 
of  two  well  known  active  substances  described  in  the  European  Pharmacopeia.  The  proposed  drug 
product is a hard gelatine capsule consisting of (A) a fatty semi-solid composition consisting of 160mg 
fenofibrate and (B) a coated tablet containing 40mg of pravastatin sodium.  
Pravafenix 
is  packaged 
in  HDPE  (High  density  polyethylene  coloured  white),  bottle  or 
Aluminium/Aluminium blisters (OPA – Alu – PVC ) 
2.2.2.  Active Substance  
Fenofibrate. 
Fenofibrate  is  a  white  to  off-white  crystalline  powder.  It  is  insoluble  in  water  (saturation  solubility 
0.8 µg/ml).  As  fenofibrate  has  no  ionizable  group,  its  water  solubility  is  not  influenced  by  the  pH. 
Fenofibrate is a lipophilic molecule (log P is 4.6), and has the following structure: 
Chemical names (IUPAC nomenclature): Isopropyl 2-[4-(4-chlorobenzoyl)phenoxy]-2-
methylpropionate 
No polymorphism is known for fenofibrate. The melting point of fenofibrate is between 79°C and 82°C.  
Fenofibrate is a BCS class II molecule (low solubility, high absorption) and bioavailability is limited by 
dissolution from drug product. 
Manufacture 
The  active  substance  is  supplied  by  two  manufacturers.  For  both  of  them  a  Certificate  of  Suitability 
(CEP) granted by the EDQM has been presented covering the manufacturing. Both manufacturers have 
declared  the  absence  of  use  of  material  of  human  or  animal  origin  in  the  manufacture  of  the 
substance.

Specification 
Since  the  manufacturers  have  obtained  a  certification  of  suitability  (CEP)  granted  by  the  EDQM,  the 
information  available  is  the  one  presented  in  the  current  edition  of  the  PhEur.  monograph  for 
fenofibrate,  including  the  additional  tests  for  residual  solvent  (GC)  mentioned  in  the  corresponding 
CEPs. 
Batch  analysis  data  from  the  manufacturers  have  been  provided.  All  batches  complied  with  the 
requirements from the active substance specification 
Stability 
The Certificate of Suitability provided by the manufacturers covers the re-test period and packaging 
material.  
Pravastatin sodium. 
Pravastatin  sodium  is  a  white  or  yellowish-white  powder  or  crystalline  powder.  It  is  soluble  in  water 
(> 300mg/ml). Pravastatin Sodium exists in several polymorphic forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, H1, I, J, 
K and L which are not likely to induce different pharmacokinetic profiles or to influence the shelf life of 
the  drug  substance/drug  products.  This  fact  is  explained  by  the  high  solubility  of  pravastatin  in 
aqueous  medium  and  by  the  water  uptake  of  the  powder  which  is  independent  on  the  polymorphic 
form. Pravastatin has the following structure: 
Chemical names (IUPAC nomenclature): Sodium (3R,5R)-3,5-dihydroxy-7-[(1S,2S,6S,8S,8aR)-6- 
hydroxy-2-methyl-8-[[(2S)-2-methylbutanoyl]oxy]-1,2,6,7,8,8ahexahydronaphthalen- 
1-yl]heptone 
Manufacture 
Pravastatin  is  supplied  by  two  different  manufacturers.  For  both  of  them  a  Certificate  of  Suitability 
(CEP)  granted  by  the  EDQM  has  been  presented  covering  the  manufacturing  processes.  Both 
manufacturers  have  declared  the  absence  of  use  of  material  of  human  or  animal  origin  in  the 
manufacture of the substance.

Specification 
Since  the  manufacturers  have  obtained  a  certification  of  suitability  of  monographs  of  the  European 
Pharmacopoeia,  the  information  available  is  the  one  presented  in  the  current  edition  of  the  PhEur. 
monograph  for  pravastatin  sodium, including  the  additional  tests  for  residual  solvent  (GC)  mentioned 
in the corresponding CEPs. X-ray diffractograms reports are obtain
ed for both suppliers and presented 
fo
r information. No particle size specification is required for Pravastatin sodium. Nevertheless, particle 
size distribution and dissolution testing are assessed for information for the two proposed Pravastatin 
sodium suppli
ers, and found to be comparable on a routine basis. 
Stability 
The  Certificate  of  Suitability  provided  by  the  two  manufacturers  covers  the  re-test  period  and 
packaging material.  
Moreover, one of the manufacturer present stability studies for batches stored in long term conditions 
(2°C-8°C)  and  accelerated  conditions 
(25°C/60%RH).  Active  substance  batches  were  packed  in  the 
commercial  container.  Stability  has  been  assessed  for  appearance,  assay,  water  content  and  related 
substances level. A satisfactory re-test period has been defined for each supplier.  
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product  
Pharmaceutical Development 
The medicinal product has been developed as a fixed dose combination of two well known molecules. 
The  final  form  is  a  hard  gelatin  capsule  consisting  of  (A)  a  fatty  semi-solid  composition  consisting  of 
160mg fenofibrate and (B) a coated tablet containing 40mg of pravastatin sodium. 
Since  fenofibrate  is  a  BCS  class  II  molecule  (low  solubility,  high  absorption),  the  applicant  has 
attempted to produce a pharmaceutical form of fenofibrate by increasing solubility using an amphiphilic 
excipient  in  order  to  enhance  its  bioav
ailability.  The  release  of  the  active  ingredient  from  the  lipidic 
matrix  occurs  via  an  erosion-diffusion  phenomenon  when  the  composition  comes  into  contact  with 
gastro-intestinal  fluids.  The  release  does  not  occur  through  the  melting  of  the  composition  since  the 
melting range is between 45 and 50°C 
The  different  excipients  used  were  selected  in  order  to  allow  complete  dissolution  of  fenofibrate, 
enhance  the  dissolution  rate  and  also  reduces  considerably  the  variability  of  the  dissolution  profiles. 
The excipients were also selected with a view to manufacturing feasibility. 
The  semi-solid  formulation  was  optimized  and  several  tests  such  a
s  determination  of  the  dissolved 
fr
action  in  the  drug  product,  characterization  of  the  formulation  by  environmental  scanning  electron 
microscopy  (ESEM)  and  differential  scanning  calorimetry  (DSC)  were  also  developed  in  order  to 
adequately characterize the final fenofibrate semi-solid formulation.  
Manufacturing  holding  time  between  the  manufacture  steps  was  defined  and  overall  the  process  has 
been optimised based on previous experience in semisolid formulation.

Another main goal during development was to stabilize pravastatin within the drug product matrix, to 
prevent  any  interaction  between  the  fatty  mass  containing  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin.  In  order  to 
achieve this, pravastatin was formulated in a separate tablet for filling into the capsule. Degradation of 
pravastatin is induced by acidic media and is accelerated by oxidants. To improve pravastatin stability, 
an alkaline agent and an antioxidant were introduced in the tablet formulation. As the tablet has to fall 
freely  in  the  capsule,  uncoated  concave  tablets  were  se
lected.  Coating  of  the  tablet  was  found 
necessary  to  give  sufficient  hardness  to  the  tablet  for  subsequent  handling  and  encapsulation,  to 
prevent  the  formation  of  dust  in  the  feeding  hopper,  to  make  the  tablet  slippery  and  to  avoid  direct 
contact between pravastatin and the fenofibrate hot blend.  
Test of in vitro release rate of the combination fenofibrate and pravastatin were performed. The  goal 
was  to  use  the  same  dissolution  medium  to  assess  the  release  of  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin. 
Conditions
  were  optimized  so  as  to  be  suitable  for  both  drug  substances.  The  aim  of  the  dissolution 
te
st  was  mainly  to  assess  the  batch-to-batch  consistency  and  the  stability  of  the  pharmaceutical 
product. The influence of different parameters such as pH or adding of different tensioactives were also 
studied.

The production process is performed in compliance with the principle of Good Manufacturing Practices, 
as laid down in volume IV of the r
ules Governing Medicinal Products in the European Community. 
The  preparation  is  performed  in  3  main  steps:  Manufacturing  of  pravastatin  coated  tablet, 
manufacturing of fenofibr

Descriptions  and  validation  are  given  for  the  all  the  non  compendial  methods.  The  specifications, 
acceptance  criteria  and  test  methods  are  justified,  a
  rational  is  provided  in  particular  for  degradation 
p
roducts.  Limits  for  each  individual  degradation  product  are  within  the  ICH  identification  and 
qualification thresholds at release and for shelf-life.  
Stability of the product 
Stability studies have been performed on 5 batches: 3 pilot scale batches manufactured and packaged 
in  Aluminium/aluminium  blister  and  2  industrial  scale  batches  manufactured  and  p
ackaged  in 
Aluminium/aluminium  blister,  in  60ml  HDPE  battle  and  in  150ml  HDPE  bottle.  All  batches  were 
manufactured with fenofibrate and pravastati
n sodium from two specific manufacturers. 
All  batches  were    placed  on  stability  in  ICH  long  term  25°C/60%RH,  inte
rmediate  30°C/65%HR  and 
accelerated  (40°C/75%RH) conditions. 
All tested parameters remain within the specification for the period tested. 
Based on the stability results submitted for up to 30 months for pilot batch
es in alu/alu blisters and 6 
months for industrial batches in alu/alu blisters and HDPE bottles, the shelf-life as defined in the SmPC 
in the original packaging and the proposed storage conditions are justified. 
2.2.4.  Discussion and conclusion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
It is unusual to have an encapsulated tablet; however, this is necessary to solve the stability problems 
of two separate active substances. The active substances and medicinal product have been adequately 
described. Excipients used in the formulation of the medicinal product and the manufacturing process 
selected  are  typical  for  capsules  formulations.  The
  results  of  the  tests  indicate  that  the  active 
substances  and  the  medicinal  product  can  be  reproducibly  manufactured  and  therefore  the  product 
should have a satisfactory and uniform performance. 
At the time of the CHMP opinion, there were minor unresolved quality issues, which have no i
mpact on 
the  Benefit/Risk  ratio  of  the  product.  The  applicant  gave  a  Letter  of  Undertaking  and  committed  to 
resol
ve it as a Follow-up Measures after the opinion, within an agreed time-frame. 
2.3.  Non-clinical asp
ects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
Pravafenix  is  a  fixed-dose  combination  of  the  3-hydroxy  3-meth
ylglutaryl  coenzyme  A  (HMG-CoA) 
ductase inhibitor (statin), pravastatin, and of the fibric acid derivative (fibrate), fenofibrate, intended 
re
for use in the treatment of mixed hyperlipidemia. The non-clinical development programme is aimed to 
support the use of fenofibrate/pravastatin at the dose 160/40 mg. 
P
ravastatin was registered in the EU via individual national procedures. A referral procedure (Art. 30 of 
Council Directive 2001/83/EC) led to a harmonised labelling (European Commission Decision, 2 March 
2004). 
Fenofibrate  has  been  marketed  in  Europe  since  the  mid  1970’s.  It  has  been  registered  via 
national procedures at various strengths and dosing regimen.

2.3.2.  Pharmacology 
Primary pharmacodynamic studies 
Pravastatin  is  a  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme  A  (HMG-CoA)  reductase  inhibitor,  commonly 
used  in  the  management  of  hypercholesterolemia.  HMG-CoA  reductase  catalyses  the  conversion  of 
HMG-CoA to mevalonate. Competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase in the liver by pravastatin leads 
to  transcriptional  up  regulated  production  of  the  cell  surface  LDL  receptor  as  well  as  decreased 
cholesterol  synthesis.  The  associated  reduction  in  intracellular  cholesterol  concentration  induces  LDL-
receptor expression on the hepatocyte cell surface, which results in increased extraction of LDL-C from 
the  blood  and  decreased  circulating  LDL-C  concentrations.  Pravastatin  is  a  hydrophilic  statin  and  is 
taken  up  by  hepatocytes  via  a  carrier-mediated  active  transport  mechanism  utilising  the  anion 
transport system. 
Fenofibrate  is  a  member  of  the  fibrate  class  of  lipid-lowering  drugs.  Its  mechanism  of  action  derives 
from  activation  of  peroxisome  proliferator-activated  receptors    (PPRAR)  that  are  expressed  in  the 
liver.  The  fenofibric  acid,  the  active  metabolite  of  the  fenofibrate,  is  responsible  for  the  primary 
pharmacodynamics  effects  of  the  drug:  reductions  in total  plasma  cholesterol,  low-density  lipoprotein 
cholesterol, triglycerides, and very low-density lipoprotein concentrations and increases in high-density 
lipoprotein  cholesterol  and  apolipoproteins  Apo  AI  and  Apo  AII  concentrations.  These  effects  are 
mediated  by  activation  of  PPAR.  Fenofibrate  also  reduces  the  susceptibility  of  Very  Low  Density 
Lipoproteins (VLDL) and LDL to oxidative modification.

pravastatin  in  humans  and  animals  has  been  submitted  and  this  is  considered  appropriate  since  the 
secondary pharmacodynamics properties of fenofibrate and pravastatin are considered well known.   
Clinical  trials  with  pravastatin  have  shown  positive  impact  of  statins  on  cardiovascular  morbidity  and 
mortality  due  to  its  antithrombotic,  anti-inflammatory  properties  and  improvement  in  endothelial 
dysfunction.  Pravastatin  also  seems  to  prevent  the  development  of  obesity  and  diabetes  in  diet-
induced  obese  mice  by  increasing  oxygen  consumption  and  decreasing  the  respiratory  quotient  and

Pravastatin increases ALT and AST levels in humans but normally, these return to the baseline values 
without  the  need  for  treatment  discontinuation  and  are  not  associated  with  hepatic  symptoms.  The 
most serious adverse effect associated with statin therapy is myopathy, which may progress to fatal or 
nonfatal  rhabdomyolysis,  myopathy  and  severe  muscle  problems.  Pravastatin  is  less  myotoxic  than 
other  statins  due  to  the  hydrophilic  character  of  pravastatin  and  its  selective  affinity  for  liver  cell  via

address the pharmacokinetics patterns of fenofibrate and pravastatin.  
Absorption 
Pravastatin is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract of rats, dogs and monkeys. A study on bile 
duct cannulated rats showed that pravastatin is almost equally absorbed through a wide area from the 
stomach to the ileum. The extent of absorption of pravastatin is estimated to be approximately 65% in 
ts based on biliary excretion and 45% in dogs based on urinary excretion. A high bioavailability was 
ra
observed in all species except monkeys, where it was only 18%. The drug is absorbed from the upper 
part of the small intestine, probably via the proton-coupled carrier-mediated transport. 
After  absorption,  fenofibrate  is  rapidly  hydrolysed  into  its  major  metabolite,  fenofibric  acid.  The 
reduction  of  the  carbonyl  group  of  fenofibric  acid  results  in  another  active  but  minor  metabolite,  the 
re
duced fenofibric acid. A significant proportion of fenofibrate is, however, not completely absorbed by 
the gastrointes
tinal tract, as suggested by the considerable amounts of intact fenofibrate found in the 
faeces.  
Distribution 
After  oral  administration  of  500mg/kg  pravastatin  to  rats,  the  time  to  attain  the  maximum  plasma 
concentration is around 1 hour, and the maximum level is about 1 g/ml. The plasma protein binding 
of the drug is almost the same in rats and human, i.e. 43% to 60%, which is significantly lower than 
that of other statins. Pravastatin is distributed mostly into the liver and the gastrointestinal tract after 
both  intravenous  and  oral  dosing  in  rats  and  oral  dosing  in  dogs.  The  concentration  in  other  tissues 
was  close  to,  or  less  than  that  in  plasma.  Pravastatin  is  subjected  to  a  first-pass.  The  first-pass 
moval  rate  is  about  0.7.  A  nonlinear  relationship  was  observed  between  the  liver  and  plasma 
re
concentrations.  These  results  suggest  that  the  dose  dependency  in  the  distribution  volume  of 
pravastatin is due to a saturable uptake by the liver. 
The  tissue  radioactivity  concentration  was  measured  in  radio-labelled  fenofibrate  in  specific  intervals 
after single oral administration to Sprague-Dawley rats. The highest concentration at 30 minutes after 
a
dministration  was  found  in  the  liver,  the  kidney  and  the  stomach  corresponding  to  2  to  3  times  the 
plasma concen
tration. The protein binding rate of plasma concentration was about 99% for both male 
and female rats.

Metabolism 
Pravastatin is not significantly metabolised by CYP3A4, but is largely excreted as parent compound into 
the faeces via the bile and into the urine. After single oral administration of radio-labelled pravastatin 
to  rats  and  monkeys,  unchanged  pravastatin  represented  47%  and  60%  of  the  total  biliary 
radioactivity,  respectively,  with  small  recoveries  of  metabolites  (less  than  11%).  The  identified 
metabolites  were  3’α-iso-  and  6’-epi-pravastatin  both  formed  by  isomerisation,  pravastatin  lactone, 
3’,5’-dihydrodiol-pravastatin  and  pravastatin  4’a  α-glutathione  conjugate.  In  plasma,  pravastatin 
ccounted  for  only  5%  and  11%  of  the  total  plasma  radioactivity  in  rats  and  monkeys,  respectively, 
a
although  pravastatin  is  the  major  component  (70%)  in  dog  plasma.  Unchanged  pravastatin  accounts 
for approximately 20-30% of the rat liver radioactivity. 
After  absorption,  fenofibrate  is  rapidly  and  completely  hydrolysed  to  its  major  metabolite,  fenofibric 
acid.  The  reduction  of  the  carbonyl  group  of  fenofibric  acid  results  in  another  active  but  minor 
metabolite,  the  reduced  fenofibric  acid.  Both  metabolites  are  conjugated  with  glucuronic  acid  and 
excreted  mainly  in  urine.  The  major  urinary  metabolite  is  fenofibric  acid  ester  glucuronide.  Much 
smaller amounts of fenofibric acid and benzhydrol and his glucuronide are also found. Glucuronidation 
f fenofibric acid and reduced fenofibric acid is minor in rats and guinea pigs and is not detectable in 
o
dogs. In addition, unknown polar metabolites were detected in rats, dogs and guinea pigs but were not 
investigated further. 
Neither  fenofibrate  nor  fenofibric  acid  undergo  oxidation  via  the  cytochrome  P450  pathway  to  any 
significant  extend.  In  vivo  studies  using  human  liver  microsomes  indicate  that  fenofibrate  and 
fenofibric  acid  do  not  inhibit  cytochrome  P450  isoforms  CYP3A4,  CYP2D6,  CYP2E1,  or  CYP1A2.  They 
are weak inhibitor
s of CYP2C19 and CYP2A6 and mild to moderate inhibitors of CYP2C9 at therapeutic 
c
oncentrations. Most of fenofibric acid is glucuronidated by the UDP-glucuronosyl transferases UGT1A9 
and UGT2B7
, which make fenofibric acid more hydrophilic and biologically inactive facilitating renal and 
biliary excretion. 
Excretion 
In dogs, the total recovery of the radioactive dose of pravastatine in urine and faeces collected over 96 
hours averaged 90%. Recovery of the radioactive dose averaged 29% after intravenous injection, and 
12% after oral injection. About 18% (after IV) and 6.5% of unchanged pravastatin was recovered from 
the  urine  between  0  and  48  hours.  In  monkeys,  after  oral  dosing  of  radio-labelled  pravastatin,  most 
radioactivity  is  recovered  in  the  faeces  (84%)  and  2%  of  the  dose  is  excreted  in  the  urine.  In  rats, 
after oral dosing of r
adio-labelled pravastatin, 83-87% of the radioactivity is recovered in the faeces, 
w
ith less than 4% of the dose excreted in the urine. Pravastatin and its metabolites excreted in the bile 
undergo  enterohepatic  circulation  in  ra
ts.  The  excretion  of  fenofibrate  in  rats  was  influenced  by  the 
dosage form given.  
Pharmacokinetic drug interactions 
Fenofibrate  does  not  adversely  influence  the  metabolism  or  pharmacokinetics  of  pravastatin  and 
pharmacokinetic  literature  data  on  both  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin  as  separate  comp
ounds  or  in 
a
ssociation confirm a minimal and stable interaction between both compounds, since co-administration 
o
f fenofibrate has modest effects on pravastatin systemic exposure. Further assessment of the human 
pharmacokinetics with the drug combi
nation is provided in the clinical assessment report. 
2.3.4.  Toxicology 
Literature review characterising the pharmacokinetics of the separate compounds has been submitted. 
  addition,  three  new  studies  with  the  combination  in  rats  have  been  conducted:  an  IV  single  dose 
In
study, an oral 28-day st
udy and an oral 13-week study. This is in accordance with the Guideline on the 
non-clinical development of fixed combination of medicinal products (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005). 
Single dose toxicity  
A single dose toxicity study has been conducted in rats with the fixed dose co
mbination of fenofibrate 
and  pravastatin  administered  by  an  intravenous  route.  This  study  has  been  performed  according  to 
GLP  requirements  to  provide  data  on  the  acute  toxicity  of  combination  product  in  rats  after  a  single 
intravenous injection. The description of the study is given in the table below.

The results indicated that a mixture of 106 mg fenofibric acid and 30 mg pravastatin/kg bodyweight is 
the  maximum  tolerated  dose  in  Wistar  rats  for  which  no  mortality  and  major  toxicity  occurred  after 
intravenously administration. The non observed effect level (NOEL) has not been determined, since 3 
of  the  4  males  in  106/30  mg/kg  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin  group  showed  tail  discolourations.  
Mortality was observed at the dose of 212 mg/kg of fenofibric acid and 60 mg/kg of pravastatin. The 
maximum non-lethal dose is 106/30 mg/kg. 
Repeat dose toxicity  
No repeat-dose toxicity studies in pravastatin and in fenofibrate separately have been submitted within 
this dossier, since information about their acute toxicity has been published in the literature. However, 
two repeat-dose studies with the fixed dose combination of fenofibrate and pravastatin, studies TNO-
V5245/02  and  TNO–P8003,  have  been  performed.  Both  were  performed  in  Wistar  rats,  with  the 
duration of 28 days and 13 weeks. A summary of repeated-dose oral studies is tabulated below.

In  the  28-day  study,  liver  was  shown  to  be  the  target  organ.  Centrilobular  hypertrophy  occurred  at 
40/10 mg/kg of fenofibrate/pravastatin and at higher doses; at 240/60 mg/kg was detected increased 
ASAT in females only and increased ALP in both sexes. Muscular effects were observed at 40/10 mg/kg 
and  higher  doses,  which  was  consisted  with  mononuclear  cell  infiltrate  in  the  skeletal  muscle  and 
myositis. 
In the 13-week study, liver was also the target organ. Centrilobular hypertrophy was noted at 7.2/1.8 
mg/kg  of  fenofibrate/pravastatin  and  higher  doses  and  increased  ALP  in  males  at  12/3  mg/kg  of 
fenofibrate/pravastatin.  Effects  on  pancreas  (chronic  inflammation  and  focal  pancreatitis)  were 
observed in all dose groups but no statistical difference from controls was achieved. It should be noted 
that  higher  glucose  levels  were  observed  in  the  28-day  study  but  not  found  in  the  13-week  study. 
Submitted  toxicity  studies  with  fenofibrate  or  pravastatin  alone  did  not  reveal  such  effects  but 
pancreatitis  is  mentioned  as  an  adverse  effect  for  both  active  substances  in  the  respective  SmPCs. 
Therefore, the relation of pancreatic effects with the treatment cannot be excluded. No increase in CK 
values was reported and no effects on muscles were observed. The safety margin at the NOAEL is <1

based  on  AUC  or  Cmax  for  fenofibrate,  but  cannot  be  calculated  for  pravastatin  because  plasma 
concentrations were below the limit of quantification. 
Initially, the CHMP questioned the selection of the dose in the 13-week study, since this was based on 
human  dose  and  not  on  human  exposure.  As  a  consequence,  tested  animals  might  not  have  been 
significantly  exposed,  preventing  a  relevant  assessment  of  the  toxicity  of  this  new  combination,  in 
particular  view  of  the  new  effects  or  effects  resulting  from  potentiation  and  their  reversibility.  The 
doses  tested  in  the  13-week  study  could  have  been  too  low  based  on  the  28-day  study  where  no 
toxicity concern appeared. However, since clinicians considered that no concern regarding exposure or 
interaction between both components arises in humans, this issue was solved.  
The  CHMP  also  noted  the  findings  of  this  study  with  respect  to  the  pancreatic,  muscular,  renal  and 
hepatic effects, taking into account their relevance for humans and all available clinical data. Therefore, 
appropriate information has been captured in the SmPC of Pravafenix: warning regarding pancreatitis, 
contraindication to severe renal impairment, need of monitoring of myopathy, and other. 
Genotoxicity 
No new studies have been performed, which is acceptable according to the current guideline: The Non-
Clinical  Development  of  Fixed  Combinations  of  Medicinal  Products  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).  
There  is  no  concern  with  regard  to  genotoxic  potential  of  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin  in  this  fixed 
combination based on the provided literature references regarding genotoxicity potential for fenofibrate 
and pravastatin separately. 
Carcinogenicity 
Specific studies have not been conducted, which is acceptable according to the guideline: Guideline on 
the 
Products 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).  There  is  no  concern  regarding  carcinogenicity  potential  of 
fenofibrate and pravastatin in humans in this fixed combination.

Reproduction Toxicity 
The  absence  of  new  reproductive  and  developmental  toxicity  studies  is  acceptable  to  the  CHMP 
considering  the  well  known  profile  of  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin.  Overview  of  reproduction  studies 
published  in  the  literature  has  been  submitted.  Pravastatin  did  not  induce  adverse  effects  on 
reproduction. Fenofibrate  was embryotoxic (skeletal variations, reduced ossification) at materno-toxic 
doses.  Neonatal  deaths  were  also  observed  at  materno-toxic  doses.  The  SmPC  of  the  fenofibrate-
containing  products  states  that  prolongation  of  the  gestation  period  and  difficulties  during  delivery 
were observed at high doses.  Adequate information on these effects was also included in the SmPC of 
Pravafenix. Pravastatin is contraindicated during the pregnancy and thus, the use of Pravafenix during 
pregnancy is also contraindicated. This information is stated in the SmPC.  
Toxicokinetic data 
Toxicokinetic measurements were provided as part of the repeat dose toxicity studies and only at the 
high dose where adverse effects were observed. Therefore, no safety margin between animal exposure 
at the NOAEL and human exposure can be calculated. 
Local Tolerance 
Based  on  the  literature  review,  no  specific  concerns  for  the  local  tolerance  for  either  fenofibrate  or 
pravastatin can be identified. During the newly submitted repeat-dose toxicity studies performed with 
the combination, examination of the digestive tract did not reveal any particularity. 
Other toxicity studies 
No  other  specific  toxicity  studies  have  been  performed.  The  submitted  literature  data  on 
immunogenicity, antigenicity and excipients raised no concern. 
2.3.5.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment (ERA) is based on data from bibliographic references on fenofibrate 
and  pravastatin.  The  CHMP  raised  several  concerns  regarding  the  submitted  data  and  considered  the 
ERA as not yet acceptable. Determination of the partition coefficient octanol/water for any of the active

substances, the Predicted  No Effect Concentration (PNEC) calculation and lower values of assessment 
factors should be re-assessed.  
The  results  from  the  additional  studies  were  not  considered  required  by  the  Committee  before  the 
adoption of the positive CHMP opinion and it is confirmed that these applications comply with Article 6 
of  Regulation  726/2004  having  regard  to  the  requirements  of  Article  8(3)  (ca)  of  Directive  2001/83. 
Therefore,  a  specific  post-authorisation  follow  up  measure  has  been  agreed  to  perform  an 
environmental  risk  assessment  fully  in  accordance  with  the  Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk 
Assessment  of  Medicinal  Products  for  Human  Use  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00).  The  regards  amongst 
others  determination  of  the  adsorption/desorption  behaviour  of  the  substances,  determination  of 
bioaccumulation,  determination  of  the  ready  biodegradability,  determination  of  the  long-term  fish 
toxicity, and other tests. 
2.3.6.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
Bibliographical  references  have  been  provided  to  address  the  nonclinical  pharmacodynamics  and 
pharmacokinetics  pattern  of 
fenofibrate  and  pravastatin.  Both,  the  pharmacodynamic  and 
pharmacokinetic  profile  of  these  drugs  are  well  known  and  the  extent  and  scope  of  the  bibliographic 
documentation  provided  are  considered  appropriate.  No  new  pharmacodynamic,  safety  pharmacology 
or  pharmacokinetic  studies  have  been  performed  and  this  is  considered  acceptable.  No  new  studies 
have  been  performed  on  genotoxicity,  carcinogenicity,  reproductive  and  development  toxicity, 
antigenicity,  immunotoxicity,  dependence,  metabolites  and  impurities  toxicity,  which  is  acceptable 
according  to  the  Guideline  on  The  Non-Clinical  Development  of  Fixed  Combinations  of  Medicinal 
Products  (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/258498/2005).  There  are  no  concerns  regarding  local  tolerance, 
antigenicity,  immunotoxicity,  dependence  and  impurities  of  the  combination  of  fenofibrate  and 
pravastatin. 
The  following  toxicological  studies  focusing  on  the  examination  of  toxicity  of  fenofibrate  and 
pravastatin  combination  have  been  conducted:  single-dose  intravenous  toxicity  study  with  Fenofibric 
acid and Pravastatin in rats (TNO-V5245/01), 28 days repeat-dose oral toxicity study with fenofibrate 
and pravastatin in rats (TNO-V5245/02) and repeat-dose oral gavage sub-chronic toxicity study with a 
fixed  combination  of  a  mixture  of  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin  in  rats,  including  a  4-weeks  recovery 
period  (TNO-8003).  The  toxicity  effects  observed  in  animals  have  been  adequately  reflected  in  the 
SmPC of the fixed dose combination. 
Regarding  the  ecotoxicity  and  environmental  risk  issues,  this  assessment  is  based  on  data  from 
bibliographic  references  on  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin.  The  CHMP  requested  the  conduct  of  an 
additional Phase II environmental fate and effect analysis during the post-authorisation phase. 
2.3.7.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The  non  clinical  programme  for  Pravafenix  is  considered  appropriate  to  support  the  marketing 
authorisation application for Pravafenix, including the conduct of three toxicity studies. The submitted 
environmental risk assessment is not fully acceptable and a new ERA programme will be conducted as 
agreed in form of a specific follow up measure. 
2.4.  Clinical aspects 
2.4.1.  Introduction 
This is an application for the marketing authorisation of the fixed dose combination medicinal product 
fenofibrate/pravastatin in the frame of the centralised procedure according to Regulation (EC) No 
726/2004. The application is submitted in accordance with Article 3(2)a of the above mentioned 
regulation and with  Article 10(b) of the Directive 2001/83/EC.

line  with  the  NfG  on  fixed  dose  combination  medicinal  products  (CPMP/EWP/240/95),  the  proposed 
clinical development was performed according to the requested indication. The FDC is proposed to be 
indicated  as  second  line  therapy,  when  monotherapy  with  each  component  has  not  demonstrated 
beneficial effects on lipid parameters. 
Formal scientific advice concerning quality, preclinical and clinical development on the development of 
Pravafenix was requested from the CHMP in August 2007. An oral explanation was held in front of the 
Scientific  Advice  Working  group  on  October  2007.  Questions  on  clinical  development  were  mainly 
related to the mechanism of action of both active substances, the pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies 
to  be  performed  for  the  development  of  a  fixed  dose  combination  (including  food  effect  and  specific 
population  such  as  elderly,  and  patients  with  hepatic  and  renal  failure).  The  CHMP  recommendations 
have been only partially followed.  
In  summary,  the  conducted  clinical  development  programme  for  Pravafenix  focused  on  the 
examination of the pharmacokinetic and biopharmaceutical properties of the combination (eight clinical 
studies)  as  well  as  on  the  evaluation  of  it  efficacy  and  safety  (four  clinical  studies).  The  overall 
tabulated summary of the clinical studies is presented below. Results of these studies were supported 
by the bibliographic data for the individual compounds. 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. The applicant 
has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community were 
carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

The  Phase  III  clinical  development  programme  in  support  of  the  claimed  indication  in  patients  with 
mixed  hyperlipidaemia  included  4  main  studies  (see  table  below),  of  which  two  pivotal  studies 
performed in Europe: 
- SMB-FEBRA-0303, performed in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia and high cardiovascular risk; 
- FENOPRA-III-06-01 performed in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia. 
One  confirmatory  study  was  performed  in  the  United  States:  Sc-PRAVA-06-02.  The  fourth  study 
performed in Europe (FENOPRA-III-05-1) was mainly a 24-week open-label safety study. All phase III

Information  regarding  pharmacokinetic  properties  of  each  single  substance  by  the  use  of  scientific 
bibliographic  overview  has  been  provided.  This  is  considered  acceptable  because  the  individual 
pharmacokinetic profiles of fenofibrate and pravastatin are well established.  
Several biopharmaceutical studies were performed with the new fixed dose combination of fenofibrate 
160  mg  and  pravastatin  40  mg  (SMB-FENO-SD012,  SMB-FEPRA-SD081,  SMB-FEPRA-SD082,  SMB-
FEPRA-SD083, SMB-FEPRA-SD084, SMB-FENOPRAVA-SS031, SMB-FEPRA-SS071, SMB-FEPRA-SS072). 
Six  biopharmaceutical  studies  were  conducted  in  order  to  compare  the  new  fixed  dose  combination 
with  the  single  product  or  the  co-administration  of  the  two  reference  drug  products.  Those 
comparisons were performed at a single dose or at multiple doses and in fasting or fed state. The used 
dosage  is  160  mg  of  fenofibrate  compared  to  160  mg  fenofibrate  of  marketed  form  (LIPANTHYL  160 
mg  or  LIPIDIL-TER  160  mg  available  on  the  EU  market)  and  40  mg  pravastatin  compared  to  40  mg 
pravastatin of marketed form (PRAVASINE PROTECT, ELISOR or PRAVASINE 40 mg available on the EU 
market). Investigation of the potential for drug-drug interaction of the active components of Pravafenix 
was also conducted. Two additional bioavailability studies were also submitted for the following reasons:

to the composition of the fenofibrate 160 mg used in the fixed combination, this bioequivalence study 
is submitted as supportive in the present application. 
- 
SMB-FEPRA-SD083:  A  partner  company  performed  a  pharmaceutical  and  clinical  development  of 
the  160/40  mg  fenofibrate/pravastatin  formulation  in  the  USA.  In  order  to  bridge  the  clinical  data 
between  the  EU  and  the  US  formulation,  a  bioequivalence  study  between  the  two  formulations  has 
been performed. 
From the review of the submitted results of these clinical trials, the CHMP concluded the following:  
- Conflicting results were obtained regarding the bioequivalence (BE) of the fixed combination and the 
free co-administration of Lipanthyl 160 mg and Pravasine 40 mg. The pivotal single-dose study (SMB-
FEPRA-SS  081),  conducted  under  fed  conditions  showed  BE  of  Pravafenix  and  the  free  co-
administration  of  Lipanthyl  and  Pravasine.  However,  findings  of  study  SMB-FEPRA-SS  081  were  not 
confirmed  by  the  repeated-dose  study  SMB-FEPRA-SS  071,  also  performed  under  fed  conditions. 
Indeed,  this  study  failed  to  demonstrate  BE  with  regard  to  fenofibrate.  Lower  systemic  exposure  to 
fenofibrate  (approximately  20  %)  was  observed.  Study  SMB-FEPRA-SS  0072  performed  at  steady-
state  and  under  fasting  conditions  showed  noticeable  differences  between  the  biopharmaceutical 
performances of the fixed combination drug product (FDC) and the co-administration of Pravasine and 
Lipanthyl.  Lower  bioavailability  is  observed  with  the  FDC.  The  bioavailability  of  fenofibrate  and 
pravastatin is decreased by approximately 50% and 20 %, respectively.  Therefore, the CHMP raised a 
major  objection  and  requested  a  thorough  discussion  on  the  impact  of  these  findings  on  the 
efficacy/safety  of  Pravafenix  in  patients  switched from  the  free  co-administration  of  Pravasine  40  mg 
and Lipanthyl 160 mg to Pravafenix.  
-  The  US  Pravafenix  formulation  investigated  in  one  phase  III  efficacy/safety  clinical  trial  is 
demonstrated to be bioequivalent to the EU formulation. 
-  The  bioavailability  of  both  ingredients  of  Pravafenix  is  markedly  influenced  by  food  intake  in  a 
symmetrical  way:  Food  intake  noticeably  enhances  the  bioavailability  of  fenofibrate.  Higher  AUC t  (by 
approximately  +40  %)  and  Cmax  (approximately  +300%)  were  observed  under  fed  conditions. 
Conversely, systemic exposure to pravastatin is markedly decreased (by approximately -50%) by food 
intake.  It  is  noteworthy,  that  such  decrease  in  pravastatin  bioavailability  is  also  observed  with 
Pravasine. 
-  The  results  of  the  examination  of  the  potential  for  drug-drug  interactions  between  pravastatin  and 
fenofibrate are presented in a separate chapter. 
In response, the impact of the decrease in systemic exposure to pravastatin was thoroughly discussed. 
It  is  agreed  that  the  differences  in  systemic  exposure  observed  under  fed  conditions  would  not 
noticeably  impact  the  efficacy  of  the  statin  component.  The  much  more  pronounced  difference  in 
systemic  exposure  under  fasting  conditions  for  fenofibrate  may  plausibly  impact  the  efficacy  of  the 
fibrate  component  of  the  FDC,  however  a  clear  statement  has  been  introduced  in  the  SmPC  on  the 
inter-changeability  of  the  FDC  and  free  co-administration  of  the  monocomponent  drug  products.  The 
information regarding the intake of the drug with food was also strengthened in the SmPC. Thus, the 
CHMP considered this issue could be considered resolved. From the initially performed investigations, it 
would  appear  that  the  FDC  does  not  perform  similarly  as  the  freely  co-administered  monocomponent 
drug products (Pravasin 40 mg + Lipanthyl 160 mg). Under fasting conditions, the systemic exposure 
to fenofibrate when administered as Pravafenix is significantly lower than that observed with Lipanthyl 
(50% lower). Such difference could not be considered clinically irrelevant. Nevertheless, the warnings 
regarding  the  possibility  to  switch  the  FDC  and  the  monocomponent  drug  products  as  well  as  the 
information  regarding  the  food  intake  introduced  in  the  updated  SmPC  could  be  considered  an 
acceptable  alternative  to  manage  the  differences  in  the  biopharmaceutical  performances  mentioned 
above. 
Absorption, Distribution, Elimination  
A brief overview of the pharmacokinetic properties of pravastatine and fenofibrate is given below. 
Hydrolysis  of  fenofibrate  by  tissue  and  plasma  esterases  to  the  active  principal  metabolite  fenofibric 
acid appears to commence concomitantly with absorption. It was reported that unmodified fenofibrate 
was not detectable in the plasma of healthy volunteers. The Cmax of fenofibric acid occurs within 6 to 8 
hours after fenofibrate administration and the absorption of fenofibrate is increased when administered 
with  food.  Steady-state  plasma  concentrations  of  fenofibric  acid  are  achieved  after  5  days  and  the 
agent  does  not  accumulate  over  time  with  repeated  administration.  The  apparent  volume  of 
distribution of fenofibric acid was 0.89 L/kg in healthy subjects. Fenofibric acid is highly bound (>99%)

to  plasma  proteins.  Serum  protein  binding  (mainly  to  albumin)  exceeds  99%  and  is  concentration-
independent over the therapeutic dose range. Mean terminal phase elimination half-life values ranging 
from 19.6 to 26.6 hours have been observed following administration of single doses of fenofibrate 300 
mg  to  healthy  volunteers.  The  mean  elimination  half-life  observed  after  repeated  administration  of 
fenofibrate  300  mg  daily  was  not  significantly  different  from  that  seen  after  single.  Fenofibrate  is 
metabolised  to  a  number  of  compounds  in  humans.  The  principal  excretion  pathway  for  the 
metabolites in humans is the urinary tract. Faecal excretion also occurs to a variable extent depending 
on  the  rate  of  absorption.  Approximately  60%  of  a  dose  of  radiolabelled  fenofibrate  appears  in  the 
urine, and 25% is excreted in the faeces.  
Following  the  oral  administration,  pravastatin  is  rapidly  absorbed,  and  the  time  (tmax)  to  attain  the 
maximum  drug  serum  concentration  is  around  (1  hour).  The  absolute  bioavailability  averages  18% 
based on AUC and urinary excretion of intact pravastatin. This low systemic absolute bioavailability has 
been attributed to both, the incomplete absorption (34%) and the hepatic metabolism (first-pass effect 
with  subsequent  biliary  excretion),  when  pravastatin  is  administered  orally.  Administration  of 
pravastatin  with  food  decreases  the  bioavailability  of  the  drug  by  one-third.  However,  the  food  effect 
does  not  significantly  affect  the  lipid-lowering  activity  of  the  drug.  Further  discussion  on  the  effect  of 
food  on  pravastatin  is  given  below  in  a  separate  section.  In  healthy  volunteers,  the  volume  of 
distribution of pravastatin is 0.5L/kg at a steady state and 0.88 L/kg during the elimination phase. The 
level of protein binding of pravastatin is 43 to 54%. The binding to other cellular elements of blood is 
negligible.  The  systemic  elimination  rate  constant  of  pravastatin  is  much  higher  than  the  absorption 
rate  constant.  Because  of  the  rapid  elimination,  pravastatin  does  not  accumulate  in  plasma  after 
repeated administration. It is eliminated through both, the renal and non-renal routes, and 64% of an 
intravenous  dose  is  excreted  into  the  urine  and  faeces  as  intact  drug.  The  systemic  and  renal 
clearances are 0.810 and 0.378 L/h/kg, respectively, so that renal and non-renal routes of elimination 
account for 47% and 53%, respectively. 
Dose proportionality and time dependencies  
This is a MAA for Pravafenix - one strength (160 mg fenofibrate / 40 mg pravastatin) and therefore no 
dose proportionality is to be evaluated. 
Special populations  
No  pharmacokinetic  data  are  provided  in  patients  with  renal  insufficiency  receiving  the  fixed 
combination  or  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin  concomitantly.  The  SmPC  for  fenofibrate  (Lipanthyl  Micro 
200)  includes  a  specific  reduction  of  dose  depending  on  the  rate  of  creatinine  clearance.  Taking  into 
account  the  dose  for  fenofibrate  in  the  FDC  (160  mg)  and  the  SmPC  for  fenofibrate,  the  Pravafenix 
SmPC includes a contraindication for moderate to severe renal impairment.  
No  new  data  or  bibliographic  review  is  provided  regarding  patients  with  hepatic  impairment. 
Fenofibrate has not been studied in patients with hepatic impairment, but is contraindicated in patients 
with  severe  liver  disease.  Pravastatin  increase  its  bioavailability  in  patients  with  hepatic  disease.  The 
SmPC  for  Pravafenix  therefore  recommends  a  contraindication  in  patients  with  severe  hepatic 
impairment including biliary cirrhosis or active liver disease including unexplained persistent elevations 
in liver function tests. A special warning on management of patients with hepatobiliary disorders is also 
included. Please refer to the discussion on clinical efficacy. 
Regarding gender, the SmPC for fenofibrate states that no pharmacokinetic difference between males 
and females has been observed for fenofibrate. With respect to pravastatin, new information related to 
SLCO1B1  polymorphism  and  gender  has  been  published  recently,  but  the  impact  of  these  findings 
needs further investigations. The influence of race on the pharmacokinetics of fenofibrate has not been 
studied,  however;  fenofibrate  is  not  metabolised  by  enzymes  known  for  exhibiting  inter-ethnic 
variability. European-Americans had significantly higher plasma pravastatin AUC and C max values than 
African-Americans even when adjusted for the presence of the SLCO1B1 521C or 388G variant allele. 
However,  this  difference  did  not  suggest  clinically  relevant  differences  based  on  ethnicity.  Therefore, 
there  would  not  appear  to  be  a  requirement  to  add  any  particular  advice  in  the  Pravafenix  SmPC. 
Weight  is  not  expected  to  have  a  clinically  significant  influence  on  the  pharmacokinetic  behaviour  of 
the FDC.  
Concerning the elderly, no specific investigations have been performed in this sub-group for the FDC. 
Recommendations  regarding  the  use  of  the  fixed  combination  are  inferred  from  experience  with  the 
use  of  each  component  separately  in  the  elderly  patients.  Pravafenix  pharmacokinetics  has  not  been 
evaluated in children or adolescents.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
Fenofibrate  has  a  low  potential  for  drug-drug  interaction  since  it  does  not  undergo  a  significant 
oxidation metabolism by CYP 450 isoenzymes. Pravastatin metabolism is not mediated by the CYP450. 
Therefore, drug-drug interaction potential of the active ingredients of the FDC under review appears to 
be limited. Nevertheless, formal testing for such interaction is required. A three- arm cross-over study 
at steady state under fed conditions, study SMB-FENOPRA-SS31,  was performed for this purpose. This 
was a comparative study on the bioavailability of fenofibrate and pravastatin after multiple oral doses 
of  one  formulation  of  fenofibrate/pravastatin  160/40  mg,  one  formulation  of  fenofibrate  160  mg  and 
one  formulation  of  pravastatin  40  mg  in  36  healthy  subjects.  In  total,  37  subjects  were  randomised 
and 34 completed the study. 
The main pharmacokinetic findings for the study are summarized in the tables and figures below. 
Pravafenix 
CHMP ASSESSMENT REPORT

The findings of the study show that the systemic exposure (estimated by AUC and Cmax) to fenofibrate 
observed  with  Pravafenix  is  similar  to  that  observed  in  subjects  treated  with  Lipanthyl  alone. 
Significantly higher systemic exposure to pravastatin (30-40%) is observed with the combination when 
compared  to  the  administration  of  pravastatine  alone.  The  specific  mechanism  for  such  interaction 
between  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin  remains  unknown,  but  it  is  speculated  that  competition  with  or 
modulation of OATP1B1or P-glycoprotein may play a role. The CHMP expressed their concern regarding 
the design of study SMB-FENOPRA-SS31 due to the use of Pravafenix as a comparator in the third arm 
of  the  study.  The  differences  in  the  biopharmaceutical  performances  of  the  formulations  (Pravafenix, 
Lipanthyl,  Pravasine)  could  introduce  a  bias  in  the  estimation  of  the  interaction  potential.  A  free  co-
administration of Lipanthyl 160 mg and Pravasine 40 mg (instead of Prafavenix) in the comparator arm 
could  have  been  the  appropriate  alternative.  Furthermore,  the  conduct  of  the  study  under  fed 
conditions might also introduce a bias in the estimation of the drug-drug interaction potential as food 
intake  does  impact  noticeably  and  differently  the  bioavailability  of  pravastatin  and  fenofibrate. 
Systemic exposure to fenofibrate is enhanced by food-intake. Conversely, pravastatin bioavailability is 
noticeably  reduced  by  food-intake.  Therefore, the  outcome  of  study  SMB  FEPRA-SS-031  suggest  that 
co-administration of fenofibrate enhances moderately systemic exposure to pravastatin (30-40%). The 
CHMP requested further clarification on the results of this study and overall impact on the interactions 
between  the  monocomponents  of  this  FDC.  In  response,  further  arguments  and  results  of  supportive 
studies  SMB-FEPRA-SD081,  SMB-FEPRA-SS071,  SMB-FEPRA-SS072,  although  not  significantly 
relevant, have been presented. Considering that the FDC and monocomponent drug products perform 
differently  and  are  impacted  differently  by  food  intake,  formulation  effect  and  food  effect  are 
confounding factors precluding any strong statement regarding the interaction potential. However, it is 
acknowledged  that  the  outcome  of  the  study  SMB-FENOPRAVA-SS031,  even  with  its  limitation, 
revealed  no  marked  potential  for  interaction  between  pravastatin  and  fenofibrate.  In  addition,  this 
statement was confirmed by the published literature data. 
Pharmacokinetics using human biomaterials

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Pravastatin.  Pravastatin  sodium  is  a  3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme  A  (HMG-CoA)  reductase 
inhibitor (statin), which reduces cholesterol biosynthesis by interfering with the conversion of HMG-CoA 
to  mevalonate,  an  early  rate-limiting  step  in  cholesterol  biosynthesis.  Pravastatin  reduces  also  the 
activity of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein, a plasma glycoprotein responsible for the transfer of 
high  density  lipoprotein  cholesterol  (HDL-C)  esters  to  very  low  density  lipoprotein  (VLDL)  and  LDL  in 
the reverse cholesterol transport pathways. It has been suggested that HMG-COA reductase inhibitors 
such as pravastatin inhibit the production of LDL-C directly by inhibiting the hepatic synthesis of VLDL-
cholesterol (VLDL-C), a precursor for LDL-C. 
Fibrates  represent  one  of  the  older  classes  of  lipid-lowering  drugs  and  exert  effects  mainly  by 
activating  the  peroxisome  proliferator-activated  receptor-alpha  (PPAR-alpha).  Through  activation  of 
PPAR-alpha fenofibrate increases the lipolysis and elimination of atherogenic triglyceride-rich particles 
from plasma by activating lipoprotein lipase and reducing production of apoprotein CIII. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
No  pharmacodynamic  studies  have  been  performed  with  the  fenofibrate/pravastatin  FDC  itself  since 
the properties of the individual compounds are not expected to be different from those observed when 
both  components  are  given  together  as  a  free  combination.  The  individual  pharmacodynamic  profiles 
for  fenofibrate  and  pravastatin  are well  established.  The  discussion  of  the  pharmacodynamics  of  both 
active substances is based on the literature overview. 
The  pharmacodynamics  properties  of  each  component  support  the  interest  of  combining  pravastatin 
with  fenofibrate.  The  mechanisms  of  action  of  both  drugs  are  expected  to  be,  at  least  partly, 
complementary. With the FDC, beneficial effects on the 3 biological defects of mixed dyslipidaemia, i.e. 
increased  LDL-C  and  TG  and  decreased  HDL-C,  can  be  anticipated.  Thus,  this  combination  is  from  a 
theoretical  point  of  view  of  clinical  interest,  since  an  additional  effect  on  lipid  parameters  could  be 
expected. Nevertheless, the CHMP noted that such combination using in particular fenofibrate must be 
devoid  of  potentially  deleterious  interactions  that  could  have  an  impact  on  the  efficacy  and  safety 
profile  of  the  product.  Fenofibrate  has  a  low  potential  for  drug-drug  interaction  since  it  does  not 
undergo  a  significant  metabolism  by  cytochrome  P450.  In  addition,  pravastatin  metabolism  is  not 
mediated  by  CYP450.  Therefore,  drug-drug  interaction  potential  of  the  active  ingredients  of  the  FDC 
under  review  appears  to  be  limited.  A  complete  pharmacokinetic  programme  was  submitted  for  this 
FDC  marketing  authorisation  application.  For  further  details  please  refer  to  the  sections  on 
Pharmacokinetics and Clinical efficacy and safety.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The  individual  pharmacokinetics  for  pravastatin  and  fenofibrate  are  well  established  and  no  further 
investigations  are  considered  necessary.  Single  strength  is  claimed  for  Pravafenix  (160  mg 
fenofibrate/40  mg  pravastatin).  There  is  a  significant  reduction  in  pravastatin  pharmacokinetics  with 
food and a significant increase in fenofibrate pharmacokinetics with food. The FDC is recommended to 
be taken with food because the bioavailability of fenofibrate is increased when administered with food. 
Although the bioavailability of pravastatin is reduced when taken with food, the lipid-lowering efficacy 
is not altered, as documented in the published literature. Indeed, the harmonised SmPC of pravastatin 
allows  administration  with  or  without  food.  Recommendations  regarding  the  use  of  the  fixed 
combination  in  special  population  are  derived  from  the  experience  with  the  use  of  each  component 
separately. Dose adjustment is not necessary in the elderly patients for the actives substances of the 
FDC,  but  recommendations  before  the  initiation  of  therapy  are  provided  in  the  Pravafenix  SmPC. 
Review of the potential new interactions has not been conducted but the already identified interactions 
mentioned  in  the  SmPCs  of  pravastatin  and  fenofibrate  are  adequately  reflected  in  the  SmPC  of  the 
FDC. In summary, it can be concluded that the clinical pharmacology of the FDC has been sufficiently 
documented, and the questions related to the bioequivalence studies have been clarified.

2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The  individual  pharmacokinetics  for  pravastatin  and  fenofibrate  are  well  established  and  no  further 
comments  are  necessary.  Single  strength  is  claimed  for  the  FDC,  Pravafenix  (160  mg  fenofibrate/40 
mg pravastatin). The individual pharmacodynamics for fenofibrate and pravastatin are well established. 
The  mechanisms  of  action  of  both  drugs  are  expected  to  be,  at  least  partly,  complementary.  The 
discussion of the clinical pharmacology of both active substances is based on the results of a literature 
search.  
2.5.  Clinical efficacy 
2.5.1.  Dose response study(ies) 
No dose response study has been performed and this is justified since the efficacy for both substances 
have been well characterised for numerous years.   
Rational for the choice of pravastatin and fenofibrate dosage 
Pravafenix  is  developed  as  an  orally-administered  fixed  combination  of  pravastatin  and  fenofibrate. 
Single  strength  combination  of  40  mg  pravastatin  and  160  mg  fenofibrate  has  been  developed.  The 
product  is  intended  as  a  second-line  treatment  (in  inadequately  controlled  patients)  and  thus,  the 
statin dose should be the maximal effective and tolerated dose. It should be also highlighted that the 
only studied starting and maintenance dose was 40 mg daily for cardiovascular prevention. Thus, the 
choice  of  a  40  mg  maximal  daily  dose  of  pravastatin  and  a  fenofibrate  (160  mg)  for  the  clinical 
development is justified, and a single strength for Pravafenix is acceptable. 
2.5.2.  Main study(ies) 
The phase III clinical development programme in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia included 4 main 
studies (see table below), of which two were performed in Europe: 
Study SMB-FEBRA-0303 was performed in patients with mixed hyperlipidaemia and high cardiovascular 
risk  and  study  FENOPRA-III-06-01  was  performed  in  type  2  diabetic  patients  with  mixed 
hyperlipidaemia. One confirmatory study performed in the United States: Sc-PRAVA-06-02. The fourth 
study  performed  in  Europe,  FENOPRA-III-05-1,  was  a  24-week  open-label  safety  study.  All  phase  III 
controlled efficacy study were conducted using the final formulation.  
SMB-FEPRA-0303:  A  PHASE  III,  TWO-ARMED,  RANDOMISED,  DOUBLE-BLIND,  DOUBLE-DUMMY, 
PARALLEL  STUDY  TO  COMPARE  THE  THERAPEUTIC  EFFICACY  ON  12  WEEKS  OF  ONE  COMBINATION 
(FENOFIBRATE/PRAVASTATIN  160-40  MG)  VERSUS  PRAVASTATIN  40  MG  ALONE,  FOLLOWED  BY  AN 
OPEN-LABELLED  SAFETY  PHASE  OF  THE  COMBINATION  ALONE,  ON  52  WEEKS,  IN  HIGH  RISK 
PATIENTS WITH COMBINED HYPERLIPIDEMIA. 
This  study  was  designed  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  the  FDC  of  fenofibrate/pravastatin 
160mg/40mg in terms of non HDL-C, LDL, TG reduction from baseline and of HDL-C increase.  
FENOPRA-III-06-01: A PHASE III, FOUR-ARMED, RANDOMIZED, DOUBLE BLIND, PARALLEL STUDY TO 
COMPARE  THE  EFFICACY  AND  SAFETY  IN  TYPE  2  DIABETIC  PATIENTS  WITH  COMBINED

This  study  was  not  performed  in  the  target  population.  Indeed,  recruited  patients  were  not  at  high 
cardiovascular risk. Thus, the contribution of this study to the current application is limited.  
Studies SMB-FEPRA-0303 is considered to be the main trial for this application. Thus, the majority of 
the clinical chapters below refer to the conduct of study SMB-FEPRA-0303 and data from other studies 
are quoted when and as appropriate to support the scientific discussion.   
The overall summary of these studies is presented in the table below.

Methods 
Study Participants 
Patients enrolled in study SMB-FEPRA-0303 were: i) male and female, aged 18 years or older, ii) high 
cardiovascular  risk  patients  as  defined  by  the  NCEP  ATP  III  with  documented  mixed  dyslipidaemia 
(multiple  risk  factors  that  confer  a  10-year  risk  for  CHD  >  20%  (calculated  according  to  the 
Framingham tables) or coronary heart disease (CHD) or other clinical forms of atherosclerotic disease 
or diabetes. 
Inclusion lipid parameters: patients with LDL-C > 100mg/dL AND 150 < TG>400mg/dL at the end of 
the selection period under pravastatin 40 mg/day. 
Main exclusion criteria were: Secondary or iatrogenic dyslipidemia, hyperlipidemia type I-IIa-IV-V, TG 
>  400  mg/dl,  abnormal  liver  function  (hepatocellular  insufficiency,  chronic  or  active  liver  disease, 
sustained  elevation  of  serum  liver  enzymes  >  2  x  UNL),  CPK  >  3  x  UNL,  abnormal  renal  function 
(clearance  of  creatinine  <  50  ml/mn)  or  any  renal  disease  likely  to  lead  to  renal  dysfunctions, 
uncontrolled  primary  hypothyroidism,  acute  cardiovascular  episode  within  the  6  months  prior  to  the 
start of the trial, uncontrolled hypertension, and other criteria. 
This study comprised of the following periods:  
Selection period: 8 weeks during which the patients were stabilised on PRAVASINE 40 mg/day. 
Efficacy  phase:  12  weeks  during  which  the  patients  were  randomised  to  one  of  the  two  possible 
treatments (fenofibrate/pravastatin 160-40 mg or pravastatin 40 mg). Patients were randomised either 
to  fenofibrate/pravastatin  160/40mg  per  day  or  pravastatin  40mg  per  day  from  the  first  day  of  the 
efficacy phase (from V1 to V4 - 12 weeks). They received a capsule of placebo at the same time. 
Safety  phase:  Additional  period  of  52  weeks  under  the  combination  product  (fenofibrate/pravastatin 
160-40 mg) whichever the treatment taken during the efficacy phase.

Reference  therapy:    PRAVASINE  40  mg,  one  tablet,  taken  once  a  day,  orally,  containing  40  mg  of 
pravastatin.  
Objectives 
Study SMB-FEPRA-0303 was designed to demonstrate the superior efficacy of fenofibrate 160 mg and 
pravastatin  40  mg  FDC  (Pravafenix)  compared  with  Pravastatin  40  mg  monotherapy  in  high 
cardiovascular risk patients with mixed dyslipidemia, as measured by the mean percent change in non-
HDL-C  at  the  end  of  the  12-week  efficacy  period.    In  addition,  the  study  design  allowed  for  a 
comparison  of  safety  and  tolerability  of  fenofibrate  160  mg  and  pravastatin  40  mg  FDC  with 
pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy. The CHMP acknowledged that the objectives of this clinical study are 
deemed  appropriate  to  show  the  superiority  of  Pravafenix  over  pravastatin  in  the  claimed  target 
indication. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary and secondary endpoints of study SMB-FEPRA-0303 can be summarised as follows. 
Primary  endpoint:  Mean  percent  changes  in  plasma  non-HDL  cholesterol  levels  at  the  end  of  the 
efficacy period compared to the baseline. 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Secondary endpoints: 
 
Percentage  of  patients  who  achieve  the  therapeutic  goals  concerning  the  non-HDL  and  LDL 
levels, as defined in the NCEP ATP III 
  Evolution of the LDL levels 
  Evolution of the following other lipidemic parameters levels: HDL, TG, total cholesterol 
  Evolution of Apo A, Apo B levels 
  Evolution of C Reactive Protein (CRP) values 
  Evolution of Fibrinogen values 
  Differences in estimated cardiovascular risk for myocardial infarction (PROCAM risk calculator) 
Sample size 
Sample  size  calculation  was  done  in  order  to  demonstrate  the  superiority  of  the  combination 
fenofibrate/pravastatin  160/40  mg  vs  pravastatin  40  mg  for  the  analysis  of  the  primary  efficacy 
endpoint. As reference data on non-HDL (LDL + VLDL) cholesterol levels were not available, the worst 
case  was  adopted  by  taking  the  hypotheses  based  on  the  LDL  cholesterol  levels  for  the  effect  of  the 
combination fenofibrate/pravastatin. A difference between treatment groups in mean percent changes 
in  plasma  LDL  cholesterol  level  between  baseline  (after  8  weeks  under  pravastatin  40  mg/day)  and 
visit  V4  (W12)  of  6%  is  considered  as  clinically  meaningful  difference.  A  sample  size  of  140  patients 
(70  per  treatment  group)  allowed  for  a  statistical  power  of  at  least  90%  for  the  detection  of  a 
difference = 6% between treatment groups in mean percent changes (group 1: µ1 = - 20%, group 2: 
µ2 = - 26%), considering a standard deviation of 20 mg/dl and using a one-tailed test on the = 5% 
significance  level.  Statistical  power  obtained  for  N  =  140  patients  from  calculation  based  on  LDL 
cholesterol  level  was  a  fortiori  sufficient  considering  the  non-HDL  cholesterol  level  according  to  the 
previous argument. A calculation of the power a posteriori based on the ApoB parameter was made to 
confirm  this  argument.  In  addition,  allowing  for  a  drop-out  rate  of  about  40%  of  patients  before  the 
end  of  the  total  safety  period  (64  weeks),  a  total  of  240  patients  were  required  to  be  randomised  in 
this trial. 
Randomisation and Blinding (masking) 
The  list  of  randomisation  was  issued  using  computer  software.  Treatments  and  the  corresponding 
decoding  envelopes  were  prepared  according  to  this  list.  Treatments  were  randomised  before  being 
packaged  and  were  assigned  by  chronological  order  to  the  centres.  The  investigators  dispensed  the 
study treatments to patients according to the treatment numbers received at their centre. 
Patients  received  a  capsule  of  placebo  of  identical  properties  as  the  active  drug  at  the  same  time 
(double placebo). Thus, patients took 2 capsules at each evening meal. In order to maintain the blind 
during  the  treatment  period  for  each  patient,  lipid  parameters  obtained  from  blood  samples  from 
baseline  to  final  visit  were  kept  in  blinded  condition  until  the  database  was  closed.  Neither  the 
investigator  nor  the  sponsor  of  the  study  was  informed  during  the  study.  The  blinded  conditions  and 
the  randomisation  technique  are  considered  appropriate.  Lipid  parameters  were  also  measured  at 
randomisation in a blinded manner. 
Statistical methods 
For  the  assessment  of  the  mean  percent  change  vs  baseline  for  the  lipid  parameters,  two  different 
statistical  methods  were  used:  i)  a  mean  change  calculated  and  ii)  a  Least  Squares  Mean  (LS  Mean) 
derived  from  the  ANCOVA  test.  Intent-to-treat  (ITT)  population,  which  consisted  of  all  randomised 
patients  who  had  at  least  one  on-therapy  data  value  for  efficacy  parameters,  was  used  for  efficacy 
analyses.  Per  Protocol  (PP)  population  was  also  used.  A  two-sided  statistical  test  with  alpha  =5% 
significance level was used for primary efficacy endpoint. All other statistical tests were two-tailed and 
the level of significance was set at 0.05. The CHMP considered that the performed statistical analyses 
are appropriate. It is adequate to report changes in lipids as mean percentage change from baseline.  
Results  
Participant flow 
Overall,  480  patients  were  screened  based  on  established  inclusion  and  exclusion  criteria  in  study 
SMB-FEPRA-0303. At baseline (Week 0), 248 patients (safety population) were randomised into one of 
both  treatment  groups  of  the  efficacy  phase,  i.e.  fixed  dose  combination  fenofibrate/pravastatin 
160/40  mg  or  reference  (pravastatin  40  mg).  At  the  end  of  the  efficacy  phase  (Week  12),  all  the

Recruitment 
Study SMB-FEPRA-0303 was conducted in 41 active centers: 26 in France, 10 in Poland and 5 in 
Belgium from 23 October 2003 (first inclusion) to 27 September 2006 (last follow-up visit). 
Conduct of the study 
The first amendment of study SMB-FEPRA-0303 protocol dated August 26, 2003 was approved before 
the first inclusion of the first patient. This change referred to assuring consistency regarding the date 
of the first ECG (to be performed at V1 and not at VS). In France, 3 other amendments were written in 
order to compensate the insufficient recruitment of patients: Amendment No. 2 dated June 14, 2004: 
update  of  the  investigators  participating  in  the  study,  new  prospective  investigators  and  extension  of 
the  inclusion  period.  Amendment  No.  3  dated  August  23,  2004:  update  of  the  investigators 
participating in the study. Amendment No. 4 dated January 3, 2005: extension of the inclusion period. 
In Poland, Amendment No. 2 dated March 19, 2004 concerned the update of contact details for safety 
reporting.  No  other  amendment  was  required  in  Belgium.  The  CHMP  concluded  that  the  protocol 
amendments  do  not  appear  to  have  any  influence  on  the  validity  of  the  study  data  and  the  provided 
analysis.

The  CHMP  noted  that  the  elderly  (>  65  years  old)  represented  26.78%  of  the  included  compared  to 
73.22% for patients < 65 years old). Overall, only 36 patients older than 65 years have been treated 
with the FDC. No patient older than 75 years has been treated with the FDC. Otherwise, there was no 
major imbalance between the treatment groups.

The CHMP assessed the above described results in the following manner: 
LDL-C. After 12 weeks of treatment with Pravafenix, a significant (p < 0.001) decrease of 6% in LDL-C 
levels  in  comparison  with  baseline  was  observed  in  pravastatin  treated  patients;  this  decrease  may 
indicate that patients were probably not pravastatin failures at the time of randomisation. Results were 
not significant after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment and became significant after 12 weeks of treatment.  
HDL-C. The addition of fenofibrate 160mg to pravastatin 40mg resulted in an increase of HDL-C level 
of  +  6.5%  in  the  FDC  group  compared  to  +2%  in  the  pravastatin  group.  This  is  not  surprising  as 
pravastatin  is  not  intended  to  increase  HDL-C.  The  difference  between  the  2  groups  of  treatment  is 
significant. 
TG. The addition of fenofibrate 160mg to pravastatin 40mg resulted in a reduction of TG of -30% to a 
clinically relevant extent that was more pronounced after 4 weeks of treatment than after 12 weeks of 
treatment. In the pravastatin group, the decrease from baseline was only significant after 4 weeks of 
treatment  (-7.6%).  As  expected,  the  difference  between groups  is  statistically  significant  in  favour  of 
the FDC.  
Apo  A1.  An  increase  in  ApoA1  is  observed  in  each  treatment  group  after  12  weeks.  However,  the 
difference between groups is not statistically different but is in favour of the FDC (p=0.058). 
Ancillary analyses 
The  CHMP  acknowledged  that  post  hoc  pooled  analysis  of  SMB-FEPRA-0303  and  Sc-PRAVA-06-02 
studies  (that  used  the  same  comparator  pravastatin  40  mg)  derived  from  Integrated  Summary  of 
Efficacy  (ISE)  performed  for  the  U.S  submission  have  been  provided.  The  overall  recipient  is  707 
patients out of the short term efficacy dataset (n=996, 71%). Subgroup analyses from pooled analyses 
were performed to look for possible differences in treatment effect across groups. 
The following subgroups were analysed: 
-  Age group (<65, ≥65 and ≤75, and > 75 years); 
-  Gender (male and female); 
-  Race (Black and non-Black); 
-  Baseline LDL-C category (≥100 a <130 mg/dL; ≥130 to <160 mg/dL, and ≥160 mg/dL); 
-  Baseline TG category (<200 mg/dL; ≥200 to < 400 mg/dL; and ≥400 mg/dL); and 
-  Baseline LDL-C and TG category. 
Nevertheless, no significantly relevant information is obtained from these groups analysis.

The non-HDLc was significantly more reduced with Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg 
than with PRAVASINE 40 mg after 12 weeks (p = 0.002). This was already observed 
after 4 and 8 weeks of treatment. 
After  12  weeks,  the  LDLc  (-11.7%)  and  total  cholesterol  (-9.9%)  were  significantly 
more reduced with Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg compared with PRAVASINE 40 
mg (p=0.019 and p=0.006 respectively). 
The  TG  level  was  significantly  (p=0.001)  more  decreased  by  Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 
160-40  mg  (-22.6%)  than  with  PRAVASINE  40  mg  (-2.0%).  The  HDLc  was 
significantly  (p=0.009)  more  increased  with  Fenofibrate/Pravastatin  160-40  mg 
(+6.5%)  compared  with  PRAVASINE  40  mg  (+2.3%).  The  ratio  ApoB/ApoA1, 
fibrinogen  and  hsCRP  were  significantly  more  reduced  with  Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 
160-40 mg compared with PRAVASINE 40 mg (p<0.01). 
The percentage of patients achieving the therapeutic goals according to the NCEP ATP 
III  at  the  end  of  the  efficacy  phase  (Week  12)  was  significantly  higher  in  the 
Fenofibrate/Pravastatin  160-40  mg  group  than  in  the  PRAVASINE  40  mg  group 
(19.2% versus 7.6% ; p = 0.008).  
The 10-year CHD risk was significantly (p<0.001) more decreased after 12 weeks 
with Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg (-27.4%; p < 0.0001) compared with 
PRAVASINE 40 mg (-7.6%; p = 0.041).

The  safety  profile  evaluated  with  respect  to  the  incidence  of  AEs  and  laboratory 
values was acceptable for all treatment groups during any analysis phase. 
During  the  12-week  efficacy  phase,  the  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  in  the 
Fenofibrate/Pravastatin  160-40  mg  group  (36.6%)  compared  to  the  PRAVASINE  40 
mg  group  (32.0%).  Twenty-five  patients  (10,1%)  had  AEs  related  to  the  study 
treatment: 13 patients with  Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg and 12 patients with 
PRAVASINE  40  mg.  Headache  and  muscle  spasms  were  the  most  frequent  drug-
related  AEs.  The  proportion  of  patients  presenting  an  abnormal  laboratory  value  at

creatinine  (p  =  0.013),  creatinine  clearance  (p  =  0.044)  and  ASAT  (p  =  0.047).  No 
patient  had  an  elevation  of  ASAT  and/or  ALAT  >  3  UNL.  Two  patients  in  the 
PRAVASINE  40  mg  group  had  an  elevation  of  CPK  >  3  UNL.  Eleven  patients  (4.0%) 
were withdrawn from the study during the efficacy phase because of an AE (6 and 5

Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg group and 2 patients (3 SAEs) in the PRAVASINE 
40  mg  group.  Only  1  SAE  (muscle  pain)  was  considered  as  possibly  related  to 
Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg and led to discontinuation. In the follow-up report, 
the investigator modified the diagnosis from "muscle pain" to “rheumatic polymyalgia” 
and declared that the symptoms were probably not related to the study drug. 
(5  SAEs) 
in 
During the 52-week safety phase, 274 AEs have been reported, of which 33 (12.0%) 
were related to Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg. Back pain and hypertension were 
the  most  frequent  AEs.  Transaminase  increased,  abdominal  upper  pain  and  nausea 
were  the  most  frequent  AEs  related  to  the  combination.  Three  patients  had  an 
elevation of ASAT and/or ALAT > 3 UNL. Three patients had an elevation of CPK > 3 
UNL. Twelve patients (5.4%) experienced 19 SAEs. None of them were related to the 
study  drug  (Fenofibrate/Pravastatin  160-40  mg).  Five  patients  (2.2%)  were 
withdrawn from the study because of an AE.  
Neither myopathy nor rhabdomyolysis were reported during the study. No death was 
reported during the study. No clinically relevant differences in the laboratory values, 
vital signs, physical examination and ECG parameters were found between treatments 
during this study. The frequency of abnormal findings was comparable between 
treatments. 
Analysis description 
Overall conclusions  
The combination Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg in high risk patients with 
combined hyperlipidemia resulted in additional improvements in lipoprotein profile 
compared with PRAVASINE 40 mg monotherapy. 
The Fenofibrate/Pravastatin combination (160-40 mg per day) was well tolerated with 
a safety profile similar to PRAVASINE alone (40 mg per day). One year treatment with 
Fenofibrate/Pravastatin 160-40 mg did not raise any significant concern about the 
safety of the combination.

No clinical studies in special populations were provided. Instead of, the applicant performed a post hoc 
pooled sensitivity analysis of SMB-FEPRA-0303 and Sc-PRAVA-06-02 during double-blind phases (that 
used the same comparator pravastatin 40mg). Subgroup analyses were performed to look for possible 
differences in treatment effect across groups. Analysis according to age and gender were performed.

Comparison of efficacy results in function of age: Pooled analyses have been performed on three sub-
populations according to the age of patients i.e. < 65 years, 65 to 75 years and > 75 years. There are 
only 6 patients >75 years of age distributed among the 3 treatment groups in the double-blind cohort. 
As  a  consequence,  the  small  size  of  this  subgroup  precludes  meaningful  interpretation  of  their  lipid 
efficacy  data  and  invalidates  comparison  with  the  other  age  subgroups.  Therefore  no  summary  is 
presented  for  this  category  of  age.  The  efficacy  results  are  presented  in  table  below  as  mean 
percentage changes from baseline to week 12.

In  total,  576  patients  (81.5%)  were  younger  than  65  years  old,  125  patients  (17.7%)  were  between 
65 and 75 years old and only 6 patients (0.8%)  were older than 75 years old. The magnitude of the 
mean percent changes in non-HDL-C, LDL-C, and TG appeared to be slightly greater in the ≥65 to ≤75 
years  of  age  subgroup  than  in  the  <65  years  of  age  subgroup  for  each  treatment  group  and  in  the 
Pravafenix  arm.  For  HDL-C,  the  mean  change  is  similar  between  the  2  subgroups  of  treatments. 
However,  the  CHMP  acknowledged  the  limitation  of  such  post-hoc  pooled  analyses,  particularly  in 
terms of the power, since the number of patients in each subgroup is very limited. 
Comparison of efficacy results in function of gender: The study populations were adequately balanced 
for gender: 386 patients (54.6%) were male and 321 patients (45.4%) were female. Overall, the mean 
percent  change  in  non-HDL-C  versus  baseline  observed  with  Pravafenix  is  similar  in  men  (-9.3  + 
19.1%) and in women (-10.7 + 25.4%). The magnitude and direction of the mean percent changes in 
TG were also similar for male (-20.8 + 37.19) and female (-18.7 + 51.69) patients in the Pravafenix 
160/40 mg treatment group. However, the magnitude of the mean percent changes in LDL-C (-7.9% 
vs  -3.2%,  respectively)  and  HDL-C  (4.2%  vs  1.5%,  respectively)  appeared  to  be  greater  in  female 
than male patients in the Pravafenix 160/40 mg treatment group.

Supportive study(ies) 
Sc-PRAVA-06-02:  Multi-center,  prospective,  longitudinal, randomized,  double-blind,  phase  III  Study 
to evaluate the efficacy and safety of daily administration of Pravastatin 40mg or fenofibrate 160mg or 
Pravafen (the combination of pravastatin and fenofibrate 40/160mg) for 12 weeks, followed by a 52-
week  open-label  safety  phase  of  Pravafen  alone,  in  the  treatment  of  combined  hyperlipidemia.  The 
primary objective of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of administering either Pravastatin 40mg or 
Fenofibrate 160mg or Pravafen (the combination of Pravastatin and Fenofibrate 40/160mg) daily for 12 
weeks,  followed  by  a  Pravafen  open-label  52-week  safety  follow-up,  in  the  treatment  of  combined 
hyperlipidemia. The secondary objective was a safety comparison over 12 weeks and long-term safety 
assessment over 52 weeks. 
The results of the Efficacy Phase of the present study confirm the findings of these studies describing 
the synergistic therapeutic benefits of specific statin-fibrate combinations: Non-HDL cholesterol is more 
effectively reduced by combination Pravafen (-7.0%) than either monotherapy pravastatin (+2.8%) or 
monotherapy fenofibrate (+10.4%). LDL Cholesterol is reduced by combination therapy with Pravafen 
(-1.1%) and increased with monotherapy pravastatin (+3.8%) and fenofibrate (19.0%). Triglycerides 
are more effectively reduced by Pravafen (-19.5%) than either monotherapy pravastatin (+12.8%) or 
monotherapy fenofibrate (-13.4%). 
FENOPRA-III-05-01:  This  was  a  Phase  III,  multicenter,  open-label  study  to  evaluate  the  safety  of 
Pravafenix  160/40mg  administered  once  daily  for  24  weeks  in  high  cardiovascular  risk  patients  with 
mixed dyslipidemia. More extensive information regarding design, population, outcomes and statistical 
analysis  are  provided  in  the  different  sections  of  this  report.  The  primary  efficacy  parameter  was  the 
mean percent change in non-HDL-C from baseline (recorded at the baseline laboratory exam) to Week 
24/end  of  study.  Secondary  efficacy  parameters  included  change  from  baseline  to  Week  24/end  of 
study  in  LDL-C,  HDL-C,  TG,  TC,  Apo  A 1,  Apo  B,  Apo  B/Apo  A1,  hsCRP,  and  fibrinogen  values.  The 
results  are  in  line  with  those  obtained  in  the  main  studies.  Safety  data  from  this  study  have  been 
included in the safety database for Pravafenix.  
2.5.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
During  the  first  part  of  the  scientific  evaluation  of  the  Pravafenix  MAA  the  CHMP  considered  that  the 
submitted  data  were  not sully  supportive  to  sustain  the  benefit  of  this  FDC.  Despite  biological  effects 
observed in the submitted clinical studies, the benefit of Pravafenix assessed on lipid parameters and 
responder’s rate was uncertain. Considering the expected pattern for respective classes of these drugs, 
results have shown a more potent effect of fenofibrate on TG and HDL-C while pravastatin is superior 
in  reducing  total  cholesterol  and  LDL-C.  In  the  overall  clinical  programme,  the  combination  mainly 
showed a decrease in TG with an incremental increase in HDL-C and in some cases further reduction 
on total cholesterol and LDL-C. If significant, results on LDL-C are very limited. 
In  that  context,  publication  of  ACCORD  (Action  to  Control  Cardiovascular  Risk  in  Diabetes)  study 
results of in March 2010, which studied long term efficacy and safety use of a combination of a statin 
(simvastatin) and fenofibrate on cardiovascular endpoints, was considered essential to resolve some of 
these  issues.  Results  of  the  ACCORD  study  were  also  believed  to  be  useful  when  considering  the 
limited database presented for Pravafenix. Therefore, the CHMP requested an analysis of the results of 
ACCORD  study  in  order  to  help  solve  the  major  issues  raised  for  the  Pravafenix  dossier  before  a 
definite assessment of the benefit risk of this new fixed dose combination can be made. 
Thus, the following considerations have been evaluated during the assessment: 
  Review of the overall results of ACCORD study focusing on the effects of the addition of fenofibrate 
in patients inadequately controlled by simvastatin monotherapy as studied in this trial.  
  Analysis  of  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  atherogenic  dyslipidemia  (TG>204  mg/dL  and  HDL<34 
mg/dL,  potentially  benefiting  from  a  statin/fenofibrate  combination  according  to  results  of  the 
ACCORD  study.  Additional  new  subgroup  analysis  of  patients  with  atherogenic  dyslipidemia  in 
study SMB-FEPRA-0303 and from data published in the literature. 
 
Justification  of  the  claimed  of  equipotency  between  statins  (other  statins  doses  equivalent  to 
pravastatin 40 mg).

Expected results observed in the initial clinical dossier of Pravafenix have shown a more potent effect 
of fenofibrate on TG and HDL-C, while pravastatin is superior in reducing total cholesterol and LDL-C.  
In  the  overall  clinical  programme,  the  combination  mainly  showed  a  decrease  in  TG  with  an 
incremental increase in HDL-C and in some cases further reduction on total cholesterol and LDL-C.  
These results are in line with results obtained in the ACCORD study, in a selected population of type 2 
diabetic  patients.  In  this  subgroup,  biological  effects  of  the  addition  of  fenofibrate  to  simvastatin  are 
better  compared  to  other  included  patients.  However,  despite  biological  effects  observed  in  the 
submitted clinical studies, the benefit of Pravafenix assessed on lipid parameters, especially on LDL-C, 
and responder’s rate is somewhat limited.  
Additional subgroup post hoc analyses from the study SMB-FEPRA-0303.  
To further sustain efficacy results of Pravafenix in the originally claimed indication, two additional post 
hoc  analyses  from  clinical  study  SMB-FEPRA-0303  were  provided.  The  aim  of  both  analysis  was  to 
compare the effects of Pravafenix on lipid parameters, using the same definitions of lipid abnormalities 
as  in  the  ACCORD  study:  i)  in  patients  with  only  low  baseline  HDL-C  (<40mg/dL  for  men  and 
<50mg/dL  for  women);  ii)  and  in  patients  with  both  TG  value  >200mg/dL  and  low  HDL  value 
(<40mg/dL for men and <50mg/dL for women) at baseline.  
From the provided analysis, it was shown that the effect of Pravafenix versus pravastatin on non HDL-
C and LDL-C appears to be more pronounced in patients with low HDL at baseline than in patients with 
normal  HDL-values.  Furthermore,  this  effect  also  appears  more  pronounced  in  patients  with  high  TG 
and low HDL at baseline as defined above. However, these subgroups only concern a small number of 
patients, i.e. 70 patients (29.3%)  with only low HDL-C at baseline and 49 patients (25.7%)  who  met 
criteria for TG and HDL, and are thus limited to represent the general population. In addition, from a 
methodological  point  of  view,  as  usual  post-hoc  analyses  must  be  taken  with  cautious.  Overall,  the 
strength of evidence is limited, due to small number of patients to support an indication of Pravafenix 
in  all  dyslipidemic  patients.  Therefore,  positive  biological  effect  on  the  pravastatin/fenofibrate 
combination,  sustained  by  sufficient  data,  could  be  endorsed  only  in  patients  with  high  TG  and  low 
HDL-C.  Lastly,  post-analyses  only  showed  effects  on  lipid  parameters  but  not  on  CV  morbidity  or 
mortality  due  to  the  limited  duration  of  studies.  This  was  considered  an  importance  issue  as  patients 
with dyslipidaemia, i.e. mainly diabetics should be long term treated.  
In  order  to  identify  which  population  could  benefit  from  a  simvastatin/fenofibrate  combination  in 
reducing cardiovascular events in the ACCORD study and whether these results can be extrapolated to 
Pravafenix, the following has been taken into account: 
Main results of the ACCORD study 
In this study, 5518 patients with type 2 diabetes (mean age : 62.3 years; 30.7% women), who were 
at  high  risk  for  cardiovascular  disease  (36.5%  with  prior  CV  events)  received  either  fenofibrate  (160 
mg  or  equivalent  dose)  or  matching  placebo  in  addition  to  open  label  simvastatin  20  to  40mg.  The 
primary outcome was the first occurrence of non fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non fatal stroke, or 
death from cardiovascular causes. The mean follow-up was five years until death or the final visit that 
took  place  in  early  2009.  Eight  percent  reduction  in  the  primary  endpoint  with  combination  of 
pravastatin  and  fenofibrate  did  not  reach  statistical  significance  (p=0.32).  The  combination  of 
fenofibrate  and  simvastatin  in  diabetic  patients  inadequately  controlled  by  simvastatin  alone  did  not 
reduce  the  rate  of  fatal  cardiovascular  events,  non  fatal  MI,  or  nonfatal  stroke;  as  compared  to 
simvastatin  alone.  According  to  the  authors  themselves,  these  results  do  not  support  the  use  of 
combination  therapy  with  fenofibrate  and  simvastatin  to  reduce  cardiovascular  risk  in  the  majority  of 
high  risk  patients  with  type  2  diabetes.  Thus,  the  long  term  benefit  on  cardiovascular  events  of  the 
addition of fenofibrate to patients inadequately controlled by a statin (simvastatin) monotherapy is not 
established  on  the  basis  of  the  ACCORD  study  in  the  overall  type  2  diabetic  patients  presenting 
dyslipidaemia. 
However,  a  specific  sub-groups  analysis  identified  a  specific  population,  i.e.  patients  with 
hyperlipidaemia defined by high TG levels >204 mg/dL and low HDH values <34 mg/dL, where benefit 
on lipid parameters, but also on cardiovascular events, was observed contrary to the overall population. 
Results on the primary outcome rate were 12.4% in the fenofibrate/simvastatin group versus 7.3% in 
the simvastatin monotherapy group whereas such rates were 10.1% in both study groups for all other 
patients.

ACCORD  population:  Patients  included  in  the  ACCORD  study  were  exclusively  diabetics,  of  which  the 
majority  did  not  present  mixed  dyslipidaemia.  Less  than  20%  of  patients  had  simultaneous  high  TG 
and  low  HDL-C  levels.  Indeed,  no  minimal  TG  value  was  specified;  the  mean  baseline  TG  level  was 
162mg/dL. In addition, almost 40% of the patients included in the study were not receiving statin at 
baseline  prior  to  enrolment.  Thus,  the  ACCORD  study  population  was  quite  different  from  the 
population that was studied in the Pravafenix clinical development programme.  
Clinical  efficacy:  Regardless  of  whether  efficacy  on  lipid  parameters  is  demonstrated  in  this  study  in 
the overall population, as previously stated, it appears evident that ACCORD results on hard endpoints 
do not support the routine use of the combination therapy with fenofibrate and simvastatin in reducing 
cardiovascular  events  in  overall  high  risk  patients  with  type  2  diabetes  presenting  dyslipidaemia.  In 
addition,  a  pre-specified  subgroup  analysis  based  on  gender  identified  a  statistically  significant 
treatment-by-gender interaction (p = 0.01). The increased risk for major cardiovascular events (9%) 
for fenofibrate/simvastatin combination compared to 6% for simvastatin alone for women evaluated in 
this  study  is  of  concern.  Moreover,  results  on  the  composite  secondary  endpoint,  major  coronary 
disease  event,  non  fatal  stroke,  non  fatal  MI,  also  showed  a  tendency  to  be  increased,  although  not 
significantly. In that context, uncertainties remain about whether the overall beneficial effect is robust 
enough  to  support  an  indication  of  a  statin/fenofibrate  combination  in  patients  with  mixed 
hyperlipidaemia (defined by high TG and low HDL levels) and high CV risk, inadequately controlled by a 
statin monotherapy, based only on data from the ACCORD publication. This concern could also apply to 
the  current  Pravafenix  dossier  where,  in  addition  to  the  effects  on  lipid  parameters,  effects  on 
cardiovascular endpoints in long term use are not entirely demonstrated.  
This  concern  has  been  extensively  discussed  during  the  benefit/risks  reassessment  on  fibrates 
(including fenofibrate) through Art 31 referral procedure.  
Overall, the CHMP concluded that Pravafenix would be a beneficial treatment options for a substantial 
portion  of  patients  at  high  CV  risk,  particular  those  with  elevated  TG  and  low  HDL-C  despite  a  40mg 
pravastatin  therapy.  The  outcome  of  this  referral  evaluation  has  a  direct  impact  on  the  Pravafenix 
assessment. 
Equipotency of statins 
Regarding  the  original  claim  on  statin  equipotency,  the  CHMP  was  of  the  opinion  that  the  presented 
data  do  not  support  the  use  of  Pravafenix  following  any  type  of  statin;  only  an  indication  following 
optimal dose of pravastatin could be accepted. This is mainly due to the lower potency of pravastatin 
as  compared  to  the  more  frequently  used  statins  (i.e.  simvastatin,  atorvastatin  and  rosuvastatin). 
Moreover, as individual response is not the same as population level response, in real practice there is 
no reason for switching patients controlled by one statin to Pravafenix.  
Moreover,  several  previously  conducted  clinical  trials  have  shown  that  the  efficacy  of  statins  is  dose-
dependent.  Thus,  it  is  possible  that  in  ACCORD  trial,  simvastatin  might  not  have  used  at  the  most 
effective  dose  and  the  results  with  an  addition  of  fenofibrate  to  a  full  simvastatin  dose  are  therefore 
unknown. It remains questionable whether the results of ACCORD study in this aspect are transferable 
to  Pravafenix  and  only  the  second  line  indication  limited  to  the  use  of  pravastatin  40mg  can  be 
approvable.  
The applicant requested an Oral Explanation for the discussion of the indication and the equipotency of 
statins,  however  in  line  with  the  above  arguments,  clinical  results  and  the  outcome  of  Article  31 
referral  on  fibrates  concluded  during  the  assessment  of  Pravafenix,  the  following  indication  has  been 
considered approvable by the CHMP: 
“Pravafenix  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  high  CHD-risk  adult  patients  with  mixed  dyslipidaemia 
characterised  by  high  triglycerides  and  low  HDL-cholesterol levels  whose  LDL-C  levels  are  adequately 
controlled while on a treatment with pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy.” 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
An  Oral  Explanation  on  the  discussion  of  the  indication  of  Pravafenix  and  the  equipotency  of  statins 
was conducted, however, in line with the above arguments, clinical results and the outcome of Article 
31 referral on fibrates finalised during the assessment of Pravafenix, the following indication has been 
considered approvable by the CHMP: 
“Pravafenix  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  high  CHD-risk  adult  patients  with  mixed  dyslipidaemia 
characterised  by  high  triglycerides  and  low  HDL-cholesterol levels  whose  LDL-C  levels  are  adequately 
controlled while on a treatment with pravastatin 40 mg monotherapy.”

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Safety  data  were  derived  from  four  phase  III  clinical  trials.  Three  of  them  were  double-blind 
randomised studies. 
Study SMB-FEPRA-0303 compared the efficacy on 12 weeks of fenofibrate/pravastatin 160/40 mg FDC, 
versus  pravastatin  40  mg  in  high  CHD  risk  patients  with  mixed  hyperlipidemia  (n=248  patients 
included in the safety analysis). After this 12-week efficacy phase, all patients received FDC during an 
open safety phase of 52 additional weeks (n=224 patients included in the safety analysis). 
Study FENOPRA-III-06-1 compared the efficacy on 12 weeks of FDC versus simvastatin 20 mg (with or 
without open-label administration of ezetimibe) in type 2 diabetic patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, 
at  high  CHD  risk  (n=291  patients  included  in  the  safety  analysis)  or  very  high  CHD  risk  (n=272 
patients included in the safety analysis ). After this 12-week efficacy phase, all patients received FDC 
with or without ezetimibe during an open safety phase of 12 additional weeks (n=537 patients included 
in the safety analysis, of which 281 were in the high CHD risk and 256 in the very high CHD risk).  
Study  Sc-PRAVA-06-02  compared  the  efficacy  of  12  week  treatment  with  FDC  versus  pravastatin  40 
mg  versus  fenofibrate  160  mg  in  patients  with  mixed  hyperlipidemia  (n=563  patients  included  in  the 
safety  analysis;  240  patients  in  FDC,  113  in  pravastatin,  122  in  fenofibrate).  After  this  12  week 
efficacy phase, all patients received FDC during an open safety phase of 52 additional weeks (n=386). 
FENOPRA-III-05-1 was an open label study and focused on safety aspect of FDC in high or very high 
CHD  risk  patients  with  mixed  hyperlipidemia  treated  for  24  weeks  (n=342  patients  included  in  the 
safety analysis). 
Patient exposure 
Patients  analysed  in  the  pooled  analysis  are  patients  from  the  safety  populations  of  each  of  the 
individual studies; i.e. randomised patients who took at least one dose of the study drug. Data from 
these patients were pooled in two different analysis cohorts: 
- 
- 
The  "double-blind  cohort”  including  all  patients  from  the  12-week  double-blind  phases  of 
studies  SMB-FEPRA-0303,  Sc-PRAVA-06-02,  FENOPRA-III-06-1  to  compare  the  extent  of 
safety issues for the combination versus a statin monotherapy (pravastatin 40 mg in the SMB-
FEPRA-0303  and  Sc-PRAVA-06-02  studies  or  simvastatin  20  mg  in  the  FENOPRA-III-06-1 
study) and fenofibrate 160 mg (in the Sc-PRAVA-06-02 study). 
The "all studies cohort” combining the data from the 4 phase III trials: SMB-FEPRA-0303, Sc-
PRAVA-06-02, FENOPRA-III-06-1 and FENOPRA III-05-1. This analysis was conducted over the 
entire  study  period  (from  week  0  until  the  end  of  the  study,  when  patients  are  treated  with 
Pravafenix  160/40  mg).  Thus,  this  database  includes  all  patients  having  taken  at  least  one 
dose  of  Pravafenix  at  any  time  during  any  phase  III  clinical  trial.  This  database  allows  an 
assessment of the long-term safety profile of Pravafenix. 
The  summary  of  patient  exposure  from  these  analyses  is  given  in  the  tables  below.  A  total  of  1566 
patient were exposed to at least one dose of Pravafenix, 928 patients were exposed for 24 weeks and 
395 patients were exposed for 1 year. These patient exposures can be considered acceptable for safety 
evaluation.

Adverse events  
Double-blind safety cohort 
The  below  table  provides  an  overview  of  adverse  events  for  the  double-blind  cohort.  In  total,  453 
(35.23%)  patients  had  a  Treatment  Emergent  Adverse  Event  (TEAE).  Across  the  treatment  groups, 
the  percentage  of  patients  with  a  TEAE  in  the  double-blind  cohort  was  of  35.97%  for  Pravafenix, 
28.71%  for  statin  and  59.02%  for  fenofibrate  group.  In  total,  151  (11.74%)  patients  had  a  drug-
related TEAE. Across the treatment groups, the percentage of patients with a drug-related TEAE was 
12.25%,  8.86%  and  21.31%  for  Pravafenix,  statin  and  fenofibrate  group,  respectively.  Across  all 
treatment groups, most TEAEs and drug-related TEAEs were considered mild or moderate in intensity.

patients  had  an  SAE  during  the  double-blind  period:  11  (1.71%)  patients  in  Pravafenix  group,  4 
(0.77%)  in  the  statin  group  and  none  in  the  fenofibrate  group.  Three  patients  had  SAEs  that  were 
considered to be related to the study medication, all in the Pravafenix group: polymyalgia rheumatica 
(SMB-FEPRA-0303),  abdominal  pain  and  cholecystectomy  (Sc-PRAVA-06-02)  and  gastrointestinal 
haemorrhage and anaemia (FENOPRA-III-06-1).  
Discontinuation:  In  total,  53  (4.12%)  patients  discontinued  the  study  during  the  double-blind  period 
due  to  an  AE.  The  Pravafenix  group  (33  patients,  5.12%)  had  a  higher  percentage  of  patients  who 
discontinued  from  the  study  due  to  an  adverse  event  compared  to  the  statin  group  (14  patients, 
2.70%).  Nineteen  patients  (2.95%)  in  the  Pravafenix  and  9  patients  (1.73%)  in  the  statin  group 
discontinued the study due to a drug-related AE.

Most frequent AEs: The numbers of patients with for the most frequent TEAEs by system organ class, 
preferred  term  (1%  in  any  treatment  group)  and  related  to  the  treatment  are  summarised  in  the 
following  tables.  Overall,  the  most  common  TEAEs  experienced  by  patients  occurred  in  the  system 
organ classes of musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders, gastrointestinal disorders, infections 
and infestations and investigations. The most frequent AEs observed with Pravafenix were arthralgia, 
nausea and  cough. In the statin group, the most  common adverse  events  were diarrhoea, headache 
and  back  pain;  and  in  the  fenofibrate  group,  these  were  nasopharyngitis,  pain  in  extremity  and 
headache.  The  incidence  of  those  adverse  events  was  generally  low  and  no  significant  difference  in 
frequency  was  observed  between  the  fixed  dose  combination  group  and  the  monotherapies.  No  new 
adverse events were identified for any of the treatments.

Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
Fatal outcome was reported in 3 patients, of which two were in the FDC group (Sc PRAVA 06-02 and 
FENOPRA  III-05-1)  and  one  in  simvastatin+ezetimibe  group  (FENOPRA  III-06-1).  All  patients  have 
been diagnosed with a cancer and died after study discontinuation. The cause of death was related to 
cancer in two cases and to acute coronary syndrome in one case. 
Serious adverse events other than death 
Efficacy phase: Serious adverse events (SAEs) were reported in statins (0.8%) and FDC (1.7%) groups. 
No SAE was reported in fenofibrate group. Only some SAEs were considered related to the treatment 
and  were  reported  in  the  FDC  group:  polymyalgia  rheumatica,  abdominal  pain  and  cholecystectomy 
due to cholelithiasis, gastrointestinal haemorrhage with subsequent anaemia.  
Safety  phase:  More  patients  experienced  SAEs  during  the  safety  phase  when  compared  with  the 
efficacy phase (3.6% vs 1.7%), of which none was related to the treatment.  
Observed SAEs were mostly related to cardiac events (myocardial infarction, coronary arterial disease, 
arrhythmia,  cardiac  failure),  mainly  in  high  CV  risk  patients,  to  neoplasms  (breast  cancer,  bronchial 
carcinoma, lymphoma, lung neoplasm, ovarian cancer, prostate cancer, melanoma) and to surgical and 
medical procedures. All these SAEs were unrelated to study drug. 
Acute  pancreatitis  was  reported  in  two  patients  and  was  considered  unrelated  to  treatment.  In  one 
case,  the  event  led  to  patient’s  discontinuation.  In  the  other  case,  the  patient  recovered  without 
discontinuation  of  the  study  drug.  Two  other  cases  of  pancreatitis  have  been  reported  but  were 
considered as non serious. 
Pulmonary  embolism  was  reported  in  two  patients  and  was  considered  unrelated.  In  one  case,  the 
study  drug  was  temporarily  discontinued  and  the  patient  recovered.  In  the  other  case,  the  patient 
Pravafenix 
CHMP ASSESSMENT REPORT 
EMA/333119/2011

presented  a  pulmonary  embolism  secondary  to  deep  venous  thrombosis  after  patella  fracture  and 
incompletely recovered without modification of the treatment. Two TIA and one stroke were also noted 
during this period; all were considered unrelated.  
Laboratory findings 
Creatine phosphokinase (CPK) 
Efficacy  phase:  Overall,  increase  of  CPK  was  reported  in  all  studies  and  in  all  treatment  groups.  This 
increase  varied  between  22%  and  40%.  The  mean  observed  CPK  increase  was  higher  in  the  statin 
group  (+26%)  than  in  the  FDC  (+10.6%)  and  fenofibrate  group  (+15%).  The  majority  of  patients 
experienced  increase  of  CPK  (<5UNL).  Only  few  patients  reported  CPK  between  3-5UNL  in  all 
treatment  groups:  1.6%  in  FDC,  1%  in  statins  and  0.8%  in  fenofibrate.  Only  three  patients  in  statin 
group (0.6%) and 2 in fenofibrate (1.6%) experienced CPK increase between 5-10 UNL. No muscular 
symptoms  were  associated  with  the  increase  of  CPK  except  in  one  patient  in  statin  group  who 
experienced an increase over 10UNL associated with muscular symptom.  
Safety  phase:  The  increase  of  CPK  was  more  frequently  reported  during  the  safety  phase, 
approximately 40% of patients had an increase <5UNL. In one study, the increase of CPK was reported 
in  additional  20%  of  patients.  As  in  efficacy  phase,  the  percentage  of  patients  with  increased  CPK 
between 3-5 UNL remains stable. A total of 0.4% of patients experienced increased CPK 5-10 UNL vs 
none during the efficacy phase.  
Alanine aminotransferase/Aspartate aminotransferase (ALT/AST) 
Efficacy  phase:  Increase  of  AST/ALT  was  reported  in  all  treatment  groups  and  was  more  frequent  in 
the  FDC  group.  This  increase  varied  between  20%  and  40%.  The  majority  of  patients  experienced 
moderate  increase  of  AST/ALT  (≤3UNL).  However  no  separate  data  was  provided  for  ALT  and  AST 
increase  except  for  one  study,  although  increased  ALT  is  more  indicative  of  hepatic  toxicity  (if  AST 
increase is noted, data regarding alkaline phosphatase and conjugated bilirubin should be provided in 
order  to  attribute  the  AST  increase  to  liver  damage).  These  data  were  provided  only  for  one  study 
(FENOPRA  III-06-1).  The  increase  of  ALT  and  AST  between  3-5  UNL  was  similar  in  FDC  and  statin 
groups and was reported in only one patient each (0.16% and 0.19% respectively) and in two patients 
in fenofibrate group (1.64%). Two patients experienced both increase of ALT and AST>5 UNL with the 
FDC and one patient reported increase AST >5 UNL in the statins group.  
Safety phase: The increase of AST and ALT was reported for approximately 20 to 40% of patients and 
the majority of patients experienced moderate increase <3UNL.  The increase of ALT between 3-5UNL 
was  slightly  more  frequent  than  in  the  efficacy  phase  (0.6%  vs  0.16%  respectively).  Similar  finding 
was  reported  for  increase  ALT  >5UNL  (0.3%  vs  0.16%  respectively).  The  increase  of  AST  levels 
between 3-5 UNL was similar to the efficacy phase as was the increase of AST levels >5UNL. 
Blood Creatinine clearance (CrCl) and creatinine  
Efficacy phase: The provided data are to be interpreted with caution since the proposed stratification is 
not in line with the Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) classification. The frequency 
of  patients  with  a  ClCr<60  ml/min  increased  in  FDC  (from  4.5%  at  baseline  to  10.7%)  and  in 
fenofibrate (from 0.8% to 2.5%) groups. This was not observed in the statin group (4.4% to 3.5%).  
Safety  phase:  The  frequency  of  patients  in  FDC  group  with  a  ClCr<60  ml/min  was  similar  to  the 
frequency  observed  during  the  efficacy  phase  (10%  vs  10.7%).  The  frequency  of  creatininemia  >20 
mg/l increased to 1.1% during the safety period versus 0.5% during the efficacy period. 
Homocysteine  
Homocysteine  levels  were  only  collected  in  the  four  arm  of  study  FENOPRA-III-06-1.  During  the 
efficacy  period,  homocysteine  level  remained  unchanged  in  simvastatin  group,  associated  or  not  with 
ezetimibe,  but  a  statistical  significant  increase  was  reported  in  the  FDC  group.  The  between  groups 
difference  was  statistically  significant  in  both  strata.  Statistically  significant  increases  were  also 
reported during the safety period in both strata (25.0±51.2% in the high CV risk and 20.6±41.6% in 
the very high CV risk).

There  were  no  clinical  meaningful  changes  in  diastolic,  systolic  blood  pressure  or  heart  rate  in  any 
group  during  the  whole  study.  Additionally,  no  clinical  relevant  change  in  body  weight  was  noted  in 
FDC  or  statin  groups  (data  not  available  for  fenofibrate)  during  the  efficacy  phase  and  under  FDC 
during the safety phase. 
Safety in special populations 
Subgroup analysis in the different individual studies was not performed. However, subgroup analyses 
were  performed  on  pooled  data  of  patients  receiving  at  least  one  dose  of  Pravafenix.  Following 
analyses were conducted:  
-  Diabetic patients (55% of the global population),  
-  Age: <65 years (77.6%), 65 to 75 years (19.8%) and >75 years (2.6%),  
-  Gender: 55.5% male, 44.5% female, 
-  BMI: 18-25 kg/m2 (7.5%), 25-30 kg/m2 (39.4%) and >30 kg/m2 (53%), 
-  Renal  status:  clearance  <60  ml/min  (6%),  between  60-75  ml/min  (14.4%)  and  >75  ml/min 
(79.6%).  
No specific adverse event appeared to be significantly increased in these different subgroups compared 
to the global population. Nevertheless, more cases of creatinine clearance <60 ml/min were observed 
in older patients (6.3% in patients <65 years, 36.1% in patients between 65-75 years and 65.9% in 
patients  >75  years)  and  in  female  patients  compared  to  male  patients  (19.7% vs  9.1%).  It  is  to  be 
taken  into  account  that  the  number  of  patients  >75  years  was  limited  (n=41,  2.6%  of  the  global 
population)  and  in  the  affected  subgroups,  patients  >75  years  and  female  patients,  the  mean 
creatinine clearance levels for these patients were already lower at inclusion in the study, compared to 
other  subgroups.  In  addition,  more  cases  of  renal  insufficiency  and  decreased  CrCl  <60  ml/min  were 
reported  as  AEs  in  the  CrCl  subgroup  <60  ml/min  (7.5%  and  5.4%  respectively)  and  in  the  CrCl 
subgroup between 60-75 ml/min (none and 6.7% respectively) than in the CrCl subgroup >75 ml/min 
(2.7%) during FDC exposure. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No  new  information  has  been  provided.  The  wording  on  the  interactions  for  the  different 
monocomponents of the FDC are adequately implemented in the SmPC. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
As previously discussed, 38 AEs led to the withdrawal of 31 patients (9.1%) during the study period. 
Twenty-six  of  the  38  AEs,  were  related  to  study  drug.  The  most  frequent  SOCs  were:  Investigations 
(2.3%), Gastrointestinal disorders (2.0%), Musculoskeletal and connective tissue disorders (1.8%) and 
Renal and urinary disorders (1.5%).  
Post marketing experience 
There is no postmarketing experience with this product since it has not been marketed yet. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Safety  profiles  of  fenofibrate  and  statin  are  well  defined.  The  data  analysed  in  the  marketing 
authorisation  application  for  Pravafenix  were  derived  from  literature  research,  published  clinical  trials 
on  statin/fibrate  combination  use  and  on  the  conducted  four  clinical  studies.  These  take  into  account 
more than 1500 patients who received the FDC: a total of 1566 patient were exposed to at least one 
dose of Pravafenix, 928 patients were exposed for 24 weeks and 395 patients were exposed for 1 year. 
Patient exposures can be considered as acceptable.  
Similar  safety  profile  was  observed  in  both,  the  statin  and  FDC  group.  The  most  frequently  reported 
AEs were related to muscle and musculoskeletal disorders (muscle and articular pain), gastrointestinal 
Pravafenix

disorders (abdominal pain and transit abnormalities), and investigations (increased hepatic and muscle 
enzyme levels).  
Increase of CPK and transaminases was reported in all treatment groups during the efficacy and safety 
phases.  The  majority  of  patients  experienced  an  increase  <3  UNL.    However  the  increase  of  CK  was 
slightly  more  frequent  during  the  safety  phase  with  approximately  40%  of  patients  who  had  an 
increase  ≤3  UNL.  Less  than  2%  of  patients  reported  moderate  increase  (>3-5  UNL)  of  CK  and  less 
than  1%  reported  severe increase  (>5  UNL).  Similarly, less  than  1%  of  patients  reported  increase  of 
ALT >3 UNL. Thorough and regular monitoring of CK levels prior to and during the therapy is therefore 
advised in the SmPC of Pravafenix. 
Homocysteine blood control has been performed in study FENOPRA III-06-1. This showed a statistically 
significant  increase  in  levels  especially  in  the  FDC  group  in  high  and  very  high  cardiovascular  risk 
patients.  This  increase  is  correlated  to  the  decrease  of  the  clearance  of  creatinine  and  is  reversible 
after drug withdrawal. The CHMP considered that the homocysteine increase could be of concern as the 
proposed indication of the fixed dose combination of pravastatin and fenofibrate is intended to be used 
in  patients  with  mixed  dyslipidemia  and  at  high  cardiovascular  risk.  This  finding  was  observed  in  the 
FIELD  study  and  confirmed  in  the  ACCORD  study,  and  could  be  important  in  patients  with  moderate 
renal  failure  compared  to  those  with  mild  renal  failure  or  normal  renal  function.  However,  no 
conclusion can be drawn up to now regarding a possible link between increased homocysteine and the 
cardiovascular  risk.  Additionally,  increased  homocysteine  is  correlated  to  the  decrease  of  creatinine 
clearance  which  is  also  a  concern  related  to  fenofibrate  use.  This  issue  will  remain  under  close 
monitoring.  Pravafenix  is  contraindicated  in  patients  with  severe  and  moderate  renal  impairment  and 
regular monitoring of renal function is recommended, as per the SmPC. 
Eight  cases  of  neoplasm  (breast  cancer,  bronchial  carcinoma,  lymphoma,  2  lung  neoplasm,  ovarian 
cancer,  prostate  cancer,  and  melanoma)  have  been  reported  during  the  safety  phase  in  patients 
receiving FDC therapy. All cases were considered unrelated to treatment. Safety review of statins and 
risk  of  cancer  following  the  publication  of  the  PROSPER  study  in  2002  was  conducted.  Although  it 
showed  higher  incidence  of  new  cancer  diagnoses  in  patients  on  pravastatin  vs  placebo,  the 
assessment of available data does not change the positive benefit-risk profile of a statin. The available 
clinical  data  are  reassuring  and  provide  no  evidence  for  an  increased  risk  of  cancer  in  the  general 
patient  population  treated  with  a  statin  for  up  to  5  years,  although  no  conclusive  data  are  available 
concerning  effect  of  statins  on  cancer  risk  in  the  elderly  (≥  70  years).  However,  monitoring  of 
neoplasm  cases  in  clinical  trials  and  during  post-marketing  use  in  patients  treated  with  statins  in 
general is recommended.  
The  CHMP  requested  a  description  of  cases  of  myopathy,  myositis  and  rhabdomyolysis  and  hepatitis 
reported  in  ACCORD  study.  It  was  concluded  that  based  on  these  results,  and  the  results  from  the 
studies conducted with Pravafenix, no safety concern was identified for the muscle or hepatic disorders. 
This,  however,  is  to  be  expected  especially  when  considering  the  low  number  of  patients  exposed  to 
FDC in at least one year. No rhabdomyolysis was reported and only one patient experienced increased 
CPK  >10  UNL  associated  to  muscle  disorders  in  pravastatin  group.  Nevertheless,  acknowledging  that 
rhabdomyolysis is an acute and potentially fatal condition of skeletal muscle, which may develop at any 
time during treatment and that it is known that the risk of muscle toxicity is increased when a fibrate 
and  a  HMG-CoA  reductase  inhibitor  are  administered  together,  myopathy  must  be  considered  in  any 
patient presenting with unexplained muscle symptoms such as pain or tenderness, muscle weakness, 
or  muscle  cramps.  In  such  cases  CK  levels  should  be  measured.  The  potential  benefit/risk  ratio  of 
Pravafenix should be closely assessed before treatment initiation and patients should be monitored for 
any signs of muscle toxicity, as stated in the SmPC for Pravafenix. 
Given  that  only  35%  of  patients  (532)  in  FDC  treatment  group  were  exposed  during  52  weeks,  and 
less  than  10%  were  exposed  to  FDC  during  64  weeks  (148),  no  accurate  conclusion  can  be  drawn 
regarding long term safety data of FDC. No data was also available regarding the elderly, patients with 
renal and hepatic impairment. Pravafenix is contraindicated in patients with moderate to severe renal 
impairment, as mentioned earlier. 
The  combination  of  both  therapies  with  similar  identified  safety  concerns  (i.e.  muscle  disorders, 
increased  hepatic  and  muscle  enzymes,  pancreatic,  interstitial  fibrosis)  could  probably  lead  to  a 
demonstration  of  these  adverse  events.  Therefore,  the  CHMP  requested  conduct  of  two  post-
authorisation studies that will contribute to a better definition of Pravafenix safety profile.

From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials and post-marketing use of 
fenofibrate with statins have been included in the Summary of Product Characteristics. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
As  expected,  some  of  the  AEs  observed  with  Pravafenix  are  more  pronounced  than  those  for  the 
monotherapies, however, no new or significant safety concern has been identified taking into account 
the clinical studies conducted with the FDC and the results of the published investigations including the 
ACCORD  study.  The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  related  to  study  drug  were  renal  and  urinary 
disorders,  which  included  decreased  levels  of  renal  creatinine,  increases  transaminases  and 
musculoskeletal  disorders,  all  of  them  expected  according  to  the  SmPC  of  both  actives  substances  in 
monotherapy.  The  safety  profile  of  Pravafenix  is  adequately  reflected  in  the  SmPC  of  this  medicinal 
product. 
2.7.  Pharmacovigilance  
Detailed description of the Pharmacovigilance system 
The  CHMP  considered  that  the  Pharmacovigilance  system  as  described  by  the  applicant  fulfils  the 
legislative  requirements.  In  addition,  the  CHMP  considers  that  it  is  necessary  to  conduct  a 
pharmacovigilance  inspection  before  end  of  2011,  in  order  to  verify  the  accuracy  and  the  successful 
implementation of the corrective actions following a recent pharmacovigilance inspection performed in 
2010.

2.8.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits 
Statins  are  the  first  line  treatment  in  the  management  of  dyslipidaemia.  Pravastatin  is  a  statin  of 
middle potency that has shown to be effective in cardiovascular prevention in a wide range population. 
The main mechanism of action of statins in CV prevention is their effect on lipid levels, mainly on LDL-
cholesterol.  
The effect of lipid lowering agents, especially of statins, on LDL-cholesterol is accepted as a validated 
surrogate  for  the  evaluation  of  CV  prevention.  Whether  this  surrogacy  value  can  be  extrapolated  to 
drugs other than statins could be further discussed.  
Fibrates have been shown to have a modest effect on LDL, but quite a marked effect on TG and HDL- 
cholesterol.  Outcome  studies  conducted  with  the  different  fibrates  have  shown  inconsistent  results  in 
terms of outcome, and, in some cases, possibly worrying results in overall mortality.  
This issue was extensively discussed during Article 31 Referral on fibrates and the CHMP provided its 
final  opinion  which  results  in  a  newly  accepted  indication  for  fibrates:  “Mixed  hyperlipidaemia  in 
patients  at  high  CV  risk  in  addition  to  a  statin  when  TG  and  HDL  cholesterol  are  not  adequately 
controlled”.

Beneficial effects 
Effects on lipid parameters. As expected, results observed in the initial Pravafenix clinical dossier have 
shown a more potent effect of fenofibrate on TG and HDL-C, while pravastatin is superior in reducing 
total cholesterol and LDL-C.  
Indeed,  the  co-administration  of  statin  and  fibrates  has  a  role  in  patient  treatment  with  insufficient 
response to statins, and in this particular case, to pravastatin. This is recognised in clinical guidelines 
and omitting this option would leave a substantial portion of patients at high CV risk, particular those 
with  elevated  TG  and/or  low  HDL  despite  full-dosed  statin  therapy,  with  a  very  limited  treatment 
options. 
In  the  overall  clinical  programme,  the  combination  showed  mainly  a  decrease  in  TG  levels  with  an 
incremental increase in HDL-C levels and in some cases further reduction in total cholesterol and LDL-C 
levels.  There results are in line with results obtained in the ACCORD study in a selected population of 
type 2 diabetic patients.  
Effects  on  lipid  parameters  in  a  specific  subgroup  of  dyslipidaemic  patients.  Only  benefit  on  lipid 
parameters was effectively demonstrated in the subgroup of patients with mixed dyslipidaemia defined 
as TG >204mg/dl AND HDL-C <34mg/dL levels. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
Uncertainties  of  cardiovascular  events  in  overall  dyslipidaemic  patients  including  women:  This  issue 
was extensively discussed during Article 31 Referral on fibrates and the CHMP provided its final opinion 
which results in a newly accepted indication for fenofibrate: Mixed hyperlipidaemia in patients at high 
CV risk in addition to a statin when TG and HDL cholesterol are not adequately. 
Uncertainties  on  the  equipotency  of  statins:  The  CHMP  does  not  support  the  statin  equipotency  as 
originally  claimed  by  the  applicant.  The  potency  of  pravastatin  as  compared  to  other  statins  is  lower 
and  the  individual  response  of  a  patient  cannot  be  generalised  to  the  whole  population.  In  clinical 
practice, there is no reason for switching patients controlled by one statin to Pravafenix. Therefore, the 
indication is to be limited to pravastatin 40mg and to patients that are sufficiently controlled for their 
LDL-C  levels.  Indeed,  this  is  of  particular  importance  because  treatment  with  pravastatin  is  not  as 
potent as other statins in reducing LDL-C.  
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
The long term safety data regarding the comparison of simvastatine alone to simvastatine/fenofibrate 
was  provided  in  the  ACOORD  study.  No  safety  signal  regarding  cholelithiasis,  pancreatic, 
thromboembolic  events  was  identified  during  this  study.  However,  no  firm  conclusion  can  be  drawn 
regarding the long term use of the fixed dose combination of fenofibrate/statin regarding the increased 
risk of renal failure, muscle disorders, hepatitis, cholelithiasis and pancreatitis. Furthermore, it should 
be noted that in 16% of patients in the ACCORD study, the dose of fenofibrate has been reduced due 
to  a  decrease  of  renal  glomerular  filtration.  The  increased  level  of  homocysteine  as  described  in  the 
FIELD study has also been confirmed in the ACCORD study.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
No  new  safety  profile  can  be  identified  based  on  the  use  of  the  fixed  dose  combination  of 
fenofibrate/statin as the ACCORD study was insufficiently powered.

The  recently  published  ACCORD  study  does  not  appear  to  support  the  extensive  use  of  a 
fenofibrate/simvastatin  combination  therapy  to  reduce  cardiovascular  events  in  the  majority  of 
dyslipidaemic  high  CV  risk  patients  with  type  2  diabetic  patients.  Indeed,  only  beneficial  effects  on 
cardiovascular endpoints were observed in patients with high TG and low HDL-C values. This has also 
been  extensively  discussed  during  Article  31  referral  on  fenofibrate.  Thus,  finally,  only  an  indication 
that will be limited to this specific population subgroup can be granted by the CHMP.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Based  on  the  provided  data,  benefits  on  lipid  parameters  (surrogate  endpoints)  were  effectively 
demonstrated  in  the  subgroup  of  patients  with  mixed  dyslipidaemia  defined  by  TG  >204mg/dl  and 
HDL-C  <34mg/dL  levels. Results  are  however  insufficient  to  recommend  an  extensive  use  in  patients 
with  high  TG  or  low  HDH-C  levels  as  originally  claimed.  Nevertheless,  the  importance  whether  these 
biological effects could translate into benefits on cardiovascular endpoints was considered by the CHMP 
during  the  first  step  of  the  Pravafenix  procedure  in  the  context  of  the  long  term  use  of  the 
statin/fenofibrate  combination.  After  reviewing  data  from  the  ACCORD  study,  it  would  appear  that 
there is a detrimental effect of the long term use of a statin/fenofibrate combination on women. This 
gender issue has been extensively discussed during referral on fibrates. Overall, the biological benefit 
expressed 
the 
pravastatin/fenofibrate combination.  
the  newly  worded  and  approved 
indication  can  be 
recognised 
for 
in 
2.8.1.  Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Based  on  the  provided  data  and  the  rationale  above,  Pravafenix  is  aimed  to  offer  an  alternative  to  a 
specifically  targeted  population;  i.e.  high  CHD-risk  adult  patients  with  mixed  dyslipidaemia 
characterised by high TG and low HDL-C whose LDL-C are adequately controlled while on a treatment 
with pravastatin 40mg monotherapy. 
Overall, the biological effect expressed in the newly worded and approved indication can be recognised 
for the pravastatin/fenofibrate combination. 
Risk management plan 
Risk management plan 
A risk management plan was submitted. The CHMP, having considered the data submitted, was of the 
opinion that:  
- Pharmacovigilance activities in addition to the use of routine pharmacovigilance were needed to 
investigate further some of the safety concerns. 
- No additional risk minimisation activities were required beyond those included in the product 
information. 
2.9.  Recommendation 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered by consensus 
that the risk-benefit balance of Pravafenix in the treatment of high coronary heart disease (CHD) -risk 
adult  patients  with  mixed  dyslipidaemia  characterised  by  high  triglycerides  and  low  HDL-cholesterol 
levels  whose  LDL-C  levels  are  adequately  controlled  while  on  a  treatment  with  pravastatin  40 mg 
monotherapy was favourable and therefore recommended the granting of the marketing authorisation.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Ixekizumab is an immunoglobulin G subclass 4 monoclonal antibody that binds IL-17A, a key 
proinflammatory cytokine in the pathophysiology of plaque Ps, psoriatic arthritis (PsA), and axSpA. 
Animal studies established the role of IL-17 signalling in ankylosing enthesitis and bone remodelling 
and prophylactic administration of anti-IL-17 antibodies blocked the development of ankylosis in 
spontaneous ankylosis mouse model. Compelling scientific information to date suggests an important 
role of the IL-17 pathway in the pathogenesis of axSpA by driving inflammation leading to erosive 
bone damage and pathological new bone formation In patients with axSpA, increased numbers of 
IL-17A-producing cells are present in the peripheral blood, as well as elevated levels of IL-17 in the 
serum and synovium Neutralisation of IL-17A has been shown to inhibit the aforementioned 
pathological cellular events, as well as mitigate disease activity in patients with axSpA The 
demonstration of increased IL-17-producing Th17 lymphocyte numbers and serum IL-17 levels in 
axSpA is consistent with a direct role of Th17 lymphocytes in this disease. Interleukin-17 secreting 
cells have also been detected in situ in the bone marrow of facet joints obtained from patients with 
axSpA. 
Taltz was first approved in Europe on 25 April 2016 for the treatment of adults with 
moderate-to-severe plaque Ps. An extension of indication was approved on 18 January 2018 for 
ixekizumab alone or in combination with methotrexate to include the treatment of active psoriatic 
arthritis in adult patients who have responded inadequately to, or who are intolerant to one or more 
disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) therapies. 
The submitted Type II variation application was for a proposed new indication and associated posology 
as follows: 
Ixekizumab is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active axial spondyloarthritis, 
comprising: 
Radiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis: Adult patients with active radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. 
Nonradiographic Axial Spondyloarthritis: Adult patients with active non-radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis with objective signs of inflammation. 
The recommended dose is 80 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks. 
To support this variation, the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab in axSpA were assessed in 3 pivotal, 
randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, Phase III studies (RHBV, RHBW, RHBX).  Each study 
included separate patient populations to address the efficacy and safety profile in bDMARD-naive 
patients with r-axSpA (RHBV), TNF-inhibitor-experienced patients with r-axSpA (RHBW) and bDMARD-
naive patients with nr-axSpA (RHBX). 
The ixekizumab clinical development programme for axSpA was informed by scientific advice from the 
Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/339078/2011) and the CHMP 
Guideline on clinical investigation for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, CPMP/EWP/4891/03).

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
2.2.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Ixekizumab is a monoclonal antibody and is consequently classified as a protein. According to the 
Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment on Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), amino acids, peptides and proteins are exempted because they are 
unlikely to result in significant risk to the environment. Consequently, no Environmental Risk 
Assessment for ustekinumab is required. The CHMP considered this acceptable 
2.2.2.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by 
the CHMP. 
Ixekizumab is not expected to pose a risk to the environment. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant has conducted 3 pivotal studies in 960 adult patients with axial spondyloarthritis: 2 
studies in patients with radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA) (RHBV and RHBW) and 1 study 
in patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA) (RHBX). 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the MAH. 
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the community 
were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC.

Abbreviations:  ADA = adalimumab; ASAS40 response = a ≥40% improvement and an absolute improvement from 
baseline of ≥2 units (range 0 to 10) in ≥3 of 4 domains (Patient Global, Spinal Pain, Function, and Inflammation) 
without any worsening in the remaining domain; bDMARD = biologic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug; 
ITT = intent to treat; IXE = ixekizumab; N = number of patients in ITT population; nr-axSpA = nonradiographic 
axial spondyloarthritis; PBO = placebo; Q2W = every 2 weeks; Q4W = every 4 weeks; r-axSpA = radiographic 
axSpA; TNFi = tumour necrosis factor inhibitor. 
a  At Week 16, patients on PBO were re-randomised at a 1:1 ratio to IXE 80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W, with a 
160-mg starting dose.  Patients remained on IXE Q2W or IXE Q4W until Week 52. 
b  At Week 16, patients on ADA were re-randomised (1:1 ratio) to IXE 80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W with an 80-mg 
starting dose.  Patients underwent a 6-week washout period prior to receiving ixekizumab at Week 20.  
Adalimumab was included as an active reference group.  Study RHBV was not powered to test equivalence or 
noninferiority of IXE versus ADA.  Patients remained on IXE Q2W or IXE Q4W until Week 52. 
c  TNFi-experienced patients are those who have had prior treatment with 1 to 2 TNFi and discontinued at least 
1 TNFi due to intolerance or, in the opinion of the investigator, an inadequate response following at least 
12 weeks of treatment. 
d  Beginning at Week 16 and up to Week 44, any patient could be identified by the investigator as an inadequate 
responder.  At such time, changes in background therapy and/or transition to biologic rescue therapy (ixekizumab 
80 mg Q2W) could be made while remaining blinded to the original randomisation treatment assignment. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The objectives of the clinical pharmacology programme supporting this application for axSpA are as 
follows:  
• 
• 
characterize ixekizumab pharmacokinetics (PK) in patients with r-axSpA and nr-axSpA and 
determine if the PK are consistent with the PK in patients with Ps and PsA   
evaluate the exposure-response relationship in patients with r-axSpA and nr-axSpA on efficacy 
(Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society [ASAS] endpoints of ASAS20 [an 
improvement of at least 20%] and ASAS40 [an improvement of at least 40%]) and on select 
adverse events of special interest (AESI)  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 10/183 
 
  
 
 
 
• 
• 
determine the incidence of antidrug antibodies (ADAs), including neutralizing antibodies 
(NAbs), characterize the ADA kinetics, evaluate the relationship between immunogenicity and 
PK, and summarize the impact of immunogenicity on the efficacy and safety of ixekizumab  
support the commercial dosing regimen justification for patients with r-axSpA and nr-axSpA 
through population PK and exposure-response analyses of data from the Phase3 r-axSpA and 
nr-axSpA studies. 
Analytical method  
•  ELISA for the determination of ixekizumab concentration. 
Serum samples collected in clinical studies were analysed for ixekizumab concentrations using a 
validated enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay method. The method was validated at ALTA Analytical 
Laboratory (subsequently renamed Intertek Pharmaceutical Services), San Diego, CA, and then (prior 
to the axial spondyloarthritis clinical studies) the method was transferred, redeveloped and validated 
at ICON Laboratory Services, Inc., Whitesboro, NY. Details on the Intertek validation were provided in 
the application for psoriasis (Ps). A summary of the ICON validation is provided in the current 
submission.   
The methods used to quantify ixekizumab in axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) in support of this 
application are listed in Table 2.  A summary of method validation is provided in Table 3. .

Table 3: Clinical Method Validation Data 
Following validation of the assay at ICON, a cross-validation experiment was performed in which 
samples were prepared at Intertek Laboratory Services, Inc. and were assayed at ICON Laboratory 
Services, Inc. The acceptance criteria required at least 67% of samples within ±30% incurred sample 
re-analysis. Between ICON and Intertek, at least 91% of the samples met the acceptance criteria.   
•  Anti-Drug Antibody Assay 
Immunogenicity samples were evaluated using a 4-tiered approach described in the regulatory 
application for psoriasis (Figure 1. ).

All samples were assessed in Tier 1 (screening). A fixed cut point approach was found to have 
acceptable assay precision. The negative control (NC) and low positive control (LPC) remained 
consistent in their Tier 1 signal (Figure 2. ). The stability of the NC and LPC, which closely bracket the 
cut point, demonstrate minimal plate-to- plate variability and supports the adequacy of a fixed cut 
point. 
Figure 2.  Tier 1 signals of negative control and low positive control in Studies RHBV, RHBW, and 
RHBX. 
Serum samples are added to an ELISA plate coated with ixekizumab allowing ADAs to bind. ADAs are 
then eluted by acid treatment. On a second ELISA plate, samples are allowed to bind and are detected 
using a biotin-labeled ixekizumab and HRP-labelled streptavidin and enzyme substrate. 
Those samples screened in Tier 1, which produce an optical density (OD) greater / above the axSpA-
specific assay cut point were assessed in Tier 2 (confirmation).  
The base method assay format was also used in Tier 2 testing (confirmation) with a slight modification 
involving addition of excess non-labeled ixekizumab at the biotinylated ixekizumab step. This 
modification was utilized to confirm the specificity of presumed ADA identified during Tier 1 screening. 
If samples were confirmed as specific to the therapeutic in Tier 2, they were reported as “detected.”  
All samples below the assay cut point in Tier 1 or not confirmed in Tier 2 were reported as “not 
detected.” All samples that were confirmed in Tier 2 were further evaluated in Tier 3 (titer 
assessment) and Tier 4 (NAb assay).   
The ADA screening assay has not changed from its original format, and a series of confirmatory 
validations were performed to further strengthen the overall validation package (Table 4. ).

Assay 
The current application contains validation report addendum 4, all other reports have been included in 
the Ps application.   
Screening Cut point was determined to be 0.172 OD using 219 (225 minus 6 outliers) baseline AxSpA 
patient samples. A 5% false positive rate was applied. The Ps cut-point of 0.169 was applied as the 
difference between the two cut-points was not found to be statistically significant (Figure 3. and Figure 
4. ).

difference (red vertical line) falls within the confidence interval so we conclude that the two 
disease specific cut point estimates are not statistically significantly different (p>0.05). 
Tier 3 (Titration) of the ADA approach outlined in Figure 1. was evaluated. The ability to dilute a 
positive sample to a level which falls below the AxSpA assay cut point by titration was studied using 
the low positive control which was run at five additional dilutions with the titre at the 1:10 dilution 
(Table 5).

The assay detects NAb by direct competition between the binding of the therapeutic target (IL-17) and 
binding of ADA at the active site of ixekizumab using a MesoScale Discovery® (MSD) platform. Serum 
samples containing ADA and free drug are incubated on a streptavidin plate coated with biotinylated 
ixekizumab, allowing ADA to bind. ADAs are eluted off the plate and transferred to a streptavidin plate 
that has been coated with biotinylated ixekizumab, allowing for ADA to bind. The plate is then 
challenged with ruthenium-labeled target protein (Ru-IL-17). Excitation of the Ru-IL-17 results in a 
measurable electrochemiluminescence (ECL) signal. 
If the Ru-IL-17 is unable to bind to the ixekizumab on the plate because active binding sites are 
occupied by ADA, the ECL signal is decreased. To identify this decrease in signal, a percent inhibition 
value is calculated by comparing the patient sample with a non-ADA containing matrix control. Any 
patient sample that demonstrates an inhibition (knockdown of assay signal) greater than the assay 
inhibition threshold (cut point) is considered positive for NAb. A neutralizing assay cut point for was 
established for the AxSpA disease-state population. 70 AxSpA baseline serum samples were utilized. 
For each sample, two analytical runs were performed by two analysts. 6 analytical outliers were 
removed (Figure 5. ). No biological outliers were identified.

The axial spondyloarthritis NAb cut point was estimated to be 13.1% inhibition for a 1% false positive 
rate (Figure 6. ).

With the updated cut-point, sensitivity was determined to be 121.97 ng/mL using anti- Ixekizumab 
polyclonal antibody affinity purified from hyper-immune monkey sera (Figure 7. ). This is more 
sensitive than for Ps (253.4 ng/ml).  
Figure 7.  Sensitivity Graph. From the mean of 3 assays. The interpolation of the cut point (13.1%) 
from the curve yielded a sensitivity of 121.97 ng/mL. 
Assay drug tolerance was evaluated using the updated cut-point. The highest concentration of 
ixekizumab the NAb assay can tolerate yet detect anti- ixekizumab positive samples was proven to be 
1.55 μg/mL (for the detection of 5.0 μg/mL affinity-purified, hyper-immune monkey serum (AP-
HIMS)) (Figure 8. ).

Population pharmacokinetic analysis 
The MAH submitted two population pharmacokinetic reports (Protocols I1F-MC-RHBV and I1F-MC-
RHBW, Date 9 oct 2018; Protocol I1F-MC-RHBX, Date 17 Jul 2019). The models will be referred to as 
rad-axSpA (patients with radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, studies RHBV and RHBW) model and nr-
axSpA (patients with nonradiographic axial spondyloarthritis, study RHBX) model.  
The base population PK model in both reports was based on the final population PK models in patients 
with psoriasis (Ps) and Ps/psoriatic arthritis (PsA), i.e. the nr-axSpA and r-axSpA PK model was 
structurally similar to the Ps and Ps/PsA models. The existing base PK model is a 2-compartment 
linear model with first-order absorption. As part of the parameter re-estimation procedure, the same 
covariates that were retained in the final Ps and Ps/PsA PK models were evaluated (i.e., weight on 
clearance and volume terms, ADA titer and NAb status on clearance, and site of injection on 
bioavailability) and only retained in the base PK model if the effects remained significant. The 
additional covariate effects that were significant only in the r-axSpA or nr-axSpA PK model were 
tested in the second stage of this analysis.  
Several covariates were listed in the analysis plan to be tested; however, if there were insufficient 
patients in any of the subgroups to support the evaluation, they were not tested. The covariates 
bodyweight, injection site, ADA titer, concomitant corticosteroid use, concomitant NSAIDs, 
concomitant cDMARD use, race, baseline disease activity (BASDAI or ASDAS), disease duration and

baseline hs-CRP level were assessed. In addition, screening MRI/hs-CRP status was assessed for nr-
axSpA (study RHBX) and prior TNFi use and study (TNFi-experienced versus bDMARD-naïve) were 
assessed for rad-axSpA (studies RHBV and RHBW). In both the nr-axSpA and r-axSpA model, only 
concomitant use of the cDMARD, hydroxychloroquine, was not tested individually as only 0.0476% 
and 0.266% of patients in the PK dataset were taking it, respectively. 
Study RHBV and RHBW (Rad-axSpA) Population pharmacokinetic model 
The population PK dataset included data from 376 patients (Table 6 ). Median age and weight were 
43 years and 77.0 kg and the majority of patients were male (79.3%) and white (72.6%). Regarding 
concomitant medication, 82.2% had NSAIDs, 22.6% had COX-2 inhibitors, 10.4% had oral 
corticosteroids, 30.9% had all cDMARDs, 22.1% had Sulfasalazine, 9.0% had Methotrexate and 0.3% 
had Hydroxylchloroquine.  
Table 6: Pharmacokinetic Analysis Data 
The effect of a patient being bDMARD-naive (Study RHBV) versus TNFi-experienced (Study RHBW) 
was evaluated on clearance through inclusion of a study effect. In the final model, ADA (titer), weight 
and baseline hs-CRP, study effect were the covariates retained in the model (Table 7).  
For the population PK analysis of data in patients with r-axSpA in Studies RHBV and RHBW combined, 
the effect of fixing the exponents to 0.75 for CL terms and 1 for V terms has subsequently been 
conducted, and there was an increase in the objective function value of 15 points compared with the 
model where exponents were estimated and an increase in interindividual variability (IIV) of V3 from 
33.1% to 37.0%. Therefore, the model with estimated exponents seems most appropriate. When the 
post hoc PK parameter estimates from the models with estimated and fixed exponents were compared 
there was essentially no difference in individual CL parameters between the 2 models and a small 
difference in the total volume of distribution (Vd) estimates. In the final population PK model in 
patients with radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA) using data from Studies RHBV and RHBW, 
shrinkage was 4.53% for clearance (CL) and 36.4% for volume of distribution of the peripheral 
compartment (V3).

Study RHBX (Nr-AxSpA) population PK model 
A total of 2105 post-dose concentrations from 257 patients were available up to and including Week 
52 in Study RHBX. Of the total 2105 PK observations, 6 (0.285%) were below the quantifiable lower 
limit of the PK assay and were excluded from the population PK analysis. Therefore, there were a total 
of 2099 post-dose samples, approximately 8 samples per patient on average, available for the 
population PK analysis. The following concomitant medications were used: NSAIDs (89.1% of patients 
were taking them including COX-2 inhibitors), oral corticosteroids (14.8%), and cDMARDs 
(sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and hydroxychloroquine) evaluated as a single group (40.5%) and 
sulfasalazine (24.9%) and methotrexate (16.3%). 
Ixekizumab concentration-time data are summarized over 2 time periods: 
1. 
from Week 0 to 16, during which no changes were permitted to the study treatment (placebo 
or ixekizumab) 
2. 
from Week 0 to 52, which includes the period from Week 16 to 44 when patients could be 
switched to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W rescue treatment and therefore their treatment may have 
changed over time. To summarize the PK data by treatment group meaningfully over the full 
52 weeks of the study, the change in ixekizumab dose or change from placebo to ixekizumab 
needs to be taken into account. 
The effects of body weight on clearance terms and ADA titer on clearance were the covariates retained 
in the nr-axSpA base model. Once the base structural model was established, potentially significant 
covariates were evaluated using the SCM procedure. No additional covariates were significant. There 
was no change from the final base model, therefore it is considered the final model (Table 8 ,Figure 
10. ).

For the population PK analysis of data in patients with nr-axSpA in Study RHBX, the effect of fixing the 
exponents to 0.75 for CL terms and 1 for V terms has subsequently been conducted, and there was an 
increase in the objective function value of 10 points compared with the model where an exponent on 
CL terms was estimated and an increase in IIV of V3 from 87.3% to 89.8%. Therefore, the model with 
estimated exponents on CL only seems most appropriate. When the post hoc PK parameter estimates 
from the models with estimated and fixed exponents were compared, there was essentially no 
difference in individual CL parameters between the 2 models and a small difference in the Vd 
estimates.For Study RHBX, shrinkage from the final model was 3.69% for CL and 22.1% for V3.

2.3.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Mechanism of action 
Ixekizumab is an IgG4 monoclonal antibody that binds with high affinity (< 3 pM) and specificity to 
interleukin 17A (both IL-17A and IL-17A/F). Elevated concentrations of IL-17A have been implicated in 
the pathogenesis of psoriasis as well as in the pathogenesis of psoriatic arthritis. Ixekizumab does not 
bind to ligands IL-17B, IL-17C, IL-17D, IL-17E or IL-17F. The pharmacological class for ixekizumab is 
‘interleukin-17A antagonist’. Interleukin-17A, a member of the IL-17 family, is produced mainly by 
inflammatory Th17 cells, a subset of T helper cells, but also by other T cells, neutrophils, and mast 
cells. 
Primary and secondary pharmacology 
In patients with axSpA, increased numbers of IL-17A-producing cells are present in the peripheral 
blood, as well as elevated levels of IL-17 in the serum and synovium. Neutralisation of IL-17A has 
been shown to inhibit the pathological cellular events, as well as mitigate disease activity in patients 
with axSpA. The demonstration of increased IL-17-producing Th17 lymphocyte numbers and serum 
IL-17 levels in axSpA is consistent with a direct role of Th17 lymphocytes in this disease. Interleukin-
17 secreting cells have also been detected in situ in the bone marrow of facet joints obtained from 
patients with axSpA. 
2.3.4.  PK/PD modelling 
Analyses of exposure-response relationships were conducted using both exploratory graphical 
approaches and model-based approaches. Post hoc PK parameters from the final population PK model 
were merged with dosing records and ASAS20/40 data to carry out sequential PK/PD modelling.

2.3.4.1.  Exposure-efficacy 
The primary efficacy endpoint, ASAS40, was measured at Week 16, and also week 52 in study RHBX. 
The secondary efficacy endpoint ASAS20 was also measured at the same time points as ASAS40.  
The ASAS20/40 Week 16 static time point logistic regression model was used to explore the potential 
relationship between ixekizumab trough concentration (Ctrough) and ASAS20/40 responses at Week 
16. Patients were required to have an ASAS20 and/or ASAS40 response recorded at Week 16 and a 
Week 16 Ctrough as a measure of their steady-state drug exposure. All covariate effects were tested 
on baseline disease parameter (B1) and drug effect (DRUG) in the ASAS20/40 Week 16 static time 
point PK/PD model (except starting dose for the nr-axSPA model), which was tested only on the drug 
effect. 
Efficacy data were also evaluated using the time-course model. This model describes the temporal 
profile of the ASAS20/40 responses and uses all data at all time points of the study, thus observed 
data were used rather than non-responder imputation (NRI) for ASAS20/40 response. Covariate 
effects were tested on B1, EFF, and PLA in the ASAS20/40 time-course PK/PD model. 
Stepwise covariate modelling was used to evaluate covariates. The covariates bodyweight, age, 
gender, race, baseline disease activity (BASDAI or ASDAS), baseline hs-CRP, disease duration, 
baseline HLA B27 status, concomitant corticosteroid use, concomitant NSAIDs, concomitant cDMARD 
use and starting dose were tested. In addition screening MRI/hs-CRP status was assessed for nr-
axSpA (study RHBX) and ADA titer and study (TNFi-experienced versus bDMARD-naive) were assessed 
for rad-axSpA (studies RHBV and RHBW). Neutralizing antibody status was not tested in either model 
due to the low incidence reported. 
ASAS20/40 Week 16 Static Time Point Model  
The range of exposures obtained in this study supported use of a simple slope model as follows: 
EFF=SLP* LOGe(CMIN+1)  
LGE1 = B1 + EFF 
LGE2 = B1 - B2 + EFF 
Where EFF represents drug effect (Slope model); CMIN is the Ctrough at Week 16; LGE1 and LGE2 are 
the logits for DV≥1 (ASAS20/40) and DV≥2 (ASAS40) respectively; and B1 and B2 correspond to the 
Assessment report

baseline disease activity (in this model, this is a combination of baseline and placebo effects) used for 
the calculation of the logits for DV≥1 (ASAS20/40) and DV≥2 (ASAS40). 
•  Studies RHBV and RHBW (rad-axSpA) 
The final data set contained 312 patients on ixekizumab and 180 patients on placebo. 
The effect of study (bDMARD-naive versus TNFi-experienced) was evaluated in the base model and 
found to be significant and, therefore, it was incorporated in the selected base model in order to avoid 
biases in the quantification of the drug effect. The effect of study was best described by including an 
additive parameter on B1 for study RHBV in the bDMARD-naive population.  
After forward inclusion and backward elimination using the SCM procedure in PsN, the only additional 
covariate that was significant and retained in the ASAS20/40 Week 16 static time point model was age 
on B1, indicating that older patients have higher disease activity at baseline compared to younger 
patients, best described using a linear relationship.

•  Studies RHBX (nr-axSpA) 
The ASAS20/40 Week 16 time point analysis dataset included 280 patients who received ixekizumab 
(N=181) or who received placebo (N=99) in Period 2. 
After forward inclusion and backward elimination using the SCM procedure in PsN, the only additional 
covariate that was significant in the ASAS20/40 Week 16 static time point model was age on SLP, 
however, the standard error of the SLP-Age effect was found to be very high (81.8%RSE), indicating 
poor precision in estimation of the parameter and therefore the age effect on SLP was removed from 
the final model. Therefore, the base model is also the final model.

The drug effect was found to be best described by a slope function using log-transformed drug 
concentrations predicted by the population PK model as the exposure input. The effect of study 
(bDMARD-naïve versus TNFi-experienced) was evaluated in the base model on the baseline disease 
activity parameter, B1, and found to be significant. After forward inclusion and backward elimination 
from the SCM procedure in PsN, the covariate effects that were retained in the final ASAS20/40 time-
course PK/PD model were age and study/population on B1 (the baseline disease effect) and baseline 
hs-CRP and gender on SLP (the drug effect parameter).

Simulations were conducted to evaluate the impact of age, baseline hs-CRP, gender and baseline

population. The data were divided into 2 categories based on being lower or higher than the median of 
each covariate of the patients in the PK/PD dataset. Younger patients had consistently higher rates of 
response over the 16-week period compared to older patients. The slopes of the response rates were 
similar for each age group which is consistent with the higher disease activity observed at baseline in 
older patients compared with younger patients and a lack of an effect of age on the drug effect

parameter. Although patients with lower baseline hs-CRP levels achieved lower levels of ASAS20/40 
response at Week 16 compared with patients with higher baseline hs-CRP levels, the rates of 
ASAS20/40 response were similar for each sub-group over the 16-week treatment period as shown by 
similar slopes over time. This suggests the covariate had a small overall impact on the drug effect. 
Although female patients achieved lower levels of ASAS20/40 response by Week 16 compared with 
males, they achieved ASAS20/40 responses at broadly similar rates over the 16-week period 
compared with male patients indicating that the covariate had a small overall impact on the drug 
effect. With regard to baseline bodyweight, there was an overlap in predicted response rates between 
higher and lower weight patients indicating the effect of weight on PK did not translate into an impact 
on ASAS20/40 response rates. The lack of effect of body weight was consistent across dosing 
regimens and in both patient populations. 
•  Study RHBX (nr-axSpA) 
The drug effect was found to be best described by a slope function using log-transformed drug 
concentrations predicted by the population PK model as the exposure input. The dataset used in the 
ASAS20/40 time-course PK/PD model included all observed ASAS20/40 response data up to and 
including Week 52. The dataset consisted of data from 301 patients who received ixekizumab from 
Week 0 (N=198) or who received placebo from Week 0 (N=103). Individual post hoc PK parameters 
from the final PK model were used as the exposure input for this model. 
After forward inclusion and backward elimination from the SCM procedure in PsN, the only covariate 
effect that was retained in the final ASAS20/40 time-course PK/PD model was age on B1 (the baseline 
disease effect).

Simulations were conducted with the final ASAS20/40 time-course PK/PD model to determine the 
impact of ixekizumab dosing regimen frequency and starting dose on the probability of a patient 
achieving an ASAS20/40 response at Week 16. Model-predicted CIs for ASAS20 and ASAS40 response 
rates over 16 weeks of treatment overlapped substantially between the Q4W and Q2W dosing 
regimens (Figure 17. ), with the median response rate being numerically higher for the 80 mg Q2W 
regimen compared to the 80 mg Q4W regimen (approximately 6% at Week 16 predicted from the 
time course model). The substantial overlap in predicted responses suggests that the 2 dosing 
regimens have similar efficacy.  The impact of the 160 mg versus the 80 mg starting dose on 
ASAS20/40 response rates in both the 80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W dosing regimen groups was 
evaluated. There was substantial overlap in the CIs of the predicted ASAS20/40 response rates 
irrespective of the starting dose administered at Week 0 (Figure 18. ).

Age at baseline was identified as a significant covariate on the baseline disease activity parameter, B1, 
whereby older patients had higher disease activity at baseline. The data were divided into 2 categories 
based on being lower or higher than the median age (40 years) of the patients in the PK/PD dataset. 
The response rates increased in parallel for the younger and older patients. This suggests that the 
effect of age was a consequence of differential disease activity at baseline and not due to a drug 
effect, since age was not a significant covariate on the drug effect parameter in the model. 
Simulations show that there is no apparent benefit of increasing the dosing frequency based on age. 
Baseline body weight was identified as a significant covariate on clearance terms in the PK model 
where higher body weight was associated with higher CL resulting in lower ixekizumab serum 
concentrations. The data were divided into 2 categories based on being lower or higher than the 
median baseline weight (76.4 kg) of the patients in the PK/PD dataset. There was substantial overlap 
in predicted response rates between patients with higher and lower weight, indicating that the effect 
of weight on PK did not translate into an impact on ASAS20/40 response rates. 
2.3.4.2.  Exposure-safety 
The exposure-safety analysis included data from patients (r-axSPA and nr-axSPA) receiving 
ixekizumab or placebo up to and including Week 16. Data were included in the analyses if patients had 
Ctrough measurements at Week 16 and for patients who reported TEAEs or AESIs in the first 16 
weeks of treatment. For patients who received placebo who completed to Week 16, Week 16 
concentrations were set to zero for plotting. 
•  Studies RHBV and RHBW (rad-axSpA) 
Ixekizumab serum concentrations used in the present analyses were observed Ctrough values from 
patients at Week 16 (N=181 ixekizumab patients). To summarize safety AEs, Ctrough values were 
divided into quartiles and the median (range) for each quartile was calculated.  
An exposure-response relationship was observed for injection site reaction (ISRs). There were higher 
incidences of infections (all types) reported with ixekizumab in the 2 upper ixekizumab Ctrough 
quartiles compared to placebo and the 2 lower ixekizumab Ctrough quartiles.

Ixekizumab serum concentrations used in the present analyses were observed Ctrough values from 
patients at Week 16 (N=181 ixekizumab patients). Patients were included if their Week 16 
concentration met the trough definition. To summarize safety AEs, Ctrough values were divided into 
quartiles and the median (range) for each quartile was calculated. Data beyond Week 16 were not 
evaluated for study RHBX due to the large proportion of patients who were deemed inadequate 
responders and assigned to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W rescue treatment between Weeks 16 and 44 of 
the study. The change in treatment or dose confounds the assessment of the relationship with 
concentrations during this period and thus the analysis could not be performed. In study RHBX (nr-
axSPA), a total of 144 patients (47.7% of total randomized patients) were assigned to ixekizumab 80 
mg Q2W rescue treatment (41.2%, 41.7%, and 59.6% in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, ixekizumab 80 
mg Q4W and placebo groups, respectively).  
An exposure-response relationship was observed for injection site reaction (ISRs). There were higher 
incidences of infections (all types) reported with ixekizumab in the 2 upper ixekizumab Ctrough 
quartiles compared to placebo and the 2 lower ixekizumab Ctrough quartiles. For other infection AESIs 
(Candida, herpes, staphylococcal, or SAEs), incidence rates were low (n=0 to 8 patients per term) and 
no relationship with Ctrough values could be conducted. There was no relationship observed with 
ixekizumab trough concentrations for the few (N=4 on ixekizumab and N=2 on placebo in this 
dataset) reports of allergic reactions/hypersensitivity events that were non-anaphylactic in nature. The 
remaining AESIs were all reported with low or no incidence in the exposure-safety analysis dataset 
and thus there were insufficient data to allow an evaluation of the relationship to ixekizumab Ctrough 
values.

2.3.5.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Analytical Method 
Ixekizumab is an IgG4 mAb that binds with high affinity (<3 pM) and specificity to IL-17A, a 
proinflammatory cytokine. Because of the immunogenic potential for ixekizumab, patients in all 
ixekizumab clinical studies were tested for the presence of ixekizumab ADA. The ELISA method for 
analysing human serum samples was previously assessed and then originally validated by ALTA 
Analytical Laboratory. However, prior to the axSpA clinical studies it was transferred to ICON 
Laboratory Services, Inc., Whitesboro, NY. A cross-validation experiment was performed according to 
guideline and was deemed acceptable by CHMP.  
Population Pharmacokinetic Analysis 
The MAH characterized the PK of ixekizumab using population PK analysis, separately for radiographic 
axial spondyloarthritis and non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis. The base population PK model in 
both reports was based on the final population PK models in patients with psoriasis (Ps) and 
Ps/psoriatic arthritis (PsA). The parameters were re-estimated, and first the significant covariates in Ps 
and PsA were tested and only retained in the base PK model if the effects remained significant. 
Subsequently, other covariate effects were tested, only in the r-axSpA or nr-axSpA PK model. Weight 
was not found to have a significant impact on central and peripheral volume of distribution in patients 
with nr-axSpA, as was done in the analyses for all other indications. This is likely due to the patient 
characteristics in this study or the data collection, and the MAH should have kept weight with fixed 
exponent on volume in the model for nr-axSpA as well. However, as it is not considered to have a 
major impact on the final conclusion, the issue was not further pursued by CHMP. The approach of 
Assessment report

Page 39/183 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
estimating allometric scaling exponents for CL and V terms rather than fixing to the theoretical values 
of 0.75 and 1 was challenged and justified. The posthoc PK parameter estimates from the models did 
not differ for CL, and very little for Vd estimates. The goodness-of-fit plots for the PopPK models do 
not show any major trends, and the pcVPCs indicate that the models can adequately predict the data. 
The final parameter estimates of both models were reasonable (Table 7 and Table 8), and similar to 
the parameter estimates of the previously developed model for Ps and PsA (Table 9). The final models 
are considered adequate for individual prediction of concentrations. In the final population PK model in 
patients with r-axSpA shrinkage was 4.53% for clearance (CL) and 36.4% for volume of distribution of 
the peripheral compartment (V3). For patients with nr-axSpA shrinkage was 3.69% for CL and 22.1% 
for V3. 
PK/PD Modelling 
Post hoc PK parameters from the final population PK model were merged with dosing records and 
ASAS20/40 data to carry out sequential PK/PD modelling. Analyses of exposure-response relationships 
were conducted using both exploratory graphical approaches (exposure-safety analysis) and model-
based approaches (exposure-efficacy analyses).  
For the exposure-efficacy analysis, the pcVPCs and parameter estimates for the static and time-course 
model for both indications indicate that the model is adequately predicting the observed data. The 
models can predict the exposure-efficacy relationship adequately. The MAH presented model-based 
exposure-efficacy analysis to support the 80 mg Q4W dosing regimen for both indications. While the 
trends in the plots may be in clear support of a 160mg SD in all subpopulations the responses overlap 
which render the result difficult to interpret. There are limitations to the model, which is observed in 
the presented stratified plots. The model suggests similar effect using the 160 mg and 80 mg starting 
dose. However, the benefit of a starting dose cannot be based solely on model-based predictions. 
Safety data from study RHBX were analysed separately from studies RHBV and RHBW. Data up to 
week 16 were analysed in the latter mentioned studies, however, in study RHBX (nr-axSPA), which 
was conducted up to week 52, only data up to week 16 were analysed because 48% of total 
randomized patients switched dosing regimen (non-randomised switched) at week 16. A trend towards 
a slightly higher frequency of treatment emergent adverse events for the Q2W dosing regimen can be 
observed for the nr-axSpA patients. An exposure-response relationship was observed for injection site 
reaction in both analyses, and there were higher incidences of infections reported with ixekizumab in 
the two upper Ctrough quartiles compared to placebo and the two lower Ctrough quartiles. For other 
infection AESIs, incidence rates were low and no relationship with Ctrough values could be conducted. 
Pharmacokinetic analyses indicate that drug clearance of ixekizumab was not affected by concomitant 
administration of oral corticosteroids, NSAIDs, sulfasalazine, or methotrexate. Section 4.5 of the 
SmPC is updated to include this information.   
2.3.6.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The ixekizumab pharmacokinetics (PK) in adult patients with r-axSpA and nr-axSpA has been 
adequately characterized and the PK determined to be consistent with the PK in patients with Ps and 
PsA. Section 4.5 of the SmPC is updated to indicate that pharmacokinetic analyses have shown that 
drug clearance of ixekizumab was not affected by concomitant administration of oral corticosteroids, 
NSAIDs, sulfasalazine, or methotrexate.

2.4.  Clinical efficacy 
The MAH submitted results of 3 phase III studies (RHBV, RHBW, and RHBX), randomised, double-
blind, placebo-controlled. Studies RHBV and RHBW were conducted in patients with active r-axSpA, 
respectively bDMARD naïve and TNFi-experienced patients. Study RHBX was conducted in b-DMARD naïve 
nr-axSpA patients. The placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment period of Studies RHBV and RHBW 
was 16 weeks, whereas the placebo-controlled, double-blind treatment period of Study RHBX was 52 
weeks. 
The axSpA programme also includes Study I1F-MC-RHBY (RHBY), a long-term extension study with a 
double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised withdrawal–retreatment period. Patients who completed 
any of the 3 pivotal Phase 3 studies and meet eligibility criteria can enrol in Study RHBY. Study RHBY 
is currently ongoing. 
2.4.1.  Dose response studies 
The dosing regimens (80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W) for the pivotal Phase 3 studies were selected 
based on the following considerations: 
•  Dose-ranging data from bDMARD-naive and TNFi-inadequate responder populations in I1F-MC-
RHAK (Phase 2 RA study). 
•  Dose-ranging data from I1F-MC-RHAJ (Phase 2 Ps study). 
• 
Final dosing regimen selection for the pivotal Phase 3 studies in patients with moderate-to-
severe plaque Ps and in patients with active PsA. 
•  All approved dose regimens for other indications have a 160-mg starting dose at Week 0. To 
evaluate the potential carryover effect of that starting dose on Week 16 response, the axSpA 
programme evaluated a 160-mg starting dose as well as an 80-mg starting dose at Week 0. 
2.4.2.  Main studies 
The efficacy and safety of ixekizumab in axSpA were assessed in 3 pivotal, randomised, double-blind, 
placebo-controlled Phase 3 studies (RHBV, RHBW, and RHBX). The placebo-controlled, double-blind 
treatment period of Studies RHBV and RHBW was 16 weeks in length, whereas the placebo-controlled, 
double-blind treatment period of Study RHBX was 52 weeks in length.

Injections were administered subcutaneously by the patient or caregiver after training by the clinical 
staff. Training: At Week 0 (baseline, Visit 2) each patient was scheduled to receive 3 injections of 
blinded investigational product. For training purposes, the proper procedures for administration of the 
initial injection was to be performed by clinical staff and the second and third injections of 
investigational product at that visit will be administered by the patient or caregiver under the 
supervision of clinical staff. If additional training was necessary, an injection could be administered by 
the patient or caregiver under the supervision of clinical staff at Week 2 (Visit 4). If the patient was 
unable to perform the injection, a caregiver, who will also be trained under supervision of site staff, 
may administer the investigational product. All subsequent injections of investigational product were 
be administered, unsupervised, by the patient or caregiver. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare ixekizumab 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and 80 mg every 4

Definitions of endpoints: 
ASAS20 and ASAS40. The ASAS20 and ASAS40 are derived from the following patient-reported 
assessments: 
Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity. The patient was asked to respond to the following 
question: “How active was your spondylitis on average during the last week?”  The answer was 
recorded on an NRS and was rated between “0” (not active) and “10” (very active). 
Spinal Pain. The patient was asked to respond to the following 2 questions (on average during the last 
week): “How much pain of your spine due to ankylosing spondylitis do you have?” and “How much 
pain of your spine due to ankylosing spondylitis do you have at night?”  The answers were recorded on 
an NRS and were each rated between “0” (no pain) and “10” (most severe pain).  The first question is 
used to determine the spinal pain component of the ASAS20 or ASAS40 response. 
Function (BASFI). Patients were asked to rate the difficulty associated with 10 individual basic 
functional activities.  Patients responded to each question using an NRS scale (range 0 to 10), with a 
higher score indicating worse function.  The patient’s final BASFI score is the mean of the 10 item 
scores completed on an NRS. 
Inflammation (mean of BASDAI Questions 5 and 6) 
The BASDAI is a patient-reported assessment consisting of 6 questions that relate to 5 major 
symptoms relevant to axSpA.  The following 2 questions are used to determine the inflammation 
component of the ASAS20 or ASAS40 response:  Intensity and Duration of morning stiffness.  Patients 
scored each item with a score from 0 to 10 (NRS). 
An ASAS20 response is defined as an at least 20% improvement and an absolute improvement from 
baseline of at least 1 unit (range 0 to 10) in at least 3 of 4 domains (Patient Global, Spinal Pain, 
Function, and Inflammation), without any worsening of at least 20% and at least 1 unit (range 0 to 
10) in the remaining domain. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 50/183 
 
  
 
 
An ASAS40 response is defined as an at least 40% improvement and an absolute improvement from 
baseline of at least 2 units (range 0 to 10) in at least 3 of 4 domains (Patient Global, Spinal Pain, 
Function, and Inflammation), without any worsening in the remaining domain. 
hs-CRP 
High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) was the measure of acute phase reactant. 
BASDAI 
The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) is a patient-reported assessment 
consisting of 6 questions that relate to 5 major symptoms relevant to axSpA   (1) Fatigue, (2) Spinal 
pain, (3) Peripheral arthritis, (4) Enthesitis, (5) Intensity, and (6) Duration of morning stiffness.  
Patients needed to score each item with a score from 0 to 10 (NRS).  The BASDAI50 represents an 
improvement of at least 50% of the BASDAI score from baseline. 
ASDAS 
The Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS) is a composite index to assess disease 
activity in axSpA).  The parameters used for the ASDAS (with hs-CRP as acute phase reactant) are 
Total back pain (BASDAI Question 2) 
Patient Global Assessment of Disease Activity 
• 
• 
• 
•  Duration of morning stiffness (BASDAI Question 6), and  
•  CRP in mg/L. 
Peripheral pain/swelling (BASDAI Question 3) 
ASDAScrp = 0.121 × total back pain + 0.110 × patient global + 0.073 × peripheral pain/swelling + 
0.058 × duration of morning stiffness + 0.579 × Ln(CRP+1)  
Four disease activity states have been defined by ASAS consensus: 
•  ASDAS <1.3 defines inactive disease 
•  1.3≤ASDAS<2.1 defines low disease activity 
•  2.1≤ASDAS≤3.5 defines high disease activity, and  
•  ASDAS >3.5 defines very high disease activity. 
Clinically important improvement is defined as change of at least 1.1 units, and major improvement is 
defined as change of at least 2.0 units  or achievement of the minimum of ASDAS score (0.6361) 
BASMI 
The Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Metrology Index (BASMI) is a combined index comprising the 
following 5 clinical measurements of spinal mobility in patients with axSpA 
Lateral spinal flexion 
Tragus-to-wall distance 
• 
• 
• 
Lumbar flexion (modified Schrober) 
•  Maximal intermalleolar distance, and  
•  Cervical rotation. 
The BASMI includes these 5 measurements that were each scaled to a score of 0 to 10 depending on 
the result of the assessment (BASMI linear function).  The average score of the 5 assessments gives 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 51/183 
 
  
 
 
the BASMI linear result. 
MRI SIJ and Spine (SPARCC Scores) 
MRI SIJ 
Both left and right SIJs were scored for bone marrow oedema.  Total SIJ SPARCC scores can range 
from 0 to 72, with higher scores reflecting worse disease.  Scoring was performed by central readers. 
MRI spine 
All 23 disco-vertebral units (DVUs) of the spine (from C2 to S1) were scored for bone marrow 
oedema.  A single DVU has a scoring range of 0 to 18, bringing the maximum total score to 414, with 
higher scores reflecting worse disease.  Scoring was performed by central readers. 
SF-36 
The 36-Item Short Form Health Survey (SF-36) is a 36-item patient-reported instrument designed to 
assess physical functioning, role-physical, role-emotional, bodily pain, vitality, social functioning, 
mental health, and general health.  The 2 overarching domains of mental well-being and physical well-
being are captured by the mental component summary (MCS) and physical component summary 
(PCS) scores.  Items are answered on Likert scales of varying lengths.  The SF-36 version 2 (acute 
version) was used, which utilises a 1-week recall period. 
ASAS HI 
The Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society Health Index (ASAS HI) is an 
axSpA-specific17-item patient-reported instrument designed to assess functioning, disability, and 
health.  The ASAS HI is a reliable, valid, and responsive, axSpA-specific measure for evaluating 
clinically meaningful improvement in overall functioning and quality of life (QoL). 
The ASAS HI has scores ranging from 0 (good health) to 17 (poor health).  Each item consists of 1 
question that the patient needed to respond to with either “I agree” (score of 1) or “I do not agree” 
(score of 0).  A score of “1” was given where the item was affirmed, indicating adverse health.  All 
item scores are summed to give a total score or index. 
Sample size 
The total planned sample size for study RHBV was 320 patients. With 80 patients per treatment group 
and assuming the Week 16 ASAS40 response rates of 16% for the placebo group and 44% for the 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W treatment group, this study was planned to have approximately 96% power 
to test the superiority of ixekizumab Q2W to placebo for the ASAS40 at Week 16. A 2-sided Fisher’s 
exact test at an alpha level of 0.05 was assumed. 
Randomisation 
At Week 0 (Visit 2), eligible patients were randomised using an allocation ratio of 1:1:1:1 to receive 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, adalimumab 40 mg Q2W, or placebo. The patients 
randomised to ixekizumab were further randomised 1:1 to a starting dose of 80 mg or 160 mg (given 
as 2 SC injections of 80 mg). Treatment assignments were determined by a computer-generated 
random sequence using an interactive web-response system (IWRS). At randomisation subjects were 
stratified by country and baseline CRP (non-elevated or elevated; defined as CRP>5.00 mg/L). Due to 
operational feasibility, stratification by CRP was based on the most recent CRP prior to randomisation, 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 52/183 
 
  
 
 
i.e. screening CRP. Initially, it was planned to enrol approximately 50% of patients with baseline CRP 
elevated. Within study protocol amendment (b), approved 23 December 2016, the limitation on the 
enrolment of patients with elevated versus non-elevated CRP was removed so that all patients who 
met protocol eligibility criteria could be enrolled independent of CRP.  
At Week 16, all patients on placebo were re-randomised (1:1) to either ixekizumab group, receiving a 
starting dose of 160 mg (2 injections of 80 mg). 
At Week 16, all patients on adalimumab were re-randomised (1:1) to either ixekizumab group, 
receiving no starting dose. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study, with a double-dummy design. Initial randomisation (study drug 
administered between Weeks 0 and 16) remained blinded to study site personnel and patients until 
the final (i.e., end of study) clinical trial database lock has occurred. Study drug assigned during the 
Extended Treatment Period (Period 3) was known to the site and patient at entry to Study RHBY. 
Initial randomisation, as well as study drug assignment during Period 3, remained blinded to the 
sponsor until the clinical trial database through Week 16 had been locked. Unblinding occurred on 31 
January 2018. Unblinding details are specified in the blinding/unblinding plan included. The syringes 
(and contents) containing either ixekizumab or placebo were visibly indistinguishable from each other 
and visibly different from adalimumab and its matching placebo, and the syringes (and contents) 
containing either adalimumab or placebo to match adalimumab were visibly indistinguishable from 
each other (i.e., double-dummy design). Randomisation codes were generated and emergency 
unblinding for AEs were allowed to be performed with IWRS, which could have supplemented or taken 
the place of emergency codes generated by a computer drug-labeling system. No emergency 
unblinding took place in this study. 
Statistical methods 
Blinded Treatment Dosing Period weeks 0 to 16 (Period 2) 
A pre-planned interim database lock and unblinding of data occurred 31 January 2018 after the last 
patient had completed Visit 8 (Week 16) or the early termination visit (ETV). This was the primary 
(and final) analysis of the Blinded Treatment Dosing Period (Period 2) and included assessments of all 
primary and major secondary study objectives. The Statistical Analysis Plan version 1 was approved 
07 April 2016 (prior to first patient visit); version 2 was approved 19-Jan-2018, i.e. before unblinding. 
There was one post-hoc analysis assessing percentage of patients achieving ASDAS <2.1 but, 
according to the MAH, no other changes to the prespecified statistical analysis. 
Extended Treatment Period weeks 16 to 52 (Period 3) 
There was also an interim database lock after all patients had completed the Week 52 Visit or 
discontinued study drug early for analyses of efficacy and safety from the completed Extended 
Treatment Period (Period 3; Weeks 16 to 52). The date of Week 52 database lock was 05 Oct 2018; a 
version 3 of the SAP was approved after unblinding (16-Oct-2018) and included the adding of ASDAS 
<2.1 as a secondary endpoint. All endpoints assessed at Week 16 and during the 16-week placebo-
controlled period continued to be assessed through Week 52. Efficacy, health outcomes, and safety 
analyses for Period 3 were conducted on the Extended Treatment Period Population defined as all 
patients who received at least 1 dose of ixekizumab treatment during Period 3. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 53/183 
 
  
 
 
Selected analyses were also provided for the combined periods 2 and 3; (Weeks 0 to 52) based on the 
ITT Population including all patients randomised to ixekizumab at Week 0 (Visit 2). 
Primary/final analysis week 16 (Period 2) 
Primary and major secondary endpoints were analysed according to a prespecified graphical multiple 
testing procedure. Unless otherwise specified, efficacy and health outcome analyses were conducted 
on the intent-to-treat (ITT) population comprising all randomised patients analysed according to the 
treatment group to which they had been randomised. In the primary analysis, treatment groups of 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and Q4W were analysed without regard to starting dose. 
Treatment comparisons of categorical efficacy variables, including the primary, response rate week 
16 based on ASAS40, were made using a logistic regression analysis with treatment, geographic 
region (Europe and non-Europe), and baseline CRP status (non-elevated or elevated) in the model. 
The odds ratio and 95% CIs were reported as was treatment difference and 95% CI. Secondary 
analysis was conducted using a Fisher’s exact test. Patients who did not meet clinical response criteria 
or had missing data were considered non-responders (referred to as non-responder imputation [NRI]).  
Analyses of continuous efficacy and health outcomes variables (except MRI SPARCC spine score) 
were based on mixed-effects models for repeated measures (MMRM) with treatment, geographic 
region, baseline CRP status, baseline value (except for the analysis of CRP, in which baseline CRP 
value was not included in the model), visit, baseline value-by-visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction 
as fixed factors. The primary analysis for change from baseline in MRI SPARCC spine score was an 
observed case (OC) analysis using ANCOVA with treatment, geographic region, baseline CRP status 
and baseline value in the model. Only patients with both baseline and Week 16 SPARCC spine score 
were included in the analysis. 
Additional/sensitivity analyses 
As a secondary analysis for the primary and major secondary categorical efficacy measures, a 
categorical, pseudo-likelihood based mixed-effects model of repeated measures (categorical MMRM) 
estimating the percentage of patients achieving response across postbaseline visits were used. The 
model included treatment, geographic region, baseline CRP status, visit, and treatment-by-visit as 
fixed factors. The probability of response, the corresponding 2-sided 95% CI, and the p-value for 
treatment comparisons at Week 16 (Visit 8) and all other postbaseline visits were reported. 
For endpoints ASAS40, ASAS20, and ASDAS change from baseline at Week 16 sensitivity analyses 
were performed using placebo multiple imputation (pMI). Based on the assumption that the statistical 
behaviour of drug- and placebo-treated patients after discontinuing study medication becomes that of 
placebo-treated patients, multiple imputations (MIs) were used to replace missing outcomes for drug- 
and placebo-treated patients who discontinued. 
For continuous major secondary endpoints secondary analyses were performed based on ANCOVA 
models using modified baseline observation carried forward (mBOCF) and last observation carried 
forward (LOCF). The modified BOCF implied that for patients discontinuing study drug due to an AE, 
the baseline observation was carried forward, for patients discontinuing study drug for any other 
reason, the last non-missing observation before discontinuation were carried forward. Patients without 
at least one post-baseline observation were excluded with the exception of patients discontinuing 
study treatment due to an AE. LOCF was identical to the mBOCF approach, with one exception: for 
patients discontinuing study drug due to an AE, the last non-missing post-baseline observation before 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 54/183 
 
  
 
 
discontinuation were to be carried forward to the corresponding time point for evaluation. Randomised 
patients without any postbaseline observation were excluded.  
To evaluate the robustness of statistical analyses of key efficacy data and assumptions inherent in 
missing data imputation methods, tipping point analyses were performed for ASAS40, ASAS20, and 
mean change from baseline in ASDAS Week 16. 
Multiple Comparisons/Multiplicity 
A multiple testing strategy for the primary and major secondary objectives was implemented to 
control the family-wise type I error rate at a 2-sided α level of 0.05 based on a graphical multiple 
testing procedure (Bretz et al. 2011).  
The following primary and major secondary outcomes were planned to be tested for both ixekizumab 
80 mg Q2W and Q4W regimen at Week 16: 
Primary - proportion of patients achieving an ASAS40 response [ASAS40] 
Secondary 1 - proportion of patients achieving an ASAS20 response [ASAS20] 
Secondary 2 - change from baseline in ASDAS score [ASDAS CFB] 
Secondary 3 - proportion of patients achieving BASDAI50 [BASDAI50] 
Secondary 4 - change from baseline in BASFI [BASFI CFB] 
Secondary 5 - proportion of patients achieving ASDAS inactive disease [ASDAS IN] 
Secondary 6 - change from baseline in MRI of the spine [MRI spine SPARCC CFB] 
Secondary 7 - change from baseline in SF-36 PCS score [SF-36 PCS CFB] 
Secondary 8 - change from baseline in ASAS-HI [ASAS-HI CFB]. 
The 8 secondary outcomes were grouped into 2 tiers. 
Tier 1: secondary hypotheses 1 to 5. 
Tier 2: secondary hypotheses 6 to 8.

Abbreviations: ASAS = Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society (ASAS); Q2W = every 2 weeks; Q4W

The testing steps were as described below: 
Step 1: The primary outcome of ASAS40 was tested for ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W vs. placebo at a two-
sided α=0.05.  If the null hypothesis was rejected, then testing commenced to Step 2. If the null 
hypothesis could not be rejected, no further testing was to be conducted. 
Step 2: The primary outcome of ASAS40 was tested for ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W vs placebo at a two-
sided α=0.05. If the null hypothesis was rejected, then testing commenced to Step 3. If the null 
hypothesis could not be rejected, no further testing was to be conducted.  
Step 3: α=0.025 was distributed to Tier 1 set of secondary outcomes for ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W 
(blue circles, see below), and the remaining α=0.025 was distributed to Tier 1 set of secondary 
outcomes for Ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W (green circles, see below).

The major secondary endpoints for both doses were tested according to the prespecified procedure. 
The testing process continued for the remaining outcomes by allocating the remaining α to the next 
set of outcomes as long as at least one hypothesis could be rejected. Each time a hypothesis was 
rejected, the graph was updated to reflect the reallocation of α, which was considered “recycled” 
(Alosh et al. 2014). This iterative process of updating the graph and reallocating α was repeated until 
all major secondary hypotheses had been tested or when no remaining hypotheses could be rejected 
at their corresponding α level. The weights along the edges for α allocation between ixekizumab 80 mg 
Q2W and ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W outcomes as well as within each of the tiers were prespecified (as 
shown above). 
There was no multiplicity adjustment for the other secondary endpoints. 
Different starting doses 
The impact of ixekizumab starting dose of 160 mg versus 80 mg on treatment response at Week 16 
and time to onset of action were summarised and evaluated separately. Response rates in categorical 
variables (including ASAS40, ASAS20, ASDAS major improvement) and LS mean change in continuous 
efficacy measures (including CRP, BASFI) at Week 16 were presented for patients randomised to 
ixekizumab Q2W or Q4W treatment regimen with ixekizumab 160 mg starting dose and with 
ixekizumab 80 mg starting dose. 
Subgroup Analyses 
Subgroup analyses were conducted based on an ASAS40 response at Week 16 (NRI) and ASAS20 
(NRI) at Week 16. The subgroups included patient demographics, geographic region, baseline disease 
severity, and other patient characteristics. A logistic regression model with treatment, subgroup, and 
the interaction of subgroup-by-treatment included as factors was used. The subgroup-by-treatment 
interaction was tested at the significance level of 0.10. Treatment group differences were evaluated

within each category of the subgroup using Fisher’s exact test, regardless of whether the interaction 
was statistically significant. If any group within the subgroup was <10% of the total population, only 
summaries of the efficacy data were provided (that is, no inferential testing).  
Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 781 patients signed informed consent and entered into the Screening Period of Study RHBV. 
In total, 341 patients were randomised to 1 of 4 treatment groups as the ITT Population.  
One patient (480-20445), a screen fail, was inadvertently randomised to placebo; the patient was 
discontinued at Week 0 (Visit 2) prior to receiving study drug. 
A total of 97.1% of randomised patients completed the Blinded Treatment Dosing Period. The two 
figures below summarize patient disposition from study drug.

Protocol deviations:  
Overall, 94 patients (27.6%) had at least 1 important protocol deviation.  
The following categories of important protocol deviations were further reviewed: 
•  Violation of inclusion criterion: (no established diagnosis of rad-axSpA at screening): 17 
patients (5.0%) had this protocol deviation. These patients were reclassified as not meeting 
mNY criteria specified in this criterion after a change in central readers early in the trial. 
• 
Took incorrect study medication: 16 patients (4.7%) were reported to have taken incorrect 
study medication during the Blinded Treatment Dosing Period, with a similar percentage of 
patients across treatment groups. For most patients affected, the error occurred at a single 
visit. Most of the errors were a result of inaccurate recordings of the syringe number/suffix  
Based on what study drug was dispensed, 3 errors had a meaningful impact: 2 errors (1 in the 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group and 1 in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W group) likely affected the 
ixekizumab exposure analysis because the injections were treated as missing due to the incorrect 
syringe number. One error of administration of incorrect syringe order resulted in a double dose of 
ixekizumab (160 mg, instead of 80 mg) for a patient in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group on a single 
day after Week 0. 
• 
Improper informed consent: 40 patients (11.7%) had this protocol deviation. All patients 
provided informed consent; however, there were delays in consent updates or other minor 
errors in the consent, resulting in protocol deviations. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 59/183 
 
  
 
 
 
 
A subset of important protocol deviations that might have an impact on the primary objective were 
pre-specified in the SAP. Only those patients who deviated from these criteria (n=36, 10.6%) were 
excluded from the PPS analysis. 
Recruitment 
Date first patient enrolled: 20 Jun 2016 
Date last patient completed Week 16 Visit: 08 Dec 2017 
Date of database lock: 31 Jan 2018 
This study was conducted at 84 study sites in 12 countries. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 2 protocol amendments. The main changes implemented were related to the conduct of 
the study and are as follows: 
Protocol Amendment (a) - 05 August 2016  
• 
The SPARCC scoring method for MRI of the spine replaced the ASSpiMRI-Berlin score as a 
major secondary endpoint. Emerging evidence indicated the SPARCC may be more 
discriminative than the Berlin scoring method and may provide higher inter-examiner 
reliability. The ASSpiMRI-Berlin scoring method was still included as an endpoint for “other” 
secondary objectives to allow for comparisons with other studies’ data that are based on the 
Berlin method. 
•  Guidance was provided to allow rescreening of patients for Study RHBV who were ineligible for 
Study I1F-MC-RHBX, a Phase 3 study for ixekizumab in bDMARD-naive patients with non-
axSpA. 
•  Adjudication of suspected IBD was added to ensure that all reported events were evaluated 
uniformly by a single group in an unbiased manner. 
•  Additional changes were made to enhance clarity of the protocol. 
Protocol Amendment (b) - 23 December 2016 
The main change implemented with this amendment was related to the method of treatment 
assignment. Specifically, the amendment removed the limitation on the enrolment of patients with 
elevated versus non-elevated CRP so that all patients who met protocol eligibility criteria could be 
enrolled independent of having elevated or non-elevated CRP. 
Baseline data 
Patients were enrolled in 12 countries. The majority of patients (53.2%) were from Europe, while the 
rest were from other parts of the world. At baseline, the mean age of patients was 41.7 years, with 
the majority of patients (95.9%) being <65 years of age. The mean age at onset of axSpA was 26.1 
years, mean duration of axSpA symptoms was 16.0 years, and mean time since axSpA diagnosis was

7.7 years. Patients were predominantly male (81.2%), white (62.6%), and human leukocyte antigen 
B27 (HLA-B27) positive (90.9%). Patients had a mean weight of 78.1 kg and a mean BMI of 26.5 
kg/m2. Mean baseline BASDAI and ASDAS were similar across treatment groups (6.7 to 6.8 and 3.7 to 
3.9, respectively). Across all treatment groups, the mean and median baseline high sensitivity CRP 
(hs-CRP) levels were 13.5 mg/L and 7.6 mg/L, respectively, and 64.4% of patients had a hs-CRP level 
>5.00 mg/L at baseline. At baseline, 91.8% of patients were receiving NSAIDs, 36.8% of patients 
were receiving cDMARDs (28,5% Sulfasalazine, 8,5% Methotrexate, 0,6% Hydroxychloroquine), and 
9.4% of patients were receiving oral corticosteroids. 
Numbers analysed 
The primary analysis population was the ITT population including all randomised patients 
corresponding to a total of 341 patients; 83 in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W arm, 81 in the ixekizumab 
80 mg Q4W arm, 90 in the adalimumab 40 mg Q2W arm and 87 patients in the placebo arm. In 
addition, the primary analysis was repeated using the PPS.

Primary and major secondary endpoints 
Statistically significant improvements in efficacy were observed for each of the ixekizumab treatment 
groups relative to placebo for the primary and for all the major secondary objectives at Week 16.  
There was a significantly greater percentage of patients who achieved an ASAS40 response at Week 
16 for each of the ixekizumab treatment groups and for the adalimumab active reference group 
compared with the placebo group.

Ancillary analyses  
Subgroup analyses supporting the primary endpoint (ASAS40) and the major secondary endpoint 
(ASAS20) were performed by patient demographics, geographic region, baseline disease severity, and 
other patient characteristics. The subgroup analyses were conducted with small subgroup sizes and 
without control for Type I error. The findings from the subgroup analyses were generally consistent 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 67/183 
 
  
 
 
 
with those from the overall population. For the majority of subgroup analyses, both ixekizumab 
treatment groups demonstrated greater efficacy compared with the placebo group. All significant 
treatment-by-subgroup interactions (defined as p<.10) are summarized below. 
At Week 16, the following subgroups from the Blinded Treatment Dosing Period showed significant 
treatment-by-subgroup interactions 
•  ASAS40 
o  Geographic region: Europe vs. non-Europe (p=.049) 
o  Geographic region: America vs. Asia vs. Europe (p=.064) 
o  Baseline CRP category: ≤3.00 mg/L vs. >3.00 mg/L (p=.092) 
o  Duration of symptom onset category: <10 years vs. ≥10 years (p=.020)  
o  Duration of symptom onset category: <5 years vs. ≥5 years (p=.093)  
•  ASAS20  
o  Baseline CRP category: ≤3.00 mg/L vs. >3.00 mg/L (p=.097)  
o  History of enthesitis: yes vs. no (p=.083)  
The applicant states that the significance and clinical meaningfulness of these potential statistically 
significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions needs further investigation in a larger, integrated 
dataset. 
Comparison of Results in Subpopulations 
Efficacy in Subpopulations in R-axSpA Studies 
Variables analysed 
Potential differences in response across patient demographic and baseline disease activity variables 
were examined for ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates at Week 16 in the Primary R-axSpA Analysis 
Set.  The most clinically relevant subgroup variables included 
• 
• 
• 
patient demographics (e.g., sex, age, weight, race) 
disease-related characteristics (e.g., baseline CRP category, baseline ASDAS category, 
baseline BASDAI category, duration of symptoms since axSpA onset), and  
concomitant therapy use at baseline (e.g., cDMARD, oral corticosteroid, NSAIDs, analgesic). 
Results of subgroup analyses 
Figure 32. presents the ASAS20 and ASAS40 response rates for selected subgroups in the Primary 
R-axSpA Analysis Set.  The findings from the subgroup analyses were generally consistent with those 
from the overall population, and the treatment effect of ixekizumab was generally consistent across 
subgroups. 
For the majority of subgroup analyses, both ixekizumab treatment groups demonstrated greater 
efficacy compared with the placebo group, and there was no difference between ixekizumab treatment 
groups. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 68/183 
 
  
 
 
 
For patients who were 65 years or older (6.0% of the ITT population) or who were receiving oral 
corticosteroids at baseline (10.4% of the ITT population), interpretation of the data was limited by the 
small number of patients in each of these subgroups. 
In summary, the applicant concludes that subgroup analyses did not identify any demographic or 
baseline variables with important effects on the efficacy of ixekizumab.

Treatments 
The Blinded Treatment Dosing Period (Period 2; Week 0 to Week 16) involved a comparison of 2 
dosing regimens of ixekizumab, 80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W, to placebo. Each ixekizumab treatment 
group included patients receiving an 80-mg or a 160-mg starting dose. All doses were administered 
via SC injection. During the Extended Treatment Period (Period 3; Week 16 to Week 52), patients 
originally assigned to either ixekizumab dosing regimen remained on the same dosing regimen 
through Period 3. At Week 16, patients originally assigned to placebo were re-randomized at a 1:1 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 73/183 
 
  
 
 
ratio to ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W or Q4W with a 160-mg starting dose (as two 80-mg SC injections). To 
maintain blinding, all patients received 2 injections at baseline (Week 0). During the remainder of 
Period 2, all patients received 1 injection Q2W. At Week 16, all patients, regardless of treatment 
group, received 2 SC injections. During the remainder of Period 3, each patient received 1 SC injection 
Q2W regardless of his or her assigned dosing regimen.  
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare ixekizumab 80 mg every 2 weeks (Q2W) and 80 mg every 4 
weeks (Q4W) versus placebo in the treatment of patients with active radiographic axial 
spondyloarthritis (rad-axSpA) at Week 16, as measured by the proportion of patients achieving an 
Assessment of Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response. 
There were also several secondary objectives, see endpoints below. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  
ASAS40 response at week 16. 
Key secondary endpoints 
•  ASAS20 response at Week 16 
•  ASDAS change from baseline at week 16 
•  BASDAI change from baseline at week 16 
•  ASDAS <2.1 response at week 16. 
•  BASFI change from baseline at week 16 
•  MRI Spine SPARCC score change from baseline at Week 16 
•  SF-36 PCS score change from baseline at Week 16 
•  ASAS HI change from baseline at Week 16 
Other endpoints were mostly in line with study RHBV.  
Sample size 
The total planned sample size of the study was 300 patients. With 100 patients per treatment group 
and assuming the Week 16 ASAS40 response rates of 7% for the placebo group and 27% for the 
ixekizumab 80-mg Q2W treatment group, this study was planned to have approximately 96% power 
to test the superiority of ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W to placebo for ASAS40 at Week 16. A 2-sided 
Fisher’s exact test at an alpha level of 0.05 was assumed.

Randomisation 
At Week 0 (Visit 2), patients who met all criteria for enrolment were randomised using a 1:1:1 ratio to 
receive ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, or placebo. Assignment to treatment groups 
was determined by a computer-generated random sequence using an interactive web-response 
system (IWRS). At randomisation patients were stratified by country, baseline CRP (non-elevated or 
elevated) and number of prior TNF inhibitors used (1 or 2). 
Initially, the study was to enrol approximately 70% of patients with baseline CRP elevated (>5.00 
mg/L) and approximately 30% of patients with normal baseline CRP, and approximately 80% of 
patients with 1 prior TNF inhibitor and approximately 20% of patients with 2 prior TNF inhibitors. 
Within study protocol amendment (b) (approved 14 Jan 2017) the cohort size of patients having failed 
2 prior TNFi was increased from 20% to 35%. Within amendment (c) (approved 01 May 2017) the 
cohort size of patients having failed 2 prior TNFi was increased from 35% to 40% and the cohort size 
of patients with non-elevated baseline CRP was increased from 30% to 40%. 
Amendment (c) also allowed patients to re-screen for the elevated CRP cohort (once the non-elevated 
CRP cohort had fully enrolled). 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Initial randomisation (study drug administered between Weeks 0 and 
16) remained blinded to study site personnel and patients until the final (i.e., end of study) clinical 
trial database lock has occurred, or patients have entered Study RHBY, whichever occurs first. Study 
drug assigned during the Extended Treatment Period (Period 3) will be known to the site and patient 
at entry to Study RHBY. Initial randomisation, as well as study drug assignment during Period 3, 
remained blinded to the sponsor until the clinical trial database through Week 16 had been locked. 
The syringes (and contents) containing either ixekizumab or placebo were visibly indistinguishable 
from each other.  
Statistical methods 
As pre-planned a database lock and unblinding occurred on 19 Jun 2018 after all patients had 
completed the Week 16 Visit or discontinued study treatment early, either on or prior to Week 16. The 
statistical analysis plan (SAP) was originally approved on 07 Apr 2016 (prior to first patient visit) and 
revised twice on 12 Jun 2018 and 18 Jun 2018 before unblinding of data. There were no changes to 
the prespecified statistical analysis after the interim database lock and unblinding.  
A second (pre-planned) interim database lock (28 February 2019) occurred after all patients had 
completed the Week 52 Visit or discontinued study drug early, either on or prior to Week 52. Efficacy 
and safety results from the completed Extended Treatment Period (Weeks 16 to 52; Extended 
Treatment Period Population), during which study treatment remained blinded to study site personnel 
and patients, are presented in a separate CSR. Selected analyses were also provided for the combined 
Blinded Treatment Dosing Period and Extended Treatment Period (Weeks 0 to 52; ITT or Safety 
Population initially randomised to ixekizumab at Week 0). 
At the time of the database lock for the Week 52 CSR, the Post-Treatment Follow-Up Period was still 
ongoing; results from this period will be presented in a separate report.

Primary analysis 
Treatment comparisons of categorical efficacy variables (including the primary endpoint) were 
performed using a logistic regression analysis model including treatment, geographic region (Europe 
and non-Europe), number of prior TNFi used, and baseline CRP status (non-elevated or elevated; 
elevated defined as >5.00 mg/L). The odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were reported; 
treatment difference and 95% CI were also reported. Secondary analysis was conducted using a 
Fisher’s exact test. For patients who did not meet clinical response criteria or had missing data were 
considered non-responders (referred to as non-responder imputation [NRI]). 
The primary analyses for all continuous efficacy and health outcomes variables (except MRI score) 
were based on a mixed-effects model of repeated measures (MMRM) analysis method with treatment, 
geographic region, number of prior TNFi used, baseline CRP status, baseline value (except for the 
analysis of CRP, in which baseline CRP value was not included in the model), visit, baseline value-by-
visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed factors. The primary analyses for MRI endpoints were 
made using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) based on observed data.  
Secondary/Sensitivity analyses 
As a secondary analysis for the primary and major secondary categorical efficacy measures, a 
categorical MMRM, estimating the percentage of patients achieving response across postbaseline 
visits, was used. A secondary analysis for continuous efficacy and health outcome variables was 
conducted using ANCOVA with the modified baseline observation carried forward (mBOCF) method; 
the last observation carried forward (LOCF) method was also used for major secondary objectives. 
The placebo multiple imputation (pMI) method was used for analyses of the efficacy endpoints 
ASAS40, ASAS20, and ASDAS change from baseline at Week 16. 
To evaluate the robustness of statistical analyses of key efficacy data and assumptions, tipping point 
analyses were performed for the endpoints ASAS40, ASAS20, and mean change from baseline in 
ASDAS at the primary time point of Week 16. 
Multiple comparisons/multiplicity 
A multiple testing strategy was implemented to control the family-wise type I error rate at a 2-sided α 
level of 0.05 based on a graphical multiple testing procedure (Bretz et al. 2011). The following primary 
and major secondary outcomes were to be tested for both ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and Q4W regimen 
at Week 16: 
Primary - proportion of patients achieving an ASAS40 response [ASAS40] 
Secondary 1 - proportion of patients achieving an ASAS20 response [ASAS20] 
Secondary 2 - change from baseline in ASDAS score [ASDAS change from baseline (CFB)] 
Secondary 3 - change from baseline in BASDAI score [BASDAI CFB] 
Secondary 4 - change from baseline in BASFI [BASFI CFB] 
Secondary 5 - change from baseline in SF-36 PCS score [SF-36 PCS CFB] 
Secondary 6 - proportion of patients achieving ASDAS <2.1 [ASDAS<2.1] 
Secondary 7 - change from baseline in ASAS Health Index (ASAS HI) [ASAS HI CFB] 
Secondary 8 - change from baseline in MRI of the spine [MRI spine SPARCC score CFB] 
With the exception of secondary outcome 8 (MRI spine SPARCC score CFB), the remaining secondary 
outcomes were grouped into 2 tiers.  
The testing steps were as outlined below:

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 316 patients (98, ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W; 114, ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W; 104, placebo) 
were randomised and were treated (at least 1 dose) in the Blinded Treatment Dosing Period. 
A total of 282 patients (90, ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W; 99, ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W; 93, placebo) 
completed Week 16 Visit of which 281 (188, ixekizumab/ixekizumab; 93, placebo/ixekizumab) were 
treated (at least 1 dose) in Extended Treatment Period. 
A total of 250 patients (169, ixekizumab/ixekizumab; 81, placebo/ixekizumab) completed Week 52 
Visit.

Figure 35.  Participant flow in study RHBW during the extended treatment period, week 16 until 
week 52. 
In Study RHBW, rates of discontinuations due to AEs through Week 16 were similar for the ixekizumab 
80-mg Q2W treatment group relative to placebo, but higher for the ixekizumab 80-mg Q4W treatment 
group relative to placebo, with no particular AE driving the difference.  This observed difference may 
reflect random variability rather than drug effect, given that the rate of discontinuations due to AEs in 
the more frequent ixekizumab 80-mg Q2W treatment group is similar as for placebo.  In addition, 
there were no discontinuations due to AEs through Week 16 in the Q4W treatment group in Studies 
RHBV and RHBX (bDMARD-naive populations)  
Recruitment 
Date first patient enrolled: 10 May 2016

This study was conducted at 106 study sites in 15 countries. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 4 protocol amendments:  
Protocol amendment (a) - 19 Sep 2016: The main changes implemented with this amendment were 
related to the conduct of the study and are as follows:  
• 
The SPARCC scoring method for MRI of the spine replaced the ASSpiMRI-Berlin score as a 
major secondary endpoint. Emerging evidence indicated that the SPARCC may be more 
discriminative than the Berlin scoring method and may provide higher inter-examiner 
Assessment report

Page 79/183 
 
  
 
 
 
 
reliability. The ASSpiMRI-Berlin scoring method was still included as an endpoint for “other” 
secondary objectives to allow for comparisons with other studies’ data that are based on the 
Berlin method. 
• 
 Adjudication of suspected IBD was added to ensure that all reported events were evaluated 
uniformly by a single group in an unbiased manner.  
•  Additional changes were made to enhance clarity of the protocol.   
Protocol Amendment (b) - 14 Jan 2017: The main change implemented with this amendment was 
related to the method of treatment assignment. Specifically, the amendment increased the cohort size 
of patients having failed 2 prior TNFi (from 20% to 35%) to more accurately reflect the patient 
population that might be treated in real life and to align with the spontaneous distribution of patients 
enrolled at the time of the amendment 
Protocol Amendment (c) - 01 May 2017: The main changes implemented with this amendment were 
related to the method of treatment assignment.  
The amendment increased the cohort size of patients having failed 2 prior TNFi (from 35% to 40%) 
and the cohort size of patients with non-elevated baseline CRP (30% to 40%) to more accurately 
reflect the patient population that might be treated in real life and to align with the spontaneous 
distribution of patients enrolled at the time of the amendment. The amendment also allowed patients 
to rescreen for the elevated CRP cohort (once the non-elevated CRP cohort had fully enrolled), which 
allowed patients to have an additional opportunity to participate in the study and receive study drug.  
Protocol Amendment (d) - 02 Jun 2017. The amendment corrected a numbering error in the Exclusion 
Criteria. 
Baseline data 
Demographic characteristics, disease history, and baseline characteristics were, according to the 
applicant, well balanced across treatment groups and consistent with the target population of r-axSpA. 
The patient population was predominantly male (80.1%), white (80.6%) and HLA-B27 positive 
(81.3%). The mean age was 46.1 years.  The mean age at onset of axSpA was 28.1 years.  The mean 
duration of axSpA symptoms was 18.4 years.  The mean time since axSpA diagnosis was 11.6 years. 
Disease activity at baseline was high-to-very high as reflected by mean baseline scores for BASDAI 
(7.4) and ASDAS (4.1), as well as mean hs-CRP (17.8 mg/L). 
At baseline,  
•  76.3% of patients were receiving NSAIDs 
•  27.2% of patients were receiving conventional DMARDs (sulfasalazine or methotrexate) 
•  11.4% of patients were receiving oral corticosteroids 
•  30.7% of patients were receiving analgesics 
•  62.9% of patients had prior use of 1 TNFi, and  
•  37.1% of patients had prior use of 2 TNFi’s.

The main reason of discontinuation of TNF-inhibitors was inadequate response (55.7%), loss of 
response (37.3%) or intolerance (14.2%)

Primary and major secondary endpoints 
The primary objective of the study was achieved for both ixekizumab treatment groups. There was a 
significantly greater percentage of patients who achieved an ASAS40 response at Week 16 for each of 
the ixekizumab treatment groups compared with the placebo group.

<8.0 g/dL (80 g/L) for female patients, or Other clinical laboratory test results at screening 
that are outside the normal reference range for the population and are considered clinically 
significant. 
Treatments 
The Blinded Treatment Dosing Period (Period 2) involved a comparison of ixekizumab at 2 treatment 
regimens (80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W) with placebo. Each ixekizumab treatment group included 
patients receiving an 80-mg or a 160-mg starting dose at Week 0. All doses were administered via SC 
injection. To maintain blinding, all patients received 2 injections at baseline (Week 0). During the 
remainder of Period 2, all patients received 1 injection Q2W. 
Beginning at Week 16 and up to Week 44, any patient, regardless of their original treatment group, 
could be identified by an investigator based on clinical judgment as an inadequate responder. At such 
time, changes in background therapy, biologic rescue therapy (open-label ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W), or 
both, could be offered at the discretion of the investigator, while remaining blinded to the original 
randomization treatment assignment. 
Objectives 
The primary objective was to compare both ixekizumab regimens (80 mg every 2 weeks [Q2W] or 80 
mg every 4 weeks [Q4W]) versus placebo in patients with active non radiographic axial

spondyloarthritis (nr-axSpA), as measured by the proportion of patients achieving an Assessment of 
Spondyloarthritis International Society 40 (ASAS40) response at  
•  Week 16 (for regulatory agencies that accept Week 16 as the primary endpoint for approval 
purposes) or 
• 
 Week 52 (for regulatory agencies that require Week 52 as the primary endpoint for approval 
purposes) 
There were also several secondary objectives, see endpoints below 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary endpoint:  
ASAS40 response at week 16 and week 52 
Key secondary endpoints 
•  ASDAS change from baseline at week 16 and 52 
•  BASDAI change from baseline at week 16 and 52 
•  ASDAS <2.1 response at week 16 and 52 
•  MRI SIJ SPARCC score change from baseline at Week 16 
•  SF-36 PCS score change from baseline at Week 16 and 52 
Sample size 
The planned sample size was 300 patients; 100 per treatment arm (ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W, 
ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W, and placebo). 
Power calculation for Week 16 
With 100 patients per treatment group, this study was planned to have approximately 98% power to 
test the superiority of ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W to placebo for ASAS40 response rate at Week 16. The 
following assumptions were used for the power calculations for ASAS40 response rate at Week 16 
regardless of starting dose: 
•  46% for the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group, and 
•  18% for the placebo group. 
A 2-sided Fisher’s exact test at an α level of 0.05 was used for the calculation. 
Power estimates for Week 52 
There was little data from similarly designed 52-week, placebo-controlled trials regarding the ASAS40 
response rate for active- and placebo-treated patients to guide power estimation at Week 52. Table 
27 provides power estimates to test the superiority of ixekizumab Q2W to placebo for the ASAS40 at 
Week 52, assuming various ASAS40 response rates for ixekizumab Q2W and placebo at Week 52. A 2-
sided Fisher’s exact test at the 0.05 level was assumed.

Randomisation 
Patients who met all criteria for enrolment were randomised to double-blind treatment at Week 0 
(Visit 2). Assignment to treatment groups was determined by a computer-generated random sequence 
using an interactive web-response system (IWRS). To achieve between-group comparability, the 
randomization was stratified by country and screening MRI/CRP status (i- positive MRI and elevated 
CRP; ii- positive MRI and non-elevated CRP; iii- negative MRI and elevated CRP). Elevated CRP was 
defined as >5.00 mg/L. The target was to enrol a minimum of approximately 20% for each of the 
MRI/CRP strata. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was a double-blind study. Patients, investigators, and all other personnel involved in the conduct 
of the study were blinded to individual treatment assignments. If an investigator decided to use the 
treatment modification of ixekizumab Q2W, study site personnel, the patient, and the study team 
remained blinded to the initial randomisation. Randomisation will remain blinded to study site 
personnel and patients until the final (that is, end of study) clinical trial database lock has occurred. 
Randomisation remained blinded to the Sponsor until the interim clinical trial database lock occurred. 
This interim clinical trial database lock occurred after the last patient completed Visit 15 (Week 52) of 
the study, or the ETV. Unblinding occurred on 01 Apr 2019. The syringes (and contents) containing 
either ixekizumab or placebo were visibly indistinguishable from each other. Randomisation codes 
were generated and emergency unblinding for AEs were allowed to be performed with IWRS, which 
could have supplemented or taken the place of emergency codes generated by a computer drug-
labelling system. This option would have been allowed only if the patient’s well-being required 
knowledge of the patient’s treatment assignment.  
Statistical methods 
Comparisons between each ixekizumab regimen (80 mg Q2W or 80 mg Q4W) and placebo were 
performed for all analyses planned in Period 2. Period 2 (Blinded Treatment Dosing) started at Week 0 
(Visit 2) and ended at Week 52 (Visit 15) or the ETV (between Weeks 0 and 52). An interim database 
lock and unblinding occur as pre-planned with the Period 2 analysis performed after the last patient 
had completed Visit 15 (Week 52) or ETV. This interim database lock included all data collected by the 
Assessment report

Page 91/183 
 
  
 
 
 
 
cut-off date including follow-up data from patients who had begun the Post-Study Follow-Up Period 
(Period 3). The analyses from the Week 52 lock will be treated as a primary analysis because all 
primary and major secondary study objectives will be assessed at this time. 
The primary analysis of efficacy and health outcome were conducted on the intent-to-treat (ITT) 
population including data from all randomised patients. The statistical analysis models were adjusted 
for geographic region and screening MRI/CRP status and treatment groups of ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W 
and 80 mg Q4W were analysed without regard to starting dose.  
Treatment comparisons of categorical efficacy variables, including the analysis of the primary 
endpoint, were made using a logistic regression analysis with treatment, geographic region (Europe 
versus non-Europe), and screening MRI/CRP status in the model. Secondary analysis was conducted 
using a Fisher’s exact test. Patients who did not meet clinical response criteria or had missing data 
were considered non-responders (referred to as non-responder imputation). Patients deemed 
inadequate responders by the investigator based on clinical judgement who stopped their originally 
assigned blinded study treatment and used rescue ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W were also considered non-
responders. 
Treatment comparisons of continuous efficacy variables were based on the MMRM (mixed-effects 
models of repeated measures) analysis method with treatment, geographic region, screening MRI/CRP 
status, baseline value, visit, baseline value-by-visit, and treatment-by-visit interaction as fixed factors 
(except for the analysis of CRP, in which baseline CRP value and baseline value-by-visit were not 
included in the model). The primary analyses for MRI endpoints were made using analysis of 
covariance (ANCOVA) based on observed data. A secondary analysis for all continuous efficacy and 
health outcome variables was made using ANCOVA with the modified baseline observation carried 
forward method.

Results 
Participant flow 
Study RHBX included 303 patients randomised to placebo (105 patients), ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W (96 
patients), or ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W (102 patients). 
Between Weeks 16 and 44, 144 (47.5%) patients were inadequate responders (62 placebo [59.0%], 
40 ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W [41.7%], and 42 ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W [41.2%]), of whom 127 (88.2%) 
patients completed through Week 52.  
A total of 265 (87.5%) patients completed the Blinded Treatment Dosing Period through Week 52, of 
whom 138 (45.5%) patients were on their originally randomised treatment and 127 (41.9%) patients 
were on open label ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W rescue treatment.

Figure 41.  Patient disposition in Study RHBX. 
Of the 303 patients in the ITT population, changes in background therapy while on originally 
randomised treatment were made by 15 patients (5.0%): 
•  7 of 105 patients (6.7%) in the placebo group 
•  6 of 96 patients (6.3%) in the ixekizumab 80-mg Q4W group, and 
•  2 of 102 patients (2.0%) in the ixekizumab 80-mg Q2W group. 
All 15 of the patients who had changes to background therapy also received rescue therapy with open-
label ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W at either the same visit or the next visit. 
Beginning at Week 16 and up to Week 44, investigators could at their own discretion consider whether 
or not an individual patient achieved an adequate treatment response and subsequently modify 
concomitant medications and/or switch to open-label ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W.  
A total of 95.7% of patients completed the Blinded Treatment Dosing Period through Week 16, with no 
difference between the treatment groups.

This study was conducted at 106 study centres in 15 countries. 
Conduct of the study 
There were 2 protocol amendments.  
Protocol amendment (a) - 05 Aug 2016:The main change implemented with this amendment was that 
adjudication of suspected IBD was added to ensure that all reported events were evaluated uniformly 
by a single group in an unbiased manner. Additional changes were made to enhance clarity of the 
protocol.  
Protocol amendment (b) - 05 Oct 2018: The main change made with this amendment was to move 
ASAS40 response at Week 52 from the study’s major secondary objectives to its primary objectives. 
This change was made to accommodate regional regulatory requirements. Additional changes were 
made to enhance clarity of the protocol. 
Baseline data 
Patient demographic and other patient characteristics 
Demographic characteristics, disease history, and baseline characteristics were generally well balanced 
across treatment groups, with the exception of baseline MRI SIJ SPARCC score, which was lower in the 
ixekizumab 80-mg Q4W group than the other groups. 
Demographic characteristics, disease history, and baseline characteristics were consistent with a 
population with nr-axSpA. 
The patient population was predominantly white (79.1%) and under 50 years of age (72.8%). The 
mean age was 40.3 years and there were similar proportions of male and female patients. The mean 
duration of symptoms since axSpA onset was 10.7 years, and 73.7% of patients were HLA-B27 
positive. Disease activity at baseline was high to very high, as reflected by baseline scores for BASDAI 
(7.0 to 7.3) and ASDAS (3.78 to 3.88) and were similar across the treatment groups. 
At baseline,  
•  98.0% of patients had previously used a nonbiologic systemic agent 
•  9.9% had used a nonbiologic nonsystemic agent 
•  38.9% of patients were receiving csDMARDs 
•  13.9% of patients were receiving oral corticosteroids 
•  89.8% of patients were receiving NSAIDs including cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, and 
•  19.1% of patients were receiving analgesics.

rescue, intent-to-treat population 
Effect on ASAS40 of patients switching to rescue therapy 
All patients in the ITT population who switched to open label ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W rescue therapy 
were considered as non-responders after the time of switching, from the analysis perspective, 
regardless of observed response. In addition, despite being judged as IRs by the investigator, many 
patients in the ixekizumab groups had clinically meaningful levels of response on key outcome 
measures at the last visit before biologic rescue, more so than patients in the placebo group. At the 
last visit before biologic rescue, observed ASAS40 response rates were 6.5% in the placebo group, 
and 25% and 16.7% in the ixekizumab 80-mg Q4W and ixekizumab 80-mg Q2W treatment groups, 
respectively.

Although there was allowance for investigators to change background medication for patients who 
may have been perceived to be having an inadequate response, this option was rarely used (less than 
5% of the ITT population).  Patients judged by investigators as IRs were switched to open-label 
ixekizumab most frequently at the first allowed visit (Week 16).

Ancillary analyses 
Efficacy in Subpopulations in Nr-axSpA Studies 
Variables analysed  
Potential differences in response across patient demographic and baseline disease activity variables 
were examined for ASAS40 and ASDAS <2.1 response rates at Week 16. The most clinically relevant 
subgroup variables included  
• 
• 
• 
patient demographics (e.g., sex, age, weight, race)  
disease-related characteristics (e.g., baseline CRP category, baseline ASDAS category, 
baseline BASDAI category, duration of symptoms since axSpA onset), 
concomitant therapy use at baseline (e.g., cDMARD, oral corticosteroid, NSAIDs, analgesics). 
Oral corticosteroid and NSAID subgroup evaluations were post hoc analyses.  
Results of subgroup analyses 
Figure 44.  presents the ASAS40 and ASDAS <2.1 response rates for selected subgroups in Study 
RHBX. The findings from the subgroup analyses were generally consistent with those from the overall 
population, and the treatment effect of ixekizumab was generally consistent across subgroups.

Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
Data from the pivotal Phase 3 studies are presented side-by-side within this section as summarized in 
the Clinical Overview.  According to the applicant, the side-by-side presentation illustrates 
reproducibility and comparability of outcomes. 
Subgroup, immunogenicity, and starting dose data from the 2 pivotal Phase 3 r-axSpA studies (RHBV 
and RHBW) has been integrated into the Primary R-axSpA Analysis Set. 
In addition, immunogenicity data from the 2 pivotal Phase 3 r-axSpA studies (RHBV and RHBW) have 
also been summarised for patients who were initially randomised to ixekizumab at Week 0 and who 
had ixekizumab exposure up to Week 52 during the combined Blinded Dosing and Extended Treatment 
Periods. 
Study Populations 
Disposition 
Completion of the Blinded Treatment Dosing Period through Week 16 for ixekizumab-treated patients 
in the pivotal studies ranged  
• 
• 
• 
from 95.2% to 96.3% in Study RHBV 
from 86.8% to 91.8% in Study RHBW, and  
from 96.1% to 99.0% in Study RHBX. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020

Discontinuation rates through Week 16 were somewhat higher across all treatment groups including 
placebo in Study RHBW (TNFi-experienced patients) relative to Studies RHBV and RHBX 
(bDMARD-naive patients).  Across studies, the most frequent reasons for discontinuation were AEs 
and subject decision. 
Patient Demographics and Other Patient Characteristics

Speed of Onset of Efficacy 
In Studies RHBW and RHBX, greater percentages of patients in both ixekizumab groups versus placebo 
achieved ASAS20 and ASAS40 as early as Week 1. In Study RHBV, the ASAS40 responses in the 
ixekizumab groups were different from the placebo group at Week 2. 
During the procedure, the MAH provided the time course of ASAS40 response, which indicates that the 
response reaches plateau by Week 16 to 20 (Figure 45. ).

Supportive study 
Study RHBY is a long-term extension study with a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised 
withdrawal–retreatment period, enrolling patients who completed any of the 3 pivotal Phase 3 studies and 
met eligibility criteria. At the time of this Type II variation, Study RHBY was ongoing, and the periods 
where patients participated in the double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomised withdrawal–retreatment 
were still blinded.   
2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Ixekizumab, a IL-17A-inhibitor, is approved for plaque psoriasis and PsA. This application aims to extend 
the indication to treatment of active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA); including both radiographic (r-
axSpA) and non-radiographic disease (nr-axSpA). According to the proposed SmPC, the recommended 
posology is a bolus dose of 160 mg, followed by 80 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 weeks.

Design and conduct of main clinical studies 
The MAH has conducted 3 pivotal studies in 930 adult patients with axSpA axial: 2 studies in patients with 
r-axSpA (RHBV and RHBW) and 1 study in patients with nr-axSpA (RHBX). All three studies have a 
randomized, double blind, parallel group design with a screening period of up to 42 days followed by 
randomisation, testing two different dose regimens of Ixekizumab (80mg Q2W or 80mg Q4W) with or 
without a bolus dose of 160 mg. One study (RHBV) also included an active comparator, adalimumab 
40mg Q2W. The placebo-controlled period was 16 weeks in the two r-axSpA studies (RHBV, RHBW) and 
52 weeks in the nr-axSpA study (RHBX). In all three studies, the primary endpoint, ASAS 40, was 
measured at week 16.    
The MAH has essentially followed the recommendation of the EMA clinical guidance for AS (Guideline on 
clinical investigation for the treatment of ankylosing spondylitis, CPMP/EWP/4891/03) in the clinical 
development programme. In addition to using ASAS 40 as a primary endpoint, the MAH has examined 
several secondary endpoints which explores structural damage, mobility and patient reported Health 
outcomes, all in line with the guideline. The scales used in the studies are acceptable, as were the cut of 
values used for ASDAS. 
The MAH has received a central scientific advice (EMA/CHMP/SAWP/339078/2011) and the advice has 
overall been adhered to.  
The MAH provided accurate details that the Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP. 
The study populations in all phase 3 studies consisted of adults with active axSpA with a history of prior 
therapy for axSpA of at least 12 weeks and an inadequate response or intolerance to NSAID. This was not 
clearly expressed in the initial indication text, but upon CHMP’s request, the MAH has changed the 
indication text to better align with the intended population (cf discussion below). 
Disease activity was based on measurements of BASDAI (>=4) and spinal pain (>=4) which are in line 
with guideline. The ASAS criteria for spondylarthritis was the main inclusion criteria in all three studies 
with the specification that in the two studies examining patient with R-axSpA (RHBV and RHBW), all 
patients also fulfilled the radiological criteria of the modified New York criteria for AS (i.e. evidence of 
sacroiliitis on plain X-ray). The modified New York criteria have been used in previous studies examining 
patient with radiographic axSpA and are also the criteria recommended in the EMA guideline for this 
group.  
In study RHBX, examining patients with nR-axSpA, eligible subjects were requested to have objective 
signs of inflammation, specified as sacroiliitis on MRI or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). Please see 
discussion in relation to the proposed indication below. 
Overall, the proportion of screening failures were high in the main clinical studies; between 40-55%. The 
MAH provided clarifications on the reasons for screening failures mainly due to not meeting the x-ray 
eligibility criteria or having insufficient disease activity in r-AxSpA studies. In the nr-axSpA study, the 
main reason for screening failure was not meeting the ASAS criteria for axSpA, absence of objective signs 
of inflammation and presence of definite radiographic sacroiliitis by central reading. The CHMP considered 
that this doesn’t have significant impact on the representativeness of the studied population for the 
proposed indication.   
Statistical considerations with regards to the phase III studies  
Study RHBV and study RHBW (r-axSpA) 
Studies RHBV and RHBW shared a number of features based on similarities in design and definition of 
endpoints. In both studies, there were two interim database locks planned for analyses based on data 
collected up to week 16 and up to week 52, respectively. Two separate CSRs have been submitted 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 133/183 
 
  
  
referring in turn to two versions of the statistical analysis plan. The primary analysis was performed 
based on week 16 data. Though described as an interim analysis, the submitted dossiers contain full 
information on the primary efficacy endpoints (which were evaluated at week 16 for EU registration) for 
each study, so there is no need for a statistical adjustment to account for the ‘interim’ analysis. Each trial 
is currently in the open-label long-term extension phase. The primary objective and major secondary 
objectives comprised comparisons between ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W and 80 mg Q4W respectively, and 
placebo. The primary analysis was based on the ITT population including all randomised patients. The 
analyses further reflected the restrictions at randomisation in adjusting for the stratification factors. In 
study RHBV, the last secondary efficacy objective was to test assay sensitivity by comparing adalimumab 
40 mg Q2W with placebo. No statistical comparisons were planned between ixekizumab and adalimumab; 
the lack of head-to-head comparisons between the two active treatments is acceptable. 
In both studies RHBV and RHBW, the primary endpoint was the proportion of patients achieving 
treatment success, defined as achieving ASAS40 at Week 16 while still on randomised treatment. For 
responder analyses, a non-responder imputation was used which is non-controversial. An analysis using 
all available data irrespective of whether a patient discontinued randomised treatment or not have been 
presented supporting the primary endpoint analysis. For continuous endpoints, the primary analyses as 
based on MMRM and relying on the missing at random assumption (MAR) could be criticised, depending 
however on the missing data pattern. Here, the proportions of subjects who did not complete the blinded 
treatment period through week 16 were non-substantial and similar between treatment arms although 
higher in study RHBW than in study RHBV. A number of additional analyses using alternative approaches 
were planned. While the underlying assumptions and statistical properties of the LOCF and mBOCF 
analyses could be questioned, the MAH provided also sensitivity analyses using placebo-based imputation 
and tipping point analyses which are acceptable by CHMP. 
A graphical multiple-testing procedure was implemented for the primary objective and major secondary 
objectives to control the family-wise type I error rate at a 2-sided alpha level of 0.05. A similar approach 
was used for all three studies albeit with some differences in number of major secondary endpoints and 
their definition; there were also differences in weights (i.e. how alpha was allocated within the multiple 
testing procedure). As described graphically, the multiple testing procedure, irrespective of study (RHBV, 
RHBW and RHBX) is acceptable. There was no multiplicity adjustment for the other secondary 
endpoints. The latter implies that no formal claims can be made regarding e.g. long-term efficacy (week 
52 analyses). For e.g. the primary endpoint, uncontrolled ASAS40 response rates for weeks 16, 36 and 
52 for each ixekizumab arm have been presented based on the ITT population with patients with missing 
observations imputed as non-responders. This approach is agreed. The proportion of patients who lacked 
ASAS40 observations at week 52 was approximately 10% in study RHBV and 20% in study RHBW and 
similar in the ixekizumab Q2W and Q4W arm, respectively. 
In both studies, the primary analysis was performed ignoring the two different ixekizumab starting doses. 
Separate, non-powered, not multiplicity adjusted analyses were planned in order to assess the impact of 
ixekizumab starting dose of 160 mg versus 80 mg on treatment response at Week 16 and time to onset 
of action. Based on these analyses, no firm conclusions can be drawn. 
Study RHBX (nr-axSpA) 
The analyses planned as described in the study RHBX protocol were similar to those planned for both 
Studies RHBV and RHBW and seem appropriate. The SAP had not been submitted initially and was 
therefore requested. The SAP has then been provided and confirmed that all details concerning the 
graphical multiple testing scheme had been pre-defined. 
Analogous to studies RHBV and study RHBW, a secondary objective was to explore the effect of starting 
dose (160 mg compared to 80 mg) on onset of action and treatment response. However, with a limited 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 134/183 
 
  
  
sample size since not powered and without being otherwise formally planned, no firm conclusions can be 
drawn. 
Contrary to studies RHBV and RHBW, study RHBX had a double-blind, placebo-controlled treatment 
period of 52 weeks. To meet different regulatory requirements, there were two separate primary 
endpoints that were tested independently: proportion of patients achieving an ASAS40 response at either 
Week 16, which is in line with the relevant EMA guideline, or Week 52 implying two separate lists of 
primary and major secondary endpoints with multiplicity adjustment within each of the lists using the 
graphical multiple testing procedure. For the week 16 analysis, the multiple testing procedure included 
the primary endpoint and five major secondary endpoints with all comparisons planned and performed at 
Week 16. Analyses based on comparisons week 52 were not multiplicity adjusted and formal claims 
regarding long-term efficacy is not appropriate albeit this study offered comparisons versus placebo. 
Exclusively for study RHBX and as a consequence of the one-year placebo-controlled treatment period, 
subjects identified by investigators as showing inadequate response based on clinical judgment could 
initiate rescue treatment with ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W starting from week 16. Therefore, an Inadequate 
Responder (IR) population was defined and used for selected safety and efficacy summaries. This 
population included a total of 47.5% (144/303) of randomised subjects. In the placebo group, this 
concerned 59.0% (62/105), in the ixekizumab Q4W arm 41.7% (40/96) and in the ixekizumab Q2W arm 
41.2% (42/102). Outcomes presented based on the IR population were summarized by originally 
assigned treatment group without inferential statistics. This is supported since these were not randomised 
comparisons. Given the high proportion of subjects classified as inadequate responders also in the two 
ixekizumab arms, the MAH was requested to present time to inadequate response and/or treatment 
discontinuation. The provided Kaplan-Meier plot for time to open-label treatment of ixekizumab 80 mg 
Q2W by originally assigned treatment group confirmed that most of the patients who switched to open-
label ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W did so at Week 16, the earliest time point that a switch to open-label 
ixekizumab Q2W or an adjustment of non-biologic background medication was allowed.  
Due to the design of study RHBX, there was a dramatic drop in the number of subjects after Week 16 
which may impact on the robustness of the week 52 data.  The MAH considered that the approach to 
detect treatment differences was robust and reliable because of the lack of bias toward any treatment 
group. This was, according to the MAH, due to the blinded nature of the study, the conservative approach 
to qualifying patients as “non-responder” and conservative non-responder imputation (NRI) method for 
missing data imputation, together with  the inclusion of all randomised patients in the analyses at visits 
after Week 16. It is acceptable by CHMP that this is conservative for the estimation of efficacy within a 
treatment group but is not necessarily true for between group comparisons. 
Concerning all three studies, RHBV, RHBW and RHBX, the MAH was requested to revise the 
presentation of outcomes in section 5.1 in the SmPC to better align with the primary analysis of each of 
the study and hence the multiplicity protected outcomes of the primary and major secondary outcomes.  
Other secondary analyses not multiplicity adjusted including a post-hoc analysis performed in study RHBV 
had been included and there was much focus on p-values and confidence intervals were lacking. The 
section 5.1 is in line with the primary analysis of each study including also 95% CIs. 
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
Main data from the three pivotal clinical studies 
In Study RHBV, 341 TNF-inhibitor naive r-axSpA patients were randomized to 1 of 4 treatment groups 
(Ixekizumab 80mg Q2W, Ixekizumab 80mg Q4W, placebo or Adalimumab 40 mg Q2W). In addition, the 
patient in the two Ixekizumab group were randomized 1:1 to receive a bolus dose of 160 mg Ixekizumab. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020

Demographic and baseline disease characteristics were generally comparable between the 4 groups. After 
16 weeks, patients in the placebo and Adalimumab group were randomized to receive Ixekizumab 80mg 
Q2W or 80mg Q4W, with or without a bolus dose of 160 mg. 
The study met the primary and all major secondary endpoints. The difference in clinical response vs 
placebo was for both tested doses of the drug both statistically and clinically relevant. The outcomes of 
the secondary endpoints were in line with the outcome of the primary endpoint. A bolus dose of 160mg 
did not seem to result in earlier or better response. 
The primary endpoint, ASAS 40 response at week 16, was reached for 48% of the patient treated with 
Ixekizumab 80mg Q4W and for 52% of the patient treated with Ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W. Among the 
patients treated with placebo, 18% reached ASAS 40 at week 16. In the Adalimumab 40mg Q2W group, 
36% reached ASAS 40 response. The study was not designed to test non-inferiority of Ixekizumab 
compared to Adalimumab. 
Numerically higher response rate compared to placebo was observed already after one week and for the 
patients initially randomized to ixekizumab, the effect appeared to be sustained during the extended 
study period, 52 weeks.  
In study RHBW, 316 TNF-inhibitor experienced r-axSpA patients were randomized to 1 of 3 
treatments group (Ixekizumab 80mg Q2W, Ixekizumab 80mg Q4W or placebo). In addition, patients in 
the two Ixekizumab groups were randomized 1:1 to receive a bolus dose of 160 mg Ixekizumab. 
Demographics and disease characteristics were generally the same between groups. 62.9% of the 
patients had received one previous TNF-inhibitor and 37.1% of the patients had received 2 TNF inhibitors. 
As in the RHBV study, patients in the placebo arm were randomised at week 16 to receive Ixekizumab 
80mg Q2W or 80mg Q4W, with or without a bolus dose of 160 mg. 
The inclusion criteria in study RHBW lists patients who have had an inadequate response following at 
least 12 weeks of treatment. The term “inadequate response” relative to prior TNFi exposure includes 
both patients who never achieved an adequate response, as well as patients who had initially responded 
and then lost response.  
Statistically significant differences were observed for the primary endpoint and most major secondary 
endpoints at Week 16 for each ixekizumab treatment group compared to the placebo group. Not only 
statistically significant but also clinically relevant differences vs placebo was noted for both tested doses 
of ixekizumab vs placebo with regards to the primary endpoint. For the primary endpoint, the difference 
between the two doses of ixekizumab was relatively small. In both dose groups, the clinical response 
seemed to be maintained up to 1 year.  
The primary efficacy endpoint of ASAS 40 response at week 16 was achieved for 30.6% in the 
Ixekizumab 80mg Q2W group, 25.4% Ixekixumab 80mg Q4W and 12.5% Placebo. The lower response 
rate in TNF-inhibitor experienced patients compared to naïve patients is expected.  
In this patient group, a bolus dose of 160 mg was associated with a numerically improved efficacy at 
earlier timepoint across several parameters, including spinal pain, disease activity, function and HR-QoL. 
For example, ASAS20 response at week 2 for the 80mg Q4W group was 44.4% in the 160 mg starting 
dose group vs 26.7% in the 80 mg starting dose group.  
Numerically greater ASAS20 and ASAS40 responses were observed in each ixekizumab treatment group, 
compared to the placebo group, regardless of the number of prior TNFi used. Additional analyses clarified 
that the response rates were consistently numerically higher for each ixekizumab regimen versus placebo 
in the subgroup of patients with 1 prior TNFi, as well as in the subgroup of patients with 2 prior TNFi’s.   
In study RHBX, 303 patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis were randomized to 1 of 
3 treatments group (Ixekizumab 80mg Q2W, Ixekizumab 80mg Q4W or placebo). After week 16, non-
Assessment report

Page 136/183 
 
  
  
responders (as determined by the treating physician) in all three groups were offered rescue therapy with 
open-label Ixekizumab 80mg Q2W. 
Statistically significant improvements in efficacy were observed for each of the ixekizumab treatment 
groups vs placebo across the primary and all major secondary objectives. The magnitude of improvement 
vs placebo with regards to the primary endpoint ASAS40 at week 16 is considered clinically relevant for 
both tested doses of Ixekizumab. The numerical difference between the two dose groups was relatively 
small and not considered clinically relevant. There seem to be no beneficial effect of giving a bolus dose 
of 160 mg. 
The primary efficacy endpoint of ASAS 40 response at week 16 was achieved for by 40.2% in the 
Ixekizumab 80mg Q2W, 35.4% Ixekixumab in the 80mg Q4W and in the 19.0% Placebo group. The effect 
was seen as early as week 1 and seem to be maintained up to week 52.  
The placebo-controlled period in study RHBX was 52 weeks, but between week 16 and 44, patients could 
be offered rescue treatment if their treating physician classified the patient as a non-responder 
irrespectively of whether the study endpoints were achieved or no. Of the 265 patients (87,5%) who 
completed 52 weeks, 45,5% were still on their originally randomized treatment and 127 patients (41,9%) 
were on open label ixekizumab Q2W rescue treatment. Of the patients classified as inadequate 
responders between week 16 and 44, 52% was originally randomized to placebo, 41.2 % to ixekizumab 
2QW and 41.7 % to ixekizumab Q4W. The proportion of patients originally randomized to ixekizumab 
receiving rescue-treatment with open label ixekizumab was surprisingly high. The MAH argued that 
despite being classified as an inadequate responder by the physician at week 16 (last visit before rescue), 
16.5% patients in the 2QW group, 25% patients in the Q4W group and 6.5% of the placebo group had 
indeed reached the endpoint of ASAS40 at that timepoint. The MAH clarified that the decision to “rescue” 
a patient was solely based on the treating physicians’ judgement and not based on any specific 
predefined outcome measure. The CRP values were blinded beyond baseline through week 52 and the 
lack of access to CRP values may have led treating physicians to take a rather conservative approach to 
rescue in the best interest of the patient. The MAH clarification is considered acceptable by CHMP.  
A few statistically significant treatment-by-subgroup interactions were identified in each of the pivotal 
studies. The applicant has adequately discussed these, and it has been concluded that there are no 
clinical meaningful implications of these findings mainly due to the small sample size in the subgroup 
analyses.  
Data to support proposed indication 
The three successful main studies include adult patients with active axSpA (r-axSpA and nr-axSpA) with a 
history of prior axSpA-therapy of at least 12 weeks and an inadequate response or intolerance to NSAID. 
Thus, the studied population is essentially restricted to subjects with prior experience of conventional 
treatment. At the CHMP’s request, the MAH has revised the wording of the indication both in patients with 
radiographic and non-radiographic axSpA to better reflect the intended population.  
In study RHBX, examining patients with nR-axSpA eligible subjects were requested to have objective 
signs of inflammation, specified as sacroiliitis on MRI or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). At the CHMP’s 
request, the MAH added “as indicated by elevated CRP and / or MRI”, to the indication wording for 
patients with nR-axSpA for clarification. 
Data to support proposed posology 
In all three main studies, an early effect response was seen already after 1-2 weeks. The response was 
still increasing during the first months but some of the patients did not receive any beneficial effect of 
ixekizumab. Upon request, the MAH provided time-course information reporting a plateau of ASAS40 
response by week 16. This information is now included in the SmPC.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 137/183 
 
  
  
Based on the more rapid response after induction observed in study RHBW that included a AS TNF-ir 
population, the MAH initially proposed an induction dose of 160mg in this sub-group, but not in the TNF-
naïve or nr-AxSpA population. However, upon request, the MAH provided a discussion of pros and cons 
for recommending the bolus dose to all patients. The conclusion was since both psoriatic arthritis and 
axSpA are part of the same disease spectrum (spondyloarthritis) and there were no impact on the safety 
profile (except for a numerically higher number of hepatic event, described as transient asymptomatic 
laboratory changes in aminotransferases), harmonizing the dose regimen between the spondyloarthritis 
and recommending a 160 mg bolus dose in all these patients is appropriate. This is acceptable by CHMP. 
In study RHBX, at week 16, and up to week 44, it was possible to switch patients that were considered to 
be non-responders to the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W treatment, and the MAH was asked to discuss whether 
a dose escalation would benefit these patients not responding to the lower dose. Descriptive data on 
ASAS40, ASDAS and BASDAI indicated a slight trend in favour of a dose escalation. However, it is 
acknowledged by CHMP that study RHBX was not designed for testing the effect of switching treatment 
and that the provided information is thus not considered sufficient to support a dose escalation. 
In nr-axSpA in particular, it is not established whether treatment in a well responding patient should be 
continued on a chronic basis, or whether dose tapering or even treatment discontinuation can be 
considered at some point. The MAH indicated to currently collect randomised withdrawal data in the 
ongoing study RHBY. The MAH has committed, based on CHMP’s recommendation, to submit the results 
post-approval, in line with the EU Guideline on axSpA. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
All three phase III studies met the primary endpoint of superiority over placebo in ASAS 40 response rate 
at week 16. In addition, most major secondary endpoints (evaluating disease activity, objective signs of 
inflammation, function and patient reported quality of life) were achieved.  
The initially proposed indication targeted all subjects with active axSpA, although the studied populations 
were restricted to subjects with prior experience of conventional treatment. At the CHMP’s request, the 
MAH has revised the indication for both the r-axSpA and nr-axSpA populations to reflect the intended 
population.  
In study RHBX, examining patients with nR-axSpA eligible subjects were requested to have objective 
signs of inflammation, specified as sacroiliitis on MRI or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). At the CHMP’s 
request, the MAH added “as indicated by elevated CRP and / or MRI”, to the indication wording for 
patients with nR-axSpA for clarification. 
The wording of the final indication is as follows:  
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
Taltz is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis who have 
responded inadequately to conventional therapy. 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Taltz is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs). 
The proposed posology, 80 mg 4QW with a bolus dose of 160 mg to all patients, was considered

2.5.  Clinical safety 
Introduction 
For this submission, the applicant summarized safety data from 2 integrated analysis sets: The 
Placebo-Controlled axSpA Integrated Analysis Set and the All axSpA Ixekizumab Exposures 
Integrated Analysis Set, as described below: 
• 
The Placebo-Controlled axSpA Integrated Analysis Set included patient data from the 2 
randomised, Phase 3, r-axSpA placebo-controlled studies (Studies RHBV and RHBW) and from the 
randomised, Phase 3, nr-axSpA placebo-controlled study (Study RHBX) from screening up 
through Week 16.  The term “Placebo-Controlled Blinded Treatment Dosing Period (Weeks 0 to 
16)” to this period of interest. For Study RHBX, the Blinded Treatment Dosing Period included a 
52-week, blinded, placebo-controlled period, but only Weeks 0 to 16 were integrated in this data 
set to be consistent with the design, patient management, and data collection of the other 2 
studies. Adalimumab treatment group was not included in this integrated analysis set as this 
treatment group was included only in Study RHBV and not in Studies RHBW and RHBX. 
• 
The All axSpA Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set (termed the “All axSpA 
Analysis Set”) included all available ixekizumab data from Studies RHBV, RHBW, and RHBX, as 
well as data from patients receiving open-label ixekizumab in Study RHBY.   
The safety population, defined as all randomised patients who received at least 1 dose of study 
treatment, was used in each of the integrated analysis sets.

Patient Disposition 
Placebo-Controlled axSpA Integrated Analysis Set 
Of the 868 patients in the safety population of the Placebo-Controlled axSpA Integrated Analysis Set  
During Weeks 0 to 16,  35 (6.1%) ixekizumab-treated patients and 18 (6.1%) placebo-treated patients 
discontinued study drug. The most common reasons for discontinuation were subject decision and AEs. 
Demographic and Other Characteristics of Study Population 
The  patients  were  predominantly  male  (total  IXE,  69.2%,  placebo,  68.4%),  White  (total  IXE,  76.1%; 
placebo,  72.4%),  and  human  leucocyte  antigen  B27  (HLA-B27)-positive  (total  IXE,  81.3%;  placebo, 
81.5%). Between the Total Ixekizumab (total IXE) and placebo groups, baseline characteristics were similar 
with respect to mean age at baseline (total IXE, 42.7 years; placebo, 43.1 years), age of onset (total IXE, 
28.2 years; placebo, 28 years) duration of axSpA symptoms total IXE,(14.84 years; placebo, 15.45 years),  
and mean body weight. At baseline, percentage of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) (including 
cyclooxygenase-2  [COX-2]  inhibitors),  conventional  disease-modifying  antirheumatic  drug  (cDMARDs; 
methotrexate, sulfasalazine, or hydroxychloroquine), oral corticosteroid, and analgesic (systemic opioids 
and/or short-acting analgesics with no anti-inflammatory effect) use was similar between the 2 groups: 
Use  of  NSAIDs  (total  IXE,  84.5%;  placebo,  87.4%),  cDMARDs  (total  IXE,  34.5%;  placebo,  33.7%), 
conventional  oral  corticosteroids  (total  IXE,  12.0%;  placebo,  11.6%)  and  analgesics  (total  IXE,  23.9%; 
placebo, 22.4%) was similar between the two groups. 
Prespecified medical history of interest included colitis ulcerative (total IXE, 1.6%; placebo, 1.4%), Crohn’s 
disease (total IXE 0.2% placebo 0.7%), Iridocyclitis (total IXE 18.6%; placebo, 18.0%) and Psoriasis (total 
IXE 8.9%; placebo 9.5%).  
Historical illnesses of interest included colitis ulcerative (total IXE, 0.7%; placebo, 0%), Crohn’s disease: 
(total IXE, 0.2%; placebo, 0.3%), Iridocyclitis (total IXE, 16.7%; placebo, 16.0%) and Psoriasis (total IXE, 
0.9%; placebo, 1.0%). 
Pre-existing conditions and AEs occurring prior to the first dose of treatment included Colitis ulcerative 
(total IXE, 0.9%; placebo, 1.4% ),  Crohn’s disease( total IXE, 0.2%; placebo, 0.7%),  Iridocyclitis ( total 
IXE, 1.9%; placebo, 2.0%) and  Psoriasis (total IXE, 8.5%; placebo, 9.5). 
Adverse events 
Overview of Adverse Events in Individual Studies 
The tables below (00) show the AEs reported during the Placebo-Controlled Blinded Treatment Dosing 
Period (Weeks 0 to 16) of the r-axSpA studies (RHBV and RHBW) and the nr-axSpA study (RHBX) in 
side-by-side displays.  
The safety findings from the axSpA clinical programme were considered by the applicant consistent with 
respect to TEAEs, SAEs, AE of special interests with the known safety profile of the ixekizumab clinical 
programme in Ps and PsA.  
Within the axSpA programme, the safety profile was considered consistent between the individual studies 
in r-axSpA and nr-axSpA with the exception of more frequent reports of Injection Site Reactions (HLT) in 
the nr-axSpA study when comparing by specific ixekizumab regimens as well as by total IXE group. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 143/183 
 
  
  
 
However, no difference was noted in the severity or type of Injection Site Reactions (HLT) in the 
nr-axSpA study relative to the r-axSpA studies nor relative to the ixekizumab clinical programme (that is, 
Ps, PsA, and axSpA). Higher frequencies of TEAEs, SAEs, and treatment discontinuation due to AEs were, 
according to the applicant, noted in the TNFi-experienced patients in the r-axSpA Study RHBW. The prior 
use of anti-TNF-treatment were considered to have potentially contributed to this. The frequencies for the 
total IXE group in the nr-axSpA study (18.7% for Weeks 0 to 16) were considered within the range of 
Injection Site Reactions reported across the entire ixekizumab clinical programme although they were 
higher than the frequency reported for the total IXE group in the r-axSpA studies (8.5% [Study RHBV] 
and 11.8% [Study RHBW] for Weeks 0 to 16). In particular, the percentage of patients who reported 
Injection Site Reaction TEAEs in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W group (15.6%) and ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W 
group (21.6%) at Weeks 0 to 16 in the nr-axSpA study was higher compared with the corresponding 
groups in the r-axSpA studies (Q4W: 3.7% Q2W: 13.3%% [RHBV]; Q4W: 7.9%; Q2W: 16.3% [RHBW]).  
The summary of adverse events for the All axSpA Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set updated 
with available since the time of database lock for Studies RHBW and RHBX data was provided upon 
request from CHMP  (Table 44 ). The safety profile remained consistent with safety profile of ixekizumab 
axSpA Safety Population presented in the original application.

The AE profile for the nr-axSpA study up to Week 52 and prior to biologic rescue is considered to remain 
consistent with that of Weeks 0 to 16. 
Up to Week 52 and prior to biologic rescue, Injection Site Reactions were reported more in the 
ixekizumab-treated patients than in placebo-treated patients. According to the applicant, there were no 
clinically meaningful findings between the treatment groups with regard to cytopaenia, 
cerebro-cardiovascular events, including MACE and malignancies, or interstitial lung disease (ILD). The 
applicant concluded that with the exception of more frequent reports of Injection Site Reactions, the 
results from the r-axSpA and nr-axSpA studies were consistent; these findings are also consistent with 
the known safety profile of the ixekizumab clinical programme. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
In the Placebo-controlled axSpA integrated analysis set, 10 (1.7%) ixekizumab-treated patients and 6 
(2.0%) placebo-treated patients had at least 1 SAE.  The reported events were:

Two deaths were reported as of the data cut off of 01 Apr 2019.  
One death was reported in Study RHBW during the Placebo-Controlled Blinded Treatment Dosing Period 
(Weeks 0 to 16). The patient, a 36-year old male, committed suicide 54 days after the first dose of

ixekizumab and 26 days after the last dose of ixekizumab (80 mg at Weeks 0, 2, and 4).  The patient was 
intoxicated and committed suicide via gunshot.  The patient was diagnosed by his primary care physician 
with mild depression approximately 11 months before starting study drug and had been medicated with 
duloxetine since the diagnosis. The patient had no personal history of substance abuse, aggressive 
behaviour toward self or others, victim of abuse or neglect, preceding psychomotor restlessness, or major 
life changes, nor did the patient have a family history of mental illness.  No signs or symptoms of suicidal 
ideation, suicidal thoughts, or suicidal behaviors were identified during the study.  The blinded 
investigator assessed the event as not related to study drug. 
The second death was reported in a 30-year-old, male patient who participated in Study RHBY (after 
completing Study RHBX) about 9 months after starting study treatment.  It was believed that the patient 
was murdered because of drug trafficking issues.  This information was obtained by third parties (unable 
to confirm). The site had no documentary evidence of the death of the patient or the circumstances in 
which it occurred.  The investigator stated that for security reasons, they would not try to obtain, by any 
means, more information about what happened in this case.  The investigator considered the event of 
death (believed murdered due to drug trafficking issues) unrelated to study drugs or to protocol 
procedure. 
One further death was reporter after data cut-off date for this submission in a 77-year-old, white, male 
patient who completed Study RHBW and enrolled in Study RHBY. The patient was hospitalised with a 
diagnosis of sepsis, which was considered life-threatening, approximately 1 year and 1 month (21 May 
2019) after beginning open-label study drug in Period 1 of Study RHBY.  Head, thorax, and abdominal 
and pelvic scans were negative; abdominal x-ray revealed dilation of the gastrointestinal loops, possibly 
the small intestine, testifying to picture of possible subocclusion. Treatment included unspecified 
intravenous antibiotics in the intensive care unit for supportive care (as family refused respiratory 
support).  Two days later, the patient died due to the SAE of sepsis (Streptococcus group C on 
haemocultures) based on probable pneumonia with multiorgan failure (acute renal failure, increase 
troponin, and respiratory distress).  No change was made with the open-label study drug in response to 
the event prior to death.  An autopsy was not performed.  In the opinion of the investigator, the sepsis 
was not related to open-label study drug in Period 1 of Study RHBY or protocol procedures; however the 
sepsis was considered to be related to open-label study drug in Period 2 of Study RHBY because biologic 
drugs could increase the risk of infection and the patient had symptoms following injection of study drugs. 
Adverse Events of Special Interest  
Infections  
Placebo-Controlled axSpA Integrated Analysis Set  
TEAEs:  A higher percentage of ixekizumab-treated patients (n = 143 [24.9%]) reported at least 1 
infection-related TEAE compared with placebo-treated patients (n = 46 [15.6%]).  Both ixekizumab 
treatment groups had a higher percentage of patients with these TEAEs compared with the placebo 
group, and according to the applicant, no meaningful difference was observed between the ixekizumab 
treatment groups in the frequency of infection-related TEAEs. 
•  66 patients (23.3%), ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W; 
•  77 patients (26.5%), ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W; 
•  46 patients (15.6%), placebo. 
Most of the infections were mild or moderate in severity; there was 1 patient in each of the ixekizumab 
treatment groups who reported at least 1 severe infection-related TEAE.  Nasopharyngitis and Upper 
respiratory tract infection were the most often reported infections in the total IXE treatment group.  No

cases of active TB were reported.  There were 2 (0.7%) patients in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W with 
Herpes zoster infection (1 mild and 1 moderate) and 1 (0.3%) patient in the placebo group with mild 
Herpes zoster; there were no ophthalmic or disseminated cases identified.  There was 1 (0.4%) patient in 
the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group with mild Oesophageal candidiasis. 
SAEs:  Infection-related SAEs were reported for 4 (0.7%) ixekizumab-treated patients 
(Q2W, Gastroenteritis; Q4W, Peritonitis, Pharyngitis, and Urinary tract infection).  
Discontinuations due to AE:  Three (0.5%) ixekizumab-treated patients discontinued study treatment due 
to an infection-related AE (Q2W, Diarrhoea infectious; Q4W, Diverticulitis and Peritonitis  
Candida infections:  Mild Candida infections were reported by 3 (0.5%) ixekizumab-treated patients 
(Q4W, Vulvovaginal candidiasis; Q2W, Genital candidiasis and Oesophageal candidiasis) and 2 (0.7%) 
placebo-treated patients (Vulvovaginal candidiasis and Oral candidiasis).  There were no reports of deep 
organ or bloodstream infections  
Opportunistic infections:  Opportunistic infections (narrow terms) were reported by 3 (0.5%) 
ixekizumab-treated patients (Q2W, Oesophageal candidiasis; Q4W, 2 patients with Herpes zoster).  In the 
placebo group, 1 patient reported an OI of Herpes zoster. 
All axSpA Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set 
TEAEs:  In the All axSpA Analysis Set, 478 (51.5%) patients had an infection-related TEAE.  The majority

Immunogenicity 
Analyses of the relationship between TEAEs and TE-ADA status over time were conducted for 2 specific 
AEs of special interest:  allergic reactions/hypersensitivity events (anaphylaxis or non-anaphylaxis 
[immediate and non-immediate]) and Injection Site Reactions.   
Allergic Reactions/Hypersensitivities 
There were no confirmed cases of anaphylaxis in All axSpA Ixekizumab Exposures integrated Analysis 
Set. All reported allergic reactions/hypersensitivities cases were non anaphylaxis (immediate or 
non-immediate) in nature.  
In the pooled ixekizumab treatment group, 69 (8.3%) TE-ADA-negative patients reported at least 1 non 
anaphylaxis TEAE (immediate, 18 patients; nonimmediate, 54 patients) and 5 (5.7%) TE-ADA-positive 
patient reported at least 1 non anaphylaxis TEAE (non-immediate, 5 patients).  Of these 5 patients, 4 had 
the TEAEs occurred only during periods where TE-ADA were not present, and 1 patient had the TEAEs 
occurred during periods where TE-ADA was present. This patient was TE-ADA positive beginning 
approximately 8 months prior to the non-anaphylaxis TEAE, without events reported during that period.  
Injection Site Reactions 
In the pooled ixekizumab treatment group in All axSpA Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set, 
127 (15.3%) TE-ADA-negative patients reported at least 1 Injection Site Reactions TEAE. A total of 26 
(29.9%) TE-ADA-positive patients reported at least 1 Injection Site Reactions TEAE:  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 162/183 
 
  
  
 
 
•  13 patients had events only when TE-ADA were not present.  All events (Injection site reaction, 
Injection site erythema, Injection site pruritus) were mild in severity and did not re-occur after 
the development of TE-ADA 
•  12 patients started reporting events before the detection of TE-ADA and continued to report the 
same type of events after the development of TE-ADA (at low titer in 7 patients, at moderate titer 
in 1 patient and both low and moderate titers in 4 patients).  All events were mild (9 patients) or 
moderate (3 patients) in severity, with no increase in severity after the development of TE-ADA.  
In 2 patients, the events decreased in severity (from moderate to mild) after the development of 
TE-ADA, and 
•  1 patient had mild events of Injection site hypersensitivity only when TE-ADA were present. This 
patient had a single TE-ADA-positive result (titer 1:10) on study Day 15 and reported the events 
on study Days 13 and 15.  
TEAEs and Pharmacokinetic Analyses 
Exposure-safety data were integrated across the 3 axSpA studies in the clinical development programme 
(Studies RHBV, RHBW, and RHBX) for analysis. According to the applicant, there was no apparent 
relationship between ixekizumab trough concentrations (Ctrough) at Week 16 and the overall incidence of 
TEAEs during the first 16 weeks of the double-blind period, nor specifically with infections or allergic 
reactions/hypersensitivity events within the range of concentrations observed across these studies. There 
was a trend for an exposure-response relationship between Ctrough and injection site reactions, although 
the incidence in the ixekizumab groups was lowest in Quartile 2 which was comparable to the placebo 
group. According to the applicant, the incidences of the AEs of special interest of Infections (Candida, 
herpes, staphylococcal, and infections reported as SAEs), hypersensitivity reactions (anaphylaxis), 
neutropaenia, MACE, and IBD were too small, thus, would not allow for an evaluation of the relationship 
to ixekizumab drug concentrations.  
In general, these findings are consistent with findings in the Ps, and PsA populations where there is an 
overall lack of a relationship between concentrations and TEAEs and AEs of special interest, except for 
Injection Site Reactions.   
Laboratory findings 
Clinical laboratory assessments, including haematology, serum chemistry, and urinalysis, were performed 
as scheduled per protocol.   
Cytopenias and hepatic events are discussed in the adverse events of special interest. 
Haematology Laboratory Tests 
The findings were consistent between the Placebo-Controlled AxSpA Integrated Analysis Set and the All 
AxSpA Analysis Set and were found consistent with the known safety profile of ixekizumab in other 
indications. 
Chemistry Laboratory Tests 
There were no clinically important changes in chemistry parameters. Any observed differences were 
considered unremarkable and unlikely to represent clinically meaningful differences. The findings from the 
All AxSpA Analysis Set were consistent with the Placebo-Controlled AxSpA Integrated Analysis Set and 
considered consistent with the known safety profile of ixekizumab.   
Hepatic Laboratory Tests 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 163/183 
 
  
  
In the Placebo-Controlled axSpA Integrated Analysis Set, the frequencies were comparable between the 
ixekizumab treatment groups and the placebo group with respect to the proportions of patients with 
elevations across the various baseline categories and prespecified elevation cut-offs for each parameter 
(that is, ALT, AST, ALP, or total bilirubin). Most patients did not experience shifts to different categories 
for ALT, AST, or total bilirubin. Supportive safety data from the All axSpA Analysis Set did not show new 
signals for hepatic laboratory test abnormalities. 
The data do not suggest an increased risk for drug-induced liver injury with ixekizumab treatment, 
consistent with the previously reported safety profile for ixekizumab.   
Safety in special populations 
Intrinsic Factors 
Subgroup analyses were performed in the Placebo-Controlled axSpA Integrated Analysis Set for 
Demographic Subgroups (Sex; Age Category Groups; Weight Category; Body mass index; Ethnicity) and 
Geographic Region Subgroups. These analyses included the proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE, as 
well as the AEs of special interest specified for subgroup analyses, namely, Infections, Allergic 
reactions/hypersensitivity events, and Injection Site Reactions.  Analyses were reviewed for the clinical 
importance of any findings, including evaluation of statistically significant findings. 
The TEAE profile was not influenced by sex, weight and BMI, ethnicity and race or by geographic region. 
The TEAE profile was not influenced by age.

Extrinsic Factors 
Subgroup analyses were performed for the following subgroups in the Placebo-Controlled axSpA 
Integrated Analysis Set for concomitant cDMARD (methotrexate, sulfasalazine, or hydroxychloroquine) 
Use, concomitant NSAID (including COX-2 inhibitors) Use, concomitant Oral Corticosteroid Use, 
concomitant Analgesic (systemic opioids and/or short acting analgesics with no anti-inflammatory effect) 
Use. These analyses included the proportion of patients with at least 1 TEAE, as well as the AEs of special 
interest specified for subgroup analyses, namely, Infections, Allergic reactions/hypersensitivity events, 
and Injection Site Reactions.  Analyses were reviewed for the clinical importance of any findings, 
including evaluation of statistically significant findings. 
According to the MAH, the TEAE profile was not influenced by concomitant use of cDMARD (methotrexate, 
sulfasalazine, or hydroxychloroquine), NSAID, oral corticosteroid or analgesic. 34.2% of patients were 
receiving a concomitant cDMARD85.5% of patients were receiving a concomitant NSAID, 11.9% of 
patients were receiving a concomitant oral corticosteroid 23.4% of patients were receiving a concomitant 
analgesic during the Placebo-Controlled Blinded Treatment Dosing Period (Weeks 0 to 16).  
Upon request, the MAH provided TEAEs for patients treated with or without SSZ for patients treated with 
Ixekizumab 80mg Q4W or placebo (Table 54).

Adverse Events by Starting Dose 
According to the MAH, in Studies RHBV, RHBW , RHBX, as well as in the Placebo-Controlled axSpA 
Integrated Analysis Set, the ixekizumab starting dose (160 mg versus 80 mg at Week 0) had no impact 
on the overall safety profile, as evaluated by TEAEs, SAEs, AEs leading to discontinuations, and AEs of 
special interest. 
Because Injection Site Reactions are the AEs of special interest that occur most often in the first few 
weeks of ixekizumab treatment, additional analyses investigating the impact of the ixekizumab starting 
dose on the frequency of Injection Site Reactions from Weeks 0 to 4 were performed.  While the 
percentage of patients reporting at least 1 Injection Site Reactions TEAE was greater for those patients in 
the ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W group receiving the 160-mg starting dose (n = 21 [15.0%]) compared with 
those receiving the 80-mg starting dose (n = 13 [9.1%]), this finding did not hold true for the ixekizumab

80 mg Q4W group where the percent of patients reporting an injection-related event was similar for each 
starting dose (160-mg starting dose:  n = 8 [5.6%]; 80-mg starting dose:  n = 9 [6.0%]).  Taken 
together, the MAH considers that although the numbers of patients are small, the results suggest that the 
additional 80-mg injection at Week 0 (that is, 160-mg starting dose) does not impact the frequency of 
Injection Site Reactions in the first 4 weeks of treatment. 
Use in Pregnancy and Lactation 
Pregnant and lactating women were excluded from entering the clinical studies. Seven pregnancies were 
reported  cumulatively  as  of  the  data  cut-off  date  of  the  submission.  Five  pregnancies  were  reported  in 
female  partners  of  male  patients  in  Studies  RHBV,  RHBW,  and  RHBY.  Outcome  was  available  for  one 
pregnancy  (a  male  neonate  was  reported  to  be  born  at  37  weeks  and  3  days  of  gestation,  with  no 
abnormalities detected) in this case exposure period was reported as first and second trimesters and study 
drug was discontinued approximately 1.5 months after a pregnancy was confirmed. The outcomes for the 
remaining pregnancies is not available. In all other 4 cases the blinded study drug was continued. 
Maternal exposure 
Two pregnancies were reported in female patients of Study RHBX at the data cut-off date for this type II 
variation. 
The  first  case  involved  a  24-year-old  female  patient.  The  patient’s  maternal  medical  history  included  2 
therapeutic abortions (2013 and 2014) 1 child of 12 months in good health, obesity, no excessive weight 
gain during pregnancy, and no previous macroscopic baby. The patient was not using any contraceptive 
method during her participation in the study. The patient had a positive urine pregnancy test prior to dosing 
at Week 20 study visit (second trimester exposure). The patient discontinued study drug permanently and 
developed polyhydramnios of an unknown cause on an unspecified date during the pregnancy. The patient 
was reported to have no complications during the pregnancy and no diagnostic tests were performed during 
the pregnancy. The patient delivered a female infant at 39 weeks of gestation via caesarean section due to 
polyhydramnios and high weight of the baby; the infant did not experience any complications.  
The second case involved a 28-year-old female patient. The patient never consumed tobacco or alcohol 
and had a history of 3 other pregnancies which resulted in preterm live births. The patient became 
pregnant during the study after discontinuing study drug. The study drug discontinuation was decided by 
the investigator because the patient was not benefiting from study drug. The patient had slight 
hypertension at the end of the pregnancy and had no other diagnostic tests performed during the 
pregnancy other than ultrasounds and regular labs. The patient delivered a male infant by vaginal birth 
after 39 weeks of gestation. The infant was normal and weighed 7 pounds and measured at a length of 
19.5 inches; APGAR scores were 10 at 1 minute and 10 at 5 minutes. No complications as a result of 
treatment with blinded study drug were reported by the patient. 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
According to the MAH, there are no known interactions of ixekizumab with other medicines.  Two 
population pharmacokinetic analyses were performed and results are included in this submission:  one 
analysis in patients with r-axSpA using data from studies RHBV and RHBW and one analysis in patients 
with nr-axSpA using data from Study RHBX. In both population PK analyses, concomitant treatment with 
the following drugs was determined to have no impact on the clearance of ixekizumab:  oral 
corticosteroids, NSAIDs (including COX-2 inhibitors), cDMARDs evaluated together (sulfasalazine, 
methotrexate, or hydroxychloroquine), and sulfasalazine and methotrexate evaluated individually.

Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Placebo-Controlled axSpA Integrated Analysis Set  
A higher percentage of ixekizumab-treated patients (n = 17 [3.0%]) reported an AE that led to study 
drug discontinuation compared with placebo-treated patients (n = 4 [1.4%]).   
The SOCs in which study drug discontinuation due to an AE were reported most frequently in 
ixekizumab-treated patients were the General disorders and administration site disorder SOC, 
Gastrointestinal disorders SOC, and Infections and infestations SOC. 
Reasons for treatment discontinuations due to TEAEs are provided in Table 55

All axSpA Ixekizumab Exposures Integrated Analysis Set 
In the All axSpA Analysis Set, 52 (5.6%) patients had an AE that led to study drug discontinuation.  The 
SOCs in which study drug discontinuation due to an AE were reported most frequently in 
ixekizumab-treated patients were the Infections and infestations SOC, Gastrointestinal disorders SOC, 
and General disorders and administration site disorder SOC 
Post marketing experience 
The first marketing approval for ixekizumab occurred on 22 Mar 2016 when the United States FDA 
approved ixekizumab for the treatment of adults with moderate-to-severe plaque Ps. Ixekizumab has also 
been approved by the FDA for the treatment of adults with active PsA on 01 Dec 2017. The Initial 
Marketing Authorisation Application (EMEA/H/C/003943) for Taltz for use in patients with 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 168/183 
 
  
  
 
 
moderate-to-severe Ps was approved by the EU Commission on 25 Apr 2016. The Type II variation 
procedure to add the indication for active PsA was approved by the EU Commission on 18 Jan 2018. The 
use of Taltz in axSpA has not been approved as yet and therefore, there is no postmarketing data 
available for patients with axSpA. As noted in PSUR 1, a signal for serious immediate hypersensitivity 
reactions consistent with anaphylaxis was identified from postmarketing spontaneous AE reports of 
ixekizumab, leading to a review of data for serious immediate hypersensitivity reactions. Based on 
findings from postmarketing spontaneous reports and mechanistic plausibility, the MedDRA Preferred 
Term of Anaphylaxis was added to the “Special warnings and precautions for use”. Following PSUR2 the 
“Special warnings and precautions for use” and “Undesirable effects” sections of the SmPC were updated 
to reflect this information.   
2.5.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Currently, the ixekizumab safety database comprises a total of 8421 ixekizumab-treated patients with Ps, 
PsA, r-axSpA, and nr- axSpA equating to 21,064.1 patient-years of exposure. In total 8953 patients have 
been treated with IXE in blinded and open-label clinical studies in plaque Ps, PsA, axial spondyloarthritis, 
and other autoimmune conditions combined. Of these, 6343 patients were exposed to IXE for at least 1 
year, cumulatively representing 19,772.1 patient-years of exposure. The most common adverse events 
associated with ixekizumab includes infections, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, allergic reactions, 
gastrointestinal disorders and injections site reactions. 
A total of 929 patients with axial spondyloarthritis have been exposed to ixekizumab, whereof 738 (79.4%) 
for more than 1 year. Of note only 82 of 302 patients with nr- axSpA were exposed to IXE for ≥1yr of which 
only 38 IXE 80 mg Q4W were exposed to the intended treatment dose at the time of this submission. These 
patients  were  all  bDMARD-naive.  This  dataset  makes  up  less  than  12  %  of  the  total  number  of  axSpA 
patients exposed for one year.  The extent of exposure of all axSpA population to ixekizumab complies with 
the requirements described in ICH E1 Population Exposure (300-600 exposed for 6 months and 100 patients 
exposed for a minimum of one-year. However, the population of nr-axSpA falls well short of this. The MAH 
clarified  that  130  patients  with  nr-axSpA  reached  1-year  ixekizumab  exposure  after  entering  extension 
study  RHBY.  Since  Non-radiographic-axSpA  is  also  considered  to  be  a  subset  of  a  single  disease  entity, 
axSpA,  which  includes  r-axSpA/  ankylosing  spondylitis  and  nr-axSpA,  safety  in  patients  with  r-axSpA 
exposed  to  IXE  can  be  taken  into  consideration  in  the  overall  safety  evaluation  of  IXE  in  the  nr-AxSpA 
population.  
The proportion of subjects with AEs, SAEs, infections, allergic reaction and injection site reactions in the 
16-week placebo-controlled period of the pivotal studies appeared similar in the adalimumab and 
ixekizumab groups and not remarkably higher than in the placebo group. During the placebo-controlled 
parts of the study, adverse events were reported for 162/291 subjects (55.7%) treated with ixekizumab 
Q4W, 163/283 subjects (57.6%) treated with ixekizumab Q2W and 138/294 subjects (46.9%) treated 
with placebo. The corresponding number of subjects for adalimumab-treated subjects in RBHV were 
44/90 subjects (48.9%). It should be noted that the population studied in RBHV were bDMARD-naïve, 
and in this population adverse events were less frequent for ixekizumab than for adalimumab. Also, 
serious adverse events were reported less frequently for ixekizumab than for adalimumab (1.2% vs 
3.3%). Overall TEAES were slightly higher in the nr-AxSpA group (59.1%) compared to the total r-axSpA 
population (54.2%). The overall bDMARD naive nr-axSpA rate of TEAE (59.1%) was more comparable 
with the TNFi experienced r-axSpA populations (62.7%) rather than the bDMARD naïve axSpA population 
(45.7%). This difference was driven by a higher rate of mild to moderate TEAES. A dose related increase 
in TEAEs across the three studies was only seen in the study with patients with nr-axSpA in which, 63.7% 
of the 80 mg Q2W compared with 54.2% of the IXE80 mg Q4W treated patients experienced TEAEs. Of 
note, the frequencies of Injection Site Reactions (high level term) were highest in treatment naïve 
Assessment report

Page 169/183 
 
  
  
patients with nr-axSpA in Study RHBX, however these frequenciesremain within the ranges previously 
reported in psoriasis and PsA studies. 
There were 3 deaths among ixekizumab-treated subjects in this development programme. One due to 
suicide, one due to infection and one possibly due to murder. No particular concerns with regards to 
safety of the drug are evoked by these three cases. There were no deaths in the placebo group. 
SAE were reported by 10 (1.7%) Ixekizumab treated patients and 6 (2.0) placebo treated patients.  
Adverse events of special interest 
Infections 
Infections are included in the SmPC Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.8. Infections occurred with a similar 
frequency in the Ixekizumab Q2W, Q4W (23.3% and 26.5%) and adalimumab (21.1%) groups. The most 
frequent infections were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. There were no cases of 
TB reported. The findings in the 16-week placebo-controlled period does not evoke any further concern, 
neither did the additional provided exposure adjusted incidence rates.  
The overall rates of OI were lower than placebo in the ixekizumab-treated patients (0.7% vs 0.5% 
respectively) in the 16-week placebo-controlled analysis and 1.6% in the all AxSpA analysis. There were 
slightly more reports of Herpes Zoster (2 (0.7%) patients) in the ixekizumab 80 mg Q4W compared with 
the placebo group (1 (0.3%) patient). Eleven (1.2%: IR 0.8/100PY) patients in the all axSpA reported 
Herpes zoster infection. All cases were mild to moderate in severity. Although the rates are low the 
incidence rate for Zoster in patients under 50 is of the order of 0.3-0.5/100 persons years with a steep 
rise after 50 years of age (Kawai et al 2014). The MAH clarified that the incidence rate of herpes zoster 
observed in the axSpA clinical development programme (0.8 per 100 patient-years) is consistent with the 
incidence rate of zoster in patients with axSpA identified in the two studies performed within US 
administrative insurance claims databases (0.9 per 100 person-years patients with ankylosing spondylitis 
Yun et al and 0.7 for patients(psoriasis, PsA, and ankylosing spondylitis) initiating a non-biologic DMARD 
(mean age 48.8 years) and 0.4 for patients starting a TNFi (mean age 52.2 years) (Winthrop et al. 2013). 
Thus, it is agreed by CHMP that the incidence rate of herpes zoster observed in the axSpA clinical 
development programme (0.8 per 100 patient-years) is consistent with the background rate of zoster 
reported in the literature.  
The profile of infections in AxSpA populations is considered generally consistent with the prior experience 
of ixekizumab, however reports of UTI including pyelonephritis and infectious diarrhoea was further 
discussed by the MAH and although there were not sufficient data to require an update in the SmPC, the 
MAH commits to monitor these events in the next PSUR.  
Upon request by CHMP, the warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the use in patients with chronic 
infections and when a chronic infection starts whilst on treatment was revised, to state that the warning 
applies also to patients with history of recurrent infections and to clarify the instructions to the HCP.  
Injection site reactions 
Injection site reactions were reported for a higher proportion of patients treated with ixekizumab Q2W 
than for adalimumab in the direct comparison (RHBV). During the placebo-controlled 16 weeks of the 
studies, injection site reactions were noted among 7.1% of ixekizumab-treated patients. In the PsA 
studies, injections site reactions were observed among 12% of ixekizumab-treated subjects during the 
first 24 weeks, and therefore the current findings do not constitute a new safety concerns. Among 
subjects treated with ixekizumab, allergic reactions/hypersensitivity events were more frequent among 
ADA-negative than among ADA-positive patients. Injection site reactions, however, were observed with a 
higher frequency among ADA-positive patients. However, most of these reactions were reported during 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 170/183 
 
  
  
periods when ADAs were not present. Injections site reactions are considered sufficiently covered by the 
current SmPC. 
Cytopenias 
Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia were observed among ixekizumab-treated subjects. In the placebo-
controlled axSpa analysis set 8.9% in the Ixekizumab group and 3.4% in the placebo group experienced 
neutropenia and 2.1% in the Ixekizumab group and 3.4% in the placebo group experienced 
thrombocytopenia. In the all axSpa analysis set 15.9% and 5% of the ixekizumab treated patients 
experienced neutropenia respectively thrombocytopenia. Most of these cases were transient and mostly 
occurred with low-grade changes (grade 1 and 2). Two patients (4.3%) who had a treatment-emergent 
Grade 1 thrombocytopenia reported bleeding-related TEAE. The preferred terms for these cases were 
haematuria (in combination with vascular rupture in one case). It is noteworthy that both patients 
reported haematuria, however, the number of cases is too small to draw any conclusions. The findings in 
these studies appear consistent with what has been previously described, and these risks are considered 
sufficiently covered by the SmPC. 
Hepatic event 
The proportion of subjects with hepatic events was not higher for ixekizumab than for placebo during the 
placebo-controlled part of the studies. This is reassuring. One subject experienced a ≥5-fold increase in 
liver enzymes, ALT and AST levels were found to be elevated to 223 U/L (reference 6 to 43 U/L) and 201 
U/L (reference 11 to 36 U/L). Approximately a month later, the patient’s ALT and AST levels returned to 
normal. The elevated liver enzymes were noted 5 days after starting ciprofloxacin, which may be a 
confounder. No information on bilirubin values has been found, however, the applicant states that no 
patients met the laboratory screening criteria for potential drug-induced liver injury (ALT ≥3xULN and 
maximum total bilirubin ≥2xULN).  
Cerebro- cardiovascular disease and MACE 
In this application, in the placebo-controlled analysis the incidence of MACE was highest in the 80 mg Q2W 
group (0.5%) but similar between the placebo (0.3%) and 80 mg Q4W treated group (0.3%). The overall 
exposure adjusted incidence for MACE was 0.1E/100PY. 
In the placebo-controlled analysis over 16 weeks there were 2 cases of cases of atrial arrhythmia in the 
IXE treated population compared with none in the placebo group, one of which was a SAE. In the longer-
term integrated safety analysis, the all axSpA analysis there were 5 cases adjudicated as atrial 
arrhythmia and 4 cases of ventricular arrhythmia. AxSpA is associated with a higher prevalence of aortic 
valve disorders and conduction disorders. The MAH provided an overview of these cases of arrhythmia. 
There was no clear temporal association between initiation of treatment or most recent treatment and 
onset of any of the arrythmia events. In addition, in all cases (except 2 cases of ventricular arrythmia), 
there were confounding medical histories that could plausibly have contributed to the event. No new 
safety concern was thus identified from the review of the cases. 
Cerebral  haemorrhage  and  subarachnoid  haemorrhage  were  reported  as  SAEs  in  the  pooled  AxSpA  IXE 
safety population. The case of cerebral haemorrhage was not adjudicated to meet the criteria for MACE. 
Both events were reported by the same patient and were the result of a fall and unlikely to be related to 
the study drug.  
Malignancy 
Rates of malignancy in patients treated with IXE are low (0.4E/100PY). The IR increased slightly from 0-12 
to 36-48 weeks (0.5E-0.6E/100PY). From week 48 -60, IR was 1.2E/100PY and from week 108, the IR was 
2.6 E/100PY. No events were reported in the other time intervals. There is limited long term data in this 
axSpA population particularly in patients with nr-axSpA. An incidence rate of 0.7 per 100 patient-years was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 171/183 
 
  
  
identified from clinical studies of certolizumab in nr-axSpA and 0.4 for r-axSpA. An incidence rate of 0.6 
per 100 patient-years was identified from clinical studies of secukinumab over 52 weeks of follow up with 
no  additional  malignancies  up  to  2yrs.  There  is  no  clear  evidence  of  an  increased  risk  for  developing 
malignancies from the clinical trial data presented in this application but there was a slight trend toward 
increased IR over longer term use. The latency period for malignancy may limit identification in the time 
frame of these clinical trials. Evidence is inconclusive regarding the risk of malignancy associated with nr-
axSpA and AS. 
Depression and Suicide/Suicidal behaviour 
Although a higher proportion of patients in the placebo treatment group (1.7%) than the IXE (0.9%) treated 
group reported depression related or suicidal/self-injury related TEAEs during the placebo-controlled period, 
all reports in the IXE population were in patients treated with the 80 mg Q2W regimen accounting for 1.8% 
of  this  population.  In  the  C-SSRS  analysis,  6  (1%)  IXE  treated  patients  compared  with  one  (0.3%)  of 
placebo treated patient reported suicidal ideation or behaviour. There were two significant suicide events 
(1 completed suicide and attempted suicide), both in the IXE treated population. Patient who committed 
suicide had a history of mild depression and was being treated with duloxetine. He was being treated with 
the  IXE  Q2W  regimen  and  was  intoxicated  when  he  died.  Although  this  case  is  confounded  by  his  past 
history,  treatment  with  an  SNRI  and  the  alcohol  consumption,  this  patient  did  not  appear  to  be  at  high 
suicide risk. There was no evidence of suicidal behaviour on the QIDS-SR16 and C-SSRS. Although it is 
recognised  that  there  are  increased  background  rates  of  depression  and  suicide  in  patients  with  axSpA, 
there appeared to be a slight a trend towards increase reports of suicidal behaviour in IXE treated patients. 
Overall,  the  data  did  not  suggest  an  increased  risk  of  depression  and  suicide/self-injury  behaviour 
associated with ixekizumab use. However,  the MAH commits to monitor depression-related or suicide/self 
injury-related AEs in subsequent PSUR. 
IBD 
In the Placebo-Controlled axSpA Integrated Analysis Set, 4 (0.7%) ixekizumab-treated patients and 2 
(0.7%) placebo-treated patient reported at least 1 IBD-related TEAE. In the All axSpA Analysis Set, 16 
(1.7%) patients reported at least 1 IBD-related TEAE. The frequency of IBD-related TEAEs in the axSpA 
clinical development programme was higher than that observed in the previously reported data in 
patients with plaque Ps or PsA.  Possible explanations for this observation include the higher prevalence 
of Crohn’s disease and Colitis ulcerative in the axSpA (4% to 16%) population compared with the plaque 
Ps (1.6%) or PsA (3.0%) populations. Inflammatory bowel disease is included in the Special Warnings 
and Precautions for Use section of the currently approved SmPC and included as a potential risk in the 
RMP; no update to the SmPC was proposed by the MAH. Upon CHMP’s request, the higher rate of IBD in 
the b-DMARD experienced Q4W treated r-axSpA population was further discussed by the MAH and the 
unexpected finding of a higher reporting rate of IBD in the b-DMARD treated r-axSpa treated with the 
lower Q4W dose in the placebo-controlled integrated analysis was not apparent in the extension period 
(Weeks 16 to 52), where all 4 cases reported occurred in the bDMARD naive population. . No update to 
the existing wording was deemed necessary by the CHMP. 
Hypersensitivity and Allergic reactions 
Rates of hypersensitivity and allergic reactions were low (8%). Most reactions were non-immediate and 
mild or moderate in severity. Slightly higher rates of non-anaphylactic hypersensitivity reactions were 
noted in the TNFi experienced r-axSpa population. There were no reported anaphylactic reactions in the 
IXE population. There was no clear association between TE-ADA status and allergic 
reaction/hypersensitivity. This is consistent with the profile seen in the PS and PsA. Hypersensitivity 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 172/183 
 
  
  
(including anaphylaxis) is appropriately reflected in sections 4.4 and 4.8 of the SmPC and no updates are 
deemed necessary by the CHMP.  
To facilitate the interpretation of the figures from the “All axSpA ixekizumab Exposures Integrated 
Analysis Set”, the MAH was asked to provide tables with exposure-adjusted incidence rates of all AEs of 
special interest. These additional data were in line with the data already presented.A higher percentage of 
ixekizumab-treated patients (3.0%) reported an AE that led to study drug discontinuation compared with 
placebo-treated patients (1.4%). The SOCs in which study drug discontinuation due to an AE were 
reported most frequently in ixekizumab-treated patients were the General disorders and administration 
site disorder SOC, Gastrointestinal disorders SOC, and Infections and infestations SOC. Upon request, the 
MAH provided reasons for discontinuations per treatment regimen in a tabulated form and the data 
provided did not evoke additional concerns. In the All axSpA Analysis Set, 52 (5.6%) patients had an AE 
that led to study drug discontinuation. According to the MAH, the data demonstrated that there was no 
trend for an increase in the incidence rate of discontinuation over longer durations of exposure to 
ixekizumab, consistent with the known safety profile of ixekizumab, which is agreed by CHMP.  
Laboratory findings 
Some increases in total cholesterol, VLDL, HDL and triglyceride and fasting glucose were noted in IXE 
treated patients compared with placebo. The MAH was requested to clarify significance of these findings. 
The magnitude of the changes was not considered clinically meaningful by the MAH and the changes were 
not long-lasting. No evidence of dose-dependent increases were observed. Also, the MAH stated, that in 
UNCOVER-1, -2, and -3 ixekizumab psoriasis studies, in which fasting lipid profiles were obtained through 
60 weeks, no significant changes were observed versus placebo for total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL 
cholesterol, VLDL cholesterol, or triglyceride at 60 weeks (maintenance dosing period). Importantly, LDL 
to HDL ratios remained stable during the induction and maintenance periods. Although transient changes 
were observed for some parameters during the induction period, these changes did not persist into the 
maintenance period. The MAHs reasons for not adding increased lipid levels as an ADR in the SmPC are 
accepted by CHMP. The MAH will continue to monitor total cholesterol, VLDL, HDL, and triglycerides in the 
context of cerebro-cardiovascular events in the next PSUR. 
Safety data in subgroups 
Subgroup analyses indicated that the TEAE profile was not influenced by age, sex, race, BMI/body weight, 
concomitant DMARD, NSAID, corticosteroid and analgesic use.  
The MAH proposed initially a claim in Section 4.2 of SmPC that there were no evident safety concerns 
when ixekizumab was concomitantly administered with cDMARDs (mainly sulfasalazine), corticosteroids, 
NSAIDs, or analgesics. However, the CHMP requested justification on the proposed statement. Indeed, 
these treatments form part of the current standard of care for AS, concomitant use of these drugs had no 
evident impact on efficacy in studies RHBV, RHBW, RHBX. Only around 1/3 of the patients were receiving 
concomitant cDMARDs during the studies, the majority were receiving sulfasalazine (SSZ) (21.8%) 
followed by Methotrexate (12.8%) and Hydroxychloroquine (0.3%). Since the term DMARD is broad and 
the different DMARDs do not have similar safety profile, it was not considered appropriate by CHMP to 
evaluate them together. Of the cDMARDs allowed in the studies, only sulfasalazine is recommended (off 
label) in treatment guidelines on axSpA, and then in the setting of peripheral arthritis. In the response, 
the MAH removed the proposed statement in Section 4.2 of SmPC, however, the MAH was further 
requested by CHMP to provide safety data on ixekizumab and sulfasalazine in combination, compared to 
ixekizumab in monotherapy, since this is considered to be data of relevance to the prescriber. The 
provided data did not evoke any further concerns. No update of the SmPC was therefore recommended 
by the CHMP.

2.5.2.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
The most common adverse events associated with ixekizumab include infections, neutropenia, 
thrombocytopenia, allergic reactions, gastrointestinal disorders and injections site reactions. No new 
safety problems have been identified in these studies although some imbalance in a few AEs were 
observed. These events (UTI including pyelonephritis and infectious diarrhoea and depression-related or 
suicide/self-injury-related AEs) will be followed by the MAH in the next PSUR.  
2.5.3.  PSUR cycle  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out in 
the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.6.  Risk management plan 
The MAH proposed the reclassification of a number of risks (including laboratory findings or risks without 
serious clinical outcomes) following the guidance in GVP V rev2. No changes were made to the list of 
additional pharmacovigilance activities or risk minimisation measures.  
The CHMP endorsed the Risk Management Plan version 6.3 with the following content:

been updated. The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. 
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current QRD template, which were reviewed 
and accepted by the CHMP. 
In addition, the list of local representatives in the PL has been revised to amend contact details for the 
representative of Estonia. 
2.7.1.  User consultation 
A justification for not performing a full user consultation with target patient groups on the package leaflet 
has been submitted by the MAH and has been found acceptable for the following reasons: the revisions 
are not considered to significantly affect the overall readability and design of the package leaflet. 
3.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA) is a chronic inflammatory disease predominantly affecting the axial 
skeleton (SIJs and spine) with onset of symptoms that typically appear in the second or third decade of 
life. AxSpA is recognised as a single disease entity, with a patient subset defined by the presence of 
radiographically defined structural damage of the SIJs (r-axSpA) and a patient subset without clear 
structural damage radiographically (nr-axSpA) consisting of: 
•  Radiographic axSpA (r-axSpA; also termed ankylosing spondylitis [AS]), characterised by the 
presence of definitive structural damage of the SIJ on radiographs. These patients fulfil the 
radiologic criterion of the mNY criteria. 
•  Nonradiographic axSpA (nr-axSpA), characterised by the lack of definitive structural damage of 
the SIJ on radiographs. These patients do not fulfil the radiologic criterion of the mNY criteria. 
AxSpA affects up to 1.4% of the Caucasian adult population worldwide. The proportion of patients with 
nr-axSpA among all patients with axSpA ranges from 40% to 60% according to several national and 
international referral programmes. Formerly, patients with axSpA without radiographically defined 
sacroiliitis but with evidence of sacroiliitis from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or other characteristics 
of disease have been less well diagnosed despite sharing a similar burden of disease and the same 
common features as patients with r-axSpA, such as spinal inflammation, chronic back pain, positivity for 
human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-B27, and The ASAS criteria for axSpA have been developed, in addition 
to a diagnostic algorithm (van den Berg et al. 2013), to facilitate earlier recognition of axSpA and to 
identify axSpA patients with and without radiographic sacroiliitis) using x-rays and MRI.  Adoption of the 
ASAS criteria has the potential to lead to earlier identification of patients with axSpA early in the disease 
course, and to result in more timely therapeutic intervention and less disability. 
AxSpA is characterised by chronic inflammation of the axial skeleton (SIJ and spine), as well as variable 
involvement of the peripheral joints. As the disease progresses, it can lead to new bone formation in the 
form of syndesmophytes and joint ankylosis, primarily in the axial skeleton. Patients with axSpA may also 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 176/183 
 
  
  
 
have extra-articular manifestations of the disease such as enthesitis, anterior uveitis, psoriasis (Ps), and 
inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), as well as comorbidities of aortitis or cardiac conduction abnormalities. 
In summary, Ixekizumab, a IL-17A-inhibitor, is approved for plaque psoriasis and PsA. This application 
aims to extend the indication to treatment of active axial spondyloarthritis (axSpA); including both 
radiographic (r-axSpA) and non-radiographic disease (nr-axSpA). Plaque psoriasis, PsA and axSpA are 
related and sometimes overlapping conditions; both with regards to clinical features and available 
treatment options. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are the first line of drug treatment in patients with axSpA, although 
they are not effective or well tolerated in all patients.  Treatment of NSAID-refractory axSpA is hampered 
by the lack of efficacy of cDMARDs (Braun and Sieper 2009), although peripheral arthritis associated with 
axSpA may respond to sulfasalazine. Patients with more advanced disease requiring biologic therapy have 
limited options.  Although TNF inhibitors have demonstrated efficacy in both r-axSpA and nr-axSpA, up to 
40% of patients fail to achieve adequate disease control or may be intolerant to TNFi, and switching 
patients to a second or third TNFi may not be effective (Lie et al. 2011).  Other than TNF inhibitors, the 
only available targeted treatment is secukinumab (another interleukin-17 [IL-17] inhibitor), which is only 
registered in patients with r-axSpA. 
For patients with nr-axSpA, the only currently approved therapy is TNF inhibition.  Antagonism of IL-17 
by ixekizumab represents a novel approach to interfere with the chronic inflammatory process by 
selectively targeting the predominant cytokine of the unique subset of helper Th17 cells, as well as other 
cells that play a predominant role in the inflammation associated with axSpA.  The subgroup of patients 
with nr-axSpA with objective signs of inflammation (defined as active inflammation on MRI and/or 
elevated C-reactive protein [CRP]) is considered the appropriate target population for biologic treatment 
given the higher observed progression rates (up to 20% over a 2-year period) relative to approximately 
10% progression over the same period in patients with nr-axSpA without such objective signs of 
inflammation.  In addition, studies from TNF inhibitors in nr-axSpA demonstrated that minimal treatment 
effect is observed in patients with nr-axSpA without objective signs of inflammation at baseline 
(Poddubnyy et al. 2012; Rudwaleit and Sieper 2012; Sieper and van der Heijde 2013; Sieper et al. 2013). 
In summary, although there are several approved drugs for axSpA, there is still a high unmet need for 
additional targeted treatment options since all patients do not respond to or tolerate the available 
alternatives. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The applicant has conducted 3 pivotal clinical studies in 960 adult patients with axSpA axial: 2 studies in 
patients with r-axSpA (RHBV and RHBW) and 1 study in patients with nr-axSpA (RHBX). All three studies 
have a randomized, double blind, parallel group design, testing two different dose regimens of 
Ixekizumab (80mg Q2W or 80mg Q4W) with or without a bolus dose of 160 mg. One study (RHBV) also 
included an active comparator, Adalimumab 40mg Q2W. The placebo-controlled period was 16 weeks in 
the two r-axSpA studies (RHBV, RHBW) and 52 weeks in the nr-axSpA study (RHBX). In all three studies, 
the primary endpoint, ASAS 40, was measured at week 16. 
The design and conduct of these studies essentially follow the relevant EMA GL and received Scientific 
Advice. 
Study RHBV was a randomized, double-blind, active and placebo-controlled, study in bDMARD-naive 
patients with active rad-axSpA, with a double-blind, 16-week treatment period. In addition, long-term 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/251895/2020 
Page 177/183 
 
  
  
efficacy and safety were evaluated up to 52 weeks for patients who participated throughout the entire 1-
year study. 
Study RHBW was a, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study with a double-blind, 16-week 
treatment period in tumor necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi)-experienced patients with rad-axSpA. 
In addition, long-term efficacy and safety were evaluated up to 52 weeks for patients who participated 
throughout the entire 1-year study. 
Study RHBX was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, study in bDMARD-naive patients 
with active nr-axSpA that included a 52-week treatment period. 
In all three studies the study population consisted of adult subjects with a diagnosis of axSpA and a 
history of prior therapy for axSpA of at least 12 weeks and an inadequate response or intolerance to 
NSAID. 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
All three phase III studies met the primary endpoint of superiority over placebo in ASAS 40 response rate 
at week 16. In addition, most major secondary endpoints (evaluating disease activity, objective signs of 
inflammation, function and patient reported quality of life) were achieved. Effects were observed as early 
as after one week and seemed to be maintained over time.  
ASAS 40 response at week 16; the primary endpoint of the three main studies 
In Study RHBV that included 341 TNF-inhibitor naive r-axSpA, ASAS 40 response at week 16, was 
reached for 48% of the patient treated with Ixekizumab 80mg Q4W and for 52% of the patient treated 
with Ixekizumab 80 mg Q2W. Among the patients treated with placebo, 18% reached ASAS 40 at week 
16. In the Adalimumab 40mg Q2W group, 36% reached ASAS 40 response. The study was not designed 
to test non-inferiority of Ixekizumab compared to Adalimumab. 
In study RHBW that included 316 TNF-inhibitor experienced r-axSpA, ASAS 40 response at week 16 was 
achieved for 30.6% in the Ixekizumab 80mg Q2W group, 25.4% Ixekixumab 80mg Q4W and 12.5% 
Placebo. 
In study RHBX that included 303 patients with non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis, ASAS 40 
response at week 16 was achieved for by 40.2% in the Ixekizumab 80mg Q2W, 35.4% Ixekixumab in the 
80mg Q4W and in the 19.0% Placebo group.

The proposed posology is a bolus dose of 160 mg, followed by 80 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 
weeks which is acceptable by CHMP.

3.1.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
It is not established whether all patients with axSpA will benefit from ixekizumab since all patients in the 
3 pivotal studies had previous treatment with conventional therapy for at least 12 weeks and had not 
responded or was intolerant to NSAID. Thus, the initially broad indication proposed by the applicant was 
considered not justified and has been revised at the CHMP’s request to adequately reflect the intended 
population. 
In study RHBX, examining patients with nR-axSpA eligible subjects were requested to have objective 
signs of inflammation, specified as sacroiliitis on MRI or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). At the CHMP’s 
request, the MAH added “as indicated by elevated CRP and / or MRI”, to the indication wording for 
patients with nR-axSpA for clarification. 
In nr-axSpA in particular, it is not established whether treatment in a well responding patient should be 
continued on a chronic basis, or whether dose tapering or even treatment discontinuation can be 
considered at some point. The MAH indicated to currently collect randomised withdrawal data in the 
ongoing study RHBY. The MAH has committed, based on CHMP’s recommendation, to submit the results 
post-approval in line with the EU Guideline on axSpA. 
3.2.  Unfavourable effects 
Currently, the ixekizumab safety database comprises a total of 8421 ixekizumab-treated patients with Ps, 
PsA, r-axSpA, and nr- axSpA equating to 21,064.1 patient-years of exposure. The most common adverse 
events associated with ixekizumab includes infections, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, allergic reactions, 
gastrointestinal disorders and injections site reactions. 
A total of 929 patients with axial spondyloarthritis have been exposed to ixekizumab, whereof 738 
(79.4%) for more than 1 year. The proportion of subjects with AEs, SAEs, infections, allergic reaction and 
injection site reactions in the 16-week placebo-controlled period of the pivotal studies appeared similar in 
the adalimumab and ixekizumab groups and not remarkably higher than in the placebo group. During the 
placebo-controlled parts of the study, adverse events were reported for 162/291 subjects (55.7%) 
treated with ixekizumab Q4W, 163/283 subjects (57.6%) treated with ixekizumab Q2W and 138/294 
subjects (46.9%) treated with placebo. The corresponding number of subjects for adalimumab-treated 
subjects in RBHV were 44/90 subjects (48.9%). 
Infections occurred with a similar frequency in the ixekizumab (23.3% and 26.5%) and adalimumab 
(21.1%) groups. The most frequent infections were nasopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract 
infections. There were no cases of TB reported. The findings in the 16-week placebo-controlled period 
does not evoke any further concern. Infections are included in the SmPC 4.3,4.4 and 4.8. 
The warning in Section 4.4 of the SmPC regarding the use in patients with chronic infections and when a 
chronic infection starts whilst on treatment is updated to state that the warning applies also to patients 
with history of recurrent infections and to clarify the instructions to the HCP.  
Injection site reactions were reported for a higher proportion of patients treated with ixekizumab Q2W 
than for adalimumab in the direct comparison (RHBV). During the placebo-controlled 16 weeks of the 
studies, injection site reactions were noted among 7.1% of ixekizumab-treated patients. In the PsA 
studies, injections site reactions were observed among 12% of ixekizumab-treated subjects during the 
first 24 weeks, and therefore the current findings do not constitute a new safety concern. 
Other adverse events of special interest predefined by the MAH included cerebro-cardiovascular events 
(including MACE), malignancies, hepatic-related events, depression and suicide/self-injury, inflammatory 
bowel disease (IBD) and interstitial lung disease.

3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
About 1/3 of the patients were on concomitant treatment with DMARD, the most common being 
Sulfasalazine (SSZ). The term DMARD is broad and different DMARDs do not have the same mode of 
action or safety profile. Of the cDMARDs allowed in the studies, only sulfasalazine is recommended (off 
label) in treatment guidelines on axSpA, and then in the setting of peripheral arthritis. The MAH was 
requested to provide safety data on ixekizumab and sulfasalazine in combination, compared to 
ixekizumab in monotherapy and the provided data did not evoke any further concerns. 
No new safety concerns have been identified in these studies although some imbalance in a few AEs were 
seen. These events (UTI, Diarrhoea infectious and Depression related or suicide/self injury) will be 
followed by the MAH in the next PSUR.

3.5.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.5.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Clinically relevant and statistically significant effects have been shown for ixekizumab in the treatment of 
r-axSpA in both bDMARD naïve and bDMARD experienced patients. In addition, clinically relevant efficacy 
has been shown for ixekizumab in nr-axSpA patients.  
The initially proposed indication targeted all subjects with active axSpA, although the studied populations 
were restricted to subjects with prior experience of conventional treatment. At the CHMP’s request, the 
MAH has revised the indication for both the r-axSpA and nr-axSpA populations to reflect the intended 
population. 
In study RHBX, examining patients with nR-axSpA eligible subjects were requested to have objective

signs of inflammation, specified as sacroiliitis on MRI or elevated C-reactive protein (CRP). At the CHMP’s 
request, the MAH added “as indicated by elevated CRP and / or MRI”, to the indication wording for 
patients with nR-axSpA for clarification. 
The wording of the indication is as follows:  
Axial spondyloarthritis 
Ankylosing spondylitis (radiographic axial spondyloarthritis) 
Taltz is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active ankylosing spondylitis who have 
responded inadequately to conventional therapy. 
Non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
Taltz is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with active non-radiographic axial spondyloarthritis 
with objective signs of inflammation as indicated by elevated C-reactive protein (CRP) and/or magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) who have responded inadequately to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(NSAIDs). 
The proposed posology is a bolus dose of 160 mg, followed by 80 mg by subcutaneous injection every 4 
weeks which is acceptable by CHMP. 
The safety profile for ixekizumab in the current application is considered overall consistent with prior 
experience in other indications and no new concerns have arisen.  
Slight imbalances in some AEs, namely UTI, Diarrhoea infectious and Depression related or suicide/self- 
injury were observed. These issues will be followed by the MAH in the next PSUR. 
3.5.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Ixekizumab has demonstrated a positive and clinically meaningful effect on the treatment of axial 
spondylarthritis. The identified risks in the pivotal Phase III studies for axSpA are considered to be 
consistent with those previous established in the psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis submissions.  
3.6.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Taltz for the treatment of the treatment of adult patients with active ankylosing 
spondylitis who have responded inadequately to conventional therapy and for the treatment of adult

1.  Background information on the procedure 
1.1.  Submission of the dossier 
Roche Registration GmbH submitted on 13 September 2018 an extension of the marketing authorisation. 
Extension application to add a new strength of 840 mg (60 mg/ml) for Tecentriq concentrate for solution 
for infusion in a vial and a new indication (metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC)). The new 
indication applies only to the 840mg strength. 
The legal basis for this application refers to:  
Article 19 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008 and Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008, 
(2) point(c)- Extensions of marketing authorisations. 
Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included EMA Decisions 
P/0076/2015 and P/0220/2015 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
At the time of submission of the application, the PIP P/0220/2015 was not yet completed as some 
measures were deferred. 
Information relating to orphan market exclusivity 
Similarity 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No. 141/2000 and Article 3 of Commission Regulation (EC) No 
847/2000, the MAH did not submit a critical report addressing the possible similarity with authorised 
orphan medicinal products because there is no authorised orphan medicinal product for a condition 
related to the proposed indication. 
Additional Data exclusivity/Marketing protection 
The MAH requested consideration of one year marketing protection in regards of its application for a new 
indication in accordance with Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) 726/2004. 
Scientific advice 
The MAH received Scientific advice from the CHMP on 26 May 2016 (EMEA/H/SA/2522/7/2016/II). The 
Scientific advice pertained to clinical aspects.

2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication is for Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of adult 
patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose 
tumours have PD-L1 expression ≥1% and who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic 
disease.

2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer among women and the leading cause of 
cancer-related deaths in women worldwide.  In 2012, almost 1.7 million new breast cancer cases were 
diagnosed (25% of all cancers in women) and 521,900 deaths were estimated to have occurred (De 
Santis et al. 2015; Ferlay et al. 2015).  In 2018, approximately 522,513 subjects were diagnosed with 
breast cancer and approximately 137,707 subjects died due to the disease in Europe (The Global Cancer 
Observatory, March, 2019). TNBC accounts for 12%–20% of newly diagnosed breast cancer (BC) cases 
(Chacón and Costanzo 2010; Foulkes et al. 2010).  
2.1.3.  Biologic features 
TNBC, a distinct phenotypic subtype of breast cancer with the worst prognosis, is characterized 
immunohistologically by the lack of expression of hormonal receptors (estrogen receptor [ER] and 
progesterone receptor [PgR]), and lack of overexpression and/or amplification of the human epidermal 
growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)/NEU gene (Dent et al. 2007).  
Programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression by tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) and tumour 
cells has been reported in breast cancer. PD-L1 expression in breast cancer is more prevalent on Immune 
Cells (ICs) than tumour cells (TCs) (Cimino-Mathews et al. 2016). Breast cancer specimens who’s TCs 
express PD-L1 usually also express PD-L1 on ICs (Li et al. 2018). 
2.1.4.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis 
Compared  to  other  breast  cancer  subtypes,  TNBC  tumours  are  generally  larger  in  size,  more  poorly 
differentiated,  have  more  extensive  lymph  node  involvement  at  diagnosis,  and  exhibit  an  invasive 
phenotype.  Patients with TNBC have a higher risk of both local and distant recurrence, and metastases 
are more likely to occur in visceral organs and the brain rather than bone compared to patients with other 
breast cancers (Carey et al. 2006).  In the early disease setting, this is manifested in a shorter time to 
recurrence and shorter OS compared to patients with estrogen-driven cancer (Malorni et al. 2012; Press 
et al. 2017; Urru et al. 2018). 
Consistent with the relatively poor prognosis of patients with early stage disease, patients with metastatic 
disease progress quickly on palliative chemotherapy.  However, because few large randomized studies 
have been performed specifically in patients with metastatic TNBC, estimates of expected clinical 
outcomes are not as reliable as they are for other cancer populations.  This challenge is exacerbated by 
the lack of a single consistent definition of triple-negative status across different studies.  Meta-analyses, 
retrospective chart review, and subgroup analyses of metastatic breast cancer patients enrolled in Phase 
III studies can be used to set expectations.  For example, Miles et al. (2013) observed a median PFS of 5.4 
months and a median overall survival of 17.5 months among mTNBC patients in a pooled subgroup 
analysis of studies testing first-line bevacizumab in combination with chemotherapy for HER2-negative 
breast cancer.  In a chart review of 111 patients with TNBC who received first-line chemotherapy at their 
institutions, Kassam et al. (2009) noted a median survival time of 13.3 months (range, 0.8−99.8 
months).  Other studies have reported divergent results, underscoring the need for large, well-conducted 
studies to set appropriate expectations for clinical trial design in patients with TNBC.  Notwithstanding the 
relative lack of robust benchmarks in TNBC, an expected median PFS of approximately 6 months and OS 
of approximately 16 months in the study population are reasonably supported by the available evidence. 
Despite optimal use of the best currently available systemic therapy, the vast majority of women with 
metastatic TNBC will ultimately die from their disease (Bonotto et al. 2014). As of 2014, the five-year 
survival rate for mTNBC is estimated at 9% (based on the most recent estimates from the Surveillance, 
Epidemiology, and End Results [SEER] database).

2.1.5.  Management 
With  the  exception  of  recent  data  demonstrating  PFS  (but  not  OS)  benefit  of  the  poly  ADP  ribose 
polymerase (PARP) inhibitor class of drugs in germline BReast CAncer (BRCA)-mutated metastatic breast 
cancer  (Robson  et  al.  2017),  there  is  no  agent  that  effectively  targets  a  defining  vulnerability  across 
TNBC. Per the latest European Society of Oncology-European Society for Medical Oncology (ESO-ESMO) 
guidelines (Cardoso et al. 2018a), cytotoxic chemotherapy remains the mainstay of treatment for both 
early-stage and non-BRCA−mutated advanced TNBC.  
Current guidelines support the practice of TNBC being treated with conventional chemotherapy strategies 
as determined by the patient’s characteristics and the toxicity profile of the treatment (NCCN 2018). For 
patients with metastatic disease, the ESO-ESMO (Cardoso et al. 2018a), ASCO (Partridge et al. 2014), 
and  National  Comprehensive  Cancer  Network  (NCCN)  guidelines  recommend  the  use  of  sequential 
single-agent  chemotherapy,  except  in  patients  with  visceral  crisis  or  rapidly  progressing  disease,  but 
otherwise,  these  guidelines  do  not  specifically  address  the  management  of  TNBC.  No  single 
chemotherapy  agent  has  demonstrated  clear  superiority  and  is  considered  the  preferred  agent  in  the 
first-line  metastatic  setting.  There  are  several  active  agents  considered  appropriate  for  first-line 
chemotherapy, 
including 
taxanes,  anthracyclines,  capecitabine,  gemcitabine,  platinum-based 
compounds, vinorelbine, and ixabepilone. 
Many  combination  chemotherapy  regimens  have  been  studied  in  an  effort  to  improve  outcomes  for 
metastatic TNBC patients, and although combination regimens have resulted in improved response rates 
and longer time to progression compared to single agents, this advance has been made at the expense of 
increased toxicity, with no benefits in overall survival, and in many cases a decline in patients’ quality of 
life  (O’Shaughnessy et al. 2002; Sledge et al. 2003; Albain et al. 2004; Carrick et al. 2005; Cardoso et 
al.  2018b).    Based  on  this  evidence,  the  NCCN  guideline  panel  found  no  compelling  evidence  that 
combination regimens are superior to sequential single agents (NCCN 2018). The ESO-ESMO and ASCO 
guidelines also recommend sequential monotherapy as the preferred option for metastatic breast cancer 
considering  the  reduced  toxicity  burden  and  potential  for  better  quality  of  life  (Partridge  et  al.  2014; 
Cardoso et al. 2018a).   
Standard clinical practice is to continue palliative chemotherapy, as tolerated, until progression of disease 
because it improves progression-free survival while modestly extending overall survival (Muss HB 1991; 
Falkson et al.1998; Gennari et al. 2011). Due to the lack of consistent improvements in OS, the NCCN 
guidelines state that prolonged use of chemotherapy should be weighed against the detrimental effects of 
continuous chemotherapy on overall quality of life (NCCN 2018). The ESO-ESMO and ASCO guidelines 
(Partridge et al. 2014; Cardoso et al. 2018a) are largely consistent with the recommendation that each 
regimen (except anthracyclines) should be given until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity and 
that the duration of each regimen and the number of regimens should be tailored to the individual patient.  
Recently PARP inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of advanced TNBC with germline BRCA1/2 
mutations in patients who have been previously treated with an anthracycline and/or a taxane in the 
(neo)adjuvant, locally advanced or metastatic setting (EPAR Talzenna, EPAR Lynparza). 
Although advanced TNBC may respond transiently to standard of care there is a pressing need for new 
clinically active agents to improve the long-term treatment outcomes and survival of patients with this 
diagnosis. 
About the product 
Atezolizumab  is  an  Fc-engineered  humanized  immunoglobulin  (IgG1)  monoclonal  antibody  (MAb) 
targeting  the  programmed  death-ligand  1  (PD-L1).  Binding  of  atezolizumab  to  PD-L1  inhibits  the

interaction of the PD-1 and B7.1 receptors. Both of these interactions are reported to provide inhibitory 
signals to T cells. 
Tecentriq 1,200 mg concentrate for solution for infusion is currently indicated in the following indications: 
- as monotherapy in the treatment of adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell 
lung cancer (NSCLC) after prior chemotherapy and locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma 
after treatment with chemotherapy or who are cisplatin-ineligible and have PD-L1 expression ≥ 5%.  
- in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel and carboplatin, is also indicated for the first-line treatment 
of  adult  patients  with  metastatic  non-squamous  non-small  cell  lung  cancer  (NSCLC).  In  patients  with 
EGFR  mutant  or  ALK-positive  NSCLC,  Tecentriq,  in  combination  with  bevacizumab,  paclitaxel  and 
carboplatin, is indicated only after failure of appropriate targeted therapies. 
-  as  monotherapy  is  indicated  for  the treatment  of adult  patients  with  locally advanced  or  metastatic 
NSCLC after prior chemotherapy. Patients with EGFR mutant or ALK positive NSCLC should also have 
received targeted therapies before receiving Tecentriq (see SmPC section 5.1). 
The recommended dose of Tecentriq is 1,200 mg administered intravenously every three weeks when 
administered in monotherapy. When given in combination with bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and carboplatin 
for  the  treatment  of  non-squamous  NSCLC,  the  recommended  dose  of  Tecentriq  is  1,200  mg 
administered by intravenous infusion, followed by bevacizumab, paclitaxel, and then carboplatin every 
three weeks for four or six cycles (induction phase). The induction phase is followed by a maintenance 
phase without chemotherapy in which 1,200 mg Tecentriq followed by bevacizumab, is administered by 
intravenous infusion every three weeks. 
With this application the MAH sought the approval of a new strength, 840 mg concentrate for solution for 
infusion. In addition, the MAH applied for a new indication for Tecentriq 840 mg as follows:  
Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumours have 
PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 
The recommended dose of Tecentriq is 840 mg administered by intravenous infusion, followed by 100 
mg/m2 nab-paclitaxel. For each 28-day cycle, Tecentriq is administered on days 1 and 15, and 
nab-paclitaxel is administered on days 1, 8, and 15.  
It is recommended that patients are treated with Tecentriq until disease progression or unmanageable 
toxicity (see SmPC sections 4.2 and 5.1). 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
In September and October 2015, the applicant sought National Scientific Advice Meetings to discuss the 
design of the pivotal study IMpassion130. Consequently, a confirmatory IRC review of PFS and 
retrospective confirmatory central testing of ER, PgR, and HER2 were established. To address critical 
comments on the choice of nab-paclitaxel as comparator in 1L metastatic TNBC, IMpassion131 was 
initiated to generate clinical evidence for atezolizumab in combination with paclitaxel.  
In May 2016, due to a high number of unblinding requests, the applicant sought EMA Scientific advice 
(Procedure EMEA/H/SA/2522/7/2016/II). CHMP did not endorse the applicant’s proposal to amend 
IMpassion130 to prevent unblinding individual patients’ treatment assignment, except in the case of 
emergent safety events, until OS data from the study were available. 
It is an application for a change to the existing marketing authorisation leading to an extension of the 
marketing authorisation; change or addition of a new strength intended for the extension of indication to

include the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative 
breast  cancer  (TNBC)  whose  tumors  have  PD-L1  expression  ≥1%  and  who  have  not  received  prior 
chemotherapy for metastatic disease.  
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The currently authorised presentation of Tecentriq is a concentrate for solution for infusion. Each vial of 
concentrate contains 1,200 mg of atezolizumab (corresponding to 20 mL, 60 mg/mL). After dilution, one 
mL of solution contains approximately 4.4 mg of atezolizumab. 
The applicant developed a new strength of 840 mg (same pharmaceutical form) in the context of the new 
therapeutic  indication  applied  for.  Each  vial  of  concentrate  contains  840  mg  of  atezolizumab 
(corresponding to 14 mL, 60 mg/mL). After dilution, one mL of solution contains approximately 3.2 mg of 
atezolizumab. 
For both strengths atezolizumab finished product is provided as a sterile, single-use, colourless to slightly 
yellow solution for intravenous infusion and does not contain preservatives.  
The finished product formulation and composition of the primary packaging materials remain unchanged.  
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
Module 3.2.S is not affected by this application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description and composition of the finished product 
Reference  is  made  to  Table  1  for  a  comparison  of  the  new  atezolizumab  finished  product  840  mg 
presentation  with  the  currently  authorised  1200  mg  presentation.  The  only  differences  are  vial  size, 
nominal  fill  volume  and  cap  colour  (mist  grey  for  the  840  mg  presentation,  aqua  for  the  1200  mg 
presentation).   
The primary packaging for atezolizumab finished product is a 15 mL colourless Ph. Eur. Type I glass vial 
sealed with a 20 mm rubber stopper and crimped with a 20 mm aluminium seal fitted with a plastic flip-off 
cap. All product-contacting materials are pharmaceutical-grade, are suitable for packaging sterile liquid 
products, and comply with relevant pharmacopoeial requirements.

Manufacturing process development 
The manufacturing process of the 840 mg and the 1200 mg vial is identical, except for the unit operation 
for filling which uses different process parameters due to the different vial and fill volumes. In order to 
support the finished product manufacturing process transfer to a new finished product facility, two 
technical batches were manufactured in the engineering run campaign: one of atezolizumab finished 
product vial 1200 mg and one of atezolizumab finished product vial 840 mg. Additionally, the 
manufacturing process for atezolizumab finished product 840 mg presentation was validated using three 
consecutive validation/registration batches;  
The applicant performed an adequately designed comparability study in accordance with ICH Q5E 
guideline: 
•  Comparative batch release test assessment:  
Finished product release testing results for the three 840 mg validation batches (B0001, B0002 
and B0003) met all release acceptance criteria. Finished product validation batch release test 
results for the assays met qualitative and quantitative predefined acceptance criteria. 
Quantitative criteria are based on the 95% confidence/99% probability tolerance interval (95/99 
Tolerance Interval) of historical batch release results.  
Comparative extended characterisation assessment:  
The applicant adequately executed extended characterisation results for attributes considered 
relevant based on a gap assessment performed for the scope of the finished product transfer to a 
new finished product manufacturing facility Results from validation batches met predefined 
acceptance criteria based on historical data. 
•  Comparative stress stability comparability assessment:  
The adequately designed comparative stress study performed at 40°C/75% RH for up to 30 days 
shows a similar quality profile for the analysed parameters and therefore demonstrates evidence 
that the finished product manufactured at new finished product site (i.e. three 840 mg/14 mL 
validation batches) is sufficiently comparable to the finished product manufactured at the initial 
finished product manufacturing site (i.e. three 1200 mg/ 20 mL representative batches). 
Comparability of atezolizumab finished product manufactured at different finished product manufacturing 
sites is considered demonstrated.  
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
Manufacture 
Manufacture of finished product includes the following process steps:  
- Thawing of frozen active substance; optional refreezing and storage of residual drug substance; 
- Pooling of the active substance and mixing; 
- Bioburden reduction filtration;  
- Sterile filtration of the finished product, vial filling, and stoppering; 
- Capping and crimping of vials; 
- Inspection of vials; 
- Labelling and secondary packaging.   
Process validation 
Assessment report

Page 11/122 
 
 
 
 
The manufacturing process for the atezolizumab finished product 840 mg presentation was prospectively 
validated using three consecutive validation batches; Critical steps and critical process parameters (CPPs) 
and corresponding in-process controls (IPCs) are adequately identified, i.e. bioburden, endotoxin, filter 
integrity and fill weight, and are based on the manufacturing process for the 1200 mg presentation but 
have been adapted for the process of the new 840 mg presentation. The defined action limits are in line 
with regulatory requirements. The results of the validation studies demonstrate consistent manufacturing 
of the 840 mg presentation, i.e. the pre-defined acceptance criteria for all quality attributes / parameters 
as well as for IPCs and release tests were adequately met. Furthermore, the proposed holding and 
processing times are justified based on the presented validation data. 
Product specification, analytical procedures, batch analysis 
Specifications 
Release and shelf life specifications include control of identity, purity, potency and other general tests.  
In  comparison  with  the  1,200  mg  presentation,  the  specifications  and  analytical  methods  remain 
unchanged. 
The overall control strategy encompassing control by IPCs and specifications is considered justified to 
achieve and maintain the intended product quality. 
Batch analysis 
The batch genealogies of atezolizumab finished product registration/validation batches were provided. All 
batch analysis results meet the specifications that were in effect at the time of testing and release for each 
batch. 
Stability of the product 
The stability protocol is adequately designed and complies with relevant guidelines. The selected methods 
are  considered  suitable  to  detect  changes  in  the  stability-indicating  critical  quality  attributes  (CQAs). 
Stability data provided by the applicant include three consecutive validation batches at the recommended 
storage long-term condition (2°C-8°C) and additionally data at accelerated storage condition (25°C/60% 
relative humidity [RH]). Supportive long-term and accelerated stability data of the atezolizumab finished 
product engineering batch are also available. The real-time long-term (2°C-8°C) data show no critical 
trends and confirm the known stability profile. 
Considering the totality of the stability data presented the following storage conditions, as approved for 
the currently authorised 1,200 mg presentation, are acceptable: 
- Unopened vial: 3 years (2°C – 8°C) 
- Diluted solution: Chemical and physical in use stability has been demonstrated for no more than 24 
hours at 2°C to 8°C or 24 hours at ≤ 30°C from the time of preparation. From a microbiological point of 
view,  the  prepared  solution  for  infusion  should  be  used  immediately.  If  not  used  immediately,  in-use 
storage times and conditions prior to use are the responsibility of the user and would normally not be 
longer than 24 hours at 2 °C to 8 °C or 8 hours at ambient temperature (≤ 25 °C). 
- The vial should be kept in the outer carton in order to protect from light. 
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products in 
the European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should be 
reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.

2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The applicant adequately addressed the two minor issues identified during the procedure.  
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
In conclusion, based on the review of the quality data provided, CHMP considers that this line extension 
application is approvable from the quality point of view. 
2.2.6.  Recommendation(s) for future quality development 
None. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable by the 
CHMP. 
2.3.1.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Atezolizumab is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody produced by recombinant DNA technology, a protein with 
a molecular mass of ~150 kDa. As an unaltered protein, being extensively degraded in the patient’s body 
by  regular  proteolytic  mechanisms  before  excretion,  atezolizumab  is  unlikely  to  result  in  a  significant 
environmental exposure. Atezolizumab is expected to biodegrade in the environment and does not pose 
a  significant  risk  to  the  environment.  Thus,  according  to  the  “Guideline  on  the  Environmental  Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), atezolizumab is exempt 
from the submission of Environmental Risk Assessment studies as the product and excipients do not pose 
a significant risk to the environment. 
2.3.2.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
The applicant did not submit studies for the ERA. According to the relevant guideline, in the case of 
products containing proteins as active pharmaceutical ingredient(s), this is acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new nonclinical data has been provided for this extension. No further data is required.

Table 2: Tabular overview of clinical studies 
Pivotal study 
Supportive study 
Reference was also made to Study GP28328, an open-label, Phase Ib study that has six treatment arms 
and is designed to assess the safety, pharmacology and preliminary efficacy of atezolizumab 
administered with bevacizumab (Arm A) and with bevacizumab plus oxaliplatin, leucovorin, and 
5-fluorouracil (5-FU) (FOLFOX) (Arm B), with carboplatin and paclitaxel (Arm C), with carboplatin and 
pemetrexed (Arm D), with carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel (Arm E), and with nab-paclitaxel (Arm F) in 
participants with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumours (NCT01633970) (Pohlmann et al. 2018). 
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
The clinical pharmacology properties of atezolizumab were originally characterized using previous studies 
when atezolizumab was administered as 1200 mg IV every three weeks (q3w) as monotherapy in patients 
with  predominantly  mUC  and  NSCLC.  Previous  assessments  have  determined  that  Atezolizumab 
pharmacokinetics is linear over a dose range of 1 to 20 mg/kg. A target efficacy serum concentration of 
6 µg/mL has been identified. In support of this application, the MAH submitted PK results from the pivotal 
IMPassion130 study. 
Pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab and Nab Paclitaxel in IMPassion130 
IMpassion130 is an ongoing Phase III, global, multicenter, double-blind, two-arm, 1:1 randomized, 
placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab administered with 
nab-paclitaxel compared with placebo in combination with nab-paclitaxel in patients with locally advanced

or metastatic TNBC who have not received prior systemic therapy for mBC (see study methods under 
clinical efficacy).  
Pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity were investigated in all 445 treated patients. The dosing regimen 
of atezolizumab was 840 mg IV Q2W. Nab-paclitaxel was administered 100 mg/m2 IV (3 weeks on, 1 
week of).  
Table 3: Clinical study for PopPK Analysis 
The  PK  objectives  for  this  study  were:  characterization  the  pharmacokinetics  of  atezolizumab  when 
administered with nab-paclitaxel, and characterization of the pharmacokinetics of nab-paclitaxel when 
administered with atezolizumab. 
The incidence of ADA against atezolizumab and the potential relationship of the immunogenicity response 
with pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy were also evaluated. 
PK samples were collected in all patients who received at least one dose of atezolizumab. Serum samples 
for PK analysis were obtained at baseline (before dosing), at post-dose (Cmax or 30 minutes after the end 
of the atezolizumab infusion at Cycle 1), and at the following timepoints: pre-dose at Cycles 2, 3, 4, 8, 16, 
at termination, and at follow-up after termination; in addition, starting from study protocol v3, samples 
were collected every 8 cycles after Cycle 16. 
A  quantitative  sandwich  ELISA  assay  was  used  to  determine  the  concentration  of  atezolizumab  and 
paclitaxel  concentrations  were  determined  with  a  liquid  chromatography  tandem  mass  spectrometry 
(LC-MS/MS) method. Anti-atezolizumab antibodies (ADAs) were detected with an ELISA assay. 
PK results 
All 445 patients in the atezolizumab-treated arm (100%) had evaluable atezolizumab pharmacokinetics. 
A  total  of  2232  atezolizumab  serum  concentrations  from  443  patients  (5.0/patients)  out  of  452  ITT 
patients (98%) were used for the popPK analysis. Of note, PK samples taken at unscheduled visits were 
also included in the analysis. Concentrations below the limit of quantification (LOQ) (439 out of 2700, 
16%),  a  moderate  fraction  of  the  dataset,  were  ignored  for  the  analysis  and  treated  as  a  missing 
dependent variable.

Pharmacokinetic data analysis 
The descriptive statistics of the maximum serum concentration (Cmax; 30 minutes following the end of 
the  infusion  in  Cycle  1)  and  minimum  serum  concentration  (Cmin;  pre-dose)  of  atezolizumab  for  the 
atezo+nP arm following 840 mg q2w IV administration of atezolizumab were summarized. 
A total of 19 patients in the atezo+nP arm had measurable pre-dose Cycle 1, Day 1 concentrations, which 
were deemed to be artifacts and excluded from the descriptive statistics. Another three Cmax values close 
to the limit of detection were also deemed not physiologically possible and excluded from the descriptive 
statistics. 
In  addition, the MAH conducted external validation of the previously established population PK model 
using PK data resulting from Study Impassion 130. The Phase  I popPK model was used to derive the 
individual PK estimates based on atezolizumab observed concentration-time profiles in IMpassion130. A 
total 443 out of the 445 treated patients (99.6%) contributed to the popPK analysis. A nonlinear mixed 
effects modeling approach was used with the Bayesian post-hoc estimation (MAXEVAL = 0) in NONMEM 
7, Version 7.3 (ICON, Maryland). 
A prediction-corrected visual predictive check (pcVPC) was performed based on the Phase I popPK model 
and  observed  peak  (Cmax)  and  trough  (Cmin)  concentrations  in  IMpassion130  compared  to 
corresponding  predictive  distributions.  Summary  statistics  of  model-derived  atezolizumab  exposure 
metrics for IMpassion130 were compared to those simulated from the Phase I model.

The  incidence  rate  of  treatment-emergent  ADA  was  13.1%  in  the  ITT  population.    On average,  Cmin 
estimates for Cycle 3, Day 27 (or pre-dose Cycle 4 or approximate steady state) in the atezo+nP arm 
were 252 µg/mL for the ADA-negative group and 188 µg/mL for the ADA-positive group (a difference of 
25.4%)  but  their  distributions  largely  overlapped.    Regardless  of  the  ADA status,  the  average  Cmin  at 
Cycle 4 were 31 to 42-fold above the target serum concentration of 6 µg/mL.

Interactions 
PK of Nab-Paclitaxel 
Following  100  mg/m2  IV  administration  of  nab-paclitaxel  (3  weeks  on,  1  week  off),  plasma  paclitaxel 
concentrations were measured with or without atezolizumab co-administration. The descriptive statistics 
of paclitaxel concentrations during infusion (5-10 minutes prior to the end of induction [EOI]) and Cmax 
(1 hour post EOI) at Cycle 3 are summarized in Table 8.  
A  total  of  781/890  patients  treated  with  nab-paclitaxel  (87.8%)  had  evaluable  paclitaxel 
pharmacokinetics; 449 from the atezo+nP arm and 332 from the nab-paclitaxel arm. A total of 6 patients 
had measurable pre-treatment concentrations, 3 in each arm. These values were deemed artifacts and 
were excluded from the summary statistics. A total of 72 paclitaxel concentrations at 1-hour post EOI 
were higher than their concentration during infusion and 148 data points were greater than 4 times the 
median. These samples were deemed not physiologically possible and were excluded from the summary 
statistics. The mean plasma paclitaxel concentrations over time are presented in Figure 6. The overall 
Cmax variability of nab-paclitaxel exposure was high (%CV of geometric mean >100%). On average, the 
nab-paclitaxel  Cmax  and  concentration  collected  during  infusion  were  comparable  with  or  without 
atezolizumab co-administration, showing a minimal percent difference of 7.5 and 3.6, respectively.

Pharmacokinetic interaction studies 
No pharmacokinetic interaction studies were submitted as part of this application (see discussion on

2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
Immunogenicity results 
At baseline, 1.6% of the ADA-evaluable patients in the atezo+nP arm had an ADA-positive sample. After 
the  first  atezolizumab  dose  (post-baseline),  13.1%  (57  patients)  and  11.8%  (21  of  178)  of  the 
ADA-evaluable  patients 
in 
the 
ITT  and  PD-L1-positive  populations, 
respectively,  were 
treatment-emergent ADA positive; all cases were treatment induced.  
The  presence  of  atezolizumab  in  ADA  serum  samples  can  interfere  with  ADA  detection.  In  validation 
experiments, the ADA assay was able to detect 500 ng/mL of surrogate positive control anti-atezolizumab 
antibodies  in  the  presence  of  200  µg/mL  atezolizumab.  Of  all  post-baseline  ADA  samples  tested,  the 
majority  (52.9%  in  the  atezo+nP  arm)  had  atezolizumab  concentrations  that  were  at  or  below  200 
µg/mL. The high proportion of samples that had drug levels within the assay drug tolerance minimized the 
likelihood of false negatives in the ADA assay. 
The impact of ADAs on PK, efficacy and safety in Impassion 130 has been investigated.  
The median PFS for ADA-negative and ADA-positive patients in the ITT population was 7.36 months and 
5.52  months,  respectively.  The  median  PFS  for  ADA-negative  and  ADA-positive  patients  in  the 
PD-L1-positive  population  was  8.11  months  and  8.25  months,  respectively.  Both  populations  had 
overlapping 95% CIs for PFS. The median OS could not be estimated for the ADA-positive subgroup.

A total of 28.1% of ADA-positive patients versus 21.5% of ADA-negative patients had serious adverse 
events (SAEs). The SAEs were those commonly reported in cancer patients and the rate difference was 
not driven by any single preferred term. 
Table 8: Safety summary profile by atezolizumab treatment-emergent ADA status 
(ADA-evaluable atezolizumab patients in pooled safety-evaluable population) 
A similar proportion of ADA-negative patients (58.6%) compared with ADA-positive patients (52.6%) had 
an AESI of any grade. Across other key AESI parameters, including Grade 3-4 AESIs, AESIs reported as 
serious and all medical concepts, both ADA subgroups were generally balanced. 
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The purpose of this application is to provide data supporting the line extension for atezolizumab to add an 
840-mg vial with 2-weekly (q2w) administration in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). In addition to 
the  currently  licensed  atezolizumab  drug  product  1200-mg  vial,  the  atezolizumab  840-mg  vial  was 
developed to facilitate a q2w administration of atezolizumab together with weekly nab-paclitaxel on a 
3-weeks on/1-week off schedule in locally advanced or metastatic TNBC. 
The  ADME  characteristics  of  atezolizumab  have  been  characterized  in  previous  submission  where 
atezolizumab was administered as monotherapy 1200 mg Q3W. In the clinical study Impassion130 in 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/425313/2019  
Page 25/122 
 
 
 
 
patients  with  TNBC,  atezolizumab  was  administered 840  mg  Q2W  in  combination  with  100  mg/m2  IV 
administration of nab paclitaxel (3 weeks on, 1 week off). 
Atezolizumab pharmacokinetics is linear over a dose range of 1 to 20 mg/kg of atezolizumab, including 
the fixed 840 mg and 1200 mg dose of atezolizumab.  
The  analytical  methods  used  are  considered  acceptable.  However,  19  patients  had  measurable 
atezolizumab prior to treatment, probably due to operational errors, e.g. sample mixed up, contamination 
during sampling handling etc.). A fully validated ELISA method was used to detect, confirm and determine 
titers of ADAs. Although no information was provided in this submission about neutralising antibodies, 
Nabs  were  also  measured  and  are  being  analysed.  The  applicant  is  recommended  to  submit  an 
assessment of the effect of atezolizumab ADAs and neutralizing antibodies on PK and efficacy endpoints 
including the results of study IMpassion130. 
The Phase I pop PK model has been assessed within previous procedures and has been deemed fit for 
purpose. Model diagnostics (external pcVPC, goodness-of-fit plots) indicate that the Phase I popPK model 
was  adequate  to  predict  atezolizumab  pharmacokinetics  in  IMpassion130  patients  and  to  estimate 
individual exposure parameters.  In relation to the comparison and analyses of atezolizumab PK across 
studies, Cmax in cycle 1 is as expected lower for the 840 mg first dose compared to the 1200 mg first 
dose, and Cmin at steady state is higher for the 840 mg Q2W dosing regimen compared to the 1200 Q3W 
dosing regimen. An increase in Ctrough_ss is expected due to the greater accumulation factor. Population 
PK suggests an increase in Ctrough_ss of 16%, data presented however indicate a greater rise in Ctrough 
levels following Q2W dosing. 
Overall,  atezolizumab  PK  measures  obtained  in  IMpassion130  are  consistent  with  the  popPK  model 
estimates derived from previous studies which indicates consistent PK of atezolizumab across indications, 
also  when  co-administered  with  nab-paclitaxel  in  patients  with  TNBC.  The  pcVPC  indicates  an 
under-estimation of the median and 5th percentile of exposure (ctrough) at steady state could be the 
result of time-dependent decrease in clearance caused by improvement in patient’s general health status 
during treatment. This has been observed for other check point inhibitors.  
A Q2W dosing regimen has been proposed and was used in the clinical study Impassion130 to support the 
Application. The Q2W dosing is more convenient since nab-paclitaxel is dosed 3 weeks on, 1 week of. The 
effort  to  align  the  dosing  regimen  of  atezolizumab  with  the  dosing  regimen  of  nab-paclitaxel  is 
acknowledged, and the observed PK data and model-predicted exposure parameters confirm that Cmin is 
maintained well above the expected target concentration of 6 µg/ml, previously identified. Both Cmax and 
Cmin from IMpassion130 are within the 95% CI of exposure predicted from a popPK model developed using 
the 1,200 mg Q3W dose regimen.  
No  apparent  PK  drug-drug  interaction  (DDI)  was  observed  when  atezolizumab  was  administered  in 
combination with nab-paclitaxel. Atezolizumab exposure was in concordance with historical data based on 
popPK  analyses.When  atezolizumab  is  administered  in  combination  with  nab-paclitaxel,  the 
pharmacokinetics of atezolizumab can be described using the popPK model developed from monotherapy 
data.  The  popPK  model  supports  the  finding  that  nab-paclitaxel  does  not  impact  atezolizumab 
pharmacokinetics  when  administered  in  combination.  Furthermore,  paclitaxel  concentrations  were 
comparable with or without atezolizumab co administration (Figure 6). 
The q3w dose of nab-paclitaxel administered at 260 mg/m2 was established from the Phase III study 
comparing paclitaxel with nab-paclitaxel. However, this dose regimen is not generally used in current 
clinical  practice.  At  the  time  of  study  initiation,  the  100  mg/m2  of  nab-paclitaxel  weekly  on  a 
3-weeks-on/1-week-off schedule was the best-studied and tolerated dose, with suggestions of improved 
efficacy and decreased toxicities in mBC compared with both higher weekly doses and the every 3-week

dosing  (see  discussion  on  clinical  efficacy).  The  covariate  effects  investigated  in  Impassion130  were 
overall consistent with previous findings and no unexpected covariates were identified.  
The post-baseline incidence of treatment-emergent atezolizumab ADA was 13.1% in the ITT population 
and 11.8% in the PD−L1−positive population. However, no data regarding neutralizing antibodies have yet 
been submitted. It is agreed that ADAs do not overall appear to have a major impact on atezolizumab PK, 
but the number of patients with treatment ADAs is small. A general trend seems to indicate lower Cmin for 
all cycles for ADA positive patients, which is in line with the POP PK results where ADA positive patients 
have a 16 % higher clearance compared to ADA negative patients. Further exploration across indications 
of  the  impact  of  ADAs  and  NAbs  on  atezolizumab  PK  and  clinical  outcomes  is  expected  in  the 
post-approval commitment agreed previously with CHMP.  
No  clear  clinically  meaningful  ER  relationships  have  previously  been  identified  for  atezolizumab  when 
patient prognostic factors (i.e., albumin, baseline sum of lesion diameter, gender, etc.) were considered 
in the analysis.  A target serum concentration of 6µg/mL has been agreed in approved indications and is 
also expected to be relevant for TNBC.  
The impact of ADAs on efficacy and safety in Impassion 130 has been investigated. The overall efficacy 
and safety profile was generally concordant between the ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients, but 
inconclusive due to small numbers (n=21). The impact of atezolizumab NAbs on efficacy is still unknown 
but likely comparable across indications. To further clarify if the presence of ADAs and/or NAbs could have 
an impact on PK, efficacy or safety, the CHMP recommended for the applicant to conduct an assessment 
of the effect of atezolizumab ADAs and Nabs across studies and indications as a post-approval measure. 
The IMpassion130 study will be included in this assessment and the MAH will also provide updated ADA 
analyses for Impassion 130 as part of the final Clinical Study Report submission.  
Overall, the proposed 840 mg Q2W atezolizumab dosing regimen is supported based on the analyses of 
PK measures in study Impassion130 and Pop PK analyses confirming an appropriate exposure and 
previously identified covariates. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The PK data and analysis submitted are adequate to support the proposed 840 mg IV Q2W dosing 
regimen of atezolizumab.

Treatments 
Atezolizumab or Placebo 
Atezolizumab  840  mg  or  placebo  is  administered  by  IV  infusion  Q2W.  Dose  reduction  of 
atezolizumab/placebo is not permitted.  
Nab-Paclitaxel 
Nab-Paclitaxel is administered according to the local prescribing information. The starting dose level of 
nab-paclitaxel is 100 mg/m2 administered intravenously over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15 of each 
28-day cycle (3 weeks on/1 week off schedule). Doses of nab-paclitaxel cannot be administered more 
frequently  than  every  7  days.  Dose  modifications  are  permitted.  Sites  were  instructed  to  follow  their 
institutional standard of care for determining the nab-paclitaxel dose for patients who are obese and for

Outcomes/endpoints 
The co-primary efficacy outcome measures to be assessed in the ITT population and in the PD-L1 selected 
subpopulation are as follows: 
• 
PFS, defined as the time from randomization to the time of radiographic progression or death 
from  any  cause  during  the  study,  whichever  occurs  first.  Progression  will  be  assessed  by  the 
investigator using RECIST v1.1 
•  OS, defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death from any cause 
The secondary efficacy outcome measures to be assessed in the ITT population and in the PD-L1 selected 
subpopulation are as follows: 
•  ORR,  defined  as  the  proportion  of  patients  with  an  objective  tumour  response  (either  partial 
response [PR] or complete response [CR] per investigator using RECIST v1.1) 
•  DOR, defined as the time from the first occurrence of a documented objective tumour response to 
the  time  of  radiographic  progression  (per  investigator  using  RECIST  v1.1)  or  death  from  any 
cause on study, whichever occurs first 
• 
TTD in global health status/HRQoL, defined by a minimally important decrease of 10 points on the 
global health status/HRQoL scale of the EORTC QLQ-C30 
Biomarker Assessment 
PD-L1 expression in IMpassion130 was assessed in both fresh and archival TNBC tumour samples by an 
external  central  laboratory  using  the  Ventana  PD-L1  (SP142)  IHC  Assay.  Patients  were  stratified  by 
PD-L1-positive  status  and  a  patient  was  considered  PD-L1  positive  when  his/her  tumour  specimen 
contained  discernible  staining  of  any  intensity  on  ICs  covering  ≥  1%  of  the  tumour  area  (IC1/2/3). 
Expression on IC was assessed as the proportion of tumour area occupied by PDL1−positive IC of any 
intensity.

Table 9: Criteria for PD-L1 Expression Assessment – Impassion130 
Randomisation  
Patients were randomized 1:1 to the pl+nP arm or the atezo+nP arm. The following stratification factors 
were used: 
• 
• 
• 
Presence of liver metastases (yes vs. no). 
Prior taxane treatment (yes vs. no). 
Tumour PD-L1 status (tumour-infiltrating immune cell score [IC] 0 vs. IC 1/2/3). 
Blinding (masking) 
This study was designed as double blind. Patients treated in the placebo+nP arm receive an injection 
consisting of the vehicle  without the antibody instead of atezolizumab. The  following individuals were 
blinded to treatment assignment and PD-L1 status: the patient; the study site personnel, including the 
investigator;  and  the  Sponsor  and  its  agents,  except  iDMC  members,  who  were  aware  of  treatment 
assignment and PD-L1 status. In addition, the PD-L1 assay provider was blinded to treatment assignment 
and PK laboratory personnel were blinded to PD-L1 status. The blind for a patient could be broken in the 
case of emergency and unblinding did not result in the withdrawal of the patient from the study. 
Statistical methods 
Co-Primary endpoint - Progression free survival 
Progression-free survival (PFS) was defined as the time from randomization to the occurrence of disease 
progression, as determined by investigators from tumour assessments, per RECIST v1.1, or death from 
any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Treatment comparisons were based on the stratified (liver metastases, PD-L1 status, and prior taxane 
treatment) log-rank test. The HR with the 95% CI was estimated using a stratified Cox regression model 
with the same stratification variables used for the stratified log-rank test. Kaplan-Meier methodology was 
used to estimate median PFS for each treatment arm and to construct survival curves for each treatment 
arm. The Brookmeyer-Crowley methodology was used to construct the 95% CI for the median PFS for 
each treatment arm. For all cases, results from an un-stratified analysis were provided.

Censoring rules 
Patients  who  have  not  experienced  disease  progression  or  death  at  the  time  of  analysis  were  to  be 
censored at the time of the last tumour assessment. Patients with no post-baseline tumour assessment 
were to be censored on the date of randomization. 
Sensitivity analyses 
•  Censoring  for  non-protocol  therapy:  Non-protocol  therapy  was  defined  as  any  anti-cancer 
therapy other than study treatment that typically is the subsequent line of therapy. A sensitivity 
analysis was to be performed in which data for patients who received NPT were to be censored at 
the last tumour assessment date before the patient received NPT. 
• 
PFS by IRC: An analysis of PFS on the basis of the IRC assessments was to be performed using the 
same methodology as specified for PFS on the basis of investigator assessment. 
Co-Primary endpoint overall survival 
Overall survival was defined as the time from the date of randomization to the date of death due to any 
cause. Patients who were not reported as having died at the time of analysis were to be censored at the 
date when they were last known to be alive. Patients who did not have post-baseline information were to 
be censored at the date of randomization. The analysis of OS was performed analogously to PFS. 
Sensitivity analyses 
Several sensitivity analyses were planned to take into account the effect of subsequent cancer therapies 
in overall survival.  
Censoring for treatment switching: Treatment switching was defined as any checkpoint inhibitor therapy 
other than study treatment as subsequent line of therapy. Censoring for treatment switching were to be 
applied to OS, analogue to censoring for NPT for PFS. 
Rank-preserving structural failure time (RPSFT) method provided an estimate of the overall survival time 
for the placebo arm had treatment switching not occurred. It estimated overall survival measured from 
the time of treatment switching by applying an estimate of the benefit of the atezolizumab treatment. The 
adjusted OS time (sum of time to switching and the estimated survival time after switching) was  then to 
be analysed together with the OS times of the patients who did not switch by using the same methodology 
as for the primary analysis of OS. 
Inverse  Probability  of  Censoring  Weighting  method:  The  idea  of  this  method  was  to  create  a  pseudo 
population that would have been observed if censoring at treatment switching had not occurred by giving 
increased weight to non-censored patients with similar characteristics to censored patients. These time 
varying weights were then included into the analysis (e.g., in a Cox model or log-rank test) so that the 
final  analysis  was  corrected  for  the  effect  of  treatment  switching.  This  method  was  not  implemented 
because  the  number  of  switching  patients  was  too  low  (29  patients,  3.2%)  for  this  method  to  be 
applicable.  
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints 
The  secondary  efficacy  endpoints  were  objective  response  rate,  duration  of  response  and  time  to 
deterioration in the Global Heath Status [GHS]/Health-Related Quality of Life [HRQoL]. 
Objective response rate was defined as the proportion of patients with measurable disease at baseline 
who  have  an  objective  response.  Patients  not  meeting  this  criterion,  including  patients  without  any 
post-baseline tumour assessment, will be considered as non-responders. Objective response rate will be 
compared between treatment arms using the stratified Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. The stratification 
factors will be the same as those described for the analysis of the primary endpoint of PFS. The difference 
Assessment report

in ORR between treatment arms will be calculated, and its 95% CI will be calculated using the normal 
approximation to the binomial distribution. An estimate of ORR will be calculated for each treatment arm, 
and its 95% CI will be calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method. ORR is simultaneously assessed in 
the ITT and PD-L1-selected subgroup with measurable disease at baseline. 
The  remaining  secondary  endpoints  (duration  of  objective  response  and  time  to  deterioration  in 
GHS/HRQoL) were not to be adjusted for multiple testing and are based on a non-randomized subset of 
patients. 
Sensitivity analyses 
For ORR and DOR the analysis were to be performed using the IRC assessment. 
Type I error control 
The type I error for this study was 0.05 (two-sided). Type I error was to be controlled for PFS and OS both 
evaluated  in  the  ITT  and  in  the  PD-L1-selected  populations.  Type  I  error  was  to  be  controlled  by 
comparing these endpoints between treatment arms according to the following testing procedure (Figure 
10). 
Figure 9: Impassion130 testing strategy – Impassion130 
At the time of the analysis of PFS, the co-primary endpoints of PFS and OS and the secondary endpoint of 
ORR were to be tested in the ITT population and in the PD-L1-selected subpopulation, as follows: 
1. Alpha (0.05) was to be allocated between PFS (0.01) and OS (0.04). The allocated type I error for PFS 
was further allocated to PFS in the ITT (0.005) and PFS in the PD-L1-selected subgroup (0.005). 
Testing of PFS and ORR 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/425313/2019  
Page 34/122 
 
 
 
 
 
2. Test the null hypothesis of no difference in PFS between the two arms in the ITT population and the 
PD-L1-selected subgroup with the allocated type I error 
3. If one or both of the null hypotheses from the step above was rejected, ORR was to be subsequently 
compared between the two arms in the corresponding populations (one or both) using a Type I error of 
0.001 for each correspondingly. 
Testing of OS 
4. At the time of the analysis of PFS, an interim analysis of OS in the ITT (OS [ITT]) was tobe performed. 
The interim analysis of OS (ITT) was to be performed regardless of the results of the analyses of PFS and 
ORR. Allocation of the alpha level to the comparison of OS (ITT) depended on the outcome of the testing 
of PFS and ORR outlined in the Steps 1-3 above. Details for the different alpha level allocations to the OS 
(ITT) testing dependent on the PFS and ORR results are provided in Table 12 (see column ‘Alpha Level’ for 
the total alpha level allocated to the OS[ITT] analysis). The interim analyses boundaries for statistical 
significance were determined based on the Lan-DeMets implementation of the O’Brien-Fleming function 
according to the Type I error allocated to the comparison of OS (ITT) (see Table 12, column ‘Stopping 
Boundary in p-value’).  
5. If hypothesis of no difference in OS in the ITT population can be rejected, OS in the PD-L1-selected 
subgroup was to be compared by subsequently using the same type I error used for OS (ITT) testing.

Numbers analysed 
A  total  of  902  patients  (ITT)  were  randomised  and  of  these  369  patients  were  PD-L1-positive  and 
reflective of the target population (185 patients randomised to the atezo-arm).  
Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy results were provided with clinical cut-off (17 April 2018) for the analyses which represents the 
protocol-defined final analysis of PFS and 1st interim analysis of OS. At the time of the primary analysis 
the median observation time was 12.9 months in both arms (80% events in the PD-L1 positive 
population). 
Updated efficacy data were submitted with data cut-off 2 January 2019 which represent the second 
interim analysis for OS (55% events in the PD-L1-positive population).

Supportive studies  
Single drug contribution - atezolizumab 
Atezolizumab was initially investigated as a single agent in patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
solid tumours or hematologic malignancies in a Phase Ia first-inhuman dose-escalation study PCD4989g 
(also referred to as GO27831). The expansion stage of this study included a cohort of 116 patients with 
TNBC, 21 of whom received atezolizumab as 1L therapy for metastatic disease. Results in this cohort of 
TNBC patients showed atezolizumab monotherapy to be well tolerated with objective clinical activity and 
durable  clinical  benefit  (Schmid  et  al.  2017).  Among  115  ORR-evaluable  patients,  INV-assessed 
confirmed  ORR  was  10%  (95%CI:  5,  16)  with  3  CR  and  8  PR.  Among  the  PD-L1-positive  patients 
(IC1/2/3),  ORR  were  reported  in  12%  of  patients  (95%CI:  6,  21)  and  no  PD-L1-negative  patients 
responded. Median DOR was 21 months (range: 3-38), and median OS was 8.9 months (95%CI: 7.0, 
12.6) for all patients with a median FU of 25.3 months. Median PFS was 1.4 months (95%CI: 1.3, 1.6) 
The safety and efficacy of atezolizumab in combination with chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab 
in  patients  with  locally  advanced  or  metastatic  solid  tumours  was  investigated  in  Study  GP28328,  a 
multi-arm, Phase Ib study. Arm F of this study tested the combination of atezolizumab (800 mg q2w) with 
nab-paclitaxel (125 mg/m2 weekly on a 3-weeks on/1-week off schedule) in female patients with TNBC 
who received no more than two prior therapies for metastatic or locally advanced disease (n=32). Results 
from this single arm demonstrated that atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel was tolerable with promising 
activity  in  mTNBC,  both  in  patients  who  received  atezolizumab  plus  nab-paclitaxel  as  1L  therapy  and 
those who received study treatment as 2L+ therapy (Pohlmann et al. 2018).

placebo-controlled, double-blinded, two-arm phase III Study WO29522 (hereinafter referred to as 
IMpassion130), which is evaluating the efficacy and safety of atezolizumab + nP compared with placebo 
plus nab-paclitaxel (hereinafter referred to as pl+nP) in patients with locally advanced or metastatic 
TNBC, who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer.

The study comprises 902 patients in total and of these, 369 patients had PD-L1 positive tumours (target 
population). The patients were recruited from 246 centres in 41 countries over approximately 2 years. 
Patients were treatment-naïve in the metastatic setting. The rate of screen failure was approximately a 
quarter of the screened patients, and this is acceptable in this setting. Only approximately 5% of the 
patients were lost to follow up, which is acceptable for this patient population. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are generally acceptable. However, the selection of patients could 
have been more detailed so that knowledge of BRCA mutation status and basal-like tumours could have 
been available for analyses. These tumour characteristics may be considered prognostic as well as 
predictive factors for treatment with atezolizumab. It is acceptable that patients with known CNS disease 
(except for treated asymptomatic CNS metastases) were excluded, indicating that patients, who were 
stable could be included. CNS metastases are frequent in this patient population, and a requested 
subgroup analyses of patients with treated asymptomatic CNS metastases present included only 26 
patients (7%) of the PD-L1 positive population, which is a too limited sample size for any firm conclusion 
(see efficacy data and additional analyses).  
The amendments and protocol violations of the pivotal study are deemed unlikely to have a relevant 
impact on the integrity of the study. 
The single pivotal study was both placebo-controlled and double-blinded which is endorsed. The sample 
size was large. However, the applied indication is for patients with PD-L1-positive tumours (n=369) and 
of these 185 patients were randomized to receive atezolizumab.  
At the final PFS analysis and pre-specified first interim analysis for OS, the iDMC recommended that the 
aggregated patient data be unblinded to the Sponsor to fully analyse the data because the pre-specified 
boundary for the co-primary endpoint of PFS in the ITT population and in the PD-L1-positive subgroup had 
been met. The Sponsor endorsed this recommendation and therefore presented these analyses as 
primary analysis for efficacy. 
The investigators were blinded to the PD-L1 status of the patient to minimize the effect of potential 
investigator-bias in PFS and ORR. The adverse reaction profile, which could potentially break the blinding 
for some individuals in case of immune-related AEs are expected to lead to bias in some cases, but this is 
difficult to avoid. However, this is not expected to have a major impact on the results, and therefore it is 
acceptable. In addition, the immune-related AE’s were rarely observed. Overall, the blinding strategy is 
considered adequate. 
Stratification factors were presence of liver metastases, prior taxane treatment, and tumour PD-L1 
status, which are considered clinically relevant in this setting because they are probably negative 
prognostic factors. Of note, prior taxane treatment is an indicator of prior (neo)-adjuvant treatment more 
than 12 months earlier, because the patients with early relapse (before 12 months) and a very poor 
prognosis were already excluded. In addition, the nature of TNBC is very aggressive causing a higher 
incidence of inoperable primary tumours that require neo-adjuvant pre-operative treatment before 
resection. Hence, the study population may not properly reflect the patient population of TNBC in the 
clinic. Relevant inclusion and exclusion criteria have been reflected in section 5.1 of the SmPC. 
The applicant has adequately justified the choice of PD-L1 cutoff and the relevance of combination 
therapy. In the pivotal study IMpassion130, there were very few patients who had tumours with high 
PD-L1 expression (IC≥10%, n=35) i.e. IC3. The applicant has shown efficacy in the IC≥1% and <5% 
group (IC1), IC≥5% and IC<10% (IC2), so the chosen cut-off point of IC ≥1% is considered justified. The 
applicant has also clearly demonstrated that PD-L1 negative patients do not derive any benefit by addition 
of atezolizumab, which also supports the chosen cutoff. With regards to the relevance of the combination 
therapy, data presented from two studies (PCD4989g and GP28328) showed that atezolizumab 
monotherapy only had a modest efficacy in the mTNBC setting.

The evaluation of biomarkers has been listed as exploratory endpoint (including tumour biopsies at the 
time of radiographic disease progression, if clinically feasible and optional biopsies pre-dose on Cycle 2 for 
separately consenting patients). The MAH clarified that the additional biomarker analyses will be 
performed in Q1 2021 as a recommendation andas part of the final CSR.  
Nab-paclitaxel has been questioned as the comparator because it is not standard of care in the treatment 
of breast cancer in Europe. However, the MAH has justified the appropriateness of nab-paclitaxel as 
comparator and in particular use of the applied dose regimen in the pivotal trial. It is acknowledged that, 
at the time of designing the pivotal trial Impassion130, the general hypothesis was that the 
immunosuppressive effects of steroids could potentially inhibit the immune-mediated anti-tumour 
activity of PD-L1 blockade with immunotherapies such as atezolizumab explaining the choice of a steroid 
sparing chemotherapy such as nab-paclitaxel. The applicant argues that this could particularly apply for 
TNBC, because of its lower immunogenicity and mutational burden compared with other 
immunotherapy-responsive cancers (e.g., melanoma, lung, and bladder cancers). This hypothesis is not 
considered substantiated at the present time (Postow et al. N Engl J Med 2018; 378:158-168), but it was 
a major concern when immunotherapy emerged and at the time of choosing nab-paclitaxel as the 
comparator. In addition, nab-paclitaxel is directly recommended in the NCCN clinical practice guidelines 
and indirectly by the ESMO guidelines, who recommends taxane-based regimens in general in the 
first-line setting of HER2-negative mBC. The used dosing regimen of 100mg/m2 weekly Q3W is partly 
supported by a recent publication (Arpino et al. 2016). More importantly, the efficacy outcome of the 
control arm in IMpassion130 is comparable to historical controls, so no detrimental effects of this dosing 
schedule is evident. Overall, it is acknowledged that a steroid sparing chemotherapy such as 
nab-paclitaxel was used based on the available knowledge about steroids impact on efficacy at the time 
of the choice of comparator. Hence, the choice of nab-paclitaxel as comparator and its dosing regimen is 
acceptable. In addition, the applicant will provide results by June 2021 from the ongoing study that is 
currently studying paclitaxel instead of nab-paclitaxel using the same study design (Impassion 131). 
Baseline demographics were well balanced regarding age, age-groups, sex, race, and PS. Only two 
patients had PS 2, which is not reflective of the general patient population, but considered acceptable in 
a clinical study. The majority of women were post-menopausal (59.5%) even though TNBC is more 
common in young, premenopausal women. Overall, patient demographics and baseline tumour disease in 
patients with PD-L1 expression ≥1% were generally representative of the broader study population (see 
SmPC section 5.1). 
Half of the patients had received prior taxane treatment, but this is considered acceptable as the taxane 
was given as an (neo)-adjuvant treatment ≥12 months prior to randomization, and it was a stratification 
factor. Almost a third of the patients had liver metastases, half had lung metastases and 2/3 of the 
patients had chemotherapy before in the (neo)-adjuvant setting, which is considered reflective of TNBC 
as an aggressive breast cancer subtype with a poor prognosis and visceral metastases are often present 
at the time of metastatic disease. Only approximately 7% of patients had brain metastases at baseline, 
probably because known CNS disease, except for treated asymptomatic CNS metastases were an 
exclusion criterion. This is understandable since these patients have a very poor prognosis but it is not 
reflective of the patient population as the risk of CNS metastasis is high with TNBC in the metastatic 
setting. However, due to randomisation and that the incidence was well-balanced between the arms, it is 
considered acceptable. Furthermore, patients excluded from clinical trials have been adequately reflected 
in section 4.4 of the SmPC, i.e. patients with a history of autoimmune disease, history of pneumonitis, 
active brain metastasis, HIV, hepatitis B or hepatitis C infection, significant cardiovascular disease and 
patients with inadequate hematologic and end-organ function; patients who were administered a live, 
attenuated vaccine within 28 days prior to enrolment; systemic immunostimulatory agents within 4 
weeks or systemic immunosuppressive medicinal products within 2 weeks prior to study entry.

PFS and OS were co-primary endpoints and this is acceptable and in line with previous advice. To detect 
investigator bias of PFS, independent review of the imaging data was performed and this is endorsed. The 
secondary endpoints of ORR, DOR, and time to deterioration of global health status (TTD) are clinically 
relevant as well, and especially TTD is considered indicative of detrimental effects on QOL.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The clinical cut-off was 17 April 2018 for the analyses presented initially corresponding to the 
protocol-defined final analysis of PFS and 1st interim analysis of OS. Updated efficacy data were 
submitted with a data cut-off 2 January 2019 consisting in results from the second interim analysis for OS 
along with updated PFS and DOR results.  
The median number of treatment cycles was 7 for atezolizumab and 6 for nab-paclitaxel in each treatment 
arm. 
The final analysis of PFS in the ITT population is the co-primary endpoint and it was met. In addition, there 
were approximately 80% PFS events in the atezo-arm, so the data for PFS are considered mature. Median 
duration of survival follow-up was ~19 months (range 0.0-40.8) in the PD-L1 positive population.  
Relevant for the applied indication is primarily the results from the PD-L1-positive population, where 
updated PFS was 7.5 months vs 5.3 months, HR 0.63 (95%CI: 0.50, 0.80), which is statistically 
significant. This result is also considered clinically relevant because the curves clearly separate, 
suggesting long-term benefit in a subgroup of patients as often observed with immunotherapy. This is 
now supported by more mature OS data. Promising long-term benefit is also reflected by the updated 
1-year event-free rate in the atezo-arm (30.3% vs 17.3%). PFS by IRC show a similar result: PFS HR 0.63 
(95%CI: 0.49, 0.81), which adds to the robustness of data.  
Optimally, the benefitting subgroup could be better defined than by PD-L1 ≥ 1%. However, no better 
biomarker has been identified at the present time and this is acknowledged. OS in the ITT population is 
the other co-primary endpoint and it was not met in either the first or second IA. However, there were 
~50% events in the atezo-arm of the PD-L1 positive population at data cut-off 2 January 2019, so the 
data are now considered more mature. Moreover, the relevant OS data for the applied indication is 
primarily the results from the PD-L1 positive population, where OS was improved to 25 months vs 18 
months, HR 0.71 (95%CI: 0.54, 0.93), but this result could not be formally tested, because OS in the ITT 
population was not statistically significant. The median OS of the control arm of the ITT population (18.7 
months) and historical data are similar (17.5 months, Miles et al. 2013). Even though the result of OS 
cannot be formally tested, the numerical difference of 7 months is considered clinically relevant. As with 
PFS, the OS curves clearly separate, demonstrating a long-term benefit for this subgroup of patients. This 
is also reflected by the 2-year event-free rate in the atezo-arm (36.9% vs 50.7%).  
Overall, sensitivity analyses for PFS and OS (including IRC assessment and different censoring rules for 
PFS) were consistent with those observed in the primary analysis. Only very few patients (3% in each 
arm) had received a checkpoint inhibitor post-PD at the time of data cut-off. 
From a statistical point of view, it is noticed that the time points chosen for the different interim and final 
analyses for OS are variable and depend on the results of PFS and ORR. In other words, unblinded data 
is used to select the number of events used in the interim analyses for OS. There is uncertainty whether 
this adaptive feature affects the type I error. Given a moderate maximal increase in the effective sample 
size for OS of around 5%, the issue is considered to not impact the PFS results in a meaningful way. 
However, the MAH will be expected to show that the type 1 error is strongly controlled in case the OS 
results for the ITT population turn out to be statistically significant at a later stage, when submitting the 
final CSR. The hierarchical testing for ORR is agreed and the use of the LanDeMets function to adjust the 
alpha level within the OS interim analyses seems appropriate.

ORR in the ITT population was higher in the atezo-arm, mainly due to an increased rate of CR (7.1% vs 
1.6%). In the PD-L1-positive population, a difference of ~15% was observed with an ORR of 58.4% vs 
42.6%, Odds ratio 1.96 (95%CI: 1.29-2.98). The complete response rate and PR was also increased to 
CR 10.3% and PR 48.6% in the atezo-arm. Another ~20% of the patients had stable disease with 
atezolizumab. This is considered clinically relevant as these patients have multiple sites of metastases 
and a high incidence of visceral metastases, so the improved response rate will most likely translate into 
improved clinical benefit by the relief of symptoms and decreased disease manifestations. In addition, the 
applicant provided data on the clinical benefit rate (CBR) of the treatment arms in the PD-L1-positive 
population, using confirmed rates of CR+PR+SD>6 months for the calculation, and the difference of 
20.7% (95%CI: 10.1; 31.2) in favour of the atezolizumab arm is considered supportive of the co-primary 
endpoints.   
The duration of response in the atezolizumab arm of the ITT population was 7.4 months, which is 
statistically significantly longer than with placebo (5.6 months). This difference was even greater in the 
PD-L1 population (8.5 vs 5.5 months) and this is considered clinically relevant. The DOR was updated and 
considered mature as ~70% of patients were responders with a subsequent event and ~28% of the 
patients have an ongoing response at data cut-off in the PD-L1 positive population.  
The time to deterioration (a sustained ≥ 10-point decline from baseline score) of patient-reported global 
health status/health-related quality of life as measured by the EORTC QLQ-C30 was similar in each 
treatment group indicating that all patients maintained their baseline HRQoL for a comparable duration of 
time (see SmPC section 5.1).  
Patients with PD-L1 expression <1% did not show improved PFS when atezolizumab was added to 
nab-paclitaxel (HR of 0.94, 95% CI 0.78, 1.13) (see SmPC section 5.1). 
Exploratory subgroup analyses were performed in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%, exploring prior 
(neo)adjuvant treatment, BRCA1/2 mutation and asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline.  
In the IMpassion130 study, of the 614 patients tested, 89 (15%) carried pathogenic BRCA1/2 mutations. 
From the PD-L1+/BRCA1/2 mutant subgroup, 19 patients received atezolizumab plus nab-paclitaxel and 
26 placebo plus nab-paclitaxel. Based on exploratory analysis and acknowledging the small sample size, 
the presence of BRCA1/2 mutation does not seem to impact the PFS clinical benefit of atezolizumab and 
nab-paclitaxel. (see SmPC section 5.1). 
There was no evidence of efficacy in patients with asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline, although 
the number of patients treated was small; the median PFS was 2.2 months in the atezolizumab plus 
nab-paclitaxel arm (n=15) compared to 5.6 months in the placebo plus nab-paclitaxel arm (n=11) (HR 
1.40; 95% CI 0.57, 3.44). 
In patients who had received prior (neo) adjuvant treatment (n=242), the hazard ratio for PFS was 0.79 
and 0.82 for OS while in patients who had not received prior (neo)adjuvant treatment (n=127), the 
hazard ratio for PFS was 0.44 and 0.53 for OS (see SmPC section 5.1). In these patients only a small 
benefit regarding OS was demonstrated by the addition of atezolizumab to nab-paclitaxel compared to 
patients who were chemotherapy-naïve. This was evident both for patients who had prior anthracycline 
and/or prior taxane.  
New analyses with adjustments for strong prognostic factors show that the PFS for the PD-L1 positive 
taxane-pretreated patients was still statistically significant, which is encouraging. Although the 
improvement of PFS in the taxane-pretreated patients was less than in the taxane-naïve patients, this 
analysis is considered supportive of the indication claimed. The subgroup analyses of patients who were 
anthracycline-pretreated were difficult to assess, as most of these patients (85%) were also 
taxane-pretreated patients, and anthracycline pre-treatment was not a stratification factor. It is agreed 
that there is no sign of lack of efficacy regarding PFS of nab-paclitaxel after prior exposure to taxane and 
Assessment report

no concerning signals regarding safety were observed. Given the demonstrated PFS benefit and the lack 
of a detrimental effect on OS, it is agreed that patients with prior (neo) adjuvant treatment should not be 
excluded from the proposed indication. Furthermore since the above information is considered clinically 
relevant for individual treatment decisions it has been reflected in the SmPC (see section 5.1).   
Due to a very small sample size of the target population (n=21) it is not possible to draw any firm 
conclusions regarding the impact of ADA status on efficacy in the PD-L1-positive populations of the pivotal 
study. However, the applicant will provide immunogenicity data further to a recommendation by the 
CHMP. 
2.5.4.  Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The results from the pivotal study demonstrate benefit of atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel 
for the first-line treatment of patients with advanced or metastatic TNBC through a clinically meaningful 
and statistically significant PFS advantage compared to the comparator arm. This is supported by a 
clinically meaningful improvement of ORR, DOR and OS benefit for the targeted population.  
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
Safety data were provided for 890 safety-evaluable patients (all patients who have received at least one 
dose of study treatment) from the pivotal Study IMpassion130: n=438 pl+nP and n=452 atezo+nP (Table 
4). 
Pooled monotherapy data were also presented for 3178 atezolizumab-treated patients (all patients who 
received  at  least  one  dose  of  atezolizumab).  The  monotherapy  population  was  the  largest  pooled 
population available to date for atezolizumab, and the majority was patients with second-line and beyond 
(2L+) urothelial carcinoma (UC) and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Table 37). Study PCD4989g, 
however, enrolled patients with a variety of solid tumours and hematological malignancies, including 116 
patients with first-line and beyond (1L+) mTNBC.

Impassion130 and atezolizumab monotherapy pooled dataset 
Immune-related hepatitis as a clinical diagnosis was observed in 17 patients (7 in pl+nP arm and 10 in 
atezo+nP arm). Three patients in the atezo arm had autoimmune hepatitis (2 grade 3 and 1 grade 5). 
Serious  events  were  rare  but  more  frequent  in  the  atezo  arm  (1.3%  vs.  0.7%)  and  less  than  1% 
discontinued any treatment due to immune-related hepatitis. Eleven patients in the atezo arm required 
treatment with systemic corticosteroids.  
Immune-related hyperthyroidism was observed in 4.4% of patients in the atezo arm, only 1 patient had 
a <grade 3 event and overall the event was clinically manageable. 
Immune-related  pneumonitis  was  observed  in  3.1%  of  patients  in  the  atezo  arm  (n=14),  and  only  1 
patient had a <grade 3 event, which required discontinuation of atezolizumab. Overall, the event was 
clinically manageable. 
Infusion-related reactions were rarely observed (1.1%, n=5) in the atezo arm, and all events were of low 
grade.  The  number  of  events  were  similar  in  both  treatment  arms  and  none  caused  treatment

discontinuation. In addition, there were no cases of cytokine release syndrome, which is observed in 1 
patient in the monotherapy population. Hence, the event was clinically manageable.  
Immune-related  colitis  is  a  known  ADR  to  atezolizumab  and  the  rate  was  similar  to  the  rate  in  the 
mono-therapy  population  (1.1%,  n=5).  One  patient  discontinued  treatment  and  there  were  no  fatal 
events. The event was clinically manageable.  
Immune-related  meningo-encephalitis  rarely  occurred  and  in  the  pivotal  study,  none  had  more  than 
grade 1-2 events. There were no discontinuations due to this event, which was clinically manageable. 
Immune-related adrenal insufficiency was rare in the atezo arm (0.9%, n=4), but there was one patient 
with  acute  adrenal  insufficiency  which  required  discontinuation.  The  patient  had  recovered  by  clinical 
cut-off date (CCOD).  
The rate of immune-related pancreatitis was very rare (0.4%, n= 2) in the atezo arm and did not cause 
clinical symptoms or discontinuations. The events were clinically manageable. 
Immune-related diabetes occurred in 1 patient in the atezo arm, which corresponds to the incidence in 
the monotherapy population. Grade 3 ketoacidosis was observed, which had resolved by the CCOD and 
did not cause discontinuation. The event was overall considered clinically manageable. 
Immune-related nephritis was observed in one patient in the atezo arm and required discontinuation.  
Immune-related rash was very common in the atezo arm and was observed in a third of the patients. One 
patient  had  a  serious  event  and  6.2%  (n=28)  of  patients  required  treatment  with  systemic 
corticosteroids. The overall risk was lower in the monotherapy population (19.5% vs 34.1%). Serious 
events  and  discontinuations  were  similar  in  the  pivotal  study  and  the  monotherapy  population.  One 
patient discontinued treatment in the pivotal study. 
Immune-related  ocular  inflammatory  toxicity  were  observed  in  3  patients  (0.7%)  in  the  atezo  arm, 
leading 2  more than  grade  3  events.  No  patients  required  discontinuation  of  treatment  and  1 patient 
received corticosteroids. 
Immune-related severe cutaneous reactions were reported rarely and in similar numbers between the 
treatment arms and the monotherapy population. There were no serious events nor any discontinuations. 
One patient required corticosteroids.  
Rhabdomyolysis was observed in one patient in the atezo arm, and the event was not-resolved at CCOD 
and lead to dose interruption.

AEs leading to dose interruption 
Per protocol, dose reductions of placebo/atezolizumab were not permitted. A higher proportion of patients 
in the atezo+nP arm (30.8%) compared with the pl+nP arm (23.5%) experienced AEs leading to dose 
interruption of placebo/atezolizumab. The higher incidence in the atezo+nP arm was due to more patients 
experiencing AEs in the SOCs of General Disorders and Administration Site Conditions (e.g., pyrexia), 
Blood and Lymphatic System Disorders (neutropenia), Investigations (decreased neutrophil count), 
Respiratory, Thoracic and Mediastinal Disorders (pneumonitis) and Endocrine Disorders (hyperthyroidism 
and hypothyroidism). The most commonly reported (≥2% of patients in either arm) AEs leading to dose 
interruption of placebo/atezolizumab were neutropenia (1.8% pl+nP vs. 3.8% atezo+nP), neutrophil count 
decreased (1.4% vs. 2.7%), pyrexia (0.5% vs. 2.0%), and hyperthyroidism (0.2% vs. 2.0%). 
A higher proportion of patients in the atezo+nP arm (43.1%) compared with the pl+nP arm (39.3%) 
experienced AEs leading to dose reduction or interruption of nab-paclitaxel. The most commonly reported 
(≥2% of patients in either arm) AEs leading to dose reduction or interruption of nab-paclitaxel were 
neutropenia (7.5% pl+nP vs. 9.3% atezo+nP), neutrophil count decreased (5.0% vs. 6.9%), peripheral 
sensory neuropathy (2.5% vs. 2.7%), pyrexia (0.9% vs. 2.7%), neutrophil count decreased (5.0% vs. 
6.9%), neuropathy peripheral (3.0% vs. 2.4%), fatigue (1.6% vs. 2.4%), and leukopenia (0.7% vs.

2.0%). Events which contributed to the overall higher incidence in the atezo+nP arm included 
neutropenia/decreased neutrophil count, pneumonitis, and pyrexia. 
Post marketing experience 
As of 17 May 2018, a total of 20,783 patients had been exposed to atezolizumab monotherapy in the 
post-marketing setting. No new risks beyond those identified in the clinical trial setting have been 
identified so there are no major concerns related to the safety profile of atezolizumab. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety database related to the proposed dosing regimen is 452 patients. The applicant presented 
pooled safety data from an “atezolizumab monotherapy” population of 3178 patients and pooled safety 
data from an “atezolizumab in combination therapy” population of 1797. 
The applicant applies for a new dosing regimen and therefore safety data from the Impassion 130 will be 
the primary focus in this assessment of the safety profile of atezo + nP. 
The median duration of treatment with both atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel was approximately 5 
months. Exposure to nab-paclitaxel was for the majority of patients approximately 9-12 months, which is 
consistent with the normal clinical use of chemotherapy in this target population, as chemotherapy is 
given until progression or intolerable toxicity. In the case of nab-paclitaxel, it is expected that maximum 
12-15 months of therapy is tolerable and this is consistent with data available. The mean number of 
cycles and duration of therapy with nab-paclitaxel was similar in both arms. Exposure to atezolizumab 
was for 68.8% of the patients more than 6 months and 30.5% of the patients were exposed for more than 
12 months. The mean number of cycles was slightly higher in the atezolizumab arm compared to placebo, 
so no detrimental effect is present. The overall exposure of atezolizumab is considered acceptable for an 
evaluation of the safety profile, considering the rate of progression in the targeted patient population.  
Almost every patient (99.3%) in the atezolizumab arm experienced at least 1 adverse event and the 
majority were assessed to be treatment-related (96.5%). Grade 3-4 treatment-related events occurred 
in 39.6% in the atezolizumab arm compared to 15.9% of patients in the atezolizumab monotherapy pool, 
which is considered acceptable, as the majority were known chemotherapy-related ADRs. Serious 
adverse events were observed in more patients in the atezolizumab arm (22.8%), however, only 12.4% 
of these were treatment-related.  
In the relevant arm (atezolizumab+nP), the most frequent AEs were chemotherapy-related, such as 
alopecia, fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, anaemia, constipation and neutropenia. It is noted that more 
patients in the atezolizumab arm compared with placebo had nausea (46% vs 38%), cough (25% vs 
19%), neutropenia (20.8% vs 15.3%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (15.9% vs 11.9%). Notably 
more patients had hypothyroidism (13.7% vs 3.4%), and this is acceptable knowing this is a common 
ADR to atezolizumab and an adverse event of special interest (AESIs). The level of neutropenia, 
peripheral sensory neuropathy, and hypothyroidism is acceptable considering the severity of the treated 
disease and the palliative setting.  
Clinically relevant grade 3-4 events were rare (~5% of patients per PT) and consisted of peripheral 
neuropathy (5.5%), pneumonia (2.2%), fatigue (4.0%), and diarrhea (1.3%) and there were no clinically 
meaningful difference between the treatment arms. The level of grade 3-4 events is also considered 
acceptable. Grade 3-4 treatment-related AEs that were reported at a higher frequency in the 
atezolizumab arm compared with the placebo were peripheral neuropathy (5.5% vs 2.7%) and decreased 
neutrophil count (4.6% vs 3.4%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/425313/2019  
Page 99/122 
 
 
 
AESIs of low grade were observed in approximately half of the patients in the atezolizumab arm. This is 
acceptable as only 7.5% had grade 3-4 events and only 1 patient a grade 5 event. AESIs rarely led to 
withdrawal of any treatment (1.8%). Most common AESIs in the atezolizumab arm vs monotherapy were 
immune-related events such as rash (34.1% vs 19.5%), hypothyroidism (17.3% vs 5.2%), lab-abnormal 
hepatitis (13.7% vs 9.9%), and hyperthyroidism (4.4% vs 0.9%). The higher incidence of 
laboratory-abnormal hepatitis is most likely attributable to nab-paclitaxel and there are no signs of a 
synergistic toxicity. With regards to thyroid function, it is considered plausible that the more frequent 
monitoring of thyroid function may be the leading cause of the higher incidence of hypothyroidism or 
hyperthyroidism in the Impassion130 study. It cannot be ruled out that the addition of nab-paclitaxel 
increases the risk of immune-related rash. Overall, the events of laboratory-abnormal hepatitis, thyroid 
function, and rash are appropriately reflected in the SmPC. 
Immune-related hepatitis as a clinical diagnosis was observed in 17 patients (7 in pl+nP arm and 10 in 
atezo+nP arm). This event was rare but maybe fatal and is already included as an ‘Important identified 
risk’ in the list of safety concerns with atezolizumab in the RMP. 
Immune-related adrenal insufficiency was rare in the atezolizumab arm (0.9%, n=4), but there was one 
patient with acute adrenal insufficiency who required discontinuation. The patient had recovered by 
CCOD. This event is known with immunotherapy such as atezolizumab and there may be an increased 
focus on discovering such events early, which may cause more testing and diagnosing than previously, 
and this may explain the slight increase in incidence compared to the monotherapy safety population. In 
addition, these small numbers causes uncertainties and the low incidence observed is of no major 
concern. Overall, the events are clinically manageable when diagnosed. 
Serious adverse events were rare but occurred more frequently in the atezolizumab arm (5.3% vs 2.1%). 
The most common SAEs in the atezolizumab arm were pneumonia (2.2%), urinary tract infection (1.1%), 
pyrexia (1.1%), and dyspnoea (1.1%). Especially the number of pneumonias was significantly increased 
in the atezolizumab arm. This may be due to the difficulty of diagnosing pneumonia vs pneumonitis, which 
is a known adverse effect of atezolizumab. The case of fatal pneumonia was clarified as not considered 
related to study drug which is reassuring. Overall, the SAEs are adequately categorized. 
Overall, more deaths occurred in the placebo arm and the majority of patients died from progressive 
disease. However, more patients died due to an AE in the atezolizumab arm (1.3% vs 0.7%), but data are 
still considered immature regarding deaths. It was clarified that around 3-4% of the patients died from 
other causes and no deaths were due to treatment-related AEs. The vast majority of deaths categorised 
as other causes were due to disease progression on subsequent therapies.  
Regarding shifts in laboratory safety parameters, the most concerning issues were the lowering of 
potassium, sodium, haemoglobin, and leukocytes. However, the differences were small and considered 
acceptable. No direct treatment-related case of Hy’s law was observed in the study. 
The incidence of adverse events was significantly increased in patients of more than 65 years of age. This 
included grade 3-4 AEs, SAEs, AESIs, and AEs leading to withdrawal from any treatment. The most 
common grade 3-4 events with increased incidence in the >65 year olds were peripheral 
neuropathy/polyneuropathy, AST increased, anaemia, leukopenia, and urinary tract infections (UTIs). All 
of the UTIs except 1 were in the older patient group. However, based on the provided data review and 
analysis of age-related risk factors including the effect of nab-paclitaxel in elderly patients, it is agreed 
that the observed differences are primarily due to nab-paclitaxel and are not due to a specific effect of the 
combination. Therefore, it is acceptable that no update to the SmPC for atezolizumab is provided in this 
regard.

There were limited sample sizes of the 75-84 years and ≥ 85 years subgroups in both treatment arms, 
therefore no firm conclusion can be drawn from these data. Data for patients ≥75 years of age are too 
limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 4.8 of the SmPC). 
Amongst 434 patients in study IMpassion130, 13% (n=57) tested positive for treatment-emergent 
antibodies (ADAs) at one or more post-dose time points. Overall, ADA status appeared to have no 
clinically relevant impact on safety. (see clinical pharmacology section and SmPC section 4.8). The overall 
safety profile was similar between the ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients, acknowledging the small 
sample size of ADA-positive patients (n=57). It is noted that 28.1% of ADA-positive patients versus 
21.5% of ADA-negative patients experienced SAEs and that more ADA-positive patients discontinued 
atezo/placebo. The rates of grade 3-4 leukopenia and dyspnoea were also increased in the ADA-positive 
population. However, summary of AESIs according to ADA-status showed no clear pattern of change in 
the safety profile. Overall, ADA status appeared to have no clinically relevant impact on safety. 
AEs leading to discontinuation of placebo/atezolizumab occurred in more patients in the atezolizumab 
arm (6.4% vs 1.4%). Most common AEs leading to withdrawal was neuropathy (6 vs 1 patients), which 
indicates that atezolizumab more frequently induces severe neuropathy than nab-paclitaxel alone. The 
risks are most likely related to the total exposure of drugs causing neuropathy, such as taxanes, and to 
the cumulative effect of these drugs. Unfortunately, no new information has emerged, so it is still 
primarily the known cumulative effect of taxanes that should be considered, when initiating 
nab-paclitaxel and atezolizumab and this is appropriately reflected in the nab-paclitaxel SmPC with a 
reference in the SmPC of atezolizumab (Section 4.4). Peripheral neuropathies will continue to be closely 
monitored. 
AEs leading to discontinuation of nab-paclitaxel also occurred more frequently in the atezolizumab arm 
(15.9% vs. 8.2%). Even though more patients discontinue nab-paclitaxel due to AEs in the atezolizumab 
arm, the exposure to nab-paclitaxel was similar between the treatment arms, so this finding is 
acceptable. It is to be expected that an addition of therapy, in this case atezolizumab, causes more AEs, 
and there are no signs of a detrimental effect on exposure to chemotherapy in the presented data.  
Comparing to the monotherapy population, the rate of discontinuations is similar (7.1%) and this is 
reassuring. Overall, there are no new safety signals in the pivotal study and the discontinuation rates of 
atezolizumab or nab-paclitaxel of 6.4% and 15.9%, respectively, are considered acceptable in this 
palliative setting. 
AEs leading to dose interruption/modification of placebo/atezolizumab were more common in the 
atezolizumab arm (30.8% vs 23.5%), and the most common AEs were neutropenia (3.8% vs 1.8%), 
neutrophil count decreased (2.7% vs 1.4%), pyrexia (2.0% vs 0.5%), and hyperthyroidism (2.0% vs. 
0.2%). A similar rate of dose reduction or interruption of nab-paclitaxel were observed between the 
treatment arms (43.1% vs 39.3%) and were mostly due to neutropenia, neuropathy, and pyrexia. 
Overall, the AEs leading to dose interruption/modification of atezolizumab or nab-paclitaxel were known 
with these treatments and the rate was acceptable for this palliative setting. 
Section 4.4 of the SmPC of atezolizumab has been updated to reflect that neutropenia and peripheral 
neuropathies occurring during treatment with atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel may be reversible with 
interruptions of atezolizumab and/or nab-paclitaxel. Physicians should consult the nab-paclitaxel 
summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for specific precautions and contraindications of this medicine 
(see SmPC section 4.4). 
Regarding the PD-L1 positive group, there was a lower number of deaths in the PD-L1-positive group in 
the atezolizumab arm in comparison to the safety evaluable population. This may be correlated to 
improved efficacy. Slightly more patients discontinued any study treatment, most often nab-paclitaxel.

or SAEs between the subpopulation, which is reassuring. The PD-L1 positive population who received 
atezolizumab (n=185) had approximately the same rate of toxicity as the PD-L1 negative population who 
received atezolizumab, also indicating a similar safety profile regardless of PD-L1 status. 
From the safety database all the adverse reactions reported in clinical trials have been included in the 
Summary of Product Characteristics. Section 4.8 of the SmPC has been updated with pooled data from 
IMpassion130, IMpower150 Arms A+B, IMmotion 150/151 and IMpassion130 in which atezolizumab was 
given in combination with other agents. This is considered acceptable. The same recommendations in 
terms of dose delay or discontinuation as for other approved indications apply (see Table 1 of SmPC 
section 4.2). Dose reductions of Tecentriq are not recommended. If a planned dose of Tecentriq is missed, 
it should be administered as soon as possible. The schedule of administration must be adjusted to 
maintain the appropriate interval between doses (see SmPC section 4.2). 
The identified and potential risks for atezolizumab are well characterized from previous procedures. The 
indication assessed, for atezolizumab with nab-paclitaxel in TNBC brings no changes to the identified and 
potential risks and no newly identified safety concerns.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety profile of the combination of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel is as expected and consists of a 
combination of chemotherapy and immune-related adverse drug reactions. There were no new safety 
signals and the toxicities were generally clinically manageable. The discontinuation rate is considered 
acceptable. In conclusion, the safety profile is considered overall acceptable in this treatment setting.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The claimed indication for Tecentriq, 840 mg concentrate for solution for infusion, is in combination with 
nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of adult patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic 
triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumours have PD-L1 expression ≥1% and who have not 
received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease. 
Metastatic TNBC is incurable and the main goals with treatment are life-prolongation and palliation of 
symptoms. Compared to other subtypes of breast cancer, TNBC tumours are generally more aggressive 
leading to a high risk of visceral metastases and a very poor prognosis. The estimated 5-year survival rate 
for metastatic TNBC is 9% in the SEER database. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current treatment options for triple-negative metastatic breast cancer (mTNBC) is the use of sequential 
single-agent chemotherapy. No single chemotherapy-agent has demonstrated clear superiority and is 
considered the preferred agent in the first-line metastatic setting. There are several active agents 
considered appropriate for first-line chemotherapy, including taxanes, anthracyclines, capecitabine, 
gemcitabine, platinum-based compounds, vinorelbine, and ixabepilone. Several diverse genetic subtypes 
have been identified in TNBC. However, apart from BRAC1/2 there is still a lack of common targetable 
mutations. There are no immunotherapies approved for use in the treatment of TNBC. Recently PARP 
inhibitors have been approved for the treatment of advanced TNBC with germline BRCA1/2 mutations in 
patients who have been previously treated with an anthracycline and/or a taxane.  
The disease usually progresses rapidly despite palliative chemotherapy, and multiple studies have shown 
a median PFS of approximately 6 months and a median OS of approximately 16 months (see 2.1.4. 
Clinical presentation, diagnosis and stage/prognosis). Hence, there is an unmet medical need for 
treatment of metastatic TNBC. 
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
The pivotal study for this application is the Impassion130 study, which is a fully recruited, ongoing, 
international, multicenter, randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, two-arm Phase III Study. 
The ITT population consisted of 902 patients, who were randomized 1:1 to receive atezolizumab 
+ nab-paclitaxel compared with placebo plus nab-paclitaxel in patients with metastatic TNBC, who had not 
received prior chemotherapy for metastatic breast cancer (first-line setting). The pivotal study comprised 
369 patients with PD-L1 ≥ 1% tumours, who were exposed to atezolizumab, which is the relevant study 
population for the applied indication that includes only this subgroup of patients. 
The co-primary efficacy endpoints included investigator-assessed progression free survival (PFS) in the 
ITT population and in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% per RECIST v1.1 as well as overall survival 
(OS) in the ITT population and in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1%. Secondary efficacy endpoints 
included objective response rate (ORR) and duration of response (DOR) per RECIST v1.1, and time to 
deterioration in global health status (TDD).

3.2.  Favourable effects 
The study met the co-primary endpoint of PFS in ITT and PD-L1-population. With a median follow up of 13 
months, the study treatment resulted in a statistically significant and clinically relevant improvement of 
PFS in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% population from 5.3 months to 7.5 months, HR 0.63 (95%CI: 0.50-0.80). In 
addition, there were 80.5% PFS events in the atezo-arm, so the data for PFS are considered mature. 
The co-primary endpoint of OS in the ITT population was not statistically significant, so it could not be 
statistically tested in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% population. However, OS in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% population was 
improved by 7 months from 18.0 months to 25.0 months, which is considered clinically relevant in the 
treatment of mTNBC.  
Secondary endpoints were ORR, DOR, and TTD (Time to deterioration in global health status/HRQoL). 
ORR in the PD-L1 ≥ 1%population was 58.9% in the atezolizumab arm compared to 42.6% in the placebo 
arm. In the atezolizumab arm, CR and PR were increased from 1.1% to 10.3% and from 41.5% to 48.6%, 
respectively. DOR in the PD-L1 ≥ 1% population was improved from 5.5 months to 8.5 months, HR 0.62 
(95%CI: 0.44, 0.86).  
In the ITT population, there were no apparent differences in time to deterioration in global health 
status/HRQoL between the treatment arms (8.0 vs 8.3 months). This indicates that there are no 
detrimental effects of the added atezolizumab from this perspective. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
Optimally, the benefitting subgroup could be better defined than by PD-L1 ≥ 1%. However, no better 
biomarkers exist at the present time and this is acknowledged. In addition, chosen cut-off point has been 
adequately justified.  
Patients with active brain metastases at baseline were excluded from the pivotal study while CNS 
metastases are frequent in this patient population.  This is adequately reflected in the SmPC section 4.4. 
Furthermore, based on the exploratory subgroup analyses performed in patients with PD-L1 expression ≥ 
1% and asymptomatic brain metastases at baseline, there was no evidence of efficacy in these patients, 
although the number of patients treated was small. This has been reflected in the SmPC, section 5.1. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
Almost every patient experienced at least 1 AE and the majority were assessed to be treatment-related. 
Grade 3-4 treatment-related events occurred in 39.6% in the atezolizumab arm compared to 15.9% of 
patients in the atezolizumab monotherapy pool and the majority were known chemotherapy-related 
ADRs. Serious adverse events were observed in more patients in the atezolizumab arm (22.8%), 
however, only 12.4% of these were treatment-related.  
In the relevant arm (atezo+nP), the most frequent AEs were chemotherapy-related, such as alopecia, 
fatigue, nausea, diarrhoea, anaemia, constipation, and neutropenia. It is noted that more patients in the 
atezolizumab arm compared with placebo had nausea (46% vs 38%), cough (25% vs 19%), neutropenia 
(20.8% vs 15.3%) and peripheral sensory neuropathy (15.9% vs 11.9%). Notably more patients had 
hypothyroidism (13.7% vs 3.4%). 
Clinically relevant grade 3-4 events were rare (~5% of patients per PT) and consisted of peripheral 
neuropathy (5.5%), pneumonia (2.2%), fatigue (4.0%), and diarrhoea (1.3%) and there were no 
clinically meaningful difference between the treatment arms.  
The most common adverse events of special interest (AESIs) were immune-related events, such as rash 
(34.1%), hypothyroidism (17.3%), lab-abnormal hepatitis (13.7%), and hyperthyroidism (4.4%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/425313/2019  
Page 116/122 
 
 
 
The most common SAEs in the atezolizumab arm were pneumonia (2.2%), urinary tract infection (1.1%), 
pyrexia (1.1%), and dyspnea (1.1%). The number of pneumonias was significantly increased in the 
atezolizumab arm compared with placebo.  
Overall, more deaths occurred in the placebo arm and the majority of patients died from progressive 
disease. However, more patients died due to an AE in the atezolizumab arm (1.3% vs 0.7%).  
The overall safety profile was similar between the ADA-positive and ADA-negative patients. 
AEs leading to discontinuation of placebo/atezolizumab occurred in more patients in the atezolizumab 
arm (6.4% vs 1.4%). Most common AEs leading to withdrawal was neuropathy (6 vs 1 patients), which 
indicates that atezolizumab more frequently induces severe neuropathy than nab-paclitaxel alone. AEs 
leading to discontinuation of nab-paclitaxel also occurred more frequently in the atezolizumab arm 
(15.9% vs. 8.2%). Most common AEs were neuropathy, general disorders, GI toxicity, and infections. The 
rate of discontinuations in monotherapy population were similar (7.1%) which is reassuring. 
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The vast majority of patients were of PS 0-1 in the pivotal study (see SmPC section 5.1), which is not 
reflective of the patient population in the real life setting, and in the daily clinic patients of PS 2 will also 
be treated and may have increased susceptibility to treatment toxicity, as observed in the patients of  >65 
years of age. This is adequately reflected in sections 4.4 and 5.1 of the SmPC.  
Data for patients ≥75 years of age are too limited to draw conclusions on this population (see section 4.8 
of the SmPC).

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
The target population of mTNBC have a high unmet medical need as this is an aggressive life-threatening 
disease, and the currently available treatment options result in a median PFS of ~6 months and a median 
OS of ~ 16 months. The mean age of patients with mTNBC was in ~55 years in the study and more than 
2/3 of the patients were in the age group of 41-64 years of age, so this is a relatively young patient 
population with a very poor prognosis. This is also reflected by the control arm of the study, where the 
observed mature median PFS is 5.3 months for the targeted PD-L1 ≥ 1% population.  
Therefore, an improvement in PFS of 2.2 months (from 5.3 to 7.5 months) is relevant in the proposed 
population. It may be discussed, if the difference in terms of PFS is limited per se, but in the context of 
improved OS, ORR, and DOR, the PFS result is considered clinically relevant. It should be acknowledged 
that a PFS gain with immune therapy may not be large, but often results in a considerable OS benefit for 
the responding patients, maybe even long term.

The numerical OS gain of 7 months (median) is considered clinically relevant for this patient population, 
who have not seen any major advances of therapy in decades, although this result could not be formally 
statistically tested.  
Efficacy data by PD-L1 expression status demonstrated that subjects with PD-L1 negative tumours (IC0) 
do not derive clinical benefit from the addition of atezolizumab to nab-paclitaxel (PFS HR 0.95; OS HR 
1.04). PD-L1 status was prospectively centrally tested, implemented as stratification factor, and efficacy 
evaluation in the PD-L1 positive population (IC≥1) was pre-specified. Thus, limiting the indication to 
subjects with PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% is endorsed. 
The secondary endpoint of ORR improved by 16% with atezolizumab, which is considered to translate into 
improved symptom relief and increased clinical benefit for the patients. It is considered important that 
10% of the patients had a complete response, which is almost unseen with standard of care 
(chemotherapy as monotherapy). There were no detrimental effects on the reported quality of life 
measures (Time to deterioration in global health status/HRQoL), which is reassuring. 
The safety profile of the combination of atezolizumab and nab-paclitaxel is as could be expected and 
consists ofa combination of chemotherapy and immune-related adverse drug reactions. There were no 
new safety signals. Most of the toxicities were clinically manageable and the discontinuation rate is 
considered acceptable. In conclusion, the safety profile is considered overall acceptable in this palliative 
treatment setting. Adequate measures are in place to manage the risks associated with atezolizumab in 
the RMP and relevant recommendations are included in the SmPC. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
Overall, the patients diagnosed with mTNBC have a very poor prognosis and there have not been any 
major advances in decades, hence, the standard of care is still chemotherapy as monotherapy. In 
addition, the safety profile of the combination therapy is considered overall acceptable in this palliative 
treatment setting. Therefore, the benefit-risk balance is considered favourable for the PD-L1 ≥ 1% 
population because updated mature data show clinically relevant differences in PFS and OS. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of atezolizumab in combination with nab-paclitaxel for the treatment of adult patients 
with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumours 
have PD-L1 expression ≥ 1% and who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease is 
considered positive.    
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Tecentriq 840 mg concentrate for solution for infusion is favourable in the 
following indication: 
“Tecentriq in combination with nab-paclitaxel is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
unresectable locally advanced or metastatic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) whose tumours have 
PD-L1 expression ≥1% and who have not received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease.” 
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Tecentriq subject to 
the following conditions:

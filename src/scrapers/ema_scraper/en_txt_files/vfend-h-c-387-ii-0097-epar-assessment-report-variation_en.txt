Information on Paediatric requirements 
Pursuant to Article 22 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 as amended, Pfizer Limited submitted to the 
European Medicines Agency on 22 February 2013 an application for modification of the agreed paediatric 
investigation plan with a deferral and a waiver as set out in the European Medicines Agency’s decision 
P/42/2010 issued on 31 March 2010, the decision P/198/2010 issued on 27 October 2010, the decision 
P/74/2011 issued on 5 April 2011 and the decision P/0112/2012 issued on 22 June 2012. 
EMA adopted the decision (P/0151/2013) on 05-07-2013 that changes to the agreed paediatric 
investigation plan (EMEA-000191-PIP01-08-M05), for voriconazole (Vfend), including changes to the 
waiver, are accepted in line with the opinion (17 May 2013) of the Paediatric Committee of the EMA  
The waiver applies to: 
• 
• 
• 
the paediatric population from birth to less than 24 months of age on the grounds that the specific 
medicinal product is likely to be unsafe  
the paediatric population from 2 years to less than 18 years on the grounds that the specific 
medicinal product does not represent a significant therapeutic benefit as the needs are already 
covered. 
for the conditions: treatment of invasive aspergillosis; treatment of candidaemia in non-neutropenic 
patients; treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei); 
treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp. 
The Paediatric Investigation Plan (PIP) investigates the targeted indication Prophylaxis in paediatric (and 
in adults) patients who are at high risk of developing invasive fungal infections, such as haematopoietic 
stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients. 
The agreed paediatric investigation plan entails:  
•  Open-label, multiple intravenous dose, multi-centre study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety 
and tolerability of voriconazole in children aged 2 to less than 12 years who required treatment for 
the prevention of systemic fungal infection (A1501007) 
•  Open-label, multi-centre study to investigate the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability of 
increasing intravenous doses and following a switch to oral voriconazole in immunocompromised 
subjects aged 2 to < 12 years who required treatment for the prevention of systemic fungal infection 
(A1501037) 
•  Open-label, intravenous to oral switch, multiple dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety 
and tolerability of voriconazole in immunocompromised adolescents aged 12 to <17 years who are at 
high risk for systemic fungal infection (A1501081) 
•  Open-label, intravenous to oral switch, multiple dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety 
and tolerability of voriconazole in immunocompromised children aged 2 to <12 years who are at high 
risk for systemic fungal infection (A1501088)  
• 
a population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Voriconazole in Children, Adolescents and Adults based on

• 
an extrapolation of the efficacy and safety data from the adults studies A1501038 and A1501073, to 
the subset of patients 24 months to less than 18 years of age. 
Pursuant to Article 8 of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006, the application included an EMA Decision(s) 
P/0151/2013 on the agreement of a paediatric investigation plan (PIP).  
The PIP P/0151/2013 was completed. 
The PDCO issued an opinion on compliance for the PIP P/0151/2013. 
2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
Voriconazole (Vfend) is a broad-spectrum, triazole antifungal agent. Its mode of action is inhibition of 
fungal cytochrome P450 (CYP)-mediated 14α-sterol demethylation, an essential step in ergosterol 
biosynthesis. Voriconazole is active against a wide range of yeasts and filamentous fungi, including 
Candida, Aspergillus, Fusarium, and Scedosporium species. It has proven efficacy in the treatment of 
both invasive aspergillosis and invasive candidiasis. Voriconazole, which is available in a oral formulation 
as well as an IV formulation. 
Marketing approval has been granted in over 90 countries, including the United States, European Union, 
and Australia. MA in Europe was obtained in 2002. 
In Europe, voriconazole has the following indications: 
In adults and children aged 2 years and above in  
- 
- 
- 
- 
the treatment of invasive aspergillosis;  
treatment of candidemia in non-neutropenic patients;  
treatment of fluconazole-resistant serious invasive Candida infections (including C. krusei); 
treatment of serious fungal infections caused by Scedosporium spp. and Fusarium spp. 
The present application is intended to extend the Vfend (voriconazole) indications for a use in prophylaxis 
as follows: 
Prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high risk HSCT recipients including: 
- 
- 
 Patients with AML, 
 Patients who have received myeloablative conditioning regimens 
This application presents the safety and efficacy data from 2 prospective clinical studies and a review of 
published literature supporting the use of voriconazole for prophylaxis in high-risk patients. The studies 
are A1501073 (comparative study of voriconazole versus itraconazole as primary prophylaxis in subjects 
with allogenic HSCT) and A1501038 (non-comparative study using voriconazole as secondary prophylaxis 
in similar patients). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 4/42 
  
  
 
For this application, the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) Guideline on the clinical 
evaluation of antifungal agents for the treatment and prophylaxis of invasive fungal disease 
(CHMP/EWP/1343/01 Rev. 1) is applicable. 
On 17 May 2005 the MAH requested scientific advice from CHMP (EMEA/CHMP/SAWP/293597/2005) for 
Vfend concerning the acceptability of the proposed clinical study A1501073 to support the indication for 
primary prophylaxis of haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients at risk of fungal infection. 
The main recommendations of CHMP were: 
• 
• 
The proposed composite primary endpoint is not considered adequate for the assessment of 
antifungal prophylactic efficacy, as it contains variables not only relating to efficacy but also to 
safety and tolerability.  The CHMP strongly recommends defining a relatively pure primary 
endpoint consisting of assessment of proven or probable breakthrough infections only. The 
investigation of overall survival should preferably be included as a key secondary endpoint. 
The use of itraconazole as a comparator in the adult study population is acceptable.   
•  When conducting the study in an unblinded design it will be essential to follow the provisions to 
limit possible bias. If compliance and drop-outs are not an issue, blinding might be less important 
to enable an unbiased assessment. However, if drop-outs will be counted as failures, the opinion 
of the treating physicians about the efficacy and/or safety and/or tolerability of the investigational 
drugs can influence the outcome. This is another argument against including the adherence to 
study drug into the primary endpoint components.  
• 
• 
The Sponsor’s study on secondary prophylaxis  (A1501038) as well as the primary prophylaxis 
study conducted by the Blood and Bone Marrow Transplant Group in the USA (the Wingard/Walsh 
study) may be supportive for the overall benefit/risk assessment of voriconazole, but they cannot 
serve for demonstration of efficacy for the primary prophylaxis indication targeted in the present 
development programme. 
In order to enable a meaningful evaluation of efficacy in the prevention of moulds infections e.g. 
due to Aspergillus species, it will be necessary to have an adequate background incidence of 
infections with those fungi suspected as origin of infections. This should be considered in the 
selection of participating centres and the recruitment of patients. 
•  Another  crucial  element  in  the  evaluation  of  these  studies  will  be  the  initiation  of  antifungal 
therapy. It would be essential to try to specify the conditions for initiation of empirical antifungal 
treatment  in  the  protocol  as  much  as  possible,  with  the  intention  to  harmonise  these  criteria 
amongst the different participating centres. 
In November 2012 the MAH held a pre-submission meeting with the Rapporteur.  The intention of the 
meeting was to discuss MAH’s proposals pertaining to the future submission for an indication of 
prophylaxis for voriconazole in the HSCT population. During this meeting the Rapporteur indicated that 
their main concern related to patient selection. It was stated that the inclusion criteria were too broad. 
The Rapporteur recommended that the MAH should clearly define a sub-population from the prospective 
clinical trials where benefit has clearly been demonstrated in terms of efficacy and the benefit/risk is 
favourable.  However the Rapporteur acknowledged the option to retain the proposed indication if the 
benefit/risk is justified.

2.2.  Non-clinical aspects 
No new clinical data have been submitted in this application, which was considered acceptable. 
During the assessment procedure, in compliance with the “Guideline on the Environmental Risk 
Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use” (EMEA/CHMP/ SWP/4447/00, June 2006), an updated 
Environmental Risk Assessment (ERA) has been provided as requested.  It concluded that voriconazole 
does not meet the criteria for classification as a Persistence, Bioaccumulation and Toxicity (PBT) 
compound. Based on the Phase II Tier A analysis, no environmentally related labels are required for 
voriconazole. Disposal of unused medicines should follow local guidelines and requirements. 
2.3.  Clinical aspects  
2.3.1.  Introduction 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant.  
Following concerns raised by the Hospital Trust for Site 1028, audits of the site by the MAH identifying 
concerns regarding investigator oversight and conduct, and restrictions on the investigator carrying out 
clinical research by the General Medical Council in the United Kingdom, subjects from this site were 
excluded from the analyses of all efficacy endpoints. All subjects were included in the safety analyses. 
The relevant Ethics Committee and Regulatory Authority were informed. This resulted in 24 subjects (10 
in the voriconazole treatment group and 14 in the itraconazole treatment group) being excluded from the 
efficacy analyses. The MAH confirmed that the SAEs from this site were included in the analyses. 
Importantly, the exclusion of subjects from the site 1028 did not impact the overall conclusions of the 
study.

2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetic/Pharmacodynamics Modelling 
Previously, a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analysis of patient data from 6 clinical trials (N = 280) 
could not detect a positive association between mean, maximum or minimum plasma voriconazole 
concentration and efficacy. However, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic analyses of the data from 10 
clinical trials (N = 1121) identified positive associations between plasma voriconazole concentrations and 
rate of both liver function test abnormalities and visual disturbances. It suggested that subjects with 
higher voriconazole exposure may have an increased risk of hepatic adverse events or visual 
disturbances. 
Population pharmacokinetic analysis have been obtained using data from study A1501073, i.e. in subjects 
with allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplants (HSCT) receiving primary prophylaxis treatment for 
invasive fungal infections (IFI) 
No population pharmacokinetic analysis using NONMEM was carried out. This can be questioned, as 
models have already been obtained previously with a lot of data. It is acknowledged that variability may 
be a problem for the current data set, however this could have been taken into account in making 
conclusions from the analysis. 
The observed range in voriconazole concentrations is rather large, but expected, as concentrations 
represent those obtained over the whole day, including trough and maximum values.   
Trough concentrations ranged from 0 –  4.53 µg/ml (n=34). One subject had a concentration below the 
limit of quantitation (10 ng/ml), 22 subjects had a trough concentration ≥  0.5 µg/ml and 13 subjects ≥  1 
µg/ml. Overall, 8 subjects had a plasma concentration below the limit of quantitation. 
The observed concentrations were in line with those observed in study A1501092, in which 34 healthy 
volunteers received oral voriconazole 200 mg b.i.d. In these subjects a median trough concentration was 
observed of 0.46 µg/ml (range 0.14 – 4.27 µg/ml) and a Cmax of 2.45 µg/ml (range 1.23 – 6.84 µg/ml). 
Also the voriconazole plasma concentrations observed in adolescents (11 -17 years) were in line with 
previous obtained data. It is expected that the pharmacokinetics observed during prophylaxis is 
comparable to that documented for treatment for invasive fungal infections, as the same dose 
recommendation is applied and in addition, the study population can be considered comparable.   
3 subjects (see below) had a breakthrough of IFI: 
• 
• 
• 
subject 10151001, male, 44 years, dose 200 mg oral: pre-dose concentration 1120 ng/ml 
subject 10311001, male, 20 years, dose 200 mg oral: 11.5 h concentration 35 ng/ml 
subject 10431008, male, 64 years, dose 200 mg oral: 3.25 h concentration 2630 ng/ml  
The observed concentrations for subject 10311001 can be considered low, but for the other two subjects 
the pre-dose and the concentration around Cmax are not raising a concern. These limited data do not 
directly indicate a concern with regard to exposure and breakthrough of IFI.

2.4.  Clinical Efficacy aspects 
Dose response study 
No dose response study was conducted. The MAH proposes to use the therapeutic dose in a prophylactic 
regimen. This is considered acceptable. Retrospective evidence demonstrates that lower serum 
concentrations of voriconazole in the current dosing schedule are associated to higher levels of 
therapeutic failure, it can be accepted that the therapeutic dose was chosen also for use as a prophylactic 
agent and that a lower dose, which could have resulted in low or lack of preventive activity, was not 
proposed. 
Main Study 
Study A1501073 - A prospective, open-label, comparative, multicentre study of voriconazole compared 
with itraconazole (Sporanox®) for the primary prophylaxis of IFI in subjects > 12 years of age requiring 
allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). Subjects received study drug immediately following 
HSCT and continued for a minimum of 100 days to a maximum of 180 days. All subjects were followed 
for breakthrough IFI and survival for 180 days irrespective of prior discontinuation for any reason. 
The following tables summarises the efficacy results from the main study:

IV therapy with voriconazole for 2 days 
before switching to oral therapy on Day 2. 
 The prophylactic regimen began on the day 
of initiation of HSCT (Day 0), at least 48 
hours after completion of conditioning 
chemotherapy. For all subjects, voriconazole 
was administered for a minimum of 100 days 
to a maximum of 180 days. All subjects were 
followed for 180 days, irrespective of prior 
discontinuation for any reason. 
Study drug prophylaxis could have been 
continued beyond Day 100, until cessation of 
immunosuppression or Graft versus Host 
Disease (GvHD) up to 180 days after 
transplantation.

Oral solution (200 mg, orally, twice daily 
[BID], 1 hour before food) was the primary 
formulation. Subjects were permitted to take 
itraconazole capsules (dosed at 200 mg BID, 
immediately after food) for short courses 
(less than 5 days suggested) where subjects 
were unable or unwilling to continue on the 
oral solution.

2.4.1.  Methods 
Study participants 
Patients aged over 12 years requiring allogeneic HSCT were included. Patients with possible, probable or 
proven IFI at study entry or at any time within 6 months prior to study entry, defined according to the 
“consensus criteria”, and patients who received any systemically active antifungal agent within the 7 days 
prior to study entry were to be excluded. 
Patients with AML and allogenic HSCT are most susceptible to develop IFI due to prolonged periods of 
neutropenia and therefore this patient groups were specifically been targeted in Study A1501073. 
Treatments 
Subjects were randomised to receive either voriconazole (see table below) or itraconazole (200 mg BID) 
which was administered for a minimum of 100 days to a maximum of 180 days.

Itraconazole as comparator is considered acceptable, however it is not clear why itraconazole capsules 
were to be administered, since oral solution is the recommended formulation with better bioavailability. 
(Please refer to IDSA guidelines 2009 on Aspergillosis: “Absorption from the capsular formulation, which 
is enhanced by low gastric pH and dietary lipids, may be erratic or negligible in the fasting state, 
particularly in granulocytopenic patients with cancer and in patients with hypochlorhydria, and its use in 
seriously ill patients with life-threatening infection is not recommended”). Also it is not clear why 14 days 
as a maximum was introduced in the itraconazole arm. The only justification provided is that capsules 
were administered to subjects who were unable or unwilling to continue on the oral solution. To evaluate 
the potential impact, the MAH should provide data on the number of patients in the itraconazole arm that 
were on capsules both < 14 days and > 14 days  in relation to breakthrough infection and use of 
additional antifungals, because decreased activity can be anticipated that would result in more frequent 
use of additional antifungal agents or lower protection rates.

Objectives 
The primary objective was to demonstrate non-inferiority of voriconazole over itraconazole regarding the 
“Success” of antifungal prophylaxis at 180 days post-transplant. Success was measured using a 
composite endpoint of: survival to Day 180 with no breakthrough IFI and no discontinuation of study drug 
for >14 days in total during the 100-day prophylaxis. Non-inferiority was inferred if the lower limit of the 
2-sided 95% CI for the difference between the voriconazole and itraconazole treatment groups in the 
proportion of subjects classified as a success at Day 180 post-transplant was above –10%. 
Secondary objectives included to determine success of antifungal prophylaxis (as defined above), but at 
100 days post-transplant and comparisons of:  
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
- 
-

Time to breakthrough IFI.  
Rates of occurrence of breakthrough IFI. 
Survival to 180 days post-transplant. 
Safety and tolerability of the 2 study treatments. 
Time to discontinuation of study treatment. 
Durations of study drug treatment (solid or liquid oral formulations and IV formulation) and rates 
of empirical therapy. 
Use of other systemic antifungal agents as empirical or therapeutic treatment. 
Reasons for discontinuation of study treatment. 
Survival 1 year after transplant (which will be reported separately). 
Subject-assessed tolerability of therapy. 
Use of healthcare resources. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary objective is to compare the success of antifungal prophylaxis with voriconazole versus 
itraconazole at 180 days post-transplant (Visit 9). Thus, the primary endpoint is the success of antifungal 
prophylaxis at Visit 9. 
To be a success at Visit 9, the subject must meet all three of the following conditions: 
• 
• 
• 
be alive at Visit 9, 
have no breakthrough proven or probable invasive fungal infection by Visit 9, 
be a success at 100 days post-transplant (Visit 7). 
Note that to be a success at Visit 7 (which itself is a key secondary endpoint), a subject must meet all 
three of the following conditions: 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 12/42 
  
  
• 
• 
be alive at Visit 7, 
have no breakthrough proven or probable invasive fungal infection by Visit 7, 
•  meet both of the following conditions regarding the amount of study medication taken in the 
scheduled 100 days of prophylaxis (ie, by Visit 7): 
- 
have no discontinuation of study drug for more than 14 days by Visit 7 for any reason 
(this includes empiric therapy, alternative prophylaxis and no prophylaxis), 
- 
for subjects randomised to itraconazole, no more than 14 days of itraconazole capsules 
must be taken by Visit 7. 
As already indicated in the CHMP advice from 2005, the composite primary endpoint is not considered 
adequate for the assessment of antifungal prophylactic efficacy, as it contains variables not only relating 
to efficacy but also to safety and tolerability. As this endpoint is expected to be mainly driven by 
tolerability (discontinuations) rather than efficacy, it is deemed unsuitable to determine the efficacy of 
voriconazole in the indication of prophylaxis in HSCT patients.  The CHMP strongly recommended defining 
a relatively pure primary endpoint consisting of assessment of proven or probable breakthrough infections 
only.  
Relevant endpoints for assessing efficacy have been taken along secondary endpoints, namely “Rates of 
breakthrough IFI” and survival to 180 days post-transplant. Moreover, survival 1 year after transplant is 
also a relevant indicator. However, no non-inferiority analyses were planned for these endpoints.  
Sample size 
Sample size calculations in study A1501073 were based on the primary efficacy parameter of success for 
180 days after allogeneic HSCT. 
Assuming a true success rate of 50% in the voriconazole treatment group and 45% in the itraconazole 
treatment group, a sample size of 232 subjects per group has 90% power to demonstrate non-inferiority 
of voriconazole to itraconazole using a pre-specified non-inferiority margin of -10%.  
Randomisation 
Subjects were stratified at the time of randomization by the following factors: 
•  Conditioning regimen: myeloablative or non-myeloablative. 
•  Relatedness of donor: matched related or mismatched/unrelated. 
Randomization was also blocked by centre.

Blinding (masking) 
The study was not blinded, which could possibly have introduced bias. Clarifications are needed from the 
MAH to determine how prone to bias the study was. The MAH should confirm whether randomization of 
patients was done centrally, but also whether a blinded endpoint assessment has been assured. 
Statistical methods 
Non-inferiority was inferred if the lower limit of the 2-sided 95% CI for the difference between the 
voriconazole and itraconazole treatment groups in the proportion of subjects classified as a success at 
Day 180 post transplant was above –10%. The margin was not justified.  
Post hoc analysis in subgroups  
During the November 2012 Pre-Submission Meeting, the Rapporteur recommended that a subpopulation 
from the prospective clinical trials should be defined where benefit can clearly be demonstrated in terms 
of non-inferiority to break-through infections.  
For the post-hoc analysis on subpopulations, the MAH has adopted the same methodology as was used 
for the MITT analysis for each endpoint presented in the Summary of Clinical Efficacy. For any binary 
endpoint, all proportions are expressed as percentages and all comparisons of difference in proportions 
between treatments are presented in terms of voriconazole – itraconazole. Unless specified otherwise, 
approximate two-sided confidence intervals for the difference in proportions are based on the normal 
approximation to the binomial distribution.  
The endpoint of break-through IFI at Day 180 (Day 100) was assessed by calculating the proportion of 
IFI cases reported in each treatment arm. Voriconazole would therefore, be declared non-inferior to 
itraconazole if the upper limit of the 95% CI for the difference in IFI rates (voriconazole – itraconazole) is 
less than 5%.  
The MAH has based their non-inferiority margin of 5% on an estimated minimum benefit of itraconazole 
over placebo of 8.2%. In both populations (AML and myeloablative regimens) a putative placebo IFI rate 
was established of respectively 15% and 20%. The placebo rate appeared relatively constant in different 
studies (~15%-20%) yet there is a high, unexplained, heterogeneity in treatment response amongst the 
different studies. The variation in treatment response between studies cannot be explained by the 
variables considered.  For example, the IFI rate in the fluconazole varies from 2.8% to 25.4% in studies 
in allogeneic HSCT patients with myeloablative conditioning regimens.  For itraconazole the IFI rate 
varied between 1.6% and 12.6% in these patients. The difference between treatment and placebo, where 
present, varies accordingly. Due to this high heterogeneity it is questionable whether pooling as done by 
the MAH is appropriate to determine the non-inferiority margin.

Conduct of the study 
The most frequently reported protocol violations were SAEs reported outside of the protocol-specified 
reporting window (21 subjects) and use of antifungal therapy within 7 days of study start (9 subjects). 
This information is not in line with the information provided in appendix B12, where it is stated that anti-
fungal therapy given in the 7 days prior to study entry has been reported for 74 subjects. After reanalysis 
Assessment report

the MAH corrected the figures in appendix B12 and mentions 71 subjects with prior antifungal therapy. 
Further, in Appendix B12 it is stated that one or more Deviations in study procedures/lab tests were 
noted in 291 patients.  
Baseline data 
The mean age was approximately 43 years for both treatment groups, with ages ranging from 11 to 70 
years. In total, 20 patients aged between 11 and 18 yrs were included, 9 in the voriconazole arm and 11 
in the itraconazole arm.  
The requested extension of indication applies to children > 2yrs, and the MAH proposes to extrapolate the 
safety and efficacy from adults to the paediatric population. This could be accepted however special 
vigilance is needed with regards to the safety of long-term use of voriconazole in children.  
Primary diagnoses & durations for the included patients are presented in the following table:

Numbers analysed 
The MITT population consisted of all randomized subjects who received at least 1 dose of randomized 
study drug and had undergone allogeneic HSCT and included 465 subjects: 224 in the voriconazole group 
and 241 in the itraconazole group. In the voriconazole group, 39 subjects (17.4%) were excluded from 
the PP population. In the itraconazole group, 42 subjects (17.4%) were excluded from the PP population. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Regarding the primary outcome, the difference in success (responder rates adjusted for the 
randomization strata) was 16.4% in favor of voriconazole (95% CI 7.7% -  25.1%). As such non-
inferiority was inferred as was superiority of voriconazole over itraconazole. Results for the PP population 
were similar. As this endpoint is likely to be largely driven by discontinuations and thus tolerance, it is not 
considered a good measure for efficacy. The more relevant measures are rates of IFI and survival as also 
discussed above. 
For the rate of IFI, only the MITT analyses were presented in the clinical study report.  A total of 7 
subjects developed a breakthrough proven or probable IFI from the start of prophylaxis until Day 180: 3 
subjects (1.3%) in the voriconazole group and 4 subjects (1.7%) in the itraconazole group. In addition, 
one subject with a probably IFI was reported for the itraconazole arm, which was not initially captured by 
the study database. An additional analysis of per protocol population was subbmitted upon request. This 
analysis confirmed the results of the MITT analysis.

The incidence of IFI in both treatment arms is low, also in comparison to what is expected from previous 
studies in this indication. Additional analysis excluded the selection of patients as causative factor for the 
low rates of IFI, nor a short duration of neutropenia. An additional overview of antifungal treatment 
showed that prior to start of treatment 65/224 (29.0%) in voriconazole treated subjects and 62/241 
(25.7%) in itraconazole treated subjects used antifungal therapy, from whom 34/65 and 37/62 within 
seven days of enrolment. The use of additional antifungal therapy was significantly higher in the 
itraconazole group compared to the voriconazole group (41.9% [101/241] vs. 29.9% [67/224], 
respectively). The majority of additional antifungal therapy was administered during the active treatment 
(i.e., prophylaxis) period (64.2% [43/67] for voriconazole; 60.4% [61/101] for itraconazole). This 
additional antifungal therapy may contribute to the final outcome to some extent. However other studies 
allowed preemptive co-treatment in substantial proportions also. Based on the additional analysis it can 
be concluded that in this risk population both itraconazole and voriconazole are efficacious antifungal 
agents in the prevention of IFI. 
Overall, 84 subjects (18.1%) died at or before day 180: 40 subjects (17.9%) in the voriconazole group 
and 44 subjects (18.3%) in the itraconazole group. The survival up to day 180 appears similar in both 
treatment arms, with no significant difference in the death rate at any time point measured. The point 
estimate on the difference lies around zero. the 1-year survival rate was higher for subjects treated with 
voriconazole (74.1%) compared with itraconazole (68.9%). This difference (5.2%) is not statistically 
significant (95% CI for the difference in crude survival, voriconazole – itraconazole: [-3.0 %, 13.4%]; p-
value = 0.2109).  
The median number of days from the start of prophylaxis until discontinuation of study treatment was 
higher for voriconazole (98.0) compared with itraconazole (70.0). Additional analysis showed that the 
combination of intolerance and AE resulted in discontinuation in 66.1% and 68.7% in the voriconazole 
and itraconazole arm respectively. The proportion of subjects experiencing intolerance among those 
subjects was highest in the itraconazole arm: 31.4% vs. 12.1% in the voriconazole arm of the total 
population. On the contrary, the proportion of subjects experiencing AEs among those subjects was 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 18/42 
  
  
 
 
highest in the voriconazole arm: 54% vs. 37% in the itraconazole arm of the total population. This 
information is to be included in the SmPC. 
With regard to the satisfaction as measured by the TSQM score, this TSQM score was a composite 
endpoint of perceived Effectiveness, Side Effects and Convenience: most differences were in differently 
scored Convenience appreciation (78.56 vs. 59.01) and relatively smaller differences in Side Effects Score 
(92.35 vs. 81.53). This implies that the perception of patients on tolerability of voriconazole was not as 
favourable. However this conclusion is based on 48/244 (20%) patients post visit 4. Because of these 
flaws in interpretable numbers used for measurement of satisfaction, any conclusions that these 
satisfaction score support the conclusion of a lower tolerability of itraconazole in the study cannot be 
made.  
Ancillary analyses 
Following discussions with the rapporteur, the MAH conducted post-hoc analyses to demonstrate non-
inferiority of voriconazole compared to itraconazole in preventing IFI in two subpopulations considered to 
be at high risk of IFI: patients with AML and patients with myeloablative conditioning regimens. The MAH 
judged these two populations to be at high risk of IFI, therefore justifying the use of voriconazole for the 
prevention of IFI. Analyses in these subgroups largely mirrored the primary analysis for the whole study 
population, however the primary objective was to establish non-inferiority of voriconazole over 
itraconazole regarding the incidence rates of IFI. 
Of the total 465 subjects in Study A1501073, 44.5% had underlying AML. A total of 3 AML subjects, 1 
subject (1.0%) in the voriconazole group and 2 subjects (1.8%) in the itraconazole group, developed a 
proven or probable IFI during the study period (from the start of prophylaxis until Day 180), and 1 in 
each group during the first 100 days. At Day 180, this represented a difference of -0.8% (95% CI -4.0%, 
2.4%). This difference was not statistically significant, and non-inferiority was demonstrated since the 
upper limit for the difference is <5%.  
There was a slight but not significant difference in crude death rates between voriconazole and 
itraconazole. For voriconazole at Day 180, there were 16 deaths (crude death rate 16.3%) and for 
itraconazole there were 22 deaths (crude death rate 20.2%). The difference between the 2 treatments 
(voriconazole – itraconazole) was -3.9% (95% CI: -14.4%, 6.7%). 
A total of 268 subjects with myeloablative conditioning (125 in the voriconazole treatment group and 143 
in the itraconazole treatment group) were included in the MITT analysis of Study A1501073.  A total of 5 
subjects receiving myeloablative conditioning, 2 subjects (1.6%) in the voriconazole group and 3 subjects 
(2.1%) in the itraconazole group, developed a proven or probable IFI during the study period (from the 
start of prophylaxis until Day 180). At Day 180, this represented a difference of -0.5% (95% CI -3.7%, 
2.7%). 
Considering the expected placebo response of 15-20%, we can consider that voriconazole has efficacy in 
preventing IFI. This is also a rational extrapolation of the established efficacy of voriconazole in the 
treatment of invasive aspergillosis (Herbrecht, NEJM, 2002).  
The MAH has defined these two subpopulations in which they consider the risk of IFI sufficiently large to 
justify prolonged use of voriconazole without immediate, evident, benefit to the patient. Patients with 
AML or those who have received myeloablative conditioning regimens were identified as being at high risk 
for the development of IFI as they are likely to have prolonged periods of neutropenia. However, rates of 
IFI in these subgroups were similar to the overall study population, and lower than what would be 
expected in a population at high risk: in the itraconazole arm a rate of 10-15% would be expected. This

questions whether the selected subgroups are indeed at high risk of IFI or whether the use of alternative, 
additional, antifungal agents could have resulted in low IFI incidences compromising the overall 
sensitivity of the study to demonstrate efficacy. Possibly frequent administration of additional antifungal 
therapy was used to obtain the observed very low IFI rates in these subjects.  
An additional overview of antifungal treatment showed that prior to start of treatment 65/224 (29.0%) in 
voriconazole treated subjects and 62/241 (25.7%) in itraconazole treated subjects used antifungal 
therapy, from whom 34/65 and 37/62 within seven days of enrolment. This additional antifungal therapy 
may contribute to the low IFI rate to some extent. However other studies allowed preemptive co-
treatment in substantial proportions also.  
Supportive study 
Study A1501038 – a Phase 3, 12-month prospective, non-comparative, open-label, 
international multicenter study of voriconazole as secondary prophylaxis for IFI in subjects 
undergoing HSCT 
In addition to the pivotal study, the MAH submitted a prospective, open-label, non-comparative, 
multicentre study for the secondary prophylaxis of IFI with voriconazole in subjects > 18 years of age 
with allogeneic HSCT with previous history of IFI. Subjects meeting inclusion and exclusion criteria 
started prophylaxis treatment at least 48 hours after the end of chemotherapy and were continued on 
study drug for a minimum of 100 days post-transplant (to a maximum of 150 days). 
Of the 45 patients who received voriconazole prophylaxis in this study, a 10.7% IFI rate was 
demonstrated using a complete case analysis (3 occurrences among 28 subjects in the MITT population 
who either developed an IFI by Month 12, or provided an assessment of IFI at the 12-Month Follow Up 
Visit). The proportion of 10.7% is low, as recurrence of IFI has been reported frequently, up to > 30% of 
previous IFI. Therefore a clinical benefit can be assumed, unless the selected population was not at risk. 
However, considering high proportion of patients with AML, almost 70%, and proportion of patients 
experiencing GVHD, almost 60%, the risk of developing recurrence (or reinfection with IFI) would be 
substantial, especially in prevention of recurrence of invasive aspergillosis. 
The results of study A1501038 are considered supportive to the efficacy of voriconazole in preventing IFI, 
however due to the lack of a comparative arm and the study considering secondary prophylaxis rather 
than primary prophylaxis it cannot be considered particularly strong evidence of efficacy in primary 
prophylaxis.  
2.4.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
A single pivotal randomised active controlled open label phase III study was conducted to support the 
newly requested indication of prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in high risk HSCT recipients 
including patients with AML and patients who have received myeloablative conditioning regimens. In 
addition, the MAH submitted an uncontrolled open label study in secondary prophylaxis to support the 
application.  Furthermore, two publications of studies evaluating voriconazole in patients with AML were 
submitted.   
The design of Study A1501073, i.e. the selection of a primary endpoint that is not considered adequate 
for the assessment of antifungal prophylactic efficacy, complicates the assessment of efficacy. The most 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 20/42 
  
  
  
relevant parameters are the rates of IFI in both treatment arms as well as the survival at D180 and after 
1 year. 
The study included a population at high risk of IFI. The duration of neutropenia was provided in only 26% 
of the patients treated with voriconazole. The mean duration of neutropenia (ANC <500 cells/mm3) in 
voriconazole- and itraconazole-treated patients was 31.4 days (range 13-96) and 26.1 days (range 13 to 
59), respectively. This is definitely a contributing factor in the increase of risk of invasive fungal disease 
and constitutes an indication for initiation of prophylaxis. 
The rates of IFI in both treatment arms in this study were lower than what has been reported in previous 
studies. Factors that may explain the reason for low IFI rates are: 
- 
Initiation of prophylaxis at the moment of HSCT and not at the peak of susceptibility during GvHD 
as was done in some other studies. 
-  Additionally use of antifungals before inclusion, since this exclusion criterion of not using 
antifungals in the 7 days before inclusion was not met in 15% of subjects. 
-  No standardized efforts to establish the diagnosis of fungal disease as the study allowed for a 
more empiric approach, which may be related to the time of the study: 2006-2009, when the 
evidence for the use of BAL and galactomannan monitoring was less established. 
- 
Liberal use of antifungals; frequent co-administration of antifungals without proper stopping or 
starting rules which was evident in >30% of subjects. Voriconazole-use occurred in 14% of 
subjects allocated to the itraconazole arm, including 13/244 that used both antifungals from the 
same class concomitantly. 
-  Due to aforementioned unstandardized diagnostics; IFI’s could be potentially missed. 
Furthermore, it was clear that the open label study was not optimal in design and execution to determine 
efficacy and safety of the two compounds. 
The survival up to day 180 appears was similar in both treatment arms, with no significant difference in 
the death rate at any time point measured. The point estimate on the difference lies around zero. the 1-
year survival rate was higher for subjects treated with voriconazole (74.1%) compared with itraconazole 
(68.9%). This difference (5.2%) is not statistically significant (95% CI for the difference in crude survival, 
voriconazole – itraconazole: [-3.0 %, 13.4%]; p-value = 0.2109). 
The MAH conducted post-hoc analyses to demonstrate non-inferiority of voriconazole compared to 
itraconazole in preventing IFI in two subpopulations considered to be at high risk of IFI: patients with 
AML and patients with myeloablative conditioning regimens. These post-hoc analyses did not show any 
difference in incidence of IFI. However here too the rates of IFI were lower than what would be expected. 
Additional analysis showed that although the placebo rate seems to be relatively constant (~15%-20%) 
there is a high heterogeneity in treatment response amongst the different studies. The difference 
between treatment and placebo, where present, varies accordingly. The variation in treatment response 
between studies cannot be explained by the variables considered. Considering the editorial by de Pauw, 
NEJM, 2007, much of the heterogeneity of IFI incidence can be explained by center-specific epidemiology 
of fungal infections, monitoring strategies or pre-emptive treatment strategy. Considering the expected 
placebo response it can be concluded that voriconazole has efficacy in preventing IFI.  
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 21/42 
  
  
Patient satisfaction analysis was only performed in 48/244 (20%) patients in the voriconazole arm after 
visit 4, precluding any conclusion on patient discomfort e.g. related to gastrointestinal AEs of either 
compound. 
PK measurements were collected for exploratory reasons and only in 177 from 234 in subjects receiving 
voriconazole. Dose relations with regards to efficacy and especially safety were already known at the start 
of the study in the setting of treatment of IFI.  
The results of study A1501038 are considered supportive to the efficacy of voriconazole in preventing IFI, 
however due to the lack of a comparative arm and the study considering secondary prophylaxis rather 
than primary prophylaxis it cannot be considered particularly strong evidence of efficacy in primary 
prophylaxis.  
Additional Expert Consultation (Scientific Advisory Group) 
The advice of an Ad-Hoc Expert Group was sought by the CHMP on the following aspects: 
1. The experts were asked if the study population in Study A1501073 was representative of at-risk HSCT 
patient groups requiring antifungal prophylaxis. 
During its presentation, the MAH commented that because patients enrolled in Study A1501073 were 
allogeneic HSCT recipients, and most had documented or presumed neutropenia, they represent a 
population at high risk for IFI. It asserted that this is consistent with at risk populations recommended for 
prophylaxis treatment as described in the literature and ECIL 3 guidelines. 
The expert group considered that the study population in likelihood included patients with differing grade 
of risk.  However, overall, it was agreed that the patient groups represented enough high risk requiring 
antifungal prophylaxis but possibly not all individual patients carried the highest risk.  
2. The experts were asked if  the low incidence of breakthrough IFI could be explained by the selection of 
study population (low risk population) or the use of additional antifungal treatment (up to 41% of 
patients) 
During the expert group presentation and discussion, the MAH asserted that the low IFI breakthrough 
rate reported in Study A1501073 is not related to a low risk patient population enrolled in the study. 
The MAH commented that the likely reasons for the low IFI rates in this study are: 
1. The early initiation (on the day of transplant) of prophylaxis thereby covering both 
the pre- and post- engraftment periods, and 
2. The requirement to use intravenous dosing for at least the first two days of 
prophylaxis ensuring adequate exposure to the drug early in the risk period. 
3. Use of additional antifungals. 
The experts were not entirely re-assured with the MAH’s explanation stating the reasons for the low 
incidence of IFI observed.  However, in considering the study population, no difference between the 
groups was noted in mortality and breakthrough fungal infections and no factor could be identified which 
could significantly impact on study results. 
3. The experts were questioned on to what extent they consider that the safety profile of voriconazole 
with notably the risk of hepatotoxicity and of Squamous Cell Carcinoma is compatible with a prophylactic 
use. 
The MAH recognises the concern regarding the risks of SCC and hepatic toxicity. It re-iterated that  
most of the hepatic adverse events were classified as either mild to moderate in intensity and none 
progressed to liver failure. With regards to the risk to develop SCC, it noted that patients reported in the 
literature are mainly lung/heart transplant recipients who received voriconazole for an extended period 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 22/42 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(median: 284 days).  Also, it was stressed that the mechanism by which voriconazole may cause SCC is 
unclear and definitive evidence of causal relationship is lacking.  To minimise the risk of hepatotoxicity 
and SCC, the MAH proposes both routine and additional risk minimisation activities. 
The experts considered the arguments and concluded that indeed the risk of hepatotoxicity is manageable 
and in itself would not preclude the use of voriconazole in the at risk population.  Likewise, the risk of 
SCC is recognised, but taking account of the fact that prophylaxis will be administered for a relatively 
limited period, again this should not preclude the use of voriconazole.  However, attention is drawn that 
caution should be applied. The pharmacovigilance activities proposed by the MAH were noted. 
4. The experts were asked in which specific subgroups of HSCT patients would voriconazole be 
particularly beneficial in prophylaxis of IFI considering the safety profile. 
The experts agreed that there seems to be no specific subgroup best fit to receive primary voriconazole 
prophylaxis.  Further data in that sense would be required for guideline development /recommendation. 
The group could not identify any specific subgroup which would benefit of prophylaxis, more than any 
other. 
5. The experts were asked if they consider the risk of SCC in immunocompromised patients - that is 
further increased by phototoxicity associated with use of voriconazole – a limitation for use of 
voriconazole as antifungal prophylaxis in specific patient groups, e.g. children? 
The expert group concurred with the MAH that routine and additional measures introduced by the MAH 
are expected to minimize the risk of SCC reported with long term use of voriconazole. The proposed 
revisions of the SmPC clarifying the maximum duration of therapy in prophylactic use (Section 4.2) and 
further warning prescribers of the need to carefully assess the benefit-risk balance of long term exposure 
greater than 180 days (Section 4.4) are expected to further instruct prescribers and minimise this risk.  
The group considered that, bearing in mind the risks, no further advice can be provided beyond the 
appropriate warnings and additional risk minimisation measures proposed by the MAH. 
6. The experts were asked if voriconazole should be administered for a maximum period of time e.g. 100 
days or 180 days. 
The MAH commented that based on the evidence generated from prospective randomised trials, the 
reported risk period for IFI in allogeneic HSCT patients, and the current practice guidance and 
recommendations, the proposed prophylaxis is for a period up to 100 days.  However, certain patients 
with on-going significant immunosuppression or GvHD may continue prophylaxis for up to 180 days if the 
benefit-risk evaluation is favourable.  
The experts concurred with the MAH’s position but it was further expressed that voriconazole prophylaxis 
should be used for the shortest possible duration, based on assessment of clinical and mycological 
criteria.  It was noted that in the SmPC will recommend the prescriber to use voriconazole for the 
shortest period needed. 
7. The experts were questioned on the possibility to define quantitative TDM targets in order to minimise 
the risk of Serious Adverse Events of hepatotoxicity, visual disturbances, phototoxicity. 
The MAH commented that no formal consensus on the voriconazole exposure-response relationship has 
been reached due to the complex clinical setting of fungal infections.  At this time, no definite guidance 
could be provided for the interpretation of plasma concentrations of voriconazole in order to minimise the 
risk of hepatotoxicity, visual disturbances or phototoxicity.  Hepatic AEs can be monitored readily through 
routine laboratory tests. Through clinical evaluation, signs and symptoms of key adverse events can be 
captured early, thus minimising the risk of SAEs. 
The experts accepted that, at present, no data predicting how the use of TDM to reduce risks exist.  In 
the event of hepatotoxicity, the clinician should consider the benefit-risk of further exposure to 
voriconazole. 
The CHMP acknowledged the conclusion of the Scientific Advisory Group and took it into consideration in 
the discussions to reach the overall conclusion and benefit/risk balance.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical efficacy in children 
In total, 20 patients aged between 11 and 18 yrs were included in Study A1501073; 9 in the voriconazole 
arm and 11 in the itraconazole arm.  
 The requested extension of indication applies to children > 2yrs, and the MAH proposes to extrapolate 
the safety and efficacy from adults to the paediatric population.  
With regard to extrapolation of efficacy data from the adult studies (A1501038 and A1501073) to the 
subset of patients 24 months to less than 18 years of age: 
• 
• 
• 
The rationale provided by Applicant is considered comprehensible. 
The conclusion of Applicant that “based on the shared pathophysiology, it is reasonable to expect 
similar efficacy in paediatric patients at voriconazole doses matching the total exposures in adults 
that demonstrated therapeutic efficacy” is endorsed. 
Extrapolation of the efficacy data from the adult studies A1501038 and A1501073, to the subset of 
patients 24 months to less than 18 years of age, is endorsed. 
The currently proposed dosage adjustments in section 4.2 of the SmPC seem only relevant for 
therapeutic use and not for prophylaxis. Therefore in the SmPC under 4.2 prophylaxis it is stated that: 
Dose adjustments in case of lack of efficacy or treatment-related adverse events are not recommended. 
In case of treatment-related adverse events, discontinuation of voriconazole and use of alternative 
antifungal agents must be considered (see sections 4.4 and 4.8). 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
Regardless of the numerous identified and obvious flaws in the submitted study, study A1501073 did 
include high-risk patients and the low rate of IFI in both arms may be explained by early initiation of 
antifungal prophylaxis therapy and liberal use of other antifungals. Based on the available information, 
dose adjustments cannot be advised.  Use of voriconazole in secondary prophylaxis is considered 
acceptable and may be continued until immune status allows discontinuation of prophylaxis. Treatment 
duration should be limited to periods in which patients are considered at high risk of IFI due to safety 
concerns (see below).  Prolongation of prophylaxis beyond day 180 requires a thorough reassessment of 
the benefit risk and consideration on the use of other antifungals by the patient and the treating 
physician. 
2.5.  Clinical Safety aspects 
2.5.1.  Introduction 
Important safety issues associated with the use of voriconazole as a therapeutic agent are visual 
disturbances, hepatotoxicity and photosensitivity including a risk of squamous cell carcinoma.  
At the time of licensing of voriconazole for therapeutic use there were 1214 patients who received 
voriconazole (therapeutic studies presented in the initial submission). Of these 203 (16.7%) had a 
duration of voriconazole therapy of greater than 12 weeks, with 56 patients receiving voriconazole for 
over 6 months. Since licensing it has been found that there could be a direct causal association between 
voriconazole, photo-ageing and squamous cell cancer. This is of particular concern in children, as the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 24/42 
  
  
 
reporting rate of phototoxicity was found to be higher in children than in adults. Secondly it could limit 
long term use of voriconazole.  
Patient exposure 
This submission includes safety data for a total of 534 subjects with HSCT: voriconazole was administered 
to a total of 279 subjects (234 subjects in Study A1501073 and 45 subjects in Study A1501038); 
itraconazole was administered to 255 subjects in Study A1501073. 
The median duration of exposure during prophylaxis in the submitted study is longer than in therapeutic 
studies (97 days vs. 54-73 days dependent on the study), however absolute numbers of patients exposed 
to longer term treatment (>12 weeks) were higher in the therapeutic studies – in which the dose was 
similar.  In total, 120 patients received voriconazole for a minimum of 100 days. 
Adverse events  
The rate of AEs during the study period were similar, but more frequently SAE were reported in the 
voriconazole arm. 
Frequent treatment-related AEs were in the voriconazole arm visual impairment in 6% and hepatobiliary 
disorders including cytolytic hepatitis, hepatotoxicity, liver function abnormal  (17.1 vs. 6.8%), whereas 
gastrointestinal treatment-related AEs were more frequent in the itraconazole group (15.8% in 
voriconazole vs. 41.6% in itraconazole). 
Visual disturbances 
In Study A1501073, AEs in the Eye Disorders SOC were reported for 56 subjects (23.9%) treated with 
voriconazole and for 44 subjects (17.3%) treated with itraconazole. Vision related disorders were more 
frequent in the voriconazole arm: 24 (10.2%) vs 9 (3.5%) subjects. 
Hepatotoxicity 
Clinically significant liver function test (LFT) abnormalities in overall safety population were observed 
more frequently for voriconazole than for itraconazole. These events were considered related to 
treatment in 43 subjects total: 27 subjects (11.5%) in the voriconazole group and 16 subjects (6.3%) in 
the itraconazole group. 
Most of the hepatic adverse events were of mild to moderate intensity and none progressed to liver 
failure. However, hepatic adverse events resulted in permanent discontinuation of study medication for 
50 subjects (21.4%) treated with voriconazole and for 18 subjects (7.1%) treated with itraconazole. 
Since the time to return to normal in these cases is missing, clinicians cannot be provided with data from 
this prophylaxis study in what time frame liver enzymes will return to normal in case of discontinuation. 
Considering the limited clinical experience in only 3/224 subjects and apparent limited effect on hepatic 
AEs because in 1/3 hepatotoxicity was not resolved, the SmPC should not contain recommendations on 
dose reductions in case of AEs when voriconazole is used in prophylactic setting, but should recommend 
discontinuation and use of other antifungal agents. This has to be included in the SmPC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 25/42 
  
  
In addition, the MAH calculated 30-day occurrence of hepatobiliary disorders and showed in general 
similar rates in the two arms. Additional analysis showed that the majority of hepatic events (about two 
thirds) occurred in the first month, but were more frequent in the voriconazole arm. There were a total of 
111/234 (47%) subjects in the voriconazole arm and 76/255 (30%) subjects in the itraconazole arm 
experiencing hepatic events. Of these, 75/111 (68%) subjects in the voriconazole arm and 55/76 (72%) 
subjects in the itraconazole arm experienced their first hepatic events within 30 days after inclusion. This 
information should be included in the SmPC. 
Phototoxicity and Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SCC) 
Photosensitivity has been described in 1% to 2% of patients receiving prolonged treatment with 
voriconazole. For a full discussion, please refer to the section on post marketing data. Three phototoxicity 
adverse events were reported for subjects who received voriconazole : two sunburns, and one 
photosensitivity reaction. There was one report of “lichenoid keratosis” but no reports of skin cancer for 
voriconazole-treated subjects. 
Periostitis 
Non-infectious periostitis with elevated fluoride and alkaline phosphatase levels has been reported in 
transplant patients. No adverse events of periostitis were reported during the study. 
QT prolongation 
Adverse events of QT prolongation were reported for 4 subjects (1.7%) in the voriconazole group and for 
3 subjects (1.2%) in the itraconazole group. 
Resistance 
Resistance was not determined in the two submitted studies. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Study A1501073 
The incidence of serious adverse events in the overall safety population (including those that were not 
treatment emergent) was higher among subjects treated with voriconazole (54.3%) than among those 
treated with itraconazole (46.3%). Similar findings were reported for subjects with AML and subjects 
receiving myeloablative conditioning regimens.  
A total of 18 subjects had hepatobiliary disorders SAEs during this study: 14 subjects (6.0%) in the 
voriconazole group and 4 subjects (1.6%) in the itraconazole group. These SAEs were considered related 
to treatment for 9 subjects (3.8%) in the voriconazole and 2 subjects (0.8%) in the itraconazole group. 
Two issues were noted : SAEs related to gastrointestinal intolerability were more frequent in the 
itraconazole arm and the more frequent treatment-related hepatobiliary disorders were in the 
voriconazole arm: 9/19 versus 2/14 in the itraconazole arm. The latter was also evident in more frequent 
serious liver enzyme abnormalities: 6 vs 4, respectively. 
The 13 cases in the voriconazole arm that experienced treatment-related hepatotoxicity SAE developed 
mostly liver enzyme abnormalities in the first 4 weeks (8/13). Ten from 13 recovered although duration 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 26/42 
  
  
required for normalization is not provided, whereas 2 died. From the total 9 permanently had to 
discontinue voriconazole, whereas in 4 temporarily medication was stopped. 
In conclusion, treatment-related hepatotoxicity is more severe with voriconazole with subsequent 
discontinuation. Most cases resolved within non-specified time frames. Additional time-AE analysis was 
submitted. The reported incidence of SAEs and hepatic SAEs over the duration of the study provides 
insight that most of these SAEs occurred in the first month. It should be taken into account that the 
number of patients after month 3 decreased rapidly, so the denominator is declining over time. Most 
likely the most susceptible subjects have been filtered out in the first few months and also potentially 
toxic co-medication is less frequently subscribed in the period after 100 days. 
Death 
By Day 180, 40 subjects in the voriconazole group had died (complete cases 18.1%) and 44 subjects in 
the itraconazole group had died (19.3% complete cases). Death rates at day 100, at day 365 and in the 
two subgroups were not significantly different between the two arms. 
Study A1501038 
Serious adverse events were reported in 51.1% of patients and were considered to be related to study 
drug in 20.0% of patients; the most frequently reported being hepatotoxicity (in 2 subjects).  
A total of 12 subjects (26.7%) died before the Month 12 follow-up visit, including 1 subject who died after 
being withdrawn from the study (lost to follow-up), because of complications of HSCT and/or underlying 
malignancy. 
Study medication was discontinued because of AEs for 21 subjects (46.7%), 12 of these discontinuations 
were due to hepatic events. 
Laboratory findings 
A total of 447 subjects had a laboratory value that met a criterion of possible concern (without regard to 
baseline abnormality): 214 subjects (97%) in the voriconazole group and 233 subjects (99%) in the 
itraconazole group. 
In both treatment groups, the most frequently reported clinical laboratory abnormalities without regard to 
baseline abnormality were associated with hematology parameters, ie, hemoglobin, hematocrit, platelets, 
WBC count, and absolute lymphocytes and total neutrophils 
Safety in special populations:  
Acute myeloid leukaemia 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported for 49 subjects (48.0%) in the voriconazole group and 51 
subjects (42.9%) in the itraconazole group.  The incidences of AEs that led to permanent discontinuation 
of study medication among AML subjects who received voriconazole (34.3%) or itraconazole (37.0%) 
were similar to rates of discontinuation due to AEs observed for the overall study population (39.3% for 
voriconazole, and 39.6% for itraconazole).  The type of AEs most frequently leading to study drug 
discontinuation for subjects in the AML  subpopulation were hepatobiliary disorders for subjects treated 
with voriconazole (13.7%) and gastrointestinal disorders for subjects who received itraconazole (10.9%). 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 27/42 
  
  
Hepatic adverse events were reported for 45 subjects (44.1%) in the voriconazole treatment group and 
for 41 subjects (34.5%) in the itraconazole treatment group. Hepatic adverse events resulted in 
permanent discontinuation of study medication for 20 subjects (19.6%) treated with voriconazole and for 
8 subjects (6.7%) treated with itraconazole. 
Myeloablative conditioning regimen 
Treatment-emergent SAEs were reported for 57 subjects (43.8%) in the voriconazole group and 52 
subjects (34.9%) in the itraconazole group. The incidences of AEs that led to permanent discontinuation 
of study medication among MAC subjects who received voriconazole (33.8%) or itraconazole (36.9%) 
were similar to rates of discontinuation due to AEs observed for the overall study population in the 
voriconazole treatment group (39.3%) and the itraconazole group (39.6%). 
Among subjects in the MAC subpopulation, the incidence of AEs coding to the Hepatobiliary Disorders 
SOC was higher for subjects treated with voriconazole (28.5%) than among those treated with 
itraconazole (18.1%). Hepatic adverse events were reported for 63 subjects (48.5%) in the voriconazole 
treatment group and for 44 subjects (29.5%) in the itraconazole treatment group.  
Hepatobiliary AEs resulted in permanent discontinuation of study medication for 25 subjects (19.2%) 
treated with voriconazole and for 10 subjects (6.7%) treated with itraconazole. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
There were slightly more discontinuations due to treatment related AEs in the voriconazole group 
compared to the itraconazole group (25.6% vs 21.6%). Among subjects who received voriconazole, the 
type of adverse events most frequently leading to study drug discontinuation were Hepatobiliary 
Disorders (15.8%, compared with 4.3% in the itraconazole group). 
Gastrointestinal Disorders were the most frequent reason for study drug discontinuation among subjects 
who received itraconazole (13.7%, compared with 0.9% in the voriconazole group).  
Post marketing experience 
It is estimated that 5,137,127 patients were exposed to voriconazole worldwide since first approval. It is 
estimated that in clinical trials, 165,560 children were exposed. 
Off-label use in general: According to the data available to the MAH, voriconazole is used in 5% of 
patients using prophylactic treatment in haematological setting in Europe. This value was stable during 
the last 4 years (2008 to 2011c). In 2011 voriconazole was used for prophylaxis in 6.9% of 
haematological patients including HSCT recipients. The MAH stated that given a very restricted number of 
lung transplant recipients, the prescription databases may not be representative for this population. 
According to the data among 31,380 recorded patients who received voriconazole in France, Germany, 
Italy, United Kingdom and Spain in 2010, only 183 (0.6%) were lung transplant recipients. The only 
country in which the prophylactic prescription was captured in these patients was the UK with 29 
subjects. In 2011, of the 32,387 recorded patients who received voriconazole in France, Germany, Italy, 
United Kingdom and Spain, only 240 (0.7%) were lung transplant recipients but none reported 
prophylactic use. Given the availability of published reports and case studies from other European 
countries, the data may not reflect actual voriconazole use in lung transplant recipients. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 28/42 
  
  
Similar to the situation described above, there is moderate potential for off-label-paediatric use with 
voriconazole for the prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections. 
The MAH states that no post-authorisation cases of off-label use have identified any safety concerns 
substantially different from those associated to the use in authorised indications.  
Based on the data so far, the current risks as laid down in the RMP describe the safety profile of 
voriconazole appropriately. The safety profile of children is mostly comparable with that of adults.  
However, there are two issues that are of specific concern: long-term treatment and long-term treatment 
of paediatric patients. So far, 165,560 children have been exposed in clinical trials to voriconazole, it is 
not suspected that a sufficient number of children has been exposed up to 6 months to be able to 
extrapolate this for the prophylactic use.  
The data so far indicate a higher reporting rate of phototoxicity skin reactions and cases of acute 
pancreatitis in children. However, as little is known on children, special attention should be given to the 
use and reactions in children regarding all safety concerns already known.  
More skin disorders have been reported in children. The most concerning issue remains the SCC. In 
Eudravigilance on 03 September 2013, 49 reports of squamous cell carcinoma were included, of which 2 
paediatric cases.  The exact mechanism of the development of SCC is not yet known. However, 
phototoxicity may play a role.  
Cases of SCC were reported more often with longer durations of therapy with voriconazole. Some cases 
have occurred within 6 months. In the past, the SmPC has been updated several times to address this 
risk. There have been reports of SCC when used as prophylaxis as well. There is no reason to assume 
that the risk of SCC is different with different indications. So far, the most data was known on solid 
transplant data but cases are occurring in all long-term use. 
For the risks of ‘Skin cancer’ – and for that of hepatotoxicity - educational material including a HCP 
Checklist, HCP Q&A Brochure, and Patient Alert Card are in place. This educational material has been 
agreed recently. 
Major difficulty is that ‘long-term use’ has not been clearly defined as yet. In the SmPC warnings are 
given on use for longer than 6 months, based on the available data at that moment: the most – but not 
all - SCC cases were seen after > 6 months of duration.  
In many SCC cases, voriconazole was used for more than 6 months, extending to years. The MAH applies 
for an indication for prophylactic use up to 6 months. However, according to the SmPC longer use is 
possible for the treatment indication. It may be expected that in clinical practice, longer than 6 months 
use will occur. Furthermore, it is not clearly known whether, apart from SCC, the other safety concerns 
may occur more frequently as some of them tend to be linked to long-term use as well.  
For this reason long-term treatment is not recommended and for voriconazole in general, long term 
exposure (treatment or prophylaxis) greater than 6 months requires careful assessment of the benefit-
risk balance, as is stated in the current SmPC proposal.  
Regarding the use in children, reference is made to section 2.6 below (Risk Management Plan) in which 
the Applicant included more updates and reports on the specific pharmacovigilance on children, with 
special attention for the long-term use, skin disorders, hepatotoxicity and pancreatitis.     
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 29/42 
  
  
Also, the MAH will be closely monitor the safety data in paediatric patients on prophylaxis treatment 
through post-marketing surveillance program and take measures if any signal is identified. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Gastrointestinal AEs were common in both groups with 10% more subjects in the itraconazole group than 
in the voriconazole group experiencing these AEs (i.e. at least 40% compared to 30%). This increase 
resulted in more discontinuations in the itraconazole arm which may be partly related to the open label 
design.  
Regardless of a longer duration of exposure of voriconazole with subsequent more cumulative hepatotoxic 
events compared to itraconazole, hepatic AEs were more severe and hepatic AEs resulted in permanent 
discontinuation of study medication more frequently in the voriconazole group:  50 subjects (21.4%) 
treated with voriconazole and for 18 subjects (7.1%) treated with itraconazole. This increase (at least 
twice as much) is more than the difference in duration (25%). 
Visual disorders were more frequent in the voriconazole arm and are included in the SmPC. Other 
voriconazole-associated AEs that merit specific consideration due to prolonged administration in 
prophylactic setting are phototoxicity, risk of Squamous Cell Carcinoma and periostitis, although not 
observed in the present studies. 
Duration of prophylaxis was approximately 30 days longer in voriconazole and more treatment-related 
AEs were recorded: 
-  Vision disorders:  for voriconazole 
-  Gastrointestinal: for itraconazole 
-  Hepatobililiary disorders: for voriconazole, 50% vs. 30% treatment-emergent hepatobiliary 
disorders including 9 vs. 2 SAEs. However, none of these progressed to liver failure and in case of 
discontinuation (20% v. 7% in case of treatment-emergent hepatic AEs) these liver enzyme 
abnormalities were reversible. 
In addition, the SAEs were provided. Many single events/disorders were noticed, and although some of 
these single events were considered treatment related, the clinical condition of patients and concurrent 
medication may complicate establishing causality. This includes the photopsia in a single case in the 
voriconazole arm that resulted in permanent discontinuation and resolved subsequently in 3 days. 
Two issues merit attention: SAEs related to gastrointestinal intolerability in the itraconazole arm that 
were more frequent and the more frequent treatment-related hepatobiliary disorders in the voriconazole 
arm: 9/19, versus 2/14 in the itraconazole arm. The latter was also evident in more frequent serious liver 
enzyme abnormalities: 6 vs 4, respectively. 
The 13 cases in the voriconazole arm that experienced treatment-related hepatotoxicity SAE developed 
mostly liver enzyme abnormalities in the first 4 weeks (8/13). Ten from 13 recovered although duration 
required for normalization is not provided, whereas 2 died. From the total 9 permanently had to 
discontinue voriconazole, whereas in 4 medication was stopped temporarily. 
No periostitis was noticed and only 3 cases of phototoxicity without SCC. 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 30/42 
  
  
 
 
 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on clinical safety 
Treatment-related hepatotoxicity is more severe with voriconazole with subsequent discontinuation. No 
liver failure was recorded. Most cases resolved within non-specified time frames.  
Considering the non-standardized PK measurements, any relation between AEs or SAEs and plasma 
exposure of voriconazole could not be determined. As a consequence, dose adjustments in case of AEs 
during use of voriconazole as a prophylactic agent cannot be advised. Therefore, discontinuation of 
voriconazole must be considered in case of AEs associated with voriconazole: hepatotoxicity, phototoxicity 
including SCC, visual disorders and periostitis, and use of alternative antifungal agents should also be 
considered. 
2.6.  Risk Management Plan 
2.6.1.  PRAC advice 
The CHMP received the following PRAC advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan. 
PRAC Advice 
Based on the PRAC review of the Risk Management Plan version 2, the PRAC considers by consensus that 
the risk management system for voriconazole (Vfend) in the prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections in 
high risk Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplant (HSCT) recipients including patients with Acute Myeloid 
Leukemia (AML) and patients who have received myeloablative conditioning regimens could be 
acceptable. 
With the extension of indication the number of long term paediatric patients using Vfend is likely to 
increase. Therefore the MAH is asked to discuss and reconsider the feasibility of a PASS in paediatric 
patients. 
This advice is based on the following content of the Risk Management Plan:

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed post-authorisation 
PhV development plan is sufficient to identify and characterise the risks of the product.

The PRAC, having considered the data submitted, was of the opinion that the proposed risk minimisation 
measures are sufficient to minimise the risks of the product in the proposed indication. 
The CHMP endorsed this advice with changes. 
These changes concerned the following elements of the Risk Management Plan: the communication plan 
(Annex 8) of the additional risk minimisation measures for the safety concerns phototoxicity, SCC and 
hepatotoxicity and the PASS study A1501102 = Evaluation of the effectiveness of the additional risk 
minimisation measures proposed to reduce the risk of phototoxicity, hepatotoxicity and SCC in the EU 
planned in a previous variation (II/95). 
Taken into account the limitations of the prophylaxis clinical study as discussed above and the 
recommendations that, when treatment-related AEs (i.e., hepatotoxicity, skin toxicity including SCC, 
visual disorders and periostitis) appear that voriconazole should be discontinued and alternatives must be 
considered ; and also considering the key role of the education materials in minimising the voriconazole 
related safety risks, the CHMP agreed that the previously agreed educational materials should be rolled 
out throughout the EU as soon as possible.  
The pilot phase to be run in United Kingdom and France and the PASS study A1501102 to evaluate the 
effectiveness of the education material before deployment of the material throughout Europe (as agreed 
within procedure II-95) were not to be considered opportune anymore. 
Consequently, the MAH proposed a new Communication Plan, allowing a prompt dispatch of the 
educational material throughout Europe. This new Communication Plan (Annex 8 of RMP) was endorsed 
by the CHMP. 
The new information added to the SmPC through this extension of indication, including the paediatric 
warning in section 4.4 and the information in relating to prophylaxis use, will be added to the educational 
materials. 
In addition, it is noted that the Vfend Annex II, D – ‘Conditions and Restrictions with regards to the safe 
and effectiveness use of the medicinal product’ is updated to add the agreed education materials in the  
‘Additional risk minimisation measures’ section .  
The MAH also submitted within this extension of indication three reports/updates which were originally 
requested for the next PSUR (submission 9th of May 2014): 
1.  Feasibility of a potential active surveillance program using secondary Pharmacoepidemiology 
Databases or existing population based registries to monitor selected events in patients with long-
term voriconazole use 
2.  Non-interventional PASS (A1501097) Progress Report

3.  Feasibility assessment of a potential observational study to evaluate the association between 
voriconazole use and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC of the skin in children aged less than 18 
years: updates on the on-going feasibility assessment.  
The detailed assessment of these documents will be performed during the PSUR assessment procedure. 
2.7.  Changes to the Product Information 
During  the  procedure,  the  CHMP  extensively  discussed  the  proposed  PI  and  some  amendments  were 
requested. 
It was agreed that the new indication in section 4.1 should be ‘Prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections 
in high risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) recipients.’ 
The full agreed SmPC and Package Leaflet is found in attachment 1of this assessment report. 
The contacts of the local representation for Greece and Cyprus were updated in the Package Leaflet.  
Changes were also made to the PI to bring it in line with the current Agency/QRD template. 
2.8.  Significance of paediatric studies 
As per article 45(3) of Regulation (EC) No 1901/2006 and EC’s Communication 2008/C 243/09, the CHMP 
is of the opinion that studies, which are contained in the agreed Paediatric Investigation Plan 
P/0151/2013, which is completed, and in the case of A1501081, A1501088, a population pharmacokinetic 
analysis and an extrapolation study have been completed after 26 January 2007, are considered 
significant. 
A1501081 Open-label, intravenous to oral switch, multiple dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, 
safety and tolerability of voriconazole in immunocompromised adolescents aged 12 to <17 years who are 
at high risk for systemic fungal infection  
A1501088 Open-label, intravenous to oral switch, multiple dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, 
safety and tolerability of voriconazole in immunocompromised children aged 2 to <12 years who are at 
high risk for systemic fungal infection  
a population Pharmacokinetic Analysis of Voriconazole in Children, Adolescents and Adults based on the 
results of the 4 above mentioned studies A1501037, A1501007, A1501081, and A1501088 
an extrapolation of the efficacy and safety data from the studies A1501038 and A1501073, to the subset 
of patients 24 months to less than 18 years of age. 
These studies provide meaningful data in the paediatric population.

3.  Overall conclusion and impact on the benefit/risk balance 
Benefits 
The antifungal agent voriconazole was compared with itraconazole for the primary prophylaxis of Invasive 
Fungal Infections (IFI) in subjects requiring allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) in a 
prospective, open-label, comparative, multicenter study (Study A1501073). Subjects received study drug 
immediately following HSCT and continued for a minimum of 100 days to a maximum of 180 days. All 
subjects were followed for breakthrough IFI and survival for 180 days irrespective of prior discontinuation 
for any reason. In addition a prospective, non-comparative study (A1501038) was submitted in 43 
subjects with allogeneic HSCT with prior IFI to determine efficacy and safety of voriconazole in secondary 
prophylaxis up to a maximum of 150 days. 
Beneficial effects 
Voriconazole in the dose of 200 mg bid has proven antifungal activity and is recommended in the 
treatment of invasive aspergillosis and in other indications.  
Voriconazole as a prophylactic agent with the same dose as for treatment demonstrated in the pivotal 
study similar IFI incidences (respectively 3 (1.3%) vs 5 (2.1%) in the mITT population) compared to 
itraconazole oral solution, a widely used antifungal prophylactic agent with a B1 recommendation of the 
ECIL in allogeneic HSCT recipients in the initial neutropenic phase or during Graft versus Host disease. No 
treatment emergent breakthrough IFI in the voriconazole arm was shown (defined as occurring while 
receiving study medication or within 7 days of discontinuation). 
These clinical benefits determined in all subjects were also evident in two subgroups of patients that most 
specifically require antifungal prophylaxis due to prolonged neutropenia: patients with AML and patients 
undergoing myeloablative conditioning regimens.  
Patients were able to use voriconazole during a longer period of time (at least 20 days more) compared 
to itraconazole. 
Survival up to day 180 appears to be similar in both treatment arms, with no significant difference in the 
death rate at any time point measured. The point estimate on the difference lies around zero.  
The intravenous formulation of voriconazole allows administration of voriconazole in the lead-in period to 
rapidly achieve adequate trough levels in patients with vomiting or reduced absorption, such as patients 
with mucositis or GVHD of the intestines. 
Used in secondary prophylaxis 3 out of 28 (10.7%) of patients in the mITT population had a proven or 
probable IFI at 12 month follow up. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
The rates of IFI in both arms in this study are substantially lower than what have been reported in 
previous studies. Several factors could explain the low IFI rate; e.g. early initiation of prophylaxis (at the 
moment of HSCT), antifungal use prior to inclusion and a liberal use of antifungals during the trial in line 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/379202/2014 
Page 37/42 
  
  
with the empiric approach adopted in the study, and potential IFI’s could have been missed due to a lack 
of standardized efforts to establish the diagnosis of fungal disease.  
The open label design combined with the known gastrointestinal safety profile of itraconazole could have 
resulted in earlier discontinuation of itraconazole.  
Although it is possible to conclude efficacy of voriconazole over placebo, due to the aforementioned 
reasons it is not possible to draw confirmatory conclusions on the relative efficacy of voriconazole versus 
itraconazole. Due to lack of IFIs and incomprehensible lack of monitoring of voriconazole trough 
concentrations in the comparative study, essential information are not available on trough levels required 
for prophylaxis. As a consequence, retrospective data and preliminary recommendations on trough levels 
of 0.5 ug/ml cannot be validated. 
Risks 
Unfavourable effects 
Although the occurrence of AEs was similar in both groups, more treatment emergent SAEs were 
recorded in the voriconazole arm (47% vs. 37%).  
More patients in the voriconazole arm experienced hepatobiliary AEs (more than twice as much) than in 
the itraconazole arm.  
An overview of the SAEs showed that SAEs related to gastrointestinal intolerability in the itraconazole arm 
were more frequent as compared to voriconazole arm. Hepatobiliary disorders were more frequently 
reported in the voriconazole arm: 9/19, versus 2/14 in the itraconazole arm. The latter was also evident 
in more frequent serious liver enzyme abnormalities: 6 vs 4, respectively. 
The 13 cases in the voriconazole arm that experienced treatment-related hepatotoxicity SAE developed 
mostly liver enzyme abnormalities in the first 4 weeks (8/13). Ten from 13 recovered although duration 
required for normalization is not provided, whereas 2 died. In 9 patients voriconazole was permanently, 
whereas in 4 patients voriconazole was temporarily discontinued. 
Furthermore, hepatotoxicity was more severe, as the reason for discontinuation because of hepatobiliary 
disorders was 12.8 vs. 3.5%, and occurrence of serious hepatobiliary events 6.0% vs. 1.6%, 
respectively. It may also result in non-justified diagnosis of GVHD of the liver as may be derived from the 
difference in occurrence of 4.3% vs 1.2%, respectively.  
In conclusion, treatment-related hepatotoxicity was more severe with voriconazole with subsequent 
discontinuation. Most cases resolved within non-specified time frames. 
At least 30% of subjects experienced vomiting in the voriconazole group and 40% diarrhoea, which may 
reduce absorption and adequate serum concentrations and result in requirement of additional antifungals 
to treat (sub)clinical IFI. 
Visual disturbances were more frequent: 23.9% vs 17.3%, including visual impairment in 6.4% vs. 0.8% 
and visual hallucinations (2.6% vs. 0.8%). 
The interaction profile of voriconazole in this group of patients requires continuous caution and additional 
TDM analyses of co-medication.

In the literature, squamous cell carcinoma is mainly reported in lung/heart transplant patients with 
prolonged use of voriconazole (median 284 days in Vadnerkar, et al. and 31.2-61.2 months in Feist, et al) 
which is beyond what is recommended in the voriconazole SmPC for prophylaxis use (Section 4.2). The 
median duration of treatment of voriconazole in study A1501073 was 97 days in the SmPC a maximum of 
100 days is mentioned. 
The recommendations for early discontinuation of voriconazole in cases of phototoxicity, premalignant 
conditions, SCC, when LFTs are markedly elevated, and periostitis, are already approved in the SmPC and 
would apply to any voriconazole use; including therapeutic and prophylactic use.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The open label design may have influenced discontinuation rates due unfavourable effects, especially in 
case of vomiting in the itraconazole arm. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
IFI is associated with high mortality even with adequate treatment options in place (30% in the 
voriconazole arm in the Herbrecht study, NEJM, 2002).  IFI are reported as major complications after 
allogeneic HSCT. Prophylaxis with antifungal drugs to prevent IFI in high-risk patients is common and 
recommended in clinical practice, also considering the lack of reliable diagnostics and the high mortality 
rate associated with IFIs.   
Voriconazole is active against a wide range of yeasts and filamentous fungi, including Candida and 
Aspergillus. Voriconazole is available in intravenous and oral formulations and has been proven to be safe 
and effective for the treatment of IFI’s in immunocompromised patients including HSCT recipients. Note 
that voriconazole is (provisionally) recommended by the European Conference on Infections in Leukemia 
for prophylaxis in HSCT recipients1.  
Voriconazole is expected to be effective in prophylaxis of IFI in high risk patients receiving allogeneic 
hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients. However the risk of serious adverse events including 
voriconazole-associated hepatotoxicity has to be taken into account when administered. 
An additional concerning issue remains the increased risk of SCC. In Eudravigilance on 03 September 
2013, 49 reports of squamous cell carcinoma were included, of which 2 paediatric cases.  The exact 
mechanism of the development of SCC is not yet known. However, phototoxicity may play a role. This is 
not clearly established so the use of extensive sun screen is obligatory, but cannot be seen as a full 
preventive measure.  Cases of SCC were reported more often with longer durations of therapy with 
voriconazole. Some cases have occurred within 6 months.

Moreover, interaction in the CYP450 pathway complicates administration of co-medication and 
complicates patient management because it requires additional diagnostic tests or modification of 
treatment. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk balance 
Although there was no clear difference in the rate of IFI in patients receiving voriconazole or patients 
receiving itraconazole, the incidence of breakthrough IFI in the study, including in the itraconazole arm, 
was considerably lower than would be expected questioning the patient selection and thus the external 
validity of the study.  
However considering the high-risk population included in the study and the putative placebo response in 
these populations superiority of voriconazole over placebo can be assumed. Treatment-related 
hepatotoxic SAEs were more frequent in the voriconazole arm (9 vs. 2) resulting in permanent 
discontinuation and subsequent resolution in most cases. Liver failure was not recorded. Tolerability of 
voriconazole was better than itraconazole resulting in lower discontinuations due to these AEs and longer 
duration of prophylaxis. 
The increased risk of serious adverse events, including photosensitivity reactions potentially resulting in 
SCC, associated with the use of voriconazole  is a main concern. The recommendations for early 
discontinuation of voriconazole in cases of phototoxicity, premalignant conditions, SCC, when LFTs are 
markedly elevated, and periostitis, are already approved in the SmPC and would apply to any 
voriconazole use; including therapeutic and prophylactic use. 
It can be concluded that voriconazole as a prophylactic agent in high risk patients receiving allogeneic 
stem cell transplantation has a positive-benefit risk balance. 
However, in the Product Information, it must be strongly addressed that voriconazole cannot be 
continued when treatment-related AEs (i.e., hepatotoxicity, skin toxicity including SCC, visual disorders 
and periostitis) appear, the duration must be restricted, dose adjustments cannot be advised, and 
alternatives must be considered in case of AEs. 
The following extension of indication is considered sufficient as it focuses on the post-allogeneic HSCT 
period which is the risk period: 
“Prophylaxis of invasive fungal infections (IFI) in high risk allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant 
(HSCT) recipients”. 
Furthermore, the CHMP considers that this variation implements changes to the decision granting the 
marketing authorisation due to a significant public health concern on the following grounds: 
Additional conditions or restrictions are considered necessary to be implemented by Member States in 
order to ensure the safe and effective use of the medicinal product, as discussed in section 2.6 above.

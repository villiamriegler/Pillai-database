2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Problem statement 
2.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hepatitis C viral infection is a global health problem, with over 71 million individuals chronically 
infected worldwide. In a recent systematic review, an estimated 13.2 million children aged 1 – 15 
years are infected with chronic HCV, globally. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
Within the US and Europe's paediatric population, the prevalence of HCV in children and adolescents 
ranges from 0.05% to 0.36%. New HCV infections among the 0 to 4-year-old age group constituted 
0.4% of all new infections in EU/EEA during 2016, 5 – 14 year-olds 0.3%, and 15 – 19 year-olds 1.3%, 
equating to a rate of infection of 0.55, 0.21, and 1.92 per 100,000, respectively. 
Within the paediatric population (< 18 years of age), mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) during the 
perinatal period is the most common reason for paediatric HCV infection, accounting for 60% of cases. 
The remaining paediatric/adolescent cases, acquired after the perinatal period, are attributable to intra-
familial transmission and high-risk behaviours such as intravenous drug abuse.  
There  are  6  major  HCV  GTs,  with  prevalence  varying  by  geographic  region.  Among  the  European 
paediatric population (≤ 14 years old) who tested positive for HCV between 2011 and 2015, genotype 
distribution  was  as  follows:  15%  GT1  (where  not  subtyped),  26.3%  GT1a,  21.3%  GT1b,  3.8%  GT2, 
18.8%  GT3,  13.8%  GT4,  1.3%  GT5,  and  0%  GT6.  The  HCV  genotype  distribution  in  the  paediatric 
population is similar to the HCV genotype pattern in adults. 
2.1.3.  Clinical presentation, diagnosis and prognosis 
Although the majority of children have a mild disease and do not need urgent treatment, advanced 
liver disease and decompensated cirrhosis have been reported in children as young as 3 years of age. 
Disease progression also may occur many years after the initial infection. Guidance published by the 
Hepatology Committee of the European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and 
Nutrition (ESPGHAN) in 2018 recommends that all children with chronic HCV infection should be 
considered for treatment, considering that the rational underlying the indications for treatment of 
adults with chronic infection is also valid for children. Guidance published by ESPGHAN also 
recommends that all children aged 3 to 17 years with chronic HCV infection may be considered 
candidates for treatment and should be considered for treatment if they develop consistently elevated 
serum aminotransferase levels or liver fibrosis. 
2.1.4.  Management 
Current approved treatment options for children aged 3 years and older remains limited although 
expanding. Recently, ledipasvir (LDV)/sofosbuvir (SOF) and SOF + ribavirin (RBV) have been approved 
for use (CHMP positive opinion on 30 April 2020), but they are not pangenotypic IFN-free and the 
recommended regimen for HCV GT2 and GT3 infection requires co-administration with RBV. Moreover, 
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 10/83 
 
 
 
 
during the assessment of this procedure, Epclusa received EU approval for an extension of the 
indication in children from 6 years of age. 
About the product 
Maviret, the fixed dose combination of NS3/4A protease inhibitor GLECAPREVIR and NS5A inhibitor 
PIBRENTASVIR (GLE/PIB), was first authorized in EU on 26 July 2017 for the treatment of chronic 
hepatitis C infection in adults. Approval for extension of the GLE/PIB treatment regimen to adolescents 
was granted in the EU on 12 March 2019. It has been approved for treatment-naïve and treatment-
experienced (i.e. who failed prior therapy with peg-IFN+RBV+/-SOF or SOF+RBV) GT1 to GT6-infected 
patients with compensated liver disease (with or without cirrhosis). 
A paediatric formulation, comprised of coated granules of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in a sachet for 
oral administration, has been developed for use in children from 3 to <12 years of age. While the 
children in the intensive pharmacokinetic (IPK) part of Study M16-123 received GLE and PIB coated 
granules packaged separately, the same GLE and PIB coated granules were co-filled into one sachet for 
greater patient/care giver convenience and is the to-be marketed formulation. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
The applicant is submitting the following grouping according to article 7.2 (b) of the variation 
regulation (cases for grouping variations listed in Annex III to Commission Regulation (EC) No 
1234/2008):  
•  Addition of a new strength and a new pharmaceutical form (50/20 mg coated granules in sachet) 
developed as paediatric formulation: extension of a marketing authorisation under Annex I to 
Commission Regulation (EC) No 1234/2008. 
•  Broadening of the currently approved indication for the approved Maviret 100 mg/40 mg film-
coated tablets to include the treatment of children from 3 to 12 years of age: type II variation. 
This current application for an extension of the indication to children aged 3 years and older is 
supported by new clinical data from part 2 of Study M16-123 [An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to 
Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Efficacy of Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvirin for 8, 12, or 16 
weeks in HCV GT1 – GT6-infected paediatric subjects ≥ 3 to < 18 years of age (DORA)]. 
Part 1 of the study evaluated the use of the adult bilayer tablets in adolescents (Cohort 1) and has 
been previously submitted and assessed to support the extension of the indication in paediatric 
patients from 12 years of age. Part 2 of the study is evaluating the use of the paediatric coated 
granules formulation of GLE + PIB in children ≥ 3 to < 12 years of age (Cohorts 2 – 4). In each cohort, 
subjects are enrolled first into the IPK portion, followed by the non-IPK safety/efficacy portion. 
Additional IPK samples are obtained from subjects in Japan, who enrolled in the non-IPK/efficacy 
portion. 
Development has been conducted in line with the Paediatric Investigational Plan (PIP) (EMA reference 
EMEA-001832-PIP01-15) and the agreed initial Paediatric Study Plan (iPSP) (US Investigational New 
Drug [IND] Number 127416, Reference ID: 3959249).

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
This Line Extension seeks to introduce an age-appropriate formulation needed for the extension of the 
indication to children from 3 years and older in addition to the already approved film-coated tablets 
containing 100 mg glecaprevir and 40 mg pibrentasvir. 
The finished product is presented as coated granules in sachet containing 50 mg glecaprevir and 20 mg 
pibrentasvir. 
Other ingredients are: copovidone, tocofersolan, propylene glycol monocaprylate, colloidal silicon 
dioxide, croscarmellose sodium (in the glecaprevir granules only), sodium stearyl fumarate, 
hypromellose (E464), lactose monohydrate, titanium dioxide, macrogol, iron oxide red (E172), iron 
oxide yellow (E172) 
The product is available in polyethylene terephthalate (PET) /aluminium/polyethylene film sachets as 
described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active Substance 
The active substances (glecaprevir and pibrentasvir) are the same as for the authorised Maviret 100 
mg glecaprevir /40 mg pibrentasvir film-coated tablets. No new information on the active substances 
has been provided within this line extension application. 
2.2.3.  Finished Medicinal Product 
Description of the product and pharmaceutical development 
The finished product is immediate release film coated, pink and yellow, granules in a sachet for oral 
administration. The granules are round and 2 mm in diameter. This is a fixed-dose combination product 
containing 50 mg glecaprevir and 20 mg pibrentasvir co-filled in each sachet.  
Table 1: Description of glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 50 mg/20 mg coated granules in sachet 
The aim of the formulation development was to manufacture an additional age-appropriate formulation 
needed for the extension of the indication to children from 3 years and older. 
The development of the paediatric formula was driven by the QTPP of the product and included the 
following key design requirements: dose flexibility, formulation acceptability and palatability for 
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 12/83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
paediatric patients, bioavailability, stability, and manufacturability. To develop the paediatric 
formulation, the tablet formulation was adapted to the strength of granules in sachet (half that of the 
tablet).  
The granules contain the glecaprevir and pibrentasvir extrudate as the internal phase, an outer phase 
containing a glidant and a lubricant, and the film coating. The composition of the extrudates is the 
same as for the tablets. The qualitative composition of both outer layers is the same as for each layer 
of the Maviret bilayer tablet. The same excipients as in tablet formulation are used. 
All the tablet core excipients comply with Ph. Eur. or NF monographs. The coating agent powder is 
non-compendial, but its components are of Ph. Eur. or NF (iron oxides) quality. There are no novel 
excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is included in section 6.1 of 
the SmPC. 
Lactose and propylene glycol monocaprylate are excipients with recognized action and are mentioned 
in the SmPC. Overall, the excipients do not pose a safety risk for the paediatric population. 
The development of the manufacturing process is described. The compression and film coating to a 
target of 20% weight gain are critical steps. The challenge of the filling step is the accurate filling to 
obtain the desired strengths. Suitable process parameters and in-process controls have been defined 
for these manufacturing steps. 
The dissolution method for the granules is based on the dissolution method used for the tablets, as the 
composition and manufacturing process (up to compression step) are the same. The same dissolution 
mechanism (via erosion) is described. The method is discriminatory for the extrusion step and is 
acceptable for quality control. 
The primary packaging is polyethylene terephthalate (PET)/aluminium/polyethylene film sachets. The 
materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system is 
adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process can be divided into the pre- and post-extrusion process. The pre-extrusion 
process comprises preparation of the glecaprevir and pibrentasvir extrudate intermediates and is the 
same as for the approved tablet formulation. The same approved manufacturing site is used. 
The post-extrusion manufacturing process comprises milling of extrudate intermediates, blending with 
outer phase excipients, compression to granules, coating of granules, and filling of granules into 
sachets. The site AbbVie Chicago USA is responsible for manufacturing of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir 
granule bulk intermediate and AbbVie Italy is responsible for manufacturing of finished medicinal 
product. A major objection was raised in the D120 List of Questions in relation to the GMP compliance 
status of the site AbbVie Chicago USA, but this was resolved by the applicant by submitting the 
required proof of GMP compliance. 
The process is considered to be a standard process. 
The overall control strategy, process parameters and in-process controls seem adequate in view of the 
available development data and in view of the standard nature of the manufacturing process. 
An acceptable process validation scheme has been submitted explaining how major steps of the 
manufacturing process will be validated prior to commercialisation. From batches manufactured to 
date, it has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable of producing the finished 
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 13/83 
 
 
 
 
product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are adequate for this 
type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification analytical procedures, batch analysis 
The finished product release specifications include appropriate tests for this kind of dosage form: 
description of granules (visual), identity of the active substances (HPLC, UV), assay of active 
substances (HPLC), degradation products (HPLC), water content (KF), microbiological quality (Ph. 
Eur.), dissolution (HPLC), and uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods for assay and degradation products are the same as for the approved Maviret 
tablets. 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in 
accordance with the ICH guidelines.  
The potential presence of elemental impurities in the finished product has been assessed using a risk-
based approach in line with the ICH Q3D Guideline for Elemental Impurities. Based on the risk 
assessment and batch data, it can be concluded that it is not necessary to include any elemental 
impurity controls in the finished product specification. 
In addition, a suitable justification was provided for other tests not included in specifications, namely 
crystallinity, residual solvents, and mutagenic impurities.  
In the context of the on-going review under Article 5(3) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 related to the 
potential presence of nitrosamine impurities in human medicinal products, the applicant has presented 
a detailed risk assessment regarding potential nitrosamine impurities in both active substances and in 
the finished product. A major objection was raised in relation to this risk assessment during the 
procedure and this was addressed by the applicant in a satisfactory way. It has been appropriately 
demonstrated that the risk of presence of nitrosamines is negligible.  
Batch analysis results are provided for three production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data from three primary stability batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under 
long term conditions (30 ºC / 75% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 
75% RH) according to ICH guidelines were provided. The manufacturing process used for the primary 
stability batches of medicinal product is representative of the process proposed for marketing and the 
batches were manufactured at the manufacturing sites proposed for marketing. The batches were 
manufactured using at least two different batches of each active substance. Each batch was at least 
one-tenth the scale of the largest proposed production batch size. 
The container closure system proposed for glecaprevir/pibrentasvir 50 mg/20 mg coated granules is 
sachet laminate (from outer to inner layer: polyethylene terephthalate (PET) / aluminium / 
polyethylene (PE). The layer in contact with finished product is polyethylene. The container closure 
used in the stability studies is representative of the one proposed for marketing.  
Tests performed to assess stability include assay, degradation products, description, water content, 
and dissolution. Microbial testing was performed at selected intervals. The stability indicating character 
of the methods for assay and degradation impurities was demonstrated.

No meaningful changes were detected to any of the parameters tested during long-term and 
accelerated stability studies. 
The hold time for the extrudates has been approved for the Maviret tablets. A shelf-life of 9 months for 
the glecaprevir extrudate and 10 months for pibrentasvir extrudate intermediates is claimed. The 
applicant states that the shelf-life of the finished product is started when the extrudates are milled 
together. This is in line with what was justified for the tablets and is accepted given the similar 
formulations and same excipients. 
Two batches of finished product manufactured with glecaprevir and pibrentasvir extrudates that were 
aged between 6 to 11 months, were placed on stability. Twelve months of stability data are available 
for these batches. No meaningful change was observed in any attribute studied under long-term 
storage conditions (30 °C /75% RH) for 12 months and under accelerated storage conditions (40 °C / 
75% RH) for 6 months. 
Supportive stability data is also available from clinical batches of intermediate bulk glecaprevir coated 
granules (24 months) and of pibrentasvir coated granules (24 months) which were packaged in high 
density polyethylene (HDPE) bottles with desiccant. Stability studies were conducted under long-term 
storage conditions (30 °C /75% RH) and under accelerated storage conditions (40 °C / 75% RH) and 
no meaningful change was detected. 
In addition, two batches were exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing 
of New Drug Substances and Products. Based on the results, no special storage conditions to control 
exposure to light are needed. 
Temperature excursion studies and temperature cycling studies were also conducted which support 
any temperature excursions which may occur during shipping or storage. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 2 years as stated in the SmPC (section 6.3) 
is acceptable. No special storage conditions are required. 
Adventitious agents 
It is confirmed that the lactose is produced from milk from healthy animals in the same condition as 
those used to collect milk for human consumption and that the lactose has been prepared without the 
use of ruminant material other than calf rennet according to the Note for Guidance on Minimising the 
Risk of Transmitting Animal Spongiform Encephalopathy Agents Via Human and veterinary medicinal 
products. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has 
been presented in a satisfactory manner. The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and 
uniformity of important product quality characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that 
the product should have a satisfactory and uniform performance in clinical use.  
The CHMP initially raised a major objection in relation to the GMP compliance status of the finished 
product manufacturing site AbbVie Chicago USA. This was addressed by the applicant in a satisfactory 
way. During the procedure and additional major objection was raised in relation to the nitrosamine risk 
assessment presented in this procedure. This was resolved by the applicant in a satisfactory way.

2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects 
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical 
performance of the product have been investigated and are controlled in a satisfactory way. Data has 
been presented to give reassurance on viral/TSE safety. 
2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
Not applicable. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Pharmacology 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted in this procedure to support the line extension into 
the paediatric population, which is considered acceptable by the CHMP. 
2.3.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
No new non-clinical pharmacokinetics studies have been submitted in this application, which is 
acceptable. 
2.3.3.  Toxicology 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted. The applicant provided a justification concerning the 
lack of juvenile animal studies which were deemed not needed before initiation of the paediatric 
program since there were no toxicologic findings that would be considered to be more severe or to 
manifest differently in an adult compared to a paediatric population. Additionally, there are no 
expected differences in metabolism between an adult and a paediatric population for the DAAs. The 
PDCO review did not raise any non-clinical issues. 
2.3.4.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
The environmental risk assessment has been updated in accordance with the EMA Guideline on the 
Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use (2006) and EMA's Questions and 
Answers on the Guideline (2011) (Q&A) for the extended indication. 
During the initial marketing authorisation application in adults, the applicant had already performed 
Phase I studies for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir that revealed PECSURFACEWATER values in excess of 
0.01 μg/L, and Phase II studies (Tier A and Tier B) were in progress. In addition, the log D value for 
pibrentasvir was greater than three, which required an evaluation for the bio-concentration potential 
for this compound. Updated environmental risk assessments for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir were 
submitted for assessment and agreed upon by CHMP during subsequent regulatory procedures.  
In this extension of indication application, the applicant provided a justification in lieu of a full ERA for 
glecaprevir and pibrentasvir.  
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 16/83 
 
 
 
 
Firstly, it was explained that the calculated PECSURFACEWATER values for these compounds will be the 
same as the value calculated for the adult and adolescent indications as: 1) the recommended doses 
for glecaprevir and pibrentasvir for paediatrics are less than the adult / adolescent doses, and 
therefore the highest recommended doses (the adult and adolescent doses) were used to calculate the 
initial PEC values in accordance with EMA guidance, 2) the Fpen will not change as the default 
(conservative) Fpen was used in the original calculation.  
Secondly, it was highlighted that the PECSURFACEWATER values originally calculated for glecaprevir 
and pibrentasvir exceeded the 0.01 μg/L, therefore the required Tier B studies were completed; 
additionally, the log D value of pibrentasvir necessitated completion of a study to evaluate its potential 
for bioaccumulation. To date, no effects of these compounds on the environment have been detected. 
No additional studies are required for the requested extension and revisions to the ERAs for glecaprevir 
and pibrentasvir are not warranted. 
2.3.5.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted in this application, which is acceptable to the CHMP. 
Based on the updated data submitted in this application, no additional studies would be required for 
this extended indication.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
Glecaprevir (ABT-493, GLE)/ pibrentasvir (ABT-530, PIB), formulated as a fixed dose film-coated 
bilayer tablet (100 mg/40 mg tablet) is currently approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection 
(genotype 1 to 6) in adult and adolescents (12 to < 18 years of age) patients. 
A new paediatric formulation, comprised of coated granules of GLE/PIB (50 mg/20 mg) in a sachet for 
a convenient QD oral administration with a soft-food dosing vehicle, has been developed for use in 
children 3 to < 12 years of age and is the subject of the current application. 
In children aged 3 to < 12 years and weighing less than 45 kg, the recommended dosage is presented 
in Table 2. 
Table 2: Recommended dosage for children aged 3 to < 12 years 
This paediatric formulation has been investigated in two studies, Study M16-123 (Part 2) and Study

M17-142 (bioavailability and food effect). Dosing recommendation were guided by the development of 
Population PK models (PPK) of each compound (GLE and PIB). 
Study M17-142 
Design 
Study M17-142 was a Phase 1, single center, open label, randomized study conducted in two parts 
with the aim to evaluate the bioavailability of the experimental GLE+PIB paediatric formulation relative 
to the approved adult formulation (Part 1) and the effect of high-fat and low-fat meals (Part 2) on the 
experimental GLE+PIB formulation relative to fasting conditions. 
Part 1 was a four sequence, four-period crossover design to evaluate the bioavailability of the 
experimental GLE+PIB paediatric formulation relative to the Phase 3 adult formulation in fast and non-
fasting conditions as presented in Table 3.  
Table 3: Sequence groups for Part 1 
Part 2 was a three-sequence, three-period cross-over design to evaluate the effect of a high or low fat 
meal as presented in Table 4 below. 
Table 4: Sequence groups for Part 2 
A wash-out period of 4 days (Part 1) or 5 days (Part 2) was considered. Blood samples for assay of

Under fasting conditions, administration of GLE 300 mg + PIB 120 mg pellets (paediatric formulations; 
Regimen A) compared to GLE/PIB 300/120 mg tablets (adult formulation; Regimen C) resulted in 
slightly lower exposures (AUC) of GLE (39% decrease) and PIB (14% decrease). Under non-fasting 
conditions, administration of GLE 300 mg + PIB 120 mg pellets (paediatric formulations; Regimen B) 
compared to GLE/PIB 300/120 mg tablets (adult formulation; Regimen D) resulted in comparable 
exposures (AUC) of GLE and PIB (≤ 22% difference).

Study M16-123 (Part 2) 
Design 
Study M16-123 is an open-label, multicenter Phase 2/3 study to evaluate the PK, efficacy and safety of 
GLE/PIB  in  chronic  HCV  infected  paediatric  subjects,  divided  two  parts,  according  to  the  formulation 
administered. Part 1 of the study was performed in adolescent patients (12 to < 18 years) with the tablet 
formulation  and  was  already  presented  previously  (EMEA/H/C/004430/II/0012).  Part  2,  HCV  infected 
patients were divided in three cohorts, cohort 2 (9 to < 12 years), cohort 3 (6 to < 9 years) and cohort 
4 (3 to < 6 years). During Part 2 the coated granule formulation of GLE + PIB based on body weight 
dosing regimen, using soft food as dosing vehicle was administered.

Selected doses of GLE and PIB for the paediatric population are presented in Table 11. Briefly 17 
subjects were administered the initial doses. These doses were determined based on modeling from 
data available from the adult formulation, result from Study M17-142 and Study M16-123 (Part 1, 
Adolescent). After the first 17 subjects from the IPK analysis, the dose was adjusted to the final 
proposed dose.

PK sampling consisted of sparse sampling at Day 1, week 4, 8 and 12 and intensive PK (IPK) sampling 
at week 2 at pre-dose, 2, 4, 6, 12 hours after drug intake.  
The primary PK endpoint was the steady state AUC of GLE and PIB at week 2 estimated by NCA or by 
PPK.

paediatric subjects of Part 2 of Study M16-123 following the initial dosing regimens 
After analysis of the pharmacokinetic data following the initial proposed dosing regimen in each cohort 
of Part 2, both GLE and PIB geometric mean exposures were lower than the targeted adult exposures 
(geometric mean GLE and PIB AUC24 values of 4800 ng•hr/mL and 1430 ng•hr/mL, respectively). 
Therefore, both GLE and PIB doses were modified to the final proposed dose ratio of 50 mg GLE + 20 
mg PIB. A summary of PK parameters of GLE and PIB at the Week 2 visit after subjects received the 
final proposed dosing regimens, including the primary PK endpoint (steady-state AUC) and secondary 
PK endpoints (Cmax and CL/F) in addition to predicted exposures in adolescents and adults is

paediatric subjects of Part 2 of Study M16-123 following the final proposed dosing regimens 
compared to adolescent subjects of Part 1 (M16-123) and non-cirrhotic adults subjects.    
The results demonstrated that the Week 2 IPK geometric mean exposures of GLE and PIB at the final 
proposed dosing regimens in HCV-infected non-cirrhotic paediatric subjects in Cohorts 2 – 4 were 1.2 
to 1.8 fold and 1.2 to 1.6 fold higher than the GLE and PIB targeted adult exposures (geometric mean 
GLE and PIB AUC24 values of 4800 ng•hr/mL and 1430 ng•hr/mL, respectively). The range of GLE and 
PIB exposure in HCV-infected non-cirrhotic paediatric subjects in Cohorts 2 - 4 were within the range 
of model-predicted exposures in HCV-infected noncirrhotic adult subjects (AUC24 values range from 
123 – 297000 ng•hr/mL and 148 – 14200 ng•hr/mL, respectively, for GLE and PIB).

Population PK model 
Objective 
The objective of this analysis was to characterize the population PK of GLE and PIB when administered 
in combination in paediatric subjects aged 3 to < 12 years and to identify demographic, physiologic 
and treatment factors that may contribute to the variability in the PK of GLE and PIB. The results of 
this analysis will provide justification for selection of the final dose regimens of GLE and PIB in HCV 
Genotypes 1-6 infected peditaric subjects. 
PK dataset 
The PPK analysis included PK data from study M16-123 Part 1 (adolescent) and Part 2 (paediatric) 
only. No PK data from adult subject were included. An overview of the available PK data is presented in  
Table 14. Plasma concentrations of GLE and PIB in both populations (adolescent and paediatric) were 
determined using the same validated assay method.

Results 
PK data handling 
PPK analyses 
All HCV-infected subjects who received GLE/PIB combination as part of treatment in Part 1 and Part 2 
from study M16-123, and who had at least one measurable concentration of GLE or PIB were included 
in the PPK analyses. 
However several PK samples were flagged and excluded from the PPK analysis: 
- Observed plasma concentrations (≥ LOQ) that were observed prior to the first dose 
- 1 subject from cohort 4 (3 to <6 y) was partially dosed, discontinued from the study, and had no GLE 
or PIB plasma concentration measurements 
- Visit week 2 PK data of 3 subjects from cohort 1 (Adolescent), due to unusual PK profiles 
These 3 subjects along with 1 subject from Cohort 3  which received a double dose on the day of week 
2 was excluded for both PPK and NCA analyses. 
- Observed concentrations below the LLOQ 
- Outlying measurements 
Overall, a total of 34 out 95 subjects were excluded for the NCA analysis. Out of these 34 subjects, 30 
had only sparse PK samples (Cohort 1), 3 subjects have unusual PK concentrations (Cohort 1) and 1 
subject received twice the designated dose on week 2 day 1. 
BQL data 
All the plasma concentration below LLOQ that was observed prior to the first dose were flagged and 
excluded (4 GLE and 4 PIB concentrations). 
The first individual plasma concentration below the LLOQ following a non-BLQ observation between two 
consecutive doses was set to half the LOQ (LLOQ/2), and included in the dataset (25 GLE and 3 PIB). 
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 31/83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
All subsequent observation BLQ: 
- prior to the next non-BLQ observations and prior to the next dose 
- with time since last dose > 7 days were set to LLOQ/2 and excluded (1 GLE and 1 PIB). 
Outlying measurement 
On the basis of visual inspection of concentration and time since last dose relationship, trough plasma 
concentrations (recorded at times greater than 21.6 hours (0.9 days) after the administration of dose) 
measured 45 days or more after the start of the study were excluded from analysis (26 out of 262 
(PART 1) and 24 out of 375 (PART 2) for both GLE and PIB observations). 
In total, 11% of the overall observed concentrations were discarded. Moreover, given the small 
number of BQL (less than 5%), it is agreed with the applicant that there is limited insight when 
exploring additional BLQ handling methods. 
Based on the Nonmem code GLE and PIB PK dataset consisted of 94 patients and 567 observations. 
GLE PPK model development 
A one-compartment PK model with first-order absorption and elimination adequately described the GLE 
concentration-time data. A two-compartment model was not supported by the data. The model was 
parameterized in terms of CL/F, V2/F, and absorption rate constant (KA). Based on the results from 
the Study M17-142, differences in the relative bioavailability (F1) between the adult and paediatric 
formulations was parameterized and fixed  for paediatric subjects in Part 2 and  for adolescent subjects 
in Part 1. In order to avoid flip-flop behavior, the absorption rate constant was parameterized to 
constrain it to be greater than the elimination rate constant (K = CL/V2). Body weight (BW) allometric 
scaling of clearance and volume was treated as part of the structural base model. Using body surface 
area instead of body weight for allometric scaling of CL/F and V2/F led to indifferent results. As body 
weight is a more convenient body measure, it was kept as part of the base model. All structural 
parameters were estimated with acceptable precision (RSE <30%). Correlated random effects were 
included for CL/F and V2/F to describe inter-individual variability. A proportional error model was used 
to describe the residual error. The summary of model selection is presented in Error! Reference s
ource not found. and final PK parameter estimates in Table 16. 
The CV of IIV for CL/F and V2/F were 194% and 200% with ETA-shrinkage of 2 and 2.9% respectively. 
Except BW which was considered in the base structure PK model, no other covariates was found 
significant. BW exponent on CL/F and V2/F were estimated respectively at 0.944 and 1.04.

base model. The scatterplots for the correlations between CL/F and V2/F vs. body weight are showed 
in Figure 5. The lack of any trends in ETA plots for CL/F and V2/F vs. body weight showed that adding 
body weight in the model did not introduce any bias.

PIB PPK model development 
A two-compartment PK model with first order absorption and elimination, including a lag in absorption 
time adequately described the PIB concentration-time data. A two-compartment model was more 
appropriate in describing the observed data than a one compartment model. The model was 
parameterized in terms of CL/F, V2/F, KA, apparent inter-compartmental clearance (Q/F), apparent 
volume of distribution of the peripheral compartment (V3/F) and absorption lag time (ALAG1). Based 
on the results from Study M17-142, the difference in the relative bioavailability (F1) between the two 
formulations was parameterized and fixed for paediatric subjects (Part 2) and for adolescent subjects 
(Part 1). In order to avoid flip-flop behavior, the absorption rate constant was parameterized to 
constrain it to be greater than the elimination rate constant (K = CL/V2). Body weight allometric 
scaling of clearance and volume was treated as part of the structural base model. Using body surface 
area instead of body weight for allometric scaling of CL/F and V2/F led to indifferent results. As body 
weight is a more convenient body measure, it was kept as part of the base model. All structural 
parameters were estimated with acceptable precision. Correlated random effects were included for 
CL/F and V2/F to describe inter-individual variability. A proportional error model was used to describe 
the residual error. Final PK parameter estimates are provided in Table 17. 
The CV of IIV for CL/F and V2/F were 64.4% and 45.9% with ETA-shrinkage of 4.6% and 8.3% 
respectively. Except BW which was considered in the base structure PK model, no other covariates was 
found significant. BW exponent on CL/F and V2/F were estimated respectively at 0.402 and 0.728. 
Table 17: Parameter estimates and variability for PIB PK: Base and Final Model 
The GOF for the final model are presented in Figure 6. On a log-scale, DV vs IPRED show that most 
values lay near the line of identity, indicating that the model adequately described the observations 
over the entire GLE plasma concentration range (and by cohort). The CWRES vs PRED or vs TIME does 
not show a particular trend. 
Model evaluation was performed using a pcVPC, presented in Figure 7. Overall the variability in the 
observed data is described with reasonable accuracy and the central tendency of the data is well 
described. Finally a bootstrap analysis was performed with satisfactory results.

Figure 8. The lack of any trend in ETA plots for CL/F and V2/F vs. body weight showed that adding 
body weight in the model did not introduce any bias.

Two PPK models for GLE and PIB were developed based on PK data from study M16-123 only, from 
which derived PK parameters (AUC24 at week 2) were compared a) to AUC24 adult targets, b) to 
AUC24 estimated by NCA. Then PK simulations were performed considering GLE and PIB body weight

based dosing to justify the selected dose. To this end adequate PPK models for both compounds are 
needed. 
An update of both PPK models was requested in order to solve many issues (dose non-linearity, flip-
flop kinetics, inadequate structural PK model, estimation of relative bioavailability…), however even if 
significant efforts were provided, the PPK models were not updated, therefore results from the 
simulation exercise are still not considered reliable. As a consequence, the PK similarity based on 
exposures between children and adult/adolescent, as claimed by the Applicant in the SmPC cannot be 
endorsed on this basis. 
Comparison of GLE and PIB exposures in paediatric, in adolescent and adults 
Based on post hoc final model pharmacokinetic parameters, the GLE and PIB geometric mean 
exposures (steady-state area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to 24 hours 
post-dose [AUC24]) were derived for the 46 HCV-infected paediatric and 14 HCV-infected adolescent 
subjects with intensive PK sampling. Here, 29 out of 46 subjects that were administered the adjusted 
dosing (Period 2) are discussed. Geometric mean AUC24 for subjects from 3 to < 6 years of age were 
8990 ng•hr/mL and 1760 ng•hr/mL, for subjects from 6 to < 9 years of age were 5160 ng•hr/mL and 
1730 ng•hr/mL and for subjects from 9 to < 12 years of age were 8120 ng•hr/mL and 2360 ng•hr/mL, 
for GLE and PIB respectively. The GLE and PIB geometric mean AUC24 estimated for the adolescent 
subjects, using the final PK model that included body weight based allometric scaling and relative 
bioavailability to compensate for different formulation, were 4940 ng•hr/mL and 1530 ng•hr/mL and 
comparable to the previously obtained 4380 ng•hr/mL and 1440 ng•hr/mL using a PK model based on 
adolescent subjects only. 
The paediatric geometric mean AUC24 values are somewhat higher by (≤ 87% for GLE, ≤ 65% for 
PIB) than the reported geometric mean GLE and PIB AUC24 values of 4800 ng•hr/mL and 1430 
ng•hr/mL, respectively, in HCV-infected non-cirrhotic adults receiving 300 mg/120 mg approved 
formulation (R&D/16/0234). Since GLE has high variability in exposures and PIB has moderate to high 
variability in exposures, the estimated GLE and PIB geometric mean exposures for paediatric subjects 
are still acceptable. Moreover, the predicted GLE and PIB exposure ranges in HCV-infected paediatric 
subjects were within the exposure ranges of GLE and PIB in HCV-infected noncirrhotic adults (Table 
18).

mg, 200/80 mg and 150/60 mg, respectively, are provided in Figure 9. 
Subjects in Period 2, in general, show higher exposures as compared to the subjects in Period 1. GLE 
exposures in Period 2 lie within the target AUC range of 2400-9600 ng.h/mL, however they are some 
rather high exposures predicted in Cohort 2 and Cohort 4.  
PIB exposures in Period 2 lie within the target AUC range of 715-2860 ng.h/mL, with only a few lying 
outside the range.

The distribution of AUC24 by body weight groups in Figure 11 shows that most of the simulated 
individuals show exposure within the range of (0.5 × AUC24adult, 2 × AUC24adult). Thus, the selected 
body weight group-based dosing is most likely to result in paediatric exposures similar to the 
exposures that are shown to be safe and efficacious in adults.

2.4.3.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
Glecaprevir / pibrentasvir, formulated as a fixed dose film-coated bilayer tablet (100 mg/40 mg tablet) 
is currently approved for the treatment of chronic HCV infection (genotype 1 to 6) in adult and 
adolescents (12 to < 18 years of age) patients. The pharmacokinetics of both compounds have been 
well characterized in adult patients and particularly for both non-linear PK behaviour have been already 
described.

The current Type II variation of extension of the indication of GLE/PIB in the paediatric population (3 to 
< 12 years) have been addressed according to the paediatric investigation part of GLE/PIB clinical 
development. In support of expanding the treatment of HCV infection using an extrapolation of adult 
PK to patients aged 3 to < 12 years, Abbvie conducted an exploratory Phase 2/3 study (Study M16-
123, Part 2 with three cohorts) in patients aged 3 to <12 years. A new paediatric formulation, 
comprised of coated granules of GLE/PIB (50mg/20 mg, commercial formulation) in a sachet has been 
developed. However it is important to note that no PK data with the commercial formulation GLE/PIB 
(“/”for combined in the same formulation) are available. During the development program 
experimental formulation of GLE+PIB (”+” for separated compounds) were used in two studies (Study 
M17-142 and M16-123), this was accepted by the PDCO. 
Study M17-142 was designed to study the relative bioavailability of the experimental paediatric 
formulation of GLE/PIB supplied separately as GLE+PIB film-coated pellet (not the commercial 
formulation where GLE and PIB are in the same sachet) vs the adult commercial formulation of 
GLE/PIB tablet (100/40 mg) in fast and fed states (Part 1: non-fasting; Part 2: high and low fat meal). 
The GLE and PIB single dose investigated was 300/120 mg.  
Result from the Part 1 indicated that: 
a) Under fasting conditions, administration of GLE+PIB vs GLE/PIB resulted in slightly low exposure 
with an AUCinf GMR (90%CI) of 0.607 (0.479-0.769) for GLE and 0.862 (0.695-107) for PIB 
b) Under non-fasting conditions, administration of GLE+PIB vs GLE/PIB resulted in slightly low 
exposure with an AUCinf GMR (90%CI) of 0.795 (0.665-0.950) for GLE and 1.219 (0.978-1.52) for PIB 
Overall, these results suggest that the paediatric and the adult formulations do not perform similarly 
and are not considered interchangeable, this have been highlighted in the SmPC. 
Results from the Part 2 indicated that: 
c) the administration of GLE+PIB (high fat meal) vs GLE+PIB (fast) resulted in 2.3-fold and 2.1-fold 
higher exposure of GLE and PIB, respectively, compared to fasting conditions 
d) the administration of GLE+PIB (low fat meal) vs GLE+PIB (fast) resulted in 2.6-fold and 1.5-fold 
higher exposure of GLE and PIB, respectively, compared to fasting conditions. 
In addition based on the results from Part 1, by considering the administration of GLE+PIB (non-
fasting) vs GLE+PIB (fasting) (Table 5, regimen B vs regimen A), resulted in a 2.4-fold (2710/1110) 
and 1.7-fold (1580/924) higher exposure of GLE and PIB respectively, compared to fasting conditions. 
Overall, these results suggest that whatever the content of the meal (breakfast, high or low fat), the 
exposure of both compounds is approximately two-fold increase compared to fasting conditions. 
Initially a GLE+PIB experimental formulation (40 mg+ 15 mg) was investigated in a cohort of 17 
paediatric patients from which AUC24 estimated by NCA was far from the GLE and PIB adult target 
(4800 and 1430 ng.h/mL). Therefore the 50 mg+20 mg formulation was investigated in 29 additional 
paediatric patients. In the three cohorts a slight increase of 25% of the initial dose of GLE and 30% of 
PIB was associated to approximately a 2.1-3.52-fold increase of GLE AUC24, and a 1.5-1.9-fold 
increase of PIB AUC24 respectively. These results could be explained by the known non-linear PK 
behaviour of both compounds. Importantly, even if the observed AUC24 in the paediatric population 
appears 1.2-1.8-fold greater for GLE and 1.06-1.6-fold greater for PIB than the adult target, it should 
be noted that no major safety signal was observed, and the efficacy endpoint (SVR12) was observed in 
46/47 patients (please refer to the efficacy and safety parts). Based on these preliminary PK results 
(without modelling & simulation), the applicant claimed weight –based dosing regimen can be 
supported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 47/83 
 
 
 
 
However, for the extension of indication in the paediatric population, a population PK analysis was 
developed for each compound from which a simulation exercise was performed to support the 
comparability of exposure between adult and paediatric patients with the claimed weight-based dosing 
regimen. Overall the applicant claimed that both PPK models are fit for purpose and this is not 
endorsed particularly for the GLE PPK model.  
Final GLE PPK model consisted of a one compartment PK model with first order absorption and first 
order elimination from the central compartment parameterized with CL/F, V2/F, ka, and IIV terms on 
CL/F, Vc/F only. To avoid flip-flop kinetics ka was constraint to be greater than ke (ke=CL/Vé). BW 
allometric scaling was considered with estimated exponents. Since two formulations were used tablet 
for adolescent and granule for children, relative bioavailability (F1) was fixed for the granule 
formulation based on the results from Study M17-142. 
PK parameters were estimated with good precision for both fixed and random effects (RSE <26%). 
CL/F and V2/F IIV were particularly high 194% and 200% (CV%). CL/F and V2 was highly correlated 
(>0.98) and this was accounted with an omega block. Eta-shrinkage was particularly low <3%. RUV 
modeled as a proportional error model was estimated at 0.58 (variance) which turns to 76% suggests 
a refinement of the PPK model.  
Such inflated RUV (76%) and the inflated IIV of CL/F (194%) can be explained with regards to the 
several assumptions made by the applicant. Four parameters are expected to be estimated (Ka, CL/F, 
V2/F and FR) and in state one, CL/F is of interest (to derive the AUC24), since FR is fixed, Ka is fixed 
(flip-flop assumption) and V2/F is highly correlated to CL/F (>0.98). 
GOF plots were provided without any local regression line to allow easy detection of potential 
misspecification. A pcVPC was provided, showing clearly that the absorption phase is not well captured, 
whereas the terminal elimination phase appears slightly over-predicted. 
The applicant concludes that the model fit for purpose, however this is not endorsed. 
Indeed based on the initial PPK model in adults (initial MAA in 2016, report RD160234), GLE PPK model 
consisted of a two compartment PK model where the non-linear behavior of GLE was accounted for and 
no parameterization to avoid flip flop kinetics was performed. IIV was estimated on CL/F and F.  
The final PIB PPK model consisted of a two compartment PK model with first order absorption with lag 
time (ALAG1) and first order elimination from the central compartment parameterized with CL/F, V2/F, 
Q/F and V3/F ka, and IIV terms on CL/F, Vc/F only. To avoid flip-flop kinetics ka was constraint to be 
greater than ke (ke=CL/V2). BW allometric scaling was considered with estimated exponents. Since 
two formulations were used tablet for adolescent and granules for children, relative bioavailability (F1) 
was fixed for the granule formulation based on the results from Study M17-142. 
PK parameters were estimated with good precision for both fixed and random effects (RSE <30%), 
except for V3/F (RSE of 42.1%). CL/F and V2/F IIV were moderate 64.4% and 45.9% (CV%). CL/F 
and V2 was highly correlated (>0.91) and this was accounted with an omega block. Eta-shrinkage was 
particularly low <10%. RUV modelled as a proportional error model was estimated at 0.236 (variance) 
which turns to 48.5% suggests a refinement of the PPK model. GOF plots were provided without any 
local regression line to allow easy detection of potential misspecification. A pcVPC was provided, 
showing that the model adequately represents the observed data in the paediatric population. 
The applicant concludes that the model fit for purpose, which is partially endorsed. 
In both PPK models the non-linearity PK behaviour for each compound was not handled, this remains 
the critical issue which hampers the reliability of the results from the simulation exercise. Indeed 
overall simulated AUC24 appears clearly under-predicted compared to the observed AUC24 (estimated 
by NCA) for GLE and PIB.  
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 48/83 
 
 
 
 
An update of both PPK models was requested in order to solve the raised issues (dose non-linearity, 
flip-flop kinetics, inadequate structural PK model, estimation of relative bioavailability…), however even 
if significant efforts were provided, the PPK models were not updated, therefore results from the 
simulation exercise are still not considered reliable.  
Consequently, the PK similarity based on exposures between children and adult/adolescent, claimed in 
the SmPC cannot be endorsed. Additional data were requested particularly, boxplots of the observed 
exposure metrics (AUC, Cmax and Cmin) in the paediatric population (Cohort 2, 3 and 4) and those 
from adolescents (Cohort 1) and adults, and their associated tables. These boxplots were provided 
(Figure 12 to Figure 14), without the associated tables. 
In the three paediatric age cohorts (Cohort 2, 3, and 4), observed Cmin distribution fell within the 
predicted Cmin distribution in adults for both compounds. It should be noted that median observed   
Cmin appears for both compounds particularly increased in Cohort 2 compared to all other groups. The 
same comments can be made for AUC0-24 for both compounds. 
In the three paediatric age cohort (Cohort 2, 3, and 4), observed Cmax distribution fell within the 
predicted Cmax distribution in adolescent (Cohort 1) for both compounds. It should be noted that 
median observed Cmax appears for both compounds slightly increased compared to adults. 
Therefore, for cohort 2 only, both Cmin and Cmax for both compounds are increased compared to 
adults suggesting that a reduced dose would have been more suitable. However as shown in Study 
M16-23 (initial phase) where tested dose of GLE/PIB of 200/75 mg were investigated in cohort 2, 
observed AUC0-24 is for both compounds approximately 20% decreased compared to the AUC0-24 
targets of adults. And since efficacy should be promote and presently observed (no virological failure) 
without no major safety concerns at the tested doses in all three cohorts, the applicant’s proposal in 
the SmPC that “exposures of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in children aged 3 to < 12 years fell within 
the efficacious exposure range in adults from Phase 2/3 studies” in the SmPC can be considered 
acceptable.  
More importantly it was predicted than more than 25% of the patients will fell below the 0.5XAUC24 
target of 2400 ng.h/mL for GLE and less than 15% for PIB and this is a source of particular concern for 
GLE, since HCV resistance development should be avoided. However, according to the applicant none 
of the 5 paediatric subjects, for which observed AUC24 was below this target, experienced a virological 
failure. 
2.4.4.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
Exposure expressed as AUC0-24 of GLE and PIB in paediatric patients aged 3-<12 years, receiving the 
paediatric commercial formulation following a weight-based dose regimen has been estimated by 
intensive PK in 29 patients using a NCA and a PopPK approach. Due to the non-linear PK behavior of 
both compounds, both methods have limitations to conclude on PK similarity solely on AUC0-24 
between children (3-<12 years) and, adolescents (12-<18 years) or adults (>=18 years). Additional 
exposure metrics as Cmin and Cmax were generally similar compared to those from adults and fells 
within the efficacious exposure range of adults.  The proposed weight-based dose for GLE/PIB can be 
considered acceptable.

Steps of assessment of M16-123 in paediatric patients 
The first interim analysis occurred once all subjects participating in the IPK portion of Part 1 completed 
PT Week 12 or prematurely discontinued from the study. A second interim analysis occurred once all 
subjects in Part 1 completed PT Week 12 or prematurely discontinued from the study. Both analysis 
were assessed during the procedure of extension of the indication in adolescents (see Maviret Type 
II/12 variation). 
A third interim analysis occurred once all subjects participating in the IPK portion of Part 2 completed 
PT Week 12 or prematurely discontinued from the study. The data from these analyses were the basis 
of the current application.  
During the assessment review, the Applicant submitted within the response to the LoQ the fourth 
interim analysis that occurred once all subjects in Parts 1 and 2 completed PT Week 12 or prematurely 
discontinued the study.  
The final analysis will occur after all subjects have completed the study (through PT Week 144). 
Methods 
Study M16-123 is a Phase 2/3, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the PK, efficacy, and safety of 
GLE/PIB for 8, 12, or 16 weeks in HCV GT1 – GT6-infected paediatric subjects ≥ 3 to < 18 years of 
age, with or without compensated cirrhosis, with or without HIV-1 coinfection, who were either TN, TE 
to IFN with or without RBV, or TE with SOF plus RBV with or without pegIFN. 
The study was designed to enroll approximately 125 subjects to meet scientific, regulatory, and clinical 
objectives without enrolling an undue number of subjects in alignment with ethical considerations. 
The study is divided into 2 parts:  
Part 1 of the study allowed for enrollment of approximately 44 HCV GT1 – GT6-infected adolescent 
subjects into the ≥ 12 to < 18 years old age group who were willing to swallow the adult formulation 
of GLE/PIB (Cohort 1).  
Part 2 of the study allowed for enrollment of approximately 81 HCV GT1 – GT6-infected 
paediatric subjects divided into the ≥ 9 to < 12 (Cohort 2), ≥ 6 to < 9 (Cohort 3), and ≥ 3 to 
< 6 (Cohort 4) years old age groups. Subjects in Part 2 received the paediatric formulation 
of GLE + PIB.  
Each cohort was expected to enroll approximately 12 HCV-infected subjects in the IPK portions to 
adequately characterize the PK of a particular age group. In each cohort, subjects were enrolled first 
into the IPK portion, followed by the non-IPK safety/efficacy portion, with sparse PK sampling in all 
subjects. In Part 2, subjects in each age cohort were enrolled in parallel.

GT = genotype; PK = pharmacokinetic; PD = pharmacodynamic; PT Wk = Post-Treatment Week 
The paediatric study is a phase 2/3 non comparative study evaluating PK, safety and efficacy in TN or 
TE [prior IFN, RBV, or SOF exposure], with or without HIV-1 coinfection, without cirrhosis or with 
compensated cirrhosis. The overall design is acceptable. At the time of the study design development, 
no IFN-free regimens were approved in children less than 12 years. Exploration of further 
regimen/duration was deemed not warranted this paediatric population as the same duration and 
regimens used in adults were anticipated to be similarly successful in children as long as the drug 
exposures were comparable, which is agreed. 
In support of the current application to extend the indication of Maviret to children aged 3 years and 
older, the MAH is submitting the clinical data from the 3rd interim analysis of M16-123, which occurred 
once all subjects for the cohorts in Part 2 (3 to < 6 years old, 6 to < 9 years old, and 9 to < 12 years 
old) undergoing IPK analysis completed the Post-Treatment (PT) Week 12 or prematurely discontinued 
from the study (n=48). The approach of submitting paediatric extension on the basis of a paediatric 
study whose primary endpoint is PK exposure was agreed in the PIP in accordance with the feedback 
from EU experts calling for an accelerated access to DAA in children. 
However, the FDA recommended to include an expanded number of patients for safety and non-IPK 
cohorts were included in the paediatric study to fulfil FDA requirement. Those data are part of the 4th 
interim analysis. During the assessment of the procedure, this 4th interim analysis was made available 
and the Applicant submitted, in response to the LoQ, the study report which includes all efficacy/safety 
data from the non-IPK safety/efficacy portion, i.e on the full 3-<12 years age cohorts (n=80).

Treatments 
For the IPK portion of Part 2 of Study M16-123, the paediatric GLE and PIB coated granules were 
packaged separately (noted as "GLE + PIB") for administration to allow for dose adjustments to 
determine the final paediatric dose. The study drug was dosed based on body weight/age. The IPK 
portion of Part 2 of the study evaluated 2 dose ratios.  
The initial dose ratio of 40 mg/15 mg was determined based on modelling using available results from 
the bioavailability Study M17-142 that compared the paediatric formulation to the adult bilayer tablets, 
and the adolescent PK results from Part 1 of Study M16-123. An IPK analysis was then conducted on 
the initial dose ratio, which included 17 subjects dosed across the Part 2 age cohorts. After this initial 
IPK analysis and review of available efficacy and safety data, the doses of the paediatric formulation 
were then adjusted to the GLE + PIB 50 mg/20 mg final proposed dose ratio. The dose adjustments 
were made to ensure safe and efficacious exposures, while not exceeding those of the adult dose of 
300 mg/120 mg of GLE/PIB.  
The final proposed 50 mg/20 mg dose ratio of GLE/PIB was administered to a total of 30 subjects 
across all 3 age cohorts in the IPK portion of Part 2. 
Based on current modelling and available PK data at the completion of the IPK portion of Part 2, the 
above Final Proposed Doses (Table 21 below) of the paediatric formulation are the target doses for use 
in children < 12 years of age. The PK and clinical data will be used to confirm appropriate exposure in 
each of the ≥ 3 to < 12 years old age groups. 
Table 21. Glecaprevir and Pibrentasvir doses for the paediatric population 
The dosing instructions given to subjects and their caregivers specified mixing the granules with soft 
food. To be noted that the same GLE and PIB coated granules were co-filled into one sachet at the final 
paediatric dose ratio of 50 mg GLE + 20 mg PIB for administration in the non-IPK safety/efficacy 
portion of the study, for greater patient/care giver convenience.  
Treatment duration was 8, 12, or 16 weeks depending on HCV genotype, cirrhosis status, prior 
treatment experience, and geographical location in accordance with the use of GLE/PIB in adults.  
Overall, a paediatric formulation, comprised of coated granules of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in a 
sachet for oral administration has been developed for use in children from 3 to <12 years of age. While 
the children in the IPK part received GLE and PIB coated granules packaged separately, the same GLE 
and PIB coated granules were co-filled into one sachet for greater patient/care giver convenience and 
Assessment report

were further used in paediatric patients participating in non-IPK part of the study. The coated granules 
in sachet is the paediatric formulation that is proposed for children 3 to <12 years and is the subject of 
the current line extension. None of the children from the IPK part received the final co-packaged 
formulation but it is not anticipated to be of any concern insofar as the only difference is separated 
versus combined coated granules. 
A total of 18 children aged 3 to <12 years received the initial dose ratio of 40mg/15mg GLE/PIB that 
was determined on modeling and 30 received the adjusted paediatric dose ratio 50mg/20mg GLE/PIB, 
in the intensive PK portion of the study. Clinical data from these 48 paediatric patients from the IPK 
part of the study were the initial basis of the efficacy/safety demonstration to support the extension of 
the indication to children <12 years. Further children received the final paediatric dose ratio 50/20 mg 
GLE/PIB in the non-IPK part of the study. The 4th interim report including data from the non-IPK part 
was submitted during the assessment of the procedure. 
Treatment duration was the same as that recommended in adults.  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The primary endpoint was the steady state AUC values for GLE and PIB to be estimated by non-
compartmental analysis or population PK analysis including AUC at Week 2 in subjects with IPK 
samples and AUC in all subjects with or without IPK samples. 
The secondary endpoints were: 
● Cmax and clearance of GLE and PIB at Week 2; 
● The percentage of subjects with SVR12 by age group and overall (primary efficacy variable for the 
US FDA); 
● The percentage of subjects with on-treatment virologic failure (i.e., breakthrough or failure to 
suppress at EOT) by age group and overall; 
● The percentage of subjects with PT relapse by age group and overall; 
● The percentage of subjects with new HCV infection (i.e., reinfection) at any time up to the last study 
visit by age group and overall; 
● Assessment of palatability/acceptability of the paediatric formulation by age group and overall. 
Sample size 
It was planned to enrol a total of approximately 125 subjects into this study. The proposed sample size 
of 48 subjects (approximately 12 subjects for each age cohort) for IPK sampling (separate from 
sampling performed in subjects in Japan) was expected to adequately characterize the PK of GLE and 
PIB to enable dose selection in paediatric subjects. Approximately 10 subjects will undergo additional 
PK sampling to support characterization of GLE and PIB exposures in children from Japan. Additional 
subjects will be enrolled to reach the proposed total of 125 subjects to provide safety and efficacy 
information. As per the PIP agreement, EMA has required that a minimum of 9 patients are to be 
enrolled in each IPK age cohort. A total of 16 children in each 3 age bands (3-<6, 6-<9, 9-<12) were 
enrolled in the IPK portion part 2 of the study.

Results 
While in the 3rd interim report submitted in the initial application, 96 children were enrolled and 95 
received at least 1 dose of study drug (see D80 AR), data from the full cohort (IPK and non-IPK part, 
including 32 additional children aged 3 to <12 y.o) were subsequently available and are presented 
below: 
Disposition (4th interim report) 
A total of 129 subjects were enrolled and 127 subjects received at least 1 dose of study drug. One 
paediatric subject (Cohort 4) who received the initial dose prematurely discontinued study drug due to 
refusal to swallow the study drug granule formulation and one subject (Cohort 2) experienced a study 
drug related AE of rash erythematous.

Protocol amendments 
The original protocol (dated 15 December 2016; 27 subjects enrolled) was amended 6 times (3 global 
and 3 country-specific) and had 2 administrative changes. A total of 24 subjects were enrolled under 
Amendment 1 and 45 subjects were enrolled under Amendment 2, 31 subjects were enrolled under

Amendment 3. One additional subject was incorrectly entered in the clinical database as enrolled under 
Amendment 4, which was a site data entry error, and should have been entered as enrolled under 
Amendment 3. The protocol changes described in the amendments (inclusion of specific changes for 
Japanese patients, information in support of the proposed paediatric dosing, increased number of 
subjects to be enrolled from 110 to 125 subjects, due to change in dosing) did not affect the 
interpretation of the results in this study. 
Protocol deviations 
None of the deviations was considered to have affected the study outcome or interpretation of the study 
results or conclusions. 
Baseline data 
Demographics  and  baseline  disease  characteristics  of  the  study  population  in  Study  M16-123  are 
summarized the tables below.  
All subjects were non-cirrhotic and the majority of subjects were HCV GT1-infected. Only 2 adolescent 
subjects (Cohort 1) and 1 subject from Cohort 3 (paediatric) was HCV/HIV-1 coinfected.

Table 24: Baseline Disease Characteristics 
The paediatric population aged 3 to <12 years enrolled in cohort 2-4 mainly consisted in female 
(55%), white (69%) patients. While all children were enrolled in US (included Puerto Rico) or Canada 
for the IPK part, patients from other countries participated to the non-IPK part and overall Europe 
account for 26% of the 3-<12 y paediatric population included in the study (North America: 63% and 
Japan 11%).  
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 57/83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Most of the children were infected by HCV GT1 (72.5%), mainly GT1a. There were 18 patients with 
GT3 (22.5%), and 2 patients each with GT2 or GT4. As expected for a paediatric population, the 
children had a mild disease. None of the 80 children aged 3-<12 years had cirrhosis and all had F0-F1 
fibrosis, apart from 2 children who had fibrosis F2 (1 each in cohort 9-<12y and cohort 6-<9y). It 
would have been of interest to have baseline ALT value to appreciate the proportion of patients with 
active disease/elevated ALT. 
The baseline and disease characteristics between adolescents and paediatric patients <12 years were 
roughly comparable, besides a larger proportion of GT3 enrolled in part 2 (22.5% vs 8.5% in part 1). A 
larger proportion of GT3 patients is welcomed to assess the efficacy of Maviret in paediatric patients 
given GT3-infected patients were known to be harder to treat patients based on adult experience. All 
but 2 children 3-<12 y.o. were treatment-naïve and therefore were assigned to the 8 week treatment 
duration regimen as per EU SmPC. There were 2 children in the >9-<12y cohort who were IFN-
experienced. None had history of depression or bipolar disorders and none use concomitant PPI or 
statins. 
In the study, dosing was based on age. However, per inclusion criteria, subject must have a weight 
consistent with the recommended weight band for their age at the time of Screening. As a 
consequence, all but 1 children aged 3-<6 y.o weighed 12 to <20kg, all but 2 children aged 6-<9 y.o 
weighed 20-<30kg and all but 1 children in cohort 9 to <12 years weighted 30-<45kg. The dosing 
schedule proposed in the SmPC is based on weight, which is appropriate; weight-based dosing has 
been recognised on previous Hep C paediatric extension as a more adequate approach than age-based 
posology. In line with the clinical population included in the study, the lower limit weight cut-off is 
clearly mentioned.  
Because the formulations have different pharmacokinetic profiles, the tablets and the coated granules 
are not interchangeable. This is mentioned in section 4.2 and has also been detailed in section 5.2. 
Outcomes and estimation 
As a reminder, In Part 1 (adolescent), three GT3-infected, TE and noncirrhotic subjects were assigned 
to 16 weeks of GLE/PIB treatment; the remaining 44 subjects were assigned to 8 weeks of treatment 
per protocol.  
Sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment was achieved by 100% (47/47) of subjects in 
the ITT population. 
Cohorts 2 – 4 Paediatric Subjects ≥ 3 to < 12 Years of Age 
All but 2 were TN and were assigned to 8 weeks of treatment per protocol. The two IFN-experienced 
patients from the >9-<12 years cohort were treated one with a 12w regimen and the other with a 16w 
regimen (according to the local labelling recommendation). 
In the third interim report, sustained virologic response 12 weeks post-treatment was achieved by 
95.8% (46/48) of paediatric subjects in the ITT population. In the full cohort, SVR was achieved by 
96.3% (77/80) of paediatric subjects in the ITT population. 
Three subjects were considered SVR12 non-responders: 
- 
one due to virologic failure (relapse by PT Week 12)  
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 58/83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
A 9-year-old, TN male infected with GT 3b in Cohort 2 relapsed by PT Week 4. The subject received the 
initial dose ratio (GLE 200 mg + PIB 75 mg) QD for 8 weeks. The subject had HCV RNA < 15 IU/mL at 
Treatment Day 26 with no HCV RNA detected at Treatment Day 56; at PT Day 29, HCV RNA was 
detected. Study drug was completed and there were no reports of non-compliance. Palatability results 
show successful administration of the coated granules formulation. This subject had no baseline 
polymorphism or treatment-emergent substitutions in nonstructural viral protein 3 (NS3), and had 
K30R and V31M in nonstructural viral protein 5A (NS5A) at baseline and treatment-emergent 
substitution Y93H in NS5A at the time of failure.  
- 
two due to non-virologic reasons. 
One paediatric subject (Cohort 4, 40/15mg ratio), a 3-year-old TN male infected with GT 3a, was 
enrolled and partially dosed on Treatment Day 1; the subject refused to swallow the entire dose and 
then discontinued from the study on Treatment Day 1. There is no HCV RNA data available for this 
subject after Treatment Day 1. 
The other paediatric subject (Cohort 2, 50/20mg ratio), an 11-year-old TN female with HCV GT1b 
infection, experienced rash erythematous on Treatment Day 1 which was considered by the 
investigator as having a reasonable possibility of being study drug related. The subject discontinued 
study drug on Treatment Day 4. 
No paediatric subject who received the final dose ratio experienced virologic failure. 
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 59/83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Overall, the SVR rate in children was high (96.3%), in line with results observed with Maviret in 
adolescents and in adults. Only 1 child relapsed; the child had pejorative GT3b genotype and received 
a lower than the final recommended dose/ratio. A non virological failure was also reported in a 3 years 
old child who refused to swallow the entire dose (of note, there were 10 children of 3 years of age 
successfully treated in the study). No other major palatability concerns were reported in this study and 
the children overall well accepted the granules formulation despite some resistance to taste and 
texture (see safety). The other non-virological failure pertains to a child who prematurely discontinued 
treatment due to occurrence of rash erythematous on treatment D1 that was considered as possibly 
drug related (see safety part). 
To be noted that 2/3 non responders received the initial 40/15mg ratio dose. The MAH initially 
proposed to reflect in section 5.1 of the SmPC only the results for patients receiving the final 
recommended dose. However, as requested by the CHMP, the virological failure reported in the 
apparent compliant GT3b child with pejorative mutation at baseline who received the initial lower dose 
has also been reflected. 
Efficacy Subgroup Analyses 
The number and percentage of subjects with SVR12 were analyzed by demographic and baseline 
characteristics. Overall, there was an SVR12 rate of 100% among all subjects in Cohort 1 and 96.3% 
in Cohorts 2 – 4 (ITT population). 
In Cohorts 2 – 4, the ITT SVR12 rates were 88.9% (16/18) for subjects who received the initial 40 
mg/15 mg dose ratio and 95.8% (23/24) for the GLE 250 mg + PIB 100 mg dose, 100% (21/21) for 
the GLE 200 mg + PIB 80 mg dose, and 100% (17/17) for the GLE 150 mg + PIB 60 mg dose. 
As only 1 subject, on the initial 40 mg/15 mg dose ratio, exhibited virologic failure, no negative 
baseline predictors/trends could be identified, including demographics, baseline HCV RNA level, 
genotype, presence of baseline polymorphisms in NS3 and/or NS5A, or common comorbidities. 
Thus, among the 62 children aged 3-<12 years old who received the final 50/20mg dose ratio, none 
experienced virological failure. 
A 9 years old subject (29.6kg) from Cohort 2 was dosed with 200 mg/75 mg initial dose. Estimated 
GLE and PIB AUC24 by NCA approach were 1780 ng.h/mL and 903 ng.h/mL, respectively. In this 
cohort with the tested dose it should be noted that, for GLE, 4 out of 6 (including this 9 year old 
subject) was below the 0.5xAUC24 adult target of 2400 ng.h/mL and for PIB 1 out of 6 (excluding this 
9 year old subject) was below the 0.5XAUC24 adult target of 715 ng.h/mL. Therefore GLE or PIB 
AUC24 level cannot explain such relapse.

Ancillary analyses 
Baseline polymorphisms in NS3 were not detected at amino acid positions 155, 156, or 168 in any of 
the 124 HCV GT1 – GT4-infected subjects with available sequence. The prevalence of NS3 Q80K in 
GT1a-infected subjects was high. 
Baseline polymorphisms at amino acid positions 24, 28, 30, 31, 58, 92, or 93 in NS5A were detected in 
23.2% (29/125) of the HCV GT1 – GT4-infected subjects with available sequence. A30K/T and Y93H in 
NS5A were each detected in 10.5% (2/19) and 5.3% (1/19) of the HCV GT3a-infected subjects, 
respectively. One of the 2 HCV GT3b infected subjects experienced virologic failure. The subject 
experiencing virologic failure (Cohort 2) had no baseline polymorphism or treatment emergent 
substitutions in NS3 and had K30R and V31M in NS5A at baseline and treatment-emergent substitution 
Y93H in NS5A at the time of failure. All other subjects in the mITT-VF population achieved SVR12 and 
there was no evidence that baseline polymorphisms had an impact on treatment outcome. 
To be noted that the only child who experienced virological failure had GT3b infection and was of Asian 
origin. Prevalence of GT3b is very low in Europe (<1%). In this study, conducted in US and Canada, 2 
children with GT3b were however included. Phase III studies conducted in China already showed that 
Maviret had lower efficacy in GT3b adult patients as compared to GT3a due to the presence of 
naturally occurring K30 and M31 in NS5A with reduced susceptibility to PIB. This has been reflected in 
the SmPC (following Maviret Var II/26). Even though the GT3b child received the initial lower dose of 
Maviret, this virological failure has also been highlighted in the paediatric paragraph in section 5.1 
In the remaining children, baseline polymorphism had no impact on treatment outcome in this interim 
analysis. 
2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Study M16-123 is a Phase 2/3, open label study conducted in paediatric patients from 3 to <18 years 
of age. Part 1 of the study enrolled 47 HCV GT1 – GT6-infected adolescent subjects into the ≥ 12 to < 
18 years old age group who were willing to swallow the adult formulation of GLE/PIB (Cohort 1). On 
the basis of these data, the indication of Maviret were extended in adolescents. 
Part 2 of the study enrolled 80 HCV GT1 – GT6-infected paediatric subjects divided into the ≥ 9 to < 12 
(Cohort 2, n=29), ≥ 6 to < 9 (Cohort 3, n=27), and ≥ 3 to < 6 (Cohort 4, n=24) years old age groups. 
Subjects in Part 2 receive the paediatric formulation of GLE + PIB.  
The overall design is acceptable. At the time of the study design development, no IFN-free regimens 
were approved in children less than 12 years. Exploration of further regimen/duration in children was 
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 61/83 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
deemed not warranted as the same duration and regimens used in adults were anticipated to be 
similarly successful in children as long as the drug exposures were comparable. 
In support of its request to extend the indication of Maviret in children from 3 years of age, the 
Applicant initially provided the interim data of study M16-123 including the PK, efficacy and safety 
from the 48 children aged 3 to <12 years included in the Intensive PK part of the study. In its 
response to the LoQ, the Applicant further provided the 4th interim report of study M16-123 including 
the data up to W12 post-treatment of all children included in the study.  
All children aged 3 to <12 years old were treatment-naïve and received 8 weeks GLE/PIB duration as 
recommended in adults, except 2 IFN-experienced children who received 12 or 16w regimen 
(according to their local labelling recommendation). None had cirrhosis (or advanced fibrosis). The 
majority (72.5%) were infected by GT1 but 18 (22.5%) had GT3 infection.  
The initial dose ratio of 40mg/15mg GLE/PIB that was determined on modelling and was received by 
18 children (1 patient discontinued early); then 62 children received the adjusted paediatric dose ratio 
50mg/20mg GLE/PIB (1 patient discontinued early). While the children in the IPK part received GLE 
and PIB coated granules packaged separately, the same GLE and PIB coated granules were co-filled 
into one sachet for greater patient/care giver convenience and were further used in paediatric patients 
participating in non-IPK part of the study. The coated granules in sachet is the commercial paediatric 
formulation that is proposed for children 3 to <12 years and is the subject of the current line 
extension.  
SVR12 was achieved by 77/80 (96.3%) of paediatric subjects in the ITT population. A 9-year-old, TN 
male infected with GT3b, relapsed. This patient received the lower initial dose ratio (GLE 200 mg + PIB 
75 mg) QD for 8 weeks. In adults, Maviret has been shown to have lower efficacy in GT3b patients 
(prevalent in Asian region) due to the presence of naturally occurring K30 and M31 in NS5A with 
reduced susceptibility to PIB; this has been reflected in the SmPC. The virological failure reported in 
this study in the GT3b child has also been reflected in section 5.1 even though he received the initial 
lower dose. 
Moreover, 2 patients were non-responder due to non-virologic reason: a 3-year-old TN male refused to 
swallow the entire dose and then discontinued from the study on Treatment Day 1. No other 
palatability concerns were reported in this study and the children overall well took the granule 
formulation. An 11-year-old TN female with HCV GT1b infection, experienced rash erythematous on 
Treatment Day 1 which was considered by the investigator as having a reasonable possibility of being 
study drug related and discontinued study drug on Treatment Day 4. 
The MAH requests the extension of the approved indication in adult and adolescent to children from 3 
years of age, whatever the genotypes, TN or TE (DAA-naïve) status, presence or not of cirrhosis or HIV 
co-infection.  
There is no obvious reason that the efficacy would differ between children and adults or adolescents as 
long as there is no concern of too low exposure. As a reassuring finding, there were 15 children with 
GT3a infection and all achieved SVR.  
A weight-based posology is proposed in the SmPC for children, which is appropriate. The lower limit 
weight cut-off is clearly mentioned in the SmPC for the coated granule and it has been made clear that 
children who are less than 12 years old but who weigh at least 45 kg should take the tablet. It has 
been agreed upon that adolescents (regardless of weight) should take the tablet.

2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
The SVR rate of 96.3% in the 80 children aged >3-<12 years old from study M16-123 support the use 
of Maviret in children from 3 years of age. 
2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
The safety population comprises 47 adolescents in Cohort 1 (Part 1) and 80 paediatric patients in 
Cohorts 2 to 4 (Part 2). 
The safety data derived from the Part 1 of the study in adolescents have already been provided and 
assessed as part of the type II Variation II/0012 of Maviret and will not be further discussed in this 
report. 
All paediatric subjects in Cohorts 2 – 4 were within 3 to < 12 years of age. There were 44 females 
(55%) and 36 males (45%) and were white in majority. They were all non-cirrhotic and all but 2 were 
naïve of treatment. HCV genotype was G3 in 18 subjects (22.5%), G1 in 58 subjects (72.5%) and G4 
in 5 subjects. There was 1 HCV/HIV co-infected subject. 
All but 2 were treated with Maviret for 8 weeks (the 2 TE patients were treated with Maviret 12 or 16 
weeks according to their local labelling recommendation). 
The 18 first included paediatric subjects received the initial 40mg/15mg dose ratio. After an initial PK 
analysis and review of efficacy and safety data, the other 62 subjects received the final 50mg/20mg 
dose ratio.

Overall, 23 (28.8%) paediatric subjects across Cohorts 2 – 4 experienced study drug-related AEs. The 
most frequently reported ADRs for paediatric subjects (reported in ≥ 5% subjects overall) were 
fatigue, headache and vomiting. 
The majority of paediatric subjects who experienced AEs across cohorts 2-4 combined (73.7%; 42/57) 
had AEs with a maximum severity of Grade 1 (mild). One subject prematurely discontinued study drug 
on Treatment Day 4 due to a non-serious Grade 3 AE, which was considered study-drug related by the 
investigator. An 11-year-old female subject, experienced rash erythematous on Treatment Day 1. The 
event resolved with cessation of study drug and treatment with cetirizine. No other paediatric subjects 
experienced a treatment-emergent Grade 3 AE or higher. A 9-year-old male subject, experienced a 
non-serious AE of respiratory tract infection on Treatment Day 29, which led to a brief interruption of

study drug. The event was considered not study-drug related by the investigator and the subject 
resumed study drug after 4 days. 
Of note, paediatric subjects in cohort 2-4 experienced more drug-related AEs than adolescent in Cohort 
1 (28.8% vs 19.1%). Diarrhoea, nausea and vomiting occurred at a slightly higher frequency in 
paediatric subjects compared to adolescents (adverse reactions: 3.8% vs. 0%, 3.8% vs. 0%, and 
7.5% vs. 2.1% respectively). Regarding gastrointestinal symptoms, this trend is also observed 
whatever the relatedness with study drug. They were mostly reported in children aged 3 to <9 years 
old. 
Even though those AEs are generally mild to moderate and did not lead to treatment discontinuation, 
the Applicant was requested to update section 4.8 to reflect this differential in terms of frequency of 
gastrointestinal disorders between paediatric and adolescents, for which a consistent trend is observed 
between paediatric and adolescent whatever the assessment of causality. The SmPC has been revised 
accordingly.   
Four children in cohorts 2-4 experienced treatment-related rash, of which 1 grade 3 AE leading to 
treatment discontinuation. Although there is no obvious qualitative or quantitative difference between 
Maviret tablets or granules formulation that could explain occurrence of rash in children, the MAH has 
been requested to discuss the occurrence of treatment-related rash in children. Detailed information on 
the cases of drug-related rash were provided. Alternative aetiology or confounding factors were 
identified for 2 children. All cases were non serious and, except the case leading to study drug 
discontinuation, resolved without Maviret discontinuation. All occurred in children aged from 7 to 11-
years old with no events reported in younger children. Moreover, no signal was identified for 
adolescent and adults in the recent review assessed by the PRAC. There is insufficient evidence for a 
causal association between Maviret and rash in paediatric patient at this stage. This issue will continue 
to be closely monitored in PSURs. 
As this could be expected due to the higher dosage, paediatric subjects who received the higher final 
dose ratio 50mg/20mg had more AEs than those receiving the initial dose 40mg/15mg (75.8% vs 
55.5%).  
Serious adverse events and deaths 
No treatment-emergent SAE and no deaths were reported during the study. In the post-treatment 
period, one 5-year-old female paediatric subject in Cohort 4 experienced a non-treatment emergent 
SAE of osteomyelitis of the hip and pelvic bone on post-treatment Day 171 which was not considered 
related to study drug by the investigator (event occurring around 6 months after the end of study 
treatment). 
No hepatic decompensation/hepatic failures were reported. 
No post-baseline HCC events were reported 
Patients with current HBV co-infection (subjects with positive hepatitis B surface antigen) were 
excluded from the clinical trial.  There were no cases of HBV reactivation reported. 
Laboratory findings 
With the exception of a mean reduction from baseline in alanine aminotransferase (ALT) associated 
with clearance of HCV infection, no clinically meaningful mean changes in haematology, chemistry, or 
urinalysis parameters from baseline to each study visit were observed. 
One subject in Cohort 4 (paediatric) had a single Grade 3 low neutrophil count on Treatment Day 14 
that returned to within reference range by Treatment Day 32; the subject's neutrophil count remained 
within reference range at all other Treatment Period and PT period visits. The single Grade 3 low 
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021

neutrophil count was not considered clinically significant and was not reported as an AE. No other 
subjects had a Grade 3/4 haematology or chemistry value that worsened in grade compared with 
baseline grade during the Treatment Period. 
No subjects had hepatic laboratory values of specific interest. 
No clinically important trends in growth and development outcomes results were observed. 
Safety in special populations 
No pregnancies were reported during the study 
Safety related to drug-drug interactions and other interactions 
No new data applicable to this submission 
One subject prematurely discontinued study drug due to a non-serious Grade 3 AE. An 11-year-old 
female, experienced a non-serious Grade 3 AE of rash erythematous on Treatment Day 1 which was 
considered as having a reasonable possibility of being study drug related. The subject discontinued the 
study drug on Treatment Day 4. The event resolved with cessation of study drug and treatment with 
cetirizine. No other subjects reported an AE leading to premature study drug discontinuation. 
One paediatric subject (Cohort 4) prematurely discontinued study drug due to refusal to swallow the 
study drug pellet formulation. No subjects discontinued therapy due to taste. 
Palatability 
For each subject who took the paediatric formulation (Cohorts 2 – 4), the parent(s)/guardian(s) of the 
subject completed a Palatability Questionnaire to provide feedback on the perception of the dosage 
form. The questionnaire was completed by 77 subjects at Week 2, 68 subjects at Week 8, and 78 
subjects at the Final Treatment Visit. Subjects did report a dislike for the taste (82.4%) or the texture 
(52.9%) of the medicine. Despite some resistance to taste and texture, most subjects reported 
successful administration of the whole dose with soft food (75.3%). Furthermore, most subjects 
reported that they took the dose within 5 minutes or less (84.6%). 
Post marketing experience 
There are no post-marketing data available for GLE/PIB in paediatric subjects <12 years old, as it is 
not currently indicated for use in this patient population. 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Overall, no major safety concern was identified in the paediatric subjects treated with the coated 
granules in a sachet dosed 50mg/20mg of GLE/PIB during this study. The main reported AEs were 
headache, vomiting and diarrhoea. Overall, those AEs were mild to moderate and were not associated 
with treatment discontinuation. However, as compared to adolescent, the frequency of gastrointestinal 
AEs tends to be higher in paediatric population, suggesting that Maviret coated granules has been 
overall less well tolerated in children than the film coated tablets in adolescents. This has been 
reflected in section 4.8.  
Four children in cohorts 2-4 experienced treatment-related rash, of which 1 grade 3 AE leading to 
treatment discontinuation. Alternative aetiology or cofounding factors were identified for 2 children. All 
cases were non serious and, except the case leading to study drug discontinuation, resolved without 
Maviret discontinuation. All occurred in children aged from 7 to 11-years old with no events reported in 
younger children. Moreover, no signal was identified for adolescent and adults in the recent review 
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021 
Page 66/83 
 
 
 
 
assessed by the PRAC. There is insufficient evidence for a causal association between Maviret and rash 
in paediatric patient at this stage. This issue will continue to be closely monitored in PSURs. 
The observed AUC24 in the paediatric population appears 1.2-1.8-fold greater for GLE and 1.06-1.6-
fold greater for PIB than the adult target. Even though there was no major safety signal in the 
paediatric study, there is currently a limited clinical experience in paediatric patients. Paediatric 
patients will be discussed through a dedicated section in future PSUR. 
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety dataset of use of Maviret in paediatric subjects relies on 80 children aged from 3 to <12 
years of age. Maviret has showed to have an overall favourable safety profile in this patient population 
with no severe AEs, no serious treatment-emergent AE. One child discontinued treatment due to 
occurrence of drug-related rash erythematous. The safety profile of GLE/PIB observed in children was 
overall consistent in nature with that reported in adults and adolescents. However, higher frequencies 
of gastrointestinal disorders have been reported in paediatric subjects, which has been reflected in the 
product information. 
Cases of treatment-related rash, of which 1 grade 3 AE leading to treatment discontinuation, were 
reported in 4 children but there is insufficient evidence of a causal relationship with Maviret at this 
stage. This issue will continue to be closely monitored.  
Furthermore, the safety in paediatric patients will be discussed through a dedicated section in future 
PSURs.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
Hepatitis C viral infection is a global health problem, with over 71 million individuals chronically 
infected worldwide. In a recent systematic review, an estimated 13.2 million children aged 1 – 15 
years are infected with chronic HCV, globally. 
Within the US and Europe's paediatric population, the prevalence of HCV in children and adolescents 
ranges from 0.05% to 0.36%. New HCV infections among the 0 to 4 year-old age group constituted 
0.4% of all new infections in EU/EEA during 2016, 5 – 14 year-olds 0.3%, and 15 – 19 year-olds 1.3%, 
equating to a rate of infection of 0.55, 0.21, and 1.92 per 100,000, respectively. 
Within the paediatric population (< 18 years of age), mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) during the 
perinatal period is the most common reason for paediatric HCV infection, accounting for 60% of cases. 
The remaining paediatric/adolescent cases, acquired after the perinatal period, are attributable to 
intra-familial transmission and high risk behaviours such as intravenous drug abuse 
There are 6 major HCV GTs, with prevalence varying by geographic region. Among the European 
paediatric population (≤ 14 years old) who tested positive for HCV between 2011 and 2015, genotype 
distribution was as follows: 15% GT1 (where not subtyped), 26.3% GT1a, 21.3% GT1b, 3.8% GT2, 
18.8% GT3, 13.8% GT4, 1.3% GT5, and 0% GT6. The HCV genotype distribution in the paediatric 
population is similar to the HCV genotype pattern in adults. 
Although the majority of children have a mild disease and do not need urgent treatment, advanced 
liver disease has been reported in children as young as 3 years of age.  Disease progression also may 
occur many years after the initial infection. Guidance published by the Hepatology Committee of the 
European Society for Paediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition (ESPGHAN) in 2018 
recommends that all children with chronic HCV infection should be considered for treatment,

considering that the rationale underlying the indications for treatment of adults with chronic infection is 
also valid for children. Guidance published by ESPGHAN also recommends that all children aged 3 to 17 
years with chronic HCV infection may be considered candidates for treatment, and should be 
considered for treatment if they develop consistently elevated serum aminotransferase levels or liver 
fibrosis. 
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
Current approved treatment options for children aged 3 years and older remain limited although 
expanding. Recently, ledipasvir (LDV)/SOF and SOF + RBV have been approved for use (CHMP positive 
opinion on 30 April 2020), but they are not pangenotypic IFN-free and the recommended regimen for 
HCV GT2 and GT3 infection require co-administration with RBV. Moreover, during the assessment of 
this procedure, Epclusa received EU approval for an extension of the indication in children from 6 years 
of age.  
3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
This current application for an extension of the indication to children aged 3 years and older is 
supported by new clinical data from part 2 of Study M16-123 [An Open-Label, Multicenter Study to 
Evaluate the Pharmacokinetics, Safety, and Efficacy of Glecaprevir/Pibrentasvir for 8, 12, or 16 weeks 
in HCV GT1 – GT6-infected paediatric subjects 3 to < 18 years of age (DORA)]. 
A paediatric formulation, comprised of coated granules of glecaprevir and pibrentasvir in a sachet for 
oral administration has been developed for use in children from 3 to <12 years of age. While the 
children in the IPK part received GLE and PIB coated granules packaged separately, the same GLE and 
PIB coated granules were co-filled into one sachet for greater patient/care giver convenience. This 
formulation was used in the non-IPK part and is the to-be marketed formulation. 
Part 1 of the study evaluated the use of the adult bilayer tablets in adolescents (Cohort 1) and has 
been previously submitted and assessed to support the extension of the indication in paediatric 
patients from 12 years of age. Part 2 of the study is evaluating the use of the paediatric coated 
granules formulation of GLE + PIB in children 3 to < 12 years of age (Cohorts 2 – 4). In each cohort, 
subjects are enrolled first into the intensive pharmacokinetic (IPK) portion, followed by the non-IPK 
safety/efficacy portion. 
Initially, the Applicant provided interim data including the PK, efficacy and safety from the 48 children 
aged 3 to <12 years included in the Intensive PK part of the study. During the assessment review, the 
Applicant submitted within the response to the LoQ the fourth interim analysis of study M16-523 that 
occurred once all subjects in Parts 1 and 2 completed PT Week 12 or prematurely discontinued the 
study.  
All children aged 3-<12 years old were treatment-naïve and received 8 weeks GLE/PIB duration as 
recommended in adults, except 2 IFN-experienced children who received 12 or 16w regimen 
(according to their local labelling recommendation). None had cirrhosis (or advanced fibrosis). The 
majority (72.5%) were infected by GT1 but 18 (22.5%) had GT3 infection. 
The initial dose ratio of 40mg/15mg GLE/PIB that was determined on modelling and was received by 
18 children (1 patient discontinued early); then 62 children received the adjusted paediatric dose ratio 
50mg/20mg GLE/PIB (1 patient discontinued early). While the children in the IPK part received GLE 
and PIB coated granules packaged separately, the same GLE and PIB coated granules were co-filled 
into one sachet for greater patient/care giver convenience and were further used in paediatric patients

participating in non-IPK part of the study. The coated granules in sachet is the commercial paediatric 
formulation that is proposed for children 3 to <12 years and is the subject of the current line extension 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
SVR12 was achieved by 77/80 (96.3%) of paediatric subjects in the ITT population.  
A 9-year-old, TN male infected with GT 3b, relapsed. This patient received the lower initial dose ratio 
(GLE 200 mg + PIB 75 mg) QD for 8 weeks; in adults, Maviret has been shown to have lower efficacy 
in GT3b patients (prevalent in Asian region) due to the presence of naturally occurring K30 and M31 in 
NS5A with reduced susceptibility to PIB; this has been reflected in the SPC. Whether the relapse is 
linked to under-exposure or pejorative mutations at baseline is not known but the failure with 
emergence of Y93H in this GT3b child is a cause for concern and has been highlighted in the SPC. 
Moreover, 2 patients were non-responders due to non-virologic reason: a 3-year-old TN male refused 
to swallow the entire dose and then discontinued from the study on Treatment Day 1. No other 
palatability concerns were reported in this study and the children overall took the granule formulation 
well. An 11-year-old TN female with HCV GT1b infection, experienced rash erythematous on Treatment 
Day 1 which was considered by the investigator as having a reasonable possibility of being study drug 
related and discontinued study drug on Treatment Day 4. 
GT1 was mainly represented in the study population but a non-negligible proportion of GT3 were 
enrolled in the study. Moreover, even though the children aged from 3 to <12 years in this study had a 
mild disease, as expected from a paediatric population, PK data support the extrapolation from adults 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
The observed AUC24 in the paediatric population appears 1.2-1.8-fold greater for GLE and 1.06-1.6-
fold greater for PIB than the adult target. However, it should be noted that no major safety signal was 
observed, and the efficacy endpoint (SVR12) was observed in all but 3 patients (including only 1 
virologic failure).  
A population PK analysis was developed for each GLE and PIB compound from which a simulation 
exercise was performed to support the comparability of exposure between adult and paediatric patients 
with the claimed weight-based dosing regimen. Overall, the applicant claimed that both PPK models 
are fit for purpose which is not endorsed particularly for the GLE PPK model. Indeed, in both PPK 
models the non-linearity PK behavior for each compound was not handled, this remains the critical 
issue which hampers the reliability of the results from the simulation exercise. Overall simulated 
AUC24 appears clearly under-predicted compared to the observed AUC24 (estimated by NCA) for GLE 
and PIB.  
Based on these PK results (without modelling & simulation), the applicant claimed weight –based 
dosing regimen can be supported. However, since results from the simulation exercise are not 
considered reliable, the PK similarity based solely on AUC0-24 of GLE/PIB between children and 
adult/adolescent, as claimed by the Applicant in the SmPC was not endorsed. Additional PK data 
comparison (Cmin and Cmax) between populations were requested and showed that only one cohort of 
pediatric patients (9-<12 years) appears to be slightly over-exposed compared to adults.  
Finally, given there is no data in adults using the granule formulation and in the light of the lack of 
interchangeability, the indication (section 4.1) has been revised to make it clear that the granule 
formulation is only indicated in paediatric patients from 3 years of age. 
Assessment report  
EMA/372473/2021  
Page 79/83 
 
 
 
 
Of note, the tablet formulation SmPC indicated in adults and adolescents is now also indicated in 
children from 3 years of age to take into account the fact that children weighing at least 45kg could 
take the tablet. However, section 4.2 clearly specified that Maviret tablet is intended for children 
weighing at least 45kg and that Maviret coated granule formulation is intended for children aged 3 to 
less than 12 years weighing 12 kg to less than 45 kg. 
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
The safety profile of GLE/PIB observed in children was overall consistent in nature with that reported in 
adults and adolescents. However, the frequency of gastrointestinal disorders tends to be higher in 
paediatric subjects, which has been reflected in the product information. Moreover, 4 children in 
cohorts 2-4 experienced treatment-related rash, of which 1 grade 3 AE leading to treatment 
discontinuation. However, there is insufficient evidence of a causal relationship with Maviret based on 
these cases.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
The observed AUC24 in the paediatric population appears 1.2-1.8-fold greater for GLE and 1.06-1.6-
fold greater for PIB than the adult target. Even though there was no major safety signal in the 
paediatric study, there is currently a limited clinical experience in paediatric patients. The safety in 
paediatric patients will be discussed through a dedicated section in future PSURs.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
Considering the natural course of chronic HCV infection, use of Maviret in children is associated with a 
very high cure rate without significant safety concern; overall, the favourable effects clearly outweigh 
the unfavourable effects. 
A weight-based posology is proposed in the SmPC for children, which is appropriate. The lower limit 
weight cut-off is clearly mentioned in the SmPC for the coated granules and it has been made it clear 
in section 4.2 that children who are less than 12 years old but who weigh at least 45 kg should take 
the tablet. It has already been agreed upon that adolescents (regardless of weight) should take the 
tablet. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The proposed dosing regimen does not raise major issues and the efficacy and safety data in children 3 
years and older reported are overall acceptable. 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The overall B/R of Maviret in children 3 years and older is positive.

4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that 
the benefit-risk balance of Maviret 50 mg / 20 mg coated granules in sachet is favourable in the following 
indication: 
Maviret  coated  granules  is  indicated  for  the  treatment  of  chronic  hepatitis  C  virus  (HCV)  infection  in 
children 3 years and older (see sections 4.2, 4.4. and 5.1).  
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension(s) of the marketing authorisation for Maviret subject to 
the following conditions: 
Conditions or restrictions regarding supply and use 
Medicinal  product  subject  to  restricted  medical  prescription  (see  Annex  I:  Summary  of  Product 
Characteristics, section 4.2). 
Conditions and requirements of the marketing authorisation  
Periodic Safety Update Reports  
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set out 
in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 2001/83/EC 
and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
Conditions  or  restrictions  with  regard  to  the  safe  and  effective  use  of  the 
medicinal product 
Risk Management Plan (RMP) 
The MAH shall perform the required pharmacovigilance activities and interventions detailed in the agreed 
RMP presented in Module 1.8.2 of the marketing authorisation and any agreed subsequent updates of 
the RMP. 
An updated RMP should be submitted: 
•  At the request of the European Medicines Agency; 
•  Whenever the risk management system is modified, especially as the result of new information 
being received that may lead to a significant change to the benefit/risk profile or as the result 
of an important (pharmacovigilance or risk minimisation) milestone being reached.  
Obligation to conduct post-authorisation measures 
The MAH shall complete, within the stated timeframe, the below measures:

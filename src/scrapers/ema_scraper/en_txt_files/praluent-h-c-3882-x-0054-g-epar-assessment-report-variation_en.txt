for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
2.1.2.  Epidemiology  
No new data were submitted in this application. 
2.1.3.  Management 
About the product 
Alirocumab is a fully human monoclonal IgG1 (immunoglobulin G1) antibody that binds to Proprotein 
convertase sutililisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). PCSK9 binds to the low-density lipoprotein receptors 
(LDLRs) on the surface of hepatocytes. The LDLR is the major pathway through which cholesterol-rich 
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles are cleared from the circulation and hepatic LDL uptake is a 
major determinant of circulating low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels. When an 
internalized LDLR is bound to PCSK9, this promotes the degradation of the LDLR, preventing its 
recycling to the cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, alirocumab increases the 
number of LDLRs available to clear LDL particles, thereby lowering LDL-C levels. 
The usual starting dose for Praluent is 75 mg administered subcutaneously once every 2 weeks. 
Patients requiring larger LDL-C reduction (>60%) may be started on 150 mg once every 2 weeks, or 
300 mg once every 4 weeks (monthly), administered subcutaneously. 
Type of Application and aspects on development 
Praluent is currently available in single-use pre-filled syringes and pre-filled pens containing 75 or 150 
mg alirocumab in 1 ml solution with activation button.  
In order to support the 300 mg Q4W dosing regimen with a single-injection administration, a new 2 mL 
prefilled pen auto-injector (AI) device (referred to as SYDNEY) has been developed. This submission is 
based on the results of a clinical program Study MSC14864 designed to assess the usability and 
Assessment report  
EMA/379767/2020 
Page 8/49 
  
  
 
 
 
acceptability of the device, as well as the efficacy/pharmacodynamics, safety, and pharmacokinetics 
(PK) of alirocumab 300 mg Q4W single-injection. The current 1 mL pre-filled pen device was used as a 
calibrator for the assessments. 
The therapeutic indications remain identical to the ones already approved. 
2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a solution for injection containing 75 mg/mL or 150 mg/mL of 
alirocumab as active substance. The currently approved presentations are marketed in a 1 mL clear 
glass prefilled syringe (PFS), containing 75 mg or 150 mg of alirocumab. The PFSs are further 
assembled in a prefilled pens (PFPs). The currently marketed PFP is the same for both strengths and 
consists of an autoinjector (AI) device with an activation button. 
As summarised in Table 1 below, this grouped application consists of: 
 
 
a line extension to introduce a new strength 300 mg (in a 2 mL clear glass syringe containing 
the same qualitative and quantitative composition of the currently marketed strength 150 
mg/mL) in an AI device without an activation button;  
a Type II variation for 75 mg (1 mL of 75 mg/mL) and 150 strength (1 mL of the 150 mg/mL) 
PFP presentations in which also an AI device without activation button is introduced. The 
modified device requires a change to the assembly process, in view of the different dimension, 
these changes are introduced via a Type IB variation.

2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
The finished product, alirocumab, solution for injection is a clear, colourless to pale yellow, aqueous 
buffered sterile solution, pH 6.0. Other ingredients are: histidine, sucrose, polysorbate 20 and water 
for injections.  
The 300 mg strength is introduced to allow a monthly dosing regimen with administration of a single-
injection. 
The product is currently available in two strengths, 75 mg (75 mg/mL in 1 mL) and 150 mg (150 
mg/mL in 1 mL) of alirocumab as active substance, in a 1 ml siliconised type 1 clear glass prefilled 
syringe (PFS), equipped with a stainless steel staked needle, a styrene-butadiene rubber soft needle 
shield, and an ethylene tetrafluoroethylene -coated bromobutyl rubber plunger stopper. The material 
of the PFS complies with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The PFSs are also used as an intermediate in 
the manufacturing of the marketed prefilled pens (PFPs). The currently marketed PFP consists of an 
autoinjector (AI) device with an activation button: to deliver the dose, the user depresses the needle 
cover and pushes the activation button to activate the injection mechanism.  
With this application, a PFP consisting of an AI without activation button is proposed for both the 
marketed strengths and for the new 300 mg strength as a grouped variation. The new AI represents a 
device improvement in reducing the number of steps needed for the activation of the PFP from 2 to 1: 
by depressing the PFP itself onto the injection site, the needle cover is depressed, which in turns 
activate the injection mechanism. Note that although a 2 ml PFS, referred to below, is an intermediate 
of the new 300mg strength PFP, the 2 ml PFS itself is not an authorised presentation. 
There is no change proposed for the 1 mL PFS. For the 2 mL PFS (with a capacity of 2.25 mL), the 
materials of the primary container closure system and their supplier are the same as those for the 1 
mL PFS. The plunger stoppers are sterilised by steam sterilisation instead of gamma-irradiation. During 
development, no leachables of toxicological concern were observed in the stored samples. Based on 
these, the new primary container closure system introduced with this application is considered 
comparable to the approved one. The PFP, with and without activation button, are functionally similar, 
have similar user interfaces, and have the same design principles and principles of operation. 
Since the qualitative and quantitative composition of the 300 mg finished product is the same as the 
marketed 150 mg, as they both consist of a 150 mg/mL solution of alirocumab and the primary 
container closure system of the new strength is considered comparable, the main focus of the 
pharmaceutical development was to adapt the current manufacturing process to support the new PFS 
size and the assembly of the improved AI. 
The assembly process involves the same equipment and process steps for both 1 mL and 2 mL PFPs 
with modification to accommodate 2.25 mL syringe attribute modifications. To accommodate the 
different sizes of syringes (1 mL or 2.25 mL) the dimensions of the AI subassembly components have 
also been adapted.  
The minor differences in some of the functional performance specifications are due to the differences in 
the fill volumes of the respective bulk PFS (e.g. 1 mL or 2 mL alirocumab solution) and set to ensure 
the full dose is delivered to the patient.   
Compliance with the essential requirements of the Medical Device Directive has been discussed. The 
performance of the modified PFP has been tested according to relevant ISO standards. For the 2 mL 
PFP, the clinical and commercial PFP comparability has been demonstrated for functional performance, 
Assessment report

Page 10/49 
  
  
deliverable volume and principles of operation according to relevant ISO standards; it has been 
demonstrated that the clinical and commercial version of the PFP are comparable and deliver 
equivalent doses. 
A human factor study was performed with the modified 1 mL and 2 mL PFP in order to evaluate the 
adequacy of the PFP user interface to support safe and effective use by the intended users. The 
outcomes of the tests were satisfactory. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
No changes have been introduced to the manufacturer and manufacturing process of the approved 1 
mL PFS of either strength (75 mg and 150 mg).  
The manufacturer of the 2 mL PFS (300 mg strength) is the same as the currently approved one for 
the 1 mL PFS.  
Product specification  
The 1 mL PFP specifications are the same as those for the already approved 75 mg/mL and 150 mg/mL 
1 mL PFP presentations, except for the adaptation of the functional performance test specifications. 
The actuator button activation force test parameter has been removed as the modified AI device is 
buttonless. 
The specification tests for the 300 mg strength (2 mL PFP) finished product are the same as for the 
150 mg strength (1 mL PFP)  
Batch analysis 
Batch analysis data on 3 batches at full commercial scale of the 300 mg (2 mL) finished medicinal 
product were provided. The results are within the specifications and confirm consistency of the 
manufacturing process.  
Stability of the product 
For the 300 mg PFP, real time/real condition (2 – 8 °C) stability data of three primary batches of 
finished product of the 300 mg, 2 mL presentation for 9 months and for up to 6 months under 
accelerated conditions (25 ºC / 60%) RH, according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The batches 
of the finished product are identical to those proposed for marketing and were packed in the primary 
packaging proposed for marketing. Data at stressed conditions study (45°C / 70%) for up to three 
months for both PFS and PFP is available for one batch. The stability trends between the 1 mL and 2 
mL bulk PFS batches are comparable. The applicant commits to continue continuing the stability 
studies. Based on available stability data and the above justification, the same shelf life as the 
approved shelf life for the 150 mg PFP is proposed for the 300 mg strength. 
A 2-year shelf life, from the date of fill of the bulk PFS, and “Store in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). Do 
not freeze.” as stated in the SmPC for the 300 mg strength (2 mL PFP), is acceptable.  
In accordance with EU GMP guidelines (6.32 of Vol. 4 Part I of the Rules Governing Medicinal products 
in the European Union), any confirmed out-of-specification result, or significant negative trend, should 
be reported to the Rapporteur and EMA.

For the 75 mg and 150 mg, supporting real time/real condition (2 – 8°C) stability data of one batch of 
both the 75 mg and 150 mg strength PFP (1 mL) presentations for 9 months and for up to 3 months 
under accelerated conditions (25ºC / 60%RH) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. A third 
batch of the 75 mg strength was stored under the same conditions and tested for appearance of 
packaged PFP and functional tests. The data provided is comparable with the stability data of the 
marketed product. The long-term data comply with the acceptance criteria; the data obtained under 
accelerated conditions are in line with the expected changes in the test parameters.  Since the 
modified auto-injector and changes to the assembly process are not likely to impact the stability of the 
finished product, the proposed shelf life for the modified AI for the 75 mg and 150 mg strengths is the 
same as for the already registered 75 mg and 150 mg presentations. A shelf-life of 30 months for the 
75 mg strength and 24 months for the 150 mg strength in the 1 mL PFP, calculated from the date of fill 
of the PFS, when “Store in a refrigerator (2°C to 8°C). Do not freeze.” as stated in the SmPC, is 
acceptable. The applicant commits to complete the stability studies post-approval.

2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
Alirocumab is a monoclonal antibody derived from biotechnological processes, the use of which will not 
alter the concentration or distribution of the substance in the environment. Therefore, it is not 
expected to have an adverse effect on the environment.   
2.3.3.  Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
In the current procedure a new ERA document was submitted, in which the Applicant has adequately 
justified the absence of further studies to assess the environmental risk of alirocumab. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
No new non-clinical studies have been submitted for this procedure which is acceptable. There are no 
objections to an approval of from a non-clinical perspective.

2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics 
A new 2-mL auto-injector device (referred to as SYDNEY) has been developed to deliver 300 mg in a 
single-injection as an alternative to administering 2 injections of the 150 mg 1-mL auto-injector device 
(AI). Study MSC14864 aimed to support bridging the data for the alirocumab 300 mg Q4W dosing 
regimen obtained with the currently marketed 1-mL AI device to the new 2-mL SYDNEY device. The 
objective of study MSC14864 was to collect real-use (usability) data assessing the robustness and user 
interaction of SYDNEY and the current 1 mL alirocumab AI device and to assess the PK profile, the PD 
profile, the safety and the immunogenicity of alirocumab 300 mg Q4W administered using SYDNEY.  
Study MSC14864 
Study MSC14864 was a phase 3, multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group usability study in 
high or very high cardiovascular risk patients with hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled with 
their lipid modifying therapy. This study consisted of 2 treatment periods, a parallel-arm period (first 4 
weeks) with a single alirocumab 300 mg administration with one of the 2 devices (SYDNEY or AI) and a 
single-arm period with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W administration with SYDNEY device only from Week 4 
to Week 16.

Figure 1: Study design 
Route of administration: subcutaneous, administered by self-injection (rotated within an anatomical 
area [e.g., right thigh then left thigh or right abdomen then left abdomen]) using either the AI device 
or the SYDNEY device. 
On Day 1, prior to the randomization, all patients were trained in self-injection using both devices at 
clinical site. Randomization occurred when training was completed and considered satisfactory. The 
first injection after randomization (on Day 1), using either AI or SYDNEY, was done at the 
investigational site by the patient under direct site staff supervision. Patients were monitored at the 
investigational site for at least 30 minutes after this first injection. 
The 2nd, 3rd, and 4th injections of alirocumab 300 mg, all self-administered via SYDNEY, were done on 
Week 4 (Day 29), Week 8 (Day 57) and Week 12 (Day 85). The 2nd and 3rd injections were done 
unsupervised either at home or on site. The 4th injection was done on site under observation by a 
caregiver (considered unsupervised, with no direction or prompting given); this observation was to 
assess and record in e-CRF whether the self-injection was performed adequately. 
The IMP was ideally to be administered at approximately the same time of the day Q4W; however, it 
was acceptable to have a window period of ±3 days. The time of the day was based on patient’s 
preference. 
Population: The PK population consisted of 67 patients with high or very high cardiovascular risk with 
hypercholesterolemia in the parallel-arm period (34 in AI group and 33 in SYDNEY group) and 65 in 
the single-arm period.  
Prior to randomization and after a screening period of up to 2 weeks, all patients were trained in self-
injection using both devices at clinical site on Week 0 (Day 1). 
This study consisted of 2 treatment periods (Study MSC14864): 
•  A parallel-arm period with one of the 2 devices (SYDNEY or AI) for the first 4 weeks: 
Assessment report  
EMA/379767/2020 
Page 15/49 
  
  
 
Eligible patients were randomized to receive alirocumab 300 mg Q4W using either SYDNEY or 
AI for self-administration on Week 0 (Day 1). The first IMP injection (Week 0) was done on-site 
under supervision.  
•  A single-arm period (with SYDNEY only) for the subsequent weeks until Week 16: 
All patients received alirocumab 300 mg Q4W using only SYDNEY for subsequent unsupervised 
self-injections on Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 respectively. The last self-injection on Week 
12 was done on-site under observation only without guidance (considered as unsupervised). 
The total study duration (per patient), including the screening period and treatment period, was up to 
18 weeks. 
Bioanalytical methods 
Serum was assayed for total alirocumab, free PCSK9 and total PCSK9 with validated ELISA methods 
and anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) were assessed by a validated bridging immunoassay. The same 
bioanalytical methods were used in Study MSC14864 as the ones used in the original dossier for 
Praluent. The lower limit of quantification was 0.078 μg/mL for total alirocumab concentration, 0.156 
μg/mL for total PCSK9 assay, and 0.0312 μg/mL for free PCSK9 assay. Sensitivity of ADA by the 
validated electrochemiluminescence assay was approximately 5.6 ng/mL. 
Pharmacokinetics  
Concentrations of total alirocumab and total and free PCSK9 in serum were assessed at Day 1, Week 1, 
Week 2, Week 3, Week 4, Week 8, Week 12, Week 13, Week 14, Week 15 and Week 16. Total 
alirocumab concentrations were used to calculate PK parameters. Twenty-four serum alirocumab 
concentrations were excluded from descriptive statistics as the actual sample collection day deviated 
by greater than ±15% from the nominal collection day relative to dose administration day. 
A non-compartmental analysis, using Phoenix WinNonlin, Certara USA, Inc., Version 6.4, assessed 
alirocumab maximum concentration (Cmax), time of Cmax (tmax), area under the serum concentration 
versus time curve (AUC0-tau) and Ctrough. 
For the parallel-arms period, log-transformed Cmax and AUC0-tau estimates and 90% CI for the ratio of 
geometric means (SYDNEY/AI) were provided using an ANCOVA model with treatment group (SYDNEY, 
AI) as fixed effect and baseline body weight as covariate.

both device groups (first time point measured). Pharmacokinetic parameters are summarised in Table 
2. The alirocumab exposure in serum after a single SC dose of 300 mg alirocumab via either AI device 
(2×150 mg) or SYDNEY device (1×300 mg) was comparable; the point estimate of the treatment ratio 
comparing the SYDNEY device (1×300 mg) versus AI device (2×150 mg) was 1.1 (90% CI: 0.9 to 1.2) 
for Cmax and 1.1 (90% CI: 1.0 to 1.3) for AUC0-tau, respectively.

Primary pharmacology 
PCSK9 total and free concentrations following single dose administration of alirocumab via the AI or 
SYDNEY device are summarised in Table 4. After a single SC administration of alirocumab 300 mg, free 
PCSK9 decreased with mean free PCSK9 concentrations initially falling below the LLOQ (ie, 31.2 
Assessment report

ng/mL) at Week 1, in both device groups. Detectable concentrations of free PCSK9 were restored at 
Week 2, with mean concentrations of free PCSK9 remaining close to the limit of quantitation, in AI and 
SYDNEY groups. At Week 4 following a single SC administration of alirocumab 300 mg, mean free 
PCSK9 concentrations (± SD) of 78.3 (±103) and 90.1 (±111) ng/mL were observed for the SYDNEY 
and AI device groups, respectively. 
The decrease in free PCSK9 is accompanied by a corresponding increase in total PCSK9 that was 
comparable in both device groups. At Week 4 following a single SC administration of alirocumab 300 
mg, mean total PCSK9 concentrations (± SD) of 3370 (±917) and 3330 (±1148) ng/mL were observed 
for the SYDNEY and AI device groups, respectively.

Secondary pharmacology 
Immunogenicity  
One patient in the SYDNEY group had pre-existing positive ADA status before the first alirocumab 
injection. Treatment-emergent positive ADA status was reported in 3 patients during the parallel-arm 
period: 2 (6.3%) in the AI group and 1 (3.1%) in the SYDNEY group. During the single-arm period, 2 
additional patients had a treatment-emergent positive ADA status. The ADAs that were detected in a 
few subjects were at low titer (≤240) and did not appear to impact the safety of alirocumab. No 
patient had positive neutralizing ADA status.  
2.4.4.  Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
A new 2-mL auto-injector device (referred to as SYDNEY) has been developed to deliver 300 mg in a 
single-injection as an alternative to administering 2 injections of the 150 mg 1-mL auto-injector device 
(AI). The pharmacokinetics of alirocumab and PCSK9 and changes in LDL-C from baseline of 
alirocumab 300 mg Q4W single-injection using SYDNEY device (1x300 mg) was compared to the 
current 1-mL AI device (2x150 mg) in Study MSC14864 in high or very high cardiovascular risk 
patients with hypercholesterolemia not adequately controlled with their lipid modifying therapy. 
Subsequently all patients were transferred to a single-arm period with alirocumab 300 mg Q4W 
administration with SYDNEY device only from Week 4 to Week 16 to assess the PK profile, the PD 
profile, the safety and the immunogenicity of alirocumab 300 mg Q4W administered using SYDNEY.   
Assessment report  
EMA/379767/2020 
Page 19/49 
  
  
 
 
The alirocumab exposure in serum after a single SC dose of 300 mg alirocumab via either AI device 
(2×150 mg) or SYDNEY device (1×300 mg) was comparable; the point estimate of the treatment ratio 
comparing the SYDNEY device (1×300 mg) versus AI device (2×150 mg) was 1.1 (90% CI: 0.9 to 1.2) 
for Cmax and 1.1 (90% CI: 1.0 to 1.3) for AUC0-tau, respectively.  
Ideally, more samples in the absorption phase should have been included to demonstrate comparable 
pharmacokinetics for the new device and the device used in the clinical studies since Cmax of 
alirocumab was observed at the first time-point for both devices. Comparative pharmacokinetics were 
a secondary endpoint together with comparative pharmacodynamics endpoints for the parallel period 
of the study; additional efficacy and safety data were evaluated in the extension period. In that 
context, study MSC14864 was sufficiently designed to demonstrate comparable pharmacokinetics and 
pharmacodynamics following a single dose administration of 300 mg alirocumab for the new device 
and the device used in the clinical studies. 
Following single dose administration free and total PCSK9 concentrations changed similarly over time 
via both AI and SYDNEY devices. 
2.4.5.  Conclusions on clinical pharmacology 
The alirocumab serum profiles and changes in PCSK9 data from study MSC14864 provide support that 
there are no meaningful differences in pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamic profiles between the 
2 devices, AI (2x150 mg) and SYDNEY (1x300 mg). 
Data on effect on LDL-C are discussed in the efficacy section.

Sample size 
No formal sample size was calculated, the sample size was based on empirical considerations. 
Considering a drop-out rate of 10%, it was planned to randomize 66 patients overall (33 in each 
group) in order to ensure 60 evaluable patients overall (30 in each group) resulting in 180 
Assessment report

unsupervised planned injections using SYDNEY. For the main objective of the study, to demonstrate 
acceptability of the device, it is acceptable that no formal sample size calculation has been performed. 
Randomisation 
A randomized patient was defined as a patient who was registered and assigned with a treatment kit 
number from the centralized treatment allocation system, as documented from its log file. A patient 
was not to be randomized more than once in the study. If a treatment was used without contacting 
the centralized treatment allocation system, the patient was considered as not randomized and 
withdrawn from the study. 
Blinding (masking) 
Not applicable, this study was an open-label design. 
Statistical methods 
No formal sample size was calculated, the sample size was based on empirical considerations. 
Considering a drop-out rate of 10%, it was planned to randomize 66 patients overall (33 in each 
group) in order to ensure 60 evaluable patients overall (30 in each group) resulting in 180 
unsupervised planned injections using SYDNEY. 
The primary endpoint (i.e., number (%) and types of SYDNEY-associated PTCs related to the 
unsupervised injections will be described on the safety population for the single arm period. The 
number and % of PTCs will be provided with the 95% CI using Wilson score method. If applicable, the 
number of PTCs per patient will be described. In addition, the type of PTCs will be described. 
All secondary device-related endpoints will be analyzed on the safety population using descriptive 
statistics. In addition, 95% CI for the number of PTCs, number and % of patients with any PTCs will be 
provided using Wilson score method. 
The primary efficacy analysis population that will be used for the analyses of LDL-C will be the modified 
intent-to-treat (mITT) population. The mITT population of the parallel arms period will consist of all 
randomized patients who receive at least 1 dose or part of a dose of IMP visit during this period and 
who had an evaluable value of LDL-C at baseline and an on-treatment LDL-C value within Week 4 
analysis window. The treatment period for the parallel arms period is defined as the time period from 
the first IMP injection up to 35 days after this injection or up to the day before the second injection, 
whichever comes first. Patients in this mITT population will be analyzed according to the auto-injector 
device group allocated by randomization (i.e., as-randomized treatment group). Lipid variables will be 
summarized (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum) in percent and absolute 
change from baseline. In addition, at Week 4 only, percent change from baseline in LDL-C will be 
analyzed using an ANCOVA model to determine the estimates and 95% confidence intervals for both 
SYDNEY and AI. 
Data analyzed by timepoint (except PK and PCSK9 variables) were summarized using the analysis 
windows given in Table 5. These analysis windows are applicable for all analyses, and they were 
defined to provide more homogeneous data for timepoint-specific analyses. For PK, since 
measurements were planned every week, e-CRF visits were used instead of analysis windows.

Results 
Participant flow 
A total of 69 patients were randomized and 67 were treated in the parallel-arm period (34 in the AI 
group and 33 in the SYDNEY group) and received first investigational medicinal product (IMP) injection 
on Day 1 via either AI or SYDNEY device. A total of 65 patients out of the 67 patients entered in the 
subsequent single-arm period (with SYDNEY device). In addition, one patient who received by error the 
AI training kit at Day 1 during the parallel arm period, entered in the single arm period. 
Table 6 - Patient disposition - Parallel-arm period - Randomized population 
During the single-arm period, 1 patient (1.5%) (who was randomized to SYDNEY group during the 
parallel-arm period) permanently discontinued study treatment due to an adverse event that occurred 
near the end of the parallel-arm period.

Recruitment 
A total of 13 sites in the US participated in this study; each site screened at least one patient and 
randomized at least 1 patient.  
Conduct of the study 
In the parallel-arm period, critical or major protocol deviations potentially impacting 
efficacy/pharmacodynamic analyses occurred in 7 patients (3 [8.8%] in the AI group; 4 [11.4%] in the 
SYDNEY group), resulting in exclusion of 6 patients (2 [5.9%] in AI group; 4 [11.4%] in SYDNEY 
group) from the mITT population (Table 8). Missing LDL-C assessment during the parallel-arm period 
was the main reason for exclusion (in 5 patients).  
One patient with critical or major protocol deviations (switched statin therapy from rosuvastatin to 
atorvastatin during the parallel-arm period) was not excluded from mITT population.

Background statin uses were comparable between the two treatment groups. Atorvastatin was used by 
majority of patients (81.2%). During the single-arm period, atorvastatin was used by 55 (83.3%) 
patients and rosuvastatin by 11 (16.7%) patients. 
Numbers analysed 
In the parallel-arm period, the mITT population included 63 patients. 
Outcomes and estimation 
Primary endpoint 
The primary endpoint measured by the proportion of PTC (product technical complaint) on SYDNEY 
device over the 196 unsupervised injections performed in the single-arm period (on Weeks 4, 8, and 
12) was 0.5% (1 of 196; 95% CI: 0.0% to 3.2%). 
In this single PTC, the patient reported leaking of medication during the injection ('moderate amount of 
medication leaked from around the yellow needle guard'). Subsequent investigation of the submitted 
device sample (by device manufacturer) revealed no defect and no root cause to the reported leaking. 
The complaint was considered to be related to the patient use of the device and categorized as patient-
related (by Sanofi Research & Development complaint office). Leaking during self-injection with an 
auto-injector device could happen in cases when a patient prematurely removes the device before the 
injection is complete. 
Secondary endpoints

Page 29/49 
  
  
 
 
 
 
For both devices during the parallel-arm period, no PTC regarding injection device was reported at the 
supervised injections on Day 1 (Week 0) in either treatment group. The vast majority of patients 
reported that both AI and SYDNEY devices were "very easy" to use, with the mean patient experience 
scores ≥9.8 (maximum 10 corresponding to "very easy") for both devices in all user experience 
assessments and overall ease-of-use. 
Two complaints (1 in each treatment group) not related to device or patient were reported at the 
supervised injections on Day 1. These 2 complaints corresponded to a mild injection site reaction in 
one patient in the SYDNEY group and a one-inch bruise at the injection site (on right lower abdomen) 
in another patient in the AI group. The event of one-inch bruise was not considered as an injection site 
reaction by the Investigator. Injection site reactions are known potential adverse events associated 
with auto-injector administration. Investigation of the device samples associated with the 2 complaints 
revealed no defects with the devices. 
For SYDNEY device only during the single-arm period: no other complaints were received other than 
the one already described. The SYDNEY device continued to receive high patient experience scores at 
Week 4, Week 8, and Week 12 injections (mean scores ≥9.7 in all assessments). 
The vast majority of patients reported being "very satisfied" with the SYDNEY device (mean patient 
perspective score ≥9.7 in all assessments) and "very confident" in using the device correctly (mean 
[SD] patient confidence score 9.9 [0.4]). The SYDNEY device was well accepted by patients in this 
study with a mean (SD) overall acceptance score of 93.08 (9.94) (out of maximum 100) at Week 12. 
A substantial decrease in mean LDL-C value from baseline to Week 4 was observed in both treatment 
arms during the parallel-arm period, after a single dose of IMP on Day 1 (Week 0). The LS mean (SE) 
percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 4 was -51.2% (4.4) for the AI group and -66.2% (4.4) 
for the SYDNEY group. The LS mean percent difference of SYDNEY versus AI was -15.0% (95% CI: -
27.6% to -2.4%). 
Table 10 - Percent change from baseline in LDL-C at Week 4: ANCOVA - On-treatment 
analysis - Parallel-arm period - mITT population 
During the single-arm period, the substantial decrease in mean LDL-C value observed during the 
parallel-arm period was maintained with repeated Q4W IMP injections with the SYDNEY device. The 
mean (SD) percent change in LDL-C from baseline to Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16 were -53.74% 
(32.64), -58.61% (25.07), and -56.99% (25.93), respectively.

When the LDL-C values from the entire study (from Day 1 to Week 16) were analyzed according to the 
treatment group allocated at Day 1 (at randomization) despite the fact that all patients received 
alirocumab with SYDNEY device from Week 4 to Week 16, the difference in percent LDL-C reduction 
persisted between the two randomization groups. The mean (SD) percent reduction in LDL-C from 
baseline was still greater in the "SYDNEY group" than in the "AI" group: -62.4% (21.6) versus -53.1% 
(29.7) at Week 4, -61.2% (29.5) versus -46.3% (34.4) at Week 8, -63.3% (19.9) versus -54.0% 
(28.8) at Week 12, and -62.9% (25.1) versus -51.1% (25.8) at Week 16. Therefore, the observed 
difference between the SYDNEY group and the AI group in LDL-C reduction from baseline to Week 4 
was unlikely to be related to the device. 
The observed difference appears to be partially attributable to the gender imbalance between the two 
device groups (55.9% female in the AI group versus 25.7% female in the SYDNEY group), as female 
patients have been shown to have slightly less LDL-C reduction with alirocumab treatment than male 
patients in previous alirocumab studies (7). After an adjustment for gender, the difference between 
device groups was attenuated but still present with a LS mean (SE) percent change in LDL-C from 
baseline to Week 4 of -53.9% (4.4) for the AI group and -63.5% (4.4) for the SYDNEY group. The LS 
mean percent difference of SYDNEY versus AI was -9.6% (95% CI: -22.7% to 3.5%). 
An improvement of the other lipid parameters (Total-C, HDL-C, and TG) was also observed during the 
parallel-arm and single-arm periods. The LS mean (SE) percent reduction in Total-C from baseline was 
also larger in SYDNEY group than in AI group: -36.5% (2.9) versus -27.6% (2.9); LS mean difference 
of SYDNEY versus AI -8.9% (95% CI: -17.2 to -0.6). The LS mean (SE) percent increase in HDL-C 
from baseline to Week 4 was similar between the two treatment groups: +6.7% (2.3) for the AI group 
and +4.5% (2.3) for the SYDNEY group. The adjusted mean (robust regression model) of the percent 
change from baseline to Week 4 was -1.5% (9.0) in the AI group and +4.7% (9.4) in the SYDNEY 
group; there was no meaningful difference between the groups. The mean (SD) percent change of 
Total-C from baseline to Week 8, Week 12, and Week 16 were -29.58% (22.43), -31.55% (17.68), 
and -31.83% (17.92), respectively. The mean (SD) percent change of HDL-C from baseline to Week 8, 
Week 12, and Week 16 were +5.53% (13.61), +7.19% (13.67), and +5.98% (14.92), respectively. No 
marked change in mean fasting triglyceride value from baseline was observed during the single-arm 
period.

2.5.2.  Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
Study MSC14864 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, 16-week study conducted in the US. The 
study planned to enrol approximately 66 patients randomized 1:1 to the SYDNEY or AI arm for the first 
4 weeks (parallel-arm period). Subsequently, all patients switched to the SYDNEY device arm from 
Week 4 to Week 16 (single-arm period).  
The inclusion and exclusion criteria are appropriate to reflect a population at high risk treated with high 
intensity statins and appear in line with the current indication.  
The primary endpoint of measuring the proportion of PTC (product technical complaint) with SYDNEY in 
unsupervised settings on Weeks 4, 8, and 12 is important (although this is during the single arm 
Assessment report  
EMA/379767/2020 
Page 33/49 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
extension period), however, other aspects including similarity in pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) may be 
considered more important to demonstrate similarity of the new SYDNEY device with the existing IA 
device For the primary endpoint no sample size calculation has been performed, which is acceptable. 
However, for evaluation of PK and PD similarity any sample size calculation would have been preferred 
to be able to make stronger conclusions.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
The study was only performed in the US but considering the objectives of the trial could be relevant for 
a European setting as well. During the study, discontinuation was limited to 1 patient each in the 
parallel period, although this was due to different reasons in each arm. During the single arm period 
only 1 patient discontinued treatment due to an adverse event. This has overall no major implications 
for the study findings. The study population reflects a population at high CV risk in accord with the 
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Baseline data were generally comparable between both arms except 
for gender (male 74% vs 44%, SYDNEY vs AI, respectively), race and baseline LDL-C levels (91 mg/dL 
vs 98 mg/dL, (2.3 mmol/L vs 2.6 mmol/L), respectively).  
The study showed that any technical complaint with the new device was limited to one incident out of 
196 measurements, consisting of leaking of medication during the injection and classified as patient 
(use) related. No technical issues with the device were noticed, which appears reassuring. In general, 
during the parallel period patient considered both the new SYDNEY device and the existing IA device 
easy to use, which is also reassuring. Complaints were limited to an injection site reaction (SYDNEY 
device) and a one-inch bruise at the injection site (IA device) both on day 1 (supervised period).  
Despite the fact that PK evaluation and PCSK9 levels were comparable between both devices and no 
major issues in quality design were noticed, a greater effect of the SYDNEY device on LDL-C was 
observed (-66% vs -51%; absolute LDL-C reduction 1.5 mmol/L vs 1.3 mmol/L). This was also 
supported by a difference in Total-C, while HDL-C and TG were not substantially different during the 
first 4 weeks. According to the MAH this could partly be explained by gender difference between both 
groups, but even after adjustment a difference of -64% vs -54% of LDL-C reduction remained. When 
data were analysed according to this randomisation for the single arm extension period difference in 
LDL-C effect remained (e.g. -63% vs -51% at week 16), which may suggest that this is not device 
related. This observation is likely a chance finding as any other reasons to account for this difference 
could not be identified. 
2.5.3.  Conclusions on the clinical efficacy 
In general, the device appears easy to use. Although there were no major issues in quality design, and 
a comparable PK and PD (PCSK9 levels) was observed between both devices, an increased effect on 
LDL-C was demonstrated for the SYDNEY device. However, especially the long-term data provided 
seem to suggest that this may not be related to the device and is likely to be a chance finding.

2.6.  Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
During the 4-week parallel-arm period, 67 patients (34 in the AI arm, 33 in the SYDNEY arm) received 
alirocumab 300 mg on Day 1 via two 1 mL injections using the AI device or one 2 mL injection using 
the SYDNEY device. 
During the single-arm period, 65 patients received one 2 mL injection with SYDNEY at weeks 4, 8, and 
12; One patient prematurely discontinued the study after the first injection in the single-arm period 
(second injection overall) due to an increase in alanine aminotransferase (ALT). 
Adverse events 
Parallel-arm period 
A total of 17 patients (25.0%) experienced TEAEs during the parallel-arm period: 5 (14.7%) in the AI 
group and 12 (36.4%) in the SYDNEY group.

The most frequently reported TEAEs during the parallel-arm period were in the Infections and 
Infestations SOC (5 patients overall, 1 [2.9%] in the AI group and 4 [12.1%] in the SYDNEY group). 
Two patients had TEAEs considered as related to IMP injection by the Investigator: 1 patient in the AI 
group with blood CK increased and injection site contusion (one-inch bruise on right lower abdomen at 
the injection site) and 1 patient in the SYDNEY group with mild injection site reaction (swelling). This 
last event was considered to be related to the IMP injection per the Investigator, but not related to the 
injection device. 
Most TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity; only 1 patient (in the AI group) had a severe TEAE 
(acute myocardial infarction). 
Single-arm period 
In the single-arm period, 23 patients (34.8%) experienced TEAEs.

patients [10.6%]). 
Three patients (4.5%) had TEAEs (4 events total) considered as related to IMP injection by the 
Investigator (musculoskeletal pain; ALT increased; blood CK increased and contusion [bruising on legs 
and left bicep]). 
Most TEAEs were of mild or moderate intensity; only 1 patient had a severe TEAE (chondritis). 
No patient experienced TEAE leading to permanent treatment discontinuation. No local injection site 
reactions were reported. 
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Serious adverse events 
SAEs were experienced by 2 patients during the parallel-arm period (1 [3.0%] in each group) and 2 
patients (3.0%) during the single-arm period; none of the SAEs were related to IMP. 
Two patients (1 in each group) experienced SAEs (acute myocardial infarction in the AI group and mild 
ALT increase in the SYDNEY group). In the patient in the SYDNEY group who experienced the SAE of 
mild ALT increase (>5 ULN from baseline), no relevant or trigger factors were identified for this event. 
ALT started to decrease prior to alirocumab discontinuation. The event was considered not related to 
the IMP as per the Investigator. Alirocumab was permanently discontinued due to the event. 
Two patients (3.0%) experienced SAEs: one patient experienced worsening of coronary artery disease 
and one patient experienced worsening of chondritis of auricle. 
Deaths 
No deaths were reported. 
Laboratory findings 
CK levels 
There was no relevant change over time in mean creatinine kinase (CK) value during the parallel-arm 
period (from baseline to Week 4, in either treatment group) and during the single-arm period (at Week 
8, 12 and 16). 
During the single-arm period, 2 patients (3.0%) had PCSA of CK >3 ULN (but <10 ULN) and 25 
patients (38.5%) had PCSA of glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (unfasted) or ≥7 mmol/L (fasted). 
Assessment report  
EMA/379767/2020 
Page 36/49 
  
  
 
 
 
One patient presented with an increase in CK to 9.5 ULN. The Investigator did not report this value as 
an AE. It was reported that the patient had started a new physical work (no additional detail provided) 
towards the end of study at the time when the peak value of CK occurred, no additional information 
was provided. The last values of CK at Week 16 (6.38 ULN [1966 U/L; normal range: 39-308]). One 
patient had a single increased CK value of 3.34 ULN at Week 12 (all other CK values were within 
normal range). 
Liver enzymes 
There were no relevant changes over time in mean liver function parameter values (ALT, AST, ALP, 
total bilirubin, and gamma glutamyl transferase) during the parallel-arm period (in either treatment 
group); and there were no relevant changes over time in mean liver function parameter values during 
the single-arm period. 
During the parallel-arm period, 1 patient in the SYDNEY group had a post-baseline PCSA of ALT >5 
ULN (1.51, 1.37, and 6.46 ULN at screening, Week 0, and Week 4, respectively); there were no other 
abnormalities. 
During the single-arm period, 1 patient had a post-baseline PCSA of ALT >3 ULN and 2 patients had 
PCSA of AST >3 ULN. 
There was no patient with potential Hy's Law cases. No patients had liver function values in or near the 
range for potential Hy's Law. 
Renal parameters 
There were no relevant changes over time in mean creatinine, eGFR, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) 
values from baseline to Week 16. 
Other laboratory values 
There were no relevant changes in mean laboratory values from baseline to Week 16 for RBC and 
platelets and WBCs. 
There were no relevant changes in mean laboratory values from baseline to Week 16 for Electrolytes

Immunological events 
ADA responses (Positive/Negative, and ADA titer level if positive) were assessed at baseline (Day 1), 
Week 4, and Week 16 to determine any pre-existing positive ADAs and treatment-emergent positive 
ADA responses. Samples that were positive in the ADA assay were assessed for neutralizing 
antibodies. One patient in the SYDNEY group had pre-existing positive ADA status before the first 
alirocumab injection. Treatment-emergent positive ADA status was reported in 3 patients during the 
Assessment report

parallel-arm period: 2 (6.3%) in the AI group and 1 (3.1%) in the SYDNEY group. During the single-
arm period, 2 additional patients had a treatment-emergent positive ADA status. The ADAs that were 
detected in a few subjects were at low titer (≤240) and did not appear to impact the safety of 
alirocumab. No patient had positive neutralizing ADA status. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
Alirocumab was permanently discontinued due to the event of mild ALT increase (>5 ULN from 
baseline) in a patient in the SYDNEY group. ALT started to decrease prior to alirocumab 
discontinuation. The event was considered not related to the IMP as per the Investigator. 
Post marketing experience 
Not applicable 
2.6.1.  Discussion on clinical safety 
Exposure to alirocumab is too limited with 33 treated with the new SYDNEY device and 34 treated with 
the existing AI for 4 weeks to allow for any comparison of safety. Further, safety data in the single-arm 
period (additional 12 weeks) of 65 patients treated with the new SYDNEY device is also too limited to 
draw any meaningful conclusions. 
Despite these limitations, it was noticed that more adverse events were reported with the SYDNEY 
device (12 (36%)) than for the AI device (5 (15%)), however, in the SYDNEY group only one event of 
a mild injection site reaction was considered treatment related. Of the 23 (35%) of AEs reported 
during the single-arm period, only for 3 patient events were considered treatment related 
(musculoskeletal pain; ALT increased; blood CK increased and contusion). 
Frequency of serious adverse events was limited, and none were considered related to study 
treatment, which appears reassuring. Although one patient in the SYDNEY group had a ALT >5 ULN 
(1.51, 1.37, and 6.46 ULN at screening, Week 0, and Week 4, respectively) during the parallel period, 
which was identified as a serious event and led to treatment discontinuation, this was not considered 
treatment related. 
Several laboratory abnormalities were observed during alirocumab treatment including 2 patients 
(3.0%) with CK >3 ULN, and 25 patients with glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (unfasted) or ≥7 mmol/L (fasted) 
during the single-arm period. Furthermore, beside the ALT >5 ULN case, 1 patient had ALT >3 ULN 
and 2 patients had AST >3 ULN during the single-arm period were observed. These findings are 
generally in line with the known safety profile of alirocumab. Due to the limited data no specific 
conclusions can be drawn on these laboratory observations. 
The ADAs that were detected in a few subjects were at low titer (≤240) and did not appear to impact 
the safety of alirocumab. No patient was positive for neutralizing activity. This appears reassuring. 
Discontinuation due to AEs was limited to the one patient with ALT > 5 ULN, and not considered 
related to study medication, which is reassuring.  
2.6.2.  Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety database derived from this study is very limited and does not allow for meaningful 
conclusions on any safety comparison between the new SYDNEY device and the AI device, and is also 
Assessment report  
EMA/379767/2020

too limited for any specific safety evaluation for the new SYDNEY device. However, since exposure is 
not different between both devices, it is not expected that safety will be different. Further, based on 
this very limited database no unexpected safety findings have been observed, which is reassuring. 
2.7.  Risk Management Plan 
There is no RMP update required for a line extension to introduce the new presentation. 
2.8.  Pharmacovigilance 
Pharmacovigilance system 
No changes to the pharmacovigilance system are made within this procedure.  
Periodic Safety Update Reports submission requirements 
The requirements for submission of periodic safety update reports for this medicinal product are set 
out in the list of Union reference dates (EURD list) provided for under Article 107c(7) of Directive 
2001/83/EC and any subsequent updates published on the European medicines web-portal. 
2.9.  Product information 
As a consequence of the line extension and the grouped variations, sections 1, 2, 4.2, 6.5, 8 of the 
SmPC have been updated. The Package Leaflet and the Labelling have been updated accordingly. 
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder (MAH) took the opportunity to include some editorial 
changes and to align the PI with the latest QRD template (version 10.1) and to update the contact 
details of local representatives in the Package Leaflet. 
2.9.1.  User consultation 
A Focus test of the instructions for use new to the pre-filled pen without activation button is carried out 
with the Package Leaflet of Praluent 150 mg. Information was found and understood by more than 
90% of participants. The user test is considered sufficient. Bridging reports were provided for the 
Package Leaflets of the 75 mg and 300 mg strengths, which is acceptable. 
2.9.2.  Additional monitoring 
Pursuant to Article 23(3) of Regulation No (EU) 726/2004, Praluent (alirocumab) was removed from 
the additional monitoring list as a new active substance and new biological following five years of 
authorisation (renewal procedure R/0055). 
Therefore, the statement that this medicinal product is subject to additional monitoring and that this 
will allow quick identification of new safety information, preceded by an inverted equilateral black 
triangle, was removed from the summary of product characteristics and the package leaflet within the 
present procedure.

3.  Benefit-Risk Balance  
3.1.  Therapeutic Context 
3.1.1.  Disease or condition 
The therapeutic indication for Praluent is not changed with this line extension procedure.   
3.1.2.  Available therapies and unmet medical need 
There are 3 categories of lipid-lowering drugs that are registered for the prevention of CV risk including 
statins (HMG CoA reductase inhibitors), ezetimibe (inhibitor of the intestinal absorption of cholesterol 
and related plant sterols), and evolocumab (a PCSK9 inhibitor).  
Statins are among the most studied drugs in CVD prevention and considered as the gold-standard for 
CV risk prevention in clinical guidelines. Although clinical guidelines clearly support the use of statins 
as treatment initiation with a LDL-C target <1.8 mmol/L (70 mg/dL) or a reduction of at least 50% if 
the baseline is between 1.8 mmol/L and 3.5 mmol/L (70 mg/dL and 135 mg/dL) in patients at very 
high-risk, a need exists for additional therapies for LDL-C lowering and CVD prevention, because some 
patients who are already receiving a maximum tolerated dose of a statin still have a residual CVD risk 
due to high baseline LDL-C or limitations in statin tolerability. It is well known that some patients 
suffer from statin side effects (e.g., myalgia) that limit their ability to take a statin or a high enough 
dose of statin to reach their LDL-C goal. Statin-intolerant patients are at higher risk of not achieving 
target LDL-C levels appropriate to their level of CV risk given that non-statin therapies, other than 
PCSK9 inhibitors, typically provide only about a 15-20% reduction in LDL-C.  
Ezetimibe is also registered in several countries to reduce the risk of CV events in adult patients with 
CHD and a history of ACS when added to ongoing statin therapy or initiated concomitantly with a 
statin. In clinical guidelines ezetimibe is recommended to be used as second-line therapy in association 
with statins when the therapeutic goal is not achieved at the maximal tolerated statin dose or in 
patients intolerant to statins or with contraindications to these drugs, although the absolute benefit 
from adding ezetimibe may be limited.  
For the reduction of CV risk, evolocumab is indicated to reduce the cardiovascular risk in patients with 
“established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial 
disease) . . .”. This indication is based on the results of the CV outcomes trial conducted with 
evolocumab, the FOURIER study. This study was a double-blind, randomized (1:1 ratio), placebo-
controlled, event-driven study involving 27564 patients with established cardiovascular disease and 
with LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL and/or non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL despite high-or moderate-intensity statin 
therapy, with a median follow-up duration of 26 months. Established cardiovascular events were 
defined as a history of myocardial infarction, non-haemorrhagic stroke, or symptomatic peripheral 
artery disease, as well as additional CV risk factors, which appears somewhat wider than the patients 
included in the ODYSSEY OUTCOME study. Evolocumab significantly reduced the risk for the primary 
composite endpoint (time to first occurrence of CV death, MI, stroke, hospitalization for UA, or 
coronary revascularization; HR 0.85; 95%CI: 0.79 to 0.92; p<0.001), with an absolute risk reduction 
of approximately 2% within this time frame.

3.1.3.  Main clinical studies 
Study MSC14864 was a multicenter, randomized, open-label, parallel-group 16-week usability study 
conducted in the US. The study planned to enrol approximately 66 patients randomized 1:1 to the 
SYDNEY (single 2 mL injection using new device) or AI arm (two 1 mL injections existing device) for 
the first 4 weeks (parallel-arm period). Subsequently, all patients switched to the new SYDNEY device 
arm from Week 4 to Week 16 (single-arm period). 
3.2.  Favourable effects 
Use of the new device was generally experienced to be acceptable with limited technical complaints. 
The primary endpoint measured by the proportion of PTC (product technical complaint) on SYDNEY 
device over the 196 unsupervised injections performed in the single-arm period (on Weeks 4, 8, and 
12) was 0.5% (1 of 196; 95% CI: 0.0% to 3.2%). This included one report of leaking of medication 
during the injection, but no defect and no root cause were reported with this leaking, and the 
complaint was considered to be related to the patient use of the device. 
The alirocumab exposure in serum after a single SC dose of 300 mg alirocumab via either AI device 
(2×150 mg) or SYDNEY device (1×300 mg) was comparable; the point estimate of the treatment ratio 
comparing the SYDNEY device (1×300 mg) versus AI device (2×150 mg) was 1.1 (90% CI: 0.9 to 1.2) 
for Cmax and 1.1 (90% CI: 1.0 to 1.3) for AUC0-tau, respectively. 
Comparable mean total PCSK9 concentrations (± SD) of 3370 (±917) and 3330 (±1148) ng/mL were 
observed for the SYDNEY and AI device groups at Week 4. 
The quality design of the new device was assessed as acceptable, with no major issues identified. 
3.3.  Uncertainties and limitations about favourable effects 
No formal sample size calculation has been performed for any of the endpoints including the secondary 
endpoints of comparability for PK parameters and PD parameters (e.g. LDL-C reduction). 
A greater effect of the SYDNEY device on LDL-C was observed (-66% vs -51%; absolute LDL-C 
reduction 1.5 mmol/L vs 1.3 mmol/L; (95% CI) -15% (-28% to -2.4%)) at Week 4. This was also 
supported by a difference in Total-C, while HDL-C and TG were not substantially different during the 
first 4 weeks. According to the MAH this could partly be explained by gender difference between both 
groups, but even after adjustment a difference of -64% vs -54% of LDL-C reduction remained. When 
data were analysed according to this randomisation for the single arm extension period, difference in 
LDL-C effect remained (e.g. -63% vs -51% at week 16), which may suggest that this is not device 
related. 
For both devices during the parallel-arm period, no PTC regarding injection device was reported at the 
supervised injections on Day 1 (Week 0) in either treatment group. The vast majority of patients 
reported that both AI and SYDNEY devices were "very easy" to use, with the mean patient experience 
scores ≥9.8 (maximum 10 corresponding to "very easy") for both devices in all user experience 
assessments and overall ease-of-use. However, any comparison of both devices in a home setting has 
not been undertaken. 
The PK parameter Cmax of alirocumab was observed already at the first time-point for both devices, so 
ideally, more samples in the absorption phase should have been included in order to exactly determine 
the Cmax. 
Assessment report  
EMA/379767/2020 
Page 41/49 
  
  
3.4.  Unfavourable effects 
More adverse events were reported with the SYDNEY device (12 (36%)) than for the AI device (5 
(15%)), however, in the SYDNEY group only one event of a mild injection site reaction was considered 
treatment related. Of the 23 (35%) of AEs reported during the single-arm period, only for 3 patient 
events were considered treatment related (musculoskeletal pain; ALT increased; blood CK increased 
and contusion). 
Frequency of serious adverse events was limited, and none were considered related to study 
treatment. Although one patient in the SYDNEY group had a ALT >5 ULN (1.51, 1.37, and 6.46 ULN at 
screening, Week 0, and Week 4, respectively) during the parallel period, which was identified as a 
serious event and led to treatment discontinuation, this was not considered treatment related. This 
was the only patient who discontinued due to an AE. 
Several laboratory abnormalities were observed during alirocumab treatment including 2 patients 
(3.0%) with CK >3 ULN, and 25 patients with glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L (unfasted) or ≥7 mmol/L (fasted) 
during the single-arm period. Furthermore, beside the ALT >5 ULN case, 1 patient had ALT >3 ULN 
and 2 patients had AST >3 ULN during the single-arm period were observed. These findings are 
generally in line with the known safety profile of alirocumab. 
The ADAs that were detected in a few subjects were at low titer (≤240) and did not appear to impact 
the safety of alirocumab. No patient was positive for neutralizing activity.  
3.5.  Uncertainties and limitations about unfavourable effects 
Exposure to alirocumab is very limited with 33 patients treated with the new SYDNEY device and 34 
treated with the existing IA for 4 weeks. Further, safety data in the single-arm period (additional 12 
weeks) of 65 patients treated with the new SYDNEY device is also limited.

3.7.  Benefit-risk assessment and discussion 
3.7.1.  Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
It is considered of importance that comparability in exposure and effect can be demonstrated for the 
new device in comparison to the existing device. In this respect, the study design is not considered 
ideal (parallel, no formal power calculation for PK and/or effect comparison). Nevertheless, the new 
device (SYDNEY) showed comparability to the existing IA device in terms of exposure based on PK 
evaluation of AUC and Cmax. This was supported by a comparable effect on PCSK9 levels. Further, no 
major issues in quality design of the new device are noticed. Although some difference in effect in LDL-
C during the parallel phase of the study were noticed, this is unlikely to be device related as this 
difference in effect remained during the single phase when analysed according to the randomised 
groups.  
Evaluation of usability of the device is also acceptable, although no major issues were expected 
considering the simplicity in use of the device. Nevertheless, as expected, patients experienced the 
automated pen to be easy to use. 
Safety data were limited which limits the possibility to draw any meaningful conclusion on the safety 
aspects of the use of the new device. However, since no new substance is used, and exposure is 
comparable to the existing device, no new safety issues are to be expected. 
3.7.2.  Balance of benefits and risks 
The benefit risk of the new SYDNEY device is positive.  
3.7.3.  Additional considerations on the benefit-risk balance 
Not applicable 
3.8.  Conclusions 
The B/R of Praluent 300 mg (2 ml (150 mg/ml)) solution is positive.  
The variations for the existing presentations are acceptable.  
The overall B/R of Praluent remains positive. 
4.  Recommendations 
Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus 
that the benefit-risk balance of Praluent 300mg is favourable in the following indications: 
Primary hypercholesterolaemia and mixed dyslipidaemia  
Assessment report  
EMA/379767/2020 
Page 45/49 
  
  
 
 
Praluent is indicated in adults with primary hypercholesterolaemia (heterozygous familial and non-
familial) or mixed dyslipidaemia, as an adjunct to diet:  
- in combination with a statin or statin with other lipid lowering therapies in patients unable to reach 
LDL-C goals with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin or,  
- alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or 
for whom a statin is contraindicated. 
Established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease  
Praluent is indicated in adults with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease to reduce 
cardiovascular risk by lowering LDL-C levels, as an adjunct to correction of other risk factors:  
- in combination with the maximum tolerated dose of a statin with or without other lipid-lowering 
therapies or,  
- alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies in patients who are statin-intolerant, or for 
whom a statin is contraindicated.  
The CHMP therefore recommends the extension of the marketing authorisation for Praluent subject to 
the following conditions:

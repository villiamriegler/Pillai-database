Summary of the risk management plan for PIQRAY™(alpelisib)
This is a summary of the risk management plan (RMP) for Piqray. The RMP details 
important  risks  of  Piqray,  how  these  risks  can  be  minimized,  and  how  more 
information  will  be  obtained  about  Piqray’s  risks  and  uncertainties  (missing 
information).
Piqray’s summary of product characteristics (SmPC) and its package leaflet give 
essential information to healthcare professionals and patients on how Piqray should 
be used. 
This  summary  of  the  RMP  for  Piqray should  be  read  in  the  context  of  all  this 
information  including  the  assessment  report  of  the  evaluation  and  its  plain-
language  summary,  all  which  is  part  of  the  European  Public  Assessment  Report 
(EPAR).
Important new concerns or changes to the current ones will be included in updates 
of Piqray’s RMP.
I. The medicine and what it is used for
Piqray is  indicated  in  combination  with  fulvestrant  for  the  treatment  of 
postmenopausal women, and men, with hormone receptor positive, HER2-negative, 
locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with PIK3CA mutation after disease 
progression following endocrine-therapy as monotherapy. It contains alpelisib as 
the active substance and it is given by oral route.
Further information about the evaluation of the benefits of Piqray can be found in 
the EPAR, including in its plain-language summary, available on the EMA website, 
under the medicine’s webpage: 
https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/medicines/human/EPAR/piqray
II. Risks associated with the medicine and activities to minimize or
further characterize the risks
Important risks of Piqray, together with measures to minimize such risks and the 
proposed studies for learning more about the risks, are outlined below.
Measures to minimize the risks identified for medicinal products can be:
 Specific information, such as warnings, precautions, and advice on correct 
use, in the package leaflet and SmPC addressed to patients and healthcare 
professionals;

Important advice on the medicine’s packaging;
 The authorised pack size — the amount of medicine in a pack is chosen so 
to ensure that the medicine is used correctly;
 The medicine’s legal status — the way a medicine is supplied to the patient 
(e.g. with or without prescription) can help to minimize its risks.
Together, these measures constitute routine risk minimization measures.
In  the  case  of  Piqray,  these  measures  are  supplemented  with  additional  risk 
minimization measures mentioned under relevant important risks, below.
In  addition  to  these  measures,  information  about  adverse  reactions  is  collected 
continuously  and  regularly  analysed,  including  PSUR  assessment  so  that 
immediate action can be taken as necessary. These measures constitute routine 
pharmacovigilance activities.
If important information that may affect the safe use of Piqray is not yet available, 
it is listed under ‘missing information’ below.
II.A: List of important risks and missing information
Important risks of Piqray are risks that need special risk management activities to 
further investigate or minimize the risk, so that the medicinal product can be safely 
taken. Important risks can be regarded as identified or potential. Identified risks 
are  concerns  for  which  there  is  sufficient  proof  of  a  link  with  the use  of  Piqray. 
Potential risks are concerns for which an association with the use of this medicine 
is possible based on available data, but this association has not been established 
yet and needs further evaluation. Missing information refers to information on the 
safety of the medicinal product that is currently missing and needs to be collected 
(e.g. on the long-term use of the medicine).

Table 2
Important identified risk: Hyperglycaemia
Evidence for linking 
the risk to the 
medicine
Hyperglycaemia is a reversible, on-target effect of PI3K 
inhibition.  Preclinical  study  data  indicate  that  alpelisib 
has the potential to interfere with the glucose and insulin 
homeostasis. Hyperglycaemia has been observed both in 
preclinical  and  clinical  studies  with  alpelisib.  Cases  of 
severe  hyperglycaemia,  in  some  cases  associated  with 
Hyperglycaemic  Hyperosmolar  Non-Ketotic  Syndrome 
(HHNKS)  or  ketoacidosis  have  been  reported  in  post-
marketing setting.

gestational  diabetes),  tobacco  use,  or  baseline 
diabetic status per laboratory values for HbA1c and 
fasting  glucose 
(normal,  pre-diabetes,  and 
diabetes). 
 Concomitant  medications  known  to  affect  blood 
glucose  levels  (systemic  corticosteroids,  statins, 
quinolones,  thiazides  and  thiazide-like  diuretics, 
beta  blockers,  atypical  antipsychotics,  protease 
inhibitors and calcineurin inhibitors)

Family history of diabetes mellitus
 To  describe  the  safety  and  tolerability  of  Piqray  in 
combination  with  fulvestrant  in  a  non-interventional 
setting.
 To  assess  the  incidence  of  osteonecrosis  of  the  jaw, 
and the risk factors for ONJ including the following:

 To  estimate  the  incidence  of  complications  of  a  non-
compensated 
as 
hyperglycaemic 
ketoacidosis and  hyperglycemic  hyperosmolar  non-
ketotic syndrome (HHNKS) under real-life conditions.

Extension of the indication for first-line treatment of patients with unresectable advanced, 
metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer other than predominantly squamous cell 
histology, in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy. 
1. 
Introduction 
Over one million new cases of lung cancer are diagnosed each year worldwide, resulting in close to 
one  million  deaths.  It  is  the  second  most  common  cancer  in  men  as  well  as  women,  accounting  for 
about  13%  of  cancer  diagnoses,  but  it  is  the  leading  cause  of  cancer-related  deaths  in  industrialized 
countries. 
NSCLC  represents  about  80%  of  lung  cancer.  The  most  common  histologies  are  epidermoid  or 
squamous cell carcinoma (30-35%), adenocarcinoma (40-45%), and large cell carcinoma (<10%). The 
frequency of these different histological subsets varies across countries and over time, with a decrease 
in squamous cell histology in industrialised countries. These histologies are often classified together 
because approaches to diagnosis, staging, prognosis, and treatment are similar. In clinical practice, a 
high  proportion  of  patients  with  NSCLC  are  diagnosed  at  an  advanced  stage  of  the  disease 
(approximately  30%  locally  advanced  and  40%  metastatic  disease)  with  the  remainder  (25-30%) 
presenting with early stage. Despite recent advances in treatment, the prognosis for patients with lung 
cancer remains poor. The 5-year survival rate for patients with NSCLC is still only about 15%.  
Research over the past decades has proven that chemotherapy has a definite role in the treatment of 
advanced NSCLC with incremental advances mainly occurring during the last two decades. One-year 
survival rates in patients with advanced NSCLC have respectively increased from around 10% without 
chemotherapy,  to  20%  with  an  active  single  agent,  and  to  35%  with  the  combination  of  two  active 
drugs.  Platinum-based  chemotherapy  emerged  as  the  standard  treatment  for  advanced  NSCLC.  In 
1995,  a  large  meta-analysis  evaluated  first-  and  second-generation  platinum-based  regimens 
(developed in the 1980s) and demonstrated a significant increase in median survival of 1.5 months and 
1-year survival rate of 10%, the latter corresponding to a 27% reduction in the probability of death for 
cisplatin-based therapy, compared with best supportive care. 
Two recent meta-analyses evaluated the benefit of single agent regimens vs. doublets and doublets vs. 
triplets in advanced, incurable NSCLC. The meta-analysis by Delbaldo established an increase in 1-
year survival from 30% with a single agent regimen to 35% with a doublet regimen, but did not show 
any survival benefit of triplets over doublets and confirmed doublet regimens as the standard therapy 
in  NSCLC.  Overall,  carboplatin/paclitaxel  and  cisplatin/gemcitabine  became  reference  regimens  for 
the  treatment  of  advanced  NSCLC  based  on  their  efficacy  and  manageable  safety  profiles 
demonstrated  by  the  results  of  a  randomized,  comparative  trial,  Study E1594.  Carboplatin/paclitaxel 
was  established  as  the  reference  regimen  for  ECOG  studies  in  the  treatment  of  patients  with  locally 
advanced  or  metastatic  NSCLC  in  the  first-line  setting  and  is  most  commonly  used  in  the  USA, 
whereas cisplatin/gemcitabine is popular in Europe. 
Bevacizumab  is  a  recombinant  humanized  monoclonal  antibody.  It  recognizes  and  neutralizes  all 
major  isoforms  of  human  VEGF.  Bevacizumab  potently  neutralizes  VEGF  and  blocks  its  signal 
transduction  through  both  the  VEGFR-1  and  VEGFR-2  receptors.  It  inhibits  angiogenesis  by 
neutralizing all isoforms of human vascular endothelial growth factor-A (VEGF), and blocking their 
binding to VEGF receptors. 
Although chemotherapy provides a meaningful survival benefit to patients with advanced NSCLC, it 
remains a rapidly fatal disease. It is clear that additions or alterations in the components or schedules 
of  standard  cytotoxic  regimens are  unlikely  to  result  in  major  improvements  in  outcome  in  NSCLC. 
Thus, the development of drugs aimed at targeting pathways specific for cancer, such as angiogenesis, 
represents a way forward.

Clinical aspects 
The  MAH  (Roche)  in  cooperation  with  Genentech  Inc.  (MAH  in  the  US)  and  the  National  Cancer 
Institute (NCI) in the USA are conducting a global development program for bevacizumab in a variety 
of  malignant  diseases.  Clinical  pharmacological  data  for  bevacizumab  are  currently  available  from 
12clinical  studies.  Nine  of  these  studies  were  submitted  previously  in  the  original  Marketing 
Authorization Application (MAA) for colorectal cancer, and an additional study was submitted in the 
Variation Application for metastatic Breast Cancer.. 
The  clinical  program  investigating  the  use  of  bevacizumab  in  addition  to  platinum-based 
chemotherapy  in  patients  with  locally  advanced,  metastatic  or  recurrent  NSCLC  consists  of  one 
pivotal  Phase  II/III  study  (E4599  –  NCI-sponsored)  and  two  supporting  studies,  one  Phase  III  study 
(BO17704  –  Roche-sponsored)  and  one  Phase  II  study  (AVF0757g  –  Genentech-sponsored).  Data 
from these three studies forms the basis of this submission. All studies are completed for the primary 
endpoints  and  are  adequately  controlled,  randomized,  comparative  parallel  group  design,  but  only 
study  BO17704  is  double-blind  incorporating  placebo  in  the  comparative  arm  with  platinum-based 
chemotherapy. A total of  1184 NSCLC patients (other than predominantly squamous cell histology) 
were  allocated  to  bevacizumab  in  these  three  studies  (817  patients  to  a  bevacizumab  dose  of  15 
mg/kg/q3w and 367 to 7.5 mg/kg/q3w). 
In  the  initial  bevacizumab  study  in  patients  with  NSCLC  (AVF0757g),  life-threatening  and  fatal 
hemoptyses  were  identified  as  bevacizumab-related  adverse  events  (AEs).  In  a  retrospective 
exploratory multivariate analysis of these cases, only predominant squamous cell histology (4 of the 6 
cases)  was  identified  as  a  risk  factor.  A  total  of  20  of  the  98  treated  patients  in  the  study  had 
predominant squamous cell histology (13 of whom received bevacizumab). Subsequent NSCLC trials 
excluded  patients  with  predominant  squamous  cell  histology,  patients  with  hemoptysis  and  patients 
with evidence of tumor invading or abutting a major blood vessel (the latter in BO17704 only). One 
study  is  ongoing  which  investigates  the  efficacy  and  safety  of  bevacizumab  use  in  NSCLC  of 
predominant squamous histology (AVF3744g). 
Scientific advice was obtained from the Rapporteur and the Co-Rapporteur in March 2004 with regard 
to  the  design  of  the  Roche-sponsored  Phase  III  study  BO17704  and  was  followed.  Pre-submission 
meetings  were  held  with  the  Rapporteur  and  Co-Rapporteur  in  July  and  August  2005  to  discuss  the 
content of this submission, and the impact of the publication of the E4599 study data on the feasibility 
and necessity of completing study BO17704. This discussion resulted in agreement on the content of 
the submission (as presented here) and amendment of the BO17704 protocol. 
Study E4599 was conducted by the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) under the National 
Cancer Institute’s (NCI’s) Investigational New Drug (IND 7921) in the USA according to the ECOG 
standard operating procedures and to all Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Human 
Research  Protections,  and  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  regulations  regarding  the 
conduct of human research that gave their origins in the Declaration of Helsinki. The BO17704 study 
was conducted in accordance with the guidelines for Good Clinical Practice according to the Tripartite 
Guidelines  (January  1997)  and  local  ethical  and  legal  requirements.  The  AVF0757g  study  was 
conducted  in  accordance  with  U.S.  Food  and  Drug  Administration  (FDA)  Good  Clinical  Practices 
(GCPs) and local ethical and legal requirements. 
2.1 
Clinical efficacy 
One  large,  randomized  open-label  pivotal  phase  II/III  trial  (E4599  –  carried  out  by  ECOG  and 
sponsored  by  the  US  National  Cancer  Institute  [NCI])  carried  out  mainly  in  the  US  included  878 
patients  and  tested  bevacizumab  at  a  dose  of  15  mg/kg/q3w  in  combination  with  six  cycles  of 
paclitaxel  and  carboplatin  chemotherapy,  followed  by  bevacizumab  as  a  single-agent  until  disease 
progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients were not permitted to receive bevacizumab after disease 
progression.

Two-drug  chemotherapy  regimens  which  combine  a  platinum  agent  with  paclitaxel,  docetaxel, 
vinorelbine,  irinotecan  and  gemcitabine  are  universally  accepted  as  “standard  of  care”  for  the 
treatment  of  advanced  NSCLC.  Literature  indicates  that  the  different  platinum-based  chemotherapy 
regimens  currently  used  in  the  treatment  of  NSCLC  are  considered  to  have  no  clinically  relevant 
differences in terms of efficacy. It is therefore acceptable to extrapolate the results of the combination 
of bevacizumab and paclitaxel/carboplatin to other platinum based chemotherapies.  
Two supportive studies are: 
One supportive Phase II study (AVF0757g – sponsored by Genentech) carried out in the US included 
79 patients with non-squamous cell histology and tested bevacizumab at doses of 7.5 or 15 mg/kg/q3w 
in combination with six cycles of paclitaxel and carboplatin chemotherapy, followed by bevacizumab 
as a single-agent until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity (up to a maximum of 18 cycles). 
Patients  in  the  control  arm  were  eligible  to  cross-over  to  single-agent  bevacizumab  (15  mg/kg/q3w) 
after  disease  progression  until  further disease  progression  or  for  the  remainder  of  the  study (total  of 
378 days), whichever occurred first. 
A  Phase  III  study  (BO17704  -  sponsored  by  Roche)  carried  out  internationally  outside  the  US 
included 1043 patients and is complete for the primary endpoint (progression free survival). The study 
tests  bevacizumab  at  doses  of  7.5  or  15 mg/kg/q3w  in  combination  with  six  cycles  of  cisplatin  and 
gemcitabine  chemotherapy,  followed  by  bevacizumab  as  a  single-agent  until  disease  progression  or 
unacceptable toxicity. Patients were not permitted to receive bevacizumab after disease progression.

Main Study – E4599 
The objectives of the study were: 
•  To assess overall survival in patients with previous untreated locally advanced or metastatic 
(stage  IIIb  with  malignant  pleural  effusion  or  stage  IV  or  recurrent)  NSCLC  (excluding 
NSCLC categorised as squamous cell treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel ± bevacizumab) 
•  To assess objective  response rate, PFS, and toxicity in patients with previous untreated locally 
advanced  or  metastatic  (stage  IIIb  with  malignant  pleural  effusion  or  stage  IV  or  recurrent) 
NSCLC (excluding NSCLC categorised as squamous cell treated with carboplatin/paclitaxel ± 
bevacizumab) 
Overall the E4599 Study Protocol was amended nine times. None of the amendments were made at the 
request of Genentech; they were initiated by ECOG. Timing of tumour assessments performed after 
completion  of  six  cycles  of  chemotherapy  was  changed  from  6  weeks  to  3  months  in  Arm  A 
(carboplatin/paclitaxel) until progression.

AUC =area under the curve; CR =complete response; IV =intravenous; PD =progressive disease; PR =partial response; SD =stable disease. 
Notes: Dose calculations were based on actual body weight. Carboplatin dosing was based on the Calvert formula: Total dose (mg) = (Target 
AUC) × (GFR +25), where GFR was the glomerular filtration rate in ml per minute, and the target AUC was 6.0 mg/mL × min. For males, 
GFR was calculated using the Cockcroft–Gault formula (Cockcroft and Gault 1976): GFR =(140 −age) × weight/72 × serum creatinine, 
where age was in years, weight was in kilograms, and serum creatinine was in mg/dL. Actual, not ideal weight was used. For females, GFR 
was calculated by multiplying the result of the above formula by 0.85. a/b different tumour assessments; see under section 
outcomes/endpoints. Module 5(2) 
Patients  who  experienced  protocol-defined  toxicity  to  paclitaxel,  carboplatin,  or  bevacizumab  were 
required  to  discontinue  treatment  with  the  corresponding  agent.  The  bevacizumab  dose  was  never 
reduced below 15 mg/kg.

RESULTS Study E4599: 
In the pivotal E4599 study, compared to the use of CP alone, the use of bevacizumab in addition to CP 
resulted  in  a  statistically  significant  and  clinically  relevant  efficacy  benefit.  In  the  final  stratified 
analysis  for  all  randomized  patients,  a  statistically  significant  increase  in  the  duration  of  overall 
survival  was  observed  in  the  Bv15+CP  arm  compared  to  the  control  CP  arm  (p=0.003).  This  was 
reflected in a clinically meaningful increase in median survival (12.3 months vs. 10.3 months), and a 
20% decrease in the risk of death (HR 0.8, 95% CI [0.69, 0.93]). The statistical significance of study 
E4599,  which  was  originally  established  by  the  crossing  of  the  pre-specified  efficacy  boundary  for 
overall survival at the second interim analysis, was therefore confirmed by this final analysis. Patients 
in  the  Bv15+CP  arm  also  had  a  significantly  prolonged  duration  of  PFS  (p<0.0001;  Kaplan-Meier 
estimated  median  4.8  months  vs.  6.4 months;  HR 0.65  [95% CI:  0.561,  0.764])  and,  among  patients 
with  measurable  disease  at  baseline,  a  significantly  higher  objective  response  rate  (29%  vs.  13%; 
p<0.0001). 
Duration of overall survival was the primary endpoint in study E4599. This is the most comprehensive 
source of survival information related to the use of bevacizumab in NSCLC available to date 
6 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Based  on  the  final  ECOG  dataset  transfer  to  Genentech  on  30 December 2005,  698 deaths  had 
occurred  in  the  all  randomized  population;  363/444  (81.8%)  in  the  control CP  arm  and  335/434 
(77.2%)  in  the  Bv15+CP  arm.  Data  reported  in  E4599  Treatment  and  Long-term  Follow-up  forms 
showed that the vast majority of deaths in both treatment arms (approximately 70%) were considered 
by the investigators to be associated with disease progression, indicating that overall survival reflects 
efficacy rather than toxicity.  
The Kaplan Meier plot for duration of survival shows that the benefit of bevacizumab was apparent 
from approximately 3 months and was maintained for at least 2.5 years after randomization (  ). The 
12-month survival rates (based on Kaplan Meier analysis) were 44% in the control CP arm and 51% in 
the Bv15+CP arm. At 24 months, survival rates were 15.4% and 22.0%, respectively.

In  pre-specified  exploratory  subgroup  analyses,  consistent  benefits  of  bevacizumab  treatment  were 
observed  across  all subgroups  in  terms  of  PFS  and  objective  response  rates.  Both  endpoints  are 
considered to be direct measures of the drug-induced treatment effect. The survival benefit associated 
with  bevacizumab  use  was  also  seen  in  all  patient  subgroups  defined  by  race,  ECOG  PS,  prior 
radiotherapy,  measurable  disease,  and  tumor  burden.  Four  subgroups  did  not  show  a  clear 
bevacizumab-related improvement in duration of survival: females, patients aged  ≥ 65 years of age, 
patients with weight loss  ≥ 5% at baseline, and patients with ‘not otherwise specified’ (NOS) NSCLC 
histology.  
RESULTS – Study AVF0757g 
In  the  AVF0757g  study,  among  all  randomized  patients  (ie,  including  those  with  squamous  cell 
histology),  the  addition  of  15  mg/kg/q3w  bevacizumab  to  carboplatin/paclitaxel  chemotherapy  was 
associated  with  a  significant  improvement  in  investigator-assessed  TTP  (Table 4).  The  objective 
response  rate  and  duration  of  overall  survival  were  also  numerically  higher  in  the  Bv15+CP  arm 
compared to the control CP arm. Median survival time was unexpectedly high in the control CP arm; 
this  may  be  explained,  at  least  in  part,  by  an  effect  of  bevacizumab  on  survival  time  in  the 
19/32 (59%) control CP patients who crossed over to receive single agent bevacizumab after disease 
progression.

Improvements  in  the  Bv7.5+CP  arm  were  numerically  lower  than  in  the  Bv15+CP  arm.  However, 
significant imbalances in prognostic disease characteristics at baseline (especially the high number of 
patients  with  squamous  histology  in  the  Bv7.5+CP  arm),  did  not  allow  a  definitive  conclusion 
regarding a possible relationship between dose and treatment effect to be reached.

RESULTS – Study BO17704 
The addition of bevacizumab (at both 7.5 and 15 mg/kg/q3w doses) to CG chemotherapy resulted in 
clinically  meaningful  and  statistically  significant  improvements  in  both  PFS  (the  primary  efficacy 
parameter)  and  objective  response  rate.  The  duration  of  response  was  also  improved  in  both 
bevacizumab  arms  compared  to  the  Pl+CG  arm.  No  statistical  difference  in  PFS  was  demonstrated 
between the Bv7.5+CG and Bv15+CG arms in an exploratory analysis. (Table 5).

b Exploratory analysis based on approximately 50% of the 709 deaths required for the protocol-specified final analysis of 
overall survival. 
2.2  Clinical safety  
Safety data on bevacizumab are available for a total of 1134 patients with non-squamous NSCLC. Of 
these,  475  received  bevacizumab  in  addition  to  carboplatin  /  paclitaxel  (CP)  (in  studies  E4599  and 
AVF0757g) and the remaining 659 patients received bevacizumab in addition to cisplatin/gemcitabine 
(GC) (study BO17704). 
The E4599 study was not set up to collect complete safety data. In particular, no Grade 1/2 adverse 
events (AEs) or laboratory data (other than protein dipstick and those reported as Grade 3/4 AEs) were 
collected,  and  no  AEs  were  classified  as  Serious  Adverse  Events  (SAE),  since  no  definition  was 
specified  in  the  protocol.  However,  events  qualifying  for  expedited  reporting  via  the  NCI  Adverse 
Event Expedited Reporting System (AdEERS), occurring in the bevacizumab arm, were reported and 
made available to Genentech and subsequently to Roche. These expedited reports as well as the AEs 
collected  on  the  study’s  CRF  overlap  considerably  with  SAEs,  making  it  likely  that  any  AEs 
qualifying as “serious” (by ICH definition) would have been recorded.  
To facilitate cross-study comparison and to conform to Regulatory guidelines, AE terms from all three 
studies were re-coded using the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA version 9.1).  
The  most  common  AEs  were  as  expected  of  a  platinum-based  regimen  in  patients  with  NSCLC. 
Proportionally  more  patients  in  the  bevacizumab-containing  arms  (77%  to  82%)  compared  with  the 
control arms (65% to 76%) experienced at least one grade ≥ 3 adverse event. 
The most common SOC in which grade ≥ 3 adverse events were reported was ‘blood and lymphatic’ 
(50% to 55% in BO17704; 20% to 48% in AVF0757g). It should be noted that, for coding reasons, 
very few patients in study E4599 appear to have reported adverse events in this SOC. 
Neutropenia  (including  neutrophil  count)  was  the  single  most  common  type  of  severe  hematologic 
toxicity reported in all studies. The overall incidence of grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia was low in all 
studies  but  occurred  at  a  slightly  higher  incidence  in  the  bevacizumab-containing  arms  (1%  to  2%

control vs. 2% to 4% bevacizumab). The higher incidence of grade ≥ 4 neutrophil count (17% CP vs. 
26% Bv15+CP) as well as grade ≥ 3 febrile neutropenia (2% CP vs. 4% Bv15+CP) seen in E4599 was 
associated with a higher incidence of grade ≥ 3 infections (5% CP vs 10% Bv15+CP). However, due 
to limitations associated with data collection on the CRF, it was not possible to establish whether there 
was a temporal association between neutropenia and infections. In BO17704, the higher incidence of 
grade ≥ 3 neutropenia seen in the Bv7.5+CG arm was associated with a slightly higher incidence of 
grade ≥ 3 infections (5% Pl+CG vs 8% Bv7.5+CG, 5% Bv15+CG). 
Severe  (grade  ≥ 3)  bleeding  is  a  rare  complication  of  bevacizumab  therapy  and  was  reported  at  an 
incidence of 4% in the bevacizumab-containing arms compared with 2% in the control arm of study 
BO17704).   
Other  common  grade  ≥ 3  adverse  events  reported  in  all  studies  included  fatigue/asthenia,  vomiting, 
nausea  and  hypertension.    Specifically  with  the  CP  regimen,  grade  ≥ 3  dyspnoea  and  peripheral 
sensory neuropathy were commonly reported adverse events. 
With both the CP and CG chemotherapy regimens (E4599 and BO17704, respectively), the addition of 
bevacizumab increased the incidence (≥ 2%) of grade 4 neutrophil count as well as ≥ 3 neutropenia, 
hypertension,  and  fatigue/asthenia  relative  to  control.  Grade  ≥ 3  AEs  which  occurred  at  a  higher 
incidence  with  the  addition  of  bevacizumab  (≥ 2%)  specifically  with  the  CP  regimen  included 
hyponatraemia,  infections,  febrile  neutropenia  and  proteinuria  whilst  those  seen  specifically  in 
combination  with  the  CG  regimen  included  thrombocytopenia,  vomiting  and  epistaxis.  Other  grade 
≥ 3 adverse events which occurred at a higher incidence in the bevacizumab containing arms of both 
studies (eg, hypertension, proteinuria) have already been identified as belonging to the safety profile of 
bevacizumab.

AEs leading to death 
***In E4599 and BO17704, the denominator is the number of pts who died in the first 60 days, plus those known to be alive 
on or after day 60 whereas in AVF0757g, the denominator is the number of patients who died in the first 60 days, plus those 
who received drug on day 60 or beyond. 
Based  on  data  collected  on  the  CRF,  more  patients  in  the  Bv15+CP  arm  (23/427  patients  or  5%) 
compared  to  the  CP  arm  (9/441  patients  or  2%)  had  AEs  which  led  to  a  fatal  outcome.  The  most 
common AEs leading to death were bleeding events: a total of 11 patients (3 CP, 8 Bv15+CP) died as 
a result of a hemorrhagic AE (haemoptysis, haemorrhage, gastrointestinal haemorrhage, hematemesis) 
with the most common being haemoptysis (1 CP vs 5 Bv15+CP).   
Other Serious Adverse Events 
•  Thromboembolic Events  
In  E4599,  the  incidence  of  grade  ≥ 3  arterial  thromboembolic  events  (ATEs)  was  higher  in  the 
bevacizumab 15 mg/kg arm compared with the control arm, whereas in study BO17704, the incidence 
was  higher  in  the  placebo-containing  arm.    Very  few  grade  ≥ 3  ATE  events  were  reported  in 
AVF0757g. 
In AVF0757g and BO17704, the majority of ATEs were of grades 1 or 2 severity whereas VTE were 
generally of grade ≥ 3 severity. 
The overall rate of fatal thromboembolic events was low across the studies. Based on the E4599 CSR, 
the rate of fatal ATEs was 1/441 in the CP arm compared with 5/427 in the Bv15+CP arm. There were 
no fatal VTEs in the CP arm compared with 1/427 events in the Bv15+CP arm. 
•  Hypertension 
Hypertension,  which  is  known  to  be  associated  was  bevacizumab  therapy,  was  reported  at  a  higher 
incidence in the bevacizumab containing arms in all three studies. 
Hypertensive events were manageable and no events resulted in a fatal outcome. 
•  Proteinuria 
In study E4599, the incidence of grade ≥ 3 proteinuria was 3% in the Bv15+CP arm compared with no 
events in the control arm. 
The incidence of proteinuria in study AVF0757g was low with no noteworthy differences between the 
study arms. 
In  BO17704,  more  patients  in  the  bevacizumab-containing  arms  compared  with  the  placebo-
containing  arms  had  proteinuria  reported  as  an  adverse  event  (2  Pl+CG  vs.  9  Bv7.5+CG, 
12 Bv15+CG).  The  majority  of  cases  were  of  grade  1  or  2  severity,  although  five  patients  (1 
Bv7.5+CG, 4 Bv15+CG) discontinued bevacizumab for this reason. Most cases of proteinuria resolved 
without sequelae.

•  Congestive Heart Failure 
The  incidence  of  congestive  heart  failure  across  all  studies  was  low  with  no  noteworthy  differences 
between the study arms. 
•  Clinical Laboratory Evaluations 
Study E4599: There was a higher incidence of grade ≥ 1 proteinuria in the Bv15+CP arm compared 
with the CP arm. 
Study  AVF0757g:  With  the  exception  of  hyperglycaemia,  which  was  more  common  in  the  control 
arm,  there  were  no  noteworthy  differences  in  the  incidence  and  type  of  other  grade  3/4  laboratory 
abnormalities.  Grade  1  or  2  proteinuria  was  more  common  in  the  bevacizumab  containing  arms 
compared with the control arm 
Study  BO17704:  There  were  no  noteworthy  differences  between  the  study  arms  with  respect  to  the 
incidence of grade 3 or 4 laboratory abnormalities with the following exceptions: 
The  incidence  of  grade  3  or  4  neutropenia  was  slightly  higher  in  the  bevacizumab  containing  arms 
compared  with  the  control  arm.    Grade  3  or  4  laboratory  abnormalities  for  thrombocytopenia  were 
more  common  in  the  Bv7.5+CG  arm  (43%)  compared  with  the  other  study  arms  (37%  Pl+CG  and 
35% Bv15+CG). More patients in the Bv7.5+CG arm (9 cases) compared with the other study arms 
1 Pl+CG, 4 Bv15+CG) experienced grade 3 or 4 abnormalities for ALT. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 
laboratory  abnormalities  for  hypokalaemia  (<1%,  3%,  4%)  and  hyponatraemia  (3%,  6%,  7%)  was 
slightly higher in the bevacizumab containing arms compared with the control arm. More patients in 
the  Bv7.5+CG  arm  had  grade  3  or  4 laboratory  abnormalities  for  hypocalcaemia  compared  with  the 
other study arms (7 Pl+CG vs. 11 Bv7.5+CG, 7 Bv15+CG). 
Overall, due to differences in trial design (including differences in comparator regimen) and ways of 
collecting safety information across studies, it is not considered clinically benefitful to provide pooled 
integrated displays of safety data for studies AVF0757g and BO17704. Many of the adverse events are 
typically  described  in  patients  who  receive  chemotherapy  e.g.  constipation,  diarrhoea,  arthralgia, 
alopecia, rash, fatigue/ asthenia, nausea and vomiting. Similar to other bevacizumab studies, the high 
incidence of headache, hypertension and epistaxis is related to bevacizumab treatment. 
•  Adverse Events by Age (Study E4599) 
There was no evidence of a clinically relevant difference in the safety profile of bevacizumab in young 
(< 65 yrs) compared with elderly patients (≥ 65 yrs).   
•  Adverse Events by Gender (Study E4599) 
Overall, there was no evidence of a significant difference in the AE profile of bevacizumab between 
males and females.   
•  Adverse Events by Histologic Type (Study E4599) 
There was no evidence that NSCLC patients with unspecified histologic subtype were at increased risk 
of grade severe (≥ grade 3) haemoptysis. 
Post marketing experience/Risk management 
The  post-marketing  experience  with  bevacizumab  is  based  on  the  safety  data  contained  in  two 
previously submitted Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSUR) covering the period from February 26 
2004 to 25 February 2006. During this 2 year period, an estimated 93,000 patients were treated with 
bevacizumab in the post-marketing setting or in company sponsored clinical trials. 
A  total  of  5.115  AEs  of  which  4.373  were  serious,  were  reported  in  2.857  patients  across  several 
indications. In total 318 treatment-related deaths were reported. 
13 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  most  frequently  reported  AEs  in  cancer  patients  treated  with  bevacizumab  were  gastrointestinal 
disorders  (23%)  such  as  diarrhea,  vomiting,  nausea  and  intestinal  perforation;  vascular  disorders 
(12%)  such  as  deep  vein  thrombosis,  hypertension  and  vasculitis;  and  respiratory,  thoracic  and 
mediastinal disorders (10%) such as pulmonary embolism and dyspnea (Table 6).

BENEFIT RISK ASSESSMENT 
The pivotal E4599 study is a large randomized study carried out according to accepted principles. It 
showed  a  significant  and  clinically  meaningful  improvement  in  overall  survival  by  the  addition  of 
bevacizumab  to  a  two-drug  regimen  containing  platinum.  The  pivotal  study  also  showed  a  highly 
significant improvement in response rate and progression-free survival. These findings are considered 
as supported by the two studies, AVF9757g and BO17704, of which the BO17704 study at present is 
lacking mature overall survival data, but acceptable PFS data has been shown. The BO17704 OS data 
is expected for 1Q 2008, and will be forwarded as commitment.  
The dose of bevacizumab was 15 mg/kg/q3w in the pivotal study. Data from the supportive studies are 
not conclusive with regard to the effect of the 7.5 mg/kg/q3w tested in those studies and the choice of 
dose  was  extensively  discussed.  The  CHMP  agreed  to  recommend  both  doses  and  requested  a 
commitment  to  investigate  the  lower  dose  and  if  appropriate  change  the  dose  recommendations 
according to the result. The MAH therefore committed to conducting a clinical study investigating the 
correlation  of  potential  predictive  biomarkers  to  clinical  outcome  in  patients  receiving  either 
14 
 
 
 
  
7.5 mg/kg/q3w  or  15 mg/kg/q3w  bevacizumab  in  combination  with  carboplatin  chemotherapy 
regimens.  The study will also include exploratory analyses of efficacy and safety.   
The duration of treatment with bevacizumab is in accordance with the available data “until progression 
of the underlying disease”. This concept of treatment although could be justified by the mechanism of 
action, the type of the compound and the stage of the disease, the issue of duration of treatment should 
be reviewed in the future in the light of the experience gained with the product. 
Generally, there were no unexpected toxicities with the use of bevacizumab in addition to platinum-
based chemotherapy in studies E4955, AVF0757g, BO17704. The principal significant risk shown to 
be associated with bevacizumab in this population was an increase in Grade ≥ 3 hemorrhage. Grade ≥ 
3  non-hematological  AEs  with  higher  incidence  in  the  bevacizumab  treatment  arms  included  those 
already  recognized  as  belonging  to  the  safety  profile  of  bevacizumab  (arterial  and  venous 
thromboembolic events, hypertension and proteinuria). Other Grade ≥ 3 non-hematologic AEs that had 
an apparent increased incidence rate in bevacizumab arms compared to control arm in each study are 
as follows; Study E4599: hyponatraemia, infection, headache and fatigue; Study AVF0757g: asthenia; 
Study BO17704: anorexia, vomiting and hypertension.  
Although bevacizumab has side effects, the significant, albeit modest, improvement in overall survival 
with the addition of the drug to standard platinum-based chemotherapy represents an important benefit 
for patients with locally advanced, metastatic or recurrent NSCLC other than predominant squamous 
cell, a disease which is invariably fatal with a short expected survival.  
The  benefit  of  adding  bevacizumab  as  seen  from  the  data  of  study  BO17704  can  be  extrapolated  to 
other  platinum  regimens  and  consequently  a  broad  indication  can  be  justified.  This  assumption  is 
supported by the findings of a publication in  N Engl J Med 346:92;2002 (Schiller et al.): where a a 
randomized  study  in  1207  patients  with  advanced  non-small-cell  lung  cancer  compared  four 
chemotherapy  regimens,  (Cis  +  pacli;Cis+gem;  Cis+docetax,  Carbo+pacli)  and  none  of  four 
chemotherapy regimens  offered a significant advantage over the others in the treatment of advanced 
non–small-cell lung cancer. Therefore, the benefit-risk for the indication: 
Avastin, in addition to platinum-based chemotherapy, is indicated for first-line treatment of 
patients with unresectable advanced, metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer other 
than predominantly squamous cell histology. 
 is positive. The recommended dose of Avastin is 7.5 mg/kg or 15 mg/kg of body weight given once 
every  3  weeks  as  an  intravenous  infusion  for  up  to  6  cycles  of  treatment,  followed  by  Avastin  as  a 
single agent until disease progression.

CONCLUSION 
-  On 19 July 2007 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agreed on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteristics and Package Leaflet.

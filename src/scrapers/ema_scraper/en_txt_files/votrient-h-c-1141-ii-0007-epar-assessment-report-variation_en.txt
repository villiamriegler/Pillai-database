2. Scientific Discussion 
2.1Introduction 
Soft  Tissue  Sarcoma  (STS)  is  a  rare,  heterogeneous  group  of  connective  tissue  cancers  originating 
from  mesenchymal  cells  and  their  precursors.  There  are  multiple  histopathological  subtypes  of  STS.  
Current conventions often group these subtypes under the general rubric of “STS” for the purpose of 
treatment,  although  new  treatment  options  are  increasingly  directed  more  specifically  at  individual 
histopathological subtypes. 
STS  accounts  for  less  than  1%  of  all  new  malignancies  in  adults,  and  2%  of  total  cancer-related 
mortality [Fletcher, 2002; Altekruse, 2009].

Surgery  is  usually  the  first  line  of  management  for  localized  STS.  Standard  treatment  is  generally  a 
wide  surgical  excision  or  even  more  radical  surgery  of  the  primary  tumour  combined  with  adjuvant 
radiotherapy  in  selected  cases.  The  addition  of  post-operative  radiotherapy  may  reduce  the  rate  of 
local recurrence [Leibel, 1982].  
Optimal  local  treatment  of  STS  tumours  does  not  prevent  the  occurrence  of  distant  metastases  in 
many patients, especially those with high-grade tumours. STS metastasizes primarily to the lungs, but 
also to liver, bone and other organs, depending on the subtype. Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy 
is  widely  used  in  the  treatment  of  locally  advanced  (unresectable)  and  metastatic  STS.  With  the 
exception of the chemosensitive small round cell tumours such as Ewing’s sarcoma family of tumours 
and rhabdomyosarcoma, as well as osteosarcomas, some of which are potentially curable even when 
metastatic,  virtually  all  other  patients  with  metastatic  STS  are  destined  to  die  from  their  disease  no 
matter how aggressive their management [Kriekelis, 2010].  
Treatment  options  for  second  line  treatment  usually  comprise  (previously  un-used)  ifosfamide  or, 
sometimes,  dacarbazine.  Other  options  include  pegylated  doxorubicin,  epirubicin,  taxanes  or 
gemcitabine.  Combination  regimens  (frequently  involving  doxorubicin  or  gemcitabine)  are  considered 
when the clinical condition of the patient as well as the histology of the tumour provides arguments for 
such choice. 
Pazopanib  monohydrochloride  is  an  orally  bioavailable  multi-tyrosine  kinase  inhibitor  of  vascular 
endothelial  growth  factor  receptor  (VEGFR)-1,  VEGFR-2,  VEGFR-3,  platelet-derived  growth  factor 
receptor  (PDGFR)-α  and  -β,  fibroblast  growth  factor  receptor  (FGFR)  -1  and  -3,  the  stem  cell  factor 
receptor  (c-Kit),  interleukin-2  inducible  T-cell  kinase  (ITK),  leukocyte-specific  protein  tyrosine  kinase 
(Lck),  and  the  transmembrane  CSF1  receptor  tyrosine  kinase  (c-Fms).  The  recommended  dose  of 
pazopanib is 800 mg once daily. 
Votrient (pazopanib) was first authorised in the EU on 04 June 2010.  Based on available data at the 
time of the application, pazopanib was granted a conditional marketing authorisation as monotherapy 
for  the  treatment  of  advanced  Renal  Cell  Carcinoma  (RCC)  and  for  patients  who  have  received  prior 
cytokine therapy for advanced disease. 
Glaxo Group Ltd submitted an application for a type II variation in July 2011 to extend the indication of 
Votrient for the treatment of patients with advanced STS and proposed to add the following wording in 
the current indication: 
“Votrient is indicated for the treatment of patients with advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS) who have 
received prior chemotherapy, or for patients who are unsuited for such therapy. 
The  Phase  III  trial  population  excluded  patients  with  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumour  (GIST)  or 
adipocytic soft tissue sarcoma.” 
With  the  MAH’s  response  to  the  second  RSI  (request  for  supplementary  information),  the  proposed 
indication has been amended as follows: 
Votrient is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with selective subtypes of advanced Soft Tissue 
Sarcoma (STS) who have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease or who have progressed 
within 12 months after (neo) adjuvant therapy.  
Efficacy and safety has only been established in certain STS histological tumour subtypes (see 
section 5.1)’’.

2.2 Quality aspects 
No new data related to pharmaceutical quality were submitted with this variation application, which is 
considered acceptable. 
2.3 Non clinical aspects  
2.3.1 Introduction 
The  non-clinical  studies  submitted  by  the  MAH  included  a  liposarcoma  xenograft  study,  an  in  vitro 
transport study, an oral 8 day toxicity study in rats and three toxicity studies in juvenile rats. 
2.3.2 Pharmacology  
The effect of pazopanib on growth of human liposarcoma (SW-872) has been examined in xenograft in 
severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) Mice. 
SCID  mice  (10♂/group)  were  inoculated  with  human  liposarcoma  cells.  When  the  tumour  volume 
reached  about  100  –  200  mm3,  the  mice  were  treated  orally  with  pazopanib  (100  mg/kg/day  once 
daily or 30, 100 mg/kg/day twice daily) for 21 days. 
When compared to the vehicle control, pazopanib significantly inhibited the tumour growth from day 8 
until  the  end  of  treatment  (measured  as  both  tumour  volume  and  weight)  for  all  three  treatment 
regimes. Reductions in body weight were observed in all dose groups starting on Day 3, although body 
weight gain was evident from Day 8. Mice dosed pazopanib at 100 mg/kg BID showed stabilization in 
body  weight  reduction  after  Day  12.  At  Day  22,  body  weight  was  lowest  in  the  animals  dosed 
pazopanib at 100 mg/kg BID. Doses of 30 mg/kg BID or 100 mg/kg pazopanib QD or BID significantly 
inhibited tumour growth in a dose-dependent manner, starting from Day 8. At Day 21, inhibition at 30 
mg/kg BID or 100 mg/kg pazopanib QD or BID was 52, 49 and 67%, respectively (data not shown). 
2.3.3 Pharmacokinetics 
An in vitro study using sandwich-cultured rat or human hepatocytes was conducted to investigate the 
inhibition  of  the  sodium-taurocholate  co-transporting  polypeptide  (NTCP)  and  bile  salt  export  pump 
(BSEP)  by  pazopanib  and  its  metabolites  GSK1268992  and  GSK1268997.  The  three  compounds  had 
minimal  effects  on  taurocholate  disposition  in  human  hepatocytes.  In  rat  hepatocytes,  all  three 
compounds reduced taurocholate uptake by approximately 33-44% at 30 μM (data not shown).  
2.3.4 Toxicology 
Repeat-dose toxicity 
The hepatotoxicity of pazopanib was evaluated in an investigative study (RD2010-00192) conducted in 
Sprague Dawley SD rats (6♂/group) following 8-days of oral dosing of the monohydrochloride salt of 
pazopanib (500 mg/kg/day expressed as parent compound). The following endpoints/parameters were 
evaluated: clinical observations, body weights, food consumption measurements, clinical chemistry 
results (from pre-treatment Days 2, 4 and 8), microscopic observations (three lobes of the liver), 
hepatic gene expression analysis (lateral lobe), and toxicokinetics (treated animals only). The findings 
are summarised in Table 1.

Based  on  the  results,  mild  elevations  in  alanine  aminotransferase,  aspartate  aminotransferase,  total 
bilirubin, glutamate dehydrogenase, and total bile acids occurred in rats given 500 mg/kg/day. There 
were  no  histopathology  findings  in  hepatocytes  or  biliary  epithelium  to  correlate  with  the  clinical 
chemistry  findings.  However,  vascular  effects  were  observed  in  intrahepatic  branches  of  the  hepatic 
artery and arterioles near the liver hilus in all rats given 500 mg/kg/day.

a  Due  to  mortality  and  marked  decreases  in  body  weight  gain  among  the  group,  the  300  mg/kg/day  group  was 
given a drug holiday for 4 days and resumed dosing at 100 mg/kg/day for the study duration. 
2.3.5 Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
An updated ERA has been submitted by the MAH as part of this application. 
  Phase I 
PEC surfacewater 
Based on the maximum daily dose of 800 mg/day, the MAH has calculated PEC surfacewater values using 
both  the  default  Fpen  of  0.01  and  a  refined  Fpen.  Using  the  default  Fpen  of  0.01,  the  PECsurfacewater 
becomes  0.4  μg/L,  which  is  well  above  the  action  limit  of  0.01  μg/L.  When  an  Fpen  based  on  the 
prevalence of RCC (3.12 x 10-4) is used, the PECsurfacewater becomes 0.12 μg/L.  Assuming all patients 
are treated with the prescribed dose for 365 days/year, results in a PECsurfacewater with the same value. 
When an Fpen based on the estimated yearly consumption (4.46 x 1010 mg/year) and the defined daily 
dose (DDD, 1250 mg) is used, the PECsurfacewater becomes 0.08 μg/L. 
PBT assessment  
The MAH has performed an OECD 302C test and OECD 107 test in order to determine the inherent 
biodegradability and the log Kow for pazopanib, respectively. Pazopanib was determined to be not 
inherently biodegradable and is thus considered a potential persistent substance. Using the currently 
reported log Kow values the ion-corrected low Dow of pazopanib was determined to be 2.26, 3.33 and 
3.92 at pH 5, 7 and 9, respectively. 
Phase II 
The results for the phase II-Tier A assessment for pazopanib are summarized in table 4:

a Based on geometric mean measured concentrations: 
The PEC groundwater is based on the PEC surfacewater. Using the PEC surfacewater of 4 μg/L based on a worst case 
scenario, the PEC groundwater becomes 1 μg/L. 
PEC surfacewater/PNEC micro-ogranisms  =  4  μg/L  /  100,000  μg/L  =  4.0  x  10-5.  This  ratio  is  lower  than  the 
trigger ratio of 0.1. 
PEC surfacewater/PNEC water = 4 μg/L / 15 μg/L = 0.27. This ratio is lower than the trigger ratio of 1. 
PEC groundwater/PNEC groundwater = 1 μg/L / 15 μg/L = 0.067. This ratio is lower than the trigger ratio of 1. 
In  addition,  based  on  the  reported  Koc  value  of  2.35,  studies  for  the  terrestrial  environment  are  not 
necessary. 
2.3.6 Discussion on non-clinical aspects 
The MAH has submitted one in vivo pharmacodynamic study, one in vitro pharmacokinetic study, one 
investigative repeat-dose toxicity study and three juvenile repeat-dose toxicity studies. 
The  liposarcoma  xenograft  study  supports  the  use  of  pazopanib  in  the  treatment  of  sarcoma 
malignancies.  However  it  should  be  noted  that  the  predictive  value  of  mouse  xenograft  models  for 
clinical efficacy is rather limited. 
Two  studies  (one  in  vitro  kinetic  study  and  one  8  days  repeated-dose  toxicity)  were  performed  to 
elucidate  the  possible  mechanism  involved  in  the  hepatotoxicity  seen  in  clinical  and  non-clinical 
studies.  Neither  study  provided  evidence  about  the  mechanism  involved  in  the  hepatic  enzyme 
alterations observed following pazopanib treatment. 
In juvenile toxicity studies, when rats were dosed from day 9 post partum through day 21 postpartum, 
pazopanib caused mortalities and abnormal organ growth/maturation in kidney, lung, liver and heart, 
at  a  dose  approximately  0.1 times  the  clinical  exposure  based  on  AUC  in  adult  humans.  When  rats 
were dosed from day 21 post partum to day 62 post partum, toxicologic findings were similar to adult 
rats  at  comparable  exposures.  Human  paediatric  patients  are  at  increased  risk  for  bone  and  teeth 
effects  as  compared  to  adults,  as  these  changes,  including  inhibition  of  growth  (shortened  limbs), 
fragile  bones  and  remodelling  of  teeth,  were  present  in  juvenile  rats  at  ≥ 10 mg/kg/day  (equal  to 
approximately  0.1-0.2  times  the  clinical  exposure  based  on  AUC  in  adult  humans.  The  section  5.3  of 
the SmPC has been updated to include the above information on juvenile toxicity studies.  
An  update  of  the  original  environmental  assessment  taking  into  account  both  indications  (the 
metastatic renal cell carcinoma and soft tissue sarcoma) has been provided by the MAH. 
Overall the ERA is considered acceptable. However the CHMP recommended the MAH to perform a 
water sediment study (OECD 308) to determine the effects on sediment organisms. Furthermore, 
using the currently reported log Kow values the ion-corrected low Dow of pazopanib was determined to 
be 2.26, 3.33 and 3.92 at pH 5, 7 and 9, respectively. Based on that, the CHMP recommended the 
MAH to perform a bioconcentration study (OECD 305).

2.4 Clinical aspects 
GCP 
The Clinical trials were performed in accordance with GCP as claimed by the applicant. 
The  applicant  has  provided  a  statement  to  the  effect  that  clinical  trials  conducted  outside  the 
community were carried out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
2.4.1 Pharmacokinetics / Pharmacodynamics 
Pharmacokinetic data was collected in supportive Phase II study VEG20002. Serial blood samples for 
analysis of plasma pazopanib were collected at the Day 29 visit. A blood sample for analysis of plasma 
pazopanib was also collected prior to pazopanib administration on Days 57 and Day 85. The results are 
presented in Table 5.

2.4.2 Conclusion on Clinical Pharmacology 
The  difference  between  the  mean  pre-dose  plasma  pazopanib  concentrations  on  Day  29  and  Day  85 
was less than 5%. Although the data presented regarding the PK of pazopanib in STS are limited, no 
difference  in  pazopanib  plasma  concentrations  evaluated  at  the  same  time  points  were  observed 
between  STS  and  RCC  patients.  Moreover,  the  pazopanib  plasma  concentrations  measured  in  study 
VEG20002 employing pazopanib 800 mg once daily were ≥20 g/ml in more than 70% of patients. This 
threshold concentration has been correlated with pharmacodynamic markers such as hypertension and 
soluble VEGFR2 inhibition, and with efficacy in RCC.  
2.5 Clinical efficacy 
The data in the current application are mainly from a multicentre, randomised, double-blind, placebo-
controlled phase III trial (VEG110727) comparing pazopanib to placebo in patients with metastatic STS 
with confirmed disease progression during or following therapy. It is supported by data from a phase II 
study (VEG20002) of pazopanib in advanced and/or metastatic STS that was refractory or relapsed. A 
summary of both pivotal and supportive studies is presented in Table 6.

2.5.1 Main study 
VEG110727 study  
This  was  a  Phase  III,  randomised,  double-blind,  placebo-controlled,  multicenter  study  designed  to 
evaluate the efficacy and safety of pazopanib compared to placebo in patients with STS whose disease 
had progressed during or following prior chemotherapy.  
Methods 
Study Participants  
The  study  population  included  patients  with  histological  evidence  of  high  or  intermediate  grade 
malignant STS, or cytological evidence in case of presence of multiple metastases. Low grade tumours 
were allowed provided there was evidence of disease progression.  
Eligible  histology  subtypes  included  fibroblastic  (adult  fibrosarcoma,  myxofibrosarcoma,  sclerosing 
epithelioid  fibrosarcoma,  malignant  solitary  fibrous  tumours),  so-called  fibrohistiocytic  (pleomorphic 
malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), giant cell MFH, inflammatory MFH), leiomyosarcoma, malignant 
glomus tumours, skeletal muscles (pleomorphic and alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma), vascular (epithelioid 
hemangioendothelioma,  angiosarcoma),  sarcoma  of  uncertain  differentiation  as  well  as  synovial, 
epithelioid, alveolar soft part, clear cell, desmoplastic small round cell, extra-renal rhabdoid, malignant 
mesenchymoma,  PEComa,  intimal  sarcoma,  malignant  peripheral  nerve  sheath  tumours,  and 
undifferentiated soft tissue sarcomas not otherwise specified (NOS).  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

Excluded  were  chondrosarcoma  and  ewing  tumours  /  primitive  neuroectodermal  tumour  (PNET). 
Histology  subtypes  also  not  considered  eligible  were  adipocytic  sarcoma  (all  subtypes),  all 
rhabdomyosarcoma  that  were  not  alveolar  or  pleomorphic,  chondrosarcoma,  osteosarcoma,  Ewing 
tumours  /  PNET,  gastrointestinal  stromal  tumours  (GIST),  dermofibromatosis  sarcoma  protuberans, 
inflammatory  myofibroblastic  sarcoma,  malignant  mesothelioma,  mixed  mesodermal  tumours  of  the 
uterus. 
In addition, all patients needed to have metastatic and not only locally advanced disease, World Health 
Organization  (WHO)  performance  status  0-1,  and  to  have  progressed  after  no  more  than  4  prior 
treatments (2 in case of combination treatments) for advanced disease.  
All  patients  had  to  be  pre-treated  with  anthracycline  or  not  to  be  suitable  for  such  treatment.  QT 
corrected for heart rate (QTc) <480 msec at baseline as well as left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) 
within  the  normal  range  >50%)  was  requested,  as  well  as  adequate  bone  marrow,  lever  and  renal 
function. 
Treatments 
Eligible patients were first stratified according to the following factors: a) WHO performance status: 0 
vs. 1 and b) number of prior lines of systemic treatment for advanced disease: 0, 1 vs. 2+.  Patients 
were then centrally randomised in a 2:1 ratio of pazopanib: placebo to receive 800 mg pazopanib daily 
dosing  or  matching  placebo.  Patients  continued  on  study  drug  (pazopanib  or  placebo)  until  disease 
progression,  death,  unacceptable  toxicity  or  withdrawal  of  consent.  The  design  of  the  study  is 
presented in Figure 1.

Objectives 
The  primary  objective  of  the  study  was  to  evaluate  and  compare  progression  free  survival  (PFS)  (by 
independent radiology review) in pazopanib-treated versus placebo-treated patients. 
Secondary objectives were to evaluate and compare overall survival (OS) in the two treatment arms, 
to  evaluate  PFS  in  the  3  histology  subtypes  (leiomyosarcoma,  synovial  sarcoma  and  “other”  STS 
eligible histologies) recruited into the study, to compare the two treatment arms for overall response

rate (ORR), to compare the two treatment arms for time to response (TTR) and duration of response 
(DR), and to assess safety and tolerability. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
Primary efficacy endpoint 
Progression-free  survival,  defined  as  the  interval  between  the  date  of  randomisation  and  the  earliest 
date of either disease progression or death due to any cause.   
Secondary efficacy endpoints 
Overall survival, defined as the time from date of randomisation until date of death due to any cause.  
Other secondary endpoints 
PFS in the 3 histology types (leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma and other eligible histologies). 
ORR defined as the percentage of patients who achieved either confirmed complete response (CR) or 
partial response (PR). 
Time  to  response,  defined  for  the  subset  of  patients  who  achieved  a  confirmed  CR  or  PR,  defined  as 
the  time  from  date  of  randomisation  until  date  of  first  documented  evidence  of  CR  or  PR  (whichever 
status is recorded first). 
Duration of response, defined for the subset of patients who achieved a confirmed CR or PR, defined as 
the time from date of first documented evidence of CR or PR until date of either the first documented 
sign  of  progressive  disease  (PD)  or  death  due  to  any  cause.  Patients  who  have  neither  died  nor 
progressed will be censored at the date of the last adequate radiologic assessment. 
Safety and tolerability endpoints included evaluation of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events 
(SAEs) and changes from baseline in vital signs (including WHO performance status (PS)), laboratory 
parameters and LVEF. 
Exploratory endpoints  
Changes in quality of life (QoL) from baseline, as assessed by the Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ)-
C30 and EQ-5D. 
Sample size 
The primary endpoint is PFS and the trial was powered to detect at least a 37% decrease in the hazard 
rate  (HR)  (HR  less  than  or  equal  to  0.63)  corresponding  to  an  increase  from  2.2  to  3.5  months  in 
median  PFS.  A  total  of  224 PFS  events  were  required  for  detecting  the  targeted  difference  with  90% 
power and a 5% two-sided alpha level. For OS, the trial was powered to detect a 33% decrease in the 
death hazard rate (HR less than or equal to 0.67) corresponding to an increase from 8 to 12 months in 
median OS. The overall power on this endpoint was 80% based on 206 death events. 
After  observing  a  higher  than  expected  recruitment  rate,  the  expected  sample  size  was  increased  to 
360 patients in a period of 22 months. At the time of this decision, approximately 130 patients were 
recruited, and there was no access to unblinded data. The median assumptions for PFS and OS were 
not  changed.  However,  the  number  of  PFS  events was  increased  from  224 events  to  274  PFS  events 
which  provided  at  least  95%  power  on  the  primary  endpoint  at  the  time  of  the  final  analysis. 
Increasing the number of required events (deaths) to 279 provides 90% power to detect a HR of less 
than or equal to 0.67 for the OS endpoint.  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/408292/2012

Randomisation 
Eligible patients were first stratified according to PS (0 vs. 1) and number of prior lines of systemic 
treatment for advanced disease: 0, 1 vs. 2+. Patients were then randomised in the placebo and 
treatment arms using a permuted blocks randomisation technique.  
Blinding 
The study was double-blind. 
Statistical methods 
Two  analyses  were  planned  in  this  study.  The  first  planned  analysis  of  the  study  was  when  the  final 
event  goal  (274  events)  for  PFS  endpoint  had  occurred,  and  mature  OS  data  (70%  of  the  required 
death events) was available for an interim OS analysis. The final analysis on OS occurred when at least 
the required number of death events (279) for the OS analysis accrued. 
Primary efficacy analysis of PFS 
The primary PFS analysis occurred after 1) at least 274 PFS events (progression or death by any cause) 
documented, 2) at least 195 deaths documented, 3) all subjects have been followed for at least 3 
months after randomisation 
The  primary  analysis  evaluated  PFS  within  the  Intent-to-Treat  (ITT)  population  (all  randomised 
subjects were analyzed in the arm they were allocated by randomisation). This analysis was performed 
using  the  data  from  the  independent  radiological  review  of  the  various  scans  from  the  disease 
assessments. 
Sensitivity analyses of PFS 
Ten pre-specified sensitivity analyses were performed for PFS as described in Table 7.  
Table 7. Summary of analysis of PFS – Primary and sensitivity analysis (VEG 110727) 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/408292/2012  
Page 15/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Subgroup analyses of PFS 
The following subgroups were explored in the analysis of PFS data by Kaplan-Meier analysis, log rank 
analyses  with  adjustment  for  stratification  factors  of  baseline  WHO  PS  and  number  of  prior  lines  of 
systemic  therapy  for  advanced  disease:  Histology  types  (leiomyosarcoma,  synovial  or  “other”  STS 
histologies), baseline WHO PS: 0 vs. 1, number of prior lines of therapy for advanced disease (0, 1 vs. 
2+), age: older or younger than 65 years, race (White vs. Asian/Other), gender, recruitment region:  
US,  EU/Australia  and  Japan/Korea,  standard  of  care  in  each  region  at  the  time  of  starting  the  study 
and tumour grade at initial diagnosis (post-hoc analysis). 
Post-hoc analyses 
Post-hoc  analyses  of  PFS  were  conducted  by  the  same  method  as  many  of  the  other  sensitivity 
analysis,  i.e.,  a  log  rank  analyses  with  adjustment  for  stratification  factors  of  baseline  WHO  PS  and 
number of prior lines of systemic therapy for advanced disease. 
Results  
Participant flow  
A total of 369 patients with STS were enrolled into the study. At the time of clinical cut-off, 1 patient in 
the  placebo  arm  and  18  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  remained  on  study  treatment.  Most  patients 
(96%) who received placebo discontinued study treatment due to PD, as compared to 68% of patients 
who received pazopanib. The other most common reasons patients in the pazopanib arm discontinued 
treatment were toxicity related to study drug (14%) and subject refusal/patient decision (5%). 
The participant flow is displayed in Table 8.

Conduct of the study 
The original protocol was approved on 23 June 2008 and has been amended twice as follows: 
Amendment  1  (19  June  2009):  Selection  criteria  were  modified  to:  allow  alveolar  or  pleomorphic 
rhabdomyosarcoma,  to  exclude  patients  with  nervous  system  metastases  or  leptomeningeal  tumour 
spread,  with  known  intraluminal  metastatic  lesions  in  gastrointestinal  system  with  increased  risk  of 
bleeding,  with  history  of  coronary  artery  bypass  graft  surgery  within  the  last  6  months  and  with 
endobronchial  lesions  and/or  infiltrations  of  major  pulmonary  vessels.  In  addition  one  of  the  major 
changes  was  the  increase  in  sample  size  from  255  to  360  patients.  Finally,  PFS  analysis  would  not 
occur until 3 months from the last patient first visit and the required number of death events for the 
interim OS analysis (195 deaths) had occurred. 
Amendment 2 (21 June 2010): The majority of patients in the study had received prior anthracycline-
containing  chemotherapy  which  poses  a  significant  risk  for  cardiac  dysfunction.  Since  decreases  in 
LVEF were reported in some patients participating in the study, additional data were to be obtained on 
cardiac risk factors and prior treatments. Additional guidance on the management of LVEF changes and 
cardiac dysfunction was provided. A description of additional data that were to be collected for cardiac 
events  and  clarification  on  the  timing  of  LVEF,  thyroid  stimulating  hormone,  and  free  T4  evaluations 
was provided.

Secondary endpoint: Duration of response 
The results of the duration of response are detailed in Table 16. 
Table 16. Duration of response-Independent Radiologist and Investigator Assessment 
(RECIST Criteria) (ITT Population) 
a.The duration of response will be restricted to the subgroup of the population who experience a confirmed 
response (Complete Response or Partial Response) during the study. 
b Duration of response is defined as the time from the first documented evidence of Complete Response or Partial 
Response until the first documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause, whichever occurs first. 
Exploratory endpoints  
EORTC QLQ-30 
Completion  rates  for  the  QLQ-C30  for  each  treatment  group  were  78%  or  greater  for  subjects 
remaining  in  the  study,  with  a  higher  rate  of  dropout  on  the  placebo  arm.  This  resulted  in  relatively 
fewer  QoL  assessments  available  at  Weeks  8  and  12,  for  the  placebo  arm  (47  and  28%)  than  the 
pazopanib arm (63 and 55%). The Mixed-Model Repeated Measures (MMRM) analyses of change from 
baseline  in  Global  Health  Status/QoL  showed  a  numerically  greater  decline  for  pazopanib,  but  no 
statistically  significant  differences  were  observed  in  this  analysis  between  pazopanib  and  placebo, 
across each of the 3 assessment time points.  
There  were  noticeable  differences  between  the  treatment  groups  in  mean  change  from  baseline  for 
several symptom scales across assessment time points, in particular these symptoms include: fatigue, 
nausea  and  vomiting,  appetite  loss,  and  diarrhea  with  subjects;  the  results  suggest  that  these 
symptoms were worse on pazopanib (data not shown) 
EQ-5D 
Completion  rates  for  the  EQ-5D  for  each  treatment  group  across  each  assessment  time  point  were 
greater than 82% at both screening and Week 4. The pazopanib and placebo groups were balanced at 
baseline  for  EQ-5D  domain  scores,  Utility  (Index)  and  Thermometer  (VAS).  Although  results  from  an 
analysis  of  change  from  baseline  adjusted  for  baseline  score  for  EQ-5D  VAS  numerically  favoured 
placebo, the results from these analyses did not show any statistically significant differences between 
treatment groups (data not shown).

The MAH has performed a “worst case time-to-treatment-failure analysis” where an event was defined 
as the earliest of progression or death in the placebo arm and as the earliest of progression, death, 
withdraw from study drug or withdraw from study (regardless of reason) in the pazopanib arm. Also 
the MAH conducted the analysis on the 3 major histology groups (leiomyosarcoma, synovial sarcoma 
and the group designated as “other”) according to the requested specifications on ‘worst case’ 
analysis. Both analyses confirmed a PFS improvement for the pazopanib treated patients (data not 
shown).

Supportive study 
VEG20002 
This was a Phase II, multi-centre, open-label, non-randomised study designed to evaluate the activity 
and tolerability of pazopanib in patients with relapsed or refractory STS, for whom no standard therapy 
existed.  Patients received oral pazopanib, 800 mg once daily, until disease progression, unacceptable 
drug-related  events,  intercurrent  illnesses  preventing  further  drug  administration,  or  patient  refusal. 
The study included a screening/baseline period, an open-label treatment period, and a post-treatment 
follow-up  visit.  The  study  enrolled  patients  into  4  different  strata  based  on  the  WHO  classification  of 
STS:  leiomyosarcoma  (uterine,  skin  or  non  organ  origin),  adipocytic  tumours,  synovial  sarcoma,  and 
other types of high or intermediate grade malignant STS. 
The key eligibility criteria were: patients with high or intermediate grade of STS that was relapsed or 
refractory  and  incurable  by  surgery  or  radiotherapy,  tumour  progression  per  RECIST  v1.0  compared 
with  a  prior  disease  assessment  during  the  past  6  months,  ineligible  for  chemotherapy  or  not  more 
than 1 combination therapy or 2 single chemotherapy agents for advanced disease, WHO PS of 0 or 1, 
and protocol-specified criteria for adequate organ function. 
The  primary  endpoint  was  progression-free  (PF)  rate  at  Week  12,  defined  as  a  binary  endpoint  with 
“success” equal to the number of patients with CR, PR or stable disease (SD)/ total number of patients 
based  on  the  disease  evaluation  performed  12  weeks  after  the  start  of  treatment.  The  secondary 
endpoints were PFS, OS, ORR, Time to response, and Duration of response. 
Thirty-seven patients could be recruited into each stratum in two stages: 17 patients in the first stage 
and  20  patients  in  the  second  stage.  After  treating  and  following  17  patients  for  12  weeks,  sufficient 
responses  were  seen  in  leiomyosarcoma,  synovial  sarcoma  and  other  types  of  STS  (“other”  STS); 
therefore patients with these types of sarcoma were enrolled into the second stage of these strata.   
A total of 142 patients with STS were enrolled into the study. The 142 patients consisted of 41 patients 
with leiomyosarcoma, 19 patients with adipocytic sarcoma, 37 patients with synovial sarcoma, and 41 
patients with "other" STS.

The key efficacy data from the supportive study VEG20002 is summarized in Table 20.

 Table 20. Key Efficacy Data from Supportive Study VEG20002 (ITT Population) 
2.5.2 Discussion on clinical efficacy 
Design and conduct of clinical studies 
The  efficacy  results  are  derived  from  the  pivotal  study  VEG110727  (n=369)  and  the  supportive 
VEG20002  study  (n=142).  The  pivotal  study  was  well  conducted,  with  no  problematic  protocol 
amendments and relatively few protocol violations.  
Efficacy data and additional analyses 
In the ITT population, a statistically significant improvement in PFS was observed in the pazopanib arm 
compared with the placebo arm. The median PFS in the placebo arm was 7.0 weeks (95% CI: 4.4, 8.1) 
in the placebo arm and 20.0 weeks (95% CI: 17.9, 21.3) in the pazopanib arm, with a corresponding 
HR of 0.35 (95% CI: 0.26, 0.48; p<0.001) as assessed by IRC. The 13 weeks improvement in median 
PFS  in  the  pazopanib  arm  as  compared  to  placebo  in  the  heavily  pre-treated  VEG110727  study 
population is statistically significant and exceeded the targeted improvement by over two-fold. Results 
of  pre-specified  and  post-hoc  analyses  provide  assurance  as  to  the  accuracy  of  PFS  determinations. 
Factors  which  may  have  confounded  PFS  in  favour  of  pazopanib  including  the  schedule  of  disease 
assessment and off-schedule assessments were systematically evaluated and found to have little effect 
on  the  observed  PFS  HR.  In  all  subgroup  and  sensitivity  analyses,  a  very  robust  and  consistent  PFS 
benefit  was  found  in  favour  of  pazopanib.    In  addition,  a  “worst  case  time-to-treatment-failure 
analysis” confirmed a PFS improvement for pazopanib treated patients. 
Although  few  objective  responses  by  RECIST  were  observed  with  pazopanib  in  VEG110727  (no  CRs 
and only very few PRs were seen), treatment with pazopanib almost doubled the occurrence of disease 
stabilisation (SD) which is also considered clinically relevant.  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/408292/2012  
Page 27/55
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The  final  OS  analysis  from  trial  VEG110727  (N=369)  showed  no  statistically  significant  difference 
between  pazopanib  and  placebo.  The  HR  only  numerically  favoured  pazopanib  (HR  0.87;  95%  CI: 
0.67,  1.12),  and  the  p-value  was  not  statistically  significant  (0.256).  The  trial  was  not  adequately 
powered to show differences in OS of less than four months.  
The synovial sarcoma histology subgroup only included 38 patients. This is why the efficacy results in 
this  subgroup  should  be  interpreted  with  caution  taken  into  account  the  wide  confidence  intervals  as 
well.  It  is  acknowledged  that  the  paradoxical  adverse  effect  observed  on  the  final  median  OS  in  the 
pazopanib  arm  as  compared  to  the  placebo  arm  could  have  arisen  by  chance,  possibly  due  to  the 
unusually  long  survival  of  patients  on  placebo  in  this  small  subgroup.  For  the  above  reasons,  the 
results of the subgroup analyses for OS have been included in section 5.1 of the SmPC and this issue 
has  been  addressed  in  the  RMP.  Finally,  due  to  the  small  numbers,  the  studied  biomarkers  and 
prognostic factors are unlikely to present an explanation for the observed phenomenon. 
The  possible  rebound  phenomenon  -after  stopping  pazopanib-  that  might  have  influenced  post-study 
survival  -  was  investigated  by  the  MAH.  A  rebound  effect  could  explain  the  lack  of  OS  benefit  as 
observed  also  in  the  VEG110727  study.  The  Kaplan  Meier  estimate  for  survival  post  progression 
showed that (median) survival seemed reduced in the pazopanib arm. 
No  statistically  significant  difference  in  QoL  was  overall  observed  between  treatment  arms,  but  for 
certain  specific  symptoms  (fatigue,  nausea,  vomiting,  appetite  loss,  diarrhoea)  the  placebo  arm  was 
favoured  in  absolute  numbers.  No  QoL  data  was  collected  after  progression  or  study  week  12.  There 
was  no  indication  that  pazopanib  had  a  negative  impact  on  the  PS  of  patients  in  an  exploratory 
analysis. 
Supportive  study  VEG20002  met  its  primary  endpoint  of  a  12  week  progression-free  rate  ≥  40%  in 
patients  with  leiomyosarcoma,  synovial  sarcoma  and  “other”  STS  treated  with  pazopanib,  thus 
suggesting  activity  of  the  drug  in  these  histological  subgroups  of  STS.  In  contrast,  the  response 
observed  in  the  adipocytic  subgroup  (2/17  patients  with  SD)  did  not  meet  the  response  criteria  in 
order to warrant further enrolment. As a consequence, patients with liposarcoma have been excluded 
from  the  confirmatory  VEG110727  study.  In  conclusion,  no  benefit  of  pazopanib  in  the  adipocytic 
subgroup has been proven.  
Based  on  the  above  and  the  inclusion  criteria  of  both  pivotal  and  supportive  studies,  the  indication 
does  not  include  patients  with  adipocytic  sarcoma,  embryonal  rhabdomyosarcoma,  chondrosarcoma, 
osteosarcoma,  GISTs,  dermatofibrosarcoma  protuberans,  Ewing  sarcoma/primitive  neuroectodermal 
tumours, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumour, and malignant mesothelioma. 
All  27  patients  who  were  unsuited  for  prior  chemotherapy  for  metastatic  disease  had  received  either 
neoadjuvant  or  adjuvant chemotherapy  and  progressed within  12  months.  It is  reasonable  to include 
those patients in the trial and have them encompassed by the indication. Neither the pivotal trial nor 
the supportive data support the inclusion of patients too frail for mono-drug chemotherapy. Therefore 
the indication has been amended accordingly to include that ‘‘patients who received only neo-adjuvant 
and/or adjuvant therapy should have progressed within 12 months’’. 
Very  few  samples  have  actually  been  available  for  biomarker  investigations  which  is  insufficient.  The 
potential  role  of  specific  biomarkers  for  patient  selection  and/or  monitoring of  treatment  is  unknown. 
At  present  the  MAH  has  no  plans  for  further  investigations  on  biomarkers  as  no  studies  in  STS  are 
ongoing.  Future  studies  are  still  under  consideration.    In  case  the  MAH  engages  in  further  studies  in 
patients  with  STS,  the  CHMP  recommended  that  the  MAH  includes  pre-specified  investigations  on 
biomarkers and measures on quality of life/symptom control as exploratory endpoints.

2.5.3 Conclusions on clinical efficacy 
The  CHMP  considered  that  both  studies  VEG110727  and  VEG20002  provide  robust  evidence  for 
clinically  significant  effects  of  second-line  pazopanib  treatment  in  patients  with  advanced  Soft  Tissue 
Sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy. 
2.6 Clinical safety 
The  safety  population  comprised  all  randomised  subjects  who  receive  at  least  one  dose  of 
investigational  product  (either  pazopanib  or  placebo),  and  will  be  based  on  the  actual  treatment 
received if this differs from that to which the subject was randomised. 
The  safety  database  of  pazopanib  in  patients  with  advanced  STS  includes  data  collected  on  382  of 
which 240 patients enrolled in the pivotal VEG110727 phase III study, and 142 patients enrolled in the 
VEG20002 supportive phase II study.  
The  date  of  data  cut-off  was  22  November  2010  for  the  pivotal  study  and  20  August  2010  for  the 
supportive study.  
Patient exposure 
In  the  pivotal  VEG110727  trial  240  patients  were  treated  with  pazopanib  (246  were  randomised  to 
pazopanib  but  6  patients  were  excluded  from  the  safety  population  as  they  did  not  receive  the 
allocated  treatment  with  pazopanib).  The  recommended  dosage  was  800  mg  once  daily.  Patients 
stayed longer on treatment in the pazopanib arm (median: 19.36 weeks) compared to the placebo arm 
(8.14 weeks). The summary of exposure for the pivotal study is displayed in Table 21.

In the uncontrolled, supportive VEG20002 trial 142 patients were treated with pazopanib at the same 
target  dose.  In  the  integrated  analysis  of  the  two  studies  in  STS  patients,  the  median  time  on 
pazopanib treatment was 3.6 months.  
Adverse events 
Common AEs 
In  the  pivotal  trial  enrolling  patients  with  STS,  99%  of  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  and  89%  of 
patients in the placebo arm reported  AEs. The most common AEs in pazopanib-treated  patients were 
fatigue  (65%),  diarrhoea  (59%),  nausea  (56%),  weight  decreased  (48%),  hypertension  (42%),

decreased appetite (40%) and hair colour changes (39%). In the placebo arm the most common AES 
were  fatigue  (48%),  nausea  (22%),  tumour  pain  (21%),  musculoskeletal  pain  (20%),  decreased 
appetite  (19%),  dyspnoea  (17%),  constipation  (17%)  and  diarrhoea  (15%).  In  comparison,  directly 
tumour-related  symptoms  and  some  constitutive  symptoms  occurred  with  a  similar  frequency  in  the 
pazopanib  arm  compared  to  the  control  arm  (tumour  pain:  29%,  musculoskeletal  pain: 23%, 
dyspnoea: 20%, constipation: 14%, pyrexia: 10%). 
The same pattern was observed in the pooled analysis across STS studies (including the pivotal study 
+ the supportive VEG20002 trial).  
Severity of AEs 
In  pazopanib-treated  patients  49%  of patients  reported  an  AE  of  grade  3  and  10%  an  AE  of  grade  4 
severity. The most common grade 3 events were fatigue (13%), tumour pain (8%), hypertension (7%), 
decreased  appetite  (6%),  dyspnoea  (5%)  and  diarrhoea  (5%).  Severe  events  were  also  reported  in 
the placebo arm ; 19% of placebo-treated patients reported a grade 3 event and 6% a grade 4 event. 
The  most  common  grade  3  events  in  placebo-treated  patients  include  tumour  pain,  dyspnoea  and

The following terms have been combined: 
a Abdominal pain, abdominal pain upper and gastrointestinal pain 
b Oedema, oedema peripheral and eyelid oedema 
c The majority of these cases were Palmar-plantar erythrodysaesthesia syndrome 
d Venous thromboembolic events – includes Deep vein thrombosis, Pulmonary embolism and Thrombosis terms 
e The majority of these cases describe mucositis 
f Laboratory abnormalities were reported as adverse events less frequently by investigators than these 
abnormalities occurred as indicated by laboratory value tables.  Certain laboratory abnormalities occurring in 
≥ 15 % of patients who received pazopanib and more frequently than with placebo in the randomised controlled 
trial for the treatment of STS (VEG110727; N=240) include Leukopenia (All Grades-44 %; Grade 3-1 %, Grade 4-
0 %), Neutropenia (All Grades-33 %; Grade 3-4 %, Grade 4-0 %), Thrombocytopenia (All Grades-36 %; Grade 3-
3 %, Grade 4-< 1 %), ALT increased (All Grades-46 %; Grade 3-8 %, Grade 4-2 %), AST increased (All Grades-
51 %; Grade 3-5 %, Grade 4-3 %), Albumin increased (All Grades-34 %; Grade 3-< 1 %, Grade 4-0 %), and 
Bilirubin increased(All Grades-29 %; Grade 3-1 %, Grade 4-0 %). 
Adverse events of special interest 
These  include:  Liver  chemistry  abnormalities  and  AEs,  hypertension,  cardiac  and  vascular  events, 
pneumothorax, thyroid function abnormalities, bowel perforations and enteral fistulae and proteinuria. 
Liver chemistry abnormalities and AEs 
In  study  VEG110727  bilirubin  (BIL)  and  alanine  transaminase  (ALT)  elevations  were  reported  in  5% 
and  18  %  of  pazopanib  treated  patients  (compared  with  2%  and  5%  patients  treated  with  placebo), 
with  ALT  elevations  >8x  ULN  in  13  (5%)  pazopanib  treated  patients  (versus  2  (2%)  placebo  treated 
patients).  Six  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  experienced  ALT  elevations  >20xULN:  3  patients  had 
Grade  4  ALT  elevations  in  association  with  fatal  SAEs;  all  other  3  remaining  patients  recovered.  The 
majority  of  ALT>3  ULN  elevations  (92.9%)  are  detected  in  the  first  18  weeks  of  treatment  with 
pazopanib.  
Incidence and time to development of liver chemistry abnormalities is consistent with previous data in 
RCC. 
‘Possible  Hy’s  Law  Criteria’  (defined  as  >3xULN  ALT  &  >2x  ULN  BIL  &  <3xULN  alkaline  phosphatase 
(ALP)  (or  ALP  missing))  were  met  by  4  patients  in  study  VEG110727  and  1  patient  in  the  VEG20002 
study.  In  all  these  patients,  there  were  confounding  medical  conditions  at  study  entry:  pre-existing 
biliary  disease  or  elevated  bilirubin,  pre-existing  drug-related  liver  disease  or  primary  disease  in  the 
liver. For three of these patients, measurement of direct bilirubin was performed at the same time as 
the  total  bilirubin  was  measured.  Two  patients  had  hyperbilirubinemia  predominantly  unconjugated. 
Samples  for  UGT1A1  analysis  were  available  for  2  of  the  3  patients:  one  patient  had  the  UGT1A1 
TA6TA7  genotype  and  one  patient  had  the  UGT1A1  TA7TA7  genotype  which  may  explain  the 
hyperbilirubinemia.  The  liver  chemistries  recovered  in  3  of  the  5  patients,  whereas  recovery  was  not 
demonstrated  in  the  other  2  patients.  Another  patient  met  Hy’s  law  criteria;  however,  the  laboratory 
values were only reported in the SAE form and not in the case report form.  Symptoms consistent with 
liver failure were observed in two patients in study VEG110727 but also confounding clinical events; in 
one patient a potential contribution of pazopanib could not be excluded despite the confounding effects 
of concomitant moxifloxacin and extensive malignant disease. In the other patient disease progression, 
Grade  5  pulmonary  embolus,  and  ischemic  hepatitis  were  the  causes  of  death.  In  VEG110727  study, 
another patient had ischemic hepatitis as a result of progressive disease with cardiac tamponade and 
extensive thrombosis, but no liver failure (no bilirubin elevation).

Across the STS integrated data (N=382), 54 (14%) patients had an elevation in ALT >3 x ULN. In an 
analysis performed overall liver enzymes elevations were reversible in 46/54 (85%) patients and ALT 
values  recovered  to  Grade  ≤1  (<2.5xULN).  Based  on  previous  data  in  RCC  the  recovery  was 
documented  in  91%  of  patients.  The  median  time  to  recovery  post  study  treatment  interruption  was 
22  days  (range  5-39  days).  Among  the  remaining  8  patients  (15%)  who  did  not  recover,  3  had  no 
follow-up data and their liver events occurred after discontinuing study for either progressive disease 
or  unrelated  toxicity.  Of  the  remaining  5  who  did  not  recover,  4  patients  with  fatal  AEs  had  ongoing 
liver dysfunction confounded by medical conditions and one patient was still on treatment at data cut-
off. 
Adaptation  (defined  as  return  to  Grade  0  or  baseline  levels  of  ALT  from  >3xULN  while  exposed  to 
study  drug  without  any  interruption)  was  experienced  by  10  patients  which  remained  on  study  drug 
despite  elevations  of  ALT  >3xULN  (and  <8xULN)  and  experienced  adaptation  while  remaining  on  the 
same  dose  of  pazopanib.  The  majority  of  these  patients  had  a  peak  ALT  ≤5xULN  (8  of  10  patients). 
The median time to adaptation was 46 days (range of 8 to 168 days). 
Re-challenge (restart of pazopanib at the same or reduced dose after interruption due to ALT ≥3xULN 
and subsequent recovery to Grade ≤ 1) was performed in 16 patients. Of these, 63% tolerated a re-
challenge without recurrent ALT elevation and 38% had recurrent ALT elevations. None of the patients 
with a positive re-challenge had an adverse clinical outcome. The data reported in STS are consistent 
with prior experience in RCC where 31 patients were re-challenged, 65% tolerated a re-challenge and 
32% had recurrent elevations, none with adverse clinical outcome. 
Hypertension 
In  study  VEG110727  on-therapy  AEs  of  hypertension  were  reported  in  101  (42%)  patients  in  the 
pazopanib arm and 7 (6%) patients in the placebo arm, with Grade 3 hypertension observed in 7% (16 
patients) and 0%, respectively. There were no reports of Grade 4 or Grade 5 hypertension. No SAEs of 
hypertension  were  reported  in  the  study.  However,  in  the  pazopanib  arm  hypertension  led  to  dose 
reductions in 7% of patients, drug interruptions in 10% of patients and permanent discontinuation in 
3%  of  patients.  No  incidence  of  hypertensive  crisis  AE  occurred  across  STS  studies.  Systolic  blood 
pressure  ≥  150  mmHg  was  observed 
in  96  (40%)  patients 
in 
the  pazopanib  arm 
(29 [12%] ≥ 170 mmHg)  and  13  (11%)  patients  in  the  placebo  arm.  Diastolic  blood  pressure  ≥  90 
mmHg  was  observed  in  134  (56%)  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  (15  [6%]  ≥110  mmHg)  and  22 
(18%) patients in the placebo arm.  
These  data  are  in  line  with  prior  experience  with  pazopanib  in  advanced  RCC  where  47%  of  patients 
experience hypertension of worsening of hypertension during treatment with pazopanib. Hypertension 
occurred  early  in  the  course  of  treatment  for  both  RCC  (88%  within  the  first  18  weeks)  and  STS 
patients (40.1% by Day 9 and 90.1% within the first 18 weeks). 
Cardiac and Vascular Events 
a) Myocardial Dysfunction 
Due  to  the  potential  prior  exposure  of  STS  patients  to  cardiotoxic  therapy  (i.e.,  anthracycline),  LVEF 
monitoring was conducted at baseline in VEG20002 and at baseline and Week 12 in VEG110727 study 
(with  later  amendment  for  monitoring  beyond  Week  12),  or  as  clinically  indicated.  Myocardial 
dysfunction was  defined  by  development  of symptoms  of  myocardial  dysfunction  or, ≥  15%  absolute 
decline  compared  to  baseline  or,  ≥10%  compared  to  baseline  that  is  also  below  the  lower  limit  of 
normal (LLN).  
In  study  VEG110727,  the  rate  of  AEs  of  myocardial  dysfunction  of  any  grade  was  higher  in  the 
pazopanib  arm  (9%)  compared  with  placebo  (5%)  before  adjusting  for  exposure.  The  exposure-
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/408292/2012  
Page 34/55
 
 
 
 
adjusted incidence rates (using a 100 patient-years rate) for myocardial dysfunction AEs of any grade 
were similar across the two arms of study VEG110727.  
The majority of myocardial dysfunction events were mild or moderate in severity and were reported as 
left  ventricular  dysfunction  based  on  decline  in  left  ventricular  ejection  fraction  assessments.  In 
VEG110727 study 4 patients in the pazopanib arm (2%) had Grade ≥ 3 events; no fatal events were 
reported. All events in the placebo arm were of lower grade of severity.  
Symptomatic  left  ventricular  decline  (congestive  heart  failure)  was  reported  in  2  out  of  382  patients 
(0.5 %) while asymptomatic decline was reported in the others. No fatal events were reported. 
In VEG110727 study, an analysis of LVEF decline from baseline was conducted in patients with at least 
one  post-baseline  LVEF  measurement.  Data  was  available  for  58%  of  patients  in  pazopanib  arm  and 
for  32%  of  patients  treated  with  placebo.  Among  patients  with  on-therapy  LVEF  assessments, 
decreased  LVEF  was  seen  in  15/140  (11%)  pazopanib-treated  patients  versus  1/39  (3%)  placebo-
treated  patient.  The  15  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  who  developed  left  ventricular  systolic 
dysfunction (LSVD) all had a normal LVEF at baseline and they had all previously been exposed to an 
anthracycline.  Only  3  cases  were  symptomatic  and  the  recommended  dose  adjustment  was  not 
performed  for  2  of  these  cases.  Eight  of  the  15  patients  either  continued  on  study  drug  without 
interruption  or  resumed  study  drug  following  interruption.  Six  of  the  8  patients  who  continued  study 
drug did so at a reduced dose of 600 mg (one of these had a second dose reduction to 400 mg). One 
patient, who resumed drug following an interruption, experienced recurrence of LVEF decline following 
resumption  of  pazopanib;  each  episode  of  LVEF  decline  preceded  by  hypertension.  Four  of  the  15 
subjects had full recovery (within 5 % of baseline) and 5 had partial recovery (within the normal range, 
but > 5 % below baseline).  Five patients had insufficient follow-up data; whereas one patient did not 
recover;  this  patient  had  several  cardiac  risk  factors,  and  died  in  hospice  with  terminal  care. 
Hypertension and/or requirement of new anti-hypertensive medication and/or dose modifications were 
observed in 13 of the 15 patients treated with pazopanib with LVEF decline. 
In  study  VEG20002,  where  LVEF  by  imaging  assessment  was  only  performed  at  baseline,  there  were 
no reports of AE of myocardial dysfunction.  
b) Arrhythmia 
In study VEG110727 the incidence of cardiac arrhythmias was 6% in the pazopanib arm and 9% in the 
placebo arm. Of these, 5 (2%) of pazopanib treated patients experienced QT prolongation of any grade, 
with 2 patients with grade≥ 3 events (QTc> 500 msec) without associated arrhythmias. There were no 
reports of QT prolongation in the placebo group. 
The  percentage  of  STS  patients  developing  cardiac  arrhythmia  AEs  from  the  integrated  pazopanib 
dataset  was  6%  which  is  identical  to  the  incidence  observed  in  the  pivotal  study  performed  with 
pazopanib in RCC. The incidence of AE of QT prolongation was 1% in the STS population, and Grade 3 
QT prolongation occurred in both the STS and RCC populations at <1%. There were no reports of AE of 
torsades  de  pointes  (TdP),  or  sudden  death  in  the  STS  patients.  However,  in  study  VEG110727  one 
fatal event in the pazopanib arm could have been associated with arrhythmia as he died at home and 
cause was unknown, although the investigator considered the event as related to disease progression.  
The exposure adjusted rate per/100 patient years (PY) for arrhythmia was 11.57 for pazopanib-treated 
patients in pivotal STS study and 6.85 in the pazopanib arm of the pivotal RCC study. In the placebo 
arm of STS study the rate was 29.21 compared with 6.39 in the placebo arm of RCC study.  
c) Venous Embolic and Thrombotic Events (VTE) 
In study VEG110727, 13 patients (5%) in the pazopanib arm and 3 patients (2%) in the placebo arm 
experienced on-therapy or post therapy VTEs. More specifically, 10 of these 13 patients on pazopanib 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/408292/2012  
Page 35/55
 
 
 
 
developed deep venous thrombosis (DVT) (including inferior vena cava (IVC) thrombosis and vascular 
graft thrombosis) without reports of associated pulmonary embolism (PE). Three patients treated with 
pazopanib  experienced  PEs,  with  a  fatal  outcome  in  two  of  them,  which  have  not  been  considered 
related to study treatment but to disease progression. The PE event experienced by the third patient 
was  an  incidental  asymptomatic  finding  at  a  tumour  assessment  showing  progressive  disease.  In  the 
placebo arm, 2 of the 3 patients developed DVTs (including renal vein thrombosis) without reports of 
associated PE, and 1 patient experienced a PE. 
In study VEG20002, 8 (6%) patients reported on-therapy VTEs. All events were non-fatal; 5 events of 
PE, 1 IVC thrombosis and 3 DVTs were reported. One patient had 2 events of IVC thrombosis and a PE. 
Of  the  5  events  of  PE,  two  of  these  were  diagnosed in  association  with  progressive  disease;  three  of 
the events were asymptomatic events diagnosed either at scheduled tumour assessments or by chest 
CT scan upon diagnosis of a DVT. 
The  exposure  adjusted  rate  of  VTEs  in  VEG110727  study  was  10.03  events  per  100  PY  for  patients 
treated  with  pazopanib  and  7.97  events  per  100  PY  for  patients  treated  with  placebo.  The  exposure 
adjusted  rate  of  VTE  was  9.84  events  per  100  PY  for  the  integrated  STS  population.  The  exposure 
adjusted rate of PE was similar in the placebo and pazopanib arm of study VEG110727. The exposure 
adjusted rates in both placebo and pazopanib treated patients in the STS integrated dataset are higher 
than those seen in the RCC population. The incidence of VTEs in pazopanib-treated patients was higher 
in the STS population (5%) than in the RCC population (2%). 
d) Arterial Embolic and Thrombotic Events 
In  study  VEG110727,  5  (2%)  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm,  and  no  patients  in  the  placebo  arm, 
experienced  arterial  embolic  and  thrombotic  events:  4  patients  experienced  Grade  1  to  Grade  3 
myocardial  ischemic  events,  and  1  patient  experienced  a  Grade  4  cerebrovascular  accident  85  days 
following the last dose of pazopanib that resolved 4 days later.  
In  study  VEG20002,  there  were  2  on-therapy  arterial  thromboembolic  events:  1  patient  had  Grade  3 
coronary artery disease, and 1 patient had a Grade 4 thrombosis of a mechanical aortic valve.  
The  exposure  adjusted  rates  for  arterial  thrombo-embolic  events  for  the  STS  integrated  dataset  was 
3.28/100 PY versus 3.85/100 PY to the RCC dataset.  
Arterial  thrombo-embolic  events  were  more  frequently  reported  with  pazopanib  than  with  placebo  in 
both STS and RCC studies.  
d) Haemorrhagic events 
In study VEG110727 the incidence of haemorrhagic events (all grades) was 22%  in the pazopanib arm 
and 8% in the placebo arm; the incidence rates of Grade 3 or Grade 4 haemorrhagic events were 1% 
or <1% and similar between the treatment arms. No patients reported Grade 5 events. Epistaxis (2%), 
mouth (3%) and anal (2%) haemorrhage were the most common categories of haemorrhage observed 
with  pazopanib.  Two  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  experienced  Grade  4  haemorrhagic  events:  1 
patient had abdominal bleeding (assessed as potentially related to study drug as well as to abdominal 
metastasis)  4  days  after  stop  of  study  drug,  whereas  the  second  patient  experienced  intracranial 
haemorrhage during treatment with pazopanib in presence of cerebral metastasis. 
In the integrated STS database haemorrhagic events (all grades) were reported by 75 (20%) patients, 
of which 4 (1%) patients had Grade 3, and 3 (<1%) Grade 4 events. No fatal events based on the pre-
specified MedDRA term list were reported. 
Based on the RCC database, 16% of patients reported haemorrhagic events all grades, and 2% Grades 
3 to 5 events.

Pneumothorax 
In  VEG110727  study  8  (3%)  of  pazopanib-treated  patients  versus  none  in  the  placebo  arm  reported 
on-therapy AEs of pneumothorax.  
Overall,  in  both  STS  studies,  15  (4%)  of  the  382  pazopanib-treated  STS  patients  experienced 
pneumothorax:  10  patients  were  Grade  1  or  2  events,  whereas  5  patients  reported  Grade  3  or  4 
events. At the time of clinical cut-off, 9/15 (60%) patients had recovered from the pneumothorax AE, 
additional 2 recovered with sequelae, and 4 patients had the event reported as ongoing. Of the 5 cases 
of  Grade  3  or  Grade  4  pneumothorax,  recovery  with sequelae  was  documented  in  3  patients  and  full 
recovery in 2 patients. The median time to first pneumothorax event was 40 days. 
In the pivotal RCC study 1 of 290 (<1%) patients treated with pazopanib developed a pneumothorax.  
Thyroid Function Abnormalities 
In study VEG110727, the incidence of thyroid function abnormalities (and/or aggravation of previously 
altered thyroid function tests) was 34% in the pazopanib arm and 2% in the placebo arm. Across the 
STS studies, 15 pazopanib-treated patients experienced concomitant elevations in TSH and decreases 
in  T4  (5  <TSH  ≤10  MU/L  or  >10  MU/L  and  T4  <LLN)  that  were  consistent  with  hypothyroidism. 
Laboratory evidence of hyperthyroidism (TSH <0.3 MU/L and T4 >ULN) was confirmed in 5 patients in 
the pazopanib arm, all from study VEG110727. Twenty (5%) patients in the STS studies reported on-
therapy AEs of hypothyroidism. Based on RCC studies a rate of 4% reported in the current prescribing 
information  for  pazopanib.  Two  STS  patients  (<1%)  reported  AEs  of  hyperthyroidism.  All  thyroid-
related AEs were Grade 1 or 2 in severity, and no SAEs were reported. 
Bowel Perforations and Enteral Fistulae 
Across  VEG110727  and  VEG20002  studies,  4/382  (1%)  patients  experienced  bowel  perforations  or 
fistulae.  All  these  patients  were  known  to  have  abdominal  metastases  at  study  entry;  for  the  2 
patients  with  perforations,  these  developed  at  the  site  of  metastatic  lesions.  One  of  the  two  patients 
died due to associated fatal peritonitis. Of the 2 patients with fistulas, one had a fistula at baseline and 
then  developed  another  during  study;  events  in  both  patients  resolved.  In  the  integrated  RCC  study 
data,  gastrointestinal  perforation  or  fistula  has  been  reported  in  5/586  patients  (0.9%),  and  fatal 
perforation events have occurred in 2/586 (0.3%). 
Proteinuria 
In  the  STS  studies,  proteinuria  was  reported  as  an  AE  for  2  patients  (<1%),  one  Grade  1  and  one 
Grade 2. An additional patient enrolled in study VEG110727 reported Grade 4 nephrotic syndrome with 
a concurrent SAE of increased urine protein/creatinine ratio (UPC) and was permanently discontinued 
from study treatment as a result.  
In  addition  to  AE  incidence,  regular  urinalysis  was  performed  in  both  STS  studies,  but  an  integrated 
analysis of urine protein/creatinine ratio data was not performed because this data was  not available 
for  VEG20002  trial.  In  study  VEG110727,  the  protocol  pre-specified  that  a  ratio  ≥3  prompted  a  24-
hour  urine  protein  collection  and,  if  the  urine  protein  was  ≥3  g,  treatment  was  interrupted  until  UPC 
returned  to  <3  and  then  restarted  at  a  lower  dose.  In  study  VEG20002  patients  with  a  24  hr  urine 
protein ≥2 g/24 hr had study drug interrupted and eventually resumed when reduced to <2 g/24 hr.  
In  study  VEG110727  3  patients  (1%)  in  the  pazopanib  arm  and  3  patients  (3%)  in  the  placebo  arm 
experienced  a  UPC  ratio  ≥3.  These  3    pazopanib-treated  patients  had  also  proteinuria  ≥3  gr  at  24 
hours urine analysis. All 3 patients had dose interruptions per the protocol followed by re-challenge at 
a lower dose. All three had repeat UPC ≥3 following re-challenge and were permanently discontinued 
from study.  
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

In  study  VEG20002,  7  patients  had  Grade  2  proteinuria  (1  -  2 gm/24  hr)  and  1  patient  had  Grade  3 
proteinuria  (5.05  gm/24  hr).  For  this  last  patient  no  subsequent  urine  protein  determinations  were 
available, as the patient discontinued study on the same day due to disease progression. 
In  studies  conducted  with  advanced  RCC,  proteinuria  AEs  were  reported  in  44/586  (8%)  patients 
(Grade 3, 5/586 [<1%] and Grade 4, 1/586 [<1%]).  
Serious adverse event/deaths/other significant events 
Deaths 
As  of  the  clinical  cut-off  date  (24  October  2011)  95  patients  had  died  in  the  placebo  arm  (77%)  vs. 
181 patients in the pazopanib arm (75%). The most common cause of death was progressive disease 
(165/181 deaths (91%) in the pazopanib arm vs. 86/95 (90%) in the placebo arm).

In the pivotal study seven Grade 5 (fatal) events were reported in 6 placebo-treated patients (5%) and 
nine  fatal  events  were  reported  in  8  pazopanib-treated  patients  (3%)  (Table  24).  In  the  pazopanib 
arm,  only  one  event  (multi-organ  failure)  was  reported  as  treatment-related.  However,  the  primary 
cause of death is not clear in all the cases. In comparison, the incidence of fatal SAEs was 4% in the 
pazopanib arm vs. 3% in the placebo arm in the pivotal study in the RCC indication. In the supportive 
study VEG20002, 10 patients had reports of fatal AEs. Three of these events were considered possibly 
treatment-related  (disseminated  intravascular  coagulation  (DIC),  depression,  peritonitis/peritoneal 
infection/small intestine perforation).

The incidence of patients reporting SAEs was 41% in the pazopanib arm compared to 24% the placebo 
arm in the pivotal study. Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 24% of pazopanib-treated patients 
and  in  5%  of  placebo-treated  patients.  The  most  common  SAEs  associated  with  pazopanib  were 
increased liver transaminases, pneumothorax, embolism, fatigue and left ventricular dysfunction.  
In  comparison,  the  observed  incidence  of  SAEs  was  24%  in  the  pazopanib  arm  in  the  pivotal  RCC 
study.  The  summary  of  SAEs  occurred  in  at  least  2  patients  in  either  treatment  group  in  the  pivotal 
study are displayed in Table 25.

Laboratory findings 
Haematology: Shifts in haematology parameters were consistent with observations in RCC patients. A 
higher  incidence  of  neutropenia,  leucopenia,  and  thrombocytopenia  occurred  in  pazopanib-treated 
patients  but  most  cases  were  mild/moderate  in  severity.  Grade  4  anaemia  occurred  in  2%  of 
pazopanib-treated patients.  
Clinical  Chemistry:  The  most  important  findings  are  liver  enzyme  elevations,  thyroid  function 
abnormalities and proteinuria that are mentioned under events of special interest. Most other shifts in 
chemistry parameters were mild in severity.  
ECGs: Patients enrolled in the pivotal STS study had no clinically significant ECG findings at baseline. 
Post-baseline  recordings  revealed  clinically  significant  ECG  changes  in  3%  of  patients  (6  patients)  in 
the pazopanib arm vs. 2% of patients in the placebo arm. Two pazopanib-treated patients had grade 3 
QTc prolongations without associated ventricular arrhythmias. Two patients had tachycardia. The last 2 
patients presented with cardiac ischemia and T wave/QRS abnormalities.  
Safety in special populations 
WHO PS status 
During  the  on-therapy  portion  of  the  study,  54%  of  patients  treated  with  pazopanib  vs.  35%  of 
patients  on  placebo  reported  deterioration  in  performance  status,  which  is  worse  than  what  was 
observed  in  the  RCC  population  (46%  of  pazopanib-treated  patients  vs.  35%  of  placebo-treated 
patients). As expected, a poorer PS was also associated with a higher incidence of Grade 3/4/5 events 
(65% in patients with PS 1 or 2 compared to 51% in patients with PS 0).  
Further to the CHMP request, two analyses (ITT population) to assess the dynamics of WHO 
performance status (PS) have been conducted by using the following 2 definitions in a ‘time to 
deterioration’ analysis : a) If the subject shows a 1 point increase in their WHO PS score from baseline 
which is then confirmed by remaining higher at the next visit or if a subject dies before this occurs, the 
subject is considered as experiencing an event at either the time of the 1 point increase or the date of 
death (the first occurring event) and b) If a subject shows a 2 point increase in their WHO PS score 
from baseline or if a subject dies before this occurs, the subject is considered as experiencing an event 
at either the time of the 2 point increase or the date of death (the first occurring event). For both 
analyses, if the subject didn’t experience either, the subject is censored in the analysis at the time of 
the last WHO performance status score.

Age 
The  overall  incidence  of  AEs  was  similar  between  patients  aged  <  65  years  (n=289)  and  65  years 
(n=93) across STS studies. Similarly, the overall incidence of severe events was comparable between 
these subsets (58% in younger patients vs. 57% in the elderly). There were 1% of fatal events in the 
elderly vs. 4% in the younger so there is no indication that elderly patients were more susceptible to 
severe  toxicities.  On  the  individual  AE  level,  AEs  like  fatigue,  hypertension,  decreased  appetite  and 
liver enzyme elevations occurred more frequently in the elderly whereas the younger reported a higher 
incidence of diarrhoea, vomiting, infections and tumour pain. Overall, 38% of the younger age group 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report

reported SAEs compared to 33% in the elderly. There was no specific accumulation of specific events 
in one or the other of the age groups. 
Gender 
Overall, no marked differences in AEs were noted between male and female patients.  
Race 
In  the  pivotal  study  pazopanib-associated  AEs  involving  the  skin  and  hair  colour  changes  were  more 
common in Asians than in White patients. On the other hand AEs of high grades of toxicity occurred at 
a slightly higher frequency in White patients.

No new information relevant to the proposed indication is available. 
Discontinuation due to adverse events 
In the pivotal study 20% of pazopanib-treated patients permanently discontinued therapy due to AEs 
compared  to  5%  in  the  placebo  arm.  The  most  common  AEs  that  led  to  discontinuation  in  the 
pazopanib  arm  were  ALT  increased,  dyspnoea,  left  ventricular  dysfunction,  fatigue,  hypertension  and 
vomiting. In pazopanib arm, 32% of patients had AEs that lead to dose reductions compared to < 1% 
in  the  placebo  arm.  Similarly,  50%  of  patients  treated  with  pazopanib  had  AEs  leading  to  dose 
interruptions compared to 10% in the control arm. The AEs most frequently leading to dose reductions 
and dose interruptions were fatigue, hypertension, nausea and diarrhoea. 
2.6.1 Discussion on clinical safety 
The safety profile of pazopanib has already been well characterized in patients with RCC and many of 
the  former  safety  findings  have  been  confirmed  in  patients  with  STS  but  important  differences  have 
also  been  noted,  including  development  of  pneumothorax  and  myocardial  dysfunction.  Although  the 
overall  tolerability  of  the  treatment  expressed  in  terms  of  mean  daily  dose  (approximately  700  mg) 
was  acceptable  and  similar  between  RCC  and  STS  studies,  the  mean  treatment  duration  (exposure) 
was  markedly  lower  in  STS  patients  (4.5  months)  compared  to  RCC  patients  (7.4  months).  In  the 
pivotal STS trial almost all patients in the pazopanib arm reported AEs (99%). A very high number of 
patients in the placebo arm also reported AEs (89%). This is indicative of the poorer general condition 
and the many physical symptoms that can be related to the underlying, advanced disease stage in the 
STS patient population. 
Common AEs associated with pazopanib in the STS population were fatigue (65%), diarrhoea (59%), 
nausea  (56%),  weight  decreased  (48%),  hypertension  (42%),  decreased  appetite  (40%)  and  hair 
colour changes (39%). These events were often severe; 49% and 10% of patients reported an AE of 
grade  3  or  grade  4  severity,  respectively.  The  most  common  grade  3  events  were  fatigue  (13%), 
tumour pain (8%), hypertension (7%), decreased appetite (6%), dyspnoea (5%) and diarrhoea (5%).  
The incidence of patients reporting SAEs was also relatively high in the pivotal study, particularly in the 
pazopanib arm (41%) compared to the placebo arm (24%). Treatment-related SAEs were reported in 
24%  of  pazopanib-treated  patients  compared  to  5%  of  placebo-treated  patients.  The  most  common 
CHMP Type II variation assessment report  
EMA/408292/2012  
Page 43/55
 
 
 
 
SAEs associated with pazopanib were increased liver transaminases, pneumothorax, embolism, fatigue 
and  left  ventricular  systolic  dysfunction  (LVSD).  In  comparison,  the  observed  incidence  of  SAEs  was 
24% in the pazopanib arm in the pivotal RCC study. Eight (3%) of patients in the pazopanib arm had 
fatal  grade  5  events  vs.  5%  in  the  placebo  arm.  This  is  in  line  with  what  was  observed  in  the  RCC 
population. The most common cause of death was progressive disease (91%) in both treatment arms.  
Pneumothorax and venous embolisms are newly identified risks in the STS population. Left ventricular 
systolic dysfunction (demonstrated as decreased LVEF) was also reported in the RCC population but it 
seems  to  be  a  larger  issue  in  the  advanced  STS  population  as  these  patients  have  often  been  pre-
treated  with anthracyclines  that  are  cardiotoxic.  It  appears  that  a  higher  percentage  of  subjects  with 
decreased LVEF had current or a prior history of hypertension. The development of hypertension and 
the resulting increased cardiac after load may lead to exacerbation of a subclinical decreased LVEF due 
to  previous  treatment  with  anthracyclines.  The  sections  4.4  and  4.8  SmPC  have  been  adequately 
updated  in  order  to  inform  about  potential  risk  factors  (prior  anthracycline  therapy,  concurrent 
hypertension). Interruption of pazopanib and/or dose reduction should be combined with treatment of 
hypertension in patients with significant reductions in LVEF. This information is reflected in section 4.4 
of the SmPC. Furthermore, a more detailed warning on cardiac dysfunction has been implemented in 
section  4.4  of  the  SmPC  in  order  to  reflect  that  the  risks  and  benefits  of  pazopanib  should  be 
considered before beginning therapy in patients who have pre-existing cardiac dysfunction, especially 
those  with  STS.    As  additional  pharmacovigilance  activities  the  MAH  will  send  targeted  follow-up 
questionnaires to healthcare professionals who report LVEF decreases during treatment with pazopanib 
in  order  to  increase  the  collection  of  background  details.  Furthermore,  LVSD  will  be  included  in  the 
future PSURs. These measures are considered appropriate. Finally based on data from the pivotal RCC 
study  (VEG105192),  the  rate  of  LVSD  was  very  low  in  the  RCC  population  (and  similar  across 
treatment  arms)  despite  hypertension  being  a  common  AE  in  the  pazopanib  arm.  However,  LVEF 
assessments  were  not  obtained  regularly  in  that  study  as  it  has  been  done  in  the  ongoing  study 
VEG108844  study  comparing  pazopanib  and  sunitinib  in  RCC.  Therefore  the  CHMP  recommended  the 
MAH  to  comment  on  this  particular  issue  when  submitting  the  CSR  from  study  VEG108844  in  June 
2013.  
Slightly  more  patients  in  the  STS  pivotal  trial  (20%)  discontinued  pazopanib  due  to  AEs  than  in  the 
RCC pivotal trial (15%).  
The  MAH  has  performed  an  exploratory  “time  to  deterioration  of  PS”  analysis.  Patients  who 
experienced  a  confirmed  1  or  2  point  increase  in  their  WHO  score  from  baseline  or  death  were 
regarded  as  events  whereas  other  subjects  were  censored.  Although  these  results  should  be 
interpreted  with  caution  since  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  stayed  longer  on  treatment  and  had 
slightly  more  PS  scores  than  patients  in  the  placebo  arm,  the  Kaplan-Meier  curves  displayed  a  very 
similar pattern in terms of deterioration in PS across treatment arms over time.  
2.6.2 Conclusions on clinical safety 
Many of the safety findings from the trials in RCC patients have been confirmed in the STS population 
but  it  appears  that  the  burden  of  the  treatment  is  heavier  in  patients  with  advanced  STS  who  are 
heavily pre-treated, constitutively more symptomatic, in a poorer general condition and consequently 
more  vulnerable  when  it  comes  to  treatment-related  toxicities.  Relevant  warnings  and  advice  to  the 
treating  physician  have  been  added  to  the  SmPC  on  myocardial  dysfunction  and  pneumothorax,  the 
two new safety signals that have been observed.  
Overall, the safety profile of pazopanib is still considered manageable and acceptable in the proposed 
indication.

Description 
Due date 
The MAH should continue to collect information regarding potential risk factors 
PSUR 
development of left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD) and discuss this issue 
submissions 
in upcoming PSURS. 
Based on data from the pivotal RCC study (VEG105192), the rate of LVSD was 
June 2013 
very low in the RCC population (and similar across treatment arms) despite 
hypertension being a common AE in the pazopanib arm. However, LVEF 
assessments were not obtained regularly in that study as it has been done in the 
ongoing study VEG108844 study comparing pazopanib and sunitinib in RCC. The 
MAH is requested to comment on this particular issue when submitting the CSR 
from study VEG108844. 
2.8 Changes to the Product Information 
The MAH proposed the following changes to the Product Information (PI), to which the CHMP agreed: 
Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC in order extend the indication of 
Votrient for the treatment of patients with advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS).  
During the procedure, the CHMP requested further amendments to the PI as discussed in detail above 
(see discussion on clinical efficacy): 
Update of section 4.4 of the SmPC to include a warning about increased risk of pneumothorax in STS 
patients treated with pazopanib.  
The Package Leaflet is updated in accordance.

2.9. Benefit-risk balance 
Benefits 
Beneficial effects 
In the pivotal trial patients treated with pazopanib demonstrated a median PFS of 20.0 weeks vs. 7.0 
weeks in patients treated with placebo by independent review. This results in a gain in median PFS of 
13  weeks.  The  HR  for  PFS  was  0.35  (95%  CI:  0.26,  0.48,  p<  0.001)  which  corresponds  to  a  65% 
reduction  in  the  risk  of  progression  or  death  in  patients  treated  with  pazopanib.  This  PFS  benefit  is 
considered  clinically  relevant.  Several  sensitivity  and  subgroups  analyses  consistently  support  the 
results of the primary PFS analysis.  
Response  rates  were  low  (11%  in  the  pazopanib  arm  vs.  0%  in  the  placebo  arm  per  independent 
review),  but  more  patients  in  the  pazopanib  arm  obtained  stable  disease  (54%)  compared  with  the 
control arm (27%).  
The supportive study VEG20002 showed activity for pazopanib and the endpoint as set for this study 
(progression-free rate ≥ 40%) was met in three out of the four histological subgroups of STS enrolled. 
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
According to eligibility criteria of study VEG110727 not only adipocytic sarcoma and GIST but also 
other histological subtypes of STS where excluded. The benefit of pazopanib in all these subgroups 
excluded from the study population is not proven, and therefore the benefit/risk is uncertain. 
Reference to these criteria under section 5.1 of the SmPC was considered appropriate to identify the 
target population.  
Response  rates  were  low  (11%  in  the  pazopanib  arm  vs.  0%  in  the  placebo  arm),  however  more 
patients in the pazopanib arm obtained stable disease (54%) compared with the control arm (27%).  
The  final  OS  analysis  from  trial  VEG110727  showed  no  statistically  significant  difference  between 
pazopanib  and  placebo.  However,  it  is  acknowledged  that  the  trial  was  not  adequately  powered  to 
show differences in OS of less than four months.  
In  terms  of  QoL,  a  numerical  trend  favouring  placebo  has  been  observed,  potentially  related  to  the 
negative  impact  of  pazopanib-related  toxicity  (in  particular  fatigue,  nausea,  vomiting,  and  diarrhoea) 
on  the  QoL  of  patients  treated.  However,  an  exploratory  analysis  of  “time  to  deterioration  of 
performance  status” 
including  both  on-  and  post-therapy  assessments  of  PS  reassuringly 
demonstrated a very similar pattern in terms of deterioration in PS across treatment arms over time. 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
Practically all patients treated with pazopanib reported AEs (99%). Common AEs were well-known and 
included  fatigue  (65%),  diarrhoea  (59%),  nausea  (56%),  weight  decreased  (48%),  hypertension 
(42%),  decreased  appetite  (40%)  and  hair  colour  changes  (39%).  Severe  events  were  also  seen 
relatively  frequently;  49%  and  10%  of  patients  reported  an  AE  of  grade  3  or  grade  4  severity, 
respectively. The most common grade 3 events were fatigue (13%), tumour pain (8%), hypertension 
(7%), decreased appetite (6%), dyspnoea (5%) and diarrhoea (5%). The incidence of SAEs was also 
high in the pazopanib arm (41%) compared to the placebo arm (24%). Treatment-related SAEs were

reported  in  24%  of  pazopanib-treated  patients  and  included  increased  liver  transaminases, 
pneumothorax, embolism, fatigue and LVSD. The proportion of pazopanib-treated patients experienced 
fatal grade 5 events was 3%.  
Newly identified risks to the STS population that have been associated with pazopanib are 
pneumothorax and myocardial dysfunction. Pneumothorax was reported in 15 (4%) of the 382 
pazopanib-treated STS patients. Congestive heart failure was reported in 2 out of 382 patients (0.5 %) 
in the STS population. Decreases in LVEF in subjects who had post-baseline measurement were 
detected in 11 % (15/140) in the pazopanib arm compared with 3 % (1/39) in the placebo arm.  
Both pneumothorax and cardiac dysfunction are considered as identified risks for pazopanib therapy.  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The  pathogenesis  and  the  clinical  relevance  of  the  myocardial  dysfunction  AEs  observed  in  STS 
patients  treated  with  pazopanib  are  not  completely  clear.  Routine  and  additional  pharmacovigilance 
activities  (see  Table  28  above)  are  expected  to  provide  further  information  on  the  these  adverse 
events. 
Benefit-risk balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects 
A  reduction  in  the  risk  of  disease  progression  or  death  of  65%  and  an  improvement  of  13  weeks  in 
median PFS represents an important benefit to patients. In addition, the benefit of PFS in the pivotal 
study has proven to be very robust in sensitivity analyses and consistent in subgroup analyses. 
The  characteristic  safety  findings  of  pazopanib  were  overall  similar  to  previous  findings  in  RCC 
patients, but the tolerability was poorer in patients with advanced STS. It appears that the burden of 
the  treatment  is  heavier  in  patients  with  advanced  STS  who  are  heavily  pre-treated,  constitutively 
more symptomatic, in a poorer general condition and consequently more vulnerable when it comes to 
treatment-related  toxicities.  Overall,  the  safety  profile  is  considered  acceptable  and  generally 
manageable.  
Benefit-risk balance 
A  reduction  in  the  risk  of  disease  progression  or  death  of  65%  and  an  improvement  of  13  weeks  in 
median PFS represents an important benefit to patients. In addition, the benefit of PFS in the pivotal 
study has proven to be very robust in sensitivity analyses and consistent in subgroup analyses. 
The safety findings of pazopanib were overall similar to previous findings in RCC patients. New safety 
concerns have been identified as well however these are generally manageable and relevant warnings 
with  very  detailed  recommendations  regarding  monitoring  and  further  lines  to  take  have  been 
adequate provided. 
Discussion on the benefit risk balance 
The benefit-risk balance for pazopanib for the treatment of patients with selective subtypes of 
advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma who have received prior chemotherapy for metastatic disease or who 
have progressed within 12 months after (neo) adjuvant therapy is considered positive as the

demonstrated statistically significant improvement of PFS outweighs the added toxicity of pazopanib in 
this target population with a high unmet medical need. 
4. Recommendations 
Based on the review of the submitted data, the CHMP considers the following variation acceptable and 
therefore recommends, the variation to the terms of the Marketing Authorisation, concerning the 
following change: 
Variation accepted 
C.I.6.a 
Change to therapeutic indication - Addition of a new 
therapeutic indication or modification of an approved one 
Type 
II 
Update of sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.3 of the SmPC in order extend the indication of 
Votrient for the treatment of patients with advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma (STS). The Package Leaflet is 
updated accordingly. 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP is of the opinion that Votrient is not similar to Yondelis within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/2000. See appendix 1. 
Additional data/Market exclusivity 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the data submitted by the applicant, taking into account the 
provisions of Article 14(11) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 and considers that the new therapeutic 
indication brings significant clinical benefit in comparison with existing therapies (see appendix 2). 
Paediatric Data 
Furthermore, the CHMP reviewed the available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed 
Paediatric Investigation Plan and the results are reflected in the Summary of Product Characteristics 
(SmPC) and as appropriate, the Package Leaflet.

Sections 4.2, and 4.9 
A cross reference to section 4.4 is added to highlight the 
risks in the case of treatment discontinuation. 
Section 4.4 the following text is added: 
Thrombotic Risk 
Abrupt treatment discontinuation should be avoided due to 
the risk of sudden increase in platelet counts, which may 
lead to potentially fatal thrombotic complications, such as 
cerebral infarction. Patients should be advised how to 
recognize early signs and symptoms suggestive of 
Page 2/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
thrombotic complications, such as cerebral infarction, and if 
symptoms occur to seek medical assistance.   
Treatment discontinuation  
In the event of dosage interruption or treatment 
withdrawal, the rebound in platelet count is variable, but 
the platelet count will start to increase within 4 days of 
stopping treatment with anagrelide and will return to pre-
treatment levels within 10 to 14 days, possibly rebounding 
above baseline values. Therefore, platelets should be 
monitored frequently (see section 4.2). 
Section 4.8 
Cerebral infraction is added as an AE with frequency 
unknown under Nervous system disorders with a cross-
reference to section 4.4

Section 5.2 Pharmacokinetic Properties, Biotransformation 
The effect of omeprazole, a CYP1A2 inducer, on the 
pharmacokinetics of anagrelide was investigated in 20 
healthy adult subjects following multiple, once daily 40 mg 
doses. The results showed that in the presence of 
omeprazole, AUC(0-∞), AUC(0-t), and Cmax of anagrelide 
were reduced by 27%, 26%, and 36%, respectively; and 
the corresponding values for 3 hydroxy anagrelide, a 
metabolite of anagrelide, were reduced by 13%, 14%, and 
18%, respectively.

The CHMP, having reviewed the evidence of compliance 
with the specific obligations and the impact of the data 
submitted by the MAH on the benefit/risk profile of the 
medicinal product, concluded that the Marketing 
Authorisation of Xagrid should be maintained. The CHMP 
also considered that all specific obligations have been 
fulfilled, that data on efficacy and safety can be considered 
now as comprehensive and therefore that the Marketing 
Authorisation should be switched, from a Marketing 
Authorisation under exceptional circumstances to a full 
Marketing Authorisation. Xagrid is also removed from the 
additional monitoring list as the conditions to the marketing 
authorisation have been fulfilled.

The platelet count will increase within 4 days of stopping 
order to change the terminology of 
myeloproliferative disorders to myeloproliferative 
neoplasms, add text regarding platelet count 
rebound above baseline following dosage 
interruption, incorporate a section in drug 
interactions on CYP1A2 inducers and update 
information on the mode of action. The Package 
Leaflet is updated accordingly. In addition, the MAH 
took the opportunity to update the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet, correct 
treatment with anagrelide and will return to pre-treatment 
levels within 10 to 14 days, possibly rebounding above 
baseline values. Therefore platelets should be monitored 
frequently. 
CYP1A2 inducers (such as omeprazole) could decrease the 
exposure of anagrelide increasing its main active 
metabolite. The consequences on the safety and efficacy 
profile of anagrelide are not established. Therefore, clinical 
and biological monitoring is recommended in patients 
taking concomitant CYP1A2 inducers. If needed, anagrelide

The precise mechanism by which anagrelide reduces blood 
platelet count is unknown. In cell culture studies, 
anagrelide suppressed expression of transcription factors 
including GATA-1 and FOG-1 required for 
megakaryocytopoiesis, ultimately leading to reduced 
platelet production.

The primary objective of study SPD422-403 was to 
study SPD422-403, a phase IIIb, randomised, open-
label study conducted as a specific obligation to 
compare the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of 
anagrelide hydrochloride versus hydroxyurea in high-
risk essential thrombocythaemia patients. No 
changes to the approved product information have 
been requested as a consequence of this study 
report. 
C.I.13 - Other variations not specifically covered 
elsewhere in this Annex which involve the submission 
of studies to the competent authority 
compare the safety of anagrelide and hydroxyurea in short 
and long term usage of up to three years with particular 
reference to cardiovascular safety (as assessed by 
echocardiography). 
Results confirmed observations in the previous 126-month 
safety update report. Reduction of platelet count under 600 
G/l was obtained with anagrelide and hydroxyurea. The 
decrease in median platelet count was faster and tended to 
be more marked in the hydroxyurea group. 
Safety data submitted in the final safety report are in line 
with the known safety profile of Anagrelide and the CHMP 
considered that no changes to the approved product 
information were necessary based on this report.

/metabolites are excreted in human milk. Available data in 
animals have shown excretion of anagrelide/metabolites in 
milk. A risk to the newborn/infant cannot be excluded. 
Breast-feeding should be discontinued during treatment 
with anagrelide. 
Fertility: No human data on the effect of anagrelide on 
fertility are available. In male rats, anagrelide at oral doses 
up to 240 mg/kg/day (>1000 times a 2mg/day dose, based 
on body surface area) was found to have no effect on 
fertility and reproductive performance. In female rats 
increases in pre- and post-implantation losses and a 
decrease in the mean number of live embryos was 
observed at 30 mg/kg/day. The NOEL (10mg/kg/day) to 
this effect was 143, 12 and 11-fold higher than the AUC in 
humans administered a dose of anagrelide 2 mg/day, and 
the metabolites BCH24426 and RL603, respectively. 
Embryofoetal development studies: Maternally toxic doses 
of anagrelide (60 mg/kg/day and above) in rats and rabbits 
were associated with increased embryo resorption and 
foetal mortality. In a pre- and post-natal development 
study in female rats, anagrelide at oral doses of ≥10 mg/kg 
produced a non-adverse increase in gestational duration. At 
the NOEL dose (3mg/kg/day), the AUCs for anagrelide and 
the metabolites BCH24426 and RL603 were 14, 2 and 2-
Page 10/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
fold higher than the AUC in humans administered an oral 
dose of anagrelide 2mg/day. Anagrelide at ≥60 mg/kg 
increased parturition time and mortality in the dam and 
foetus respectively. At the NOEL dose (30mg/kg/day), the 
AUCs for anagrelide and the metabolites BCH24426 and 
RL603 were 425-, 31- and 13-fold higher than the AUC in 
humans administered an oral dose of anagrelide 2 mg/day, 
respectively. 
Repeated dose toxicity: Following repeated oral 
administration of anagrelide in dogs, at doses of 1 
mg/kg/day or higher, subendocardial haemorrhage and 
focal myocardial necrosis was observed at 1mg/kg/day or 
higher in males and females with males being more 
sensitive occurred in dogs. The no observed effect level 
(NOEL) for male dogs (0.3mg/kg/day) corresponds to 0.1, 
0.1, and 1.6-fold the AUC in humans for anagrelide at 
2mg/day, and the metabolites BCH24426 and RL603, 
respectively.

Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit/risk balance, 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit risk balance of Xagrid continues 
to be favourable.  
The CHMP recommends a renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Xagrid under exceptional circumstances 
with unlimited validity. The outstanding clinical data that 
will be generated by the ongoing studies, included as part 
of the Specific Obligations, will provide additional efficacy 
and/or safety information.  
The MAH will continue to submit PSURs annually until 
otherwise specified by the CHMP. 
Following the recommendation from the CHMP, changes 
were made to the Product Information in section 4.4 to 
include a warning on the drug interaction with 
acetylsalicylic acid and alignment of the information in 
section 5.2 with the latest QRD template.

SmPC, Annex 
Based on the CHMP review of the available information and 
II and PL 
on the basis of a re-evaluation of the benefit/risk balance, 
the CHMP is of the opinion that the quality, safety and 
efficacy of this medicinal product continues to be 
adequately and sufficiently demonstrated and therefore 
considered that the benefit/risk profile of Xagrid continues 
to be favourable.  
The CHMP recommends a renewal of the Marketing 
Authorisation for Xagrid under exceptional circumstances. 
The outstanding clinical data that will be generated by the 
ongoing studies, included as part of the Specific 
Obligations, will provide additional efficacy and/or safety 
information.  
Following the assessment of the latest 6-monthly safety 
update report for these ongoing studies and following the 
assessment of the 6th PSUR, the data presented did not 
modify the benefit/risk of Xagrid. However, considering the 
adverse events reported the MAH was requested to closely 
monitor all cases of hepatic disorders, vasculitis, pulmonary 
fibrosis/interstitial lung disease, as well as all cases of 
benign or malignant neoplasms (including myelofibrosis), 
thrombohaemorrhagic events and cardiovascular events 
and to discuss such cases in future PSURs. 
The MAH will continue to submit PSURs annually until 
Page 21/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
otherwise specified by the CHMP. 
Therefore, based on the above presented 
Pharmacovigilance grounds, the CHMP concluded that the 
MAH should submit one additional renewal application in 5 
years time. 
During the renewal procedure, changes were made to the 
Product Information to bring it in line with the current 
EMEA/QRD template, SPC guideline and other relevant 
guideline(s), which were reviewed by QRD and accepted by 
the CHMP.

that no amendment of Annexes I and III of the Commission

Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and

This type II variation concerns an update of sections 4.4 
Package Leaflet 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
and 4.5 of the SPC regarding the effects of anagrelide in 
combination with acetylsalicylic acid on platelet aggregation 
in line with the results of study SPD422-110.  
This study was performed in healthy subjects and showed 
that co-administration of repeat-dose anagrelide 1mg once 
daily and acetylsalicylic acid 75mg once daily may enhance 
the anti-platelet aggregation effects of each drug compared 
Page 22/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
with administration of acetylsalicylic acid alone. Therefore, 
due to the lack of data in ET patients, the potential risks of 
the concomitant use of anagrelide with acetylsalicylic acid 
should be assessed, particularly in patients with a high risk 
profile for haemorrhage before treatment is initiated. 
Further, two paragraphs were deleted in section 4.5 of the 
SPC; one concerning an interaction study in the dog as 
results from experimental studies carried out in animals 
should not be included in this section according to the SPC 
Guideline; and one related to potential food interaction with 
grapefruit juice as it is a well known strong CYP3A4 
inhibitor, and not a CYP1A2 inhibitor. 
The Package Leaflet has been updated accordingly. In 
addition, the MAH took the opportunity to update the 
contact details for Belgium and Estonia in the list of local 
representatives in the Package Leaflet.

This variation concerns an update of sections 4.2 and 5.2 of 
Package Leaflet 
Update of Summary of Product Characteristics and 
Package Leaflet 
the SPC with information on elderly patients based on the 
results of study SPD422-203.  
Pharmacokinetic data from fasting elderly patients with 
essential thrombocythaemia (ET) (age range 65-75 years) 
compared to fasting adult patients (age range 22-50 years) 
indicate that the Cmax and AUC of anagrelide were 36% 
and 61% higher respectively in elderly patients, but that 
the Cmax and AUC of the active metabolite, 2-amino-5, 6-
dichloro-3, 4-dihydroquinazoline, were 42% and 37% lower 
respectively in the elderly patients. These differences were 
likely to be caused by lower presystemic metabolism of 
anagrelide to 2-amino-5, 6-dichloro-3, 4-
dihydroquinazoline in the elderly patients. 
The observed pharmacokinetic differences between elderly 
Page 23/30 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
and young patients with ET do not warrant using a different 
starting regimen or different dose titration step to achieve 
an individual patient-optimised anagrelide regimen. 
Further, the MAH has made editorial changes and updated 
the list of local representatives in the Package Leaflet.

This type II variation concerns an update of section 5.3 of 
Labelling and Package Leaflet 
Labelling and 
the SPC based on the results of Study R00812-SPD422, a 
PL 
104-week oral (dietary) administration oncogenicity study 
in the rat. Further, the Marketing Authorisation Holder took 
the opportunity to update the ATC code in section 5.1 of 
the SPC, to revise the contact details for Austria, Cyprus 
and Germany in the list of local representatives in the 
Package Leaflet and to update the annexes in line with the 
latest QRD template version 7.2. 
In this two-year rat carcinogenicity study, non-neoplastic 
and neoplastic findings were observed and related or 
attributed to an exaggerated pharmacological effect. 
Among them, the incidence of adrenal 
phaeochromocytomas was increased relative to control in 
males at all dose levels (  3 mg/kg/day) and in females 
receiving 15 mg/kg/day and above. The lowest dose in 
males (3 mg/kg/day) corresponds to 37 times the human 
AUC exposure after a 1 mg twice daily dose. Uterine 
adenocarcinomas, of epigenetic origin, could be related to 
an enzyme induction of CYP1 family. They were observed in 
females receiving 30 mg/kg/day, corresponding to 572 
times the human AUC exposure after a 1 mg twice daily 
dose. Currently, there is no clinical evidence that these 
findings are of relevance to human use.

were based on results from Study: SPD422-103 (severe 
renal impairment), Study: SPD422-104 (moderate hepatic 
impairment) and Study: SPD422-109 (Fed/fast states).  
Editorial changes have also been implemented. 
Anagrelide is contraindicated in patients with moderate or 
severe hepatic impairment and in patients with moderate 
or severe renal impairment (creatinine clearance <50

ml/min). 
The potential risks and benefits of anagrelide therapy in a 
patient with mild impairment of hepatic function should be 
assessed before treatment is commenced. It is not 
recommended in patients with elevated transaminases (>5 
times the upper limit of normal). 
Pharmacokinetic data from healthy subjects established 
that food decreases the Cmax of anagrelide by 14% but 
increases the AUC by 20%. Food had a more significant 
effect on the active metabolite and decreased the Cmax by 
29% although it had no effect on the AUC.

The MAH applied for a type II variation to update section 
5.1 (Pharmacodynamic properties) of the SPC to include 
revised recommendations for use in children based on the 
results of study SPD 422-202 (Children study).  
"An open label clinical study with a 3 month treatment 
period did not raise any safety concerns for anagrelide in 
17 children/adolescent patients with ET (age range 7-14 
years) compared to 18 adult patients. Earlier during clinical 
development a limited number (12) of children (age range 
5-17 years) with essential thrombocythaemia were treated 
with anagrelide." 
Further the MAH introduced consequential changes to 
section 5.2 (Pharmacokinetic properties): 
"Pharmacokinetic data from fasting children and 
adolescents (age range 7-14 years) with essential 
thrombocythaemia indicate that dose and body weight

normalized exposure, Cmax and AUC, of anagrelide were 
lower in children/adolescents compared to adults. There 
was also a trend to lower exposure to the active 
metabolite. These observations may be a reflection of more 
efficient metabolic clearance in younger subjects."

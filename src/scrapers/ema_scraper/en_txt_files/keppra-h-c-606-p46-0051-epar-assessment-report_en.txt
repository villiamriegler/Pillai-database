Introduction 
On Dec 15 2015, the MAH submitted the study, CIGE025ABR01 for Xolair, including paediatric 
subjects, in accordance with Article 46 of Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. 
Xolair is approved as add-on therapy to children 6-12 years of age to improve asthma control in 
patients with severe persistent allergic asthma who have a positive skin test or in vitro reactivity to a 
perennial aeroallergen and frequent daytime symptoms or night-time awakenings and who have had 
multiple documented severe asthma exacerbations despite daily high-dose inhaled corticosteroids, plus 
a long-acting inhaled beta2-agonist. A similar indication is approved for adolescents and adults. It is 
also indicated for adults and adolescents (12 years of age and above) with chronic spontaneous 
urticaria (CSU) refractory to standard of care. 
Study CIGE025ABR01 was a randomized, open-label, parallel group study conducted in Brazil. 
A short critical expert overview has also been provided. 
1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Information on the development program 
The MAH stated that study CIGE025ABR01 is a stand alone study. 
1.2.  Information on the pharmaceutical formulation used in the study 
Xolair, as approved in Brazil was used in this study.  
1.3.  Clinical aspects 
1.3.1.  Introduction 
The MAH has completed study CIGE025ABR01 (last patient last visit on 28-Apr-2010), which was a 
randomized, open-label, multicenter study to evaluate the effect of Xolair® as add on therapy to 
inhaled corticosteroid and long acting beta agonist compared to patients receiving inhaled 
corticosteroid and long acting beta agonist, on asthma related quality of life in subjects with severe 
persistent allergic asthma. This study was conducted at 18 centers in Brazil, and enrolled male and 
female patients >12 to < 75 years of age, with severe persistent allergic asthma who continued to 
demonstrate inadequate control despite regular treatment with ICS (≥500 mcg/day of fluticasone or 
equivalent) and LABA. Patients were randomized 2:1 to the Xolair group (Xolair added to ICS and LABA 
treatment) or the control group (ICS and LABA treatment).  They received treatment for 20 weeks.

patients with severe allergic asthma.  
Primary objective 
Assess the effect of Xolair compared to the control group on the mean change from baseline in the 
overall asthma related quality of life questionnaire (AQLQ)  
Secondary objectives 
1.  Assess the effect of Xolair compared to control group in subjects with severe persistent allergic 
asthma and verify the increase > 1.5 in AQLQ in both groups 
2.  Assess the effect of Xolair to increase > 0.5 and 1.0 in AQLQ compared to control group 
3.  Assess the difference between Xolair and control group in mean change from baseline in AQLQ 
score 
4.  Assess the difference between Xolair and control group in use of rescue medication 
5.  Assess the difference between Xolair and control group in asthma exacerbation episodes 
6.  Assess the difference between Xolair and control group in perception of treatment efficacy among 
physicians 
7.  Assess the difference between Xolair and control group in perception of treatment efficacy among 
subjects 
8.  Safety, including evaluation of parasitic (geohelminths) infection. 
Study design 
Study population /Sample size 
A total of 116 patients were randomized and made up the ITT population: 78 in the Xolair group and 
38 in the control group. Twelve patients discontinued and 104 patients completed the trial. Reasons for 
discontinuation included protocol violations (5 patients total, 4 in the Xolair group and 1 in the control 
group), adverse events (2 patients in Xolair group), “other” (2 patients in the control group), 
pregnancy (1 patient in the Xolair group), lost to follow up (1 patient in the control group) and 
administrative reasons (1 patient in the Xolair group).  
Most of the patients were female (approximately 76% in both the Xolair and control group). The mean 
age was 43.8 years in the Xolair group and 45.2 years in the control group. Two paediatric patients 
both ages 13 were enrolled in the Xolair group and completed the trial. There were no paediatric 
patients in the control group.

Treatments 
Subjects in experimental arm received Xolair at the dose of 150 to 375 mg (every 2 or 4 weeks), with 
mean dose equal to 249.0 ± 72.0 mg. Dose variation was not permitted. 
Results 
Efficacy results 
Primary endpoint 
Figure 1 AQLQ overall score. 
The mean ± SE change from baseline in AQLQ overall score was 1.0 ± 0.2 for the Xolair group and 0.2 
± 0.1 for the control group at Week 12. Differences between change from baseline AQLQ scores for the 
Xolair and control groups were significant (p<0.001). The mean ± SE change from baseline in AQLQ 
overall score was 1.3 ± 0.1 for the Xolair group and -0.1 ± 0.1 for the control group at Week 20. 
Differences between change from baseline AQLQ scores for Xolair and control groups were significant 
(p<0.001).  
In the Xolair group, the percentage of subjects who had an increase of >1.5 points from baseline on 
AQLQ overall score was 29.6% at week 12 and 41.9% at week 20. In the control group, this 
percentage was 11.4% at week 12 and 2.8% at week 20. The difference between the Xolair and 
control groups at week 20 was significant (p<0.001). 
In the Xolair group the percentage of subjects who had an increase of >0.5 points from baseline in 
AQLQ overall score was 67.6% at week 12 and 71.6% at week 20.  In the control group this 
percentage was 28.6% at week 12 and 22% at week 20. There were significant differences between 
the Xolair and control groups at weeks 12 (p<0.001) and 20 (p<0.001).  
There was no significant difference between the Xolair and control groups regarding the use of rescue 
medications or exacerbation episodes.

CHMP's comment: 
The efficacy results are difficult to interpret as this is an open-label study. The effect of omalizumab 
(Xolair®) in patients with allergic asthma was as expected. Of notice, the study was performed 
between 2007 and 2010. 
 Safety results 
In the Xolair group 56 (71.8%) patients were reported as having some adverse event. In the control 
group 22 (57.9%) patients were reported as having some adverse event. Sixteen events (7.7%) were 
suspected related to study drug.  Study drug was permanently discontinued in 4 patients in the Xolair 
group. These discontinuations were due to headache, insomnia, pneumothorax and pregnancy (1 
patient each).  In the Xolair group there were 3 serious adverse events (SAEs) - pneumonia, 
pneumothorax and pregnancy and no SAEs in the control group. The pneumonia resolved and was 
reported as relationship suspected to study drug. The pneumothorax resulted in the patient being 
hospitalized and the patient discontinued participation in the study. The pregnancy was followed until 
delivery and no congenital anomaly or birth defect was reported. Respiratory, thoracic and mediastinal 
disorders (27.4% of the AEs in the Xolair group and 22.9% in the control group), nervous system 
disorders (20.7% and 15.7%) and gastrointestinal disorders (10.1% and 14.3 %) were the most often 
reported SOC classes of adverse events.  Headache (18.8% of AEs in the Xolair group and 14.3% in 
the control group), rhinitis (4.8% and 8.6%) and sinusitis (5.3% and 2.9%) were the most commonly 
reported AEs. At week 20, the percentage of positive parasitic infection tests was 2.9% in Xolair group 
and 7.1% in control group (p > 0.05). There were no deaths in this study. 
CHMP's comment: 
No new or unexpected safety events were identified. Three SAEs were reported where one 
(pneumonia) was reported as probably related to the study drug. 
Paediatric summary 
There were 2 paediatric patients both 13 years of age randomized to the Xolair group. There were no 
paediatric patients in the control group. Both of these patients completed the study. Efficacy data was 
reported for the overall study population; efficacy was not reported separately for the paediatric 
patients. Available efficacy data from their individual case report forms reported the investigator and 
patients global evaluation responses as excellent and good at week 20.  Three AEs- upper respiratory 
tract infection, stomatitis, and fever were reported in one patient and 3 AEs- 2 reports of headache 
and foot sprain were reported in the other paediatric patients. All of these AEs were assessed as not 
being related to study drug. There were no SAEs reported in these two patients. 
CHMP's comment: 
The MAH has presented paediatric data as requested in legislation. Only two paediatric patients were 
included in this study, why no conclusion can be drawn on efficacy in the paediatric population. No 
SAEs were reported in these two pediatric patients. However, no listing of the paediatric patients could 
be found by the CHMP in the clinical study report.

2.  Discussion on clinical aspects and CHMP’s overall 
conclusion and recommendation 
Study CIGE025ABR01 was an open-label, noncomparative, post marketing study performed in Brazil. 
No unexpected findings were noted. The effect of omalizumab (Xolair®) in patients with allergic asthma 
was as expected and no unexpected safety issues occurred. Only two paediatric patients were included 
in this trial and no SAEs were reported for these patients. The presented data does not change the 
benefit risk for omalizumab in the paediatric approved indications. No changes are warranted in the 
SmPC. 
Overall conclusion 
The study report for Study CIGE025ABR01 has been provided as requested according to Article 46 of 
Regulation (EC) No1901/2006, as amended. There were no unexpected findings.  
Recommendation  
  Fulfilled: No regulatory action required.

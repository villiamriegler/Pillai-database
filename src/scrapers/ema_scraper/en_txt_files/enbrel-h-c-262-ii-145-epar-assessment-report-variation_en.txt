1.  Scientific discussion 
1.1.  Introdu
ction 
About the product 
Enbrel contains etanercept, which is a tumour necrosis factor- (TNF) inhibitor. Et
anercept is a 
recombinant protein consisting of human p75 tumour nec
rosis factor receptor (TNFR) fused to the 
crystallisable fragment (Fc) of human immunoglobulin G1. Etanercept acts as a sol
uble receptor, which 
binds both TNF and TNFß (lymphotoxin), and prevents them fr
om binding to their target receptors on 
the surfaces of cells thus preventing TNF-mediated cellular responses.  
TNF is a cytokine in the inflammatory process of various autoimmune diseases, in
cluding rheumatoid 
arthritis (RA) in adults other diseases such as juvenile idiopathi
c arthritis (JIA). 
Etanercept is authorised for use in rheumatoid arthritis, polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis in 
children aged 2 to 17 years, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, plaque psor
iasis in adults and 
paediatric plaque psoriasis in children and adolescents from the 
age of 6 years. 
Problem statement 
Etanercept is authorized in the European Union (EU) for use in the treatment of 
active polyarticular 
juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children and adolescents from the age of 2 yea
rs who have had an 
inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate (MTX)
. 
The 2 studies contributing data to this variation include study 0881A1-3338-WW (re
ferred to at study 
3338; also known as study B1801014) and study 20021618. The Part 1 (W
eek 12) results from study 
3338 for children and adolescents with extended oligoarticular JIA (eoJIA) from 
the age of 2 years, 
children and adolescents with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) from the age of 1
2 years and children 
and adolescents with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) from the age of 12 years are presented i
n the Part 1 
(Week 12) clinical study report (CSR). Part 2 of study 3338 (96 weeks) is currently
 ongoing.  
The final 10-year results from study 20021618 for subjects with polyarticular-course JIA (polyarticular, 
pauciarticular-, or s
ystemic-onset) aged 4 to 17 years are presented in the Final CSR. If the 
International League of Associations for Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria are retr
ospectively applied to 
study 20021618 then there would be minimal overlap between the JIA popul
ations in the 2 studies. 
There were no subjects in study 20021618 who would appear to have met the ILA
R criteria for ERA or 
PsA; however, the subjects with pauciarticular-onset JIA (n=5) in study 2002161
8 would likely be 
classified as eoJIA patients. Due to the lack of data in these 3 additional JIA subtyp
es, study 3338 was 
conducted to further characterize them.   
Scope of the variation  
The purpose of this variation application is to extend the JIA indication for etanercept to include 
children and adolescents with extended oligoarticular JIA from the age of 2 years, children and 
adolescents with enthesitis-related arthritis (ERA) from the age of 12 years and children and 
adolescents with psoriatic arthritis (PsA) from the age of 12 years, together with reclassification of the 
licensed indication of polyarticular JIA into the ILAR classification of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor 
positive) and polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor negative). Furthermore, an additional etanercept dosage 
regimen of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) once weekly (QW) is being proposed in 
addition to the current approved JIA dosage of 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose) BIW 
for the treatment of JIA. An etanercept dosage of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 50 mg per dose) 
Assessment report  
EMA/548283/2012  
Page 2/63 
 
QW is currently approved in children and adolescents with plaque psoriasis. No changes will be made 
to the etanercept formulation for the treatment of JIA. 
The subdivision of the JIA subtypes on the basis of the revised ILAR criteria overcom
es the limitation of 
the old classification where a subject with e.g. polyarticular course JIA could have
 had a different 
classification for the onset of the disease; e.g. systemic onset polyarticular cours
e JIA which differed in 
terms of AE profile and response to etanercept compared with those who had ei
ther oligo articular or 
polyarticular onset. The sensitivity analysis for efficacy done by the MAH in support
 of the previous 
extension of age range for JIA from 4 years down to 2 years (variation II
/126 approved in August 
2011) excluded subjects who had systemic onset polyarticular course JIA. The re
vised classification 
removes this possible source of confusion and the principle of this classification is
 that all categories of 
JIA are mutually exclusive and based on the disease characteristics in the first six m
onths. 
The older studies were performed before the revised ILAR classification and the MAH provided long 
term safety data in subjects with polyarticul
ar JIA (now classifiable as Polyarthritis (RF positive) and 
Polyarthritis (RF neg
ative)). In addition the MAH conducted a new study in the JIA subtypes of Psoriatic 
arthritis, Enthesitis-related arthritis and Oligoarth
ritis (extended subtype). 
Below is the ILAR classification list of sub
types of JIA.  
  Systemic arthritis 
  Oligoarthritis (presi
stent subtype/ extended subtype) 
 
 
 
Polyarthritis (RF n
egative)(already licensed) 
Polyarthritis (RF positive) (already licensed) 
Psoriatic arthritis 
  Enthesitis related arthritis  
  Undifferentiated arthritis 
As the majority of patients from older trials could be 
re-classified as predominantly polyarthritis (RF 
neg or RF pos) then these subtypes are alrea
dy licensed from the age of 2 years.   
Enbrel is licensed for psoriatic arthritis and ankylosing spondylitis (AS) in adults. The main focus of this 
variation is to assess the evidence provided in support of efficacy in the follow
ing subtypes and age 
groups: 
  Extended oligoarthiris (from the age of 2 years)  
  Enthesitis related arthritis (from the age of 12 -18 years)  
 
Psoriatic arthritis (from the age of 12-18 years)

1.2.2.  GCP  
The Clinical trials
 submitted in support of this variation were performed in accordance with GCP as 
claimed by the MAH.  
The MAH has provided a statement to the effect that clinical trials conducted outside the 
Community were carried 
out in accordance with the ethical standards of Directive 2001/20/EC. 
1.2.3.  Pharmacokinetics 
The approved dosage forms of etanercept include powder and solvent for solution
 for injection, solution 
for injection in a prefilled syringe and solution for injection in a prefille
d pen. All etanercept dosage 
forms are intended for subcutaneous (SC) injection. For the treatment of active
 polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA) in children and adolescents from the age of 2 years
, the approved dosage of 
etanercept is 0.4 mg/kg (up to a maximum of 25 mg per dose) twice weekly (BIW)
.  
The formulation of etanercept used in study 0881A1-3338-WW (3338) was identical
 to the 25 mg 
powder and solvent for solution for injection that is currently approved in the Europ
ean Union 
(EU/1/99/126/003), in which the contents of the vials are reconstituted with ster
ile water for injection. 
Study 20021618 was conducted in North America and used the same powder
 for solution; however, it 
was reconstituted in bacteriostatic water for injection rather than sterile water fo
r injection. The 
dosage regimen used in study 3338 was 0.8 mg/kg QW (up to a maximum dose of 50 mg),
 identical to 
the approved regimen for the treatment of paediatric psoriasis; each injection contained a maximum of 
25 mg of etanercept reconstituted in 1 ml of sterile water. Although paediatric subje
cts who entered 
study 20021618 initially continued with the etanercept dose administered in d
ouble-blind study 
16.0016 (0.4 mg/kg etanercept BIW up to a maximum dose of 25 mg per injecti
on), the 0.8-mg/kg 
weekly dose (maximum dose of 50 mg per week) could be administered as two 0
.4-mg/kg SC 
injections either on the same day or 3 to 4 days apart, or as a single 0.8-mg/kg i
njection QW. 
It should also be noted that the dosage regimen used in registry 20021626 was 0.8
 mg/kg QW, up to a 
maximum dose of 50 mg. This Study 20021626 was an open-label, multicenter r
egistry for children 
aged 2 to 18 years with a diagnosis of polyarticular-course or systemic JIA. The objecti
ve of the 
registry was to determine the long-term safety of etanercept administered with or w
ithout MTX 
compared to MTX alone in paediatric subjects with polyarticular-course or system
ic JIA. This was the 
basis to extend the lower age range for the approved therapeutic in
dication for polyarticular juvenile 
idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Furthermore, in the SmPC of Enbrel the following statement i
s included: 
“...Patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis (aged 4 to 17 years) were administered
 0.8 mg/kg (up to a 
maximum dose of 50 mg per week) of etanercept once weekly for up to 48 we
eks. The mean serum 
steady-state trough concentrations ranged from 1.6 to 2.1 mcg/ml at weeks 12, 24,
 and 48. These 
mean concentrations in patients with paediatric plaque psoriasis were similar to the concentrations 
observed in patients with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (treated with 0.4 mg/kg etanerce
pt twice weekly, 
up to maximum dose of 50 mg per week). These mean concentrations were similar to those seen in 
adult patients with plaque psoriasis treated with 25 mg etanercept twice-weekly...”. 
Data in adults have shown that the same total weekly dose provides similar exposure when 
administered as either QW or BIW doses for both RA and psoriasis.5 Simulation using data collected in 
children with JIA shows that QW dosing would be expected to have steady-state peak and trough 
etanercept concentrations 11% higher and 18% lower, respectively, compared with BIW dosing with a 
large overlap of concentration profiles at steady state. 
A comprehensive population pharmacokinetic analysis of the available data in children has not been 
performed as was done in adults. Nonetheless, the clinical results of the current studies (3338 and 
Assessment report  
EMA/548283/2012  
Page 5/63
 
 
 
 
 
20021618), in which etanercept was administered at weekly intervals in 0.8 mg/kg 
doses, along with 
the available pharmacokinetic and clin
ical data in children with JIA and paediatric psoriasis, support the 
approval of the 0.8 mg/kg QW dosage regimen. 
Discussion on clinical pharmacology 
The 0.8 mg/kg dose once weekly is therefore considered acceptable as the PK data from adults support 
similar PK profiles comparing 0.4 mg/kg twice weekly and 0.8 mg/kg once weekl
y; the use of 
0.8  mg/kg in paediatric plaque psoriasis is already lice
nsed; the data from Study 20021626 and the 
current trial 3338 (week 12 data provided in support of this application) was derived with a 0.8 mg/kg 
once weekly dosing and also fro
m published literature in support of once weekly posology in JIA. In 
addition the requirement for fewer injections in children is endorsed. 
Conclusion on clinica
l pharmacology 
From  a  pharmacokinetic  point  of  view  the  introdu
ction  of  the  0.8  mg/kg  dose  once  weekly  dosing 
scheme is considered acceptable.

Study 3338: A 2-Part Open-Label Study to Assess the Clinical Benefit and Long-Term Safety of 
Etanercept in Children and Adolescents With Extended Oligoarticular Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis, 
Enthesitis-Related Arthritis, or Psoriatic Arthritis (Part 1: Week-12 Analysis) 
Methods 
Study 3338 is a phase 3b, single-treatment, open-label, 2-part, m
ulticenter study of etanercept in 
children and adolescents with eoJIA 
from the age of 2 years, children and adolescents with ERA from 
the age of 12 years, and children and adolescents with PsA from the age of 12 years.  
Study Participants 
To be eligible for enrollment, subjects had to meet the Internat
ional League of Associations for 
Rheumatology (ILAR) criteria for diagnosis of one of the following JIA subtypes before the screening 
visit and must be within the specified age range at the time of the screening visit: 
(1) eoJIA between the ages of 2 and 17 years. 
(2) ERA between the ages of 12 and 17 years; or  
(3) PsA between the ages of 12 and 17 years.  
Subjects with systemic JIA, persistent oligoarticular JIA, rheumatoid factor positive or negative 
polyarticular JIA, or un-differentiated arthritis per ILAR criteria were excluded. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548283/2012  
Page 6/63
 
 
 
 
 
 
Treatments 
All subjects were re
ceiving etanercept 0.8 mg/kg once weekly (QW) subcutaneously (to a maximum 
dose of 50 mg QW) throughout the course of their participation in study 3338 unless withdrawal of 
treatmen
t is warranted.  
Objectives 
The primary objective of Part 1 (12 weeks) of the study was to assess the clinical benefit of etanercept 
in subjects with eoJIA, ERA, or PsA. The secondary objective of Part 1 (12 weeks) was to assess the 
effect of etanercept on safety and physical functioning in subjects with eoJIA, E
RA, or PsA.  
The primary objective of Part 2 (96 weeks) wil
l be to assess the long-term safety of etanercept. All 
subjects who receive at least 1 dose of investigational product, including those who prematurely 
withdraw from inv
estigational product, will be followed for 96 weeks in this study. Once subjects 
complete 96 weeks of investigational product and/or follow-up in study 3338, they will
 be asked to 
participate in the long-term extension study (B1801023).  
Outcomes/endpoints 
The main (primary) endpoint for evaluation of clinical benefit in the combined population in study 3338 
was the proportion of subjects meeting the A
merican College of Rheumatology (ACR) Paediatric 30 
(Pedi 30) criteria at week 12, defined as ≥3
0% improvement from baseline in at least 3 of 6 of the 
following variables, with worsening >30% in no more than 1 of these variables:
1. Physician’s Global Assessment (PGA) of disease activity on a 21-circle Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) 
2. Parent/Patient Global Assessment on a 21-circle V
AS 
3. Childhood Health Assessment Questionnaire (CHAQ) 
4. Number of active joints, defined as joints w
ith swelling or, in the absence of swelling, joints with 
limitation of motion (LOM) with pain and/or tenderness 
5. Number of joints with LOM 
6. Laboratory measure of inflamm
ation (C-reactive protein [CRP]) 
Additional assessments of clinical benefit in the c
ombined population included: 
  ACR Pedi 30 at all time points other than week 12 
  ACR Pedi 50, 70, 90, and 100 
 
 
PGA of disease activity on a 21-circle VAS

  Disease status, where inactive disease is defined as no joints with active arthritis, a normal 
CRP, and a PGA of Disease Activity of 0 on a 21-circle VAS 
  Health outcomes assessment: physical functioning as evaluated by the 
CHAQ 
The above as
sessments of clinical benefit were also performed in each of the eoJIA, ERA, and PsA 
subpopulations. The following additional disease-specific endpoints were assessed
 in the ERA and PsA 
subpopulations: 
 
For subjects with ERA: Tender Entheseal Assessment; Overall Back Pain and Nocturnal Back 
Pa
in; and Modified Schober’s test. 
 
For subjects with PsA: body surface area (BSA) affected by psoriasis; a
nd PGA of psoriasis. 
Sample size 
The sample size was not based on any statistica
l hypothesis testing or power calculations. It was 
anticipated that approximately 100 subjects overall would be enrolled in this study
. With this sample 
size, the half-width of the 95% CI would be no more than 10% for estim
ation of the ACR Pedi 30 
response rate. 
Approximately 100 subjects were to be en
rolled as follows: 
Extended oligoarticular JIA: minimum of 35 subjects. 2 to 4 years of age: mi
nimum of 2 subjects 5 to 
11 years of a
ge: minimum of 18 subjects 12 to 17 years of age: minimum of 15 subjects 
ERA: 12 to 17 years of age
: minimum of 20 subjects 
PsA: 12 to 17 ye
ars of age: minimum of 20 subjects 
No more than 10% of the overall
 study population was to be enrolled at a single site. 
Randomisation 
This was a non-randomized study. 
Blinding (masking) 
This was an open-label study. 
Statistical methods 
The pri
mary population for efficacy analysis was the modified intent to treat (mITT) po
pulation, which 
is defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product. The secondary 
population for efficacy analysis was the per-protocol population (valid for efficacy [VFE] population). 
The VFE population is a subset of the mITT population, excluding subjects who had major protocol 
deviations that were determined by the sponsor’s clinical team to be likely to have a substantial impact 
on efficacy at any time point in Part 1 of the study. 
For the ACR Pedi 30, 50, 70, 90, and 100 response rates at each time point in Part 1 of the study, 
sensitivity analyses were also performed using the following imputation methods for missing data: 
- Last observation carried forward (LOCF) imputation for missing ACR Pedi values. This 
approach was applied to all visits missing ACR Pedi data. Baseline values, however, were not 
Assessment report  
EMA/548283/2012  
Page 8/63
 
 
 
 
 
carried forward. For the LOCF analysis, imputation was applied to the 6 components separately 
before assigning the ACR
 Pedi response status. 
- Non-responder imputation (NRI) 
The study 0881A1-3338 ACR Pedi 30 response rates at Week 12 were compared as 
follows with the 
prospectively selected historical placebo control data. 
An odds ratio and corresponding 95% CI was computed for the overall population as well as for each of 
the 3 JIA subtypes versus the historical placebo mean composite endpoint response
 rate from the 
meta-analysis of 6 JIA studies by Ruperto et al. 
Two (2) methods were used for the comparison of ACR Pedi 30 response rates to t
he historical placebo 
control data: the 6 studies included in the meta-analysis were treated indivi
dually in the logistic 
regression model (adjusted) and were pooled as one (unadjusted). 
For the ERA subtype, an additional analysis was conducted in a similar manner us
ing the ACR Pedi 30 
placebo response rate from the Burgos-Vargas study of juvenile-onset spondyloart
hropathies. 
The initial 12-week open-label period ACR Pedi 30 response rate from the etan
ercept study 16.0016 of 
polyarticular-course JIA subjects was us
ed as an active historical control. The response rate from the 
overall population as well as each of the 3 JIA subtypes was compared with the eta
nercept response 
rate from study 16.0016, adjusting for selected baseline charac
teristics in a logistic regression model. 
The logistic regression analyses included the following factors: baseline age, sex, duration of disease at 
study en
try, age of disease onset, the baseline values of all 6 ACR Pedi 30 components. The odds 
ratios and cor
responding 95% CIs were provided. 
All safety analyses were based on the safety population, which was the same as th
e mITT population, 
defined as all subjects who received at least 1 dose of investigational product. 
Results  
Participant flow  
A total of 127 subjects were enrolled and received at least 1 dose of investigational product. The mITT 
and safety populations include these 127 subjects: 60 subjects with extended oligoarticular JIA, 38 
subjects with ERA, and 29 subjects with PsA. The mITT and safety population for subjects with eoJIA 
consisted of 15 subjects in the 2- to 4-year age group, 23 subjects in the 5- to 11-year age group, and 
22 subjects in the 12- to 17-year age group. 
Table 1. Number of Subjects in Each Analysis Population 
Five (5) subjects (3.9%) were withdrawn from investigational product prior to completion of Part 1 
(Week 12) of the study; 4 subjects were withdrawn due to AEs and 1 subject was withdrawn due to a 
protocol violation.

Table 2. Summary of Subject Participation Status for Part 1 
Recruitment 
The study was conducted at 38 centers in 19 countries in Europe, Latin America, and Australia. Twelve 
(12) centers in 6 countries received investigational product but did not enroll any s
ubjects. The First 
Subject First Visit (FSFV) was 23 November 2009. The date of the last subject last
 visit for the Part 1 
Week-12 analysis was 15 June 2011. 
Conduct of 
the study 
Prio
r to the last subject last visit (LSLV) for Part 1 of th
e study, 2 protocol amendments were finalized 
and
 approved for use at study sites. Amendment 1 was a global amendmen
t and Amendment 2 was a 
site
-specific amendment.
 Protocol Amendment 1 (dated 16 November 2009) included revisions based 
on u
pdates to the Wyeth protocol template as well as 
the following key study-specific changes (among 
oth
er): 
- Clarified that the ≥2 active joints must be peripheral joints 
- Revised the criteria relating to positive HLA-B27 and IgM RF tests to match the ILAR 
diagnosis criteria for JIA 
- Removed the exclusion for subjects with guttate psoriasis 
- Clarified that immunosuppressive drugs included cyclosporine and azothiop
rine 
- Revised the exclusion for receipt of live (attenuated) vacci
nes to 2 months before the 
Baseline visit 
- Revised the exclusion for receipt of combinations of non-biologic DMARDs an
d DMARDs which 
would not be continued during the study to 4 weeks before the Baselin
e visit. 
Pro
tocol Amendment 2 (dated 01 Dec 2009), which was specific to site 008, repea
ted the changes 
made to the original protocol in Protocol Amendment 1. In addition, at the request of the site’s IRB, 
the eligibility criterion for the subjects with extended oligoarticular JIA subtype was revised, so that the 
lower age limit was increased from 2 years to 4 years at site 008. 
Three (3) changes were made to the planned analyses in the SAP: 
- The ACR Pedi response definition used for the reports contained in the CSR was revised after 
finalization of the SAP. This changed the ACR Pedi 30 response definition from requiring a 
>30% improvement in 3 of the 6 variables to requiring ≥30% improvement in 3 of the 6 
variables. The change was also applied to the definitions for the ACR Pedi 50, 70, 90, and 100 
responses. The change was made for consistency with the definition in the literature and the

active historical control study 16.0016. The SAP was not updated prior to release of the final 
tables for the CSR. 
- The following data were summarized by age group for the extended o
ligoarticular JIA 
subtype: demography and
 baseline disease characteristics, ACR Pedi response rates, TEAEs 
excluding infections and ISRs, treatment-emergent infections, Tanner stag
e scores, and z-
scores for height, weight, and BMI. 
- Mean percent change from baseline was calculated at each visit for the fo
llowing continuous 
efficacy variables: PGA of Disease Activity, Patient/Parent G
lobal Assessment, CHAQ, number 
of a
ctive joints, number of joints with limitation of motion, CRP, pain assessment, duration of 
morning stiffness, tender entheseal score, overall and nocturnal back pain, modi
fied Schober’s 
Ass
essment, percent BSA affected by psoriasis, and PGA of Psoriasis score. 
Baseline data 
The mean (SD) age was 11.70 (4.51) years with a range of 2
 to 17 years for the overall JIA population 
in study 3338:  
8.60 (4.63) years with a range of 2 to 16 years for the eoJIA subtype;  
14.50 (1.61) years w
ith a range of 12 to 17 years for the ERA subtype; and  
14.45 (1.99) years with a range of 12 to 17 years for the PsA subtype.  
Fifteen (15) subjects with eoJIA (11.81%) were 2 to 4 years of age, 23 subjects
 with eoJIA (18.11%) 
were 5 to 11 years of age, and 89 subjects in the overall population (70.08%) wer
e 12 to 17 years of 
age at baseline (table 3).  
Overall, the majority of subjects in study 3338 were female (56.69%)
 and white (90.55%); however, 
in the ERA subtype, the majority of subjects were male (78.95%) which is expected.  
Overall, the mean (SD) disease duration was 26.79 (26.44) months with a range of 0.49 to 139.10 
months. Prior to the study, all subjects had received at least 1 DMARD except for 2 subjects with ERA 
who had not received prior DMARDs, and 109 subjects (85.83%) were taking a DMARD at baseline.

In general, the mean and median baseline values for most disease characteristics
 were numerically 
similar across the 3 JIA subtypes in study 3338 except for those noted below (T
able 4). 
The mean number of active joints was numerically lower in subjects with ERA (5.21 joints) compared 
to subjects with eoJIA and PsA (7.58 and 7.00 joints, respectively). Similarly, the mean number of 
swollen joints was numerically lower in subjects with ERA (3.79 joints) compared t
o subjects with 
eoJIA and PsA (6.52 and 5.59 joints, respectively). Although some subjects with eo
JIA had ≤5 active 
joints at the Baseline visit, they were still required to have a history arthritis aff
ecting >4 joints in 
order to meet the ILAR classification criteria. The mean duration of morning stiffne
ss at baseline was 
numerically longer in subject
s with ERA (89.29 minutes) compared to subjects with eoJIA and PsA 
(72.78 minutes and 54.31 minutes, respectively). 
Mean baseline CRP was numerically higher in subjects with ERA (15.27 mg/L) compared to subjects 
with eoJIA and PsA (6.27 mg/L and 3.19 mg/L, respectively). Median baseline CRP in subjects with the 
latter 2 JIA subtypes (1.40 mg/L and 1.00 mg/L for subjects with eoJIA and PsA, respectively) was at, 
below, or near the lowest limit of detection of 1.00 mg/L. As expected, a greater proportion of subjects 
with ERA were HLA-B27 positive (68.42%) compared to subjects with eoJIA and PsA (15.00% and 
10.34%, respectively). The subjects with eoJIA and PsA who were HLA-B27 positive were either males 
with arthritis starting before the 6th birthday or females. Therefore, they did not meet the ILAR 
exclusion criteria for these subtypes.

Table 4. Summary of Baseline Disease Characteristics, All Subjects in Study 3338 
The mean (SD) tender entheseal score at baseline in subjects with ERA was 5.87 (9.42) (Table 5). It 
should be noted that, although some subjects had no enthesitis at the Baseline visit, this was not 
required in order to meet the ILAR classification criteria for ERA.

Table 5. Summary of Additional Baseline Disease Characteristics in Subjects with Enthesitis-
Related Arthritis in Study 3338  
The mean (SD) percent of BSA affected by psoriasis at baseline in subjects with PsA was 10.41% 
(13.39) (Table 6). The mean
 (SD) PGA of Psoriasis score at baseline was 1.83 (1.42). It should be 
noted that, although some subjects had no psoriasis at the Baseline visit, this was not required in 
order to meet the ILAR classification criteria for PsA. 
Table 6. Summary of Additional Baseline Disease Characteristics in Subjects with 
Psoriatic Arthritis in Study 3338 
On the whole, the baseline demographics and disease characteristics are considered to reflect those 
subtypes of JIA for whom the indication i
s proposed. The MAH provided the type of psoriasis lesions of 
the patients recruited in the study 3338. Of the 29 subjects included in study 0881A1-3338 with a 
diagnosis of PsA: 
  2 had confirmed guttate psoriasis, 
  19 had confirmed plaque psoriasis, 
  6 subjects with no reported history of skin involvement (presence of psoriasis lesions is not 
required per the ILAR classification criteria for PsA diagnosis), and 
  2 had an unknown type of psoriasis lesions 
In the original protocol, Patients with guttate, pustular, or erythrodermic psoriasis were excluded. 
However in Protocol Amendment 1, the exclusion of guttate psoriasis was removed. This was because, 
for subjects with psoriatic arthritis, the skin psoriasis assessments are only secondary measures of 
clinical benefit. Therefore, the inclusion of subjects with guttate psoriasis would not impact the primary 
variables of clinical benefit (i.e. ACR PEDI 30 response rate). A total of two subjects with guttate

psoriasis were included and appeared to have a similar response to treatment as those with plaque 
psoriasis and al
l PsA subjects. 
Numbers analysed 
The mITT and safety populations include these 127 subjects: 60 subjects with eo
JIA, 38 subjects with 
ERA, and 29 subjects wi
th PsA. The mITT and safety population for subjects with eoJIA consisted of 15 
subjects in the 2 to 4-year age group, 23 subjects in the 5 to 11-year age group, and 22 subjects in 
the 12 to 17-year age group.

Outcomes and estimation 
Efficacy Endpoints for JIA 
ACR Pedi 30 Response at Week 1
2 (Primary Endpoint) 
In the overall population, 109 subjects (88.6%) achieved an ACR Pedi 30 response at Week 12 of 
study 3338 (OC data; 95% CI: 81.6%, 93.6%; Table 8). The percentages of subjects with eoJIA, ERA, 
and PsA who achieved an ACR Pedi 30 response at Week 12 were similar (89.7%, 83.3%, and 93.1%, 
respectively).

3338 (Observed Cases), mITT Population 
Comparison of ACR Pedi 30 Response Rates to Historical Placebo Control Data. 
The ACR Pedi 30 response rate at Week 12 for the subjects in this study was compared with the 
placebo mean composite endpoint response rate from Ruperto et al for the overall population as well 
as for each of the 3 JIA subtypes (Table 9). The estimates of the treatment effect were similar when 
the 6 studies included in the meta analysis were pooled and treated as if 1 study (unadjusted) or when 
the treatment effect was estimated by adjusting for among study differences (adjusted). Generally, the 
adjusted method is preferred when there are multiple studies in the comparison.

For the ERA subtype, the ACR Pedi 30 response rate at Week 12 was also compar
ed with the placebo 
response rate from Burgos-Vargas et al (Table 9). All odds ratios and the lower bound of the 95% CI 
were greater than 1. Thus, the ACR Pedi 30 response rate at Week 12 in study 3338 was significantly 
higher than that from historical placebo controls.

to Historical Placebo Control, mITT Population  
Comparison of ACR Pedi 30 Response Rates to Historical Active Control Data. 
The initial 12-week open-label period ACR Pedi 30 response rate from etan
ercept study 16.0016 (Lovell 
et al) was used as an active historical control for 
the overall population as well as for each of the 3 JIA 
subtypes (Table 10). The 95% CI of each of the odds ratios included 1. Therefore, the ACR Pedi 30 
response rate at Week 12 in study 3338 was comparable to that from study 16.0016.

ACR Pedi 30, ACR Pedi 50, and ACR Pedi 70 Responses at All Timepoints 
Clinically meaningful ACR Pedi 30 responses were noted at the first time point (Week 4) and 
maintained throughout the duration of Part 1 of the study. In the overall population, 81.1% and 61.5% 
of subjects achieved ACR Pedi 50 and ACR Pedi 70 responses, respectively, at Week 12 (Table 11). 
Within each ACR Pedi response level, the percentages of subjects with eoJIA, ERA, and PsA who 
achieved a response at Week 12 were similar.

Study 20021618: Open-label Extension Treatment with TNFR:Fc for 
Participating Patie
nts in TNFR:Fc Clinical Trials 
Methods 
Study 20021618 was an open-label study of long-term etanercept tre
atment through 10 years, which 
included paediatric subjects who had previously participated in study 16.0016 as w
ell as adult subjects 
who had previously participated in double-blind rheumatoid arthritis studies.  
In the below text only data from the paediatric subjects with JIA are presented. 
Study Participants 
All paediatric subjects with DMARD-refractory, polyarticular-course JIA (polyarticular-, pauciarticular-, 
or systemic-onset) who had been enrolled in the initial etanercept study 16.0016, had not had any 
clinically significant adverse events thought to be due to etanercept, and who met the 
inclusion/exclusion criteria per the protocol were eligible to enrol in study 20021618. Per the inclusion 
criteria for the initial study 16.0016, patients were to be between 4 and 17 years of age at the time of 
enrollment. Furthermore, the inclusion criteria for entry into the study 16.0016 required a diagnosis of 
Assessment report  
EMA/548283/2012  
Page 21/63
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
JIA by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria; disease onset may have been systemic, 
polyarticu
lar, or pauciarticular but disease course had to be polyarticular. 
Treatments 
Although paediatric subjects who entered study 20021618 initially continued with 
the etanercept dose 
administered in study 16.0016 (0.4 mg/kg etanercept BIW up to a maximum dose of 25
 mg per 
injection), the 0.8-mg/kg weekly dose (maximum dose of 50 mg per week) could be administered as 
two 0.4-
mg/kg SC injections either on the same day or 3 to 4 days apart, or as a single 0.8-mg/kg 
injection QW. 
Objectives 
The primary objectives of study 20021618 were: 
1.  to evaluate the long-term safety of etanercept in su
bjects with disease-modifying 
antirheum
atic drug (DMARD)-refractory JIA; and  
2.  to evaluate improvement in physical function/disability and quality of life.  
The secondary objective was to evaluate long-term efficacy of etanercept. 
Outcomes/endpoints 
In terms of efficacy evaluation, the prim
ary endpoint in paediatric subjects is ACR Pedi 30 (referred to 
in the CSR as the juvenile rheumatoid arthritis 30% definition of im
provement [JRA-DOI 30]) at month 
3, and
 is defined as an improvement of at least 30% from baseline in at least 3 of the 6 criteria of the 
JIA Core Set of Response 
Criteria, and a worsening of greater than 30% in not more than 1 of the 
following 6 criteria from baseline: 
1. PGA of disease activity on the 0 to 10 V
AS scale 
2. Subject’s/Parent’s Global Assessment of disease activity on the 0 to 10 VAS scale
3. CHAQ 
4. Number of active joints 
5. Number of joints with LOM 
6. Erythrocyte sedimentation factor (ESR). 
With the exception of the use of ESR, these criteria are the same as that used in study 3338.
 However, 
the acute phase reactant was changed to CRP after year 1 in study 20021618. The
 terminology for the 
assessment 
of response in patients with JIA that was current at the time the protocol for study 
20021618 was prepared was JRA-DOI; however, the newer terminology (i.e., ACR Pedi) is used herein 
for consistency. The change in terminology from JRA-DOI to ACR Pedi resulted from the variable being 
renamed and not due to changes in any of the components that make up the composite index. 
Additional efficacy endpoints for paediatric subjects in the study 20021618 database included: 
  ACR Pedi 30, ACR Pedi 50, ACR Pedi 70, ACR Pedi 90, and ACR Pedi 100 responses; 
  ACR Pedi components: PGA of disease activity, Subject/Parent’s Global Assessment of disease 
activity, number of active joints, CHAQ score, CRP (after first year), and number of joints with 
LOM

  Articular severity score 
  Co

Results 
Participant flow  
Fifty-eight (58, 84%) of the 69 paediatric subjects from study 16.0016 received e
tanercept in study 
200216
18. Fifteen (15) of the 58 paediatric subjects who enrolled in study 20021618 completed the 
10-year st
udy and 43 discontinued treatment. In general, the withdrawal rate was highest in the first 3 
years and then relatively stable for the remainder of the study. The most commo
n reasons for 
discontinuation for paediatric subjects enrolled in study 20021618 were as follow
s: other (not related 
to safety, 10 subjects), response status (9 subjects), and subject refusal (7 subjects).
 The reasons 
that were grouped under the term ‘other’ for paediatric subjects include withdrew consent, to increase 
dose, to reduce d
ose, pregnancy, subject non-compliance, lack of efficacy, and subject moving from 
the area. 
Recru
itment 
The study was conducted at 38 North American study centers (2 Canada, 36 United States). It was 
initiated on 31 July 1997 and the last subject visit occurred on 10 December 2008. The study period 
for the cumulative dataset ranges from 16 August 1993 (first date of etanercept administration in the 
initial etanercept studies) to 10 December 2008. 
Conduct of the study 
Study 20021618 protocol was amended 8 times. Major changes for each amendment are described in 
Table 25.

Deviations from the protocol-specified analyses included the exclusion of the follow
ing tables: Common 
Toxicity Criteria (CTC) shifts from baseline, current med
ications for RA, lot numbers for investigational 
product, and subject listing of investigational product discontinuation. 
Analysis of laboratory values, ESR and CRP, corticosteroid use, and methotrexate use were 
approximated to fit visit windows. In addition, the SAPs specified in the statistica
l analysis plan that 
reporting of all serious adverse events and deaths would be limited to ≤30 days of 
the last dose of 
etanercept in the tables; however, all serious adverse events and deaths (as of database lock on 12 
December 2008) were reported in the listings and the tables included events withi
n 30 days of the last 
dose of etanercept. 
Protocol amendment 1 clarified that the ≥2 active joints must be peripheral joints. This revision was 
made primarily to ensure that subjects with only back pain were not enrolled in the
 study. 
Baseline data 
The mean (SD) age of the JIA population in study 20021618 was 10.52 (3.74) yea
rs with a range of 4 
to 17 years at the baseline of the initial study 16.0016, the study subjects participated i
n before 
entering study 20021618 (Table 26). One (1) of t
he paediatric subjects in study 20021618 (1.7%) was 
4 years of age, 28 subjects (48.3%) were 5 to 11 years of age, and 29 subjects (50.
0%) were 12 to 
17 years of age at baseline of the initial study 16.0016. Although all subjects had
 polyarticular-course 
JIA, 34 of the paediatric subjects in study 20021618 (58.6%) had polyarticular-ons
et JIA, 19 (32.8%) 
had systemic-onset JIA, and 5 (8.6%) had pauciarticular onset JIA. The maj
ority of paediatric subjects 
in study 20021618 were female (67.2%) and White (74.1%). 
The mean (SD) disease duration of JIA at the entry of the initial study 16.0016 was 5.96 (3.19) years 
with a range of 0.7 to 12.4 years. Approximately half of the subjects in study 2
0021618 had had JIA 
for greater than 5 years at the time they entered study 16.0016. Approximately half of the subjects in 
study 20021618 had had JIA for greater than 5 years at the time they entered study 16.0016. 
At the baseline of study 16.0016, all of the subjects had received DMARDs: 84% of the subjects were 
nonresponsive to previous MTX therapy and 22% were intolerant to previous MTX therapy.

20021618 (Table 28). Fifteen (15) of the 58 paediatric subjects who enrolled in study 20021618 
completed the 10-year study and 43 discontinued treatment.

The proportion of paediatric subjects in study 20021618 achieving ACR Pedi 30, ACR Pedi 50, and ACR 
Pedi 70 responses remained relatively stable over 10 years (Table 30). Similar results were observed 
for ACR Pedi 90 and ACR Pedi 100.

Individual Components of the ACR Pedi Response Variable 
As was observed for the ACR Pedi response rates, the individual components of
 the ACR Pedi response 
remained relatively stable over time through 10 years (Table 31). However, the
re was some fluctuation 
in the mean % improvement in CRP in the later years of the s
tudy because of outlier data and the 
limited number of patients contributing data (18 or less after year 7). As expected, the median % 
change showed much less fluctuation over the 10-year duration of the study.

Pedi Response Over Time for Paediatric Subjects in Study 20021618 (Observed Cases) 
Pain Assessment on Visual Analog Scale 
The change from baseline in pain assessment remained relatively stable over t
ime, although there was 
some fluctuation because
 of outlier data and the limited number of subjects contributing data in the 
later years (Table 32). Although there was a large amount of variability in the mean changes from 
baseline due to outliers, the median changes from baseline were relatively stable through year 7 after 
which time there was also fluctuation in the median percent improvement most likely due to the small 
number of subjects assessed in year 8 (n=4), year 9 (n=2), and year 10 (n=1).

Persistence of Efficacy and/or Tolerance Effects 
The 10-years efficacy results from the long-term extension stu
dy 20021618 in subjects with JIA 
presented in the preceding sections demonstrate persistence of efficacy over time, t
hrough 10 years of 
treatment. There was no evidence of tolerance (i.e., loss of therapeutic effect over
 time) from long-
term treatment with etanercept in study 20021618. Withdrawal of etanercept w
as not studied in either 
study 3338 or 20021618. 
Analysis performed across trials (pooled analyses and meta-analysis) 
In view of the fact that rheumatoid factor positive and rheumatoid factor negative polyarthritis will now 
replace polyarticular JIA in section 4.1 of the SmPC, the MAH provided an overview of efficacy results 
from previous JIA trials; study 16.0016 part 1 and part 2. study 20021618 and registry 20021626 
for all RF positive and RF negative polyarthritis subjects.

Subjects meeting the ILAR classification of RF-negative polyarthritis and RF-positive polyarthritis JIA 
were identified based on a retrospective application of the ILAR assessment criteria and using only one 
assessment of the presence or absenc
e of RF. In general, both subtypes demonstrated efficacy that 
were consistent with that reported in the original study reports for the overall poly
articular-course JIA 
population, thereby supporting the inclusion of the indication for RF-negative po
lyarthritis JIA and RF-
positive polyarthritis JIA in the SmPC. 
Discuss
ion on clinical efficacy
The MAH has provided an open label study 3338 in support of efficacy for the sub
types of JIA namely: 
eoJIA (from the age of 2 years), ERA and PsA (both from the age of 12 years). In
 addition the final 
CSR from the open label study 2
0021618 where patients with polyarticular course JIA were analysed 
was also provided. The majority of subjects in study 20021618 reflect the ILA
R classification of 
polyarticular JIA (RF positive and RF negative). 
Study 3338 
The overall study plan for the open-label study 3338 is acceptable. While a double-blind randomised 
controlled study is the standard design to show efficacy, the comparison with placebo for the same 
subtypes using historical control can be accepted to suppo
rt efficacy of etanercept in the subtypes of 
JIA studies namely eoJIA, ERA and PSA. 
The open-label etanercept period of study 16.0016 in JIA subjects reported by Lovell et al  paper 
referred to polyarticular-course JRA regardless of subtype. The MAH retrospectively reviewed the 
reported medical histories, JRA onset type, gender, age at disease onset, screening RF status, and 
screening efficacy results for joint assessment and morning stiffness in the inclusion criteria for study 
16.0016, all subjects had polyarticular-course JRA. 
5 subjects would meet the ILAR classification for eoJIA based on the available data but none would 
meet the ILAR classification for ERA pr PsA based on the available data.

Given the rarity of the ILAR subtypes and the fact that a placebo-controlled study
 may be difficult to 
conduct and may raise ethical concerns, one way to address these concerns, whil
e still retaining the 
ability to assess the clinical benefit in the combined population as well as in each of the JIA subtypes 
under study (i.e., eoJIA, ERA, and PsA), would be to utilize appropriate historical 
control data.  
Ideally, the historical control group(s) for study 3338 would have assessed su
bjects with eoJIA, ERA, 
and PsA based on the ILAR classification criteria separately. However, the MAH was
 not able to identify 
reports of studies conducted in meaningful numbers of subjects with well-defined eo
JIA or PsA. 
The intent of using the etanercept response rate from study 16.0016 as an
 active historical control was 
to help establish comparability of clinical response and this is acceptable. In ad
dition, published reports 
of treatment response in eoJIA, ERA, and PSA indicate th
ERA, and PsA may be similar to the response of the overall JIA population 14, 15, 16 T
unexpected since they all are tumor necrosis factor 
(TNF)-mediated diseases and the response to 
at the ACR Pedi 30 response rates of eoJIA, 
his is not 
treatment may be similar to that observed with polyarticular disease.   
In view of the above considerations, the use of study 16.0016 as an active histor
ical control, together 
with the 2
 historical placebo controls is considered appropriate.   
The failure of previous DMARD treatment in the majority of subjects is noted. The 
proposed indication 
is restricted to those who have failed or have a contraindication to MTX or (in the c
ase of ERA) 
conventional therapy. The latter is endorsed in the case of ERA as there is no st
andard of therapy in 
this subtype. 
The ACR Pedi 30, a clinically relevant endpoint, is high in all three subtypes in stud
y 3338 at week 12. 
For the overall population, 109 subjects (88.6%; 95% CI: 81.6%, 93.6%) ach
ieved an ACR Pedi 30 
response. The percentages of subjects with ex
tended oligoarticular JIA, ERA, and PsA who achieved an 
ACR Pedi 30 response at Week 12 were similar (89.7%, 83.3%, and 93.1%, respec
tively). For the 
disease-specific variables in subjects with ERA and PsA, improvements were note
d at Week 12. In 
subjects with ERA, the mean tender entheseal score, the mean overall back pai
n VAS score, the mean 
nocturnal back pain VAS score, and the mean modified Schober’s test were improved from baseline at 
Week 12. In subjects with PsA, the mean percent BSA affected by psoriasis and the mean PGA of 
Psoriasis score were improved from baseline at Week 12. 
The response rate continues to increase from week 4 to week 12 and this is clea
r with the ACR Pedi 50 
and 70 and is evident for all subtypes. This simi
larity in response in terms of absolute response and 
increase in the more stringent efficacy measure of ACR Pedi 50 and 70 over a s
imilar time frame 
supports inclusion of all three subtypes specifically. 
The breakdown of the individual components of the composite score supports the pri
mary efficacy 
endpoint for study 3338, as no worsening of any of the components was seen. 
Regarding the ERA-specific endpoints, the more than 50% reduction in mean tender enth
eseal score is 
considered to be very clinically relevant. However it has to be borne in mind that this was an open 
study which may have had an effect on patient perception.  
Regarding the PsA-specific efficacy endpoint, the improvement in the percentage BSA affected by 
psoriasis is expected as Enbrel is licensed for plaque psoriasis in children aged 6 years and above. 
The comparison of the results in subpopulations showed that within each ACR Pedi response level for 
ACR Pedi 30, ACR Pedi 50, and ACR Pedi 70, the percentages of subjects in each age group who 
achieved responses at Week 12 were generally similar. This important information on ACR Pedi scores 
by age group is supportive of the entire data from 3338 and shows that response to etanercept is 
similar across the different age categories presented.

Study 20021618 
The use of the newer terminology of ACR Pedi is accepted in view of the minor differences between the 
older scoring technique of JRA-DOI (VAS scales and CRP versus ESR). With the introduction of the CRP 
in study 20021618 the MAH plan to use ACR Pedi is acceptable. 
100% of patients in study 20021618 with JIA were on DMARDs as compared with
 80-90% of subjects 
in study 3338. Thi
s difference is likely to reflect the lack of well established DMARDs for use in specific 
subtypes of JIA which are not polyarticular and the higher severity of disease in JIA
 subjects enrolled 
into study 20021618. 
The proportion of paediatric subjects in study 20021618 achieving ACR Pedi 30, A
CR Pedi 50, and ACR 
Pedi 70 responses remained relatively stable over 10 years. Similar results were observed for ACR Pedi
90 and ACR Pedi 100. It is difficult to draw conclusions for maintenance of effica
cy out to 10 years in 
view of the very sm
all numbers at this time and the loss of subjects over time due to various reasons 
including lack of efficacy. In addition those who remain with some response and lack of SAEs 
necessitating cessation of therapy are the most likely to have long-term continuati
on of treatment. 
However even with these caveats, by year 7 where number are in double figure
s, efficacy remains 
similar to that at year 1. 
As was observed for the ACR Pedi response rates, the individual compone
remained relatively stable over time through 10 years. At the later time points whe
small (years 8, 9 and 10) the data are difficult to interpret as there are a higher n
n the numbers are 
umber of active 
nts of the ACR Pedi response 
joints at these time points compared with year 1. However it is likely that only 
those subjects with 
severe disease who showed some response to treatment conti
nued for many years. 
One of the primary objectives of study 20021618 was to evaluate improveme
nt in physical 
function/disability and quality of life. The mean percent improvement in the CH
AQ at year 1 was 48%. 
The mean percent improvement in the CHAQ score was relatively stable up to 5 years and increased 
slightly over the last 5 years. Thus, the physical function and quality of life improvement
s in these 
paediatric subjects were maintained for up to 10 years in the study. 
The change from baseline in pain assessment remained relatively stable over time
. The only time point 
(year 3) where there was an increase in pain score is explained by outliers and
 a high standard 
deviation. All other time points show a mean improvement in pain score compare
d with baseline. 
Little is known about when or how to discontinue etanercept treatment in patients with JIA after a 
good clinical response has been achieved, nor are there guidelines from recog
nized bodies to define 
criteria for discontinuing treatment of etanercept.  The criteria for clinically inac
tive disease (CID) in 
oligoarticular (persistent and extended), polyarticular (RF positive and negative), and systemi
have recently been revised by Wallace et al (2011)25. CID is defined as the ab
active arthritis, fever, rash, serositis, splenomegaly, or generalized lymphadenopathy attributable to 
sence of joints with 
c JIA 
JIA; erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or C-reactive protein (CRP) level within normal limits; 
Physician Global Assessment of disease activity score of best possible on scale used; duration of 
morning stiffness of ≤15 minutes; and no active uveitis. 
The MAH has attempted to address this lack of information by interaction with the two European 
biological registries which include children with JIA; in Germany and in the UK. Since 2009, the 
German JIA registry has collected data on disease activity specifically the set of criteria for inactive 
disease and remission as defined by Wallace et al. The MAH will explore the possibility to collect 
additional safety data, and in addition, efficacy data in order to optimize the management of JIA 
Assessment report

patients following the achievement of clinical remission with etanercept treatment (as described in the 
RMP).  
In addition the planned ongoing long-term study B1801023 (described in the RMP)
, provides a further 
opportunity to collect data on clinically inactive disease/remission rates in the differ
ent ILAR subtypes 
of JIA. This information could lead to further understanding abou
t the length of time treatment should 
be given as many patients with JIA become clinically quiescent over time. This info
rmation is important 
to ensure that treatment is not administered for extended periods unnecessarily. 
Although the purpose of study B1801023 is to monitor long-term (8-year) safet
y data, due to the lack 
of information on CID and remission rates, the MAH has substantially amended th
e protocol to collect 
data that may inform when treatme
nt with etanercept should be discontinued and the success of re-
treatment if relapse occurs. The amendment includes additional efficacy assessme
nts, collection of 
data on CID/remission rates, and success rate of re-treatment upon disease 
relapse in subjects with 
eoJIA, ERA and PsA (described in the RMP).   
Although it is not possible to predict how many subjects will contribute data to the
 new withdrawal/re-
treatment period, the addition of a withdrawal/re-treatment period to the B1801
023 protocol is 
endorsed and may provide gui
dance to prescribers on optimal treatment regimens in pediatric patients 
with eoJIA, ERA, and PsA. It is acknowledged that interpretation of the data may be limited by the 
relatively small number of patients who contribute data to the new withdrawal/re-treatment period of 
the study. However, the study i
s expected to provide useful information on CID/remission rates and 
the success rate of re-treatment upon disease relapse while still preserving the prim
ary objective of 
study (as described in the RMP) . 
Conclusion on clinical efficacy 
In view of the rarity of JIA subtypes and the well established use of etanercept in p
olyarticular JIA, the 
open-label single arm design of study 3338 is considered acceptable and in terms o
f assessment of 
effect, the comparison with historical controls for placebo is accepted. It is of note
 that during the 
procedure for variation II/126 (which approved the extension of the lower age ran
ge for polyarticular 
JIA from 4 years to 2 years) was accepted on the basis of an ope
n label study (20021626) and 
ancillary analysis of the subgroup aged 2 to <4 years. 
As JIA has been re-classified by ILAR into 8 clear mutually exclusive subtypes, a
nd already etanercept 
has been licensed from the age of 2 years in polyarticular course JIA; this additiona
l information is 
beneficial and an update to the SmPC with the results from study 3338 and the long-term extensi
on of 
study 20021618 is endorsed. Efficacy in 5 out of 8 of the subtypes of JIA is consid
ered to have been 
shown and as such these patients, if they fail conventional therapy and are seve
re enough to require 
significant immunosuppression, are likely to benefi
t from etanercept treatment.   
While the MAH position that persistence of efficacy through 10 years has been shown, it is considered 
difficult to draw any firm conclusions from the efficacy data presented from 8 years onwards in view of 
the small numbers treated at those time points. While withdrawal of etanercept was not studied in 
either study presented in this variation procedure, when and how to withdraw etanercept from patients 
who have responded and have no active disease remains an important area of missing information. In 
order to address this issue the MAH has amended the long-term safety study B1801023 to include the 
collection of data on CID/remission rates, and success rate of re-treatment upon disease relapse in 
subjects with eoJIA, ERA and PsA subtypes. Further data on efficacy and remission is planned to be 
collected from registries, as described in the RMP.

1.2.5 Clinical safety 
Patient exposure 
A total of 127 paediatric subjects received at least 1 dose of etanercept in study 33
38: 60 subjects 
with eoJIA, 38 subjects with ERA, and 29 subjects with PsA. The 60 subjects w
ith eoJIA consisted of 15 
subjects in the 2- to 4-year age group, 23 subjects in the 5- to 11-year age g
roup, and 22 subjects in 
the 12- to 17-year age group. The mean (SD) duration of etanercept treatmen
t was 12.61 (1.61) 
weeks, with a range of 1 to 15 weeks and was similar across the 3 JIA subtype
s. The etanercept 
exposure in the overall population was 29.16 subject-years (Table 33). The mean (
SD) weekly 
etanercept do
se was 34.97 (13.12) mg, and ranged from 8.0 to 56.0 mg. No clinically meaningful 
differences were observed across JIA subtypes. Consistent with the lower mean ba
seline age and 
weight for subjects with eoJIA, the mean etanercept dose was also lower for this 
subtype than the ERA 
and PsA subtypes. 
Of the 69 paediatric subjects who participated in the double-blind study 16.0016, 58 subjects received 
at least 1 dose of etanercept in the exte
nsion study 20021618. The total etanercept exposure for the 
58 paediatric subjects in study 20021618 was 341.98 subject-years (Table 33). The mean exposure to 
etanercept was 614.2 doses (mean) over 2153.6 days (mean).

No combined/integrated analyses across studies 3338 and 20021618 were perfor
med because of the 
large difference in the study durations (12 weeks for Part 1 of study 3338 versus 10 years for study 
20021618). Furthermore, as discussed below, nonserious adverse events were only collected during 
year 1 of study 20021618. Therefore, the safety results are presented below 
by study. 
Both nonserious and serious adverse events were collected and analyzed duri
ng year 1 of study 
20021618. After the first year of study 20021618, nonserious adverse even
ts were not intended to be 
collected, although data for all SAEs and predefined events o
f interest (including hospitalization, 
deaths, serious infections, development of malignancies, and new signs or symptoms of other 
connective tissue disease) continued to be collected after year 1. However, there w
ere some 
nonserious adverse events that were reported by investigators after 
year 1. 
Adverse events in study 3338 are primarily presented below as proportion of subjects with events due 
to the short period of treatment (12 
weeks), and adverse events in study 20021618 are primarily 
presented below adjusted for exposure due to the longer-term treatment (10 yea
rs). 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events 
Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events, Excluding Infections and Injectio
n Site Reactions, in 
Study 3338 
Forty-five (45) subjects (35.4%) reported at least 1 treatment-emergent adver
se event (TEAE), 
excluding infections and ISRs, in study 3338 through 12 weeks (Table 35). The m
ost common TEAEs 
reported in the overall population were headache (7 subjects, 5.5%), followed by 
fatigue, pyrexia, 
abdominal pain, and diar
rhea (4 subjects each, 3.1%). No large differences were observed across JIA 
subtypes although a higher rate of abdominal pain and diarrhoea was seen in the ERA subtype but the 
numbers were small and at present there is no evidence of a JIA subtype-related safety signal.  
However further safety data will become available with Part 2 of study 3338. The overall exposure-
adjusted rate of TEAEs, excluding infections and ISRs, across all 3 JIA subtypes was 3.74 events per 
subject-year: 2.77 events per subject-year for eoJIA, 5.48 events per subject-year for ERA, and 3.43 
events per subject-year for PsA.

Per the protocol for study 20021618, nonserious adverse events were to be collected only during year 
1 of the 10-year study. 
The exposure-adjusted rate of TEAEs during year 1 of study 20021618 (the primary safety endpoint), 
including infections and ISRs, was 798.50 events per 100 subject-years (Table 36). The most common 
TEAEs reported were injection site reaction (112 events, 210.93 events per 100 subject-years), upper 
respiratory infection (68 events, 128.06 events per 100 subject years), headache (44 events, 82.86 
events per 100 subject-years), and abdominal pain (20 events, 37.67 events per 100 subject-years). 
Fifty (50) paediatric subjects (86.2%) reported at least 1 TEAE during year 1 of the study.

Treatment-Emergent Infections 
Study 3338 
Fifty-eight (58) subjects (45.7%) reported treatment-emergent infections in st
udy 3338 through 12 
weeks (Table 37). The most common treatment-emergent infections were upper r
espiratory tract 
infection (18 subjects, 14.2%), followed by pharyngitis (15 subjects, 11.8%),
 rhinitis (8 subjects, 
6.3%), gastroenteritis (5 subjects, 3.9%), and bronchitis (4 subjects, 3.1%). No clin
ically meaningful 
differences were observed across JIA subtypes. The overall exposure-adjusted rate
 of treatment-
emergent infections across all 3 JIA subtypes was 3.33 e
vents per subject-year: 4.09 events per 
subject-year for eoJIA, 2.29 events per subject year for ERA, and 3.13 events per subject-year for PsA. 
It is noted that the small numbers involved preclude any firm conclusions
 and further data on infection 
rate in each subtypes will become available with part 2 of the study.

Per the protocol for study 20021618, nonserious infections were to be collected only during year 1 of 
the 10-year study. 
The exposure-adjusted rate of treatment-emergent infections in paediatric subjects during year 1 of 
study 20021618 was 237.29 events per 100 subject-years (Table 38). The most common treatment-

Serious A
dverse Events 
Study 3338 
Four (4) subjects (3.1%) reported SAEs, including serious infections (Table 40
). No serious ISRs were 
reported. All SAEs and serious infections were treatment emergent. 
One (1) subject had a non-infectious SAE
: This was a 16-year-old female with ERA, experienced 
abdominal pain on Day 13. The event led to hospitalization. Investigational produc
t was continued and 
the event resolved 9 days later without sequel
ae, and was considered by the investigator to be 
moderate and unrelated to investigational product. 
The overall exposure-adjusted rate of non-infectious SAEs across all 3 JIA subtype
s was 0.034 events 
per subject-year (0.114 events per subject-year for ERA). 
Three (3) subjects had serious infections. A 6 year-old female with eoJIA ex
perienced 
bronchopneumonia on Day 38. The event led to withdrawal from investigational p
roduct, 
hospitalization, and treatment with anti-infectives. The event resolved after 7 days wi
thout sequelae, 
and was considered by the investigator to be mild and unrelated to investigational product.  
A 17-year-old female with PsA had pyelocystitis on Day 52. The event le
d to withdrawal from 
investigational product, hospitalization, and treatment with antiinfectives. The eve
nt resolved 7 days 
later without sequelae, and was considered by the investigator to be mi
ld and unrelated to 
investigational product.  
A 5-year-old female with eoJIA experienced gastro
enteritis on Day 10. The event led to hospitalization 
and use of supportive treatment. The subject did not receive antibiotics for the infection. 
Investigational product was continued and the event resolved 2 days later without sequelae, and was 
considered by the investigator to be severe and unrelated to investigational product.

and Serious Infections in Study 3338 Through 12 Weeks 
Study 20021618 
Throughout the 10-year study, 44 SAEs were reported in 16 paediatric subjects (27.6%). The 
exposure-adjusted rate of SAEs, including infections, in paediatric subjects through 10 years in study 
20021618 was 12.87 events per 100 subject-years (Table 41). The only SAE preferred terms occurring

in more than 1 subject each were rheumatoid arthritis which occurred in 6 (10.3%)
 paediatric subjects, 
and aggravat
ed reaction, infection, abdominal pain, and arthralgia which occurred in 2 (3.4%) subjects 
each. 
Of the 16 subjects with SAEs, 8 had serious infections.

Serious Infections 
Study 3338 
There were 3 serious infections reported during Part 1 of study 3338: 1 eoJIA sub
ject with 
bronchopneumonia, 1 eoJIA subject with gastroenteritis, and 1 PsA subject w
ith pyelocystitis.  
Study 20021618 
Throughout t
he 10-year study, 11 serious infections were reported in 8 paediatric subjects (13.8%). 
The exposure-adjusted rate of serious infections in paediatric subjects through
 10 years in study 
20021618 was 3.22 events per 100 subject-years (Table 43). All of the serious infection terms 
occurred in only 1 paediatric subject each, with the exception of the preferred term of infection 
(verbatim terms of soft tissue infection and post operative wound infection) which occurred in 2 
subjects (3.4%).

Other Significant Adverse Events 
Safety-Related Discontinuations 
Study 3338 
Four (4) subjects were withdrawn from investigational product due to adverse events including 
infections. Two (2) subjects were withdrawn from investigational product due to non-infectious TEAEs.  
Assessment report  
EMA/548283/2012

Two (2) subjects were withdrawn from investigational product due to treatment-emergent infections, 
both of which met seriousness criteria:  
1. A 6-year-old female with eoJIA, was withdrawn from investigational product due
 to 
bronchopneumonia on Day 38. The s
ubject was hospitalized and received antiinfectives. The 
treatment-emergent infection resolved without sequelae, and was considered by 
the investigator to be 
mild and unrelated to investigational product. 
2. A 17-year-old fe
male with PsA was withdrawn from investigational product due to pyelocystitis on 
Day 52. She was hospitalized and received anti-infectives. The treatment-emergent i
nfection resolved 
within 7 days without sequelae, and was considered by the investigator to be mild
 and unrelated to 
investigational product.  
The overall exposure-adjusted rate of treatment-emergent infections leading to withdrawa
l across all 3 
JIA subtypes
 was 0.069 events per subject-year: 0.073 events per subject-year for eoJIA and 0.149 
events per subject-year for PsA.

for Withdrawal 
Table 45. Number (%) of Subjects Reporting Treatment-Emergent Infections Causing 
Withdrawal from Study 3338 Through 12 Weeks, Including Primary and Secondary Reasons 
for Withdrawal 
Study 20021618 
The exposure-adjusted rate of adverse events leading to withdrawal in paediatric subjects through 10 
years in study 20021618 was 2.05 events per 100 subject-years (Table 46). Throughout the 10-year 
study, 7 adverse events leading to withdrawal were reported in 3 paediatric subjects (5.2%). However, 
there were 2 additional paediatric subjects who were noted to have withdrawn from the study for 
adverse events that were not captured in the above-noted table in the CSR: JRA flare in 1 subject, and 
Assessment report

infection and infection super in 1 subject. These 2 additional subjects were ide
ntified in the end of 
study case report form as having discontinued for an adverse event. If the 3 events from these 2 
additional subjects are included, then the rate of adverse events leading to withdrawal is 2.09 events 
per 100 subject-years. 
Therefore, overall, 5 paediatric subjects were withdrawn from study 20021618 for
 reasons related to 
adverse events: (1) JRA flare in 1 subject; (2) purpura fulminans (associated with
 SAEs of sepsis, 
shock, coagulation disorder, respiratory distress) in 1 subject; (3) skin disorder and fibro tendon in 1 
subject (reported as physician decision on the end of study case report form); (4) infection and 
infection super in 1 subject; and (5) diarrhoea, vomiting, bone disorder, and m
eningitis in 1 subject.

Adverse Events of Special Interest 
Adverse events of special interest generally identified for close clinical monito
ring in subjects receiving 
therapy with TNF inhibitors include lymphoma, malignancy, demyelinating disease, 
blood dyscrasias 
related to bo
ne marrow suppression, autoimmune disorders, opportunistic infections, and tuberculosis. 
No cases of lymphoma, malignancy, demyelinating disease, blood dyscrasias, autoimmune
 disorders, 
or tuberculosis were reported in study 3338. All medically important infections met the cri
teria for a 
serious infection. Three (3) subjects had medically-important infect
ions; all were treatment emergent. 
No subject who had a history of vaccination experienced an infection considered
 preventable by 
vaccination. Two (2) subjects with no history of vaccination experienced an infectio
n considered 
preventable by vaccination. There were 2 cases of varicella-zoster infection, one of wh
ich was reported 
as herpes zoster. 
No cases of lymphoma, malignancy, demyelinating disease, opportunistic infection, or tuberculosis 
were reported in paediatric subjects in study 20021618. Three (3) cases of autoimmune disorders were 
reported in paediatric subjects in study 20021618: 2 subjects with scleroderma (1 subject with 
morphea and 1 subject with scleroderma of the left leg) and 1 subject with uveitis.  
None of the 3 cases were SAEs and each of the subjects remained in the study for at least 3 more 
years. Although 4 subjects (2 with systemic-onset JIA) experienced a varicella-zoster infection in study 
20021618, they were not considered to be opportunistic infections. Two (2) of the 4 cases were SAEs, 
and 2 were reported during year 1 of the study. One (1) of the SAEs was reported as herpes zoster 
affecting the leg. At least 3 of the 4 subjects had not been vaccinated against varicella.

Study 3338 
No cases of lymphoma, malignancy, demyelinating disease, blood dyscrasias, autoi
mmune disorders, 
or tuberc
ulosis were reported in study 3338. All medically important infections met the criteria for a 
serious infection. Three (3) subjects had medically-important infections; all were treatmen
t emergent. 
(see above). 
No subject who had a hi
story of vaccination experienced an infection considered preventable by 
vaccination. Two (2) subjects with no history of vaccination experienced an infect
ion considered 
preventable by vaccination: 
1.  A 6-year-old female with eoJIA, experienced varicella infection that was tr
eated with an anti-
infective and resolved. One (1) day after the star
t date of the varicella infection, the subject 
was hospitalized for bronchopneumonia. It is unknown whether the bronch
opneumonia was 
related to the varicella infection. The varicella infection was considered by the i
nvestigator to 
be mild and unrelated to investigational product. 
2.  A 13-year-old female with ERA, experienced herpes zoster affecti
ng 2 dermatomes on Day 16. 
No treatment was given, investigational product was continued, and the ev
ent resolved after 
12 days without sequelae. The infection was considered by the investigator 
to be mild and 
unrelated to investigational product. It should be noted that this study was conducted primarily 
in cou
ntries in which varicella vaccination was not considered standard of care. 
There were 2 cases of varicella-zoster infectio
n, one of which was reported as herpes zoster. The case 
of herpes zoster was also considered to be an opportunistic infection per the defi
nition noted above. No 
other cases of herpes zoster were reported. 
Study 20021618 
No cases of lymphoma, malignancy, demyelinating disease, opportunistic infe
ction, or tuberculosis 
were reported in paediatric subjects in study 20021618 . 
Three (3) cases of autoimmune disorders were reported in paediatric subjects
 in study 20021618: 2 
subjects with scleroderma (1 subject with morphea and 1 subject with scleroderma
 of the left leg) and 
1 subject with uveitis. The 2 subjects with scleroderma were both females with p
olyarticular-onset JIA, 
7 and 11 years of age. The 1 case of uveitis occurred in a 10-year old femal
e with pauciarticular-onset 
JIA. The event of uve
itis was reported after approximately 2 years in the study and was mild in 
severity. None of the 3 cases were SAEs and each of 
the subjects remained in the study for at least 3 
more years. 
Although 4 subjects (2 with systemic-onset JIA) experienced a varicella-zoster infecti
on in study 
20021618, they were not considered to be opportunistic infections. Two (2) of the
 4 cases were SAEs, 
and 2 were reported during year 1 of the study. One (1) of the SAEs was reported
 as herpes zoster 
affecting the leg. At least 3 of the 4 subjects ha
d not been vaccinated against varicella.  
Laboratory findings 
Grades 3 and 4 Laboratory Toxicities 
Study 3338 
No subject had a Grade 4 laboratory test result. Five (5) subjects had Grade 3 laboratory test results 
(Table 47): 3 subjects had Grade 3 (decreased) neutrophil values, 1 subject had Grade 3 (increased) 
bilirubin values, and 1 subject had Grade 3 (increased) alkaline phosphatase values. All subjects with 
Grade 3 laboratory tests continued into Part 2 of the study.

Study 20021618 
No grade 4 laboratory toxicities were reported. Three (3) paediatric subjects experienced a Grade 3 
decrease in hemoglobin throughout the 10 years of study 20021618. None of th
ese subjects had any 
additional grade 3 hemoglobin results during the study. 
Subjects with Liver Function Test Abnormalities 
Study 3338 
A total of 12 subjects (9.5%) had increased liver function test (LFT) values, with 9 subjects (7.1%) 
reporting >2x to ≤3x upper limit of normal (ULN) LFT values and 3 subjects (2.4%) reporting >3x ULN 
LFT values (Table 48). No clinically meaningful differences were observed across JIA subtypes.

>3x ULN During Treatment in Study 3338 Through 12 Weeks 
Study 20021618 
During study 20021618, samples for clinical laboratory analyses were to be collected at screening, 
baseline, and every 3 months for the first 12 months, every 4 months from month 12 to month 48, 
and then every 6 months thereafter. However, samples were only reported up to month 52 as the data 
became sparse after this timepoint. No grade 4 laboratory toxicities were reported. Three (3) 
paediatric subjects experienced a Grade 3 decrease in haemoglobin throughout the 10 years of study 
20021618.

There were no reports of grade 3 or 4 ALT or AST in paediatric subjects (Table 50). ALT and AST were 
reported through 52 months in study 20021618. Mean AST and ALT remained relatively stable through 
48 months. Only 3 subjects had values reported at month 52.

Immunological events 
Anti-etanercept Antibodies 
Study 3338 
Seven (7) subjects tested positive for anti-etanercept antibodies at either Week
 12 or upon early 
withdrawal: 5 subjects had ERA and 2 had PsA (Table 51). None of the subjects
 who were positive for 
anti-etanercept antibodies tested positive for neutralizing antibodies. Three (3) subjects were missing 
either the baseline or Week-12 anti-etanercept antibody sample; therefore, no results are presented 
for these subjects. The presence of anti-etanercept antibodies did not adversely affect efficacy at Week 
12. Of the 7 subjects with anti-etanercept antibodies, 6 met ACR Pedi 30 response criteria at Week 12. 
Six (6) of the 7 subjects who tested positive for anti-etanercept antibodies experienced TEAEs, 
including infections and ISRs. One (1) of these subjects experienced an SAE of abdominal pain. No 
serious infections were reported in the subjects who tested positive for anti-etanercept antibodies.

Study 20021618 
Although the measurement of anti-etanercept antibodies was included as a safety endpoint in the 
protocol for study 20021618, no anti-etanercept antibody analysis was done. As testing for ADA 
requires comparison between samples and the baseline level, this will not be possib
le due to lack of 
samples/insufficient evidence of sample stability for the baseline samples taken m
ore than 10 years 
ago.  
Vital Signs, Physical Findings, and Other Observations Related to Safety 
Subgroup analyses were only performed for the intrinsic factor of age for the eoJIA
 population in study 
3338. TEAEs, infections, and Tanner stage scores were analyzed for the subgrou
ps of eoJIA subjects 
aged 2 to 4 years, 5 to 11 years, and 12 to 17 years. For subjects with eoJIA, 
the number (%) of 
subjects with TEAEs in each of the age groups of 2 to 4 years, 5 to 11 years, and 
12 to 17 years, was 
5 (33.3%), 10 (43.5%), and 6 (27.3%), respectively. No clinically meaningful differ
ences in the 
incidence of TEAEs were observe
d across the 3 age groups of subjects with eoJIA. The number (%) of 
subjects with eoJIA by age group who had treatment-emergent
 infections was 11 (73.3%), 12 
(52.2%), and 8 (36.4%), for subjects aged 2 to 4 years, 5 to 11 years, and 12 to
 17 years, 
respectively. The
 incidence of infections in subjects aged 2 to ≤4 years was numerically higher than 
that of the other 2 age gro
ups. For all 3 eoJIA age subgroups, there was no was no evidence of a 
decline in growth velocity in height, weight, or BMI from baseline to Week 12 of study 3338. Overall, 
there was no change in mean Tanner stage score at Week 12 compared with basel
ine of study 3338 for 
the 3 eoJIA age sub
groups. 
Subgroup analyses were not performed for intrinsic factors in study 20021618. 
Subgroup analyses were not performed for extrinsic factors in either study 3338 or study 20021618. 
Measures of Growth 
Study 3338 
There was no evidence of a decline in growth velocity in height, weight, or BMI from baseline to Week 
12 of study 3338.

Growth measurements were reported through 52 months in study 20021618. As e
xpected, mean 
height and weight increased for paediatric subjects through 48 months. Mean BMI remai
ned relatively 
stable through 48 months (Table 52). Only 4 subjects had values reported at mon
th 52. 
Table 52. Summary of Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index Over Time in Study 20021618 
Vital Signs 
Study 3338 
Six (6) subjects presented with vital signs of potential clinical interest at the Week-4, Week-8, or 
Week-12 visits, only 1 of which was reported as a TEAE. There was 1 report of a decreased diastolic 
blood pressure of 40 mm Hg and 5 rep
orts of elevated systolic blood pressures ranging from 141 mm 
Hg to 150 mm Hg. Per NCI Version 4.03, the elevated systolic blood pressures we
re Grade 2 in 
severity. The elevated systolic blood pressures were not accompanied by elevation
s in diastolic blood 
pressure. All vital signs of potential clinical interest were isolated to a single visit and returned to 
normal at the ne
xt visit. 
Study 20021618 
Vital signs were onl
y collected through year 1 of study 20021618. No clinically significant changes in 
vital signs (body tempe
rature, heart rate, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, and diastolic blood 
pressure) were observed during study 20021618. 
Tanner Assessment 
Overall, there was no change in mean Tanner stage score at Week 12 compared wi
th baseline of study 
3338. Baseline Tanner data were not collected in study 20021618 and therefore th
e data are not 
summarized. 
Post marketing experience 
Postmarketing Experience in Etanercept-treated Patients Under 18 Years of Age 
The most frequently reported serious, medically confirmed events in juvenile etanercept users (age 1 
to 17 years; all indications) differed when compared with the most frequently reported events for all 
users combined. Among all juvenile etanercept users, “condition aggravated” (flares or worsening of 
the indication for use or of a pre-existing condition), pyrexia, uveitis, and injection site reactions were 
the most frequently reported serious events. Fever and uveitis are often associated with JIA itself and 
fever often accompanies common childhood illnesses. In addition to condition aggravated, the most 
frequently reported nonserious, medically confirmed events in this age group included various injection 
site reactions, drug ineffective, and pyrexia. There have been postmarketing reports of pyrexia, uveitis 
Assessment report  
EMA/548283/2012  
Page 53/63
 
 
 
 
 
and injection site reactions in the general etanercept population. Accordingly, pyrexia, uveitis, and 
injection site reactions are listed adverse reactions in the etanercept CDS. 
Among spontaneous, medically confirmed reports regarding patients under the age of 18 who recei
ved 
etanercept for any indication, there were 23 deaths and 11 malignancies. The 
malignancies included 
Hodgkin’s disease (4), acute lymphocytic leukemia (2), acute myeloid leukemia (1
), leukemia (1), 
lymphoma (1), renal cancer (1), and colon cancer (1). On 04 June 2008, the FDA
 issued an Early 
Communication that described a possible association between use of tumour ne
crosis factor inhibitors 
in children and young adults and the development of malignancies. Wyeth, no
w Pfizer, conducted an 
analysis of the etanercept experience with malignancies in this population an
d determined that 
malignancies occurring after the exposure of juveniles to etanercept merited furthe
r investigation. 
Therefore, the Marketing Authorisation Holder (MAH) initiated several activities to g
ather further 
information. Results of an ana
lysis of the background rates of malignancy in paediatric/juvenile 
patients with inflammatory arthritis suggested that there is a potential increased ri
sk of malignancy in 
paediatric patients with JIA. The MAH regards the issue of paediatric malignanc
y as a safety concern 
and has added information to the warnings and precautions section of the etanerce
pt CDS to include a 
specific precaution for this population. 
There have been reports of inflammatory bowel disease occurring in JIA patien
ts and other paediatric 
patients who received etanercept at a greater freque
ncy than in the background normal paediatric 
population, although it is unclear what the frequency of inflammatory bowel dis
ease (IBD) is in the JIA 
population. Therefore, a precaution regarding reports of IBD in JIA patients being
 treated with 
etanercept was added to the CDS, which states that etanercept is not an effective tr
eatment for IBD 
and that a causal relationship with etanercept is unclear because clinical manifestati
ons of bowel 
inflammation have also been observed in untreated JIA patients. 
To identify potential effects of TNF-alpha inhibition upon the vaccination response i
n juveniles, the 
MAH’s pharmacovigilance database was searched through 02 February 2011 in patients less than 17 
years of age for reports of vaccination failure, vaccine complication, vaccine breakthrough infecti
on and 
the standardized MedDRA query (SMQ) terms for Lack of efficacy/effect. Two (2) re
ports with a vaccine 
as a co-suspect medication were identified; neither described lack of efficacy or red
uced efficacy of the 
vaccine. The etanercept CDS addresses the issue of paediatric immunization in t
he “Precautions” 
section, stating, “If possible, bring paediatric patients up to date with immunizatio
ns according to 
current local guidelines before beginning etanercept therapy. 
Postmarketing Experience in Etanercept-treated Patients with Juvenil
e Idiopathic Arthritis 
Through 02 February 2011, there were 1,937 spontaneous, medically confirmed events (in 671 cases) 
reported in patients under the age of 18 who received etanercept for the treatment of JIA
. The patients 
ranged in age from <1 year to 17 years (mean 10.66 years, median 11.0 years). T
he reported events 
were similar to those received for the overall etane
rcept paediatric population. The most frequently 
reported events were arthritis, injection site reactions, “condition aggravated”, and pyrexia. The most 
frequently reported serious events were “condition aggravated” and pyrexia (20 events each) and 
uveitis and injection site reactions (16 events each). Uveitis has been shown to resolve with 
discontinuation of etanercept. Malignancies were reported in 7 patients with JIA. These included 
Hodgkin’s disease (4), acute lymphocytic leukemia (2), and leukemia (1). 
The types and reporting proportion of infections in juvenile JIA patients were generally similar to those 
reported for all etanercept users. Many of the viral infections that were reported in juvenile etanercept 
patients are common in children in the general population. The comparison of the distribution of adult 
RA and juvenile JIA infections revealed no unexpected findings. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548283/2012  
Page 54/63
 
 
 
 
There have been reports of inflammatory bowel disease occurring in JIA patient
s and other paediatric 
patients who received etanercept at a greater frequency than in the background normal
 paediatric 
population, although it is unclear what the frequency of IBD is in the JIA populatio
n. Therefore, a 
precaution regarding reports of IBD in JIA patients being treated with etanerc
ept was added to the 
CDS, which states that etan
ercept is not an effective treatment for IBD and that a causal relationship 
with etanercept is unclear because clinical manifestatio
ns of bowel inflammation have also been 
observed in untreated JIA patients. 
Safety Concerns Identified During the Postmarketing Period 
Several safety concerns were identified during the postmarketing period that re
sulted in changes to 
core safety data. These are addressed in the RMP as appropriate. Highlights of thes
e changes (through 
August 2011) included: Enhance
ment of special warnings and/or precautions regarding infections 
including fatal infections, tuberculosis (with recommendations for patient testing, prophylaxis, and 
monitoring), sepsis, and opportunistic infections (including invasive fungal infections and the possi
bility 
of unrecognized fungal infection resulting in death). Information regarding hepatitis B reac
tivation and 
worsening of hepatitis C was also added. 
Several revisions have been made regarding the occurrence of lymphoma and 
other malignancies, to 
reflect the most current information. Included in the CDS is the occurrence of mor
e lymphomas in TNF 
treated patients in controlled clinical trials than in the placebo groups (though exp
osure was smaller in 
placebo groups), and information that postmarketing reports of malignancies have been recei
ved. The 
CDS states that post hoc analyses of rheumatoid arthritis clinical trials with etanercept have neither 
confirmed nor excluded an increased risk for malignancies. Melanoma, nonmela
noma skin cancer 
(NMSC), and Merkel cell carcinoma were added as adverse drug reactions with
 a recommendation for 
periodic skin examination for patients who are at increased risk for skin cancer. A
 statement was also 
added regarding reports of malignancies among children and adolescents who rec
eived treatment with 
TNF-antagonists. 
Additiona
l warnings and precautions have been added to the CDS regarding several hematologic 
reactions (including sometimes fatal aplastic anemia and pancytopenia), neurologic
 events (central 
demyelinating disorders and peripheral demyelinating polyneuropathies (including Guill
ain-Barré 
syndrome), autoantibody formation, cardiac disorders (worsen
ing congestive heart failure), and the 
possibility of hypoglycemia in diabetic etanercept users. A precaution regarding r
eports of IBD in JIA 
patients being treated with etanercept was added, but states that a causal re
lationship with etanercept 
is unclear because clinical manifestations of bowel inflammation have also b
een observed in untreated 
JIA patients. 
Special warnings are included in the CDS to advise about lack of efficacy and malignanci
es in patients 
who received etanercept for Wegener’s granulomatosis and about increased morta
lity and infection 
rates in patients who received etanercept for treatment of alcoholic hepatit
is. 
Adverse reactions that have been also been added to the CDS include: autoimmune events (such as 
development of autoantibodies, lupus-like syndrome, autoimmune hepatitis, systemic vasculitis 
including anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody [ANCA] positive vasculitis, cutaneous vasculitis 
[including leukocytoclastic vasculitis]), elevated liver enzymes, interstitial lung disease (including 
pulmonary fibrosis and pneumonitis), macrophage activation syndrome (MAS), erythema multiforme, 
psoriasis (all types; new onset, and exacerbations including all subtypes) and psoriasiform rash, 
pruritus, rash, seizures, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, and uveitis. Additional 
CDS updates included information regarding an animal lactation study, the response to pneumococcal 
polysaccharide vaccine, a warning regarding latex allergy, and revision of instructions for the

preparation and administration of various etanercept presentations. Terms have also been added that 
provided further description of injection site reactions and allergic reactions. 
In the labeling (Summary of Product Characteristics) for the pre-filled syringe an
d pre-filled pen, 
dosage information specific to children has been enhanced with reco
mmendations for children less than 
62.5 kg to use the powder and sol
vent for solution for injection for accurate mg/kg dosing. Children 
weighing 62.5 kg or more may use the fixed-dose p
re-filled syringe or pre-filled pen. 
Discussion on clinical safety 
In regard to the different subtypes of JIA studied in the study 3338, th
e sample size and the period of 
study (12 weeks) limits assessment of the safety profile regarding the individual ILA
R subtypes. 
Further in
formation regarding possible difference in safety for the individual subtypes will become 
available from the second part of the study 3338 (as described in the RMP). As routine
pharmacovigilance activities, the MAH will include follow-up questionnaires specific
ally designed to 
enable th
e collection of relevant postmarketing medical data for JIA subtypes in children (as described 
in the RMP).  
In addition, the MAH will provide further updated information which will include JIA
descriptions, data on the epidemiology, and important AEs associated with JIA subtypes (as 
 subtypes diagnostic 
described 
in the RMP). 
In the study 20021618 AEs were only collected in the first year. 
Focusing on the study 3338, forty-five (45) subjects (35.4%) reported at least 1 t
reatment-emergent 
adverse event (TEAE), excluding infections and ISRs, through 12 weeks. The most c
ommon TEAEs 
reported in the overall population were headache (7 subjects, 5.5%), followed by fa
tigue, pyrexia, 
abdominal pain, and diarrhea (4 subjects each, 3.1%). In study
 20021618, the most common TEAEs 
reported were injection site reaction (112 events, 210.93 events per 100 subject-years), upper 
respiratory infection (68 events, 128.06 events per 100 subject years), headache (44 eve
nts, 82.86 
events per 100 subject-years), and abdominal pain (20 events, 37.67 events per 100 subject-years). 
Fifty (50) pediatric subjects (86.2%) reported at least 1 TEAE during year 1 of the study.
 After the first 
year of study 20021618, only adverse events that met serious criteria (SAEs) wer
e collected along with 
predefined events of interest (including hospitalization, deaths, serious infections, 
development of 
malignancies, and new signs or symptoms of other connective tissue disease)
. 
Importantly, no deaths occurred in pediatric sub
jects during the first 12 weeks of study 3338 or up to 
10 years of exposure in study 20021618. 
Regarding SAEs, four (4) subjects (3.1%) reported SAEs in the study 3338, of them,
 3 were serious 
infections none was related to etanercept accordin
g the investigators. In addition, the incidence of 
infections in extended oligoarticular JIA subjects was numerically higher than that of the other 2 age 
groups. Moreover, 11 serious infections were reported in 8 paediatric subjects (one case of sepsis was 
reported) in the study 20021618. Serious infections with etanercept treatment are a risk that is 
highlighted in the SmPC and also in view of the well known side effect profile, etanercept is restricted 
for use in children when other treatment options have failed. 
No cases of tuberculosis, blood dyscrasias, demyelinating disorders, autoimmune disorders, or 
malignancies, including lymphomas and skin cancers, were reported in the study 3338. In the 
paediatric population of the study 20021618 no cases of lymphoma, malignancy, demyelinating 
disease, opportunistic infection, or tuberculosis were reported. 
Assessment report  
EMA/548283/2012  
Page 56/63
 
 
 
 
 
In study 3338, the higher rate of AEs in the ERA subgroup is noted, particularly g
astrointestinal 
disorders. The details of the cases descried by the MAH do not raise specific concerns reg
arding a GI 
AE profile for tho
se with ERA, but further information will become available from the rate of non-
infectious AEs related to gastrointestinal disorders that will be reported during Part 2 of the study (as 
described in the RMP). 
In terms of laboratory parameters, the CHMP noted the decrease in neutrophil valu
es (grade 3) in 
5.1% of eoJIA subtype. It should also be noted the decrease in neutrophil values (grade 3) in 5.1% of 
eoJIA subtype. However these decreases were transient and the limited sample si
ze precludes drawing 
any firm conclusions. Further information will be reported during Part 2 of the study
. 
5% of patients in the study 3338 developed antibodies; although it is reassuring th
at none of them 
were positive for neutralizing antibody. Although the numbers developing ADA are
 small those with 
ERA had a higher percentage of ADA positive subjects. The CHMP acknowledges th
at based on efficacy 
and safety variabl
es at week 12, those subjects with anti-etanercept antibodies did not show any 
decrease in the efficacy results compared to the whol
e population of the study. The same is applicable 
for safety. However, there seems to b
e a trend for a higher ADA incidence in the ERA subset. To what 
extent this fact can affect the efficacy and safety in long-term needs to be dis
cussed with the week 96 
data for study 3338. 
Conclusions on the clinical safety 
The safety data provided in the current application has no demonstrated any new or unexpected 
signals from etanercept in children 
with eoJIA from the age of 2 years, ERA or PSA. Further data will be 
available on these JIA subtypes from the 96 week CSR for study 3338.
 Based on the previous 
experience in the JIA population, major differences in safety across the ILAR subtypes for which data 
was provided seem unlikely but assessment for the 96 week data from study 3338 
and the long-term 
extensi
ons study B1801023 (both described in the RMP) will provide further information on this issue.

2.  Benefit-Risk Balance 
Benefits  
Beneficial effects 
Assessment report  
EMA/548283/2012  
Page 58/63
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The beneficial effects of etanercept in 5 subtypes of JIA has been demonstrated in 2
 open label single 
arm trials. Etanercept is already licensed for polyarticular JIA from the age of 2 years (the study group 
which were included in the submitted clinical data in support of this licensed indica
tion can be classified 
by the ILAR criteria as polyarthritis (RF positive) and polyarthritis (RF negative)). T
he data from study 
2
0021618 was assessed in variation II/126 (approved in August 2011), and in this current application 
the MAH has submitted the final CSR for study 20021618 which now includes 10
 years of safety follow-
up. 
Study 3338 provides evidence for a response at 12 weeks in subjects with eoJIA
 from the age of 2 
years and in subjects with ERA and PSA from the age of 12 year
s. The response was assessed by ACR 
Pedi 30, but a beneficial effect was also seen for ACR Pedi 50 and 70 by week 12
 and the effect was 
similar in magnitude in all three subtypes and in all age groups. Comparison
 with historical placebo 
data for the same subtypes provides further support for efficacy.  
Controlled double-blind trials have not been submitted in this variation application
. However as this 
variation builds on previous well established efficacy in the areas of adult RA, adul
t ankylosing 
spondylitis, adult psoriatic arthritis, adult and paediatric plaque psoriasis and JI
A (polyarticular) with 
etanercept and therefore the evidence provided for the extension of indication can be accepted. This is 
because of the rarity of the individual subtypes, the
 expected efficacy with etanercept in the subtypes 
proposed and the difficulty in conducting placebo controlled trials in children wit
h JIA when off-license 
use of etanercept is available. While long-term efficacy has been supported b
y clinical data in 
polyarticular JIA, at present 12 weeks data has been provided for eoJIA, ERA and P
sA in children.   
Uncert
ainty in the knowledge about the beneficial effects 
An area of uncertainty for those with ERA is whether institution of anti-TNF trea
tment can prevent 
progression to axial disease. The MAH has amended the planned long-term study B
1801023 to 
incorporate efficacy evaluations particularly in ERA for effects on spinal disease an
d this is expected to 
provide useful additional insight into the effect of early institution of therapy in ERA
 (as described in 
the RMP). 
Furt
her information on the evidence for maintenance of efficacy will be required, and the final CSR 
from study 3338 w
ill need to be assessed in order to ensure that maintenance of efficacy in these 
three subtypes is similar to that for polyarticular JIA (RF positive and RF negat
ive). Further long-term 
data will be collected for an additional eight years and in addition information on re
mission rates and 
on when to withdraw therapy in those who have clinically inactive disease on tr
eatment for each of the 
three subtypes has been planned for study B1801023 (as describe
d in the RMP). 
Risks  
Unfavourable effects 
The unfavourable effects of etanercept are well established and include infection, op
portunistic 
infection, malignancy, injection site reactions, bone marrow suppression and are in line with the safety 
profile identified in the trials and are clearly highlighted in the SmPC. The data expected from the 
ongoing study 3338 should provide further information (as described in the RMP).  
Uncertainty in the knowledge about the unfavourable effects 
The exposure in the specific subtypes of JIA is limited and further data from the final week 96 CSR 
from study 3338 should provide more information on the safety profile. 
An important area of missing information remains; namely when to cease treatment in a responding 
subject. While this problem was discussed at length with the MAH during variation II/126 (extension of 
Assessment report  
EMA/548283/2012  
Page 59/63
 
 
 
 
 
 
polyarticular JIA indication down to the age of 2 years) the difficulty in collecting s
uch information 
remains an obstacle. However in view of the planned long-term study and 8 year extensi
on study the 
MAH amended the protocol in order to collect information on this issue as restriction of treatment to 
the m
inimum time required is important to minimise unnecessary exposure (as described in the RMP).   
Balance 
Importance of favourable and unfavourable effects  
The importance of alleviating signs and symptoms in children with JIA when th
ey have been 
unresponsive to methotrexate or conventional therapy (in the case of ERA) means
 that these patients 
will have an improved quality of life, less inflammation and pain, better functi
oning of joints and less 
need for steroids. The breakdown of the individual components of the composite of ACR Pedi was 
consistent with the overall results and showed the expected improvement in qualit
y of life, pain score 
and number of swollen joints and joints with limitation of movement. Such bene
ficial effects are 
important for enabling normal development in children. 
The important well established adverse effects of etanercept therapy are highlighted i
n the SmPC and 
under continual pharmac
ovigilance review. Infections and serious infections are the commonest 
adverse event wi
th etanercept. Because of the known risks with etanercept, treatment is limited to 
subjects with active disease who have not responded to methotrexate and in the case of ERA to 
conventional therapy. In addition for subjects who do not show a response to etanerce
pt then therapy 
should be discontinued at 4 months. This ensures that only those who gain benefi
t from treatment 
continue to receive etanercept.  
Benefit-risk balance 
Based on the CHMP r
eview of data on safety and efficacy, the CHMP considered that the risk-benefit 
balance of Enbrel in the treatment of  polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and 
extended oligoarthritis in children and adolescents from the age of 2 years; trea
tment of psoriatic 
arthritis in adolescents from the 
age of 12 years; treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in 
adolescents from the age of 12 years was positive. 
The MAH agreed to include the following wording 
in section 4.1 of the SmPC: 
Juvenile idiopathic arthritis 
Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negative) and extended oligoarthritis in 
children and adolescents from the age
 of 2 years who have had an inadequate response to, or who 
have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who ha
ve had an inadequate 
response to, or who have proved intolerant of, methotrexate. 
Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who have had an 
inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. 
Discussion on the benefit-risk assessment 
In view of the unmet medical need for subjects with the 3 additional subtypes of JIA (eoJIA from age 2 
years, ERA from age 12 yrs and PsA from age 12 years) who have active disease unresponsive to 
methotrexate or conventional therapy, or who are intolerant to methotrexate, the advantages of 
treatment with etanercept are considered to outweigh the safety concerns. Treatment will only be

continued in such subjects if a response is seen, treatment for such cases is lim
ited to experts in the 
field of paediatric rheumatology and guidance in the SmPC helps to ensure that the adver
se event 
profile of etanercept is highlighted, thereby enabling a pro-active approach to m
inimising occurrence of 
adverse events or, if they occur, that they are rapidly diagnosed and treate
d appropriately. An ongoing 
area where information and guidance is lacking is whether early institution of treatm
ent can benefit 
those with ERA who would go on to develop axial disease. Another important area
 of missing 
information is for those who respond t
o treatment and achieve clinically inactive disease, at what point 
should be disconti
nued. The MAH will address both of these issues with the planned study B1801023 
(as described in the RMP). 
3.  Conclusion 
On 21 June 2012 the CHMP considered this Type II variation to be acceptable and agree
d on the 
amendments to be introduced in the Summary of Product Characteri
stics and Package Leaflet. 
The CHMP reviewed th
e available paediatric data of studies subject to the agreed Paediatric 
Investigation Plan (P/241/2011) and the results of these studies are reflected i
n the Summary of 
Product Characteristics (SmPC) and, as appropriate, th
e Package Leaflet. 
4.  EPAR
 changes 
The EPAR will be updated following Commission Decision for this variation. In parti
cular the EPAR 
module 8 "steps after the authorisation" will be updated as follows: 
EPAR scope: 
Extension to the JIA indication to include the: 
- Treatment of polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive or negati
ve) and extended oligoarthritis in 
children and adolescents from the age of 2 years who have had an inadequate resp
onse to, or who 
have proved intolerant of, methotrexate.  
- Treatment of psoriatic arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years who
 have had an inadequate 
response to, or who have proved intolerant of, m
ethotrexate. 
- Treatment of enthesitis-related arthritis in adolescents from the age of 12 years w
ho have had an 
inadequate response to, or who have proved intolerant of, conventional therapy. 
together with reclassifi
cation of the licensed indication of polyarticular JIA into the ILAR classification of 
polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor positive) and polyarthritis (rheumatoid factor negative). Furthermore, 
an additional etanercept dosage regimen of 0.8 mg/kg (up to a maximu
m of 50 mg per dose) once 
weekly (QW) is proposed in addition to the current approved JIA dosage of 0.4 mg/kg (up to a 
maximum of 25 mg per dose) BIW for the treatment of JIA. 
Consequential changes have been made to section 4.1, 4.2, 4.4, 4.8, 5.1 and 5.2 of the SmPC and the 
package leaflet. The product information has been brought in line with the latest QRD templates. In 
addition the list of the local representatives in the PL has been updated.

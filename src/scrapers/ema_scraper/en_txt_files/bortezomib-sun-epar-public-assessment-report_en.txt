2.  Scientific discussion 
2.1.  Introduction 
This application for a marketing authorisation concerns a generic application of a Centrally Authorised 
Medicinal Product according to article 10(1) for Bortezomib SUN 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection. The 
reference product is Velcade 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection which has been authorised in the EU 
since 26th April 2004 through centralised procedure by Janssen-Cilag International NV. 
Bortezomib is a highly selective, reversible inhibitor of 26S proteasome in mammalian cells, a large protein 
complex that degrades ubiquinated proteins. Inhibition of the 26S proteasome prevents this targeted 
proteolysis and affects multiple signalling cascades within the cell, ultimately resulting in cancer cell death. At 
10 µM concentrations, bortezomib does not inhibit any of a wide variety of receptors and proteases screened 
and is more than 1,500 fold more selective for the proteasome than for its next preferable enzyme. The 
kinetics of proteasome inhibition were evaluated in vitro, and bortezomib was shown to dissociate from the 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/449636/2016 
Page 7/24 
 
  
  
proteasome with a t½ of 20 minutes, thus demonstrating that proteasome inhibition by bortezomib is 
reversible. 
Bortezomib mediated proteasome inhibition affects cancer cells in a number of ways, including, but not 
limited to, altering regulatory proteins, which control cell cycle progression and nuclear factor kappa B (NF 
kB) activation. Inhibition of the proteasome results in cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. NF kB is a transcription 
factor whose activation is required for many aspects of tumourigenesis, including cell growth and survival, 
angiogenesis, cell-cell interactions, and metastasis. In myeloma, bortezomib affects the ability of myeloma 
cells to interact with the bone marrow microenvironment. 
The reference product Velcade is indicated as a monotherapy or in combination with other anticancer 
products in treatment of multiple myeloma for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated 
mantle cell lymphoma who are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The applicant 
requested the approval for the following indication: 
Bortezomib as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 
prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation. 
Bortezomib in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients 
with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Bortezomib in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is indicated for the 
induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are eligible for high-
dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
The final indication following CHMP review of this application is: Bortezomib SUNas monotherapy or in 
combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with progressive multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 prior therapy and who have already 
undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Bortezomib SUN in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high dose chemotherapy with 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Bortezomib SUN in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is indicated 
for the induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are eligible for 
high dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Bortezomib SUN in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are unsuitable for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Bortezomib SUN 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection can be used for either intravenous or subcutaneous 
administration, but reconstitution is different. This corresponds to the mode of administration of the 
reference medicinal product (VELCADE 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection, Janssen-Cilag International 
NV, Belgium).

2.2.  Quality aspects 
2.2.1.  Introduction 
The finished product is presented as a powder for solution for injection containing 3.5 mg of bortezomib (as 
mannitol boronic ester) as active substance.  
The only other ingredient is mannitol.  
The product is available in type I glass vials with grey bromobutyl rubber stoppers, sealed with light green 
flip off aluminium seals as described in section 6.5 of the SmPC. 
2.2.2.  Active substance 
General information 
The chemical name of bortezomib is [(1R)-3-methyl-1-[[(2S)-1-oxo-3-phenyl-2-(pyrazinylcarbonyl) 
amino]propyl]amino] butyl] boronic acid corresponding to the molecular formula C19H25BN4O4 and it has a 
relative molecular mass of 384.24 g/mol. It is isolated in its trimeric form which has the chemical name 
2,4,6-tri- [(1R)-3-methyl-1-[[(2S)-1-oxo-3-phenyl-2-(pyrazinylcarbonyl)amino]propyl]amino] butyl] -
1,3,5,2,4,6-trioxatriborinane, the molecular formula C57H69B3N12O9 and a relative molecular mass of 1098.67 
g/mol. Bortezomib and its trimeric form have the following structures:  
The chemical structure of bortezomib trimer was inferred from its route of synthesis and confirmed by 
infrared spectroscopy, 1H and 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, ultraviolet spectroscopy, 
mass spectrometry and elemental analysis. Spectra were recorded in aprotic solvents to distinguish between 
monomeric and trimeric forms as the boroxine is labile in protic solvents. 
The active substance is a white to light brown hygroscopic crystalline powder, slightly soluble in water and 
soluble in methanol.

Bortezomib contains two chiral centres. Diastereomers are controlled by HPLC whilst the amount of 
enantiomer is tested by a chiral HPLC method, all in the active substance specification. The active substance 
is routinely isolated as the same polymorphic form which was shown to be stable during stability studies. The 
active substance is fully dissolved and lyophilised with mannitol, generating the mannitol ester, during 
finished product manufacture so polymorphic form of the active substance is not important for finished 
product performance and is not routinely controlled. 
Manufacture, characterisation and process controls 
Detailed information on the manufacturing process of the active substance has been provided in the 
restricted part of the ASMF and it was considered satisfactory. A single source of active substance is used 
although two manufacturers are used, responsible for different steps. 
Bortezomib is synthesized in four main steps using well defined starting materials with acceptable 
specifications. One originally-proposed starting material was re-defined during the procedure at the request 
of CHMP to ensure that enough of the process is conducted under GMP. One chiral centre originates in a 
starting material, whilst the other is generated during the process using a chiral auxiliary approach. 
Crystallisation under anhydrous conditions ensures the trimeric form of the active substance is isolated. 
Adequate in-process controls are applied during the synthesis. The specifications and control methods for 
intermediate products, starting materials and reagents have been presented.  
The characterisation of the active substance and its impurities are in accordance with the EU guideline on 
chemistry of new active substances. Potential and actual impurities were well discussed with regards to their 
origin and characterised. 
The active substance is doubly packaged in LDPE bags under nitrogen with silica gel desiccant, inside a 
further two aluminium polyaminated bags. These are stored in a black LDPE bag inside a fibre drum. The 
materials comply with the EC directive 2002/72/EC and EC 10/2011 as amended. 
Specification 
The active substance specification includes tests for appearance, solubility (Ph. Eur.), identity (IR, UPLC, 
colour test for boron, LCMS), loss on drying (TGA), residual solvents (GC), impurities (UPLC, HPLC, GC), 
assay (UPLC), clarity of solution (in-house), colour index (in-house), bacterial endotoxins (Ph. Eur.) and 
bioburden (Ph. Eur.). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and non-compendial methods appropriately 
validated in accordance with the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards 
used for assay and impurities testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis data on three production scale batches of the active substance were provided. The results 
were within the specifications and consistent from batch to batch. 
Stability 
Stability data on three production scale batches of active substance from the proposed manufacturer stored 
in the intended commercial package for up to 36 months under long term conditions (-20±5 ºC) and for up to 
6 months under accelerated conditions (5±3 ºC) according to the ICH guidelines were provided. The following 
parameters were tested: description; identification; LoD; related substances; assay; colour and clarity of 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/449636/2016 
Page 10/24 
 
  
  
solution; bacterial endotoxins and bioburden. The analytical methods used were the same as for release. All 
tested parameters remained within specification for the duration of the studies. 
Photostability testing following the ICH guideline Q1B was performed on one batch. Bortezomib is sensitive to 
light and should be stored in the proposed container in order to prevent photo-degradation. Forced 
degradation studies were carried out by exposing one batch to heat or in solution, to acid, alkali and 
oxidative conditions. Bortezomib is relatively heat stable but degrades under the other conditions, especially 
oxidatively. These studies demonstrate that the impurities methods are stability indicating. 
The stability results indicate that the active substance manufactured by the proposed supplier is sufficiently 
stable. The stability results justify the proposed retest period of 24 months at -20±5 ºC in the proposed 
container, which has been shown to provide sufficient protection from light. 
2.2.3.  Finished medicinal product 
Description of the product and Pharmaceutical development 
Bortezomib SUN is a sterile white to off-white lyophilized powder for solution for injection containing the 
active substance and mannitol. The aim was to develop a qualitatively and quantitatively identical formulation 
to Velcade which is a lyophilized powder for intravenous or subcutaneous administration. As such, no 
bioequivalence study was needed. Like the reference product, the active substance is isolated in its trimeric 
form which hydrolyses to the monomer on dissolution in water, and then forms a mannitol ester on addition 
of mannitol followed by freeze drying. The various bortezomib forms have been evaluated by structural 
characterization data. 
A lyophilization process was chosen akin to the reference product to ensure a similar cake is produced. Sterile 
filtration and aseptic filling were chosen rather than terminal sterilization given the instability of the active 
substance to heat. In order to prevent degradation due to contact with the vessel and tubing, bulk solution 
holding times are defined. 
Initially, the applicant miscalculated the amount of trimer required to generate the same strength of product 
as Velcade, resulting in a product which contained 5% more active substance. This major objection was 
resolved by manufacturing new batches using the correct amount of bortezomib trimer and providing new 
assay data during the procedure. Formulae for calculating the requisite amount of active substance have 
been revised and adequately justified. 
The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the finished product and its manufacturing 
process. The quality target product profile (QTPP) was defined as a lyophilized powder in a suitable container 
with a shelf-life of at least 36 months at room temperature and pharmaceutically equivalent to Velcade. 
Potential critical quality attributes (CQAs) were then assessed based on likelihood of impacting patient safety. 
These were then defined as identity, assay (bortezomib and mannitol), impurities, uniformity of dosage units, 
water content, clarity, completeness and pH of reconstituted solution, bacterial endotoxins and particulate 
matter. Only those CQAs liable to be impacted by process variables were monitored during development. 
The potential impact of active substance quality attributes on the CQAs of the finished product was assessed 
using a risk-based approach. The specification of the active substance ensures no adverse impact. 
Manufacturing process parameters were then investigated, again using a risk-based approach for 
prioritization. In order to ensure complete dissolution and thus a uniform finished product, a mixture of water

EMA/CHMP/449636/2016 
Page 11/24 
 
  
  
and tert-butanol is used. Oxygen is excluded and temperature limited to avoid degradation. Process 
parameters were set for the various operations in order to ensure the quality of the finished product. 
However, no multivariate studies were undertaken and no design space is claimed. 
All excipients are well known pharmaceutical ingredients and their quality is compliant with Ph. Eur. 
standards. There are no novel excipients used in the finished product formulation. The list of excipients is 
included in section 6.1 of the SmPC and in paragraph 2.1.1 of this report. 
The primary packaging is a type 1 glass vial with bromobutyl rubber stopper and flip-off aluminium seal. The 
materials comply with Ph. Eur. and EC requirements. The choice of the container closure system has been 
validated by stability data and is adequate for the intended use of the product. 
Manufacture of the product and process controls 
The manufacturing process consists of five main steps: compounding, sterile filtration, aseptic filling, 
lyophilisation and sealing. The process is considered to be a non-standard manufacturing process due to the 
aseptic processing. The process is carried out under nitrogen and diffused light at controlled temperature 
given the sensitivity of the active substance. 
Major steps of the manufacturing process were validated on three successive production scale batches of 
Bortezomib SUN, produced using the previously incorrect batch formula. Given the simplicity of the 
formulation and the likely minor impact of the change on process performance, re-validation of the corrected 
process was not considered necessary. It has been demonstrated that the manufacturing process is capable 
of producing the finished product of intended quality in a reproducible manner. The in-process controls are 
adequate for this type of manufacturing process and pharmaceutical form. 
Product specification 
The finished product release specifications are appropriate for this kind of dosage form and include tests for 
appearance, identity (UV, UPLC), water content (Ph. Eur.), constitution time (in-house), clarity, 
completeness, pH and osmolarity of constituted solution (USP and in-house), particulate matter (Ph. Eur.), 
sterility (Ph. Eur.), uniformity of dosage units (Ph. Eur.), related substances (UPLC), mannitol assay (HPLC) 
and assay (UPLC). 
The analytical methods used have been adequately described and appropriately validated in accordance with 
the ICH guidelines. Satisfactory information regarding the reference standards used for assay and impurities 
testing has been presented. 
Batch analysis results were provided for three production scale batches confirming the consistency of the 
manufacturing process and its ability to manufacture to the intended product specification. 
Stability of the product 
Stability data for three production scale batches of finished product stored for up to 12 months under long 
term conditions (25 ºC / 60% RH) and for up to 6 months under accelerated conditions (40 ºC / 75% RH) 
according to the ICH guidelines were provided. Samples were tested for description, identification, water 
content, reconstitution time, clarity, completeness, pH and osmolarity of reconstituted solution, particulate 
matter, sterility, related substances and assay. The analytical procedures used are stability indicating.  
The batches of medicinal product contain 5% more active substance than those planned for marketing due to 
the miscalculation in the batch formula. However, given that the only difference is the amount of active 
substance, they were packed in the primary packaging proposed for marketing and that there were no 
Assessment report  
EMA/CHMP/449636/2016 
Page 12/24 
 
  
  
significant trends to any of the measured parameters throughout the study period, they are considered 
representative. Additional stability studies using batches containing the correct amount of active substance 
have been started. 
In addition, one batch was exposed to light as defined in the ICH Guideline on Photostability Testing of New 
Drug Substances and Products. Although the active substance is photosensitive, the finished product, stored 
in its commercial pack, is not susceptible to light-induced degradation which demonstrates the protective 
nature of the packaging. 
A temperature cycling study was undertaken to evaluate stability during shipping and handling. Samples 
were stored between -20 and 40 oC alternatively over a four week period without detriment to the quality of 
the finished product, thus demonstrating it is robust to the variations in temperature encountered during 
shipping and handling operations. 
A reconstitution stability study was also carried out using 0.9% NaCl solution as per the SmPC. Solutions (1 
and 2.5 mg/ml) were stored in the original vial and in sterile syringes at 25 oC demonstrating in-use stability 
for up to 8 hours, without protection from light. The applicant committed to repeat the study on a batch near 
the end of its shelf-life. 
Based on available stability data, the proposed shelf-life of 12 months in the commercial pack, with the vials 
inside the carton to protect from light, without special temperature storage conditions as stated in the SmPC 
(section 6.3) is acceptable. 
Adventitious agents 
No excipients derived from animal or human origin have been used. 
2.2.4.  Discussion on chemical, and pharmaceutical aspects 
Information on development, manufacture and control of the active substance and finished product has been 
presented in a satisfactory manner. The applicant has applied QbD principles in the development of the 
finished product and its manufacturing process although no design space or regulatory flexibility is claimed. 
The results of tests carried out indicate consistency and uniformity of important product quality 
characteristics, and these in turn lead to the conclusion that the product should have a satisfactory and 
uniform performance in clinical use. 
The major objection on starting materials was resolved by re-definition. The major objection relating to the 
incorrect calculation of active substance was also resolved by manufacturing new batches. It was considered 
that the change on composition was unlikely to affect manufacturing parameters or stability of the product. 
2.2.5.  Conclusions on the chemical, pharmaceutical and biological aspects  
The quality of this product is considered to be acceptable when used in accordance with the conditions 
defined in the SmPC. Physicochemical and biological aspects relevant to the uniform clinical performance of

2.2.6.  Recommendations for future quality development 
In the context of the obligation of the MAHs to take due account of technical and scientific progress, the 
CHMP recommends the following points for investigation: 
  Stability studies on the new batches of Bortezomib SUN manufactured using the correct amount of 
active substance should be carried out for the duration of the shelf-life. 
 
The reconstitution stability study should be repeated on a batch near the end of its shelf-life. 
2.3.  Non-clinical aspects 
2.3.1.  Introduction 
The applicant did not submit non-clinical data with this application. A non-clinical overview on the 
pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which is based on up-to-date and 
adequate scientific literature. The non-clinical aspects of the SmPC are in line with the SmPC of the reference 
product. The impurity profile has been discussed and was considered acceptable. 
2.3.2.  Ecotoxicity/environmental risk assessment 
No Environmental Risk Assessment was submitted. This was justified by the applicant as the introduction of 
Bortezomib SUN manufactured by Sun pharmaceuticals Industries Europe B.V. is considered unlikely to result 
in any significant increase in the combined sales volumes for all bortezomib containing products and the 
exposure of the environment to the active substance. Thus, the ERA is expected to be similar and not 
increased. 
2.3.3.  Discussion and conclusion on non-clinical aspects 
A non-clinical overview on the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and toxicology has been provided, which 
justifies why there is no need to generate additional non-clinical pharmacology, pharmacokinetics and 
toxicology data. Therefore, the CHMP agreed that no further non-clinical studies are required.  
The impurity profile of applicant´s bortezomib is comparable to that of VELCADE. Thus, additional toxicology 
studies to qualify the impurity profile of the drug product are not required. 
In line with the Guideline on the Environmental Risk Assessment of Medicinal Products for Human Use 
(EMEA/CHMP/SWP/4447/00), the justification for not providing new ERA studies is acceptable. 
2.3.4.  Conclusion on the non-clinical aspects 
The CHMP is of the opinion that the applicant has justified the lack of non-clinical studies based on the 
literature review and the claim that Bortezomib SUN is a generic of the reference product VELCADE. The 
literature data presented in the dossier is considered acceptable and sufficient for the assessment of non-
clinical aspects of Bortezomib SUN in the applied indications.

2.4.  Clinical aspects  
2.4.1.  Introduction 
The Applicant has not conducted clinical pharmacology, efficacy and safety studies with Bortezomib SUN 3.5 
mg powder for solution for injection. The relevant SmPC sections of Bosterzomib SUN are in line with the 
SmPC of the reference product VELCADE. 
Exemption  
The Applicant states that Bortezomib SUN 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection has identical composition 
as the reference medicinal product (it contains the same active substance in the same concentration as the 
brand leader Velcade 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection).  
According to the CHMP Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence (CPMP/EWP/QWP/1401/98 Rev. 
1/Corr**), 20 January 2010, Appendix II, a biowaiver for a parenteral solution can be accepted provided it is 
administered as an aqueous intravenous solution containing the same active substance as the currently 
approved reference product and excipients do not interact and/or otherwise affect the disposition of the drug 
substance. In the case of other parenteral routes, e.g. intramuscular or subcutaneous, and when the test 
product is of the same type of solution, contains the same concentration of the same active substance and 
the same excipients in similar amounts as the medicinal product currently approved, bioequivalence studies 
are not required.  
2.4.2.  Pharmacokinetics  
No new pharmacokinetic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.3.  Pharmacodynamics 
No new pharmacodynamic studies were presented and no such studies are required for this application.  
2.4.4.  Post marketing experience 
No post-marketing data are available. The medicinal product has not been marketed in any country. 
2.4.5.  Discussion on clinical aspects 
Based on the submitted data it can be concluded that Bortezomib SUN 3.5 mg powder for solution for 
injection has the same pharmaceutical form, route of administration and strength as VELCADE 3.5 mg 
powder for solution for injection. According to the current Guideline on the Investigation of Bioequivalence 
(CPMP/QWP/EWP/1401/98/Rev1) no bioequivalence studies are needed for this type of application.  
During the assessment, the applicant submitted an updated clinical overview to add the new indication, which 
was approved during the procedure: Bortezomib in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, 
doxorubicin and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle

cell lymphoma who are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. The SmPC has been updated 
with the new indication. 
2.4.6.  Conclusions on clinical aspects 
A summary of the literature with regard to clinical data of Bortezomib SUN and justifications that the active 
substance does not differ significantly in properties with regards to safety and efficacy of the reference 
product was provided and was accepted by the CHMP. This is in accordance with the relevant guideline and 
additional clinical studies were not considered necessary. 
2.5.  Risk management plan 
The CHMP received the following PRAC Advice on the submitted Risk Management Plan: 
The PRAC considered that the risk management plan version 1.2 is acceptable.  
The CHMP endorsed this advice without changes.

3.  Benefit-risk balance 
This application concerns a generic version of bortezomib, 3.5 mg powder for solution for injection. The 
reference product Velcade is indicated for: 
Velcade as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone is 
indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma who have received at least 1 
prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation. 
Velcade in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with 
previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic 
stem cell transplantation. 
Velcade in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is indicated for the 
induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are eligible for high 
dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
Velcade in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is indicated for the 
treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are unsuitable for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
A bioequivalence study was not submitted and this was considered acceptable. Bortezomib SUN contains the 
same active ingredient and excipients in the same concentration and pharmaceutical formulation using the 
same route of administration (parenteral) as for the reference product. The results of tests carried out 
indicate consistency and uniformity of the important product quality characteristics for Bortezomib SUN, 
hence, the quality of this product is considered to be acceptable. 
No nonclinical studies have been provided for this application but an adequate summary of the available 
nonclinical information for the active substance was presented and considered sufficient. From a clinical 
perspective, this application does not contain new data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics as 
well as the efficacy and safety of the active substance; the applicant’s clinical overview on these clinical 
aspects based on information from published literature was considered sufficient. 
The CHMP, having considered the data submitted in the application and available on the chosen reference 
medicinal product, is of the opinion that no additional risk minimisation activities are required beyond those 
included in the product information. 
Therefore, the benefit risk balance for Bortezomib SUN is considered positive. 
4.  Recommendation 
Similarity with authorised orphan medicinal products 
The CHMP by consensus is of the opinion that Bortezomib SUN is not similar to Revlimid (lenalidomide), 
Thalomide Celgene (thalidomide), Imnovid (pomalidomide), Farydak (panobinostat), Kyprolis (carfilzomib), 
Darzalex (daratumumab), Imbruvica (ibrutinib) and Torisel (temsirolimus), within the meaning of Article 3 of 
Commission Regulation (EC) No. 847/200. See appendix 1.

Outcome 
Based on the CHMP review of data on quality, safety and efficacy, the CHMP considers by consensus that the 
benefit-risk balance of Bortezomib SUN in the following indications: 
- Bortezomib SUN as monotherapy or in combination with pegylated liposomal doxorubicin or dexamethasone 
is indicated for the treatment of adult patients with progressive multiple myeloma who have received at least 
1 prior therapy and who have already undergone or are unsuitable for haematopoietic stem cell 
transplantation. 
- Bortezomib SUN in combination with melphalan and prednisone is indicated for the treatment of adult 
patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are not eligible for high-dose chemotherapy with 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
- Bortezomib SUN in combination with dexamethasone, or with dexamethasone and thalidomide, is indicated 
for the induction treatment of adult patients with previously untreated multiple myeloma who are eligible for 
high-dose chemotherapy with haematopoietic stem cell transplantation. 
- Bortezomib SUN in combination with rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin and prednisone is indicated 
for the treatment of adult patients with previously untreated mantle cell lymphoma who are unsuitable for 
haematopoietic stem cell transplantation, 
is favourable and therefore recommends the granting of the marketing authorisation  subject to the following

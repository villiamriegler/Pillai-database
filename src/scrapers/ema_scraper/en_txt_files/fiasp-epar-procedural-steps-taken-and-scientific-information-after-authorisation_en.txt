SmPC, 
The SmPC section 4.8 has been updated with new 
updated safety pool, further to assessment of the 
Labelling and 
frequencies for allergic reactions, lipodystrophy and 
last PSUR assessment for insulin aspart 
(EMEA/H/C/PSUSA/00001749/201809). 
This update is based on 3 efficacy and safety 
studies: NN1218-3852 (52 week) – a study of Fiasp 
compared to insulin aspart both in combination with 
insulin detemir in adults with Type 1 Diabetes; 
NN1218-3854 a study of Continuous Subcutaneous 
Insulin Infusion of Fiasp compared to NovoRapid in 
adults with Type 1 Diabetes; NN1218-4131 a study 
of Fiasp compared to NovoRapid both in combination 
with insulin degludec in adults with Type 1 Diabetes.

NN1218-4101, supported by data from the Clinical 
Pharmacology trials NN1218-4371 and clinical study 
NN1218-3888 which was included in the initial MAA. 
As a consequence, sections 4.1, 4.2, 4.8, and 5.1 of 
the SmPC and the corresponding sections of the 
Package Leaflet are updated accordingly.  
In addition, the Marketing authorisation holder 
(MAH) took the opportunity to make other non-
related minor or editorial changes were implemented 
throughout the EU PI to increase 
readability/consistency. 
An updated RMP version 3.1 was agreed during the 
procedure.

Based on the post-marketing data submitted within this

insulin aspart 
PSUR, the PRAC concludes that anaphylactic reactions 
should be added to section 4.8 of the SmPC for Fiasp, in 
line with the SmPC for NovoRapid and NovoMix.  Following 
7 new reported cases of medically confirmed systemic 
allergic reactions for Fiasp and the already established 
evidence suggesting a causal relationship between insulin

aspart and anaphylactic reactions, the updates to the 
section 4.8 of SmPC for Fiasp are justified.

To mitigate the risk of medication errors due to mix up 
Update of the RMP to upgrade the risk of mix-up 
between basal and bolus insulin from a potential to 
an important identified risk (RMP version 2.1); in 
addition, to update the secondary packaging material 
design and change colour of selected plastic 
components from yellow to red, consequently section 
4.2 of the SmPC is being updated to no longer 
include the word “yellow” due to the new proposed 
colour coding of Fiasp. The PL has been updated 
accordingly. A communication to Health Care 
Professionals and Patients regarding similarity of 
Fiasp and Tresiba products that are currently on the 
market has been agreed. 
B.II.e.6.a - Change in any part of the (primary) 
packaging material not in contact with the finished 
between Fiasp and Tresiba, the MAH has proposed 2 new 
risk minimisation measures (RMMs): (1) introduction of 
new colour coding for Fiasp and (2) use of educational 
materials as part of a communication strategy prior to the 
new colours being implemented.   
The proposed new colour coding for Fiasp comprise 
changes from yellow with a white contrast to yellow with a 
red contrast on the labels and cartons and from yellow to 
red for plastic components for the prefilled pens.   
As a result of this group of variations, section 4.2 of the 
SmPC is being updated to no longer include the word 
“yellow” due to the new proposed colour coding of Fiasp: 
“FlexTouch is colour coded yellow and accompanied by a 
package leaflet with detailed instructions for use to be 
followed”. The PL has been updated accordingly. 
The risk management plan (RMP) has been updated 
accordingly to provide background information on the

details of the colour coding changes and details of the

follow up reports of medication errors has been additionally 
updated.   
Changes unrelated to medication errors, mainly concerning 
extent of use of the product, have also been made to the 
RMP.

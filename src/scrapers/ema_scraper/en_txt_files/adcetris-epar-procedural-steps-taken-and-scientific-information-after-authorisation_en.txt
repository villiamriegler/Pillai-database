Please refer to Scientific Discussion “Adcetris 
on final results from study C25006, a multi-centre 
open-label, phase 4 study of 50 patients with r/r 
sALCL undertaken to further evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of brentuximab vedotin as a single agent 
in adult patients who had previously received at least 
1 multiagent chemotherapy regimen. This study was 
listed as an interventional category 2 PASS in the 
RMP (SOB 010). In addition, the MAH took the 
opportunity to request the granting of a marketing 
authorisation not subject to specific obligations and 
valid for five years, in accordance with Article 14-
a(8) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, thereby 
deleting SOB 010 from the annex II and of the 
reference to the conditional marketing authorisation 
from annex II and the package leaflet. The revised 
RMP version 16.1 has also been submitted. An 
editorial update under section 5.1 of the SmPC 
(update of the ATC code) has been implemented.

In addition, the CHMP, having considered the 
application as set out in the appended assessment 
report and having reviewed the data submitted by 
the marketing authorisation holder including the 
evidence concerning compliance with specific 
obligations, is of the opinion that the risk-benefit 
balance of the above mentioned medicinal product 
remains favourable, that all specific obligations laid 
down in Annex II have been fulfilled and that 
comprehensive data supports a favourable benefit-
risk balance of the above mentioned medicinal 
product. Therefore, pursuant to Article 14-a(8) of 
Regulation (EC) No 726/2004, the CHMP 
recommends by consensus the granting of a 
marketing authorisation in accordance with Article 
14(1) of Regulation (EC) No 726/2004 for the above 
mentioned medicinal product for which the draft

reported at the time of primary analysis (HR = 1.11 [95% 
CI (0.72, 1.70)]). The hazard ratio for PFS per investigator 
for patients with 2 or more risk factors was 0.41 (95% CI 
[0.29, 0.58]). The hazard ratio for PFS per investigator for 
patients with 3 or more risk factors was 0.38 (95% CI

considerable different for patients ≥65 years as compared 
to patients <65 years. Furthermore, as also mentioned by 
the MAH older age is an important risk factor for, among 
others, the occurrence of neutropenia and febrile 
neutropenia.

patients show a multi-exponential decline in antibody-drug 
conjugate (ADC) serum concentrations with a terminal half-
life of approximately 4 to 5 days. Exposures were 
approximately dose proportional with a trend observed for 
lower ADC exposures at lower ages/ body weights in the 
study population. Median ADC AUC in children and 
adolescents from this study was approximately 14% and 
3% lower than in adult patients, respectively, while 
monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) exposures were 53% 
lower and 13% higher, respectively, than in adult patients. 
There was a trend of increased clearance of brentuximab 
vedotin in paediatric patients confirmed positive for anti-
drug antibodies (ADAs). No patients aged <12 years and 2 
patients aged ≥12 became persistently ADA positive. 
The overall response rate was 47% in response-evaluable

weeks (range, 5 to 39 weeks). The median time to best 
overall response, defined as the time from first dose to the 
clinical best response of CR or PR, was 11 weeks (range, 5

receive SCT after a median of 7 cycles (range, 4 to 16 
cycles) of brentuximab vedotin treatment. The 32 patients 
(53%) who did not receive subsequent SCT also received 
brentuximab vedotin for a median of 7 cycles (range, 1 to 
16 cycles).  
Of the study’s 60 patients, 49 patients (82%) received >1 
prior cancer-related treatment and 11 patients (18%) 
received 1 prior cancer-related treatment. Per review 
facility, the ORR was 51% (95% CI [36%, 66%]) for the 
patients who had received >1 prior cancer-related 
treatment and 45% (95% CI [17%, 77%]) for the patients 
who had received 1 prior cancer-related treatment. For the 
patients who received >1 prior cancer-related treatment, a 
best overall response of CR was reported for 6 patients 
(12%); PR was reported for 19 patients (39%). For the 
patients who received 1 prior cancer-related treatment, CR 
was reported for 1 patient (9%) and PR was reported for 4 
patients (36%). Out of the 49 patients receiving >1 line of 
prior treatment, 22 patients (45%) received subsequent 
SCT; of the 11 patients who had received 1 prior 
treatment, 6 patients (55%) received subsequent SCT.

Though PK data are limited, co administration of rifampicin 
appeared to reduce plasma concentrations of MMAE 
metabolites that could be assayed.   
MMAE is further metabolized mainly to an equally potent 
metabolite; however, its exposure is an order of magnitude 
lower than that of MMAE. Thus, it is not likely to have any 
substantial contribution to the systemic effects of MMAE. 
Overall, the safety findings for the 20 adult patients in 
Study C25005 were consistent with the known toxicity 
profile of brentuximab vedotin. No new safety signals were

concomitant medications may also increase the risk. Liver 
function should be tested before initiating the treatment 
and routinely monitored in patients receiving brentuximab 
vedotin. Patients experiencing hepatotoxicity may require a 
delay, change in dose or discontinuation of brentuximab 
vedotin.

responded (CR or PR) to treatment with brentuximab 
vedotin was evaluated in a phase 2, open-label, multicenter 
trial. Twenty patients with relapsed or refractory HL 
received a starting dose of 1.8 mg/kg and one patient 
received a starting dose of 1.2 mg/kg of ADCETRIS 
administered intravenously over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. 
The median number of cycles was 7 (range, 2 to 37 
cycles). Of the 20 evaluable patients with HL, 6 patients 
(30%) achieved a CR and 6 patients (30%) achieved a PR 
with brentuximab vedotin retreatment, for an ORR of 60%. 
The median duration of response was 9.2 and 9.4 months 
in patients who achieved OR (CR+PR) and CR, respectively. 
Seven patients with relapsed sALCL received a starting 
dose of 1.8 mg/kg and one patient received a starting dose 
of 1.2 mg/kg of ADCETRIS administered intravenously over 
30 minutes every 3 weeks. The median number of cycles 
was 8.5 (range, 2 to 30 cycles). Of the 8 sALCL patients, 3 
were retreated twice for a total of 11 retreatment 
experiences. Retreatment with brentuximab vedotin 
resulted in 6 CRs (55%) and 4 PRs (36%), for an ORR of 
91%. The median duration of response was 8.8 and 12.3 
months in patients who achieved OR (CR+PR) and CR, 
respectively. 
The types and rates of adverse reactions reported for 
patients retreated with ADCETRIS were consistent with 
those observed in the combined pivotal phase 2 studies, 
with the exception of peripheral motor neuropathy, which 
Page 31/40 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
had a higher incidence (28% vs. 9% in the pivotal phase 2 
studies) and was primarily Grade 1 or 2. Patients also had 
a higher incidence of arthralgia, Grade 3 anaemia, and back 
pain compared to patients observed in the combined pivotal 
phase 2 studies. 
The incidence of pre-existing peripheral neuropathy in 
patients with relapsed or refractory HL or sALCL who were 
retreated with brentuximab vedotin was 48%. Treatment 
emergent neuropathy occurred in 69% of the population. At 
the time of last evaluation, the majority of patients who 
were retreated and experienced treatment-emergent 
peripheral neuropathy (80%) had improvement or 
resolution of their peripheral neuropathy symptoms. 
Peripheral neuropathy led to discontinuation in 21% and 
dose modifications in 34% of patients who were retreated.  
In view of these data, the recommended starting dose for 
the retreatment of patients with relapsed or refractory HL 
or sALCL who have previously responded to treatment with 
ADCETRIS is 1.8 mg/kg administered as an intravenous 
infusion over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. Alternatively, 
treatment may be started at the last tolerated dose.

Adcetris to patients with hepatic impairment and to 
patients with renal impairment. Pharmacokinetic data from 
this study were submitted to support the proposal for an 
updated advice to physicians on treatment of patients with 
hepatic or renal impairment. Available data indicate that 
antimicrotubule agent monomethyl auristatin E (MMAE) 
clearance might be affected by severe renal impairment, 
hepatic impairment, and by low serum albumin 
concentrations. Compared to patients with normal renal 
function, MMAE exposure increased approximately 1.9-fold 
in patients with severe renal impairment (creatinine 
clearance < 30 ml/min) and no effect was observed in 
patients with mild or moderate renal impairment; 
compared to patients with normal hepatic function, MMAE 
exposure increased approximately 2.3- fold in patients with 
hepatic impairment. The proposed recommended starting 
dose in patients with severe renal impairment and in 
patients with hepatic impairment is 1.2 mg/kg is therefore 
considered acceptable.
